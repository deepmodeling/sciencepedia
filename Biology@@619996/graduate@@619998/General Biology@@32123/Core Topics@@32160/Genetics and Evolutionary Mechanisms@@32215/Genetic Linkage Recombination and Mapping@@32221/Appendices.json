The reciprocal classes (e.g., $A B C$ and $a b c$) have quantitatively similar counts, as expected from meiosis. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\nThe solution proceeds. The objective is to determine the linear order of the three genes and the genetic distances between them. The analysis of a three-point testcross relies on identifying the different classes of gametes produced by the heterozygous parent. Since the tester parent is homozygous recessive ($a b c$), the phenotype of the progeny directly reveals the genetic constitution of the gamete from the trihybrid parent.\n\nFirst, we classify the progeny based on their frequencies. The principle is that parental (non-recombinant) gametes are the most frequent, and double crossover (DCO) gametes are the least frequent.\n- The two most frequent phenotypic classes are $A B C$ (count $3,579$) and $a b c$ (count $3,573$). These represent the parental, or non-recombinant, gametes. The total number of non-recombinant progeny is $N_{P} = 3,579 + 3,573 = 7,152$. This is consistent with the given parental haplotypes $A B C$ and $a b c$.\n- The two least frequent phenotypic classes are $A b C$ (count $76$) and $a B c$ (count $74$). These represent the double crossover (DCO) gametes, which arise from two simultaneous crossover events. The total number of DCO progeny is $N_{DCO} = 76 + 74 = 150$.\n\nNext, we determine the gene order. A double crossover event switches the middle allele between the two parental chromosomes. By comparing the allelic composition of a DCO gamete with a parental gamete, we can identify the gene in the middle. Let us compare the parental haplotype $A B C$ with the DCO haplotype $A b C$. The alleles for loci $A$ and $C$ are the same ($A$ and $C$), while the allele for locus $B$ has been exchanged ($B$ for $b$). This indicates that locus $B$ is located between loci $A$ and $C$. The correct gene order is therefore $A - B - C$. As per the problem's notation where $1 \\equiv A$, $2 \\equiv B$, and $3 \\equiv C$, the gene order is $(1, 2, 3)$.\n\nWith the gene order established, we can now classify the remaining four progeny classes, which result from single crossover (SCO) events.\n- A single crossover between gene $A$ and gene $B$ (Region $1$) would produce the gametes $A b c$ and $a B C$. The observed counts for these classes are $525$ and $523$, respectively. The total number of SCO progeny for Region $1$ is $N_{SCO1} = 525 + 523 = 1,048$.\n- A single crossover between gene $B$ and gene $C$ (Region $2$) would produce the gametes $A B c$ and $a b C$. The observed counts for these classes are $826$ and $824$, respectively. The total number of SCO progeny for Region $2$ is $N_{SCO2} = 826 + 824 = 1,650$.\n\nNow, we compute the genetic map distances. The map distance between two loci is defined as the recombination frequency between them, expressed in centiMorgans (cM). One centiMorgan corresponds to a $1\\%$ recombination frequency. The recombination frequency ($RF$) is the ratio of the number of recombinant progeny to the total number of progeny. It is crucial to remember that the total number of recombinant events between two loci includes *both* single crossovers in that interval *and all* double crossovers.\n\nThe distance between locus $A$ and locus $B$, denoted $d_{1\\text{–}2}$, is calculated as:\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{N_{SCO1} + N_{DCO}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1,048 + 150}{10,000} = \\frac{1,198}{10,000} = 0.1198$$\nThe map distance is then:\n$$d_{1\\text{–}2} = RF_{A-B} \\times 100 = 0.1198 \\times 100 = 11.98 \\text{ cM}$$\nThis value is already provided to four significant figures.\n\nThe distance between locus $B$ and locus $C$, denoted $d_{2\\text{–}3}$, is calculated similarly:\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1,650 + 150}{10,000} = \\frac{1,800}{10,000} = 0.1800$$\nThe map distance is then:\n$$d_{2\\text{–}3} = RF_{B-C} \\times 100 = 0.1800 \\times 100 = 18.00 \\text{ cM}$$\nThis value is given to four significant figures.\n\nThe inferred genetic map is: $A \\xrightarrow{11.98\\text{ cM}} B \\xrightarrow{18.00\\text{ cM}} C$.\n\nTo confirm the non-randomness of crossover events (genetic interference), we can compare the observed DCO frequency with the expected DCO frequency. The expected frequency is the product of the recombination frequencies of the two adjacent regions:\n$$RF_{expected DCO} = RF_{A-B} \\times RF_{B-C} = 0.1198 \\times 0.1800 \\approx 0.02156$$\nThe expected number of DCO progeny is $10,000 \\times 0.02156 = 215.6$.\nThe observed number is $150$. The coefficient of coincidence is $C = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO}}{\\text{Expected DCO}} = \\frac{150}{215.6} \\approx 0.696$.\nThe interference is $I = 1 - C = 1 - 0.696 = 0.304$. This positive interference value indicates that a crossover in one region reduces the probability of a simultaneous crossover in the adjacent region, a common biological phenomenon.\n\nThe final answer requires the gene order as a permutation of $(1,2,3)$ and the two adjacent map distances, $d_{1\\text{–}2}$ and $d_{2\\text{–}3}$.\nThe gene order is $A-B-C$, which corresponds to $(1, 2, 3)$.\nThe distances are $d_{1\\text{–}2} = 11.98$ and $d_{2\\text{–}3} = 18.00$.\nThe required output is a single row matrix containing these five values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 11.98 & 18.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2801497"}, {"introduction": "While recombination frequency ($r$) is an observable proportion, genetic map distance ($d$) is a theoretical measure of the expected number of crossovers.

This practice moves beyond simple approximations to explore how mapping functions—mathematical models that relate $r$ to $d$—provide more accurate distance estimates by incorporating different assumptions about crossover interference, such as the no-interference model of Haldane versus the positive-interference model of Kosambi [@problem_id:2801515].", "problem": "A large backcross in a diploid species yields an empirically estimated recombination fraction of $r=0.22$ between two codominant genetic markers.

We are given an empirical recombination fraction $r = 0.22$. The final results must be expressed in centiMorgans (cM) and rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\nFirst, we address the Haldane no-interference model. This model assumes that crossover events along a chromosome bivalent occur according to a Poisson process. The genetic map distance in Morgans, which we will denote as $x$, is defined as the expected number of exchanges on a single chromatid between the two loci. If the crossovers on the bivalent are Poisson-distributed, the number of exchanges $K$ affecting a single chromatid also follows a Poisson distribution with mean $x$. The probability of observing $k$ exchanges is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-x) x^k}{k!}$$\nA recombinant chromatid is produced if an odd number of exchanges occur between the loci. Therefore, the recombination fraction $r$ is the sum of probabilities for all odd values of $k$:\n$$r = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} P(K = 2j+1) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\exp(-x) x^{2j+1}}{(2j+1)!}$$\nThis sum can be recognized in the context of the Taylor series for hyperbolic functions.

The problem directs us to use the Kosambi mapping function, which relates the recombination fraction $r$ to the map distance in Morgans, $x_K$, as follows:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2} \\tanh(2x_K)$$\nThis function accounts for positive interference, where one crossover event reduces the probability of another occurring nearby.

Consider two codominant markers $M_1$ and $M_2$ that lie on the same chromosome. Let the true recombination fraction between $M_1$ and $M_2$ be $r$, and assume no crossover interference along the chromosome. Each marker genotype, when assayed, is independently miscalled with probability $\\varepsilon$ (a symmetric two-state flip between the two backcross genotype classes), and each marker genotype is independently missing with probability $m$ (missing at random). The investigator uses the naive two-point estimator that excludes individuals with missing data at either $M_1$ or $M_2$, and among the remaining individuals estimates the recombination fraction by the observed proportion of recombinant genotype pairs. The genetic distance is then computed under the no-interference assumption using the standard mapping function for that regime. Assume a sample size sufficiently large that expectations approximate observed proportions.\n\nGround your reasoning in first principles: the definition of recombination fraction $r$ as the Bernoulli probability of a recombination event between homologous chromatids in gamete formation in the backcross, independence of per-locus genotyping errors across loci and individuals, and the no-interference relationship between recombination fraction and map distance. Do not assume any ad hoc correction formula that directly gives the observed recombination fraction under error; instead, derive any necessary expressions from the stated assumptions.\n\nNow analyze the following concrete parameterization: $r = 0.12$, $\\varepsilon = 0.02$, and $m = 0.10$.

The naive two-point estimate remains approximately $r = 0.12$ because random genotyping errors cancel on average; however, missing data at rate $m = 0.10$ will downwardly bias the estimate by reducing the denominator. To correct multi-marker inflation, drop all individuals with any missing calls and use more stringent significance thresholds when adding markers.\n\nB. The naive two-point estimate is inflated to approximately $r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 0.150$ under $\\varepsilon = 0.02$, while missing-at-random at rate $m = 0.10$ does not bias the expectation of the two-point estimator but increases its variance; the corresponding no-interference map distance inflates from approximately $13.72$ centiMorgans to approximately $17.83$ centiMorgans. Corrective ordering should incorporate an explicit genotyping error parameter into a multipoint Hidden Markov Model (HMM), estimate $\\varepsilon$ by maximum likelihood (e.g., Expectation-Maximization (EM)), and marginalize over missing genotypes rather than listwise deletion; evaluate local order permutations (“rippling”) by maximizing the multipoint likelihood and applying a length penalty (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) to discourage spurious map expansion, and iteratively flag and revisit genotypes with high local posterior error probabilities.\n\nC.

It is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Expected Naive Estimate\n\nFirst, we analyze the components of the naive estimation procedure.\n\n**1. Effect of Missing Data**\nThe procedure excludes any individual with a missing genotype at either $M_1$ or $M_2$. The probability of observing a genotype at a single locus is $(1-m)$. Since missingness is independent across loci, the probability that an individual has non-missing data at both $M_1$ and $M_2$ is $(1-m)^2$. For $m=0.10$, this probability is $(1-0.10)^2 = 0.90^2 = 0.81$.\nThe problem states the data are missing at random (MAR). This implies that conditioning on the subset of individuals with complete data does not alter the expected frequencies of true genotypes. Therefore, pairwise deletion of missing data reduces the effective sample size, which increases the variance of the estimate, but it does not introduce a systematic bias into the expected value of the estimator. We can thus analyze the effect of genotyping error on the sub-population of individuals with complete data.\n\n**2. Effect of Genotyping Error**\nLet $r$ be the true recombination fraction. In a large sample from a backcross, the proportion of true parental genotypes is $(1-r)$ and the proportion of true recombinant genotypes is $r$.\nThe genotyping error $\\varepsilon$ is a symmetric flip between the two possible genotype states at a locus. We need to find the probability that a truly parental or recombinant individual is *observed* as recombinant. This observed proportion is the naive estimate, $r_{\\text{obs}}$.\n\nAn individual's genotype pair is classified as parental if the genotypes at $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the same, and recombinant if they are different.\nAn error is a flip of the observed genotype. Errors are independent at each locus.\n\n-   **Consider a truly parental individual (proportion $1-r$):**\n    The genotypes at $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the same. This individual will be *observed as recombinant* if one locus is read correctly and the other is read incorrectly.\n    The probability of this is:\n    $$P(\\text{obs rec} | \\text{true par}) = P(\\text{correct at } M_1, \\text{error at } M_2) + P(\\text{error at } M_1, \\text{correct at } M_2)$$\n    $$P(\\text{obs rec} | \\text{true par}) = (1-\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) = 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)$$\n\n-   **Consider a truly recombinant individual (proportion $r$):**\n    The genotypes at $M_1$ and $M_2$ are different. This individual will be *observed as recombinant* if both loci are read correctly, or if both loci are read incorrectly (a double error makes the pair appear different again).\n    The probability of this is:\n    $$P(\\text{obs rec} | \\text{true rec}) = P(\\text{correct at } M_1, \\text{correct at } M_2) + P(\\text{error at } M_1, \\text{error at } M_2)$$\n    $$P(\\text{obs rec} | \\text{true rec}) = (1-\\varepsilon)(1-\\varepsilon) + \\varepsilon\\varepsilon = (1-\\varepsilon)^2 + \\varepsilon^2$$\n\nThe overall expected proportion of observed recombinants, $r_{\\text{obs}}$, is the sum of these possibilities weighted by the true proportions:\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = P(\\text{obs rec}) = P(\\text{obs rec} | \\text{true par}) P(\\text{true par}) + P(\\text{obs rec} | \\text{true rec}) P(\\text{true rec})$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = [2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)](1-r) + [(1-\\varepsilon)^2 + \\varepsilon^2](r)$$\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = (2\\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^2)(1-r) + (1 - 2\\varepsilon+\\varepsilon^2+\\varepsilon^2)(r)$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = (2\\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^2) - r(2\\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^2) + r(1 - 2\\varepsilon + 2\\varepsilon^2)$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = (2\\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^2) + r(1 - 2\\varepsilon + 2\\varepsilon^2 - (2\\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^2))$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = (2\\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^2) + r(1 - 4\\varepsilon + 4\\varepsilon^2)$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) + r(1-2\\varepsilon)^2$$\nAn alternative, equivalent formulation is $r_{\\text{obs}} = r + (1-2r) \\cdot 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)$.

To get centiMorgans (cM), we use $d_{\\text{cM}} = -50 \\ln(1 - 2r)$.\n\n-   **True map distance (using $r = 0.12$):**\n    $$d_{\\text{true}} = -50 \\ln(1 - 2 \\cdot 0.12) = -50 \\ln(1 - 0.24) = -50 \\ln(0.76)$$\n    $$d_{\\text{true}} \\approx -50(-0.27443) \\approx 13.72 \\text{ cM}$$\n\n-   **Observed map distance (using $r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 0.150$):**\n    $$d_{\\text{obs}} = -50 \\ln(1 - 2 \\cdot 0.150) = -50 \\ln(1 - 0.30) = -50 \\ln(0.70)$$\n    $$d_{\\text{obs}} \\approx -50(-0.35667) \\approx 17.83 \\text{ cM}$$\nThe genotyping error causes the estimated recombination fraction to inflate from $0.12$ to approximately $0.150$, which in turn inflates the estimated map distance from approximately $13.72$ cM to approximately $17.83$ cM. This phenomenon is known as spurious map expansion.\n\n**5. Algorithmic Recommendations**\nTo build a robust multi-marker linkage map in the presence of genotyping errors and missing data, one must abandon the naive two-point approach. State-of-the-art methods involve:\n-   **Multipoint Likelihood Models**: Using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is the standard. The true sequence of genotypes along a chromosome is the \"hidden\" state, and the observed genotypes are the \"emissions\". Transition probabilities in the HMM are functions of recombination fractions between adjacent markers.\n-   **Explicit Error Modeling**: The HMM's emission probabilities must explicitly model the genotyping error rate, $\\varepsilon$. The model becomes $P(\\text{observed genotype} | \\text{true genotype})$.\n-   **Parameter Estimation**: The recombination fractions and the error rate $\\varepsilon$ are estimated simultaneously by maximizing the total likelihood of the data over the entire map. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is the standard tool for this maximum likelihood estimation in HMMs.\n-   **Handling Missing Data**: Instead of discarding data (pairwise or listwise deletion), an HMM handles missing data naturally by summing (marginalizing) over all possible hidden states at the missing locus, weighted by their probabilities given the flanking data. This is a far more efficient use of information.\n-   **Order Optimization and Model Selection**: Finding the best marker order involves testing local permutations (e.g., a \"ripple\" procedure) and choosing the order that maximizes the multipoint likelihood. To prevent overfitting and spurious map expansion, this maximization is often penalized. Model selection criteria like the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) can be used to penalize map length (models with more recombination events).\n-   **Error Diagnostics**: After map construction, the posterior probability of a genotyping error can be calculated for each data point using the Viterbi or forward-backward algorithms. Genotypes with high posterior error probabilities can be flagged for re-scoring or blanked for a subsequent round of mapping.\n\n---\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The naive two-point estimate remains approximately $r = 0.12$ because random genotyping errors cancel on average; however, missing data at rate $m = 0.10$ will downwardly bias the estimate by reducing the denominator. To correct multi-marker inflation, drop all individuals with any missing calls and use more stringent significance thresholds when adding markers.**\n-   **Incorrect.** The derivation shows that random errors do not cancel out; they cause a systematic inflation of the recombination fraction for linked markers. Missing-at-random data does not bias the expected value of the estimator. The recommended corrective actions are inefficient and do not address the root cause of the problem.\n\n**B. The naive two-point estimate is inflated to approximately $r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 0.150$ under $\\varepsilon = 0.02$, while missing-at-random at rate $m = 0.10$ does not bias the expectation of the two-point estimator but increases its variance; the corresponding no-interference map distance inflates from approximately $13.72$ centiMorgans to approximately $17.83$ centiMorgans. Corrective ordering should incorporate an explicit genotyping error parameter into a multipoint Hidden Markov Model (HMM), estimate $\\varepsilon$ by maximum likelihood (e.g., Expectation-Maximization (EM)), and marginalize over missing genotypes rather than listwise deletion; evaluate local order permutations (“rippling”) by maximizing the multipoint likelihood and applying a length penalty (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) to discourage spurious map expansion, and iteratively flag and revisit genotypes with high local posterior error probabilities.**\n-   **Correct.** This option correctly quantifies the inflation of both the recombination fraction and the map distance, correctly describes the statistical effect of MAR missing data, and accurately details the state-of-the-art algorithmic framework for robust linkage mapping that addresses both genotyping error and missing data. Every component of this statement is correct according to the principles of statistical genetics.\n\n**C. The naive two-point estimate is unchanged at approximately $r = 0.120$ because errors at the two loci are independent; to stabilize ordering, compute pairwise recombination fractions with pairwise deletion and then take a majority vote across adjacent intervals, designating all ambiguous or missing states as recombinant to be conservative.**\n-   **Incorrect.** As derived, the estimate is inflated, not unchanged. The reasoning (\"because errors at the two loci are independent\") is faulty. The recommendation to designate missing states as recombinant is a profoundly flawed procedure that would introduce massive bias and catastrophic map expansion.\n\n**D. The naive two-point estimate is deflated to approximately $r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 0.100$ because genotyping errors mask true recombinants; to prevent expansion, switch to the Kosambi mapping function and impute missing genotypes to the most frequent allele at each marker before ordering.**\n-   **Incorrect.** The estimate is inflated, not deflated. The proposed solutions are misguided. Switching mapping functions addresses interference, not genotyping error. Imputing to the most frequent allele is a naive and biased method that would artificially reduce estimated recombination fractions.\n\n**E. The naive two-point estimate is inflated by approximately $2\\varepsilon$, giving $r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 0.160$; to correct, filter out markers departing from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, then freeze the marker order that minimizes the sum of adjacent recombination fractions without modeling error or missingness.**\n-   **Incorrect.** The approximation $r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx r + 2\\varepsilon$ is inaccurate; the calculation shows the inflation is to $\\approx 0.150$. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is not expected in a backcross population, so this filter is inappropriate. Minimizing the sum of recombination fractions without an error model is a naive \"traveling salesman\" approach that is known to be highly sensitive to genotyping errors, often producing incorrect maps. It does not correct for error; it is victimized by it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2801527"}]}
