By deducing the genotype-to-phenotype map from first principles of enzyme function, you will see how the homozygous recessive state of an upstream gene can mask the effects of a downstream gene, leading to the well-known 9:3:4 ratio of recessive epistasis.", "problem": "A metabolic pathway in a haploid-dominance diploid plant produces an anthocyanin pigment through two serial enzymatic steps. Gene $A$ encodes enzyme $\\mathrm{E1}$ that converts a precursor $S$ to an intermediate $I$, and gene $B$ encodes enzyme $\\mathrm{E2}$ that converts $I$ to the final pigment $P$. A functional allele at $A$ (denoted $A$) produces an active $\\mathrm{E1}$; its loss-of-function allele (denoted $a$) produces no active $\\mathrm{E1}$. A functional allele at $B$ (denoted $B$) produces an active $\\mathrm{E2}$; its loss-of-function allele (denoted $b$) produces no active $\\mathrm{E2}$. Both loss-of-function alleles are recessive. Assume independent assortment of $A$ and $B$, complete dominance within each locus, no selection, and equal gamete contributions.\n\nIn addition, gene $A$ is pleiotropic: beyond pigment production, it also influences vacuolar pH through a separate regulatory role in another tissue, but this pleiotropic effect does not alter viability and is not scored in this experiment. Pleiotropy here means that a single gene influences two distinct traits. The causal interpretation of allele action should be grounded in the Central Dogma of molecular biology (CD), namely that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alleles are transcribed to ribonucleic acid (RNA) and translated into proteins, so that a loss-of-function allele leads to absence of the corresponding enzyme activity.\n\nDefine three phenotypic categories for flower color: Purple when $P$ accumulates, Yellow when $I$ accumulates but $P$ does not, and White when neither $I$ nor $P$ accumulates.

The pathway is serial: $S \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{E1}} I \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{E2}} P$. Therefore:\n- If there is at least one functional $A$ allele, enzyme $\\mathrm{E1}$ is present and $I$ can form; if genotype is $aa$, $\\mathrm{E1}$ is absent and $I$ cannot form.\n- If there is at least one functional $B$ allele, enzyme $\\mathrm{E2}$ is present and $I$ can be converted to $P$; if genotype is $bb$, $\\mathrm{E2}$ is absent.\n\nRecessive epistasis arises when the homozygous recessive genotype at one locus masks the phenotypic effect of the other locus. Because $A$ acts upstream, $aa$ prevents formation of $I$ regardless of the state at $B$, so $aa$ is epistatic to $B$.\n\nConstructing genotype–phenotype rules. Using the dominance notation `A-` to mean “at least one $A$ allele” and `B-` to mean “at least one $B$ allele,” the rules consistent with the biochemistry and recessive epistasis are:\n- Purple: $A\\text{-}B\\text{-}$, because both enzymes are present and $P$ accumulates.\n- Yellow: $A\\text{-}bb$, because $\\mathrm{E1}$ makes $I$ but $\\mathrm{E2}$ is absent, so $I$ accumulates without conversion to $P$.\n- White: $aaB\\text{-}$ or $aabb$, because without $\\mathrm{E1}$, no $I$ forms, and thus neither $I$ nor $P$ accumulates; the $B$ genotype is irrelevant (masked).\n\nThese rules implement recessive epistasis of $aa$ over $B$.\n\nCross design and segregation. The parents $AABB \\times aabb$ produce $F1$ genotype $AaBb$ (all Purple by the rules above). The $F1$ self is $AaBb \\times AaBb$. Under Mendel’s law of segregation for a single locus self of $Aa$:\n- $P(AA) = 1/4$, $P(Aa) = 1/2$, $P(aa) = 1/4$.\nLikewise for the $B$ locus:\n- $P(BB) = 1/4$, $P(Bb) = 1/2$, $P(bb) = 1/4$.\n\nUnder independent assortment, joint genotype probabilities are products of single-locus probabilities.\n\nVerification of the $9\\!:\\!3\\!:\\!4$ expectation.

Viability and fecundity combine multiplicatively to determine absolute fitness, and the logarithm of absolute fitness per generation (the Malthusian fitness) is therefore additive across independent fitness components. Four isogenic genotypes were constructed and assayed in a constant environment. The mean Malthusian fitnesses per generation (dimensionless) were measured as:\n- $w_{ab} = 0.000$,\n- $w_{Ab} = 0.070$,\n- $w_{aB} = 0.030$,\n- $w_{AB} = 0.020$.\nUsing the foundational definition that epistasis between two loci is the deviation of the double mutant’s Malthusian fitness from the value expected under additivity of the single-mutant effects on this logarithmic scale, compute the two-locus additive epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon$ for $A$ and $B$.

Report the value of $\\epsilon$ as a dimensionless number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the two-locus additive epistasis coefficient, denoted by $\\epsilon$, and the classification of the nature of this epistasis. The analysis is based on a set of Malthusian fitness values for four genotypes at two unlinked loci, $A/a$ and $B/b$. The Malthusian fitness, $w$, is the logarithm of the absolute fitness. The reference genotype is $ab$, and its fitness is set to zero, $w_{ab} = 0.000$. The other provided Malthusian fitnesses are $w_{Ab} = 0.070$, $w_{aB} = 0.030$, and $w_{AB} = 0.020$.\n\nThe problem defines epistasis as the deviation of the double mutant’s Malthusian fitness from the value expected under the additivity of single-mutant effects. Let us formalize this. The effect of introducing allele $A$ into the reference background ($ab$) is the fitness difference $\\Delta w_A(b) = w_{Ab} - w_{ab}$. The effect of introducing allele $B$ into the reference background is similarly $\\Delta w_B(a) = w_{aB} - w_{ab}$.\n\nUnder a model of pure additivity (no epistasis), the Malthusian fitness of the double mutant, $w_{AB}^{add}$, would be the sum of the reference fitness and the individual effects of the two mutations.\n$$w_{AB}^{add} = w_{ab} + (w_{Ab} - w_{ab}) + (w_{aB} - w_{ab})$$\nThis simplifies to $w_{AB}^{add} = w_{Ab} + w_{aB} - w_{ab}$.\n\nThe epistasis coefficient, $\\epsilon$, is the difference between the observed fitness of the double mutant, $w_{AB}$, and this expected additive fitness, $w_{AB}^{add}$.\n$$\\epsilon = w_{AB} - w_{AB}^{add} = w_{AB} - (w_{Ab} + w_{aB} - w_{ab})$$\nRearranging terms gives the standard formula for the epistasis coefficient:\n$$\\epsilon = w_{AB} - w_{Ab} - w_{aB} + w_{ab}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$\\epsilon = 0.020 - 0.070 - 0.030 + 0.000$$\n$$\\epsilon = 0.020 - 0.100$$\n$$\\epsilon = -0.080$$\nThis is a case of negative epistasis, where the combined effect of the two mutations is less than the sum of their individual effects. Rounding to four significant figures as required gives $\\epsilon = -0.0800$.\n\nNext, we must classify the type of epistasis. This classification depends on how the marginal fitness effect of one mutation changes across the genetic background of the other locus.\nThe marginal fitness effect of the mutation from $a$ to $A$ depends on the allele at the $B$ locus.\nIn the background with allele $b$, the effect is:\n$$\\Delta w_A(b) = w_{Ab} - w_{ab} = 0.070 - 0.000 = 0.070$$\nIn the background with allele $B$, the effect is:\n$$\\Delta w_A(B) = w_{AB} - w_{aB} = 0.020 - 0.030 = -0.010$$\n\nSimilarly, the marginal fitness effect of the mutation from $b$ to $B$ depends on the allele at the $A$ locus.\nIn the background with allele $a$, the effect is:\n$$\\Delta w_B(a) = w_{aB} - w_{ab} = 0.030 - 0.000 = 0.030$$\nIn the background with allele $A$, the effect is:\n$$\\Delta w_B(A) = w_{AB} - w_{Ab} = 0.020 - 0.070 = -0.050$$\n\nWe now analyze these marginal effects for the classification:\n1.  **No epistasis**: This would occur if $\\epsilon = 0$, meaning the marginal effects are constant (e.g., $\\Delta w_A(b) = \\Delta w_A(B)$). Since $\\epsilon = -0.080 \\neq 0$, there is epistasis.\n2.  **Magnitude epistasis**: This occurs when the sign of a marginal effect is constant across backgrounds, but its magnitude changes. For example, $\\text{sign}(\\Delta w_A(b)) = \\text{sign}(\\Delta w_A(B))$. This is not the case, as $\\Delta w_A(b)$ is positive ($0.070$) while $\\Delta w_A(B)$ is negative ($-0.010$).\n3.  **Sign epistasis**: This occurs when the marginal effect of at least one mutation changes sign depending on the genetic background. The effect of mutation $A$ is beneficial ($\\Delta w_A(b) > 0$) in the $b$ background but deleterious ($\\Delta w_A(B)  0$) in the $B$ background. Therefore, sign epistasis is present.\n4.  **Reciprocal sign epistasis**: This is a stronger condition where the marginal effects of *both* mutations change sign. We have already established this for mutation $A$. For mutation $B$, its effect is beneficial ($\\Delta w_B(a) > 0$) in the $a$ background but deleterious ($\\Delta w_B(A)  0$) in the $A$ background.\n\nSince the fitness effect of allele $A$ inverts its sign contingent upon the allelic state at locus $B$, and concurrently, the fitness effect of allele $B$ inverts its sign contingent upon the allelic state at locus $A$, the interaction is correctly classified as reciprocal sign epistasis. This is a classic example of a \"fitness peak shift\" scenario, where moving from the reference genotype $ab$ to the double mutant $AB$ requires traversing a fitness valley if one mutates the genes in a specific order (e.g., $ab \\to aB \\to AB$).\n\nThe final results are the epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon = -0.0800$ and the classification as reciprocal sign epistasis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.0800  \\text{Reciprocal sign epistasis} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2825515"}, {"introduction": "To move beyond pairwise interactions and analyze the complex genetic architecture of traits, we need a more general and rigorous quantitative framework.

Due to the effect coding $s_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$, these columns are mutually orthogonal.

A unique solution exists if and only if the matrix $X^T X$ is invertible. This, in turn, is true if and only if the design matrix $X$ has full column rank. In our case, $X$ is an $8 \\times 8$ matrix, and it has full rank if its columns are linearly independent.\n\nAs established in Part 1, the columns of the design matrix $X$ are mutually orthogonal. A set of non-zero orthogonal vectors is necessarily linearly independent. Any non-trivial linear combination of these vectors cannot be the zero vector. Since the columns of $X$ are linearly independent, the matrix $X$ has rank $8$. This guarantees that $X^T X = 8I$ is invertible, and a unique solution $\\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y = \\frac{1}{8} X^T Y$ exists.\n\nTherefore, all $8$ coefficients—the intercept $\\mu$, the three single-locus effects $a_A, a_B, a_C$, the three pairwise epistatic effects $e_{AB}, e_{AC}, e_{BC}$, and the three-way epistatic effect $e_{ABC}$—are uniquely identifiable from the complete dataset of $2^3$ genotypes. This is a general property of full factorial designs with orthogonal coding.\n\nRegarding pleiotropy: Pleiotropy is the phenomenon where a single gene affects multiple distinct phenotypic traits. The analysis here pertains to a single trait, $Y$. If the loci $A$, $B$, and $C$ were pleiotropic, they would also influence other traits, say $Z_1, Z_2, \\ldots$. For each such trait, if a complete set of $2^3$ measurements were available, one could perform an identical analysis: $Z_1 = X \\beta_1$, $Z_2 = X \\beta_2$, etc. The identifiability of the coefficient vector $\\beta$ for trait $Y$ is a mathematical question concerning the system $Y = X \\beta$. It depends solely on the properties of the design matrix $X$ and the availability of the data vector $Y$. The fact that the same matrix $X$ might be used to analyze other data vectors ($Z_1, Z_2, \\ldots$) has no bearing on the identifiability of $\\beta$.
