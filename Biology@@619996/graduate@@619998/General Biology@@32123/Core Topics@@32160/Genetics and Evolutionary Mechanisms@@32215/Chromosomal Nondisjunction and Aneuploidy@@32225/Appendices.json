This practice delves into the powerful molecular genetic techniques used to distinguish between Meiosis I and Meiosis II errors by analyzing inheritance patterns of genetic markers. By examining heterozygosity at loci tightly linked to the centromere, you will learn to interpret genotype data in a trisomic individual to deduce the origin of the aneuploidy, exploring the key concepts of maternal heterodisomy and isodisomy. [@problem_id:2785862]", "problem": "A laboratory investigates the stage of origin of an autosomal trisomy by genotyping a dense panel of short tandem repeat (STR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers spanning a chromosome, including multiple markers lying within a very small recombination fraction ($$ 1%) from the centromere. It is known from parental genotypes and allele-dosage that the extra copy is maternal. The lab wants to use centromere-proximal genotype patterns to distinguish meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ from meiosis $\\mathrm{II}$ nondisjunction in the mother. Which statements correctly capture how centromere-proximal heterozygosity informs this distinction under standard meiotic biology?\n\nChoose all that apply.\n\nA. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two different maternal alleles (maternal heterodisomy) in addition to the paternal allele (e.g., three-allele profiles or a $1\\!:\\!1\\!:\\!1$ dosage pattern when all alleles differ), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ nondisjunction in the mother.\n\nB.

It describes a standard scenario in human genetics for determining the meiotic stage of a nondisjunction event using DNA markers. The premises are scientifically sound and the question is well-posed, asking for a correct description of the underlying biological principles.\n\nLet us begin with a formal analysis based on the principles of meiosis. A maternal primary oocyte contains a pair of homologous chromosomes for the autosome in question. Let us denote the maternally-inherited homolog as $M_{p}$ and the paternally-inherited homolog as $M_{f}$. We assume the mother is heterozygous for a genetic marker tightly linked to the centromere, carrying allele $A_{1}$ on $M_{p}$ and allele $A_{2}$ on $M_{f}$.\n\nBefore meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs during the S phase. The chromosome pair now consists of two replicated homologous chromosomes. $M_{p}$ is composed of two identical sister chromatids, both carrying allele $A_{1}$. $M_{f}$ is composed of two identical sister chromatids, both carrying allele $A_{2}$. The structure is a bivalent containing four chromatids.\n\nThe problem specifies markers are \"tightly linked to the centromere\" with a recombination fraction of $$ 1%. This means crossing over between the marker locus and the centromere is a rare event. For the most parsimonious explanation, we assume no crossover occurs in this centromere-proximal region.\n\nCase 1: Meiosis I Nondisjunction\nIn meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are supposed to segregate. A nondisjunction event at this stage means the entire bivalent, containing both the $M_{p}$ and $M_{f}$ replicated homologs, moves to the secondary oocyte. The first polar body receives no chromosome of this type. Meiosis II then proceeds normally, separating the sister chromatids. The resulting gamete (ovum) will contain one unreplicated chromosome derived from $M_{p}$ and one unreplicated chromosome derived from $M_{f}$. Consequently, the ovum is disomic, carrying both alleles $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. Upon fertilization by a normal paternal gamete carrying allele $A_{3}$, the resulting trisomic zygote will have the genotype $A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}$. The presence of two different maternal alleles ($A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$) is termed **maternal heterodisomy**. This is the characteristic signature of a meiosis I error for centromere-proximal markers.\n\nCase 2: Meiosis II Nondisjunction\nIn this scenario, meiosis I proceeds correctly. The homologous chromosomes $M_{p}$ and $M_{f}$ segregate. The secondary oocyte receives one replicated homolog (e.g., $M_{p}$ containing two sister chromatids both with allele $A_{1}$), while the first polar body receives the other ($M_{f}$). Nondisjunction then occurs during meiosis II, where the sister chromatids fail to separate. The resulting ovum receives both sister chromatids from the $M_{p}$ homolog. The ovum is thus disomic and carries two identical copies of allele $A_{1}$. Upon fertilization by a normal paternal gamete carrying allele $A_{3}$, the trisomic zygote will have the genotype $A_{1}A_{1}A_{3}$. The presence of two identical maternal alleles ($A_{1}$ and $A_{1}$) is termed **maternal isodisomy**. This is the characteristic signature of a meiosis II error for centromere-proximal markers.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\nA. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two different maternal alleles (maternal heterodisomy) in addition to the paternal allele (e.g., three-allele profiles or a $1\\!:\\!1\\!:\\!1$ dosage pattern when all alleles differ), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ nondisjunction in the mother.\nThis statement is a precise summary of our derivation for Case 1. The failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I results in a gamete containing both homologs, leading to heterodisomy for any heterozygous loci. The term \"most parsimoniously\" correctly accounts for the assumption that a single nondisjunction event is the cause, rather than more complex scenarios.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two identical maternal alleles (maternal isodisomy) plus a paternal allele (e.g., two-allele profiles with a $2\\!:\\!1$ dosage skew favoring one maternal allele), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis $\\mathrm{II}$ nondisjunction in the mother.\nThis statement is a precise summary of our derivation for Case 2. The failure of sister chromatids to separate in meiosis II results in a gamete containing two identical chromosome copies, leading to isodisomy. The dosage skew of $2\\!:\\!1$ is the expected quantitative result from genotyping.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Centromere-proximal heterozygosity in the duplicated maternal contribution is the hallmark of meiosis $\\mathrm{II}$ nondisjunction, whereas centromere-proximal homozygosity is the hallmark of meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ nondisjunction, because crossing over in meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ makes sisters non-identical near the centromere.\nThis statement is factually inverted. As derived above, centromere-proximal heterozygosity (heterodisomy) is the hallmark of a meiosis I error, and homozygosity (isodisomy) is the hallmark of a meiosis II error. The provided reasoning is also flawed. Crossing over occurs between *non-sister* chromatids, and for regions tightly linked to the centromere, it is a rare event that does not define the standard outcome. In the absence of such a rare crossover, sister chromatids remain identical.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Because recombination can occur anywhere, including very near the centromere with non-negligible probability, centromere-proximal heterozygosity cannot meaningfully distinguish meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ from meiosis $\\mathrm{II}$ nondisjunction.\nThis statement is an invalid generalization. While recombination is possible near the centromere, its frequency is significantly suppressed (a phenomenon known as centromere interference). The problem itself defines the region with a recombination fraction $$ 1%. This low probability means the distinction is statistically powerful and highly meaningful. A meiosis II error can only produce apparent heterodisomy if a crossover occurs between the centromere and the marker locus. For a marker with $1\\%$ recombination, this will be the explanation in fewer than $1\\%$ of meiosis II error cases. Therefore, the method is indeed meaningful.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In the presence of one or more crossovers distal to the centromere, a meiosis $\\mathrm{I}$ nondisjunction often produces a transition from centromere-proximal maternal heterodisomy to telomeric maternal isodisomy, whereas meiosis $\\mathrm{II}$ nondisjunction typically shows the opposite pattern (centromere-proximal maternal isodisomy with possible distal heterodisomy if a crossover occurred between the centromere and the telomere).\nLet us analyze this with a distal crossover. Let the maternal homologs be $C_{1}T_{1}$ and $C_{2}T_{2}$, where $C$ is the centromeric marker and $T$ is the telomeric marker. After replication and a single crossover between non-sister chromatids, the four chromatids in the bivalent are $C_{1}T_{1}$, $C_{1}T_{2}$, $C_{2}T_{1}$, and $C_{2}T_{2}$.\n- For a meiosis I error, the gamete receives a chromosome derived from the $C_1$ centromere and one from the $C_2$ centromere. The segregation of chromatids in meiosis II can result in a gamete containing, for example, the chromatids $C_{1}T_{1}$ and $C_{2}T_{1}$. This represents centromeric heterodisomy ($C_{1}C_{2}$) and telomeric isodisomy ($T_{1}T_{1}$). The statement is correct for meiosis I.\n- For a meiosis II error, meiosis I segregates homologs correctly. The secondary oocyte might receive the replicated homolog with chromatids $C_{1}T_{1}$ and $C_{1}T_{2}$. If these sister chromatids fail to separate, the gamete contains both. This represents centromeric isodisomy ($C_{1}C_{1}$) and telomeric heterodisomy ($T_{1}T_{2}$). The statement is also correct for meiosis II.\nThis describes the powerful technique of mapping the transition point from isodisomy to heterodisomy to locate the position of meiotic crossovers.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2785862"}, {"introduction": "While understanding individual nondisjunction events is fundamental, a quantitative perspective is needed to appreciate the overall risk of aneuploidy at the level of a single gamete.

For each chromosome $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, we define a Bernoulli random variable $X_i$.\nThe event $X_i=1$ signifies nondisjunction for chromosome $i$, with probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=1) = p$.\nThe event $X_i=0$ signifies normal disjunction for chromosome $i$, with probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=0) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(X_i=1) = 1-p$.\nThe random variables $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are stipulated to be independent.\nThe total aneuploidy burden, $K$, is the sum of these variables: $K = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. This random variable $K$ represents the total count of aneuploid chromosomes in the gamete.\n\nWe are tasked to derive three quantities from first principles.\n\n1) The probability mass function (PMF) of $K$.\nThe PMF, denoted $p_K(k)$, gives the probability $\\mathbb{P}(K=k)$. The random variable $K$ can take integer values from $0$ to $n$.\nThe event $K=k$ signifies that exactly $k$ chromosomes out of $n$ have undergone nondisjunction. To derive its probability, we must employ combinatorial principles.\nFirst, we select the $k$ chromosomes that will exhibit nondisjunction. The number of ways to choose $k$ specific chromosomes from a set of $n$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$.\nFor any single such choice of $k$ chromosomes (let us say, those with indices in a set $I_k$ of size $k$) and the remaining $n-k$ chromosomes (indices in the complement set $I_{n-k}$), the probability of this specific configuration is given by:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{i \\in I_k} \\{X_i=1\\} \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\in I_{n-k}} \\{X_j=0\\}\\right) $$\nDue to the stipulated independence of the variables $X_i$, this joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ \\left(\\prod_{i \\in I_k} \\mathbb{P}(X_i=1)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in I_{n-k}} \\mathbb{P}(X_j=0)\\right) $$\nSubstituting the given probabilities, we have:\n$$ p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThis is the probability for one specific combination of $k$ nondisjunction events and $n-k$ normal disjunction events. Since there are $\\binom{n}{k}$ such distinct, mutually exclusive combinations that result in a total of $k$ aneuploidies, the total probability $\\mathbb{P}(K=k)$ is the sum of these probabilities:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(K=k) = \\sum_{\\text{all combinations}} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThis expression is valid for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. This is, by definition, the PMF of a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, which we denote as $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,p)$.\n\n2) The probability generating function (PGF) of $K$.\nThe PGF is defined as $G_K(z) = \\mathbb{E}[z^K]$. We derive this from its definition and the properties of expectation.\n$$ G_K(z) = \\mathbb{E}[z^K] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[z^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{n} z^{X_i}\\right] $$\nBecause the random variables $X_i$ are independent, any functions of these variables, such as $z^{X_i}$, are also mutually independent. The expectation of a product of independent random variables is the product of their individual expectations.\n$$ G_K(z) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[z^{X_i}] $$\nNow, we must compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[z^{X_i}]$ for a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$. By the definition of expected value for a discrete random variable:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[z^{X_i}] = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} z^x \\mathbb{P}(X_i=x) = z^0 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X_i=0) + z^1 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X_i=1) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[z^{X_i}] = 1 \\cdot (1-p) + z \\cdot p = 1 - p + pz $$\nThis is the PGF for a single Bernoulli trial. Since all $X_i$ are identically distributed, this expression is the same for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\nSubstituting this back into the product:\n$$ G_K(z) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - p + pz) = (1 - p + pz)^n $$\nThis is the PGF for the binomial distribution $\\text{Binomial}(n,p)$.\n\n3) The probability that the focal gamete is euploid.\nA gamete is defined as euploid if and only if $K=0$. We must therefore calculate $\\mathbb{P}(K=0)$.\nWe can derive this directly from the PMF we found in part 1) by substituting $k=0$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(K=0) = \\binom{n}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{n-0} $$\nBy definition, $\\binom{n}{0} = 1$ and for any non-zero $p$, $p^0=1$. If $p=0$, the expression is also trivially correct. Thus:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(K=0) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1-p)^n = (1-p)^n $$\nThis result is intuitively clear: for a gamete to be euploid, all $n$ chromosomes must undergo normal disjunction. The probability of normal disjunction for a single chromosome is $1-p$. Since all such events are independent, the probability that all $n$ events occur is the product of their individual probabilities, which is indeed $(1-p)^n$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the PGF derived in part 2). The general definition of a PGF is $G_K(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(K=k)z^k$. The probability of the event $K=0$ is the coefficient of the $z^0$ term, which can be found by evaluating the PGF at $z=0$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(K=0) = G_K(0) $$\nUsing our derived PGF:\n$$ G_K(0) = (1 - p + p \\cdot 0)^n = (1 - p)^n $$\nBoth methods yield the same, consistent result.
