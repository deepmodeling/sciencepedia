Assume a dioecious species with autosomal inheritance, discrete non-overlapping generations, random mating, and equal variance in reproductive success within each sex (the idealizing assumptions of the Wright–Fisher (WF) model).

Evaluate $N_e$ for the given values $N_m = 30$ and $N_f = 70$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in population genetics, specifically the theory of genetic drift and effective population size. It is well-posed, providing a clear definition and sufficient information for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are biologically plausible. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in theoretical biology. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe derivation proceeds by equating the coalescence probability in the actual population with that of an ideal reference population.\n\nFirst, we calculate the one-generation coalescence probability, $P_{coal, actual}$, for two gene lineages sampled at random from the offspring generation in the specified population. Let the two lineages be $L_1$ and $L_2$. Based on the provided premise, for each lineage, the probability of tracing to a male parent is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of tracing to a female parent is $\\frac{1}{2}$. As the parental origins of the two lineages are independent events, we can define four mutually exclusive scenarios for the parental sexes:\n1.  Both lineages trace to male parents. The probability of this event is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  Both lineages trace to female parents. The probability of this event is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  Lineage $L_1$ traces to a male parent and $L_2$ to a female parent. The probability is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  Lineage $L_1$ traces to a female parent and $L_2$ to a male parent. The probability is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNow, we determine the conditional probability of coalescence for each scenario. Coalescence occurs if both lineages trace to the same individual parent.\n- In scenario $1$, both lineages trace to the sire pool of $N_m$ males. Under the assumption of random mating and equal variance in reproductive success (as in the WF model), each of the $N_m$ males has an equal chance of being the parent. The probability that both lineages trace to the same specific male is $\\frac{1}{N_m}$.\n- In scenario $2$, both lineages trace to the dam pool of $N_f$ females. By the same logic, the probability that they trace to the same specific female is $\\frac{1}{N_f}$.\n- In scenarios $3$ and $4$, the lineages trace to parents of different sexes. Therefore, they cannot coalesce in the parent generation, and the probability of coalescence is $0$.\n\nThe total probability of coalescence, $P_{coal, actual}$, is the sum of the probabilities of these pathways:\n$$P_{coal, actual} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{N_m}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{N_f}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 0\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 0\\right)$$\n$$P_{coal, actual} = \\frac{1}{4N_m} + \\frac{1}{4N_f}$$\nThis expression can be simplified to:\n$$P_{coal, actual} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{N_f + N_m}{N_m N_f} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we determine the coalescence probability, $P_{coal, ideal}$, for the ideal reference population. The problem specifies an \"ideal WF population of diploid breeders\" of size $N_e$. While the simplest WF model is monoecious, the context is a dioecious species. A consistent comparison requires a reference population that shares the same fundamental reproductive biology. Therefore, the ideal population is interpreted as a dioecious population of size $N_e$ with a balanced sex ratio, i.e., $N_m' = N_e/2$ and $N_f' = N_e/2$. We apply the same logic as above to this ideal population:\n$$P_{coal, ideal} = \\frac{1}{4N_m'} + \\frac{1}{4N_f'} = \\frac{1}{4(\\frac{N_e}{2})} + \\frac{1}{4(\\frac{N_e}{2})}$$\n$$P_{coal, ideal} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\frac{1}{2N_e} = \\frac{2}{2N_e} = \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\n\nThe problem defines $N_e$ as the size where the coalescence probabilities are equal: $P_{coal, actual} = P_{coal, ideal}$.\n$$\\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f} \\right) = \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\nSolving for $N_e$:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4}{\\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f}}$$\nThis is the harmonic mean of the number of males and females, multiplied by $4$. Simplifying the expression further gives the closed-form requested:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4}{\\frac{N_f + N_m}{N_m N_f}} = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\nThis is the derived closed-form expression for the effective population size.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given values $N_m = 30$ and $N_f = 70$.\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 30 \\times 70}{30 + 70}$$\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 2100}{100}$$\n$$N_e = 4 \\times 21$$\n$$N_e = 84$$\nThe effective population size is $84$. The total census size of the breeding population is $N = N_m + N_f = 30 + 70 = 100$. The skewed sex ratio has reduced the effective size to $84\\%$ of the census size, which illustrates the impact of unequal parental contribution on the rate of genetic drift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{84}$$", "id": "2801288"}, {"introduction": "A primary consequence of genetic drift in a finite population is the steady loss of genetic variation.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Wright–Fisher model of genetic drift. It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($H_0$, $N_e$, $t$) and a clearly defined theoretical framework to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires the application of fundamental theory, thus it is not trivial. The verdict is that the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds from first principles as required. Let $H_t$ be the expected heterozygosity at generation $t$, defined as the probability that two alleles drawn at random from the population are not identical by descent (IBD). Let $F_t$ be the probability that two randomly drawn alleles are IBD. By definition, these probabilities are complementary:\n$$ H_t = 1 - F_t $$\nThe core task is to establish a recurrence relation for $H_t$ over one generation. We first derive the recurrence for $F_t$. In a diploid Wright–Fisher population of effective size $N_e$, there are $2N_e$ alleles in the gene pool at any generation. Consider two alleles drawn at random from the population at generation $t$. We trace their ancestry back to generation $t-1$.\n\nThere are two mutually exclusive possibilities for the origin of these two alleles:\n1.  They are copies of the *same* parental allele from generation $t-1$. The probability of picking one specific allele is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$, and the probability of picking a second allele that is a copy of that same parental allele is also $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. The probability that two randomly chosen alleles descend from the same single ancestral allele in the previous generation is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, they are IBD by definition. The probability contribution to $F_t$ from this path is $\\frac{1}{2N_e} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.\n\n2.  They are copies of *different* parental alleles from generation $t-1$. The probability for this event is the complement of the first case, which is $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. If the two alleles descend from different parental alleles, they are IBD at generation $t$ only if their respective parental alleles in generation $t-1$ were already IBD. The probability of this is, by definition, $F_{t-1}$. The probability contribution to $F_t$ from this path is $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1}$.\n\nSumming these two probabilities gives the recurrence relation for the probability of identity by descent:\n$$ F_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1} $$\nTo find the recurrence for heterozygosity, we substitute $F_t = 1 - H_t$ and $F_{t-1} = 1 - H_{t-1}$ into this equation:\n$$ 1 - H_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) (1 - H_{t-1}) $$\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$$ 1 - H_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + 1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e} - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ 1 - H_t = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\n$$ -H_t = - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\n$$ H_t = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\nThis recurrence relation shows that heterozygosity decays geometrically over generations due to genetic drift. The general solution for $H_t$ after $t$ generations, starting from an initial heterozygosity of $H_0$, is:\n$$ H_t = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\nThe problem provides the following values: $H_0 = 0.8$, $N_e = 250$, and $t = 20$.

Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of copies of allele $A$ among the $2N_b$ gene copies in the bottleneck generation.\n\nAs stated in the problem, under the Wright-Fisher assumptions, $X$ follows a binomial distribution. The parameters of this distribution are:\n1.  The number of independent trials, $n$, which is the total number of gene copies sampled. For a diploid population of size $N_b$, this is $n = 2N_b$.\n2.  The probability of success in a single trial, which is the probability of sampling an allele $A$. This is equal to the allele's frequency in the pre-bottleneck population, $p$.\n\nThus, the distribution of $X$ is given by $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$, where $n=2N_b$.

Mathematically, this corresponds to the event $X \\ge 1$.
