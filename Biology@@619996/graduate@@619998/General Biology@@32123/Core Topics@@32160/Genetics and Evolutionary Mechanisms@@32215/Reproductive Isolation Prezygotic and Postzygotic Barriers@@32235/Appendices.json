{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can quantify or model reproductive isolation, we must first learn to identify where in an organism's life cycle it acts. Speciation research often involves detective work, using experiments to pinpoint the specific stage—from mate choice to hybrid development—at which gene flow is interrupted. This practice hones your ability to interpret experimental outcomes, challenging you to distinguish between premating prezygotic, postmating prezygotic, and postzygotic barriers based on realistic, albeit hypothetical, data scenarios. Mastering this classificatory skill is foundational for any student of speciation [@problem_id:2833335].", "problem": "Two species pairs are studied to identify the stage(s) at which reproductive isolation acts. Use as foundational base the Biological Species Concept (BSC), which defines species by reproductive isolation, and the core classification that barriers can act before formation of a zygote (prezygotic) or after a zygote forms (postzygotic). Within prezygotic barriers, distinguish between those that prevent mating altogether (premating prezygotic) and those that occur after mating but before fertilization (postmating prezygotic). A zygote is considered to have formed once syngamy produces a diploid nucleus; any barrier that manifests only after this point is postzygotic. Evaluate the evidence below strictly by asking whether mating occurs, whether fertilization occurs, and whether hybrid development or fertility is compromised after a zygote forms.\n\nCase I (field crickets): In no-choice laboratory assays with $n = 60$ heterospecific pairs, copulation occurred in $70\\%$ of trials, and spermathecal dissections confirmed heterospecific sperm storage in $>95\\%$ of copulating females. Females laid a mean of $120$ eggs each (not different from conspecific matings; $P > 0.05$). However, cleavage was detected in $<1\\%$ of eggs. Fluorescent staining of egg envelopes showed no heterospecific sperm nuclei inside eggs, and conspecific controls processed in parallel showed $>90\\%$ fertilization. Mixed-mating assays in which a female first mated heterospecifically and then conspecifically yielded normal fertilization rates, indicating that female fecundity and egg quality were intact.\n\nCase II (sympatric frogs): In the field, male advertisement calls are largely nonoverlapping in diel timing, and female phonotaxis assays show approach to conspecific calls in $>90\\%$ of trials and to heterospecific calls in $<5\\%$ of trials ($n = 40$ per treatment). Heterospecific amplexus is rarely observed. When gametes are obtained by hormone-induced spawning and crossed in vitro, reciprocal heterospecific fertilizations yield normal cleavage, and $F_1$ tadpoles survive to adulthood with no apparent reduction in fertility relative to conspecifics in laboratory tests.\n\nCase III (Drosophila): In $n = 50$ no-choice heterospecific pairings, copulation occurred in $80\\%$ of trials. Eggs laid after heterospecific matings show normal fertilization envelopes and early cleavage, and karyotyping of early embryos confirms syngamy. Nevertheless, $F_1$ survival to adulthood is reduced to $40\\%$ of conspecific controls, and surviving $F_1$ males are sterile while $F_1$ females are partially fertile.

The experimental scenarios described (no-choice assays, phonotaxis tests, in vitro fertilization, hybrid analysis) are standard methodologies in evolutionary biology and speciation research. The data are biologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear definitions and sufficient data for each case to allow for a logical deduction. The question asks for the \"strongest\" isolating stage, which is a reasonable request in the context of speciation, where multiple barriers can exist but one often predominates. The data provided in each case clearly points to a primary barrier.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language (e.g., percentages, statistical significance, experimental outcomes). It is free of subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, allowing for a rigorous analysis. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option analysis\n\nThe analysis will proceed case by case, applying the provided definitions to the given evidence.\n\n**Analysis of Case I (field crickets):**\n1.  **Does mating occur?** Yes. The data state that \"copulation occurred in $70\\%$ of trials.\" This means a premating barrier is not the strongest isolating mechanism in this context.\n2.  **Does fertilization occur?** No. Despite successful copulation and sperm transfer (\">95\\% of copulating females\"), fertilization fails. \"Cleavage was detected in $<1\\%$ of eggs,\" and crucially, \"no heterospecific sperm nuclei [were found] inside eggs.\" This is a failure of gametes to fuse.\n3.  **Is the barrier prezygotic or postzygotic?** A zygote is defined as forming upon syngamy. Since syngamy (fusion of sperm and egg nuclei) does not occur, the barrier acts *before* zygote formation. Therefore, it is a prezygotic barrier.\n4.  **Is it premating or postmating?** Since mating has occurred, the barrier is, by definition, postmating. This specific mechanism, where gametes are incompatible and cannot fuse, is known as gametic isolation.\n**Conclusion for Case I:** The strongest isolating barrier is **postmating prezygotic**.\n\n**Analysis of Case II (sympatric frogs):**\n1.  **Does mating occur?** No, or very rarely. Several lines of evidence point to a powerful barrier preventing mating. First, temporal isolation is present: \"male advertisement calls are largely nonoverlapping in diel timing.\" Second, behavioral isolation (mate choice) is strong: females approach conspecific calls in $>90\\%$ of trials but heterospecific calls in $<5\\%$ of trials. Consequently, \"heterospecific amplexus is rarely observed.\"\n2.  **Does fertilization occur?** Yes, under artificial conditions. When this premating barrier is bypassed via in vitro fertilization, \"reciprocal heterospecific fertilizations yield normal cleavage.\"\n3.  **Is there a postzygotic barrier?** No. The problem states that \"$F_1$ tadpoles survive to adulthood with no apparent reduction in fertility.\" This demonstrates the absence of significant postzygotic isolation.\n4.  **What is the strongest barrier?** The evidence overwhelmingly points to barriers that prevent mating from occurring in the wild.\n**Conclusion for Case II:** The strongest isolating barrier is **premating prezygotic**.\n\n**Analysis of Case III (Drosophila):**\n1.  **Does mating occur?** Yes. \"copulation occurred in $80\\%$ of trials.\"\n2.  **Does fertilization occur?** Yes. \"Eggs ... show normal fertilization\" and \"karyotyping of early embryos confirms syngamy.\" The problem explicitly states that syngamy occurs, which, by the given definition, means a zygote has formed.\n3.  **Is there a postzygotic barrier?** Yes, and it is severe. After the zygote is formed, multiple problems arise. \"$F_1$ survival to adulthood is reduced to $40\\%$ of conspecific controls\" (hybrid inviability). \"Surviving $F_1$ males are sterile while $F_1$ females are partially fertile\" (hybrid sterility). Further inviability is noted in subsequent generations. These are classic examples of postzygotic barriers.\n**Conclusion for Case III:** The strongest isolating barrier is **postzygotic**.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n- Case I: Postmating prezygotic\n- Case II: Premating prezygotic\n- Case III: Postzygotic\n\nNow, each option will be evaluated against this derived conclusion.\n\n**A) Case I: premating prezygotic; Case II: postmating prezygotic; Case III: postzygotic**\n- Case I is incorrectly classified.

A zygote does not form.\n- Case II is correctly classified.\n- Case III is incorrectly classified. A fertile zygote forms, but the hybrid is inviable/sterile.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D) Case I: premating prezygotic; Case II: postzygotic; Case III: postmating prezygotic**\n- Case I is incorrectlyclassified. Mating occurs.\n- Case II is incorrectly classified. Hybrids are viable and fertile.\n- Case III is incorrectly classified. The barrier acts after zygote formation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly one option aligns with the logical analysis of the provided data according to the established principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2833335"}, {"introduction": "In nature, reproductive isolation is rarely an all-or-nothing phenomenon caused by a single barrier.

Mastering this calculation allows you to move from a simple list of barriers to a quantitative synthesis of their cumulative evolutionary impact.", "problem": "Two incipient species exhibit multiple barriers to gene flow acting sequentially across the life cycle. Use the following core definitions as the starting point: reproductive isolation is the proportional reduction in realized gene flow between populations relative to a baseline with no barriers; prezygotic barriers act before zygote formation to reduce mating or fertilization; postzygotic barriers act after zygote formation to reduce viability or fertility. When barriers act in sequence and are independent in their effects, the realized gene flow is given by the baseline gene flow multiplied by the fraction that passes each barrier in turn.\n\nConsider a cross between these two species with three measured barrier strengths: a prezygotic mating probability reduction of $0.4$ (interpreted as the proportional reduction in the probability that a mating occurs, relative to random mating), a postzygotic hybrid inviability of $0.3$ (interpreted as the proportional reduction in survival from zygote to reproductive adult, conditional on a mating occurring), and a postzygotic hybrid sterility of $0.5$ (interpreted as the proportional reduction in reproductive output of surviving hybrids, conditional on surviving to adulthood).

It is therefore deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the definitions provided. Let $G_{baseline}$ represent the maximal potential gene flow, which we can normalize to $1$. Let $G_{realized}$ be the realized gene flow after accounting for all reproductive barriers. According to the problem's definition, total reproductive isolation, $RI_{total}$, is the proportional reduction in gene flow:\n$$RI_{total} = \\frac{G_{baseline} - G_{realized}}{G_{baseline}}$$\nWith $G_{baseline} = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$RI_{total} = 1 - G_{realized}$$\nThe problem states that for sequential, independent barriers, the realized gene flow is the product of the fractions of gene flow that pass through each barrier. Let $F_i$ be the fraction that successfully passes through barrier $i$. The strength of a barrier, $B_i$, is given as the proportional *reduction*. Therefore, the fraction that passes is complementary to the reduction:\n$F_i = 1 - B_i$\nThe total realized gene flow is the product of the fractions passing through each of the three sequential barriers:\n$G_{realized} = F_{pre} \\times F_{inv} \\times F_{ste}$\nHere, $F_{pre}$ is the fraction of successful matings, $F_{inv}$ is the fraction of viable hybrids (conditional on mating), and $F_{ste}$ is the fraction of fertility retained by surviving hybrids (conditional on survival).\n\nUsing the given barrier strengths:\n- The prezygotic barrier strength is $B_{pre} = 0.4$. The fraction of gene flow passing this barrier is $F_{pre} = 1 - B_{pre} = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.\n- The postzygotic inviability barrier strength is $B_{inv} = 0.3$. The fraction of gene flow passing this barrier is $F_{inv} = 1 - B_{inv} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.\n- The postzygotic sterility barrier strength is $B_{ste} = 0.5$. The fraction of gene flow passing this barrier is $F_{ste} = 1 - B_{ste} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nNow, we calculate the total realized gene flow, $G_{realized}$:\n$$G_{realized} = (1 - B_{pre})(1 - B_{inv})(1 - B_{ste})$$\n$$G_{realized} = (0.6) \\times (0.7) \\times (0.5)$$\n$$G_{realized} = 0.42 \\times 0.5 = 0.21$$\nThis value, $0.21$, represents the fraction of potential gene flow that is realized between the two incipient species.\n\nFinally, we compute the total reproductive isolation, $RI_{total}$, using its definition:\n$$RI_{total} = 1 - G_{realized}$$\n$$RI_{total} = 1 - 0.21 = 0.79$$\nThe total reproductive isolation is the combined effect of all barriers, which in this case prevents $79\\%$ of the potential gene flow. The derived expression for total reproductive isolation based on the strengths of the individual barriers $B_i$ is $RI_{total} = 1 - \\prod_i (1 - B_i)$.

The Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (DMI) model provides an elegant and foundational framework for understanding how such negative genetic interactions can arise and contribute to speciation. In this problem, you will apply principles of Mendelian genetics and meiotic recombination to a classic two-locus DMI scenario, deriving the expected frequency of incompatible genotypes in a second-generation hybrid population [@problem_id:2833429]. This practice directly connects the observable phenomenon of hybrid failure to its underlying genetic architecture.", "problem": "In a two-locus Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (DMI) model of postzygotic isolation, consider two loci, denoted $A$ and $B$, each with an ancestral allele ($a$ and $b$) and a derived allele ($A$ and $B$). Lineage $1$ is fixed for the genotype $A A \\, b b$ and lineage $2$ is fixed for the genotype $a a \\, B B$. When these lineages hybridize, the first-generation hybrids ($F_1$) are all repulsion-phase double heterozygotes $A b / a B$. Assume a recombination fraction $r$ between the two loci with $0 \\le r \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}$, large random-mating population of $F_1$, and no selection or prezygotic barriers prior to zygote formation.\n\nAssume the incompatibility is dominant-by-dominant: a zygote expresses the DMI-induced postzygotic incompatibility if and only if it carries at least one $A$ allele and at least one $B$ allele.

It is scientifically grounded in the established Dobzhansky–Muller model of genetic incompatibility, is well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and is stated in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expected fraction of second-generation ($F_2$) zygotes that express a postzygotic incompatibility. This requires a three-step process: first, determining the gamete frequencies produced by the first-generation ($F_1$) hybrids; second, calculating the frequencies of different genotypes in the $F_2$ generation formed by random mating; and third, applying the given rule for incompatibility and its penetrance.\n\nStep 1: Gamete Frequencies from $F_1$ Hybrids\n\nThe parental lineages are $A A \\, b b$ and $a a \\, B B$. Their cross produces $F_1$ hybrids with the genotype $A a \\, B b$. The problem specifies that these are repulsion-phase double heterozygotes, written as $A b / a B$. This notation indicates that one chromosome carries the haplotype $A b$ and its homolog carries the haplotype $a B$.\n\nDuring meiosis in these $F_1$ individuals, gametes are formed. The recombination fraction between locus $A$ and locus $B$ is given as $r$, where $0 \\le r \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe parental, non-recombinant gametes are $A b$ and $a B$. The total frequency of non-recombinant events is $1-r$. Therefore, the frequencies of these two gamete types are:\n$$P(A b) = P(a B) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$$\nThe recombinant gametes are $A B$ and $a b$, formed by crossing-over between the loci. The total frequency of recombinant events is $r$. Therefore, the frequencies of these two gamete types are:\n$$P(A B) = P(a b) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\nThe sum of these frequencies is $\\frac{1-r}{2} + \\frac{1-r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} = (1-r) + r = 1$, as required.\n\nStep 2: $F_2$ Zygote Frequencies and Incompatibility Condition\n\nThe $F_2$ generation is formed by the random union of these gametes produced by the $F_1$ population. The DMI is expressed if a zygote carries at least one $A$ allele and at least one $B$ allele. This corresponds to genotypes of the form $A-B-$. The penetrance for such a genotype is $\\pi$. For all other genotypes ($A-b b$, $a a B-$, and $a a b b$), the penetrance is $0$.\n\nIt is more direct to first calculate the frequency of zygotes that do *not* satisfy the genetic condition for incompatibility. These are the \"compatible\" genotypes, which lack at least one of the required dominant alleles. A zygote is compatible if its genotype is $a a --$ (lacks allele $A$) or $--b b$ (lacks allele $B$).\n\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total frequency of compatible zygotes:\n$$P(\\text{compatible}) = P(aa--) + P(--bb) - P(aabb)$$\nTo calculate these frequencies, we first determine the allele frequencies in the $F_1$ gamete pool.\nThe frequency of the $a$ allele is $p_a = P(a B) + P(a b) = \\frac{1-r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe frequency of the $b$ allele is $p_b = P(A b) + P(a b) = \\frac{1-r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nUnder random mating, the frequency of $F_2$ zygotes with genotype $aa--$ is $(p_a)^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSimilarly, the frequency of $F_2$ zygotes with genotype $--bb$ is $(p_b)^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype $a a b b$ is the product of the frequencies of the $a b$ gamete from each parent:\n$$P(aabb) = P(ab) \\times P(ab) = \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{r^2}{4}$$\nNow, we substitute these frequencies into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n$$P(\\text{compatible}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{r^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{r^2}{4} = \\frac{2 - r^2}{4}$$\nThe frequency of genotypes that *are* genetically susceptible to the incompatibility ($A-B-$) is the complement of the compatible frequency:\n$$P(\\text{genetically susceptible}) = 1 - P(\\text{compatible}) = 1 - \\frac{2-r^2}{4} = \\frac{4 - (2-r^2)}{4} = \\frac{2+r^2}{4}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculating the Fraction of Expressed Incompatibility\n\nThe expected fraction of $F_2$ zygotes expressing the incompatibility is the product of the frequency of genetically susceptible genotypes and the penetrance $\\pi$.
