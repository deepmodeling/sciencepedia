It is a standard exercise in stochastic processes applied to evolutionary biology. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe evolution of the binary character along a single lineage is described by a symmetric $2$-state continuous-time Markov process. The states are {$0, 1$}. The instantaneous rate of change from state $i$ to state $j$ ($i \\neq j$) is given as $q$. The infinitesimal generator matrix, or rate matrix, $Q$, is therefore:\n$$\nQ = \\begin{pmatrix} -q & q \\\\ q & -q \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ over a time interval of length $t$ is given by the matrix entry $[P(t)]_{ij}$, where $P(t) = \\exp(Qt)$ is the transition probability matrix.\n\nTo compute $P(t)$, we can diagonalize $Q$ or use other methods for matrix exponentiation. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $Q$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(Q - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -q - \\lambda & q \\\\ q & -q - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-q - \\lambda)^2 - q^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $(\\lambda + q)^2 = q^2$, leading to $\\lambda + q = \\pm q$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2q$.\n\nThe transition matrix $P(t)$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nP(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{00}(t) & P_{01}(t) \\\\ P_{10}(t) & P_{11}(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $P_{ij}(t)$ is the probability of being in state $j$ at time $t$ given the process started in state $i$ at time $0$. For a symmetric $2$-state model, these probabilities are well-known:\n$$\nP_{01}(t) = P_{10}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2qt))\n$$\n$$\nP_{00}(t) = P_{11}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\exp(-2qt))\n$$\nLet us denote the two descendant lineages as lineage $A$ and lineage $B$.

This means $X_A(0) = 0$ and $X_B(0) = 0$.\nThe event of interest is defined as both terminal taxa having the derived state $1$ at the present time, $t$.

The task is to compute the minimum reconciliation cost and identify the gene nodes that are inferred as duplications in a most parsimonious reconciliation.\n\nFirst, we establish the given information in a formal context.\nThe species tree $S$ is a rooted binary tree with leaf set $\\mathcal{L}(S) = \\{A, B, C, D\\}$ and internal nodes $\\{s_0, s_1, s_2\\}$. The topology is specified by the parent-child relationships: $s_0$ is the parent of $s_1$ and $s_2$, $s_1$ is the parent of $A$ and $B$, and $s_2$ is the parent of $C$ and $D$. The root of $S$ is $s_0$.

Specifically, for a gene leaf $\\ell$, $M(\\ell) = \\sigma(\\ell)$, and for an internal gene node $v$ with children $u$ and $w$, $M(v)$ must be a species node that is an ancestor of both $M(u)$ and $M(w)$ (or equal to one of them). The most parsimonious reconciliation minimizes a total cost, which is the sum of duplications and losses.\n\nThe cost function is defined as follows. For an internal gene node $v$ with children $u$ and $w$:\n- $v$ is a speciation at $M(v)$ if $M(u)$ and $M(w)$ are in different child subtrees of $M(v)$. The cost incurred at $v$ is $0$ for the event plus $d_S(M(v),M(u)) + d_S(M(v),M(w)) - 2$ for losses.\n- $v$ is a duplication at $M(v)$ otherwise. The cost incurred at $v$ is $1$ for the event plus $d_S(M(v),M(u)) + d_S(M(v),M(w))$ for losses.\nHere, $d_S(x,y)$ is the edge distance from ancestor $x$ to descendant $y$ in $S$.\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we employ a dynamic programming algorithm. Let $C(v, s)$ be the minimum reconciliation cost for the gene subtree rooted at $v$, given that $v$ is mapped to species node $s$. We compute this bottom-up for all gene nodes $v$ and all valid species nodes $s$.\n\nThe species tree distances are: $d_S(s_0, s_1)=1$, $d_S(s_0, s_2)=1$, $d_S(s_1, A)=1$, $d_S(s_1, B)=1$, $d_S(s_2, C)=1$, $d_S(s_2, D)=1$. It follows that $d_S(s_0, A)=2$, $d_S(s_0, B)=2$, $d_S(s_0, C)=2$, $d_S(s_0, D)=2$.\n\nThe computation proceeds in a post-order traversal of the gene tree: $g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4$.\n\n1.  **Node $g_1$ (children $a_1, b_1$)**:\n    The species set is $\\{A, B\\}$, whose Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in $S$ is $s_1$.

Since $M(g_2)=s_2=M(g_3)$, this is a duplication. The cost is $1$ (duplication) plus losses $d_S(s_2, M(c_1)) + d_S(s_2, M(g_2)) = d_S(s_2, C) + d_S(s_2, s_2) = 1+0=1$. Added to this is the reconciliation cost of the children's subtrees: $C(c_1, C)=0$ and $C(g_2, s_2)=0$. Total cost $C(g_3, s_2) = (1+1)+0+0=2$.\n    -   If $M(g_3) = s_0$: Both $M(c_1)=C$ and the entire species set for $g_2$ are in the $s_2$ subtree of $s_0$. This must be a duplication.

This is a speciation event. The optimal child mappings are $M(g_1)=s_1$ and $M(g_3)=s_2$. The cost is the sum of the optimal costs for the children reconciled in those subtrees, plus any losses at the $g_4$ node.\n    -   Cost from $g_1$ branch: optimal cost is $C(g_1, s_1) = 0$. Losses on branch from $s_0$ to $s_1$: $d_S(s_0, s_1)-1=0$.\n    -   Cost from $g_3$ branch: optimal cost is $C(g_3, s_2)=2$.

This requires $M(g_1)=s_1$ and $M(g_3)=s_2$.\n-   The reconciliation of the $g_1$ subtree with cost $C(g_1,s_1)=0$ was achieved assuming $g_1$ is a **speciation**.\n-   The reconciliation of the $g_3$ subtree with cost $C(g_3,s_2)=2$ was achieved assuming $g_3$ is a **duplication**.\n-   The reconciliation of the $g_2$ subtree, which is part of the $g_3$ subtree calculation, assumes $M(g_2)=s_2$. The cost $C(g_2,s_2)=0$ corresponds to a **speciation** event at $g_2$.\n\nThe only duplication event in the most parsimonious reconciliation occurs at node $g_3$.\n\nThe minimal total cost is $2$.

From first principles, use the following base assumptions and definitions: (i) island area modulates extinction and habitat heterogeneity; (ii) isolation modulates immigration; (iii) logarithmic transformation maps multiplicative, scale-invariant power-laws to affine linear forms; and (iv) ordinary least squares minimizes the sum of squared residuals and yields closed-form estimators for affine linear models.\n\nDefine, for each island, $x = \\log_{10}(A)$ where $A$ is area in $\\mathrm{km}^2$, and $y = \\log_{10}(S)$ where $S$ is the species count (unitless).

The task is to estimate the slope parameter $z$ for specified subsets of island data.\n\nThe slope $z$ is estimated using the formula for the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for a simple linear regression, which is provided:\n$$\nz \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of islands in a given subset, $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the log-transformed area and species counts for island $i$, and $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are their respective sample means.\n\nThe solution methodology proceeds as follows for each of the three provided datasets:\n\n1.  **Data Partitioning**: The full set of islands in a dataset is partitioned into four overlapping subsets according to two criteria:\n    *   **Isolation**: An island is classified as \"near\" if its isolation distance $I \\leq 60 \\thinspace \\mathrm{km}$, and \"far\" if $I > 60 \\thinspace \\mathrm{km}$. This creates two subsets, one for near islands and one for far islands.\n    *   **Habitat Diversity**: An island is classified as having \"low\" diversity if its habitat index $H < 1.4$, and \"high\" diversity if $H \\geq 1.4$. This creates two further subsets.\n\n2.  **Slope Calculation**: For each of the four generated subsets—near ($z_{\\mathrm{near}}$), far ($z_{\\mathrm{far}}$), low diversity ($z_{\\mathrm{low}}$), and high diversity ($z_{\\mathrm{high}}$)—the slope parameter $z$ is computed. A computational function is designed to perform these steps systematically:\n    a.  For a given subset of islands, extract the area ($A$) and species richness ($S$) values.\n    b.  Apply the base-$10$ logarithmic transformation to obtain the vectors $x = \\log_{10}(A)$ and $y = \\log_{10}(S)$.\n    c.  Calculate the sample means $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$.\n    d.  Compute the numerator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})$, which is the sum of the products of deviations.\n    e.  Compute the denominator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, which is the sum of squared deviations for $x$.\n    f.  The slope $z$ is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator. The problem guarantees that subsets are structured to prevent a denominator of zero.\n\n3.  **Analysis and Formatting**: After computing the four slope values, the following quantities are derived:\n    *   The difference between far and near slopes: $z_{\\mathrm{far}} - z_{\\mathrm{near}}$.\n    *   The difference between high and low diversity slopes: $z_{\\mathrm{high}} - z_{\\mathrm{low}}$.\n    *   A boolean value indicating if the far slope is greater than the near slope: $(z_{\\mathrm{near}} < z_{\\mathrm{far}})$.\n    *   A boolean value indicating if the high-diversity slope is greater than the low-diversity slope: $(z_{\\mathrm{low}} < z_{\\mathrm{high}})$.\n\n    All computed slope and difference values are numerically rounded to three decimal places. The boolean values remain exact.\n\n4.  **Aggregation**: This process is repeated for all three datasets. The eight resulting values from each dataset—$[z_{\\mathrm{near}}, z_{\\mathrm{far}}, z_{\\mathrm{low}}, z_{\\mathrm{high}}, z_{\\mathrm{far}} - z_{\\mathrm{near}}, z_{\\mathrm{high}} - z_{\\mathrm{low}}, (z_{\\mathrm{near}} < z_{\\mathrm{far}}), (z_{\\mathrm{low}} < z_{\\mathrm{high}})]_k$ for dataset $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$—are concatenated in order to form a single output list of $24$ elements.
