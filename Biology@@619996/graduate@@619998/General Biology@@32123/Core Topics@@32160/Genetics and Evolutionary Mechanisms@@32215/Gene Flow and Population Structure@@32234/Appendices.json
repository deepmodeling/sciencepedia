Since the two subpopulations are of equal census size, the average frequency is the arithmetic mean of the individual subpopulation frequencies, $p_1$ and $p_2$:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $p_1 = 0.2$ and $p_2 = 0.8$:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.2 + 0.8}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nThe corresponding average frequency of allele $a$ is $\\bar{q} = 1 - \\bar{p} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected heterozygosity for the total population, $H_T$, under the hypothetical assumption that the subpopulations are pooled and mating occurs randomly (panmixia) across the entire metapopulation. In a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expected heterozygosity is given by $2\\bar{p}\\bar{q}$.\n$$\nH_T = 2\\bar{p}\\bar{q} = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.5\n$$\nThis value, $H_T$, represents the expected proportion of heterozygotes if the population structure were ignored.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected heterozygosity within each subpopulation. Mating is random within each subpopulation, so Hardy-Weinberg principles apply locally.\nFor subpopulation $1$, the frequency of allele $a$ is $q_1 = 1 - p_1 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$. The expected heterozygosity, $H_1$, is:\n$$\nH_1 = 2p_1q_1 = 2(0.2)(0.8) = 0.32\n$$\nFor subpopulation $2$, the frequency of allele $a$ is $q_2 = 1 - p_2 = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$. The expected heterozygosity, $H_2$, is:\n$$\nH_2 = 2p_2q_2 = 2(0.8)(0.2) = 0.32\n$$\nThe average expected heterozygosity within subpopulations, $H_S$, is the weighted average of the individual heterozygosities. Since the subpopulations are of equal size, this is the simple arithmetic mean of $H_1$ and $H_2$.\n$$\nH_S = \\frac{H_1 + H_2}{2} = \\frac{0.32 + 0.32}{2} = 0.32\n$$\nThis value, $H_S$, represents the actual average proportion of heterozygotes across the structured population.\n\nThe deficit in heterozygosity due to population subdivision (the Wahlund effect) is the difference $H_T - H_S$.\n$$\n\\text{Deficit} = H_T - H_S = 0.5 - 0.32 = 0.18\n$$\nThe problem asks for this deficit expressed as a fraction of the pooled expected heterozygosity, $H_T$. This is a measure of population differentiation, commonly known as the fixation index, $F_{ST}$.\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{H_T - H_S}{H_T}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{0.5 - 0.32}{0.5} = \\frac{0.18}{0.5} = 0.36\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The exact value is $0.36$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we write it as $0.3600$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3600}\n$$", "id": "2800679"}, {"introduction": "While our first exercise examined a static snapshot of population structure, the observed level of differentiation in nature is typically the result of a dynamic equilibrium.

It is scientifically grounded in the foundational principles of population genetics, employing the standard Wright–Fisher and island models. It is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary definitions and parameters to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem requires a standard, albeit non-trivial, derivation in theoretical population genetics.\n\nProceeding with the solution.\n\nLet $p_{i,t}$ be the frequency of an allele in deme $i$ at generation $t$. The among-deme variance at generation $t$ is defined as $V_t = E[(p_{i,t} - \\bar{p})^2]$, where the expectation $E[\\cdot]$ is taken over all demes.\n\nThe life cycle proceeds in two steps: migration followed by random mating and reproduction (genetic drift).\n\nFirst, consider the effect of migration. The allele frequency in deme $i$ after migration, denoted $p'_{i,t}$, is a weighted average of the local frequency and the metapopulation mean frequency:\n$$p'_{i,t} = (1-m)p_{i,t} + m\\bar{p}$$\n\nNext, the new generation is formed by sampling $2N$ gametes from this post-migration gene pool. This is the drift step. The allele frequency in deme $i$ at generation $t+1$, denoted $p_{i,t+1}$, is a random variable drawn from a binomial distribution with $2N$ trials and success probability $p'_{i,t}$. The conditional expectation and variance of $p_{i,t+1}$ given $p_{i,t}$ are:\n$$E[p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t}] = p'_{i,t}$$\n$$\\text{Var}[p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t}] = \\frac{p'_{i,t}(1-p'_{i,t})}{2N}$$\n\nWe seek a recursion for the among-deme variance, $V_{t+1} = \\text{Var}(p_{i,t+1})$. We use the law of total variance:\n$$V_{t+1} = \\text{Var}(p_{i,t+1}) = E[\\text{Var}(p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t})] + \\text{Var}(E[p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t}])$$\n\nLet us evaluate the two terms.\nThe second term is the variance of the conditional expectation:\n$$\\text{Var}(E[p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t}]) = \\text{Var}(p'_{i,t}) = \\text{Var}((1-m)p_{i,t} + m\\bar{p})$$\nSince $\\bar{p}$ and $m$ are constants, this simplifies to:\n$$\\text{Var}(p'_{i,t}) = (1-m)^2 \\text{Var}(p_{i,t}) = (1-m)^2 V_t$$\n\nThe first term is the expectation of the conditional variance:\n$$E[\\text{Var}(p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t})] = E\\left[\\frac{p'_{i,t}(1-p'_{i,t})}{2N}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2N} E[p'_{i,t} - (p'_{i,t})^2]$$\nWe need to find $E[p'_{i,t}]$ and $E[(p'_{i,t})^2]$.\n$$E[p'_{i,t}] = E[(1-m)p_{i,t} + m\\bar{p}] = (1-m)E[p_{i,t}] + m\\bar{p} = (1-m)\\bar{p} + m\\bar{p} = \\bar{p}$$\nThe variance of $p'_{i,t}$ is related to its second moment: $\\text{Var}(p'_{i,t}) = E[(p'_{i,t})^2] - (E[p'_{i,t}])^2$.\nThus, $E[(p'_{i,t})^2] = \\text{Var}(p'_{i,t}) + (E[p'_{i,t}])^2 = (1-m)^2 V_t + \\bar{p}^2$.\nSubstituting back into the expression for the expected conditional variance:\n$$E[\\text{Var}(p_{i,t+1} | p_{i,t})] = \\frac{1}{2N} \\left( \\bar{p} - \\left[ (1-m)^2 V_t + \\bar{p}^2 \\right] \\right) = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) - (1-m)^2 V_t}{2N}$$\n\nCombining the two terms gives the recursion for $V_t$:\n$$V_{t+1} = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) - (1-m)^2 V_t}{2N} + (1-m)^2 V_t$$\n$$V_{t+1} = (1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) V_t + \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N}$$\n\nAt equilibrium, the variance is constant, so $V_{t+1} = V_t = V$.\n$$V = (1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) V + \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N}$$\nRearranging to solve for $V$:\n$$V \\left[1 - (1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N}$$\n\nWe are asked for an expression for $F_{ST} = V / (\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}))$. Dividing by $\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})$:\n$$F_{ST} \\left[1 - (1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{1}{2N}$$\nThis gives an exact expression for $F_{ST}$. However, it is standard practice to use an approximation for small migration rates ($m \\ll 1$) and large deme sizes ($1/N \\ll 1$).\nLet us expand the term in brackets, keeping terms to first order in $m$ and $1/N$:\n$$(1-m)^2 \\approx 1-2m$$\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2N}$$\n$$(1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) \\approx (1-2m)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) = 1 - 2m - \\frac{1}{2N} + \\frac{2m}{2N}$$\nThe term $2m/(2N) = m/N$ is of second order and will be neglected.\nSo, $(1-m)^2 (1 - 1/(2N)) \\approx 1 - 2m - 1/(2N)$.\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium equation for $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} \\left[1 - \\left(1 - 2m - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)\\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{2N}$$\n$$F_{ST} \\left(2m + \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{2N}$$\nSolving for $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1/(2N)}{2m + 1/(2N)} = \\frac{1}{4Nm + 1}$$\nThis is the classic closed-form expression for $F_{ST}$ under the island model.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $N=500$ and $m=0.002$.\nThe crucial parameter is the number of migrants per generation, $Nm$.\n$$Nm = 500 \\times 0.002 = 1$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{4(1) + 1} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.200$.\n\nFinally, the interpretation of this value. The Fixation Index, $F_{ST}$, quantifies the proportion of total genetic variance that is partitioned among subpopulations (demes). An $F_{ST}$ value of $0.200$ signifies that approximately $20\\%$ of the total allele frequency variance in the metapopulation is due to differences in allele frequencies among the demes. Correspondingly, the remaining $80\\%$ of the variance is found as genetic variation within the individual demes. This value indicates a moderate level of genetic differentiation. Migration is occurring at a rate ($Nm=1$) that is not sufficient to completely homogenize the demes, allowing genetic drift to create and maintain significant allele frequency differences among them.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.200}$$", "id": "2800646"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical principles of population structure have powerful real-world applications, particularly in fields like conservation biology and wildlife forensics.
