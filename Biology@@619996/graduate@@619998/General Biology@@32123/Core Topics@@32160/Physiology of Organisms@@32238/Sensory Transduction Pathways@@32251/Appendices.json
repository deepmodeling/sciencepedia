It is stated in a precise mathematical and biophysical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\nNo flaws from the checklist are present. The problem is a standard exercise in biophysical modeling and does not violate any principles of scientific or logical integrity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete and reasoned solution follows.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the new steady-state receptor potential after a stimulus has increased a single conductance, $g_s$. Let the baseline potential be $V_0$ and the new potential after the stimulus be $V_1$. The problem statement uses the variable $V$ for this new potential, which we will adopt in the final answer.\n\nThe steady-state condition is that the net current across the membrane is zero, $I_{\\text{net}} = 0$. The general expression for the net current is given as $I_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i \\big(V - E_i\\big)$.\n\nAfter the stimulus, the conductance for the specific channel class $s$ becomes $g_s + \\Delta g$. All other conductances $g_i$ (where $i \\neq s$) and all reversal potentials $E_i$ remain unchanged. The new steady-state potential, $V_1$, must satisfy the current-balance equation with the new set of conductances.\n\nThe new steady-state equation is:\n$$ \\sum_{i \\neq s} g_i (V_1 - E_i) + (g_s + \\Delta g)(V_1 - E_s) = 0 $$\nOur objective is to solve this equation for $V_1$. We expand the terms:\n$$ \\sum_{i \\neq s} g_i V_1 - \\sum_{i \\neq s} g_i E_i + g_s V_1 + \\Delta g V_1 - g_s E_s - \\Delta g E_s = 0 $$\nWe can combine the sums. The term $\\sum_{i \\neq s} g_i V_1 + g_s V_1$ is equivalent to $\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i\\right) V_1$. Similarly, $\\sum_{i \\neq s} g_i E_i + g_s E_s$ is equivalent to $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i$. Substituting these back into the equation gives:\n$$ \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i\\right) V_1 + \\Delta g V_1 - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i\\right) - \\Delta g E_s = 0 $$\nNow, we group all terms containing $V_1$ on one side of the equation and all other terms on the other side:\n$$ V_1 \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\Delta g \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i + \\Delta g E_s $$\nFinally, we isolate $V_1$ by dividing by the term in the parenthesis. This is permissible because we are given that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i > 0$ and $\\Delta g > 0$, so the denominator is strictly positive and non-zero.\n$$ V_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i + \\Delta g E_s}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\Delta g} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the new steady-state receptor potential.\n\nNext, we must determine the conditions under which this change constitutes a depolarization or a hyperpolarization. We assume the standard neurophysiological convention where depolarization is an increase in membrane potential ($V_1 > V_0$) and hyperpolarization is a decrease ($V_1 < V_0$). We must find the change in potential, $\\Delta V = V_1 - V_0$.\n\nFirst, we find the baseline potential, $V_0$, by applying the steady-state condition to the initial set of conductances $\\{g_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i (V_0 - E_i) = 0 $$\n$$ V_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i = 0 $$\n$$ V_0 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i} $$\nNow we compute $\\Delta V = V_1 - V_0$:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i + \\Delta g E_s}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\Delta g} - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i} $$\nLet $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i$ and $G = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{S + \\Delta g E_s}{G + \\Delta g} - \\frac{S}{G} $$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $G(G + \\Delta g)$:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{G(S + \\Delta g E_s) - S(G + \\Delta g)}{G(G + \\Delta g)} $$\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{GS + G \\Delta g E_s - SG - S \\Delta g}{G(G + \\Delta g)} $$\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{G \\Delta g E_s - S \\Delta g}{G(G + \\Delta g)} = \\frac{\\Delta g (G E_s - S)}{G(G + \\Delta g)} $$\nThe sign of $\\Delta V$ determines the nature of the potential change. We analyze the sign of the numerator and denominator.\n- Denominator: $G = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i > 0$ and $\\Delta g > 0$ are given. Thus, $G(G + \\Delta g) > 0$.\n- Numerator: $\\Delta g > 0$ is given. The sign of the numerator is therefore determined by the sign of the term $(G E_s - S)$.\nSubstituting the definitions of $G$ and $S$ back gives:\n$$ G E_s - S = E_s \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i\\right) $$\nDividing this term by $G = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i$ (which is positive and does not change the sign) simplifies the analysis:\n$$ \\frac{G E_s - S}{G} = E_s - \\frac{S}{G} = E_s - V_0 $$\nTherefore, the sign of $\\Delta V$ is identical to the sign of $(E_s - V_0)$.\n\nThe conditions are as follows:\n- **Depolarization** ($\\Delta V > 0$): This occurs when $E_s - V_0 > 0$, which is equivalent to $E_s > V_0$. If the reversal potential of the activated channel is more positive than the initial membrane potential, the cell will depolarize.\n- **Hyperpolarization** ($\\Delta V < 0$): This occurs when $E_s - V_0 < 0$, which is equivalent to $E_s < V_0$. If the reversal potential of the activated channel is more negative than the initial membrane potential, the cell will hyperpolarize.\n- **No change** ($\\Delta V = 0$): This occurs when $E_s - V_0 = 0$, which is equivalent to $E_s = V_0$. If the reversal potential of the activated channel is exactly equal to the membrane potential, there is no net driving force for that ion, and opening the channel causes no change in potential. This is, by definition, the reversal potential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i E_i + \\Delta g E_s}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\Delta g}}\n$$", "id": "2836286"}, {"introduction": "Many sensory pathways, particularly in olfaction and gustation, begin with the binding of a stimulus molecule to a receptor protein.

The problem provides all necessary data for a unique solution ($EC_{50}$, $[I]$, and $K_i$). There are no internal contradictions; the crucial link is that with no spare receptors, the half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$) is equivalent to the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_A$) of the agonist. The problem violates none of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe system involves three chemical species in equilibrium with the receptor, $R$: the free receptor, the agonist-bound receptor, $RA$, and the antagonist-bound receptor, $RI$. The total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is constant. The binding reactions are governed by the law of mass action.\n\nThe equilibrium for the agonist $A$ binding to the receptor $R$ is:\n$$ R + A \\rightleftharpoons RA $$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_A$, is defined as:\n$$ K_A = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]} $$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors and $[A]$ is the concentration of the agonist.\n\nThe equilibrium for the competitive antagonist $I$ binding to the receptor $R$ is:\n$$ R + I \\rightleftharpoons RI $$\nThe inhibition constant, $K_i$, is defined as:\n$$ K_i = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]} $$\nwhere $[I]$ is the concentration of the antagonist.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of all receptor states:\n$$ [R_T] = [R] + [RA] + [RI] $$\nThe problem states that the response is proportional to the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist.

The parameter $\\alpha$ is given in units of $\\text{M}^{-1}$, so the concentrations must be converted from nanomolar ($10^{-9}\\,\\text{M}$) to molar ($M$).\n\nThe initial concentration is $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{1} = 100\\,\\text{nM} = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{M}$.\nThe final concentration is $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{2} = 500\\,\\text{nM} = 500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{M} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{M}$.\nThe parameter is $\\alpha = 5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless products $\\alpha[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$:\nFor the initial concentration:\n$$\n\\alpha [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{1} = (5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{M}) = 0.5\n$$\nFor the final concentration:\n$$\n\\alpha [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{2} = (5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{M}) = 2.5\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio expression:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{o}(500\\,\\text{nM})}{P_{o}(100\\,\\text{nM})} = \\frac{1 + 0.5}{1 + 2.5} = \\frac{1.5}{3.5}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{15}{35} = \\frac{3}{7}$. To provide the answer as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4285714...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $0.4286$. This is the steady-state fold-change in open probability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4286}$$", "id": "2836385"}]}
