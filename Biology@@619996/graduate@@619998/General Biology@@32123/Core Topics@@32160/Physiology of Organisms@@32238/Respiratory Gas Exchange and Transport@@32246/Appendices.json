It is a standard problem in quantitative physiology. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to calculate three quantities related to oxygen transport in arterial blood and then a final ratio. We will address each component in a logical sequence, deriving them from the first principles specified.\n\nFirst, we calculate the content of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma, which we denote as $C_{dissolved, O_2}$. According to Henry's law, the concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure. The proportionality constant is the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha_{O_2}$. The given values are the partial pressure of arterial oxygen, $P_{a O_2} = 100 \\text{ mmHg}$, and the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha_{O_2} = 0.003 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL/mmHg}$.\n\nThe formula is therefore:\n$$C_{dissolved, O_2} = \\alpha_{O_2} \\times P_{a O_2}$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$C_{dissolved, O_2} = (0.003) \\times (100) = 0.3 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\nThis quantity represents the amount of oxygen carried in each deciliter of blood purely in physical solution.\n\nSecond, we calculate the content of oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin, denoted as $C_{bound, O_2}$. The problem states this is the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $[Hb]$, its specific oxygen-binding capacity at full saturation, which we will call $O_2\\text{Cap}_{Hb}$, and the fractional oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, $S_{a O_2}$. The given values are $[Hb] = 15 \\text{ g/dL}$, $O_2\\text{Cap}_{Hb} = 1.34 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}$, and $S_{a O_2} = 0.97$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$C_{bound, O_2} = [Hb] \\times O_2\\text{Cap}_{Hb} \\times S_{a O_2}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$C_{bound, O_2} = (15) \\times (1.34) \\times (0.97)$$\nFirst, we find the maximum amount of oxygen that can be bound if hemoglobin were fully saturated:\n$$(15 \\text{ g/dL}) \\times (1.34 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}) = 20.1 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\nThis is the total oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin in this blood sample. Since the hemoglobin is only $97\\%$ saturated, the actual amount of bound oxygen is:\n$$C_{bound, O_2} = (20.1) \\times (0.97) = 19.497 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\nThird, we find the total arterial oxygen content, $C_{a O_2}$, which is the sum of the dissolved and hemoglobin-bound components.\n$$C_{a O_2} = C_{dissolved, O_2} + C_{bound, O_2}$$\n$$C_{a O_2} = 0.3 + 19.497 = 19.797 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the fraction $f$ of the total arterial oxygen content that is physically dissolved in plasma. This is the ratio of the dissolved oxygen content to the total oxygen content.\n$$f = \\frac{C_{dissolved, O_2}}{C_{a O_2}}$$\nUsing our calculated values:\n$$f = \\frac{0.3}{19.797} \\approx 0.015153811$$\nThe problem requires this value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$f \\approx 0.01515$$\n\nThe explanation for why the dissolved component is considered negligible relative to the hemoglobin-bound component is now quantitatively obvious. The amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin ($19.497 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$) is approximately $65$ times greater than the amount physically dissolved in plasma ($0.3 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$). The fraction $f \\approx 0.01515$ corresponds to only about $1.5\\%$ of the total oxygen carried. This vast difference underscores the biological necessity of a specialized oxygen transport molecule like hemoglobin. The low solubility of oxygen gas in an aqueous medium like blood plasma is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body's tissues. While the dissolved fraction is small, it is not physiologically irrelevant. It is the dissolved oxygen that exerts a partial pressure, $P_{O_2}$, which creates the gradient for gas diffusion across membranes and determines the loading state of hemoglobin according to the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Thus, the dissolved pool is in dynamic equilibrium with the much larger hemoglobin-bound pool, acting as the immediate source and sink for oxygen exchange.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01515}$$", "id": "2833942"}, {"introduction": "Beyond oxygen delivery, respiratory gas exchange plays a critical role in systemic acid-base homeostasis through the transport and elimination of carbon dioxide.

The problem is a standard, formalizable, and non-trivial application of chemical principles to biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed to solve it.\n\nThe computation of plasma pH is governed by the equilibrium of the bicarbonate buffer system. The overall reaction, which combines the hydration of aqueous carbon dioxide and the subsequent dissociation of carbonic acid, is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}_{2} (\\text{dissolved}) + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\n$$\nThe problem provides an *effective* acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, which simplifies this two-step process by directly relating the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide, $[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}]_{\\text{dissolved}}$, to the equilibrium products. The definition of this effective constant is:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}]_{\\text{dissolved}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that activity coefficients are unity, allowing us to use molar concentrations directly.\n\nThe concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide is not measured directly but is determined by its partial pressure in the plasma, $\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, according to Henry's Law. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}]_{\\text{dissolved}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the solubility coefficient.\n\nBy substituting the expression from Henry's Law into the equilibrium equation, we obtain a comprehensive relation:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}}\n$$\nTo find the pH, we must first solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = K_{a} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}}{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}\n$$\nThe pH is defined as the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity, which is approximated by its concentration:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10} \\left( K_{a} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}}{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can separate the terms:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}) - \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}}{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]} \\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$ and inverting the ratio inside the second logarithm, we arrive at the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = pK_{a} + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation correctly relates the plasma pH to the ratio of the metabolic component, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$, and the respiratory component, represented by $\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$.\n\nFor the reference state ($\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2} = 40.0 \\text{ mmHg}$, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 24.0 \\text{ mmol L}^{-1}$), the ratio $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] / (\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\times \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2})$ is $24.0 / (0.030 \\times 40.0) = 24.0 / 1.2 = 20$. The corresponding pH is $6.1 + \\log_{10}(20) \\approx 7.4$, the normal physiological pH.\n\nIn the patient's case, $\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is elevated to $55.0 \\text{ mmHg}$ from the reference of $40.0 \\text{ mmHg}$, indicating a retention of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

Simultaneously, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$ is reduced to $14.0 \\text{ mmol L}^{-1}$ from the reference of $24.0 \\text{ mmol L}^{-1}$, indicating a primary loss of bicarbonate or gain of non-volatile acid. This is a metabolic acidosis. The patient's state is therefore a combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
