The internode behaves approximately according to the linear cable equation, which at early times after a brief nodal spike is dominated by diffusive spread of voltage with an effective diffusion coefficient $D = \\lambda^{2}/\\tau_{m}$. The next node at center-to-center distance $L$ initiates an action potential when its membrane reaches threshold following the arrival of the passively spread depolarization. During each hop, there is also a fixed nodal regeneration delay $t_{n}$ due to voltage-gated channel activation at the node itself.\n\nStarting from these fundamentals and the dimensional consequence of the cable equation’s early-time Green’s function (which implies that the earliest threshold-crossing time scales with distance as $t_{\\mathrm{diff}}(L) \\propto L^{2}/D$), consider the following phenomenological representation for the earliest threshold-crossing time during passive spread:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{diff}}(L) \\;=\\; \\kappa \\,\\frac{L^{2}}{D},\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a dimensionless constant (set by how far threshold is below the peak of the nodal depolarization and by the effective filtering by the myelinated internode) that has been calibrated in a comparable preparation.\n\nAssume the time per hop is $T(L) = t_{n} + t_{\\mathrm{diff}}(L)$, and the average conduction velocity across many internodes is $v(L) = L/T(L)$.

The mathematical formulation, including the diffusive approximation for early-time voltage spread, is a legitimate and recognized simplification. The provided parameters are within a physiologically plausible range for large myelinated fibers. The problem is a valid application of these principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks to find the value of a parameter, $L$, that maximizes a well-defined mathematical function, $v(L)$. This is a standard optimization task in calculus. All necessary information is provided, and a unique, stable solution is expected to exist.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unambiguous scientific language, free of subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the internodal distance $L^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the average conduction velocity $v(L)$. The velocity is defined as:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{L}{T(L)}\n$$\nFirst, we construct the explicit expression for $T(L)$ by substituting the given relations:\n$$\nT(L) = t_{n} + t_{\\mathrm{diff}}(L) = t_{n} + \\kappa \\frac{L^{2}}{D}\n$$\nThus, the velocity function is:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{L}{t_{n} + \\kappa \\frac{L^{2}}{D}}\n$$\nTo find the value of $L$ that maximizes $v(L)$, we can equivalently find the value of $L$ that minimizes its reciprocal, the time taken to conduct over a unit distance, which we can denote as $f(L) = 1/v(L) = T(L)/L$. This approach simplifies the differentiation.\n$$\nf(L) = \\frac{T(L)}{L} = \\frac{t_{n} + \\kappa \\frac{L^{2}}{D}}{L} = \\frac{t_{n}}{L} + \\frac{\\kappa L}{D}\n$$\nTo find the extremum, we compute the first derivative of $f(L)$ with respect to $L$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dL} = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left( t_{n}L^{-1} + \\frac{\\kappa}{D}L \\right) = -t_{n}L^{-2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{D}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the optimal length, which we denote as $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{n}}{(L^{\\ast})^{2}} + \\frac{\\kappa}{D} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{D} = \\frac{t_{n}}{(L^{\\ast})^{2}}\n$$\nSolving for $(L^{\\ast})^{2}$:\n$$\n(L^{\\ast})^{2} = \\frac{t_{n}D}{\\kappa}\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{t_{n}D}{\\kappa}}\n$$\nSince $L$ must be a positive length, we only consider the positive root. To verify that this is a minimum for $f(L)$ (and thus a maximum for $v(L)$), we check the sign of the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}f}{dL^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left( -t_{n}L^{-2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{D} \\right) = 2t_{n}L^{-3} = \\frac{2t_{n}}{L^{3}}\n$$\nSince the nodal delay $t_{n}$ and the length $L$ are both physically positive quantities, $\\frac{d^{2}f}{dL^{2}} > 0$. This confirms that $L^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a minimum of $f(L)$ and therefore a maximum of $v(L)$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for the effective diffusion coefficient, $D = \\lambda^{2}/\\tau_{m}$, into the equation for $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{t_{n}}{\\kappa} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{\\tau_{m}} \\right)} = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{t_{n}}{\\kappa \\tau_{m}}}\n$$\nThis is the general symbolic solution for the optimal internodal distance.\n\nNext, we substitute the provided numerical values to compute the specific value of $L^{\\ast}$:\n- $\\lambda = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $t_{n} = 0.040\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $\\kappa = 0.50$\n- $\\tau_{m} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = (2.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.040\\,\\mathrm{ms}}{0.50 \\times 0.25\\,\\mathrm{ms}}}\n$$\nThe units of time ($\\mathrm{ms}$) inside the square root cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity, so the unit of $L^{\\ast}$ will be that of $\\lambda$, which is $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2.2 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.040}{0.125}}\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2.2 \\times \\sqrt{0.32}\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} \\approx 2.2 \\times 0.5656854\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} \\approx 1.2445079\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and rounded to four significant figures.

I will first validate the problem statement by analyzing the presented clinical information for scientific consistency and completeness.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following clinical findings for a $58$-year-old right-handed patient:\n- **Onset:** Abrupt-onset difficulty moving the right arm and leg.\n- **Motor Examination (Limbs):**\n    - Increased tone in the right upper and lower limbs.\n    - Brisk deep tendon reflexes on the right.\n    - Extensor plantar response on the right (positive Babinski sign).\n- **Sensory Examination:**\n    - Light touch and pinprick sensation are intact throughout.\n    - Vibration sense and joint position sense (proprioception) are diminished in the right fingers and toes.\n- **Cranial Nerve Examination:**\n    - Facial strength is symmetric, including upper and lower face.\n    - Extraocular movements are normal.\n    - Palate elevation is normal.\n    - Tongue deviates to the left on protrusion.\n    - Atrophy and fasciculations are visible on the left hemitongue.\n- **Cerebellar Examination:**\n    - No limb ataxia.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nI shall now analyze these findings based on established principles of neuroanatomy and clinical neurology.\n\n1.  **Motor Deficits:** The combination of increased tone (spasticity), hyperreflexia, and an extensor plantar response in the right limbs constitutes a classic presentation of an **upper motor neuron (UMN)** lesion. Since motor pathways, specifically the corticospinal tract, decussate (cross over) in the caudal medulla, a lesion causing right-sided symptoms must be located on the **left side** of the central nervous system, superior to the pyramidal decussation.\n\n2.  **Sensory Deficits:** The patient exhibits a dissociated sensory loss. The pathways for pain and temperature (spinothalamic tracts) are spared, while the pathways for vibration and proprioception (dorsal column-medial lemniscus system) are affected. The fibers of the dorsal columns synapse in the gracile and cuneate nuclei in the medulla and then decussate as internal arcuate fibers to form the contralateral medial lemniscus. Therefore, a deficit in vibration and proprioception on the right side of the body points to a lesion of the **left medial lemniscus**.\n\n3.  **Cranial Nerve Deficits:** The tongue findings—deviation to the left, with atrophy and fasciculations—are pathognomonic for a **lower motor neuron (LMN)** lesion of the **left hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)**. The genuineness of an LMN lesion is confirmed by the presence of atrophy and fasciculations. The genioglossus muscle, responsible for tongue protrusion, pushes the tongue forward. When the left genioglossus is weak, the unopposed action of the right genioglossus pushes the tongue towards the weak (left) side. Therefore, the lesion affects the left hypoglossal nucleus or its exiting nerve fascicles.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of Findings:** The problem requires a single lesion to explain:\n    - Left UMN pathway lesion (causing right-sided limb signs).\n    - Left medial lemniscus lesion (causing right-sided vibration/proprioception loss).\n    - Left CN XII LMN lesion (causing left-sided tongue signs).\n\nAll three of these structures—the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nucleus/nerve rootlets—are located in close proximity within the **medial portion of the medulla oblongata**. The combination of contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral loss of dorsal column sensation, and ipsilateral tongue paralysis constitutes the well-documented clinical entity known as **Medial Medullary Syndrome** (or Dejerine's syndrome).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded, and describes a classic neurological syndrome. No scientific principles are violated. The set of signs and symptoms is not contradictory and points to a specific, localizable lesion. The problem is well-posed and valid for analysis. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe clinical presentation must be explained by a single, focal lesion. We must find a location where the pyramidal tract, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nerve/nucleus are simultaneously affected.\n\n1.  **Right-sided UMN signs (hemiparesis):** This is caused by a lesion of the left corticospinal tract. In the brainstem, this tract runs in the cerebral peduncle (midbrain), basis pontis (pons), and pyramid (medulla).\n2.  **Right-sided loss of vibration and joint position sense:** This is caused by a lesion of the left medial lemniscus. This pathway is formed after the decussation of sensory fibers from the nucleus gracilis and cuneatus in the medulla and ascends medially through the brainstem.\n3.  **Left-sided LMN tongue paralysis:** This is caused by a lesion of the left hypoglossal nucleus or the intramedullary fascicles of the left hypoglossal nerve (CN XII). The hypoglossal nucleus is located in the dorsal part of the medial medulla, near the midline.\n\nThe only anatomical location where these three structures are adjacent is the **left medial medulla**. A lesion here would damage:\n- The **left pyramid**, containing the corticospinal tract before its decussation, causing contralateral (right) UMN paralysis.\n- The **left medial lemniscus**, carrying sensory information from the contralateral (right) side of the body.\n- The **left hypoglossal nucleus** or its exiting nerve fibers, causing ipsilateral (left) LMN paralysis of the tongue.\n\nThis syndrome is most commonly caused by an ischemic stroke resulting from occlusion of the paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery or the vertebral artery, which supply this region.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Left medial medulla in the territory of the anterior spinal artery**\nThis option localizes the lesion to the left medial medulla. As demonstrated above, a lesion in this precise location perfectly explains the triad of contralateral hemiparesis (pyramidal tract), contralateral loss of dorsal column sensation (medial lemniscus), and ipsilateral tongue paralysis (hypoglossal nucleus/nerve). The vascular territory is also correctly identified.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n- **B. Right lateral medulla in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)**\nThis describes Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenberg's syndrome) on the right side. This would produce vertigo and nystagmus (vestibular nuclei), dysphagia and hoarseness (nucleus ambiguus), ipsilateral ataxia (inferior cerebellar peduncle), ipsilateral facial sensory loss (spinal trigeminal nucleus), and contralateral body pain/temperature loss (spinothalamic tract). The patient's symptoms are completely inconsistent with this diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **C. Left posterior limb of the internal capsule**\nA lesion in the left internal capsule would cause right-sided hemiparesis and right-sided hemisensory loss. However, the sensory loss would typically affect all modalities (not sparing pain and temperature), and any cranial nerve involvement would be of the UMN type (e.g., contralateral lower facial weakness, contralateral tongue deviation *without* atrophy or fasciculations). The patient's dissociated sensory loss and LMN signs for the hypoglossal nerve rule out a lesion in the internal capsule.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **D. Right hemisection of the cervical spinal cord at approximately $C5$**\nThis describes a Brown-Séquard syndrome on the right side. It would cause ipsilateral (right) paralysis and loss of vibration/proprioception below the lesion, and contralateral (left) loss of pain and temperature. This is inconsistent with the patient's pattern of deficits (motor and DCML loss are on the same side, while pain/temperature is intact bilaterally). Most importantly, a spinal cord lesion cannot affect any cranial nerves, including the hypoglossal nerve.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **E. Left peripheral hypoglossal nerve lesion distal to the brainstem**\nAn isolated lesion of the left hypoglossal nerve would explain the tongue findings (left LMN paralysis). However, it would not explain any of the other findings, namely the right-sided hemiparesis and the right-sided loss of vibration and proprioception. The principle of parsimony requires us to find a single lesion to explain the entire clinical picture.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2784146"}]}
