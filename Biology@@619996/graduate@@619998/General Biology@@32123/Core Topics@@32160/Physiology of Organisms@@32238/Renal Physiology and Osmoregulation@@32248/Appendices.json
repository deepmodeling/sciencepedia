It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physiology, specifically osmoregulation, and is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of data and idealized assumptions to allow for a unique, meaningful solution. The problem requires a derivation from first principles, which is a standard and rigorous method in science.\n\nThe solution relies on the fundamental principle of conservation of mass, applied separately to the total amount of osmotically active solutes (osmoles) and the total amount of water in the body. The final equilibrium osmolality of the body fluids is the ratio of the total final osmoles to the total final mass of body water. The problem's assumptions frame this as a closed system regarding solutes and water over the period of equilibration.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state of the system.\nThe patient's mass is given as $M = 70$ kg.\nThe total body water (TBW) is stated to be a fraction $f_{TBW} = 0.6$ of the body mass.\nTherefore, the initial mass of total body water, $W_{TBW, i}$, is:\n$$W_{TBW, i} = M \\times f_{TBW} = 70 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.6 = 42 \\text{ kg}$$\nThe problem simplifies units by treating the density of body water as $1.00$ kg/L, so the volume in liters is numerically equal to the mass in kilograms.\n\nThe initial plasma osmolality, $P_{osm, i}$, is $285$ mOsm/kg. At equilibrium, this osmolality is uniform throughout the TBW.\nThe total number of osmoles in the body initially, $Osm_{total, i}$, is the product of the initial osmolality and the initial mass of body water:\n$$Osm_{total, i} = P_{osm, i} \\times W_{TBW, i} = 285 \\text{ mOsm/kg} \\times 42 \\text{ kg} = 11970 \\text{ mOsm}$$\n\nNext, we account for the substances added via the intravenous infusion.\nThe patient receives $V_{inf} = 1$ L of a $3\\%$ sodium chloride solution with a stated osmolality of $C_{inf} = 1026$ mOsm/L.\nAccording to assumption (v), this $1$ L of solution adds a mass of $W_{added} = 1$ kg of water to the TBW.\nThe number of osmoles added to the system, $Osm_{added}$, is calculated from the volume and concentration of the infusate. Given that the volume of the solution is $1$ L, the osmoles added are:\n$$Osm_{added} = C_{inf} \\times V_{inf} = 1026 \\text{ mOsm/L} \\times 1 \\text{ L} = 1026 \\text{ mOsm}$$\n\nNow, we determine the final state of the system after the infusion and equilibration.\nThe final total body water, $W_{TBW, f}$, is the sum of the initial water and the added water. Based on the principle of conservation of water (as renal excretion is assumed to be zero):\n$$W_{TBW, f} = W_{TBW, i} + W_{added} = 42 \\text{ kg} + 1 \\text{ kg} = 43 \\text{ kg}$$\nThe final total number of osmoles, $Osm_{total, f}$, is the sum of the initial osmoles and the added osmoles.

This is the difference between the final and initial osmolalities:\n$$\\Delta P_{osm} = P_{osm, f} - P_{osm, i}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{osm} = 302.232558... \\text{ mOsm/kg} - 285 \\text{ mOsm/kg} = 17.232558... \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\n\nFinally, the answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta P_{osm} \\approx 17.23 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\nThis represents the increase in the whole-body and plasma osmolality due to the infusion of a hypertonic saline solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.23}$$", "id": "2832976"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of maintaining whole-body osmolality, we now zoom into the first major step of renal function: the formation of filtrate at the glomerulus.
