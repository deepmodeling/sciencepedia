We are instructed to begin from first principles.\n\nThe governing principle for this fluid dynamics problem is the balance of forces on a fluid element in steady flow. Consider a cylindrical pipe of radius $R$ and length $L$. The flow is driven by a pressure difference $\\Delta P$ across the length $L$. For a steady flow ($i.e.$, no acceleration), the net force on any fluid element is zero. Let us analyze a cylindrical element of fluid of radius $r$ (where $r \\le R$) and length $L$, coaxial with the pipe.\n\nThe forces acting on this fluid cylinder are:\n1.  A force from the pressure at the inlet: $F_{P1} = P_1 (\\pi r^2)$.\n2.  A force from the pressure at the outlet: $F_{P2} = -P_2 (\\pi r^2)$.\n3.  A viscous drag force, $F_{\\eta}$, exerted by the adjacent outer layer of fluid on the surface area of the cylinder, $A_{surf} = 2\\pi r L$. This force opposes the direction of flow.\n\nThe net pressure force is $F_P = F_{P1} + F_{P2} = (P_1 - P_2)\\pi r^2 = \\Delta P \\pi r^2$.\nThe viscous drag force is $F_{\\eta} = -\\tau(r) (2\\pi r L)$, where $\\tau(r)$ is the shear stress at radius $r$. For steady flow, the sum of forces is zero:\n$$ \\Delta P \\pi r^2 - \\tau(r) (2\\pi r L) = 0 $$\nFrom this force balance, we can express the shear stress as a function of radius $r$:\n$$ \\tau(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r $$\nThe problem states the fluid is Newtonian. For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient. In cylindrical coordinates, this relationship is given by:\n$$ \\tau(r) = -\\eta \\frac{du}{dr} $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity and $u(r)$ is the fluid velocity at radius $r$. The negative sign indicates that velocity decreases as the radius increases from the center ($r=0$) towards the wall ($r=R$).\n\nEquating the two expressions for shear stress yields a first-order ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $u(r)$:\n$$ -\\eta \\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r $$\n$$ \\frac{du}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} r $$\nWe solve for $u(r)$ by integrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int du = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} r \\,dr $$\n$$ u(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} r^2 + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We determine $C$ using the no-slip boundary condition, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at the stationary wall of the conduit. At $r=R$, $u(R)=0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} R^2 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} R^2 $$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the equation for $u(r)$, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile for laminar flow in a pipe:\n$$ u(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe.

The vessel has radius $R_v = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and length $L_v = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The tracheid has radius $R_t = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and length $L_t = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Both are subjected to the same pressure difference magnitude $\\Delta P = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, and the fluid is water with viscosity $\\eta = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\,s}$.\n\nUsing the Hagen–Poiseuille equation for each conduit:\n$$ Q_v = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R_v^4}{8\\eta L_v} $$\n$$ Q_t = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R_t^4}{8\\eta L_t} $$\nThe problem states that $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$ are the same for both conduits ($L_v = L_t = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). Therefore, when we compute the ratio $\\frac{Q_v}{Q_t}$, these terms will cancel:\n$$ \\frac{Q_v}{Q_t} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R_v^4}{8\\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R_t^4}{8\\eta L}} = \\frac{R_v^4}{R_t^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_v}{R_t}\\right)^4 $$\nThe numerical values of $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$ are not needed for the calculation of the ratio, though they are necessary to confirm that the flow regime is indeed laminar. A calculation of the Reynolds number ($Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\eta}$) for the wider conduit (the vessel) yields $Re \\approx 139$, which is well below the threshold for turbulence ($Re \\approx 2300$), validating the laminar flow model.\n\nNow, we substitute the given radii into the ratio expression:\n$$ R_v = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ R_t = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\frac{Q_v}{Q_t} = \\left(\\frac{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^4 = (4)^4 $$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$ 4^4 = 16^2 = 256 $$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless number.

The final answer must be a single real number.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. We will proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relationship between the pressure difference, $\\Delta P$, across a spherical interface and its radius of curvature, $R$. We consider a reversible, isothermal, quasistatic virtual displacement of a spherical air-water interface. The problem directs a derivation from conservation of energy, which for a reversible isothermal process is equivalent to stating that the change in Helmholtz free energy, $\\mathrm{d}F$, is zero at equilibrium.\n\nThe total differential of the Helmholtz free energy, $F$, includes terms for mechanical work and the creation of a new surface area. The work done by the system against the pressure difference $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$ during a volume expansion $\\mathrm{d}V$ is $\\Delta P\\,\\mathrm{d}V$. Thus, the work done on the system is $-\\Delta P\\,\\mathrm{d}V$. The change in surface free energy, as defined in the problem, is $\\mathrm{d}U_{\\text{surf}} = \\gamma\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $A$ is the surface area.\n\nThe total change in free energy for the combined system (bulk phases + interface) is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}F = -\\Delta P\\,\\mathrm{d}V + \\gamma\\,\\mathrm{d}A $$\nAt equilibrium, the free energy of the system is at a minimum, so for any virtual displacement, the change $\\mathrm{d}F$ must be zero. This yields the condition of mechanical equilibrium:\n$$ \\Delta P\\,\\mathrm{d}V = \\gamma\\,\\mathrm{d}A $$\nTo proceed, we must relate the change in volume, $\\mathrm{d}V$, to the change in area, $\\mathrm{d}A$, for a spherical interface. Let the sphere have a radius of curvature $R$. Its volume $V$ and surface area $A$ are:\n$$ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3} $$\n$$ A = 4\\pi R^{2} $$\nWe consider a virtual displacement that changes the radius by an infinitesimal amount $\\mathrm{d}R$.

This simplification yields:\n$$ \\Delta P \\cdot R = 2\\gamma $$\nRearranging for the pressure difference gives the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} $$\nThis equation relates the pressure difference across the spherical interface to the surface tension and the radius of curvature. The pressure is higher on the concave side of the interface. In the context of xylem, the water is under tension (lower pressure), so the air-water interface is concave when viewed from the air, and its center of curvature lies within the water.

Therefore, we set $R = r$ in our derived equation.\n\nThe magnitude of the pressure difference, $|\\Delta P|$, sustained by the meniscus is:\n$$ |\\Delta P| = \\frac{2\\gamma}{r} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ |\\Delta P| = \\frac{2 \\times 0.072\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n$$ 2 \\times 0.072 = 0.144 $$\nSo the expression becomes:\n$$ |\\Delta P| = \\frac{0.144\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.144}{50} \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}} $$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$ is the Pascal, $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$ |\\Delta P| = 0.00288 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 2.88 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$).

Parameter estimation via nonlinear least squares.\n2.  Uncertainty quantification using a parametric bootstrap.\n3.  Formatting and presenting the results as specified.\n\n**1. The Logistic Model for Xylem Vulnerability**\n\nThe cohesion-tension theory describes how negative pressure (tension) in xylem conduits pulls water from roots to leaves. Sufficiently high tension can cause cavitation, where air is pulled into a conduit (air-seeding), leading to an embolism that blocks water flow. The vulnerability of xylem to this phenomenon is characterized by a vulnerability curve, which plots the Percent Loss of Conductivity (PLC) against water potential ($\\psi$).\n\nThe problem provides a logistic model for the probability, $p(\\psi)$, that a single conduit embolizes at a given water potential $\\psi$:\n$$\np(\\psi) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left( S(\\psi - \\psi_{50}) \\right)}\n$$\nThis equation describes a sigmoidal relationship, common for threshold phenomena. The parameters are:\n- $\\psi_{50}$: The water potential (in units of MPa) at which $50\\%$ of the conduits have embolized, so $PLC = 0.5$. This parameter indicates the overall resistance of the xylem to embolism.\n- $S$: A steepness parameter (in units of MPa$^{-1}$) that determines how rapidly PLC changes with water potential around $\\psi_{50}$. A larger $S$ implies a more synchronized embolism of conduits across a narrow range of water potentials.\n\nThe measured $PLC$ at a given $\\psi$ is treated as the empirical estimate of this probability $p(\\psi)$, based on a sample of conduits.\n\n**2. Parameter Estimation by Nonlinear Least Squares**\n\nThe first task is to find the parameter values, denoted $\\widehat{\\psi}_{50}$ and $\\widehat{S}$, that provide the best fit of the model $p(\\psi)$ to the observed data $\\{(\\psi_i, PLC_i)\\}$. \"Best fit\" is defined in terms of minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR), an approach known as unweighted nonlinear least squares. The objective function to minimize is:\n$$\nSSR(\\psi_{50}, S) = \\sum_{i} \\left( PLC_i - p(\\psi_i; \\psi_{50}, S) \\right)^2\n$$\nThis minimization problem is solved numerically. We utilize the `curve_fit` function from the `scipy.optimize` library, which is designed for this purpose. It employs an iterative algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt) to find the parameter values that minimize the SSR. To ensure scientifically meaningful results and aid convergence, we constrain the steepness parameter $S$ to be non-negative ($S \\geq 0$) and provide a reasonable initial guess for both parameters.\n\n**3. Confidence Interval Estimation via Parametric Bootstrap**\n\nThe values $\\widehat{\\psi}_{50}$ and $\\widehat{S}$ are point estimates and are subject to uncertainty arising from the stochastic nature of embolism and measurement sampling. To quantify this uncertainty, a parametric bootstrap is performed. This resampling method generates synthetic datasets based on the fitted model to simulate the variability we would expect if we were to repeat the experiment many times.\n\nThe procedure is as follows for a total of $B=300$ bootstrap replicates, using a fixed pseudorandom seed of $12345$ for reproducibility:\n1.  **Generate a Synthetic Dataset**: For each measured water potential $\\psi_i$, we have an observed number of conduits, $N_i$. The probability of an individual conduit being embolized at this potential is estimated by our fitted model, $\\hat{p}_i = p(\\psi_i; \\widehat{\\psi}_{50}, \\widehat{S})$. We simulate the counting of embolized conduits by drawing a random number $K_i^*$ from a binomial distribution:\n    $$\n    K_i^* \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, \\hat{p}_i)\n    $$\n    This step correctly models the binomial sampling error inherent in estimating a proportion ($PLC$) from a finite count.\n2.  **Calculate Synthetic PLC**: The bootstrap PLC value is then $PLC_i^* = K_i^* / N_i$. The collection $\\{(\\psi_i, PLC_i^*)\\}$ forms one synthetic dataset.\n3.  **Refit the Model**: The logistic model is refit to this new synthetic dataset using the same nonlinear least squares procedure, yielding a set of bootstrap parameter estimates, $(\\psi_{50}^*, S^*)$.\n4.  **Collect Bootstrap Estimates**: This process is repeated $300$ times, yielding two distributions of $300$ bootstrap estimates each, one for $\\psi_{50}$ and one for $S$.\n\nThese distributions empirically approximate the sampling distributions of the estimators $\\widehat{\\psi}_{50}$ and $\\widehat{S}$. The two-sided $0.95$ confidence interval for each parameter is then determined by finding the $0.025$ and $0.975$ quantiles of its corresponding bootstrap distribution. For example, the lower and upper bounds for the $\\psi_{50}$ confidence interval, $L_{\\psi_{50}}$ and $U_{\\psi_{50}}$, are the $2.5^{th}$ and $97.5^{th}$ percentiles of the collected $\\psi_{50}^*$ values.\n\n**4. Final Implementation and Output**\n\nThe algorithm is implemented in a Python script. For each of the three datasets, the script first computes the point estimates $(\\widehat{\\psi}_{50}, \\widehat{S})$, then runs the parametric bootstrap to find the confidence intervals $(L_{\\psi_{50}}, U_{\\psi_{50}})$ and $(L_{S}, U_{S})$.
