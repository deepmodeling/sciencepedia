This first practice provides a crucial \"back-of-the-envelope\" calculation to ground our understanding of this principle. By estimating the number of individual power strokes required to achieve a significant sarcomere shortening, you will forge a quantitative link between the nanometer world of a single myosin head and the micrometer-scale function of the contractile unit [@problem_id:1753050]. This exercise reinforces the fundamental geometry and stoichiometry of muscle contraction.", "problem": "In a physiological model of skeletal muscle contraction, a single sarcomere is observed. The sarcomere has a resting length of $L_0 = 2.5 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. During an isotonic contraction, the sarcomere shortens by 20% of its initial resting length. This shortening is a result of thin (actin) filaments sliding past thick (myosin) filaments, a process described by the sliding filament model. The shortening is symmetric, meaning the thin filaments anchored at the Z-discs on both ends of the sarcomere slide equally towards the central M-line.\n\nThe sliding motion is driven by the cyclical binding and unbinding of myosin heads to the actin filaments. Each complete cycle, known as a cross-bridge cycle, culminates in a \"power stroke\" that pulls the actin filament by a discrete distance. For this particular muscle fiber, a single power stroke moves an actin filament by a distance of $d = 10 \\, \\text{nm}$.\n\nAssuming that the action of the myosin heads on one half of the sarcomere is synchronized, calculate the number of cross-bridge cycles that must occur for the actin filaments attached to a single Z-disc to produce the total observed sarcomere shortening. Report your answer as an integer.", "solution": "The sliding filament model states that sarcomere shortening arises from actin filaments sliding past myosin filaments. For symmetric shortening, both halves of the sarcomere contribute equally, so the displacement of the actin attached to a single Z-disc is half of the total sarcomere shortening.\n\nGiven resting length $L_{0}$ and shortening fraction $s = 0.2$, the total sarcomere shortening is\n$$\n\\Delta L = s L_{0} = 0.2 L_{0}.\n$$\nSymmetry implies the displacement required from one Z-disc is\n$$\nx = \\frac{\\Delta L}{2} = \\frac{0.2 L_{0}}{2} = 0.1 L_{0}.\n$$\nEach cross-bridge cycle produces a power stroke of length $d$, so the number of synchronized cycles needed on one half-sarcomere is obtained by\n$$\nN d = x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N = \\frac{x}{d} = \\frac{0.1 L_{0}}{d}.\n$$\nSubstituting $L_{0} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$ and $d = 10 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$,\n$$\nN = \\frac{0.1 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-6}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{0.25}{10} \\times 10^{3} = 25.\n$$\nThus, $25$ cross-bridge cycles are required for the actin filaments attached to a single Z-disc to account for the observed shortening.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25}$$", "id": "1753050"}, {"introduction": "While the power stroke provides the mechanical action, the cross-bridge cycle is fundamentally a chemo-mechanical process meticulously controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis. To truly understand this engine, we can use thought experiments to probe its critical control points. This problem challenges you to predict the consequences of inhibiting a single, specific step: the release of inorganic phosphate ($P_{i}$) from the myosin head [@problem_id:1753023]. By analyzing the point at which the cycle arrests, we can clearly distinguish the roles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and $P_{i}$ release in governing the transition from a low-force to a high-force, power-generating state.", "problem": "In the field of muscle physiology, researchers are investigating a novel drug intended to modulate muscle contraction. The drug's mechanism of action is highly specific: it allows the myosin head to hydrolyze Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and bind to the actin filament, but it potently inhibits the subsequent release of the inorganic phosphate ($P_{i}$) group from the myosin head. All other cellular processes, including calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) signaling and the availability of ATP and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), are assumed to remain normal.\n\nBased on the established sliding filament model of muscle contraction, what is the most direct and immediate consequence for the cross-bridge cycle in a muscle fiber exposed to this drug?\n\nA. The myosin head will be unable to bind to the actin filament to form a cross-bridge.\n\nB. Myosin heads will bind to actin, but will be arrested in a \"cocked,\" high-energy state, unable to perform the power stroke.\n\nC. The muscle fiber will enter a state of extreme rigidity, similar to rigor mortis, because the myosin heads cannot detach from actin.\n\nD. The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and $P_{i}$ by the myosin head will be prevented.\n\nE. Calcium ions will be blocked from binding to troponin, thus preventing the exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin.", "solution": "We analyze the cross-bridge cycle using the sliding filament model, denoting myosin by $M$, actin by $A$, adenosine triphosphate by $\\text{ATP}$, adenosine diphosphate by $\\text{ADP}$, and inorganic phosphate by $P_{i}$.

Translating this into the scheme above:\n\n- Step 2 is permitted: $M\\cdot \\text{ATP} \\to M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$.\n- Step 3 is permitted: $M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ can bind actin weakly to form $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$.\n- Step 4 is specifically blocked: the release of $P_{i}$ from $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ cannot occur, so the power stroke and transition to strong binding cannot proceed.\n\nTherefore, the cross-bridge accumulates in the pre-power-stroke, cocked, high-energy state $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ and is unable to execute the power stroke. This directly rules out options that contradict the given permissions:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because actin binding is allowed (Step 3 proceeds).\n- Option D is incorrect because ATP hydrolysis is allowed (Step 2 proceeds).\n- Option E is incorrect because $Ca^{2+}$ signaling and troponin binding are normal, so thin filament activation is unaffected.\n- Option C is incorrect because rigor-like rigidity requires strong, nucleotide-free binding ($A\\cdot M$) with failure of detachment due to absent ATP. Here, the block is upstream at $P_{i}$ release; the system does not reach the strong-binding state that causes rigor. Moreover, the $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ complex is a weakly bound, pre-power-stroke state.\n\nThe most direct and immediate consequence is that myosin heads bind to actin but are arrested in the cocked, high-energy, pre-power-stroke state because $P_{i}$ release—the trigger for the power stroke—is inhibited.
