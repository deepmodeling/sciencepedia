Consider a sieve element (inside, denoted by subscript $i$) in contact with the apoplast (outside, denoted by subscript $o$). Assume sucrose is uncharged and ideal in both compartments and that temperature is uniform at $T$. Let $C_{SE}$ and $C_{apo}$ denote the sucrose concentrations inside the sieve element cytosol and in the apoplast, respectively.

This is a problem in chemical thermodynamics applied to a biological transport process.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the process. The problem describes the cotransport of one proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) and one molecule of sucrose ($S$) from the apoplast (outside, subscript $o$) into the sieve element (inside, subscript $i$). The stoichiometry is given as $1\\ \\mathrm{H}^{+}:1\\ \\mathrm{sucrose}$. The net reaction for this coupled transport is:\n$$ \\mathrm{S}_{o} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}_{o} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{S}_{i} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}_{i} $$\nThe total change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{total}$, for transporting one mole of each species across the membrane is the sum of the changes in their respective electrochemical potentials ($\\tilde{\\mu}$).\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} + \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\tilde{\\mu}_{j,i} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{j,o}$ represents the change in electrochemical potential for species $j$ moving from outside to inside.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum $\\Delta p$ required to maintain the concentration gradient. This minimum condition corresponds to the reversible limit, or thermodynamic equilibrium, where the net flux is zero. At equilibrium, the total change in Gibbs free energy for the process is zero.\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the equilibrium condition is:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} + \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} $$\nThis equation shows that at equilibrium, the energy released by the favorable movement of protons down their electrochemical gradient exactly balances the energy required to move sucrose against its concentration gradient.\n\nNext, we must express each term. The electrochemical potential for a species $j$ is given by $\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^{\\circ} + RT\\ln(C_j) + z_j F \\psi$, where $\\mu_j^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $C_j$ is the molar concentration, $z_j$ is the charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential.\n\nFor sucrose ($S$), which is an uncharged molecule, its charge $z_{S}$ is $0$. Therefore, its electrochemical potential is simply its chemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = \\mu_{S}$. The change in chemical potential for sucrose moving from outside to inside is:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = \\mu_{S,i} - \\mu_{S,o} = (\\mu_{S}^{\\circ} + RT\\ln C_{SE}) - (\\mu_{S}^{\\circ} + RT\\ln C_{apo}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) $$\nHere, we use the given notation $C_{SE}$ for the inside concentration and $C_{apo}$ for the outside concentration.\n\nFor the proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$), its charge $z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is $+1$. The change in its electrochemical potential for moving from outside to inside is:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},i} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},o} = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ} + RT\\ln[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_i + F\\psi_i) - (\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ} + RT\\ln[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_o + F\\psi_o) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_i}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_o}\\right) + F(\\psi_i - \\psi_o) $$\nThe problem provides a direct relationship between this change in potential energy and the proton motive force, $\\Delta p$. It states that the available work per mole of protons moving from outside to inside is $F\\Delta p$. Work made available by a process is the negative of the change in Gibbs free energy of that process. The process is the movement of one mole of protons from $o$ to $i$, for which the Gibbs free energy change is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},i} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},o}$.\nThus, the available work is $-\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.\n$$ F\\Delta p = -\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -F\\Delta p $$\nThis definition means that when proton movement from outside to inside is energetically favorable ($\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} < 0$), the value of $\\Delta p$ is positive, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S}$ and $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ into the equilibrium equation $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S}$:\n$$ -F\\Delta p = - \\left( RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) \\right) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ gives:\n$$ F\\Delta p = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) $$\nFinally, we solve for $\\Delta p$ by dividing by the Faraday constant, $F$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the minimum proton motive force, in volts, required to achieve the specified sucrose concentration ratio $C_{SE}/C_{apo}$ at the reversible limit. To actively accumulate sucrose (i.e., for $C_{SE} > C_{apo}$), the logarithm is positive, requiring a positive $\\Delta p$, which corresponds to an inwardly directed electrochemical driving force for protons.

The new solute potential is:\n$$ \\Psi_{s,2} = -C_2RT $$\nThis sudden decrease in solute potential (making it more negative) lowers the total water potential inside the cell, creating a water potential gradient that drives water from the apoplast into the sieve element. This influx of water increases the hydrostatic pressure, or turgor, inside the cell. The pressure potential rises to a new value, $\\Psi_{p,2}$. The problem specifies that water exchange is rapid and equilibrium is immediately re-established.

This problem [@problem_id:2822639] explores a critical trade-off in plant physiology: does increasing phloem sucrose concentration during drought improve transport by boosting the osmotic driving force, or impede it by increasing sap viscosity? By integrating the principles of osmosis with fluid dynamics, you will analyze a realistic scenario to understand the complex, and sometimes conflicting, physical constraints on phloem translocation.", "problem": "A herbaceous plant maintains phloem translocation from a source leaf to a root sink through a single dominant sieve tube. Under well-watered conditions, the sucrose concentration in the source sieve element is $0.70\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, and in the sink sieve element is $0.30\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. Under moderate drought, sustained phloem loading raises sucrose concentrations to $1.10\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ at the source and $0.50\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ at the sink.

The flow rate will decrease because the viscosity increase with concentration more than offsets the increase in osmotic driving force; thus, increased concentration exacerbates drought-imposed limitations.\n\nC. The flow rate will remain unchanged because increases in sucrose concentration always produce exactly offsetting changes in osmotic driving force and viscosity.\n\nD. The outcome is unpredictable because sucrose concentration decreases viscosity while also decreasing osmotic driving force under drought.", "solution": "The volumetric flow rate, $Q$, of sap through a sieve tube is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} \\Delta P $$\nwhere $r$ is the sieve tube radius, $L$ is its length, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the sap, and $\\Delta P$ is the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the source and the sink.\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure, $P$, in a sieve element is generated osmotically. According to the principles of water potential, the turgor pressure $P$ is given by $P = \\Psi_x - \\Psi_{\\pi}$, where $\\Psi_x$ is the water potential of the adjacent xylem and $\\Psi_{\\pi}$ is the osmotic potential of the sieve element sap. The osmotic potential is given by the van 't Hoff equation, $\\Psi_{\\pi} = -iCRT$, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor (for sucrose, $i=1$), $C$ is the molar concentration of sucrose, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Thus, the turgor pressure is:\n$$ P = \\Psi_x + CRT $$\n\nThe pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ driving the flow is the difference between the pressure at the source ($s$) and the sink ($k$):\n$$ \\Delta P = P_s - P_k = (\\Psi_{x,s} + C_s RT) - (\\Psi_{x,k} + C_k RT) $$\n$$ \\Delta P = (\\Psi_{x,s} - \\Psi_{x,k}) + RT(C_s - C_k) $$\nThe problem states to assume that the contribution of xylem water potential difference, $\\Psi_{x,s} - \\Psi_{x,k}$, cancels out or remains constant. Therefore, the driving pressure gradient is directly proportional to the difference in sucrose concentrations:\n$$ \\Delta P \\propto (C_s - C_k) $$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation and noting that the sieve tube geometry ($r$ and $L$) is assumed to be constant, we find that the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is proportional to the ratio of the concentration difference to the viscosity:\n$$ Q \\propto \\frac{C_s - C_k}{\\eta} $$\nThis relationship allows for a comparison of the flow rate under well-watered (WW) conditions and drought (D) conditions. We will calculate the value of the term $\\frac{C_s - C_k}{\\eta}$ for each case, using the provided data. The problem provides viscosity values at the source concentrations, which we will use as representative values for the viscosity $\\eta$ in each condition.\n\n**Case 1: Well-watered (WW) conditions**\n-   Source concentration, $C_{s, WW} = 0.70\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n-   Sink concentration, $C_{k, WW} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n-   Concentration difference, $\\Delta C_{WW} = C_{s, WW} - C_{k, WW} = 0.70 - 0.30 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n-   Viscosity, $\\eta_{WW} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$\n\nThe factor proportional to flow rate is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta C_{WW}}{\\eta_{WW}} = \\frac{0.40}{1.7} \\approx 0.235 \\text{ (in arbitrary units of } \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}\\,(mPa\\cdot s)^{-1}} \\text{)} $$\n\n**Case 2: Moderate drought (D) conditions**\n-   Source concentration, $C_{s, D} = 1.10\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n-   Sink concentration, $C_{k, D} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n-   Concentration difference, $\\Delta C_{D} = C_{s, D} - C_{k, D} = 1.10 - 0.50 = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n-   Viscosity, $\\eta_{D} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$\n\nThe factor proportional to flow rate is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta C_{D}}{\\eta_{D}} = \\frac{0.60}{3.0} = 0.200 \\text{ (in the same arbitrary units)} $$\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\nComparing the two cases, we find that $0.200 < 0.235$. This means that the volumetric flow rate decreases under the moderate drought conditions described.\n\nTo understand why, we examine the relative changes.\nThe osmotic driving force, proportional to $\\Delta C$, increases from $0.40$ to $0.60\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, an increase by a factor of $\\frac{0.60}{0.40} = 1.5$, or $50\\%$.\nThe viscous resistance, proportional to $\\eta$, increases from $1.7$ to $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$, an increase by a factor of $\\frac{3.0}{1.7} \\approx 1.765$, or approximately $76.5\\%$.\n\nSince the percentage increase in viscosity ($76.5\\%$) is larger than the percentage increase in the osmotic driving force ($50\\%$), the net result is a reduction in flow rate. Therefore, the physiological response of increasing sucrose concentration under drought, while potentially beneficial for osmotic adjustment, exacerbates the physical limitations to bulk flow in the phloem.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The flow rate will increase because higher sucrose concentrations increase the osmotic driving force more than they increase viscosity; thus, increased concentration compensates for drought-imposed limitations.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. Our calculation shows the flow rate will decrease. The reasoning is also flawed; the viscosity increase is proportionally greater than the increase in the osmotic driving force.\n\n**B. The flow rate will decrease because the viscosity increase with concentration more than offsets the increase in osmotic driving force; thus, increased concentration exacerbates drought-imposed limitations.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. Our calculation demonstrates that the flow rate decreases. The reasoning provided is also correct: the substantial increase in viscosity ($76.5\\%$) is not fully compensated by the smaller increase in the concentration gradient ($50\\%$), leading to a net decrease in flow. This exacerbates transport limitations.\n\n**C. The flow rate will remain unchanged because increases in sucrose concentration always produce exactly offsetting changes in osmotic driving force and viscosity.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The flow rate does not remain unchanged. The premise that changes in osmotic force and viscosity \"always\" offset is a false generalization; our calculation with the given data provides a direct counterexample.\n\n**D. The outcome is unpredictable because sucrose concentration decreases viscosity while also decreasing osmotic driving force under drought.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The outcome is predictable with the given assumptions and data. The premise of the reasoning is factually wrong on two counts. First, increasing sucrose concentration *increases*, not decreases, viscosity, as shown by the provided data ($1.7 \\to 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$). Second, the osmotic driving force, proportional to $\\Delta C$, *increases*, not decreases, under drought in this scenario ($0.40 \\to 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2822639"}]}
