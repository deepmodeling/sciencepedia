The coefficient of relatedness between two individuals, denoted by $r(A,B)$, is the probability that a randomly chosen allele at a randomly chosen autosomal locus in individual $A$ is IBD to a randomly chosen allele at the same locus in individual $B$. Assume the following foundational principles: (i) Mendelian segregation, such that each meiosis transmits each autosomal allele with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$; (ii) the founders are outbred and mutually unrelated, so that the inbreeding coefficient of any founding ancestor is $F=0$; and (iii) independent assortment across loci and no sex-specific transmission bias for autosomes.\n\nUsing only these principles, and the logic that any IBD sharing between two non-inbred individuals must be traceable through paths connecting them via shared ancestors, compute $r$ by enumerating and summing the contributions of all distinct minimal genealogical paths between the focal pair, where each meiosis along a path contributes a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCompute $r$ for the following three relationships under the stated assumptions:\n- full siblings (shared mother and father),\n- half siblings (shared mother only; fathers unrelated to each other and to the mother),\n- first cousins (their parents are full siblings; no other shared ancestry, that is, not double cousins).\n\nExpress your final answer as exact rational numbers, in the order [full siblings, half siblings, first cousins], as a single row matrix.

The methodology is explicitly prescribed. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between pairs of individuals. The calculation must follow the method of path analysis. For two non-inbred individuals, $X$ and $Y$, with non-inbred common ancestors, the coefficient of relatedness $r(X,Y)$ is the sum of probabilities over all possible genealogical paths connecting them. Each path must proceed from one individual, say $X$, up to a common ancestor, $A$, and then down to the other individual, $Y$. The contribution of each such path is given by $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$, where $n$ is the total number of meiotic steps in the path.

The number of meiotic steps is the sum of generations from $C_1$ to $GM$ ($2$ steps: $C_1 \\leftarrow P_1 \\leftarrow GM$) and from $GM$ to $C_2$ ($2$ steps: $GM \\rightarrow P_2 \\rightarrow C_2$).

It is a textbook application of social evolution theory.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\n- The problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the selection gradient for a social trait $z$. According to the problem definition, we must construct the expression for the marginal change in inclusive fitness, which we denote as $\\delta W_{\\text{incl}}$, for an actor exhibiting a trait change of $\\delta z$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\delta W_{\\text{incl}}$ is the sum of the direct effect on the actor's fitness and the indirect effect on the recipient's fitness, weighted by their genetic relatedness $r$.\n\nThe marginal direct effect on the actor is a reduction at a rate $c$ per unit of the trait $z$. For a small change $\\delta z$, this effect on the actor's fitness is given by the expression $-c \\delta z$.\n\nThe marginal effect on the recipient is an increase at a rate $b$ per unit of the trait $z$. For a small change $\\delta z$ in the actor's trait, the effect on the recipient's fitness is $b \\delta z$. This effect is weighted by the relatedness coefficient $r$ when calculating the inclusive fitness effect. Thus, the indirect component of the change in inclusive fitness is $r (b \\delta z)$.\n\nSumming these two components gives the total marginal change in inclusive fitness:\n$$\n\\delta W_{\\text{incl}} = -c \\delta z + r b \\delta z\n$$\nWe can factor out the term $\\delta z$:\n$$\n\\delta W_{\\text{incl}} = (rb - c) \\delta z\n$$\nThe problem states that a first-order (linear) approximation is appropriate and that the sign of the selection gradient on $z$ matches the sign of this marginal inclusive fitness effect. The selection gradient, which we can denote by $S$, is defined as the partial derivative of fitness with respect to the trait, evaluated at the resident trait value. In this linear approximation, the selection gradient is the coefficient that multiplies the change in the trait $\\delta z$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\partial W_{\\text{incl}}}{\\partial z} \\bigg|_{z=0} = rb - c\n$$\nThis expression is the core of Hamilton's rule. Altruism, defined as a costly act that benefits others (i.e., a positive $\\delta z$ with $c>0$ and $b>0$), is favored by natural selection if the selection gradient $S$ is positive. A positive $S$ means that an increase in the trait $z$ leads to an increase in inclusive fitness.\n\nFirst, we determine if altruism is favored. We substitute the given values $r=0.5$, $b=2$, and $c=1.2$ into the expression for the selection gradient $S$:\n$$\nS = (0.5)(2) - 1.2 = 1 - 1.2 = -0.2\n$$\nSince the selection gradient $S = -0.2$ is negative, selection will act to decrease the value of the trait $z$. Therefore, a positive change $\\delta z > 0$ (altruism) is not favored under these conditions; it is selected against.\n\nSecond, we compute the magnitude of the selection gradient. The selection gradient is $S = -0.2$. The magnitude is the absolute value of $S$:\n$$\n|S| = |-0.2| = 0.2\n$$\nThis is the final numerical value requested by the problem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2}\n$$", "id": "2813994"}, {"introduction": "While Hamilton's rule is powerful, many social interactions involve strategic interplay between individuals whose decisions are interdependent.

It presents a standard model of biparental care as a non-cooperative game. All parameters and functional properties are clearly defined, allowing for a rigorous mathematical analysis. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: General Analysis\n\nWe are given the objective functions for the male ($m$) and the female ($f$):\n$$U_{m}(I_{m}, I_{f}) = r S(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{m}(I_{m})$$\n$$U_{f}(I_{m}, I_{f}) = r S(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{f}(I_{f})$$\nwhere $I_{m} \\ge 0$ and $I_{f} \\ge 0$ are the care efforts.

To find the male's best response to a given female effort $I_f$, we maximize his utility $U_m$ with respect to his own effort $I_m$.\n$$\\max_{I_{m} \\ge 0} \\left[ r S(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{m}(I_{m}) \\right]$$\nThe objective function is strictly concave in $I_m$ because $S$ is strictly concave and $-C_m$ is strictly concave. Thus, the first-order condition is sufficient for a unique maximum. Assuming an interior solution where $I_{m}^{\\ast} > 0$, the first-order condition (FOC) is found by setting the partial derivative with respect to $I_m$ equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_{m}}{\\partial I_{m}} = r S'(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{m}'(I_{m}) = 0$$\nThis equation implicitly defines the male's best-response function, $I_{m}^{\\ast}(I_{f})$.\n\nSimilarly, for the female, her best-response function $I_{f}^{\\ast}(I_{m})$ is implicitly defined by her FOC, assuming $I_{f}^{\\ast} > 0$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_{f}}{\\partial I_{f}} = r S'(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{f}'(I_{f}) = 0$$\nA Nash equilibrium $(I_{m}^{\\ast}, I_{f}^{\\ast})$ is a pair of efforts that simultaneously satisfies both first-order conditions.\n\nNext, we derive the comparative static $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}}$, which is the slope of the male's best-response function. We take the male's FOC, which must hold as an identity for all $I_f$:\n$$r S'(I_{m}^{\\ast}(I_{f})+I_{f}) - C_{m}'(I_{m}^{\\ast}(I_{f})) = 0$$\nWe differentiate this entire expression with respect to $I_f$ using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} \\left[ r S'(I_{m}^{\\ast}(I_{f})+I_{f}) - C_{m}'(I_{m}^{\\ast}(I_{f})) \\right] = 0$$\n$$r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} + 1\\right) - C_{m}''(I_{m}^{\\ast}) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} = 0$$\nLet's rearrange to solve for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}}$:\n$$r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} + r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}) - C_{m}''(I_{m}^{\\ast}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{dI_{m}^{\\ast}}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} \\left( r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}) - C_{m}''(I_{m}^{\\ast}) \\right) = -r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f})$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} = \\frac{-r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f})}{r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}) - C_{m}''(I_{m}^{\\ast})} = \\frac{r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f})}{C_{m}''(I_{m}^{\\ast}) - r S''(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f})}$$\nWe now use the given curvature assumptions. We know $r>0$, $S'' < 0$ (strict concavity), and $C_{m}'' > 0$ (strict convexity).\nThe numerator is $r S'' < 0$.\nThe denominator is $C_{m}'' - r S''$. Since $C_{m}''>0$ and $-rS''>0$, the denominator is strictly positive.\nTherefore, the entire fraction is negative:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} < 0$$\nTo show that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} > -1$, we test the inequality:\n$$\\frac{r S''}{C_{m}'' - r S''} > -1$$\nSince the denominator is positive, we can multiply both sides by it without reversing the inequality:\n$$r S'' > -(C_{m}'' - r S'')$$\n$$r S'' > -C_{m}'' + r S''$$\n$$0 > -C_{m}''$$\n$$C_{m}'' > 0$$\nThis is true by the assumption of strictly convex cost. Thus, we have proven $-1 < \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} < 0$.\n\nThe biological meaning of this result is that parental efforts are strategic substitutes. The inequality $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} < 0$ means that if the female increases her investment, the male's optimal response is to decrease his. This is a form of free-riding, as the male benefits from the female's increased effort without paying the cost. However, the compensation is only partial, as shown by $\\frac{\\mathrm{dI_{m}^{\\ast}}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} > -1$. This means that for every unit of effort the female adds, the male reduces his effort by less than one unit. Consequently, the total investment in care, $I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}$, increases when one parent invests more. To see this, consider the total change in effort as $I_f$ changes: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f})}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} + 1 > 0$. This ensures that total parental care is not undermined by the strategic substitution.\n\nPart 2: Quantitative Solution\n\nWe are given the specific functional forms:\n$$S(x) = 1 - \\exp(-kx), \\quad k>0$$\n$$C_{m}(I_{m}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\alpha I_{m}^{2}, \\quad \\alpha>0$$\n$$C_{f}(I_{f}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta I_{f}^{2}, \\quad \\beta>0$$\nThe derivatives required for the FOCs are:\n$$S'(x) = k \\exp(-kx)$$\n$$C_{m}'(I_{m}) = \\alpha I_{m}$$\n$$C_{f}'(I_{f}) = \\beta I_{f}$$\nSubstituting these into the FOCs from Part 1, we obtain the system of equations for the Nash equilibrium $(I_{m}^{\\ast}, I_{f}^{\\ast})$:\n$$r k \\exp(-k(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}^{\\ast})) - \\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n$$r k \\exp(-k(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}^{\\ast})) - \\beta I_{f}^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (2)$$\nFrom these two equations, we see that the left-hand sides are equal for the shared term:\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = \\beta I_{f}^{\\ast}$$\nThis yields a linear relationship between the optimal efforts:\n$$I_{f}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} I_{m}^{\\ast}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $I_{f}^{\\ast}$ back into equation ($1$):\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = r k \\exp\\left(-k\\left(I_{m}^{\\ast} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}I_{m}^{\\ast}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = r k \\exp\\left(-k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = r k \\exp\\left(-k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{\\beta+\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\right)$$\nTo solve this transcendental equation for $I_{m}^{\\ast}$, we rearrange it into the form $z \\exp(z) = y$, whose solution is given by the Lambert W function, $z = W(y)$.\n$$\\frac{\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast}}{r k} = \\exp\\left(-k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)$$\n$$I_{m}^{\\ast} \\exp\\left(k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{r k}{\\alpha}$$\nLet $z = k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}$.
