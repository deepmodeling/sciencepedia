It is mathematically sound, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All parameters and functions are clearly defined, and the tasks required represent a fundamental analysis of this dynamical system. Therefore, the problem is valid and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the population dynamics is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dN_1}{dt} \\;=\\; r_1 \\, N_1 \\left(1 \\;-\\; \\frac{N_1 \\;+\\; \\alpha_{12}\\,N_2}{K_1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dN_2}{dt} \\;=\\; r_2 \\, N_2 \\left(1 \\;-\\; \\frac{N_2 \\;+\\; \\alpha_{21}\\,N_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\nwhere all parameters $r_i$, $K_i$ are positive, and $\\alpha_{ij} \\ge 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points, or steady states $(N_1, N_2)$, are defined as points where the population sizes do not change over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0 $$\nFrom the first equation, we have two possibilities for $dN_1/dt = 0$:\n1. $N_1 = 0$\n2. $1 - \\frac{N_1 + \\alpha_{12}N_2}{K_1} = 0$, which simplifies to the linear equation $N_1 + \\alpha_{12}N_2 = K_1$. This is the non-trivial nullcline for species $1$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two similar possibilities for $dN_2/dt = 0$:\n1. $N_2 = 0$\n2. $1 - \\frac{N_2 + \\alpha_{21}N_1}{K_2} = 0$, which simplifies to the linear equation $\\alpha_{21}N_1 + N_2 = K_2$. This is the non-trivial nullcline for species $2$.\n\nTo find all equilibria, we must find all pairs $(N_1, N_2)$ that satisfy one condition from the first set and one condition from the second set. The equilibria must also be biologically feasible, meaning $N_1 \\ge 0$ and $N_2 \\ge 0$.\n\n**1. Trivial (Extinction) Equilibrium ($E_0$)**\nWe take $N_1=0$ from the first set of conditions and $N_2=0$ from the second. This gives the equilibrium point $E_0 = (0, 0)$.\nFeasibility: Since $N_1=0$ and $N_2=0$, this equilibrium is always biologically feasible. It represents the extinction of both species.\n\n**2. Single-Species Equilibria ($E_1$ and $E_2$)**\nFirst, consider the case where species $2$ is extinct ($N_2=0$) but species $1$ is present ($N_1 > 0$).\nWe take $N_2=0$ and the non-trivial nullcline for species $1$: $N_1 + \\alpha_{12}(0) = K_1$, which gives $N_1=K_1$.\nThis yields the equilibrium point $E_1 = (K_1, 0)$.\nFeasibility: We require $N_1 \\ge 0$ and $N_2 \\ge 0$. Since $K_1 > 0$ is given, $E_1$ is always biologically feasible. It represents the case where species $1$ exists at its carrying capacity in the absence of species $2$.\n\nSymmetrically, consider the case where species $1$ is extinct ($N_1=0$) but species $2$ is present ($N_2 > 0$).\nWe take $N_1=0$ and the non-trivial nullcline for species $2$: $\\alpha_{21}(0) + N_2 = K_2$, which gives $N_2=K_2$.\nThis yields the equilibrium point $E_2 = (0, K_2)$.\nFeasibility: Since $K_2 > 0$ is given, $E_2$ is always biologically feasible. It represents species $2$ at its carrying capacity.\n\n**3. Interior (Coexistence) Equilibrium ($E^*$): Non-degenerate case**\nThis equilibrium occurs when both species coexist, so $N_1 > 0$ and $N_2 > 0$. We must find the intersection of the two non-trivial nullclines:\n$$ N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1 $$\n$$ \\alpha_{21} N_1 + N_2 = K_2 $$\nThis is a system of two linear equations in two variables. We can solve it using standard methods. Let the determinant of the coefficient matrix be $\\Delta = 1 \\cdot 1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} = 1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}$.\nAssuming the non-degenerate case where $\\Delta \\neq 0$, a unique solution $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$ exists. Using Cramer's rule:\n$$ N_1^* = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} K_1 & \\alpha_{12} \\\\ K_2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\Delta} = \\frac{K_1 - K_2 \\alpha_{12}}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}} $$\n$$ N_2^* = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & K_1 \\\\ \\alpha_{21} & K_2 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\Delta} = \\frac{K_2 - K_1 \\alpha_{21}}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}} $$\nThis gives the coexistence equilibrium $E^* = (N_1^*, N_2^*)$.\n\nFeasibility for $E^*$: For this equilibrium to be biologically meaningful, we require $N_1^* > 0$ and $N_2^* > 0$.\n$$ \\frac{K_1 - K_2 \\alpha_{12}}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}} > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{K_2 - K_1 \\alpha_{21}}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}} > 0 $$\nTwo scenarios lead to a feasible coexistence equilibrium:\nCase (a): Weak interspecific competition ($1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} > 0$).\nThe denominators are positive, so the numerators must also be positive:\n- $K_1 - K_2 \\alpha_{12} > 0 \\implies K_1 > K_2 \\alpha_{12} \\implies \\frac{K_1}{K_2} > \\alpha_{12}$\n- $K_2 - K_1 \\alpha_{21} > 0 \\implies K_2 > K_1 \\alpha_{21} \\implies \\frac{K_2}{K_1} > \\alpha_{21}$\nThese conditions together define when a stable coexistence equilibrium exists.\n\nCase (b): Strong interspecific competition ($1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} < 0$).\nThe denominators are negative, so the numerators must also be negative:\n- $K_1 - K_2 \\alpha_{12} < 0 \\implies K_1 < K_2 \\alpha_{12} \\implies \\frac{K_1}{K_2} < \\alpha_{12}$\n- $K_2 - K_1 \\alpha_{21} < 0 \\implies K_2 < K_1 \\alpha_{21} \\implies \\frac{K_2}{K_1} < \\alpha_{21}$\nThese conditions define when an unstable coexistence equilibrium exists.\n\n**4. Degenerate Case: A Continuum of Equilibria**\nWe now address the specific case where $1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} = 0$. In this case, the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, and the two nullcline equations, $N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1$ and $\\alpha_{21} N_1 + N_2 = K_2$, represent parallel lines in the $(N_1, N_2)$ plane.\nA solution (and thus an intersection) exists only if these two lines are not just parallel but are identical. This occurs if their equations are proportional. Since $\\alpha_{21} = 1/\\alpha_{12}$, the second equation is $(1/\\alpha_{12}) N_1 + N_2 = K_2$, which can be written as $N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_2 \\alpha_{12}$.\nFor the lines to be identical, the right-hand sides must be equal: $K_1 = K_2 \\alpha_{12}$, or equivalently, $K_1/K_2 = \\alpha_{12}$.\nIf both $1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} = 0$ and $K_1/K_2 = \\alpha_{12}$ hold, then the two nullclines coalesce into a single line $N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1$. Any point on this line is an equilibrium. The set of biologically feasible equilibria is the segment of this line in the first quadrant, where $N_1 \\ge 0$ and $N_2 \\ge 0$. This forms a continuum of neutrally stable equilibria between the points $(K_1, 0)$ and $(0, K_1/\\alpha_{12})$, which is identical to $(0, K_2)$.\nIf $1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} = 0$ but $K_1 \\neq K_2 \\alpha_{12}$, the nullclines are distinct parallel lines, and there is no coexistence equilibrium.\n\n**5. Biological Interpretation**\nThe feasibility conditions provide deep insight into the competitive exclusion principle. The principle, in its simplest form, suggests that two species cannot coexist on the same limiting resource. The Lotka-Volterra model refines this.\nCoexistence is possible (specifically, stable coexistence) under the conditions derived in Case (a) above: $\\alpha_{12} < K_1/K_2$ and $\\alpha_{21} < K_2/K_1$.\nThis can be interpreted as follows:\n- The term $\\alpha_{12}$ quantifies the competitive effect of species $2$ on species $1$. The term $\\alpha_{21}$ is the effect of $1$ on $2$.\n- The condition $\\alpha_{12} < K_1/K_2$ is equivalent to $K_1/\\alpha_{12} > K_2$. The term $K_1/\\alpha_{12}$ represents the population size of species $2$ that would be equivalent to species $1$ reaching its own carrying capacity $K_1$. The inequality states that for species $1$ to persist, its environment, when viewed from the perspective of species $2$, must be able to support more than species $2$'s own carrying capacity $K_2$.\n- A more direct interpretation is found by relating interspecific competition to intraspecific competition. The coefficient of intraspecific competition for species $i$ on itself is implicitly $1$. The conditions for stable coexistence, $\\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} < 1$ along with the feasibility conditions, are met when each species inhibits its own growth (intraspecific competition) more strongly than it inhibits the growth of its competitor (interspecific competition).\n- When these conditions are violated, competitive exclusion is the outcome. For instance, if $K_1/K_2 > \\alpha_{12}$ but $K_2/K_1 < \\alpha_{21}$, species $1$ will always outcompete species $2$ (assuming both start with non-zero populations). This is because species $2$ suffers more from competition with species $1$ than it does from its own density dependence, while the reverse is true for species $1$. One species inevitably drives the other to extinction, demonstrating a clear case of competitive exclusion. The model thus formalizes the conditions under which the principle holds and, more importantly, when it can be circumvented.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{K_1 - K_2 \\alpha_{12}}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}} & \\frac{K_2 - K_1 \\alpha_{21}}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2793865"}, {"introduction": "While the Lotka-Volterra model is powerful, its competition coefficients are phenomenological.

It presents a standard model of consumer-resource dynamics from theoretical ecology and asks for a rigorous derivation of a well-established approximation, followed by a direct calculation. The model is self-contained, and all parameters are specified without ambiguity or contradiction.

The intrinsic growth rate is the per-capita growth rate in the absence of any competitors ($N_j=0$ for all $j$):\n$$\nr_{i} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{3} e_{\\alpha}\\,u_{i\\alpha}\\,R_{\\alpha}^{0} - m_{i} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{3} e_{\\alpha}\\,u_{i\\alpha}\\,\\frac{\\rho_{\\alpha}}{\\delta_{\\alpha}} - m_{i}\n$$\nThe competition coefficient matrix $B = (B_{ij})$ is given by the expression:\n$$\nB_{ij} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{3} e_{\\alpha}\\,u_{i\\alpha}\\,u_{j\\alpha}\\,\\frac{\\rho_{\\alpha}}{\\delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the required general expression for the competition coefficients. The diagonal elements $B_{ii}$ represent intraspecific competition (the effect of species $i$ on itself), while the off-diagonal elements $B_{ij}$ ($i \\neq j$) represent interspecific competition (the effect of species $j$ on species $i$).\n\nThe biological meaning of the off-diagonal entry $B_{12}$ is now clear from its derivation. It quantifies the per-capita negative impact of an individual of species $2$ on the growth rate of species $1$. This interaction is not direct but is mediated entirely through the consumption of shared resources. The term $u_{1\\alpha}u_{2\\alpha}$ in the sum for $B_{12}$ represents the niche overlap on resource $\\alpha$. If either species $1$ does not consume resource $\\alpha$ ($u_{1\\alpha}=0$) or species $2$ does not ($u_{2\\alpha}=0$), that resource contributes nothing to the competition between them. The magnitude of competition is thus fundamentally tied to the degree of niche overlap, a cornerstone of the competitive exclusion principle. The weighting factors $e_{\\alpha}$ and $\\rho_{\\alpha}/\\delta_{\\alpha}^{2}$ scale the competitive contribution of each resource by its energetic value and its availability/turnover dynamics, respectively. A resource with a low turnover rate (small $\\delta_{\\alpha}$) mediates stronger competition, as depletion by one species has a more lasting impact on its availability to another.\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for the matrix $B=(B_{ij})$ using the provided parameters:\n$u_{11}=1, u_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}, u_{13}=\\frac{1}{5}$\n$u_{21}=\\frac{1}{5}, u_{22}=1, u_{23}=\\frac{1}{2}$\n$e_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}, e_{2}=1, e_{3}=\\frac{1}{4}$\n$\\rho_{1}=6, \\rho_{2}=9, \\rho_{3}=12$\n$\\delta_{1}=3, \\delta_{2}=3, \\delta_{3}=4$\n\nFirst, we compute the coefficients for each resource, $k_{\\alpha} = e_{\\alpha}\\frac{\\rho_{\\alpha}}{\\delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}$:\n$k_{1} = e_{1}\\frac{\\rho_{1}}{\\delta_{1}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6}{3^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$k_{2} = e_{2}\\frac{\\rho_{2}}{\\delta_{2}^{2}} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{9}{3^{2}} = \\frac{9}{9} = 1$\n$k_{3} = e_{3}\\frac{\\rho_{3}}{\\delta_{3}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{4^{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n\nNow we compute the matrix elements $B_{ij} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{3} k_{\\alpha} u_{i\\alpha} u_{j\\alpha}$:\n$B_{11} = k_{1}u_{11}^{2} + k_{2}u_{12}^{2} + k_{3}u_{13}^{2} = (\\frac{1}{3})(1)^{2} + (1)(\\frac{1}{2})^{2} + (\\frac{3}{16})(\\frac{1}{5})^{2} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{16 \\cdot 25} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{400}$.

This exercise [@problem_id:2793817] explores this context-dependency using the powerful framework of resource-ratio theory, where competitive ability is defined by a species' ability to reduce resources. You will analyze how shifting the external resource supply point changes the equilibrium resource levels and can cross a critical threshold, altering the competitive outcome and illustrating the dynamic nature of the competitive exclusion principle.", "problem": "Consider a continuous culture (chemostat) with two substitutable resources, denoted by concentrations $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, and two competing species, $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$. Let the per capita net growth rate of species $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{B}\\}$ be linear in the two resources, $g_{i}(R_{1},R_{2}) = a_{i1} R_{1} + a_{i2} R_{2} - \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the dilution (loss) rate. The Zero Net Growth Isocline (ZNGI) of species $i$ is the set of $(R_{1},R_{2})$ satisfying $g_{i}(R_{1},R_{2})=0$. Resource dynamics in a chemostat impose a mass-balance constraint: at a single-species equilibrium of species $i$, the vector from the external supply point to the internal equilibrium resource point is parallel to the speciesâ€™ consumption vector $v_{i} = (v_{i1}, v_{i2})$.\n\nAssume the following parameter values, all in consistent resource units: $\\delta = 1$, $a_{\\mathrm{A},1} = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, $a_{\\mathrm{A},2} = \\tfrac{1}{4}$, $a_{\\mathrm{B},1} = \\tfrac{1}{5}$, $a_{\\mathrm{B},2} = \\tfrac{4}{5}$. Thus, the ZNGI of species $\\mathrm{A}$ is the line $\\tfrac{1}{2} R_{1} + \\tfrac{1}{4} R_{2} = 1$ and the ZNGI of species $\\mathrm{B}$ is the line $\\tfrac{1}{5} R_{1} + \\tfrac{4}{5} R_{2} = 1$. Let the consumption vectors be $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = (2,1)$ and $v_{\\mathrm{B}} = (1,2)$.\n\nThe external supply point $S(t)$ increases along a fixed ray through the origin according to $S(t) = t \\, u$ with direction $u = (1,1)$ and scalar magnitude $t > 0$.

No rounding is required; give an exact value.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of a critical supply point parameter, $t^{\\ast}$, at which the outcome of competition between two species in a chemostat changes. This problem will be solved by applying the principles of resource competition theory, specifically the $R^{\\ast}$ rule and its graphical interpretation involving Zero Net Growth Isoclines (ZNGIs) and consumption vectors.\n\nFirst, the givens must be formally stated.\nThe ZNGIs for species $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are given by the linear equations:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{A}}: \\frac{1}{2} R_{1} + \\frac{1}{4} R_{2} = 1$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{B}}: \\frac{1}{5} R_{1} + \\frac{4}{5} R_{2} = 1$$\nwhere $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are the resource concentrations. The dilution rate is $\\delta=1$.\nThe consumption vectors are $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = (2, 1)$ and $v_{\\mathrm{B}} = (1, 2)$.\nThe resource supply point is a function of a parameter $t > 0$: $S(t) = (t, t)$.\n\nThe central point of analysis is the intersection of the two ZNGIs, which represents the only resource level $(R_{1}, R_{2})$ at which both species have a net growth rate of zero. Let this point be $R_{\\mathrm{int}} = (R_{1, \\mathrm{int}}, R_{2, \\mathrm{int}})$. We solve the system of linear equations:\n$$2 R_{1} + R_{2} = 4$$\n$$R_{1} + 4 R_{2} = 5$$\nFrom the first equation, $R_{2} = 4 - 2 R_{1}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n$$R_{1} + 4(4 - 2 R_{1}) = 5 \\implies R_{1} + 16 - 8 R_{1} = 5 \\implies -7 R_{1} = -11 \\implies R_{1, \\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{11}{7}$$\nSubstituting back to find $R_{2, \\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$R_{2, \\mathrm{int}} = 4 - 2\\left(\\frac{11}{7}\\right) = \\frac{28 - 22}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$$\nThus, the ZNGIs intersect at $R_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\left(\\frac{11}{7}, \\frac{6}{7}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we establish the location of the single-species equilibrium resource point for each species, denoted $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, i}^{\\ast}(t)$, as a function of the supply parameter $t$. This point must satisfy two conditions:\n1. It must lie on the ZNGI of species $i$.\n2. The vector from the supply point $S(t)$ to the equilibrium point $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, i}^{\\ast}(t)$ must be parallel to the consumption vector $v_{i}$. This is expressed as $S(t) - R_{\\mathrm{eq}, i}^{\\ast}(t) = c_{i} v_{i}$ for some scalar $c_{i} > 0$. The condition $c_i > 0$ signifies that resources are being consumed, not produced.\n\nFor species $\\mathrm{A}$:\n$R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{A}}^{\\ast}(t)$ lies on the line passing through $S(t)=(t,t)$ with direction vector $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = (2,1)$. A point on this line can be written as $(t - 2c_{\\mathrm{A}}, t - c_{\\mathrm{A}})$. This point must also lie on $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(t - 2c_{\\mathrm{A}}) + \\frac{1}{4}(t - c_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 1$$\n$$2(t - 2c_{\\mathrm{A}}) + (t - c_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 4$$\n$$3t - 5c_{\\mathrm{A}} = 4 \\implies c_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{3t - 4}{5}$$\nFor species $\\mathrm{A}$ to survive, its population must be positive, which requires consumption, so $c_{\\mathrm{A}} > 0$. This implies $3t-4 > 0$, or $t > \\frac{4}{3}$.\nThe equilibrium resource point is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{A}}^{\\ast}(t) = \\left(t - 2\\left(\\frac{3t-4}{5}\\right), t - \\left(\\frac{3t-4}{5}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5t-6t+8}{5}, \\frac{5t-3t+4}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{8-t}{5}, \\frac{2t+4}{5}\\right)$$\n\nFor species $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t)$ lies on the line $(t - c_{\\mathrm{B}}, t - 2c_{\\mathrm{B}})$ from $v_{\\mathrm{B}}=(1,2)$. This point must lie on $L_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{5}(t - c_{\\mathrm{B}}) + \\frac{4}{5}(t - 2c_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 1$$\n$$(t - c_{\\mathrm{B}}) + 4(t - 2c_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 5$$\n$$5t - 9c_{\\mathrm{B}} = 5 \\implies c_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{5t - 5}{9}$$\nFor species $\\mathrm{B}$ to survive, $c_{\\mathrm{B}} > 0$, which implies $5t-5 > 0$, or $t > 1$.\nThe equilibrium resource point is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t) = \\left(t - \\left(\\frac{5t-5}{9}\\right), t - 2\\left(\\frac{5t-5}{9}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{9t-5t+5}{9}, \\frac{9t-10t+10}{9}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4t+5}{9}, \\frac{10-t}{9}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the competitive winner switches when the single-species resource equilibrium crosses the intersection of the two ZNGIs. This means we are looking for the value of $t$ where either $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{A}}^{\\ast}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{int}}$ or $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\n\nCase 1: $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{A}}^{\\ast}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{int}}$\n$$\\left(\\frac{8-t}{5}, \\frac{2t+4}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{7}, \\frac{6}{7}\\right)$$\nFrom the first component: $\\frac{8-t}{5} = \\frac{11}{7} \\implies 56 - 7t = 55 \\implies 7t = 1 \\implies t = \\frac{1}{7}$.\nThis value of $t$ is not in the survival range for species $\\mathrm{A}$ ($t > \\frac{4}{3}$). Thus, this scenario is not physically realized.\n\nCase 2: $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{int}}$\n$$\\left(\\frac{4t+5}{9}, \\frac{10-t}{9}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{7}, \\frac{6}{7}\\right)$$\nFrom the first component: $\\frac{4t+5}{9} = \\frac{11}{7} \\implies 7(4t+5) = 9(11) \\implies 28t + 35 = 99 \\implies 28t = 64 \\implies t = \\frac{64}{28} = \\frac{16}{7}$.\nLet us verify with the second component: $\\frac{10-t}{9} = \\frac{6}{7} \\implies 7(10-t) = 9(6) \\implies 70 - 7t = 54 \\implies 7t = 16 \\implies t = \\frac{16}{7}$.\nThe components yield consistent values for $t$. The value $t^{\\ast} = \\frac{16}{7} \\approx 2.28$ lies within the survival range for species $\\mathrm{B}$ ($t > 1$). It is also in the survival range for species A ($t > 4/3 \\approx 1.33$), so both species can potentially exist. This is the critical value we seek.\n\nTo confirm the \"switch\", we analyze the competitive outcome on either side of $t^{\\ast}$. The winner is the species that can reduce resources to a level at which its competitor cannot grow. Species B wins if species A cannot invade an environment set by species B, i.e., $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}) < 0$. Coexistence occurs if they can invade each other. The switch in outcome occurs when $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast})$ changes sign.\nLet's evaluate $g_{\\mathrm{A}}$ at $R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t)$:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{A}}(R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t)) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{1, \\mathrm{B}}(t) + \\frac{1}{4} R_{2, \\mathrm{B}}(t) - 1$$\n$$g_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4t+5}{9}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{10-t}{9}\\right) - 1$$\n$$g_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{36}\\left(2(4t+5) + (10-t)\\right) - 1 = \\frac{8t+10+10-t}{36} - 1 = \\frac{7t+20}{36} - 1 = \\frac{7t-16}{36}$$\nThe sign of $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}(t))$ is determined by the sign of $7t-16$.\n- If $t < \\frac{16}{7}$, $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}) < 0$. Species A cannot invade an equilibrium set by B. For the relevant range $t \\in (\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{16}{7})$, species B is the competitive winner.\n- If $t > \\frac{16}{7}$, $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(R_{\\mathrm{eq}, \\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}) > 0$. Species A can invade an equilibrium set by B. For this range of $t$, this leads to coexistence.\n\nTherefore, $t^{\\ast} = \\frac{16}{7}$ is the point where the competitive outcome switches from exclusion of A by B to coexistence. This corresponds precisely to the condition that species B's single-species equilibrium point crosses the ZNGI of species A. The problem asks for the smallest such positive value. Since the other potential switch point at $t=1/7$ was invalid, $t^{\\ast}=\\frac{16}{7}$ is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{16}{7}}$$", "id": "2793817"}]}
