We can express this relationship as:\n$$r(N) = aN + b$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined.\n\nWe use the two provided boundary conditions to solve for these constants.\nFirst, at zero density ($N=0$), the per-capita growth rate is the intrinsic maximum, $r(0) = r_{\\max}$. Substituting this into our linear equation:\n$$r(0) = a(0) + b = r_{\\max}$$\nThis immediately gives $b = r_{\\max}$.\n\nSecond, at the carrying capacity ($N=K$), the population growth ceases, which means the per-capita growth rate is zero, $r(K) = 0$.
