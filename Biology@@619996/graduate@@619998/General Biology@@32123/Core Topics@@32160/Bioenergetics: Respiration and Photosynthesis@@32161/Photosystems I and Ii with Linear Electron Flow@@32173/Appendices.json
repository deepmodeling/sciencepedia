Since $4$ electrons are generated per $\\mathrm{O}_2$ evolved, the number of protons pumped by the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex is:\n$$ \\text{Protons from cytochrome } b_6f = \\left(\\frac{4 \\text{ H}^+}{2 \\text{ e}^-}\\right) \\times (4 \\text{ e}^- \\text{ per } \\mathrm{O}_2) = 8 \\text{ H}^+ \\text{ per } \\mathrm{O}_2 $$\n\nThe total number of protons accumulated in the thylakoid lumen per $\\mathrm{O}_2$ evolved is the sum of protons from both sources.\n$$ (\\text{Total } \\mathrm{H}^+)_{\\text{lumen}} = (\\text{H}^+ \\text{ from } \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}) + (\\text{H}^+ \\text{ from cytochrome } b_6f) = 4 + 8 = 12 $$\nThus, for each molecule of $\\mathrm{O}_2$ evolved, a total of $12$ protons are translocated into the lumen.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the ATP yield from the proton gradient.\nThese $12$ protons can flow back to the stroma through the ATP synthase, driving ATP synthesis. The amount of ATP produced is the total number of protons available divided by the number of protons required per ATP (the $\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio).\n\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{\\mathrm{O}_2} = \\frac{\\text{Total protons accumulated per } \\mathrm{O}_2}{\\text{Protons required per ATP}} = \\frac{12}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{H}^+}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)} $$\n\nUsing our previously calculated ratio $\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{ATP} = \\frac{14}{3}$:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{\\mathrm{O}_2} = \\frac{12}{\\frac{14}{3}} = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{14} = \\frac{36}{14} $$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{\\mathrm{O}_2} = \\frac{18}{7} $$\n\nThis is the second required value.\n\nThe problem asks for the two results, $\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{ATP}$ and $\\mathrm{ATP}/\\mathrm{O}_2$, to be presented as a single row matrix. The values are $\\frac{14}{3}$ and $\\frac{18}{7}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{14}{3} & \\frac{18}{7} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2823457"}]}
