Consequently, the movement of protons from the IMS to the matrix is a spontaneous, exergonic process. This spontaneous flow down the electrochemical gradient is what drives the ATP synthase enzyme. The magnitude of approximately $-200\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ represents a substantial electromotive force available for cellular work.\n\nIn the case of this mitochondrion, the total proton motive force of $\\approx -195\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ is composed of an electrical component $\\Delta \\psi = -160\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and a chemical component equivalent to $-35\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (from $-0.05916 \\times 0.6$). The electrical potential difference is the dominant contributor, accounting for approximately $160/195 \\approx 82\\%$ of the total force.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the situation in chloroplasts during photosynthesis. Protons are pumped from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen. The thylakoid membrane is permeable to other ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$), which move to neutralize the charge separation. As a result, the transmembrane electrical potential, $\\Delta \\psi$, across the thylakoid membrane is very small or near zero. However, this ion movement leads to a very large pH gradient ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ can be as high as $3-4$ units), as the lumen becomes highly acidic relative to the stroma. Therefore, in chloroplasts, the proton motive force is comprised almost entirely of the chemical component ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ term), whereas in mitochondria, it is dominated by the electrical component ($\\Delta \\psi$ term).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.195}$$", "id": "2784492"}, {"introduction": "With a quantitative understanding of the proton motive force, we can now investigate its origin: the vectorial translocation of protons coupled to redox reactions.

We will, therefore, proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimal proton motive force, $\\Delta p_{\\min}$, required for ATP synthesis in a chloroplast and a mitochondrion. The condition for the minimal threshold is that the Gibbs free energy required for ATP synthesis, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is exactly balanced by the energy provided by the translocation of protons down their electrochemical gradient, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$. This condition is expressed as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{syn}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H}^+} = 0$, or more usefully, the energy available from the proton gradient, which is $-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$, must equal the energy cost of ATP synthesis, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{syn}}$.\n\nFirst, we define the Gibbs free energy for the synthesis reaction $\\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{Pi} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{H_2O}$.

Assuming activities are equal to molar concentrations and the standard state concentration is $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$, the quotient is:\n$$ Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{a_{\\mathrm{ADP}} a_{\\mathrm{Pi}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]/C^{\\circ}}{([\\mathrm{ADP}]/C^{\\circ})([\\mathrm{Pi}]/C^{\\circ})} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]C^{\\circ}}{[\\mathrm{ADP}][\\mathrm{Pi}]} $$\nWhen concentrations are expressed in units of Molarity ($\\mathrm{M}$), this simplifies numerically to $Q = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]}{[\\mathrm{ADP}][\\mathrm{Pi}]}$, with the resulting value being dimensionless.\n\nSecond, we define the energy provided by the proton motive force. The work done by translocating $n$ moles of protons across an electrochemical potential difference (the proton motive force, $\\Delta p$) is given by $W_{\\mathrm{H}^+} = n F \\Delta p$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant. This is the energy made available to drive ATP synthesis. For one mole of ATP synthesized, the number of protons required is $n_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$. The available energy is thus $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{available}} = n_{\\mathrm{H}^+} F \\Delta p$.\n\nThe minimal condition is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{syn}} = n_{\\mathrm{H}^+} F \\Delta p_{\\min}$.

The ATP synthase requires $c$ protons to pass through for one full $360^{\\circ}$ rotation of its rotor, which synthesizes $3$ molecules of ATP. The number of protons for synthesis is $n_{\\mathrm{synth}} = c/3$. Additional costs may arise from metabolite transport.\n\nFor the chloroplast:\nThe $c$-ring has $c_{\\mathrm{chl}} = 14$ subunits. The proton cost for synthesis is $n_{\\mathrm{synth, chl}} = c_{\\mathrm{chl}}/3 = 14/3$. Phosphate transport is electroneutral, so there is no additional proton cost.\nThus, $n_{\\mathrm{H^+, chl}} = 14/3$.\n\nFor the mitochondrion:\nThe $c$-ring has $c_{\\mathrm{mit}} = 8$ subunits. The proton cost for synthesis is $n_{\\mathrm{synth, mit}} = c_{\\mathrm{mit}}/3 = 8/3$. In addition, the problem states that the import of one inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{Pi}$) via the phosphate/proton symporter costs $1$ proton per ATP.\nThus, the total proton cost is $n_{\\mathrm{H^+, mit}} = n_{\\mathrm{synth, mit}} + n_{\\mathrm{transport}} = 8/3 + 1 = 11/3$.\n\nNow we proceed with the numerical calculation for each organelle, ensuring consistent units. We use $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 30.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} = 30500\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$, $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$, and $F = 96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}} = 96485\\ \\mathrm{J\\ V^{-1}\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\nCalculation for the Chloroplast:\nGiven values: $T_{\\mathrm{chl}} = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2.8\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, $[\\mathrm{ADP}] = 0.26\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 0.26 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, and $[\\mathrm{Pi}] = 18\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 18 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe reaction quotient is:\n$$ Q_{\\mathrm{chl}} = \\frac{2.8 \\times 10^{-3}}{(0.26 \\times 10^{-3})(18 \\times 10^{-3})} \\approx 598.29 $$\nThe Gibbs free energy of synthesis is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{syn, chl}} = 30500 + (8.314)(298) \\ln(598.29) \\approx 30500 + (2477.57)(6.3941) \\approx 30500 + 15842.1 \\approx 46342.1\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThe minimal proton motive force is:\n$$ \\Delta p_{\\min, \\mathrm{chl}} = \\frac{46342.1}{(14/3) \\times 96485} = \\frac{46342.1}{450263.3} \\approx 0.10292\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nConverting to millivolts and rounding to four significant figures, we get $102.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nCalculation for the Mitochondrion:\nGiven values: $T_{\\mathrm{mit}} = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 3.2\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, $[\\mathrm{ADP}] = 0.004\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 4 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, and $[\\mathrm{Pi}] = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe reaction quotient is:\n$$ Q_{\\mathrm{mit}} = \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{-3}}{(4 \\times 10^{-6})(1.2 \\times 10^{-3})} = \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{-3}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 6.6667 \\times 10^5 $$\nThe Gibbs free energy of synthesis is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{syn, mit}} = 30500 + (8.314)(310) \\ln(6.6667 \\times 10^5) \\approx 30500 + (2577.34)(13.4101) \\approx 30500 + 34560.8 \\approx 65060.8\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThe minimal proton motive force is:\n$$ \\Delta p_{\\min, \\mathrm{mit}} = \\frac{65060.8}{(11/3) \\times 96485} = \\frac{65060.8}{353778.3} \\approx 0.1839\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nConverting to millivolts and rounding to four significant figures, we get $183.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe results show that a significantly higher proton motive force is required in the mitochondrion than in the chloroplast to achieve ATP synthesis under the specified steady-state conditions. This is primarily a consequence of the much higher phosphorylation potential (ratio of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ to $[\\mathrm{ADP}][\\mathrm{Pi}]$) maintained in the mitochondrial matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 102.9 & 183.9 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2784434"}]}
