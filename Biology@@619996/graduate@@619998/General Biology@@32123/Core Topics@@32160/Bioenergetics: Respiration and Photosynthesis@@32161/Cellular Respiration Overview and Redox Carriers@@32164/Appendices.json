This shuttle transfers the reducing power of cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial matrix as NADH. Therefore, the two cytosolic NADH effectively become two additional matrix NADH for the purpose of proton pumping and ATP generation. The oxidative phosphorylation yield is thus:\n- From matrix NADH (pyruvate dehydrogenase + TCA): $8 \\times 2.5 = 20$ ATP.\n- From cytosolic NADH via malate–aspartate as matrix NADH: $2 \\times 2.5 = 5$ ATP.\n- From matrix FADH$_2$: $2 \\times 1.5 = 3$ ATP.\nAdding substrate-level phosphorylation:\n- Glycolysis: $2$ ATP.\n- TCA (via GTP): $2$ ATP.\nSumming all contributions gives the total ATP per glucose under the malate–aspartate shuttle:\n$$20 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 32.$$\n\nCase (b): Glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle.

Electrons enter the ETC at the level of ubiquinone, bypassing Complex I and therefore follow the FADH$_2$-equivalent pathway with $6$ protons pumped per pair of electrons. Hence, each cytosolic NADH yields the same ATP as a matrix FADH$_2$, namely $1.5$ ATP.

The subunit numbers for the $c$-ring ($12$ and $10$) fall within the known biological range for different organisms. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information and a clear idealization (tight coupling) to derive a unique, quantitative answer. The question is objective and requires application of first principles of bioenergetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the \"gearing ratio\" of the ATP synthase motor. The stoichiometry of protons translocated per ATP synthesized ($\\mathrm{H^+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$) is determined by the number of proton-binding subunits in the $c$-ring ($n_c$) and the number of catalytic sites in the $F_1$ head that produce ATP per revolution.\n\nThe problem states that a full $360^\\circ$ rotation of the rotor is coupled to the synthesis of $3$ molecules of ATP. For the $c$-ring to complete one full $360^\\circ$ rotation, each of its $n_c$ subunits must translocate one proton across the membrane. Therefore, $n_c$ protons must be translocated to produce $3$ ATP molecules.\n\nThe proton-to-ATP stoichiometry is thus given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{H^+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of protons per revolution}}{\\text{Number of ATP per revolution}} = \\frac{n_c}{3} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the stoichiometry for the native bacterium, where $n_c = 12$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{H^+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)_{\\text{native}} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the stoichiometry for the engineered bacterium, where $n_c = 10$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{H^+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)_{\\text{engineered}} = \\frac{10}{3} $$\nThe $\\mathrm{H^+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio therefore decreases from $4$ to $10/3$.\n\nNow, we must analyze the implication for adaptation to low-energy environments, defined as having a low proton motive force (pmf, denoted $\\Delta p$). For ATP synthesis to be thermodynamically favorable, the free energy input from the translocation of protons must exceed or equal the free energy required to synthesize ATP ($\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}$).\nLet $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$ be the free energy change associated with the transport of one mole of protons down the electrochemical gradient. This is directly proportional to the pmf: $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = -F \\Delta p$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nThe condition for ATP synthesis is:\n$$ \\left| \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{H^+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\right) \\cdot \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H^+}} \\right| \\ge |\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}| $$\nSubstituting the expressions for stoichiometry and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$:\n$$ \\frac{n_c}{3} \\cdot F \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}} $$\nFrom this inequality, we can find the minimum pmf ($\\Delta p_{\\text{min}}$) required to drive ATP synthesis:\n$$ \\Delta p_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}}{n_c \\cdot F} $$\nThis equation shows that the minimum required pmf is inversely proportional to the number of $c$-subunits: $\\Delta p_{\\text{min}} \\propto 1/n_c$.\n\nIn this problem, the number of $c$-subunits is decreased from $n_c = 12$ to $n_c = 10$. As a consequence, the minimum required pmf, $\\Delta p_{\\text{min}}$, must increase. The engineered synthase is more efficient in terms of protons (it requires fewer protons per ATP), but this efficiency comes at the cost of requiring a higher energy input per proton, which means a higher pmf. In a low-energy (low pmf) environment, the cell may be unable to generate a pmf high enough to meet this new, more stringent requirement. Therefore, adaptation to low-energy environments is impaired.\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A.

This is a decrease. This part is correct.\n- Implication for adaptation: As derived above, decreasing $n_c$ increases $\\Delta p_{\\text{min}}$, meaning a higher pmf is required. This impairs the ability to function in low-pmf environments. This part is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B.

It decreases, not increases.\n- Implication for adaptation: The conclusion is incorrect. Adaptation is impaired, not improved, and the synthase requires a higher, not lower, pmf.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.

While it is true that with a smaller $n_c$, each proton drives a larger angular rotation ($360^\\circ / n_c$), the overall thermodynamic requirement $\\Delta p_{\\text{min}} \\propto 1/n_c$ dictates that a higher, not lower, pmf is needed. Adaptation is impaired, not improved.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The $\\mathrm{H^+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio is unchanged by $c$-ring size, and adaptation to low-energy environments is unaffected because the $F_{\\mathrm{1}}$ sector fixes the coupling.**\n- Change in $\\mathrm{H^+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio: This is fundamentally incorrect. The stoichiometry is directly dependent on $n_c$, the $c$-ring size, via the relation $\\mathrm{H^+}/\\mathrm{ATP} = n_c/3$.\n- Implication for adaptation: Since the premise is false, the conclusion is also false. The $F_1$ sector dictates ATP per turn, but the $F_{\\mathrm{o}}$ sector's $c$-ring dictates protons per turn. Both determine the coupling and thus the adaptation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2783437"}]}
