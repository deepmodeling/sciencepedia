An identifiability constraint satisfied by these data is that the substrate concentrations span the Michaelis constant ($[S]_0/K_{\\mathrm{M}} = 1/3, 1, 3$), which ensures the data are sensitive to the curvature of the hyperbolic rate law and thus allows for the separate estimation of both $V_{\\max}$ and $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$. If all $[S]_0 \\ll K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies to the linear approximation $v_0 \\approx (V_{\\max}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})[S]_0$, and the identifiability constraint that allows for the separate determination of $V_{\\max}$ and $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ would be violated because only their ratio, the specificity constant, could be determined from the slope of $v_0$ versus $[S]_0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{24.0}\n$$", "id": "2797240"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static structures, enzymes are dynamic machines whose movements are finely tuned for catalysis.

The analysis must be grounded in first principles of conformational entropy, free energy, and chemical kinetics.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\nFirst, I must validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Enzyme System:** An enzyme with a mobile surface loop that closes over the active site upon substrate binding.\n- **Catalysis:** The closed conformation is the catalytically competent state. The chemical step occurs only in this state.\n- **Wild-Type (WT) Enzyme:** Possesses a glycine residue at position $128$ (Gly128) at the loop's apex.\n- **WT Apo State:** The loop is highly dynamic, sampling many conformations (high conformational entropy). This is indicated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data.\n- **WT Closed State:** In the enzyme-substrate complex, the loop forms a turn. The backbone dihedral angles at position $128$ are conformationally accessible to proline. The backbone amide of Gly128 is not involved in a hydrogen bond.\n- **WT Kinetics:** At saturating substrate, loop closure is the rate-limiting step of catalysis.\n- **Mutation:** Gly128 is replaced by proline (Gly128Pro).\n- **Mutant Constraint:** The proline at position $128$ does not cause steric clashes in the closed conformation.\n- **Assumptions:** Temperature $T$ is constant.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of protein biophysics and enzymology. The distinct conformational properties of glycine (high flexibility) and proline (high rigidity, propensity for turns) are central to the problem and are correctly represented. The concepts of conformational entropy, free energy landscapes ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$), and the relationship between activation free energy ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$) and reaction rate ($k \\propto e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/(k_B T)}$) are fundamental and correctly invoked. The kinetic scheme described (conformational change being rate-limiting) is a well-documented mechanism for many enzymes (e.g., adenylate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase). The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear initial state (WT enzyme), a specific perturbation (Gly128Pro mutation), and sufficient constraints to allow for a qualitative but unique and logical prediction. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is described using precise, objective scientific language. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The provided information is internally consistent and sufficient. For example, it pre-emptively rules out a potential complication by stating that the backbone amide of Gly128 does not form a hydrogen bond, which is relevant because proline lacks this hydrogen donor. It also confirms that the proline residue can be accommodated in the closed state without steric clashes.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated problem in biophysical chemistry that requires the application of first principles. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will proceed from first principles, connecting the structural change (Gly $\\to$ Pro) to changes in conformational entropy, free energy, and finally to the macroscopic kinetic parameters $k_{cat}$ and $K_M$.\n\n1.  **Conformational Properties of Glycine vs. Proline:**\n    - Glycine's side chain is a single hydrogen atom, affording it the largest conformational flexibility of all amino acids. This allows the polypeptide backbone at a glycine position to sample a wide range of dihedral angles ($\\phi$, $\\psi$). The problem states the WT apo enzyme loop is \"highly dynamic,\" consistent with the presence of Gly$128$. This corresponds to a high conformational entropy, $S_{apo,WT}$, for the loop in the unbound state.\n    - Proline's side chain is cyclized and covalently bonded to its backbone amide nitrogen. This restricts the $\\phi$ dihedral angle to a narrow range (approximately $-60^{\\circ}$), making the backbone at a proline position conformationally rigid. The problem states that the closed loop forms a turn with dihedral angles \"accessible to proline,\" meaning the conformation favored by proline resembles the conformation of the functional, closed state. This rigidity drastically reduces the number of accessible conformations in the apo state. Thus, the conformational entropy of the loop in the apo state of the mutant, $S_{apo,mutant}$, is significantly lower than that of the WT: $S_{apo,mutant} < S_{apo,WT}$.\n\n2.  **Free Energy of Loop Closure:**\n    The catalytic cycle involves a conformational change from an ensemble of open states ($E_{open}$) to a specific closed state ($E_{closed}$). The free energy change for this step is $\\Delta G_{closure} = \\Delta H_{closure} - T\\Delta S_{closure}$. The key term here is the change in conformational entropy, $\\Delta S_{closure} = S_{closed} - S_{open}$.\n    - **For the WT enzyme:** The transition is from a high-entropy apo state ($S_{apo,WT}$) to a low-entropy closed state ($S_{closed}$). The entropy change, $\\Delta S_{closure,WT} = S_{closed} - S_{apo,WT}$, is a large negative value. This represents a significant entropic penalty for loop closure, making the free energy contribution ($-T\\Delta S_{closure,WT}$) large and positive (unfavorable).\n    - **For the Gly128Pro mutant:** The transition is from a low-entropy apo state ($S_{apo,mutant}$) to the low-entropy closed state ($S_{closed}$). Because $S_{apo,mutant}$ is much lower than $S_{apo,WT}$, the magnitude of the negative entropy change is smaller: $|\\Delta S_{closure,mutant}| < |\\Delta S_{closure,WT}|$. This means the entropic penalty for loop closure is *reduced*. The mutation essentially \"pre-pays\" part of the entropic cost by restricting the apo state ensemble. This lowers the overall free energy of the closed state relative to the open state.\n\n3.  **Effect on $k_{cat}$:**\n    The problem states that at saturating substrate, loop closure is the rate-limiting step. Therefore, the turnover number $k_{cat}$ is determined by the rate of this conformational change, $k_{cat} \\approx k_{closure}$. The rate of any elementary step is inversely and exponentially related to its activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$. The mutation lowers the free energy of the product of this step (the $E_{closed}S$ state) relative to the reactant (the $E_{open}S$ state). According to the Hammond postulate, this will also lower the energy of the transition state, thus decreasing the activation free energy barrier, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{closure}$. A lower $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ results in a higher rate constant. Therefore, the Gly128Pro mutation is predicted to **increase $k_{cat}$**.\n\n4.  **Effect on $K_M$:**\n    The Michaelis constant, $K_M$, is often interpreted as a measure of the apparent affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, with a lower $K_M$ indicating higher affinity. The overall binding process can be seen as the equilibrium between the free enzyme and substrate and the catalytically active, closed complex: $E + S \\rightleftharpoons E_{closed}S$. The stability of this complex is determined by the overall free energy change, $\\Delta G_{binding}$. By reducing the entropic penalty of loop closure, the Gly128Pro mutation makes the formation of the $E_{closed}S$ state more thermodynamically favorable. This strengthens the overall effective binding of the substrate. A stronger effective binding is reflected as a **decrease in $K_M$**.\n\n5.  **Effect on Catalytic Efficiency ($k_{cat}/K_M$):**\n    Catalytic efficiency is given by the ratio $k_{cat}/K_M$. Based on the analysis above, $k_{cat}$ increases and $K_M$ decreases. Both changes contribute to an increase in the ratio.\n    $$ \\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M} = \\frac{(\\text{increased value})}{(\\text{decreased value})} = \\text{increased value} $$\n    Therefore, the Gly128Pro mutation is predicted to **increase $k_{cat}/K_M$**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The loop becomes more conformationally restricted and biased toward the closed turn, reducing the entropic penalty upon closure; this increases apparent affinity (decreases $K_M$) and increases $k_{cat}$, raising $k_{cat}/K_M$.**\n- This statement accurately describes the consequences of replacing the flexible glycine with the rigid proline. The loop is restricted (lower entropy in apo state), which reduces the entropic cost of adopting the ordered closed state. This reduction in the free energy barrier of the rate-limiting step increases $k_{cat}$. The stabilization of the closed, bound state relative to the unbound state increases the apparent affinity, lowering $K_M$. The combined effect is an increase in $k_{cat}/K_M$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The loop becomes more rigid, but the loss of a backbone amide hydrogen at position 128 disrupts an essential hydrogen bond in the closed state; this decreases affinity (increases $K_M$) and decreases $k_{cat}$, lowering $k_{cat}/K_M$.**\n- This option posits a detrimental effect due to the loss of a hydrogen bond donor. However, the problem statement explicitly invalidates this premise: \"the backbone amide at position 128 does not donate a hydrogen bond ... in the closed state.\" The entire reasoning of this option is built upon a factually incorrect premise according to the givens.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The loop becomes too rigid to undergo induced fit, reducing necessary conformational sampling; both $K_M$ and $k_{cat}$ decrease, and $k_{cat}/K_M$ decreases.**\n- This option misinterprets the effect of rigidity. The proline-induced rigidity does not prevent the loop from closing; rather, it biases the conformational ensemble towards the closed state, as the closed state's geometry is favorable for proline. It lowers the energy barrier to closure, rather than creating a new one. This is a classic example of conformational selection being enhanced, not hindered. The conclusion that rigidity is necessarily detrimental is incorrect in this context.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because position 128 is not a catalytic residue, replacing glycine with proline will not measurably affect $K_M$, $k_{cat}$, or $k_{cat}/K_M$.**\n- This reflects a naive understanding of enzyme function. It incorrectly assumes that only residues directly involved in the chemical transformation can affect catalysis. The dynamics of the entire protein, particularly elements like mobile loops, are often fundamentally coupled to the catalytic cycle. Since loop closure is given as the rate-limiting step, a mutation at the apex of this loop that dramatically alters its flexibility (position $128$) will have a direct and significant impact on the kinetic parameters $k_{cat}$ and $K_M$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2797230"}, {"introduction": "The intricate dance of catalysis often involves a network of interacting residues that work in concert.

It is a well-defined problem in biophysical chemistry that can be solved through logical deduction and calculation. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the interaction free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$, between two residues, $X$ and $Y$, in the context of ligand binding. This is achieved using a double mutant cycle. First, we relate the standard free energy of binding, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, to the given dissociation constant, $K_d$. The fundamental base states $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -RT \\ln K_{a}$ and $K_{a} = 1/K_{d}$. Substituting the second relation into the first yields:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{d}}\\right) = RT \\ln K_{d}\n$$\nWe can define the standard binding free energy for each of the four enzyme variants:\n1.  Wild Type (WT): $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = RT \\ln K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$\n2.  Mutant $X \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ala}$ ($X$): $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{X} = RT \\ln K_{d}^{X}$\n3.  Mutant $Y \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ala}$ ($Y$): $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{Y} = RT \\ln K_{d}^{Y}$\n4.  Double Mutant ($XY$): $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{XY} = RT \\ln K_{d}^{XY}$\n\nThe interaction energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$, quantifies the non-additivity of the effects of the individual mutations on binding affinity. It measures whether the effect of mutating residue $X$ on ligand binding is different in the presence of the wild-type residue $Y$ compared to the mutant residue $Y \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ala}$.\n\nThe effect of mutating residue $X$ on the binding free energy in the wild-type background (where $Y$ is present) is the difference in binding free energies between mutant $X$ and wild type:\n$$\n\\Delta (\\Delta G)_{X, \\text{WT background}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{X} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nSimilarly, the effect of mutating residue $X$ on the binding free energy in the mutant $Y$ background is the difference in binding free energies between the double mutant $XY$ and the single mutant $Y$:\n$$\n\\Delta (\\Delta G)_{X, \\text{Y background}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{Y}\n$$\nThe interaction free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$, is the difference between these two effects. It represents the thermodynamic cycle where one moves from WT to X, then to XY, and compares this to moving from WT to Y, then to XY. The non-closure of the simple additive model gives the interaction energy.\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\Delta (\\Delta G)_{X, \\text{Y background}} - \\Delta (\\Delta G)_{X, \\text{WT background}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{Y}) - (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{X} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nRearranging this expression gives the symmetric form for the interaction energy:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{X} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{Y}\n$$\nIf $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$, the effects of the mutations are additive, and the residues are considered non-interacting with respect to ligand binding. A non-zero value indicates energetic coupling.\n\nTo derive the expression in terms of the dissociation constants, we substitute $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = RT \\ln K_{d}$ into the equation for $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = (RT \\ln K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) + (RT \\ln K_{d}^{XY}) - (RT \\ln K_{d}^{X}) - (RT \\ln K_{d}^{Y})\n$$\nFactoring out the term $RT$ and applying the properties of logarithms ($\\ln a + \\ln b = \\ln(ab)$ and $\\ln a - \\ln b = \\ln(a/b)$):\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = RT \\left[ (\\ln K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} + \\ln K_{d}^{XY}) - (\\ln K_{d}^{X} + \\ln K_{d}^{Y}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = RT \\left[ \\ln(K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} K_{d}^{XY}) - \\ln(K_{d}^{X} K_{d}^{Y}) \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final explicit expression for the interaction free energy:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} K_{d}^{XY}}{K_{d}^{X} K_{d}^{Y}} \\right)\n$$\nNow we proceed to the numerical evaluation. The values are given as:\n$T = 298.15$ K\n$R = 8.314462618$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 50$ nM\n$K_{d}^{X} = 200$ nM\n$K_{d}^{Y} = 150$ nM\n$K_{d}^{XY} = 2000$ nM\n\nThe ratio of dissociation constants can be calculated directly, as the units (nM) will cancel:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} K_{d}^{XY}}{K_{d}^{X} K_{d}^{Y}} = \\frac{50 \\times 2000}{200 \\times 150} = \\frac{100000}{30000} = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this ratio and the constants into the expression for $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} = (8.314462618 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\times (298.15 \\text{ K}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the product $RT$:\n$$\nRT = (8.314462618)(298.15) \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\approx 2478.92 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, calculate the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) \\approx 1.20397\n$$\nNow, compute $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} \\approx (2478.92 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}) \\times (1.20397) \\approx 2984.54 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of kJ mol$^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} \\approx 2.98454 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}} \\approx 2.985 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$ indicates that the combined destabilizing effect of the two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects, a phenomenon known as synergistic destabilization or negative cooperativity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.985}$$", "id": "2797234"}]}
