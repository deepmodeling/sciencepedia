Two physiological shuttles achieve electron transfer from cytosol to mitochondria: the glycerol phosphate shuttle and the malate-aspartate shuttle. Assume the following scientifically standard and operationally defined phosphate-to-oxygen ratios (P/O; adenosine triphosphate per reducing equivalent delivered to the electron transport chain): matrix nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) yields $2.5$ ATP per NADH reoxidized, and ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q, often produced from flavin adenine dinucleotide in its reduced form, $\\text{FADH}_2$) yields $1.5$ ATP per ubiquinol reoxidized. Assume that the cost of adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate carrier is already subsumed into these P/O values, that the glycerol phosphate shuttle transfers cytosolic reducing equivalents to the mitochondrial electron transport chain at the ubiquinol entry point without direct ATP hydrolysis, and that the malate-aspartate shuttle transfers them to matrix NADH without direct ATP hydrolysis. Also assume no carbon or reducing equivalent diversion to biosynthesis and that glucose is converted to pyruvate without fermentation.\n\nStarting only from the core stoichiometry of glycolysis (one molecule of glucose yields two molecules of pyruvate, two molecules of ATP net by substrate-level phosphorylation, and two molecules of cytosolic NADH), and the given P/O values, compute the net ATP yield from the glycolytic stage per mole of glucose when cytosolic NADH is reoxidized via (i) the glycerol phosphate shuttle and (ii) the malate-aspartate shuttle.

The provided data are standard and consistent. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe total net yield of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the glycolytic pathway under aerobic conditions, denoted as $N_{ATP, net}$, can be expressed as the sum of ATP generated via substrate-level phosphorylation, $N_{ATP, slp}$, and ATP generated from the oxidative phosphorylation of cytosolic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), $N_{ATP, oxphos}$.\n$$N_{ATP, net} = N_{ATP, slp} + N_{ATP, oxphos}$$\nThe problem statement provides the stoichiometry for the conversion of $1$ mole of glucose to $2$ moles of pyruvate. This process yields a net of $2$ moles of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation and produces $2$ moles of cytosolic NADH.\nTherefore, $N_{ATP, slp} = 2$.\n\nThe value of $N_{ATP, oxphos}$ depends on the shuttle mechanism used to transfer reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH into the mitochondria. We must evaluate two distinct cases as specified.\n\nCase (i): The Glycerol Phosphate Shuttle\n\nThe glycerol phosphate shuttle transfers the reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH to mitochondrial flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), producing FADH$_2$. In the context of the electron transport chain, this is equivalent to the formation of ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme $Q$). The problem specifies that the phosphate-to-oxygen ratio ($P/O$) for ubiquinol reoxidation is $1.5$ moles of ATP per mole of ubiquinol.\nThe amount of ATP produced from the $2$ moles of cytosolic NADH generated during glycolysis is therefore:\n$$N_{ATP, oxphos}^{(i)} = (\\text{moles of cytosolic NADH}) \\times (P/O \\text{ ratio for ubiquinol})$$\n$$N_{ATP, oxphos}^{(i)} = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3$$\nThe total net ATP yield per mole of glucose for this case, $N_{ATP, net}^{(i)}$, is the sum of the ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.\n$$N_{ATP, net}^{(i)} = N_{ATP, slp} + N_{ATP, oxphos}^{(i)} = 2 + 3 = 5$$\nThus, when the glycerol phosphate shuttle is operative, the net yield from the glycolytic stage is $5$ moles of ATP per mole of glucose.\n\nCase (ii): The Malate-Aspartate Shuttle\n\nThe malate-aspartate shuttle is more efficient. It transfers reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH to mitochondrial NAD$^+$, thereby generating NADH within the mitochondrial matrix. The problem states that the $P/O$ ratio for the reoxidation of matrix NADH is $2.5$ moles of ATP per mole of NADH.\nThe amount of ATP produced from the $2$ moles of cytosolic NADH is calculated as:\n$$N_{ATP, oxphos}^{(ii)} = (\\text{moles of cytosolic NADH}) \\times (P/O \\text{ ratio for matrix NADH})$$\n$$N_{ATP, oxphos}^{(ii)} = 2 \\times 2.5 = 5$$\nThe total net ATP yield per mole of glucose for this case, $N_{ATP, net}^{(ii)}$, is:\n$$N_{ATP, net}^{(ii)} = N_{ATP, slp} + N_{ATP, oxphos}^{(ii)} = 2 + 5 = 7$$\nThus, when the malate-aspartate shuttle is operative, the net yield from the glycolytic stage is $7$ moles of ATP per mole of glucose.\n\nThe problem requires the result as an ordered pair $(\\text{glycerol phosphate}, \\text{malate-aspartate})$.

This exercise explores a classic example of metabolic sabotage: arsenate poisoning, where arsenate acts as a phosphate analog and uncouples these processes at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) step. By deriving the impact on ATP yield as a function of arsenate substitution, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for the chemical precision required in metabolic pathways [@problem_id:2802817].", "problem": "In glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate using inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$), which is then used by phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via substrate-level phosphorylation. In the presence of arsenate ($\\mathrm{AsO_4^{3-}}$), arsenate can substitute for inorganic phosphate at the GAPDH step to form 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate, which rapidly hydrolyzes to 3-phosphoglycerate without ATP generation at PGK. Assume that the rapid hydrolysis is effectively instantaneous on the timescale of glycolysis and that all downstream steps, including pyruvate kinase, proceed to completion.\n\nUse the following well-tested stoichiometric facts of glycolysis as the fundamental base:\n- From one molecule of glucose, aldolase produces two triose phosphates, so two GAPDH and two PGK turnovers occur per molecule of glucose in the absence of arsenate.\n- Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase each consume one ATP per molecule of glucose, for a total of $2$ ATP consumed in the investment phase.\n- Phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase each generate one ATP per triose processed.\n\nLet $f \\in [0,1]$ denote the fraction of GAPDH turnovers that use arsenate rather than inorganic phosphate (that is, the probability that a given GAPDH event is an arsenolysis event). Under these assumptions, derive analytic expressions, as functions of $f$, for:\n- the expected number of ATP molecules generated by phosphoglycerate kinase per molecule of glucose processed, and\n- the expected net ATP yield per molecule of glucose processed.\n\nExpress your final answer as a row matrix with two entries in this order: $\\big[$PGK-derived ATP per glucose, net ATP per glucose$\\big]$. No rounding is required. Report counts per molecule of glucose as pure numbers (dimensionless).", "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- One molecule of glucose yields two triose phosphates.\n- In the absence of arsenate, there are two turnovers of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and two turnovers of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) per molecule of glucose.\n- The investment phase consumes a total of $2$ ATP per molecule of glucose.\n- PGK generates one ATP per triose processed if its substrate, $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate, is provided.\n- Pyruvate kinase (PK) generates one ATP per triose processed.\n- Arsenate ($\\mathrm{AsO_4^{3-}}$) can substitute for inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$) in the GAPDH reaction.\n- The product, $1$-arseno-$3$-phosphoglycerate, hydrolyzes instantaneously to $3$-phosphoglycerate.\n- This hydrolysis bypasses ATP generation at the PGK step.\n- All downstream steps, including the pyruvate kinase step, proceed to completion.\n- $f$ is the fraction, where $f \\in [0,1]$, of GAPDH turnovers that use arsenate. This is equivalent to the probability that a single GAPDH turnover is an arsenolysis event.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes the established biochemical mechanism of arsenate toxicity, specifically its role as an uncoupler of glycolysis by acting as a phosphate analog. The stoichiometric relationships are standard textbook facts for the glycolytic pathway. The premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear quantitative framework. The variable $f$ is well-defined, and the anlaysis required is the calculation of an expected value based on this probabilistic parameter. The assumptions (instantaneous hydrolysis, completion of downstream steps) render the problem deterministic where appropriate and allow for a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased using precise, objective scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions or missing information. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe analysis begins with one molecule of glucose, which, through the preparatory phase of glycolysis, is cleaved into two molecules of triose phosphate. Each of these two molecules proceeds through the payoff phase. Therefore, for each molecule of glucose, there are two independent reaction sequences involving GAPDH and subsequent enzymes.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{PGK}}$ be the random variable representing the number of ATP molecules generated by phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) per molecule of glucose.\nLet $A_{\\text{net}}$ be the random variable for the net ATP yield per molecule of glucose.\nWe are asked to find the expected values of these two quantities, $E[A_{\\text{PGK}}]$ and $E[A_{\\text{net}}]$, as functions of $f$.\n\n**1. Expected ATP from Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK)**\n\nFor a single triose phosphate molecule, ATP is generated at the PGK step if and only if the preceding GAPDH reaction used inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$) to produce $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate. If arsenate is used, $1$-arseno-$3$-phosphoglycerate is formed, which hydrolyzes, and no ATP is generated via PGK.\n\nThe probability that a single GAPDH turnover uses $\\mathrm{P_i}$ is $1-f$.\nThe probability that it uses arsenate is $f$.\n\nLet $X_i$ be the number of ATP molecules generated at the PGK step for the $i$-th triose phosphate, where $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n- If $\\mathrm{P_i}$ is used (with probability $1-f$), then $X_i = 1$.\n- If arsenate is used (with probability $f$), then $X_i = 0$.\n\nThe expected number of ATP molecules from one PGK event is:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i=0)) = 1 \\cdot (1-f) + 0 \\cdot f = 1-f$$\n\nSince one molecule of glucose produces two triose phosphates, and the events are independent, the total expected ATP from PGK per glucose is the sum of the expectations for each triose phosphate pathway. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[A_{\\text{PGK}}] = E[X_1 + X_2] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] = (1-f) + (1-f) = 2(1-f)$$\n\n**2. Expected Net ATP Yield**\n\nThe net ATP yield is the total ATP generated minus the total ATP invested.\n$$A_{\\text{net}} = A_{\\text{generated}} - A_{\\text{invested}}$$\n\nThe ATP investment is stated to be a fixed cost of $2$ ATP per glucose molecule.\n$$A_{\\text{invested}} = 2$$\n\nATP is generated at two steps in the payoff phase for each triose phosphate: PGK and pyruvate kinase (PK).\nThe total generated ATP per glucose is the sum from both PGK events and both PK events.\n$$A_{\\text{generated}} = A_{\\text{PGK}} + A_{\\text{PK}}$$\nwhere $A_{\\text{PGK}} = X_1 + X_2$ and $A_{\\text{PK}}$ is the ATP from pyruvate kinase.\n\nThe problem states that all downstream steps, including pyruvate kinase, proceed to completion. This means that regardless of whether the GAPDH step involved phosphate or arsenate, the resulting $3$-phosphoglycerate molecule continues down the glycolytic pathway to pyruvate. The pyruvate kinase step, which converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, generates $1$ ATP per molecule. Since there are two triose phosphates per glucose, the ATP generated by pyruvate kinase is always:\n$$A_{\\text{PK}} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\nThis quantity is deterministic, not a random variable dependent on $f$.\n\nNow, we can compute the expected net ATP yield using the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[A_{\\text{net}}] = E[A_{\\text{generated}} - A_{\\text{invested}}] = E[A_{\\text{PGK}} + A_{\\text{PK}} - A_{\\text{invested}}]$$\n$$E[A_{\\text{net}}] = E[A_{\\text{PGK}}] + E[A_{\\text{PK}}] - E[A_{\\text{invested}}]$$\nWe have already found $E[A_{\\text{PGK}}] = 2(1-f)$.\nSince $A_{\\text{PK}}$ and $A_{\\text{invested}}$ are constants, their expected values are simply the constants themselves.\n$$E[A_{\\text{PK}}] = 2$$\n$$E[A_{\\text{invested}}] = 2$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the expected net yield:\n$$E[A_{\\text{net}}] = 2(1-f) + 2 - 2$$\n$$E[A_{\\text{net}}] = 2(1-f)$$\n\nThus, the expression for the expected number of ATP molecules generated by phosphoglycerate kinase is $2(1-f)$, and the expression for the expected net ATP yield is also $2(1-f)$. This occurs because the ATP production at the pyruvate kinase step ($+2$ ATP) exactly cancels the ATP consumption in the investment phase ($-2$ ATP), leaving the net yield entirely dependent on the ATP production from the PGK step, which is the only step affected by arsenate.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the two derived quantities in order: [PGK-derived ATP per glucose, net ATP per glucose].\nThe first entry is $E[A_{\\text{PGK}}] = 2(1-f)$.\nThe second entry is $E[A_{\\text{net}}] = 2(1-f)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2(1-f) & 2(1-f)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2802817"}, {"introduction": "In a multi-step pathway like glycolysis, not all enzymes exert equal influence over the overall rate, or flux.
