This first practice moves from abstract theory to tangible numbers by guiding you through a first-principles calculation of the sheer number of Okazaki fragments that must be joined during a single replication of the human genome. By connecting the size of the genome to the average length of a replication intermediate, you will gain a profound appreciation for the scale and efficiency required of the DNA maturation machinery [@problem_id:2811305].", "problem": "In eukaryotic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication, maturation of the lagging strand requires removal of ribonucleic acid (RNA) primers by Ribonuclease H (RNase H) and Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), gap filling by a replicative DNA polymerase, and sealing of the remaining nick by DNA ligase I. Consider a haploid human genome with length $G = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs (bp). Assume semiconservative, bidirectional replication from many origins; at any genomic position, exactly one of the two nascent strands is synthesized discontinuously (lagging) as Okazaki fragments, each initiated once by a single RNA primer at its $5'$ end. Let the mean Okazaki fragment length be $L = 200$ nucleotides (nt), where each fragment length includes its RNA primer and the subsequent DNA tract. Ignore chromosome ends and any rare re-priming events within leading strands, and neglect primers used to initiate leading-strand synthesis at replication origins.\n\nUsing only these foundational facts and definitions, derive from first principles an expression for the expected number of RNA primers that must be removed during replication of a single haploid human genome, and then evaluate it numerically. Clearly articulate the biological assumptions that justify each step of your derivation, including why the total length synthesized as lagging is what it is under semiconservative, bidirectional replication.\n\nExpress the final answer as a pure number (no units) in scientific notation, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presented is a valid exercise in quantitative biology, grounded in the established principles of eukaryotic DNA replication. It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and provides sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. We will proceed with a derivation from first principles.\n\nThe central task is to determine the expected number of RNA primers, which we denote as $N_{primers}$. The problem statement establishes a direct equivalence: each Okazaki fragment is initiated by a single RNA primer. Therefore, the number of primers to be removed during lagging strand maturation is identical to the total number of Okazaki fragments synthesized. We express this as:\n$$N_{primers} = N_{Okazaki}$$\n\nTo find $N_{Okazaki}$, we must first determine the total length of DNA synthesized discontinuously as the lagging strand, which we will call $G_{lagging}$. The problem provides the total length of the haploid human genome as $G = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs (bp). A genome of length $G$ bp consists of two polynucleotide strands, each of length $G$ nucleotides.\n\nThe principle of semiconservative replication dictates that during the synthesis of two daughter DNA duplexes from one parent duplex, each of the original two strands serves as a template. The total length of newly synthesized DNA is therefore the sum of the lengths of the two new strands, which is $G + G = 2G$ nucleotides.\n\nThe critical insight is derived from the statement that \"at any genomic position, exactly one of the two nascent strands is synthesized discontinuously (lagging)\". This is a direct consequence of the antiparallel nature of the DNA duplex and the unidirectional $5' \\to 3'$ activity of DNA polymerase. In any replication bubble, synthesis proceeding in one direction along one template strand is continuous (leading), while synthesis proceeding in the same direction along the other template strand must be discontinuous (lagging). Summed over the entire genome, which replicates from many bidirectional origins, this means that precisely half of the total newly synthesized DNA is produced via the lagging strand mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the lagging strand synthesized is:\n$$G_{lagging} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Total length of newly synthesized DNA}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2G) = G$$\nThis establishes that the total length of all Okazaki fragments, if they were concatenated end-to-end, must equal the length of the haploid genome, $G$.\n\nThe problem states that the mean length of an Okazaki fragment, which includes its initiating RNA primer and subsequent DNA, is $L = 200$ nucleotides (nt). The total number of Okazaki fragments, $N_{Okazaki}$, is found by dividing the total length of lagging strand synthesis by the average length of a single fragment.\n$$N_{Okazaki} = \\frac{G_{lagging}}{L} = \\frac{G}{L}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided values to obtain a numerical result.\nGiven:\n-   Genome length, $G = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ nt.\n-   Mean Okazaki fragment length, $L = 200$ nt.\n\nThe number of primers is:\n$$N_{primers} = \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{9}}{200} = \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{9}}{2 \\times 10^{2}}$$\n$$N_{primers} = 1.6 \\times 10^{(9-2)} = 1.6 \\times 10^{7}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation rounded to two significant figures. Our result, $1.6 \\times 10^{7}$, already satisfies these conditions. The explicitly stated simplifications—ignoring chromosome ends and primers at replication origins—are justified because their contribution to the total count is negligible. The number of replication origins is orders of magnitude smaller than the calculated number of Okazaki fragments, making their primers statistically irrelevant to this calculation at the required precision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.6 \\times 10^{7}}$$", "id": "2811305"}, {"introduction": "With millions of nicks to seal per cell cycle, the catalytic mechanism of DNA ligase must be both rapid and exquisitely controlled.

It describes a standard *in vitro* biochemical experiment using a well-characterized set of enzymes from *E. coli* for DNA replication. The description of Okazaki fragment maturation, the three-step mechanism of DNA ligase, and the specific cofactor requirements of bacterial versus eukaryotic ligases are all fundamental and correct principles of molecular biology.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It establishes a clear initial state, a specific perturbation ($\\text{NAD}^+$ depletion), an attempted intervention (ATP addition), and asks for a predictable outcome based on explicitly stated, non-contradictory facts. A unique solution is derivable from the provided information.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased scientific language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe process of lagging strand synthesis culminates in a series of Okazaki fragments. The provided enzymatic system—primase, DNA polymerase III, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I—is sufficient to synthesize these fragments, remove their initial RNA primers, and fill the resulting gaps with deoxyribonucleotides. The final structure after the action of DNA polymerase I is a DNA duplex containing nicks, which are interruptions in one strand's phosphodiester backbone between a $3'$-hydroxyl group and an adjacent $5'$-phosphate group.\n\nThe sealing of these nicks is the exclusive function of DNA ligase. The problem specifies the use of *E. coli* DNA ligase, known as LigA. The overall reaction is the formation of a phosphodiester bond, which requires energy. This energy is supplied by a high-energy cofactor.\n\nThe problem provides three foundational facts. The third fact is the most critical for solving the problem: \"*Escherichia coli* LigA uses $\\text{NAD}^+$ as the adenylate donor in step (1)... wild-type *E. coli* LigA does not use ATP as a substrate in step (1).\"\n\nStep (1) is the self-adenylation of the ligase, where an AMP moiety is covalently attached to a lysine residue in the enzyme's active site. For LigA, this reaction is:\n$$ \\text{LigA} + \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{LigA-AMP} + \\text{NMN} $$\nwhere NMN is nicotinamide mononucleotide. This is an obligatory first step. Without the formation of the LigA-AMP intermediate, the subsequent steps—transfer of AMP to the $5'$ phosphate of the DNA and a nucleophilic attack by the $3'$ hydroxyl—cannot occur.\n\nIn the described experiment, $\\text{NAD}^+$ is depleted to a concentration of < 10 nM. This concentration is far below the Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of LigA for $\\text{NAD}^+$, which is in the micromolar range. Therefore, at < 10 nM $\\text{NAD}^+$, the rate of the first step of the ligation reaction will be effectively zero. LigA will be unable to become adenylated and will remain inactive. Consequently, the nicks between Okazaki fragments will persist, and the lagging strand will not become a covalently continuous molecule. The products of the reaction will be nicked duplex DNA circles.\n\nThe second part of the experiment involves adding $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ ATP in an attempt to \"rescue\" the reaction. However, the foundational facts explicitly state that \"wild-type *E. coli* LigA does not use ATP as a substrate in step (1)\". Unlike eukaryotic or bacteriophage T4 DNA ligases, which use ATP for their self-adenylation, *E. coli* LigA is strictly specific for $\\text{NAD}^+$. The addition of ATP, even at a high concentration of $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, will not enable LigA to form the essential LigA-AMP intermediate. Thus, the ligation block will not be overcome.\n\nThe predicted outcome is therefore an accumulation of nicked Okazaki fragments under $\\text{NAD}^+$ depletion, a situation that is not remedied by the subsequent addition of ATP.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Nicked Okazaki fragments accumulate because LigA cannot sustain step (1) without $\\text{NAD}^+$; adding ATP does not rescue because wild-type LigA is strictly $\\text{NAD}^+$-dependent and cannot use ATP to form Lig–AMP.**\n    This statement is a precise and accurate description of the consequences based on the provided foundational facts. The depletion of $\\text{NAD}^+$ starves LigA of its required cofactor for the initial self-adenylation step, leading to the accumulation of nicked DNA. The strict substrate specificity of LigA for $\\text{NAD}^+$ over ATP means that adding ATP will not rescue the activity.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Ligation proceeds normally because ATP supplies the energy for the ligation reaction; adding ATP rescues ligation by adenylating LigA in step (1) even without $\\text{NAD}^+$.**\n    This statement is fundamentally incorrect. It incorrectly assumes that LigA uses ATP, confusing it with eukaryotic or phage ligases. The problem explicitly states that *E. coli* LigA uses $\\text{NAD}^+$. Therefore, ligation would not proceed normally in the absence of $\\text{NAD}^+$, and ATP addition would not rescue it.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. RNA primer removal fails, leading to long single-stranded gaps, because RNase H and DNA polymerase I require $\\text{NAD}^+$; adding ATP does not affect this, so Okazaki fragments remain gapped rather than nicked.**\n    This statement misidentifies the enzymatic step that is dependent on $\\text{NAD}^+$. The catalytic activities of RNase H and DNA polymerase I are not directly dependent on $\\text{NAD}^+$. Their function is to remove RNA and fill the gap with DNA, respectively. This process correctly leads to a nicked product, not a gapped one with residual RNA. The primary and direct target of $\\text{NAD}^+$ depletion in this system is LigA.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Ligation slows but is partially rescued by ATP because LigA can use either $\\text{NAD}^+$ or ATP with reduced efficiency; therefore some Okazaki fragments become ligated after ATP addition, yielding a mixed nicked/ligated population.**\n    This statement contradicts a key piece of information provided: \"wild-type *E. coli* LigA does not use ATP as a substrate in step (1)\". This explicitly rules out any possibility of ATP acting as a cofactor, even with reduced efficiency. Therefore, there can be no partial rescue and no formation of ligated products upon ATP addition.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2811336"}, {"introduction": "The DNA replication machinery does not operate in a vacuum; it must constantly navigate a landscape of spontaneous DNA damage.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe problem concerns the fate of a nicked DNA intermediate during lagging-strand synthesis, where the nick is immediately adjacent to an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. The structure can be represented as:\n$$\n\\text{Template strand: } 3'-\\dots-X-Y-Z-\\dots-5' \\\\\n\\text{Lagging strand:  } 5'-\\dots-A'-\\mathbf{B'(3'-OH)} \\quad \\mathbf{(5'-\\text{phosphate}) \\emptyset}-C'-\\dots-3'\n$$\nHere, $\\emptyset$ represents the AP site (lacking a base), which is at the $5'$ terminus of the downstream Okazaki fragment. The nick lies between the nucleotide $\\mathbf{B'}$ and the AP site $\\emptyset$.\n\n1.  **Action of DNA Ligase I (LIG1):** The problem states that LIG1 requires not only the correct chemical termini ($3'$-OH and $5'$-phosphate, which are present) but also \"proper base-paired geometry at the nick.\" An AP site is a non-coding lesion that lacks a base, preventing the formation of a canonical base pair with the nucleotide ($Y$) on the template strand. This creates a significant distortion in the DNA double helix. High-fidelity DNA processing enzymes, including replicative polymerases and ligases, possess mechanisms to scrutinize the structural integrity of their substrates. LIG1 will detect this distorted geometry and, under high-fidelity conditions, will reject the substrate and fail to catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond. Therefore, LIG1 will not ligate the nick. In some cases, the ligation reaction may stall after the transfer of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to the $5'$-phosphate of the nick, creating an abortive $5'$-adenylated (DNA-$5'$-AMP) intermediate. This adenylated nick is itself a lesion that must be processed.\n\n2.  **Subsequent Processing Pathway:** Since LIG1 fails, the cell must employ a DNA repair pathway to resolve both the nick and the AP site.\n    -   The presence of an AP site is the canonical signal for the **Base Excision Repair (BER)** pathway.\n    -   The context is DNA replication (Okazaki fragment maturation), a process involving high-processivity machinery. In such a context, the **long-patch BER (LP-BER)** pathway is favored over short-patch BER. LP-BER is intrinsically linked with the replication machinery.\n    -   The specific steps are as follows:\n        a.  If an abortive DNA-$5'$-AMP adduct was formed, it must be removed. The enzyme **Aprataxin (APTX)** is a specialized phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes the bond between the DNA $5'$-phosphate and the AMP, a process known as de-adenylation. This restores a clean nick with a $5'$-phosphate.\n        b.  The BER pathway is initiated. The central enzyme for AP site processing is **Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1 (APE1)**. APE1's primary role is to incise the phosphodiester backbone $5'$ to the AP site. In this specific substrate, the position $5'$ to the AP site is already nicked. Thus, the endonuclease activity of APE1 is not required to create a break. However, APE1 is a key scaffolding protein that recruits the downstream components of the BER machinery. Its binding to the AP site is a critical step.\n        c.  The replication-associated DNA polymerase, **DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ)**, along with its processivity factor **Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)**, is recruited to the $3'$-OH of the upstream fragment.\n        d.  Pol δ initiates DNA synthesis from the $3'$-OH, using the complementary strand as a template. As it synthesizes new DNA, it displaces the downstream strand containing the AP site, creating a $5'$-flap structure. This strand displacement synthesis typically proceeds for $2$–$10$ nucleotides.\n        e.  The displaced flap is recognized and cleaved by **Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1)**. This cleavage removes the AP site and other downstream nucleotides, leaving a new nick.\n        f.  The resulting nick is a perfect substrate for **LIG1**—it has the correct $3'$-OH and $5'$-phosphate termini and is flanked by correctly base-paired DNA. LIG1 seals this final nick, completing the repair and maturation process.\n\nThis sequence of events correctly describes the coordinated action of replication and repair machinery to handle a lesion encountered during Okazaki fragment maturation.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. LIG1 will efficiently ligate because the $3'$-hydroxyl and $5'$-phosphate are present; no additional processing is required.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. It completely ignores the structural requirement for base-pairing integrity, which is violated by the presence of the AP site.\n\n*   **B. LIG1 will reject ligation due to the adjacent AP site and can leave an abortive $5'$-adenylated intermediate; Aprataxin (APTX) will remove the attached adenosine monophosphate, Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1 (APE1) will incise $5'$ to the AP site, and long-patch base excision repair will proceed with DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ), Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), and Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), ending with sealing by LIG1.**\n    This is **Correct**. This option accurately describes the entire process: (1) LIG1 rejection, (2) the potential formation and removal of an abortive intermediate by APTX, and (3) the activation of the replication-coupled LP-BER pathway involving Pol δ/PCNA, FEN1, and finally LIG1. The statement about APE1 incision is mechanistically redundant since a nick already exists, but APE1 is the key sensor and coordinator of AP site repair, making its inclusion appropriate in describing the initiation of the BER response. This option provides the most comprehensive and mechanistically sound pathway.\n\n*   **C. LIG1 will not ligate, and the single-strand break will be passed to nonhomologous end joining, where DNA ligase IV (LIG4) and XRCC4 complete ligation without removing the AP site.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), involving LIG4 and XRCC4, is a major pathway for repairing **double-strand breaks**, not single-strand nicks. Furthermore, it is an error-prone pathway that would not be the primary choice during high-fidelity DNA replication. Finally, ligating past a lesion without removing it would fix the damage into the genome, which is contrary to the function of repair pathways.\n\n*   **D. LIG1 will first require a translesion synthesis polymerase to insert across the AP site from the $3'$ end; if that fails, nucleotide excision repair will remove a $24$–$32$ nucleotide patch containing the lesion, after which LIG1 will seal the nick.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a low-fidelity, damage-tolerance mechanism of last resort; the cell would preferentially use the high-fidelity BER pathway. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is designed to remove bulky, helix-distorting adducts, not AP sites. The specific and efficient pathway for AP sites is BER. Shunting this lesion to either TLS or NER would be incorrect and inefficient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2811304"}]}
