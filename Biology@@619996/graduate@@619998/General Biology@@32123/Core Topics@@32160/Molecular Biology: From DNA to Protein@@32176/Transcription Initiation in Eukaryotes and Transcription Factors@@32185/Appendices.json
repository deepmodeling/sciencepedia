Therefore, it is deemed valid, and we shall proceed with its derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a promoter site being bound by a transcription factor, a quantity we denote as $p$. The system is described by a simple $1:1$ binding equilibrium reaction between the promoter ($P$) and the transcription factor ($TF$):\n$$ P + TF \\rightleftharpoons P \\cdot TF $$\nHere, $P \\cdot TF$ represents the bound complex. The promoter can exist in only 2 states: unbound ($P$) or bound ($P \\cdot TF$). The probability of occupancy, $p$, is the fraction of total promoters that are in the bound state:\n$$ p = \\frac{[P \\cdot TF]}{[P_{\\text{total}}]} $$\nwhere $[P_{\\text{total}}]$ is the total concentration of promoter sites, given by $[P_{\\text{total}}] = [P] + [P \\cdot TF]$. Substituting this into the expression for $p$ gives:\n$$ p = \\frac{[P \\cdot TF]}{[P] + [P \\cdot TF]} $$\nTo proceed, we utilize the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_D$, which describes the equilibrium of the binding reaction according to the law of mass action:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[P][TF]}{[P \\cdot TF]} $$\nFrom this definition, we can express the concentration of unbound promoter, $[P]$, in terms of the other species:\n$$ [P] = K_D \\frac{[P \\cdot TF]}{[TF]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[P]$ into our equation for the probability $p$:\n$$ p = \\frac{[P \\cdot TF]}{K_D \\frac{[P \\cdot TF]}{[TF]} + [P \\cdot TF]} $$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of bound complexes, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[P \\cdot TF]$, which yields:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[TF]} + 1} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged into the more common form of the Langmuir binding isotherm:\n$$ p = \\frac{[TF]}{[TF] + K_D} $$\nThe next step is to relate the dissociation constant $K_D$ to the standard binding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$.

From the standpoint of equilibrium thermodynamics applied to gene regulation, the promoter exists in a set of discrete microstates defined by the occupancy of transcription factor binding sites and the PIC. The statistical weight of each microstate is the product of the dimensionless binding strengths of the occupants and any specified pairwise interaction (cooperativity) factors. The probability that the promoter is PIC-bound equals the sum of the statistical weights of all PIC-bound states divided by the partition function, which is the sum of weights of all allowed states.\n\nAssume:\n- A single activator species with cellular concentration $[\\mathrm{A}]$ binds to each cognate site with dissociation constant $K_{\\mathrm{A}}$, defining a dimensionless binding strength $a \\equiv [\\mathrm{A}]/K_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n- The PIC is treated as a single species with effective concentration $[\\mathrm{PIC}]$ that binds the core promoter with dissociation constant $K_{\\mathrm{P}}$, defining $p \\equiv [\\mathrm{PIC}]/K_{\\mathrm{P}}$.\n- When an activator and the PIC are simultaneously bound, Mediator-mediated recruitment stabilizes the complex by a multiplicative factor $f$ for each activator–PIC contact, with $f \\geq 1$.\n- When two activators occupy two sites, their cooperative stabilization (for example, through Mediator-dependent multivalent bridging or cooperative nucleosome remodeling) is represented by a multiplicative factor $\\omega$ applied when both activator sites are occupied, with $\\omega \\geq 0$.\n- All other higher-order interactions are absent, binding sites are non-overlapping, and all sites are identical and independent aside from the specified pairwise interactions.

It employs the standard and widely accepted statistical mechanical framework of gene regulation, first formalized by Shea and Ackers, to model eukaryotic transcription initiation. All parameters are clearly defined, and the tasks are unambiguous. It is a valid problem of quantitative biology.\n\nFirst, we address the conceptual question of Mediator function within this thermodynamic framework.\nThe Mediator complex functions as a physical and informational bridge, integrating regulatory signals from multiple DNA-bound transcriptional activators. From first principles, its large, multi-subunit architecture allows it to make simultaneous physical contact with several activators, which may be bound to distal enhancer elements, and with the core components of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. In the thermodynamic model, such physical interactions lead to a stabilization of the entire assembly. The problem formalizes this stabilization using multiplicative cooperativity factors. The factor $f$ represents the stabilization energy gained from a single activator-PIC contact, mediated by the complex. When multiple activators, say $k$ of them, are present, the model posits that each contributes independently to stabilization. The total stabilization factor for the PIC becomes $f^k$. This multiplicative, or exponential, dependence on the number of bound activators constitutes a powerful signal amplification mechanism. A linear increase in the number of bound activators leads to an exponential increase in the stability, and thus occupancy, of the PIC. This non-linear response, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, is the essence of synergistic signal integration. Mediator, by bridging these multiple components, is the physical embodiment of this synergistic computation.\n\nNext, we proceed with the derivation for the fold-change in PIC occupancy, $R \\equiv P_{\\mathrm{PIC}}^{(2)}/P_{\\mathrm{PIC}}^{(1)}$. This requires a systematic enumeration of all possible microstates and their statistical weights for the two promoter configurations. The probability of any configuration is its statistical weight divided by the partition function, $Z$, which is the sum of all possible statistical weights.\n\nCase 1: Promoter with $n=1$ activator site.\nThe system has two binding sites: one for the activator (A) and one for the PIC (P). Each site can be either unbound ($0$) or bound ($1$). This gives $2^2 = 4$ possible microstates. Let the state be denoted by (A, P).

We substitute $b\\,k_{init}$ for $k_{init}$.\n- Mean (B): $\\langle n \\rangle_B = \\frac{b\\,k_{init}}{\\gamma} \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} = b \\langle n \\rangle_{base}$\n- Fano Factor (B): $F_B = 1 + \\frac{b\\,k_{init}k_{off}}{(k_{on}+k_{off})(k_{on}+k_{off}+\\gamma)}$\n\nMechanistic Explanation:\nTranscriptional bursting arises from the promoter switching between an active state (burst ON) and an inactive state (burst OFF). The parameters of the model relate to properties of these bursts. The rate $k_{on}$ controls the frequency of burst initiation, while $k_{init}$ controls the rate of mRNA synthesis during a burst, which determines the burst size (the number of transcripts produced per burst). Noise in gene expression, quantified by the Fano factor, is a direct consequence of this bursty dynamics. A Fano factor of $F=1$ corresponds to Poissonian noise, characteristic of a constitutive (non-bursty) process. $F>1$ indicates super-Poissonian noise due to bursting.\n\n- Effect of Mechanism A (modulating $k_{on}$): An activator that increases $k_{on}$ increases the burst frequency. The gene turns on more often, increasing the overall fraction of time spent in the active state. This leads to a higher mean mRNA level, $\\langle n \\rangle_A > \\langle n \\rangle_{base}$. As $a$ increases, the term $(a\\,k_{on}+k_{off})(a\\,k_{on}+k_{off}+\\gamma)$ in the denominator of the Fano factor grows, causing the second term (the excess noise from bursting) to decrease. Thus, $F_A$ approaches $1$. Mechanistically, by making the OFF periods shorter, transcription becomes more continuous, which reduces the relative fluctuations. This mechanism increases the mean expression while decreasing the noise.\n\n- Effect of Mechanism B (modulating $k_{init}$): An activator that increases $k_{init}$ increases the burst size. During each active period, more mRNA molecules are produced. This directly scales the mean mRNA level, $\\langle n \\rangle_B = b \\langle n \\rangle_{base}$. However, it also scales the bursting noise term in the Fano factor by the same factor $b$. This means that $F_B$ increases linearly with $b$. Mechanistically, increasing the number of molecules produced per burst, while keeping the burst timing the same, amplifies the magnitude of fluctuations relative to the mean. This mechanism increases both the mean expression and the noise.\n\nIn conclusion, measuring the concurrent changes in both the mean and the noise (Fano factor) of gene expression upon activation allows for the discrimination between these two regulatory strategies. An activator that primarily modulates burst frequency (Mechanism A) will increase the mean and decrease the Fano factor, while an activator that primarily modulates burst size (Mechanism B) will increase both the mean and the Fano factor.\n\nThe final results are compiled below.\n1.
