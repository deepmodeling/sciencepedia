The following well-tested mechanistic facts and definitions apply:\n\n- The 5′ end of the nascent RNA initially bears a 5′-triphosphate. RNA triphosphatase hydrolyzes the terminal (gamma) phosphate from the RNA, yielding a 5′-diphosphate RNA end; this step does not hydrolyze any cellular nucleoside triphosphate.\n- Guanylyltransferase uses guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to form the cap structure by transferring guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to the 5′-diphosphate RNA end, releasing inorganic pyrophosphate ($\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$) from GTP.\n- N$7$-guanine methyltransferase transfers one methyl group from $S$-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the cap guanine, producing $S$-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).

It is scientifically grounded in the accepted mechanism of eukaryotic mRNA capping, is well-posed with clearly defined terms and accounting conventions, and is objective. It presents a solvable problem in biochemical stoichiometry. We shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the total number of high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds hydrolyzed by the cell to synthesize one $m^{7}\\mathrm{G}$ cap on an mRNA molecule. We will analyze the energetic cost of each step in the provided reaction sequence according to the specified accounting rules.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$5^\\prime\\text{-}\\mathrm{pppN}\\text{-RNA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Capping enzymes, GTP, SAM}} m^{7}\\mathrm{GpppN}\\text{-RNA}$\n\nThe cost is to be tallied by summing the number of phosphoanhydride bonds broken in free nucleoside triphosphates (like ATP, GTP) or in inorganic pyrophosphate ($\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$).\n\nLet us dissect the process into its constituent enzymatic steps:\n\n1.  **RNA Triphosphatase Action:** The first step is the removal of the terminal, or gamma ($\\gamma$), phosphate from the nascent RNA transcript. The reaction is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{pppN...} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ppN...} + \\mathrm{P_{i}} $$\n    This reaction involves the cleavage of a phosphoanhydride bond at the 5′ end of the RNA molecule. However, the problem provides two critical pieces of information for accounting. First, the rule for counting states: \"A 'high-energy phosphoanhydride bond hydrolyzed' is counted whenever a phosphoanhydride bond in a nucleoside triphosphate or in $\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$ is cleaved.\" Second, a specific instruction is given for this step: \"this step does not hydrolyze any cellular nucleoside triphosphate.\" This instruction clarifies that the term \"nucleoside triphosphate\" in the accounting rule refers to free, monomeric nucleoside triphosphates from the cellular pool, not the triphosphate group that is part of the nascent RNA polymer. Therefore, despite the chemical hydrolysis of a phosphoanhydride bond, it is not counted under the problem's specific conventions.\n    The cost for this step is $0$ phosphoanhydride bonds.\n\n2.  **Guanylyltransferase Action:** The second step involves the transfer of a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) moiety from a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecule to the 5′ diphosphate end of the RNA. The reaction is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{GTP} + \\mathrm{ppN...} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{GpppN...} + \\mathrm{PP_{i}} $$\n    In this reaction, a molecule of GTP from the cellular pool is consumed. It is converted to GMP, which becomes part of the cap, and inorganic pyrophosphate ($\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$) is released. The accounting rule states: \"Conversion of a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside monophosphate plus $\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$ counts as hydrolysis of $1$ phosphoanhydride bond in the nucleoside triphosphate\". This rule applies directly to the consumption of GTP in this step.\n    The cost for this step is $1$ phosphoanhydride bond.\n\n3.  **Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Action:** The inorganic pyrophosphate ($\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$) generated in the previous step is rapidly hydrolyzed into two molecules of inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_{i}}$). The reaction is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{PP_{i}} + \\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\mathrm{P_{i}} $$\n    The problem specifies that this hydrolysis occurs and provides a corresponding accounting rule: \"...if the resulting $\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$ is subsequently hydrolyzed to $2\\,\\mathrm{P_{i}}$, that counts as an additional $1$ phosphoanhydride bond hydrolyzed.\" The single phosphoanhydride bond within the $\\mathrm{PP_{i}}$ molecule is cleaved.\n    The cost for this step is $1$ phosphoanhydride bond.\n\n4.  **N7-guanine Methyltransferase Action and SAM Regeneration:** The final modification is the methylation of the guanine base at the N$7$ position. The methyl group is supplied by $S$-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The methylation reaction itself does not involve phosphoanhydride bond cleavage. However, the cofactor SAM must be regenerated for the next cycle, and this regeneration has an energetic cost. The problem explicitly defines this cost: \"Regeneration of one SAM molecule after a single methyl transfer is defined here to cost exactly $1$ adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 'equivalent,' meaning ATP is hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) + inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_{i}}$), which counts as hydrolysis of $1$ phosphoanhydride bond.\" The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and $\\mathrm{P_{i}}$ involves the cleavage of the terminal phosphoanhydride bond of ATP.\n    The cost associated with this step is $1$ phosphoanhydride bond.\n\n**Total Cost Calculation:**\nTo find the total number of high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds hydrolyzed, we sum the costs from each contributing step:\n$$ \\text{Total Cost} = (\\text{Cost}_\\text{Triphosphatase}) + (\\text{Cost}_\\text{Guanylyltransferase}) + (\\text{Cost}_\\text{Pyrophosphatase}) + (\\text{Cost}_\\text{SAM Regen.}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Cost} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\nThus, a total of $3$ high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds are hydrolyzed by the cell to install one canonical $m^{7}\\mathrm{G}$ cap, according to the provided mechanism and accounting rules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2835466"}, {"introduction": "Cellular processes must not only be possible, but also efficient.

All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided for a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe problem describes a kinetic competition between two stochastic events: the assembly of a cleavage and polyadenylation complex at a proximal polyadenylation signal (PAS) and a distal PAS.\n\nLet $T_p$ be the random variable representing the waiting time until the complex assembles at the proximal PAS. According to the problem, this assembly is a Poisson process with a constant rate $k_p$, which begins at time $t=0$ when the proximal PAS is exposed by the transcribing RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II). Therefore, $T_p$ follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $k_p$. The probability density function (PDF) is $f_{T_p}(t) = k_p \\exp(-k_p t)$ for $t \\ge 0$, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F_{T_p}(t) = P(T_p \\le t) = 1 - \\exp(-k_p t)$.\n\nLet $T_d$ be the random variable for the waiting time until complex assembly at the distal PAS. The distal PAS is exposed at time $t_{exp} = L/v$. The assembly process at the distal site, a Poisson process with rate $k_d$, can only begin at or after this time. Let $T'_d$ be the waiting time for assembly *after* the distal site is exposed. $T'_d$ is an exponential random variable with rate $k_d$. The total time until distal assembly is thus $T_d = t_{exp} + T'_d$.\n\nThe proximal PAS is chosen if its complex assembles before the complex at the distal PAS assembles. Mathematically, this corresponds to the event $T_p < T_d$. We are asked to find the probability of this event, $P_{\\text{prox}} = P(T_p < T_d)$.\n\nWe can solve this by conditioning on whether the proximal assembly occurs before the distal PAS is even exposed. This time, $t_{exp} = L/v$, defines a critical \"window of opportunity\" for the proximal site.\n\nLet us define two disjoint scenarios:\n$1$. The complex at the proximal PAS assembles before the distal PAS is exposed. This is the event $T_p < t_{exp}$. In this case, the proximal site is chosen by default, because the distal site is not yet available for competition. The probability of this event is $P(T_p < t_{exp}) = F_{T_p}(t_{exp}) = 1 - \\exp(-k_p t_{exp})$. Since proximal choice is certain in this scenario, this term contributes $1 \\times (1 - \\exp(-k_p t_{exp}))$ to the total probability.\n\n$2$. The complex at the proximal PAS has not assembled by the time the distal PAS is exposed. This is the event $T_p \\ge t_{exp}$. The probability of this is $P(T_p \\ge t_{exp}) = 1 - F_{T_p}(t_{exp}) = \\exp(-k_p t_{exp})$. Given that this event has occurred, at time $t_{exp}$ a race begins between the two assembly processes. Due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the remaining waiting time for the proximal assembly, starting from $t_{exp}$, is still exponentially distributed with rate $k_p$. The waiting time for the distal assembly, also starting from $t_{exp}$, is exponentially distributed with rate $k_d$. For two independent exponential processes with rates $k_p$ and $k_d$ starting simultaneously, the probability that the first process finishes before the second is given by the well-known formula $\\frac{k_p}{k_p + k_d}$.
