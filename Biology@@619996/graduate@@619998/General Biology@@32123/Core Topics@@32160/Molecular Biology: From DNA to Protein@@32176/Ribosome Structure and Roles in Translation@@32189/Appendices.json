Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the average number of high-energy phosphate bonds hydrolyzed per incorporated amino acid across a specified cohort of polypeptides. This quantity, which we denote as $\\langle C \\rangle$, is defined as the total number of high-energy bonds consumed divided by the total number of amino acids incorporated.\n\nLet us first formulate a general expression for the total energy cost, $E(L)$, to synthesize a single polypeptide of length $L$ amino acids. The cost is the sum of three components: aminoacyl-tRNA charging, polypeptide chain elongation, and the fixed costs of initiation and termination.\n\n1.  **Aminoacyl-tRNA Charging**: Each of the $L$ amino acids must be \"charged\" or esterified to its cognate tRNA. This reaction is catalyzed by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and consumes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$), which is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate ($AMP$) and inorganic pyrophosphate ($PP_i$). The subsequent hydrolysis of $PP_i$ to two inorganic phosphates ($P_i$) means that this process is energetically equivalent to the hydrolysis of two high-energy phosphate bonds.\n    The cost for charging is thus $2$ high-energy bonds per amino acid. For a polypeptide of length $L$, the total charging cost, $E_{charge}$, is:\n    $$E_{charge}(L) = 2L$$\n\n2.  **Polypeptide Chain Elongation**: The elongation cycle adds one amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. For a chain of length $L$, there are $L-1$ such cycles, as the first amino acid is positioned during initiation. Each cycle involves two steps that consume guanosine triphosphate ($GTP$).\n    -   Delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site by Elongation Factor Tu ($EF-Tu$) consumes $1$ $GTP$.\n    -   Translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA by Elongation Factor G ($EF-G$) consumes another $1$ $GTP$.\n    Each hydrolysis of $GTP$ to guanosine diphosphate ($GDP$) and $P_i$ counts as the consumption of $1$ high-energy phosphate bond. The cost per elongation cycle is therefore $1+1=2$ bonds.\n    The total elongation cost, $E_{elong}$, for a polypeptide of length $L$ is:\n    $$E_{elong}(L) = 2(L-1) = 2L - 2$$\n\n3.  **Initiation and Termination/Recycling**: These are fixed costs incurred once per synthesized polypeptide, regardless of its length. The problem states that initiation requires $1$ $GTP$ and termination plus ribosome recycling together require $2$ $GTP$.\n    The total fixed cost, $E_{fixed}$, is the sum of these, which is $1 + 2 = 3$ high-energy bonds.\n    $$E_{fixed} = 3$$\n\nThe total energy cost $E(L)$ is the sum of these components:\n$$E(L) = E_{charge}(L) + E_{elong}(L) + E_{fixed}$$\n$$E(L) = (2L) + (2L - 2) + 3$$\n$$E(L) = 4L + 1$$\n\nNow, we must calculate the average cost per amino acid across the entire cohort of proteins.

The number of polypeptides of class $i$ is $N_i = f_i N$.\n\nThe total number of incorporated amino acids, $A_{total}$, is:\n$$A_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i L_i = N \\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i L_i$$\n\nThe total energy cost, $E_{total}$, is:\n$$E_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i E(L_i) = N \\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i E(L_i)$$\n\nThe average cost per amino acid is the ratio $\\frac{E_{total}}{A_{total}}$:\n$$\\langle C \\rangle = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i E(L_i)}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i L_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i (4L_i + 1)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_i L_i}$$\n\nLet us analyze the structure of this expression.

Translation proceeds by ribosomes decoding one codon at a time, where the mean dwell time on a codon is set by the arrival and accommodation of the cognate aminoacyl–transfer RNA (tRNA), and can be approximated as the inverse of a codon-specific elongation rate, $k$ (units $\\text{s}^{-1}$). Initiation places new ribosomes at the start codon with a mean inter-arrival time $T_i$ (units $\\text{s}$), producing a stream of translating ribosomes separated in time by approximately $T_i$. Consider that along this mRNA there is a contiguous cluster of $m$ consecutive rare codons (for a single amino acid species) whose cognate tRNA is scarce, such that the per-codon elongation rate is $k_r$ in the cluster and $k_o$ outside the cluster, with $k_r \\ll k_o$.

The cellular quality control systems that handle elongation stalls include the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway, in which collided ribosomes are recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (for example, Zinc Finger Protein $598$ (ZNF$598$) in mammals or Hel2 in yeast) that ubiquitinates small-subunit proteins on the collided disome to promote rescue; ribosome rescue factors such as Pelota (mammals) or Dom34 (yeast) with Hbs1 split arrested ribosomes; endonucleases cleave the mRNA near the stall; and the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex (including the E3 ligase Ltn1 and the factor Rqc2) ubiquitinates and extracts the nascent polypeptide.\n\nWhich option best predicts, from first principles, how the rare-codon cluster can induce ribosome collisions and trigger quality control on this transcript, and how a rational synonymous recoding would alleviate the bottleneck without increasing proteotoxic stress?\n\nA. The cluster imposes an extra delay $\\Delta t = m\\left(\\frac{1}{k_r} - \\frac{1}{k_o}\\right)$ on each ribosome that transits it. With $m = 4$, $k_r = 2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $k_o = 6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\Delta t \\approx 4\\left(0.5 - 0.1667\\right) \\approx 1.33\\,\\text{s}$. Because $T_i = 1.0\\,\\text{s}  \\Delta t$, trailing ribosomes catch up, forming collided disomes that are specifically recognized by ZNF$598$/Hel2, triggering NGD, splitting by Pelota/Dom34–Hbs1, mRNA cleavage, and recruitment of the RQC (Ltn1, Rqc2) to ubiquitinate the nascent chain. Synonymous recoding that replaces some or all rare codons in the cluster with tRNA-abundant synonymous codons (increasing $k$ locally so that $\\Delta t$ drops below $T_i$), or that installs a mild $5'$ “ramp” of moderately suboptimal codons to enlarge inter-ribosome headways without altering the pause site, will alleviate collisions while preserving co-translational folding.\n\nB. Rare-codon clusters primarily impair initiation by promoting abortive initiation at the start codon, so elongation is unaffected; therefore collisions are unlikely. Synonymous recoding of the $3'$ untranslated region to increase codon optimality would be the most direct way to reduce collisions.\n\nC. Collisions are caused only by stable mRNA secondary structures, not codon usage. ZNF$598$ recognizes only triple-ribosome stacks, not disomes; raising initiation by strengthening the Kozak sequence will flush ribosomes through the slow region and alleviate the bottleneck.\n\nD. Collisions at a rare-codon cluster occur only if the ribosome footprint is shorter than the cluster so that two ribosomes can fit inside it; the predominant surveillance triggered is Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) via Upf proteins. Synonymous recoding that increases local guanine–cytosine content will speed elongation by destabilizing ribosome pausing.\n\nE. Rare-codon clusters lead to spontaneous peptidyl–tRNA drop-off without ubiquitin-dependent signaling. The most direct alleviation strategy is to overexpress the eukaryotic Release Factor $1$ (eRF$1$) so that termination can occur earlier and reduce pileups; synonymous recoding is ineffective because it does not change elongation rates.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must be established before proceeding to a solution.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   System: Eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding a cytosolic protein.\n-   Process: Translation by ribosomes.\n-   Mean codon dwell time: Inverse of codon-specific elongation rate, $k$ (units $\\text{s}^{-1}$).\n-   Initiation: Mean inter-arrival time of ribosomes is $T_i$ (units $\\text{s}$).\n-   mRNA feature: A contiguous cluster of $m$ consecutive rare codons.\n-   Elongation rates: $k_r$ within the rare codon cluster, $k_o$ outside the cluster.\n-   Rate relationship: $k_r \\ll k_o$.\n-   Ribosome interaction: Ribosomes are extended objects, cannot overtake, cannot occupy the same codon.\n-   Collision condition: A trailing ribosome collides with a leading one if the leading ribosome's extra delay exceeds the initial time headway $T_i$.\n-   Specific numerical values: $m = 4$, $k_r = 2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_o = 6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $T_i = 1.0\\,\\text{s}$.\n-   Biological context for stalls/collisions: No-Go Decay (NGD), recognition by E3 ligase ZNF$598$/Hel2, ribosome splitting by Pelota/Dom34-Hbs1, mRNA cleavage, and Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex action (Ltn1, Rqc2).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of ribosome translation, often analogized to a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP). The concepts of codon-specific elongation rates, initiation rates, ribosome queuing, and collision are central to the field of translation dynamics. The given numerical values for elongation rates ($2-6$ codons/s) and initiation time ($1\\,\\text{s}$) are within physiologically plausible ranges for eukaryotic cells. The description of the quality control pathways (NGD, RQC) and the specific protein factors involved (ZNF$598$, Pelota, Ltn1, etc.) is factually correct and represents the current understanding of how cells respond to ribosome stalling. The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a formalizable model with all necessary parameters to arrive at a unique conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a quantitative prediction based on the provided model. The central concept is the extra delay a ribosome experiences when traversing the cluster of rare codons, and whether this delay is sufficient to be caught by a trailing ribosome.\n\n$1$. The time it takes for a ribosome to translate a single ordinary codon is $t_o = \\frac{1}{k_o}$.\n$2$. The time it takes for a ribosome to translate a single rare codon is $t_r = \\frac{1}{k_r}$.\n$3$. The total time to translate the cluster of $m$ rare codons is $T_{cluster} = m \\times t_r = \\frac{m}{k_r}$.\n$4$. If this segment consisted of ordinary codons, the time to translate it would be $T_{ordinary} = m \\times t_o = \\frac{m}{k_o}$.\n$5$. The extra delay, $\\Delta t$, incurred by a ribosome due to the rare-codon cluster is the difference between these two times:\n$$\n\\Delta t = T_{cluster} - T_{ordinary} = \\frac{m}{k_r} - \\frac{m}{k_o} = m \\left( \\frac{1}{k_r} - \\frac{1}{k_o} \\right)\n$$\n$6$. Substituting the given values $m = 4$, $k_r = 2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $k_o = 6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\right) = 4 \\left( 0.5\\,\\text{s} - \\frac{1}{6}\\,\\text{s} \\right)\n$$\nTo be precise:\n$$\n\\Delta t = 4 \\left( \\frac{3}{6}\\,\\text{s} - \\frac{1}{6}\\,\\text{s} \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{2}{6}\\,\\text{s} \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\text{s} \\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\,\\text{s} \\approx 1.33\\,\\text{s}\n$$\n$7$. The problem states that a collision occurs if this extra delay $\\Delta t$ exceeds the inter-ribosome time headway $T_i$.\nWe are given $T_i = 1.0\\,\\text{s}$.\n$8$. Comparing the calculated delay to the headway: $\\Delta t \\approx 1.33\\,\\text{s} > T_i = 1.0\\,\\text{s}$.\nThe condition for collision is met. This will lead to a \"traffic jam\" or queue of ribosomes at the rare-codon cluster.\n\n$9$. The problem states that such collided ribosomes trigger specific cellular quality control pathways. The formation of a collided disome (a pair of adjacent ribosomes) is recognized by the E3 ligase ZNF$598$ (in mammals) or Hel2 (in yeast). This initiates the NGD pathway, leading to ribosome rescue (splitting by Pelota/Dom34-Hbs1), mRNA degradation, and RQC-mediated degradation of the nascent polypeptide chain.\n\n$10$. A rational strategy to alleviate this bottleneck must either reduce the delay $\\Delta t$ or increase the headway $T_i$.\n-   To reduce $\\Delta t$ below $T_i$, one can use synonymous recoding to replace the rare codons with more common, faster-decoded synonymous codons. This would increase the local elongation rate $k_r$, making it closer to $k_o$, thereby decreasing $\\Delta t$.\n-   To increase the headway $T_i$, one could introduce a \"ramp\" of moderately slow codons at the $5'$ end of the mRNA, which would slow down the first few ribosomes and increase their spacing, effectively increasing $T_i$ for all subsequent ribosomes. This would allow the pause site to be tolerated without causing a collision. This approach is beneficial as it can preserve pauses that might be important for co-translational protein folding, thus not increasing proteotoxic stress.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. This option correctly calculates the extra delay $\\Delta t \\approx 1.33\\,\\text{s}$. It correctly compares this to the initiation headway $T_i = 1.0\\,\\text{s}$ to conclude that collisions will occur. It correctly identifies the sequence of events and factors involved in the quality control response to collided ribosomes (ZNF$598$/Hel2, NGD, Pelota/Dom34-Hbs1, RQC), as described in the problem's preamble. It proposes two valid and rational alleviation strategies: synonymous recoding of the cluster to reduce the delay, or adding a $5'$ ramp to increase ribosome spacing, while correctly noting the importance of preserving co-translational folding. This analysis is fully consistent with our derivation from first principles. **Correct**.\n\nB. This option claims that rare-codon clusters impair initiation, which is incorrect; their primary effect is on elongation. It incorrectly concludes that collisions are unlikely, contradicting the calculation. It nonsensically proposes recoding the $3'$ untranslated region, which is not translated and does not contain codons in the relevant sense. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option incorrectly claims that only mRNA secondary structures, not codon usage, cause collisions. It makes a factually incorrect statement that ZNF$598$ recognizes tri-ribosomes rather than disomes. Most critically, it proposes a solution—increasing the initiation rate—that would decrease $T_i$ and therefore *exacerbate* the ribosome collision problem, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of the queuing dynamics. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option introduces an incorrect condition for collision, related to fitting multiple ribosomes within the cluster. It misidentifies the relevant quality control pathway as Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD), which targets premature stop codons, not elongation stalls. The claim that increasing GC-content speeds elongation is an unfounded generalization. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. This option incorrectly claims stalls lead to spontaneous drop-off without ubiquitin signaling, contrary to the established role of RQC. It proposes overexpressing release factor eRF$1$, which is involved in termination at stop codons and has no role in resolving a mid-sequence elongation stall. It falsely claims that synonymous recoding is ineffective, contradicting the well-established principle of codon optimality. **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis is that option A is the only one that correctly applies the model, performs the calculations, and describes the biological consequences and solutions accurately.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2834691"}]}
