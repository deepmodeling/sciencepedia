Translation follows the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, and the mechanistic base for codon recognition is ribonucleic acid base pairing between messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) codons and transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) anticodons within the ribosome. Empirically established “wobble” pairing rules apply at the codon third position (paired with the $5'$ position of the anticodon), whereas the first two positions pair by Watson–Crick rules.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts:\n- At the first two codon positions, only Watson–Crick pairing occurs.\n- At the third codon position (the wobble position), the $5'$ base of the anticodon can pair according to standard wobble rules:\n  - Anticodon $5'$ base $C$ recognizes only codon $3'$ base $G$.\n  - Anticodon $5'$ base $A$ recognizes only codon $3'$ base $U$.\n  - Anticodon $5'$ base $U$ recognizes codon $3'$ bases $A$ and $G$.\n  - Anticodon $5'$ base $G$ recognizes codon $3'$ bases $C$ and $U$.\n- Inosine ($I$) at the anticodon $5'$ position, when present, recognizes codon $3'$ bases $U$, $C$, and $A$.\n\nWithin a single fourfold box (i.e., with the first two codon bases fixed), model decoding of the third position as a set-cover problem over the set of codon third-position identities $\\{U, C, A, G\\}$, where each candidate tRNA species contributes the recognition subset implied by its anticodon $5'$ base.

It is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and factual error. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) species required to decode a fourfold degenerate codon family, where the codons share the first two nucleotides and differ only at the third position. The set of bases at this third codon position is the universe to be decoded, which we denote as $S = \\{U, C, A, G\\}$.\n\nThe decoding capacity of a tRNA species is determined by the $5'$ base of its anticodon, according to the specified wobble pairing rules. This can be formalized as a set-cover problem where we seek the smallest collection of tRNA-specific recognition sets whose union is $S$.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the recognition set for each allowed $5'$ anticodon base. Let $T_X$ be the set of codon $3'$ bases recognized by a tRNA with $5'$ anticodon base $X$.\n\nAccording to the provided rules:\n- An anticodon with $5'$ base $C$ recognizes only codon base $G$: $T_C = \\{G\\}$.\n- An anticodon with $5'$ base $A$ recognizes only codon base $U$: $T_A = \\{U\\}$.\n- An anticodon with $5'$ base $U$ recognizes codon bases $A$ and $G$: $T_U = \\{A, G\\}$.\n- An anticodon with $5'$ base $G$ recognizes codon bases $C$ and $U$: $T_G = \\{C, U\\}$.\n- An anticodon with $5'$ base $I$ (Inosine) recognizes codon bases $U$, $C$, and $A$: $T_I = \\{U, C, A\\}$.\n\nWe will now solve the two specified scenarios.\n\n**Scenario (a): Inosine is not available**\nIn this scenario, the available set of recognition subsets is $\\mathcal{F}_a = \\{T_C, T_A, T_U, T_G\\}$. We must find the minimum number of subsets from $\\mathcal{F}_a$ whose union equals $S = \\{U, C, A, G\\}$.\nLet $n_{\\text{no }I}$ be this minimum number.\n\n$1$. A single tRNA species is insufficient. The largest recognition set in $\\mathcal{F}_a$ is of size $2$ (both $T_U$ and $T_G$). No single tRNA can recognize all $4$ bases. Therefore, $n_{\\text{no }I} > 1$.\n\n$2$. To form a cover for $S$, every element in $S$ must be included in at least one chosen subset.\n- To recognize the codon base $A \\in S$, the only available subset containing $A$ is $T_U = \\{A, G\\}$. Thus, any valid cover *must* include the tRNA species with a $5'$-$U$ anticodon.\n- To recognize the codon base $C \\in S$, the only available subset containing $C$ is $T_G = \\{C, U\\}$. Thus, any valid cover *must* also include the tRNA species with a $5'$-$G$ anticodon.\n\n$3$. This demonstrates that at least $2$ tRNA species are necessary. Let us verify if this necessary set of two tRNAs is also sufficient. The combined recognition set is the union of $T_U$ and $T_G$:\n$$T_U \\cup T_G = \\{A, G\\} \\cup \\{C, U\\} = \\{U, C, A, G\\} = S$$\nThe union covers the entire set $S$. Since $2$ is necessary and sufficient, the minimum number is $2$.\nThus, $n_{\\text{no }I} = 2$.\n\n**Scenario (b): Inosine is available**\nIn this scenario, the available set of recognition subsets is $\\mathcal{F}_b = \\{T_C, T_A, T_U, T_G, T_I\\}$. We must find the minimum number of subsets from $\\mathcal{F}_b$ whose union equals $S$. Let $n_{\\text{with }I}$ be this minimum number.\n\n$1$. A single tRNA species is insufficient. The largest available recognition set is now $T_I = \\{U, C, A\\}$, which has size $3$. This set does not contain the base $G$. Therefore, no single tRNA can recognize all $4$ bases, and $n_{\\text{with }I} > 1$.\n\n$2$. We must find a minimal cover of size $2$ or greater. Let us attempt to construct a cover of size $2$.\n- Consider the most powerful tRNA, the one with anticodon $5'$-$I$, which provides the recognition set $T_I = \\{U, C, A\\}$.\n- After selecting this tRNA, the only remaining codon base to be recognized is $G$.\n- To recognize $G$, we can select a tRNA that covers it. From $\\mathcal{F}_b$, the subset $T_C = \\{G\\}$ (from the tRNA with a $5'$-$C$ anticodon) will suffice.\n\n$3$. The combination of a tRNA with a $5'$-$I$ anticodon and a tRNA with a $5'$-$C$ anticodon provides a total recognition set of:\n$$T_I \\cup T_C = \\{U, C, A\\} \\cup \\{G\\} = \\{U, C, A, G\\} = S$$\nThis combination of $2$ tRNA species is sufficient to decode the entire fourfold box. Since we established that $n_{\\text{with }I} > 1$, the minimal number must be $2$.\nThus, $n_{\\text{with }I} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of minimal numbers $(n_{\\text{no }I}, n_{\\text{with }I})$.

The foundation of this problem lies in the Central Dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to ribonucleic acid (RNA) to protein. The standard genetic code is the set of rules by which the sequence of nucleotide triplets, or codons, in an RNA molecule is translated into the sequence of amino acids comprising a protein. A mutation is defined as synonymous if it results in a new codon that codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. The degeneracy of the genetic code, where multiple codons specify the same amino acid, is what makes synonymous mutations possible.\n\nWe are tasked with calculating the conditional probability $P_k = P(S | E_k)$ for each codon position $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, where $S$ is the event that a random point mutation is synonymous, and $E_k$ is the event that the mutation occurs at position $k$.\n\nThe problem states a specific probabilistic model for a random point mutation:\n1.  A sense codon is chosen uniformly at random from the set of $N_{codon} = 61$ sense codons.\n2.  A position $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is chosen uniformly at random.\n3.

For a fixed position $k$, there are $61$ possible starting codons, and for each codon, there are $3$ possible nucleotide substitutions. Thus, the total number of distinct mutational outcomes for position $k$ is $N_{total,k} = 61 \\times 3 = 183$. Under the given assumptions, each of these $183$ outcomes is equally likely.\n\nThe conditional probability $P_k$ is the ratio of the number of synonymous mutation outcomes at position $k$, denoted $N_{syn, k}$, to the total number of possible mutation outcomes at that position, $N_{total, k}$.\n$$P_k = \\frac{N_{syn, k}}{N_{total, k}} = \\frac{N_{syn, k}}{183}$$\nOur task reduces to the systematic enumeration of $N_{syn, 1}$, $N_{syn, 2}$, and $N_{syn, 3}$ by direct inspection of the standard RNA codon table. A mutation to a stop codon is counted as non-synonymous.\n\n**Calculation for Position $k=3$ (Third Position)**\n\nWe will count the number of synonymous mutations, $N_{syn, 3}$, by analyzing the genetic code table. A synonymous mutation at the third position occurs if a change from $N_1 N_2 N_3$ to $N_1 N_2 N'_3$ results in the same amino acid.

There are $8$ such boxes. For each of the $4$ codons in a box, any of the $3$ possible changes in the third position results in a synonymous codon.

There are no pairs of Serine codons that differ only at the first position.\n\nNo other amino acids are encoded by codons that differ only in their first nucleotide. Therefore, the total number of synonymous mutations at the first position is:\n$N_{syn, 1} = 4 (\\text{from Leu}) + 4 (\\text{from Arg}) = 8$.\n\nThe conditional probability is:\n$$P_1 = \\frac{N_{syn, 1}}{183} = \\frac{8}{183}$$\nSince $183 = 3 \\times 61$, and $8$ is not divisible by $3$ or $61$, this fraction is irreducible.\n\n**Calculation for Position $k=2$ (Second Position)**\n\nA synonymous mutation at the second position requires that two codons, $X N_2 Z$ and $X N'_2 Z$, code for the same amino acid. A systematic inspection of the standard genetic code table reveals that for any fixed first base ($X$) and third base ($Z$), changing the second base ($N_2$) always results in a different amino acid or a stop codon.\nFor example, for $X=U$ and $Z=U$, the codons are UUU (Phe), UCU (Ser), UAU (Tyr), and UGU (Cys). All four amino acids are different. This pattern holds true for all $16$ combinations of $X$ and $Z$. There are no instances where changing only the second nucleotide of a sense codon results in a codon for the same amino acid.\n\nTherefore, the number of synonymous mutations at the second position is:\n$N_{syn, 2} = 0$.\n\nThe conditional probability is:\n$$P_2 = \\frac{N_{syn, 2}}{183} = \\frac{0}{183} = 0$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe conditional probabilities of a synonymous mutation, given the position of the mutation, are:\n-   For position $k=1$: $P_1 = \\frac{8}{183}$\n-   For position $k=2$: $P_2 = 0$\n-   For position $k=3$: $P_3 = \\frac{42}{61}$\n\nThese results quantify the well-known property of the genetic code's structure: degeneracy is concentrated almost entirely at the third codon position, with a minor contribution from the first position and virtually none from the second.

Due to the uniform assumptions, each of these $36$ specific mutation pathways (e.g., $\\text{GGU} \\to \\text{AGU}$) has a probability of $P(\\text{event}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\nWe can now compute the required probabilities by counting the number of favorable outcomes for each category (synonymous, nonsynonymous, nonsense) across all $36$ possibilities and dividing by the total number of outcomes.\n\n-   **Synonymous mutations ($p_{\\mathrm{syn}}$)**:\n    -   From $\\text{GGU}$: $3$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGC}$: $3$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGA}$: $3$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGG}$: $3$ outcomes.\n    Total number of synonymous outcomes is $N_{syn} = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12$.\n    The probability is $p_{\\mathrm{syn}} = \\frac{N_{syn}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n-   **Nonsense mutations ($p_{\\mathrm{stop}}$)**:\n    -   From $\\text{GGU}$: $0$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGC}$: $0$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGA}$: $1$ outcome ($\\text{UGA}$).\n    -   From $\\text{GGG}$: $0$ outcomes.\n    Total number of nonsense outcomes is $N_{stop} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1$.\n    The probability is $p_{\\mathrm{stop}} = \\frac{N_{stop}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\n-   **Nonsynonymous mutations ($p_{\\mathrm{non}}$)**:\n    -   From $\\text{GGU}$: $6$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGC}$: $6$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGA}$: $5$ outcomes.\n    -   From $\\text{GGG}$: $6$ outcomes.\n    Total number of nonsynonymous outcomes is $N_{non} = 6 + 6 + 5 + 6 = 23$.\n    The probability is $p_{\\mathrm{non}} = \\frac{N_{non}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{23}{36}$.\n\nAs a verification, the probabilities must sum to unity:\n$p_{\\mathrm{syn}} + p_{\\mathrm{non}} + p_{\\mathrm{stop}} = \\frac{12}{36} + \\frac{23}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{12+23+1}{36} = \\frac{36}{36} = 1$.\nThe calculation is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector of these probabilities in reduced fractional form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{23}{36} & \\frac{1}{36}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2800908"}]}
