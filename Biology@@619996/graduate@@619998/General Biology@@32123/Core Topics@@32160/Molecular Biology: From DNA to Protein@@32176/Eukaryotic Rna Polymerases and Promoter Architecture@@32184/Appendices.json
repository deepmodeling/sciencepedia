In the wild-type promoter, the dominant Transcription Start Site (TSS) is at position $+1$, and the center of the TATA motif lies at $-28$ relative to $+1$ (that is, the TATA–TSS spacing is approximately $27$ to $30$ base pairs, typical of focused TATA promoters).

This is characteristic of a \"focused TATA promoter\".\n- **Mutant Promoter Architecture**:\n    - An insertion of $2$ base pairs ($2$ bp) is made between the BREu and the TATA motif.\n    - This insertion shifts the TATA motif $2$ bp downstream relative to all other promoter sequences (BREs, $+1$ region).\n    - No other changes are made to the sequence.\n- **Governing Principles**:\n    1.

The roles of the TATA box, TBP, TFIIB, BREs, the fixed TATA-TSS distance in focused promoters, the structure of B-DNA, and the experimental methods (5' RACE, ChIP) are all fundamental concepts in molecular biology. The description is scientifically sound and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clearly defined initial state (wild-type promoter), a specific perturbation (a $2$ bp insertion), and a set of explicit principles to be used for predicting the outcome. This structure allows for a unique, logical deduction.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The numerical values provided ($2$ bp, $-28$, $80^{\\circ}$, $10.5$ bp/turn) are standard and appropriate.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution is derived by systematically applying the given principles to the specified mutation.\n\n**1. Prediction of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) Position:**\nThe critical principle is Principle 3: \"The geometry of the TBP–TFIIB–polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) largely fixes the offset between the TATA motif and the TSS in focused promoters.\" This is often referred to as a \"molecular ruler\" mechanism. The distance from the site of TBP binding (the TATA box) to the polymerase active site (which determines the TSS) is structurally constrained.\n\nIn the wild-type promoter, the TATA box is centered at $-28$, and the TSS is at $+1$. The mutational change is an insertion of $2$ bp that \"shift[s] the TATA motif $2$ base pairs downstream.\" Therefore, the center of the TATA motif in the mutant is now located at position $-28 + 2 = -26$ relative to the original sequence numbering.\n\nSince the TATA-TSS distance is fixed by the PIC, the entire complex will assemble at a position shifted $2$ bp downstream on the DNA template. Consequently, the active site of RNA Polymerase II will also be positioned $2$ bp further downstream. This will cause the dominant TSS to shift from its original position at $+1$ to a new position at $+1 + 2 = +3$.\n\n**2. Prediction of TFIIB Recruitment:**\nThe relevant principles are Principle 2 and Principle 4. Principle 2 states that TFIIB binds to the TBP-TATA complex and also contacts the DNA at the BREu and BREd. The mutation involves an insertion of $2$ bp *between* the BREu and the TATA motif. The BREd position relative to the TATA box is unaffected.\n\nThe insertion increases the linear spacing between the BREu and the TATA motif by $2$ bp. According to Principle 4, B-form DNA has a helical repeat of approximately $10.5$ bp per turn. The insertion of $2$ bp will therefore cause a rotational change of the BREu relative to the TATA box. The angular displacement is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Rotation} = \\frac{\\Delta(\\text{spacing})}{\\text{helical repeat}} \\times 360^{\\circ} = \\frac{2 \\text{ bp}}{10.5 \\text{ bp/turn}} \\times 360^{\\circ} \\approx 68.6^{\\circ} $$\nThe TFIIB protein must make specific stereochemical contacts with both the TBP-DNA complex and the BREu. A rotational misalignment of nearly $70^{\\circ}$ will move the BREu significantly around the helical axis, away from the face of the DNA where TFIIB expects to bind. This suboptimal geometry will destabilize the TFIIB-promoter interaction, leading to a decrease in binding affinity and, consequently, reduced recruitment of TFIIB to the promoter. The reduction is expected to be measurable but not necessarily a complete abolition of binding, so the term \"modestly reduced\" is appropriate.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- The dominant TSS will shift downstream by $2$ bp.\n- TFIIB recruitment will be reduced due to rotational misalignment between the TATA box and the BREu.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The dominant TSS remains at $+1$ because polymerase scanning finds the same initiation site, but TFIIB recruitment decreases due to misalignment with BREs; test by $5^{\\prime}$ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) showing an unchanged TSS distribution and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for TFIIB showing reduced occupancy.**\n- TSS Prediction: Incorrect. This invokes a \"scanning\" mechanism, which contradicts the \"fixed offset\" (ruler) mechanism stipulated for focused promoters in Principle 3.\n- TFIIB Prediction: Correct. The reasoning for decreased recruitment is sound.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. The prediction regarding the TSS is inconsistent with the problem's stated principles.\n\n**B. The dominant TSS shifts downstream by approximately one full helical turn (about $10$ base pairs) to restore rotational alignment, while TFIIB recruitment is unchanged; test by $5^{\\prime}$ RACE showing a $\\sim 10$ base pair downstream shift with similar TFIIB ChIP.**\n- TSS Prediction: Incorrect. A shift of $\\sim 10$ bp would grossly violate the fixed TATA-TSS offset of $\\sim 27-30$ bp (the new distance would be $\\sim 36$ bp). The system prioritizes the linear distance, not helical phasing for the TSS.\n- TFIIB Prediction: Incorrect. It is illogical to assume that TFIIB recruitment is unchanged when the spacing between its contact points (TATA and BREu) has been altered.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. Both predictions are flawed.\n\n**C. The dominant TSS shifts downstream by $2$ base pairs to preserve the typical TATA–TSS offset, and TFIIB recruitment is modestly reduced due to suboptimal BRE geometry caused by a $\\sim 2/10.5$ turn rotation; test by $5^{\\prime}$ RACE showing a $2$ base pair downstream shift and TFIIB ChIP or in vitro footprinting showing a measurable but partial decrease.**\n- TSS Prediction: Correct. This is the direct consequence of the \"molecular ruler\" model (Principle 3) applied to a $2$ bp downstream shift of the TATA box.\n- TFIIB Prediction: Correct. This accurately describes the effect of the $2$ bp insertion on the rotational alignment between the TATA box and BREu, leading to reduced binding (Principles 2 and 4).\n- Experimental Tests: Correct. 5' RACE is the proper technique to map TSS positions with high resolution. ChIP is the standard method to measure in vivo protein occupancy on DNA.\n- Verdict: **Correct**. This option is entirely consistent with the derived predictions based on all given principles.\n\n**D. The dominant TSS shifts upstream by $2$ base pairs to compensate for the downstream TATA shift and maintain the original base-pair register, while TFIIB recruitment increases because TBP bending enhances BRE contacts; test by $5^{\\prime}$ RACE showing a $2$ base pair upstream shift and increased TFIIB ChIP.**\n- TSS Prediction: Incorrect. The logic is backwards. An upstream TSS shift combined with a downstream TATA shift would shorten the TATA-TSS distance by $4$ bp, violating Principle 3.\n- TFIIB Prediction: Incorrect. The mutation introduces a steric and rotational mismatch, which is expected to hinder, not enhance, TFIIB binding.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. Both predictions are fundamentally flawed.\n\n**E. Neither the dominant TSS nor TFIIB recruitment changes measurably because TBP–TFIIB geometry tolerates small spacing perturbations; test by $5^{\\prime}$ RACE and TFIIB ChIP both showing no change within $1$ base pair resolution or within experimental error.**\n- TSS Prediction: Incorrect. While biological complexes possess some flexibility, Principle 3 states the offset is \"largely fixed.\" A complete lack of response to a $2$ bp shift of the anchor point is inconsistent with this principle.\n- TFIIB Prediction: Incorrect. A rotational shift of $\\sim 70^{\\circ}$ is not a \"small perturbation\" in the context of specific protein-DNA contacts. It is expected to have a measurable, negative impact on binding affinity.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. This option posits an unrealistic degree of structural tolerance that contradicts the specificity implied by the problem's principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2797663"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative principles to quantitative predictions is a key step in modern biology.

We proceed with a solution derived from first principles.\n\nThe central premise is that promoter strength, which we denote by $P$, is proportional to the probability of forming the functional pre-initiation complex. The model specifies this complex requires both TATA-binding protein (TBP) and Transcription Factor IIB (TFIIB) to be simultaneously bound to their respective DNA motifs. In the framework of statistical thermodynamics, this probability is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, or statistical weight, of the doubly bound state. The promoter strength is therefore given by:\n$$P \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{total}}$ is the total free energy of the doubly bound state relative to a reference state of unbound components, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe total energy $E_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of three distinct contributions: the binding free energy of TBP ($E_{\\text{TBP}}$), the binding free energy of TFIIB ($E_{\\text{TFIIB}}$), and the energetic penalty due to a non-optimal promoter architecture ($\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{arch}}$).

This is equivalent to $30$ million mapped reads.\n- Length of a single promoter window is $L_{\\text{prom}} = 200$ bp, which is $0.2$ kilobases (kb).\n- The total length of all promoter windows for $N_{\\text{genes}} = 10,000$ genes is:\n$$ L_{\\text{total, prom}} = N_{\\text{genes}} \\times L_{\\text{prom}} = 10,000 \\times 200 \\text{ bp} = 2 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ bp} = 2000 \\text{ kb} $$\nUsing the RPKM definition, the metagene promoter signal is:\n$$ S_{\\text{prom, Ser5P}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{prom, Ser5P}}}{(\\text{Total promoter length in kb}) \\times (\\text{Ser5P library size in millions})} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{6}}{2000 \\times 30} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{6}}{60,000} = 100 $$\n\nSecond, we compute the metagene gene-body signal, denoted as $S_{\\text{gb, Ser2P}}$. This is the aggregated RPKM for the Ser2P dataset over all gene-body windows.\nThe given values for this calculation are:\n- Total reads overlapping all gene-body windows: $C_{\\text{gb, Ser2P}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{7}$.\n- Total library size: $M_{\\text{Ser2P}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{7}$ reads. This is equivalent to $40$ million mapped reads.\n- Length of a single gene-body window is $L_{\\text{gb}} = 4000$ bp, which is $4.0$ kb.\n- The total length of all gene-body windows for $N_{\\text{genes}} = 10,000$ genes is:\n$$ L_{\\text{total, gb}} = N_{\\text{genes}} \\times L_{\\text{gb}} = 10,000 \\times 4000 \\text{ bp} = 4 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ bp} = 40,000 \\text{ kb} $$\nUsing the RPKM definition, the metagene gene-body signal is:\n$$ S_{\\text{gb, Ser2P}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{gb, Ser2P}}}{(\\text{Total gene-body length in kb}) \\times (\\text{Ser2P library size in millions})} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{7}}{40,000 \\times 40} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{7}}{1.6 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{12}{1.6} = 7.5 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the phospho-Pol II pausing index $P$, which is the ratio of these two signals.\n$$ P = \\frac{S_{\\text{prom, Ser5P}}}{S_{\\text{gb, Ser2P}}} = \\frac{100}{7.5} $$\nThe exact value is $P = \\frac{1000}{75} = \\frac{40}{3} = 13.\\overline{3}$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ P \\approx 13.3 $$\nThis value is a unitless ratio, as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{13.3} $$", "id": "2797609"}]}
