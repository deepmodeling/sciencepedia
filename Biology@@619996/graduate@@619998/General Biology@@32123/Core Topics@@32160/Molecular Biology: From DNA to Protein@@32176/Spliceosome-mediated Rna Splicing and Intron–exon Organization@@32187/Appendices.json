The roles of U1 snRNP, the $5'$ splice site, spliceosome assembly intermediates (A and B complexes), helicases like PRP28, and regulatory elements like ESEs are all standard textbook knowledge in molecular biology.

It provides a specific mutation scenario and sufficient background information and parameters to reason about its consequences. A unique, logical conclusion can be derived about the kinetic and thermodynamic effects on the splicing pathway.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. All terms are standard in the field.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete for the question asked, realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem focuses on a mutation in the $5'$ splice site that introduces $2$ mismatches in the duplex formed with U1 snRNA. We must analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic consequences for spliceosome assembly.\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Analysis of U1:donor Interaction**\n    The stability of the U1:donor duplex is determined by its free energy of formation, $\\Delta G$. A more stable duplex has a more negative $\\Delta G$. The problem provides parameters to estimate the change in $\\Delta G$ due to the mutation.\n    For each of the $2$ mutations, a Watson-Crick base pair is replaced by a mismatch.\n    - Loss of one matched pair: destabilization of $-(-2.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}) = +2.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}$.\n    - Gain of one mismatch: destabilization of $+2.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}$.\n    The total change in free energy, $\\Delta(\\Delta G)$, for each of the $2$ mutated sites is approximately $+4.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}$. For $2$ mismatches, the total destabilization is:\n    $$ \\Delta(\\Delta G) = 2 \\times (+4.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}) = +8.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}} $$\n    The equilibrium occupancy of U1 snRNP at the $5'$ splice site is proportional to $\\exp(-\\Delta G/RT)$. The ratio of the mutant occupancy ($Occ_{mut}$) to the wild-type occupancy ($Occ_{wt}$) is:\n    $$ \\frac{Occ_{mut}}{Occ_{wt}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{mut}/RT)}{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{wt}/RT)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{mut} - \\Delta G_{wt}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G)}{RT}\\right) $$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$ \\frac{Occ_{mut}}{Occ_{wt}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}}{0.616 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-13.0) \\approx 2.2 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n    This calculation, though an approximation, demonstrates that the mutation leads to a dramatic decrease in the stability of the U1:donor duplex, reducing the steady-state occupancy of U1 snRNP at the mutant $5'$ splice site by several orders of magnitude.\n\n2.  **Kinetic Analysis of Spliceosome Assembly**\n    Spliceosome assembly proceeds sequentially. The formation of the A complex requires the stable binding of U1 snRNP to the $5'$ splice site and U2 snRNP to the branchpoint.\n    - **A Complex Formation**: Since the U1:donor interaction is severely weakened, the formation of the A complex will be highly inefficient. The equilibrium `pre-mRNA + U1 <=> pre-mRNA:U1` is strongly shifted to the left. This makes A complex assembly the rate-limiting step for the entire splicing pathway.\n    - **A $\\rightarrow$ B Transition**: This transition involves the recruitment of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP and the subsequent displacement of U1 by U6 at the $5'$ splice site, a step facilitated by the helicase PRP28. The question asks for the impact on the $A \\rightarrow B$ flux. Flux (or velocity) through this step is dependent on the concentration of the substrate (A complex) and the rate constant for the transition ($k_{A \\to B}$).\n    $$ \\mathrm{Flux} (A \\rightarrow B) = k_{A \\to B} \\times [\\text{A complex}] $$\n    The mutation has two opposing potential effects on this step:\n    - It drastically reduces $[\\text{A complex}]$, as shown thermodynamically.\n    - It might increase $k_{A \\to B}$ because the less stable U1:donor duplex is easier for PRP28 to unwind and displace.\n    However, the reduction in $[\\text{A complex}]$ is by a factor of $\\approx 10^6$. Any plausible increase in $k_{A \\to B}$ would be minor in comparison. Therefore, the dominant effect is the massive reduction in A complex substrate, leading to a profound decrease in the overall flux from A to B complex.\n\n3.  **Compensatory Mechanisms**\n    To rescue splicing, one must address the primary defect: the extraordinarily weak binding of U1 to the mutant $5'$ splice site.\n    - **Direct Compensation**: The most direct way is to restore the Watson-Crick base pairing. This can be achieved by introducing compensatory mutations in the $5'$ region of the U1 snRNA itself, making it complementary to the *mutant* donor site sequence. This is a classic example of informational suppression.\n    - **Indirect Compensation**: The problem states that SR proteins bound to ESEs help recruit U1 snRNP. By strengthening these auxiliary interactions—for instance, by creating a stronger ESE sequence or increasing the concentration/activity of the relevant SR proteins—one could partially stabilize U1 snRNP binding at the weak $5'$ splice site and enhance A complex formation, thereby increasing splicing efficiency.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The decreased duplex stability lowers the steady-state occupancy of U1 snRNP at the $5'$ splice site by orders of magnitude, making A complex assembly rate-limiting and reducing overall $A \\rightarrow B$ flux, despite potentially easier U1 release in the rare A complexes that do form. Complementary “suppressor” mutations in U1 small nuclear RNA that restore Watson–Crick pairing to the mutant $5'$ splice site and/or strengthening ESE–SR protein recruitment would be expected to compensate.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n- It correctly identifies the thermodynamic consequence: a reduction in U1 occupancy by \"orders of magnitude\". Our calculation supports this.\n- It correctly identifies the kinetic consequence: A complex assembly becomes rate-limiting, which reduces the overall $A \\rightarrow B$ flux.\n- It correctly acknowledges the minor, opposing effect of \"easier U1 release\" but identifies it as non-dominant.\n- It correctly proposes the two most logical and well-documented compensatory mechanisms: a suppressor mutation in U1 snRNA (direct) and enhancement of ESE-SR protein interactions (indirect).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Weaker U1:donor pairing specifically accelerates the $A \\rightarrow B$ transition because U1 snRNP releases more readily, thereby increasing B complex formation. Overexpression of PRP28 alone should further enhance this acceleration without additional changes.**\nThis option is flawed. It focuses solely on the increased rate of U1 release from the A complex, ignoring the fact that the concentration of A complex itself is severely diminished. The overall flux cannot increase if the substrate for the reaction is virtually absent. Overexpressing PRP28 would be futile if there are no U1:donor duplexes (within an A complex) for it to act upon.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The mutant $5'$ splice site prevents U1 snRNP displacement, trapping the spliceosome at B complex; reducing U6 small nuclear RNA pairing to the $5'$ splice site would alleviate the block and restore $A \\rightarrow B$ progression.**\nThis option contains multiple errors.\n- A weaker U1:donor interaction would facilitate, not prevent, U1 displacement.\n- The block in assembly occurs at the formation of A complex, long before the cell has a chance to be \"trapped at B complex\".\n- U6 pairing to the $5'$ splice site is what defines the active site and is essential for the catalytic steps that follow B complex formation. Reducing this interaction would inhibit, not restore, splicing.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. There is negligible effect on $A \\rightarrow B$ because recognition of the $3'$ splice site by U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) dominates assembly kinetics. Enhancing the polypyrimidine tract at the $3'$ splice site would be the most direct compensation for the $2$-mismatch defect at the $5'$ splice site.**\nThis option is incorrect. A change in binding energy of $+8.0 \\ \\mathrm{kcal \\ mol^{-1}}$ is massive and cannot have a \"negligible effect\". While recognition of the $3'$ splice site is crucial, spliceosome assembly requires the coordinated recognition of *both* the $5'$ and $3'$ ends of the intron to form the cross-intron A complex. A severe defect at the $5'$ end cannot be fully compensated by a strong $3'$ end. Furthermore, enhancing the $3'$ splice site is an indirect compensation strategy, not the \"most direct\" one. The most direct compensation is to fix the mutated interaction itself, as described in option A.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2837728"}, {"introduction": "Once assembled, the spliceosome transforms into a dynamic catalytic machine. This practice delves into the chemical heart of splicing—the first transesterification reaction—focusing on the precise role of the branchpoint adenosine as the key nucleophile.

In spliceosome-mediated splicing, the first catalytic step is a transesterification in which the branchpoint nucleotide’s ribose $2'$-hydroxyl ($2'$-OH) attacks the phosphodiester at the $5'$ splice site, yielding a $2'$–$5'$ phosphodiester linkage (the intron lariat) and freeing the upstream exon’s $3'$-OH. The catalysis occurs in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) active site that uses two divalent metal ions (commonly $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) and requires an in-line attack geometry (nucleophile, phosphorus, and leaving group approximately colinear, near $180^{\\circ}$). Accurate positioning of the branchpoint nucleotide is achieved by base-pairing of the intron to U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) within the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which bulges the branchpoint adenosine and orients its $2'$-OH into the catalytic core stabilized by proteins such as SF3B subunits. \n\nConsider a hypothetical mutation that changes the branchpoint adenosine to guanosine in an otherwise canonical intron, with all spliceosomal components present and saturating $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.

The description of spliceosome-mediated RNA splicing, including the roles of the branchpoint adenosine, the $2'$-OH nucleophile, the two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism, the requirement for in-line attack geometry, and the function of U2 snRNP in positioning the branchpoint, is a correct representation of established principles in molecular and structural biology. The problem is well-posed, presenting a specific, plausible mutation and asking for its consequence based on the provided mechanistic framework. The constraints are clearly defined, leading to a non-ambiguous interpretive path. The language is objective and technical. There are no identifiable violations of scientific facts, logical consistency, or formal structure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe central premise of spliceosome catalysis is the exquisitely precise three-dimensional arrangement of reactants within the active site. The first transesterification requires the nucleophilic $2'$-hydroxyl of the branchpoint nucleotide to be positioned for an in-line $\\mathrm{S_N2}$-type attack on the phosphorus atom of the $5'$ splice site phosphodiester bond. The problem correctly states that this positioning is not a stochastic event but is strictly enforced by the spliceosome machinery.\n\nThe U2 snRNP, in conjunction with associated proteins like the SF3B complex, is responsible for recognizing the branchpoint sequence and singling out the branchpoint nucleotide. This recognition involves specific base-pairing between the U2 snRNA and the intron sequence flanking the branchpoint nucleotide. This interaction is designed to extrude, or \"bulge,\" the branchpoint nucleotide—canonically an adenosine—from the newly formed RNA duplex. This bulging action forces the ribose moiety of the adenosine into a specific conformation, which in turn orients its $2'$-OH group into the catalytic core, placing it in the precise location and orientation relative to the scissile phosphate and the catalytic $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions.\n\nThe identity of the base is paramount. Adenosine and guanosine are both purines, but their structures and hydrogen-bonding capabilities differ. Adenosine has an amino group at the $C6$ position, while guanosine has a carbonyl at $C6$ and an amino group at the $C2$ position. The pocket in the spliceosomal active site, formed by U2 snRNA and proteins, is evolved to specifically accommodate an adenosine at the bulged position. A guanosine base will not establish the same set of specific hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts required for correct positioning.\n\nThe consequence of mutating the branchpoint adenosine to guanosine is a failure of this precise recognition and positioning step. The spliceosome may still assemble on the pre-mRNA, potentially reaching the pre-catalytic B complex. However, the guanosine at the branchpoint site will either prevent the final conformational activation of the spliceosome (to B* or C complex) or will be positioned incorrectly within the active site. An improperly positioned nucleophile cannot achieve the required in-line attack geometry (approximately $180^{\\circ}$ angle between the $2'$-O, the phosphorus, and the $5'$-O of the leaving group). Without this stringent stereochemical alignment, the activation energy for the transesterification is insurmountably high, and the reaction will not proceed at any significant rate.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and severe consequence is the abolition of the first catalytic step. The spliceosome will stall before or at the first chemical step.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The first transesterification at the mutated site is abolished; the spliceosome either stalls before catalysis or fails the first step because guanosine cannot be bulged and positioned to achieve an in-line $2'$-OH attack under the spliceosomal active-site geometry.**\nThis option accurately describes the expected outcome. The failure is rooted in stereochemical incompatibility. The active site is specific for adenosine, and the substitution with guanosine disrupts the precise positioning required for the in-line nucleophilic attack by the $2'$-OH. This leads to catalytic failure.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The first transesterification proceeds at normal rates because the ribose $2'$-OH is still present; base identity at the branchpoint is irrelevant to catalysis once the spliceosome assembles.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It dismisses the central role of base recognition in positioning the functional group (the $2'$-OH). In enzyme catalysis, particularly in a complex RNP machine like the spliceosome, substrate specificity is critical. The base is the \"handle\" by which the machinery grasps and orients the ribose sugar. If the base identity were irrelevant, the high conservation of adenosine at this position would be inexplicable.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The first transesterification switches to use the $3'$-OH of the branchpoint guanosine as the nucleophile, producing a linear intron–exon intermediate instead of a lariat.**\nThis proposes an alternative chemistry that the spliceosomal active site is not configured to perform. The entire architecture is built to present the $2'$-OH, not the $3'$-OH, as the nucleophile. Selecting the $3'$-OH would require radical, and likely impossible, refolding of the RNA substrate within the active site. Furthermore, an attack by a $3'$-OH would not produce a lariat structure, which is defined by its unusual $2'–5'$ phosphodiester linkage. The premise is biochemically unsound.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The first transesterification becomes dependent on an exogenous guanosine cofactor, analogous to group I intron chemistry, thereby rescuing splicing despite the branchpoint mutation.**\nThis option incorrectly conflates the mechanism of spliceosome-mediated splicing with that of group I self-splicing introns. The spliceosome uses an endogenous nucleophile from the pre-mRNA itself. Group I introns use an exogenous guanosine nucleophile. These are fundamentally different catalytic strategies. There is no known mechanism by which a spliceosome could adopt a group I-like mechanism, and it is a baseless speculation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The first transesterification proceeds at the mutated site but produces a lariat with a $3'$–$5'$ linkage rather than a $2'$–$5'$ linkage due to an altered sugar pucker enforced by guanosine.**\nThis option is chemically nonsensical. A lariat is a branched RNA structure. A $3'–5'$ phosphodiester linkage is the standard, linear bond that constitutes the RNA backbone. It is impossible to form a branch, and thus a lariat, using only $3'–5'$ linkages. The nucleophile for branching must come from a position not already in the backbone, which is the $2'$-OH. The premise is built on a misunderstanding of RNA chemistry and the definition of a lariat.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2837716"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the canonical dogma, RNA splicing generates immense proteomic diversity through alternative splicing, where different combinations of exons are joined together.

Its abundance, $I_{skip}$, is therefore proportional to this normalized rate:\n$$ k \\cdot I_{skip} = \\frac{R_{C1C2}}{s \\cdot \\ell_{C1C2}} $$\nThus, an estimate of the skipping isoform's abundance, which we shall denote $\\hat{I}_{skip}$, is proportional to the read density on its junction:\n$$ \\hat{I}_{skip} \\propto \\frac{R_{C1C2}}{\\ell_{C1C2}} $$\n\nFor the inclusion isoform, two junctions, $C1\\!-\\!A$ and $A\\!-\\!C2$, are uniquely produced. Each provides an independent estimate of the isoform's abundance:\n$$ k \\cdot I_{inc} = \\frac{R_{C1A}}{s \\cdot \\ell_{C1A}} $$\n$$ k \\cdot I_{inc} = \\frac{R_{AC2}}{s \\cdot \\ell_{AC2}} $$\nTo obtain a single, robust estimate for the abundance of the inclusion isoform, $\\hat{I}_{inc}$, we must combine the information from both junctions. A logical and statistically sound method is to average the two normalized rates. This mitigates the noise inherent in the measurement of any single junction.\n$$ k \\cdot I_{inc} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{R_{C1A}}{s \\cdot \\ell_{C1A}} + \\frac{R_{AC2}}{s \\cdot \\ell_{AC2}} \\right) $$\nTherefore, the estimate of the inclusion isoform's abundance is:\n$$ \\hat{I}_{inc} \\propto \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{R_{C1A}}{\\ell_{C1A}} + \\frac{R_{AC2}}{\\ell_{AC2}} \\right) $$\n\nThe percent-spliced-in, $\\Psi$, is defined as the fractional abundance of the inclusion isoform relative to the total abundance of both isoforms involved in the cassette exon event.\n$$ \\Psi = \\frac{I_{inc}}{I_{inc} + I_{skip}} $$\nWe can estimate $\\Psi$ by substituting our derived isoform abundance estimators. The proportionality constant $k$ and the library size scaling factor $s$ are common to all terms and will cancel in the ratio, hence they can be omitted.\n$$ \\Psi = \\frac{\\hat{I}_{inc}}{\\hat{I}_{inc} + \\hat{I}_{skip}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{R_{C1A}}{\\ell_{C1A}} + \\frac{R_{AC2}}{\\ell_{AC2}} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{R_{C1A}}{\\ell_{C1A}} + \\frac{R_{AC2}}{\\ell_{AC2}} \\right) + \\frac{R_{C1C2}}{\\ell_{C1C2}}} $$\nThis is the first-principles definition of $\\Psi$ based on the given assumptions.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value for $\\Psi$ using the provided data:\n- $R_{C1A} = 180$, $\\ell_{C1A} = 75$\n- $R_{AC2} = 220$, $\\ell_{AC2} = 65$\n- $R_{C1C2} = 150$, $\\ell_{C1C2} = 100$\n\nFirst, calculate the junction read densities (proportional to isoform abundances):\nThe density for the first inclusion junction is $\\frac{R_{C1A}}{\\ell_{C1A}} = \\frac{180}{75} = 2.4$.\nThe density for the second inclusion junction is $\\frac{R_{AC2}}{\\ell_{AC2}} = \\frac{220}{65} = \\frac{44}{13}$.\nThe density for the skipping junction is $\\frac{R_{C1C2}}{\\ell_{C1C2}} = \\frac{150}{100} = 1.5$.\n\nNext, calculate the estimated abundance proxies.\nThe proxy for inclusion abundance, $\\hat{I}_{inc}$, is the average of the inclusion junction densities:\n$$ \\hat{I}_{inc} \\propto \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2.4 + \\frac{44}{13} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{12}{5} + \\frac{44}{13} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{12 \\times 13 + 44 \\times 5}{5 \\times 13} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{156 + 220}{65} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{376}{65} \\right) = \\frac{188}{65} $$\nThe proxy for skipping abundance, $\\hat{I}_{skip}$, is the density of the skipping junction:\n$$ \\hat{I}_{skip} \\propto 1.5 = \\frac{3}{2} $$\n\nFinally, we compute $\\Psi$:\n$$ \\Psi = \\frac{\\hat{I}_{inc}}{\\hat{I}_{inc} + \\hat{I}_{skip}} = \\frac{\\frac{188}{65}}{\\frac{188}{65} + \\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{188}{65}}{\\frac{2 \\times 188 + 3 \\times 65}{65 \\times 2}} = \\frac{\\frac{188}{65}}{\\frac{376 + 195}{130}} = \\frac{188}{65} \\times \\frac{130}{571} = \\frac{188 \\times 2}{571} = \\frac{376}{571} $$\nConverting this exact fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\Psi = \\frac{376}{571} \\approx 0.6584938704... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as required, we obtain $0.6585$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6585}$$", "id": "2837726"}]}
