The system under consideration is the axo-glial septate-like junction at the paranode of a central nervous system myelinated axon.\n2.  The junction is formed by oligodendrocyte Neurofascin-155 (NF155) interacting with axonal partners (Contactin-1 and Caspr).\n3.  The junction acts as a lateral diffusion barrier.\n4.

Permeability $P$ scales inversely with the junctional adhesion energy per unit area, $E_{j}$: $P \\propto 1/E_{j}$.\n6.  Junctional adhesion energy per unit area is given by $E_{j} = \\epsilon_{\\text{bond}} \\, n_{b}$, where $\\epsilon_{\\text{bond}}$ is the average bond energy and $n_{b}$ is the areal density of axo-glial adhesion bonds.\n7.  Axonal partners are abundant and not limiting; bond density $n_{b}$ is proportional to the surface density of NF155 on the oligodendrocyte: $n_{b} \\propto \\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$.\n8.  Junctional geometry and $\\epsilon_{\\text{bond}}$ are constant.\n9.  There is no compensatory upregulation on the axonal side.\n10. A perturbation is introduced: the surface expression of NF155 is reduced by $50\\%$, so that the new density $\\rho'_{\\text{NF155}} = 0.5\\, \\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is subjected to scrutiny based on the principles of scientific validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in fundamental biophysical principles. The use of Fick's law, the concept of permeability as an inverse barrier height, and the modeling of adhesion energy as a function of bond density are standard approaches in quantitative cell biology. The molecular components mentioned (NF155, Caspr, Contactin-1) are indeed the core constituents of the paranodal axo-glial junction. The model is a simplification, but it is built upon sound scientific and physical logic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of clear, non-contradictory relationships and a single, well-defined perturbation. The question asks for the direct consequence of this perturbation within the provided framework, which allows for the derivation of a unique answer.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. All relationships are given as mathematical definitions or proportionalities, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to establish a clear chain of reasoning from the input variable ($\\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$) to the output variable ($H$). It explicitly states which parameters are constant ($\\epsilon_{\\text{bond}}$, geometry) and which assumptions to make (no compensation, unsaturated binding).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a logical, self-consistent, and scientifically reasonable modeling exercise. We may proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine how the effective barrier height $H$ changes in response to a $50\\%$ reduction in the surface density of NF155, $\\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$. We will derive the relationship between $H$ and $\\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$ from the given premises.\n\n1.  The barrier height $H$ is defined as the inverse of permeability $P$:\n    $$H \\equiv \\frac{1}{P}$$\n2.  The permeability $P$ is given to be inversely proportional to the junctional adhesion energy per unit area, $E_{j}$:\n    $$P \\propto \\frac{1}{E_{j}}$$\n3.  Substituting the expression for $P$ into the definition of $H$, we find that $H$ is directly proportional to $E_{j}$:\n    $$H \\propto E_{j}$$\n4.  The adhesion energy $E_{j}$ is defined as the product of the average bond energy, $\\epsilon_{\\text{bond}}$, and the areal density of bonds, $n_{b}$:\n    $$E_{j} = \\epsilon_{\\text{bond}} \\, n_{b}$$\n5.  It is stated that $\\epsilon_{\\text{bond}}$ and junctional geometry are constant. Therefore, $E_{j}$ is directly proportional to the bond density $n_{b}$:\n    $$E_{j} \\propto n_{b}$$\n6.  From the transitivity of these proportionalities (steps 3 and 5), we conclude that the barrier height $H$ is directly proportional to the bond density $n_{b}$:\n    $$H \\propto n_{b}$$\n7.  Finally, the problem states that under the given conditions (unsaturated binding, abundant axonal partners), the bond density $n_{b}$ is directly proportional to the surface density of NF155, $\\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$:\n    $$n_{b} \\propto \\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$$\n8.  Combining the results from steps 6 and 7 yields the final, crucial relationship for this model:\n    $$H \\propto \\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$$\n    This shows that the effective barrier height is directly proportional to the surface density of NF155.\n\nNow, we apply the specified perturbation. Let the initial state variables be $H_{initial}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{NF155, initial}}$, and the final state variables be $H_{final}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{NF155, final}}$. The experimental manipulation is:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{NF155, final}} = 0.5 \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{NF155, initial}}$$\nBecause $H$ is directly proportional to $\\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$, we can write $H = k \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The final barrier height is then:\n$$H_{final} = k \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{NF155, final}} = k \\cdot (0.5 \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{NF155, initial}}) = 0.5 \\cdot (k \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{NF155, initial}}) = 0.5 \\cdot H_{initial}$$\nThe barrier height is reduced to $50\\%$ of its original value.\n\nWe can also calculate the change in permeability $P$.\n$$P_{final} = \\frac{1}{H_{final}} = \\frac{1}{0.5 \\cdot H_{initial}} = \\frac{1}{0.5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{H_{initial}} = 2 \\cdot P_{initial}$$\nThe permeability doubles.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **The barrier height is reduced by approximately $50\\%$ (i.e., $H \\to 0.5\\,H$), with a concomitant doubling of permeability.**\nThis statement is a direct consequence of our derivation. The barrier height is reduced to $50\\%$ of its initial value, and the permeability, being the inverse of the height, doubles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **The barrier height is reduced by approximately $25\\%$ (i.e., $H \\to 0.75\\,H$) due to cooperative stabilization among junctional complexes.**\nThe model provided is based on simple proportionalities. It lacks terms that would describe cooperative effects. The relationship $E_{j} = \\epsilon_{\\text{bond}} \\, n_{b}$ is linear, not nonlinear as would be expected with cooperativity. This option introduces a physical phenomenon not included in the problem's explicit assumptions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **There is no significant change in barrier height because axonal partners compensate by upregulating contactin expression to maintain $E_{j}$.**\nThis statement directly contradicts a premise of the problem: \"there is no compensatory upregulation on the axonal side on the time scale considered.\" Therefore, this option must be rejected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **The barrier height increases by approximately $50\\%$ (i.e., $H \\to 1.5\\,H$) because fewer NF155 molecules allow tighter packing of the remaining junctions.**\nOur derivation shows a decrease in barrier height, not an increase. The notion of \"tighter packing\" implies a change in $\\epsilon_{\\text{bond}}$ or a more complex relationship between $E_j$ and $n_b$, neither of which is part of the specified model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. **The barrier height collapses to $0$ (i.e., $H \\to 0$) because septate junctions cannot form when NF155 is reduced by $50\\%$.**\nThe linear model predicts a proportional response. A $50\\%$ reduction in the cause ($\\rho_{\\text{NF155}}$) leads to a $50\\%$ reduction in the effect ($H$). A total collapse to zero would imply a critical threshold effect, which is a nonlinear phenomenon not described by the simple proportionalities of the given model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2729288"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the node's current-generating capacity and its structural containment, we can now integrate these concepts to understand their impact on the axon's primary function: information transmission.

Otherwise, compute $t_{\\text{hop}} = -\\tau \\ln(1 - I_{\\min}/\\mu_I)$ and then $v = L_{\\text{hop}}/t_{\\text{hop}}$.\n- For failure probability, if $\\mathrm{CV} = 0$ then set $p_{\\text{node}}$ deterministically as above; otherwise compute $\\sigma_I = \\mathrm{CV} \\, \\mu_I$ and $p_{\\text{node}} = \\Phi((I_{\\min} - \\mu_I)/\\sigma_I)$. Then set $p_{\\text{total}} = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{node}})^{N_{\\text{hops}}}$.\n- Round $v$ to two decimal places in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $p_{\\text{total}}$ to four decimal places, and output the results for all five specified test cases in order as a single line containing a list of lists.\n\nThis algorithm directly implements the derived expressions and adheres to the specified scientific assumptions and units.
