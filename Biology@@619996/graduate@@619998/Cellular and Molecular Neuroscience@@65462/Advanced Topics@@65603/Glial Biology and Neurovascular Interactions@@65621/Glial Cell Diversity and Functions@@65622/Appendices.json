It is a standard exercise in biophysical modeling that requires the application of first principles from electromagnetism and circuit theory. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is derived in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of membrane capacitance per unit length $c_{m}(n)$.\nThe thin-shell approximation ($t \\ll a$) allows us to model a cylindrical capacitor as a parallel-plate capacitor. The area of this capacitor, for a unit length ($L=1$) of the axon, is the surface area of the inner cylinder, $A_{L=1} = 2 \\pi a \\times 1 = 2 \\pi a$.\n\nA single myelin lamella of thickness $d$ and dielectric constant $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}$ can be treated as a single parallel-plate capacitor. Its capacitance per unit area, or specific capacitance, is given by:\n$$C_{\\text{s,single}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{d} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d}$$\nThe capacitance of a single lamella per unit length of the axon, $c_{\\text{single}}$, is the specific capacitance multiplied by the area per unit length:\n$$c_{\\text{single}} = C_{\\text{s,single}} \\cdot (2 \\pi a) = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d}$$\nThe problem states that the $n$ myelin lamellae are arranged in series. For $n$ identical capacitors $C_1$ connected in series, the total equivalent capacitance $C_{\\text{total}}$ is given by the relation:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{C_i} = \\frac{n}{C_1}$$\nThus, $C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 / n$.\nApplying this to the capacitance per unit length, the total membrane capacitance per unit length for $n$ lamellae, $c_{m}(n)$, is:\n$$c_{m}(n) = \\frac{c_{\\text{single}}}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d} \\right)$$\n$$c_{m}(n) = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{nd}$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the ratio $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)/\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)$.\nThe complex propagation constant $\\gamma(\\omega)$ for a passive transmission line is given by $\\gamma = \\sqrt{ZY}$, where $Z$ is the series impedance per unit length and $Y$ is the shunt admittance per unit length.\n\nFor the axon model:\n- The series impedance per unit length is purely resistive due to the axoplasm, as inductance is stated to be lossless (zero). So, $Z = r_{\\mathrm{ax}}$. Note that $r_{\\mathrm{ax}} = \\rho_i / (\\pi a^2)$, but we only need the symbol $r_{\\mathrm{ax}}$.\n- The shunt admittance per unit length, $Y_m$, corresponds to the membrane. It is modeled as a conductor (representing leak channels) in parallel with a capacitor (representing the dielectric lipid bilayer). The admittance of a parallel resistor-capacitor circuit is $Y = G + i\\omega C$.\n\nThe membrane conductance per unit length, $g_m(n)$, is derived from the specific conductance. The specific conductance of a single bilayer is $g_s$. For $n$ resistive layers in series, the resistances add, so the total specific resistance is $n \\cdot (1/g_s)$. The effective specific conductance is the reciprocal: $g_{s,\\text{eff}} = 1/(n/g_s) = g_s/n$. The total conductance per unit length is then:\n$$g_{m}(n) = g_{s,\\text{eff}} \\cdot (2 \\pi a) = \\frac{2 \\pi a g_s}{n}$$\nUsing the result from Part 1 for $c_m(n)$, the shunt admittance per unit length is:\n$$Y_m(n, \\omega) = g_{m}(n) + i\\omega c_{m}(n) = \\frac{2 \\pi a g_s}{n} + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{nd}$$\nNow, we write the propagation constant as a function of $n$:\n$$\\gamma_{n}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{ax}} Y_m(n, \\omega)} = \\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi a g_s}{n} + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{nd} \\right)}$$\nWe can factor out the dependence on $n$:\n$$\\gamma_{n}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\left[ r_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\left( 2 \\pi a g_s + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d} \\right) \\right]}$$\nLet the term in the square brackets, which is independent of $n$, be denoted by $K(\\omega)$:\n$$K(\\omega) = r_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\left( 2 \\pi a g_s + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d} \\right)$$\nThen, the propagation constant has the form:\n$$\\gamma_{n}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\frac{K(\\omega)}{n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)/\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)$. We can write the expression for $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)$ by replacing $n$ with $2n$:\n$$\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{2n}}$$\nThe ratio is then:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)}{\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{2n}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{n}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{2n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nRationalizing the denominator gives the final simplified form:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)}{\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\nThis expression is independent of $\\omega$, as required. This completes the second part of the derivation.\n\nThe final answer consists of the two derived quantities: $c_m(n)$ and the ratio $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)/\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}}{nd} & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2713513"}, {"introduction": "Beyond providing electrical insulation, glial cells play indispensable roles in regulating the chemical microenvironment of the brain.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the fold-change in tonic GABAergic current following the deletion of astrocytic GABA transporter $3$ (GAT3). This is a multi-step calculation involving finding the steady-state extracellular GABA concentration, $[G]$, under two conditions: baseline (with GAT1 and GAT3) and after GAT3 deletion (with only GAT1).\n\nFirst, we determine the baseline steady-state GABA concentration, which we will denote $[G]_{\\text{base}}$. At steady state, the rate of GABA production (spillover source, $R_s$) is equal to the total rate of removal by uptake transporters.\nThe total uptake rate is the sum of the rates of GAT1 ($v_1$) and GAT3 ($v_3$), each described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\nThe governing equation is:\n$$ R_s = v_1 + v_3 = \\frac{V_{\\max,1}\\,[G]_{\\text{base}}}{K_{m,1} + [G]_{\\text{base}}} + \\frac{V_{\\max,3}\\,[G]_{\\text{base}}}{K_{m,3} + [G]_{\\text{base}}} $$\nWe are given the following parameters: $R_s = 0.3\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $V_{\\max,1} = 1.5\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $K_{m,1} = 12\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, $V_{\\max,3} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $K_{m,3} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.

The specific terms are mechanistically motivated by established concepts in neuroscience, such as toxin-induced apoptosis, density-limited proliferation and differentiation, and feedback from tissue damage (demyelination) to progenitor cell recruitment. The model is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The system is a set of coupled, non-linear ODEs. The right-hand side functions are continuous and piecewise differentiable, ensuring they are locally Lipschitz. By the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, for any given set of initial conditions, a unique solution exists in a neighborhood of $t=0$. The problem asks for a numerical solution over a finite interval $[0, T_{\\mathrm{end}}]$, which is a well-posed computational problem.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and objective, quantifiable parameters. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary parameters, initial conditions, and definitions are provided for each test case. The problem setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The definition of the initial state and reference myelin level is consistent with a pre-exposure steady state for myelin.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined task in computational biology that requires the numerical solution of an initial value problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the numerical integration of a system of three coupled ordinary differential equations that model oligodendrocyte and myelin dynamics. Let the state vector be $Y(t) = [O(t), P(t), M(t)]^T$. The system is described by $\\dfrac{dY}{dt} = F(t, Y)$, where:\n\n$$\nF(t, Y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\dfrac{dO}{dt} \\\\\n\\dfrac{dP}{dt} \\\\\n\\dfrac{dM}{dt}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nk_d(t)\\, P(t)\\,\\left(1 - \\frac{O(t)}{O_{\\max}}\\right) - k_a(t)\\, O(t) \\\\\nr_p^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)\\, P(t)\\,\\left(1 - \\frac{P(t)}{K_p}\\right) - k_d(t)\\, P(t) \\\\\n\\alpha \\, O(t) - \\beta \\, M(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe coefficients $k_a(t)$, $k_d(t)$, and $r_p^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$ are defined as:\n-   $k_a(t) = \\begin{cases} k_{a,\\mathrm{high}} & \\text{if } t < t_w \\\\ k_{a,\\mathrm{low}} & \\text{if } t \\ge t_w \\end{cases}$\n-   $k_d(t) = \\begin{cases} \\gamma \\, k_d & \\text{if } t < t_w \\\\ k_d & \\text{if } t \\ge t_w \\end{cases}$\n-   $r_p^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = r_{p,0} + c \\cdot \\max\\left(0, 1 - \\frac{M(t)}{M_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)$\n\nThe system is an initial value problem (IVP) with initial conditions at $t=0$:\n-   $O(0) = O_0$\n-   $P(0) = P_0$\n-   $M(0) = M_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\, O_0}{\\beta}$\n\nTo solve this problem, we will implement a numerical procedure for each test case:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** For a given test case, all parameters ($O_0, P_0, O_{\\max}, K_p, k_{a,\\mathrm{low}}, k_{a,\\mathrm{high}}, r_{p,0}, c, k_d, \\gamma, \\alpha, \\beta, t_w, T_{\\mathrm{end}}$) are defined. The initial state vector $Y_0 = [O_0, P_0, M_{\\mathrm{ref}}]$ is constructed.\n\n2.  **Numerical Integration:** The system of ODEs is solved numerically over the time interval $[0, T_{\\mathrm{end}}]$. A suitable method is a variable-step Runge-Kutta algorithm, which is robust for such non-stiff problems. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library provides such an implementation (typically the 'RK45' method). We will evaluate the solution on a fine time grid (e.g., with a step size of $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{eval}}=0.1$ days) to accurately determine the timing of events.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Results:** After obtaining the solution trajectories $O(t)$, $P(t)$, and $M(t)$, we must find the time-to-$90\\%$ remyelination. This is defined as the smallest time $\\Delta t \\ge 0$ such that $M(t_w + \\Delta t) \\ge 0.9 \\, M_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n    -   First, we determine the target myelin level, $M_{\\mathrm{target}} = 0.9 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n    -   Next, we search the numerical solution for the first time point $t^* \\ge t_w$ at which $M(t^*) \\ge M_{\\mathrm{target}}$. The search begins from the time of cuprizone withdrawal, $t_w$.\n    -   If such a time $t^*$ is found, the result is computed as $\\Delta t = t^* - t_w$.\n    -   If the condition $M(t) \\ge M_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is not met for any $t \\in [t_w, T_{\\mathrm{end}}]$, the remyelination is considered incomplete within the simulation period, and the result is defined as $-1.0$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented in a Python program that iterates through the four specified test cases, calculates the result for each, and formats the output as required. The piecewise nature of the parameters $k_a(t)$ and $k_d(t)$ is handled within the function defining the ODE system by checking the value of the current time $t$ against the withdrawal time $t_w$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: happy path\n        {\n            \"O0\": 80000, \"P0\": 5000, \"O_max\": 100000, \"K_p\": 30000,\n            \"k_a_low\": 0.005, \"k_a_high\": 0.08, \"r_p0\": 0.05, \"c\": 0.3,\n            \"k_d_base\": 0.04, \"gamma\": 0.2, \"alpha\": 0.001, \"beta\": 0.1,\n            \"t_w\": 42, \"T_end\": 240\n        },\n        # Case B: no exposure\n        {\n            \"O0\": 80000, \"P0\": 5000, \"O_max\": 100000, \"K_p\": 30000,\n            \"k_a_low\": 0.005, \"k_a_high\": 0.08, \"r_p0\": 0.05, \"c\": 0.3,\n            \"k_d_base\": 0.04, \"gamma\": 0.2, \"alpha\": 0.001, \"beta\": 0.1,\n            \"t_w\": 0, \"T_end\": 240\n        },\n        # Case C: severe toxicity, likely incomplete recovery\n        {\n            \"O0\": 80000, \"P0\": 5000, \"O_max\": 100000, \"K_p\": 30000,\n            \"k_a_low\": 0.005, \"k_a_high\": 0.20, \"r_p0\": 0.05, \"c\": 0.3,\n            \"k_d_base\": 0.02, \"gamma\": 0.2, \"alpha\": 0.001, \"beta\": 0.1,\n            \"t_w\": 56, \"T_end\": 365\n        },\n        # Case D: complete differentiation suppression\n        {\n            \"O0\": 80000, \"P0\": 5000, \"O_max\": 100000, \"K_p\": 30000,\n            \"k_a_low\": 0.005, \"k_a_high\": 0.12, \"r_p0\": 0.05, \"c\": 0.3,\n            \"k_d_base\": 0.03, \"gamma\": 0.0, \"alpha\": 0.001, \"beta\": 0.1,\n            \"t_w\": 21, \"T_end\": 240\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        result = _solve_single_case(params)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef _solve_single_case(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ODE system for a single set of parameters and computes\n    the time to 90% remyelination.\n    \"\"\"\n    O0 = params[\"O0\"]\n    P0 = params[\"P0\"]\n    O_max = params[\"O_max\"]\n    K_p = params[\"K_p\"]\n    k_a_low = params[\"k_a_low\"]\n    k_a_high = params[\"k_a_high\"]\n    r_p0 = params[\"r_p0\"]\n    c = params[\"c\"]\n    k_d_base = params[\"k_d_base\"]\n    gamma = params[\"gamma\"]\n    alpha = params[\"alpha\"]\n    beta = params[\"beta\"]\n    t_w = params[\"t_w\"]\n    T_end = params[\"T_end\"]\n\n    # Calculate reference myelin level\n    M_ref = alpha * O0 / beta\n    \n    # Initial conditions vector\n    y0 = [O0, P0, M_ref]\n\n    # Define the ODE system\n    def ode_system(t, y):\n        O, P, M = y\n        \n        # Determine piecewise parameters based on time t vs withdrawal time t_w\n        if t < t_w:\n            k_a = k_a_high\n            k_d = gamma * k_d_base\n        else:\n            k_a = k_a_low\n            k_d = k_d_base\n            \n        # Effective OPC proliferation rate with feedback from demyelination\n        r_p_eff = r_p0 + c * max(0, 1 - M / M_ref)\n        \n        # Derivatives for O(t), P(t), M(t)\n        dO_dt = k_d * P * (1 - O / O_max) - k_a * O\n        dP_dt = r_p_eff * P * (1 - P / K_p) - k_d * P\n        dM_dt = alpha * O - beta * M\n        \n        return [dO_dt, dP_dt, dM_dt]\n\n    # Time span for integration and points for evaluation\n    t_span = [0, T_end]\n    # Use a small time step for accurate detection of the remyelination time\n    t_eval = np.arange(0, T_end + 0.1, 0.1)\n\n    # Solve the ODE using a Runge-Kutta method\n    sol = solve_ivp(ode_system, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, method='RK45', dense_output=True)\n\n    # Task: Find the time to 90% remyelination after withdrawal\n    myelin_target = 0.9 * M_ref\n    \n    # Find the index in the solution time array corresponding to t_w\n    start_index = np.searchsorted(sol.t, t_w, side='left')\n    \n    time_to_remyelination_delta = -1.0\n    \n    # Search for the first time point >= t_w where myelin exceeds the target\n    for i in range(start_index, len(sol.t)):\n        if sol.y[2, i] >= myelin_target:\n            t_remyelination = sol.t[i]\n            time_to_remyelination_delta = t_remyelination - t_w\n            break\n            \n    return round(time_to_remyelination_delta, 4)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2713558"}]}
