The problem statement provides that the membrane potential, $V_{m}$, is dominated by inwardly rectifying potassium channels ($K_{ir}$) and is therefore set by the electrochemical equilibrium for potassium ions ($K^{+}$). This is a foundational concept in cellular electrophysiology.\n\nThe first principle governing the equilibrium potential of an ion species across a permeable membrane is the Nernst equation. For potassium ions, the Nernst potential, $V_{K}$, is given by:\n$$V_{K} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $[K^{+}]_{o}$ is the extracellular potassium concentration, and $[K^{+}]_{i}$ is the intracellular potassium concentration.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, we can equate the membrane potential $V_{m}$ with the Nernst potential for potassium, so $V_{m} = V_{K}$.\n\nWe are given the initial and final conditions for the extracellular potassium concentration.\nThe initial membrane potential, $V_{m}^{\\text{initial}}$, corresponds to the initial extracellular potassium concentration, $[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{initial}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$V_{m}^{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{initial}}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right)$$\nThe final membrane potential, $V_{m}^{\\text{final}}$, corresponds to the final extracellular potassium concentration, $[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{final}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$V_{m}^{\\text{final}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{final}}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right)$$\n\nThe required quantity is the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_{m}$, defined as $\\Delta V_{m} = V_{m}^{\\text{final}} - V_{m}^{\\text{initial}}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the initial and final potentials:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = \\left(\\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{final}}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{initial}}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right)\\right)$$\nWe can factor out the constant term $\\frac{RT}{zF}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{final}}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}^{\\text{initial}}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right) \\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, the expression simplifies considerably.

It is crucial to distinguish this from the change in the cell's membrane potential ($V_m$). In the vascular smooth muscle cells of arterioles, this rise in extracellular potassium increases the conductance of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. This pulls the cell's $V_m$ (resting around -40 mV) towards the new $E_K$, resulting in a net hyperpolarization that causes vasodilation.
