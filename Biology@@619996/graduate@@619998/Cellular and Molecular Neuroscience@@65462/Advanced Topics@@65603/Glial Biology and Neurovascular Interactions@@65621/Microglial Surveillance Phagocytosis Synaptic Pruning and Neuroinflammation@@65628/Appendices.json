It presents a standard biophysical model of receptor-ligand interaction, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique and meaningful solution. The values for ligand concentration and the dissociation constant are biologically plausible for the CX3CR1-CX3CL1 system. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: first, the fractional occupancy of the CX3CR1 receptor at a specific fractalkine concentration, and second, the fold-change in signaling when this concentration is doubled.\n\nLet us begin by establishing the fundamental principles. The interaction between a single-site receptor, $R$, and its ligand, $L$, to form a receptor-ligand complex, $RL$, is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nUnder the assumption of rapid reversible binding, this system reaches equilibrium, which is characterized by the law of mass action. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the rate of dissociation to the rate of association, and at equilibrium, it is given by the ratio of concentrations:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $R_T$, is conserved. It is the sum of the free receptors and the ligand-bound receptors:\n$$ [R_T] = [R] + [RL] $$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptors that are bound to a ligand:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of the ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nWe substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]} $$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of bound complex ($[RL] \\neq 0$), we can divide the numerator and denominator by $[RL]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ yields the standard form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for monovalent binding (Hill coefficient of 1):\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis equation provides the fractional occupancy as a function of free ligand concentration.

First, let us rearrange the term inside the square:\n$$ E_{\\text{obs}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g) - p(E_{\\text{MG}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g)) $$\nLet $Y_g = E_{\\text{obs}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g)$ and $X_g = E_{\\text{MG}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g)$. The problem simplifies to minimizing $S(p) = \\sum_{g=1}^{N} (Y_g - p X_g)^2$. This is a linear regression through the origin. The derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dp} = \\sum_{g=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{dp} (Y_g - p X_g)^2 = \\sum_{g=1}^{N} 2(Y_g - p X_g)(-X_g) = -2 \\sum_{g=1}^{N} (Y_g X_g - p X_g^2) $$\nSetting $\\frac{dS}{dp} = 0$:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{N} Y_g X_g - \\hat{p} \\sum_{g=1}^{N} X_g^2 = 0 $$\nThe least-squares estimator for $p$ is therefore:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=1}^{N} Y_g X_g}{\\sum_{g=1}^{N} X_g^2} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=1}^{N} (E_{\\text{obs}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g))(E_{\\text{MG}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g))}{\\sum_{g=1}^{N} (E_{\\text{MG}}(g) - E_{\\text{MAC}}(g))^2} $$\nWe now compute the necessary terms:\n\n| Gene    | $E_{\\text{MG}}(g)$ | $E_{\\text{MAC}}(g)$ | $E_{\\text{obs}}(g)$ | $X_g = E_{\\text{MG}} - E_{\\text{MAC}}$ | $Y_g = E_{\\text{obs}} - E_{\\text{MAC}}$ | $X_g^2$       | $Y_g X_g$        |\n|---------|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|\n| Tmem119 | $50$              | $0.1$              | $37.525$           | $49.9$                               | $37.425$                             | $2490.01$     | $1867.5075$      |\n| P2ry12  | $40$              | $0.1$              | $30.025$           | $39.9$                               | $29.925$                             | $1592.01$     | $1194.0075$      |\n| Sall1   | $20$              | $0.2$              | $15.05$            | $19.8$                               | $14.85$                              | $392.04$      | $294.03$         |\n| Ccr2    | $0.5$             | $30$               | $7.875$            | $-29.5$                              | $-22.125$                            | $870.25$      | $652.6875$       |\n| Ly6c2   | $0.2$             | $25$               | $6.4$              | $-24.8$                              | $-18.6$                              | $615.04$      | $461.28$         |\n| Ms4a7   | $1$               | $15$               | $4.5$              | $-14.0$                              | $-10.5$                              | $196.00$      | $147.00$         |\n| **Sum** | -                 | -                  | -                  | -                                    | -                                    | $\\mathbf{6155.35}$ | $\\mathbf{4616.5125}$ |\n\nSubstituting the summed values into the estimator for $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{4616.5125}{6155.35} = 0.75 $$\nThe estimate $\\hat{p} = 0.75$ lies within the required interval $[0,1]$.

Verify with orthogonal measurements (for example, flow cytometry for CD45-high CCR2-positive cells).**\n- The estimate of $\\hat{p} \\approx 0.75$ is correct based on our calculation.\n- The proposed strategy is scientifically and methodologically impeccable. It describes the gold standard for computational deconvolution:\n  - Using a comprehensive signature matrix that accounts for multiple cell states (homeostatic, activated) is a critical refinement over a simple two-cell-type model.\n  - Relying on matched single-cell data to build this matrix is best practice.\n  - The suggestions for cross-species work (ortholog mapping), statistical robustness checks (bootstrapping), and cross-dataset validation are hallmarks of a rigorous analysis.\n  - The two proposed methods for downstream correction are both valid and widely used. The first, mathematical \"purification\" of the expression profile, is a direct approach. The second, including the contamination fraction as a covariate in differential expression models (e.g., in DESeq2, edgeR), is a statistically robust method to account for confounding, correctly identified as \"more conservative.\"\n  - Crucially, it advocates for orthogonal validation with an independent experimental method (flow cytometry), which is essential for confirming computational predictions in biological research.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\hat p \\approx 0.25$. Discard any sample with detectable macrophage marker reads; no computational correction should be attempted because deconvolution is unreliable in immune tissues.**\n- The estimate of $\\hat{p} \\approx 0.25$ is incorrect.\n- The proposed strategy is unscientific and naive. Contamination is a common problem, and discarding valuable data is not a solution, but an evasion. The claim that \"deconvolution is unreliable in immune tissues\" is an overstatement that dismisses a vast and productive subfield of bioinformatics. While challenges exist due to cellular plasticity, an array of methods have been developed to address them. To abandon any attempt at correction is poor science.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\hat p \\approx 0.50$. Deconvolve using only pan-myeloid markers such as Itgam (CD11b) and Aif1 (Iba1) by simple expression ratio, then scale all gene counts by this ratio to “remove” macrophages.**\n- The estimate of $\\hat{p} \\approx 0.50$ is incorrect.\n- The proposed strategy is fundamentally flawed. Pan-myeloid markers are, by definition, expressed on multiple myeloid cell types, including both microglia and macrophages. Using such non-specific markers makes it impossible to distinguish between the two populations. A ratio of these markers would be meaningless for quantifying the proportion of microglia versus macrophages. Scaling the entire dataset by such an arbitrary factor would corrupt the data rather than correct it.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\hat p \\approx 0.90$. Apply marker sets derived from human peripheral monocytes directly to mouse data without ortholog mapping or cross-species validation, assuming marker expression is invariant across species and activation states.**\n- The estimate of $\\hat{p} \\approx 0.90$ is incorrect.\n- The proposed strategy represents gross methodological negligence. The assumption that marker gene expression is conserved across species (human vs. mouse) and cell states is demonstrably false. Significant expression divergence exists even between closely related species. Applying human markers to mouse data without proper ortholog mapping and cross-species validation is guaranteed to produce erroneous results.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $\\hat p \\approx 0.75$. Fit a deconvolution but then regress out all immune-related genes from the bulk data to guarantee removal of the macrophage signal, ensuring that downstream microglial activation signatures are not confounded by inflammation.**\n- The estimate of $\\hat{p} \\approx 0.75$ is correct.\n- However, the proposed correction strategy is profoundly misguided and demonstrates a severe misunderstanding of the underlying biology. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Their activation *is* an immune response central to neuroinflammation. Regressing out \"all immune-related genes\" would remove not only the macrophage contaminant signal but also the primary biological signal of interest—the microglial response itself. This would make it impossible to study microglial activation, defeating the entire purpose of the experiment.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the calculation and the systematic evaluation of strategies, option A is the only one that is both numerically correct and methodologically sound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2725703"}]}
