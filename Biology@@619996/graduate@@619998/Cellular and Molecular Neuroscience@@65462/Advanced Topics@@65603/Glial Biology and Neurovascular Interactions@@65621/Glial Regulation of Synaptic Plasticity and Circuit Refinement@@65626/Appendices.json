Consider a synapse where astrocytic activity modulates extracellular D-serine concentration from a baseline of $100$ nM to a transient peak of $1$ $\\mu$M in response to neuronal activity. Assume the co-agonist site on the NMDAR has an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d = 200$ nM for D-serine and that binding is noncooperative with a single site (Hill coefficient $n=1$). Glutamate is present at saturating levels during synaptic transmission, the membrane potential and extracellular magnesium are unchanged between conditions, and channel conductance per open receptor is constant.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action for ligand-receptor binding at equilibrium and the definition of the dissociation constant, derive the fractional occupancy of the co-agonist site as a function of ligand concentration for $n=1$. Then, using this result, compute the fractional occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist site at $100$ nM and at $1$ $\\mu$M D-serine. Finally, under the stated assumptions, predict the fold-change in the macroscopic NMDAR-mediated current amplitude between these two D-serine concentrations, taking current to be proportional to the probability that the co-agonist site is occupied.\n\nExpress the two fractional occupancies and the fold-change as exact simplified fractions with no rounding.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of receptor pharmacology and neurophysiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of the NMDAR co-agonist site as a function of the ligand concentration, $[L]$, for a simple, non-cooperative binding process. The binding of a ligand $L$ to a receptor $R$ to form a complex $RL$ is represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand (D-serine), and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of the total receptor population, $[R]_{total}$, that is bound by the ligand. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors: $[R]_{total} = [R] + [RL]$. Thus, fractional occupancy is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the $K_d$ equation to solve for $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}$$\nBy factoring out $[RL]$ from the denominator, we get:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)}$$\nThe term $[RL]$ cancels, leaving the general expression for fractional occupancy for a single binding site (corresponding to a Hill coefficient of $n=1$):\n$$\\theta([L]) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the fractional occupancy at the two specified D-serine concentrations.

It describes a standard electrophysiological experiment in neuroscience and provides sufficient data to permit a logical deduction. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires an inference about the locus of synaptic modulation based on several key observations following the activation of an astrocyte-specific Gq-DREADD. The analysis will be based on the provided quantal framework of synaptic transmission.\n\nThe core experimental findings are:\n1. The initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) increases by $20\\%$ within $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$. The fEPSP slope is taken as a measure of the mean synaptic response amplitude.\n2. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) at a $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ interpulse interval remains unchanged.\n3. The fiber volley amplitude remains unchanged, indicating that the presynaptic afferent volley is constant.\n\nThe theoretical framework provided is:\n1. Mean synaptic response amplitude (fEPSP slope) is proportional to the product of $N$, $p$, and $q$, where $N$ is the number of functional release sites, $p$ is the presynaptic release probability, and $q$ is the postsynaptic quantal amplitude. We can write this as $\\text{fEPSP} \\propto N \\cdot p \\cdot q$.\n2. The PPR is inversely related to the presynaptic release probability, $p$. We can write this as $\\text{PPR} \\propto 1/p$. This relationship arises because a higher initial release probability ($p_1$) leads to greater depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, reducing the number of vesicles available for release by the second pulse, thus decreasing the amplitude of the second response relative to the first.\n\nWe can now synthesize these points. The observation that the PPR is unchanged implies that the presynaptic release probability $p$ must also be unchanged. If $p$ were to increase, PPR would decrease. If $p$ were to decrease, PPR would increase. Since PPR is constant, we must conclude that $\\Delta p \\approx 0$.\n\nThe fEPSP slope, however, has increased. Given the relationship $\\text{fEPSP} \\propto N \\cdot p \\cdot q$, and our deduction that $p$ is constant, the increase in the fEPSP must be attributed to an increase in either $N$, $q$, or both.\n$$ \\Delta(\\text{fEPSP}) > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta p \\approx 0 \\implies \\Delta(N \\cdot q) > 0 $$\nThis narrows the possible locus of modulation to a change in the number of release sites ($N$, a presynaptic structural change) or a change in the postsynaptic response to a quantum of neurotransmitter ($q$, a postsynaptic functional change).\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the provided options against this deduction and known biological principles.\n\n**Option A. Predominantly presynaptic modulation: astrocyte-released adenosine acts at presynaptic A$_{2A}$ receptors to increase release probability $p$, thereby increasing the fEPSP slope.**\nThis option proposes an increase in $p$. An increase in $p$ would cause a decrease in PPR. This directly contradicts the experimental observation that the PPR is unchanged. Therefore, this mechanism is inconsistent with the provided data.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B. Predominantly postsynaptic modulation: astrocyte-released D-serine increases occupancy of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist site, enhancing postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling that increases $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) phosphorylation and surface insertion, thereby increasing quantal amplitude $q$ without altering $p$.**\nThis option proposes a postsynaptic mechanism. Activation of Gq-coupled receptors in astrocytes elevates intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which can trigger the release of gliotransmitters such as D-serine. D-serine acts as a co-agonist at the glycine-binding site of NMDARs. Enhanced NMDAR activation leads to increased postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx, which can activate downstream signaling cascades like CaMKII. This is a canonical pathway for the potentiation of AMPARs, either through phosphorylation (increasing their conductance) or insertion into the postsynaptic membrane. Both effects would lead to an increase in the postsynaptic response to a single vesicle of glutamate, which is precisely what an increase in quantal amplitude $q$ represents. A change in $q$ is a purely postsynaptic modification and does not directly affect presynaptic release probability $p$. Therefore, this mechanism explains the increase in fEPSP slope ($\\uparrow q$) while being consistent with the unchanged PPR ($\\Delta p \\approx 0$). The timescale of $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$ is also appropriate for these signaling and trafficking events.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C. Predominantly presynaptic structural modulation: astrocyte-secreted thrombospondins rapidly increase the number of presynaptic active zones $N$ within $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$, increasing the fEPSP slope while leaving PPR unchanged.**\nThis option proposes an increase in $N$, the number of release sites. An increase in $N$ would indeed increase the fEPSP slope without necessarily changing $p$ at individual sites, and thus could be consistent with the unchanged PPR. However, the proposed mechanism is synaptogenesis mediated by thrombospondins. The formation of new, functional synapses is a form of structural plasticity that typically occurs on a timescale of hours to days. It is biologically highly implausible for a $20\\%$ increase in the number of functional synaptic contacts to occur within $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$. This timescale is inconsistent with the known kinetics of synaptogenesis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D. Predominantly presynaptic modulation: astrocyte-released glutamate activates presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor $2/3$ to decrease release probability $p$, which increases synaptic efficacy without changing PPR.**\nThis option contains multiple internal contradictions. Activation of presynaptic mGluR$_{2/3}$ receptors is inhibitory; it *decreases* release probability $p$. A decrease in $p$ would lead to a *decrease* in the fEPSP slope, contradicting the primary observation of a $20\\%$ increase. Furthermore, the claim that this \"increases synaptic efficacy\" is false in this context. Finally, a decrease in $p$ would cause an *increase* in PPR, contradicting the observation that PPR is unchanged. This option is inconsistent with both the data and its own stated mechanism.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only Option B provides a mechanistic explanation that is fully consistent with all experimental data (increased fEPSP, unchanged PPR) and established principles of neurobiology, including the known signaling pathways for astrocyte-neuron communication and the timescale of postsynaptic modifications.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2714287"}, {"introduction": "Beyond releasing signaling molecules, astrocytes play an essential role in sculpting synaptic transmission by clearing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space.
