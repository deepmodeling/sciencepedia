It requires the derivation of an expression for the equilibrium areal density of a receptor dimer based on a set of clearly defined assumptions and starting principles. The derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nLet us define the areal densities of the species involved at equilibrium.\nLet $D$ be the areal density of TrkB dimers, in units of dimers per square micrometer. This is the quantity we must find.\nLet $R_{m}$ be the areal density of free, unoccupied, monomeric TrkB receptors.\nLet $R_{occ}$ be the total areal density of receptors that are occupied by the ligand, BDNF.\n\nThe problem states that the total areal density of TrkB receptors is $R$. Receptors exist in one of two states: as free monomers or as components of dimers. Therefore, the conservation of receptors is expressed as:\n$$R = R_{m} + R_{occ}$$\n\nAssumption (v) is critical: \"every ligand-occupied receptor is incorporated into exactly one dimer, with each dimer comprising exactly two ligand-occupied receptors\". This establishes a direct stoichiometric relationship between the density of occupied receptors and the density of dimers:\n$$R_{occ} = 2 D$$\n\nThe binding of the ligand $L$ to a free monomeric receptor $R_{m}$ to form an occupied receptor $R_{occ}$ is governed by the law of mass action. The dissociation reaction is $R_{occ} \\rightarrow R_{m} + L$. At equilibrium, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{R_{m} \\cdot L}{R_{occ}}$$\nNote that the ligand concentration $L$ is a bulk concentration (molar), while $R_{m}$ and $R_{occ}$ are areal densities (receptors/μm²). This is a standard treatment for ligand-receptor binding at a surface, where $K_d$ has units of bulk concentration, consistent with the problem statement. Assumption (iv) states that $L$ is constant and not depleted by binding.\n\nWe have a system of three algebraic equations and seek to find an expression for $D$ in terms of the given parameters $R$, $L$, and $K_d$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the density of occupied receptors, $R_{occ}$. From the conservation equation, we express the density of free monomers, $R_{m}$, as:\n$$R_{m} = R - R_{occ}$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $R_{m}$ into the equation for the dissociation constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(R - R_{occ}) L}{R_{occ}}$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $R_{occ}$:\n$$K_d R_{occ} = (R - R_{occ}) L$$\n$$K_d R_{occ} = R L - R_{occ} L$$\n$$K_d R_{occ} + R_{occ} L = R L$$\n$$R_{occ} (K_d + L) = R L$$\n\nThis yields the expression for the areal density of occupied receptors:\n$$R_{occ} = \\frac{R L}{K_d + L}$$\nThis expression is a form of the Langmuir isotherm or Michaelis–Menten kinetics, describing the fraction of total receptors that are occupied at a given ligand concentration. The fraction of occupied receptors is $\\frac{L}{K_d+L}$.\n\nFinally, we use the stoichiometric relationship $R_{occ} = 2D$ to find the areal density of dimers, $D$:\n$$2D = \\frac{R L}{K_d + L}$$\n\nSolving for $D$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$D = \\frac{R L}{2(L + K_d)}$$\n\nThis result is physically sensible. When the ligand concentration $L$ approaches zero, the dimer density $D$ also approaches zero. When the ligand concentration is saturating ($L \\gg K_d$), the expression simplifies to $D \\approx \\frac{RL}{2L} = \\frac{R}{2}$.

The condition for half-saturation is given by:\n$$ [R:L] = \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\text{tot}} $$\nThe fraction of bound $R$ receptors is $\\frac{[R:L]}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$. From the problem's provided relations, this fraction is also equal to $\\frac{[L]}{K_{D}^{R} + [L]}$, where $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand at equilibrium. Let us denote the free ligand concentration that achieves half-saturation of $R$ as $[L]_{50}$. Equating the two expressions for the bound fraction at this condition gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[L]_{50}}{K_{D}^{R} + [L]_{50}} $$\nSolving for $[L]_{50}$ yields:\n$$ K_{D}^{R} + [L]_{50} = 2[L]_{50} $$\n$$ [L]_{50} = K_{D}^{R} $$\nThis result shows that the free ligand concentration required to occupy half of the $R$ receptors is equal to the dissociation constant of that receptor, $K_{D}^{R}$, regardless of the presence of other receptors or ligand depletion.\n\nThe apparent $EC_{50}$, denoted $[L]_{\\text{tot},50}$, is the total ligand concentration required to establish this free ligand concentration of $[L]_{50}$. We use the law of ligand conservation:\n$$ [L]_{\\text{tot}} = [L] + [R:L] + [D:L] $$\nAt the specific condition for $EC_{50}$, this equation becomes:\n$$ [L]_{\\text{tot},50} = [L]_{50} + [R:L]_{50} + [D:L]_{50} $$\nWe have established that $[L]_{50} = K_{D}^{R}$ and the condition itself states $[R:L]_{50} = \\frac{1}{2}R_{\\text{tot}}$. The concentration of ligand bound to the truncated receptor, $[D:L]_{50}$, is determined by the free ligand concentration $[L]_{50}$ and the total concentration of $D$, $D_{\\text{tot}}$. Using the binding relation for receptor $D$:\n$$ [D:L]_{50} = D_{\\text{tot}} \\cdot \\frac{[L]_{50}}{K_{D}^{D} + [L]_{50}} $$\nSubstituting $[L]_{50} = K_{D}^{R}$:\n$$ [D:L]_{50} = D_{\\text{tot}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{D}^{R}}{K_{D}^{D} + K_{D}^{R}} $$\nNow, we substitute all component terms back into the conservation equation for $[L]_{\\text{tot},50}$:\n$$ [L]_{\\text{tot},50} = K_{D}^{R} + \\frac{1}{2}R_{\\text{tot}} + D_{\\text{tot}} \\left( \\frac{K_{D}^{R}}{K_{D}^{D} + K_{D}^{R}} \\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the apparent $EC_{50}$.

The derivative at $A=0$ is $\\frac{d(\\Delta W)}{dA}\\bigg|_{A=0} = -\\frac{10}{3} < 0$.

This behavior is non-monotonic. The initial decrease signifies that LTD strengthens before the system switches to LTP. This is due to the different scaling of proBDNF (linear with $A$ at low $A$) and mature BDNF (quadratic with $A$ at low $A$), combined with the higher affinity of proBDNF for its receptor ($K_P=0.3$ nM vs $K_T=2.0$ nM).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta W(A)$ increases monotonically with $A$, transitioning smoothly from LTD at low $A$ to LTP at high $A$ without any initial deepening of LTD.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The analysis showed that the derivative of $\\Delta W(A)$ at $A=0$ is negative ($-\\frac{10}{3}$). This proves the function is not monotonic; it initially decreases, meaning LTD deepens before the transition to LTP.\n\n**B. $\\Delta W(A)$ is non-monotonic: as $A$ increases from low to moderate values, LTD initially strengthens (more negative $\\Delta W$) due to proBDNF–p$75$NTR signaling, but at higher $A$ proteolysis shifts the balance toward mature BDNF–TrkB signaling, causing $\\Delta W$ to rebound and cross into LTP.**\nThis is **Correct**. This description perfectly matches the derived mathematical behavior. For low $A$, the proBDNF-p$75$NTR pathway dominates, causing $\\Delta W$ to become more negative. As $A$ increases, the activity-dependent proteolysis and quadratic scaling of mature BDNF concentration cause the TrkB pathway to dominate, leading to a rebound of $\\Delta W$ into the positive (LTP) range.\n\n**C. $\\Delta W(A)$ decreases monotonically with $A$, yielding progressively stronger LTD and no LTP even at high $A$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The analysis showed that $\\Delta W(A)$ approaches a positive limit as $A \\to \\infty$, indicating a transition to LTP. Therefore, the function does not decrease monotonically.\n\n**D. $\\Delta W(A)$ is U-shaped with LTP at both low and high $A$ and LTD only at intermediate $A$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The analysis for small $A>0$ shows that $\\Delta W(A)$ is negative. There is no LTP at low activity levels; there is LTD. The function starts at $0$, dips to negative, then rises to positive, which is not a \"U-shape\" with LTP at both ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2735243"}]}
