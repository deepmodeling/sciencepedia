The construct retains the native signal peptide, a single-pass transmembrane segment, and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of neuroligin-$2$. You express this chimera on the surface of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in dissociated culture containing both glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic axons and then assay for synaptogenesis by quantifying gephyrin clusters (an inhibitory scaffold), Postsynaptic Density Protein $95$ (PSD-$95$) clusters (an excitatory scaffold), and recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs).\n\nUsing the following fundamental bases and core definitions only, reason to a prediction of the chimeraâ€™s synaptogenic bias:\n\n- Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: a designed open reading frame encoding an N-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail will be translated, inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, trafficked via the secretory pathway, and displayed at the plasma membrane with the ectodomain extracellular and the cytoplasmic tail intracellular.\n\n- Cell adhesion logic: trans-synaptic adhesion between presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins is mediated by the neuroligin ectodomain, which determines binding to neurexins and can initiate presynaptic differentiation.\n\n- Scaffold recruitment logic: the cytoplasmic tail of neuroligin-$1$ preferentially couples to excitatory postsynaptic scaffolds such as PSD-$95$ to assemble glutamatergic postsynaptic densities, whereas the cytoplasmic tail of neuroligin-$2$ preferentially couples to inhibitory scaffolds such as gephyrin via adaptors (for example, collybistin and membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-$2$) to assemble GABAergic postsynaptic specializations and cluster GABA type A (GABA$_{\\mathrm{A}}$) receptors.\n\nWhich outcome is the most plausible in hippocampal pyramidal neurons expressing the chimera?\n\nA.

The NLGN1 ectodomain specifically binds presynaptic neurexins.\n    *   **Scaffold Recruitment Logic**: The NLGN1 cytoplasmic tail preferentially recruits excitatory scaffolds (e.g., PSD-95). The NLGN2 cytoplasmic tail preferentially recruits inhibitory scaffolds (e.g., gephyrin) to assemble GABAergic postsynaptic specializations and cluster GABA type A (GABA$_{\\mathrm{A}}$) receptors.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement describes a classic domain-swap experiment in molecular neuroscience.\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on well-established principles of synapse formation, including the roles of neuroligins, neurexins, and key scaffolding proteins (PSD-95, gephyrin). The described experimental approach is standard methodology in the field. The premises are scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. It provides a specific molecular construct, an experimental system, a set of assays, and a set of explicit logical principles to be used for reasoning. The question asks for the most plausible outcome, which allows for a unique solution based on the provided logic.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a well-formed, solvable scientific reasoning problem.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution is derived by applying the provided principles to the specified chimeric protein.\n\n1.  **Protein Synthesis and Topology**: Based on the \"Central Dogma of Molecular Biology\" principle, the engineered chimeric protein will be synthesized and correctly inserted into the postsynaptic membrane of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Its ectodomain, derived from NLGN1, will face the synaptic cleft, while its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, derived from NLGN2, will span the membrane and extend into the neuron's cytoplasm.\n\n2.  **Trans-synaptic Adhesion**: According to the \"Cell Adhesion Logic\", the extracellular domain determines the binding to presynaptic partners. The chimera possesses the NLGN1 ectodomain. This domain binds to presynaptic neurexins, which are present on both glutamatergic and GABAergic axon terminals. Therefore, the chimeric protein will be capable of forming adhesive contacts with both types of presynaptic terminals available in the culture, initiating the first step of synaptogenesis at these locations.\n\n3.  **Postsynaptic Scaffolding**: According to the \"Scaffold Recruitment Logic\", the intracellular cytoplasmic tail determines the identity of the postsynaptic specialization. The chimera possesses the NLGN2 cytoplasmic tail. This principle explicitly states that the NLGN2 tail \"preferentially couples to inhibitory scaffolds such as gephyrin ... to assemble GABAergic postsynaptic specializations\". Consequently, wherever the chimera forms an adhesive contact, its NLGN2 tail will recruit the inhibitory scaffolding machinery. It will not recruit the excitatory scaffold PSD-95.\n\n4.  **Predicted Outcome**: The chimera acts as a molecular device where the extracellular part (NLGN1 ectodomain) establishes a physical link with presynaptic terminals, and the intracellular part (NLGN2 tail) instructs the assembly of an inhibitory postsynaptic density. This will lead to the selective formation and/or stabilization of inhibitory synapses. The functional consequence will be an increase in the number of inhibitory synaptic sites, which is measured by the specified assays.\n    *   **Gephyrin clustering**: Will increase, as gephyrin is the primary scaffold recruited by the NLGN2 tail.\n    *   **mIPSC frequency**: Will increase, reflecting a greater number of functional inhibitory synapses containing GABA$_{\\mathrm{A}}$ receptors, which are clustered by the gephyrin scaffold.\n    *   **PSD-95 clustering**: Will show little or no change, as the NLGN2 tail does not recruit excitatory scaffolds like PSD-95.\n    *   **mEPSC frequency**: Will show little or no change, as the chimera does not promote the formation of excitatory synapses.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The chimera increases inhibitory postsynaptic specializations: gephyrin clustering and mIPSC frequency increase, while PSD-95 clustering and mEPSC frequency show little change; postsynaptic identity follows the neuroligin-2 cytoplasmic tail despite the neuroligin-1 ectodomain.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This statement is in complete agreement with the derived prediction. It correctly identifies that the postsynaptic identity is determined by the cytoplasmic tail (NLGN2), leading to the specific induction of inhibitory specializations (increased gephyrin clusters and mIPSC frequency) without affecting excitatory specializations.\n    *   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n*   **B. The chimera increases excitatory postsynaptic specializations: PSD-95 clustering and mEPSC frequency increase, while gephyrin clustering and mIPSC frequency show little change; postsynaptic identity follows the neuroligin-1 ectodomain despite the neuroligin-2 cytoplasmic tail.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is incorrect. It wrongly attributes the determination of postsynaptic identity to the ectodomain (NLGN1). The provided \"Scaffold Recruitment Logic\" principle explicitly states that the cytoplasmic tail dictates scaffold recruitment. The chimera has the NLGN2 tail, which recruits inhibitory, not excitatory, scaffolds.\n    *   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **C. The chimera fails to induce synaptogenesis because the neuroligin-1 ectodomain and neuroligin-2 cytoplasmic tail are incompatible, disrupting neurexin binding; both gephyrin and PSD-95 clustering decrease, and neither mIPSCs nor mEPSCs increase.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This option proposes a non-functional or dominant-negative outcome. While possible in a real experiment, it contradicts the functional modularity implied by the provided principles. The problem is framed to be solved using the given logic, which suggests that the domains function as described. There is no principle provided to support the hypothesis of incompatibility. Therefore, based on the problem's rules, this outcome is not the most plausible.\n    *   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **D. The chimera non-specifically increases both inhibitory and excitatory synapses equally because neuroligins are pan-synaptogenic; gephyrin and PSD-95 clustering both increase to a similar extent, and both mIPSC and mEPSC frequencies rise comparably.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This option oversimplifies the function of neuroligins and ignores the specificity encoded in their cytoplasmic tails, a key detail provided in the \"Scaffold Recruitment Logic\" principle. The chimera contains only the NLGN2 tail, which is specified to be selective for inhibitory scaffolds. Therefore, a non-specific, pan-synaptogenic effect is contrary to the given principles.\n    *   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2749223"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the logic of molecular interactions, it is crucial to quantify their strength.

We find this minimum by setting the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$ to zero.\n$$ \\frac{dg}{dx} = 0 $$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, where $u(x) = 1 + x^2$ and $v(x) = x - x^2$:\n$$ \\frac{dg}{dx} = \\frac{(u'v - uv')}{v^2} = \\frac{(2x)(x - x^2) - (1 + x^2)(1 - 2x)}{(x - x^2)^2} = 0 $$\nFor the derivative to be zero, the numerator must be zero:\n$$ (2x)(x - x^2) - (1 + x^2)(1 - 2x) = 0 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ (2x^2 - 2x^3) - (1 - 2x + x^2 - 2x^3) = 0 $$\n$$ 2x^2 - 2x^3 - 1 + 2x - x^2 + 2x^3 = 0 $$\nSimplifying the expression yields a quadratic equation for $x$:\n$$ x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 $$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-1$:\n$$ x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\n$$ x = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2} $$\nThe two roots are $x_1 = -1 + \\sqrt{2}$ and $x_2 = -1 - \\sqrt{2}$. The problem domain for the adhesion fraction is $x \\in [0, 1]$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, the first root is $x_1 \\approx 0.414$, which is within the physical domain. The second root $x_2 \\approx -2.414$ is outside the physical domain and is discarded.\nThus, the critical fixed point position $x_c$ where the bifurcation occurs is:\n$$ x_c = \\sqrt{2} - 1 $$\nTo find the critical gain $g_c$ at which this bifurcation occurs, we substitute $x_c$ back into the expression for $g(x)$:\n$$ g_c = g(x_c) = \\frac{1 + x_c^2}{x_c(1 - x_c)} $$\nFirst, we compute the necessary terms:\n$$ x_c^2 = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1^2 = 2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1 = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2} $$\n$$ 1 - x_c = 1 - (\\sqrt{2} - 1) = 2 - \\sqrt{2} $$\nNow substitute these into the expression for $g_c$:\n$$ g_c = \\frac{1 + (3 - 2\\sqrt{2})}{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(2 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(2 - \\sqrt{2})} $$\nFactor out $2$ from the numerator:\n$$ g_c = \\frac{2(2 - \\sqrt{2})}{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(2 - \\sqrt{2})} $$\nCancel the common term $(2 - \\sqrt{2})$ from the numerator and denominator, which is valid since $2 - \\sqrt{2} \\neq 0$:\n$$ g_c = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $(\\sqrt{2} + 1)$:\n$$ g_c = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{2 - 1} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{1} $$\nTherefore, the exact minimal value of the dimensionless feedback gain is:\n$$ g_c = 2\\sqrt{2} + 2 $$\nThis is the critical value of $g$ at which a saddle-node bifurcation occurs, giving rise to two new non-trivial fixed points and enabling bistability in the system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2 + 2\\sqrt{2}}$$", "id": "2749150"}]}
