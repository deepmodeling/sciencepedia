The problem is well-posed; it is a second-order ordinary differential equation with two boundary conditions, which specifies a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The data provided are dimensionally consistent: the ratio $D/k$ has units of $(\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}) / (\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, so its square root will correctly yield a characteristic length in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The numerical values are biologically plausible. The problem is a standard exercise in mathematical biology and is not trivial, ill-posed, or in any way invalid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe process begins with the governing partial differential equation for the concentration $c(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial x^{2}} - k\\,c\n$$\nThe problem states that a time-independent steady state has been reached. In a steady state, all time derivatives are zero. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state concentration profile $c(x)$:\n$$\n0 = D\\,\\frac{d^{2} c}{d x^{2}} - k\\,c\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a standard form for a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} c}{d x^{2}} - \\frac{k}{D}\\,c = 0\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, we examine its characteristic equation, which is obtained by substituting $c(x) = \\exp(rx)$:\n$$\nr^{2} - \\frac{k}{D} = 0\n$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are $r_{1,2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$. The general solution for $c(x)$ is a linear combination of the exponential functions corresponding to these roots:\n$$\nc(x) = A\\,\\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\,x\\right) + B\\,\\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\,x\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the concentration decays to zero far from the source: $\\lim_{x \\to +\\infty} c(x) = 0$.\nThe term $A\\,\\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\,x\\right)$ grows without bound as $x \\to +\\infty$ (since $k > 0$ and $D > 0$). For the limit of $c(x)$ to be zero, the coefficient of this term must be zero. Thus, we must have $A = 0$.\nWith $A=0$, the solution simplifies to:\n$$\nc(x) = B\\,\\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\,x\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is that the concentration is finite near the source, which we have set at $x=0$. At $x=0$, the concentration is $c(0) = B\\,\\exp(0) = B$. If we denote the source concentration as $c_0$, then $B = c_0$. This is a finite value, satisfying the condition. The final form of the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{D/k}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a spatially decaying exponential profile. The characteristic length scale, denoted by $\\lambda$, is the distance over which the concentration decreases by a factor of $e$. In a function of the form $f(x) = f_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, the parameter $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length. By comparing this general form to our derived solution for $c(x)$, we identify the characteristic length scale as:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we compute the numerical value of $\\lambda$ using the provided parameters: $D = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$ and $k = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{10^{-3}}}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\sqrt{5000}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{5000}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 70.710678\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda = 70.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor the final part, we estimate how many average neuroepithelial cell diameters this length corresponds to.

Since $C(t)$ converges to the constant $C^{\\ast}$, the forcing term converges to a constant. Consequently, $G(t)$ converges from any initial condition $G(0) \\ge 0$ to a unique, stable steady state $G^{\\ast}$.\n3.  Similarly, the ODE for $M(t)$, $\\frac{dM}{dt} = - \\gamma_m M + k_m \\frac{G(t)^n}{K_G^n + G(t)^n}$, is a linear ODE in $M$ with a forcing term that converges to a constant as $G(t) \\to G^{\\ast}$. Thus, $M(t)$ converges from any initial condition $M(0) \\ge 0$ to a unique, stable steady state $M^{\\ast}$.\nBecause each component of the cascade robustly converges to a single steady state, the entire system $(C, G, M)$ possesses a unique steady state $(C^{\\ast}, G^{\\ast}, M^{\\ast})$ which is globally attracting for any non-negative initial conditions.\n\n**Monotonicity of $M^{\\ast}(S)$:** To determine if $M^{\\ast}$ is a monotone function of $S$, we must analyze the sign of the derivative $\\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dS}$. Using the chain rule: $\\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dS} = \\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dG^{\\ast}}\\frac{dG^{\\ast}}{dS}$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $G^{\\ast}$ with respect to $S$:\n$$ G^{\\ast}(S) = \\frac{k_g A_{\\max}}{\\gamma_g} \\frac{S}{K_D + S} $$\n$$ \\frac{dG^{\\ast}}{dS} = \\frac{k_g A_{\\max}}{\\gamma_g} \\left[ \\frac{(K_D+S)(1) - S(1)}{(K_D+S)^2} \\right] = \\frac{k_g A_{\\max}}{\\gamma_g} \\frac{K_D}{(K_D+S)^2} $$\nSince all parameters ($k_g, A_{\\max}, \\gamma_g, K_D$) are positive constants, $\\frac{dG^{\\ast}}{dS} > 0$ for all $S \\ge 0$. This means $G^{\\ast}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $S$.\n\nNext, we find the derivative of $M^{\\ast}$ with respect to $G^{\\ast}$:\n$$ M^{\\ast}(G^{\\ast}) = \\frac{k_m}{\\gamma_m} \\frac{(G^{\\ast})^n}{K_G^n + (G^{\\ast})^n} $$\n$$ \\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dG^{\\ast}} = \\frac{k_m}{\\gamma_m} \\left[ \\frac{n(G^{\\ast})^{n-1}(K_G^n + (G^{\\ast})^n) - (G^{\\ast})^n(n(G^{\\ast})^{n-1})}{(K_G^n + (G^{\\ast})^n)^2} \\right] = \\frac{k_m}{\\gamma_m} \\frac{n K_G^n (G^{\\ast})^{n-1}}{(K_G^n + (G^{\\ast})^n)^2} $$\nSince all parameters ($k_m, \\gamma_m, n, K_G$) are positive, and $G^{\\ast} \\ge 0$, we have $\\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dG^{\\ast}} \\ge 0$. The derivative is strictly positive for $G^{\\ast} > 0$ (which corresponds to $S > 0$). This means $M^{\\ast}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $G^{\\ast}$.\n\nBecause $\\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dS} = \\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dG^{\\ast}}\\frac{dG^{\\ast}}{dS}$, and both terms on the right-hand side are positive for $S>0$, it follows that $\\frac{dM^{\\ast}}{dS} > 0$ for $S>0$. Therefore, the steady-state Olig2 mRNA concentration $M^{\\ast}(S)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of the SHH concentration $S$. This aligns with the biological role of SHH as a morphogen, where increasing concentrations elicit stronger downstream responses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.049}$$", "id": "2731901"}]}
