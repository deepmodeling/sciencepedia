It is a formalizable, non-trivial, and consistent problem in applied probability.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of $\\mathbb{E}[N_{t}]$**\n\nLet $N_{t-1}$ be the number of RG progenitors at the beginning of round $t$. Each of these $N_{t-1}$ progenitors will divide once during round $t$. Let us define a random variable $X$ representing the number of RG daughters produced from a single RG progenitor division. The probability distribution of $X$ is given by the problem statement:\n$$\nP(X=2) = p_{rr} \\\\\nP(X=1) = p_{rn} \\\\\nP(X=0) = p_{nn}\n$$\nThe expected number of RG daughters from a single division, which we denote as $\\mu$, is calculated using the definition of expected value:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{k} k \\cdot P(X=k) = (2)(p_{rr}) + (1)(p_{rn}) + (0)(p_{nn}) = 2p_{rr} + p_{rn}\n$$\nThis quantity $\\mu$ is the average number of RG progenitors produced per dividing RG progenitor.\n\nThe total number of RG progenitors after round $t$, denoted $N_{t}$, is the sum of the RG daughters produced by each of the $N_{t-1}$ progenitors that existed at the start of the round. If we label the progenitors at the start of round $t$ from $i=1$ to $N_{t-1}$, and let $X_i$ be the number of RG daughters from progenitor $i$, then:\n$$\nN_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t-1}} X_i\n$$\nThe random variables $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed, each with expectation $\\mu = 2p_{rr} + p_{rn}$. We wish to find $\\mathbb{E}[N_t]$. A crucial point is that the upper limit of the summation, $N_{t-1}$, is itself a random variable for $t>1$. We use the law of total expectation (also known as the tower property): $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[Y|Z]]$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\mathbb{E}\\left[N_t | N_{t-1}\\right] \\right]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the inner expectation, conditioned on the value of $N_{t-1}$. If we know that $N_{t-1}$ takes a specific value, say $n$, then the number of terms in the sum is fixed. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t | N_{t-1}=n] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[X_i]\n$$\nSince each $X_i$ has the same expectation $\\mu$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t | N_{t-1}=n] = n \\cdot \\mu\n$$\nThis holds for any value $n$ that $N_{t-1}$ can take. Therefore, we can write the conditional expectation as a function of the random variable $N_{t-1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t | N_{t-1}] = N_{t-1} \\cdot \\mu = N_{t-1} (2p_{rr} + p_{rn})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{t-1} (2p_{rr} + p_{rn})]\n$$\nSince $(2p_{rr} + p_{rn})$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = (2p_{rr} + p_{rn}) \\mathbb{E}[N_{t-1}]\n$$\nThis is a linear recurrence relation for the expected number of RG progenitors. The solution is a geometric progression. Let $\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = a_t$. Then $a_t = \\mu a_{t-1}$, with the initial condition $a_0 = \\mathbb{E}[N_0]$. Since $N_0$ is a given constant, $\\mathbb{E}[N_0] = N_0$.\nBy iterating the recurrence:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_1] = \\mu \\mathbb{E}[N_0] = \\mu N_0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_2] = \\mu \\mathbb{E}[N_1] = \\mu (\\mu N_0) = \\mu^2 N_0\n$$\nThe general solution for any round $t$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = \\mu^t N_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu$, we arrive at the final analytic expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_{t}] = N_{0}(2p_{rr} + p_{rn})^{t}\n$$\n\n**Mechanistic Interpretation and Parameter Regimes**\n\nThe derived expression $\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = N_0 \\mu^t$ shows that the long-term behavior of the expected RG progenitor pool is determined by the base of the exponent, $\\mu = 2p_{rr} + p_{rn}$. As established, $\\mu$ represents the average number of self-renewing RG daughters produced per mitosis. The fate of the progenitor pool depends on whether this value is greater than, equal to, or less than $1$.\n\n1.  **Expansion ($\\mu > 1$):** If $2p_{rr} + p_{rn} > 1$, each RG progenitor, on average, produces more than one replacement for itself. This leads to exponential growth of the expected progenitor pool size over many rounds ($t \\to \\infty$).\n2.  **Criticality ($\\mu = 1$):** If $2p_{rr} + p_{rn} = 1$, each RG progenitor, on average, exactly replaces itself. The expected progenitor pool size remains constant: $\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = N_0$ for all $t$. The system is in a state of maintenance.\n3.  **Exhaustion ($\\mu < 1$):** If $2p_{rr} + p_{rn} < 1$, each RG progenitor, on average, produces fewer than one replacement for itself. This leads to exponential decay of the expected progenitor pool size, which becomes exhausted as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nTo gain further insight, we can use the constraint $p_{rr} + p_{rn} + p_{nn} = 1$, which implies $p_{rn} = 1 - p_{rr} - p_{nn}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = 2p_{rr} + (1 - p_{rr} - p_{nn}) = 1 + p_{rr} - p_{nn}\n$$\nThe conditions for the three regimes can now be expressed in a more revealing form:\n-   **Expansion:** $\\mu > 1 \\iff 1 + p_{rr} - p_{nn} > 1 \\iff p_{rr} > p_{nn}$. The pool expands if the probability of symmetric proliferative division exceeds that of symmetric neurogenic division.\n-   **Criticality:** $\\mu = 1 \\iff 1 + p_{rr} - p_{nn} = 1 \\iff p_{rr} = p_{nn}$. The pool is maintained if these two symmetric division probabilities are equal.\n-   **Exhaustion:** $\\mu < 1 \\iff 1 + p_{rr} - p_{nn} < 1 \\iff p_{rr} < p_{nn}$. The pool is depleted if symmetric neurogenic division is more probable than symmetric proliferation.\nThis interpretation shows that the asymmetric divisions ($p_{rn}$) are neutral with respect to the change in the *expected* number of progenitors, as they maintain the count on average. The balance between symmetric expansion and symmetric termination dictates the overall trend.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{N_{0}(2p_{rr} + p_{rn})^{t}}\n$$", "id": "2756358"}, {"introduction": "One of the most elegant mechanisms for achieving asymmetry is the precise orientation of the mitotic spindle relative to polarized cellular components.

First, define daughters as proliferative only if SOX2 positive and Ki67 positive; define neurogenic only if NeuN positive and Ki67 negative; TBR2 is considered non-decisive. Then apply: both proliferative implies symmetric proliferative; one proliferative and one neurogenic implies asymmetric neurogenic; both neurogenic implies symmetric neurogenic.\n\nD. Use co-expression to flag asymmetry. If any daughter co-expresses SOX2 and TBR2, call the division asymmetric neurogenic; if both daughters share identical marker combinations (including co-expression states), call symmetric proliferative unless both are NeuN positive, which is symmetric neurogenic. Treat TBR2 as proliferative unless NeuN is also positive to avoid overcalling neurogenesis.", "solution": "We start from the stated biological facts, which we treat as foundational. SOX2 marks neural stem or early progenitor identity; TBR2 marks intermediate progenitors committed to the neuronal lineage; NeuN marks postmitotic neurons. Fate categories follow these identities: a “progenitor” maintains SOX2 without TBR2/NeuN; a “neurogenic” daughter is one that has entered the neuronal lineage, operationalized by TBR2 and maintained or completed by NeuN. Symmetric divisions produce two daughters of the same fate; asymmetric divisions produce daughters of different fates. Transient co-expression of SOX2 and TBR2 arises at the transition toward neurogenesis, so the presence of TBR2 should be given precedence as an indicator of neurogenic commitment. NeuN positivity is a later and overriding indicator of neuronal identity.\n\nTo formalize, for each daughter $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ define binary indicators $S_i, T_i, N_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ reflecting positivity for SOX2, TBR2, and NeuN. Then define:\n- Progenitor identity for daughter $i$ as\n$$P_i := (S_i = 1) \\land (T_i = 0) \\land (N_i = 0).$$\nThis captures sustained SOX2 without neurogenic markers.\n- Neurogenic identity for daughter $i$ as\n$$G_i := (T_i = 1) \\lor (N_i = 1).$$\nThis accords precedence to TBR2 and NeuN as indicators of neurogenic commitment, consistent with transient SOX2/TBR2 co-expression being on the neurogenic trajectory. Because NeuN is downstream of TBR2, the disjunction covers postmitotic neurons and intermediate neurogenic progenitors.\n\nA division class $C$ is then assigned by:\n- Symmetric proliferative if and only if $P_1 = 1$ and $P_2 = 1$.\n- Asymmetric neurogenic if and only if $(P_1 \\oplus P_2) = 1$ and $(G_1 \\lor G_2) = 1$, where $\\oplus$ denotes exclusive OR. Given the definitions, this is equivalent to exactly one progenitor and one neurogenic daughter.\n- Symmetric neurogenic if and only if $G_1 = 1$ and $G_2 = 1$.\n\nThis rule uses only the given markers, is consistent with the precedence of TBR2 and NeuN over SOX2 in fate assignment, and correctly handles co-expression (any $S_i = 1$ with $T_i = 1$ is taken as neurogenic via $G_i = 1$ unless NeuN dominates, which is still neurogenic). It also respects that two TBR2 positive daughters (even if NeuN negative) are symmetric neurogenic, and two SOX2 positive daughters lacking TBR2/NeuN are symmetric proliferative.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option explicitly encodes the above logic. It defines progenitor daughters as SOX2 positive without TBR2 or NeuN, and neurogenic daughters as any TBR2 or NeuN positive cell, thereby giving precedence to neurogenic markers over SOX2 in co-expression. It then classifies divisions based on whether the pair is progenitor–progenitor (symmetric proliferative), progenitor–neurogenic (asymmetric neurogenic), or neurogenic–neurogenic (symmetric neurogenic). The logical structure $(\\land, \\lor, \\oplus)$ matches the biological definitions. This is Correct.\n\nB. This option ignores TBR2, which is a critical and earlier marker of neurogenic commitment than NeuN. As a result, divisions producing two TBR2 positive daughters (both neurogenic by definition) would be mislabeled as symmetric proliferative because they are NeuN negative. It also fails to handle SOX2/TBR2 co-expression by discarding TBR2 entirely. This is Incorrect.\n\nC. This option requires Ki67, which is not part of the provided dataset and violates the constraint to use only the three specified markers. It also treats TBR2 as non-decisive, contrary to the given biological base stating that TBR2 marks neurogenic progenitors. This is Incorrect.\n\nD. This option asserts that any SOX2/TBR2 co-expression implies asymmetry at the division level, which is a category error. Co-expression in a single daughter does not by itself imply different fates between daughters; asymmetry depends on comparing the two daughters, not on mixed states within one daughter. Moreover, it treats TBR2 as proliferative unless NeuN is present, which contradicts the definition of TBR2 as a neurogenic-commitment marker. Thus it would misclassify divisions with two TBR2 positive daughters as symmetric proliferative. This is Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option A states a correct decision rule given the dataset and biological constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2756348"}]}
