End-Binding Protein 3 (EB3) comets mark polymerizing microtubule plus ends. In neurons, an axon is characterized by a high fraction of microtubules oriented with their plus ends pointing distally (away from the soma), whereas dendrites exhibit mixed microtubule orientations. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) microtubules are intrinsically polarized polymers with structurally distinct plus and minus ends, (ii) EB3 comets selectively track growing plus ends, and (iii) in neurites, EB3 comets moving distally indicate plus-end-out microtubules and comets moving proximally indicate minus-end-out microtubules. You are given EB3 comet trajectory counts for four neurites of a single neuron. Ambiguous trajectories (absolute angular deviation greater than $30^{\\circ}$ from the neurite backbone) have been excluded. For neurite $i$, let $k_i$ be the number of distal (plus-end-out) comets and $m_i$ be the number of proximal (minus-end-out) comets, with total usable trajectories $n_i = k_i + m_i$.\n\nData:\n- Neurite $1$: $k_1 = 86$, $m_1 = 34$.\n- Neurite $2$: $k_2 = 74$, $m_2 = 21$.\n- Neurite $3$: $k_3 = 97$, $m_3 = 13$.\n- Neurite $4$: $k_4 = 51$, $m_4 = 54$.\n\nDefine the plus-end-out fraction for neurite $i$ as $f_i = \\frac{k_i}{n_i}$.

A solution will be derived based on the provided principles and data.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nWe will analyze each neurite by synthesizing the information from all four markers, according to the provided principles.\n- An **axon** should have: a prominent proximal AnkG band; high distal Tau enrichment ($E_{\\tau} \\gg 1$); strong distal MAP2 exclusion ($E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} \\ll 1$); and very low to zero PSD-95 density ($D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} \\approx 0$).\n- A **dendrite** should have: no AnkG band; no distal Tau enrichment ($E_{\\tau} \\le 1$); distal MAP2 enrichment ($E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} > 1$); and a high density of PSD-95 puncta ($D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} \\gg 0$).\n- A **mispolarization event** would be indicated by a neurite exhibiting a mix of axonal and dendritic characteristics, violating the canonical patterns.\n\n**Analysis of Neurite A:**\n- AnkG: A prominent band is present, spanning a considerable length ($30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). This is the defining feature of the axon initial segment (AIS) (Principle ii).\n- $E_{\\tau} = 3.5$: This high value indicates strong enrichment of Tau in the distal segment, which is characteristic of an axon (Principle iii).\n- $E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} = 0.3$: This value, significantly less than $1$, indicates strong exclusion of MAP2 from the distal neurite, a key feature of an axon (Principle iv).\n- $D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} = 0.1$ puncta per $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$: This density is negligible, consistent with the absence of postsynaptic sites on an axon (Principle v).\n**Conclusion for Neurite A:** All data points are consistent with Neurite A being a well-polarized, canonical axon.\n\n**Analysis of Neurite B:**\n- AnkG: No band detected, as expected for a dendrite.\n- $E_{\\tau} = 0.6$: This value is less than $1$, indicating no distal enrichment of Tau. This is consistent with a dendrite.\n- $E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} = 2.2$: This value is significantly greater than $1$, indicating strong enrichment of MAP2, the canonical dendritic marker (Principle iv).\n- $D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} = 2.4$ puncta per $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$: This high density reflects numerous postsynaptic sites, a defining feature of a dendrite (Principle v).\n**Conclusion for Neurite B:** All data points are consistent with Neurite B being a well-polarized, canonical dendrite.\n\n**Analysis of Neurite C:**\n- AnkG: No band detected, as expected for a dendrite.\n- $E_{\\tau} = 0.7$: Less than $1$, indicating no distal Tau enrichment, consistent with a dendrite.\n- $E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} = 1.8$: Greater than $1$, indicating MAP2 enrichment, consistent with a dendrite.\n- $D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} = 1.9$ puncta per $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$: A high density of postsynaptic sites, consistent with a dendrite.\n**Conclusion for Neurite C:** All data points are consistent with Neurite C being a well-polarized, canonical dendrite.\n\n**Analysis of Neurite D:**\nThis neurite shows a mixed and non-canonical profile.\n- AnkG: A \"faint\" and short ($10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) band is present. This is abnormal. A dendrite should have no AnkG band. This suggests the formation of an ectopic, likely unstable or incomplete, AIS-like structure.\n- $E_{\\tau} = 1.8$: This value is greater than $1$, indicating distal enrichment of Tau. This is an axonal characteristic and should not occur in a dendrite. It suggests that the ectopic AnkG domain is partially functional, causing mis-sorting of Tau into this neurite.\n- $E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} = 0.9$: This value is close to $1$, indicating neither strong enrichment (dendritic) nor strong exclusion (axonal). This ambiguous state suggests a partial breakdown of polarity mechanisms. The AIS filter is not strong enough to exclude MAP2 effectively, but the dendritic machinery is also not concentrating it.\n- $D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} = 1.2$ puncta per $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$: This is an intermediate density. It is significantly higher than the axon's ($0.1$) but lower than the canonical dendrites' ($2.4$ and $1.9$). This confirms the neurite has dendritic character (it forms postsynaptic sites), but the process might be impaired.\n**Conclusion for Neurite D:** This neurite exhibits characteristics of both an axon (AnkG band, Tau enrichment) and a dendrite (significant PSD-95 density, non-excluded MAP2). This profile is a classic example of a mispolarization event, where a dendrite ectopically acquires an AIS-like domain and consequently suffers from protein mis-sorting. It is not a second axon, as its features (AnkG band, Tau enrichment) are much weaker than in Neurite A, and it retains clear dendritic markers. It is not a \"normal variation\" of a dendrite.\n\n**Overall Interpretation:**\nThe neuron has one well-defined axon (Neurite A) and two well-defined dendrites (Neurites B and C). Neurite D is a dendrite that is undergoing a mispolarization event, characterized by the formation of an ectopic and weak AIS-like structure, leading to partial acquisition of axonal protein composition.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Neurite A is the axon; neurites B and C are dendrites; neurite D is a dendrite showing normal variation; no mispolarization is evident.**\nThe classification of neurites A, B, and C is correct. However, the interpretation of neurite D is flawed. The presence of an AnkG band and an axonal-like Tau enrichment ($E_{\\tau} > 1$) in a neurite are definitive signs of a mispolarization event, not \"normal variation\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Neurite A and neurite D are both axons (a dual-axon neuron); neurites B and C are dendrites; this represents a normal but uncommon polarity state.**\nThis option incorrectly classifies neurite D as a second axon. The AnkG band in neurite D is described as \"faint\" and is much smaller and weaker (intensity $\\approx 0.2$ of A's) than the one in neurite A. Furthermore, neurite D's failure to strongly exclude MAP2 ($E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}} = 0.9$) and its significant density of PSD-95 puncta ($D_{\\mathrm{PSD}} = 1.2$) are inconsistent with a proper axonal identity. This profile represents pathology, not a \"normal but uncommon\" state of having two axons.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Neurite A is the axon; neurites B and C are dendrites; neurite D is a dendrite exhibiting an ectopic AnkG cluster and partial Tau invasion, consistent with a mispolarization event (incipient or unstable AIS-like domain on a dendrite).**\nThis statement accurately reflects the analysis. It correctly identifies the canonical neurites (A, B, C). It correctly interprets the mixed-phenotype of neurite D as a dendrite (based on its underlying identity) that has pathologically acquired axonal features (\"ectopic AnkG cluster\", \"partial Tau invasion\"). This is the most precise and complete description of the observed data, consistent with the definition of a mispolarization event.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Neurite A is a dendrite; neurite B is the axon; neurites C and D are dendrites; no mispolarization is evident.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. It inverts the identities of the axon and one of the dendrites. Neurite A's data profile is unequivocally that of an axon, and neurite B's is that of a dendrite. This interpretation contradicts the foundational principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. All neurites are dendrites; the neuron has not yet specified an axon at DIV 10, hence the AnkG signal in neurite A is nonspecific background.**\nThis is incorrect. A neuron at DIV $10$ is expected to be polarized. The data for neurite A shows a strong, clear, and multi-faceted axonal signature (prominent AnkG, high $E_{\\tau}$, low $E_{\\mathrm{MAP2}}$, low $D_{\\mathrm{PSD}}$). To dismiss this as \"nonspecific background\" is a gross misinterpretation of the data and ignores the clear polarization established in neurites A, B, and C.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2734623"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to identify the Axon Initial Segment (AIS) as a key landmark, we now turn to its crucial function in *maintaining* neuronal polarity.

Selective trafficking depends on polarized microtubule organization and specific cargo–motor recognition.\n    2.  The AIS functions as a low-permeability boundary that limits the flux of somatodendritic membrane proteins into the axon.\n    3.

The experimental reduction of AnkG to near-background levels will, therefore, lead to the disassembly and functional loss of the AIS. The structural integrity of this critical boundary component is compromised.\n\n2.  **Impact on the AIS as a Boundary (Question ii)**: The AIS is described as a low-permeability boundary for somatodendritic cargos, modeled with an effective permeability $P_{\\mathrm{AIS}}$. The structural dissolution of the AIS means that it can no longer function effectively as a barrier. Consequently, its effective permeability to molecules that it normally restricts must increase substantially. Thus, $P_{\\mathrm{AIS}}$ increases. The flux model is given by $J \\propto P_{\\mathrm{AIS}}\\Delta c$. A significant increase in $P_{\\mathrm{AIS}}$ will lead to a correspondingly large increase in the flux $J$ of somatodendritic proteins (e.g., TfR, MAP2) from the somatodendritic compartment into the axon. The outcome is a breakdown of protein compartmentalization, where these proteins \"invade\" the axon, a domain from which they are normally excluded.\n\n3.  **Impact on Axon Identity and Neurite Competition (Question i)**: The establishment of a single, stable axon provides negative feedback that suppresses the acquisition of axonal identity by other neurites (dendrites). The AIS is the quintessential structural and functional hallmark of a mature axon; its presence solidifies axonal identity. By dismantling the AIS via AnkG knockdown, the identity of the original axon is severely weakened or lost. This loss of a definitive axon removes the source of the negative feedback signal that maintains the dendritic fate of the other neurites. As the inhibition is lifted, the system reverts to a state of active competition. Therefore, the probability that an existing dendrite will undergo conversion to adopt an axon-like fate must increase.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n- (i) Dendrite-to-axon conversion potential: **Increases**.\n- (ii) Localization of somatodendritic proteins: They are no longer restricted and **invade the axon**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Dendrite-to-axon conversion potential increases, and somatodendritic proteins invade the axon because loss of AnkG elevates $P_{\\mathrm{AIS}}$ and disrupts selective motor-based sorting at the proximal axon.**\n- **Analysis**: This option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly predicts that the dendrite-to-axon conversion potential increases due to the loss of negative feedback from the destabilized primary axon. It also correctly predicts that somatodendritic proteins invade the axon. The provided reason, an elevation of $P_{\\mathrm{AIS}}$, is the direct consequence of AIS disassembly as per the given model. The additional mention of disrupted motor-based sorting is also correct; the AIS is a critical organizer of the cytoskeleton and associated motors, so its loss naturally impairs selective transport mechanisms at that location.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Dendrite-to-axon conversion potential decreases because axon identity becomes more rigid without AnkG, and somatodendritic proteins remain excluded from the axon as the boundary tightens.**\n- **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on all points. The premise states AnkG is necessary to *maintain* the axon's identity via the AIS; its loss would make the identity less, not more, rigid. Consequently, the conversion potential would increase, not decrease. The loss of the AIS boundary would increase, not decrease (\"tighten\"), its permeability, leading to the entry, not exclusion, of somatodendritic proteins.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Dendrite-to-axon conversion potential increases, but somatodendritic proteins are more tightly retained in dendrites because kinesin-based anterograde transport into the axon is enhanced and compensates for boundary loss.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly predicts the increase in conversion potential but incorrectly describes the effect on protein localization. The claim that somatodendritic proteins would be *more tightly retained* contradicts the fundamental consequence of removing the primary barrier that excludes them from the axon. The proposed compensatory mechanism of enhanced anterograde transport is speculative and not supported by the problem's principles. Anterograde transport is typically selective for axonal cargos, not a generic force that would exclude somatodendritic ones.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Dendrite-to-axon conversion potential is unchanged, but axonal proteins such as voltage-gated sodium channels redistribute into dendrites, while somatodendritic proteins remain restricted to the somatodendritic compartment.**\n- **Analysis**: This option makes two incorrect claims regarding the questions asked. The conversion potential cannot be unchanged when the structure defining the primary axon is dismantled. Furthermore, somatodendritic proteins would not remain restricted once the AIS barrier is gone. Although the redistribution of axonal proteins is a likely collateral effect (as AnkG anchors them), this option fails to correctly answer the two specific questions posed by the problem.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2734644"}]}
