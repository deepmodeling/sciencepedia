Consider a single proliferative progenitor cell that divides once. The division outcomes are defined as follows, consistent with observed lineage behaviors in adult neurogenic niches:\n- Symmetric self-renewal yields two progenitors.\n- Asymmetric division yields one progenitor and one post-mitotic (or lineage-restricted, non-progenitor) daughter.\n- Symmetric differentiation yields two non-progenitor daughters.\n\nLet the probabilities of these outcomes be $p_s$ (symmetric self-renewal), $p_a$ (asymmetric division), and $p_d$ (symmetric differentiation), with $p_s + p_a + p_d = 1$. Model the change in the progenitor pool per division as the net change in progenitor number contributed by this single division event, relative to the one progenitor that existed before division.\n\nStarting from first principles of probability, including the definition of the expectation of a discrete random variable and the law of total probability, derive an analytic expression for the expected change in progenitor number per division as a function of $p_s$, $p_a$, and $p_d$. Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression in terms of $p_s$, $p_a$, and $p_d$. No numerical approximation is required and no units should be reported.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the expected change in the number of progenitors from a single division event. This is a classic exercise in stochastic modeling of cell populations. We will proceed from the first principles of probability theory.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of progenitor cells. Initially, we consider a single progenitor cell, so its number before division is $N_{initial} = 1$. This cell undergoes division, and we are interested in the number of progenitors after this event, which we will denote by the random variable $N_{final}$.\n\nThe problem statement specifies three mutually exclusive outcomes for the division, each with a given probability:\n\n1.  **Symmetric self-renewal**: This outcome yields two progenitor cells. In this case, $N_{final} = 2$. This event occurs with probability $p_s$.\n2.  **Asymmetric division**: This outcome yields one progenitor cell and one non-progenitor cell. In this case, $N_{final} = 1$. This event occurs with probability $p_a$.\n3.  **Symmetric differentiation**: This outcome yields two non-progenitor cells. In this case, $N_{final} = 0$. This event occurs with probability $p_d$.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected *change* in the progenitor number per division. Let us define a new random variable, $\\Delta N_p$, which represents this net change. This change is the final number of progenitors minus the initial number of progenitors:\n$$\n\\Delta N_p = N_{final} - N_{initial} = N_{final} - 1\n$$\nWe can now determine the possible values that the random variable $\\Delta N_p$ can take, and their corresponding probabilities, based on the three types of cell division:\n\n-   If symmetric self-renewal occurs (with probability $p_s$), the change in progenitor number is $\\Delta N_p = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n-   If asymmetric division occurs (with probability $p_a$), the change in progenitor number is $\\Delta N_p = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n-   If symmetric differentiation occurs (with probability $p_d$), the change in progenitor number is $\\Delta N_p = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n\nThis defines the probability mass function for the discrete random variable $\\Delta N_p$:\n$$\nP(\\Delta N_p = k) = \\begin{cases}\np_s & \\text{if } k = 1 \\\\\np_a & \\text{if } k = 0 \\\\\np_d & \\text{if } k = -1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem requires us to find the expected value of this random variable, which is denoted as $E[\\Delta N_p]$. For a discrete random variable, the expectation is defined as the sum of each possible value multiplied by its probability of occurrence.\n$$\nE[\\Delta N_p] = \\sum_{k} k \\cdot P(\\Delta N_p = k)\n$$\nSubstituting the specific values and their probabilities for our variable $\\Delta N_p$:\n$$\nE[\\Delta N_p] = (1) \\cdot P(\\Delta N_p = 1) + (0) \\cdot P(\\Delta N_p = 0) + (-1) \\cdot P(\\Delta N_p = -1)\n$$\nWe now replace the probability terms with the given symbols $p_s$, $p_a$, and $p_d$:\n$$\nE[\\Delta N_p] = (1) \\cdot p_s + (0) \\cdot p_a + (-1) \\cdot p_d\n$$\nPerforming the arithmetic operations, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\nE[\\Delta N_p] = p_s - p_d\n$$\nThis result is derived from fundamental definitions. The given constraint $p_s + p_a + p_d = 1$ is essential as it confirms that we have a complete and valid probability distribution over the set of possible outcomes, as mandated by the law of total probability. The derived expression, $p_s - p_d$, represents the average, or expected, change in the size of the progenitor pool for each division event. It correctly shows that the expansion or contraction of the progenitor population is driven by the relative balance between symmetric self-renewal ($p_s$) and symmetric differentiation ($p_d$). Asymmetric divisions ($p_a$) maintain the progenitor count and thus do not contribute to the net change, which is reflected by their absence from the final expression. If $p_s > p_d$, the pool is expected to grow; if $p_s < p_d$, it is expected to shrink; and if $p_s = p_d$, it is in a state of expected homeostasis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p_s - p_d}\n$$", "id": "2745941"}, {"introduction": "Following their birth, new neurons embark on a journey of maturation, a key phase of which is the intricate process of dendritic growth and arborization.
