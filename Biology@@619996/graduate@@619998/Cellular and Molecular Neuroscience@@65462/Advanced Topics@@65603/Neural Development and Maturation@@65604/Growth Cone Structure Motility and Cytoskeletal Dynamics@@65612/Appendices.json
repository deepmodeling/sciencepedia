Consider a single dominant barbed end at the filopodial tip. Assume the following foundational kinetic picture based on well-tested observations for actin assembly:\n\n- Addition of one globular actin monomer extends the filament by an axial rise of length $a$.\n- The stochastic addition of a monomer to the barbed end occurs with a second-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and depends on the free monomer concentration $C$.\n- The stochastic loss of a terminal subunit from the barbed end occurs with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n- Under a mean-field approximation, the net event rate is the difference between the mean addition and mean loss rates.\n\nStarting from these assumptions, derive an expression for the mean filopodial tip advance velocity in terms of $a$, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $C$, and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The provided parameters are physically realistic. I will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe velocity of the filopodial tip, denoted by $v$, is the net rate of change of the filament's length. This change is driven by the stochastic addition and removal of globular actin (G-actin) monomers at the barbed end of the filamentous actin (F-actin) core.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the process is governed by two elementary reactions:\n1.  **Association (Polymerization)**: A free G-actin monomer, with concentration $C$, binds to the barbed end. This is a second-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n    The mean rate of monomer addition, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is directly proportional to both the rate constant and the concentration of free monomers.\n    $$R_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} C$$\n    The units must be consistent. The rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is given in units of $(\\text{concentration})^{-1}(\\text{time})^{-1}$, and concentration $C$ is in units of concentration. Their product, $k_{\\mathrm{on}} C$, has units of $(\\text{time})^{-1}$, which represents the frequency of addition events, or the number of monomers added per unit time. This is correct.\n\n2.  **Dissociation (Depolymerization)**: A terminal monomer detaches from the barbed end. This is a first-order process, meaning its rate depends only on the existence of the terminal subunit, and it is characterized by the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n    The mean rate of monomer loss, $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is simply:\n    $$R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\n    The units of $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ are $(\\text{time})^{-1}$, which represents the frequency of dissociation events. This is also correct.\n\nThe problem specifies using a mean-field approximation where the net rate of polymerization is the difference between the mean addition and loss rates. The net rate of change in the number of monomers in the filament per unit time, which we denote as $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{on}} - R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nA positive value of $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ indicates net polymerization, while a negative value indicates net depolymerization.\n\nEach monomer addition extends the filament by an axial length $a$. The total length of the filament, $L$, is $L = N a$, where $N$ is the number of monomers.

These events are described as memoryless, first-order kinetic processes, which correspond to independent Poisson processes.\n\nLet the axis of the filament be oriented such that the direction from the barbed end to the pointed end is positive.

All necessary information to derive a logical conclusion is provided within the foundational facts. The scenario described is a standard experimental paradigm. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a prediction of the cellular response of a neuronal growth cone to the acute inhibition of the enzyme phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in the presence of opposing attractive and repulsive gradients. The solution must be derived strictly from the provided foundational facts.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Initial State (Control Condition)**\n\nIn the control state, the growth cone is subjected to two opposing gradients: an attractive cue, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), from the left and a repulsive cue, Semaphorin $3$A (Sema$3$A), from the right.\n\n- **Attractive Signaling (Left Side):** According to the foundational facts, attractive cues like BDNF produce localized activation of phosphoinositide $3$-kinase (PI$3$K) on the side of the growth cone facing the cue. PI$3$K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol $4,5$-bisphosphate ($\\text{PIP}_2$) to generate phosphatidylinositol $(3,4,5)$-trisphosphate ($\\text{PIP}_3$). This results in a high concentration of $\\text{PIP}_3$ on the left side of the growth cone.\n- **Repulsive Signaling (Right Side):** Repulsive cues like Sema$3$A recruit PTEN. PTEN is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates $\\text{PIP}_3$ back to $\\text{PIP}_2$. This action creates a region of low $\\text{PIP}_3$ concentration on the right side of the growth cone. Sema$3$A may also activate RhoA, promoting contractility.\n- **Resulting Polarity:** The combination of localized $\\text{PIP}_3$ production on the left and enhanced $\\text{PIP}_3$ degradation on the right establishes a steep intracellular gradient of $\\text{PIP}_3$, with high levels on the left and low levels on the right. This $\\text{PIP}_3$ gradient constitutes the internal polarity of the growth cone.\n- **Guidance Outcome:** High $\\text{PIP}_3$ recruits effectors that activate Ras-related C$3$ botulinum toxin substrate $1$ (**Rac1**) and cell division control protein $42$ (**Cdc42**), which promote actin protrusion and filopodial stabilization. This drives the leading edge to turn left, toward the BDNF source, consistent with the problem's description of the control behavior.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Perturbation (Acute PTEN Inhibition)**\n\nA selective inhibitor of PTEN is acutely applied. This globally blocks the enzymatic activity of PTEN throughout the growth cone.\n\n- **Effect on $\\text{PIP}_3$ Metabolism:** The primary pathway for $\\text{PIP}_3$ degradation ($\\text{PIP}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{PIP}_2$) is now inhibited. However, the synthesis of $\\text{PIP}_3$ via PI$3$K continues. Basal PI$3$K activity, present throughout the cell, and stimulated PI$3$K activity on the BDNF-facing side will both lead to a net accumulation of $\\text{PIP}_3$. Consequently, the overall intracellular concentration of $\\text{PIP}_3$ will rise significantly across the entire growth cone.\n\n- **Effect on the $\\text{PIP}_3$ Gradient and Polarity:** Let $C_{\\text{left}}$ and $C_{\\text{right}}$ be the $\\text{PIP}_3$ concentrations on the left and right sides of the growth cone, respectively. The directional sensitivity is given by $g \\equiv \\dfrac{C_{\\text{left}} - C_{\\text{right}}}{\\tfrac{1}{2}(C_{\\text{left}} + C_{\\text{right}})}$.\n    - Before inhibition, there is a large difference, $C_{\\text{left}} - C_{\\text{right}} > 0$.\n    - After PTEN inhibition, both $C_{\\text{left}}$ and $C_{\\text{right}}$ increase substantially. The degradation of $\\text{PIP}_3$ on the right side is now blocked, so $C_{\\text{right}}$ will increase dramatically, approaching the levels on the left. The absolute difference, $C_{\\text{left}} - C_{\\text{right}}$, may decrease or stay the same, but the average concentration, $\\tfrac{1}{2}(C_{\\text{left}} + C_{\\text{right}})$, which serves as the denominator, will increase drastically.\n    - As a result, the relative gradient $g$ will be significantly reduced. The spatial information encoded by the $\\text{PIP}_3$ gradient is \"drowned out\" by the high global background signal. This corresponds to a spatial homogenization of the $\\text{PIP}_3$ signal and a loss of front-rear polarity.\n\n- **Effect on Filopodial Dynamics:** The global elevation of $\\text{PIP}_3$ leads to the widespread activation of its downstream effectors, **Rac1** and **Cdc42**, all around the growth cone periphery. This will globally promote actin filament barbed-end generation and filopodial protrusion. We predict that filopodia will become more numerous, more motile (higher protrusion rates), and more stable (longer lifetimes) due to the pervasive pro-protrusive signaling environment.\n\n- **Effect on Guidance:**\n    - **Attractive Turning:** The diminished relative gradient of $\\text{PIP}_3$ ($g \\approx 0$) means the directional cue for turning towards the BDNF is severely weakened. The growth cone's ability to polarize and turn efficiently is compromised. The chemotactic index, a measure of turning accuracy, will decrease.\n    - **Repulsive Response:** The repulsive action of Sema$3$A is stated to involve PTEN recruitment. By inhibiting PTEN, this key repulsive mechanism is pharmacologically ablated. Therefore, the growth cone's ability to collapse or retract in response to Sema$3$A will be strongly attenuated. The global pro-protrusive state driven by high $\\text{PIP}_3$ will further antagonize any residual repulsive signaling (e.g., via RhoA).\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Global elevation and spatial homogenization of $\\text{PIP}_3$ reduce the intracellular $\\text{PIP}_3$ gradient and front–rear polarity; filopodia become more numerous with higher protrusion rates and longer lifetimes via elevated **Rac1**/**Cdc42**; turning toward the attractant diminishes (lower chemotactic index), and repulsive collapse is attenuated.**\nThis option accurately summarizes all the derived consequences. The global elevation of $\\text{PIP}_3$ flattens the gradient, reducing polarity. The downstream effect on **Rac1**/**Cdc42** correctly predicts increased filopodial protrusion and stability. Finally, it correctly concludes that both attractive turning and repulsive response will be diminished.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Localized $\\text{PIP}_3$ accumulation at the attractant-facing side is amplified, sharpening front–rear polarity; filopodia number increases but lifetimes shorten due to rapid turnover; turning toward the attractant increases, and repulsive collapse is enhanced.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple points. PTEN inhibition flattens, not sharpens, the relative $\\text{PIP}_3$ gradient. Filopodial lifetimes should increase, not shorten. Turning towards the attractant diminishes, not increases. Repulsive collapse is attenuated, not enhanced.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. $\\text{PIP}_3$ levels decline, causing loss of protrusive activity and growth cone collapse; filopodia number and length decrease; sensitivity to repulsion increases and responsiveness to attraction decreases.**\nThis option incorrectly states that $\\text{PIP}_3$ levels decline. Inhibiting an enzyme that degrades a molecule causes that molecule's concentration to rise. This option describes the effects of inhibiting PI$3$K, not PTEN.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. $\\text{PIP}_3$ remains unchanged, but downstream glycogen synthase kinase $3\\beta$ (GSK$3\\beta$) is inhibited selectively, allowing microtubules to advance; turning toward the attractant increases without altering repulsive responses or filopodial behavior.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. First, it claims $\\text{PIP}_3$ remains unchanged, which is impossible when its primary catabolic enzyme is inhibited. Second, it invokes glycogen synthase kinase $3\\beta$ (GSK$3\\beta$), a downstream effector not mentioned in the provided foundational facts, thus violating the constraints of the problem. Third, it incorrectly claims that filopodial and repulsive responses are unaltered.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2716160"}]}
