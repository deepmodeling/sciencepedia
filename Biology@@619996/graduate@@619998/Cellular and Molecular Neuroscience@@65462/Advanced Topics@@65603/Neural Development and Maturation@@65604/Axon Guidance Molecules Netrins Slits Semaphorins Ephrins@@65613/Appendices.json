This is a classic reaction-diffusion problem.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing partial differential equation from the principle of conservation of mass. The general continuity equation, which expresses mass balance in a differential volume, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + S\n$$\nwhere $c(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the concentration, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the flux vector, and $S$ represents the net rate of production or removal of the substance per unit volume.\n\nWe are given the following constitutive relations:\n1.  Fick's first law of diffusion: $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, assumed constant.\n2.  First-order removal: The removal rate is proportional to the local concentration, given by $-\\lambda c$, where $\\lambda$ is the rate constant.\n3.  Point source: The substance is emitted at a constant rate $Q$ from a point at the origin, which is mathematically represented using the Dirac delta function as $Q\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nCombining these, the net source term is $S = Q\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) - \\lambda c$. Substituting these relations into the continuity equation, we obtain the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla c) - \\lambda c + Q\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nSince $D$ is a constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c - \\lambda c + Q\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, which means the concentration no longer changes with time. Thus, we set $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation for the steady-state concentration field $c(\\mathbf{r})$ is:\n$$\nD \\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) - \\lambda c(\\mathbf{r}) + Q\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) = 0\n$$\nThis is the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation with a point source and first-order decay.\n\nWe must now solve this equation subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. For $r > 0$, the source term $Q\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$ is zero, and the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 c - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} c = 0\n$$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the point source in an isotropic medium, the concentration $c$ will depend only on the radial distance $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a spherically symmetric function is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d}{dr} \\right)$. The equation thus becomes a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} c = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we introduce the substitution $c(r) = \\frac{u(r)}{r}$. The derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{u}{r^2} \\implies r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = r \\frac{du}{dr} - u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{du}{dr} - u \\right) = \\left( \\frac{du}{dr} + r \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} \\right) - \\frac{du}{dr} = r \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the ODE for $c(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\left( r \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} \\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\frac{u}{r} = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\frac{u}{r} = 0\n$$\nFor $r>0$, this simplifies to a standard linear second-order ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} u = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $u(r) = A \\exp(-r\\sqrt{\\lambda/D}) + B \\exp(r\\sqrt{\\lambda/D})$, where $A$ and $B$ are integration constants.\nThe concentration profile is therefore:\n$$\nc(r) = \\frac{A}{r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{D/\\lambda}}\\right) + \\frac{B}{r} \\exp\\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{D/\\lambda}}\\right)\n$$\nWe define the characteristic decay length $L = \\sqrt{D/\\lambda}$, so the solution is $c(r) = \\frac{A}{r} \\exp(-r/L) + \\frac{B}{r} \\exp(r/L)$.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions.\n1.  Far from the source, as $r \\to \\infty$, the concentration must vanish: $c(r) \\to 0$. The term $\\frac{B}{r} \\exp(r/L)$ diverges as $r \\to \\infty$. To satisfy this physical requirement, the constant $B$ must be zero. This leaves $c(r) = \\frac{A}{r} \\exp(-r/L)$.\n2.  The constant $A$ is determined by the source strength $Q$. The total rate of emission from the source must be balanced by the total rate of removal from the system by diffusion and degradation. By integrating the full steady-state equation over all space and applying the divergence theorem, one can show that the total flux out of any sphere enclosing the origin, in the limit as the sphere's radius goes to zero, must equal the source rate $Q$.\n$$\nQ = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\int_{S_r} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nwhere $S_r$ is the surface of a sphere of radius $r$. The flux is $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c = -D \\frac{dc}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.

Translating this into Boolean conditions, attraction is present if and only if $D=1$, $U=0$, and $R=0$ simultaneously. Therefore, the minimal Boolean expression is\n$$\nA(D,U,R)= D \\land \\neg U \\land \\neg R.\n$$\nEquivalently, using Boolean multiplication for conjunction and overline for negation,\n$$\nA(D,U,R) = D\\,\\overline{U}\\,\\overline{R}.\n$$\n\nTruth table characterization: since $A=1$ only when all three conditions $D=1$, $U=0$, and $R=0$ are met, the unique input combination yielding attraction is\n$$\n(D,U,R)=(1,0,0).\n$$\nAll other combinations produce $A=0$ because at least one required condition fails (either $D=0$, or $U=1$, or $R=1$).\n\nNext, to compute the probability of attraction under independence, note that $A=1$ corresponds to the event $\\{D=1, U=0, R=0\\}$. Under independence of $D$, $U$, and $R$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(A=1)=\\mathbb{P}(D=1, U=0, R=0) = \\mathbb{P}(D=1)\\,\\mathbb{P}(U=0)\\,\\mathbb{P}(R=0).\n$$\nWith $\\mathbb{P}(D=1)=p_{D}$, $\\mathbb{P}(U=1)=p_{U}$, and $\\mathbb{P}(R=1)=p_{R}$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(U=0)=1-p_{U}$ and $\\mathbb{P}(R=0)=1-p_{R}$, so\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(A=1)=p_{D}\\,(1-p_{U})\\,(1-p_{R}).\n$$\nSubstituting $p_{D}=0.82$, $p_{U}=0.35$, and $p_{R}=0.50$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(A=1)=0.82 \\times (1-0.35)\\times (1-0.50)=0.82 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.50.\n$$\nCompute the product stepwise:\n$$\n0.82 \\times 0.65 = 0.533,\\quad 0.533 \\times 0.50 = 0.2665.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures as a unitless decimal, the result is $0.2665$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2665}$$", "id": "2699079"}]}
