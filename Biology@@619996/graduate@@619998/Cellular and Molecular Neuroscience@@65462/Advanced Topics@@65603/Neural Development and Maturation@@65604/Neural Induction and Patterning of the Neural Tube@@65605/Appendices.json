This condition is $\\theta < 0.2$. The minimal value of $N_0$ will correspond to the boundary case where the receptor occupancy is exactly equal to the threshold. Therefore, we will solve the system for $\\theta = 0.2$.\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of free BMP4, $B$, that results in a receptor occupancy of $\\theta = 0.2$.\nUsing the receptor occupancy equation with $\\theta = 0.2$ and $K_d^{R} = 10 \\text{ nM}$:\n$$0.2 = \\frac{B}{10 + B}$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$0.2(10 + B) = B$$\n$$2 + 0.2B = B$$\n$$2 = B - 0.2B$$\n$$2 = 0.8B$$\n$$B = \\frac{2}{0.8} = 2.5 \\text{ nM}$$\nThis is the maximum allowable concentration of free BMP4 to satisfy the condition $\\theta < 0.2$ (at the limit).\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration of the BMP4-Noggin complex, $C$, using the conservation of mass for BMP4.

Therefore, the closed-form expression for the fold-change is:\n$$\nR(n) = 81^{1/n}\n$$\nThis is the required dimensionless analytic function of $n$.\n\nTo determine how $R(n)$ depends on the Hill coefficient $n$, we analyze the function $R(n) = 81^{1/n}$. For any physically meaningful system, we assume $n \\ge 1$. As $n$ increases, the exponent $1/n$ decreases. Since the base of the exponential function, $81$, is greater than $1$, the function $R(n)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $n$.

This confirms that $R(n)$ decreases as $n$ increases.\n\nThe implication for the sharpness of gene expression boundaries is direct. A smaller value of $R(n)$ signifies that a smaller change in morphogen concentration is required to transition the gene from a low-expression state (e.g., $10\\%$ of maximum) to a high-expression state (e.g., $90\\%$ of maximum). This corresponds to a more switch-like response. Since increasing $n$ decreases $R(n)$, higher cooperativity leads to a sharper, more decisive transcriptional switch. In the spatial context of the neural tube, where the Shh concentration varies with position, this increased switch-like sensitivity translates into sharper spatial boundaries between domains of gene expression.

This requires the coefficient of the exponentially growing term to be zero, so $A=0$.\nThe boundary condition at the source, $x=0$, sets the concentration to a value we will denote as $c_0$. Thus, $c(0) = B = c_0$.\nThe concentration profile for $x>0$ is an exponential decay:\n$$ c(x) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ is the characteristic decay length of the morphogen gradient.\n\nFor the wild-type (wt) case, let the source concentration be $c_0^{(\\mathrm{wt})}$.
