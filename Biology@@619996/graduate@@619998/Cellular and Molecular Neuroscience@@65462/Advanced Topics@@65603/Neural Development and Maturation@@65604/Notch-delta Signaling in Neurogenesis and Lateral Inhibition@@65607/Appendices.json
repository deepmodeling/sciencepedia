This practice will sharpen your ability to connect molecular mechanisms to tissue-level outcomes.", "problem": "A research team uses embryonic mouse cortical slice cultures to probe the consequences of transient Notch pathway blockade on progenitor proliferation and neurogenesis. They apply DAPT, a $\\gamma$-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that prevents Notch receptor cleavage and signaling, at time $t=0$ for a defined window of duration $T_{\\mathrm{w}}=12$ hours, then wash it out. They deliver 30-minute pulses of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) at three time points: $t=1$ hour (early in the window), $t=8$ hours (late in the window), and $t=24$ hours (post-washout). For each pulse, they fix slices $1$ hour later and compute the EdU labeling index among radial glial progenitors defined as\n$$\n\\mathrm{LI}(t) = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{EdU^+~and~Sox2^+}}(t)}{N_{\\mathrm{Sox2^+}}(t)}\\,,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Sox2}$ marks progenitors. In parallel, they quantify neuronal output by counting $\\mathrm{DCX^+}$ and $\\mathrm{Tuj1^+}$ neurons at $t=24$ hours and $t=48$ hours, normalized to tissue area.\n\nUse the following foundational principles as the starting point of your reasoning: (i) Notch-Delta signaling maintains neural progenitors by inducing Hairy and Enhancer of Split (HES) transcriptional repressors that inhibit proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes; (ii) blocking Notch leads to rapid downregulation of HES and de-repression of proneural genes, promoting neuronal differentiation and cell-cycle exit; (iii) EdU incorporation marks cells in S-phase during the pulse and the labeling index among progenitors reports the fraction of progenitors in S-phase at that time; (iv) cell-cycle exit following proneural induction typically occurs upon progression to or at the next G$_1$/S decision, implying a lag approximately on the order of part of a progenitor cell cycle; and (v) lateral inhibition coordinates a salt-and-pepper arrangement such that reducing Notch signaling reduces inhibition on neighbors, thereby synchronizing and increasing neurogenic commitment locally.\n\nAssume a typical embryonic cortical progenitor cell-cycle length of approximately $12$–$18$ hours and rapid HES protein turnover on the order of a few hours or less. Under these assumptions, which of the following qualitative time courses best describes the expected changes in $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ and neuronal output in the DAPT-treated slices relative to vehicle controls?\n\nA. $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ is near control at $t=1$ hour, decreases by $t=8$ hours, and remains reduced at $t=24$ hours due to progenitor cell-cycle exit and depletion; neuronal output increases at $t=24$–$48$ hours as more neurons are produced prematurely, then would be expected to taper with longer times as the progenitor pool is reduced.\n\nB. $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ increases progressively at $t=1$ hour and $t=8$ hours and stays elevated at $t=24$ hours because Notch blockade forces symmetric proliferative divisions; neuronal output decreases at $t=24$–$48$ hours because differentiation is suppressed without Notch.\n\nC. $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ drops to near zero immediately at $t=1$ hour and remains at zero at $t=8$ hours and $t=24$ hours; neuronal output shows no significant change because differentiation requires ongoing Notch signaling.\n\nD. $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ transiently increases within the DAPT window (both $t=1$ hour and $t=8$ hours) due to synchronized entry into S-phase caused by Notch inhibition, returning to baseline by $t=24$ hours; neuronal output transiently decreases during the window and rebounds after washout because progenitors re-enter the cell cycle.", "solution": "Begin from the stated foundational principles. Notch-Delta signaling in neural progenitors maintains the progenitor state by inducing Hairy and Enhancer of Split (HES) repressors that inhibit proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors such as Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1) and Neurogenins. Pharmacological blockade of $\\gamma$-secretase prevents Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) release, downregulates HES, and thereby de-represses proneural genes. This shift biases progenitors toward neuronal differentiation and cell-cycle exit (principles $(i)$ and $(ii)$).\n\nEdU incorporation labels cells that are in S-phase during the pulse. The labeling index $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ among progenitors reflects the fraction of Sox$2^+$ progenitors that are in S-phase at the time of pulsing (principle $(iii)$). After Notch inhibition, an immediate global cessation of S-phase is biologically implausible because cells already in S-phase or committed to completing their current cycle will typically continue to do so; cell-cycle exit usually occurs at or before the next G$_1$/S transition, implying a lag on the scale of a portion of a cell cycle (principle $(iv)$). Embryonic cortical progenitor cell cycles are on the order of $12$–$18$ hours, and HES proteins turn over relatively rapidly (hours or less), so proneural upregulation can begin within a few hours, but the effect on the S-phase fraction will more clearly manifest by the time cells reach the next G$_1$/S decision, i.e., over several hours approaching roughly one cell cycle.\n\nLateral inhibition normally enforces a salt-and-pepper pattern: a Delta-high differentiating cell activates Notch in neighbors to keep them as progenitors. Notch blockade reduces this inhibitory communication, thereby allowing clusters of progenitors to commit to neurogenesis more synchronously, which would transiently increase neuronal output (principle $(v)$).\n\nApply these principles to the time points:\n\n- At $t=1$ hour (early during DAPT): HES downregulation is underway, but many progenitors that were already in S-phase or late G$_1$ may still incorporate EdU. Therefore, $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ is expected to be near control, perhaps modestly reduced but not dramatically, given the short lag.\n\n- At $t=8$ hours (late during DAPT): A substantial subset of progenitors has experienced several hours of reduced HES, increased proneural bHLH activity, and begun to commit to differentiation with cell-cycle exit at or before the next G$_1$/S. Thus, the fraction of Sox$2^+$ progenitors in S-phase during the EdU pulse should be reduced relative to control, leading to a decreased $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$.\n\n- At $t=24$ hours (post-washout): After $12$ hours of DAPT and subsequent washout, many progenitors have exited the cycle and differentiated; the remaining Sox$2^+$ pool is smaller and enriched for cells not in S-phase if exit decisions have continued to propagate. Consequently, $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ remains reduced compared to control. Washout does not reverse the fate commitment that has already occurred.\n\nNeuronal output measured as $\\mathrm{DCX^+}$ or $\\mathrm{Tuj1^+}$ neurons at $t=24$–$48$ hours should increase relative to control because more progenitors prematurely differentiate during and shortly after the DAPT window. Over longer durations, ongoing neuronal output would be expected to taper as the progenitor pool becomes depleted, but within $48$ hours a net increase is typically observed.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. States that $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ is near control at $t=1$ hour, decreases by $t=8$ hours, and remains reduced at $t=24$ hours due to progenitor exit and depletion. It also predicts increased neuronal output at $t=24$–$48$ hours with an eventual taper as progenitors are reduced. This matches the mechanistic expectations derived from principles $(i)$–$(v)$ and the cell-cycle timing considerations. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Claims that Notch blockade forces symmetric proliferative divisions, raising $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$, and that neuronal output decreases because differentiation is suppressed. This inverts the known role of Notch; blockade biases toward differentiation, not proliferation, and increases, not decreases, neuronal output in the short term. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Predicts an immediate drop of $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ to near zero at $t=1$ hour and no change in neuronal output because differentiation requires Notch. Immediate zero $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ is not consistent with cell-cycle kinetics, and differentiation does not require Notch; rather, Notch restrains it. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Suggests a transient increase in $\\mathrm{LI}(t)$ during the DAPT window due to synchronized S-phase entry caused by Notch inhibition and a transient decrease in neuronal output. Notch inhibition does not induce synchronized S-phase entry; it promotes proneural expression and exit from the cycle. Neuronal output should not transiently decrease under Notch blockade; it should increase. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative time course described in option A is the best prediction under the stated assumptions and measurement schedule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2735830"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the overall output of a signaling pathway, a deeper level of analysis involves dissecting the roles of its specific molecular components. This problem explores how different disruptions within the Notch receptor itself can lead to distinct phenotypes, highlighting the importance of non-autonomous effects. By comparing loss-of-function mutations that block S2 versus S3 cleavage, you will apply the concept of cis-inhibition to predict how a cell's internal state can alter its ability to signal to its neighbors [@problem_id:2682308]. This exercise underscores that the specific point of failure in a pathway can have surprisingly different consequences for tissue patterning.", "problem": "A developing epithelial field uses the Notch-Delta juxtacrine pathway to generate a lateral inhibition pattern in which adjacent cells adopt alternating fates. Canonical pathway facts that will be used as the starting base are: Notch receptor activation requires ligand (Delta) binding in trans, force-dependent exposure of an extracellular cleavage site followed by cleavage at site S2 by A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM10), then intramembrane cleavage at site S3 by the presenilin-containing gamma-secretase complex to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The Notch intracellular domain enters the nucleus and co-activates CSL (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1) to induce transcription of Hairy and Enhancer of Split (Hes/E(spl)) family repressors, which downregulate Delta expression. Notch and Delta co-expressed on the same cell membrane can bind in cis, reducing the amount of Delta available for productive trans-activation of neighbors (cis-inhibition). In lateral inhibition, a cell with higher Notch activity tends to adopt a non-neuronal fate and suppress its own Delta, whereas a cell with lower Notch activity tends to adopt a neuronal fate and upregulate Delta.\n\nConsider two mosaic experiments in which small clones of mutant cells are generated in an otherwise wild-type epithelium that is otherwise capable of forming a salt-and-pepper pattern. In one experiment, the clone lacks S2 cleavage (for example, an ADAM10 loss-of-function), and in the other, the clone lacks S3 cleavage (for example, a gamma-secretase/presenilin loss-of-function). Assume that the capacity of Delta to signal neighbors depends on the amount of Delta available for trans interactions after cis-inhibition. Let the Notch input received by a cell $i$ be denoted $N_i$, and let the cell’s Delta production be $D_i$. The effective Delta available for trans-signaling can be written as $D_i^{\\text{eff}} = D_i/(1+\\alpha R_i)$, where $R_i$ is the abundance of the Notch receptor extracellular domain on cell $i$ available for cis-binding, and $\\alpha > 0$ is a constant capturing the strength of cis-inhibition. In both mutants, the nuclear NICD signal is absent in the mutant cells, so $D_i$ is not repressed by Notch inside those mutant cells. In S2 cleavage-deficient cells, $R_i$ remains high because the Notch extracellular domain cannot be shed. In S3 cleavage-deficient cells, S2 cleavage still occurs upon engagement by neighboring Delta, thereby reducing $R_i$ on those mutant cells after interactions.\n\nWhich option best predicts the qualitative phenotypic differences between the two clones with respect to cell-autonomous fate and non-autonomous effects on immediately adjacent wild-type neighbors (within approximately $1$–$2$ cell diameters), and provides the most accurate mechanistic rationale?\n\nA. Both S2- and S3-block clones show cell-autonomous loss of Notch reception (low $N_i$), adopt neuronal fate, and upregulate $D_i$. However, S2-block clones exert weaker non-autonomous inhibition on adjacent wild-type neighbors because high $R_i$ in the mutant enforces strong cis-inhibition, keeping $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ relatively low. S3-block clones, by permitting S2 cleavage and thus lowering $R_i$, have higher $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ and therefore drive stronger Notch activation (higher $N_j$) and non-neuronal fate in their wild-type neighbors at the clone boundary.\n\nB. Neither S2- nor S3-block clones alter their neighbors because S2 and S3 cleavages occur only in the Notch-receiving cell; therefore, both mutations cause purely cell-autonomous loss-of-function with no non-autonomous consequences.\n\nC. S2-block clones accumulate signaling-competent Notch and therefore show a Notch gain-of-function, adopting non-neuronal fate and suppressing Delta, which in turn makes their neighbors more likely to adopt neuronal fate. S3-block clones lose Notch signaling cell-autonomously but do not affect their neighbors.\n\nD. Relative to S3 block, S2 block causes stronger non-autonomous promotion of neurogenesis in neighboring wild-type cells because uncleavable Notch on the mutant cell sequesters neighbors’ Delta, depriving neighbors of the ability to self-inhibit and causing them to adopt neuronal fate, whereas S3-block clones have little effect on their neighbors.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to distinguish the phenotypes of two different loss-of-function mutations in the Notch receptor, one blocking S2 cleavage and the other blocking S3 cleavage. The analysis requires consideration of both cell-autonomous effects (the fate of the mutant cell itself) and non-autonomous effects (the influence of the mutant cell on its wild-type neighbors).\n\nLet us formalize the analysis based on the provided information.\n\n**1. General Principles and Model**\n\n- Notch signaling leads to release of the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD).\n- NICD represses the expression of the Delta ligand, $D$.\n- In the absence of NICD, $D$ expression is derepressed (i.e., upregulated).\n- A cell with low Notch activity ($N_i$) tends to a neuronal fate. A cell with high Notch activity tends to a non-neuronal fate.\n- The effective amount of Delta that a cell $i$ can present to its neighbors for trans-activation is given by the equation:\n$$D_i^{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{D_i}{1+\\alpha R_i}$$\nwhere $D_i$ is the total amount of Delta protein produced by cell $i$, $R_i$ is the abundance of the Notch receptor extracellular domain on cell $i$ available for cis-binding, and $\\alpha > 0$ is a constant. This equation models cis-inhibition: a higher amount of Notch receptor on the same cell ($R_i$) reduces the effective Delta signal ($D_i^{\\text{eff}}$) sent to neighbors.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mutant Clones**\n\nFor both mutant types, the pathway to produce NICD is blocked. Therefore, for any mutant cell $i$, the internal Notch signal $N_i$ is effectively zero.\n\n**Cell-Autonomous Effects (for both mutants):**\n- Since $N_i \\approx 0$, there is no NICD-mediated repression of Delta.\n- Consequently, Delta production, $D_i$, will be high (derepressed).\n- According to the principles of lateral inhibition, a cell with low Notch activity adopts a neuronal fate.\n- Therefore, both S2-block and S3-block mutant cells will be cell-autonomously driven to a neuronal fate and will exhibit high levels of Delta protein production, $D_i$.\n\n**Non-Autonomous Effects (Differentiating the mutants):**\nThe non-autonomous effect of a mutant cell $i$ on its neighbor $j$ depends on the strength of the signal it sends, which is quantified by $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$. This is where the two mutants diverge.\n\n- **S2-Block Clone (e.g., ADAM10 loss-of-function):**\n  - The problem states that in these cells, the Notch extracellular domain cannot be shed. This means that the abundance of the Notch receptor extracellular domain, $R_i$, remains high.\n  - The cell produces a high level of Delta, $D_i$.\n  - However, the effective signal sent to neighbors is $D_i^{\\text{eff}} = D_i/(1+\\alpha R_i)$. With $R_i$ being high, the denominator $(1+\\alpha R_i)$ is large.\n  - As a result, $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ is relatively low. The S2-block mutant cell is a **weak sender** of the Delta signal.\n  - This weak signal will lead to only low-level Notch activation in its immediate wild-type neighbors.\n\n- **S3-Block Clone (e.g., gamma-secretase loss-of-function):**\n  - The problem states that S2 cleavage still occurs in these cells upon engagement by Delta from neighboring cells.\n  - S2 cleavage results in the shedding of the Notch extracellular domain. This process reduces the amount of receptor on the cell surface available for cis-binding. Thus, $R_i$ is lowered.\n  - This cell also produces a high level of Delta, $D_i$, due to the lack of NICD.\n  - The effective signal is $D_i^{\\text{eff}} = D_i/(1+\\alpha R_i)$. With a high $D_i$ and a low $R_i$, the denominator $(1+\\alpha R_i)$ is small (close to $1$).\n  - As a result, $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ is high. The S3-block mutant cell is a **strong sender** of the Delta signal.\n  - This strong signal will lead to high-level Notch activation in its immediate wild-type neighbors, pushing them towards a non-neuronal fate.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- **S2-Block Cells:** Neuronal fate (cell-autonomous), weak signal to neighbors (non-autonomous).\n- **S3-Block Cells:** Neuronal fate (cell-autonomous), strong signal to neighbors (non-autonomous).\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options based on this derivation.\n\n**Option A:** \"Both S2- and S3-block clones show cell-autonomous loss of Notch reception (low $N_i$), adopt neuronal fate, and upregulate $D_i$. However, S2-block clones exert weaker non-autonomous inhibition on adjacent wild-type neighbors because high $R_i$ in the mutant enforces strong cis-inhibition, keeping $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ relatively low. S3-block clones, by permitting S2 cleavage and thus lowering $R_i$, have higher $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ and therefore drive stronger Notch activation (higher $N_j$) and non-neuronal fate in their wild-type neighbors at the clone boundary.\"\n\n- This statement correctly identifies the cell-autonomous phenotype (neuronal fate, high $D_i$) for both mutants.\n- It correctly identifies that S2-block cells are weak senders due to high $R_i$ and strong cis-inhibition, resulting in low $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$.\n- It correctly identifies that S3-block cells are strong senders because S2 cleavage lowers $R_i$, leading to high $D_i^{\\text{eff}}$ and consequently strong Notch activation and non-neuronal fate in neighbors.\n- This option's reasoning and conclusion align perfectly with our analysis.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:** \"Neither S2- nor S3-block clones alter their neighbors because S2 and S3 cleavages occur only in the Notch-receiving cell; therefore, both mutations cause purely cell-autonomous loss-of-function with no non-autonomous consequences.\"\n\n- This statement is fundamentally incorrect. While the cleavages are indeed events within the receiving cell, the mutation affects the overall properties of that cell, including its ability to send signals. Juxtacrine signaling by its nature involves non-autonomous effects. The premise that the mutations are purely cell-autonomous contradicts the known biology of the pathway and the setup of the problem, which explicitly introduces a mechanism for non-autonomous signaling ($D^{\\text{eff}}$).\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:** \"S2-block clones accumulate signaling-competent Notch and therefore show a Notch gain-of-function, adopting non-neuronal fate and suppressing Delta, which in turn makes their neighbors more likely to adopt neuronal fate. S3-block clones lose Notch signaling cell-autonomously but do not affect their neighbors.\"\n\n- This statement incorrectly classifies an S2-block as a gain-of-function. Blocking cleavage prevents the release of NICD, which is the active signaling molecule. This is a classic loss-of-function scenario. Consequently, the cell adopts a neuronal fate and upregulates Delta, the opposite of what is stated. The claim about S3-block clones not affecting neighbors is also incorrect, as established in our analysis.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:** \"Relative to S3 block, S2 block causes stronger non-autonomous promotion of neurogenesis in neighboring wild-type cells because uncleavable Notch on the mutant cell sequesters neighbors’ Delta, depriving neighbors of the ability to self-inhibit and causing them to adopt neuronal fate, whereas S3-block clones have little effect on their neighbors.\"\n\n- This option proposes an alternative mechanism: sequestration of Delta from neighbors by the high level of Notch receptor on the S2-block mutant cell surface (a \"signal sink\" effect). While such an effect is biologically plausible, the problem explicitly provides a model based on cis-inhibition ($D_i^{\\text{eff}}$) to explain the non-autonomous behavior. The most accurate mechanistic rationale must be based on the framework provided. Option A uses the provided framework directly. Option D ignores it in favor of another mechanism. Furthermore, the core difference lies in the sending capacity of the mutant cells. Our analysis showed the S2-block is a weak sender and the S3-block is a strong sender. Therefore, the S2-block would indeed \"promote neurogenesis\" in neighbors (by failing to inhibit them), while the S3-block would strongly inhibit neurogenesis. While the outcome described for S2 mutants is correct, the provided rationale (\"sequesters neighbors' Delta\") is not the one modeled in the problem statement. The most precise answer must follow the problem's own logic, which centers on how cis-inhibition modulates the *outgoing* signal from the mutant cell.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the problem statement and the provided biophysical model, Option A provides the most complete and accurate description of both the cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2682308"}, {"introduction": "The principles of lateral inhibition can be formalized into powerful mathematical models that provide precise, quantitative predictions about pattern formation.

The critical condition for the onset of patterning is therefore $\\lambda_a = 0$, which implies:\n$$ A = -1 $$\nSubstituting our expression for $A$ gives the bifurcation condition:\n$$ \\frac{-2\\eta_c^2(D^{\\ast})^3}{\\theta^2(1+D^{\\ast})^3} = -1 \\quad \\implies \\quad 2\\eta_c^2(D^{\\ast})^3 = \\theta^2(1+D^{\\ast})^3 $$\nHere, $\\eta_c$ is the critical coupling strength. This is one equation relating the unknowns $\\eta_c$ and $D^{\\ast}$ at the bifurcation point.\n\nThe second equation is the steady-state condition itself, evaluated at the critical point:\n$$ D^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\theta^{2}}{\\theta^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\eta_c D^{\\ast}}{1+D^{\\ast}}\\right)^{2}} $$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$ D^{\\ast} \\left( \\theta^{2} + \\frac{\\eta_c^2 (D^{\\ast})^2}{(1+D^{\\ast})^2} \\right) = \\theta^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\eta_c^2(D^{\\ast})^3}{(1+D^{\\ast})^2} = \\theta^2(1-D^{\\ast}) $$\nWe now have a system of two equations for $\\eta_c$ and $D^{\\ast}$. From the bifurcation condition $2\\eta_c^2(D^{\\ast})^3 = \\theta^2(1+D^{\\ast})^3$, we can express $\\eta_c^2$ as:\n$$ \\eta_c^2 = \\frac{\\theta^2(1+D^{\\ast})^3}{2(D^{\\ast})^3} $$\nSubstitute this expression for $\\eta_c^2$ into the rearranged steady-state equation:\n$$ \\frac{(D^{\\ast})^3}{(1+D^{\\ast})^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\theta^2(1+D^{\\ast})^3}{2(D^{\\ast})^3} \\right] = \\theta^2(1-D^{\\ast}) $$\nAssuming $\\theta \\ne 0$, we can simplify this equation considerably:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta^2(1+D^{\\ast})}{2} = \\theta^2(1-D^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1+D^{\\ast}}{2} = 1-D^{\\ast} $$\n$$ 1+D^{\\ast} = 2 - 2D^{\\ast} \\quad \\implies \\quad 3D^{\\ast} = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThis is the value of the symmetric steady state Delta level at the bifurcation point.\n\nFinally, we solve for the critical coupling strength $\\eta_c(\\theta)$ by substituting $D^{\\ast}=1/3$ back into the expression for $\\eta_c^2$:\n$$ \\eta_c^2 = \\frac{\\theta^2(1+1/3)^3}{2(1/3)^3} = \\frac{\\theta^2(4/3)^3}{2(1/27)} = \\frac{\\theta^2(64/27)}{2/27} = 32\\theta^2 $$\nTaking the square root (and knowing $\\eta_c > 0, \\theta > 0$):\n$$ \\eta_c = \\sqrt{32\\theta^2} = \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 2} \\cdot \\theta = 4\\sqrt{2}\\theta $$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the critical coupling strength at which the symmetric state loses stability to the antisymmetric patterning mode.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}\\theta} $$", "id": "2735877"}]}
