Consider a single neuron modeled as a run–pause process with the following properties: when moving tangentially along axonal substrates, its instantaneous run speed is $15$ $\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$; when moving radially along radial glial fibers, its instantaneous run speed is $25$ $\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$. In both stages, the neuron's movement is interspersed with pauses such that a constant fraction $p=0.20$ of the total time is spent paused (stationary). Assume the run–pause statistics are stationary and ergodic so that the long-time average velocity equals the time-average over runs and pauses, and that the pausing fraction is the same in both stages and independent of the path length.\n\nThe neuron traverses a tangential path length of $500$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ and then a radial path length of $200$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.
