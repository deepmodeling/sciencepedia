The channel exists in two main conformations: a closed state ($C$) and an open state ($O$). The transition between these conformations is allosterically regulated by the binding of a ligand, which is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Let the concentration of cGMP be denoted by $x = [\\mathrm{cGMP}]$. The channel has $n$ identical and independent binding sites for cGMP.\n\nLet $C_i$ and $O_i$ denote the closed and open states with $i$ ligands bound, respectively, where $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n\\}$.\nThe intrinsic equilibrium between the unliganded conformations is given by the allosteric constant $L_0$:\n$$L_0 = \\frac{[C_0]}{[O_0]}$$\nThe problem states that the closed conformation is favored in the absence of ligand, which implies $L_0 \\gg 1$.\n\nThe binding of cGMP to the closed and open conformations is characterized by microscopic dissociation constants, $K_C$ and $K_O$. For a protein with $n$ identical sites, the concentrations of the various liganded states are related to the unliganded state by the law of mass action, incorporating statistical factors:\n$$[C_i] = \\binom{n}{i} [C_0] \\left( \\frac{x}{K_C} \\right)^i$$\n$$[O_i] = \\binom{n}{i} [O_0] \\left( \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^i$$\n\nThe total concentration of channels in the closed state, $\\sum_C$, and in the open state, $\\sum_O$, can be calculated using the binomial theorem:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n} [C_i] = [C_0] \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} \\left( \\frac{x}{K_C} \\right)^i = [C_0] \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_C} \\right)^n$$\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n} [O_i] = [O_0] \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} \\left( \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^i = [O_0] \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n$$\n\nThe steady-state open probability, $P_o$, is the fraction of all channels in any of the open states:\n$$P_o = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n} [O_i]}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n} [C_i] + \\sum_{i=0}^{n} [O_i]} = \\frac{[O_0] \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}{[C_0] \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_C} \\right)^n + [O_0] \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}$$\nSubstituting $[C_0] = L_0 [O_0]$ and dividing the numerator and denominator by $[O_0]$ gives the general MWC expression for $P_o$:\n$$P_o = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}{L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_C} \\right)^n + \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}$$\n\nTo derive a high-cooperativity expression that resembles a Hill-type relation, we must apply justified approximations based on the problem statement.\n\nApproximation 1: \"Binding to the closed conformation is much weaker than to the open conformation.\" This translates to a much larger dissociation constant for the closed state, i.e., $K_C \\gg K_O$. For the physiological range of cGMP concentrations $x$ that cause channel activation, we can assume that $x/K_C \\ll 1$. Therefore, the term $(1 + x/K_C)$ can be approximated as $1$. Applying this approximation, the expression for $P_o$ simplifies to:\n$$P_o \\approx \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}{L_0 \\cdot (1)^n + \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}{L_0 + \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}$$\n\nApproximation 2: The problem describes \"highly cooperative\" gating. In such MWC systems, characterized by $L_0 \\gg 1$, significant channel opening occurs only at ligand concentrations sufficient to overcome the large energetic penalty of the conformational change. This typically occurs in a concentration range where $x$ is significantly greater than the microscopic dissociation constant $K_O$. Thus, we can make the approximation $x/K_O \\gg 1$, which implies $(1 + x/K_O) \\approx x/K_O$. This approximation holds well for states with multiple ligands bound, which dominate the open probability in a highly cooperative system. Applying this to our simplified $P_o$ expression:\n$$P_o \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n}{L_0 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K_O} \\right)^n} = \\frac{\\frac{x^n}{K_O^n}}{L_0 + \\frac{x^n}{K_O^n}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $K_O^n$ yields the final Hill-type relation:\n$$P_o(x) = \\frac{x^n}{x^n + L_0 K_O^n}$$\nThis equation is of the form of a Hill equation of order $n$, $P_o(x) = \\frac{x^n}{x^n + (K_{1/2})^n}$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the half-activation concentration $K_{1/2}$ as the concentration at which $P_o = 1/2$. This occurs when $x^n = K_{1/2}^n$. From our derived expression, this means:\n$$(K_{1/2})^n = L_0 K_O^n$$\nTherefore, the half-activation concentration emerges from the underlying MWC parameters as:\n$$K_{1/2} = K_O (L_0)^{1/n}$$\nThe validity of the second approximation requires $(K_{1/2} / K_O) \\gg 1$, which means $(L_0)^{1/n} \\gg 1$. Given that $L_0 \\gg 1$, this condition is met for physically realistic large values of $L_0$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Fractional Current Reduction\n\nThe macroscopic current $I$ is given to be proportional to the open probability $P_o$, so $I(x) = c \\cdot P_o(x)$ for some proportionality constant $c$. The relationship between current and cGMP concentration $x$ is thus a Hill equation with a Hill coefficient equal to the number of binding sites $n$.\n$$I(x) = c \\frac{x^n}{x^n + K_{1/2}^n}$$\nThe given parameters are $n = 3$ and $K_{1/2} = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe dark-adapted cGMP concentration is $[\\mathrm{cGMP}]_{\\mathrm{dark}} = 4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

The concentration in the light, $[\\mathrm{cGMP}]_{\\mathrm{light}}$, is:\n$$[\\mathrm{cGMP}]_{\\mathrm{light}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{cGMP}]_{\\mathrm{dark}}}{10} = \\frac{4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{10} = 0.40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe current in the light, $I_{\\mathrm{light}}$, is therefore:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{light}} = c \\frac{([\\mathrm{cGMP}]_{\\mathrm{light}})^3}{([\\mathrm{cGMP}]_{\\mathrm{light}})^3 + K_{1/2}^3} = c \\frac{(0.40)^3}{(0.40)^3 + (2.5)^3}$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the fractional reduction in current, which is defined as $1 - I_{\\mathrm{light}}/I_{\\mathrm{dark}}$. The constant $c$ cancels in the ratio:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{light}}}{I_{\\mathrm{dark}}} = \\frac{\\frac{(0.40)^3}{(0.40)^3 + (2.5)^3}}{\\frac{(4.0)^3}{(4.0)^3 + (2.5)^3}} = \\frac{(0.40)^3}{(4.0)^3} \\cdot \\frac{(4.0)^3 + (2.5)^3}{(0.40)^3 + (2.5)^3}$$\nLet's compute the numerical values. The units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel and can be omitted.\n$$(4.0)^3 = 64$$\n$$(0.40)^3 = 0.064$$\n$$(2.5)^3 = 15.625$$\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{light}}}{I_{\\mathrm{dark}}} = \\frac{0.064}{64} \\cdot \\frac{64 + 15.625}{0.064 + 15.625} = 0.001 \\cdot \\frac{79.625}{15.689}$$\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{light}}}{I_{\\mathrm{dark}}} \\approx 0.001 \\cdot 5.075463... \\approx 0.005075463$$\n\nThe fractional reduction in current is then:\n$$1 - \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{light}}}{I_{\\mathrm{dark}}} = 1 - 0.005075463 = 0.994924537$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.9949$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9949}$$", "id": "2738495"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of channel gating, we now zoom out to the level of the entire rod outer segment to examine the cell's integrated electrical response.

We solve for $I$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$I = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(Bx)\\left(-\\frac{A K_B}{K_B + x}\\right)}}{2Bx}$$\n$$I(x) = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4ABxK_B}{K_B + x}}}{2Bx}$$\nSince the current $I$ must be a positive physical quantity, we must select the positive root of the solution.\n$$I(x) = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4ABxK_B}{K_B + x}}}{2Bx}$$\nNow, we calculate $I$ for the two specified conditions using the provided values: $A = 10\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, $B = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{pA}^{-1}$, and $K_B = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nFor the control condition, $x_{\\text{control}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$:\nThe term inside the square root is:\n$$1 + \\frac{4(10)(0.05)(1.0)(0.2)}{0.2 + 1.0} = 1 + \\frac{0.4}{1.2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nThe denominator is $2Bx_{\\text{control}} = 2(0.05)(1.0) = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{pA}^{-1}$.\nSo, the control current is:\n$$I_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}}}{0.1} = 10 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1\\right) \\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\nNumerically, $I_{\\text{control}} \\approx 10(1.15470 - 1) = 1.5470\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nFor the low-calcium condition, $x_{\\text{low}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$:\nThe term inside the square root is:\n$$1 + \\frac{4(10)(0.05)(0.1)(0.2)}{0.2 + 0.1} = 1 + \\frac{0.04}{0.3} = 1 + \\frac{4}{30} = 1 + \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{17}{15}$$\nThe denominator is $2Bx_{\\text{low}} = 2(0.05)(0.1) = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{pA}^{-1}$.\nSo, the low-calcium current is:\n$$I_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{15}}}{0.01} = 100 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{15}} - 1\\right) \\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\nNumerically, $I_{\\text{low}} \\approx 100(1.06458 - 1) = 6.458\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{I_{\\text{low}}}{I_{\\text{control}}} = \\frac{100 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{15}} - 1\\right)}{10 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1\\right)} \\approx \\frac{6.458}{1.5470} \\approx 4.17453$$\nThe problem requires the result rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 4.175$$\nThis ratio also represents the ratio of the peak flash response amplitudes, as the response amplitude is stated to be proportional to the dark current. Lowering external calcium reduces the block on CNG channels ($f_o$ increases) and disinhibits guanylyl cyclase (via lower internal calcium, increasing $S$), both of which serve to increase the steady-state dark current. The calculation quantifies this combined effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.175}$$", "id": "2738448"}]}
