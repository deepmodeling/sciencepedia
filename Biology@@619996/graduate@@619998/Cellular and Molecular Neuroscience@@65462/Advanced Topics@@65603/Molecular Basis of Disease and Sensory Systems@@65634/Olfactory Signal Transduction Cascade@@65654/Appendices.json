The foundation of this calculation is the law of mass action applied to ligand-receptor binding at equilibrium.\n\nLet $R$ denote an unbound receptor, $L$ denote an odorant ligand molecule, and $RL$ denote the receptor-ligand complex. The problem states that the binding is reversible and at equilibrium. The binding process is described by the chemical equilibrium:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the bound receptor-ligand complex. The problem provides the extracellular odorant concentration, which we assume represents the free ligand concentration $[L]$, as the number of receptors is typically small and their binding does not significantly deplete the ligand from the bulk medium.\n\nThe fraction of receptors that are occupied by a ligand, denoted by $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors, $[R_{total}]$. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors: $[R_{total}] = [R] + [RL]$. Thus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{total}]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for $\\theta$ gives:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]} $$\nAssuming a non-zero ligand concentration, $[RL]$ is also non-zero, and we can divide the numerator and denominator by $[RL]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\nThis expression simplifies to the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes fractional occupancy for a system with a single class of independent binding sites:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, represents the probability that any single, independent receptor is bound to a ligand at equilibrium. The problem states that there are a total of $N_{total}$ receptors per cilium, which behave as independent sites. The expected number of occupied receptors, $\\langle n_{bound} \\rangle$, is therefore the total number of receptors multiplied by the probability of any one receptor being occupied:\n$$ \\langle n_{bound} \\rangle = N_{total} \\times \\theta = N_{total} \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThe statement that the count of bound receptors is well-described by Poisson statistics is consistent with this framework. For a large number of independent trials $N_{total}$ each with a small probability of success $\\theta$, the binomial distribution of the number of successes can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = N_{total} \\times \\theta$.
