The problem describes the canonical Gq signaling cascade initiated by bradykinin, a well-established physiological process in nociception. The use of the law of mass action and the Hill-Langmuir isotherm for receptor-ligand binding is standard pharmacological practice. The specified values for concentration and the dissociation constant are physiologically plausible for a high-affinity interaction. The relationship between receptor occupancy and downstream signaling response is defined in a clear, linear fashion, which constitutes a simple but valid biophysical model. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a rigorous solution is required.\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional occupancy ($\\theta$) of the B2 receptor. Let $[R]$ be the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ be the concentration of the free ligand (bradykinin), and $[RL]$ be the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex. The total receptor concentration is $[R]_{total} = [R] + [RL]$.\n\nThe binding reaction at equilibrium is $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nFrom this expression, we solve for the concentration of free receptors:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$$\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by ligand:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[R]$ into the denominator gives:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]}$$\nWe can factor $[RL]$ from the denominator, provided $[RL] \\ne 0$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ yields the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $[L] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$ and $K_d = 10\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nM}}{10\\,\\text{nM} + 100\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{100}{110} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\nThis is the fractional occupancy of the B2 receptor under the specified conditions.\n\nThe second task is to determine the steady-state IP$_3$ production rate, $R$. The problem states that PLC activation is proportional to the fractional receptor occupancy. This means the rate of IP$_3$ production, $R$, is a linear function of $\\theta$. We are given the basal rate $R_0$ (at $\\theta = 0$) and the maximal rate $R_{\\max}$ (at $\\theta = 1$). A linear model connecting these points is required.\nThe total production rate $R$ is the sum of the basal rate and the occupancy-dependent increase. The maximum possible increase in rate above basal is $\\Delta R = R_{\\max} - R_0$. The actual increase is proportional to the occupancy $\\theta$.\nTherefore, the total rate $R$ as a function of $\\theta$ is:\n$$R(\\theta) = R_0 + (R_{\\max} - R_0) \\theta$$\nThis equation correctly yields $R(0) = R_0$ and $R(1) = R_0 + (R_{\\max} - R_0) = R_{\\max}$, satisfying the boundary conditions.\n\nWe now substitute the known values into this equation: $R_0 = 0.05\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $R_{\\max} = 1.20\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $\\theta = \\frac{10}{11}$.\n$$R = 0.05 + \\left( 1.20 - 0.05 \\right) \\times \\frac{10}{11}$$\n$$R = 0.05 + (1.15) \\times \\frac{10}{11}$$\n$$R = 0.05 + \\frac{11.5}{11}$$\nTo perform the addition with precision, we find a common denominator:\n$$R = \\frac{0.05 \\times 11}{11} + \\frac{11.5}{11} = \\frac{0.55 + 11.5}{11} = \\frac{12.05}{11}$$\nCalculating the final value:\n$$R \\approx 1.09545454... \\, \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 1.095 \\, \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThis is the predicted steady-state IP$_3$ production rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.095}$$", "id": "2703661"}, {"introduction": "The activation of receptors often initiates enzymatic cascades that generate key sensitizing agents, such as prostaglandins synthesized by cyclooxygenase (COX).
