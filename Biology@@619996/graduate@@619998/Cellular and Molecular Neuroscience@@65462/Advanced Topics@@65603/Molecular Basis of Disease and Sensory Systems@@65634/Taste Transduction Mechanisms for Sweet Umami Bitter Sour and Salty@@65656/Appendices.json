The model describes a one-to-one binding interaction between the channel ($C$) and the blocker ($B$), consistent with a Hill coefficient of $n=1$.\n\nThe reversible binding reaction is:\n$$ C + B \\rightleftharpoons CB $$\nwhere $CB$ represents the blocked channel complex.\n\nAccording to premise (i), the Law of Mass Action applies at equilibrium.

The cell has a membrane capacitance $C_{m} = 10$ pF.

Its magnitude, $5~\\mathrm{mV/ms}$, is relatively steep on the timescale of voltage-gated sodium channel activation, which typically occurs on submillisecond to millisecond timescales once depolarization approaches threshold. If the membrane were near a resting potential approximately tens of millivolts below spike threshold (for example, a difference on the order of $20$–$30$ mV), a sustained initial slope of $5~\\mathrm{mV/ms}$ would, in the absence of immediate strong countervailing conductances, be sufficient to bring the membrane towards threshold within a few milliseconds. Concretely, a $30$ mV depolarization at $5~\\mathrm{mV/ms}$ would require approximately $6$ ms if the slope were maintained, which is well within the activation window of voltage-gated sodium channels. Therefore, the computed initial rate is consistent with a rapid approach to spike threshold in Type III cells at response onset, supporting the view that OTOP1-mediated proton entry can provide a strong depolarizing drive that initiates action potential firing, with subsequent dynamics shaped by voltage-gated sodium and potassium channel engagement and any acid-sensitive leak modulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00}$$", "id": "2760640"}, {"introduction": "Unlike salty and sour tastes, sweet, umami, and bitter modalities are detected via a complex G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) cascade, a signaling motif found throughout biology.

It does not contain contradictions, factual errors, or unverifiable claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a dynamical system that models a taste transduction pathway. The system is described by a set of $6$ coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), representing the time evolution of the concentrations or activities of key signaling molecules. The state vector is defined as $\\vec{y}(t) = [R(t), G(t), P(t), I(t), C(t), T(t)]^T$.\n\nFirst, a function implementing the ODE system $\\frac{d\\vec{y}}{dt} = f(t, \\vec{y}, \\text{params})$ is constructed, where `params` is a structure containing the ligand concentration $L$ and all rate constants and Hill parameters. The initial condition for an unstimulated cell is $\\vec{y}(0) = \\vec{0}$.\n\nTo generate the dose-response curve, $T^\\ast(L)$, we must determine the steady-state open probability of the TRPM5 channel, $T^\\ast$, for a range of ligand concentrations, $L$. The concentrations are logarithmically spaced with $N=41$ points over the interval $[10^{-6}, 10^{2}]$. For each value of $L$, the ODE system is numerically integrated over a time interval sufficiently long to ensure the system relaxes to its steady state. The final value of the state variable $T(t)$ from the integration is taken as the steady-state value $T^\\ast(L)$. The `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is suitable for this task, as it provides robust and adaptive algorithms for solving initial value problems.\n\nThe central task is to quantify the \"steepness\" or \"switch-likeness\" of the dose-response curve $L \\mapsto T^\\ast(L)$. This is accomplished by estimating an effective Hill coefficient, $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The response data $T^\\ast(L)$ is first normalized to its maximum value, yielding a fractional response $T_{\\mathrm{frac}}(L) = T^\\ast(L) / \\max_{L} T^\\ast(L)$.\n\nThe primary method for estimating $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is nonlinear least-squares fitting. The data points $(L, T_{\\mathrm{frac}}(L))$ for which $0.1 \\le T_{\\mathrm{frac}}(L) \\le 0.9$ are selected. These points are fit to the two-parameter Hill function $H(L; EC_{50}, n_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = \\frac{L^{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}{EC_{50}^{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}} + L^{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}$. The `curve_fit` function from SciPy's optimization module is used to find the optimal values for $EC_{50}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nA fallback method is specified for cases where fitting fails or is unreliable due to an insufficient number of data points in the target range. This method leverages the linear relationship that arises from a logit transformation of the Hill equation:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{frac}}}{1 - T_{\\mathrm{frac}}}\\right) = n_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\log(L) - n_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\log(EC_{50}) $$\nThis shows that a plot of $\\log(T_{\\mathrm{frac}} / (1 - T_{\\mathrm{frac}}))$ versus $\\log(L)$ is a straight line with slope $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We therefore estimate $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by computing the local slope of this transformed plot near the midpoint of the response, i.e., where $T_{\\mathrm{frac}} \\approx 0.5$.\n\nFinally, for each of the four test cases, the estimated $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is compared against the threshold $n_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.5$. If $n_{\\mathrm{eff}} > n_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the system's response is classified as ultrasensitive, and a boolean value of `True` is recorded. Otherwise, it is `False`. The entire procedure is encapsulated in a program that executes for the four specified parameter sets and outputs the list of boolean results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the taste transduction ODE model and determines ultrasensitivity\n    for four test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Model Definition ---\n    \n    def hill_function(x, K, n):\n        \"\"\"Standard Hill function.\"\"\"\n        # Add a small epsilon to prevent division by zero if x and K are 0\n        x_n = x**n\n        K_n = K**n\n        return x_n / (K_n + x_n + 1e-12)\n\n    def ode_system(t, y, params):\n        \"\"\"The system of 6 ODEs for taste transduction.\"\"\"\n        R, G, P, I, C, T = y\n        \n        # Ensure states remain non-negative\n        R, G, P, I, C, T = max(0, R), max(0, G), max(0, P), max(0, I), max(0, C), max(0, T)\n\n        # Unpack parameters\n        L = params['L']\n        k_on, k_off = params['k_on'], params['k_off']\n        k_G_act, k_G_deact = params['k_G_act'], params['k_G_deact']\n        k_P_act, k_P_deact = params['k_P_act'], params['k_P_deact']\n        v_I_prod, k_I_deg = params['v_I_prod'], params['k_I_deg']\n        v_C_rel, v_C_pump = params['v_C_rel'], params['v_C_pump']\n        tau_T = params['tau_T']\n        K_G, n_G = params['K_G'], params['n_G']\n        K_C, n_P_Ca = params['K_C'], params['n_P_Ca']\n        K_I, n_I = params['K_I'], params['n_I']\n        K_T, n_T = params['K_T'], params['n_T']\n        \n        # ODEs\n        dR_dt = k_on * L * (1.0 -
