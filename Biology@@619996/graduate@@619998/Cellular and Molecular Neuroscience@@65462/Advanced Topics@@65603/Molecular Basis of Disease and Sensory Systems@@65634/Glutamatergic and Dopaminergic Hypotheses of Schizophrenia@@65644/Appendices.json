It is based on fundamental principles of receptor pharmacology and poses a formalizable question with a clear objective. The provided data are consistent and realistic. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$. We begin with the one-to-one reversible binding of a ligand $[L]$ to a receptor $[R]$ to form a receptor-ligand complex $[RL]$. The reaction at equilibrium is represented as:\n$$\n[R] + [L] \\rightleftharpoons [RL]\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_T$, is the sum of the concentration of free (unbound) receptors, $[R]$, and the concentration of ligand-bound receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$\n[R]_T = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nFractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptor population that is occupied by the ligand:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}\n$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to solve for the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}\n$$\nWe can factor out $[RL]$ from the denominator:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left(\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1\\right)}\n$$\nAssuming that binding occurs, $[RL]$ is a non-zero quantity, and it can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$ yields the final, simplified form, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a non-cooperative system:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy.\n\nNext, we calculate the fractional occupancy for the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors using the provided values.\nThe given parameters are:\nFree ligand concentration, $[L] = 10 \\text{ nM}$.\nDissociation constant for D1 receptor, $K_{D}^{\\mathrm{D1}} = 100 \\text{ nM}$.\nDissociation constant for D2 receptor, $K_{D}^{\\mathrm{D2}} = 5 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nFor the D1 receptor, the fractional occupancy $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D1}}$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{D1}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D}^{\\mathrm{D1}} + [L]} = \\frac{10}{100 + 10} = \\frac{10}{110} = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 0.090909...\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D1}} = 0.09091$.\n\nFor the D2 receptor, the fractional occupancy $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}}$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D}^{\\mathrm{D2}} + [L]} = \\frac{10}{5 + 10} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}} = 0.6667$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret these results. The ligand demonstrates substantial selectivity for the D2 receptor over the D1 receptor at a concentration of $10$ nM. The fractional occupancy at D2 receptors is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}} \\approx 66.7\\%$, while at D1 receptors it is merely $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D1}} \\approx 9.1\\%$.\n\n1.  **Relevance to the Dopamine Hypothesis and Antipsychotic Efficacy**: The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia posits that positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) are driven by hyperactivity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, mediated primarily through D2 receptors. Clinical evidence from positron emission tomography (PET) studies indicates that a striatal D2 receptor occupancy in the range of $60\\%$ to $80\\%$ is required for an effective antipsychotic response. The calculated occupancy of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}} \\approx 66.7\\%$ falls squarely within this therapeutic window, suggesting the ligand would be effective in mitigating positive symptoms.\n\n2.  **Relevance to Side-Effect Liability**: D2 receptor occupancy exceeding approximately $80\\%$ is strongly correlated with a high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, due to excessive blockade of D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway. As the calculated occupancy is well below this threshold, the ligand is predicted to have a favorable side-effect profile with respect to motor disturbances.\n\n3.  **Relevance to the Glutamate Hypothesis and D1 Occupancy**: The NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis suggests that a primary deficit in schizophrenia is reduced glutamatergic signaling, leading to downstream dysregulation of dopamine systems. This is particularly implicated in the negative and cognitive symptoms of the disorder (e.g., flat affect, working memory deficits). D1 receptor stimulation in the prefrontal cortex is believed to be critical for proper cognitive function. The very low D1 occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{D1}} \\approx 9.1\\%$) indicates this ligand would have a negligible direct effect on D1-mediated signaling. It would neither significantly improve cognitive deficits through D1 agonism nor worsen them through antagonism. The pharmacological profile is therefore that of a \"typical\" antipsychotic, selective for D2 receptors and primarily targeting positive symptoms, with limited expected efficacy for negative or cognitive symptoms based on its direct receptor-binding profile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.09091 & 0.6667 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2714935"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the action of drugs on receptors, a central tenet of modern schizophrenia research is the idea of a hyper-responsive, or \"sensitized,\" presynaptic dopamine system.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a computation based on the provided data. Let us denote the baseline $BP_{ND}$ for controls as $B_C$ and for patients as $B_P$. Let the fractional reduction percentages for controls and patients be $p_C$ and $p_P$, respectively.\nThe given values are:\n$B_C = 2.5$\n$B_P = 2.0$\n$p_C = 5\\% = 0.05$\n$p_P = 15\\% = 0.15$\n\nFirst, we compute the $BP_{ND}$ values after the amphetamine challenge for both groups. Let these be $A_C$ for controls and $A_P$ for patients. The reduction is relative to the baseline value for each group.\n\nFor the control group, the $BP_{ND}$ after amphetamine is:\n$$A_C = B_C - p_C \\times B_C = B_C(1 - p_C)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$A_C = 2.5 \\times (1 - 0.05) = 2.5 \\times 0.95 = 2.375$$\n\nFor the patient group, the $BP_{ND}$ after amphetamine is:\n$$A_P = B_P - p_P \\times B_P = B_P(1 - p_P)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$A_P = 2.0 \\times (1 - 0.15) = 2.0 \\times 0.85 = 1.70$$\n\nNext, we are instructed to define the amphetamine-displaceable index as the absolute drop in $BP_{ND}$. Let us denote this index by $I$.\n\nFor the control group, the index $I_C$ is:\n$$I_C = B_C - A_C = B_C - B_C(1 - p_C) = B_C \\times p_C$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$I_C = 2.5 \\times 0.05 = 0.125$$\nThis is the absolute change in $BP_{ND}$ for controls, in $BP_{ND}$ units.\n\nFor the patient group, the index $I_P$ is:\n$$I_P = B_P - A_P = B_P - B_P(1 - p_P) = B_P \\times p_P$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$I_P = 2.0 \\times 0.15 = 0.30$$\nThis is the absolute change in $BP_{ND}$ for patients, in $BP_{ND}$ units.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the patient index to the control index.\n$$R = \\frac{I_P}{I_C}$$\nSubstituting the computed index values:\n$$R = \\frac{0.30}{0.125}$$\nTo express this as an exact value, we can write the decimals as fractions:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{30}{100}}{\\frac{125}{1000}} = \\frac{30}{100} \\times \\frac{1000}{125} = \\frac{30 \\times 10}{125} = \\frac{300}{125}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $25$.\n$$R = \\frac{300 \\div 25}{125 \\div 25} = \\frac{12}{5} = 2.4$$\nThe ratio $R$ is a unitless quantity.\n\nQualitative interpretation: The baseline $BP_{ND}$ is a proxy for the density of available D$2/3$ receptors, $B_{avail}$. The results show that patients have a lower baseline $BP_{ND}$ ($B_P = 2.0$) compared to controls ($B_C = 2.5$), suggesting lower receptor availability. The absolute drop in $BP_{ND}$, the index $I$, is a proxy for the amount of dopamine released by the amphetamine challenge. A larger drop signifies greater dopamine release, which leads to more competition with the radioligand and thus its greater displacement. The result $I_P = 0.30$ and $I_C = 0.125$ indicates that the amphetamine-induced dopamine release is larger in absolute terms in the patient group. The ratio $R = 2.4$ quantifies this: the amphetamine-induced dopamine response, as measured by radioligand displacement, is $2.4$ times greater in patients than in controls. This finding of an exaggerated response to a pharmacological challenge, despite lower baseline receptor availability, is a key piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis of a hyper-responsive, or sensitized, presynaptic dopaminergic system in conditions such as schizophrenia.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.4}$$", "id": "2714932"}, {"introduction": "How do molecular and circuit-level changes in the brain give rise to the complex cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions? This final practice moves into the domain of computational psychiatry to build a potential bridge from neurobiology to symptomatology. Using a reinforcement learning framework, you will model how the brain learns to assign value to cues in its environment. This exercise demonstrates how a pathologically biased dopamine-encoded prediction error signal can cause the brain to misattribute salience to otherwise neutral events, providing a powerful, mechanistic model for the emergence of delusional ideation [@problem_id:2714986].", "problem": "You are to implement a simulation of value learning for a neutral cue under a temporal-difference framework consistent with the dopamine hypothesis of prediction error in schizophrenia, with an explicit manipulation that models a constant positive bias in prediction error and an asymmetry for updating from negative prediction errors as a proxy for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) hypofunction within the glutamatergic hypothesis. The task is framed as a single-state, continuing temporal-difference learner with a single action, receiving zero true reward at every time-step. The program must compute, for several parameter settings, the asymptotic learned value of the neutral cue and a derived indicator for aberrant salience as a behavioral analog of delusional ideation.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- The temporal-difference principle that the prediction error at time-step $t$ is $r_t + \\gamma V_t - V_t$ for a single-state continuing task, where $r_t$ is the reward at time-step $t$, $\\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $V_t$ is the value estimate at time-step $t$.\n- Dopamine encodes prediction error, so a constant positive bias $b$ added to prediction error models a tonic elevation of dopaminergic signaling.\n- NMDA receptor hypofunction can be modeled as an attenuation factor $k$ applied only to negative prediction errors ($0 \\lt k \\leq 1$), leading to weaker correction when the error is negative.\n\nYour program must implement the following learning dynamics:\n- Environment: a single state with a single action.

It presents a well-defined computational modeling task grounded in established theories of computational psychiatry. The parameters, initial conditions, and update rules are specified completely and consistently.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of a temporal-difference (TD) learning simulation to model the acquisition of value for a neutral cue under conditions analogous to schizophrenia. The model incorporates a constant positive bias in dopamine-encoded prediction errors and an asymmetric update rule for negative prediction errors, representing NMDA receptor hypofunction.\n\nThe value update dynamics are defined as follows. The value estimate at time-step $t$, denoted $V_t$, is updated based on a modified prediction error.\nThe standard TD error is:\n$$ \\delta_t = r_t + \\gamma V_t - V_t $$\nGiven that the cue is neutral, the true reward is always zero, $r_t = 0$. The discount factor is $\\gamma$. Thus:\n$$ \\delta_t = (\\gamma - 1)V_t $$\nThis error is then modified by a constant bias $b$, modeling tonic dopamine elevation:\n$$ \\delta_t' = \\delta_t + b = (\\gamma - 1)V_t + b $$\nA further modification models asymmetric learning, where negative prediction errors are attenuated by a factor $k$, with $0 < k \\le 1$:\n$$ \\delta_t'' = \\begin{cases} k \\cdot \\delta_t' & \\text{if } \\delta_t' < 0 \\\\ \\delta_t' & \\text{if } \\delta_t' \\ge 0 \\end{cases} $$\nFinally, the value is updated using the learning rate $\\alpha$:\n$$ V_{t+1} = V_t + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta_t'' $$\n\nBefore proceeding to simulation, a formal analysis of the system's fixed point is necessary. The system reaches equilibrium when $V_{t+1} = V_t = V_\\infty$, which implies the update term must be zero. Since $\\alpha > 0$, this requires $\\delta_t'' = 0$.\nWe analyze the two conditions for $\\delta_t''$:\n1. If $\\delta_t' \\ge 0$, then $\\delta_t'' = \\delta_t' = (\\gamma-1)V_\\infty + b$. Setting this to zero gives $(\\gamma-1)V_\\infty + b = 0$. Since $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$, $1-\\gamma > 0$, and we find the fixed point:\n$$ V_\\infty = \\frac{b}{1 - \\gamma} $$\n2. If $\\delta_t' < 0$, then $\\delta_t'' = k \\cdot \\delta_t'$. Setting this to zero gives $k \\cdot ((\\gamma-1)V_\\infty + b) = 0$. As $k > 0$, this again requires $(\\gamma-1)V_\\infty + b = 0$, leading to the same fixed point $V_\\infty = b/(1-\\gamma)$.\n\nThe unique, stable fixed point of this dynamical system is $V_\\infty = b/(1-\\gamma)$. This theoretical asymptotic value is independent of the learning rate $\\alpha$ and the attenuation factor $k$.\n\nA critical observation must be made regarding the simulation conditions. All test cases start with an initial value of $V_0 = 0$. For any case where the bias $b > 0$, the fixed point $V_\\infty = b/(1-\\gamma)$ is positive. The learning process, therefore, involves $V_t$ monotonically increasing from $0$ towards a positive $V_\\infty$.\nThe condition for applying the attenuation factor $k$ is $\\delta_t' < 0$, which is equivalent to $(\\gamma-1)V_t + b < 0$. This can be rewritten as $V_t > b/(1-\\gamma) = V_\\infty$.\nHowever, since $V_t$ starts at $0$ and approaches $V_\\infty$ from below, the condition $V_t > V_\\infty$ is never met during the simulation. Consequently, the prediction error $\\delta_t'$ is always non-negative, and the `if $\\delta_t' < 0$` branch of the update rule is never executed. The attenuation parameter $k$, meant to model NMDA hypofunction, has no effect on the learning trajectory for the given initial conditions and positive biases. This is a crucial finding that emerges from a rigorous analysis of the specified model and parameters. The simulation results for Case 2 and Case 3 will therefore be nearly identical, despite the difference in $k$.\n\nThe computational solution involves implementing the described iterative process.\n1. Initialize the value estimate $V = 0.0$.\n2. For each time step from $t=0$ to $T-1$:\n    a. Calculate the standard TD error $\\delta_t = ( \\gamma - 1 )V$.\n    b. Calculate the biased error $\\delta_t' = \\delta_t + b$.\n    c. Based on the analysis above, for the given test cases, $\\delta_t' \\ge 0$, so the asymmetrically modified error is $\\delta_t'' = \\delta_t'$.\n    d. Update the value: $V \\leftarrow V + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta_t''$.\n3. After $T$ iterations, the final value is $V_T$.\n4.
