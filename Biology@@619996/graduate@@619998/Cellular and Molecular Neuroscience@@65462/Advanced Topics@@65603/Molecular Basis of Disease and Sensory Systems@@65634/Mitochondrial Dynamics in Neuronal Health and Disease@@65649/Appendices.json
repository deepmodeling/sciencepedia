First, we determine the ATP consumption per single action potential. Second, we use this result to find the number of mitochondria required to sustain a given firing rate.\n\nPart 1: ATP Consumption per Spike\n\nThe ATP cost of a spike is primarily due to the action of the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase, which restores the ionic gradients (specifically, the sodium gradient) that are run down by the ionic currents flowing during the action potential. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  Calculate the surface area ($A$) of the presynaptic bouton. The bouton is a sphere with diameter $d = 1.0 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The radius is $r = d/2 = 0.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We must convert units to centimeters to be consistent with the given membrane capacitance. Since $1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the radius is $r = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n    The surface area of a sphere is given by $A = 4\\pi r^{2}$.\n    $$A = 4\\pi (0.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm})^{2} = 4\\pi (0.25 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}) = \\pi \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$$\n\n2.  Calculate the total membrane capacitance ($C$) of the bouton. This is the product of the specific membrane capacitance $c_{m}$ and the surface area $A$. The value for $c_{m}$ is $1.0 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n    $$C = c_{m} A = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2})(\\pi \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}) = \\pi \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{F}$$\n\n3.  Calculate the minimal capacitive charge ($Q_{\\mathrm{cap}}$) that must be moved across the membrane to change the potential by $\\Delta V = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{cap}} = C \\Delta V = (\\pi \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{F})(0.10 \\ \\mathrm{V}) = \\pi \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\n4.  Calculate the total sodium charge entry per spike ($Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$). The problem specifies that the actual sodium load is greater than the minimal capacitive charge due to the temporal overlap of Na$^{+}$ and K$^{+}$ currents. This is accounted for by the overlap factor $\\kappa = 4.0$.\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = \\kappa Q_{\\mathrm{cap}} = 4.0 (\\pi \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{C}) = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\n5.  Convert the sodium charge $Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$ into the number of sodium ions ($N_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$). The charge of a single monovalent ion is the elementary charge $e$, which can be expressed as the ratio of the Faraday constant $F$ to Avogadro's number $N_{A}$. Thus, the number of ions is $N_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / e = Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} (N_{A} / F)$.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{C}) \\left( \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{96485 \\ \\mathrm{C} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\right) \\approx 78438.4 \\ \\text{ions}$$\n\n6.  Calculate the number of ATP molecules consumed per spike ($N_{\\mathrm{ATP/spike}}$). The Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase extrudes $3$ Na$^{+}$ ions for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. Therefore, the number of ATP molecules required to extrude $N_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$ ions is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{ATP/spike}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}}{3} \\approx \\frac{78438.4}{3} \\approx 26146.1 \\ \\text{molecules}$$\n    The problem requires this result as a whole number rounded to three significant figures.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{ATP/spike}} \\approx 2.61 \\times 10^{4} = 26100 \\ \\text{molecules per spike}$$\n\nPart 2: Minimum Number of Mitochondria\n\nNow we determine the mitochondrial requirement for a sustained spike train.\n\n1.  Calculate the total ATP consumption rate ($R_{\\mathrm{ATP,cons}}$) for a spike train with frequency $f = 20 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    $$R_{\\mathrm{ATP,cons}} = N_{\\mathrm{ATP/spike}} \\times f = (26146.1 \\ \\text{ATP/spike}) \\times (20 \\ \\text{spikes/s}) \\approx 522922 \\ \\text{ATP/s}$$\n\n2.  Determine the minimum integer number of mitochondria ($N_{\\mathrm{mito}}$) required. The total ATP production rate from $N_{\\mathrm{mito}}$ mitochondria must be at least equal to the consumption rate to prevent ATP depletion. The production rate per mitochondrion is given as $R_{\\mathrm{ATP,mito}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{ATP/s}$.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{mito}} \\times R_{\\mathrm{ATP,mito}} \\ge R_{\\mathrm{ATP,cons}}$$\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{mito}} \\ge \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ATP,cons}}}{R_{\\mathrm{ATP,mito}}} \\ge \\frac{522922 \\ \\text{ATP/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{ATP/s}} \\ge 0.522922$$\n    Since mitochondria are discrete organelles, the number of mitochondria must be an integer. The smallest integer satisfying this condition is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{mito}} = \\lceil 0.522922 \\rceil = 1$$\n\nThe final answer is composed of the ATP molecules per spike and the minimum number of mitochondria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 26100 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2726767"}, {"introduction": "Having established the critical need for mitochondria at presynaptic sites, we now address how they are distributed along the vast lengths of an axon.

Researchers often rely on pharmacological inhibitors to probe these pathways, but such tools can have unintended off-target effects.

Mdivi-1 was originally described as a Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) inhibitor, yet multiple reports suggest significant off-target actions.\n\nStarting from the following foundational base:\n- Mitochondrial morphology reflects the balance between fusion (mediated by Mitofusin $1$/$2$ and Optic atrophy $1$) and fission (mediated by DRP1, a large guanosine triphosphatase), and changes in bioenergetic state (electron transport chain flux, $\\Delta \\psi_m$, and ROS) can secondarily alter fission-fusion dynamics.\n- Demonstrating pharmacologic target specificity in cells requires orthogonal validation: genetic epistasis (target deletion or inactivation should occlude drug effects), independent on-target pharmacology (different chemotypes or biologics that engage the same target but not the same off-targets should phenocopy the cellular outcome), and off-target triangulation (matching downstream biophysical changes with drugs that engage the suspected off-target).\n- If a drug’s cellular phenotype persists when the target is removed, or if the phenotype is better recapitulated by perturbations of a different pathway that reproduce the same bioenergetic state, the simplest explanation is off-target action.\n\nWhich experimental design and interpretive logic would most convincingly demonstrate that Mdivi-1 is not a specific DRP1 inhibitor in neurons, and provide appropriate pharmacologic and genetic controls to interpret drug-induced changes in mitochondrial morphology?\n\nA. Perform CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of DRP1 in neurons and quantify mitochondrial morphology, OCR, $\\Delta \\psi_m$, and ROS with and without Mdivi-1. In wild-type neurons, compare Mdivi-1 to a peptide that selectively blocks the DRP1–Fission $1$ (Fis$1$) interaction (for example, P110) at concentrations that spare OCR, and to a Complex I inhibitor (for example, rotenone) titrated to match the Mdivi-1–induced OCR decrease. Include an antioxidant control (for example, N-acetylcysteine) titrated to match the Mdivi-1–induced ROS decrease. Conclude lack of DRP1 specificity if: in DRP1 knockout cells Mdivi-1 still depresses OCR and shifts morphology similarly to rotenone or N-acetylcysteine; in wild-type cells P110 elongates mitochondria without lowering OCR or $\\Delta \\psi_m$, whereas rotenone or N-acetylcysteine recapitulate Mdivi-1’s bioenergetic and morphological signatures.\n\nB.

A convincing experimental design must adhere to the principles laid out in the foundational base.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis option proposes a multi-pronged approach that systematically implements the principles of target validation.\n1.  **Genetic Epistasis**: The proposal to use CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of DRP1 is the gold standard for testing genetic epistasis. If Mdivi-1 still causes its characteristic effects (especially the depression of OCR and $\\Delta \\psi_m$) in neurons lacking DRP1, it irrefutably demonstrates that these effects are DRP1-independent.\n2.  **Orthogonal Pharmacology**: Comparing Mdivi-1 to a different DRP1 inhibitor, the peptide P110, addresses this principle. P110 has a different chemical structure and mechanism, blocking the DRP1-Fis$1$ interaction. Showing that P110 causes mitochondrial elongation *without* compromising OCR would establish the clean on-target phenotype, contrasting it with the \"dirty\" phenotype of Mdivi-1.\n3.  **Off-target Triangulation**: The observation of decreased OCR and $\\Delta \\psi_m$ suggests an off-target effect on the electron transport chain (ETC). Using rotenone, a known Complex I inhibitor, and titrating it to match the Mdivi-1-induced OCR drop is a direct test of this off-target hypothesis. If rotenone recapitulates not only the bioenergetic defects but also the morphological and ROS changes caused by Mdivi-1, it provides strong evidence that Mdivi-1's primary action in this context is through Complex I inhibition.\n4.  **Additional Control**: The use of an antioxidant like N-acetylcysteine to match the ROS decrease serves to dissect whether the observed changes are a primary result of redox state modulation, independent of direct ETC or DRP1 inhibition.\nThe logical framework for concluding a lack of specificity is impeccable and directly follows from the experimental outcomes. This design is comprehensive and rigorous.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It proposes to conclude DRP1 inhibition based solely on observing mitochondrial elongation. This commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent; it ignores the foundational principle that morphological changes can be a secondary consequence of bioenergetic stress. The comparison to overexpression of a fluorescent protein is not a valid control for drug specificity. Testing for reversibility proves nothing about the drug's target, only about the nature of its binding or cellular clearance. This experiment is naive and would lead to an unsubstantiated conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option proposes using dynasore as a control. Dynasore is a known inhibitor of the large GTPase dynamin, which is involved in endocytosis, and it only inhibits DRP1, another large GTPase, at high concentrations with significant off-target effects. Using one non-specific inhibitor to validate another is poor experimental design. If both drugs cause the same effect, it could easily be due to a shared off-target mechanism, not a shared on-target one. This approach lacks scientific rigor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis option proposes a genetic occlusion experiment using a dominant-negative DRP1 mutant (DRP1-$\\mathrm{K}38\\mathrm{A}$). While this is a valid technique to inhibit the DRP1 pathway, the interpretation is flawed. The conclusion relies on observing that Mdivi-1 fails to further elongate mitochondria that are already elongated by the dominant-negative mutant. This result could be a \"ceiling effect\": if the mitochondria are already maximally elongated, no further change can be detected, regardless of whether Mdivi-1 acts on DRP1 or on an off-target. More importantly, this experiment completely ignores the bioenergetic effects (decreased OCR, $\\Delta \\psi_m$, ROS), which are the primary indicators of a potential off-target action. An occlusion experiment on a single, potentially saturated parameter is insufficient to prove specificity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that presents a comprehensive, logically sound, and multi-faceted experimental plan consistent with the established principles of pharmacological target validation. It correctly combines genetic, pharmacological, and bioenergetic approaches to dissect the complex cellular phenotype induced by Mdivi-1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2726806"}]}
