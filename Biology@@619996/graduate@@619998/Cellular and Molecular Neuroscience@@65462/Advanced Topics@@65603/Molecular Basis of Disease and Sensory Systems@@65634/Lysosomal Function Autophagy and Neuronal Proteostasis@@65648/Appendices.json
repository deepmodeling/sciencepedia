The governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are provided.\n\nFirst, we estimate the lipidation rate $v_{\\mathrm{lip}}$. In the presence of Bafilomycin A1, lysosomal degradation is blocked. The dynamics of the LC3-II amount, $L_{+}(t)$, are described by the simplified ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_{+}}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{lip}}\n$$\nAssuming $v_{\\mathrm{lip}}$ is a constant, integration with respect to time $t$ yields a linear relationship:\n$$\nL_{+}(t) = L_{+}(0) + v_{\\mathrm{lip}} t\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $y = c + mx$, where $y = L_{+}(t)$, $x = t$, the intercept is $c = L_{+}(0)$, and the slope is $m = v_{\\mathrm{lip}}$.

The \"steady state\" assumption implies that this flux calculation is valid.\n$$ R(P) = J_{\\text{form}}(P) \\times P_{\\text{fusion}}(P) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_{\\text{form}}(P)$ and $P_{\\text{fusion}}(P)$:\n$$ R(P) = \\left( r_{\\text{enc}} f_{\\text{Rab7}} p_{\\text{tether}}(P) \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{fusion}}}{k_{\\text{fusion}} + k_{\\text{off}}(P)} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the specific functional forms for $p_{\\text{tether}}(P)$ and $k_{\\text{off}}(P)$:\n$$ R(P) = r_{\\text{enc}} f_{\\text{Rab7}} \\left( p_{\\max} \\frac{P}{K_d + P} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{fusion}}}{k_{\\text{fusion}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{off},0}}{1 + \\beta P}} \\right) $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change $\\frac{R(0.5)}{R(1)}$. We form the ratio of $R(P)$ evaluated at $P=0.5$ and $P=1$. The constant pre-factor $r_{\\text{enc}} f_{\\text{Rab7}} p_{\\max} k_{\\text{fusion}}$ will cancel out.\n$$ \\frac{R(0.5)}{R(1)} = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{0.5}{K_d + 0.5} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{fusion}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{off},0}}{1 + 0.5\\beta}} \\right) }{ \\left( \\frac{1}{K_d + 1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{fusion}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{off},0}}{1 + \\beta}} \\right) } $$\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\frac{R(0.5)}{R(1)} = \\left( \\frac{0.5(K_d + 1)}{K_d + 0.5} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{fusion}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{off},0}}{1 + \\beta}}{k_{\\text{fusion}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{off},0}}{1 + 0.5\\beta}} \\right) $$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $K_d = 0.25$, $k_{\\text{fusion}} = 4$, $k_{\\text{off},0} = 8$, and $\\beta = 1$.\n\nThe first term, related to tethering probability, evaluates to:\n$$ \\frac{0.5(0.25 + 1)}{0.25 + 0.5} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 1.25}{0.75} = \\frac{0.625}{0.75} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nThe second term, related to the fusion probability, evaluates to:\n$$ \\frac{4 + \\frac{8}{1 + 1}}{4 + \\frac{8}{1 + 0.5 \\times 1}} = \\frac{4 + \\frac{8}{2}}{4 + \\frac{8}{1.5}} = \\frac{4 + 4}{4 + \\frac{16}{3}} = \\frac{8}{\\frac{12}{3} + \\frac{16}{3}} = \\frac{8}{\\frac{28}{3}} = \\frac{24}{28} = \\frac{6}{7} $$\n\nThe final fold-change is the product of these two terms:\n$$ \\frac{R(0.5)}{R(1)} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$ \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.7143$.
