By analyzing hypothetical electrophysiological and immunolabeling data, you will apply fundamental biophysical principles to distinguish between two potential mechanisms of synaptic weakening: a loss of synaptic receptors versus a change in their intrinsic function.", "problem": "A core hallmark of synaptic pathology implicated in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is altered excitatory synaptic strength mediated by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is a scaffold that stabilizes AMPARs at synapses; PSD-95 mutations and reduced expression have been associated with ASD. Consider whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons in a mouse model in which PSD-95 is knocked down by short hairpin RNA. Under conditions that isolate AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), the membrane is voltage clamped at $V=-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and the liquid junction potential and series resistance are corrected. The AMPAR reversal potential is measured as $E_{\\text{rev}}=0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The mean peak AMPAR-EPSC (signed inward current) before knockdown is $I_{\\text{pre}}=-175\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, and after knockdown is $I_{\\text{post}}=-105\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. In parallel, immunolabeling of the GluA1 (glutamate receptor subunit A1) surface pool per synapse yields mean values of $1200$ arbitrary units (a.u.) before and $720$ a.u. after knockdown.\n\nUse only the following well-established bases: (i) under voltage clamp, the synaptic current carried by a receptor population with effective synaptic conductance $g_{\\text{syn}}$ and reversal potential $E_{\\text{rev}}$ follows $I=g_{\\text{syn}}\\,(V-E_{\\text{rev}})$; and (ii) at the microscopic level, $g_{\\text{syn}}=N\\,p_{o}\\,\\gamma$, where $N$ is the number of functional receptors, $p_{o}$ is the peak open probability during the EPSC, and $\\gamma$ is the single-channel conductance.\n\nCompute the fold-change in synaptic conductance $g_{\\text{syn}}$ after PSD-95 knockdown relative to baseline, that is, compute the ratio $g_{\\text{post}}/g_{\\text{pre}}$, and use the GluA1 surface labeling change to infer whether the dominant effect of PSD-95 knockdown is a change in receptor anchoring ($N$) versus a change in channel biophysics ($p_{o}$ or $\\gamma$).

The experimental parameters are realistic for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of AMPAR-mediated currents. The provided models are fundamental principles of ion channel biophysics. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. The synaptic conductance, $g_{\\text{syn}}$, can be calculated by rearranging the macroscopic current equation:\n$$g_{\\text{syn}} = \\frac{I}{V - E_{\\text{rev}}}$$\nWe can compute the synaptic conductance before ($g_{\\text{pre}}$) and after ($g_{\\text{post}}$) the PSD-95 knockdown.\n\nFor the pre-knockdown (baseline) condition:\n$I_{\\text{pre}} = -175\\,\\mathrm{pA} = -175 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$E_{\\text{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$$g_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{-175 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{175}{70} \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\n\nFor the post-knockdown condition:\n$I_{\\text{post}} = -105\\,\\mathrm{pA} = -105 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$$g_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{-105 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{105}{70} \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\n\nThe primary quantity to be computed is the fold-change in synaptic conductance, which is the ratio $g_{\\text{post}}/g_{\\text{pre}}$. This can be calculated from the conductances directly, or more simply from the ratio of the currents, since the voltage terms cancel:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\text{post}}}{g_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{post}} / (V - E_{\\text{rev}})}{I_{\\text{pre}} / (V - E_{\\text{rev}})} = \\frac{I_{\\text{post}}}{I_{\\text{pre}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\text{post}}}{g_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{-105\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{-175\\,\\mathrm{pA}} = \\frac{105}{175} = \\frac{3 \\times 35}{5 \\times 35} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requests this value rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.6000$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to infer the dominant mechanism for this change. We use the microscopic model for conductance, $g_{\\text{syn}} = N p_o \\gamma$, where $N$ is the number of synaptic receptors, $p_o$ is their open probability, and $\\gamma$ is the single-channel conductance. The ratio of conductances is thus:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\text{post}}}{g_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{post}} p_{o, \\text{post}} \\gamma_{\\text{post}}}{N_{\\text{pre}} p_{o, \\text{pre}} \\gamma_{\\text{pre}}} = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{post}}}{N_{\\text{pre}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p_{o, \\text{post}}}{p_{o, \\text{pre}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{post}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{pre}}}\\right)$$\nThe term $(N_{\\text{post}}/N_{\\text{pre}})$ represents the change in receptor number, while the product of the other two terms represents the change in channel biophysics (gating and permeation).\n\nThe immunolabeling data for the GluA1 subunit provides a proxy for the number of surface AMPA receptors, $N$. We assume that the signal is proportional to the number of receptors, $S \\propto N$. Therefore, the ratio of receptor numbers can be approximated by the ratio of immunolabeling signals:\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{post}}}{N_{\\text{pre}}} \\approx \\frac{S_{\\text{post}}}{S_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{720\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}}{1200\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}} = \\frac{72}{120} = \\frac{6 \\times 12}{10 \\times 12} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$$\nWe observe that the fold-change in synaptic conductance is equal to the fold-change in the surface receptor pool proxy:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\text{post}}}{g_{\\text{pre}}} = 0.6 \\approx \\frac{N_{\\text{post}}}{N_{\\text{pre}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the microscopic equation:\n$$0.6 \\approx (0.6) \\times \\left(\\frac{p_{o, \\text{post}}}{p_{o, \\text{pre}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{post}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{pre}}}\\right)$$\nThis implies that the term representing changes in channel biophysics is approximately unity:\n$$\\left(\\frac{p_{o, \\text{post}}}{p_{o, \\text{pre}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{post}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{pre}}}\\right) \\approx 1$$\nThis result strongly suggests that the biophysical properties of individual AMPA receptors ($p_o$ and $\\gamma$) are not significantly altered by the PSD-95 knockdown. The reduction in synaptic strength is almost entirely attributable to a decrease in the number of functional receptors, $N$, at the synapse. This is consistent with the established role of PSD-95 as a scaffolding protein that anchors and stabilizes receptors in the postsynaptic membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6000}$$", "id": "2756768"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the receptors themselves, the physical microdomain of the synapse—the dendritic spine—plays a critical role in shaping neuronal signaling.

Consider an excitatory cortical synapse where a single synaptic event produces a transient influx of calcium ions through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Assume that on the timescale of the rising phase of the calcium transient, diffusion out of the spine head and extrusion are negligible, the spine head is well-mixed, and the endogenous buffer capacity remains unchanged between conditions.

Express your final answer in nanomolar and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded and well-posed. It requires the application of first principles, specifically the conservation of matter and the definition of concentration, to a simplified but standard model of synaptic calcium signaling. The assumptions provided—that the spine head is a well-mixed compartment, diffusion and extrusion are negligible on the relevant timescale, and calcium influx and buffer capacity are unchanged—are standard idealizations that render the problem solvable. We may proceed.\n\nLet us define the initial state, or control condition, with subscript $0$, and the altered state, the ASD-model neuron, with subscript $1$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship is the definition of concentration, $C$, which is the amount of substance (in moles), $n$, dissolved in a given volume, $V$:\n$$C = \\frac{n}{V}$$\n\nThe problem concerns the increment in calcium concentration, $\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]$, resulting from a synaptic event. The total number of calcium ions entering the spine head is given to be the same in both conditions. Let the number of moles of $Ca^{2+}$ ions entering be $n_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}$. This quantity is a constant.\n\nThe change in the *total* concentration of calcium, $\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{total}}$, is the amount of added calcium, $n_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}$, divided by the volume of the spine head, $V$.\n\nFor the control condition:\n$$\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{total}, 0} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}}{V_0}$$\n\nFor the ASD-model condition, the volume of the spine head is doubled.

We must relate the change in total calcium to the change in free calcium. The total calcium in the cytosol is partitioned into free ions, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}$, and ions bound to endogenous buffers, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{buffered}}$.\n\nTherefore, the change in total calcium concentration is the sum of the changes in the free and buffered concentrations:\n$$\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}} + \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{buffered}}$$\n\nFor small changes in calcium, the relationship between buffered and free calcium can be described by the endogenous buffer capacity, $\\kappa_B$, defined as:\n$$\\kappa_B = \\frac{\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{buffered}}}{\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}}$$\nThis allows us to write $\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{buffered}} = \\kappa_B \\cdot \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the total concentration change:\n$$\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}} + \\kappa_B \\cdot \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}} = (1 + \\kappa_B) \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the endogenous buffer capacity, $\\kappa_B$, is unchanged between the control and ASD-model conditions.
