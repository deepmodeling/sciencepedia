The half-time for monomer consumption in the unseeded control is $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{unseeded}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{h}$. This relatively long timescale reflects a process limited by a slow primary nucleation step, which is required to generate the initial fibrils that can subsequently elongate. In the seeded experiment, the half-time is drastically reduced to $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{seeded}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$. This acceleration, by a factor of $\\frac{20}{1.5} \\approx 13.3$, demonstrates that the introduction of seeds ($P_{0}$) provides a far more efficient pathway for monomer consumption than the de novo nucleation pathway. The elongation from pre-existing ends becomes the dominant kinetic process. Therefore, it is appropriate to neglect the contribution of primary nucleation to monomer consumption in the seeded reaction over the timescale of the experiment.\n\nNow, we proceed with the calculation based solely on the seeded condition. Let $k_{+}$ be the second-order rate constant for the addition of a monomer molecule to a single fibril end. The problem states that each polymer has $2$ growth-competent ends. The total concentration of active ends in the seeded experiment is $2P(t)$. Given the assumption that $P(t) \\approx P_{0}$ (negligible nucleation and fragmentation), the concentration of ends is constant and equal to $2P_{0}$.\n\nAccording to mass-action kinetics, the rate of monomer consumption is proportional to the concentration of monomer, $m(t)$, and the concentration of active ends. The differential equation for the monomer concentration is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = -k_{+} \\cdot m(t) \\cdot (2P_{0})\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

Algorithm for Parameter Estimation**\n\nGiven a dataset of $n$ pairs of observed tract lengths and onset times, $\\{(\\ell_i, t_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, along with known constants $A_0$ and $A_\\theta$, we can estimate the physical parameters $v$ and $k_r$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n- **Step 1: Estimate slope ($s$) and intercept ($c$).**\nWe fit the linear model $t_i = s\\,\\ell_i + c$ to the data using the method of ordinary least squares (OLS). This involves finding the values of $s$ and $c$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals, $SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^n (t_i - (s\\,\\ell_i + c))^2$.\nThe standard analytical solutions for OLS are:\n$$s = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell_i t_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell_i)^2}$$\n$$c = \\bar{t} - s\\bar{\\ell}$$\nwhere $\\bar{t} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i$ and $\\bar{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell_i$. In practice, these estimates are obtained using standard numerical libraries.\n\n- **Step 2: Recover physical parameters ($v$ and $k_r$).**\nOnce the statistical parameters $s$ and $c$ have been estimated, we invert the relations derived in the previous section to find the physical parameters.\n\nFrom $s = \\frac{1}{v}$, the effective transport velocity $v$ is:\n$$v = \\frac{1}{s}$$\nThe units are consistent: if $s$ is in $\\text{week}/\\text{mm}$, then $v$ is in $\\text{mm}/\\text{week}$.\n\nFrom $c = \\frac{1}{k_r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_\\theta}{A_0}\\right)$, the effective replication rate constant $k_r$ is:\n$$k_r = \\frac{1}{c} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_\\theta}{A_0}\\right)$$\nThe units are consistent: if $c$ is in $\\text{weeks}$, and the logarithm is dimensionless, then $k_r$ is in $\\text{week}^{-1}$.\n\nThis completes the design of the algorithm. It is robust provided that $s \\neq 0$ and $c \\neq 0$. Given the physical nature of the problem, where pathology propagates over time, we expect $s > 0$ and $c > 0$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the effective transport velocity (v) and replication rate (k_r)\n    for a series of test cases based on a linearized model of prion-like propagation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"l\": np.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0]),\n            \"t\": np.array([17.8095238095, 18.4761904762, 19.8095238095, 21.1428571429]),\n            \"A0\": 1.0,\n            \"A_theta\": 162754.79141900392\n        },\n        {\n            \"l\": np.array([0.0, 3.0, 10.0]),\n            \"t\": np.array([7.5, 9.0, 12.5]),\n            \"A0\": 1.0,\n            \"A_theta\": 8103.083927575384\n        },\n        {\n            \"l\": np.array([2.5, 5.0, 12.5]),\n            \"t\": np.array([25.125, 28.25, 37.625]),\n            \"A0\": 1.0,\n            \"A_theta\": 59874.14171519782\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        ell = case[\"l\"]\n        t_onset = case[\"t\"]\n        A0 = case[\"A0\"]\n        A_theta = case[\"A_theta\"]\n\n        # Step 1: Estimate slope (s) and intercept (c) using OLS.\n        # np.polyfit with deg=1 performs a linear least-squares fit.\n        # It returns coefficients [slope, intercept].\n        s, c = np.polyfit(ell, t_onset, 1)\n\n        # Step 2: Recover physical parameters v and k_r from s and c.\n        \n        # Velocity v is the reciprocal of the slope s.\n        # s is in week/mm, so v is in mm/week.\n        v = 1.0 / s\n\n        # Replication rate k_r is derived from the intercept c.\n        # c is in weeks, log term is dimensionless, so k_r is in week^-1.\n        # np.log is the natural logarithm.\n        k_r = np.log(A_theta / A0) / c\n        \n        # Round the final values to three decimal places as required.\n        v_rounded = round(v, 3)\n        k_r_rounded = round(k_r, 3)\n\n        results.append([v_rounded, k_r_rounded])\n\n    # Final print statement must produce a single line in the exact specified format.\n    # The str() representation of a list of lists is '[[...], [...]]',\n    # so we remove spaces to match the required format \"[[...],[...]]\".\n    print(str(results).replace(\" \", \"\"))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2740804"}]}
