We shall proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nLet $u(t)$ represent the concentration of unphosphorylated tau and $p(t)$ represent the concentration of phosphorylated tau at time $t$. The problem states that the total concentration of tau, $T$, is constant, as synthesis and degradation are negligible. This gives us the conservation law:\n$$u(t) + p(t) = T$$\nfor all $t$.\n\nThe system involves two opposing reactions: phosphorylation of unphosphorylated tau, catalyzed by Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3$\\beta$ (GSK3$\\beta$), and dephosphorylation of phosphorylated tau, catalyzed by Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The reactions can be summarized by the following scheme:\n$$u \\xrightarrow{k_{p}} p$$\n$$p \\xrightarrow{k_{d}} u$$\nHere, $k_{p}$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for phosphorylation and $k_{d}$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for dephosphorylation. The term \"pseudo-first-order\" implies that the reaction rates are directly proportional to the concentration of the substrate (tau in its respective form), as the enzyme concentrations are assumed to be constant.\n\nBased on this kinetic scheme, we can write the rate equation for the concentration of phosphorylated tau, $p(t)$, by applying the law of mass action:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of } p) - (\\text{rate of consumption of } p)$$\n$$\\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{p}u(t) - k_{d}p(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation describing the dynamics of tau phosphorylation.\n\nTo find the steady-state fraction of phosphorylated tau, we must first find the steady-state concentrations. The steady state is defined as the condition where the net rate of change of all concentrations is zero. Therefore, we set $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$:\n$$k_{p}u_{ss} - k_{d}p_{ss} = 0$$\nwhere $u_{ss}$ and $p_{ss}$ are the steady-state concentrations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated tau, respectively. This equation shows that at steady state, the rate of phosphorylation equals the rate of dephosphorylation:\n$$k_{p}u_{ss} = k_{d}p_{ss}$$\n\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations for the two unknown steady-state concentrations, $u_{ss}$ and $p_{ss}$:\n1. $u_{ss} + p_{ss} = T$ (Conservation)\n2. $k_{p}u_{ss} = k_{d}p_{ss}$ (Steady-state condition)\n\nFrom the conservation equation, we express $u_{ss}$ in terms of $p_{ss}$: $u_{ss} = T - p_{ss}$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$k_{p}(T - p_{ss}) = k_{d}p_{ss}$$\nWe solve this equation for $p_{ss}$:\n$$k_{p}T - k_{p}p_{ss} = k_{d}p_{ss}$$\n$$k_{p}T = (k_{p} + k_{d})p_{ss}$$\n$$p_{ss} = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{d}} T$$\n\nThe steady-state fraction of phosphorylated tau, which we denote as $f_{p}$, is the ratio of the steady-state concentration of phosphorylated tau to the total tau concentration:\n$$f_{p} = \\frac{p_{ss}}{T} = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{d}}$$\nThis is the general solution for the steady-state fraction under normal conditions.\n\nNow, we consider the pathological scenario described, where the activity of PP2A is reduced by a factor of $0.5$. This means the effective dephosphorylation rate constant is modified. Let the new rate constant be $k'_{d}$. According to the problem, $k'_{d} = 0.5 k_{d}$. The phosphorylation rate constant $k_{p}$ remains unchanged.\n\nTo find the new steady-state fraction of phosphorylated tau, denoted $f'_{p}$, we use the same derived formula but substitute $k_{d}$ with the new value $k'_{d}$:\n$$f'_{p} = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k'_{d}}$$\nSubstituting $k'_{d} = 0.5 k_{d}$:\n$$f'_{p} = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + 0.5 k_{d}}$$\nTo present this expression in a simplified analytical form, we can write the decimal $0.5$ as the fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$f'_{p} = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + \\frac{1}{2} k_{d}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and the denominator by $2$ to clear the fraction in the denominator yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$f'_{p} = \\frac{2k_{p}}{2k_{p} + k_{d}}$$\nThis is the steady-state fraction of phosphorylated tau under the condition of reduced phosphatase activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2k_p}{2k_p + k_d}}$$", "id": "2730069"}, {"introduction": "The primary physiological role of Tau is to bind and stabilize microtubules, a function critically dependent on its microtubule-binding repeat domains.

The Thal phase is determined by the deepest anatomical region exhibiting Aβ plaque deposition. A region is considered \"involved\" if its Aβ plaque density is $\\geq 1$ plaque per $\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. The provided densities are:\n- Neocortex: $65 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Hippocampus: $40 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Striatum: $8 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Midbrain: $4 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Cerebellum: $0.2 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n\nComparing these to the threshold of $1$, we find the following regions are involved: Neocortex ($65 \\geq 1$), Hippocampus ($40 \\geq 1$), Striatum ($8 \\geq 1$), and Midbrain ($4 \\geq 1$). The cerebellum is not involved ($0.2 < 1$). The hierarchy of regions for phasing is: Neocortex (phase $1$), Allocortex/Hippocampus (phase $2$), Striatum (phase $3$), Midbrain (phase $4$), and Cerebellum (phase $5$). The deepest, or highest-numbered, region involved is the Midbrain. This corresponds to a Thal phase of $4$. According to the problem's definition for the A-score, a Thal phase in the set $\\{4, 5\\}$ corresponds to an A-score of A$3$. Thus, the numerical value is $A=3$.\n\nSecond, we determine the B-score, which is derived from the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) Braak stage. A region is considered \"involved\" if its NFT density is $\\geq 2$ tangles per $\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. The provided NFT densities are:\n- Transentorhinal cortex: $12 \\, \\mathrm{tangles/mm}^2$\n- Hippocampus (CA$1$): $18 \\, \\mathrm{tangles/mm}^2$\n- Association neocortex (temporal): $7 \\, \\mathrm{tangles/mm}^2$\n- Association neocortex (parietal): $5 \\, \\mathrm{tangles/mm}^2$\n\nAll listed regions show densities above the threshold of $2$. The Braak staging is hierarchical. Stage $I$–$II$ requires involvement restricted to the transentorhinal cortex. Stage $III$–$IV$ requires extension to limbic regions (like the hippocampus) but no involvement of the association neocortex. Stage $V$–$VI$ is defined by the involvement of the association neocortex. Since both temporal and parietal association neocortical areas are involved (densities of $7$ and $5$, respectively), the case qualifies for Braak stage $V$–$VI$. According to the B-score definition, a Braak stage of $V$–$VI$ corresponds to a B-score of B$3$. Thus, the numerical value is $B=3$.\n\nThird, we determine the C-score, which is based on the maximum neuritic plaque density in any sampled neocortical field. The given densities are:\n- Middle frontal gyrus: $16 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Superior temporal gyrus: $22 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Inferior parietal lobule: $14 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n- Occipital cortex: $9 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$\n\nThe maximum of these values is $22 \\, \\mathrm{plaques/mm}^2$. The C-score is defined by the following density ranges: C$0$ for a density of $0$; C$1$ for $1$–$6$; C$2$ for $7$–$20$; and C$3$ for $>20$. Since the maximum density is $22$, which is greater than $20$, the score is C$3$. Thus, the numerical value is $C=3$.\n\nFinally, we compute the ADNC level code $L$ using the derived scores $A=3$, $B=3$, and $C=3$. We apply the given hierarchical rule set:\n$1$. If $A=0$ or $B=0$ or $C=0$, then $L=0$. This condition is false, as $A=3$, $B=3$, and $C=3$.\n$2$. Else if $\\min(A,B)=1$ and $C\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, or $\\min(A,B)=2$ and $C=1$, then $L=1$.
