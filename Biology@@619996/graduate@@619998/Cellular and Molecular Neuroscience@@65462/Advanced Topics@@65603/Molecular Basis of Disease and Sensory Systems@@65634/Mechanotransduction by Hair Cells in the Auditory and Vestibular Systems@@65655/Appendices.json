The provided ionic concentrations and electrical potentials are consistent with published experimental data for the mammalian inner ear. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants and conditions to derive a unique, meaningful solution. It is stated objectively and without ambiguity. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution proceeds.\n\nThe electrochemical driving force is derived from the concept of electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species $i$ is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\mu_i^0 + RT \\ln(a_i) + z_i F V\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_i^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_i$ is the ionic activity (approximated here by molar concentration $[C_i]$), $z_i$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential of the compartment.\n\nThe change in electrochemical potential, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i$, for an ion moving from the outside (endolymph) to the inside (cytosol) is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\tilde{\\mu}_{i, \\text{in}} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{i, \\text{out}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\left( RT \\ln([C_i]_{\\text{in}}) + z_i F V_{\\text{in}} \\right) - \\left( RT \\ln([C_i]_{\\text{out}}) + z_i F V_{\\text{out}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[C_i]_{\\text{in}}}{[C_i]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) + z_i F (V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}})\n$$\nThis quantity represents the work done to move one mole of ions from outside to inside. The process is spontaneous if $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i < 0$. The driving force is conventionally expressed as an equivalent voltage, $V_{\\text{DF}}$, which is the deviation of the membrane potential from the ion's equilibrium potential.\n\nAt equilibrium, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i = 0$, and the transmembrane potential $(V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}})$ is equal to the Nernst potential, $E_i$:\n$$\nE_i = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}\\Big|_{\\text{eq}} = -\\frac{RT}{z_i F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[C_i]_{\\text{in}}}{[C_i]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) = \\frac{RT}{z_i F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[C_i]_{\\text{out}}}{[C_i]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe electrochemical driving force as a voltage, $V_{\\text{DF}}$, is defined such that the net flow of charge is proportional to it. It can be found by dividing $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i$ by the charge per mole, $z_i F$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{DF}, i} = \\frac{\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_i}{z_i F} = \\frac{RT}{z_i F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[C_i]_{\\text{in}}}{[C_i]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) + (V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}})\n$$\nRecognizing the definitions of the Nernst potential $E_i$ and the membrane potential $V_m = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}$, this expression simplifies to:\n$$\nV_{\\text{DF}, i} = V_m - E_i\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the electrochemical driving force as an equivalent voltage. A negative $V_{\\text{DF}}$ for a cation ($z > 0$) indicates that its electrochemical potential is lower inside the cell, favoring inward flux, consistent with the problem's sign convention.\n\nFirst, we must determine the transmembrane potential, $V_m$, across the apical membrane where the MET channels are located. This potential is the difference between the intracellular potential and the endolymphatic potential, $V_m = V_{\\text{intra}} - V_{\\text{endo}}$. Using the provided potentials relative to the perilymph ($V_{\\text{peri}}$):\n$$\nV_m = (V_{\\text{intra}} - V_{\\text{peri}}) - (V_{\\text{endo}} - V_{\\text{peri}})\n$$\n$$\nV_m = (-45\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (+80\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -125\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the thermodynamic pre-factor at the given temperature, $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\n\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.026712\\,\\mathrm{V} = 26.712\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the driving force for each ion.\n\n**For Potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$):**\nThe valence is $z_{\\mathrm{K}} = +1$.

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. The problem is deemed valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to determine the unitary (single-channel) current, which I shall denote as $i$. The relationship between current, conductance, and voltage for a single ohmic channel is given by the fundamental definition of conductance, which is a form of Ohm's Law:\n$$i = g \\cdot (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nwhere $g$ is the single-channel conductance and $(V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ is the electrochemical driving force.

This is a direct consequence of the law of large numbers applied to a population of two-state (open/closed) systems. The problem states that the measurement of $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ occurs at a moment when the open probability is $P_{\\mathrm{open}} = 0.60$.\nThus, the relationship is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = N_{\\mathrm{total}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{open}} \\cdot i$$\nWe need to solve for $N_{\\mathrm{total}}$. Rearranging the equation:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{P_{\\mathrm{open}} \\cdot i}$$\nThe given macroscopic peak current is $I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1.08\\,\\mathrm{nA} = 1.08 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\nThe open probability is the dimensionless value $P_{\\mathrm{open}} = 0.60$.\nThe previously calculated unitary current is $i = 12 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{1.08 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.60 \\times (12 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A})}$$\nFirst, compute the denominator:\n$$0.60 \\times 12 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 7.2 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nNow, perform the division:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{1.08 \\times 10^{-9}}{7.2 \\times 10^{-12}}$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{1.08}{7.2} \\times 10^{-9 - (-12)} = 0.15 \\times 10^{3}$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{total}} = 150$$\nThe number of channels is a dimensionless integer, as expected.
