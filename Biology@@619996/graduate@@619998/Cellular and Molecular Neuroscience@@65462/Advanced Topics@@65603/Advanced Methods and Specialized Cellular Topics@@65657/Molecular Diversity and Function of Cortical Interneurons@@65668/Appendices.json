By applying principles of probability, you will gain hands-on experience with the quantitative foundation of cell-type classification and critically consider how real-world experimental biases can skew our view of the brain's true cellular composition.", "problem": "A single-cell transcriptomic survey of mouse neocortical layer $2/3$ aims to estimate the molecular composition of inhibitory interneurons defined by canonical markers: Parvalbumin (Pvalb), Somatostatin (Sst), and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (Vip). You obtain a random sample of $2000$ neurons. Independent stereological data indicate that a fraction $0.2$ of layer $2/3$ neurons are inhibitory. Within the inhibitory population, the long-run proportions are $0.4$ Pvalb, $0.3$ Sst, $0.15$ Vip, with the remainder belonging to other inhibitory classes.\n\nAssume that each neuron in the sample is independently drawn from a large population such that the sampling process can be modeled as a two-stage multinomial mechanism: first, a neuron is inhibitory with probability $0.2$ and excitatory with probability $0.8$, and second, conditional on being inhibitory, it is Pvalb, Sst, or Vip with probabilities $0.4$, $0.3$, and $0.15$, respectively.

It provides all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution based on established principles of probability theory and its application to biological sampling. The context is directly relevant to quantitative cellular and molecular neuroscience. Therefore, the problem is valid, and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the expected counts of Parvalbumin (Pvalb), Somatostatin (Sst), and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (Vip) positive interneurons in a random sample of $N = 2000$ cortical neurons. This will be accomplished by applying the law of total expectation, consistent with the two-stage sampling mechanism described.\n\nLet the set of all neurons in the population be partitioned into excitatory ($E$) and inhibitory ($I$) neurons. The problem states the probabilities for a single randomly drawn neuron:\n$$P(I) = 0.2$$\n$$P(E) = 1 - P(I) = 0.8$$\n\nThe inhibitory population is further partitioned into subtypes, including Pvalb, Sst, and Vip. The conditional probabilities for an inhibitory neuron to be of a specific subtype are given as:\n$$P(\\text{Pvalb} | I) = 0.4$$\n$$P(\\text{Sst} | I) = 0.3$$\n$$P(\\text{Vip} | I) = 0.15$$\n\nThese subtypes are mutually exclusive categories of inhibitory neurons. Thus, a neuron that is excitatory cannot be of type Pvalb, Sst, or Vip. This implies:\n$$P(\\text{Pvalb} | E) = 0$$\n$$P(\\text{Sst} | E) = 0$$\n$$P(\\text{Vip} | E) = 0$$\n\nLet $N_{Pvalb}$, $N_{Sst}$, and $N_{Vip}$ denote the random variables representing the counts of Pvalb, Sst, and Vip neurons, respectively, in the total sample of size $N=2000$. We are required to find their expected values: $E[N_{Pvalb}]$, $E[N_{Sst}]$, and $E[N_{Vip}]$.\n\nWe can first determine the unconditional probability that any single neuron is of a specific inhibitory subtype using the law of total probability:\n$$P(\\text{Subtype}) = P(\\text{Subtype} | I) P(I) + P(\\text{Subtype} | E) P(E)$$\nFor Pvalb neurons:\n$$P(\\text{Pvalb}) = (0.4)(0.2) + (0)(0.8) = 0.08$$\nFor Sst neurons:\n$$P(\\text{Sst}) = (0.3)(0.2) + (0)(0.8) = 0.06$$\nFor Vip neurons:\n$$P(\\text{Vip}) = (0.15)(0.2) + (0)(0.8) = 0.03$$\n\nThe total number of neurons of a given subtype in a sample of size $N$ is the sum of $N$ independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. Let $X_i$ be an indicator variable such that $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th neuron is of the subtype in question, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The expected count is then given by the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[N_{\\text{Subtype}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] = N \\cdot P(\\text{Subtype})$$\n\nApplying this principle:\n$$E[N_{Pvalb}] = N \\cdot P(\\text{Pvalb}) = 2000 \\cdot 0.08 = 160$$\n$$E[N_{Sst}] = N \\cdot P(\\text{Sst}) = 2000 \\cdot 0.06 = 120$$\n$$E[N_{Vip}] = N \\cdot P(\\text{Vip}) = 2000 \\cdot 0.03 = 60$$\n\nAlternatively, as suggested by the problem, we can use the law of total expectation directly on the counts. Let $N_I$ be the number of inhibitory neurons in the sample of $N=2000$. $N_I$ is a binomially distributed random variable, $N_I \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, P(I))$, with parameters $N=2000$ and $p=0.2$. The expected number of inhibitory neurons is:\n$$E[N_I] = N \\cdot P(I) = 2000 \\cdot 0.2 = 400$$\n\nNow, we find the expected count of Pvalb neurons by conditioning on the number of inhibitory neurons, $N_I$:\n$$E[N_{Pvalb}] = E[E[N_{Pvalb} | N_I]]$$\nGiven a specific count of $N_I$ inhibitory neurons, the number of Pvalb neurons among them follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N_I$ and $p' = P(\\text{Pvalb} | I) = 0.4$. Therefore, the conditional expectation is:\n$$E[N_{Pvalb} | N_I] = N_I \\cdot P(\\text{Pvalb} | I) = N_I \\cdot 0.4$$\nSubstituting this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$E[N_{Pvalb}] = E[N_I \\cdot 0.4] = 0.4 \\cdot E[N_I] = 0.4 \\cdot 400 = 160$$\n\nThis method confirms the previous result and explicitly follows the two-stage sampling structure. We apply the same logic for Sst and Vip neurons:\n$$E[N_{Sst}] = E[E[N_{Sst} | N_I]] = E[N_I \\cdot P(\\text{Sst} | I)] = P(\\text{Sst} | I) \\cdot E[N_I] = 0.3 \\cdot 400 = 120$$\n$$E[N_{Vip}] = E[E[N_{Vip} | N_I]] = E[N_I \\cdot P(\\text{Vip} | I)] = P(\\text{Vip} | I) \\cdot E[N_I] = 0.15 \\cdot 400 = 60$$\n\nThe final expected counts are $160$ for Pvalb, $120$ for Sst, and $60$ for Vip.\n\nRegarding the qualitative discussion on sampling bias:\nThe idealized model assumes that every neuron in situ has an equal probability of being sampled, which is not true in practice. Two significant sources of mechanistic bias in single-cell assays are:\n\n1.  **Dissociation-induced cell vulnerability**: The process of preparing a single-cell suspension from brain tissue requires enzymatic and mechanical dissociation. This procedure is harsh and can selectively destroy more fragile cell types. Neurons with large, complex morphological features, such as extensive and fine axonal or dendritic arbors, are more susceptible to membrane rupture and cell death. For instance, certain Sst-expressing interneurons, like Martinotti cells which have a very wide-spreading axonal arborization in layer $1$, are known to be particularly fragile.\n    *   **Direction of effect**: This bias would lead to an **underestimation** of the true proportion of fragile cell populations. We would likely observe systematically lower counts of Sst-positive neurons (and potentially certain Vip subtypes) relative to more compact and robust cell types like Pvalb-positive basket cells. The observed count of Sst neurons would therefore be lower than the expected $120$.\n\n2.  **Cell size bias in capture systems**: Many single-cell platforms, especially those based on microfluidics (e.g., 10x Genomics Chromium), can exhibit a bias related to cell size. The efficiency of a cell being encapsulated in a droplet, lysing properly, and its mRNA being captured can correlate with cell size and overall RNA content. Larger cells may be more readily captured and typically contain more mRNA, leading to higher-quality data that is more likely to pass computational quality-control filters.\n    *   **Direction of effect**: Pvalb-positive interneurons are, on average, larger than many Sst and Vip-positive interneurons. This bias would lead to an **over-representation** of Pvalb neurons in the final dataset. Consequently, the observed count of Pvalb neurons would likely be systematically higher than the expected $160$, while smaller interneuron classes would be under-represented.\n\nThese are fundamental technical challenges in the field, and accounting for them is critical for the accurate interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data from the nervous system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 160 & 120 & 60 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2727152"}, {"introduction": "Once we know the constituent cell types of a cortical area, the next step is to understand how they are wired together.

Let us consider a general directed connection from a presynaptic class $A$ to a postsynaptic class $B$. The number of neurons in class $A$ is $N_A$ and in class $B$ is $N_B$. The probability that a specific neuron from class $A$ connects to a specific neuron from class $B$ is $P_{A\\to B}$.\n\nThe total number of possible ordered neuron pairs from class $A$ to class $B$ is the product of the class sizes, $N_A \\times N_B$. Each of these potential connections is modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial.
