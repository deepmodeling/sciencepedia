This practice guides you through the process of analyzing raw experimental data by fitting it to the Hill-Langmuir model, the standard mathematical description of a dose-response curve. By performing a nonlinear least-squares fit, you will extract two critical parameters: the median effective concentration ($EC_{50}$), which measures ligand potency, and the Hill coefficient ($n$), which provides insight into the cooperativity of the signaling system [@problem_id:2704745].", "problem": "You are modeling dose–response relationships for engineered G protein–coupled receptors used in chemogenetics, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), expressed in neurons to modulate activity. You are provided with three independent concentration–response datasets measured as fractional activation (unitless, normalized to the maximal measurable effect of the assay) for an agonist that selectively activates the engineered receptor. The agonist concentration is in nanomolar, and you may assume a monotonic, saturating response with negligible baseline. From first principles in receptor theory, receptor occupancy under mass-action binding and its mapping to effect imply that a standard receptor occupancy-based model with a cooperativity exponent captures the steady-state input–output nonlinearity. Your task is to write a program that estimates the median effective concentration and the cooperativity exponent for each dataset by fitting the standard monotonic occupancy-based model used for agonist concentration–response curves (commonly referred to as the Hill–Langmuir model), under constraints that all parameters are positive. Then, based on the estimated cooperativity exponent, assign whether signaling is cooperative or not for each dataset.\n\nUse the following test suite, which provides three datasets. Each dataset consists of concentrations (in nanomolar) and normalized responses (unitless). All numbers below are exact and should be used as provided.\n\nDataset A:\n- Concentrations (nM): [$0.3$, $1$, $3$, $10$, $30$, $100$, $300$]\n- Responses (unitless): [$0.0101$, $0.0318$, $0.092$, $0.247$, $0.505$, $0.764$, $0.912$]\n\nDataset B:\n- Concentrations (nM): [$0.3$, $1$, $3$, $10$, $30$, $100$]\n- Responses (unitless): [$0.0010$, $0.0105$, $0.081$, $0.495$, $0.905$, $0.988$]\n\nDataset C:\n- Concentrations (nM): [$5$, $20$, $50$, $200$, $1000$]\n- Responses (unitless): [$0.0012$, $0.059$, $0.503$, $0.982$, $0.999$]\n\nRequirements and constraints:\n- Fit each dataset to the standard monotonic occupancy-based model with a cooperativity exponent, with a free maximal effect parameter and zero baseline. Constrain the median effective concentration to be strictly positive and the cooperativity exponent to be strictly positive. All fits must be performed by nonlinear least squares.\n- For each dataset, estimate:\n  - the median effective concentration $EC_{50}$ in nanomolar;\n  - the cooperativity exponent $n$ (dimensionless).\n- Define a boolean classification for cooperativity as follows: return true if $n \\gt 1$, and false otherwise.\n- Numerical output requirements:\n  - Report $EC_{50}$ in nanomolar, rounded to three significant figures.\n  - Report $n$ rounded to three significant figures.\n  - The cooperativity classification must be a boolean (true or false).\n- Your program must run as is without user input and must process all three datasets.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each dataset’s result should itself be a list of three elements in the order [$EC_{50}$, $n$, cooperative], so the overall output is a list of lists in the order [Dataset A result, Dataset B result, Dataset C result]. For example, the final output format must be like: [[$x_A$, $n_A$, true_or_false],[$x_B$, $n_B$, true_or_false],[$x_C$, $n_C$, true_or_false]] with no additional text.\n\nScientific realism and interpretation requirement:\n- After estimating parameters, interpret how a fitted $n \\gt 1$ could arise mechanistically from cooperative signaling steps in engineered receptor systems used in neuromodulation. This interpretation must be based on fundamental principles such as mass-action binding, receptor occupancy, and multi-step signal transduction, not on dataset-specific heuristics. The interpretation itself is conceptual and belongs in your solution write-up; the program only outputs the numerical and boolean results.\n\nThis problem is self-contained and should be solvable with any modern programming language using nonlinear least squares. Answer all quantities involving physical units in nanomolar, and ensure the angle unit is not relevant here. Percentages are not used; all fractional quantities are decimals. The test suite covers a typical well-sampled case (Dataset A), a steep response suggestive of cooperativity (Dataset B), and a sparse, steep case that challenges numerical robustness (Dataset C). The required outputs are floats and booleans only, aggregated as specified into a single-line list representation.", "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed and scientifically grounded task in computational biophysics and pharmacology. It requires the analysis of three dose-response datasets for an engineered G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) system. The objective is to estimate key parameters of the response by fitting the data to a standard model and to interpret these parameters in the context of receptor theory. The problem is valid as it is based on established scientific principles, provides all necessary data and constraints, and requests a standard, formalizable analysis.\n\nThe model to be fitted is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes the relationship between the concentration of a ligand, $C$, and the resulting biological response, $R$. This model is a cornerstone of pharmacology for characterizing agonist potency and the nature of the signaling response. The equation is given by:\n$$ R(C) = R_{max} \\frac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n} $$\nIn this formulation:\n- $C$ is the concentration of the agonist, provided in nanomolar ($nM$).\n- $R(C)$ is the measured response, which is a normalized, unitless quantity.\n- $R_{max}$ is the maximum possible response in the system. Although the data are normalized, they do not necessarily reach a maximum of $1$, so $R_{max}$ is a free parameter to be estimated.\n- $EC_{50}$ is the median effective concentration. It represents the agonist concentration at which the response is $50\\%$ of the maximum ($R_{max}/2$). This parameter is a measure of the agonist's potency.\n- $n$ is the Hill coefficient, a dimensionless parameter that describes the steepness of the curve. It serves as an index of cooperativity.\n\nThe parameters $\\vec{p} = (EC_{50}, n, R_{max})$ are estimated for each dataset by the method of nonlinear least squares. This involves finding the parameter values that minimize the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed responses $R_i$ and the responses predicted by the model $R(C_i; \\vec{p})$:\n$$ SSR(\\vec{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [R_i - R(C_i; \\vec{p})]^2 $$\nwhere the sum is over all $N$ data points $(C_i, R_i)$ in a given dataset. This minimization must be performed under the physically meaningful constraints that all parameters are strictly positive: $EC_{50}  0$, $n  0$, and $R_{max}  0$. This is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved numerically using algorithms such as the Levenberg-Marquardt or Trust Region Reflective methods.\n\nOnce the Hill coefficient $n$ is estimated, it is used to classify the signaling mechanism. The classification is based on the following interpretations:\n- $n=1$: The system follows simple mass-action kinetics, analogous to Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. This indicates non-cooperative binding, where the binding of one agonist molecule does not influence the binding of others.\n- $n1$: The system exhibits positive cooperativity. This implies that the binding of one agonist molecule to the receptor complex enhances the binding affinity or efficacy of subsequent molecules. This results in an \"ultrasensitive\" or switch-like response, which is steeper than a non-cooperative response.\n- $0n1$: The system exhibits negative cooperativity, where the binding of one molecule impedes the binding of subsequent ones, leading to a shallower response curve.\nThe problem requires a boolean classification, returning true if $n  1$ (positive cooperativity) and false otherwise (non-cooperative or negatively cooperative).\n\nThe scientific interpretation of a fitted Hill coefficient $n  1$ in the context of engineered receptors like DREADDs is crucial. Mechanistically, positive cooperativity cannot arise from a simple $1:1$ bimolecular interaction. It necessitates a system with multiple interacting components. This can occur at several levels:\n1.  **Receptor Level**: If the engineered receptor is a multimer (e.g., a dimer or oligomer), the binding of an agonist to one subunit could induce an allosteric conformational change in the other subunits, increasing their affinity for the agonist. This is the classical model of cooperativity.\n2.  **Signal Transduction Cascade**: Even if the receptor itself is a monomer and binds the agonist non-cooperatively ($n_{binding}=1$), the downstream signaling pathway can generate a cooperative input-output relationship. GPCRs activate G proteins, which in turn modulate effector enzymes or ion channels. If multiple activated G proteins are required to activate a single effector molecule, or if feedback loops or other nonlinearities exist within the cascade, the overall response measured (e.g., calcium influx, cAMP production) can be a steep function of the initial receptor activation. This \"systems-level\" cooperativity makes the pathway ultrasensitive to changes in agonist concentration, effectively acting as a signal processing motif to convert a graded input into a more decisive, switch-like output. For engineered receptors expressed in a host cell, the observed Hill coefficient is thus a property of the entire system—receptor plus endogenous cellular machinery—and not necessarily an intrinsic property of the receptor molecule alone.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by defining the Hill function, providing reasonable initial parameter guesses (e.g., $R_{max,0} \\approx \\max(R_i)$, $EC_{50,0}$ corresponding to the concentration nearest to $R_{max,0}/2$, and $n_0=1$), and applying a constrained nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm for each of the three datasets provided. The resulting parameters, $EC_{50}$ and $n$, will be rounded to three significant figures, and the cooperativity will be classified as a boolean value.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fits dose-response data to the Hill-Langmuir model to estimate EC50 and \n    the cooperativity exponent n, and classifies the cooperativity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the datasets as provided in the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Dataset A\n        {'conc': np.array([0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300]), \n         'resp': np.array([0.0101, 0.0318, 0.092, 0.247, 0.505, 0.764, 0.912])},\n        # Dataset B\n        {'conc': np.array([0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100]), \n         'resp': np.array([0.0010, 0.0105, 0.081, 0.495, 0.905, 0.988])},\n        # Dataset C\n        {'conc': np.array([5, 20, 50, 200, 1000]),\n         'resp': np.array([0.0012, 0.059, 0.503, 0.982, 0.999])}\n    ]\n\n    def hill_model(C, ec50, n, rmax):\n        \"\"\"Standard Hill-Langmuir equation.\"\"\"\n        return rmax * (C**n) / (ec50**n + C**n)\n\n    def round_to_sf(x, sf):\n        \"\"\"Rounds a number to a specified number of significant figures.\"\"\"\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0.0\n        # Calculate the position of the most significant digit\n        # Then round to the correct number of decimal places\n        return round(x, sf - 1 - int(np.floor(np.log10(abs(x)))))\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        c_data = case['conc']\n        r_data = case['resp']\n\n        # Provide robust initial guesses for the parameters\n        rmax_guess = np.max(r_data)\n        # Find concentration closest to half-maximal response as EC50 guess\n        ec50_guess_idx = np.argmin(np.abs(r_data - rmax_guess / 2.0))\n        ec50_guess = c_data[ec50_guess_idx]\n        n_guess = 1.0\n        \n        p0 = [ec50_guess, n_guess, rmax_guess]\n\n        # Define strict positive bounds for all parameters as per problem constraints\n        # Use a small positive number to avoid issues at zero\n        lower_bounds = [np.finfo(float).eps, np.finfo(float).eps, np.finfo(float).eps]\n        upper_bounds = [np.inf, np.inf, np.inf]\n        bounds = (lower_bounds, upper_bounds)\n\n        # Perform nonlinear least squares fitting\n        # 'trf' method is robust and suitable for bounds\n        popt, _ = curve_fit(\n            hill_model, \n            c_data, \n            r_data, \n            p0=p0, \n            bounds=bounds,\n            method='trf',\n            max_nfev=5000 # Increased iterations for robustness\n        )\n        \n        ec50_fit, n_fit, rmax_fit = popt\n\n        # Round results to three significant figures\n        ec50_rounded = round_to_sf(ec50_fit, 3)\n        n_rounded = round_to_sf(n_fit, 3)\n\n        # Classify cooperativity based on the unrounded fitted value of n\n        is_cooperative = n_fit  1.0\n\n        results.append([ec50_rounded, n_rounded, is_cooperative])\n\n    # Format the final output string as specified\n    formatted_results = []\n    for res in results:\n        # res[2] is a boolean, convert to lowercase string 'true' or 'false'\n        coop_str = str(res[2]).lower()\n        formatted_results.append(f\"[{res[0]},{res[1]},{coop_str}]\")\n    \n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\"\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2704745"}, {"introduction": "The power of chemogenetics lies in its specificity, but this requires careful experimental design to avoid unintended off-target effects.

Whole-cell current-clamp recordings are obtained under synaptic blockade. After establishing a stable baseline, deschloroclozapine (DCZ) at $10$ nM is bath-applied to selectively activate the DREADDs.

This closure of potassium channels leads to a decrease in the total resting potassium conductance, $g_K$.\n2.  **Input Resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$)**: The total membrane conductance, $G_{\\text{m}}$, is the sum of all individual ionic conductances. Since a major component of the resting conductance, $g_K$, is decreased, the total conductance $G_{\\text{m}}$ must also decrease. Input resistance is the reciprocal of conductance, $R_{\\text{in}} = 1/G_{\\text{m}}$. Therefore, a decrease in $G_{\\text{m}}$ results in an **increase** in $R_{\\text{in}}$.\n3.  **Resting Membrane Potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$)**: The resting membrane potential is established by the balance of ionic fluxes. The resting neuron is primarily permeable to K$^+$ ions, making $V_{\\text{rest}}$ close to the potassium reversal potential, $E_K$ (e.g., approximately $-90$ mV). Decreasing the potassium conductance $g_K$ reduces the influence of the outward K$^+$ current relative to the constant inward leak currents (e.g., Na$^+$ leak). Consequently, $V_{\\text{rest}}$ will shift to a more positive value, i.e., it will **depolarize**. For instance, it might shift from $-70$ mV to $-65$ mV.\n4.  **Rheobase ($I_{\\text{rh}}$)**: We apply the given approximation $I_{\\text{rh}} \\approx \\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)/R_{\\text{in}}$.\n    - The numerator, the voltage difference to threshold $\\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)$, decreases because $V_{\\text{rest}}$ depolarizes, moving closer to $V_{\\text{th}}$.\n    - The denominator, $R_{\\text{in}}$, increases as determined above.\n    - A decrease in the numerator and an increase in the denominator both contribute to a smaller value for the fraction. Thus, the rheobase $I_{\\text{rh}}$ will **decrease**. The neuron becomes easier to excite to threshold.\n5.  **Spike Frequency**: The problem states that spike frequency at a fixed current $I_{\\text{inj}}$ is increased by an increase in $R_{\\text{in}}$ and by depolarization of $V_{\\text{rest}}$. Our analysis shows that hM3Dq activation causes both of these effects. The cell is closer to threshold and the same current injection $I_{\\text{inj}} = 150$ pA will produce a larger voltage deflection $\\Delta V = I_{\\text{inj}} \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$ because $R_{\\text{in}}$ has increased. Therefore, the steady-state spike frequency will **increase**.\n\n**Summary for hM3Dq**: Input resistance increases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency increases.\n\n**Case 2: hM4Di (Gi/o-coupled) Activation**\n1.  **Mechanism**: The problem states that Gi/o signaling via hM4Di activation opens GIRK channels. This directly increases the membrane's potassium conductance, $g_K$.\n2.  **Input Resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$)**: An increase in $g_K$ causes an increase in the total membrane conductance $G_{\\text{m}}$. Since $R_{\\text{in}} = 1/G_{\\text{m}}$, the input resistance $R_{\\text{in}}$ will **decrease**.\n3.  **Resting Membrane Potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$)**: Increasing the potassium conductance $g_K$ strengthens the influence of the K$^+$ Nernst potential, $E_K$. This will pull the membrane potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ closer to $E_K$, which is more negative than the initial $V_{\\text{rest}}$. Therefore, $V_{\\text{rest}}$ will shift to a more negative value, i.e., it will **hyperpolarize**. For instance, it might shift from $-70$ mV to $-75$ mV.\n4.  **Rheobase ($I_{\\text{rh}}$)**: We again use the approximation $I_{\\text{rh}} \\approx \\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)/R_{\\text{in}}$.\n    - The numerator, $\\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)$, increases because $V_{\\text{rest}}$ hyperpolarizes, moving further from $V_{\\text{th}}$.\n    - The denominator, $R_{\\text{in}}$, decreases as determined above.\n    - An increase in the numerator and a decrease in the denominator both contribute to a larger value for the fraction. Thus, the rheobase $I_{\\text{rh}}$ will **increase**. The neuron becomes harder to excite to threshold.\n5.  **Spike Frequency**: The problem states that spike frequency at a fixed current $I_{\\text{inj}}$ is decreased by a decrease in $R_{\\text{in}}$ and by hyperpolarization of $V_{\\text{rest}}$. Our analysis shows that hM4Di activation causes both of these effects. The cell is further from threshold and the same current injection $I_{\\text{inj}} = 150$ pA will produce a smaller voltage deflection $\\Delta V$ because $R_{\\text{in}}$ has decreased. Therefore, the steady-state spike frequency will **decrease**.\n\n**Summary for hM4Di**: Input resistance decreases, rheobase increases, spike frequency decreases.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n- **A) hM3Dq: input resistance increases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ increases; hM4Di: input resistance decreases, rheobase increases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ decreases.**\nThis option's predictions for hM3Dq (increase, decrease, increase) and for hM4Di (decrease, increase, decrease) perfectly match the results derived from the first principles provided.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B) hM3Dq: input resistance decreases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ increases; hM4Di: input resistance increases, rheobase increases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ decreases.**\nThis option incorrectly states that hM3Dq activation decreases input resistance and that hM4Di activation increases input resistance. These are the opposite of the derived effects on membrane conductance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C) hM3Dq: input resistance increases, rheobase increases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ decreases; hM4Di: input resistance decreases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ increases.**\nThis option incorrectly describes the effects on rheobase and spike frequency for both receptor types. For hM3Dq, it claims rheobase increases and frequency decreases, which contradicts the excitatory nature of this manipulation. For hM4Di, it claims rheobase decreases and frequency increases, which contradicts the inhibitory nature of this manipulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D) Both hM3Dq and hM4Di: no significant change in input resistance; both decrease rheobase and increase spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ due to G protein modulation that accelerates spike initiation kinetics.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It claims no significant change in input resistance, which contradicts the primary mechanisms of modulating K$^+$ conductances. It also incorrectly claims both manipulations have the same excitatory effect, ignoring the opposing nature of Gq and Gi/o signaling on neuronal excitability as defined in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2704807"}]}
