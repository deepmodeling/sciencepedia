A cornerstone of modern cell biology is the ability to design experiments that can robustly test such functional dependencies while meticulously controlling for artifacts. This first practice challenges you to design a state-of-the-art experimental pipeline, integrating the critical triad of perturbation, measurement, and rescue to investigate the role of lipid rafts in a signaling pathway [@problem_id:2723806].", "problem": "You are investigating whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons requires membrane microdomains commonly termed lipid rafts. You must design a perturbation–measurement–rescue pipeline that can support or falsify raft-dependence while minimizing confounds. Use the following foundational facts and definitions as your starting base for reasoning:\n\n- Lipid rafts are nanoscale, dynamic, liquid-ordered assemblies enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Their integrity requires both components; acute cholesterol extraction disrupts liquid-ordered packing, and co-repletion with cholesterol restores it when properly reinserted into the plasma membrane.\n- Methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin (MβCD) acutely extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane; cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin can orthogonally replete cholesterol. Not all sterols equivalently support liquid-ordered phase; for example, 7-ketocholesterol substitutes bulk sterol mass but weakly supports liquid-ordered packing.\n- Laurdan dye generalized polarization (GP) imaging reports on membrane lipid order; decreases in GP reflect loss of liquid-ordered character.\n- Detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) flotation enriches raft markers (for example, ganglioside GM1, flotillin), but detergent can induce artifacts; thus DRM analysis is supportive but not sole evidence.\n- Sphingolipid depletion via serine palmitoyltransferase inhibition (for example, myriocin) decreases sphingolipid synthesis; exogenous sphingomyelin can partially restore sphingolipid content. Acute sphingomyelinase generates ceramide, which has independent signaling effects.\n- Off-target effects of MβCD include effects on endocytosis and potential cytotoxicity; appropriate controls include measuring total cellular cholesterol, transferrin uptake, cell viability, and verifying that BDNF binding and TrkB surface levels are not diminished by receptor internalization artifacts.\n\nSelect the single pipeline that most convincingly tests raft dependence by integrating: acute cholesterol depletion, an orthogonal rescue with cholesterol repletion that restores liquid-ordered packing, specificity controls via sphingolipid manipulation, and independent measurements that link biophysical raft state to signaling readouts while controlling for confounds. Each proposed pipeline specifies perturbations, measurements, and rescue steps.\n\nA. Acute perturbation–rescue with orthogonal sterol control and sphingolipid specificity, tied to membrane order readout and trafficking controls:\n- Perturb: Treat neurons with methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin at $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to acutely extract cholesterol. Confirm a reduction of total cellular cholesterol by $>30\\%$ using an enzymatic cholesterol assay and filipin fluorescence, and verify reduction in membrane order by Laurdan generalized polarization (GP) imaging at the soma and dendrites.\n- Measurement: Stimulate with BDNF ($50\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$ for $5\\,\\mathrm{min}$), quantify phospho-ERK by immunoblot normalized to total ERK, and in parallel quantify TrkB nanoclustering and colocalization with GM1 (cholera toxin B subunit labeling) by super-resolution microscopy. Perform DRM flotation as a supportive assay to assess redistribution of GM1 and TrkB from buoyant fractions, but do not use it as the primary evidence.\n- Rescue: Replete cholesterol using cholesterol-loaded MβCD for $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$ to restore membrane cholesterol to within $\\pm 10\\%$ of baseline and demonstrate GP recovery to within $\\pm 0.05$ of baseline GP. Include a negative rescue control by repleting with 7-ketocholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin to restore bulk sterol amount without restoring liquid-ordered GP.\n- Specificity controls: Deplete sphingolipids with myriocin at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$, verify sphingomyelin reduction by mass spectrometry or thin-layer chromatography, and show that BDNF-induced phospho-ERK and membrane GP decrease similarly to cholesterol extraction. Attempt rescue with exogenous sphingomyelin–containing liposomes cotreated with cholesterol-loaded MβCD to restore liquid-ordered GP. Avoid acute sphingomyelinase to prevent confounding ceramide signaling.\n- Confound controls: Assess transferrin uptake to monitor endocytosis, cell viability, and surface TrkB levels by surface biotinylation. Conclude raft dependence only if decreases in phospho-ERK track with decreases in GP and are reversed by cholesterol (but not 7-ketocholesterol) repletion and by sphingomyelin plus cholesterol repletion.\n\nB. Chronic metabolic cholesterol perturbation with limited rescue and no membrane order readout:\n- Perturb: Treat neurons with simvastatin at $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ to lower cholesterol, without direct measurement of cholesterol content or membrane order.\n- Measurement: Stimulate with BDNF and quantify total ERK (not phospho-ERK) and whole-cell calcium transients as signaling outputs.\n- Rescue: Add low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$ for $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$ to replenish cholesterol.\n- Specificity controls: Apply bacterial sphingomyelinase acutely to reduce sphingomyelin, and interpret any change in signaling as raft-specific.\n- Confound controls: None specified beyond cell viability.\n\nC. Detergent-based raft assignment without perturbation–rescue:\n- Perturb: None.\n- Measurement: Perform DRM flotation after BDNF stimulation; if TrkB and ERK co-fractionate with GM1 and flotillin, conclude raft dependence.\n- Rescue: None.\n- Specificity controls: Inhibit N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin, reasoning that many raft proteins are glycosylated.\n- Confound controls: None.\n\nD. Acute cholesterol extraction with incomplete rescue and ceramide supplementation:\n- Perturb: Treat neurons with methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin at $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- Measurement: Quantify phospho-ERK without normalizing to total ERK; no measurement of cholesterol content or membrane order.\n- Rescue: Incubate with unloaded MβCD for $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$ to “reverse” effects.\n- Specificity controls: Add short-chain C6-ceramide to “mimic” sphingolipid restoration.\n- Confound controls: None.\n\nE. Acute cholesterol extraction and overexpression-based sphingomyelin manipulation without orthogonal sterol rescue or membrane order readout:\n- Perturb: Treat with methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin at $2.5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for $20\\,\\mathrm{min}$ and overexpress sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) for $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ to increase sphingomyelin.\n- Measurement: Quantify BDNF-induced phospho-Fyn and phospho-ERK; no Laurdan GP or cholesterol quantification performed.\n- Rescue: Add free cholesterol–ethanol solution to the medium ($20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$, $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$) without a carrier.\n- Specificity controls: None; assume SMS1 overexpression is specific for raft formation.\n- Confound controls: None.\n\nWhich option provides a logically sufficient, scientifically realistic pipeline that tests raft dependence by linking changes in membrane order and lipid composition to signaling, using acute perturbation, orthogonal rescue, and specificity controls while minimizing confounds?\n\nA.

Pipeline E", "solution": "The problem asks for the identification of the most rigorous and scientifically sound experimental pipeline to test the hypothesis that BDNF-induced ERK phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons is dependent on lipid rafts. The evaluation must be based on a set of provided foundational facts regarding lipid rafts, their manipulation, and associated measurement techniques. A correct pipeline must integrate perturbation, measurement, and rescue steps, while controlling for specificity and potential confounds.\n\nThe core principles for establishing raft dependence, as derived from the provided information, are:\n$1$. **Perturbation**: The structural integrity of the raft must be disrupted. This primarily involves the depletion of its essential components, cholesterol and sphingolipids. The effect of this perturbation must be confirmed with a direct biophysical measurement of membrane order, such as Laurdan Generalized Polarization (GP).\n$2$. **Measurement**: A quantitative and specific readout of the signaling pathway of interest must be performed. In this case, it is the phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK), which must be normalized to total ERK levels to account for any changes in total protein.\n$3$. **Rescue**: The phenotype observed upon perturbation (e.g., loss of p-ERK signal) must be reversed by specifically restoring the depleted component. Crucially, the rescue must also be shown to restore the biophysical properties of the membrane (e.g., membrane order as measured by GP).\n$4$. **Orthogonal Control**: A critical component of a rescue experiment is a negative control that distinguishes between a specific biophysical requirement and a non-specific bulk effect. For cholesterol depletion, repletion with a sterol like 7-ketocholesterol, which restores sterol mass but not the liquid-ordered phase, serves this purpose.\n$5$. **Specificity**: Since rafts are defined by both cholesterol and sphingolipids, a robust claim of raft dependence should ideally be supported by disrupting sphingolipid homeostasis as well, demonstrating a similar effect on the signaling outcome.\n$6$. **Confound Control**: The experimental manipulations, particularly with chemical inhibitors like MβCD, can have off-target effects. These must be rigorously controlled for. The problem statement itself lists cytotoxicity, endocytosis defects, and changes in receptor surface expression as key potential confounds.\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed pipeline against these principles.\n\n**Option A: Acute perturbation–rescue with orthogonal sterol control and sphingolipid specificity, tied to membrane order readout and trafficking controls.**\n- **Perturbation**: Utilizes acute cholesterol extraction with methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin (MβCD). It correctly mandates quantification of both the chemical depletion (cholesterol assay, filipin) and the biophysical consequence (decrease in Laurdan GP). This is a strong start.\n- **Measurement**: Proposes quantifying phospho-ERK normalized to total ERK, which is the correct and rigorous method. It supplements this with advanced imaging (super-resolution microscopy) to probe TrkB nanoclustering, directly linking the macroscopic signaling measurement to the microscopic organization of the receptor. It correctly relegates detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) analysis to a supportive role, acknowledging its potential for artifacts.\n- **Rescue**: Implements a proper rescue with cholesterol-loaded MβCD, with the critical requirement of verifying the restoration of both cholesterol levels and membrane GP.\n- **Orthogonal Control**: Includes the ideal orthogonal control: repletion with 7-ketocholesterol. This directly tests whether the liquid-ordered character of the membrane, rather than just the presence of a sterol, is necessary for signaling.\n- **Specificity Controls**: Addresses the role of sphingolipids by using myriocin to inhibit their synthesis. It correctly suggests avoiding acute sphingomyelinase due to confounding ceramide signaling. It also proposes a logical rescue strategy for sphingolipid depletion.\n- **Confound Controls**: Systematically addresses the main off-target effects mentioned in the problem statement: endocytosis (transferrin uptake), viability, and surface receptor levels (surface biotinylation).\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is exceptionally well-designed. It systematically links the chemical composition of the membrane (cholesterol, sphingolipids) to its biophysical state (GP) and demonstrates that the biological readout (p-ERK) tracks with this biophysical state through a rigorous perturbation-rescue-orthogonal control paradigm, while meticulously controlling for artifacts.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Chronic metabolic cholesterol perturbation with limited rescue and no membrane order readout.**\n- **Perturbation**: Uses chronic simvastatin treatment ($48\\,\\mathrm{h}$). This is a less direct method than acute extraction and carries a higher risk of pleiotropic cellular adaptations. A major flaw is the complete absence of any measurement of cholesterol content or membrane order.\n- **Measurement**: Measures total ERK instead of phospho-ERK. This is fundamentally incorrect, as signaling is mediated by phosphorylation, not changes in total protein levels.\n- **Rescue**: Rescue with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is plausible, but its effectiveness is not verified biophysically.\n- **Specificity Controls**: Uses acute bacterial sphingomyelinase. As explicitly stated in the problem's foundational facts, this generates ceramide, a potent signaling molecule, thus introducing a severe confound that makes interpretation impossible.\n- **Confound Controls**: Only considers cell viability, ignoring crucial factors like endocytosis and receptor expression.\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is deeply flawed. It measures the wrong parameter (total ERK), fails to verify its perturbation, uses a highly confounding specificity control, and lacks essential controls.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Detergent-based raft assignment without perturbation–rescue.**\n- **Perturbation/Rescue**: There are no perturbation or rescue steps. This experimental design is purely correlational, based on co-fractionation in a biochemical assay. It cannot establish a causal link between rafts and signaling.\n- **Measurement**: Relies entirely on DRM flotation. The problem statement explicitly warns that this method is prone to artifacts and should not be used as sole evidence.\n- **Specificity Controls**: The proposed control, tunicamycin treatment to inhibit glycosylation, is highly non-specific and only tangentially related to the core lipid composition of rafts.\n- **Conclusion**: This approach is outdated and scientifically weak. It fails to meet the basic requirements of a causal experiment (perturbation-rescue) and relies on an unreliable technique.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Acute cholesterol extraction with incomplete rescue and ceramide supplementation.**\n- **Perturbation**: Uses MβCD for a prolonged period ($30\\,\\mathrm{min}$), increasing the risk of off-target effects, without any confirmation of cholesterol depletion or GP change.\n- **Measurement**: Quantifies phospho-ERK without normalization to total ERK, which is poor quantitative practice.\n- **Rescue**: The proposed \"rescue\" is incubation with unloaded MβCD. This is nonsensical. Unloaded MβCD is the agent of cholesterol *extraction*; it does not perform a rescue. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the tool.\n- **Specificity Controls**: Uses C6-ceramide to \"mimic\" sphingolipid restoration. Ceramide is a distinct signaling molecule and does not restore sphingomyelin-dependent membrane properties. This introduces a confound, it is not a control.\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is based on a cascade of conceptual errors regarding the function of the reagents. The \"rescue\" and \"specificity control\" steps would invalidate any results obtained.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Acute cholesterol extraction and overexpression-based sphingomyelin manipulation without orthogonal sterol rescue or membrane order readout.**\n- **Perturbation**: Uses MβCD but fails to verify its effect on cholesterol levels or membrane order.\n- **Measurement**: Lacks the key biophysical measurement (Laurdan GP) needed to link the perturbation to a change in membrane state.\n- **Rescue**: Employs a crude and unreliable method of cholesterol repletion (free cholesterol in ethanol) without a proper carrier. The success of this rescue is unverified. There is no orthogonal sterol rescue control.\n- **Specificity Controls**: None are proposed; it simply assumes sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) overexpression is a specific manipulation for rafts, which is an unproven assumption.\n- **Confound Controls**: Completely absent.\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is incomplete and lacks rigor. It omits essential verification steps, controls, and uses a suboptimal rescue strategy, failing to build a convincing case for raft dependence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, Pipeline A is the only option that presents a complete, rigorous, and logically sound experimental plan that adheres to the highest standards of scientific investigation for this question.

Single-particle tracking (SPT) offers a powerful window into the membrane's microenvironment by monitoring the motion of individual molecules.

The problem is self-contained, with all necessary constants, models, and classification rules explicitly defined. It constitutes a well-defined computational task.\n\nThe analysis of anomalous diffusion from mean-squared displacement (MSD) data is predicated on the power-law relationship between MSD, denoted $\\langle r^2(t)\\rangle$, and time, $t$. For a two-dimensional system, this relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\langle r^2(t)\\rangle = 4 D_\\alpha t^\\alpha\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the anomalous exponent and $D_\\alpha$ is the generalized diffusion coefficient.

Your task is to write a program that, given a set of composition and temperature test cases, performs the following steps from first principles and outputs a pass/fail boolean for each case according to the stated validation criteria.\n\nStart from the following physically grounded bases.\n\n- Regular solution mean-field thermodynamics for binary demixing, extended with a cholesterol-dependent effective interaction: the dimensionless mixing free energy density is\n  $$ g(x_s, x_u; T, x_c) = x_s \\ln x_s + x_u \\ln x_u + \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T, x_c) \\, x_s x_u, $$\n  where $x_s$ is the mole fraction of saturated/high melting temperature lipids (e.g., sphingomyelin-like/DPPC-like), $x_u$ is the mole fraction of unsaturated/low melting temperature lipids (e.g., DOPC/POPC-like), and $x_c$ is the mole fraction of cholesterol, with $x_s + x_u + x_c = 1$. The cholesterol-modified interaction parameter is\n  $$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T, x_c) = \\left(\\chi_0 + k_c \\, x_c \\right)\\, \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T}, $$\n  where $T$ is absolute temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a reference temperature, and $\\chi_0$ and $k_c$ are composition-independent constants.\n\n- Spinodal criterion for instability to phase separation (proxy for Lo/Ld coexistence): the unstable regime is identified when the second derivative of $g$ with respect to $x_s$ at fixed $x_c$ satisfies\n  $$ \\lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_s^2} = \\frac{1}{x_s} + \\frac{1}{x_u} - 2 \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T, x_c)  0. $$\n\n- If $\\lambda  0$ (unstable), treat the system as undergoing Lo/Ld demixing. Construct prototypical local compositions for Lo and Ld by shifting saturated lipids and cholesterol into Lo in proportion to the instability magnitude. Define\n  $$ s = \\max(0, -\\lambda), \\quad \\hat{s} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{s}{L_0}\\right), \\quad p = 0.1 + 0.2\\,\\hat{s}, $$\n  with $L_0$ a dimensionless scale constant.

The two-dimensional viscosity $\\mu$ for a phase with composition $(x_s, x_c)$ is modeled as\n  $$ \\mu(x_s, x_c) = \\mu_0 + a_s \\, x_s + a_c \\, x_c, $$\n  with $\\mu$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.

Express $D$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ and round internally only at the end if needed for comparison.\n\n- Acyl-chain orientational order parameter proxy (e.g., deuterium order parameter) is approximated by a linear mixing rule with temperature dependence:\n  $$ S = S_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\kappa_c \\, x_c + \\kappa_s \\, x_s - \\kappa_T (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}), $$\n  where $S$ is dimensionless.

The models include a mean-field free energy for a ternary lipid mixture ($x_s$, $x_u$, $x_c$), a spinodal instability criterion ($\\lambda  0$), an ad hoc model for partitioning lipids between Liquid-ordered (Lo) and Liquid-disordered (Ld) phases, and coarse-grained models for membrane viscosity ($\\mu$), diffusion coefficient ($D$), and acyl-chain order parameter ($S$). All constants and component values are provided.\n\n2.  **Scientific Grounding and Consistency**: The theoretical framework is based on established principles in soft matter physics and membrane biophysics. The use of a Flory-Huggins-type free energy model is a standard approach for studying polymer or lipid mixtures. The spinodal decomposition criterion, $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_s^2}  0$, is a correct application of thermodynamic stability theory. The Saffman-Delbrück model for diffusion is a cornerstone of membrane biophysics. The linear mixing rules for viscosity and order parameter are justifiable approximations in a coarse-grained context. The parameters provided are dimensionally consistent and within physically plausible ranges. The mole fractions in all test cases correctly sum to $1$. There are no internal contradictions, scientific inaccuracies, or reliance on pseudoscience.\n\n3.  **Well-Posedness and Objectivity**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies a deterministic algorithm that takes a set of input parameters and produces a unique, unambiguous boolean output. The language is objective and precise, defining all terms within the context of the provided models.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is deemed valid. It is a well-defined computational task in theoretical biophysics, grounded in scientifically accepted, albeit simplified, models.\n\n**Solution Methodology**\n\nThe solution requires implementing a computational procedure that evaluates the state of a lipid membrane for given compositions and temperatures. The procedure unfolds as follows:\n\nFirst, we establish the thermodynamic stability of the ternary mixture, which consists of a saturated lipid component with mole fraction $x_s$, an unsaturated component with mole fraction $x_u$, and cholesterol with mole fraction $x_c$, such that $x_s + x_u + x_c = 1$. The mixing behavior is described by a dimensionless mean-field free energy density, $g$, defined as:\n$$ g(x_s, x_u; T, x_c) = x_s \\ln x_s + x_u \\ln x_u + \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T, x_c) \\, x_s x_u $$\nThe first two terms represent the ideal entropy of mixing. The third term accounts for non-ideal interactions, governed by an effective interaction parameter, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, that is dependent on temperature $T$ and cholesterol fraction $x_c$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T, x_c) = \\left(\\chi_0 + k_c \\, x_c \\right)\\, \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T} $$\nHere, $\\chi_0$ ($=1.8$) is the base interaction parameter, $k_c$ ($=4.5$) quantifies cholesterol's influence on miscibility, and $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ ($=310\\,\\mathrm{K}$) is a reference temperature. This formulation correctly captures the essential physics that cholesterol promotes ordering and can enhance the tendency for phase separation between saturated and unsaturated lipids.\n\nThe stability of the mixture against small composition fluctuations is determined by the sign of the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to composition. Treating the system as a pseudo-binary mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids at a fixed cholesterol concentration, the spinodal instability parameter $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$ \\lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_s^2}\\bigg|_{x_c} = \\frac{1}{x_s} + \\frac{1}{x_u} - 2 \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T, x_c) $$\nA value of $\\lambda  0$ signifies that the single-phase mixture is unstable and will spontaneously demix into Lo and Ld phases. A value of $\\lambda \\ge 0$ indicates a stable, single-phase membrane.\n\nIf the system is unstable ($\\lambda  0$), we must construct prototypical compositions for the coexisting Lo and Ld phases. A heuristic partitioning scheme is defined based on the magnitude of the instability, $s = \\max(0, -\\lambda)$. This is normalized to $\\hat{s} = \\min(1, s/L_0)$ with $L_0=1.0$, and then used to define a partitioning factor $p = 0.1 + 0.2\\,\\hat{s}$. This factor dictates the degree to which saturated lipids and cholesterol are enriched in the Lo phase and depleted from the Ld phase. The compositions are calculated as:\n- Lo phase: $x_s^{\\mathrm{Lo}} = \\min(0.99, x_s (1+p))$, $x_c^{\\mathrm{Lo}} = \\min(0.99 - x_s^{\\mathrm{Lo}}, x_c (1+p))$, and $x_u^{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 1 - x_s^{\\mathrm{Lo}} - x_c^{\\mathrm{Lo}}$.\n- Ld phase: $x_s^{\\mathrm{Ld}} = \\max(10^{-6}, x_s (1-p))$, $x_c^{\\mathrm{Ld}} = \\max(10^{-6}, x_c (1-p))$, and $x_u^{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 1 - x_s^{\\mathrm{Ld}} - x_c^{\\mathrm{Ld}}$.\nIf the system is stable ($\\lambda \\ge 0$), it is treated as a single, Ld-like phase with the global composition: $(x_s^{\\mathrm{SP}}, x_c^{\\mathrm{SP}}, x_u^{\\mathrm{SP}}) = (x_s, x_c, x_u)$.\n\nWith the compositions of the relevant phase(s) determined, we calculate their physical properties. The $2$D membrane viscosity $\\mu$ is modeled as a linear function of composition:\n$$ \\mu(x_s, x_c) = \\mu_0 + a_s \\, x_s + a_c \\, x_c $$\nwhere $\\mu_0 = 0.8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$, $a_s = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$, and $a_c = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe lateral diffusion coefficient $D$ of a lipid-sized particle is then computed using the Saffman-Delbrück equation:\n$$ D = \\frac{k_B T}{4\\pi \\mu} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\eta_s a}\\right) - \\gamma \\right] $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\eta_s=1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ is the viscosity of the surrounding aqueous solvent, $a=4.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ is the effective particle radius, and $\\gamma \\approx 0.577$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The result, in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, is converted to $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ by multiplying by $10^{12}$.\n\nThe acyl-chain order parameter $S$, a measure of membrane fluidity, is also modeled as a linear function of composition and temperature:\n$$ S = S_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\kappa_c \\, x_c + \\kappa_s \\, x_s - \\kappa_T (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) $$\nwith parameters $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 0.15$, $\\kappa_c = 0.25$, $\\kappa_s = 0.20$, and $\\kappa_T = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.
