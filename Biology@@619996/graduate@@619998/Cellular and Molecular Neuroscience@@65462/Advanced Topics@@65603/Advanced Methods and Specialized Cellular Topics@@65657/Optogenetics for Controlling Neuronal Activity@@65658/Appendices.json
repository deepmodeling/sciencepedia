The problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. All provided parameters are physically realistic for a voltage-clamp experiment on a neuron expressing Channelrhodopsin-$2$. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe solution is constructed upon three fundamental principles provided in the problem statement, which we will formalize into mathematical expressions.\n\nFirst, the single-channel current, $i$, for an open channel is described as ohmic. This implies a linear relationship between current and the electrical driving force. The problem specifies using the magnitude of the driving force. Thus, the magnitude of the single-channel current, $|i|$, is the product of the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$ and the magnitude of the driving force $|V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}|$.\n$$|i| = \\gamma |V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}|$$\nHere, $V_m$ is the membrane potential and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the reversal potential of the channel.\n\nSecond, the average number of channels in the open state, $N_{\\mathrm{open}}$, at steady state is determined by the total number of functional channels in the membrane, $N_{\\mathrm{channels}}$, and the steady-state open probability, $P_O$.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{open}} = N_{\\mathrm{channels}} P_O$$\n\nThird, the total macroscopic current, $I$, is the sum of the currents from all individual open channels. Since the channels are assumed to be identical and independent, the magnitude of the total current is the product of the number of open channels and the magnitude of the single-channel current.\n$$I = N_{\\mathrm{open}} |i|$$\nNote that the problem states $I$ is the measured magnitude of the inward current, which is consistent with this formulation.\n\nTo derive the expression for $\\gamma$, we substitute the expressions for $N_{\\mathrm{open}}$ and $|i|$ into the equation for the total macroscopic current $I$:\n$$I = (N_{\\mathrm{channels}} P_O) (\\gamma |V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}|)$$\n\nWe now rearrange this equation algebraically to isolate the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$.\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{I}{N_{\\mathrm{channels}} P_O |V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}|}$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the single-channel conductance derived from the fundamental definitions.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\gamma$ by substituting the provided experimental data into this expression.

I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle for determining the onset of regular spiking in a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron under constant current injection relates to the steady-state behavior of the membrane potential. Regular spiking, or repetitive firing, occurs if and only if the membrane potential, in the absence of a spiking threshold, would equilibrate at a value greater than the threshold itself.\n\nThe dynamics of the subthreshold membrane potential $V(t)$ are given by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\tau_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt} \\;=\\; -\\left(V - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right) \\;+\\; R_{m}\\,I_{\\text{photo}}\n$$\nLet us define the effective steady-state potential, $V_{\\infty}$, as the value of $V$ at which the membrane potential would stabilize if the neuron never fired a spike. This fixed point is found by setting the time derivative $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ to zero:\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; -\\left(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right) \\;+\\; R_{m}\\,I_{\\text{photo}}\n$$\nSolving for $V_{\\infty}$, we obtain:\n$$\nV_{\\infty} \\;=\\; V_{\\text{rest}} \\;+\\; R_{m}\\,I_{\\text{photo}}\n$$\nThis equation describes the target potential towards which $V(t)$ evolves from any given state. The neuron starts at rest, $V(0) = V_{\\text{rest}}$. For the neuron to fire a spike, its membrane potential must be able to reach the threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$. Since $V(t)$ will monotonically approach $V_{\\infty}$, it can only cross $V_{\\text{th}}$ if $V_{\\infty} > V_{\\text{th}}$. If $V_{\\infty} \\le V_{\\text{th}}$, the potential will rise from $V_{\\text{rest}}$ and asymptote to $V_{\\infty}$ without ever reaching the threshold, and thus no spike will be generated (beyond the first, if the initial state were above threshold, which is not the case here).\n\nFor regular, repetitive spiking to occur, after each spike and reset to $V_{\\text{reset}} = V_{\\text{rest}}$, the potential must again be able to rise and reach $V_{\\text{th}}$. This is guaranteed if and only if $V_{\\infty} > V_{\\text{th}}$.\n\nThe minimum photocurrent required to produce regular spiking, which we denote as $I_{\\text{photo, min}}$, corresponds to the boundary condition where the steady-state potential is exactly equal to the spike threshold.
