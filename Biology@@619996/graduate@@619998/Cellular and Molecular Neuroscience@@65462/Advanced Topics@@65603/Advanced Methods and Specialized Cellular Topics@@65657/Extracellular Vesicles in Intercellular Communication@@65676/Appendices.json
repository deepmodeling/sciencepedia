This practice focuses on designing an isopycnic ultracentrifugation protocol, a gold-standard technique that separates particles based on their buoyant density.

By Archimedes’ principle, a particle reaches its isopycnic position where the local medium density equals the particle’s buoyant density, that is, where $ \\rho_{\\mathrm{medium}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{particle}} $. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) typically have buoyant densities in the range $1.10$–$1.19$ g/mL, whereas low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have buoyant densities in the range $1.02$–$1.06$ g/mL. The density of iodixanol solutions is well approximated as a linear function of iodixanol concentration $C$ (percent weight/volume) over $0$–$60\\%$ at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, with calibration points $ \\rho(0\\%) = 1.000 $ g/mL and $ \\rho(60\\%) = 1.320 $ g/mL.\n\nDesign a continuous iodixanol gradient for isopycnic separation of extracellular vesicles from lipoproteins by choosing the narrowest density span that fully includes the EV buoyant density interval while excluding all LDL/HDL buoyant densities.

Therefore, to separate extracellular vesicles (EVs) from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the gradient must be designed so that EVs find isopycnic positions within the gradient while LDL/HDL do not. Since EV buoyant densities lie in $[1.10,\\,1.19]$ g/mL and lipoprotein densities lie in $[1.02,\\,1.06]$ g/mL, the narrowest density span that achieves this is to set the gradient’s density range exactly to the EV interval:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\min} = 1.10\\ \\text{g/mL}, \\qquad \\rho_{\\max} = 1.19\\ \\text{g/mL}.\n$$\nWith this choice, EVs at all buoyant densities in the EV interval will band within the gradient, while LDL/HDL with $ \\rho \\leq 1.06 $ g/mL will have no isopycnic position inside the gradient and thus be excluded.\n\nNext, we convert these target densities to iodixanol concentrations using the linear calibration.
