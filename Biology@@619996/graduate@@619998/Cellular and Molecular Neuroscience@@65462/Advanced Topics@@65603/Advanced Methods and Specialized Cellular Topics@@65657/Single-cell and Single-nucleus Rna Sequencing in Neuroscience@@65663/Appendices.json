Cellular compartmentalization, specifically the distinct molecular contents of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria.\n    3.  The fundamental difference in sample preparation: snRNA-seq isolates nuclei, capturing nuclear RNA, while scRNA-seq uses intact cells, capturing total cellular RNA (nuclear and cytoplasmic).\n    4.  The primer strategy uses poly(deoxythymidine), which targets the polyadenylated (poly(A)) tails of RNA transcripts.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It describes a standard scenario in genomics based on established techniques (scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq) and established biological principles (Central Dogma, cellular compartmentalization). The data provided ($40\\%$ intronic reads, $<5\\%$ mitochondrial reads) are realistic values observed in practice for one of the two methods. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to deduce a logically consistent answer. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with a solution based on first principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine the origin of the RNA sequencing library—single cells or single nuclei—based on the provided mapping metrics. The reasoning must be built upon the fundamental principles stipulated.\n\n1.  **RNA Life Cycle and Localization**: According to the Central Dogma, genes are transcribed from DNA into precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) within the nucleus. This pre-mRNA contains both coding sequences (exons) and non-coding intervening sequences (introns). A key process, also predominantly nuclear, is splicing, where introns are excised from the pre-mRNA to form mature messenger RNA (mRNA). Most pre-mRNAs are polyadenylated at their $3'$ end, a modification that is recognized by the poly(deoxythymidine) primers used in library preparation. Crucially, splicing is not always complete before polyadenylation. Therefore, the nucleus contains a significant population of unspliced or partially spliced, polyadenylated pre-mRNAs that are rich in intronic sequences. In contrast, the cytoplasm is the destination for fully spliced, mature mRNA, which is almost entirely exonic.\n\n2.  **Mitochondrial RNA Localization**: Mitochondria are organelles located within the cytoplasm. They possess their own circular genome and an independent machinery for transcription. The resulting mitochondrial transcripts, including mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (mt-rRNAs) and mitochondrial mRNAs (which are also polyadenylated in mammals), are confined within the mitochondria, and thus are part of the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell.\n\n3.  **Predicted Signatures of snRNA-seq vs. scRNA-seq**:\n    -   **Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq)**: This technique begins with the physical isolation of nuclei from the cellular milieu. The cytoplasm, and all its contents—including mitochondria and the vast majority of mature mRNA—are discarded. The RNA captured for sequencing is therefore almost exclusively of nuclear origin. Consequently, an snRNA-seq library is expected to be highly enriched in pre-mRNA relative to mature mRNA. This leads to a characteristically **high fraction of reads mapping to introns**. Furthermore, due to the exclusion of the cytoplasm, the library will be severely depleted of mitochondrial transcripts, resulting in a **very low fraction of reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome**.\n    -   **Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq)**: This technique uses whole, intact cells. The RNA captured represents the total RNA content of the cell, from both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. While nuclear pre-mRNAs are captured, the total RNA pool is typically dominated by the far more abundant mature mRNAs residing in the cytoplasm. This dilution of nuclear content by cytoplasmic content means that an scRNA-seq library is expected to have a **low fraction of reads mapping to introns**. Since the cytoplasm is preserved, mitochondrial transcripts will be captured, leading to a **significant, non-negligible fraction of reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome**. A typical range for healthy cells might be $5-25\\%$.\n\n4.  **Inference from a Priori Data**:\n    -   The observed intronic fraction is high, approximately $40\\%$. This value is inconsistent with the expected low intronic fraction of scRNA-seq and is highly characteristic of the pre-mRNA enrichment found in snRNA-seq.\n    -   The observed mitochondrial fraction is low, $<5\\%$. This is inconsistent with the significant mitochondrial content expected from intact cells in scRNA-seq but is precisely what is expected from an snRNA-seq preparation where mitochondria have been removed along with the cytoplasm.\n\nConclusion: Both metrics independently and cohesively support the inference that the library was generated using **single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq); nuclear isolation enriches unspliced pre-mRNA, increasing intronic alignments, and excludes mitochondria, decreasing mitochondrial reads.**\nThis option correctly identifies the method as snRNA-seq. The reasoning provided is precisely aligned with the derivation from first principles. Nuclear isolation enriches for nuclear-localized unspliced pre-mRNA, which explains the high ($40\\%$) intronic read fraction. The same isolation process excludes cytoplasmic mitochondria, explaining the low ($<5\\%$) mitochondrial read fraction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq); poly(deoxythymidine) priming frequently captures unspliced nuclear RNA, causing high intronic alignments, and low mitochondrial reads indicate healthy intact cells.**\nThis option incorrectly identifies the method as scRNA-seq. The reasoning is flawed. While poly(dT) priming does capture some pre-mRNA, a $40\\%$ intronic fraction is far too high for a typical scRNA-seq library, which is dominated by cytoplasmic mRNA. Furthermore, a mitochondrial fraction of $<5\\%$ is too low for scRNA-seq of healthy cells; it is more indicative of the *absence* of cytoplasm, not its healthy state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Ambiguous; intronic fraction and mitochondrial content are dominated by ambient RNA contamination and cannot distinguish scRNA-seq from snRNA-seq.**\nThis option claims ambiguity, which is contrary to our strong deductive conclusion. While ambient RNA is a technical artifact, it does not typically produce such a clean and extreme signature ($40\\%$ intronic and $<5\\%$ mitochondrial). These metrics are primary, well-established indicators used precisely to distinguish between these two protocols. The premise that they cannot be used for this distinction is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq); intact cytoplasm increases the intronic fraction, whereas isolated nuclei are depleted of intronic reads and thus have predominantly exonic alignments.**\nThis option incorrectly identifies the method as scRNA-seq and provides reasoning that is factually inverted. The cytoplasm, containing spliced mRNA, *decreases* the overall intronic fraction of a library. Isolated nuclei, containing pre-mRNA, are *enriched* for intronic sequences, not depleted of them. The entire biological basis of this option's argument is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2752261"}, {"introduction": "Single-cell experiments using complex tissues like the central nervous system are frequently affected by technical artifacts, such as ambient RNA released from cells lysed during dissociation.

Because myelin debris is lipid-rich and contains little RNA, any detected *Mbp*/*Mog* transcripts in non-oligodendrocytes must reflect true injury-induced ectopic transcription; retain these signals and instead regress out only the mitochondrial transcript fraction, as that is the principal confounder of ambient RNA.\n\nC.

The scenario described—ambient RNA contamination from myelin debris in dissociated central nervous system tissue—is a well-documented and highly realistic technical challenge in the field of neuroscience. The gene markers listed for each cell type are canonical and widely accepted.\n- **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem presents a clear set of empirical observations and asks for their interpretation and a corresponding procedural solution for data processing. All information is presented objectively as quantitative metrics or direct observations (\"the analyst notes\"). The question is specific and answerable.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The provided information is internally consistent and sufficient for forming a reasoned conclusion. The observation of visible myelin debris (Cause) is logically linked to the molecular data showing myelin-gene-rich ambient RNA (Effect). The crucial negative correlation provided (myelin score vs. mitochondrial fraction) allows for the disambiguation of different potential artifacts. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It describes a realistic and non-trivial problem in scRNA-seq data analysis. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in distinguishing a true biological signal from a technical artifact. The physical process of droplet-based scRNA-seq involves encapsulating single cells in aqueous droplets along with lysis buffer and barcoded beads. However, the aqueous medium itself is not pure buffer; it is the cell suspension medium, which contains free-floating molecules from cells that lysed during tissue dissociation. This \"ambient RNA\" is also captured in droplets, both those with and without a cell.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Contamination Signature:** The problem states that myelin debris was abundant. Myelin sheaths are produced by oligodendrocytes and are rich in specific mRNAs for myelin proteins (*Mbp*, *Plp1*, etc.). Harsh dissociation lyses many oligodendrocytes, releasing these abundant and stable mRNAs into the suspension, creating an ambient RNA pool dominated by a myelin gene signature.\n    -   Droplets containing a non-oligodendrocyte cell (e.g., an astrocyte) will capture the astrocyte’s endogenous transcriptome *plus* a sample of the ambient myelin-rich RNA. This results in the observed \"widespread low-to-moderate expression\" of myelin genes in non-oligodendrocyte clusters.\n    -   Droplets containing no cell (\"empty\" droplets) will capture *only* the ambient RNA. The observation that the empty droplet profile is enriched for myelin genes and correlates with the signal in non-oligodendrocyte clusters is the definitive evidence that this signal is an artifact of ambient RNA contamination, not true ectopic gene expression.\n    -   The mitochondrial transcript fraction is a marker of cell stress and apoptosis, but the problem explicitly states it does not correlate with the myelin contamination. This indicates that general cell quality and specific ambient RNA contamination are two distinct issues in this dataset.\n\n2.  **Mitigating the Contamination:** An appropriate strategy must remove or reduce the artifactual signal without destroying the true biological signal.\n    -   **Preserve True Signal:** Oligodendrocyte clusters are defined by their high endogenous expression of myelin genes (median module score $\\approx 0.25$). These cells represent a true biological population and must be preserved. Any strategy that removes them is fundamentally flawed.\n    -   **Remove Ambient RNA Signal:** Since the profile of the contaminating RNA is known from the empty droplets, computational methods can be used to estimate and subtract this ambient signal from each cell's expression profile. This is the most direct and specific solution.\n    -   **Handle Mixed-Cell Artifacts (Doublets):** Some droplets may have captured two cells, such as an astrocyte and an oligodendrocyte. These \"doublets\" will show a hybrid expression profile and often have unusually high UMI counts. They are another type of artifact and should be identified and removed using doublet detection algorithms.\n    -   **Refine Cell Quality Control:** After ambient RNA correction, some individual non-oligodendrocyte cells may still show an anomalously high myelin module score (e.g., in the right tail of the distribution, score $> 0.03$). These could be remaining doublets or otherwise contaminated cells and may be filtered out as outliers, but this must be done carefully to avoid removing a rare cell type.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **A. Treat the widespread, low-level expression of *Mbp*/*Plp1*/*Mog* in microglia, astrocytes, and vascular clusters as a contamination signature when it mirrors the empty-droplet background; estimate and remove ambient RNA using decontamination methods (e.g., profile-informed subtraction), then, for cells not annotated to the oligodendrocyte lineage, filter those with an outlier myelin module fraction (for example, above approximately $3$ standard deviations of their cluster’s distribution), and re-cluster after doublet removal.**\n    -   This option correctly identifies the signature of ambient RNA contamination by linking the expression in non-oligodendrocyte cells to the empty-droplet background. It proposes the correct primary mitigation strategy: computational ambient RNA decontamination. It also correctly includes subsequent steps of doublet removal and targeted filtering of remaining outlier cells, while implicitly preserving the true oligodendrocyte population by only filtering non-oligodendrocyte cells. This represents a complete and correct workflow.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Because myelin debris is lipid-rich and contains little RNA, any detected *Mbp*/*Mog* transcripts in non-oligodendrocytes must reflect true injury-induced ectopic transcription; retain these signals and instead regress out only the mitochondrial transcript fraction, as that is the principal confounder of ambient RNA.**\n    -   The premise \"myelin debris... contains little RNA\" is factually incorrect. Myelin sheaths are metabolically active cytoplasmic extensions containing abundant and stable mRNAs. The conclusion that the signal must be \"true injury-induced ectopic transcription\" ignores the primary evidence provided in the problem—the correlation with the empty droplet profile. Furthermore, it proposes regressing the mitochondrial transcript fraction, a strategy explicitly invalidated by the observation that this metric does not track the myelin contamination.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Use the mitochondrial transcript fraction as the primary indicator of myelin contamination and filter all cells with mitochondrial fraction greater than $5\\%$, regardless of cell type and expression of myelin genes, since high mitochondrial load is the hallmark of myelin debris.**\n    -   This option is directly contradicted by the problem statement, which specifies that the mitochondrial transcript fraction \"does not track the myelin module score\". Therefore, using it as an indicator for myelin contamination is illogical. While filtering on mitochondrial fraction is a common QC step for cell viability, it is not the correct tool for this specific contamination problem.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Remove all barcodes with high expression of myelin genes to ensure no contamination remains, including those in oligodendrocyte clusters, and downsample oligodendrocyte cells to match the number of microglia to prevent bias from cell type abundance differences.**\n    -   This proposal is catastrophic. Removing all barcodes with high expression of myelin genes would eliminate the entire *bona fide* oligodendrocyte population, destroying a key component of the biological system. This conflates the true signal with the artifact. Downsampling is irrelevant to the problem of contamination removal.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Compute a myelin gene module score and flag non-oligodendrocyte cells with disproportionately high module scores especially when accompanied by low total UMIs and low detected gene counts; apply an ambient RNA correction that leverages the empty-droplet profile and perform doublet detection to remove oligodendrocyte–non-oligodendrocyte hybrids before differential expression on decontaminated, normalized data; retain oligodendrocyte clusters with high myelin gene expression as true positives.**\n    -   This option correctly proposes the main solutions: ambient RNA correction using the empty droplet profile and doublet detection. Crucially, it explicitly states that true oligodendrocyte clusters with high myelin expression must be retained, correctly identifying them as \"true positives\". It also correctly identifies problematic non-oligodendrocyte cells as those with disproportionately high scores. This constitutes a sound and logical approach. The mention of \"low total UMIs\" is a reasonable heuristic for identifying droplets that are mostly just ambient RNA content, though doublets would have high UMIs. The overall logic is sound.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth options A and E describe correct and complementary aspects of a state-of-the-art workflow for addressing this specific and common scRNA-seq artifact. They correctly identify the signatures and propose appropriate, multi-step computational solutions that clean the data while preserving the true biological signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2752273"}, {"introduction": "Beyond providing a static snapshot of gene expression, single-cell transcriptomics can be used to infer the dynamics of cellular processes like differentiation and maturation.
