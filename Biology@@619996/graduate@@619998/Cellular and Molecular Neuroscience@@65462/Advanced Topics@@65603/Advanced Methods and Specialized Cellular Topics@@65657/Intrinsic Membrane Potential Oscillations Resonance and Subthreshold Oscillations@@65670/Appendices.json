The derivative of $|Z(f)|$ with respect to $f$ is always negative for $f > 0$, confirming the absence of any local maximum. This behavior is typical for first-order linear systems, which lack the necessary complexity (e.g., an inductive element or its biophysical equivalent) to produce resonance.\n\n**Part 2: Attenuation Factor**\nThe attenuation factor $A$ is the ratio of the voltage response magnitude at $f_2 = 50\\,\\text{Hz}$ to that at $f_1 = 1\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n$$\nA = \\frac{|V(f_2)|}{|V(f_1)|} = \\frac{|I_0| \\cdot |Z(f_2)|}{|I_0| \\cdot |Z(f_1)|} = \\frac{|Z(f_2)|}{|Z(f_1)|}\n$$\nUsing the expression for $|Z(f)|$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\frac{R_m}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_2 \\tau_m)^2}}}{\\frac{R_m}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_1 \\tau_m)^2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_1 \\tau_m)^2}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_2 \\tau_m)^2}}\n$$\nWe are given $\\tau_m = 20\\,\\text{ms} = 0.02\\,\\text{s}$, $f_1 = 1\\,\\text{Hz}$, and $f_2 = 50\\,\\text{Hz}$.\nFirst, we compute the necessary terms:\n$$\n2\\pi f_1 \\tau_m = 2\\pi (1) (0.02) = 0.04\\pi\n$$\n$$\n2\\pi f_2 \\tau_m = 2\\pi (50) (0.02) = 2\\pi\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + (0.04\\pi)^2}{1 + (2\\pi)^2}}\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\nA = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 0.0016\\pi^2}{1 + 4\\pi^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 0.015791}{1 + 39.478418}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.015791}{40.478418}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0250945} \\approx 0.1584124\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the attenuation factor is $A = 0.1584$.\n\nThis result quantifies the low-pass filtering property of the passive membrane.

It represents a standard exercise in the linear systems analysis of a simplified but biophysically relevant neuronal model. The given parameters are within a physically plausible range. We may, therefore, proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the conservation of current at the neuron's membrane. For an injected current $I(t)$, the total current must be distributed among the capacitive pathway and the various ionic pathways. In the linearized subthreshold regime, this is expressed as:\n$$\nI(t) = I_C(t) + I_L(t) + I_M(t)\n$$\nHere, $I_C(t)$ is the capacitive current, $I_L(t)$ is the passive leak current, and $I_M(t)$ is the M-type potassium current.

The linearized equation is:\n$$ C \\frac{dv}{dt} = -g_L v - i_{\\text{ion}} + i_{\\text{app}} $$\nThe active current $I_{\\text{ion}} = \\bar{g} w (V - E_{\\text{ion}})$ has a gating variable $w$ with dynamics $\\tau_w \\frac{dw}{dt} = w_{\\infty}(V) - w$. Linearizing the current and the gating dynamics around the resting state $(V_0, w_0 = w_{\\infty}(V_0))$ yields a system of two linear differential equations for the perturbations $v$ and $w' = w - w_0$:\n$$ C \\frac{dv}{dt} = -(g_L + g_{w,0}) v - g_w(V_0 - E_{\\text{ion}}) w' + i_{\\text{app}} $$\n$$ \\tau_w \\frac{dw'}{dt} = \\left. \\frac{dw_{\\infty}}{dV} \\right|_{V_0} v - w' $$\nwhere $g_{w,0} = \\bar{g} w_0$ is the instantaneous conductance of the active current at rest, and $g_w = \\bar{g}$.\n\n**Part 1: Frequency Domain Analysis (Impedance and Phase)**\n\nTo analyze the response to a sinusoidal current $i_{\\text{app}}(t) = I_0 e^{j\\omega t}$ (with $\\omega = 2\\pi f$), we transform the system into the frequency domain. Let $v(t) = \\tilde{v} e^{j\\omega t}$ and $w'(t) = \\tilde{w}' e^{j\\omega t}$. The algebraic equations are:\n$$ j\\omega C \\tilde{v} = -(g_L + g_{w,0}) \\tilde{v} - g_w(V_0 - E_{\\text{ion}}) \\tilde{w}' + \\tilde{i}_{\\text{app}} $$\n$$ j\\omega \\tau_w \\tilde{w}' = \\left. \\frac{dw_{\\infty}}{dV} \\right|_{V_0} \\tilde{v} - \\tilde{w}' $$\nFrom the second equation, we find $\\tilde{w}' = \\frac{(dw_{\\infty}/dV|_{V_0}) \\tilde{v}}{1 + j\\omega \\tau_w}$. Substituting this into the first equation and solving for the impedance $Z(\\omega) = \\tilde{v} / \\tilde{i}_{\\text{app}}$ gives:\n$$ Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{g_L + g_{w,0} + j\\omega C + \\frac{g_w (V_0 - E_{\\text{ion}}) (dw_{\\infty}/dV|_{V_0})}{1 + j\\omega \\tau_w}} $$\nLet us define a quantity $g_1 = g_w (V_0 - E_{\\text{ion}}) (dw_{\\infty}/dV|_{V_0})$. The admittance $Y(\\omega) = 1/Z(\\omega)$ is:\n$$ Y(\\omega) = g_{tot,0} + j\\omega C + \\frac{g_1}{1 + j\\omega \\tau_w} $$\nwhere $g_{tot,0} = g_L + g_{w,0}$. The imaginary part of the admittance for small $\\omega$ is:\n$$ \\text{Im}[Y(\\omega)] = \\omega C - \\frac{g_1 \\omega \\tau_w}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_w)^2} \\approx \\omega ( C - g_1 \\tau_w ) \\quad \\text{for } \\omega \\to 0^+ $$\nThe phase of the impedance is $\\phi(\\omega) = -\\arg[Y(\\omega)]$. Since the real part of $Y(\\omega)$ is always positive, the sign of $\\phi(\\omega)$ for small $\\omega$ is opposite to the sign of $\\text{Im}[Y(\\omega)]$. Thus, $\\text{sign}[\\phi(\\omega \\to 0^+)] = \\text{sign}[g_1 \\tau_w - C]$.\n\nThe problem states that both currents produce subthreshold resonance. Resonance in this type of linear system arises when the active current provides a slow negative feedback that acts as an effective inductance, which can cancel the capacitive reactance at a specific frequency. This requires the imaginary part of the admittance to be negative at low frequencies and positive at high frequencies. This condition is $\\text{Im}[Y(\\omega \\to 0^+)]  0$, which implies $C - g_1 \\tau_w  0$, or $g_1 \\tau_w  C$.\n\nNow we check the sign of $g_1$ for each case:\n- **Case H (Ih):** $w=h$, $\\tau_w = \\tau_h$. Givens: $E_{\\text{ion}} = E_h = -35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_0 = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $dh_{\\infty}/dV  0$.\n  $g_1 = \\bar{g}_h (V_0 - E_h) (dh_{\\infty}/dV) = \\bar{g}_h (-65 - (-35)) (dh_{\\infty}/dV) = \\bar{g}_h (-30\\,\\mathrm{mV}) (dh_{\\infty}/dV)$.\n  Since $\\bar{g}_h  0$ and $dh_{\\infty}/dV  0$, the sign of $g_1$ is $(+)(−)(−) = +$. So, $g_1  0$.\n- **Case M (IM):** $w=m$, $\\tau_w = \\tau_M$. Givens: $E_{\\text{ion}} = E_K = -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_0 = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $dm_{\\infty}/dV  0$.\n  $g_1 = \\bar{g}_M (V_0 - E_K) (dm_{\\infty}/dV) = \\bar{g}_M (-65 - (-90)) (dm_{\\infty}/dV) = \\bar{g}_M (+25\\,\\mathrm{mV}) (dm_{\\infty}/dV)$.\n  Since $\\bar{g}_M  0$ and $dm_{\\infty}/dV  0$, the sign of $g_1$ is $(+)(+)(+) = +$. So, $g_1  0$.\n\nFor both currents, $g_1  0$. The condition for resonance is $g_1 \\tau_w  C$. Since resonance is stated to occur, this condition must hold for both neurons. Therefore, for both cases, $g_1\\tau_w - C  0$. This implies that for both Ih and IM, the low-frequency phase must be positive: $\\lim_{f \\to 0^+} \\phi(f)  0$. This indicates that at low frequencies, the voltage leads the current, a characteristic of inductive behavior.\n\n**Part 2: Time Domain Analysis (Voltage Sag)**\n\nVoltage sag is a slow depolarizing creep in membrane potential that follows the initial, rapid hyperpolarization caused by a hyperpolarizing current step $I(t) = -I_s H(t)$. This behavior is governed by the slow activation or deactivation of voltage-gated currents.\n\n- **Case H (Ih):** The stimulus is a hyperpolarizing step from $V_0 = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The activation of Ih increases with hyperpolarization ($dh_{\\infty}/dV  0$), and its half-activation is at $V_{1/2}^h \\approx -80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. When the potential hyperpolarizes from $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, it moves *towards* the activation range of Ih. This causes $h_{\\infty}(V)$ to increase, so the gating variable $h(t)$ will slowly increase. The reversal potential $E_h = -35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is well above the resting and hyperpolarized potentials, making Ih an inward, depolarizing current. The slow increase in $h(t)$ thus causes a slow increase in the inward current, which opposes the injected hyperpolarizing current and causes the membrane potential to \"sag\" back towards rest. This effect will be robust because the voltage is driven into the main operating range of the Ih channel.\n\n- **Case M (IM):** The stimulus is a hyperpolarizing step from $V_0 = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The activation of IM increases with depolarization ($dm_{\\infty}/dV  0$), with a half-activation at $V_{1/2}^M \\approx -35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. At the resting potential of $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the neuron is already $30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ below the half-activation voltage of IM. This means the M-current is substantially deactivated at rest (i.e., $m_{\\infty}(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV})$ is very small). When the membrane is further hyperpolarized, it moves even *further away* from the activation range of IM. This will cause the already small M-conductance to decrease further ($m(t)$ slowly decreases). The reversal potential $E_K = -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ means IM is an outward, hyperpolarizing current (for $V  -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). A slow decrease in an outward current is a depolarizing influence, which would in principle cause a sag. However, because the M-conductance is almost zero to begin with at $V_0=-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the absolute change in current during a small hyperpolarizing step will be negligible. Consequently, any resulting voltage sag will be minimal or absent.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Ih: $\\lim_{f \\to 0^+} \\phi(f)  0$ and robust hyperpolarizing sag is present; IM: $\\lim_{f \\to 0^+} \\phi(f)  0$ but hyperpolarizing sag is minimal or absent near $V_0$.**\n  - Ih phase: Correct, as derived from the resonance condition.\n  - Ih sag: Correct, as hyperpolarization drives the voltage into the activation range of Ih.\n  - IM phase: Correct, as derived from the resonance condition.\n  - IM sag: Correct, as hyperpolarization from $V_0$ moves the voltage away from the activation range of IM, where the current is already negligible.\n  - This option is fully consistent with the analysis. **Correct**.\n\n- **B.
