There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a straightforward application of established principles of enzyme kinetics. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fractional activation $f([\\text{Ca}^{2+}])$ of the enzyme DAGL-$\\alpha$. The activation is governed by the cooperative binding of $n$ calcium ions to the enzyme's regulatory module. This process can be modeled by the Hill equation.\n\nLet $E$ represent the enzyme and $L$ represent the ligand, which in this case is $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. The simplified cooperative binding reaction is:\n$$ E + nL \\rightleftharpoons EL_n $$\nwhere $EL_n$ is the active enzyme-ligand complex.\n\nThe fractional activation, $f([L])$, is defined as the fraction of enzyme molecules in the active, ligand-bound state. This is equivalent to the fractional occupancy of the binding sites.\n$$ f([L]) = \\frac{[EL_n]}{[E]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[EL_n]}{[E] + [EL_n]} $$\nFrom the law of mass action, we can define an apparent macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the overall binding reaction:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[E][L]^n}{[EL_n]} $$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the concentration of free enzyme, $[E]$:\n$$ [E] = \\frac{K_d [EL_n]}{[L]^n} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for fractional activation:\n$$ f([L]) = \\frac{[EL_n]}{\\frac{K_d [EL_n]}{[L]^n} + [EL_n]} $$\nThe term $[EL_n]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ f([L]) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_d + [L]^n} $$\nThe \"sensitivity constant\" $K_{\\text{Ca}}$ is defined as the ligand concentration that produces half-maximal activation, so $f([L]) = 0.5$ when $[L] = K_{\\text{Ca}}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ 0.5 = \\frac{(K_{\\text{Ca}})^n}{K_d + (K_{\\text{Ca}})^n} $$\n$$ 0.5(K_d + (K_{\\text{Ca}})^n) = (K_{\\text{Ca}})^n $$\n$$ 0.5 K_d = 0.5 (K_{\\text{Ca}})^n $$\n$$ K_d = (K_{\\text{Ca}})^n $$\nBy substituting $K_d = (K_{\\text{Ca}})^n$ and replacing the generic ligand $L$ with $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, we arrive at the Hill equation for the fractional activation of DAGL-$\\alpha$:\n$$ f([\\text{Ca}^{2+}]) = \\frac{([\\text{Ca}^{2+}])^n}{(K_{\\text{Ca}})^n + ([\\text{Ca}^{2+}])^n} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNow, we use this expression to calculate the fractional activation at the specified calcium concentrations, using the given parameters $K_{\\text{Ca}} = 300\\,\\text{nM}$ and $n = 2$.\n\nCase 1: $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$.\nThe fractional activation, $f_{100}$, is:\n$$ f_{100} = \\frac{(100)^2}{(300)^2 + (100)^2} = \\frac{10000}{90000 + 10000} = \\frac{10000}{100000} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\nThe problem states that 2-AG synthesis is limited only by the catalytic state, which means the reaction rate per enzyme, $v$, is the maximal catalytic rate, $k_{\\text{cat}}$, multiplied by the fraction of active enzymes, $f$.\n$$ v = f \\times k_{\\text{cat}} $$\nGiven $k_{\\text{cat}} = 5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, the rate per enzyme at $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$, denoted $v_{100}$, is:\n$$ v_{100} = f_{100} \\times k_{\\text{cat}} = 0.1 \\times 5\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nCase 2: $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 600\\,\\text{nM}$.\nThe fractional activation, $f_{600}$, is:\n$$ f_{600} = \\frac{(600)^2}{(300)^2 + (600)^2} = \\frac{360000}{90000 + 360000} = \\frac{360000}{450000} = \\frac{36}{45} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$\nThe rate per enzyme at $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 600\\,\\text{nM}$, denoted $v_{600}$, is:\n$$ v_{600} = f_{600} \\times k_{\\text{cat}} = 0.8 \\times 5\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 4.0\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\n- Fractional activation at $100\\,\\text{nM}$: $f_{100} = 0.1 \\rightarrow 0.1000$\n- Relative rate at $100\\,\\text{nM}$: $v_{100} = 0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\rightarrow 0.5000\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Fractional activation at $600\\,\\text{nM}$: $f_{600} = 0.8 \\rightarrow 0.8000$\n- Relative rate at $600\\,\\text{nM}$: $v_{600} = 4.0\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\rightarrow 4.000\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nThese four values are to be reported in a single $1 \\times 4$ row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1000 & 0.5000 & 0.8000 & 4.000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$"}]}
