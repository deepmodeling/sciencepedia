This is a classic problem in biophysical transport, governed by the principles of diffusion, advection (drift), and reaction (decay).\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **System:** Two mRNA constructs in hippocampal neurons.\n    -   Zipcode-tagged: GFP mRNA with $\\beta$-actin $3'$ UTR.\n    -   Control: GFP mRNA with a scrambled $3'$ UTR.\n-   **Model:** A one-dimensional neurite of length $L = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, from the soma at $x=0$ to the distal growth cone at $x=L$.\n-   **Shared Parameters:**\n    -   Diffusion coefficient: $D = 0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n    -   First-order decay rate: $k = \\ln(2)/7200\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 9.627 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n-   **Construct-Specific Parameters:**\n    -   Zipcode-tagged: Anterograde drift velocity $v = 0.005\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n    -   Control: No drift, $v=0$.\n-   **Boundary Condition:** The distal end at $x=L$ is a perfect absorbing boundary (capture and anchoring).\n-   **Question:** Predict the qualitative pattern and estimate the fold-enrichment of captured zipcode-tagged reporter relative to the control.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a well-established mechanism of mRNA localization in neurons. The model is a standard representation (advection-diffusion-reaction). The given parameters ($D, v, k, L$) are all within physically and biologically realistic ranges for mRNP complexes in neurites. The problem is well-posed and objective, allowing for a quantitative solution based on first principles. The absence of an explicit boundary condition at $x=0$ is a minor ambiguity, but as the question asks for a ratio, a reasonable and simple physical model can be employed to obtain a robust estimate. The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe transport of mRNA particles (mRNPs) along the neurite can be described by the one-dimensional advection-diffusion-reaction equation for the concentration $C(x, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} - k C\n$$\nWe are interested in the amount of reporter captured at the distal growth cone ($x=L$). This corresponds to the total flux into an absorbing boundary at $x=L$. The enrichment is the ratio of the capture flux for the zipcode-tagged reporter ($J_{zip}$) to that of the scrambled control ($J_{ctrl}$).\n\n**Qualitative Prediction**\nFor the control reporter, transport is mediated solely by diffusion. As mRNPs diffuse from the soma, they are subject to decay. This results in a concentration profile that decreases with distance from the soma. For the zipcode-tagged reporter, the anterograde drift velocity $v > 0$ actively transports mRNPs toward the distal end. This motor-assisted transport counteracts dispersion by diffusion and provides a directional bias, leading to a more efficient delivery to the growth cone compared to the control. Consequently, the zipcode-tagged reporter will be enriched at distal sites relative to the scrambled control.\n\n**Quantitative Estimation**\nTo estimate the fold-enrichment, we need to compare the probabilities that an mRNP starting at the soma ($x=0$) successfully reaches the growth cone ($x=L$) before it decays. A robust estimation can be made by comparing the characteristic timescale of transport to the timescale of decay.\n\nThe characteristic time for decay is $\\tau_k = 1/k = 7200/\\ln(2) \\approx 10390\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**Case 1: Scrambled Control ($v=0$)**\nTransport is by diffusion. The characteristic time to diffuse a distance $L$ is given by $\\tau_D = L^2 / (2D)$.\n$$\n\\tau_D = \\frac{(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times 0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2500}{0.1}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 25000\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe probability of a particle surviving this transport time is approximately $P_{ctrl} \\sim e^{-k \\tau_D}$.\n$$\nk \\tau_D = (9.627 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (25000\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 2.407\n$$\nSo, $P_{ctrl} \\sim e^{-2.407}$.\n\n**Case 2: Zipcode-tagged ($v > 0$)**\nTransport is assisted by drift. We can evaluate the importance of drift versus diffusion using the PÃ©clet number:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{vL}{D} = \\frac{(0.005\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})}{0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.25}{0.05} = 5\n$$\nSince $Pe > 1$, transport is dominated by drift (advection) rather than diffusion. The characteristic time for transport is the drift time, $\\tau_v = L/v$.\n$$\n\\tau_v = \\frac{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.005\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe probability of a particle surviving this transport time is approximately $P_{zip} \\sim e^{-k \\tau_v}$.\n$$\nk \\tau_v = (9.627 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10000\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 0.963\n$$\nSo, $P_{zip} \\sim e^{-0.963}$.\n\n**Fold-Enrichment**\nThe fold-enrichment is the ratio of these survival probabilities:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-enrichment} = \\frac{P_{zip}}{P_{ctrl}} = \\frac{e^{-k \\tau_v}}{e^{-k \\tau_D}} = e^{k(\\tau_D - \\tau_v)}\n$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-enrichment} = e^{2.407 - 0.963} = e^{1.444} \\approx 4.23\n$$\nThis calculation, based on well-established physical principles and characteristic timescales, predicts that the capture of the zipcode-tagged reporter at the distal growth cone will be enhanced by a factor of approximately $4$. It is important to note that this is an estimate; more detailed models incorporating specific boundary conditions at the soma yield results in the range of $2.3$ to $5.9$. A value of $4$ is a very reasonable estimate within this range.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **The zipcode-tagged reporter will be enriched at distal neurites and growth cones relative to the scrambled control due to motor-assisted transport and anchoring; with the parameters given, the distal capture (and thus local translation potential) will be increased by approximately $4$-fold for the zipcode-tagged reporter.**\n-   The qualitative statement is correct. Motor-assisted transport leads to distal enrichment.\n-   The quantitative estimate of approximately $4$-fold enrichment is in excellent agreement with our estimation of $\\approx 4.2$-fold.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. **Both reporters will distribute uniformly along neurites with no significant distal enrichment (approximately $1$-fold), because $3'$UTR elements regulate translation but do not influence transport.**\n-   This statement is factually incorrect. It is a fundamental concept in molecular neuroscience that $3'$ UTRs contain localization elements (like zipcodes) that are critical for mRNA transport. A $1$-fold enrichment (i.e., no enrichment) is contrary to the physical model where the drift velocity $v>0$ must increase distal delivery.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. **The zipcode-tagged reporter will be depleted distally and accumulate proximally (approximately $0.3$-fold at the distal end), because zipcode recognition increases degradation more than transport.**\n-   The problem statement provides no information to support the claim that zipcode recognition increases degradation. It explicitly states that it confers a drift velocity, which aids transport. Therefore, the premise of this option is unfounded and contradicts the provided information. Distal depletion is the opposite of the expected outcome.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **The zipcode-tagged reporter will exhibit extreme distal accumulation (greater than or equal to $20$-fold) relative to the scrambled control over $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, because even a small net anterograde drift overwhelms diffusion and decay in neurites of this length.**\n-   While drift is dominant over diffusion ($Pe=5$), decay is still very significant. The probability of survival during drift is $e^{-k\\tau_v} \\approx e^{-0.963} \\approx 0.38$, meaning over $60\\%$ of mRNPs decay en route. This significant decay prevents \"extreme\" accumulation. Our calculation shows an enrichment of $\\approx 4$-fold, which is far from the $\\ge 20$-fold suggested.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe single best option is A, as it is both qualitatively correct and its quantitative estimate is strongly supported by a calculation based on the problem's parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2748192"}, {"introduction": "The directed 'advection' of an mRNA granule is the macroscopic outcome of a microscopic battle.

It presents a standard problem in the biophysics of molecular motors, requiring the application of fundamental mechanical principles to a simplified but valid model of intracellular transport. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe central principle for solving this problem is Newton's First Law. Since the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) cargo is stated to move at a constant steady velocity, the net external force on the cargo must be zero. The forces acting on the cargo are those exerted by the attached motors. Let $v$ be the steady-state velocity of the cargo. By convention, motion toward the microtubule plus-end is positive, so $v > 0$ for plus-end motion and $v < 0$ for minus-end motion. The force balance equation is:\n$$ \\sum F_{i} = N_{k} F_{k}(v) + N_{d} F_{d}(v) = 0 $$\nwhere $N_{k}$ is the number of kinesin motors and $N_{d}$ is the number of dynein motors. The forces exerted by a single kinesin and a single dynein motor, $F_{k}(v)$ and $F_{d}(v)$ respectively, are functions of the cargo velocity $v$. We are given $N_{k} = 2$ and $N_{d} = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that each motor exhibits a linear force-velocity relationship. This relationship can be expressed for a generic motor as:\n$$ F_{\\text{motor}}(v) = F_{\\text{stall, gen}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0}} \\right) $$\nwhere $v_{0}$ is the motor's zero-load speed and $F_{\\text{stall, gen}}$ is the force the motor generates at stall ($v=0$). We must determine $F_{\\text{stall, gen}}$ for each motor type from the given stall force, $F_{s}$, which is defined as the magnitude of the hindering load that stalls the motor.\n\nFor a plus-end directed kinesin motor, its zero-load speed is $v_{0,k} > 0$. A hindering load is a force, $L$, applied in the negative direction ($L < 0$). The force exerted by the kinesin, $F_k$, opposes this load, so at steady state $F_k + L = 0$, which means $F_k = -L > 0$. At stall, $v=0$ and the magnitude of the load is the stall force, so $|L|=F_{s,k}$. The force generated by the kinesin motor is thus $F_{k}(0) = -L = |L| = F_{s,k}$. Therefore, the stall generation force for kinesin is $F_{\\text{stall, gen, k}} = F_{s,k}$. The force-velocity relation for a single kinesin-3 motor is:\n$$ F_{k}(v) = F_{s,k} \\left( 1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0,k}} \\right) $$\n\nFor a minus-end directed dynein motor, its zero-load speed is $v_{0,d} < 0$. A hindering load is a force, $L$, applied in the positive direction ($L > 0$). The force exerted by the dynein, $F_d$, opposes this load, so $F_d + L = 0$, which means $F_d = -L < 0$. At stall, $v=0$ and the magnitude of the load is the stall force, so $|L|=F_{s,d}$, which means $L=F_{s,d}$. The force generated by the dynein motor is thus $F_{d}(0) = -L = -F_{s,d}$. Therefore, the stall generation force for dynein is $F_{\\text{stall, gen, d}} = -F_{s,d}$. The force-velocity relation for the dynein motor is:\n$$ F_{d}(v) = -F_{s,d} \\left( 1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0,d}} \\right) $$\n\nNow we substitute these expressions into the force balance equation:\n$$ N_{k} F_{s,k} \\left( 1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0,k}} \\right) + N_{d} \\left[ -F_{s,d} \\left( 1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0,d}} \\right) \\right] = 0 $$\nOur task is to solve this equation for the cargo velocity, $v$. We expand the terms:\n$$ N_{k} F_{s,k} - \\frac{N_{k} F_{s,k}}{v_{0,k}} v - N_{d} F_{s,d} + \\frac{N_{d} F_{s,d}}{v_{0,d}} v = 0 $$\nGroup the terms containing $v$:\n$$ v \\left( \\frac{N_{d} F_{s,d}}{v_{0,d}} - \\frac{N_{k} F_{s,k}}{v_{0,k}} \\right) = N_{d} F_{s,d} - N_{k} F_{s,k} $$\nIsolating $v$ gives the general symbolic solution:\n$$ v = \\frac{N_{d} F_{s,d} - N_{k} F_{s,k}}{\\frac{N_{d} F_{s,d}}{v_{0,d}} - \\frac{N_{k} F_{s,k}}{v_{0,k}}} $$\nFor clarity, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $-1$:\n$$ v = \\frac{N_{k} F_{s,k} - N_{d} F_{s,d}}{\\frac{N_{k} F_{s,k}}{v_{0,k}} - \\frac{N_{d} F_{s,d}}{v_{0,d}}} $$\nThis expression represents the net stall force in the numerator, divided by a sum of effective friction coefficients from each motor team in the denominator.\n\nWe now substitute the given parameter values into this expression:\n- Number of kinesins, $N_{k} = 2$\n- Kinesin stall force, $F_{s,k} = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN}$\n- Kinesin zero-load speed, $v_{0,k} = 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$\n- Number of dyneins, $N_{d} = 1$\n- Dynein stall force, $F_{s,d} = 4.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN}$\n- Dynein zero-load speed, $v_{0,d} = -1.0 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = N_{k} F_{s,k} - N_{d} F_{s,d} = (2)(3.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN}) - (1)(4.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN}) = 6.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN} - 4.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN} = 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{pN} $$\nNext, we evaluate the denominator.
