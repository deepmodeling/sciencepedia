The Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) hypothesis is built on the idea of a local, transient \"tag\" at a weakly stimulated synapse and diffusible, global \"plasticity-related proteins\" (PRPs) generated by strong stimulation elsewhere. This problem challenges you to predict the outcome of a classic STC experiment under different pharmacological manipulations, forcing you to dissect the distinct temporal and molecular requirements for tag setting versus PRP synthesis [@problem_id:2722398].", "problem": "A hippocampal slice experiment uses two independent Schaffer collateral inputs, $S1$ and $S2$, converging onto the same population of Cornu Ammonis area 1 (CA1) pyramidal neurons. The following core facts are considered well-established starting points: (i) the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor permits calcium ion ($\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$) influx during coincident presynaptic release and postsynaptic depolarization; (ii) the influx of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) on a subsecond to minute timescale; (iii) early long-term potentiation (LTP) is initiated by rapid post-translational modifications, whereas late LTP requires de novo protein synthesis, consistent with the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein); and (iv) in the synaptic tagging and capture (STC) framework, a weak stimulus can set a transient synaptic “tag,” and a strong stimulus can drive the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) that are diffusible and can be captured by tagged synapses within a limited time window.\n\nIn this two-pathway protocol, a strong high-frequency stimulation is delivered to $S1$ at time $t=0$ to induce late LTP and drive PRP synthesis. A weak tetanus is delivered to $S2$ at $t=+30$ min to set a tag that, in control conditions, captures PRPs and converts an otherwise early, decaying potentiation at $S2$ into a persistent potentiation. You are told that protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways are intact and sufficiently activated by the $S1$ strong stimulus to support PRP synthesis, and that the plasticity-related protein pool is available for approximately $1$–$2$ hours after the $S1$ strong stimulus in control conditions. You may assume that PRPs are produced by translation downstream of activity-dependent signaling and that capture requires a tag coincident with PRP availability.\n\nA highly selective, reversible CaMKII inhibitor is applied in a temporally restricted manner in three separate conditions, with complete washout outside the indicated windows and no off-target effects on NMDA receptors, PKA, or ERK:\n\n- Condition $i$: inhibitor present from $t=+25$ to $+35$ min (centered on the $S2$ weak tetanus).\n- Condition $ii$: inhibitor present from $t=-5$ to $+5$ min (centered on the $S1$ strong stimulus).\n- Condition $iii$: inhibitor present from $t=+60$ to $+70$ min (well after the $S2$ weak tetanus).\n\nAssume that synaptic tagging requires rapid local kinase activity at the tagged synapse near the time of the weak stimulus, whereas PRP synthesis is a cell-wide process driven by strong stimulation engaging PKA/ERK.

Condition $i$ prevents tag setting at $S2$ and abolishes capture there; Condition $ii$ leaves PRP synthesis largely intact, allowing capture at $S2$; Condition $iii$ has minimal effect on a tag that was already set and on capture, provided PRPs remain available.\n\nB. Condition $i$ does not affect tag setting at $S2$; Condition $ii$ prevents PRP synthesis triggered by the $S1$ strong stimulus, abolishing capture; Condition $iii$ eliminates the $S2$ tag because tagging depends on late CaMKII activity long after the weak tetanus.\n\nC. Condition $i$ prevents PRP synthesis; Condition $ii$ selectively blocks tag formation at $S1$ but spares PRP synthesis; Condition $iii$ enhances capture at $S2$ by prolonging tag lifetime.\n\nD.

The roles of NMDA receptors, $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, CaMKII, PKA, and ERK in long-term potentiation are standard textbook material in cellular neuroscience. The experimental design is a classic paradigm used to investigate STC. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The initial conditions, experimental manipulations, and underlying assumptions are explicitly stated. The temporal separation of stimuli ($S1$ and $S2$) and the specific windows of inhibitor application provide a clear framework for deducing the consequences for the distinct components of STC (tag setting, PRP synthesis, and capture). A unique, logical conclusion can be reached.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, technical terminology, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous analysis can proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in dissecting the distinct temporal and molecular requirements for the three key processes of STC: synaptic tagging, PRP synthesis, and capture.\n\n1.  **Synaptic Tagging**: The problem states this \"requires rapid local kinase activity at the tagged synapse near the time of the weak stimulus.\" The weak tetanus at $S2$ at $t=+30$ min induces $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx via NMDA receptors, which, according to fact (ii), activates CaMKII. Therefore, CaMKII activity is the logical candidate for the \"local kinase activity\" required to set the tag. The tag is set at synapse $S2$ around $t=+30$ min.\n\n2.  **PRP Synthesis**: This is a cell-wide process driven by the strong stimulus at $S1$ at $t=0$. The problem explicitly states that \"PKA and ERK pathways are intact and sufficiently activated by the $S1$ strong stimulus to support PRP synthesis.\" Crucially, the CaMKII inhibitor has \"no off-target effects on... PKA, or ERK.\" This designed separation implies that while CaMKII is essential for LTP *induction* at $S1$, the downstream signaling cascade for PRP synthesis (via PKA/ERK) can proceed even if CaMKII is inhibited at $t=0$, as these pathways are independently activated by the strong stimulus. PRP synthesis is initiated at $t=0$ and the resulting proteins are available for approximately $1$–$2$ hours.\n\n3.  **Capture**: This event requires the temporal and spatial coincidence of a synaptic tag (at $S2$) and the available pool of PRPs. If the tag is successfully set at $S2$ around $t=+30$ min, it can capture PRPs which are available from shortly after $t=0$ until $t \\approx +60$ to $+120$ min.\n\nWe will now analyze each condition based on these principles.\n\n**Analysis of Conditions**\n\n*   **Condition $i$**: Inhibitor present from $t=+25$ min to $t=+35$ min.\n    *   The weak tetanus to $S2$ occurs at $t=+30$ min, directly within the inhibitor window.\n    *   **Tag Setting at $S2$**: Since tag setting requires local CaMKII activity at the time of the weak stimulus, the presence of the inhibitor will block this process. No tag will be set at synapse $S2$.\n    *   **PRP Synthesis**: This process was initiated at $t=0$ by the $S1$ stimulus. The inhibitor is applied much later and has no effect on PRP synthesis. PRPs are synthesized and available.\n    *   **Outcome at $S2$**: Although PRPs are available, synapse $S2$ is not tagged. Capture cannot occur. The weak stimulus at $S2$ will only induce a transient Early-LTP, which will decay. Late-LTP at $S2$ is abolished.\n\n*   **Condition $ii$**: Inhibitor present from $t=-5$ min to $t=+5$ min.\n    *   The strong stimulus to $S1$ occurs at $t=0$, directly within the inhibitor window.\n    *   **Tag Setting at $S2$**: The weak tetanus at $S2$ is at $t=+30$ min. By this time, the reversible inhibitor has been washed out for $25$ minutes, and CaMKII function is restored. The tag at $S2$ will be set normally.\n    *   **PRP Synthesis**: The inhibitor is present during the strong $S1$ stimulus. While LTP induction at $S1$ itself will be blocked, the problem specifies that the PKA/ERK pathways responsible for PRP synthesis are sufficiently activated and are not directly affected by the inhibitor. Therefore, PRP synthesis proceeds.\n    *   **Outcome at $S2$**: A tag is successfully set at $S2$. PRPs are synthesized and available in the cell. The tag at $S2$ will capture these PRPs, leading to the successful conversion of Early-LTP to Late-LTP at this synapse.\n\n*   **Condition $iii$**: Inhibitor present from $t=+60$ min to $t=+70$ min.\n    *   This window is long after both the $S1$ strong stimulus ($t=0$) and the $S2$ weak stimulus ($t=+30$ min).\n    *   **Tag Setting at $S2$**: The tag was set normally at $t=+30$ min. The statement \"rapid local kinase activity... near the time of the weak stimulus\" implies tag setting is an induction event, not a process requiring continuous CaMKII activity for maintenance. Thus, the tag is already present.\n    *   **PRP Synthesis**: PRPs have already been synthesized or are in the process of being synthesized. This late inhibition has no effect.\n    *   **Outcome at $S2$**: The tag has been set and PRPs are available. The process of capture would be occurring during this time window. While some models might propose a role for CaMKII in the structural consolidation following capture, the primary events of STC (tagging, synthesis, and the initiation of capture) are unaffected. It is most likely that inhibiting CaMKII at this late stage will have minimal, if any, effect on the expression of Late-LTP at $S2$, which is already underway.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Condition $i$ prevents tag setting at $S2$ and abolishes capture there; Condition $ii$ leaves PRP synthesis largely intact, allowing capture at $S2$; Condition $iii$ has minimal effect on a tag that was already set and on capture, provided PRPs remain available.**\n    This statement perfectly aligns with our step-by-step analysis of all three conditions. The logic is sound for each part.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Condition $i$ does not affect tag setting at $S2$; Condition $ii$ prevents PRP synthesis triggered by the $S1$ strong stimulus, abolishing capture; Condition $iii$ eliminates the $S2$ tag because tagging depends on late CaMKII activity long after the weak tetanus.**\n    - The claim for Condition $i$ is false; the inhibitor is present at the time of tag setting.\n    - The claim for Condition $ii$ contradicts the problem's explicit separation of CaMKII and PKA/ERK pathways.\n    - The claim for Condition $iii$ posits a continuous maintenance role for CaMKII in the tag, which contradicts the \"rapid... near the time\" description.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Condition $i$ prevents PRP synthesis; Condition $ii$ selectively blocks tag formation at $S1$ but spares PRP synthesis; Condition $iii$ enhances capture at $S2$ by prolonging tag lifetime.**\n    - The claim for Condition $i$ is false; PRP synthesis is triggered at $t=0$.\n    - While the claim for Condition $ii$ is partially correct (it does block the tag at $S1$ and may spare PRP synthesis), the first claim about Condition $i$ makes the option invalid.\n    - The claim for Condition $iii$ is speculative and unfounded; an inhibitor is expected to block, not enhance, a process.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. All three conditions abolish capture at $S2$ because CaMKII activity is required both for tag setting and continuously for PRP synthesis and capture throughout the entire STC time window.**\n    - This is an oversimplification that posits a universal, continuous role for CaMKII. Our analysis shows that this is not the case. Specifically, in Condition $ii$, capture at $S2$ is predicted to be successful. Also, the problem separates the roles of CaMKII and PKA/ERK. This statement contradicts a nuanced understanding of the provided information.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the stated principles, Option A provides the only correct and complete description of the predicted outcomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2722398"}, {"introduction": "Moving from conceptual reasoning to quantitative prediction is a key step in mastering a scientific theory.

It utilizes well-established principles such as first-order decay, mass-action kinetics, and the quasi-steady-state approximation. All terms are defined, all necessary parameters are provided, and the units are consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and does not contain contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we solve the differential equation for the tag concentration, $T(t)$. The equation $\\dfrac{dT}{dt}=-k_{t}T$ with the initial condition $T(0)=T_{0}$ is a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its solution is an exponential decay:\n$$ T(t) = T_{0}\\exp(-k_{t}t) $$\nThis expression is valid for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nSecond, we write the rate equation for the bound complex $B(t)$ based on the provided reaction scheme and mass-action kinetics:\n$$ \\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T][P] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}[B] - k_{d}[B] = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T][P] - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})[B] $$\nThe problem states that a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation for $B(t)$ is justified. This implies that the concentration of $B$ adjusts much faster than the concentrations of $T$ and $P$. We therefore set $\\dfrac{d[B]}{dt} \\approx 0$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T(t)][P(t)] - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})[B(t)] \\approx 0 $$\nSolving for $[B(t)]$, we obtain the QSS concentration of the bound complex:\n$$ B(t) \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T(t)P(t)}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} $$\nThis relation is valid only for $t \\ge \\Delta$, as $P(t) = 0$ for $t < \\Delta$, which implies $B(t) = 0$ for $t < \\Delta$.\n\nThird, we construct the explicit function for $B(t)$ for $t \\ge \\Delta$ by substituting the expressions for $T(t)$ and $P(t)$:\n$$ T(t) = T_{0}\\exp(-k_{t}t) $$\n$$ P(t) = P_{0}\\exp(-k_{p}(t-\\Delta)) $$\nSubstituting these into the QSS expression for $B(t)$:\n$$ B(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} \\left( T_{0}\\exp(-k_{t}t) \\right) \\left( P_{0}\\exp(-k_{p}(t-\\Delta)) \\right) $$\nWe can combine the exponential terms:\n$$ B(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} \\exp(-k_{t}t - k_{p}(t-\\Delta)) $$\n$$ B(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} \\exp(-k_{t}t - k_{p}t + k_{p}\\Delta) $$\n$$ B(t) = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0} \\exp(k_{p}\\Delta)}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} \\right) \\exp(-(k_{t}+k_{p})t) $$\n\nFourth, we must find the maximum value of $B(t)$ for $t \\ge \\Delta$. The function $B(t)$ is of the form $A\\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $A$ and $\\lambda = k_t + k_p$ are positive constants. This is a strictly decreasing function of $t$. Therefore, its maximum value on the interval $[ \\Delta, \\infty )$ occurs at the left boundary, $t=\\Delta$. Let us denote this maximum value as $B_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\Delta)$.\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\Delta) = B(t=\\Delta) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T(\\Delta)P(\\Delta)}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} $$\nAt $t=\\Delta$:\n$T(\\Delta) = T_{0}\\exp(-k_{t}\\Delta)$\n$P(\\Delta) = P_{0}\\exp(-k_{p}(\\Delta-\\Delta)) = P_{0}\\exp(0) = P_{0}$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $B_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\Delta)$:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\Delta) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\left(T_{0}\\exp(-k_{t}\\Delta)\\right) P_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} \\exp(-k_{t}\\Delta) $$\n\nFifth, the condition for iLTP consolidation is that the maximum concentration of $B$ must exceed the threshold, i.e., $B_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\Delta) \\ge B_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. The maximal delay, $\\Delta_{\\max}$, corresponds to the boundary condition where the peak concentration is exactly equal to the threshold:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\Delta_{\\max}) = B_{\\mathrm{thr}} $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d}} \\exp(-k_{t}\\Delta_{\\max}) = B_{\\mathrm{thr}} $$\n\nSixth, we solve this equation for $\\Delta_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\exp(-k_{t}\\Delta_{\\max}) = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{thr}}(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -k_{t}\\Delta_{\\max} = \\ln\\left( \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{thr}}(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} = -\\frac{1}{k_{t}} \\ln\\left( \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{thr}}(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}} \\right) $$\nUsing the property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we obtain the final analytical expression:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{k_{t}} \\ln\\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}}{B_{\\mathrm{thr}}(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})} \\right) $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values to compute $\\Delta_{\\max}$.\nThe argument of the logarithm is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}T_{0}P_{0}}{B_{\\mathrm{thr}}(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{d})} = \\frac{(0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1})(0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})(2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{(0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})(0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} + 0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1})} $$\n$$ = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\times 0.1\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.05} = 10 $$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $\\Delta_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{k_{t}} \\ln(10) $$\nWith $k_{t}=\\dfrac{\\ln 2}{30}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\ln 2}{30}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} \\ln(10) = \\frac{30}{\\ln 2} \\ln(10) \\,\\mathrm{min} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{30}{0.693147} \\times 2.302585 \\,\\mathrm{min} \\approx 43.2808 \\times 2.302585 \\,\\mathrm{min} \\approx 99.6578 \\,\\mathrm{min} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, as required:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} \\approx 99.7\\,\\mathrm{min} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{99.7}$$", "id": "2704166"}, {"introduction": "While simple models can be solved analytically, the complex, non-linear interplay of molecules in a real synapse often requires the power of computational simulation.

The loss rate is a square pulse of amplitude $k_{\\ell 0}$ for duration $\\tau_\\ell$, and reinsertion follows a saturating, mass-action-like term with rate constant $k_c$:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k_\\ell(t)\\,A + k_c\\,T\\,P\\,(1-A),\\quad k_\\ell(t)=\\begin{cases}\nk_{\\ell 0}, & 0 \\le t \\le \\tau_\\ell,\\\\\n0, & t > \\tau_\\ell,\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad A(0)=1.$$\n\nAll variables $T(t)$, $P(t)$, and $A(t)$ are dimensionless. Time $t$ is in minutes. Your program must numerically integrate the system up to $t_{\\text{end}}$ using the explicit Euler method with a fixed time step $\\Delta t = 0.01$ minutes. For each specified parameter set, return the final value $A(t_{\\text{end}})$ as a float. All outputs are dimensionless and must be reported as floats rounded to $4$ decimal places.\n\nFundamental base and constraints to be assumed:\n- First-order kinetics for decay processes and linear production under a square pulse drive (well-tested in biochemical kinetics).\n- The Central Dogma informs that synthesis and degradation jointly set $P(t)$ levels, with $\\delta$ modulated in some scenarios to emulate UPS effects.\n- Mass-action capture principles motivate the term $k_c\\,T\\,P\\,(1-A)$ for AMPAR reinsertion.\n\nNumerical method specification:\n- Explicit Euler discretization with step $\\Delta t = 0.01$ minute:\n$$T_{n+1} = T_n + (-k_T T_n)\\,\\Delta t,$$\n$$P_{n+1} = P_n + \\big(s(t_n) - \\delta P_n\\big)\\,\\Delta t,$$\n$$A_{n+1} = A_n + \\big(-k_\\ell(t_n)A_n + k_c\\,T_n\\,P_n\\,(1-A_n)\\big)\\,\\Delta t,$$\nwith $t_n = n\\,\\Delta t$ and $n = 0,1,\\dots, N-1$, where $N = \\lfloor t_{\\text{end}}/\\Delta t \\rfloor$. Use the piecewise definitions of $s(t)$ and $k_\\ell(t)$ as given above. All quantities are dimensionless except time, which is in minutes.

Output is dimensionless (no physical units).", "solution": "The problem presents a system of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that form a simplified, biophysically-motivated model of synaptic memory reconsolidation. The problem is validated as sound and well-posed for the following reasons:\n$1$. **Scientific Grounding**: The model is based on established principles in cellular and molecular neuroscience, including synaptic tagging and capture, proteostasis governed by synthesis and degradation, and AMPAR trafficking dynamics. The use of first-order kinetics and mass-action-like terms are standard, valid simplifications in quantitative systems biology.\n$2$. **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem provides a complete set of ODEs, initial conditions, parameter values, and forcing functions. The functions defining the system dynamics are well-behaved (specifically, Lipschitz continuous), which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution. The problem also specifies a concrete numerical method (Explicit Euler) and all associated numerical parameters ($\\Delta t$), leaving no ambiguity.\n$3$. **Objectivity**: The language is precise, mathematical, and free of subjective or metaphysical claims. The manipulations described for each test case correspond to quantifiable changes in model parameters.\n\nTherefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be constructed. The objective is to compute the final surface AMPAR fraction, $A(t_{\\text{end}})$, by numerically integrating the given system of ODEs.\n\nThe system is defined by three state variables: synaptic tag strength $T(t)$, plasticity-related protein concentration $P(t)$, and surface AMPAR fraction $A(t)$. Their dynamics are governed by the following equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k_T T, \\quad T(0) = T_0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = s(t) - \\delta P, \\quad P(0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k_\\ell(t)\\,A + k_c\\,T\\,P\\,(1-A), \\quad A(0) = 1\n$$\nThe terms $s(t)$ and $k_\\ell(t)$ represent transient processes activated by synaptic reactivation and are modeled as square pulses:\n$$\ns(t) = \\begin{cases} s_0, & 0 \\le t \\le \\tau_s \\\\ 0, & t > \\tau_s \\end{cases}\n$$\n$$\nk_\\ell(t) = \\begin{cases} k_{\\ell 0}, & 0 \\le t \\le \\tau_\\ell \\\\ 0, & t > \\tau_\\ell \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe solution will be obtained by implementing the specified Explicit Euler method with a time step of $\\Delta t = 0.01$ minutes. For a state vector $\\mathbf{Y}_n = [T_n, P_n, A_n]^T$ at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$, the state at the next time step $t_{n+1}$ is computed as $\\mathbf{Y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{Y}_n + \\Delta t \\cdot f(\\mathbf{Y}_n, t_n)$, where $f$ is the vector of derivatives.\n\nThe discrete update equations are:\n$$\nT_{n+1} = T_n - (k_T T_n) \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\nP_{n+1} = P_n + (s(t_n) - \\delta P_n) \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\nA_{n+1} = A_n + (-k_\\ell(t_n)A_n + k_c T_n P_n (1-A_n)) \\Delta t\n$$\nThese equations are initialized with the values $T_0$, $P(0)=0$, and $A(0)=1$. The simulation proceeds by iterating these update rules from $t=0$ up to $t_{\\text{end}}$. The total number of steps is $N = \\lfloor t_{\\text{end}} / \\Delta t \\rfloor$. The loop runs for $n$ from $0$ to $N-1$. At each step $n$, the time is $t_n = n \\Delta t$, and the values of the piecewise functions $s(t_n)$ and $k_\\ell(t_n)$ are determined based on whether $t_n$ is within their respective active intervals, $[\\,0, \\tau_s\\,]$ and $[\\,0, \\tau_\\ell\\,]$.\n\nThis numerical procedure will be implemented within a Python function. This function will be called for each of the six parameter sets provided in the test suite.
