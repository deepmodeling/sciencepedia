The model of vesicle release as independent Bernoulli trials is a foundational concept in cellular neuroscience, often referred to as the quantal hypothesis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the problem. Let $X_i$ be a random variable representing the release event at the $i$-th release site, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$.

Consider a synapse that obeys the quantal hypothesis with $n$ independent release sites, each releasing at most one vesicle per action potential, with probability $p$, and each vesicle producing a quantal postsynaptic response of size $q$. Assume the postsynaptic quantal size $q$ and receptor properties are unchanged by the manipulations below, and that detection noise is negligible.\n\nAn intervention produces LTP that doubles the mean excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude.

If the mean doubles by increasing $n$ at fixed $p$, CV decreases in proportion to $n^{-1/2}$ (e.g., a doubling of $n$ reduces CV by a factor of $\\sqrt{1/2}$), failure rate decreases from $(1-p)^{n}$ to $(1-p)^{2n}$, and PPR remains approximately unchanged because the fractional depletion per site is unchanged; MK-801 block kinetics of NMDAR currents are unchanged, cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current back-extrapolation indicates a larger RRP, and MPFA shows a variance–mean parabola with reduced curvature magnitude (consistent with larger $n$).

It is scientifically grounded in the canonical quantal model of synaptic transmission, is well-posed, and uses precise, objective language. The setup is internally consistent and allows for a unique solution to be derived from first principles.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the quantal model and the observables in question. The release of neurotransmitter vesicles is described by a binomial process, where $n$ is the number of independent release sites (the readily releasable pool, RRP) and $p$ is the probability of release from any given site in response to an action potential. The postsynaptic response to a single vesicle is the quantal size, $q$. The total postsynaptic current, $I$, is the number of released vesicles, $k$, multiplied by $q$. The number of released vesicles $k$ follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim B(n, p)$.\n\nThe mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$) of the postsynaptic current are given by:\n$$ \\mu = E[k \\cdot q] = q \\cdot E[k] = n p q $$\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\text{Var}[k \\cdot q] = q^2 \\cdot \\text{Var}[k] = n p (1-p) q^2 $$\n\nFrom these, we derive the expressions for the key observables:\n\n1.  **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.\n    $$ CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n p (1-p) q^2}}{n p q} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n p (1-p)}}{n p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{np}} $$\n\n2.  **Failure Rate ($P_0$)**: The probability of releasing zero vesicles ($k=0$).\n    $$ P_0 = P(k=0) = \\binom{n}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{n-0} = (1-p)^n $$\n\n3.  **Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR)**: The ratio of the mean response to a second stimulus ($E_2$) to the mean response to a first stimulus ($E_1$), delivered in close succession. A simple but effective model for short-term depression assumes that the primary cause is the depletion of the RRP. The mean response to the first pulse is $E_1 = npq$. The number of vesicles remaining for the second pulse is $n - E[k_1] = n - np = n(1-p)$. Assuming the release probability $p$ is the same for the second pulse, the mean response is $E_2 = n(1-p)pq$. Thus, the PPR is:\n    $$ PPR = \\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\frac{n(1-p)pq}{npq} = 1-p $$\n    This model shows that PPR is inversely related to the initial release probability $p$.\n\nThe problem states that an intervention produces Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) that doubles the mean excitatory postsynaptic current. Let the initial state be $(n_1, p_1)$ with mean $\\mu_1 = n_1 p_1 q$, and the potentiated state be $(n_2, p_2)$ with mean $\\mu_2 = n_2 p_2 q$. We are given $\\mu_2 = 2\\mu_1$.\n\nWe now analyze the two proposed, non-exclusive mechanisms for this doubling of the mean.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: RRP Expansion**\nThe increase in mean is solely due to an increase in $n$, with $p$ held constant.\n$p_2 = p_1$. The condition $\\mu_2 = 2\\mu_1$ implies $n_2 p_2 q = 2 n_1 p_1 q$, which simplifies to $n_2 = 2n_1$. The transformation is $(n_1, p_1) \\rightarrow (2n_1, p_1)$.\n\nLet us evaluate the consequences:\n-   **CV**:\n    $CV_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p_1}{2n_1 p_1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p_1}{n_1 p_1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} CV_1$.\n    The CV decreases by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$, which is proportional to $n^{-1/2}$.\n-   **Failure Rate**:\n    $P_{0,2} = (1-p_1)^{2n_1} = ((1-p_1)^{n_1})^2 = (P_{0,1})^2$. Since $P_{0,1} < 1$, the failure rate decreases.\n-   **PPR**:\n    $PPR_2 = 1 - p_1 = PPR_1$. The PPR remains unchanged, as it depends only on $p$ in this model.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Release Probability Upregulation**\nThe increase in mean is solely due to an increase in $p$, with $n$ held constant.\n$n_2 = n_1$. The condition $\\mu_2 = 2\\mu_1$ implies $n_2 p_2 q = 2 n_1 p_1 q$, which simplifies to $p_2 = 2p_1$. This is valid only if $p_1 < 0.5$. The transformation is $(n_1, p_1) \\rightarrow (n_1, 2p_1)$.\n\nLet us evaluate the consequences:\n-   **CV**:\n    $CV_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-2p_1}{n_1 (2p_1)}}$.\n    The ratio $CV_2/CV_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-2p_1}{2p_1} \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-2p_1}{2(1-p_1)}}$. Since $1-2p_1 < 2(1-p_1)$ for any valid $p_1 > 0$, the ratio is less than $1$. The CV decreases.\n-   **Failure Rate**:\n    $P_{0,2} = (1-2p_1)^{n_1}$. Since $1-2p_1 < 1-p_1$, it follows that $P_{0,2} < P_{0,1}$. The failure rate decreases.\n-   **PPR**:\n    $PPR_2 = 1 - 2p_1$. Since $p_1 > 0$, $PPR_2 < 1-p_1 = PPR_1$. The PPR decreases, indicating stronger paired-pulse depression.\n\nNow we analyze the proposed diagnostic tools.\n\n1.  **Multiple-Probability Fluctuation Analysis (MPFA)**: This technique relates variance to the mean as release probability is varied (e.g., by changing extracellular calcium). The governing equation is a parabola:\n    $$ \\sigma^2 = q\\mu - \\frac{1}{n}\\mu^2 $$\n    The curvature of this parabola is given by the coefficient of the $\\mu^2$ term, which is $-1/n$.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 1 ($n \\to 2n$), the magnitude of the curvature, $1/n$, decreases by a factor of $2$. The parabola becomes flatter.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 2 ($n$ constant), the curvature remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Cumulative EPSC Back-Extrapolation**: This method estimates the size of the RRP by measuring the total charge transferred during a high-frequency stimulus train that depletes the RRP. The y-intercept of the cumulative current plot, extrapolated from the linear phase of depletion, is proportional to the total charge in the RRP, which is $n \\cdot q$.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 1 ($n \\to 2n$), the intercept will double, indicating a larger RRP.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 2 ($n$ constant), the intercept will remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **MK-801 Block Kinetics**: MK-801 is a use-dependent, irreversible open-channel blocker of NMDARs. The rate of block of the NMDAR-mediated current during repetitive stimulation is proportional to the probability of channel opening, which is in turn proportional to the presynaptic release probability, $p$.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 1 ($p$ constant), the rate of block is unchanged.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 2 ($p \\to 2p$), the rate of block accelerates.\n\nSummary of Predictions:\n| Observable/Diagnostic          | Hypothesis 1: $n \\to 2n$, $p$ constant | Hypothesis 2: $n$ constant, $p \\to 2p$ |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| **CV**                         | Decreases ($\\propto n^{-1/2}$)         | Decreases                              |\n| **Failure Rate, $P_0$**        | Decreases                              | Decreases                              |\n| **PPR**                        | Unchanged                              | Decreases (more depression)            |\n| **MPFA Curvature**             | Decreases (flatter parabola)           | Unchanged                              |\n| **Cumulative EPSC Intercept**  | Increases                              | Unchanged                              |\n| **MK-801 Block Rate**          | Unchanged                              | Accelerates                            |\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A.**\n-   **If mean doubles by increasing $n$**: States CV decreases $\\propto n^{-1/2}$, failure rate decreases, PPR is unchanged.
