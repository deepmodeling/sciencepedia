It describes a standard biophysical scenario in cellular neuroscience—the action of GABA at an axo-axonic synapse on a primary afferent terminal. The provided values are physiologically realistic for such terminals, which often maintain a high intracellular chloride concentration. The problem requires the derivation and application of the Nernst equation, a fundamental concept in electrophysiology. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the equilibrium potential of an ion from the first principle of electrochemical equilibrium. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{j}$, for an ionic species $j$ is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole. It is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{j} = \\mu_{j}^{0} + RT \\ln([j]) + z_{j}F\\psi $$\nwhere $\\mu_{j}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $[j]$ is the molar concentration of the ion, $z_{j}$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential of the compartment.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition is met when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane (intracellular, $i$, and extracellular, $o$):\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{j,i} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{j,o} $$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_{j}^{0} + RT \\ln([j]_{i}) + z_{j}F\\psi_{i} = \\mu_{j}^{0} + RT \\ln([j]_{o}) + z_{j}F\\psi_{o} $$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_{j}^{0}$ is the same on both sides and cancels out. Rearranging the terms to solve for the electrical potential difference across the membrane, $V_{m} = \\psi_{i} - \\psi_{o}$:\n$$ z_{j}F(\\psi_{i} - \\psi_{o}) = RT \\ln([j]_{o}) - RT \\ln([j]_{i}) $$\n$$ z_{j}FV_{m} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[j]_{o}}{[j]_{i}}\\right) $$\nThe equilibrium potential, $E_{j}$, is the specific membrane potential $V_{m}$ at which this equilibrium occurs. Thus, we have the Nernst equation:\n$$ E_{j} = \\frac{RT}{z_{j}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[j]_{o}}{[j]_{i}}\\right) $$\nThis is the derived expression for the equilibrium potential.\n\nNext, we compute the equilibrium potential for the chloride ion, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, using the provided data.\nFor chloride (${\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$), the valence is $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -1$. The given values are:\n- $R = 8.314 \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $T = 310 \\, \\text{K}$\n- $F = 96485 \\, \\text{C} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$\n- $[{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}]_{o} = 130 \\, \\text{mM}$\n- $[{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}]_{i} = 25 \\, \\text{mM}$\n- $z = -1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the Nernst equation for chloride:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{(8.314 \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}^{-1}) (310 \\, \\text{K})}{(-1) (96485 \\, \\text{C} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{130}{25}\\right) $$\nThe units $\\text{J} \\cdot \\text{C}^{-1}$ correctly yield Volts ($V$).\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{2577.34}{-96485} \\ln(5.2) \\, \\text{V} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx (-0.026712) \\times (1.6486586) \\, \\text{V} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx -0.0440375 \\, \\text{V} $$\nTo express this in millivolts (mV), we multiply by $1000$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx -44.0375 \\, \\text{mV} $$\nThe chloride equilibrium potential is approximately $-44.04$ mV. This potential is depolarized relative to the resting potential of many neurons, a known characteristic of primary afferent terminals due to active chloride accumulation.\n\nFinally, we compute the synaptic driving force for chloride ions at the resting membrane potential. The driving force, $V_{\\mathrm{df}}$, for an ion is the difference between the membrane potential and the ion's equilibrium potential. The problem defines it as $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\nGiven $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = -70$ mV:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{df}} = V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{df}} = (-70 \\, \\text{mV}) - (-44.0375 \\, \\text{mV}) $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{df}} = -70 \\, \\text{mV} + 44.0375 \\, \\text{mV} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{df}} = -25.9625 \\, \\text{mV} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that for a membrane potential of $-70$ mV, the net electrochemical force on ${\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$ ions is directed outward. An opening of ${\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$ channels will cause an efflux of ${\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$ ions, which constitutes a depolarizing current.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{df}} \\approx -25.96 \\, \\text{mV} $$\nThis is the final calculated value for the driving force.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-25.96} $$", "id": "2739732"}, {"introduction": "Beyond direct changes in membrane potential, presynaptic inhibition can powerfully modulate neurotransmitter release by targeting voltage-gated calcium channels.

The equations provided are standard, simplified models for ion channel currents (Ohm's law formulation), the relationship between ionic flux and concentration change (integration of current), and the cooperative nature of calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release (Dodge-Rahamimoff power law). These are not speculative but are foundational concepts in the field.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for a fold-change, which is a ratio. This structure often simplifies such problems by canceling out unknown proportionality constants and absolute baseline values. The constraints, including the invariance of $V(t)$, $O(t)$, and $E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$, ensure that the problem is well-defined and a unique solution can be derived from the provided relationships.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical and quantitative language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary parameters, namely the fractional change in conductance ($0.30$) and the cooperativity exponent ($n=4$), are provided. The problem is self-contained.\n\nThe problem statement demonstrates scientific soundness, is well-posed, and is presented in an objective, complete manner. There are no identifiable flaws. The problem is therefore deemed valid and we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the initial state (before inhibition) be denoted by the subscript 'old' and the state during inhibition by the subscript 'new'. The problem requires the calculation of the ratio $\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{r,new}}}{P_{\\mathrm{r,old}}}$.\n\nAccording to the given relationships, the release probability $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$ is proportional to the $n$-th power of the transient calcium increment $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. We can write this as:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r}} = k \\left( \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\right)^{n}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe calcium increment is proportional to the time integral of the calcium current $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$:\n$$\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = \\alpha \\int I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t) \\, dt$$\nwhere the integral is taken over the duration of the current influx.\n\nThe calcium current is given by:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t) = g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\,O(t)\\,\\big(V(t)-E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\big)$$\n\nLet us combine these relationships. Substituting the expression for $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ into the equation for $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r}} = k \\left( \\alpha \\int I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t) \\, dt \\right)^{n}$$\nNow, substituting the expression for $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r}} = k \\left( \\alpha \\int g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\,O(t)\\,\\big(V(t)-E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\big) \\, dt \\right)^{n}$$\n\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is the maximal conductance, it is a time-independent parameter for a given state. The constants $k$, $\\alpha$, and $g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ can be factored out:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r}} = k \\, \\alpha^{n} \\, g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n} \\left( \\int O(t)\\,\\big(V(t)-E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\big) \\, dt \\right)^{n}$$\n\nThe problem states that the inhibitory input does not alter $V(t)$, $E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$, or the channel kinetics $O(t)$. Therefore, the integral term is a constant for both the old and new conditions. Let us define this constant integral as $\\mathcal{J}$:\n$$\\mathcal{J} = \\int O(t)\\,\\big(V(t)-E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\big) \\, dt$$\n\nThus, the release probability in any state is proportional to the $n$-th power of its corresponding maximal conductance:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r}} \\propto g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n}$$\n\nWe can now write the release probabilities for the old and new states:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,old}} = C \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}}^{n}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,new}} = C \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,new}}^{n}$$\nwhere $C = k \\, \\alpha^{n} \\, \\mathcal{J}^{n}$ is a constant that is identical for both conditions.\n\nThe fold-change is the ratio of these two probabilities:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{r,new}}}{P_{\\mathrm{r,old}}} = \\frac{C \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,new}}^{n}}{C \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}}^{n}} = \\left( \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{Ca,new}}}{g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}}} \\right)^{n}$$\n\nThe problem states that the inhibitory input reduces $g_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ by a fraction $f=0.30$ of its baseline value. This means:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{Ca,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}} - f \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}} = (1-f) \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{r,new}}}{P_{\\mathrm{r,old}}} = \\left( \\frac{(1-f) \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}}}{g_{\\mathrm{Ca,old}}} \\right)^{n} = (1-f)^{n}$$\nThis is the general expression for the fold-change in terms of the fractional reduction in conductance, $f$, and the cooperativity exponent, $n$.\n\nWe are given $f=0.30$ and $n=4$.

There are no scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities in the problem statement itself.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe analysis relies on the binomial model of synaptic transmission. The key relationships between the model parameters ($N$, $p$, $q$) and the measured quantities ($\\mu$, $\\sigma^2$, $\\mathrm{CV}$, $f$) are as follows, assuming negligible quantal variance:\n- Mean amplitude: $\\mu = Npq$\n- Variance: $\\sigma^2 = Np(1-p)q^2$\n- Coefficient of variation squared: $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{Np(1-p)q^2}{(Npq)^2} = \\frac{1-p}{Np}$\n- Failure rate (probability of zero quanta released): $f = (1-p)^N$\n- Variance-Mean Relationship: By substituting $p = \\mu/(Nq)$ into the variance equation, we obtain the parabolic relationship $\\sigma^2 = q\\mu - \\frac{1}{N}\\mu^2$.\n\nThe experimental manipulation involves activating an inhibitory axo-axonic synapse on the presynaptic terminal. This is a classic setup for inducing presynaptic inhibition, which typically modulates neurotransmitter release probability, $p$.\n\nWe compare the two conditions:\n1.  **Mean Amplitude ($\\mu$):** Decreases from $\\mu_1 = 60$ pA to $\\mu_2 = 30$ pA. This is consistent with a decrease in $N$, $p$, or $q$.\n2.  **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** Increases from $\\mathrm{CV}_1 \\approx 0.18$ to $\\mathrm{CV}_2 \\approx 0.34$. From the formula $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = (1-p)/(Np)$, a decrease in $p$ causes the numerator $(1-p)$ to increase and the denominator $Np$ to decrease, both of which increase the CV. A change in $q$ has no effect on CV. A decrease in $N$ would also increase CV.\n3.  **Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR):** Increases from $\\mathrm{PPR}_1 = 0.80$ (paired-pulse depression) to $\\mathrm{PPR}_2 = 1.30$ (paired-pulse facilitation). PPR is a measure of short-term synaptic plasticity and is known to be inversely related to the initial release probability $p$. High $p$ leads to vesicle depletion and depression, while low $p$ allows facilitation mechanisms to dominate. A change in PPR from depression to facilitation is a hallmark signature of a decrease in $p$. Changes in $N$ or $q$ are not expected to alter PPR.\n4.  **Failure Rate ($f$):** Increases from $f_1 = 0.05$ to $f_2 = 0.25$. From the formula $f = (1-p)^N$, a decrease in $p$ leads to an increase in $(1-p)$, and thus an increase in $f$. This is consistent with the data. A decrease in $N$ would also increase $f$. A change in $q$ does not affect $f$.\n\nThe collective evidence points overwhelmingly to a decrease in the presynaptic release probability $p$. The strong shift in PPR is the most definitive indicator. While a change in $N$ could account for the changes in $\\mu$, CV, and $f$, it fails to explain the change in PPR. A change in $q$ fails to explain the changes in CV, PPR, and $f$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. A presynaptic decrease in release probability $p$ at constant $N$ and $q$; the points $(\\mu_1,\\sigma_1^2)$ and $(\\mu_2,\\sigma_2^2)$ lie on the same concave-down variance–mean parabola determined by constant $N$ and $q$, and the decrease in $p$ moves the synapse to lower $\\mu$ with higher CV and higher PPR.\n\nThis option posits a decrease in $p$. As derived above, a decrease in $p$ correctly predicts:\n- A decrease in $\\mu$.\n- An increase in CV.\n- An increase in PPR (specifically, the observed shift from depression to facilitation).\n- An increase in failure rate.\nFurthermore, if only $p$ changes while $N$ and $q$ remain constant, the parameters of the variance-mean parabola $\\sigma^2 = q\\mu - (1/N)\\mu^2$ are unchanged. Thus, the two experimental points, $(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2)$ and $(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2)$, must lie on the same parabola. This statement is entirely consistent with the data and the theoretical model. The calculated point coordinates are $(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2) = (60 \\text{ pA}, 119.9 \\text{ pA}^2)$ and $(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2) = (30 \\text{ pA}, 105.1 \\text{ pA}^2)$. These points can be fit to a single concave-down parabola.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB.

A change in $q$ does not affect $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{(1-p)/Np}$ or the presynaptic mechanism of PPR. The data show that both CV and PPR change significantly. Therefore, the premise is incorrect. The description of scaling is correct for a change in $q$ ($ \\mu \\propto q $, $ \\sigma^2 \\propto q^2 $, thus $\\sigma^2 \\propto \\mu^2$), but this is directly contradicted by the data which show CV is not constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. A decrease in the number of functional release sites $N$ at constant $p$ and $q$; the variance–mean parabola changes curvature, mean decreases, CV increases, but PPR remains unchanged.\n\nThis option posits a decrease in $N$. While this would cause $\\mu$ to decrease and CV to increase, it would not typically cause a change in PPR. The problem data show a dramatic change in PPR from $0.80$ to $1.30$. The statement \"PPR remains unchanged\" is a direct contradiction of the provided measurements.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. A postsynaptic shunt that decreases EPSC amplitude by reducing input resistance without altering presynaptic parameters; the variance and mean amplitudes scale proportionally, leaving CV and PPR unchanged, and the variance–mean points fall on a straight scaling line through the origin.\n\nA postsynaptic shunt, in a voltage-clamp experiment, effectively reduces the measured quantal current $q$. This case is therefore equivalent to option B. As established, a change in $q$ is inconsistent with the observed changes in CV and PPR. Furthermore, the claim that variance and mean scale proportionally ($\\sigma^2 \\propto \\mu$) is false; the relationship is parabolic. A proportional relationship would imply a constant ratio $\\sigma^2/\\mu$, which is not observed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2739712"}]}
