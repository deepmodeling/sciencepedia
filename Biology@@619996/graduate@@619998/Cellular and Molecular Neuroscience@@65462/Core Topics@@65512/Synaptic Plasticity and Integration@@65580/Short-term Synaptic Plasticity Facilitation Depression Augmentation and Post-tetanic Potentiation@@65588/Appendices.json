We proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe problem describes the time evolution of the residual calcium concentration, $[Ca]_{\\text{res}}(t)$, in a presynaptic terminal following an action potential. The dynamics are governed by a single-compartment model with first-order clearance. This physical situation is described by a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe rate of change of the calcium concentration, $\\frac{d}{dt}[Ca]_{\\text{res}}(t)$, is proportional to the concentration itself, with a negative constant of proportionality. This constant is the inverse of the effective time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{eff}}$. The governing equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d[Ca]_{\\text{res}}(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}} [Ca]_{\\text{res}}(t)\n$$\nThis equation holds for time $t > 0$.\n\nThe problem states that at time $t=0$, an action potential produces an \"effectively instantaneous increment in free calcium of amplitude $[Ca]_0$\". This constitutes the initial condition for the differential equation. Assuming the resting calcium level is normalized to zero, the concentration at the moment immediately following the impulse is:\n$$\n[Ca]_{\\text{res}}(0) = [Ca]_0\n$$\nWe now have a complete initial value problem. The solution to the equation $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -ky$ with initial condition $y(0) = y_0$ is universally known to be $y(t) = y_0 \\exp(-kt)$.

Consider a single synapse driven by a periodic presynaptic spike train of frequency $f$ (period $\\Delta = 1/f$). Let $R(t)$ denote the fraction of release-ready resources available at time $t$, normalized by the maximal pool size $R_{\\max}$. The synapse obeys the following well-tested facts and core definitions:\n- At each presynaptic action potential, an expected fraction $p$ of the currently available resources is released, producing an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude proportional to the released fraction.\n- Immediately after a spike at time $t_{n}$, the available fraction jumps from the pre-spike value $R(t_{n}^{-})$ to the post-spike value $R(t_{n}^{+}) = R(t_{n}^{-})(1 - p)$.\n- Between spikes, resources recover exponentially toward $R_{\\max}$ with a time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, implementing $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$ for $t \\in (t_{n}, t_{n+1})$.\n\nAssume there is no facilitation, augmentation, or post-tetanic potentiation; that is, the release probability $p$ is constant, and only depletion and recovery shape the responses.

The problem describes a canonical model of short-term synaptic depression (the Tsodyks-Markram model in its simplified form for depression only), which is a fundamental concept in cellular and molecular neuroscience. The model is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There is a slight imprecision in the problem statement regarding the variable $R(t)$. It is defined as a normalized fraction, yet the differential equation $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$ suggests $R$ has the same units as $R_{\\max}$. However, this ambiguity is resolved by interpreting $R(t)$ as the absolute quantity of resources and $R_{\\max}$ as the maximum quantity. The subsequent request to use $R_{\\max}=1$ makes this interpretation fully consistent with a normalized model where $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{1 - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$. With this standard interpretation, the problem is internally consistent and solvable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. We seek the steady-state normalized EPSC amplitude, $A_{\\infty}(f)$. By definition, this is the amount of resource released at steady state, $p R_{\\infty}^{-}$, divided by the maximal pool size $R_{\\max}$. Thus, $A_{\\infty}(f) = \\frac{p R_{\\infty}^{-}}{R_{\\max}}$, where $R_{\\infty}^{-}$ is the resource level just before a spike in the steady state.\n\nStep 1: Solve the recovery dynamics between spikes.\nThe recovery of resources between spike $n$ at time $t_n$ and spike $n+1$ at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta$ is described by the linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\int_{R(t_n^+)}^{R(t_{n+1}^-)} \\frac{dR}{R_{\\max} - R} = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{dt}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\n$$\nThe initial condition for this interval is the post-spike resource level $R(t_n^+)$.

The depletion rule is given as $R(t_n^+) = R_n^{-}(1 - p)$.

The problem is mathematically well-posed, providing all necessary differential equations, update rules, initial conditions, and parameters. The objectives are stated clearly and are computationally tractable. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n**3. Derivation and Solution Methodology**\n\nThe task is to compute the sequence of postsynaptic responses $y_k$ generated by a periodic presynaptic spike train. This requires deriving discrete-time recurrence relations from the given continuous-time dynamics and instantaneous spike-time updates.\n\nLet us define the state of the synapse immediately before the $k$-th spike as $(u_{k}^{\\text{pre}}, x_{k}^{\\text{pre}})$. Let the state immediately after the update and depletion at spike $k$ be $(u_k, x_{k}^{\\text{post}})$, where $u_k$ is the post-facilitation release probability.\n\n**Step 1: Evolution between spikes**\nBetween spike $k-1$ and spike $k$, the system evolves for a duration $\\Delta t = 1/f$. The governing ordinary differential equations are linear and first-order.\nThe equation for $u(t)$ is $\\dfrac{du}{dt} = -u/\\tau_f$. With initial condition $u(t_{k-1}) = u_{k-1}$, its solution is $u(t) = u_{k-1} e^{-(t - t_{k-1})/\\tau_f}$. Thus, the value of $u$ just before spike $k$ is:\n$$u_{k}^{\\text{pre}} = u_{k-1} e^{-\\Delta t / \\tau_f}$$\n\nThe equation for $x(t)$ is $\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = (1 - x)/\\tau_d$. Let's define a variable $z(t) = 1 - x(t)$, so $\\dfrac{dz}{dt} = -\\dfrac{z}{\\tau_d}$. With initial condition $x(t_{k-1}) = x_{k-1}^{\\text{post}}$, we have $z(t_{k-1}) = 1 - x_{k-1}^{\\text{post}}$. The solution for $z(t)$ is $z(t) = z(t_{k-1}) e^{-(t - t_{k-1})/\\tau_d}$. Substituting back for $x(t)$, we get $1-x(t) = (1 - x_{k-1}^{\\text{post}}) e^{-(t - t_{k-1})/\\tau_d}$, which means $x(t) = 1 - (1 - x_{k-1}^{\\text{post}}) e^{-(t - t_{k-1})/\\tau_d}$. The value of $x$ just before spike $k$ is:\n$$x_{k}^{\\text{pre}} = 1 - (1 - x_{k-1}^{\\text{post}}) e^{-\\Delta t / \\tau_d}$$\n\n**Step 2: Updates at a spike**\nAt the arrival of spike $k$, the variables are updated instantaneously.\nFirst, the release probability $u$ is facilitated. The problem defines $u_k$ as the value after the jump:\n$$u_k = u_{k}^{\\text{pre}} + U (1 - u_{k}^{\\text{pre}})$$\nThe problem defines $x_k$ as the value of the resource *before* depletion, which is precisely $x_{k}^{\\text{pre}}$. Therefore:\n$$x_k = x_{k}^{\\text{pre}}$$\nThe normalized postsynaptic response $y_k$ is then calculated as:\n$$y_k = u_k x_k = u_k x_{k}^{\\text{pre}}$$\nFinally, the available resources $x$ are depleted using the newly updated release probability $u_k$. The state of $x$ after depletion is:\n$$x_{k}^{\\text{post}} = x_{k}^{\\text{pre}} (1 - u_k)$$\n\n**Step 3: Recurrence Relations and Algorithm**\nWe can now combine these steps to form a complete set of recurrence relations. The state of the system can be tracked by the variables $(u_k, x_{k}^{\\text{post}})$.\nThe update from step $k-1$ to $k$ proceeds as follows:\n1. Evolve between spikes to find the pre-spike state for spike $k$:\n   $$u_{k}^{\\text{pre}} = u_{k-1} e^{-\\Delta t / \\tau_f}$$\n   $$x_{k}^{\\text{pre}} = 1 - (1 - x_{k-1}^{\\text{post}}) e^{-\\Delta t / \\tau_d}$$\n2. Update at spike $k$ and calculate the response:\n   $$u_k = u_{k}^{\\text{pre}} + U(1 - u_{k}^{\\text{pre}})$$\n   $$y_k = u_k x_{k}^{\\text{pre}}$$\n3. Calculate the post-depletion resource state for the next interval:\n   $$x_{k}^{\\text{post}} = x_{k}^{\\text{pre}} (1 - u_k)$$\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\nThe system starts from a quiescent state, $u(0^-)=0$ and $x(0^-)=1$. This corresponds to the state after a hypothetical spike at $t=-\\infty$. Thus, for the first spike ($k=1$), we can set the \"previous\" state values as $u_0 = 0$ and $x_0^{\\text{post}} = 1$.\nThe simulation proceeds as follows:\nInitialize with $u_{\\text{prev}} = 0$ and $x_{\\text{post_prev}} = 1$.\nFor $k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$:\n- Compute $u_{k}^{\\text{pre}} = u_{\\text{prev}} \\exp(-\\Delta t / \\tau_f)$.\n- Compute $x_{k}^{\\text{pre}} = 1 - (1 - x_{\\text{post_prev}}) \\exp(-\\Delta t / \\tau_d)$.\n- Compute $u_k = u_{k}^{\\text{pre}} + U(1 - u_{k}^{\\text{pre}})$.\n- Compute $y_k = u_k x_{k}^{\\text{pre}}$.\n- Compute $x_{k}^{\\text{post}} = x_{k}^{\\text{pre}} (1 - u_k)$.\n- Update for the next iteration: $u_{\\text{prev}} = u_k$ and $x_{\\text{post_prev}} = x_{k}^{\\text{post}}$.\n- Store $y_k$.\n\nThe time constants $\\tau_f$ and $\\tau_d$ are provided in milliseconds (ms) and must be converted to seconds by dividing by $1000$ to be dimensionally consistent with $\\Delta t = 1/f$, where $f$ is in Hz.\n\n**Step 4: Dominance Classification**\nAfter computing the sequence $(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5)$, the dominance integer $S$ is determined. Let $\\epsilon = 10^{-9}$.\n- Initialize counters for increases $I=0$ and decreases $D=0$.\n- For $k$ from $2$ to $5$, compare $y_k$ and $y_{k-1}$:\n  - If $y_k - y_{k-1}  \\epsilon$, increment $I$.\n  - If $y_k - y_{k-1}  -\\epsilon$, increment $D$.\n- Apply the rules:\n  - If $I \\ge 3$ and $y_5 - y_1  \\epsilon$, set $S = 1$.\n  - Else if $D \\ge 3$ and $y_5 - y_1  -\\epsilon$, set $S = -1$.\n  - Otherwise, set $S = 0$.\n\nThis completes the theoretical and algorithmic framework required to solve the problem.
