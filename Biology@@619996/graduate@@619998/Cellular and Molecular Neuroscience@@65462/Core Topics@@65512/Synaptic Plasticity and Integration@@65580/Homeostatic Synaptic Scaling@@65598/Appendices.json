The definitions of homeostatic scaling, mEPSCs, and multiplicative scaling are standard and correct. The mechanisms of the specified pharmacological agents (TTX, CNQX, APV) are accurately stated. The problem is firmly grounded in established scientific fact.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It requests the identification of a correct experimental design from a set of options, based on a clear and specific set of scientific goals and principles. A unique, correct answer should exist.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjectivity or bias.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws such as factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction. Therefore, a full analysis of the options is warranted.\n\n**Derivation of a Correct Protocol from First Principles**\n\n1.  **Induction of Scaling Up:** To induce scaling *up*, which is an increase in synaptic strength, the negative feedback system must be driven by a chronic *decrease* in network activity. Based on the givens, blocking action potentials with TTX or blocking excitatory synaptic transmission with a combination of an AMPA receptor antagonist (CNQX) and an NMDA receptor antagonist (APV) are both valid methods to achieve this. This treatment must be chronic, typically for $24$–$48$ hours, to allow for the necessary changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, and receptor trafficking.\n2.  **Measurement of mEPSCs:** To measure mEPSCs, which are spontaneous, quantal events, several conditions must be met.\n    -   Action potentials must be blocked during the recording to prevent contamination by larger, network-driven synaptic events. This requires the presence of TTX in the recording solution.\n    -   To isolate excitatory currents (EPSCs), inhibitory currents (IPSCs) mediated by GABA-A receptors must be blocked. A GABA-A receptor antagonist such as picrotoxin or bicuculline is required.\n    -   The problem specifies that mEPSCs are predominantly AMPA receptor-mediated. To ensure this, it is standard practice to block NMDA receptors with APV, especially if there is any doubt about their contribution. A holding potential of approximately $-70$ mV also minimizes NMDA receptor currents due to their voltage-dependent magnesium block.\n3.  **Analysis of Multiplicativity:** The definition requires that the entire distribution of amplitudes is scaled by a single factor, $k$. If a control distribution is $P_{control}(A)$, the treated distribution must be $P_{treated}(A) = (1/k) \\cdot P_{control}(A/k)$. This has specific statistical consequences.\n    -   **Rank-Order Plots:** A plot of rank-ordered amplitudes from the treated condition versus the control condition should be linear with a slope of $k$ and an intercept of zero.\n    -   **Distribution Rescaling:** The most rigorous test is to computationally \"back-scale\" the entire distribution of mEPSC amplitudes from the treated group by dividing each amplitude by an estimated scaling factor, $k$. The resulting back-scaled distribution should be statistically indistinguishable from the control distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is the appropriate statistical tool for comparing the shapes of two distributions.\n    -   **Normalization:** A simpler, but less direct, method involves normalizing each amplitude distribution to its own mean or median. If scaling is multiplicative, the shape of the distributions is preserved, so the normalized distributions from control and treated cells should overlap. A K-S test can verify this.\n    -   **Controls:** A key prediction of postsynaptic scaling is that mEPSC frequency, which reflects presynaptic properties, should not change. This serves as an important negative control.\n4.  **Statistical Rigor:** A sound experiment requires an adequate sample size (number of cells, $n$) and replication across independent preparations (number of cultures, $N$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

Use per-cell medians compared by Mann–Whitney $U$ test for central tendency, expect amplitude to increase and frequency to remain unchanged, and include at least $n \\geq 12$ cells per group from $N \\geq 3$ cultures.**\n\n-   **Induction:** Correct. Both TTX for $48$ h and CNQX+APV for $48$ h are standard, valid methods to chronically silence the network and induce scaling up.\n-   **Recording:** Correct. The recording cocktail (TTX, picrotoxin, APV) is ideal for isolating pure, miniature AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. The holding potential ($-70$ mV) is appropriate.\n-   **Analysis:** Excellent. It includes crucial quality controls (stable series resistance), quantification of both amplitude and frequency (as a control), and appropriate statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U). Most importantly, it describes the gold-standard method for testing multiplicativity: back-scaling the treated distribution and testing for overlap with the control distribution using a K-S test. The mention of rank-order plots is also correct, although the phrasing \"within-cell linear regression of treated versus control ranks\" is slightly imprecise. However, the core concept and the inclusion of the definitive back-scaling test are correct. The statistical power considerations ($n \\geq 12$, $N \\geq 3$) demonstrate scientific rigor.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option describes a comprehensive, rigorous, and scientifically sound protocol.\n\n**B. Treat neurons with TTX at $1\\,\\mu$M for $2$ h and assess evoked excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes and paired-pulse ratio at $-70$ mV. Declare multiplicativity if the mean evoked amplitude increases significantly versus control by unpaired $t$-test at $\\alpha = 0.05$.**\n\n-   **Induction:** Incorrect. A treatment duration of $2$ hours is far too short to induce homeostatic scaling, which is a slow process involving protein synthesis.\n-   **Measurement:** Incorrect. The problem requires analysis of *miniature* currents to test a hypothesis about quantal amplitudes. This option proposes measuring *evoked* currents.\n-   **Analysis:** Incorrect. A simple comparison of mean amplitudes cannot test for multiplicativity, which is a property of the entire amplitude distribution, not just its central tendency.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol is flawed in its induction, measurement, and analysis.\n\n**C. Treat neurons with bicuculline at $20\\,\\mu$M for $48$ h to increase network activity and induce scaling up. Record miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) at $-70$ mV and test for multiplicativity by comparing mean mIPSC amplitude between groups using a paired $t$-test at $\\alpha = 0.05$.**\n\n-   **Induction:** Incorrect. Bicuculline blocks GABA-A receptors, thereby *increasing* network activity. According to the principle of negative feedback, this would induce synaptic scaling *down* (a decrease in strength), not scaling up.\n-   **Measurement:** Incorrect. The problem asks to study excitatory currents (mEPSCs), but this option proposes recording inhibitory currents (mIPSCs).\n-   **Analysis:** Incorrect. As in option B, comparing means is insufficient to demonstrate multiplicativity.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol proposes the opposite induction stimulus and measures the wrong type of synaptic event.\n\n**D. Treat neurons with CNQX at $10\\,\\mu$M plus APV at $50\\,\\mu$M for $48$ h. Record mEPSCs at a holding potential of $-40$ mV without receptor blockers, quantify only mEPSC frequency, and declare multiplicativity if frequency increases by more than $20\\%$ relative to control using a one-sample $t$-test.**\n\n-   **Induction:** Correct. CNQX+APV for $48$ h is a valid method for inducing scaling up.\n-   **Recording:** Incorrect. A holding potential of $-40$ mV results in partial relief of the Mg block from NMDA receptors, contaminating the AMPA receptor currents. Recording without any blockers is poor practice; action potentials are not blocked (no TTX), and inhibitory currents are not blocked (no picrotoxin).\n-   **Analysis:** Fallacious. The primary variable for the hypothesis is amplitude, not frequency. Furthermore, a change in frequency is unrelated to the definition of multiplicative *amplitude* scaling. Homeostatic scaling is not expected to change mEPSC frequency. The entire analytical premise is wrong.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The recording conditions are poor, and the analysis is fundamentally misconceived.\n\n**E. Treat neurons with TTX at $1\\,\\mu$M for $48$ h. Record mEPSCs at $-70$ mV in TTX-containing solution, then normalize each event amplitude by the cell’s mean amplitude and compare the normalized cumulative distributions between control and treated groups by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at $\\alpha = 0.05$; declare multiplicativity if the normalized distributions overlap, without additional regressions or back-scaling analyses.**\n\n-   **Induction:** Correct. TTX for $48$ h is a valid induction method.\n-   **Recording:** Sub-optimal. The use of TTX is correct for isolating miniature events. However, a lack of a GABA-A antagonist (picrotoxin) means inhibitory currents may contaminate the recording baseline, though they would be small or outward at $-70$ mV. Not using APV is a minor omission but acceptable as mEPSCs at this potential are predominantly AMPA-mediated.\n-   **Analysis:** Correct in principle, but incomplete. Normalizing distributions and comparing them with a K-S test is a valid method to test for preserved distribution shape, a key feature of multiplicative scaling. However, the option explicitly states this should be done `without additional regressions or back-scaling analyses`. This makes the protocol less comprehensive and rigorous than the one in Option A, which includes the more direct method of back-scaling. The back-scaling method also provides an estimate of the scaling factor $k$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. While parts of the protocol are valid, it is less complete and rigorous than Option A. The recording pharmacology is incomplete, and the analysis is purposefully limited. Option A represents a superior scientific pipeline. The question asks for the specification of a scientifically sound protocol, and Option A is demonstrably more sound and complete.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A provides the most complete and rigorous experimental and analytical pipeline. It uses correct induction methods, optimal recording pharmacology to isolate the signal of interest, incorporates essential quality controls and statistical power considerations, and employs the gold-standard statistical test for multiplicative scaling. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their logic, methodology, or analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2716636"}, {"introduction": "Observing a change in synaptic strength is only the first step; the next critical task is to pinpoint the underlying mechanism.

By calculating a Bayes factor from hypothetical experimental data, you will practice a powerful method for weighing evidence between competing biological models [@problem_id:2716723].", "problem": "A neuron expresses miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which arise from spontaneous quantal release events. Consider two competing mechanisms for a homeostatic change observed after chronic activity blockade: a multiplicative postsynaptic gain change versus a presynaptic change in release. Use the following fundamental modeling assumptions grounded in standard quantal theory and stochastic point-process descriptions of synaptic release.\n\n1. Quantal amplitude model: The amplitude of an individual mEPSC is proportional to the postsynaptic gain $g$ (for example, the number or conductance of postsynaptic $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors) times a quantal factor $q$, so that the mean mEPSC amplitude scales with $g$.\n2. Spontaneous release model: Each synapse generates spontaneous release events as a Poisson process with rate $r_{s}$, and the whole-cell mEPSC frequency is the sum over synapses, $f=\\sum_{s} r_{s}$. A uniform multiplicative change in presynaptic release probability or spontaneous rate by a factor $p$ scales $f$ by $p$ without changing $q$ or $g$.\n3. Multiplicative postsynaptic scaling: A uniform multiplicative change in postsynaptic gain by a factor $s$ scales the mEPSC amplitude by $s$ while leaving the spontaneous release rates $\\{r_{s}\\}$, and thus $f$, unchanged.\n\nYou record from the same neuron type before and after a manipulation and summarize the outcome as fold changes relative to baseline:\n- Measured fold change in mean mEPSC amplitude $\\hat{A} = 1.20$ with an approximately Gaussian estimation error of standard deviation $\\sigma_{A} = 0.06$ (reflecting averaging over many events).\n- Measured fold change in mEPSC frequency $\\hat{F} = 1.05$ with an approximately Gaussian estimation error of standard deviation $\\sigma_{F} = 0.08$ (reflecting repeated recordings under matched conditions).\n\nAssume the two summary statistics $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{F}$ have independent Gaussian errors around their true fold changes.

A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a Bayes factor, $B$, defined as the ratio of the maximized likelihoods for two competing models, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}}$.\n\nFirst, we define the general likelihood function for the observed data $(\\hat{A}, \\hat{F})$, given the true fold changes $(A_{\\text{true}}, F_{\\text{true}})$. According to the problem statement, the measurement errors are independent and follow Gaussian distributions. The joint probability density function, which serves as the likelihood function, is the product of the individual Gaussian probability densities:\n$$L(A_{\\text{true}}, F_{\\text{true}} \\mid \\hat{A}, \\hat{F}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_A} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - A_{\\text{true}})^2}{2\\sigma_A^2}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{F} - F_{\\text{true}})^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\n$$L(A_{\\text{true}}, F_{\\text{true}} \\mid \\hat{A}, \\hat{F}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - A_{\\text{true}})^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} - \\frac{(\\hat{F} - F_{\\text{true}})^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the postsynaptic model, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}}$. For this model, the true fold changes are specified as $(A_{\\text{true}}, F_{\\text{true}}) = (s, 1)$, where $s$ is a free parameter. The likelihood function for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}}$ is therefore:\n$$L_{\\text{post}}(s \\mid \\hat{A}, \\hat{F}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - s)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} - \\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood, we must find the value of $s$ that maximizes $L_{\\text{post}}$. This is equivalent to minimizing the negative of the exponent. The term involving $s$ is $(\\hat{A} - s)^2$. This term is minimized when $s = \\hat{A}$. Thus, the maximum likelihood estimate for $s$ is $\\hat{s}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\hat{A}$.\nSubstituting this value back into the likelihood function gives the maximized likelihood for the postsynaptic model, $L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}} \\mid \\hat{A}, \\hat{F})$:\n$$L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - \\hat{A})^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} - \\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\n$$L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we perform the same procedure for the presynaptic model, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}}$. For this model, the true fold changes are $(A_{\\text{true}}, F_{\\text{true}}) = (1, p)$, where $p$ is the free parameter. The likelihood function for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}}$ is:\n$$L_{\\text{pre}}(p \\mid \\hat{A}, \\hat{F}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} - \\frac{(\\hat{F} - p)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\nTo maximize this likelihood with respect to $p$, we must minimize the term $(\\hat{F} - p)^2$ in the exponent. This occurs when $p = \\hat{F}$. The maximum likelihood estimate for $p$ is $\\hat{p}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\hat{F}$.\nSubstituting this back gives the maximized likelihood for the presynaptic model, $L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}} \\mid \\hat{A}, \\hat{F})$:\n$$L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} - \\frac{(\\hat{F} - \\hat{F})^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\n$$L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2}\\right)$$\n\nWith the maximized likelihoods for both models, we can now compute the Bayes factor $B$ as defined in the problem:\n$$B = \\frac{L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{post}})}{L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{pre}})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_A\\sigma_F} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2}\\right)}$$\nThe constant pre-factors cancel, yielding:\n$$B = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} - \\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2}\\right)$$\nThis expression provides the analytical solution for the Bayes factor $B$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\hat{A} = 1.20$, $\\sigma_A = 0.06$, $\\hat{F} = 1.05$, and $\\sigma_F = 0.08$.\nThe first term in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{(\\hat{A} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} = \\frac{(1.20 - 1)^2}{2(0.06)^2} = \\frac{(0.20)^2}{2(0.0036)} = \\frac{0.04}{0.0072} = \\frac{400}{72} = \\frac{50}{9}$$\nThe second term in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{(\\hat{F} - 1)^2}{2\\sigma_F^2} = \\frac{(1.05 - 1)^2}{2(0.08)^2} = \\frac{(0.05)^2}{2(0.0064)} = \\frac{0.0025}{0.0128} = \\frac{25}{128}$$\nThe exponent is the difference between these two terms:\n$$\\text{exponent} = \\frac{50}{9} - \\frac{25}{128} = \\frac{50 \\times 128 - 25 \\times 9}{9 \\times 128} = \\frac{6400 - 225}{1152} = \\frac{6175}{1152}$$\nNow we compute the value of $B$:\n$$B = \\exp\\left(\\frac{6175}{1152}\\right) \\approx \\exp(5.360243)$$\n$$B \\approx 212.766$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the final result is $213$.

The samples are:\n- Pre: $\\{9.8,\\;11.2,\\;12.5,\\;14.9,\\;17.6\\}$ pA\n- Post: $\\{12.9,\\;14.4,\\;16.8,\\;19.5,\\;22.4\\}$ pA\n\nAssume that homeostatic scaling, if present, is multiplicative and that the appropriate way to overlay cumulative distributions is to apply a single scalar $s^{\\ast}$ to all post-TTX amplitudes. Assume further that the scalar $s^{\\ast}$ to be used for testing has been pre-specified independently (for instance, from an independent calibration experiment) to equal the ratio of the pre- and post-median amplitudes in the present neuron.\n\nUse only fundamental definitions to reason from first principles:\n- For a random variable $X$, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F_{X}(x) = \\Pr(X \\le x)$.\n- If a manipulation rescales amplitudes $A$ multiplicatively by a constant $s$, then the post-manipulation random variable is $A^{\\prime} = s A$, and $F_{A^{\\prime}}(x) = \\Pr(sA \\le x) = \\Pr(A \\le x/s) = F_{A}(x/s)$, so rescaling $A^{\\prime}$ by $s^{-1}$ overlays $F_{A}$.\n- The two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic for empirical CDFs $\\widehat{F}_{1}$ and $\\widehat{F}_{2}$ is $D = \\sup_{x} \\lvert \\widehat{F}_{1}(x) - \\widehat{F}_{2}(x) \\rvert$.

Multiply every post-TTX amplitude by $s^{\\ast}$ to form a rescaled sample, recompute empirical CDFs for the pre sample and the rescaled post sample, and calculate the two-sample KS statistic on the individual amplitudes (not on binned histograms or smoothed curves). For the given data, $s^{\\ast} = 12.5/16.8$, the observed KS distance is $D = 0.2$, and with $n_{1} = n_{2} = 5$ and $\\alpha = 0.05$, $D_{\\alpha} \\approx 1.36\\sqrt{(5+5)/(5\\cdot 5)} \\approx 0.86$, so the null of identical distributions after rescaling is not rejected.\n\nB.

It provides all necessary information and definitions to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution. Thus, I proceed with the analysis.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe central hypothesis is that the distribution of post-TTX amplitudes, $F_{post}$, is a multiplicatively scaled version of the pre-TTX distribution, $F_{pre}$. If the scaling factor is $c$, such that the post-TTX amplitudes are on average larger, then the underlying random variables are related by $X_{post} \\stackrel{d}{=} c \\cdot X_{pre}$. Consequently, their CDFs are related by $F_{post}(x) = F_{pre}(x/c)$.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we must reverse the scaling on the post-TTX data to check if its distribution then matches the pre-TTX distribution. This is achieved by multiplying the post-TTX data by a factor of $1/c$. The problem specifies that the test scalar $s^{\\ast}$ to be used is an estimate of this factor, calculated as the ratio of medians:\n$$s^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mathrm{median}(A_{pre})}{\\mathrm{median}(A_{post})}$$\n\nThe pre- and post-TTX amplitude samples are provided sorted:\n-   $A_{pre} = \\{9.8,\\;11.2,\\;12.5,\\;14.9,\\;17.6\\}$\n-   $A_{post} = \\{12.9,\\;14.4,\\;16.8,\\;19.5,\\;22.4\\}$\n\nFor a sample of size $n=5$, the median is the 3rd element.\n1.  Calculate the medians:\n    $$ \\mathrm{median}(A_{pre}) = 12.5 \\;\\text{pA} $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{median}(A_{post}) = 16.8 \\;\\text{pA} $$\n\n2.  Calculate the scaling factor $s^{\\ast}$:\n    $$ s^{\\ast} = \\frac{12.5}{16.8} $$\n\n3.  Create the rescaled post-TTX sample, $A'_{post}$, by multiplying each element of $A_{post}$ by $s^{\\ast}$:\n    $$ A'_{post} = \\frac{12.5}{16.8} \\times \\{12.9,\\;14.4,\\;16.8,\\;19.5,\\;22.4\\} $$\n    $$ A'_{post} \\approx \\{9.5982,\\; 10.7143,\\; 12.5,\\; 14.5089,\\; 16.6667\\} $$\n\n4.  Perform the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the sample $A_{pre}$ and the rescaled sample $A'_{post}$ are drawn from the same continuous distribution. The KS statistic, $D$, is the maximum absolute difference between their empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), $\\widehat{F}_{pre}$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}$.\n    The ECDF for a sample of size $n$ is a step function that increases by $1/n$ at each data point. Here, $n_1=n_2=5$, so the step height is $1/5 = 0.2$.\n\n    Let's find the maximum difference by evaluating the ECDFs at the ordered, combined data points:\n    -   For $x \\in [9.5982, 9.8)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.2$. Difference is $0.2$.\n    -   For $x \\in [9.8, 10.7143)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.2$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.2$. Difference is $0$.\n    -   For $x \\in [10.7143, 11.2)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.2$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.4$. Difference is $0.2$.\n    -   For $x \\in [11.2, 12.5)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.4$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.4$. Difference is $0$.\n    -   At $x=12.5$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(12.5)=3/5=0.6$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(12.5)=3/5=0.6$. The difference is $0$.\n    -   For $x \\in [12.5, 14.5089)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.6$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.6$. Difference is $0$.\n    -   For $x \\in [14.5089, 14.9)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.6$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.8$. Difference is $0.2$.\n    -   For $x \\in [14.9, 16.6667)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.8$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 0.8$. Difference is $0$.\n    -   For $x \\in [16.6667, 17.6)$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 0.8$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 1.0$. Difference is $0.2$.\n    -   For $x \\ge 17.6$, $\\widehat{F}_{pre}(x) = 1.0$ and $\\widehat{F}'_{post}(x) = 1.0$. Difference is $0$.\n\n    The maximum difference observed is $D = 0.2$.\n\n5.  Calculate the critical value $D_{\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n    $$ D_{0.05} \\approx c(0.05)\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{n_{1}+n_{2}}{n_{1}n_{2}}} = 1.36 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{5+5}{5 \\times 5}} = 1.36 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{25}} = 1.36 \\times \\sqrt{0.4} $$\n    $$ D_{0.05} \\approx 1.36 \\times 0.63245... \\approx 0.860 $$\n\n6.  Compare the statistic to the critical value.\n    The observed statistic is $D=0.2$. The critical value is $D_{0.05} \\approx 0.86$.\n    Since $D  D_{0.05}$ ($0.2  0.86$), we do not reject the null hypothesis. This result is consistent with the hypothesis of multiplicative synaptic scaling.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Compute $s^{\\ast}$ as the ratio of medians, $s^{\\ast} = \\mathrm{median}(\\text{Pre})/\\mathrm{median}(\\text{Post})$. Multiply every post-TTX amplitude by $s^{\\ast}$ to form a rescaled sample, recompute empirical CDFs for the pre sample and the rescaled post sample, and calculate the two-sample KS statistic on the individual amplitudes (not on binned histograms or smoothed curves). For the given data, $s^{\\ast} = 12.5/16.8$, the observed KS distance is $D = 0.2$, and with $n_{1} = n_{2} = 5$ and $\\alpha = 0.05$, $D_{\\alpha} \\approx 1.36\\sqrt{(5+5)/(5\\cdot 5)} \\approx 0.86$, so the null of identical distributions after rescaling is not rejected.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option correctly describes the procedure dictated by the problem statement. It correctly identifies the method for calculating $s^{\\ast}$, the multiplicative rescaling of the post-TTX sample, and the use of the two-sample KS test on the raw empirical CDFs. The numerical calculations for $s^{\\ast}$, the KS statistic $D$, the critical value $D_{\\alpha}$, and the final conclusion are all identical to my derivation.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Compute an additive shift $b^{\\ast} = \\mathrm{mean}(\\text{Pre}) - \\mathrm{mean}(\\text{Post})$, add $b^{\\ast}$ to each post-TTX amplitude, smooth both CDFs with a kernel, and then compare the smoothed CDFs with a paired $t$-test on the rescaled amplitudes to decide whether the CDFs overlap.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on multiple fundamental points. First, it proposes an *additive* correction, which contradicts the problem's premise of *multiplicative* scaling. Second, it suggests smoothing the CDFs, whereas the standard KS test is applied to the non-smoothed empirical CDFs. Third, it proposes a paired $t$-test, which is inappropriate; a $t$-test compares means, not entire distributions, and the data are not paired.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. $z$-score both samples by subtracting their respective means and dividing by their respective standard deviations, compare normalized histograms for visual overlap, and use a chi-square goodness-of-fit test on binned counts to assess whether the post-TTX distribution matches the pre-TTX distribution.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option describes a procedure for testing if two distributions have the same shape, ignoring differences in mean and variance. While multiplicative scaling implies a preservation of shape (and thus equal $z$-scored distributions), this is not the specific procedure mandated by the problem. The problem explicitly defines $s^{\\ast}$ based on medians for rescaling. Furthermore, it specifies the KS test, not a chi-square test, which requires binning and typically has less power for continuous data.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Fit a linear regression with nonzero intercept to the rank-ordered pre versus post amplitudes to estimate both a slope and an intercept; use the fitted slope as $s^{\\ast}$ and then apply a one-sample KS test comparing the rescaled post-TTX sample to the pre-TTX empirical CDF to assess equality.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option proposes an alternative method (quantile-quantile plot regression) for estimating the scaling parameter. This contradicts the problem's explicit instruction to use the ratio of medians. A pure multiplicative scaling model implies a linear relationship through the origin, so fitting a nonzero intercept is also questionable for this specific hypothesis. Finally, it suggests a one-sample KS test when a two-sample test is the standard and more appropriate method for comparing two empirical samples.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2716687"}]}
