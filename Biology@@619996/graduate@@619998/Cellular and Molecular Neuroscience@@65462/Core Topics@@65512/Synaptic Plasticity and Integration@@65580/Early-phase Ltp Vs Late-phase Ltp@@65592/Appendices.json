We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem states that the dephosphorylation of CaMKII, denoted by $p(t)$, follows first-order kinetics. This is defined as the instantaneous rate of loss being proportional to the current amount. Mathematically, this is expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot p(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive rate constant. The negative sign indicates a decrease, or loss, of the species $p(t)$.\n\nTo find the amount of phosphorylated CaMKII as a function of time, we must solve this differential equation. We can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dp(t)}{p(t)} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial amount $p(0)$ to the amount at time $t$, $p(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{p(0)}^{p(t)} \\frac{1}{p'} dp' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln(p') \\right]_{p(0)}^{p(t)} = \\left[ -k t' \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(p(t)) - \\ln(p(0)) = -k t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(t)}{p(0)}\\right) = -k t\n$$\nTo solve for $p(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{p(t)}{p(0)} = \\exp(-k t)\n$$\nThus, the expression for the amount of phosphorylated CaMKII at time $t$ is:\n$$\np(t) = p(0) \\exp(-k t)\n$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of a substance to decay to half of its initial value. By this definition, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the amount $p(t_{1/2})$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} p(0)$.\nWe substitute this condition into our derived equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} p(0) = p(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nThe initial amount $p(0)$ is non-zero and cancels from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k t_{1/2}))\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives the analytic expression for the half-life in terms of the rate constant $k$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided rate constant $k = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$, we find:\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.01} \\, \\mathrm{min} \\approx 69.3147 \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx 69.31 \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$\nQualitatively, this calculated half-life of approximately $69$ minutes is of critical importance in understanding the temporal dynamics of synaptic plasticity. Early-phase LTP (E-LTP) is a form of synaptic strengthening that lasts for $1-3$ hours and relies on the post-translational modification of existing proteins within the synapse, most notably the autophosphorylation of CaMKII. The persistence of E-LTP is directly tied to the lifetime of these molecular modifications. Our calculated timescale, where half of the activated CaMKII is deactivated in about an hour, aligns perfectly with the transient nature of E-LTP. The dephosphorylation of CaMKII by PP1 acts as a molecular clock that limits the duration of this early phase of memory.\n\nIn contrast, late-phase LTP (L-LTP) is a much more stable form of plasticity, lasting for many hours to days, and it underlies long-term memory formation. L-LTP is fundamentally distinct from E-LTP because it requires the synthesis of new proteins and structural changes at the synapse. The cellular signal that induces LTP, if sufficiently strong and persistent, will also trigger gene expression and de novo protein synthesis. These newly created proteins are then targeted to the potentiated synapse to consolidate the strengthening in a permanent manner. The instability of the phosphorylated state of CaMKII, as quantified by its half-life, necessitates this second, more robust mechanism for long-term information storage. Therefore, the relatively rapid decay of the pCaMKII signal explains why E-LTP is transient and why a separate, synthesis-dependent process (L-LTP) is required for enduring memories.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{69.31}\n$$", "id": "2709470"}, {"introduction": "To create an enduring memory trace, the synapse must convert a transient electrical signal into a stable structural change, a process that requires new protein synthesis.

It is free from ambiguity and subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine which protocol, R or T, satisfies the two stated conditions for L-LTP induction. This requires analyzing the peak calcium concentration, $C_{\\max}$, generated by each protocol and considering the likelihood of concurrent neuromodulator release.\n\nThe calcium concentration $C(t)$ is governed by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{C}{\\tau} = A\\sum_k \\delta(t-t_k) $$\nBetween spikes, the solution is a simple exponential decay. At each spike time $t_k$, the concentration instantaneously increases by $A$. The solution for the peak concentration immediately after the $n$-th spike at time $t_n$, which occurred at time $\\Delta t_{n-1} = t_n - t_{n-1}$ after the previous spike, is given by the recursive relation:\n$$ C(t_n^+) = C(t_{n-1}^+) e^{-\\Delta t_{n-1}/\\tau} + A $$\n\n**Analysis of Protocol R (Regular)**\n\nFor Protocol R, the spikes are delivered at $5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so the inter-spike interval is constant: $\\Delta t = 1/5\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The ratio of the inter-spike interval to the decay constant is $\\Delta t / \\tau = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s} / 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1$.\n\nLet $C_n$ be the peak calcium concentration immediately after the $n$-th spike.\n$C_1 = A$\n$C_2 = C_1 e^{-1} + A = A(1 + e^{-1})$\n$C_3 = C_2 e^{-1} + A = A(1 + e^{-1} + e^{-2})$\nBy induction, the peak calcium after the $n$-th spike is a geometric series:\n$$ C_n = A \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (e^{-1})^k = A \\frac{1 - (e^{-1})^n}{1 - e^{-1}} $$\nThe maximum concentration will occur after the final ($40$-th) spike.\n$$ C_{\\max} = C_{40} = A \\frac{1 - e^{-40}}{1 - e^{-1}} $$\nUsing the given parameters $A=0.5$:\n$$ C_{\\max} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{1 - e^{-40}}{1 - e^{-1}} \\approx 0.5 \\times \\frac{1 - 1.24 \\times 10^{-18}}{1 - 0.36788} \\approx 0.5 \\times \\frac{1}{0.63212} \\approx 0.791 $$\nThe peak calcium for Protocol R is $C_{\\max} \\approx 0.791$. This value is less than the required threshold for L-LTP, $\\theta = 1.2$.\nTherefore, Protocol R fails to satisfy condition (i).\nFurthermore, the problem states that for \"isolated, evenly spaced spikes\", neuromodulator release is \"weak\". So Protocol R also fails to satisfy condition (ii).\n\n**Analysis of Protocol T (Theta-burst)**\n\nFor Protocol T, we have bursts of $4$ spikes at $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The intra-burst inter-spike interval is $\\Delta t_{intra} = 1/100\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The ratio $\\Delta t_{intra}/\\tau = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s} / 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.05$. Because $\\Delta t_{intra} \\ll \\tau$, there is very little decay between spikes within a burst, leading to strong temporal summation of calcium.\n\nLet us calculate the peak calcium at the end of the first burst (after the 4th spike):\n$$ C_{peak, burst} = A \\sum_{k=0}^{3} e^{-k \\cdot (\\Delta t_{intra}/\\tau)} = A \\sum_{k=0}^{3} (e^{-0.05})^k $$\n$$ C_{peak, burst} = 0.5 \\times \\left(1 + e^{-0.05} + e^{-0.10} + e^{-0.15}\\right) $$\n$$ C_{peak, burst} \\approx 0.5 \\times (1 + 0.9512 + 0.9048 + 0.8607) = 0.5 \\times 3.7167 \\approx 1.858 $$\nThe peak calcium for Protocol T is $C_{\\max} \\approx 1.858$. This value is significantly greater than the threshold $\\theta = 1.2$.\nTherefore, Protocol T satisfies condition (i).\n\nNow, consider condition (ii). The problem states that phasic neuromodulator release \"preferentially follows synchronous, high-frequency bursts embedded in the theta band ($4$–$8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$)\". Protocol T consists of high-frequency ($100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) bursts delivered at $5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is squarely within the specified theta band. This pattern is ideal for triggering the required neuromodulatory signal.\nTherefore, Protocol T satisfies condition (ii).\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\n\nProtocol T successfully meets both criteria for L-LTP induction: it generates suprathreshold calcium peaks due to rapid spike summation within bursts, and its burst pattern at a theta frequency effectively recruits the necessary neuromodulatory systems for protein synthesis-dependent plasticity. Protocol R fails on both counts. Protocol T is therefore far more likely to engage L-LTP.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Protocol T, because temporally clustered bursts produce large, summating NMDA-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ transients that exceed the threshold $\\theta$ and, by organizing spikes into theta-frequency bursts, preferentially recruit phasic dopamine/norepinephrine that activate cAMP–PKA–CREB–dependent gene expression required for L-LTP.**\nThis option correctly identifies Protocol T as the more effective one. The reasoning given aligns perfectly with my derivation. It correctly notes that (1) the clustered bursts lead to summating calcium transients that exceed the threshold $\\theta$, and (2) the theta-frequency structure of the bursts recruits the neuromodulatory input required for the synthesis-dependent phase of LTP. The reference to NMDA-dependence is consistent with the problem's preamble.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Protocol R, because with identical total spike count the time-integrated $Ca^{2+}$ load is the same in both protocols, and L-LTP depends only on integrated $Ca^{2+}$ without any requirement for neuromodulators or peak amplitude.**\nThis option is incorrect. While the total time-integrated calcium may be the same ($\\int C(t) dt = A \\cdot N_{spikes} \\cdot \\tau$), the conclusion that L-LTP depends *only* on this integral is a direct contradiction of the problem statement. The problem explicitly defines L-LTP dependence on a peak amplitude threshold ($\\theta$) and on neuromodulatory signals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Protocol T is less likely to produce L-LTP, because high-frequency bursts primarily activate calcium-dependent phosphatases that induce long-term depression and suppress neuromodulator release via autoreceptors, preventing protein synthesis.**\nThis option is incorrect. It claims Protocol T is less likely, which contradicts the analysis. The reasoning introduces biophysical mechanisms (activation of phosphatases for LTD) that are not part of the model provided, and it directly contradicts the given premise that burst firing *recruits* neuromodulator release, not suppresses it. One must solve the problem based on the rules provided, not on unstated, alternative biophysical theories.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both protocols are equally likely to produce L-LTP, because NMDA receptor unblock depends only on depolarization from any single spike, and neuromodulator release is tonic and independent of spike timing pattern.**\nThis option is incorrect. It claims equal likelihood, which is false. The reasoning is flawed on two counts. First, it claims neuromodulator release is \"tonic and independent of spike timing pattern\", which directly contradicts the problem's explicit statement that release is phasic and pattern-dependent. Second, the idea that NMDA unblocking depends \"only on depolarization from any single spike\" ignores the critical role of temporal summation in achieving the strong depolarization needed for substantial calcium influx, which is the very basis for the calcium dynamics modeled.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Protocol R, because the longer overall duration of stimulation maintains sustained subthreshold $Ca^{2+}$ elevations that more effectively couple to nuclear transcription than brief peaks in Protocol T.**\nThis option is incorrect. It incorrectly favors Protocol R. The justification claims that \"sustained subthreshold\" calcium is more effective. This is in direct violation of the explicitly stated rule for L-LTP, which requires a *suprathreshold* peak calcium event ($C_{\\max} \\ge \\theta$). My analysis showed Protocol R produces only subthreshold calcium levels.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2709487"}, {"introduction": "Once long-term potentiation has been successfully induced and stabilized, a central experimental question is to identify the physical locus of the synaptic change.

The specific postulates are:\n- The number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors increases by $40\\%$.\n- The release probability, $p$, remains unchanged.\n- The number of functional release sites, $N$, remains unchanged.\n\nThe quantal size, $q$, is the postsynaptic current generated by a single vesicle's worth of neurotransmitter acting on postsynaptic receptors. Assuming a linear relationship, a $40\\%$ increase in the number of AMPA receptors will cause a $40\\%$ increase in the quantal size. The new quantal size, $q_Q$, is therefore $q_Q = q_0 \\times (1 + 0.40) = 1.4\\,q_0$.\n\nWe now compute the expected new mEPSC frequency, $f_Q$, and amplitude, $A_Q$.\n\nFor the amplitude, $A \\propto q$. The change in amplitude is directly proportional to the change in $q$.\n$$ \\frac{A_Q}{A_0} = \\frac{q_Q}{q_0} = \\frac{1.4\\,q_0}{q_0} = 1.4 $$\nTherefore, the new amplitude is:\n$$ A_Q = 1.4 \\times A_0 = 1.4 \\times 10.0\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{pA} $$\n\nFor the frequency, $f \\propto Np$. Since both $N$ and $p$ are stated to remain unchanged, the mEPSC frequency will also remain unchanged.\n$$ f_Q = f_0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\n\nThus, under Hypothesis Q, we expect the mEPSC amplitude to increase to $14.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and the mEPSC frequency to remain at $2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nNow we evaluate each of the provided options against our derived results.\n\n*   **A. Under Hypothesis P: $f$ increases to $3.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $A$ remains $10.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$; under Hypothesis Q: $A$ increases to $14.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and $f$ remains $2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.**\n    This option precisely matches our calculations for both hypotheses. The predicted outcome for Hypothesis P ($f_P = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $A_P = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$) is stated correctly. The predicted outcome for Hypothesis Q ($A_Q = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, $f_Q = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) is also stated correctly.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Under Hypothesis P: $A$ increases to $15.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and $f$ remains $2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$; under Hypothesis Q: $f$ increases to $2.8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $A$ remains $10.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.**\n    This option confuses the loci of expression. It incorrectly attributes an amplitude change to the presynaptic hypothesis and a frequency change to the postsynaptic hypothesis. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of quantal analysis. The numerical values are also incorrect. For Hypothesis P, the amplitude should not change, and for Hypothesis Q, the frequency should not change under the given assumptions.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Under Hypothesis P: both $f$ and $A$ increase by $50\\%$; under Hypothesis Q: $A$ increases by $40\\%$ and $f$ decreases.**\n    For Hypothesis P, the statement that amplitude increases is false. For Hypothesis Q, the statement that frequency decreases is false; it should remain constant.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Under Hypothesis P: $f$ increases to $4.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $A$ remains $10.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$; under Hypothesis Q: $A$ increases to $14.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and $f$ increases to $2.8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ due to unsilencing.**\n    For Hypothesis P, the calculated frequency is wrong. A $50\\%$ increase from $2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is $3.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, not $4.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. For Hypothesis Q, it correctly identifies the amplitude change but incorrectly claims the frequency increases. The introduction of \"unsilencing\" as a cause for frequency change contradicts the premise of Hypothesis Q, which explicitly states that $N$ (the number of release sites) and $p$ (release probability) are constant. Unsilencing typically refers to the insertion of AMPARs at synapses that were previously \"silent\" (lacked AMPARs), which effectively increases $N$, the number of *functional* synapses that can generate a detectable current. This contradicts the constraints given for Hypothesis Q.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, only option A is consistent with the provided model and initial conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2709498"}]}
