While the specific capacitance $C_m$ is provided, it is irrelevant for a direct current (DC) steady-state analysis, as capacitive current $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt}$ is zero when the voltage is constant. The instruction to approximate the semi-infinite cable with an infinite cable solution is a minor ambiguity, but it provides a clear directive for simplification, which we will follow. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we define the resistance per unit length for the cylindrical cable. The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ divided by the circumference of the cylinder, $2\\pi a$.\n$$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}$$\nThe units are $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}$.

It is given by:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{V}{r_m} + c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nwhere $c_m = 2\\pi a C_m$ is the membrane capacitance per unit length.\n\nFor a steady-state DC input, the voltage does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = 0$. The cable equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = \\frac{V}{r_m}$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form:\n$$\\frac{r_m}{r_i} \\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = V$$\nBy definition, the space constant $\\lambda$ is the parameter that satisfies the equation $\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = V$.

The input is at a distance $x$ from the soma (at position $0$). The attenuation factor $A$ is the ratio $V(0)/V(x)$. The problem states to use the steady-state solution for an infinite cable to approximate the behavior. In an infinite cable, the voltage decays exponentially from the source in both directions.

This is captured by the instability condition:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d I_{total}}{dV}\\right|_{V=V_0} < 0\n$$\nThe total slope conductance is the sum of the individual slope conductances:\n$$\n\\frac{d I_{total}}{dV} = \\frac{dI_L}{dV} + \\frac{dI_{ax}}{dV} + \\frac{dI_{Na}}{dV} + \\frac{dI_A}{dV}\n$$\nThe first two terms are ohmic, giving constant slope conductances:\n$\\frac{dI_L}{dV} = g_L$ and $\\frac{dI_{ax}}{dV} = g_{ax}$.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Slope Conductances for Voltage-Gated Currents**\n\nWe derive the slope conductance $\\frac{dI_{Na}}{dV}$ and $\\frac{dI_{A}}{dV}$ using the product rule of differentiation on the given current expressions.\n\nFor the fast sodium current $I_{Na}(V) = g_{Na} \\, h_0 \\, m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}} \\, (V - E_{Na})$, we treat $g_{Na}$, $h_0$, $p_{Na}$, and $E_{Na}$ as constants. Using the product rule on the voltage-dependent terms $f(V) = m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}}$ and $g(V) = (V - E_{Na})$:\n$$\n\\frac{d I_{Na}}{dV} = g_{Na} h_0 \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}} (V - E_{Na}) \\right] = g_{Na} h_0 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{d}{dV} m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}}\\right) (V - E_{Na}) + m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}} \\left(\\frac{d}{dV}(V - E_{Na})\\right) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule to the first term and noting $\\frac{d}{dV}(V - E_{Na}) = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{d I_{Na}}{dV} = g_{Na} h_0 \\left[ p_{Na} \\, m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}-1} \\left(\\frac{d m_{\\infty}}{dV}\\right) (V - E_{Na}) + m_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{Na}} \\right]\n$$\nEvaluating this expression at the holding potential $V = V_0$, we obtain the linearized contribution:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d I_{Na}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = g_{Na} h_0 \\left[ p_{Na} \\, m_{\\infty}(V_0)^{p_{Na}-1} \\left. \\frac{d m_{\\infty}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} (V_0 - E_{Na}) + m_{\\infty}(V_0)^{p_{Na}} \\right]\n$$\nThe derivation for the A-type potassium current $I_A(V) = g_{A} \\, b_0 \\, a_{\\infty}(V)^{p_{A}} \\, (V - E_{K})$ is structurally identical. The resulting slope conductance at $V=V_0$ is:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d I_{A}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = g_{A} b_0 \\left[ p_{A} \\, a_{\\infty}(V_0)^{p_{A}-1} \\left. \\frac{d a_{\\infty}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} (V_0 - E_{K}) + a_{\\infty}(V_0)^{p_{A}} \\right]\n$$\nThese are the required closed-form expressions for the linearized contributions.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation and Analysis of Critical Sodium Conductance**\n\nThe boundary between failure and success of bAP propagation is defined by the condition where the total slope conductance is zero:\n$$\n\\left. \\fracd I_{total}}{dV}\\right|_{V=V_0} = g_L + g_{ax} + \\left. \\frac{d I_{Na}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} + \\left. \\frac{d I_{A}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = 0\n$$\nWe introduce the per-conductance slope terms $S_{Na}(V_0) = \\frac{1}{g_{Na}} \\left.\\frac{d I_{Na}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0}$ and $S_A(V_0) = \\frac{1}{g_A} \\left.\\frac{d I_A}{dV}\\right|_{V_0}$.

Solving for $g_{Na}$:\n$$\ng_{Na}^{crit} S_{Na}(V_0) = - \\left( g_L + g_{ax} + g_{A} S_{A}(V_0) \\right)\n$$\n$$\ng_{Na}^{crit} = \\frac{-(g_L + g_{ax} + g_{A} S_A(V_0))}{S_{Na}(V_0)} = \\frac{g_L + g_{ax} + g_{A} S_A(V_0)}{-S_{Na}(V_0)}\n$$\nThis is the required affine form.\n\nFor $g_{Na}^{crit}$ to be finite and positive, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The denominator must be non-zero and finite: $S_{Na}(V_0) \\neq 0$.\n2.  The entire expression must be positive.\n\nLet us analyze the signs of the terms. All conductances ($g_L, g_{ax}, g_A$) are non-negative.\nThe term $S_A(V_0)$ represents the slope of the potassium current. Since $V_0 = -40$ mV and $E_K = -80$ mV, the driving force $(V_0 - E_K)$ is positive. The activation function $a_{\\infty}(V_0)$, its derivative $\\left.\\frac{d a_{\\infty}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0}$, and the constants $b_0$ and $p_A$ are all positive. Therefore, every term contributing to $S_A(V_0)$ is positive, meaning $S_A(V_0) > 0$. This current is restorative, opposing depolarization, and thus has a positive slope conductance.\nThe term $S_{Na}(V_0)$ represents the slope of the sodium current. The driving force $(V_0 - E_{Na})$ is negative since $V_0 = -40$ mV and $E_{Na} = 60$ mV. Consequently, the term $p_{Na} m_{\\infty}^{p_{Na}-1} \\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV} (V_0 - E_{Na})$ is negative. The other term, $m_{\\infty}^{p_{Na}}$, is positive. The regenerative nature of the action potential relies on the sodium current's a region of negative slope conductance, where the influx of sodium ions upon depolarization leads to further depolarization. This requires the negative term in $S_{Na}(V_0)$ to outweigh the positive term, making the overall sum negative.\nThus, the condition for a physically meaningful bAP mechanism is $S_{Na}(V_0) < 0$.\n\nIf $S_{Na}(V_0) < 0$, the denominator of $g_{Na}^{crit}$, which is $-S_{Na}(V_0)$, becomes positive. The numerator, $g_L + g_{ax} + g_A S_A(V_0)$, is a sum of positive terms and is therefore positive. The ratio of two positive numbers is positive. Therefore, the condition under which $g_{Na}^{crit}$ is finite and positive is precisely $S_{Na}(V_0) < 0$.\n\nQualitatively, a bAP fails if the available sodium conductance $g_{Na}$ is less than the critical value $g_{Na}^{crit}$. The value of $g_{Na}^{crit}$ is determined by the load imposed by passive and active shunting currents. A failure to invade a distal dendrite occurs when:\n-   The stabilizing axial leak ($g_{ax}$) to the parent dendrite is too high.\n-   The restorative A-type K+ current is too strong (high $g_A$) or too readily activated near $V_0$ (large $S_A(V_0)$).\n-   The regenerative capacity of the sodium current itself is weak ($-S_{Na}(V_0)$ is small), for example, due to significant inactivation (small $h_0$).\nEach of these factors increases the numerator or decreases the denominator's magnitude in the expression for $g_{Na}^{crit}$, thereby raising the threshold sodium conductance required for a successful bAP.\n\n**Task 3: Implementation**\n\nThe derived formulae are implemented in Python to compute $g_{Na}^{crit}$ for the provided test cases. The implementation computes the necessary activation functions and their derivatives at $V_0$, then calculates $S_A(V_0)$ and $S_{Na}(V_0)$, and finally computes $g_{Na}^{crit}$. It checks if $S_{Na}(V_0) \\ge 0$ and returns 'nan' as specified.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[1.3934,3.0478,2.7836,0.6120,2.3223]}$$", "id": "2707836"}]}
