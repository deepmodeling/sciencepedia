It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to predict the effect of a high concentration ($10$ mM) of the fast $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator BAPTA on two distinct forms of LTD: NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD. The analysis must be based on the provided first principles, specifically the differential requirements for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling.\n\n**1. Analysis of NMDAR-LTD**\n\nNMDAR-LTD is induced by low-frequency stimulation, which causes a modest but prolonged influx of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ through NMDAR channels into the postsynaptic spine. According to principle (b), the induction of NMDAR-LTD is gated by the activation of the $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent enzymes calmodulin (CaM) and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B, or calcineurin). These enzymes, particularly PP2B, require a sustained elevation of cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ to a level of several hundred nanomolar to low micromolar. This $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signal must be spatially distributed throughout a significant portion of the spine cytoplasm to effectively engage the phosphatase cascade. It is not a highly localized \"nanodomain\" signal, but rather a more diffuse \"microdomain\" signal.\n\nWe are given that the internal solution contains $10$ mM BAPTA, which is a very high concentration. Principle (a) dictates how such a buffer affects $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ dynamics. As a fast ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is large), high-affinity ($K_d = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is small) chelator present at high concentration, BAPTA will rapidly bind any free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ions that enter the spine. The high buffer concentration ensures a large sink for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, effectively preventing the free cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration from rising significantly above resting levels and collapsing its spatial spread. Consequently, the diffuse, spine-wide $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signal required to activate CaM and PP2B will not be established. Without the activation of this phosphatase cascade, the downstream events leading to LTD will not occur.\n\nTherefore, the prediction is that $10$ mM BAPTA will abolish NMDAR-LTD.\n\n**2. Analysis of mGluR-LTD**\n\nmGluR-LTD is induced by activation of Gq-coupled group I mGluRs. According to principle (c), this activation initiates a signaling cascade via PLC$\\beta$, leading to the production of the second messengers $\\text{IP}_3$ and DAG. This pathway is explicitly stated to drive a form of LTD that is protein synthesis-dependent and does *not* require a *large* postsynaptic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ elevation.\n\nThe primary signaling mechanism is chemical, not ionic. The key effectors are downstream of PLC$\\beta$. For example, DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), and the pathway as a whole triggers rapid, local protein synthesis, which is a hallmark of this form of LTD. While $\\text{IP}_3$ can act on $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum to release $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, principle (c) emphasizes that a large cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ increase is not a prerequisite for the induction of mGluR-LTD. The core machinery can proceed via the G-protein/PLC$\\beta$/DAG/PKC/protein-synthesis axis.\n\nIn the presence of $10$ mM BAPTA, any $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ released from internal stores would be rapidly chelated. However, since the induction mechanism is not critically dependent on this $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ rise, its buffering by BAPTA should not prevent the LTD. The primary G-protein signaling pathway remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the prediction is that $10$ mM BAPTA will spare (i.e., not block) mGluR-LTD.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe analysis indicates that NMDAR-LTD will be abolished due to its strict dependence on a diffuse cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signal, which is suppressed by BAPTA. In contrast, mGluR-LTD will be spared because its primary induction mechanism is a G-protein-coupled pathway that does not require a large elevation in cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $10$ mM BAPTA abolishes NMDAR-LTD but spares mGluR-LTD; fast buffering collapses the diffuse, spine-wide $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signal needed to activate CaM/PP2B for NMDAR-LTD, whereas mGluR-LTD initiation proceeds primarily through G protein–PLC signaling and local translation with minimal dependence on cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ rise.**\nThis statement perfectly aligns with the derived conclusion. It correctly predicts the divergent outcomes for the two LTD forms and provides the correct biophysical and biochemical reasoning based on the provided principles. The distinction between the diffuse $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signal for NMDAR-LTD and the G-protein-centric mechanism for mGluR-LTD is accurately captured. **Correct**.\n\n**B. $10$ mM BAPTA blocks mGluR-LTD but not NMDAR-LTD; NMDAR-LTD depends on nanodomain $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signals tightly coupled to NMDAR pores that are resistant to buffering, whereas mGluR-LTD requires diffuse $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ elevations that BAPTA suppresses.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It inverts the $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-dependency of the two pathways. The prolonged, modest $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signal for NMDAR-LTD is susceptible to a high concentration of a fast buffer. The assertion that this signal is a \"nanodomain\" resistant to buffering is typically associated with sensors very close to the channel pore, such as those for LTP, not the phosphatase activation for LTD. It also incorrectly posits a strong $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ requirement for mGluR-LTD, contrary to principle (c). **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $10$ mM BAPTA enhances NMDAR-LTD by lowering $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ to favor phosphatase over kinase activation, and has no effect on mGluR-LTD; the reduced $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ level selectively biases signaling toward depression.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that lower $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ levels favor phosphatases over kinases (the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro or \"BCM\" theory), a concentration of $10$ mM BAPTA will not simply \"lower\" the signal into an optimal range for LTD. It will clamp the $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration near rest, abolishing the signal required for phosphatase activation altogether. Buffering is not enhancement in this case; it is elimination. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Both NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD are abolished by $10$ mM BAPTA; all LTD induction mechanisms in CA1 require substantial increases in cytosolic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ that are prevented by fast buffering.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The assertion that *all* LTD mechanisms require substantial $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ increases is a false generalization. It directly contradicts principle (c), which specifies that mGluR-LTD can proceed without a large postsynaptic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ elevation. Therefore, while it correctly predicts the blockade of NMDAR-LTD, it is wrong about mGluR-LTD. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. NMDAR-LTD is unaffected, whereas mGluR-LTD is enhanced by $10$ mM BAPTA; chelation relieves $\\text{IP}_3$ receptor auto-inhibition by $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, promoting mGluR-LTD while leaving NMDAR-driven LTD intact.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It wrongly claims NMDAR-LTD is unaffected; as derived, it is highly sensitive to BAPTA. The proposed mechanism for enhancement of mGluR-LTD (relieving $\\text{IP}_3$R autoinhibition) is a real but secondary effect; it does not represent the primary outcome, and more importantly, the premise concerning NMDAR-LTD is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2722030"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the initial induction signal is critical, we now move downstream to dissect the molecular machinery that translates this signal into a lasting change.

[@problem_id:2722014]", "problem": "A Purkinje neuron long-term depression (LTD) protocol is implemented in acute cerebellar slices by pairing parallel fiber input with a climbing fiber depolarizing conjunctive stimulus. Assume the following widely accepted bases: synaptic LTD is a long-lasting reduction in synaptic efficacy due to a durable change in the postsynaptic state; in cerebellar Purkinje cells, conjunctive stimulation raises intracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and activates Protein Kinase C (PKC), which is necessary for LTD; the expression of Purkinje cell LTD is mediated by a reduction in synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA receptor) content at parallel fiber synapses; and phosphorylation-dependent control of trafficking of glutamate receptor subunit A2 (GluA2) is central to this process. The small molecule bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X is a competitive PKC inhibitor. The GluA2 S880A mutation replaces serine at position 880 with alanine, removing a PKC phosphorylation site in the GluA2 cytoplasmic tail that modulates interactions with Glutamate Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (GRIP1) and Protein Interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1). You perform two manipulations:\n\n$1$. Apply GF109203X exclusively during the induction epoch and wash it out immediately afterward; in a separate set of recordings, apply GF109203X only after a stable LTD has been established.\n\n$2$. Express GluA2 S880A in Purkinje cells in otherwise wild-type slices and apply the same LTD induction protocol.\n\nPredict the effect of each manipulation on LTD induction and on LTD maintenance, and justify whether each manipulation would be expected to block induction, expression, or both. Choose the option that best matches the correct pattern and mechanistic justification.\n\nA. GF109203X prevents LTD induction when present only during the pairing but does not reverse an already established LTD; GluA2 S880A permits upstream induction signaling but blocks expression/maintenance by preventing AMPA receptor endocytosis driven by GluA2 phosphorylation-dependent switching between GRIP1 and PICK1.\n\nB. GF109203X predominantly disrupts LTD maintenance while sparing induction, because induction relies on $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ alone; GluA2 S880A blocks induction but not expression because phosphorylation is only needed to trigger PKC activation upstream.\n\nC. Both GF109203X and GluA2 S880A block both induction and maintenance to a similar extent because both abolish PKC signaling at an early, shared step that is equally required for all phases.\n\nD. GF109203X has no effect on Purkinje cell LTD because cerebellar LTD is PKC independent; GluA2 S880A enhances LTD by stabilizing PICK1 binding in the absence of phosphorylation, thereby accelerating AMPA receptor removal.\n\nE. GF109203X prevents LTD induction and also reverses established LTD by restoring synaptic AMPA receptors; GluA2 S880A has no effect because other serine residues fully compensate for loss of serine at position 880.", "solution": "Begin from core definitions and well-tested mechanisms. Long-term depression (LTD) in cerebellar Purkinje cells is a durable decrease in synaptic strength produced by conjunctive parallel fiber and climbing fiber activity. Conjunctive stimulation elevates postsynaptic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and generates diacylglycerol, which together activate Protein Kinase C (PKC). Purkinje cell LTD expression is mediated by a net loss of synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA receptors) from parallel fiber synapses. The trafficking of AMPA receptors depends critically on phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor subunit A2 (GluA2) at serine 880 (S880) in the C terminus, which regulates protein–protein interactions with Glutamate Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (GRIP1) and Protein Interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1). Phosphorylation at S880 by PKC destabilizes GRIP1 anchoring and promotes PICK1-dependent endocytosis, providing a well-supported route for expression of LTD as AMPA receptor internalization. Thus, PKC activity is required for induction signaling, and GluA2 S880 phosphorylation is required for the structural trafficking change that constitutes expression.\n\nManipulation $1$: GF109203X is a competitive inhibitor at the PKC catalytic site. If GF109203X is present only during the induction epoch, PKC cannot phosphorylate its substrates, including GluA2 S880, so the induction cascade fails to convert the conjunctive $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$/diacylglycerol signal into the downstream trafficking program. Therefore, LTD will not be induced. Conversely, if GF109203X is applied only after LTD has been established, AMPA receptors have already been internalized and redistributed. PKC activity is not required to maintain that already-achieved receptor distribution on the time scale of typical maintenance measurements; PKC inhibition does not provide a mechanism to acutely return internalized receptors to the synapse. Therefore, post hoc application of GF109203X is not expected to reverse or erase an established LTD. This profile is characteristic of an induction blocker rather than an expression/maintenance blocker.\n\nManipulation $2$: GluA2 S880A removes the PKC phosphorylation site. Upstream induction signals—$\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ elevation, diacylglycerol formation, and PKC activation—can still occur, but the critical step of phosphorylating GluA2 at S880 cannot. Without that modification, GRIP1 anchoring of AMPA receptors persists, and PICK1-mediated internalization is impaired. Thus, the neuron can detect and transduce the induction signal, but it cannot implement the trafficking change that expresses and maintains LTD. Operationally, LTD fails to appear because expression is blocked. Because the receptors are not removed, there is likewise no maintenance of a depressed state to discuss; the deficit is at the expression step.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\nA. States that GF109203X prevents induction when present during pairing but does not reverse established LTD, and that GluA2 S880A permits induction signaling but blocks expression/maintenance by preventing phosphorylation-dependent switching between GRIP1 and PICK1, thereby preventing AMPA receptor endocytosis. This matches the analysis: PKC inhibition is an induction-phase block and does not reverse expression; S880A is an expression-phase block.\n\nVerdict — Correct.\n\nB. Claims that GF109203X disrupts maintenance while sparing induction, attributing induction to $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ alone, and that GluA2 S880A blocks induction but not expression. This is inconsistent with established mechanisms: PKC catalytic activity is required during induction to phosphorylate substrates; induction is not supported by $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ alone without PKC. Furthermore, S880A specifically blocks the phosphorylation-dependent trafficking step, i.e., expression, not upstream induction signaling.\n\nVerdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Claims both manipulations block both induction and maintenance equivalently. While both manipulations prevent the appearance of LTD, their locus is not equivalent: GF109203X is an induction blocker that does not reverse established LTD, whereas S880A is an expression blocker. Lumping them as equivalently blocking maintenance is inaccurate.\n\nVerdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Claims PKC independence of cerebellar LTD and that S880A enhances LTD by stabilizing PICK1 binding without phosphorylation. This contradicts strong evidence that cerebellar Purkinje cell LTD is PKC dependent and that phosphorylation at S880 is required to bias binding away from GRIP1 toward PICK1. Without phosphorylation, PICK1 binding is reduced and AMPA receptor removal is impeded, not enhanced.\n\nVerdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Claims GF109203X reverses established LTD by restoring synaptic AMPA receptors and that S880A has no effect due to compensation by other serines. Acute PKC inhibition lacks a mechanism to rapidly reinsert internalized receptors and generally does not reverse established LTD on the relevant timescale. Moreover, other serines do not fully compensate for loss of S880 in controlling GRIP1/PICK1 interactions; S880 is specifically implicated in LTD expression.\n\nVerdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2722014"}, {"introduction": "The previous practices established that a key expression mechanism for many forms of LTD is the enhanced endocytosis of postsynaptic receptors. This final exercise moves from qualitative reasoning to quantitative modeling, allowing you to formalize this process and calculate its direct impact on synaptic efficacy.
