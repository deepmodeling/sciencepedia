The analysis will proceed from first principles of current conservation and Ohm's law under the given approximations.\n\nFirst, we must define the relevant electrical parameters per unit length of the cable. The dendrite is modeled as a cylinder of diameter $d$.\n\nThe membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{area}$) divided by the circumference of the cylinder, $\\pi d$.\n$$\nr_m = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}\n$$\nThe units of $r_m$ are $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{length}$.

Let $V(x)$ be the membrane potential relative to rest, $i_a(x)$ be the axial current flowing in the positive $x$ direction, and $i_m(x)$ be the membrane current density (current per unit length) leaking out of the cable.\n\nBy Ohm's law, the voltage drop along the axial resistor $r_a dx$ is given by:\n$$\ndV = V(x+dx) - V(x) = -i_a(x) (r_a dx)\n$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, this becomes a differential relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dx} = -i_a r_a \\quad \\implies \\quad i_a(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_a} \\frac{dV}{dx}\n$$\n\nFor current conservation, the change in axial current over the segment $dx$ must be equal to the current that leaves through the membrane.\n$$\ndi_a = i_a(x+dx) - i_a(x) = -i_m(x) dx\n$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{di_a}{dx} = -i_m(x)\n$$\nThe problem states that the membrane is ohmic and linearized around rest, so the membrane current density $i_m$ is directly proportional to the voltage $V(x)$ across the membrane, with the proportionality constant being $1/r_m$.\n$$\ni_m(x) = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}\n$$\nThe problem also specifies steady-state conditions, so any capacitive currents are zero.\n\nNow we combine these equations.

The solution thus simplifies to:\n$$\nV(x) = A \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is determined by the condition at the proximal end, $x=0$. We are given that the voltage at this point is a fixed value, which we denote as $V(0)$.\n$$\nV(0) = A \\exp(0) = A\n$$\nThus, the specific solution for the voltage along a semi-infinite cable is:\n$$\nV(x) = V(0) \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\n\nThe attenuation ratio $V(x)/V(0)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{V(x)}{V(0)} = \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio using the provided numerical parameters.

Since $x_{coll} < x_f$ (i.e., $187.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} < 250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), the bAP is still actively regenerating when it reaches the collision point. Therefore, the collision does occur as calculated, and is not prevented by the failure of the bAP.\n\nThe fundamental principles of excitable media dictate the outcome of such a collision. Action potentials are nonlinear waves that depend on the excitability of the medium immediately ahead of them. The propagation is sustained by the activation of voltage-gated Na$^+$ channels. Following an action potential, the membrane enters an absolute refractory period ($T_{\\mathrm{abs}}$) during which these channels are inactivated and cannot be reopened. When the two spikes meet at $x_{coll}$, the dendritic spike front encounters membrane at $x < x_{coll}$ that has just been depolarized by the bAP and is thus refractory. Conversely, the bAP front encounters membrane at $x > x_{coll}$ that has just been depolarized by the dendritic spike and is also refractory. Neither front can propagate through the refractory wake of the other. Consequently, both spikes must terminate upon collision. This phenomenon is known as mutual annihilation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n- **A.
