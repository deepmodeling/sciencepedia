Consider a single glutamatergic synapse whose excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) results from the sum of currents through independent AMPAR channels. Use the following well-tested biophysical bases: (i) for a set of ion channels with identical single-channel conductance and driving force, the macroscopic current is the sum of single-channel currents, so that for $N$ available receptors with open probability $p_{o}$, single-channel conductance $\\gamma$, and driving force $(V - E_{\\text{rev}})$, the EPSC amplitude satisfies $I = N\\,p_{o}\\,\\gamma\\,(V - E_{\\text{rev}})$; (ii) during the expression phase of LTP mediated by AMPAR insertion, $p_{o}$, $\\gamma$, and $(V - E_{\\text{rev}})$ remain unchanged, so that the EPSC amplitude scales linearly with the number of synaptic AMPARs.

It is objective and free of logical contradictions. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem states that the EPSC amplitude, $I$, is directly proportional to the number of synaptic AMPARs, $N$.
