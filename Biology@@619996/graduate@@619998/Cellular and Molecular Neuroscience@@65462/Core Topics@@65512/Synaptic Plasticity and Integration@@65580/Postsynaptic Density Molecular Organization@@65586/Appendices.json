The copy numbers are within physiologically realistic ranges. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a stoichiometric calculation (a classic limiting reactant problem). The inclusion of Shank is a non-conflicting distractor, as the problem constrains the system to only the PSD-95–GKAP interaction. The problem is objective and uses precise scientific language. It does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the maximum possible number of product molecules formed from two reactants with given initial quantities. This is a problem of stoichiometry and identification of the limiting reactant.\n\nLet the molecular species be denoted as follows:\n- $P$: PSD-95\n- $G$: GKAP\n- $C$: The binary complex formed by PSD-95 and GKAP.\n\nThe initial copy numbers of the reactants are given as:\n- $N_{P, \\text{initial}} = 300$\n- $N_{G, \\text{initial}} = 200$\n\nThe problem states that the copy number for Shank ($N_{\\text{Shank}} = 150$) is also provided. However, the system is explicitly constrained to the binary interaction between PSD-95 and GKAP, with the condition that \"no other reactions deplete these pools.\" Therefore, the information about Shank is irrelevant to the calculation and must be disregarded.\n\nThe formation of the binary complex occurs with a strict $1:1$ stoichiometry. The reaction can be written as:\n$$ P + G \\longrightarrow C $$\nThis equation indicates that one molecule of $P$ reacts with one molecule of $G$ to produce one molecule of $C$.\n\nThe theoretical maximum number of complexes, $N_{C, \\text{max}}$, is limited by the reactant that is available in the smallest quantity relative to the stoichiometric requirement. Since the stoichiometric ratio is $1:1$, the maximum number of complexes is directly limited by the reactant with the lower initial copy number.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of complexes formed. To form $x$ complexes, $x$ molecules of $P$ and $x$ molecules of $G$ must be consumed. The number of complexes is therefore constrained by the initial availability of each reactant:\n$$ x \\le N_{P, \\text{initial}} \\implies x \\le 300 $$\n$$ x \\le N_{G, \\text{initial}} \\implies x \\le 200 $$\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, $x$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two initial amounts. The maximum possible value for $x$ is thus:\n$$ N_{C, \\text{max}} = \\min(N_{P, \\text{initial}}, N_{G, \\text{initial}}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ N_{C, \\text{max}} = \\min(300, 200) = 200 $$\n\nThe theoretical maximum number of PSD-95–GKAP binary complexes that can form is $200$.\n\nThe second part of the query is to identify the limiting component. The limiting component (or limiting reactant) is the reactant that is completely consumed when the reaction proceeds to its maximum extent. In this case, forming $200$ complexes will consume $200$ molecules of GKAP, exhausting its entire initial pool ($200$ out of $200$). In contrast, only $200$ molecules of PSD-95 will be consumed, leaving a surplus of $300 - 200 = 100$ molecules of PSD-95.\n\nBecause the pool of GKAP is depleted first, GKAP is the limiting component for the formation of the binary complex.\n\nThe question asks for the final answer to be the maximum number of complexes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{200}$$", "id": "2739105"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting molecules, the organization of the PSD is dictated by the strength of their interactions. This practice bridges the gap between molecular counts and functional complexes by exploring the concept of equilibrium binding affinity, defined by the dissociation constant ($K_D$).

Your justification should not use any pre-memorized multivalency formulas but should rely on equilibrium reasoning and the concept of local effective concentration. Only the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ requires a numerical answer.", "solution": "The problem will be addressed in two parts as specified. First, the fractional occupancy for the monovalent interaction will be calculated. Second, the effect of divalency on the effective dissociation constant will be justified based on first principles.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in biophysical chemistry concerning ligand-receptor binding equilibria. All provided data are consistent and sufficient for a solution.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Fractional Occupancy ($\\theta$)\n\nThe interaction between the single PDZ domain on the scaffold protein ($P$) and the ligand ($L$) is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$ P + L \\rightleftharpoons PL $$\nwhere $PL$ is the protein-ligand complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, at equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]} $$\nwhere $[P]$ is the concentration of free protein, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[PL]$ is the concentration of the protein-ligand complex.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total protein binding sites that are occupied by the ligand. For a protein with a single binding site, this is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\text{concentration of occupied protein}}{\\text{total concentration of protein}} = \\frac{[PL]}{[P]_{total}} $$\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass for the protein states that the total concentration of protein, $[P]_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of the free protein and the bound protein:\n$$ [P]_{total} = [P] + [PL] $$\n\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $K_D$ and $[L]$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to solve for $[P]$:\n$$ [P] = \\frac{K_D [PL]}{[L]} $$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[P]$ into the conservation of mass equation:\n$$ [P]_{total} = \\frac{K_D [PL]}{[L]} + [PL] $$\n\nWe can factor out $[PL]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$ [P]_{total} = [PL] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [PL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we rearrange this equation to find the ratio $\\frac{[PL]}{[P]_{total}}$, which is the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PL]}{[P]_{total}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]} $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nEquilibrium dissociation constant: $K_D = 1\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\nFree ligand concentration: $[L] = 10\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{10\\ \\mu\\text{M}}{1\\ \\mu\\text{M} + 10\\ \\mu\\text{M}} = \\frac{10}{11} $$\n\nTo express this as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ \\theta \\approx 0.909090... \\approx 0.9091 $$\n\nPart 2: Justification for the Effect of Divalency\n\nThe problem asks to justify the change in the *effective* dissociation constant ($K_{D,eff}$) for the overall scaffold-ligand association when the scaffold's valency is increased from one to two. The justification must be based on first principles of mass action and effective concentration.\n\nAn increase in valency from one to two introduces multivalency, which results in a phenomenon known as avidity or the chelate effect. This leads to a significant increase in the overall binding affinity, which corresponds to a *decrease* in the effective dissociation constant, $K_{D,eff}$. The justification rests on two primary physical principles.\n\n1.  **Statistical Effect on the Association Rate:** A divalent scaffold molecule has two independent binding sites. When interacting with a solution of monovalent ligands, the probability of an initial encounter leading to a binding event is doubled compared to a monovalent scaffold. This means the effective association rate constant ($k_{on,eff}$) for the first binding event is approximately twice the microscopic association rate constant ($k_{on,micro}$) for a single site. All else being equal, this statistical advantage alone would halve the dissociation constant for the initial binding step ($K_{D,1} = k_{off,micro} / (2k_{on,micro}) = K_{D,micro}/2$).\n\n2.  **Effective Concentration and the Dissociation Rate:** This is the more dominant effect. Consider a divalent scaffold where one site is already bound to a ligand. The second, unbound PDZ domain is now physically tethered via the scaffold's backbone, holding it in close proximity to the first binding site. In the crowded environment of the PSD, this has a profound impact on the overall dissociation process. For the entire scaffold molecule to dissociate from the ligand-bearing surface or cluster, both binding sites must be simultaneously unbound. If one ligand dissociates from its PDZ domain, the scaffold remains tethered by the second bound site. Furthermore, the now-free PDZ domain experiences an extremely high *effective local concentration* of other ligands in its immediate vicinity. It can rapidly rebind the same ligand before it diffuses away or bind to an adjacent ligand. This process of rapid intramolecular rebinding drastically reduces the probability of the scaffold fully dissociating per unit time. Consequently, the overall effective dissociation rate constant ($k_{off,eff}$) is significantly lower than the microscopic off-rate ($k_{off,micro}$) for a single site.\n\nIn summary, the duplication of the PDZ domain increases the effective association rate due to a statistical advantage and, more critically, decreases the effective dissociation rate due to the effects of tethering and high local effective concentration. Since the effective dissociation constant is the ratio of the effective off-rate to the effective on-rate ($K_{D,eff} = k_{off,eff} / k_{on,eff}$), a decrease in the numerator ($k_{off,eff}$) and an increase in the denominator ($k_{on,eff}$) both contribute to a substantial *decrease* in the value of $K_{D,eff}$. A lower dissociation constant signifies a higher overall binding affinity (avidity).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9091}\n$$", "id": "2739088"}, {"introduction": "The postsynaptic density is a highly dynamic structure, with proteins constantly binding and unbinding from the scaffold.

A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe fluorescence recovery process is dictated by the kinetics of the mobile fraction of scaffold proteins. The problem states that recovery is a single-exponential process and is \"dominated by reversible binding,\" with diffusion being comparatively fast. This is the definition of the reaction-limited regime.\n\nIn this regime, the rate-limiting step for the recovery of fluorescence in the bleached spot is the dissociation of photobleached molecules from their binding sites. The concentration of available unbleached (fluorescent) protein in the surrounding pool is assumed to be constant and its transport to the binding site is not rate-limiting. Therefore, as soon as a bleached molecule dissociates from a site, a fluorescent molecule from the reservoir immediately occupies it.\n\nLet $[B_b](t)$ be the concentration of bleached protein bound to synaptic sites at time $t$ after the photobleaching event. The dissociation of these molecules is a first-order process governed by the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ \\frac{d[B_b](t)}{dt} = -k_{\\text{off}} [B_b](t) $$\nThe solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay:\n$$ [B_b](t) = [B_b](0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t) $$\nwhere $[B_b](0)$ is the concentration of bound bleached molecules immediately after bleaching at $t=0$.\n\nThe fluorescence intensity in the bleached region, $F(t)$, is proportional to the concentration of fluorescent bound molecules, $[B_f](t)$. The recovery of fluorescence occurs as bleached molecules dissociate and are replaced by fluorescent ones. The total concentration of binding sites within the mobile pool is constant. Thus, the increase in fluorescent bound molecules must mirror the decrease in bleached bound molecules.\nThe fluorescence signal $F(t)$ will recover from its initial post-bleach value, $F(0)$, to a final plateau value, $F_{\\infty}$, according to:\n$$ F(t) = F_{\\infty} - (F_{\\infty} - F(0)) \\exp(-k_{obs} t) $$\nThe problem states this recovery is a single-exponential process. Based on our analysis of the rate-limiting step, the observed rate constant, $k_{obs}$, must be the microscopic dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$. This is because the overall rate of recovery is dictated by the slowest step in the sequence, which is the unbinding of bleached molecules.\nTherefore, $k_{obs} = k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nThe half-time of recovery, $t_{1/2}$, is the time at which the fluorescence has recovered halfway to its plateau. For a first-order process, it is related to the rate constant by:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{obs}} $$\nSubstituting $k_{obs} = k_{\\text{off}}$, we obtain the direct relationship between the experimental observable $t_{1/2}$ and the microscopic rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nFrom this, we can derive the expression for $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we use the provided value $t_{1/2} = 60\\ \\text{s}$ to estimate $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{60\\ \\text{s}} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$, we compute:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{60}\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.01155245\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} \\approx 1.16 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe mobile fraction of $0.4$ indicates that only $40\\%$ of the total protein population is involved in these dynamics, while the other $60\\%$ is immobile on this timescale. This information is contextual and does not enter the calculation of $k_{\\text{off}}$ for the mobile population itself.\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative reasoning. We consider the effect of increasing the density of ligand binding sites, $L$, within the PSD.\n(a) Effect on apparent mobile fraction: The mobile fraction can be viewed as the fraction of protein molecules in the unbound, diffusive state at equilibrium. The binding reaction is $P + S \\rightleftharpoons PS$. According to the law of mass action, increasing the concentration of one reactant (the binding sites $S$, whose density is $L$) will shift the equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of the product ($PS$). This means a larger proportion of the protein population will exist in the bound state at any given moment, and a smaller proportion will be in the free state. Consequently, the apparent mobile fraction, interpreted as the instantaneously free population, is expected to decrease.\n\n(b) Effect on recovery half-time $t_{1/2}$: As established, in the binding-limited regime, the recovery half-time is determined by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_{\\text{off}}$. The dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$ is an intrinsic property of the bond between the scaffold protein and its ligand site. It reflects the stability of the complex and is independent of the concentration of free proteins or available sites. Therefore, increasing the site density $L$ does not alter $k_{\\text{off}}$. As a result, the recovery half-time $t_{1/2}$ is expected to remain unchanged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.16 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "2739138"}]}
