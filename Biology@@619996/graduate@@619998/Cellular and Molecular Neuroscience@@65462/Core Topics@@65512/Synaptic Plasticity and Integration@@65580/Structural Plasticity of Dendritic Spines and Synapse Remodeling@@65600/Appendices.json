A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the rise in free calcium concentration, $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, resulting from an instantaneous influx of $N$ calcium ions. We shall proceed from the fundamental principles stipulated.\n\nFirst, the total concentration of calcium ions added to the spine volume $V$ must be calculated. Concentration, denoted by square brackets, is defined as the number of moles of a substance per unit volume. The number of moles corresponding to $N$ ions is $N/N_{A}$. Therefore, the total increase in calcium concentration, $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{N}{N_{A} V} $$\nThis added calcium partitions between two states: free ions in the cytosol and ions bound to endogenous buffers. According to the principle of conservation of mass (as per assumption iv), the total increase in concentration is the sum of the increase in the free concentration and the increase in the bound concentration:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{bound}} $$\nThe problem provides the definition of the calcium binding ratio, $\\kappa$, as the incremental ratio of bound to free calcium concentration changes:\n$$ \\kappa \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{bound}}}{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{free}}} $$\nGiven the assumption (iii) that the system remains in the linear range around the resting concentration, this differential ratio can be approximated by the ratio of finite changes ($\\Delta$):\n$$ \\kappa \\approx \\frac{\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{bound}}}{\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}} $$\nThis is a crucial step enabled by the problem's explicit assumption. From this, we express the change in bound calcium in terms of the change in free calcium:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\kappa \\cdot \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression into the conservation equation:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\kappa \\cdot \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} $$\nFactoring $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = (1 + \\kappa) \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} $$\nThe factor $(1 + \\kappa)$ represents the total buffering power of the system. It describes how much the total calcium must increase to achieve a unit increase in free calcium. We can now solve for our target variable, $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}}}{1 + \\kappa} $$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}}$ yields the complete analytical solution:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\kappa} \\left( \\frac{N}{N_{A} V} \\right) $$\nNow, we proceed with the numerical computation.

It describes a standard biophysical model (first-order kinetics for FRAP) applied to a realistic scenario in cellular neuroscience (actin dynamics in dendritic spines). All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided, the terminology is precise, and the values are physically plausible. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe first objective is to derive the relationship between the recovery half-time $t_{1/2}$ and the rate constant $k$ from first principles. According to Assumption 1, the fluorescence recovery follows first-order kinetics. Let $F(t)$ be the fluorescence intensity at time $t$ after photobleaching. Let $F_0$ be the initial fluorescence at $t=0$ (post-bleach) and $F_\\infty$ be the final, fully recovered fluorescence intensity (at $t \\to \\infty$). The rate of recovery is proportional to the remaining difference between the current and final fluorescence levels. This is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dF(t)}{dt} = k(F_\\infty - F(t)) $$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant. To solve this ordinary differential equation, we define a new variable $y(t) = F_\\infty - F(t)$. Then, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{dF}{dt}$. Substituting these into the kinetic equation gives:\n$$ -\\frac{dy}{dt} = k y(t) $$\nThis is a separable differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{y} = -k dt $$\nWe integrate from the initial condition at $t=0$, where $y(0) = F_\\infty - F(0) = F_\\infty - F_0$, to a general time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{y(0)}^{y(t)} \\frac{1}{y'} dy' = \\int_0^t -k dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(y(t)) - \\ln(y(0)) = -kt $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{y(t)}{y(0)}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides and substituting back for $F(t)$ yields the equation for the time evolution of fluorescence:\n$$ \\frac{F_\\infty - F(t)}{F_\\infty - F_0} = \\exp(-kt) $$\n$$ F(t) = F_\\infty - (F_\\infty - F_0)\\exp(-kt) $$\nThe recovery half-time, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the fluorescence to reach half of the total recovery range. That is, the fluorescence level is exactly halfway between the initial post-bleach level $F_0$ and the final plateau $F_\\infty$.\n$$ F(t_{1/2}) = F_0 + \\frac{1}{2}(F_\\infty - F_0) = \\frac{F_\\infty + F_0}{2} $$\nSubstituting this definition into the recovery equation:\n$$ \\frac{F_\\infty + F_0}{2} = F_\\infty - (F_\\infty - F_0)\\exp(-kt_{1/2}) $$\nWe solve for the exponential term:\n$$ (F_\\infty - F_0)\\exp(-kt_{1/2}) = F_\\infty - \\frac{F_\\infty + F_0}{2} = \\frac{F_\\infty - F_0}{2} $$\nSince $F_\\infty > F_0$ (recovery occurs), we can divide both sides by the non-zero term $(F_\\infty - F_0)$:\n$$ \\exp(-kt_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$ -kt_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) $$\nThis yields the fundamental relationship between the first-order rate constant and the half-time:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nThe second objective is to find a closed-form expression for the fold change in the effective actin treadmilling rate, $F = r_{\\mathrm{stim}}/r_{\\mathrm{base}}$. From Assumption 2, the treadmilling rate $r$ is directly proportional to the FRAP recovery rate constant $k$, with $r = \\alpha k$. The proportionality constant $\\alpha$ is independent of the condition (baseline or stimulated).\nThus, we can write the rates for the baseline and stimulated conditions:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\alpha k_{\\mathrm{base}} $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{stim}} = \\alpha k_{\\mathrm{stim}} $$\nThe fold change $F$ is the ratio of the stimulated rate to the baseline rate:\n$$ F = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{stim}}}{r_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{stim}}}{\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{stim}}}{k_{\\mathrm{base}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the derived relationship between $k$ and $t_{1/2}$ into this expression for $F$. For the stimulated and baseline conditions, the rate constants are:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{stim}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{stim}}} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{base}}} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{stim}}}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{base}}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{stim}}} \\cdot \\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{base}}}{\\ln(2)} $$\nThe $\\ln(2)$ terms cancel, resulting in the final expression for the fold change in terms of the recovery half-times:\n$$ F = \\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{base}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{stim}}} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the fold change in the underlying kinetic rate is simply the inverse ratio of the measured half-times. A shorter half-time corresponds to a faster rate.\n\nThe final objective is to evaluate $F$ using the provided experimental values: $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{base}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{stim}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ F = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{s}}{10\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 3 $$\nThe fold change in the effective actin treadmilling rate is $3$. The synaptic stimulation caused a three-fold increase in the rate of actin turnover within the dendritic spine head.
