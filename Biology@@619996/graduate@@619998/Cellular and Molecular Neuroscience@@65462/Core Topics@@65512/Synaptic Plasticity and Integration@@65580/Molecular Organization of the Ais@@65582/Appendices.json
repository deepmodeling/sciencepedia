The values for concentrations and dissociation constants are physiologically plausible. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are detected.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is determined to be valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, in terms of the dissociation constant, $K_d$, and the free concentration of ankyrin-G, $[A]$. We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe definition of the dissociation constant is:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[N][A]}{[NA]}$$\nThe total concentration of the Nav motif is:\n$$[N]_T = [N] + [NA]$$\nFrom this second equation, we can express the concentration of free Nav motif, $[N]$, as:\n$$[N] = [N]_T - [NA]$$\nWe substitute this expression for $[N]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([N]_T - [NA])[A]}{[NA]}$$\nOur objective is to find an expression for $\\theta = \\frac{[NA]}{[N]_T}$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe analysis will proceed by dissecting the functional consequences of replacing Nav$1.6$ with Nav$1.2$ at the distal AIS, based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Effect on Spike Threshold**: Spike initiation occurs when the net membrane current becomes inward, driven by the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels. The problem states that Nav$1.6$ has a larger persistent sodium current ($I_{\\mathrm{Na,p}}$) than Nav$1.2$. A persistent current is a non-inactivating or very slowly-inactivating current that is active at subthreshold membrane potentials. The larger $I_{\\mathrm{Na,p}}$ of Nav$1.6$ provides a steady depolarizing influence near the firing threshold, effectively lowering the voltage at which the regenerative, all-or-none action potential is triggered. Replacing Nav$1.6$ with Nav$1.2$, which has a smaller $I_{\\mathrm{Na,p}}$, removes this subthreshold depolarizing boost. Consequently, the membrane potential must be driven to a more positive value by the external stimulus to reach the point of spike initiation. Therefore, the spike threshold will become **more depolarized**. The reduced subthreshold inward current also implies a slower rate of depolarization just prior to threshold, leading to a decrease in the rapidness of spike onset.\n\n2.  **Effect on Repetitive Firing and Adaptation**: High-frequency repetitive firing is critically dependent on the ability of sodium channels to recover from inactivation during the brief interspike interval (ISI). The baseline firing is at $80\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to an ISI of $1/80\\,\\mathrm{s} = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    - In the unmanipulated neuron, the presence of Nav$1.6$ channels with their **fast recovery from inactivation** allows a large fraction of channels to return to the available (closed but not inactivated) state during the $12.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ ISI. This ensures that the availability factor, $h$, is nearly fully restored before each subsequent spike, allowing for sustained high-frequency firing with minimal decline in spike amplitude or increase in ISI. This accounts for the \"minimal spike-frequency adaptation\".\n    - In the engineered neuron, the distal AIS now contains Nav$1.2$ channels, which are characterized by **slower recovery from inactivation**. During a high-frequency train of action potentials, the short $12.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ ISI is now insufficient for Nav$1.2$ channels to fully recover. With each spike, a fraction of channels inactivate, and only a smaller portion of these manage to recover before the next spike is due. This leads to a progressive, spike-by-spike decrease in the population of available sodium channels, a phenomenon known as **cumulative inactivation**.\n    - The mathematical consequence of cumulative inactivation is that the value of the availability variable $h$ at the start of each successive spike decreases throughout the train. According to the equation $I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} h (V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$, a lower $h$ results in a smaller maximum sodium conductance and thus a smaller peak sodium current.\n    - This has two major effects:\n        - **Reduced Spike Amplitude**: The peak of the action potential will progressively decrease during the train.\n        - **Stronger Spike-Frequency Adaptation**: A smaller available sodium current means that the membrane depolarizes more slowly towards threshold for subsequent spikes. This lengthens the ISI. An increasing ISI over time is, by definition, spike-frequency adaptation. The steady-state firing frequency, reached after some number of spikes, will be significantly **lower** than the initial $80\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    - Furthermore, the smaller resurgent current of Nav$1.2$ also contributes to slowing the firing rate. Resurgent current is a transient inward current that flows upon repolarization, helping to depolarize the neuron after a spike and promote the next one. Its reduction in the modified neuron would further increase the ISI.\n\n**Conclusion**: The replacement of Nav$1.6$ with Nav$1.2$ is expected to cause a more depolarized spike threshold, an increase in spike-frequency adaptation, a reduction in the steady-state firing frequency, and a decrease in spike amplitude during a train.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

It correctly links the smaller persistent current to a more depolarized threshold. It correctly identifies slower recovery from inactivation as the cause of cumulative inactivation (a progressive decrease in $h$), which in turn leads to stronger spike-frequency adaptation (reduced steady-state frequency) and a reduction in spike amplitude during the train.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Spike threshold becomes more hyperpolarized and onset rapidness increases; steady-state firing frequency at the same current increases because Nav$1.2$ activates faster and its smaller persistent current reduces inactivation.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The spike threshold becomes more depolarized, not more hyperpolarized. The steady-state firing frequency decreases, not increases. The reasoning that a \"smaller persistent current reduces inactivation\" is biophysically nonsensical.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Steady-state firing frequency at the same current is unchanged because total sodium channel density is preserved; only the spike initiation site shifts slightly, without affecting adaptation or threshold.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option makes a fundamental error in logic. It incorrectly assumes that because total channel *density* is constant, neuronal function must be constant. Firing dynamics are governed by channel *kinetics* (rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery), not merely by their number. As derived, both threshold and adaptation are significantly affected.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Spike threshold becomes more depolarized, but steady-state firing frequency at the same current increases because the smaller persistent current of Nav$1.2$ prevents cumulative inactivation, producing more regular, less adapting firing.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option correctly identifies the change in spike threshold but is incorrect about its consequences. The steady-state frequency decreases, not increases. The reasoning that a smaller persistent current \"prevents cumulative inactivation\" is false; cumulative inactivation is a function of recovery kinetics, not persistent current. The expected outcome is stronger adaptation, not less.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2729647"}]}
