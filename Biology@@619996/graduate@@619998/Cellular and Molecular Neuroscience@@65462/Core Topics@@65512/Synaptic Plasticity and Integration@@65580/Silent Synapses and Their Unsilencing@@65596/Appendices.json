Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution will be constructed.\n\nThe first task is to derive the symbolic expression for the fraction of unblocked NMDARs, $B(V_m)$, as a function of membrane potential.

It accurately describes the fundamental biophysical properties of AMPA and NMDA receptors, including the voltage-dependent magnesium block of NMDARs, which is a cornerstone of synaptic physiology. The probabilistic model for neurotransmitter release is a standard and valid approach for analyzing quantal data. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe solution will be executed in four parts as requested.\n\nFirst, the mechanistic explanation for the change in detectability of NMDAR-only excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) as a function of holding potential. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a ligand-gated ion channel that is also voltage-dependent. This voltage dependence is conferred by an open-channel block by extracellular magnesium ions, $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$. At hyperpolarized, or negative, membrane potentials such as $V_{h} = -70\\,\\text{mV}$, the positively charged $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion is electrostatically driven into the channel pore. Even when glutamate binds to the receptor and the channel's gate opens, the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion physically occludes the pore, preventing the passage of other ions like $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. Consequently, there is negligible current flow through the NMDAR, and synapses possessing only NMDARs are functionally \"silent\" or undetectable. When the membrane is depolarized to a positive potential, such as $V_{d} = +40\\,\\text{mV}$, the electrostatic gradient across the membrane is reversed. This creates a repulsive force that expels the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion from the channel pore. With the block relieved, the binding of glutamate now results in a significant ionic current, making the NMDAR-only synapse \"unsilenced\" and thus detectable.\n\nSecond, we will derive the expressions for the stimulus-evoked failure probabilities $F_{h}$ and $F_{d}$. A \"failure\" is defined as the absence of a detectable postsynaptic current following a stimulus. The probability of release at any single site is $p$, and thus the probability of non-release at any single site is $1-p$. Releases at different sites are independent events.\n\nAt the hyperpolarized holding potential, $V_{h}$, only synapses containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are detectable. The problem states that a fraction $s$ of the $n$ sites are silent (NMDAR-only), so the fraction of detectable, non-silent sites (containing AMPARs) is $1-s$. The total number of such detectable sites is $n(1-s)$. A total failure to detect a response at $V_{h}$, denoted by $F_{h}$, occurs if and only if there is no glutamate release at any of these $n(1-s)$ detectable sites. Due to the independence of release events, this probability is the product of the individual non-release probabilities for all detectable sites.\n$$F_{h} = (1-p)^{n(1-s)}$$\n\nAt the depolarized holding potential, $V_{d}$, the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ block of NMDARs is relieved. Therefore, all synapses, both those with AMPARs and those with only NMDARs, are detectable. The total number of detectable sites is the total number of release sites, which is $n$. A total failure at $V_{d}$, denoted by $F_{d}$, occurs if there is no glutamate release at any of the $n$ sites.\n$$F_{d} = (1-p)^{n}$$\n\nThird, we will derive a closed-form expression for the fraction of silent synapses, $s$, in terms of the measurable failure rates $F_{h}$ and $F_{d}$. We have the two equations derived above:\n$$F_{h} = (1-p)^{n(1-s)}$$\n$$F_{d} = (1-p)^{n}$$\nWe can rewrite the first equation using the rules of exponents:\n$$F_{h} = \\left((1-p)^{n}\\right)^{1-s}$$\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $F_{d}$ into this equation:\n$$F_{h} = (F_{d})^{1-s}$$\nTo solve for $s$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation. This is a valid operation since failure probabilities $F_{h}$ and $F_{d}$ must be positive (in this case, between $0$ and $1$).\n$$\\ln(F_{h}) = \\ln\\left((F_{d})^{1-s}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(x^{y}) = y \\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$\\ln(F_{h}) = (1-s) \\ln(F_{d})$$\nNow, we can isolate the term $(1-s)$ by dividing by $\\ln(F_d)$. This is permissible as long as $F_d \\neq 1$, which is true for any system with a non-zero release probability.\n$$1-s = \\frac{\\ln(F_{h})}{\\ln(F_{d})}$$\nFinally, we solve for $s$:\n$$s = 1 - \\frac{\\ln(F_{h})}{\\ln(F_{d})}$$\nThis expression gives the fraction of silent synapses purely in terms of experimentally measurable failure rates, eliminating the microscopic parameters $n$ and $p$.\n\nFourth, we will compute the numerical value of $s$ using the provided experimental data: $F_{h} = 0.51$ at $V_{h} = -70\\,\\text{mV}$ and $F_{d} = 0.17$ at $V_{d} = +40\\,\\text{mV}$. We substitute these values into our derived expression for $s$:\n$$s = 1 - \\frac{\\ln(0.51)}{\\ln(0.17)}$$\nWe compute the values of the natural logarithms:\n$$\\ln(0.51) \\approx -0.67334474$$\n$$\\ln(0.17) \\approx -1.77195684$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(0.51)}{\\ln(0.17)} \\approx \\frac{-0.67334474}{-1.77195684} \\approx 0.3800004$$\nFinally, we calculate $s$:\n$$s \\approx 1 - 0.3800004 \\approx 0.6199996$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain:\n$$s \\approx 0.620$$\nThis result implies that approximately $62\\%$ of the synapses in this connection are silent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.620}$$", "id": "2751733"}, {"introduction": "The \"unsilencing\" of silent synapses is a key mechanism of developmental and activity-dependent plasticity, but what is the underlying molecular change?

The concepts of silent synapses, LTP, AMPA and NMDA receptors, the binomial model of transmitter release, and paired-pulse ratio are standard and well-defined.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It presents a clear set of experimental data and asks for the most consistent mechanistic inference. The provided data are sufficient to evaluate the proposed hypotheses.\n\nThe language is objective and precise. The data are numerically specified.\n\nThe problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary definitions and models (binomial model, PPR) for interpretation. The assumption to neglect noise and quantal variance simplifies the analysis to rely on the provided formulas. There are no apparent contradictions in the problem setup. While the specific numerical values of failure rate ($F_{0} \\approx 0.4$) and coefficient of variation ($\\mathrm{CV} = 0.5$) are not perfectly consistent under the simple binomial model (as per the equations $F_{0} = (1-p)^{N}$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^{2} = (1-p)/(Np)$), this minor numerical discrepancy does not invalidate the logic of the problem. The core question relies on the *comparison* of these statistical measures before and after the plasticity-inducing protocol, and their remarkable constancy is the key piece of information. The problem is therefore not flawed and can be solved.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n***\n\nThe objective is to deduce the mechanism underlying the observed synaptic unsilencing by analyzing the provided electrophysiological data within the framework of the binomial model of synaptic transmission. The three key parameters of this model are the number of release sites ($N$), the probability of release ($p$), and the postsynaptic quantal size ($q$). We must determine which of these parameters changed.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the provided statistical measures and their dependence on the binomial parameters.\n- The failure rate, $F_{0}$, is the probability of zero quanta being released. For $N$ independent sites each with release probability $p$, this is $F_{0} = (1-p)^{N}$. This measure depends only on presynaptic parameters $N$ and $p$.\n- The coefficient of variation, under the simplifying assumption of negligible quantal variance, is given by $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sigma/m$. Using $m = Npq$ and $\\sigma^{2} = Np(1-p)q^{2}$, we derive $\\mathrm{CV}^{2} = \\frac{Np(1-p)q^{2}}{(Npq)^{2}} = \\frac{1-p}{Np}$. This measure also depends only on presynaptic parameters $N$ and $p$.\n- The paired-pulse ratio, $\\mathrm{PPR}$, is sensitive to short-term changes in release probability. A PPR greater than $1$ (facilitation), such as the observed $\\mathrm{PPR} = 1.9$, is characteristic of a low initial release probability $p$. Changes in $p$ directly cause changes in PPR. Purely postsynaptic changes in $q$ or changes in $N$ do not, by themselves, alter the PPR.\n\nNow, we compare the state of the synapse before and after the LTP pairing protocol.\n\n**Before LTP (Observation 1)**: The synapse is silent, meaning it has NMDARs but lacks functional AMPARs. We measure NMDAR-mediated currents. The key statistics describing presynaptic release are:\n- $F_{0, \\mathrm{pre}} \\approx 0.40$\n- $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{pre,NMDA}} = 0.50$\n- $\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\mathrm{pre,NMDA}} = 1.9$\nThese values establish the baseline presynaptic state.\n\n**After LTP (Observation 2)**: The synapse is unsilenced, and we now measure AMPAR-mediated currents. The statistics are:\n- $F_{0, \\mathrm{post}} \\approx 0.40$\n- $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{post,AMPA}} = 0.50$\n- $\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\mathrm{post,AMPA}} = 1.9$\n\nThe crucial finding is the identity of all statistics related to presynaptic release before and after LTP:\n- $F_{0, \\mathrm{post}} = F_{0, \\mathrm{pre}}$\n- $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{post,AMPA}} = \\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{pre,NMDA}}$\n- $\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\mathrm{post,AMPA}} = \\mathrm{PPR}_{\\mathrm{pre,NMDA}}$\n\nSince $F_{0}$, CV (as formulated here), and PPR are all determined by presynaptic parameters ($N$ and $p$), the fact that they are unchanged provides overwhelming evidence that **$N$ and $p$ have not changed**.\n\n**What has changed?**\nBefore LTP, the synapse was silent to AMPARs. This means the quantal size for AMPAR-mediated currents was zero: $q_{\\mathrm{AMPA,pre}} = 0$. Consequently, the mean AMPAR current was zero: $m_{\\mathrm{pre,AMPA}} = Npq_{\\mathrm{AMPA,pre}} = 0$.\nAfter LTP, a measurable AMPAR current appears: $m_{\\mathrm{post,AMPA}} = 12$ pA. Since we have established that $N$ and $p$ are constant, the appearance of this current must be due to an increase in the AMPAR quantal size from zero to a positive value: $q_{\\mathrm{AMPA,post}} > 0$. This represents the insertion of functional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.\n\n**Observation 3** serves as a control, confirming the stability of the presynaptic machinery and NMDARs. The fact that the NMDAR response statistics (PPR and amplitude distribution) are unchanged after LTP induction confirms that the LTP mechanism did not alter the NMDARs themselves or the presynaptic release properties ($N,p$) that evoke their response. This strengthens the conclusion that the change was specific to AMPARs.\n\nWith this derivation, we can evaluate the options.\n\n**A. Predominantly postsynaptic AMPAR insertion that increases $q$ at the previously silent synapse, with $p$ and $N$ unchanged.**\nThis hypothesis posits a change only in $q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ (from $0$ to a positive value) while $p$ and $N$ remain constant. This is perfectly consistent with our analysis. The constancy of PPR, CV, and failure rate all point to unchanged $p$ and $N$. The appearance of an AMPAR current necessitates an increase in $q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A presynaptic increase in release probability $p$ with no change in $q$ or $N$.**\nAn increase in $p$ would cause a decrease in PPR (less facilitation, more depression), a decrease in the failure rate $F_{0}$, and a change in the CV. All three of these predictions are contradicted by the experimental data, which show these parameters are constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Recruitment of additional release sites (increase in $N$) with no change in $p$ or $q$.**\nAn increase in $N$ would cause a decrease in the failure rate $F_{0} = (1-p)^{N}$ and a decrease in the CV, as $\\mathrm{CV}^{2} \\propto 1/N$. The experimental data show that both $F_{0}$ and CV are constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A mixture of increased $p$ and postsynaptic AMPAR insertion, both contributing substantially to the observed unsilencing.**\nThis option includes an increase in $p$. As analyzed for option B, any substantial change in $p$ is ruled out by the constancy of PPR, CV, and failure rate. Therefore, a mixed mechanism with a significant presynaptic component is inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only inference consistent with the complete dataset is a purely postsynaptic modification involving the insertion of AMPA receptors, which increases the quantal size $q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ without altering the presynaptic release parameters $N$ and $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2751692"}]}
