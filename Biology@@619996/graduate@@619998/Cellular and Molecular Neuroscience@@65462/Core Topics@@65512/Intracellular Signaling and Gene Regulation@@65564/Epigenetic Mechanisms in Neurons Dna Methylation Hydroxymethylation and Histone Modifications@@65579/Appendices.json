The total fraction is conserved, so we have the relation $M(t) + U(t) = 1$.\n\nThe rate of change of the methylated fraction, $\\frac{dM}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between two opposing processes: de novo methylation and active demethylation.\n\n$1$. The de novo methylation process converts unmethylated sites to methylated sites. This reaction is catalyzed by DNMTs and proceeds with a rate constant $m$.

This reaction is catalyzed by TET enzymes and proceeds with a rate constant $d$. The rate of decrease in $M(t)$ due to this process is proportional to the fraction of methylated sites, $M(t)$.
