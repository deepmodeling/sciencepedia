Assume a single ligand-binding site per receptor monomer, rapid equilibrium, and that ligand binding is required prior to productive dimerization and autophosphorylation. The dissociation constant is measured to be $K_D = 1$ nM at physiological temperature.

It describes a classical biochemical equilibrium model for receptor-ligand interaction, which is a fundamental concept in molecular biology and pharmacology. The parameters and assumptions are physically realistic for the TrkB-BDNF system. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem demands a derivation of the fractional occupancy of the receptor, starting from first principles. Let $R$ denote the unbound TrkB receptor, $L$ the free BDNF ligand, and $RL$ the ligand-bound receptor complex. The binding reaction is at equilibrium, as stated:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the law of mass action at steady state:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes concentration. Since the problem refers to the free ligand concentration as $L$, we shall write this as:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R] L}{[RL]} \\quad (1)\n$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved. As there is a single binding site per monomer, the total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentrations of unbound and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL] \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are in the ligand-bound state:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} \\quad (3)\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $\\theta$ as a function of $L$ and $K_D$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from these equations. From equation $(1)$, we can express the concentration of unbound receptors, $[R]$, in terms of $[RL]$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{L}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the conservation equation $(2)$:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{L} + [RL]\n$$\nFactor out $[RL]$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{L} + 1 \\right) = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + L}{L} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we rearrange this equation to match the definition of $\\theta$ from equation $(3)$:\n$$\n\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{L}{K_D + L}\n$$\nThus, the expression for the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta(L) = \\frac{L}{K_D + L}\n$$\nThis is the required expression. Now we evaluate the numerical values of $\\theta$ for the two specified ligand concentrations. The dissociation constant is given as $K_D = 1$ nM.\n\nFor the bulk neuropil, the free ligand concentration is $L_{\\text{bulk}} = 1$ nM. The fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{bulk}} = \\theta(L_{\\text{bulk}}) = \\frac{L_{\\text{bulk}}}{K_D + L_{\\text{bulk}}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ nM}}{1 \\text{ nM} + 1 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFor the synaptic nanodomain, the free ligand concentration is $L_{\\text{nano}} = 10$ nM. The fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{nano}} = \\theta(L_{\\text{nano}}) = \\frac{L_{\\text{nano}}}{K_D + L_{\\text{nano}}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ nM}}{1 \\text{ nM} + 10 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{10}{11}\n$$\nThe problem states that the rate of autophosphorylation is proportional to $\\theta^2$. The fold-change, $F$, in this rate between the nanodomain and the bulk is defined as:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{nano}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{bulk}}}\n$$\nGiven that Rate $\\propto \\theta^2$, we have:\n$$\nF = \\frac{k \\cdot (\\theta_{\\text{nano}})^2}{k \\cdot (\\theta_{\\text{bulk}})^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_{\\text{nano}}}{\\theta_{\\text{bulk}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the proportionality constant which cancels. Substituting the values we calculated for $\\theta_{\\text{nano}}$ and $\\theta_{\\text{bulk}}$:\n$$\nF = \\left( \\frac{10/11}{1/2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{10}{11} \\times \\frac{2}{1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{20}{11} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nF = \\frac{20^2}{11^2} = \\frac{400}{121}\n$$\nThis is the exact value for the fold-change.\n\nFinally, for the mechanistic justification: The derived relationship $\\theta(L) = L/(K_D + L)$ shows that receptor occupancy is a nonlinear, saturating function of ligand concentration. The sensitivity of the system is greatest around the value of $K_D$, which represents the concentration at which half of the receptors are occupied ($\\theta = 0.5$). The signaling output, autophosphorylation, is proportional to $\\theta^2$, which creates an even sharper, switch-like response curve. In the bulk environment, the ligand concentration $L_{\\text{bulk}} = K_D$, placing the system precisely at its most sensitive threshold but yielding only a moderate basal activity level (proportional to $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$). The nanodomain confinement elevates the local ligand concentration to $L_{\\text{nano}} = 10 \\cdot K_D$. This pushes the system far past its activation threshold and toward saturation, where $\\theta$ approaches $1$. The resulting activation is nearly maximal (proportional to $(10/11)^2 \\approx 0.83$). The quadratic dependence amplifies this shift significantly. Therefore, nanodomain confinement serves as a critical biological mechanism to translate a spatially-localized increase in ligand concentration into a robust, all-or-none signaling response. It allows the cell to discriminate between a low, widespread basal signal and a high, targeted signal at a specific synapse, thereby ensuring high spatial fidelity and a clear signaling threshold for TrkB activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{400}{121}}$$", "id": "2745347"}, {"introduction": "Upon activation, RTKs relay signals to intracellular cascades, often through the pivotal small GTPase Ras.
