It is a standard problem in biochemical equilibrium requiring application of fundamental principles. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system under consideration involves the reversible binding of an inhibitor, $I$, to an enzyme, $E$, to form a complex, $EI$, with $1{:}1$ stoichiometry. The reaction is:\n$$ E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI $$\nThe a nalysis must start from the two foundational principles stipulated: the law of mass action and the conservation of mass.\n\n$1$. **Law of Mass Action:** At equilibrium, the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants is defined by the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_i$.\n$$ K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]} $$\nHere, $[E]$, $[I]$, and $[EI]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the free enzyme, free inhibitor, and the enzyme-inhibitor complex, respectively.

In this model, the simplifying assumption that the free inhibitor concentration is approximately equal to the total inhibitor concentration, $[I] \\approx [I]_{\\text{tot}}$, is invalid because a significant fraction of the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme, leading to inhibitor depletion.\n\nTo solve for the unknown concentration of the complex, $[EI]$, we must express the free concentrations $[E]$ and $[I]$ in terms of $[EI]$ and the known total concentrations.
