To dissect the functional importance of this \"phospho-code,\" scientists use site-directed mutagenesis to create receptors that either cannot be phosphorylated (e.g., by substituting serine with alanine) or that constitutively mimic the phosphorylated state (e.g., using aspartate). This powerful thought experiment [@problem_id:2746773] challenges you to predict how these fundamental molecular changes will reshape the receptor's entire desensitization and internalization profile, separating basal from agonist-induced regulation.", "problem": "A laboratory is dissecting the mechanisms of receptor desensitization in a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In wild-type receptors, agonist binding stabilizes an active conformation that is recognized by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic domains, and the added negative charge drives high-affinity recruitment of beta-arrestins. Beta-arrestins uncouple the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins (acute desensitization) and scaffold clathrin-mediated endocytosis (internalization), which can lead to longer-term receptor downregulation. To decouple basal from agonist-induced processes, the lab generates two mutants in which all GRK-targeted serine and threonine residues in the receptor tail are replaced either with alanine or with aspartate. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated and does not carry a negative charge; aspartate cannot be phosphorylated at those positions but does carry a constitutive negative charge that can mimic a phosphate electrostatically.\n\nAssume the following well-tested facts: GRKs preferentially act on the active receptor conformation stabilized by agonist; receptor phosphorylation promotes beta-arrestin engagement; beta-arrestin recruitment reduces G protein signaling and promotes internalization; alanine substitution of phosphoacceptor sites prevents phosphorylation; aspartate substitution can partially mimic the negative charge of phosphorylation and thereby promote arrestin engagement even without phosphorylation.

This active conformation is recognized by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the receptor's cytoplasmic domains. The resulting negative charge from phosphate groups drives high-affinity recruitment of $\\beta$-arrestins. $\\beta$-arrestins perform two functions: (a) uncouple the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins (acute desensitization) and (b) scaffold clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to internalization and potential downregulation.\n2.  **Mutants**: Two mutants are generated where all GRK-targeted serine and threonine residues are replaced.\n    *   **Alanine Mutant**: All sites are replaced with alanine.\n    *   **Aspartate Mutant**: All sites are replaced with aspartate.\n3.  **Properties of Amino Acid Substitutions**:\n    *   **Alanine**: Cannot be phosphorylated and does not carry a charge. It is a phosphonull substitution.\n    *   **Aspartate**: Cannot be phosphorylated at these sites but carries a constitutive negative charge, acting as a phosphomimetic substitution.\n4.  **Governing Assumptions**:\n    *   GRKs preferentially act on the active, agonist-bound receptor conformation.\n    *   Receptor phosphorylation is the trigger that promotes $\\beta$-arrestin engagement.\n    *   $\\beta$-arrestin recruitment causes G protein uncoupling (desensitization) and promotes receptor internalization.\n    *   Alanine substitution prevents phosphorylation.\n    *   Aspartate substitution's negative charge promotes $\\beta$-arrestin engagement without phosphorylation.\n    *   No other signaling pathways are altered.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the established principles of cellular and molecular neuroscience, specifically G protein-coupled receptor signaling. The described desensitization pathway involving GRKs and $\\beta$-arrestins is a canonical mechanism. The experimental strategy of using phosphonull (alanine) and phosphomimetic (aspartate) mutations is a standard, valid technique used to investigate the functional role of phosphorylation events in signal transduction. All premises are factually sound and scientifically accepted.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides a set of initial conditions (wild-type mechanism, mutant properties) and asks for a logical prediction of the system's behavior. The question is unambiguous and a unique solution can be derived from the provided information.\n*   **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or biased statements. It describes a hypothetical but realistic experimental scenario.\n*   The problem does not suffer from any of the specified flaws. It is not based on false premises, it is directly relevant to the topic, it provides a complete set of rules, the conditions are plausible, and it requires substantive reasoning based on the provided principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\nDerivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a systematic analysis of how each mutation alters the canonical desensitization pathway compared to the wild-type receptor. We must consider both the basal (agonist-absent) and agonist-induced states.\n\n**Analysis of the Alanine Mutant**\nThe alanine mutant replaces all target serine and threonine residues with alanine. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated by GRKs and its side chain is uncharged.\n1.  **Effect on Phosphorylation**: The primary molecular event required for $\\beta$-arrestin recruitment—phosphorylation of the receptor tail by GRKs—is completely abolished in this mutant.\n2.  **Basal State**: In the wild-type system, there is a low level of basal receptor activity and corresponding GRK-mediated phosphorylation, which leads to a basal level of desensitization and internalization. Since the alanine mutant receptor cannot be phosphorylated, this basal phosphorylation-dependent desensitization is eliminated. Consequently, the alanine mutant will exhibit **reduced basal desensitization** compared to the wild-type receptor. Without the braking mechanism, the receptor should remain more coupled to G proteins in the basal state.\n3.  **Agonist-Induced State**: Upon agonist stimulation, the wild-type receptor is robustly phosphorylated by GRKs, leading to strong recruitment of $\\beta$-arrestin, rapid G protein uncoupling (desensitization), and subsequent internalization. In the alanine mutant, agonist binding still activates the receptor, but the critical downstream step of phosphorylation cannot occur. Without the addition of negative charges, $\\beta$-arrestin cannot be recruited with high affinity. As a result, agonist-induced desensitization will be **markedly blunted and slower**. Because $\\beta$-arrestin also mediates endocytosis, **internalization will be severely impaired**.\n\n**Analysis of the Aspartate Mutant**\nThe aspartate mutant replaces all target serine and threonine residues with aspartate. Aspartate carries a constitutive negative charge that mimics the electrostatic properties of a phosphate group.\n1.  **Effect on Phosphorylation**: The receptor is constitutively \"phosphorylated\" in an electrostatic sense, but can no longer be dynamically regulated by GRKs at these sites.\n2.  **Basal State**: The constitutive negative charges on the receptor's cytoplasmic domains will promote the binding of $\\beta$-arrestin even in the absence of agonist stimulation. This pre-recruitment of $\\beta$-arrestin will lead to G protein uncoupling and receptor internalization without the need for an agonist. Therefore, the aspartate mutant will exhibit **elevated basal desensitization** and **constitutive internalization**, far exceeding the levels seen in the wild-type receptor.\n3.  **Agonist-Induced State**: The receptor is already in a highly desensitized and internalized state due to constitutive $\\beta$-arrestin binding. When an agonist is added, the receptor conformation will change to the active state. While GRKs preferentially recognize this active state, the substrate sites for phosphorylation are absent. The primary signal for enhanced $\\beta$-arrestin recruitment (the accumulation of negative charge) is already present and fixed. Therefore, the addition of an agonist will produce **little additional agonist-induced desensitization or internalization** beyond the already high basal state. The system is essentially locked in a desensitized state.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Alanine mutant: reduced basal desensitization, markedly blunted and slower agonist-induced desensitization, and impaired internalization; Aspartate mutant: elevated basal desensitization with constitutive internalization and little additional agonist-induced desensitization beyond the basal state.**\n    This option precisely matches the derived conclusions for both the alanine mutant (abolished phosphorylation leads to reduced desensitization) and the aspartate mutant (constitutive negative charge leads to high basal desensitization with little further inducibility).\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Alanine mutant: increased basal desensitization due to enhanced GRK access and faster agonist-induced desensitization; Aspartate mutant: decreased basal and agonist-induced desensitization because the sites can no longer be phosphorylated.**\n    This option is incorrect. For the alanine mutant, desensitization is reduced, not increased, because the mechanism for desensitization (phosphorylation) is removed. For the aspartate mutant, desensitization is increased, not decreased, because it constitutively mimics the phosphorylated state.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Alanine mutant: unchanged basal desensitization with enhanced agonist-induced desensitization because alanine increases GRK binding dynamics; Aspartate mutant: no change in either basal or agonist-induced desensitization relative to wild-type.**\n    This option is incorrect. For the alanine mutant, basal desensitization is reduced and agonist-induced desensitization is blunted, not enhanced. The claim about alanine's effect on GRK binding is unsubstantiated and contrary to the given principles. For the aspartate mutant, the constitutive charge profoundly alters desensitization profiles; they are not unchanged.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Alanine mutant: reduced basal desensitization but largely normal agonist-induced desensitization due to compensation by protein kinase A (PKA); Aspartate mutant: normal basal desensitization but enhanced agonist-induced desensitization owing to improved GRK recognition of negatively charged sites.**\n    This option is incorrect. For the alanine mutant, invoking compensation by PKA violates the problem's constraint that \"No other pathways are altered.\" Furthermore, the loss of the primary GRK-mediated pathway would not result in \"largely normal\" desensitization. For the aspartate mutant, basal desensitization would be elevated, not normal, and the agonist-induced effect would be minimal, not enhanced.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2746773"}, {"introduction": "Once a GPCR is phosphorylated, the adaptor protein $\\beta$-arrestin is recruited, but its job is twofold.

The roles of GRKs, $\\beta$-arrestin, clathrin, and AP2 are described accurately. The use of a dominant-negative mutant (which Arr2-$\\Delta$CL represents for endocytosis) is a standard and valid technique in molecular and cellular biology. The premise is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. The initial conditions, the specific molecular intervention, and the key assumptions (mass-action, clathrin-dependence) are explicitly stated, providing a self-contained framework from which a logical conclusion can be derived. The question asks for a qualitative prediction, which is appropriate for this level of description.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free from subjective or ambiguous terminology. Terms like `desensitization`, `endocytosis`, and `downregulation` have specific, objective meanings within this scientific context.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, and well-posed. It presents a non-trivial conceptual challenge based on established principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe analysis proceeds from first principles based on the provided information. The key is to dissect the multifaceted role of $\\beta$-arrestin and determine how the mutant, Arr2-$\\Delta$CL, affects each function.\n\n1.  **Agonist Stimulation and GRK Phosphorylation**: Upon agonist stimulation, the $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor activates its cognate $G$-protein (which, for this receptor, is $G_s$ leading to cAMP production) and becomes a substrate for GRK-mediated phosphorylation. This creates the binding site for $\\beta$-arrestins. This initial step is unaffected by the type of arrestin present.\n\n2.  **Arrestin Competition and Binding**: The system contains endogenous wild-type $\\beta$-arrestins and a 10-fold excess of the Arr2-$\\Delta$CL mutant. Due to mass-action principles, the overexpressed mutant will overwhelmingly outcompete the endogenous arrestin for binding to the phosphorylated receptors. The mutant's receptor-binding interface is intact, so it binds with normal affinity.\n\n3.  **Desensitization (Steric Uncoupling)**: According to fact (ii), desensitization results from $\\beta$-arrestin binding and sterically blocking the $G$-protein coupling interface. Since the Arr2-$\\Delta$CL mutant binds the receptor correctly, it is fully competent to perform this steric uncoupling function. Therefore, rapid desensitization will occur. The question asks for a comparison to overexpression of wild-type $\\beta$-arrestin-2. In both cases, a large excess of an arrestin protein is present, so the rate and extent of acute desensitization (the uncoupling step) should be comparable, and certainly not reduced.\n\n4.  **Internalization (Endocytosis)**: According to fact (iii), internalization requires $\\beta$-arrestin to act as an adaptor, linking the receptor to clathrin and AP2. The Arr2-$\\Delta$CL mutant is explicitly defined as lacking the ability to bind clathrin and AP2. By binding to the majority of receptors, the mutant effectively prevents them from engaging with the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. Because internalization is stated to be predominantly clathrin-dependent, this will lead to a marked reduction or inhibition of receptor internalization. The mutant acts as a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of endocytosis.\n\n5.  **Downregulation**: The problem states that endocytosis is a prerequisite for lysosomal targeting and downregulation. By blocking internalization, the Arr2-$\\Delta$CL mutant prevents the trafficking of receptors to the lysosomal pathway. Consequently, long-term downregulation of receptors (measured at 6 hours) will be significantly diminished.\n\n6.  **Receptor Fate and Resensitization**: With internalization blocked, receptor-arrestin complexes (specifically, Phospho-$\\beta_2$R-Arr2-$\\Delta$CL complexes) will accumulate and become trapped at the plasma membrane. Fact (iii) also states that efficient dephosphorylation and resensitization occur in endosomes. By preventing receptors from reaching these compartments, the process of resensitization will be severely impaired or delayed. Phosphatases at the plasma membrane are typically less effective at dephosphorylating arrestin-bound receptors. This implies that upon a subsequent agonist pulse, the response will be blunted due to the failure of the receptors to return to a signaling-competent state.\n\nWith these derived consequences, let us evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Faster onset and greater extent of acute desensitization (smaller cAMP peak) with markedly reduced receptor internalization; diminished receptor downregulation at 6 hours; accumulation of arrestin–receptor complexes at the plasma membrane that delays resensitization between agonist pulses.**\n- `Faster onset and greater extent of acute desensitization`: While the desensitization should be at least as robust as with wild-type overexpression, arguing it is \"faster and greater\" is a subtle point. It is plausible that by forming a \"dead-end\" complex at the membrane, the uncoupled state is stabilized, leading to more profound desensitization. The core idea that desensitization is effective is correct.\n- `markedly reduced receptor internalization`: Correct. This is the direct result of the mutant's design.\n- `diminished receptor downregulation at 6 hours`: Correct. This is a direct consequence of blocked internalization.\n- `accumulation of arrestin–receptor complexes at the plasma membrane`: Correct. This is the mechanistic basis for the observed effects on internalization and resensitization.\n- `delays resensitization between agonist pulses`: Correct. This is due to the failure to traffic to endosomes for efficient dephosphorylation.\nThis option provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of the expected phenotype. The other options contain fundamental errors.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Slower desensitization because clathrin/AP2 engagement is required for steric uncoupling; internalization remains unchanged via compensatory clathrin-independent endocytosis; downregulation is unchanged.**\n- `Slower desensitization because clathrin/AP2 engagement is required for steric uncoupling`: This premise is factually incorrect, contradicting fact (ii). Arrestin binding alone is sufficient for steric uncoupling.\n- `internalization remains unchanged`: This contradicts the known function of the mutant and the assumption that internalization is predominantly clathrin-dependent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Desensitization remains intact, internalization is reduced, but because receptors remain at the surface they resensitize more rapidly, producing a larger second cAMP response upon a subsequent pulse.**\n- `Desensitization remains intact, internalization is reduced`: These parts are correct.\n- `but because receptors remain at the surface they resensitize more rapidly`: This is incorrect. The provided information and the canonical model state that resensitization is efficient in endosomes. Trapping the receptor at the surface in an arrestin-bound state *prevents* efficient resensitization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Enhanced internalization due to trapping more receptor–arrestin complexes, but reduced desensitization because the mutant cannot sterically block G protein coupling.**\n- `Enhanced internalization`: This is the opposite of what the mutant is designed to do. It blocks internalization.\n- `reduced desensitization because the mutant cannot sterically block G protein coupling`: This is incorrect. The mutant's receptor-binding domain is intact, so it can perform steric uncoupling.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. No substantial change in desensitization, internalization, or downregulation because endogenous arrestins are sufficient and outcompete the mutant.**\n- This contradicts the stated condition of 10-fold overexpression and the assumption of mass-action competition. At such a high ratio, the mutant will dominate the cellular response.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly predicts the cascade of consequences resulting from the expression of the dominant-negative arrestin mutant. It correctly identifies the block in internalization and the subsequent impairment of downregulation and resensitization, while acknowledging that the initial desensitization step remains effective.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2746777"}, {"introduction": "The conceptual and experimental approaches in the previous exercises provide critical insights, but to capture the full temporal dynamics of signaling, we must turn to mathematical modeling.

For example, `[f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4,f_5]` must be printed as a single line exactly in the form `[f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4,f_5]` with no spaces.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It presents a standard exercise in computational systems biology, specifically the formalization and numerical solution of a kinetic model of receptor regulation. The problem is valid.\n\nThe task is to derive the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for a $5$-state model of receptor dynamics and then to numerically solve this system for several parameter sets. The states are: resting receptor ($R$), active receptor ($R^\\*$), phosphorylated receptor ($R_p$), arrestin-bound receptor ($RA$), and internalized receptor ($I$).\n\nThe kinetic scheme is described by the following transitions:\n$R \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\mathrm{off}}]{k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0} R^\\* \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}} R_p \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\mathrm{unarr}}]{k_{\\mathrm{arr}}} RA \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{int}}} I$\nAdditionally, there are feedback and degradation pathways:\n$R_p \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{dephos}}} R$\n$I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R$\n$I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} \\varnothing$ (degradation)\n\nThe agonist concentration $A$ is assumed to be constant at a value $A_0$, making the activation step $R \\rightarrow R^\\*$ a pseudo-first-order reaction with rate constant $k_{\\text{eff}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0$.\n\nFrom the law of mass action, the rate of change for the concentration of each species is the sum of the rates of all reactions producing it (influx) minus the sum of the rates of all reactions consuming it (outflux). This yields the following system of $5$ coupled linear first-order ODEs.\n\n$1$. Rate of change for resting receptor, $R(t)$:\n$R$ is produced by deactivation of $R^\\*$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} R^\\*$), dephosphorylation of $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} R_p$), and recycling of $I$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I$). It is consumed by activation to $R^\\*$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R$). By problem statement, synthesis is absent ($k_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 0$).\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} R^\\* + k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} R_p + k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I - k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R\n$$\n\n$2$. Rate of change for active receptor, $R^\\*(t)$:\n$R^\\*$ is produced by activation of $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R$). It is consumed by deactivation to $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} R^\\*$) and phosphorylation to $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{phos}} R^\\*$).\n$$\n\\frac{dR^\\*}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}) R^\\*\n$$\n\n$3$. Rate of change for phosphorylated receptor, $R_p(t)$:\n$R_p$ is produced by phosphorylation of $R^\\*$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{phos}} R^\\*$) and unbinding of arrestin from $RA$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} RA$). It is consumed by dephosphorylation to $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} R_p$) and arrestin binding to form $RA$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{arr}} R_p$).\n$$\n\\frac{dR_p}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{phos}} R^\\* + k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} RA - (k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} + k_{\\mathrm{arr}}) R_p\n$$\n\n$4$. Rate of change for arrestin-bound receptor, $RA(t)$:\n$RA$ is produced by arrestin binding to $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{arr}} R_p$). It is consumed by arrestin unbinding to form $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} RA$) and internalization into the endosomal compartment (rate $k_{\\mathrm{int}} RA$).\n$$\n\\frac{dRA}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{arr}} R_p - (k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) RA\n$$\n\n$5$. Rate of change for internalized receptor, $I(t)$:\n$I$ is produced by internalization of $RA$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{int}} RA$). It is consumed by recycling to $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I$) and degradation (rate $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I$).\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{int}} RA - (k_{\\mathrm{rec}} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}) I\n$$\n\nThis system of ODEs, along with the initial conditions $R(0) = R_0$ and $R^\\*(0) = R_p(0) = RA(0) = I(0) = 0$, defines an initial value problem (IVP). We can confirm the internal consistency of the model by examining the rate of change of the total receptor population, $R_{total}(t) = R(t) + R^\\*(t) + R_p(t) + RA(t) + I(t)$. Summing all $5$ ODEs, we observe that all internal flux terms cancel out, leaving only the degradation term:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{total}}{dt} = \\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{dR^\\*}{dt} + \\frac{dR_p}{dt} + \\frac{dRA}{dt} + \\frac{dI}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I\n$$\nThis confirms that the total number of receptors is conserved except for the loss due to degradation from the internalized pool, as expected.\n\nTo solve this IVP numerically for the given parameter sets, we will use a standard numerical integration method. A robust choice is the `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library in Python, which implements several adaptive-stepsize algorithms suitable for such systems. We will define a function that computes the vector of derivatives for a given state vector $y = [R, R^\\*, R_p, RA, I]$ and integrate from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{end}}$ for each test case. The final metric $f = I(T_{\\mathrm{end}}) / R_0$ is then computed from the integration result.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives, solves, and analyzes a kinetic model of receptor regulation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains:\n    # A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg, T_end\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (happy path)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.3, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n        # Case 2 (boundary, no agonist)\n        (0.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.3, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n        # Case 3 (fast desensitization/internalization, slow recycling, high degradation)\n        (10.0, 1.0, 0.1, 1.0, 0.05, 1.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.005, 0.02, 300.0),\n        # Case 4 (no arrestin binding, internalization disabled)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n        # Case 5 (high dephosphorylation counteracts desensitization)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 2.0, 0.3, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n    ]\n\n    R0 = 1.0  # Initial total receptor concentration in uM\n\n    def model(t, y, params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ordinary differential equations for receptor dynamics.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (float): Time.\n            y (list): State vector [R, R*, R_p, RA, I].\n            params (tuple): Kinetic parameters.\n            \n        Returns:\n            list: The derivatives [dR/dt, dR*/dt, dR_p/dt, dRA/dt, dI/dt].\n        \"\"\"\n        R, R_star, R_p, RA, I = y\n        A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg = params\n\n        # Effective first-order activation rate\n        k_eff_on = kon * A0\n\n        # Rate equations\n        dR_dt = koff * R_star + kdephos * R_p + krec * I - k_eff_on * R\n        dR_star_dt = k_eff_on * R - (koff + kphos) * R_star\n        dR_p_dt = kphos * R_star + kunarr * RA - (kdephos + karr) * R_p\n        dRA_dt = karr * R_p - (kunarr + kint) * RA\n        dI_dt = kint * RA - (krec + kdeg) * I\n        \n        return [dR_dt, dR_star_dt, dR_p_dt, dRA_dt, dI_dt]\n\n    results = []\n    for i, case_params in enumerate(test_cases):\n        # Unpack parameters for the current case\n        A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg, T_end = case_params\n        params_tuple = (A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg)\n\n        # Initial conditions: R(0) = R0, all other states are 0\n        y0 = [R0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n        \n        # Time span for integration\n        t_span = (0, T_end)\n        \n        # We only need the solution at the final time T_end for efficiency\n        t_eval = [T_end]\n\n        # Numerically integrate the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=model,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=y0,\n            args=(params_tuple,),\n            t_eval=t_eval,\n            method='RK45',  # Standard Runge-Kutta method\n            dense_output=False\n        )\n        \n        # Extract the final concentration of the internalized receptor\n        I_final = sol.y[4, -1]\n        \n        # Calculate the metric f = I(T_end) / R0\n        f_metric = I_final / R0\n        \n        # Format to 6 decimal places and store the result\n        results.append(f\"{f_metric:.6f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2746776"}]}
