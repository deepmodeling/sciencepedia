They treat the neurons with a specific neurotrophic factor known to trigger protein synthesis-dependent strengthening of synapses. After treatment, they prepare a cell lysate and perform a Western blot analysis. The results show a significantly strong band corresponding to phosphorylated S6 Ribosomal Protein Kinase (p-S6K) at the threonine 389 residue. Based on this specific molecular finding, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the upstream signaling pathway within these neurons?\n\nA. The protein kinase Akt, an upstream regulator, is most likely in its unphosphorylated and inactive state.\n\nB. The lipid phosphatase known as Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) is likely hyperactive, leading to the inhibition of the pathway.\n\nC. The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is likely in a highly active state.\n\nD. The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (mTORC2) is the primary kinase directly responsible for the observed phosphorylation of S6K.\n\nE. The small GTPase Rheb, a critical activator of the pathway, is predominantly in its inactive, GDP-bound form.", "solution": "The key molecular observation is a strong band for phosphorylated S6 Ribosomal Protein Kinase at threonine 389, i.e., p-S6K(T389). By kinase–substrate specificity in the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway, T389 on S6K is a direct phosphorylation site of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). This relationship can be summarized as:\n$$\\text{mTORC1} \\xrightarrow{\\text{kinase activity}} \\text{S6K phosphorylated at } T389.$$\nTherefore, an increased p-S6K(T389) signal implies that the kinase responsible, mTORC1, is active.\n\nEvaluate each option against this mechanistic implication:\n\nA. If Akt were unphosphorylated and inactive, it would fail to inhibit TSC2, leaving TSC1/2 active to stimulate the GTPase activity of Rheb, keeping Rheb in the GDP-bound inactive state. This would reduce mTORC1 activity and thus reduce p-S6K(T389). Formally:\n$$\\downarrow \\text{Akt} \\Rightarrow \\uparrow \\text{TSC1/2} \\Rightarrow \\text{Rheb-GDP} \\Rightarrow \\downarrow \\text{mTORC1} \\Rightarrow \\downarrow \\text{p-S6K(T389)},$$\nwhich contradicts the observed strong band. Hence A is unlikely.\n\nB. PTEN dephosphorylates $\\text{PIP}_3$ to $\\text{PIP}_2$, antagonizing PI3K and reducing Akt activation, thereby decreasing mTORC1 activity:\n$$\\text{PTEN}: \\text{PIP}_3 \\to \\text{PIP}_2 \\Rightarrow \\downarrow \\text{Akt} \\Rightarrow \\downarrow \\text{mTORC1} \\Rightarrow \\downarrow \\text{p-S6K(T389)}.$$\nA strong p-S6K(T389) band argues against hyperactive PTEN. Hence B is unlikely.\n\nC. Given that mTORC1 directly phosphorylates S6K on T389, a strong p-S6K(T389) signal is best explained by high mTORC1 activity. This is the most direct and accurate inference. Hence C is correct.\n\nD. mTORC2 is not the primary kinase for S6K at T389; rather, mTORC2 characteristically phosphorylates Akt at S473. Therefore, attributing the observed S6K T389 phosphorylation to mTORC2 is incorrect. Hence D is false.\n\nE. Rheb in its GDP-bound state is inactive and fails to activate mTORC1. High p-S6K(T389) implies active mTORC1, which in turn implies Rheb is predominantly GTP-bound, not GDP-bound:\n$$\\text{Rheb-GTP} \\Rightarrow \\uparrow \\text{mTORC1} \\Rightarrow \\uparrow \\text{p-S6K(T389)}.$$\nThus E is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the specific molecular finding most accurately indicates that mTORC1 is highly active.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348551"}, {"introduction": "Cellular signaling pathways are not simple linear chains; they are dynamically regulated by intricate feedback loops that can produce surprising, non-intuitive behaviors. This problem moves beyond linear logic to explore a well-established negative feedback loop within the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, where the downstream kinase S6K dampens the initial signal. You will analyze how pharmacological inhibition can disrupt this feedback, leading to paradoxical effects that are critical to understand for proper experimental design and data interpretation [@problem_id:2587240].", "problem": "A growth factor stimulates a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) to activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), producing phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP$_3$). PIP$_3$ recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Protein Kinase B (Akt) to the plasma membrane, where PDK1 phosphorylates Akt at Thr308, and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates Akt at Ser473. Activated Akt promotes mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-BP1. Activated S6K phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) on inhibitory sites, reducing IRS1 stability and function and thereby creating negative feedback that attenuates RTK/PI3K signaling. Consider an epithelial cell line in which mTORC2 is not acutely sensitive to rapamycin. Cells are acutely treated (within $\\leq$ 2 h) under continuous growth factor stimulation with one of the following: vehicle, rapamycin (an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor), Torin1 (an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor that inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2), a class I PI3K inhibitor, or combinations thereof.\n\nUsing only the mechanistic base above, choose the option that best explains why rapamycin can increase Akt phosphorylation via feedback relief and correctly predicts the qualitative pattern of pathway readouts under acute treatment for rapamycin versus Torin1, alone and combined with a PI3K inhibitor. Focus on the following readouts: phosphorylation of S6 (as a proxy for S6K activity), Akt Thr308, and Akt Ser473.\n\nA. Rapamycin acutely reduces phospho-S6 by inhibiting mTORC1, which relieves S6K-to-IRS1 negative feedback, elevates RTK/PI3K activity and PIP$_3$, and thus increases Akt Thr308 (PDK1 site) and leaves Akt Ser473 unchanged or slightly increased because mTORC2 remains active. Torin1 acutely reduces phospho-S6 and suppresses Akt Ser473 by inhibiting mTORC2, thereby preventing a rapamycin-like rebound in Akt despite feedback relief; net Akt Thr308 does not increase. When combined with a PI3K inhibitor, rapamycin cannot elevate PIP$_3$, so both Akt sites remain low; Torin1 plus PI3K inhibitor yields the lowest Akt phosphorylation at both sites.\n\nB. Rapamycin directly inhibits mTORC2 and therefore acutely decreases Akt Ser473, while Torin1 spares mTORC2 and thus increases Akt Ser473. Combining Torin1 with a PI3K inhibitor preserves Akt Ser473 because Ser473 phosphorylation is PI3K-independent.\n\nC. Rapamycin acutely increases Akt phosphorylation by directly activating PI3K, whereas Torin1 does not affect feedback. Adding a PI3K inhibitor to rapamycin still increases Akt Thr308 and Ser473 because mTORC1 inhibition is upstream of PI3K.\n\nD. Both rapamycin and Torin1 acutely increase Akt Ser473 because mTORC1 restrains mTORC2; inhibition of PI3K does not change Akt Ser473 since mTORC2 docks Akt independently of PIP$_3$. In contrast, Akt Thr308 always decreases with either mTOR inhibitor because PDK1 requires mTORC1 to be active.", "solution": "The reasoning starts from the canonical wiring of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–Akt–mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K–Akt–mTOR) pathway and its feedbacks:\n\n- RTK activation stimulates PI3K to generate PIP$_3$, which recruits PDK1 and Akt to the plasma membrane. PDK1 phosphorylates Akt at Thr308, and mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser473. Both events are promoted by membrane localization driven by PIP$_3$, so both sites are functionally PI3K-dependent.\n- Akt activation promotes mTORC1. mTORC1 activates S6K, which phosphorylates IRS1 on inhibitory sites, causing IRS1 degradation or functional attenuation. This is a well-established negative feedback loop that dampens upstream RTK/PI3K signaling.\n- Rapamycin is an allosteric inhibitor that acutely inhibits mTORC1 but typically spares mTORC2 in many cell types over short (acute) time frames. Torin1 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor that acutely inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2.\n\nFrom these principles, derive the acute responses:\n\n1. Rapamycin alone (acute). Inhibiting mTORC1 decreases S6K activity, lowering phospho-S6. Reduced S6K-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation stabilizes or activates IRS1, relieving negative feedback and increasing RTK/PI3K signaling. Elevated PI3K activity increases PIP$_3$, which enhances membrane recruitment of PDK1 and Akt, thereby increasing Akt Thr308 phosphorylation. Because mTORC2 is intact acutely, increased PIP$_3$-mediated membrane recruitment can also increase the chance of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation; net Ser473 is therefore unchanged or modestly increased, depending on the balance between enhanced recruitment and unchanged catalytic capacity of mTORC2.\n\n2. Torin1 alone (acute). Torin1 inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, decreasing phospho-S6 and directly lowering Akt Ser473 by blocking mTORC2. Although S6K feedback is relieved (as with rapamycin), any increase in PIP$_3$-driven membrane recruitment cannot restore Ser473 because mTORC2 is catalytically inhibited. Akt Thr308 might be driven upward by increased PIP$_3$ and PDK1 access, but the loss of Ser473 reduces Akt stability and phosphorylation efficiency; in acute settings, the net effect is that Thr308 does not show the rapamycin-like rebound and is not increased compared to vehicle.\n\n3. Addition of a class I PI3K inhibitor. A PI3K inhibitor suppresses PIP$_3$, which is required for membrane co-localization of PDK1, Akt, and mTORC2. Therefore, both Thr308 and Ser473 become low regardless of feedback relief. Rapamycin cannot elevate Akt phosphorylation when PI3K is inhibited because the critical lipid scaffold PIP$_3$ is absent. Torin1 plus PI3K inhibitor further ensures low Ser473 by directly inhibiting mTORC2, yielding the lowest Akt phosphorylation at both sites.\n\nNow evaluate options:\n\nA. This option states: rapamycin lowers phospho-S6 and relieves S6K-to-IRS1 feedback, increasing PI3K output and raising Akt Thr308, with Akt Ser473 unchanged or slightly increased because mTORC2 remains active acutely. Torin1 lowers phospho-S6 and suppresses Ser473 by inhibiting mTORC2, preventing a rebound in Akt; net Thr308 does not increase. With PI3K inhibition, rapamycin cannot produce PIP$_3$ and thus cannot increase either Akt site; Torin1 plus PI3K inhibitor yields very low phosphorylation at both sites. This aligns with the mechanistic derivation above. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option reverses drug specificities, claiming that rapamycin directly inhibits mTORC2 and Torin1 spares it, and asserts that Akt Ser473 is PI3K-independent. Both claims are contrary to well-tested facts: rapamycin acutely spares mTORC2 in many cells, Torin1 inhibits it, and Ser473 phosphorylation depends on PI3K-generated PIP$_3$ for Akt recruitment. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option claims rapamycin directly activates PI3K and that mTORC1 is upstream of PI3K, so a PI3K inhibitor would not block rapamycin’s increase in Akt phosphorylation. Rapamycin does not activate PI3K directly; it relieves negative feedback by inhibiting mTORC1/S6K. Moreover, PI3K is upstream of both Akt sites; inhibiting PI3K prevents their phosphorylation despite any feedback relief. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option asserts that inhibiting mTORC1 increases Akt Ser473 by releasing mTORC2 from restraint and that PI3K does not influence Ser473. It also claims PDK1 requires mTORC1. In reality, Ser473 depends on PI3K-driven membrane recruitment and mTORC2 catalytic activity, not on mTORC1 “restraint,” and PDK1 does not require mTORC1 to phosphorylate Akt Thr308; it requires PIP$_3$.
