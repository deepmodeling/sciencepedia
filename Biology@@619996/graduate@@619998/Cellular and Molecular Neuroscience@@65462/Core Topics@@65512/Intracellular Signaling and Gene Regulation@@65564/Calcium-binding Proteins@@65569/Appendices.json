The rate of change of the total calcium concentration, $c(t) + x(t)$, is equal to the rate of influx, $I(t)$, minus the rate of efflux via the pump, $J_{\\mathrm{pump}} = k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c$.\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\big(c(t) + x(t)\\big) = I(t) - k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c(t) $$\n    Applying the sum rule for differentiation, we get:\n    $$ \\frac{dc}{dt} + \\frac{dx}{dt} = I(t) - k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c $$\n    This equation can be rearranged to express the rate of change of free calcium, $\\frac{dc}{dt}$:\n    $$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = I(t) - k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c - \\frac{dx}{dt} \\quad (*)$$\n\n2.  **Law of Mass Action for Buffer Kinetics:** The reversible reaction is $B + \\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{CaB}$. Using the notation provided, this is $b + c \\rightleftharpoons x$.\n    - The rate of the forward reaction (binding) is proportional to the product of the reactant concentrations: $k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b$. This process consumes free calcium and free buffer to produce bound buffer.\n    - The rate of the reverse reaction (unbinding) is proportional to the product concentration: $k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x$. This process consumes bound buffer to produce free calcium and free buffer.\n\n    The net rate of change of the bound buffer concentration, $x(t)$, is the rate of its formation minus the rate of its dissociation:\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x \\quad (**)$$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Buffer:** The total buffer concentration, $b_T$, is constant. The buffer exists in either a free state, $b(t)$, or a bound state, $x(t)$.\n    $$ b_T = b(t) + x(t) $$\n    This provides an algebraic constraint relating the variables:\n    $$ b(t) = b_T - x(t) \\quad (***)$$\n\n**Assembling the System of Equations**\n\nTo obtain the final expression for $\\frac{dc}{dt}$, we substitute the expression for $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ from equation $(**)$ into equation $(*)$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = I(t) - k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c - \\big( k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x \\big) $$\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = I(t) - k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c - k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b + k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x $$\n\nThe minimal, well-posed ODE model is therefore comprised of the differential equations for the state variables (e.g., $c$ and $x$) and the algebraic conservation law.

This implies that unbinding *removes* free calcium, which is false. It should be $+k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x$.\n    - In the $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ equation, the term for unbinding is $+k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x$. This implies that unbinding *creates* bound complex, which is false. It should be $-k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x$.\n- **Dimensional Consistency:** The unit for $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is given as $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The term $k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b$ would have units of $(\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(\\mu\\mathrm{M})(\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\mu\\mathrm{M}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

This option introduces a non-specified parameter $c_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n    - The binding term $-k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b_T$ uses the total buffer concentration $b_T$ instead of the free buffer concentration $b$. The law of mass action requires the concentrations of the actual reactants.\n    - The unbinding term $+k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,b$ depends on the free buffer concentration $b$ instead of the bound complex concentration $x$. Dissociation rate depends on the concentration of the species that is dissociating.\n- **Dimensional Consistency:** The unit for $k_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ is given as $\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The pump term $k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,(c - c_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ would have units of $(\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\mu\\mathrm{M}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is inconsistent with a concentration flux.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nEquations:\n$ \\displaystyle \\frac{dc}{dt} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{chan}}(t)}{F} - k_{\\mathrm{pump}}\\,c - k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b + k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,\\big(b_T - b\\big), \\quad \\frac{db}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c\\,b + k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,\\big(b_T - b\\big).$\n- **Equation Correctness:**\n    - The influx term $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{chan}}(t)}{F}$ contradicts the problem statement. The problem defines an already-normalized influx $I(t)$ with units of concentration/time. This option introduces an un-normalized channel current $I_{\\mathrm{chan}}(t)$ and Faraday's constant $F$. Furthermore, the conversion from current to concentration flux is incorrect; it is missing the ion valence ($z=2$ for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) and the compartment volume $V$. The correct term would be $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{chan}}(t)}{zFV}$.\n    - The buffer terms are written differently but are mathematically correct. Since $x = b_T - b$, the term $k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,(b_T - b)$ is equivalent to $k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,x$. Thus, the equation for $\\frac{db}{dt}$ is correct, and the buffer part of the $\\frac{dc}{dt}$ equation is also correct. However, the incorrect influx term invalidates the whole option.\n- **Dimensional Consistency:** The influx term $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{chan}}(t)}{F}$ has units of $(\\mathrm{pA}) / (\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = (\\mathrm{pC}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) / (\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This is a molar flux, not a concentration flux ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). It is dimensionally inconsistent with the rest of the equation without division by volume.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly Option A provides a set of equations that is correctly derived from the specified first principles, adheres to all definitions in the problem statement, and is dimensionally consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2702962"}, {"introduction": "Once a model is built, we can use it to quantify the functional properties of its components.

We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of a general expression for the instantaneous buffer capacity, $\\beta(C)$. The total calcium concentration, $C_{T}$, is defined as the sum of free calcium concentration, $C$, and the concentrations of all calcium-bound sites, $\\sum_i [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i$.\n$$C_{T} = C + \\sum_i [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i$$\nThe buffer capacity, $\\beta(C)$, is the derivative of $C_{T}$ with respect to $C$.\n$$\\beta(C) \\equiv \\frac{d C_{T}}{d C} = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( C + \\sum_i [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i \\right) = 1 + \\sum_i \\frac{d [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i}{d C}$$\nTo evaluate this derivative, we must first express the concentration of bound sites, $[\\mathrm{CaB}]_i$, as a function of the free calcium concentration, $C$. We use the law of mass action and the conservation of binding sites for each independent class $i$.\nThe total concentration of binding sites in class $i$ is constant: $B_{T,i} = [B]_i + [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i$, where $[B]_i$ is the concentration of unoccupied sites. From this, we have $[B]_i = B_{T,i} - [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i$.\nThe law of mass action provides the dissociation constant $K_{d,i}$:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{[B]_i C}{[\\mathrm{CaB}]_i}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[B]_i$ into the equation for $K_{d,i}$:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{(B_{T,i} - [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i) C}{[\\mathrm{CaB}]_i}$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $[\\mathrm{CaB}]_i$.\n$$K_{d,i} [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i = B_{T,i} C - [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i C$$\n$$[\\mathrm{CaB}]_i (K_{d,i} + C) = B_{T,i} C$$\n$$[\\mathrm{CaB}]_i = \\frac{B_{T,i} C}{K_{d,i} + C}$$\nThis expression gives the concentration of bound calcium for site class $i$ at equilibrium for a given free calcium concentration $C$. Now we can compute the derivative $\\frac{d [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i}{d C}$ using the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for a function $f(C)/g(C)$, the derivative is $(f'g - fg')/g^2$.\nLet $f(C) = B_{T,i} C$ and $g(C) = K_{d,i} + C$. Then $f'(C) = B_{T,i}$ and $g'(C) = 1$.\n$$\\frac{d [\\mathrm{CaB}]_i}{d C} = \\frac{B_{T,i} (K_{d,i} + C) - (B_{T,i} C)(1)}{(K_{d,i} + C)^2} = \\frac{B_{T,i} K_{d,i} + B_{T,i} C - B_{T,i} C}{(K_{d,i} + C)^2} = \\frac{B_{T,i} K_{d,i}}{(K_{d,i} + C)^2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\beta(C)$, we arrive at the closed-form analytical expression:\n$$\\beta(C) = 1 + \\sum_i \\frac{B_{T,i} K_{d,i}}{(K_{d,i} + C)^2}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we apply this formula to the specific case described. The cytosol contains two proteins, calmodulin (CaM) and calbindin-D28k (CB), resulting in four distinct classes of independent binding sites. All concentrations will be treated in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe site classes are as follows:\n$1$. CaM N-lobe sites: $B_{T,1} = 2 \\times [\\mathrm{CaM}]_{T} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$; $K_{d,1} = 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$2$.

As all concentration units $(\\mu\\mathrm{M})$ cancel, the buffer capacity $\\beta$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThird, we interpret the dependence of $\\beta(C)$ on $C$. The total buffer capacity is $\\beta(C) = 1 + \\sum_i \\beta_i(C)$, where $\\beta_i(C) = \\frac{B_{T,i} K_{d,i}}{(K_{d,i} + C)^2}$ is the contribution from buffer class $i$.\nEach $\\beta_i(C)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $C$. This means that a buffer is most effective at binding additional calcium (i.e., has the highest buffering capacity) when the free calcium concentration is very low.\nAt low $C$ ($C \\ll \\min\\{K_{d,i}\\}$): The buffer capacity approaches its maximum value, $\\beta(C) \\approx 1 + \\sum_i \\frac{B_{T,i}}{K_{d,i}}$. In this regime, the system's ability to resist changes in free calcium is highest. The largest contributions come from buffers with a high concentration of sites ($B_{T,i}$) and high affinity (low $K_{d,i}$).\nAt intermediate $C$ ($C$ is on the order of some $K_{d,i}$): As $C$ increases and approaches the $K_{d,i}$ of a particular buffer, that buffer's sites begin to saturate, and its contribution, $\\beta_i(C)$, decreases significantly. The total buffer capacity $\\beta(C)$ is a sum of these decreasing functions, so it also decreases. The overall function $\\beta(C)$ will exhibit a shape determined by the superposition of these individual decay curves, often showing regions of steeper decline (or \"shoulders\") for calcium concentrations around the $K_d$ values of the most prominent buffers.\nAt high $C$ ($C \\gg \\max\\{K_{d,i}\\}$): All binding sites are nearly saturated. For a given buffer $i$, $(K_{d,i} + C)^2 \\approx C^2$, so its contribution $\\beta_i(C) \\approx \\frac{B_{T,i} K_{d,i}}{C^2}$ becomes vanishingly small. The total buffer capacity $\\beta(C)$ approaches $1$. This signifies that the buffers are saturated and any added total calcium translates directly into an equivalent increase in free calcium, thus $dC_T \\approx dC$.\nIn summary, $\\beta(C)$ is a decaying function of $C$ that quantifies the cell's ability to buffer calcium, starting from a maximum at $C=0$ and decaying towards $1$ as all binding sites become saturated. Its value at any given $C$ reflects the summed contributions of all available non-saturated buffer sites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{170.2}$$", "id": "2702930"}, {"introduction": "The most powerful models are those that explain complex physiological phenomena that are not intuitively obvious.

The molecule (parvalbumin), its function as a $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffer, its competition with $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, the specified ion concentrations, and the kinetic properties (diffusion-limited on-rates, slow off-rates) are all consistent with established knowledge in cellular neuroscience. The problem is well-posed for a qualitative analysis, as it provides sufficient information on relative concentrations and timescales to deduce the system's behavior without requiring exact numerical values for all parameters. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nWe will analyze the state of the parvalbumin buffer system under different conditions by comparing the relevant timescales.\n\n1.  **Resting State Analysis**:\n    At rest, the concentrations are $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] \\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 1000\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ and $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\approx 50\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 0.05\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$. The on-rates for both ions are diffusion-limited and thus approximately equal ($k_{\\mathrm{on,Ca}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{on,Mg}}$). The competition for free parvalbumin sites ($P$) is therefore dominated by the species with the higher concentration. The ratio of concentrations is $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] / [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\approx 1000\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} / 0.05\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 20000$. Furthermore, the resting $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ of $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ is typically close to or above the dissociation constant $K_{D,\\mathrm{Mg}}$ for parvalbumin. Consequently, at rest, the vast majority of parvalbumin binding sites are occupied by $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. The buffer is effectively saturated with $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, meaning $[P\\mathrm{Mg}] \\approx [P]_{\\text{total}} = 100\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$, and very few sites are free ($[P] \\approx 0$) or calcium-bound ($[P\\mathrm{Ca}] \\approx 0$).\n\n2.  **Response to the First Action Potential**:\n    An action potential triggers a calcium pulse of $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\approx 10\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ for a duration of $\\tau_{\\text{pulse}} \\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. For parvalbumin to buffer this incoming $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, it must first have a free binding site. The creation of a free site from the dominant $P\\mathrm{Mg}$ pool requires the dissociation of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$: $P\\mathrm{Mg} \\to P + \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. The rate of this process is $k_{\\mathrm{off,Mg}}$. The problem states this is a slow process, occurring on \"subsecond to second timescales\". This means the characteristic time for dissociation, $\\tau_{\\text{off,Mg}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{off,Mg}}$, is on the order of $100\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ to $1000\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n    Since the calcium pulse duration ($\\tau_{\\text{pulse}} \\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$) is much shorter than the time required for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ to dissociate ($\\tau_{\\text{pulse}} \\ll \\tau_{\\text{off,Mg}}$), very few parvalbumin sites become available for binding during the brief calcium influx. Therefore, parvalbumin provides almost no buffering for the first spike. The peak free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ will be high, nearly what it would be in the absence of parvalbumin.\n\n3.  **Response to a High-Frequency Train ($100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$)**:\n    At $100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, the ISI is $\\approx 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. Both the $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ off-rates are slow, with time constants $\\tau_{\\text{off,Mg}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{off,Ca}}$ being much longer than the ISI ($\\tau_{\\text{off}} \\gg 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$).\n    During the train, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ continues to dissociate from $P\\mathrm{Mg}$ at its slow rate. Any site that becomes free is rapidly bound by $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during the subsequent spike's high-calcium pulse. Once a site is bound by $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to form $P\\mathrm{Ca}$, the calcium ion will remain bound for a time on the order of $\\tau_{\\text{off,Ca}}$, which spans multiple ISIs.\n    This leads to a cumulative process: over successive spikes, the pool of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-bound sites is progressively depleted, and the pool of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-bound sites grows. The effective buffering capacity for incoming $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ increases as the train proceeds. As a result, the peak free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ will be high for the first few spikes but will be progressively attenuated for later spikes.\n\n4.  **Response to a Low-Frequency Train ($20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$)**:\n    At $20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, the ISI is $\\approx 50\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. This interval is still shorter than the dissociation time constants $\\tau_{\\text{off,Mg}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{off,Ca}}$ (e.g., $50\\ \\mathrm{ms} < 100\\ \\mathrm{ms}$). Therefore, the same cumulative mechanism of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ displacement and $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulation will occur. However, the longer ISI of $50\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ (compared to $10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$) allows more time for the system to relax towards its resting state between spikes. Specifically, there is more time for any bound $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to dissociate and for free sites to be re-occupied by the high ambient concentration of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. Consequently, the build-up of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-bound parvalbumin is less pronounced, and the resulting attenuation of peak $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ during the train will be smaller than at $100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. At $100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, the first one or two spikes evoke peak free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ similar to the case without parvalbumin, but later spikes show progressively reduced peaks as $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is displaced and parvalbumin becomes increasingly $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-bound; at $20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ this delayed attenuation is much smaller.\nThis statement accurately describes the consequences of our analysis. The initial lack of buffering due to $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ occupancy leads to high initial peaks. The cumulative displacement of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ by $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during a high-frequency train leads to progressive attenuation of later peaks. The comparison to the $20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ case, where the effect is weaker due to the longer ISI, correctly captures the frequency dependence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. The slow $k_{\\mathrm{off,Ca}}$ of parvalbumin guarantees rapid binding during the submillisecond microdomain of the first spike, thereby reducing the first peak of free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ more than later peaks.\nThis is incorrect. While the on-rate is rapid, binding requires a free site. At rest, sites are occupied by $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and the rate-limiting step for making sites available is the slow dissociation of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. Therefore, buffering during the first spike is minimal, not maximal. The peak free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ is highest for the first spike, not most reduced.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Resting $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ occupancy causes parvalbumin to increase paired-pulse facilitation at $100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ by allowing residual free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ to accumulate between spikes.\nThis is incorrect. A calcium buffer, by definition, binds free $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, thereby *reducing* its concentration. The slow off-rate of parvalbumin makes it an effective sink for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ on the timescale of the ISI, which would reduce residual free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ and thus tend to cause paired-pulse depression, not facilitation. The stated mechanism is contrary to the function of a buffer.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. At $20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, the $50\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ interspike interval is long enough for substantial $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ dissociation so that parvalbumin fully engages within $2$–$3$ spikes, producing strong attenuation of later peaks.\nThis misinterprets the timescales. The dissociation of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ occurs on a \"subsecond to second\" timescale ($\\tau_{\\text{off,Mg}} \\ge 100\\ \\mathrm{ms}$). An ISI of $50\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ is *shorter* than this time constant, meaning only a fraction of sites can dissociate during one ISI. Engagement is gradual over many spikes, not \"fully\" within $2$–$3$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. The frequency dependence arises because the effective buffer capacity for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ increases during a high-frequency train as $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ vacates binding sites and $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ occupies them, reducing peak free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ and the probability of release in later spikes.\nThis statement correctly identifies the core biophysical mechanism underlying the observed behavior. The activity-dependent increase in effective $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffer capacity, driven by the slow kinetics of ion exchange, is precisely why parvalbumin's buffering effect is strongly frequency-dependent. This explains why later peaks in a high-frequency train are attenuated. This is a correct and fundamental explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth options A and E are correct. Option A provides a detailed description of the phenomenon (what happens), while option E provides the underlying mechanism (why it happens). Both accurately capture the system's behavior as requested by the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2702940"}]}
