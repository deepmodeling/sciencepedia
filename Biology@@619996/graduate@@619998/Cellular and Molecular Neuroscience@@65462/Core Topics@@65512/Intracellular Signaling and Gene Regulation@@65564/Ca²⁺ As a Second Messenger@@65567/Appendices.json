Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $R_k$ denote the peak residual free $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ concentration immediately after the $k$-th action potential (AP), for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The concentration is measured as an increment above the baseline, which is taken to be $0$.\n\nThe governing principles are:\n$1$. Upon the arrival of an AP, the concentration instantaneously increases by an amount $A$.\n$2$. Between APs, the concentration $R(t)$ decays according to the first-order kinetic equation $\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{R}{\\tau}$. The solution to this differential equation implies that over a time interval $\\Delta t$, the concentration is multiplied by a decay factor of $\\exp(-\\Delta t/\\tau)$.\n\nLet us derive the concentration step-by-step.\nLet the concentration just before the first AP be $R_{1}^-$.

The peak concentration after the $k$-th AP is the sum of the increment $A$ from the $k$-th spike plus the decayed remnants of the increments from all previous $k-1$ spikes.

The sum of such a series is given by the formula $S_k = a \\frac{1-r^k}{1-r}$.

The interspike interval is $\\Delta t = 1/50 \\text{ s} = 20 \\text{ ms}$, and the clearance time constant is $\\tau = 100 \\text{ ms}$.\nThe dimensionless ratio of these parameters is:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau} = \\frac{20 \\text{ ms}}{100 \\text{ ms}} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nSubstituting this ratio into the expression for $R_5$:\n$$R_5 = A \\frac{1 - \\exp(-5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5})}{1 - \\exp(-\\frac{1}{5})} = A \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1)}{1 - \\exp(-\\frac{1}{5})}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression as a function of $A$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative behavior, the degree of summation is determined by the ratio $\\Delta t/\\tau$. Here, $\\Delta t/\\tau = 0.2$. The decay factor over one interspike interval is $\\exp(-\\Delta t/\\tau) = \\exp(-0.2)$. Since the exponent's magnitude is much less than $1$, the decay factor is close to $1$. Specifically, $\\exp(-0.2) \\approx 0.82$. This means that approximately $82\\%$ of the residual calcium from a given AP persists until the next AP arrives. Because only a small fraction of the concentration decays between action potentials, the accumulation from one spike to the next is substantial. Consequently, the residual $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ summates strongly under these conditions. If the ratio were much larger (e.g., $\\Delta t \\gg \\tau$), summation would be negligible as the concentration would return to near baseline between spikes. Conversely, if the ratio were much smaller (e.g., $\\Delta t \\ll \\tau$), summation would approach linear, with $R_k \\approx kA$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{A \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "2701869"}, {"introduction": "An expert neuroscientist not only measures and models phenomena but also designs experiments to test specific hypotheses.

The BAPTA capture time is $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, which is comparable to $t_{\\mathrm{diff},1}$. Thus, BAPTA can substantially compete with calcium reaching the sensor and reduce the local peak $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ at the release site. In contrast, EGTA has $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} \\gg t_{\\mathrm{diff},1}$; it is far too slow to intercept ions during the submicrosecond diffusion time from channel to sensor in the tight regime. Therefore, in tight coupling:\n\n- BAPTA at $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ should strongly suppress synchronous evoked release (reduced EPSC amplitude).\n- EGTA at $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ should have little to no effect on synchronous evoked release.\n\nStep 3: Predict PPR, latency, and spontaneous release consequences.\n\n- Paired-pulse ratio (PPR): Because the vesicular release probability scales steeply with calcium (effective exponent $n \\approx 4$ to $5$), a decrease in the near-sensor $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ by BAPTA will reduce the first-pulse release probability $p_1$. Lower $p_1$ tends to increase PPR through reduced vesicle depletion and facilitation mechanisms. EGTA should not appreciably alter $p_1$ in tight coupling, so PPR should remain near control with EGTA.\n- Latency distribution of synchronous release: In a tight nanodomain, triggering occurs within the time window set by channel opening and submicrosecond diffusion. EGTA cannot alter this, so latency remains unaffected. BAPTA reduces the near-sensor $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, which primarily lowers the probability rather than introducing long delays for the remaining synchronous events, because when release does occur it is still triggered by near-instantaneous local calcium. Any shift or broadening in latency due to BAPTA should be minimal for the synchronous component in tight coupling.\n- Spontaneous miniature EPSC frequency: Spontaneous events that depend on brief, local calcium fluctuations near release sensors are expected to be more sensitive to fast buffering than to slow buffering in tight coupling. Thus, BAPTA can reduce miniature frequency, whereas EGTA will have little effect.\n\nStep 4: Option-by-option analysis.\n\nA. States that $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA strongly reduces evoked EPSC amplitude, increases PPR, minimally affects synchronous latency distribution, and reduces miniature frequency; $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA leaves evoked amplitude, PPR, and latency largely unchanged. This matches the tight nanodomain predictions derived above from $t_{\\mathrm{diff},1} \\ll t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{diff},1} \\sim t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}}$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Claims similar suppression and desynchronization for both BAPTA and EGTA, with unchanged PPR. For tight coupling, EGTA is too slow to intercept calcium before it reaches the sensor, so similar suppression is not expected. Furthermore, lowering release probability should increase PPR, not leave it unchanged. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Claims EGTA suppresses evoked EPSCs more than BAPTA and increases PPR more than BAPTA, with reduced latency variability. This inverts the kinetic expectation because $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\gg t_{\\mathrm{diff},1}$, making EGTA ineffective in tight coupling compared to BAPTA. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Claims no effect of either buffer because of saturation at the sensor. Even in nanodomains, BAPTA at $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ has a capture time comparable to the diffusion time and can significantly reduce near-sensor calcium and thus release probability. Therefore, no-effect predictions are not supported by the time-scale comparison and the steep calcium dependence of release. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the option that best supports tight nanodomain coupling is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2701958"}]}
