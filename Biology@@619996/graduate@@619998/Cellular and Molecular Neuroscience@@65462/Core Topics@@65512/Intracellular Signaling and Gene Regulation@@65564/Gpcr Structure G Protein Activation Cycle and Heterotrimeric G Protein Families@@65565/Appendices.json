We can express the concentration of free G protein as $[G] = [G]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [G \\cdot L]$. Substituting this into the rate equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d[G \\cdot L]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}([G]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [G \\cdot L])[L] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}[G \\cdot L] $$\nThe problem specifies pseudo-first-order conditions, where $[L] \\gg [G]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.

The receptor-bound G protein has an enhanced association rate constant, $\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, while the free G protein has the basal rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The dissociation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is unchanged for both populations. The overall rate of complex formation, where $[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total concentration of G-protein bound to ligand, sums the contributions from both pathways:\n$$ \\frac{d[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = \\gamma k_{\\mathrm{on}}[R^{\\ast}G][L] + k_{\\mathrm{on}}[G_{\\mathrm{F}}][L] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nThe assumption of rapid pre-equilibrium implies that the fractions $f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{R,free}}$ apply to the total pool of nucleotide-free G protein, $[G]_{\\mathrm{NF}}$, at any given moment. Thus, $[R^{\\ast}G] = f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}}[G]_{\\mathrm{NF}}$ and $[G_{\\mathrm{F}}] = f_{\\mathrm{R,free}}[G]_{\\mathrm{NF}}$. Substituting these into the rate equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = (\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{on}} f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}} f_{\\mathrm{R,free}})[G]_{\\mathrm{NF}}[L] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nWe can define an effective, population-averaged association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on,eff}} = \\gamma k_{\\mathrm{on}} f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}} f_{\\mathrm{R,free}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}(\\gamma f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}} + (1 - f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}})) = k_{\\mathrm{on}}(1 + (\\gamma - 1)f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}}) $$\nSubstituting this back, the rate equation simplifies to a form analogous to the no-receptor case:\n$$ \\frac{d[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}[G]_{\\mathrm{NF}}[L] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nUsing the conservation law $[G]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [G]_{\\mathrm{NF}} + [G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}[G]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[L] - (k_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}[L] + k_{\\mathrm{off}})[G \\cdot L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nThe new observed rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}}$, is therefore:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}} = k_{\\mathrm{on,eff}}[L] + k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}(1 + (\\gamma - 1)f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}})[L] + k_{\\mathrm{off}} $$\nThe time constant in the presence of receptor is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}}}$.\nWe now compute its value using $\\gamma=200$ and $f_{\\mathrm{R,bound}} = 4 - \\sqrt{11}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}} = (1.5 \\times 10^{6})(1 + (200 - 1)(4 - \\sqrt{11}))(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) + 0.01 $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}} = 1.5(1 + 199(4 - \\sqrt{11})) + 0.01 = 1.5(1 + 796 - 199\\sqrt{11}) + 0.01 $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}} = 1.5(797 - 199\\sqrt{11}) + 0.01 \\approx 1.5(136.9917) + 0.01 = 205.4875 + 0.01 = 205.4975\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = \\frac{1}{205.4975\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.004866\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the ratio $\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}/\\tau_{0}$\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio of the two time constants.\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\tau_{0}} = \\frac{1/k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}}}{1/k_{\\mathrm{obs,0}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs},0}}{k_{\\mathrm{obs,R}}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values we computed:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\tau_{0}} = \\frac{1.51}{205.4975} \\approx 0.0073480 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is $0.00735$.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core equation of the Black–Leff operational model, with a unitary Hill coefficient ($n=1$), relates the observed response, $E$, to the agonist concentration, $[A]$, via the system's maximal possible response, $E_m$, the agonist's equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_A$, and the operational efficacy parameter, $\\tau$.

The term $\\frac{\\tau}{1 + \\tau}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\tau$ for $\\tau > 0$. Therefore, a decrease in $[R_{tot}]$ leads to a decrease in $\\tau$, which in turn causes a **decrease in $E_{\\max}$**. Mechanistically, with fewer receptors, even at a saturating agonist concentration, the total stimulus that can be generated by the agonist-receptor complexes is lower. This reduced stimulus is insufficient to drive the downstream signaling cascade to its previous maximum, resulting in a depressed maximal response. This is the erosion of receptor reserve.\n\n- **Effect on $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$**: The half-maximal effective concentration is given by $\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = \\frac{K_A}{1 + \\tau}$. This expression is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\tau$ for $\\tau > 0$. Therefore, a decrease in $[R_{tot}]$ leads to a decrease in $\\tau$, which causes an **increase in $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$**. Mechanistically, a lower value of $\\tau$ signifies a less efficient system. To achieve the same level of stimulus (or, more precisely, to achieve half of the *new*, lower $E_{\\max}$), a larger fraction of the dwindled receptor population must be occupied by the agonist. According to the law of mass action, achieving a higher fractional occupancy requires a higher concentration of the agonist. Thus, the agonist appears less potent (the dose-response curve shifts to the right), as reflected by a higher $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. The agonist's affinity for the receptor, $K_A$, an intrinsic molecular property, remains unchanged.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8333 & 8.333\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2715770"}]}
