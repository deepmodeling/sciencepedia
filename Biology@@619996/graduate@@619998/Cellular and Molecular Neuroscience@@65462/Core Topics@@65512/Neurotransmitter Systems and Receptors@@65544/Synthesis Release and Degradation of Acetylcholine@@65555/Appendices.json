It presents a standard biophysical problem concerning reaction-diffusion kinetics in a neuronal synapse. All provided physical constants are within realistic ranges for the specified biological system. The approximations requested are standard and appropriate for an order-of-magnitude estimation. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a dimensionless ratio, $R$, which compares the characteristic time for diffusion of an acetylcholine (ACh) molecule across the synaptic cleft to the characteristic time for its enzymatic hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase (AChE).\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic diffusion time, $\\tau_d$. The problem specifies a one-dimensional treatment. The one-dimensional diffusion equation for the concentration $C(x,t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. A fundamental result derived from this equation is the mean-squared displacement (MSD) for a particle undergoing a one-dimensional random walk, which is:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t) = 2Dt\n$$\nHere, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t)$ is the average of the squared displacement from the origin after a time $t$. A standard and valid approximation for the characteristic time, $\\tau_d$, required for a particle to traverse a characteristic distance $L$ is the time at which the root-mean-square displacement, $\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle}$, is equal to $L$. This is equivalent to setting the MSD equal to $L^2$. In this problem, the characteristic distance is the thickness of the synaptic cleft, given as $x_{\\text{cleft}} = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We set $L = x_{\\text{cleft}}$.\n$$\nL^2 = 2D\\tau_d\n$$\nSolving for the characteristic diffusion time $\\tau_d$:\n$$\n\\tau_d = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\nThis model is justified because the cleft thickness ($L$) is significantly smaller than the lateral dimensions of a typical synapse, making one-dimensional diffusion the dominant mode of transport from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nNext, we determine the characteristic hydrolysis time, $\\tau_h$. The problem states that the ACh concentration is high enough for AChE to operate near catalytic saturation. In enzyme kinetics, the turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, is defined as the maximum number of substrate molecules that one active site of the enzyme can convert to product per unit time. This maximum rate is achieved when the enzyme is saturated with substrate, i.e., when $[ACh] \\gg K_M$, where $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant. Under these conditions, the process is limited only by the intrinsic catalytic speed of the enzyme. The characteristic time for a single catalytic event, or one turnover, is therefore the reciprocal of the turnover number. Thus, we define the characteristic hydrolysis time $\\tau_h$ as:\n$$\n\\tau_h = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\n$$\nThis is a justified model for the minimum time required to eliminate a single molecule of ACh once it has bound to an active AChE enzyme.\n\nWe are asked to compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic hydrolysis time:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_h}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\tau_d$ and $\\tau_h$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L^2}{2D} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\right)} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} L^2}{2D}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this expression. The values must be in consistent SI units.\nGiven:\nCleft thickness, $L = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 50.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nDiffusion coefficient, $D = 5.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\nCatalytic turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 1.40 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(1.40 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times (5.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}})}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{(1.40 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m^2})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{3.50 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}\n$$\n$$\nR = 3.50 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\nThe result is $R = 0.0350$. This dimensionless number is significantly less than 1, which means $\\tau_d \\ll \\tau_h$. This implies that the characteristic time for an ACh molecule to diffuse across the synaptic cleft is much shorter than the time required for a single catalytic turnover by a saturated AChE enzyme. In a synapse with a high density of AChE, this ensures that the overall clearance rate of ACh is not limited by how long it takes molecules to travel across the cleft, but rather by the combined process of finding and being hydrolyzed by an enzyme. The extreme catalytic efficiency of AChE ensures this entire sequence is incredibly rapid, terminating the signal effectively.\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.
