In electrophysiology, synaptic strength can be powerfully described by the synaptic conductance ($g_{syn}$), which reflects the total ion flow capacity of the activated receptors. This exercise provides practice in a foundational skill: calculating the peak synaptic conductance from a voltage-clamp recording by applying the conductance-based model of ionic current, a biological form of Ohm's Law [@problem_id:2720132]. Mastering this allows you to translate a measured current into a biophysically meaningful parameter.", "problem": "A whole-cell voltage-clamp recording in a hippocampal pyramidal neuron measures an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) mediated predominantly by ionotropic glutamate receptors of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate types, with minimal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor contribution at hyperpolarized potentials due to magnesium block.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular electrophysiology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed.\n\nThe fundamental relationship describing ionic current ($I$) through a population of ion channels is based on an electrical equivalent model of the cell membrane. This model is an extension of Ohm's law, which relates current, voltage, and resistance. In the context of ion channels, we use conductance ($g$), which is the reciprocal of resistance ($g = 1/R$). The current ($I$) is the product of the conductance ($g$) and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential ($V$) and the reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$) for the ions passing through the channels. This gives the foundational equation:\n$$I = g(V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nHere, $I$ is the net current, $V$ is the membrane potential, $g$ is the total conductance of the open channels, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the potential at which the net current is zero. By convention in electrophysiology, an inward flow of positive charge is defined as a negative current.\n\nThe problem provides data from a voltage-clamp experiment on a hippocampal pyramidal neuron. The holding potential is set to $V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, a hyperpolarized potential where N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are largely inactive due to a voltage-dependent block by extracellular magnesium ions ($\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$). The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) is therefore predominantly mediated by $\\alpha$-amino-$3$-hydroxy-$5$-methyl-$4$-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors. These receptors possess a current-voltage (I-V) relationship that is approximately linear, especially at negative membrane potentials. This linear behavior means their conductance ($g$) does not vary significantly with voltage in this range, justifying the use of the ohmic model $I = g(V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ with a constant $g$ as a valid approximation. The supplied peak EPSC is $I = -50\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, and the reversal potential for these non-selective cation channels is given as $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the synaptic conductance, $g$. We can rearrange the conductance-based equation to solve for $g$:\n$$g = \\frac{I}{V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}}$$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units. The standard unit for conductance is the Siemens ($\\mathrm{S}$), which is equivalent to Amperes per Volt ($\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}$). We convert the given values to base SI units:\nHolding potential: $V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\nPeak current: $I = -50\\,\\mathrm{pA} = -50 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\nReversal potential: $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the rearranged equation:\n$$g = \\frac{-50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A}}{(-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}) - (0\\ \\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{-50 \\times 10^{-12}}{-70 \\times 10^{-3}}\\ \\mathrm{S}$$\n$$g = \\frac{50}{70} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanoSiemens ($\\mathrm{nS}$), where $1\\ \\mathrm{nS} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}$. Therefore:\n$$g = \\frac{5}{7}\\ \\mathrm{nS}$$\nPerforming the division and rounding to three significant figures as required:\n$$g \\approx 0.7142857...\\ \\mathrm{nS} \\approx 0.714\\ \\mathrm{nS}$$\n\nFor this computed value of $g$ to represent the true underlying synaptic conductance rather than merely an apparent or effective conductance, at least two critical physiological assumptions must hold:\n\n$1$. **Adequate Space Clamp**: The voltage-clamp amplifier controls the voltage at the recording electrode, which is located at the soma of the neuron. The synapses generating the EPSC are located on the dendrites, which can be electrotonically distant. The assumption is that the voltage clamp is effective throughout the region where the active synapses are located, meaning the dendritic membrane potential at the synaptic sites is also clamped at $V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. If there is a significant voltage drop between the soma and the synapse (poor space clamp), the actual driving force at the synapse is smaller than assumed, and our calculation would underestimate the true synaptic conductance.\n\n$2$. **Stationarity of Reversal Potential**: The calculation assumes the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ remains constant at $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ during the EPSC. A large influx of cations could transiently alter the local ionic concentrations near the postsynaptic membrane, causing a shift in $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. If $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ changes during the current flow, the driving force is not constant, and the simple ohmic model becomes an approximation. For the computed $g$ to be accurate, any such activity-dependent shifts in ionic concentration gradients must be negligible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.714}$$", "id": "2720132"}, {"introduction": "Synapses rarely express a single type of receptor; the total excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) is typically a sum of currents flowing through different channels, such as AMPA and NMDA receptors.

The solution proceeds by applying the principle of linear superposition of currents and the method of pharmacological subtraction.\n\nThe total excitatory postsynaptic current ($I_{EPSC}$) at a given membrane potential ($V_m$) is the linear sum of the currents from distinct receptor classes.
