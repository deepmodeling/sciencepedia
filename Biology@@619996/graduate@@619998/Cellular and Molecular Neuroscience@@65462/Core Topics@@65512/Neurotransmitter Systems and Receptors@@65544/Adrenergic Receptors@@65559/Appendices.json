The most immediate and primary change in second messengers is therefore a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate also acutely elevates cytosolic calcium by release from intracellular stores.\n\nBy contrast, an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate would require coupling to $G_s$ (typical of $\\beta_2$ with native intracellular domains), which this chimera lacks; a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate would require $G_i$ coupling (typical of $\\alpha_2$), which is also absent. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a hallmark of receptor tyrosine kinases, not GPCRs. Given proper expression and folding and the presence of downstream components, no-change is implausible because the receptor will both bind ligand and couple to $G_q$.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary second messenger change is an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326649"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from qualitative principles to rigorous quantitative analysis of agonist action, a hallmark of graduate-level pharmacology.

Phenylephrine is applied cumulatively to evoke a phospholipase C–mediated contraction downstream of α1AR, a G protein–coupled receptor. You are told the following foundational, widely used descriptions apply:\n\n- Ligand–receptor binding follows mass action (Langmuir binding): the fraction of receptors occupied is $[A]/(K_A + [A])$, where $[A]$ is agonist concentration and $K_A$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the agonist–receptor complex.\n- The cell’s stimulus–response coupling is monotonic and well-approximated by a rectangular hyperbola with unit Hill coefficient: the stimulus $S$ generated by the agonist is proportional to the concentration of agonist–receptor complex, $S = e\\,[AR]$, and the response is $E = E_{\\max}\\,S/(K_E + S)$, where $e$ is the intrinsic efficacy per occupied receptor, $K_E$ is a lumped transduction constant, and $E_{\\max}$ is the system’s maximal possible response if coupling were saturating.\n\nDefine the total receptor concentration as $R_T$ and the operational efficacy (also called the transducer ratio) as $\\tau \\equiv e\\,R_T/K_E$.

Starting from mass-action binding and the hyperbolic stimulus–response relation, express the concentration–response function $E([A])$ in terms of $[A]$, $K_A$, and $\\tau$ (you may eliminate $e$, $R_T$, and $K_E$ in favor of $\\tau$).

Substituting the expression for $[AR]$:\n$$S = e R_T \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}$$\nThe response, $E$, is a hyperbolic function of the stimulus $S$:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\frac{S}{K_E + S}$$\nSubstitute the expression for $S$ into the equation for $E$:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{e R_T \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}}{K_E + e R_T \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}}$$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by $(K_A + [A])$:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{e R_T [A]}{K_E(K_A + [A]) + e R_T [A]}$$\nTo introduce the operational efficacy $\\tau = e R_T / K_E$, we divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $K_E$:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\frac{e R_T}{K_E} [A]}{(K_A + [A]) + \\frac{e R_T}{K_E} [A]}$$\nSubstituting $\\tau$ yields the final form of the concentration-response function:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau [A]}{K_A + [A] + \\tau [A]} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]}$$\nThis is the required expression for $E([A])$.\n\nNext, we find the expression for $EC_{50}$. $EC_{50}$ is the concentration $[A]$ that elicits $50\\%$ of the agonist's own maximal response, which we denote $E'_{max}$. The value of $E'_{max}$ is the limit of $E([A])$ as $[A] \\to \\infty$:\n$$E'_{max} = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} E([A]) = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}$$\nNow, we set $E([A])$ equal to $\\frac{1}{2} E'_{max}$ and solve for $[A] = EC_{50}$:\n$$E(EC_{50}) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau EC_{50}}{K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}} = \\frac{1}{2} E'_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}$$\nAssuming $E_{\\max} \\ne 0$ and $\\tau \\ne 0$, we can cancel these terms:\n$$\\frac{EC_{50}}{K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}} = \\frac{1}{2(1+\\tau)}$$\nCross-multiplication gives:\n$$2(1+\\tau)EC_{50} = K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}$$\nRearranging to solve for $EC_{50}$:\n$$2(1+\\tau)EC_{50} - (1+\\tau)EC_{50} = K_A$$\n$$(1+\\tau)EC_{50} = K_A$$\n$$EC_{50} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau}$$\nThis equation shows that for an agonist with $\\tau > 0$, the $EC_{50}$ is less than the dissociation constant $K_A$. This represents a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve relative to the binding curve, a hallmark of systems with \"receptor reserve\" or signal amplification.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Reducing Receptor Density**\n\nReducing the receptor density to a fraction $\\alpha$ of its baseline value means the new total receptor concentration is $\\alpha R_T$. According to the problem statement, this scales $\\tau$ proportionally. Let the baseline transducer ratio be $\\tau_{base} = e R_T / K_E$. The new transducer ratio, $\\tau_{new}$, is:\n$$\\tau_{new} = \\frac{e (\\alpha R_T)}{K_E} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{e R_T}{K_E}\\right) = \\alpha \\tau_{base}$$\nThe new $EC_{50}$, denoted $EC_{50, new}$, is found by substituting $\\tau_{new}$ into the general expression for $EC_{50}$:\n$$EC_{50, new} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau_{new}} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\alpha \\tau_{base}}$$\nSince $\\alpha < 1$ for receptor reduction and $\\tau_{base} > 0$ for an agonist, it follows that $1+\\alpha \\tau_{base} < 1+\\tau_{base}$. Therefore, $EC_{50, new} > EC_{50, base}$. This means reducing receptor density increases the $EC_{50}$, causing a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve (a decrease in potency). As $\\alpha \\to 0$, $EC_{50, new} \\to K_A$. Thus, reducing receptor reserve shifts the $EC_{50}$ rightward towards the value of $K_A$.\n\n**Part 3: Specific Calculation**\n\nGiven a baseline $\\tau_{base} = 9$ and a reduction factor $\\alpha = 0.1$.\nThe baseline $EC_{50}$ is:\n$$EC_{50, base} = \\frac{K_A}{1 + \\tau_{base}} = \\frac{K_A}{1+9} = \\frac{K_A}{10}$$\nThe new transducer ratio is $\\tau_{new} = \\alpha \\tau_{base} = 0.1 \\times 9 = 0.9$.\nThe new $EC_{50}$ is:\n$$EC_{50, new} = \\frac{K_A}{1 + \\tau_{new}} = \\frac{K_A}{1+0.9} = \\frac{K_A}{1.9}$$\nThe fold-change in $EC_{50}$ is the ratio $EC_{50, new} / EC_{50, base}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{K_A/1.9}{K_A/10} = \\frac{10}{1.9} \\approx 5.263$$\nThe $EC_{50}$ increases by approximately $5.3$-fold.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a system with receptor reserve ($\\tau>0$), the observed $EC_{50}$ is shifted leftward from $K_A$ such that $EC_{50} = K_A/(1+\\tau)$. Reducing receptor density scales $\\tau$ and shifts $EC_{50}$ rightward toward $K_A$; with baseline $\\tau=9$ and $\\alpha=0.1$, $EC_{50}$ increases by approximately $5.3$-fold.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with the derivations. The formula $EC_{50} = K_A/(1+\\tau)$ is correct. The qualitative description of the rightward shift of $EC_{50}$ toward $K_A$ upon receptor density reduction is correct. The quantitative calculation of the $\\approx 5.3$-fold increase in $EC_{50}$ is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Receptor reserve does not affect $EC_{50}$, which always equals $K_A$; therefore, reducing receptor density has no effect on phenylephrine potency.**\nThis is incorrect. The derivation shows $EC_{50} = K_A/(1+\\tau)$, which depends on $\\tau$ (a measure of receptor reserve). It only equals $K_A$ if $\\tau=0$. Consequently, reducing receptor density, which alters $\\tau$, does affect potency.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Receptor reserve ($\\tau>0$) decreases apparent affinity so that $EC_{50} > K_A$. Reducing receptor density increases apparent affinity, shifting $EC_{50}$ leftward.**\nThis statement reverses the correct relationships. Receptor reserve increases apparent potency, meaning $EC_{50} < K_A$. Reducing receptor density decreases apparent potency, increasing $EC_{50}$ and shifting it rightward.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The fold-shift in $EC_{50}$ after reducing receptor density to a fraction $\\alpha$ depends only on $\\alpha$ and equals $1/\\alpha$; for $\\alpha=0.1$, $EC_{50}$ increases $10$-fold regardless of $\\tau$.**\nThis is incorrect. The derived fold-change is $(1+\\tau)/(1+\\alpha\\tau)$, which depends on both $\\alpha$ and $\\tau$. The statement that the shift is $1/\\alpha$ is an approximation valid only for very large $\\tau$. For the given values, the change is $\\approx5.3$-fold, not $10$-fold.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If phenylephrine has limited intrinsic efficacy, reducing receptor density can decrease $EC_{50}$ because fewer receptors sequester agonist, increasing free $[A]$ at the remaining receptors.**\nThis is incorrect. First, within the provided model, reducing receptor density always increases $EC_{50}$ (or leaves it unchanged if $\\tau=0$); it never decreases it. Second, the reasoning invokes agonist sequestration or \"buffering,\" a phenomenon not included in the standard mass-action model provided, which assumes $[A]$ is not depleted by binding.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2697624"}]}
