It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no logical flaws or contradictions. The solution process is authorized to proceed.\n\nThe solution is developed as follows.\nLet $S_1$ and $S_2$ denote the states of the two GluA2 subunits within a single AMPAR tetramer. The state can be either unedited (Q) or edited (R). The probability of a single GluA2 subunit being in the edited state (R) is given as $p$.\n$$ P(S_i = \\text{R}) = p $$\nConsequently, the probability of a single GluA2 subunit being in the unedited state (Q) is:\n$$ P(S_i = \\text{Q}) = 1 - p $$\nThe problem states that the editing events for the two subunits are independent. Therefore, we can calculate the probabilities of the four possible compositions of the two GluA2 subunits in a receptor:\n1. Both subunits are edited (R, R): The probability is $P(\\text{R, R}) = P(S_1 = \\text{R}) \\times P(S_2 = \\text{R}) = p \\times p = p^2$.\n2. The first is edited, the second is unedited (R, Q): The probability is $P(\\text{R, Q}) = P(S_1 = \\text{R}) \\times P(S_2 = \\text{Q}) = p(1-p)$.\n3. The first is unedited, the second is edited (Q, R): The probability is $P(\\text{Q, R}) = P(S_1 = \\text{Q}) \\times P(S_2 = \\text{R}) = (1-p)p$.\n4. Both subunits are unedited (Q, Q): The probability is $P(\\text{Q, Q}) = P(S_1 = \\text{Q}) \\times P(S_2 = \\text{Q}) = (1-p)(1-p) = (1-p)^2$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $p^2 + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^2 = (p + (1-p))^2 = 1^2 = 1$, as expected.\n\nNext, we assign a $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx value, $I$, to each of these states based on the given rules:\n- If at least one GluA2(R) is present, the influx is $0$. This applies to the (R, R), (R, Q), and (Q, R) configurations.\n- If both subunits are GluA2(Q), the influx is $I_0$. This applies only to the (Q, Q) configuration.\n\nThe expected $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx, $\\langle I \\rangle$, is the sum of the products of the influx for each state and the probability of that state:\n$$ \\langle I \\rangle = I(\\text{R,R}) P(\\text{R,R}) + I(\\text{R,Q}) P(\\text{R,Q}) + I(\\text{Q,R}) P(\\text{Q,R}) + I(\\text{Q,Q}) P(\\text{Q,Q}) $$\nSubstituting the values and probabilities:\n$$ \\langle I \\rangle = (0 \\times p^2) + (0 \\times p(1-p)) + (0 \\times (1-p)p) + (I_0 \\times (1-p)^2) $$\n$$ \\langle I \\rangle = I_0 (1-p)^2 $$\nThe problem asks for the expected normalized influx, which is $\\frac{\\langle I \\rangle}{I_0}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle}{I_0} = \\frac{I_0 (1-p)^2}{I_0} = (1-p)^2 $$\nThis is the derived expression for the expected normalized $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx as a function of the editing probability $p$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression for the specified values of $p$.\n1. For $p=0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle}{I_0} = (1 - 0)^2 = 1^2 = 1 $$\nThis result is logical: if there is no editing ($p=0$), all GluA2 subunits are GluA2(Q), and all receptors are fully permeable to $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.\n\n2. For $p=0.5$:\n$$ \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle}{I_0} = (1 - 0.5)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 $$\nThis indicates that when half the GluA2 pool is edited, only $25\\%$ of the maximal possible $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ current is observed, because only receptors with two unedited subunits contribute.\n\n3. For $p=1$:\n$$ \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle}{I_0} = (1-1)^2 = 0^2 = 0 $$\nThis result is also logical: if editing is complete ($p=1$), every GluA2 subunit is GluA2(R). Therefore, every receptor contains at least one GluA2(R), and all receptors are impermeable to $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.\n\nThe final values, in the specified order for $p=0$, $p=0.5$, and $p=1$, are $1$, $0.25$, and $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.25 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2698367"}, {"introduction": "The AMPA receptor population at a single synapse is remarkably diverse, comprising different splice isoforms like 'flip' and 'flop' and associating with various auxiliary subunits such as TARPs.

Potentiated Conductance ($G_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$)**\n\nAfter plasticity, GluA1-lacking receptors (type $2$) are unaffected. Their contribution to conductance remains $G_{2}^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = G_{2}^{\\mathrm{base}} = 32\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.\n\nThe GluA1-containing receptor population (type $1$) becomes heterogeneous due to phosphorylation at S831 and S845. As these events are independent, the total pool of $N_{1}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$ receptors can be divided into four subpopulations:\n1.  Unphosphorylated (U): Fraction $(1-p_{831})(1-p_{845})$\n2.  S831-phosphorylated only (P831): Fraction $p_{831}(1-p_{845})$\n3.  S845-phosphorylated only (P845): Fraction $(1-p_{831})p_{845}$\n4.  Doubly phosphorylated (DP): Fraction $p_{831}p_{845}$\n\nThe total conductance from the type 1 population, $G_{1}^{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, is the sum of contributions from these four subpopulations. Due to the independence of the phosphorylation events, this sum can be factored.\n$$G_1^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = N_1^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot [(1-p_{831}) + p_{831}\\sigma_{831}] \\cdot \\left[ (1-p_{845}) \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} P_{o,0}\\gamma_1 + p_{845} \\frac{\\beta_{845}k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{\\beta_{845}k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} (\\delta_{845}P_{o,0}) \\gamma_1\\right]$$\nThis expression is incorrect. The correct approach, exploiting independence, is to sum the contributions, which simplifies to:\n$$ G_1^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = N_1^{\\mathrm{tot}}P_{o,0}\\gamma_1 \\cdot [(1-p_{831}) + p_{831}\\sigma_{831}] \\cdot \\left[ (1-p_{845})\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} + p_{845}\\delta_{845}\\frac{\\beta_{845}k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{\\beta_{845}k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} \\right] $$\nSubstituting values as exact fractions: $p_{831} = \\frac{3}{5}$, $p_{845} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\sigma_{831} = \\frac{3}{2}$, $\\beta_{845} = 2$, $\\delta_{845} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\nFirst factor (conductance multiplier from S831):\n$$ (1-p_{831}) + p_{831}\\sigma_{831} = \\left(1-\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + \\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{13}{10} $$\nSecond factor (trafficking and $P_o$ multiplier from S845):\nThe baseline trafficking term is $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nThe modified trafficking term is $\\frac{\\beta_{845}k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{\\beta_{845}k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 0.04}{2\\cdot 0.04+0.06} = \\frac{0.08}{0.14} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n$$ \\left[ (1-p_{845})\\frac{2}{5} + p_{845}\\delta_{845}\\frac{4}{7} \\right] = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{14+25}{70} = \\frac{39}{70} $$\nThe pre-factor is $N_1^{\\mathrm{tot}} P_{o,0} \\gamma_1 = 80 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 15\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 240\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.\n\nNow, we compute $G_1^{\\mathrm{LTP}}$:\n$$ G_1^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = 240\\,\\mathrm{pS} \\cdot \\frac{13}{10} \\cdot \\frac{39}{70} = 24 \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\frac{39}{70}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 39}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{6084}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} $$\nThe total potentiated conductance is:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = G_{1}^{\\mathrm{LTP}} + G_{2}^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = \\frac{6084}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} + 32\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{6084 + 32 \\cdot 35}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{6084 + 1120}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{7204}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS}$$\n\n**3.
