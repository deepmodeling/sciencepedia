It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of receptor pharmacology and the specific properties of the NMDA receptor. The co-agonist requirement and the removal of magnesium block are standard experimental paradigms. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, assumptions ($e.g.$, independent sites, mass-action kinetics), and data to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a single binding site by a ligand, $L$, is derived from the law of mass action for the binding equilibrium:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nwhere $R$ is the free receptor site, $L$ is the free ligand, and $RL$ is the ligand-receptor complex. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined at equilibrium as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nThe total concentration of receptor sites, $[R_{total}]$, is the sum of free and occupied sites:\n$$ [R_{total}] = [R] + [RL] $$\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the ratio of occupied sites to total sites:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{total}]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we can express $[R]$ in terms of $[RL]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[RL]$ (assuming $[RL] \\ne 0$) yields:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single non-cooperative binding site.\n\nApplying this general formula to the glutamate and glycine binding sites of the NMDA receptor, we derive their respective fractional occupancies, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{Glu}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{Gly}}$.\nFor the glutamate site:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{Glu}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Glu}]}{[\\mathrm{Glu}] + K_{d,\\mathrm{Glu}}} $$\nFor the glycine site:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Gly}]}{[\\mathrm{Gly}] + K_{d,\\mathrm{Gly}}} $$\nThese expressions fulfill the first part of the task.\n\nThe problem states that the channel requires simultaneous occupancy of both sites to gate and that the sites are independent. The fractional open probability, $P_{open}$, is therefore the joint probability of both sites being occupied. For independent events, this is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of a single site being occupied is its fractional occupancy. Thus:\n$$ P_{open} = P(\\text{Glu site occupied}) \\times P(\\text{Gly site occupied}) $$\n$$ P_{open} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{Glu}} \\times \\theta_{\\mathrm{Gly}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for fractional occupancy:\n$$ P_{open} = \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Glu}]}{[\\mathrm{Glu}] + K_{d,\\mathrm{Glu}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Gly}]}{[\\mathrm{Gly}] + K_{d,\\mathrm{Gly}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression fulfills the second part of the task.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $K_{d,\\mathrm{Glu}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, $K_{d,\\mathrm{Gly}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, $[\\mathrm{Glu}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, and $[\\mathrm{Gly}] = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fractional occupancy for the glutamate site:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{Glu}} = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} + 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nNext, we calculate the fractional occupancy for the glycine site:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = \\frac{0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe fractional open probability is the product of these two values:\n$$ P_{open} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{Glu}} \\times \\theta_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} $$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to $3$ significant figures:\n$$ \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.22222... $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures gives $0.222$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.222}$$", "id": "2770923"}, {"introduction": "With co-agonist binding established, we now introduce the second critical feature: the voltage-dependent block by extracellular magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$).

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires analyzing two aspects: the reversal potential ($E_{rev}$) and the conductance at $V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n1.  **Reversal Potential ($E_{rev}$)**\n    The problem states that Mg$^{2+}$ is an impermeant pore blocker and does not change permeant ion gradients or the intrinsic properties of the channel when it is open and unblocked. The reversal potential of the NMDAR is determined by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, which depends on the concentrations and relative permeabilities of the ions that can pass through the channel (primarily Na$^+$, K$^+$, and Ca$^{2+}$). Since the Mg$^{2+}$ block mechanism described does not affect these parameters, the reversal potential will not change. It will remain near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n2.  **Conductance at $V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$**\n    The effect of Mg$^{2+}$ is described by the Woodhull model for voltage-dependent open-channel block. The fraction of open channels that are **not** blocked by Mg$^{2+}$ at a given voltage $V$ and extracellular magnesium concentration $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_o$ is given by:\n    $$ P_{unblocked}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_o}{K_d(V)}} $$\n    where $K_d(V)$ is the voltage-dependent dissociation constant. The model specifies its voltage dependence as:\n    $$ K_d(V) = K_d(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right) $$\n    We are given all the necessary constants to evaluate this expression at $V = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -0.070\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $z = +2$\n    - $\\delta = 0.7$\n    - $K_d(0) = 20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n    - $V = -0.070\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n    - $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$\n    - $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n    - $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C/mol}$\n\n    First, let's calculate the exponential term $\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}$:\n    The thermal voltage is $\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C/mol}} \\approx 0.02568\\,\\mathrm{J/C} = 0.02568\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    The exponent is $\\frac{z \\delta V}{RT/F} = \\frac{(2)(0.7)(-0.070\\,\\mathrm{V})}{0.02568\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx \\frac{-0.098}{0.02568} \\approx -3.816$.\n\n    Now we calculate the dissociation constant at $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n    $$ K_d(-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = (20\\,\\mathrm{mM}) \\exp(-3.816) \\approx 20 \\times 0.0220 = 0.44\\,\\mathrm{mM} $$\n    The low value of $K_d$ at this negative potential indicates that Mg$^{2+}$ block is very potent.\n\n    The question asks about the \"slope conductance\". This term can be interpreted either as the true derivative of the I-V curve, $g_{slope} = dI/dV$, or as the chord conductance, $G_{chord} = I / (V-E_{rev})$. In the context of multiple-choice questions assessing the magnitude of an effect, the simpler chord conductance is often intended. Let us evaluate the consequence of both interpretations.\n\n    The total macroscopic current is $I(V) = G_{max} (V-E_{rev}) P_{unblocked}(V)$, where $G_{max}$ is the conductance if all channels were open and unblocked.\n    The chord conductance is therefore $G_{chord}(V) = G_{max} P_{unblocked}(V)$. Its value is directly proportional to the fraction of unblocked channels.\n\n    Let's calculate the ratio of the chord conductances for $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_o = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ versus $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    - At $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_o = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$:\n      $$ P_{unblocked,1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{0.44\\,\\mathrm{mM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2.273} = \\frac{1}{3.273} \\approx 0.3055 $$\n    - At $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_o = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$:\n      $$ P_{unblocked,3} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{0.44\\,\\mathrm{mM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 6.818} = \\frac{1}{7.818} \\approx 0.1279 $$\n\n    The ratio of the chord conductances is:\n    $$ \\frac{G_{chord}(3\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{G_{chord}(1\\,\\mathrm{mM})} = \\frac{P_{unblocked,3}}{P_{unblocked,1}} \\approx \\frac{0.1279}{0.3055} \\approx 0.4186 $$\n    This means the conductance decreases to approximately $0.42$ of its initial value, which corresponds to a $1/0.4186 \\approx 2.39$-fold decrease. This result matches the quantitative part of option A precisely.\n\n    For completeness, the true slope conductance is $g_{slope}(V) = dI/dV$. This calculation yields $g_{slope}(V) = G_{max} [P_{unblocked}(V) + (V-E_{rev}) dP_{unblocked}/dV]$. At $V=-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, this derivative is negative due to the strong voltage-dependence of the block, a phenomenon known as negative slope resistance. A full calculation shows the ratio of true slope conductances, $|g_{slope}(3\\,\\mathrm{mM}) / g_{slope}(1\\,\\mathrm{mM})|$, is approximately $0.59$, which does not match any option. Furthermore, the slope conductance value itself increases (becomes less negative), which contradicts the \"decreases\" wording in option A.\n\n    Given the exact match between the chord conductance calculation and the value provided in option A, it is logical to conclude that \"slope conductance\" is used in this context to refer to the effective conductance modulated by the block, which is best represented by the chord conductance.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. The slope conductance at $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ decreases to roughly $0.42$ of its value at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (approximately a $2.4$-fold decrease); the reversal potential remains near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.**\n    - **Reversal Potential**: **Correct**. As derived, $E_{rev}$ is unaffected by the impermeant blocker.\n    - **Conductance Change**: **Correct**. Our calculation shows that the chord conductance (the most plausible interpretation) decreases to $\\approx 0.42$ of its value at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ Mg$^{2+}$.

Thus, the total free energy of binding at voltage $V$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{bind}(V) = \\Delta G_{bind}(0) + zF\\delta V\n$$\nSubstituting the relation $\\Delta G_{bind} = RT \\ln(K_d)$:\n$$\nRT \\ln(K_{d}(V)) = RT \\ln(K_{d}(0)) + zF\\delta V\n$$\nDividing by $RT$:\n$$\n\\ln(K_{d}(V)) = \\ln(K_{d}(0)) + \\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the expression for $K_{d}(V)$:\n$$\nK_{d}(V) = \\exp\\left(\\ln(K_{d}(0)) + \\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}\\right) = K_{d}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Woodhull equation for an external blocker. For an external divalent cation like $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, $z=+2$. The fractional distance $\\delta$ is positive. The constants $F$, $R$, and $T$ are also positive. Depolarization means the membrane potential $V$ increases (becomes less negative or positive). Consequently, the term in the exponent, $\\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}$, increases. This leads to an increase in $K_{d}(V)$.\n\nA higher dissociation constant $K_{d}(V)$ signifies weaker binding of the blocker. Weaker binding means the blocker is less likely to occupy its site in the pore. This relieves the block. To confirm this from the expression in Task 1:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}}\n$$\nAs depolarization increases $V$, $K_{d}(V)$ increases. This causes the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}$ to decrease. The decrease in this ratio leads to a smaller denominator, which in turn causes the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)$ to increase. Therefore, depolarization increases the unblocked fraction of channels by electrostatically repelling the positively charged magnesium ion from its binding site within the membrane's electric field.\n\nTask 3: Compute the normalized open probability $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}(V)$ at $V=-65\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe expression for $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}(V)$ is given as the product of the probabilities of ligand occupancy and the fraction of unblocked channels:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{rel}}(V) = \\left(\\frac{[{\\mathrm{Glu}}]}{[{\\mathrm{Glu}}]+K_{d,{\\mathrm{Glu}}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{[{\\mathrm{Gly}}]}{[{\\mathrm{Gly}}]+K_{d,{\\mathrm{Gly}}}}\\right)\\times f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the ligand occupancy terms. The concentrations and dissociation constants are given in the same units ($\\mathrm{\\mu M}$), so the ratios are dimensionless.\n\nFor glutamate: $[{\\mathrm{Glu}}] = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, $K_{d,{\\mathrm{Glu}}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Glu}} = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 + 3.0} = \\frac{1.0}{4.0} = 0.25\n$$\nFor glycine: $[{\\mathrm{Gly}}] = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, $K_{d,{\\mathrm{Gly}}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = \\frac{0.30}{0.30 + 0.10} = \\frac{0.30}{0.40} = 0.75\n$$\nNext, we calculate $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)$ at $V = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -0.065\\,\\mathrm{V}$. We must first find the value of the exponent in the expression for $K_{d}(V)$.
