The sole mechanism for this extrusion, as defined by the problem, is the $\\mathrm{Na^+}/\\mathrm{K^+}$-ATPase.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{ATP}}$ be the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed. Let $\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{Na^+, out}}$ be the number of sodium ions extruded from the cell by the pump. The pump's stoichiometry is given as $3$ $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ ions extruded per $1$ ATP molecule hydrolyzed. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{Na^+, out}}}{N_{\\text{ATP}}} = 3\n$$\n\nThe condition for restoring the steady state is that the number of ions extruded must exactly equal the number of ions that entered:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{Na^+, out}} = \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{Na^+, in}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values into this conservation equation:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{Na^+, out}} = 3\n$$\n\nWe can now use the pump's stoichiometric equation to find the required number of ATP molecules, $N_{\\text{ATP}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{3}{N_{\\text{ATP}}} = 3\n$$\nSolving for $N_{\\text{ATP}}$ yields:\n$$\nN_{\\text{ATP}} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\n$$\n\nThus, the hydrolysis of exactly $1$ molecule of ATP is required to power the $\\mathrm{Na^+}/\\mathrm{K^+}$-ATPase to extrude the $3$ sodium ions that entered the cell during the uptake of $1$ molecule of glutamate.\n\nThe information regarding the influx of $2$ potassium ions ($\\mathrm{K^+}$) per ATP molecule is extraneous to the question asked, which is concerned only with the extrusion of sodium and the associated ATP cost.
