The slope factor $k$ is unchanged, i.e., $k_{\\text{mutant}} \\approx k_{\\text{wild type}}$.\n7.  The system is at a constant absolute temperature $T$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in established biophysical principles, is well-posed, and contains sufficient information to arrive at a logically consistent conclusion. The apparent contradiction—that a shift in $V_{1/2}$ occurs while a parameter related to gating charge ($k$) remains constant—is the central point to be resolved. The problem is therefore deemed valid as a test of understanding the underlying model.\n\nWe begin from first principles. The equilibrium between the resting (R) and activated (A) states of the voltage sensor is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the probabilities of being in the activated state ($P_A$) versus the resting state ($P_R$) is given by:\n$$ \\frac{P_A}{P_R} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_B T_m}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\Delta G(V)$ is the free energy difference per molecule, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_m$ is the molecular temperature (equivalent to the bulk absolute temperature $T$). The problem statement uses molar quantities ($F$, $R$), so we will use the molar form:\n$$ \\frac{P_A}{P_R} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\Delta G(V)$ is now the free energy difference per mole of channels, and $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\nThe probability of the channel being open, $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$, is equivalent to the probability of the sensor being in the activated state, $P_A$:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = P_A = \\frac{P_A}{P_A + P_R} = \\frac{1}{1 + P_R/P_A} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{RT}\\right)} $$\nSubstituting the given expression for the free energy, $\\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} - z F V$:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - zFV}{RT}\\right)} $$\nTo compare this theoretical expression with the experimental fit, we rearrange the term in the exponential:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{zF}{RT}\\left(V - \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{zF}\\right)\\right)} $$\nThe provided experimental form is:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)} $$\nBy direct comparison of these two forms, we can identify the relationships between the microscopic thermodynamic parameters ($z$, $\\Delta G_{0}$) and the macroscopic experimental parameters ($V_{1/2}$, $k$).\n\nThe half-activation voltage, $V_{1/2}$, is the voltage at which $P_{\\text{open}}(V) = 1/2$. In the theoretical expression, this occurs when the argument of the exponential is zero. This leads to:\n$$ V - \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{zF} = 0 \\implies V = V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{zF} $$\nThe slope factor, $k$, determines the steepness of the voltage dependence. By comparing the exponents, we find:\n$$ \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{zF}{RT} \\implies k = \\frac{RT}{zF} $$\nThis equation establishes a direct inverse relationship between the apparent gating charge $z$ and the slope factor $k$.\n\nThe problem states that for the mutation, the fitted slope factor $k$ is unchanged within experimental uncertainty. Let $z_{wt}$ and $z_{mut}$ be the apparent gating charges for the wild-type and mutant channels, respectively. The condition $k_{wt} = k_{mut}$ implies:\n$$ \\frac{RT}{z_{wt}F} = \\frac{RT}{z_{mut}F} $$\nSince $R$, $T$, and $F$ are non-zero constants, this equality can only hold if:\n$$ z_{wt} = z_{mut} $$\nThis leads to the direct conclusion that the change in apparent gating charge, $\\Delta z = z_{mut} - z_{wt}$, must be zero.\n$$ \\Delta z = 0 $$\nThis is the only estimate consistent with the provided model and experimental observation that $k$ is unchanged.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a justification and an articulation of the limitations of inferring $\\Delta z$ from a shift in $V_{1/2}$ when $k$ is constant.\nThe justification for the estimate $\\Delta z = 0$ follows directly from the fundamental relation $k=RT/zF$, which is an inherent feature of this two-state Boltzmann model. An unchanged slope factor $k$ necessitates an unchanged gating charge $z$.\n\nThis reveals a fundamental limitation of the model in interpreting the experimental data. The observed shift in half-activation voltage, $\\Delta V_{1/2} = +7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, must be explained by a change in another parameter. We examine the expression for $V_{1/2}$:\n$$ V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{zF} $$\nThe change in $V_{1/2}$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = V_{1/2, mut} - V_{1/2, wt} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0, mut}}{z_{mut}F} - \\frac{\\Delta G_{0, wt}}{z_{wt}F} $$\nSince we have established that $z_{mut} = z_{wt} = z$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0, mut} - \\Delta G_{0, wt}}{zF} = \\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G_{0})}{zF} $$\nThus, within the confines of this model, the observed shift $\\Delta V_{1/2}$ is entirely attributed to a change in the voltage-independent component of the free energy, $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{0})$, not to a change in gating charge. The mutation has altered the intrinsic stability of the activated state relative to the resting state, but not the amount of charge that moves during the transition.\n\nThe fundamental limitation is therefore that the model's structure itself precludes the possibility of a non-zero $\\Delta z$ if $\\Delta k = 0$. Any attempt to infer $\\Delta z$ from $\\Delta V_{1/2}$ under this condition is invalid. The observation of an unchanged slope factor forces the interpretation that the mutation's effect is purely on the chemical component of the free energy ($\\Delta G_0$), not on the electrical component ($z$). A more complex model, such as one with more states or where $z$ itself is voltage-dependent, would be required to assign a non-zero $\\Delta z$ from such data. However, based strictly on the provided model, the estimate for the change in gating charge is unequivocally zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2742323"}, {"introduction": "Pharmacology is a cornerstone of neuroscience, providing essential tools to dissect complex biological systems.

All necessary physical parameters and assumptions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe task is to determine the relative peak current, $I/I_0$, in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The total current arises from two distinct populations of sodium channels: tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-s) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-r).\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a binding site by a ligand at equilibrium. Consider a one-to-one reversible binding reaction between a receptor, $R$, and a ligand, $L$, to form a complex, $RL$:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe rates of the forward (binding) and reverse (unbinding) reactions are governed by the rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, respectively. At equilibrium, the rate of formation of the complex equals the rate of its dissociation:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} [R][L] = k_{\\mathrm{off}} [RL] $$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the off-rate constant to the on-rate constant, which from the equilibrium condition above is also equal to the product of the concentrations of free reactants divided by the concentration of the complex:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors, $[R]$, and bound receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL] $$\nFrom the definition of $K_D$, we can express the concentration of free receptors as:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for the total receptor concentration gives:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]} + [RL] = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right) $$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ we derived:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right)} = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]} $$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which represents the fractional occupancy at equilibrium.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the problem. The ligand is TTX, so $[L] = [\\mathrm{TTX}]$. The problem states that TTX-bound channels are non-conducting. Therefore, the current contributed by a population of channels is proportional to the fraction of channels that are *unbound*. The fraction of unbound channels is $(1 - \\theta)$.\n\nThe total control current, $I_0$, is the sum of currents from the sensitive and resistant populations in the absence of TTX:\n$$ I_0 = I_{0,s} + I_{0,r} $$\nThe problem provides the fractional contributions: $I_{0,s} = f_s I_0$ and $I_{0,r} = f_r I_0$, with $f_s = 0.7$ and $f_r = 0.3$.\n\nIn the presence of $[\\mathrm{TTX}]$, the current from each population is reduced.
