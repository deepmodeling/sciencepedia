It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of electrophysiology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.

First, we must derive the expression for single-channel current and compute its value. Second, we must provide a conceptual explanation of series resistance artifact.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Single-Channel Current\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definitions provided. Ohm's law for a linear resistor states that the voltage drop ($V_{\\text{drop}}$) across a resistor is proportional to the current ($I$) flowing through it and its resistance ($R$):\n$$V_{\\text{drop}} = I \\cdot R$$\nElectrical conductance ($g$) is defined as the reciprocal of resistance:\n$$g = \\frac{1}{R}$$\nBy substituting $R = 1/g$ into Ohm's law, we can express the current in terms of conductance and voltage drop:\n$$V_{\\text{drop}} = I \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{g}\\right)$$\n$$I = g \\cdot V_{\\text{drop}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the ion channel acts as a selective pathway, and the effective voltage drop driving the ionic current is the difference between the membrane potential ($V$) and the ion's reversal potential, in this case, the potassium reversal potential ($E_K$). This potential difference is the electrochemical driving force.\n$$V_{\\text{drop}} = V - E_K$$\nSubstituting this expression for the driving force into our equation for the current, and using the conventional symbol $i$ for a single-channel current and $g$ for single-channel conductance, we arrive at the general expression for the single-channel current:\n$$i = g(V - E_K)$$\nThis is the required general expression, often referred to as the microscopic Ohm's law for an ion channel.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this current for the given parameters:\nSingle-channel conductance, $g = 250 \\text{ pS}$\nMembrane potential, $V = +40 \\text{ mV}$\nPotassium reversal potential, $E_K = -90 \\text{ mV}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, we must convert all values to base SI units (Siemens, Volts, Amperes).\n$$g = 250 \\text{ pS} = 250 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}$$\n$$V = +40 \\text{ mV} = 40 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\n$$E_K = -90 \\text{ mV} = -90 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the driving force, $V - E_K$:\n$$V - E_K = (40 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) - (-90 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) = (40 + 90) \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V} = 130 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\nNow, calculate the current, $i$:\n$$i = g(V - E_K) = (250 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot (130 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V})$$\n$$i = (250 \\cdot 130) \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A}$$\n$$i = 32500 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A} = 32.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoamperes (pA), where $1 \\text{ pA} = 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$.\n$$i = 32.5 \\text{ pA}$$\nThe value $32.5$ has three significant figures, which satisfies the rounding requirement.\n\nPart 2: Explanation of Series Resistance Bias\n\nAn ideal voltage-clamp experiment assumes that the command voltage ($V_{\\text{cmd}}$) set by the experimenter is identical to the true membrane potential ($V_m$). However, any real experimental setup has a non-zero access or series resistance, $R_s$, between the voltage-clamp amplifier and the cell membrane. This resistance is in series with the membrane resistance (or, for a single channel, the channel resistance $R_{ch} = 1/g$).\n\nWhen an ionic current, $I$, flows across the membrane, it must also flow through this series resistance. This creates a voltage drop across $R_s$ equal to $I \\cdot R_s$. Consequently, the true membrane potential, $V_m$, is not equal to the command voltage. The relationship is given by:\n$$V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}} - I \\cdot R_s$$\nThe term $I \\cdot R_s$ represents the voltage-clamp error.\n\nAn experimenter who naively assumes $V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}}$ will misinterpret their data. They measure the current $I$ and plot it against $V_{\\text{cmd}}$, believing this represents the true current-voltage relationship of the channel. However, the current $I$ is actually governed by the true membrane potential, $V_m$.\n\nFor an outward potassium current, the flow of positive K$^+$ ions is out of the cell. By convention, this outward current $I$ is positive ($I > 0$). Therefore, the voltage drop $I \\cdot R_s$ is also positive. This means:\n$$V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}} - I \\cdot R_s < V_{\\text{cmd}}$$\nThe true membrane potential is less depolarized (or more hyperpolarized) than the command voltage. The experimenter thinks they are measuring the current at $V_{\\text{cmd}}$ but are actually measuring the current corresponding to the smaller driving force at $V_m$. As a result, the measured current at a given $V_{\\text{cmd}}$ is an **underestimate** of the current that would truly flow if the membrane were perfectly clamped to $V_{\\text{cmd}}$. This biases the apparent current-voltage curve, making the conductance seem smaller than it is, especially at large voltages where currents are large.\n\nThe bias becomes appreciable when the voltage error, $I \\cdot R_s$, is a significant fraction of the overall potential scale of interest, such as the driving force $V_m - E_K$. This condition is met when the product $I \\cdot R_s$ is large. This occurs when the current $I$ is large (i.e., for channels with large conductance like BK channels, or at large driving potentials) and/or when the series resistance $R_s$ itself is large (due to factors like a suboptimal patch-clamp pipette).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{32.5}$$", "id": "2702462"}, {"introduction": "Moving from ion permeation to channel regulation, we now focus on the \"calcium-activated\" nature of these proteins.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical chemistry, specifically the modeling of cooperative ligand-receptor binding. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: a derivation, a calculation, and an interpretation, based on the Hill model for cooperative binding.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Open Probability $P_{o}$\n\nThe problem postulates a simplified, cooperative binding reaction for the activation of the channel. Let the CaM-channel complex be the receptor, $R$, and the calcium ion be the ligand, $L$ (where $[L]$ corresponds to $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$). The binding of $n$ ligands to the receptor is modeled as a single-step cooperative process at equilibrium:\n$$ R + nL \\rightleftharpoons RL_n $$\nHere, $R$ represents the closed state of the channel complex, and $RL_n$ represents the open state. According to the law of mass action, the macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_{diss}$, for this reaction is given by:\n$$ K_{diss} = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{[RL_n]} $$\nThe problem states that the steady-state open probability, $P_o$, is equivalent to the fractional occupancy of the receptor by the ligand. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$ P_o = \\theta = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R] + [RL_n]} $$\nTo express $P_o$ in terms of the ligand concentration $[L]$, we first rearrange the expression for the dissociation constant to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_{diss} [RL_n]}{[L]^n} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $P_o$:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{[RL_n]}{\\left( \\frac{K_{diss} [RL_n]}{[L]^n} \\right) + [RL_n]} $$\nThe term $[RL_n]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator, so it can be cancelled:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{diss}}{[L]^n} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]^n$ yields the expression in a more common form:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_{diss} + [L]^n} $$\nThe problem defines an \"effective dissociation constant\" $K_d$. In the context of the Hill equation, $K_d$ is specifically defined as the ligand concentration that produces half-maximal occupancy, i.e., $P_o = 0.5$ when $[L]=K_d$. Let us enforce this definition on our derived expression. Setting $[L] = K_d$ and $P_o = 1/2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_d^n}{K_{diss} + K_d^n} $$\n$$ K_{diss} + K_d^n = 2 K_d^n $$\n$$ K_{diss} = K_d^n $$\nThis result connects the macroscopic dissociation constant $K_{diss}$ to the half-occupancy constant $K_d$. Substituting $K_d^n$ for $K_{diss}$ in our expression for $P_o$ gives the final form of the Hill equation. Using the specific notation for the calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, we have:\n$$ P_o([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^n}{K_d^n + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^n} $$\nThis is the required analytical dependence of $P_o$ on $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, $K_d$, and $n$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $P_{o}$\n\nWe are given the parameters $K_d = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $n=4$. We will use the derived formula to calculate $P_o$ for the three specified calcium concentrations. The expression can be conveniently rewritten as:\n$$ P_o([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d}\\right)^n} $$\n\nCase (i): $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = 0.2~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio of concentrations is $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d} = \\frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(0.4)^4}{1 + (0.4)^4} = \\frac{0.0256}{1 + 0.0256} = \\frac{0.0256}{1.0256} \\approx 0.02496099... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $P_o = 0.02496$.\n\nCase (ii): $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio of concentrations is $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(1)^4}{1 + (1)^4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nAs required by the definition of $K_d$, the open probability is exactly $0.5$. To four significant figures, this is $0.5000$.\n\nCase (iii): $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = 2~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio of concentrations is $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d} = \\frac{2}{0.5} = 4$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(4)^4}{1 + (4)^4} = \\frac{256}{1 + 256} = \\frac{256}{257} \\approx 0.9961089... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $P_o = 0.9961$.\n\nPart 3: Interpretation of the Hill Coefficient $n=4$\n\nThe Hill coefficient, $n$, quantifies the degree of cooperativity in a binding process.\n- If $n=1$, the binding is non-cooperative.\n- If $n > 1$, the binding exhibits positive cooperativity, meaning the binding of one ligand molecule increases the affinity of the receptor for subsequent ligand molecules.\n- If $0 < n < 1$, the binding exhibits negative cooperativity.\n\nIn this problem, $n=4$. This value, being significantly greater than $1$, indicates strong positive cooperativity. Physically, this means that the binding of the first calcium ion to the CaM-channel complex substantially promotes the binding of the subsequent calcium ions. The value $n=4$ corresponds to the fact that calmodulin has four calcium-binding sites (EF-hands). While the Hill model is a phenomenological simplification and does not imply a literal one-step binding of four ions, it effectively describes a system where the channel is very unlikely to open until multiple sites are occupied. This high cooperativity creates a steep, switch-like activation profile. A small change in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ around the $K_d$ value results in a large change in the channel's open probability, allowing the channel to function as a sensitive and effective detector of intracellular calcium transients.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02496 & 0.5000 & 0.9961 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2702429"}, {"introduction": "To experimentally probe the calcium-dependent properties explored in the previous practice, a scientist must first be able to prepare solutions with precise, stable concentrations of free calcium.

The affinity of EGTA for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is highly dependent on pH because the carboxylate groups of EGTA can be protonated. As pH decreases, protonation increases, which prevents the carboxylates from coordinating the calcium ion, thereby drastically increasing the apparent $K_d$ (i.e., lowering the affinity).
