It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and requires the derivation of a fundamental relationship from first principles.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the maximum gating charge, $Q_{max}$, displaced during the full activation of a single voltage-gated ion channel. The givens are the number of contributing basic residues, $n$; the elementary charge, $q$; and the effective fraction of the transmembrane electric field traversed by each charge, $\\delta$.\n\nThe gating current, $I_g(t)$, measured in an external circuit arises from the movement of charges within the transmembrane electric field. To a first approximation, the cell membrane can be modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor. From electrostatics, the movement of a point charge $q_i$ by a distance $\\Delta x_i$ perpendicular to the capacitor plates (of separation $d$) induces a charge flow, $\\Delta Q_i$, in the external circuit given by:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_i = q_i \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{d}\n$$\nThis induced charge is the quantity measured experimentally as gating charge.\n\nThe problem defines $\\delta$ as the \"effective fraction of the transmembrane electric field traversed\" by each charge. In the context of a constant electric field across the membrane, this is equivalent to the fraction of the membrane's physical thickness, $d$, that each charge effectively traverses. Thus, we can write the average displacement fraction for each charge as $\\frac{\\Delta x}{d} = \\delta$.\n\nThe voltage sensor contains $n$ basic residues, each carrying an elementary charge $+q$. We assume that upon a saturating depolarization, which causes the channel to move from its fully resting state to its fully activated state, all $n$ of these residues contribute to the gating charge.\n\nFor a single one of these residues, its contribution to the total measured gating charge, let us call it $Q_{i}$, is:\n$$\nQ_i = q \\cdot \\delta\n$$\nThis assumes that each contributing charge is monovalent (charge of $1q$) and traverses the same effective fraction $\\delta$ of the field.\n\nThe total gating charge, $Q_{max}$, is the sum of the contributions from all $n$ independent charges. Since a \"saturating\" step is applied to \"fully activate\" the sensor, we are measuring the charge movement corresponding to the complete conformational change. Therefore, we sum the contributions from all $n$ residues:\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q \\delta)\n$$\nAs $q$ and $\\delta$ are treated as constants for all contributing charges in this model, the summation simplifies to:\n$$\nQ_{max} = n \\delta q\n$$\nThis is the compact expression for the total gating charge displacement. The definition provided in the problem, $Q_{max} = \\int I_g(t) dt$, establishes the connection between this theoretical quantity and the experimentally measured value. This derivation directly links the microscopic charge movements to the macroscopic measurement.\n\nThis derivation relies on several minimal biophysical assumptions:\n$1$. The $n$ contributing S4 segment charges move independently of each other. Electrostatic interactions between the charges are neglected.\n$2$. Each of the $n$ charges is identical and carries a single elementary charge, $+q$.\n$3$. The movement of each charge during activation results in the same average effective displacement, characterized by the parameter $\\delta$.\n$4$. The gating process can be modeled as a two-state transition between a fully resting and a fully activated conformation, and the measurement captures the charge movement for this complete transition.\n$5$. The membrane acts as a simple capacitor with a uniform electric field, allowing the charge displacement to be linearly proportional to the fractional distance moved.\n\nRegarding the influence of auxiliary subunits: These are proteins that co-assemble with the main pore-forming subunit and modulate its function.\n-   Effect on $n$: The number of gating charges, $n$, is determined by the primary amino acid sequence of the S4 segment in the pore-forming subunit. It is a fixed, genetically encoded integer. Auxiliary subunits do not alter the primary structure of the pore-forming subunit and therefore are **not expected to change $n$**.\n-   Effect on $\\delta$: The effective displacement, $\\delta$, is a measure of the extent and geometry of the S4 segment's conformational change relative to the electric field. This physical movement occurs within a complex protein environment. Auxiliary subunits can bind to the voltage-sensing domains and alter their stability, structure, or the pathway of their conformational change. By modifying the protein landscape, an auxiliary subunit can change the start and end points of the S4 movement or its orientation, thereby **altering the value of $\\delta$**. Consequently, the total gating charge $Q_{max}$ can be modulated by auxiliary subunits primarily through changes in $\\delta$, not $n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n \\delta q}\n$$", "id": "2731449"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the core structure of the pore-forming subunit, channel function is fine-tuned by auxiliary proteins that modulate gating.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe equilibrium between the closed ($C$) and open ($O$) states of the channel is described by the ratio of their probabilities, which is governed by the molar Gibbs free energy difference, $\\Delta G_{oc}(V) = G_o(V) - G_c(V)$. From fundamental statistical mechanics, we have the relation:\n$$ \\frac{P_o}{P_c} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{oc}(V)}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $P_o$ and $P_c$ are the open and closed probabilities, respectively, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Since the channel must be in one of these two states, $P_o + P_c = 1$, which implies $P_c = 1 - P_o$. Substituting this into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{P_o}{1 - P_o} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{oc}(V)}{RT}\\right) $$\nSolving for the open probability $P_o$ yields the Boltzmann function:\n$$ P_o(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{oc}(V)}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThe half-activation voltage, $V_{1/2}$, is defined as the voltage at which $P_o(V_{1/2}) = 1/2$. Substituting this into the expression for $P_o(V)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{oc}(V_{1/2})}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThis condition is satisfied only when the argument of the exponential function is zero, as $\\exp(0) = 1$. Therefore, at the half-activation voltage, the free energy difference between the open and closed states must be zero:\n$$ \\Delta G_{oc}(V_{1/2}) = 0 $$\nNote that this condition is independent of temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the free energy difference $\\Delta G_{oc}(V)$ is composed of a voltage-independent intrinsic component, which we shall call $\\Delta G_0$, and a voltage-dependent component that is linear in $V$. The work done to move an effective gating charge $z_g$ across the membrane potential $V$ on a molar basis is $-z_g F V$. The negative sign indicates that a positive potential $V$ favors the open state if $z_g$ is positive. Thus, the total free energy difference is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{oc}(V) = \\Delta G_0 - z_g F V $$\nApplying the condition $\\Delta G_{oc}(V_{1/2}) = 0$, we find:\n$$ \\Delta G_0 - z_g F V_{1/2} = 0 $$\nSolving for $V_{1/2}$ gives a general expression:\n$$ V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{z_g F} $$\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the two cases described in the problem.\n\nCase 1: Channel without the auxiliary subunit (superscript $(0)$).\nThe intrinsic free energy difference is $\\Delta G_0$. The half-activation voltage is:\n$$ V_{1/2}^{(0)} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{z_g F} $$\n\nCase 2: Channel with the bound auxiliary subunit (superscript $(\\beta)$).\nThe subunit binding stabilizes the open state by an amount $\\Delta\\Delta G > 0$. This means the free energy of the open state is lowered, which corresponds to a reduction in the free energy *difference* $\\Delta G_{oc}$. The new intrinsic free energy difference, $\\Delta G_0^{(\\beta)}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta G_0^{(\\beta)} = \\Delta G_0 - \\Delta\\Delta G $$\nThe gating charge $z_g$ is assumed to be unchanged. The new half-activation voltage, $V_{1/2}^{(\\beta)}$, is:\n$$ V_{1/2}^{(\\beta)} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0^{(\\beta)}}{z_g F} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\Delta\\Delta G}{z_g F} $$\n\nThe shift in the half-activation voltage, $\\Delta V_{1/2}$, is defined as $V_{1/2}^{(\\beta)} - V_{1/2}^{(0)}$.\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = V_{1/2}^{(\\beta)} - V_{1/2}^{(0)} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\Delta\\Delta G}{z_g F}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0}{z_g F}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\Delta\\Delta G - \\Delta G_0}{z_g F} $$\nThis simplifies to the final symbolic expression:\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = -\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G}{z_g F} $$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of this shift using the provided data.\n- $\\Delta\\Delta G = 3.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $z_g = 3.2$\n- $F = 96{,}485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = -\\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{3.2 \\times 96{,}485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} = -\\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{3}}{308752}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}} $$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}}$ is, by definition, a Volt ($\\mathrm{V}$).\n$$ \\Delta V_{1/2} \\approx -0.00971653\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$).

In other words, the IFM motif and the pore site favorably interact with each other in the inactivated state, and this interaction contributes to the overall stability of the inactivated conformation. Disrupting this interaction (via mutations) is energetically costly, and the magnitude of this cost is precisely the interaction energy we have calculated. The fact that the double mutant $V_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{AB}}$ is much closer to $V_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ than $V_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{A}}$ is, demonstrates a compensatory effect, which is characteristic of interacting sites. The mutation at site B partially rescues the function lost by the mutation at site A, a hallmark of a specific physical interaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-10.52}$$", "id": "2731488"}]}
