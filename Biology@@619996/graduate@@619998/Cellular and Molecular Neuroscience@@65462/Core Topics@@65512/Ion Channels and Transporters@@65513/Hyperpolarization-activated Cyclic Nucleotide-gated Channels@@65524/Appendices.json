Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe equilibrium between the closed ($C$) and open ($O$) states of the channel is described by the equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{[\\text{O}]}{[\\text{C}]} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G(V)$ is the free energy difference between the open and closed states, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe probability of finding the channel in the open state, $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(V)$, is given by:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{O}}(V) = \\frac{[\\text{O}]}{[\\text{C}] + [\\text{O}]} = \\frac{\\frac{[\\text{O}]}{[\\text{C}]}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{O}]}{[\\text{C}]}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{1 + K_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{O}}(V) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_{B}T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{O}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{k_{B}T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the voltage-dependent free energy is $\\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} + z\\,q\\,V$.

Let $k_{old}$ correspond to $T_{old} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $k_{new}$ correspond to $T_{new} = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$. From the relation $k = \\frac{k_{B}T}{z\\,q}$, we see that $k$ is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. We can therefore write a ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{new}}{k_{old}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{B}T_{new}}{z\\,q}}{\\frac{k_{B}T_{old}}{z\\,q}} = \\frac{T_{new}}{T_{old}}\n$$\nSolving for $k_{new}$:\n$$\nk_{new} = k_{old} \\left(\\frac{T_{new}}{T_{old}}\\right) = (8\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\left(\\frac{310\\ \\mathrm{K}}{300\\ \\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_{new} = 8 \\times \\frac{31}{30}\\ \\mathrm{mV} = \\frac{124}{15}\\ \\mathrm{mV} \\approx 8.2666... \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $k_{new} = 8.267\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the value for $z$ and the predicted value for $k$ at $310\\ \\mathrm{K}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.232 & 8.267 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2717042"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to real-world measurements requires thoughtful experimental design.

The goals are measurable and objective. The constraints are based on biophysical laws and properties of ion channels.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities that would prevent a rigorous analysis. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will proceed by analyzing each option.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe optimal protocol must satisfy all three stated goals. We will evaluate each option against these goals.\n\n**Goal (i): Isolation of $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$**\nThis requires a pharmacological cocktail to block other voltage-gated ion channels that could contaminate the recording. Key contaminants in the hyperpolarizing range include inward-rectifier potassium (Kir) currents. Other major currents from voltage-gated sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}_{\\mathrm{V}}$), potassium ($\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{V}}$), and calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{V}}$) channels must also be eliminated.\n\n**Goal (ii): Quantify Activation via Tail-Currents**\nThis requires a specific voltage protocol:\n1.  A holding potential where HCN channels are mostly closed (deactivated), i.e., at a depolarized potential relative to their activation range, typically near or positive to $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n2.  A series of long-duration hyperpolarizing \"prepulses\" to various test potentials to allow the slow activation of $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$ to approach steady state. The duration must be on the order of seconds.\n3.  A step to a common \"tail potential\". This potential should provide a large and consistent driving force ($V - E_h$) to generate a robust and measurable tail current, a snapshot of the activation level achieved during the prepulse. A good tail potential is one significantly hyperpolarized from $E_h$ (around $-30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\n\n**Goal (iii): Accurate Leak Subtraction**\nThe method must remove the linear ohmic leak current without artifactually altering the non-linear, time-dependent $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$. Standard P/N protocols, which assume linearity of all conductances for small voltage steps around the holding potential, are problematic for $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$ because HCN channels can be partially active at typical holding potentials, and their gating is non-linear. The gold-standard method is digital subtraction of currents recorded in the presence of a highly specific channel blocker.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Isolation:** The external solution includes tetrodotoxin (TTX) for $\\mathrm{Na}_{\\mathrm{V}}$ channels, tetraethylammonium (TEA) and $4$-aminopyridine ($4$-AP) for $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{V}}$ channels, $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ for $\\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{V}}$ channels, and importantly, $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ to suppress Kir channels. This is an excellent and comprehensive blocker cocktail that effectively isolates $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$. `Goal (i) is met.`\n- **Protocol:** The cell is held at $-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, where HCN channels are largely deactivated. The hyperpolarizing prepulses ($-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-135\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) for a duration of $2.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ are appropriate for achieving near steady-state activation of the slow $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$. The protocol correctly employs a subsequent step to a common tail potential ($-40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). While the driving force at $-40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is small (ca. $(-40 - (-30)) = -10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), which may result in a low signal-to-noise ratio, the protocol is methodologically sound. `Goal (ii) is met.`\n- **Leak Subtraction:** The protocol uses subtraction of traces recorded after application of the selective HCN channel blocker ZD$7288$. This is the most accurate and reliable method, as it isolates precisely the ZD$7288$-sensitive current ($I_{\\mathrm{h}}$) without making assumptions about linearity or distorting kinetics. `Goal (iii) is met.`\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option describes a robust, state-of-the-art protocol that correctly addresses all three experimental goals.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Isolation:** \"No channel blockers\". This is a critical failure. The recorded currents would be a mixture of numerous larger and faster currents ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$), completely masking the relatively small and slow $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$. `Goal (i) is not met.`\n- **Protocol:** Holding at $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ where $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$ is already substantially active, followed by *depolarizing* steps. This is a protocol to study deactivation, not activation. `Goal (ii) is not met.`\n- **Leak Subtraction:** An online P/$4$ protocol with hyperpolarizing pulses from a holding potential of $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Since HCN channels are open at $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the small hyperpolarizing P/$4$ pulses will themselves modulate $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$, leading to over-subtraction and gross distortion of the current kinetics. `Goal (iii) is not met.`\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol is flawed in every fundamental aspect.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Isolation:** \"TTX only\". This is insufficient. Voltage-gated $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels and, critically, inward-rectifier $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (Kir) channels, which are active in the same hyperpolarizing range as HCN channels, are not blocked. `Goal (i) is not met.`\n- **Protocol:** The prepulse duration of $300\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is too short to allow the slow $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$ to reach steady-state activation, leading to an inaccurate measurement of the voltage dependence. The tail potential of $-20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is very close to or even positive to $E_h$ ($-30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), resulting in a near-zero or outward driving force and thus a minuscule or unusable tail current. `Goal (ii) is not met.`\n- **Leak Subtraction:** The proposed method, extrapolating a linear leak from the steady-state current at the end of the pulse, is fundamentally invalid. The current at the end of a long hyperpolarizing pulse is the sum of the leak current and the activated $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$. Using this total current to define the leak constitutes circular reasoning and would lead to a nonsensical subtraction. `Goal (iii) is not met.`\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol contains multiple severe design flaws.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Isolation:** The cocktail (TTX, TEA, $4$-AP) lacks blockers for $\\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{V}}$ channels and, most importantly, for Kir channels (e.g., $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$). Kir currents would significantly contaminate the measurements during hyperpolarizing steps. `Goal (i) is not fully met.`\n- **Protocol:** The pulse protocol itself is well-designed. Holding at $-30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is good. A prepulse duration of $2\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is adequate. The tail potential of $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is excellent, as it provides a large inward driving force ($(-90 - (-30)) = -60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) for a high-quality tail current measurement. However, a good protocol is useless without proper current isolation.\n- **Leak Subtraction:** An online P/$4$ protocol with *depolarizing* pulses from a holding potential of $-30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Such pulses risk activating other low-threshold channels not fully blocked by the incomplete cocktail. Furthermore, the P/N method itself is generally inferior to blocker subtraction for slow, non-linear currents like $I_{\\mathrm{h}}$ as it can introduce artifacts. `Goal (iii) is not met.`\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. While parts of the voltage protocol are good, the incomplete pharmacological isolation and the suboptimal leak subtraction method make this protocol inferior to option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A represents the most rigorous and methodologically sound approach. It combines a comprehensive pharmacological isolation strategy, a correctly structured protocol for assessing activation, and the gold-standard method for leak subtraction.

No angles appear in this problem.\n\nImportant: All numeric answers are to be returned as floats without units, representing the ratios as defined above. The program must strictly adhere to the specified final output format.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It presents a well-posed biophysical modeling problem rooted in the standard Hodgkin-Huxley formalism as applied to cellular electrophysiology. The definitions are precise, the parameters are physically plausible, and the task is a direct application of calculus and algebraic manipulation. There are no scientific or logical inconsistencies. We will, therefore, proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\nThe total transmembrane ionic current, $I_{\\mathrm{total}}$, for the described isopotential compartment is the sum of the passive leak current, $I_L$, and the hyperpolarization-activated HCN current, $I_h$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{total}}(V) = I_L(V) + I_h(V) = g_L (V - E_L) + \\bar{g}_h m (V - E_h)$$\nHere, $V$ is the membrane potential, $g_L$ and $\\bar{g}_h$ are maximal conductances, $E_L$ and $E_h$ are reversal potentials, and $m$ is the voltage-dependent activation variable for the HCN current.\n\nThe small-signal input resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, at a holding potential $V_0$, is the reciprocal of the total slope conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{in}}$, evaluated at that potential.\n$$g_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{total}}}{dV} \\bigg|_{V=V_0} \\quad \\implies \\quad R_{\\mathrm{in}}(V_0) = \\left( g_{\\mathrm{in}} \\right)^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of two types of input resistance: instantaneous and steady-state, which differ in their treatment of the gating variable $m$.\n\nFirst, we derive the instantaneous input resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}$. In this case, the gating variable $m$ is considered fixed at its steady-state value corresponding to the holding potential $V_0$. Thus, $m = m_{\\infty}(V_0)$, where the steady-state activation function is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n$$m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)}$$\nThe total current for this condition is $I_{\\mathrm{total, inst}}(V) = g_L (V - E_L) + \\bar{g}_h m_{\\infty}(V_0) (V - E_h)$. The corresponding conductance is found by differentiation with respect to $V$:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{in,inst}} = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ g_L (V - E_L) + \\bar{g}_h m_{\\infty}(V_0) (V - E_h) \\right] = g_L + \\bar{g}_h m_{\\infty}(V_0)$$\nThe instantaneous input resistance is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(V_0) = \\frac{1}{g_L + \\bar{g}_h m_{\\infty}(V_0)}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the steady-state input resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in,ss}}$. Here, the gating variable $m$ is allowed to re-equilibrate to its new steady-state value for any given voltage $V$. We substitute $m = m_{\\infty}(V)$ into the total current equation before differentiating.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{total, ss}}(V) = g_L (V - E_L) + \\bar{g}_h m_{\\infty}(V) (V - E_h)$$\nThe differentiation of the $I_h$ term now requires the product rule:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{in,ss}} = \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{total, ss}}}{dV} = g_L + \\bar{g}_h \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ m_{\\infty}(V) (V - E_h) \\right]$$\n$$g_{\\mathrm{in,ss}} = g_L + \\bar{g}_h \\left[ \\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV}(V - E_h) + m_{\\infty}(V) \\cdot 1 \\right]$$\nThe derivative of the Boltzmann function is:\n$$\\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV} = \\frac{d}{dV}\\left(1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)\\right)^{-1} = -\\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)\\right)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} = -\\frac{m_{\\infty}(V)(1-m_{\\infty}(V))}{k}$$\nSubstituting this back and evaluating at $V = V_0$, we obtain the steady-state slope conductance:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{in,ss}}(V_0) = g_L + \\bar{g}_h \\left[ m_{\\infty}(V_0) - \\frac{m_{\\infty}(V_0)(1-m_{\\infty}(V_0))}{k}(V_0 - E_h) \\right]$$\nThe steady-state input resistance is its reciprocal:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,ss}}(V_0) = \\left( g_L + \\bar{g}_h \\left[ m_{\\infty}(V_0) - \\frac{m_{\\infty}(V_0)(1-m_{\\infty}(V_0))}{k}(V_0 - E_h) \\right] \\right)^{-1}$$\n\nThe task is to compute three ratios resulting from doubling the HCN conductance, $\\bar{g}_h \\to 2\\bar{g}_h$.\nLet $m_0 = m_{\\infty}(V_0)$. The ratio of instantaneous input resistances, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{inst}}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{inst}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(2\\bar{g}_h)}{R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(\\bar{g}_h)} = \\frac{1 / (g_L + 2\\bar{g}_h m_0)}{1 / (g_L + \\bar{g}_h m_0)} = \\frac{g_L + \\bar{g}_h m_0}{g_L + 2\\bar{g}_h m_0}$$\nLet $C_{ss} = m_0 - \\frac{m_0(1-m_0)}{k}(V_0 - E_h)$. The ratio of steady-state input resistances, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in,ss}}(2\\bar{g}_h)}{R_{\\mathrm{in,ss}}(\\bar{g}_h)} = \\frac{1 / (g_L + 2\\bar{g}_h C_{ss})}{1 / (g_L + \\bar{g}_h C_{ss})} = \\frac{g_L + \\bar{g}_h C_{ss}}{g_L + 2\\bar{g}_h C_{ss}}$$\nThe third ratio, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{EPSP}}$, concerns the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which is approximated as $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(V_0) I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$.\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{EPSP}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{peak}}(2\\bar{g}_h)}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{peak}}(\\bar{g}_h)} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(2\\bar{g}_h) I_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(\\bar{g}_h) I_{\\mathrm{peak}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(2\\bar{g}_h)}{R_{\\mathrm{in,inst}}(\\bar{g}_h)} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{inst}}$$\nThe ratio of EPSP peaks is therefore identical to the ratio of instantaneous input resistances.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by calculating $m_0$ and $C_{ss}$ for each parameter set, followed by the evaluation of the derived ratio formulas.
