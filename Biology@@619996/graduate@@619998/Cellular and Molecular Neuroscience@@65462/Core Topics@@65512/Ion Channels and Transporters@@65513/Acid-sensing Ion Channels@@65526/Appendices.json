It is a standard exercise in biophysical chemistry, requiring the derivation and application of the Hill equation.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe model presented describes a cooperative binding process that can be simplified to a single-step equilibrium reaction between the channel in its closed state, $C$, and $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ protons, $H^{+}$, to form the open state, $C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}$:\n$$C + n_{\\mathrm{H}} H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nHere, $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ represents the Hill coefficient, a measure of cooperativity.\n\nThe macroscopic dissociation constant for this reaction, which we will denote as $K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}$ to maintain consistency with standard notation where $K_d$ has units of concentration, is given by the law of mass action:\n$$K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{[C] [H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}{[C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}$$\nThe problem states that the steady-state open probability, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$, is equal to the fraction of channels with $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ protons bound. Let $[C]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [C] + [C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]$ be the total concentration of channels. Then:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\frac{[C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}{[C]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}{[C] + [C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}$$\nFrom the expression for $K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}$, we can write $[C] = \\frac{K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} [C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}{[H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$ yields:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\frac{[C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}{\\frac{K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} [C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}{[H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}} + [C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[C(H^{+})_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}]$ gives the Hill equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}{[H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}} + 1} = \\frac{[H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}{K_d^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} + [H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}$$\nThe constant $K_d$ is the proton concentration $[H^{+}]$ at which the response is half-maximal, also denoted as $K_{1/2}$. Thus, we write:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\frac{[H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}{K_{1/2}^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} + [H^{+}]^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}}$$\nThe problem states that the normalized current $I/I_{\\max}$ is proportional to $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$. Since both are dimensionless quantities ranging from $0$ to $1$, we take the proportionality constant to be $1$, so $I/I_{\\max} = P_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\n\nTo derive the required linear relationship, we rearrange the Hill equation.

The slope of this line is $m = -n_{\\mathrm{H}}$. Therefore, the Hill coefficient is the negative of the slope: $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = -m$.\n\nWe now apply this analysis to the provided data. Let $P = I/I_{\\max}$. We calculate the value of $Y = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P}{1 - P}\\right)$ for each given data point $(pH, P)$.\n\n1.

For $pH = 6.6$, $P = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n    $Y_2 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1/2}{1 - 1/2}\\right) = \\log_{10}(1) = 0$.\n    The transformed point is $(6.6, 0)$.\n\n3.  For $pH = 6.1$, $P = \\frac{10}{11}$:\n    $Y_3 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10/11}{1 - 10/11}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10/11}{1/11}\\right) = \\log_{10}(10) = 1$.\n    The transformed point is $(6.1, 1)$.\n\n4.  For $pH = 5.6$, $P = \\frac{100}{101}$:\n    $Y_4 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{100/101}{1 - 100/101}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{100/101}{1/101}\\right) = \\log_{10}(100) = 2$.\n    The transformed point is $(5.6, 2)$.\n\nWe have the following set of points for the linear relationship $(pH, Y)$:\n$(7.1, -1)$, $(6.6, 0)$, $(6.1, 1)$, $(5.6, 2)$.\n\nTo find the \"single best estimate\" of the slope, we note that these points are perfectly collinear. A simple check confirms this: the change in $pH$ between consecutive points is always $-0.5$, while the change in $Y$ is always $+1$. The slope $m$ can therefore be calculated exactly using any two points. For example, using points $1$ and $2$:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta Y}{\\Delta X} = \\frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{pH_2 - pH_1} = \\frac{0 - (-1)}{6.6 - 7.1} = \\frac{1}{-0.5} = -2$$\nThe slope of the Hill plot is $m = -2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Hill coefficient $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{H}} = -m = -(-2) = 2$$\nThe cooperativity (Hill) coefficient for this ASIC isoform is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2696064"}, {"introduction": "The function of an ion channel ultimately lies in its physiological or pathological impact, which arises from the ionic flux it permits.
