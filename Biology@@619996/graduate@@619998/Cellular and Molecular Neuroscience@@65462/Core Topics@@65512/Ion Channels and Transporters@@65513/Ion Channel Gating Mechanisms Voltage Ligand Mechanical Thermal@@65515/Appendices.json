The relationship between free energy, voltage, and the Boltzmann distribution is correctly stated. All necessary parameters ($z$, $V_{1/2}$, $T$) and physical constants ($F$, $R$) are provided. The definitions are clear and unambiguous. The tasks are well-posed and require a direct application of the stated principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nWe begin with the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the probabilities of the open state, $P_o$, and the closed state, $P_c$, to the molar Gibbs free-energy difference, $\\Delta G(V)$:\n$$ \\frac{P_o(V)}{P_c(V)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\nSince the channel must be in either the open or closed state, the probabilities sum to unity:\n$$ P_o(V) + P_c(V) = 1 \\implies P_c(V) = 1 - P_o(V) $$\nSubstituting this into the Boltzmann relation gives:\n$$ \\frac{P_o(V)}{1 - P_o(V)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{RT}\\right) $$\nSolving for the open probability $P_o(V)$ yields the familiar sigmoid function:\n$$ P_o(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThe total free-energy difference $\\Delta G(V)$ is composed of an intrinsic, voltage-independent part, $\\Delta G_0$, and a voltage-dependent part due to the movement of the gating charge. Assuming the movement of an effective positive gating charge $z$ outward across the membrane facilitates opening, the electrical work done *on the system* as it transitions from closed to open changes its free energy. The standard convention for this change is $\\Delta G_{elec} = -zFV$, where $V$ is the membrane potential (inside relative to outside). Therefore, the total free-energy difference is:\n$$ \\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_0 - zFV $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P_o(V)$:\n$$ P_o(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - zFV}{RT}\\right)} $$\n\n**Part 1: Determination of $\\Delta G_0$**\nWe are given that at the half-activation voltage, $V_{1/2}$, the open probability is $P_o(V_{1/2}) = 0.5$. Applying this condition to our equation for $P_o(V)$:\n$$ 0.5 = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - zFV_{1/2}}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThis equation holds if and only if the denominator is equal to $2$, which implies that the exponential term must be equal to $1$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - zFV_{1/2}}{RT}\\right) = 1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - zFV_{1/2}}{RT} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_0 - zFV_{1/2} = 0 $$\nThus, we find a direct relationship for the intrinsic free-energy difference:\n$$ \\Delta G_0 = zFV_{1/2} $$\nWe now substitute the given values, ensuring consistent SI units.
