The theoretical framework is the constant-field electrodiffusion model, which leads to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equations.\n\nThe reversal potential, $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, is defined as the membrane potential, $V_m$, at which the total ionic current across the membrane is zero.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no apparent flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Analysis of Observations\n\nThe problem is to distinguish between effects on permeation and effects on gating. These two aspects of channel function are, to a first approximation, separable.\n\n1.  **Permeation Properties**: Permeation is governed by the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$, and the ionic selectivity, which determines the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. The problem provides the fundamental relation $i = \\gamma \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}\\right)$. The experiment is conducted at a fixed membrane potential $V$.\n    - Observation 1 states that the unitary current amplitude $i$ is unchanged.\n    - Observation 2 states that the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is unchanged.\n    - Given that $V$, $i$, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are all constant, the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$ must also be constant.\n    - Since both $\\gamma$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are unchanged, we must conclude that the lipid agonist does **not** modify the permeation properties of the channel's open pore.\n\n2.  **Gating Properties**: Gating refers to the conformational transitions between the channel's open and closed states. The observations related to gating are:\n    - (3) Unchanged dwell-time distributions for within-burst fast gating.\n    - (4) Increased mean burst duration.\n    - (5) More openings per burst.\n    - (6) Decreased frequency of long closed intervals.\n\n    These observations can be interpreted using a kinetic model that includes bursting. A minimal model for bursting involves at least three states, often configured as:\n    $$ C_{s} \\ \\underset{k_{sb}}{\\overset{k_{bs}}{\\rightleftarrows}} \\ [C_{f} \\ \\underset{k_{oc}}{\\overset{k_{co}}{\\rightleftarrows}} \\ O] $$\n    Here, $O$ is the open state, $C_f$ is a short-lived (\"flickery\") closed state, and $C_s$ is a long-lived (\"silent\") closed state. A \"burst\" is defined as a period during which the channel transitions rapidly between the states in the square brackets, which form the bursting aggregate $B = \\{C_f, O\\}$, before entering the long-lived silent state $C_s$.\n\n    - The mean duration of a burst, $\\langle T_b \\rangle$, is the average time the channel spends in the aggregate state $B$ before exiting to $C_s$. In this simple model, this is primarily determined by the rate constant $k_{bs}$ such that $\\langle T_b \\rangle \\approx 1/k_{bs}$. Observation (4), that the mean burst duration increases, implies that the rate of leaving the bursting mode, $k_{bs}$, must **decrease**.\n    - Observation (6), that long closed intervals between bursts decrease in frequency, means the channel spends less time, on average, in the silent state $C_s$. The mean duration of the silent state is $1/k_{sb}$. A decrease in the duration or frequency of these silent periods implies that the rate of exit from this state, $k_{sb}$, must **increase**.\n    - The combined effect of a decrease in $k_{bs}$ and an increase in $k_{sb}$ is a shift in the gating equilibrium $C_s \\leftrightarrow B$ towards the bursting aggregate $B$. The lipid agonist stabilizes the bursting mode of the channel relative to the long-lived closed state.\n    - Observation (3), that within-burst dwell times are unchanged, implies that the rates governing the fast flickering within the burst, $k_{co}$ and $k_{oc}$, are not affected by the lipid.\n    - Observation (5), more openings per burst, is a direct consequence of the longer burst duration. If the channel stays in the bursting aggregate $B$ for a longer time and the flickering rates within $B$ are unchanged, it will naturally have more opportunities to visit the open state $O$ before the burst terminates.\n\n    **Conclusion**: The lipid agonist is a gating modulator. It specifically alters the rates of transition between long-lived closed states and the bursting aggregate of states, thereby stabilizing the active, bursting conformation of the channel. It does not affect permeation.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The lipid primarily stabilizes the bursting aggregate by shifting gating equilibria without altering permeation. A minimal kinetic scheme is...**\nThis option's primary assertion is that the lipid modifies gating, not permeation. This aligns perfectly with the conclusion from the unchanged $i$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. The proposed kinetic scheme is appropriate for describing bursting. The explanation that the lipid reduces $k_{bs}$ and/or increases $k_{sb}$ correctly accounts for the increased mean burst duration ($\\langle T_b \\rangle \\approx 1/k_{bs}$) and the increased frequency of bursts (or decreased duration of silent periods, governed by $1/k_{sb}$). The reasoning provided is entirely consistent with all experimental data and fundamental biophysical principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The lipid primarily increases permeation by raising the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$, but the apparent unitary current amplitude $i$ remains unchanged because the open probability increases and compensates for the conductance change under voltage clamp.**\nThis option claims the primary effect is on permeation ($\\gamma$ increases). This is in direct contradiction to the observation that the unitary current amplitude $i$ is unchanged. In a single-channel recording, $i$ is the measured current flowing through one open channel. If $\\gamma$ were to increase, $i$ would necessarily increase since $i = \\gamma (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ and $V$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are fixed. The proposed \"compensation\" by open probability is nonsensical for unitary current amplitude; open probability affects the macroscopic average current, not the amplitude of a single channel's current step.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The lipid introduces a new high-conductance open state that increases the time spent in the open conformation, thereby lengthening bursts. A compatible scheme is...**\nThis option proposes a mechanism involving a new open state $O_2$ with a higher conductance, $\\gamma_2 > \\gamma_1$. If the channel were to populate this state, single-channel recordings would show a second, larger current level corresponding to $\\gamma_2$. The problem explicitly states that the unitary current amplitude $i$ is *unchanged*. This observation directly refutes the existence of a populated higher-conductance state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The lipid alters ion selectivity within the pore, changing the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) weighted permeability ratio and thus $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, which secondarily stabilizes bursting by modifying the driving force.**\nThis option claims the lipid alters ion selectivity, which would manifest as a change in the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. This is in direct contradiction to observation (2), which states that $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is unchanged.

The first connects the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, to $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ at a given absolute temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\nThe second relates $\\Delta G^\\circ$ to the equilibrium constant, $K$, for the reaction:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\Delta G^\\circ$, we obtain:\n$$\n-RT \\ln K = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\nTo obtain the form of the van't Hoff equation, we rearrange this expression to solve for $\\ln K$:\n$$\n\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT} + \\frac{T\\Delta S^\\circ}{RT}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln K = \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R}\\right)\\frac{1}{T} + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}\n$$\nThis equation is linear in the form $y = mx + c$, where $y = \\ln K$ and $x = 1/T$. By direct comparison, we find the relationships between the slope ($m$) and intercept ($c$) of the van't Hoff plot and the thermodynamic parameters:\n$$\n\\text{Slope, } m = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Intercept, } c = \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical values for $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ for the closing reaction, open $\\rightleftharpoons$ closed. The problem provides the following data:\n- Slope $m = -5000\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Intercept $c = 12$\n- Ideal gas constant $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nUsing the relationship for the slope:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R} = -5000\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = 5000\\,\\mathrm{K} \\cdot R = 5000\\,\\mathrm{K} \\cdot (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) = 41570\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nAs requested, we express this in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = 41.57\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the relationship for the intercept:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R} = 12\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S^\\circ = 12 \\cdot R = 12 \\cdot (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) = 99.768\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\n\nThird, we provide qualitative reasoning based on these values. The closing reaction has a positive enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ > 0$), indicating it is an endothermic process that requires an input of heat. The closing reaction also has a positive entropy change ($\\Delta S^\\circ > 0$), suggesting an increase in the overall disorder of the system (channel plus solvent) upon closing. The spontaneity of the closing reaction is determined by $\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ$. The positive $\\Delta H^\\circ$ opposes closing, while the positive $\\Delta S^\\circ$ favors it through the $-T\\Delta S^\\circ$ term. When cooling the system, the temperature $T$ decreases. This diminishes the magnitude of the favorable entropic term, $-T\\Delta S^\\circ$. Consequently, $\\Delta G^\\circ$ for closing becomes more positive, making the closing reaction less spontaneous. This implies that the reverse reaction, opening, becomes more favorable. Thus, cooling shifts the equilibrium towards the open state, increasing the open probability of the channel. This is consistent with the biological function of TRPM8 as a cold-activated sensor.\n\nFourth, we determine the temperature $T^{\\ast}$ at which $K = 1$. This condition corresponds to an equal population of open and closed states. At this temperature, the standard Gibbs free energy change is zero, since $\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT^{\\ast}\\ln(K) = -RT^{\\ast}\\ln(1) = 0$. Using the linear equation for the van't Hoff plot derived and parameterized above:\n$$\n\\ln K = -\\frac{5000}{T} + 12\n$$\nWe set $\\ln K = 0$ and solve for $T=T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{5000\\,\\mathrm{K}}{T^{\\ast}} + 12\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{5000\\,\\mathrm{K}}{T^{\\ast}} = 12\n$$\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{5000}{12}\\,\\mathrm{K} = 416.666... \\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = 416.7\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{416.7}\n$$", "id": "2769243"}]}
