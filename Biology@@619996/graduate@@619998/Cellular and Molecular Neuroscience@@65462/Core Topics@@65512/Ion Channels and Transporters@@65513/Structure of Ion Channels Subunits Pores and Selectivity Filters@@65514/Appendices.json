We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the equilibrium occupancies of the selectivity filter by sodium ions, $P(\\mathrm{Na}^{+})$, and potassium ions, $P(\\mathrm{K}^{+})$, are equal. According to the principles of statistical thermodynamics, the probability of a binding site being occupied by an ionic species $i$ from a bulk solution is proportional to the activity of that species in the bulk, $a_i$, and a Boltzmann factor that depends on the standard free energy of transferring the ion from the bulk into the binding site, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(i)$.\n\nThe probability is given by the relation:\n$$\nP(i) \\propto a_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(i)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

Both these terms and the proportionality constant can be canceled from the equation, which simplifies the condition to equality of the Boltzmann factors:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+})}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+})}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nFor this equality to hold, the exponents must be equal. This leads to the conclusion that the standard free energies of transfer for the two ions must be identical:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+})\n$$\nThe problem provides a decomposition of the transfer free energy for species $i$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(i) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}(i) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(i) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{common}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}(i)$ is the dehydration penalty, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(i)$ is the ion–filter coordination energy, and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{common}}$ is a term independent of ion identity.\n\nSubstituting this decomposition into the equality of transfer free energies yields:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{common}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{common}}\n$$\nThe ion-independent term, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{common}}$, cancels from both sides:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+})\n$$\nWe are required to find the difference in coordination energies, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}} \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coord}}(\\mathrm{K}^{+})$.

C-type inactivation is a known process involving conformational changes of the selectivity filter.

Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe problem concerns the mechanism of C-type inactivation in potassium channels and its dependence on the concentration of the external permeant ion, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$.\n\n$1$. **Mechanism of C-type Inactivation**: C-type inactivation is a slow conformational change that occurs at the extracellular mouth of the channel pore, specifically involving the selectivity filter. This process is distinct from N-type inactivation, which involves a cytoplasmic particle blocking the pore. The C-type inactivated state is a non-conductive conformation where the selectivity filter is thought to be \"collapsed\" or constricted. The transition from the open, conductive state to the C-type inactivated state can be represented as a chemical reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Open (Conductive)} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{inact}}} \\text{Inactivated (Collapsed)}\n$$\nThe rate of this process is governed by the rate constant $k_{\\text{inact}}$. The observed inactivation time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$, is inversely related to this rate constant: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}} = 1/k_{\\text{inact}}$. Therefore, a slower rate of inactivation ($k_{\\text{inact}}$ decreases) corresponds to a longer time constant ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ increases).\n\n$2$. **Role of Permeant Ions**: The selectivity filter is a narrow structure lined by backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms that form a series of binding sites ($S0$–$S4$) for $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions. The conductive conformation of the filter is stabilized by the presence of $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions within these sites. These ions act as structural supports, maintaining the geometry required for rapid ion permeation. The \"foot-in-the-door\" model or ion-occupancy model of C-type inactivation posits that the transition to the collapsed, inactivated state is favored when one or more of these crucial binding sites becomes vacant. In essence, the presence of a $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ion in the outer part of the filter physically hinders the conformational change leading to inactivation.\n\n$3$. **Effect of $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$**: The occupancy of the ion-binding sites is governed by the law of mass action. The external-most sites, particularly $S0$ and $S1$, are in direct equilibrium with the extracellular solution. An increase in the extracellular potassium concentration, $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$, will, by the law of mass action, increase the probability that these outer sites are occupied by a $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ion.\n\n$4$. **Synthesis**:\n-   Increasing $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ from $2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ increases the occupancy of the outer binding sites of the selectivity filter.\n-   Higher occupancy of these sites provides greater stabilization to the open, conductive conformation of the filter.\n-   This increased stabilization makes the vacancy-dependent collapse into the C-type inactivated state less probable, or slower.\n-   Consequently, the rate of inactivation, $k_{\\text{inact}}$, decreases.\n-   Since $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}} = 1/k_{\\text{inact}}$, a decrease in $k_{\\text{inact}}$ results in an increase in $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$.\n\nTherefore, increasing extracellular $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentration is predicted to slow the rate of C-type inactivation, leading to an increase in the inactivation time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ increases (inactivation slows) because higher $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ raises occupancy of the outer selectivity filter sites ($S0$–$S1$), reducing the probability of vacancy-dependent filter collapse that underlies C-type inactivation.**\n-   This option correctly predicts that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ increases.\n-   The justification is entirely consistent with the first-principles derivation. It correctly links higher $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to increased occupancy of outer sites ($S0$–$S1$) and identifies this as the mechanism for stabilizing the filter against the \"vacancy-dependent collapse\" that constitutes C-type inactivation.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ decreases (inactivation accelerates) because higher $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ screens negative surface charges, facilitating narrowing of the outer pore and promoting the inactivated conformation.**\n-   This option incorrectly predicts that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ decreases.\n-   The proposed mechanism of charge screening is not the primary effect here, for two reasons. First, the problem explicitly states that total ionic strength is held constant, which minimizes changes in bulk electrostatic screening. Second, the dominant effect of the *permeant* ion $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ is its specific, high-affinity binding within the filter, not its non-specific screening effect as a cation. The specific binding stabilizes, rather than promotes, the open state.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No systematic change in $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ is expected because C-type inactivation is governed solely by movements at the intracellular activation gate and is insensitive to extracellular ion conditions.**\n-   This option incorrectly predicts no change in $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$.\n-   The justification is factually wrong. C-type inactivation is a phenomenon of the *extracellular* selectivity filter, not the *intracellular* activation gate. It is well-established that C-type inactivation is highly sensitive to the concentration and identity of ions in the extracellular solution.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ exhibits a biphasic dependence, decreasing at intermediate $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and increasing again at high $[ \\mathrm{K}^{+} ]_{\\mathrm{out}}$, because outer-site occupancy first destabilizes and then restabilizes the conductive filter via electrostatic repulsion among $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions.**\n-   This option predicts a biphasic effect, which contradicts the monotonic stabilizing effect described by the standard model.\n-   The justification that initial occupancy *destabilizes* the filter is contrary to the established understanding. While ion-ion repulsion is critical for high throughput *conduction*, the primary effect of ion occupancy on the *stability* of the filter structure is stabilization. A monotonic increase in stability, and thus a monotonic increase in $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$, is the expected behavior over this concentration range.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2755386"}, {"introduction": "Biophysical models of channel function, such as the ion-occupancy model of inactivation, gain their power from experimental validation.

The analysis will proceed by integrating the experimental observations with the provided fundamental bases.\n\n$1$. **Comparison of Condition $1$ and Condition $2$:**\nIn Condition $1$, with high external potassium ($[K^+]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 100$ mM), the accessibility of the engineered cysteine is negligible ($k_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\lt 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). According to assumption (ii), high $[K^+]$ stabilizes the conductive conformation of the filter. Therefore, we conclude that in the conductive conformation, the residue external to the filter is not accessible to the MTS reagent.\nIn Condition $2$, with very low external potassium ($[K^+]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 0.5$ mM), the accessibility increases dramatically ($k_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Assumption (iii) states that the removal of external $K^+$ favors a nonconductive, C-type inactivated conformation. This implies a direct correlation: the C-type inactivated state is the conformation in which the engineered residue is highly accessible. The role of $\\mathrm{NMG}^+$ is that of an inert substitute used to maintain constant ionic strength without stabilizing the conductive state, as per assumption (iv). The critical variable is the depletion of $K^+$.\n\n$2$. **Analysis of Condition $4$:**\nThis condition serves as a crucial control. Starting from the low-$K^+$ condition (Condition $2$), the addition of only $10$ mM $KCl$ (total $[K^+]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 10.5$ mM) is sufficient to drive the accessibility back to the baseline, low level. This demonstrates that the conformational equilibrium of the selectivity filter is highly sensitive to the external $K^+$ concentration. The presence of even a modest concentration of $K^+$ is enough to occupy the relevant external binding sites and shift the equilibrium back toward the conductive (inaccessible) state, reversing the effect of $K^+$ removal. This observation strongly contradicts any explanation based on simple, non-specific electrostatic screening, which would predict a much more graded response to the change in cation concentration.\n\n$3$. **Analysis of Condition $3$:**\nIn this condition, the channel is presumed to be predominantly in the C-type inactivated (accessible) state due to the low $[K^+]_{\\mathrm{o}}$. However, the addition of $10$ mM $\\mathrm{TEA}^+$ drastically reduces the modification rate. Assumption (v) states that $\\mathrm{TEA}^+$ is an external pore blocker. The fact that an external blocker prevents the MTS reagent from reaching the cysteine confirms that the access pathway for the MTS reagent is via the external mouth of the pore. The $\\mathrm{TEA}^+$ molecule physically occludes the entrance, sterically hindering the larger MTS reagent from reaching its target, even when the local filter structure is in the \"accessible\" conformation.\n\n$4$. **Synthesis of a Mechanistic Model:**\n- The selectivity filter can exist in at least two major conformational states: a conductive state and a C-type inactivated state.\n- The conductive state, stabilized by high external $[K^+]$, renders the residue just external to the filter inaccessible.\n- The C-type inactivated state, induced by low external $[K^+]$, involves a structural rearrangement that makes this same residue accessible.\n- This rearrangement must affect the external mouth of the pore, as the residue is located there and its accessibility is blocked by an external blocker, $\\mathrm{TEA}^+$.\n- The phenomenon of C-type inactivation is well-studied and is understood to involve a \"pinching\" or collapse of the inner part of the selectivity filter (making it non-conductive) coupled with a dilation or conformational change at the external entrance. This dilation at the external mouth would directly explain the increased exposure and accessibility of an adjacent residue.\n\nWith this model established, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n**A. The selectivity filter globally dilates at all binding sites $S0$–$S4$ when external $K^+$ is replaced by $\\mathrm{NMG}^+$, increasing the pore diameter throughout and thereby permitting larger cations to permeate.**\nThis statement is flawed. First, assumption (iii) states that the conformation favored by low $[K^+]$ is *nonconductive*. A global dilation that would \"permit larger cations to permeate\" is inconsistent with a nonconductive state. The established model of C-type inactivation involves a collapse of the inner filter, not a uniform dilation. Thus, this option contradicts both the provided assumptions and the known biophysics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Loss of external $K^+$ destabilizes the conductive filter, favoring a C-type inactivated ensemble in which the central sites (for example around $S2$–$S3$) collapse while the external mouth near $S0/S1$ dilates; this dilation increases extracellular accessibility of the engineered residue, explaining the high $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ with $\\mathrm{NMG}^+$.**\nThis option provides a precise and accurate description of the derived mechanism. It correctly links the loss of external $K^+$ to the destabilization of the conductive state (consistent with assumption ii) and the favoring of a C-type inactivated state (consistent with assumption iii). Critically, it describes the known structural signature of this inactivated state: a collapsed inner filter (responsible for non-conduction) and a dilated external mouth. This dilation at the external mouth provides a direct physical explanation for the increased accessibility of the engineered residue, which is located \"immediately external to the $T\\!V\\!G\\!Y\\!G$ motif\" (i.e., near sites $S0/S1$). This model is consistent with all experimental observations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The difference in $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ arises solely from electrostatic screening by $K^+$ of the positively charged MTS reagent, with no accompanying structural change in the filter.**\nThis hypothesis is contradicted by several pieces of evidence. As analyzed previously, the sharp, switch-like dependence of $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ on $[K^+]_{\\mathrm{o}}$ (compare Condition $2$ vs. Condition $4$) is characteristic of a cooperative conformational change, not a simple electrostatic screening effect which would be more gradual. Furthermore, in Condition $2$, there is a high concentration of the positive ion $\\mathrm{NMG}^+$ which should also provide significant electrostatic screening, yet the accessibility is high. The most definitive refutation is that this option's claim of \"no accompanying structural change\" directly violates assumption (iii), which explicitly states that filter rearrangements occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{NMG}^+$ binds deep within the selectivity filter and mechanically pries it open from the inside, increasing accessibility of internal residues to MTS even in the absence of $K^+$.**\nThis statement is in direct contradiction with assumption (iv), which states that \"$\\mathrm{NMG}^+$ is too large to permeate or occupy the canonical selectivity filter sites.\" Therefore, $\\mathrm{NMG}^+$ cannot act as a mechanical wedge from within the filter. Its role is passive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2755319"}]}
