The instruction \"ignoring sampling noise by considering the infinite-trial limit\" implies that we should evaluate the estimators using the true population parameters. In this limit, the observed failure fraction converges to the true probability $P_0 = (1-p)^N$, and the observed mean PSC $\\hat{\\mu}$ converges to the true mean $\\mu = qm = qNp$.\n\nThe first estimator for $m$, based on the Poisson assumption, becomes:\n$$m_{\\text{est, Poisson}} = -\\ln(P_{0, \\text{bin}}) = -\\ln((1-p)^N) = -N \\ln(1-p)$$\nThis represents the value the estimator would yield if applied to the true failure probability generated by the underlying binomial process.\n\nThe second estimator for $m$, based on the mean PSC, is:\n$$m_{\\text{est, direct}} = \\frac{\\mu}{q} = \\frac{qNp}{q} = Np = m$$\nThis estimator correctly recovers the true mean quantal content, $m$, and is therefore an asymptotically unbiased estimator of $m$.\n\nThe \"bias\" as defined in the problem is the difference between the asymptotic value of the first estimator and the second (which is the true value, $m$).\n$$\\text{Bias}_m = m_{\\text{est, Poisson}} - m_{\\text{est, direct}} = [-N \\ln(1-p)] - [Np]$$\nSubstituting $N=20$ and $p=0.1$:\n$$\\text{Bias}_m = -20 \\ln(1-0.1) - (20 \\times 0.1) = -20 \\ln(0.9) - 2$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.10536051565$$\n$$\\text{Bias}_m \\approx -20 \\times (-0.10536051565) - 2 \\approx 2.107210313 - 2 = 0.107210313$$\nThis positive bias indicates that using the Poisson-based formula $-\\ln(P_0)$ on data generated from a binomial process overestimates the true mean quantal content $m$.

Therefore, the mean amplitude is:\n$$\\mu = qNp$$\n\nWe are given the following experimental estimates, which we will treat as the true parameters for the purpose of finding $N$ and $p$:\n-   Sample mean EPSC amplitude: $\\hat{\\mu} = 40 \\text{ pA}$\n-   Observed failure rate: $\\hat{P}_0 = 0.2$\n-   Assumed quantal size: $q = 10 \\text{ pA}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived relationships gives a system of two equations with two unknowns, $N$ and $p$:\n1.  $40 = 10 \\cdot Np \\implies Np = 4$\n2.  $0.2 = (1-p)^N$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express $p$ in terms of $N$ as $p = 4/N$. The constraints on the parameters are that $N$ must be a positive integer representing the number of sites, and the probability $p$ must satisfy $0 < p < 1$. The condition $p < 1$ implies $4/N < 1$, which means $N > 4$. Since $N$ is an integer, we must have $N \\ge 5$.\n\nSubstituting $p = 4/N$ into equation (2), we get:\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{4}{N}\\right)^N = 0.2$$\n\nWe must now determine if there exists an integer $N \\ge 5$ that satisfies this equation. Let us analyze the function $f(N) = (1 - 4/N)^N$ for $N > 4$.\nTo understand the behavior of this function, we can examine its properties. It is a known result from calculus that for a fixed real number $x$, the function $(1 + x/N)^N$ is monotonically increasing with $N$ if $x > -N$. In our case, $x = -4$, and the condition becomes $-4 > -N$, or $N>4$, which is the domain we are considering. Thus, $f(N)$ is a strictly increasing function of $N$ for $N>4$.\n\nThe lower bound for $f(N)$ in the domain of interest is at $N=5$:\n$$f(5) = \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{5}\\right)^5 = (0.2)^5 = 0.00032$$\nThe upper bound is the limit as $N$ approaches infinity:\n$$\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} f(N) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{N}\\right)^N = \\exp(-4)$$\nNumerically, $\\exp(-4) \\approx 0.0183$.\n\nSo, for all valid integer $N \\ge 5$, the value of $f(N)$ is bounded as follows:\n$$0.00032 \\le \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{N}\\right)^N < \\exp(-4) \\approx 0.0183$$\nWe are seeking a solution to $f(N) = 0.2$. Since $0.2$ is outside the range of possible values for $f(N)$, we conclude that there are no such real numbers $N>4$ (and therefore no integers $N \\ge 5$) that can satisfy the given conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, for a set of parameters $(N, p, q)$ to be physically plausible under the binomial model, they must satisfy the inequality:\n$$P_0 \\le \\exp(-Np)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln(P_0) \\le -Np$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$Np \\le -\\ln(P_0)$$\nThis inequality provides a rigorous upper bound on the mean number of released quanta, $Np$, for a given failure probability $P_0$. The maximum value of $Np$ is achieved in the limit of an infinite number of release sites ($N \\to \\infty$) each with an infinitesimally small release probability ($p \\to 0$).\n\nNow, we introduce the mean amplitude relation $\\mu = qNp$, which implies $Np = \\mu/q$. Substituting this into our inequality gives:\n$$\\frac{\\mu}{q} \\le -\\ln(P_0)$$\nTo ensure this condition can be satisfied, $q$ must be sufficiently large. We can solve for $q$:\n$$q \\ge \\frac{\\mu}{-\\ln(P_0)} = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\ln(P_0)}$$\nThe minimal quantal size, $q_{\\min}$, is the value that turns this inequality into an equality, representing the boundary case of consistency (achievable in the limit $N \\to \\infty$).\n$$q_{\\min} = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\ln(P_0)}$$\n\nWe use the observed experimental values $\\hat{\\mu} = 40 \\text{ pA}$ and $\\hat{P}_0 = 0.2$:\n$$q_{\\min} = -\\frac{40}{\\ln(0.2)}$$\nThe natural logarithm of $0.2$ is $\\ln(1/5) = -\\ln(5)$.\n$$q_{\\min} = -\\frac{40}{-\\ln(5)} = \\frac{40}{\\ln(5)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(5) \\approx 1.60943791$$\n$$q_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{40}{1.60943791} \\approx 24.853545 \\text{ pA}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$q_{\\min} \\approx 24.85 \\text{ pA}$$\nThis is the minimum quantal size required for the observed mean amplitude and failure rate to be consistent with the binomial model of neurotransmitter release.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24.85}$$", "id": "2744485"}]}
