The analysis must proceed from fundamental principles: the law of mass action for a reversible binding reaction and the principle of mass conservation for the involved molecular species.\n\nThe system is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nwhere $R$ represents the free SNARE binding sites, $L$ represents the free complexin, and $RL$ represents the complexin–SNARE complex.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations of these species are related by the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, which is defined by the law of mass action:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nHere, $[\\cdot]$ denotes the molar concentration of the enclosed species.\n\nThe total concentrations of SNARE sites, $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and complexin, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, are constant. The principle of mass conservation provides two additional equations:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R] + [RL]$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [L] + [RL]$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, defined as:\n$$\\theta \\equiv \\frac{[RL]}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n\nTo solve for $[RL]$, we first express the concentrations of the free species, $[R]$ and $[L]$, in terms of the total concentrations and the concentration of the complex, $[RL]$. From the conservation equations, we have:\n$$[R] = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL]$$\n$$[L] = L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL]$$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $[R]$ and $[L]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])(L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])}{[RL]}$$\n\nThis equation must be solved for $[RL]$. We rearrange it into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where the variable $x$ is $[RL]$.\n$$K_{d}[RL] = (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])(L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])$$\n$$K_{d}[RL] = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_{\\mathrm{tot}}[RL] - L_{\\mathrm{tot}}[RL] + [RL]^2$$\n$$0 = [RL]^2 - (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})[RL] + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $[RL]$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nwith coefficients $a=1$, $b = -(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})$, and $c = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients, we get:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})^2 - 4R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}}{2}$$\n\nThis equation yields two mathematical solutions. We must select the one that is physically meaningful. The concentration of the complex, $[RL]$, cannot exceed the total concentration of either of its constituents, i.e., $[RL] \\leq R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $[RL] \\leq L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. Let us examine the value of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})x + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ at $x = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 - (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 - R_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 - L_{\\mathrm{tot}}R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - K_{d}R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = -K_{d}R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\nSince $K_{d} > 0$ and $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} > 0$, $f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) < 0$. The parabola $f(x)$ opens upwards ($a=1>0$). Because $f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}})$ is negative, one root of the quadratic equation must be less than $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and the other must be greater than $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The larger root is therefore physically impossible, as it would imply creating more complex than the total amount of available reactant. Thus, we must choose the smaller root, which corresponds to the minus sign in the numerator.\n\nThe physically correct solution for the equilibrium concentration of the complex is:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})^2 - 4R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ by dividing $[RL]$ by $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})^2 - 4R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}}{2R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the fractional occupancy.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum in the numerator:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 200\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 50\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 255\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the terms inside the square root:\n$$(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})^2 = (255\\,\\mathrm{nM})^2 = 65025\\,(\\mathrm{nM})^2$$\n$$4R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 4 \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{nM}) \\times (200\\,\\mathrm{nM}) = 4000\\,(\\mathrm{nM})^2$$\n\nThe term under the square root is:\n$$65025 - 4000 = 61025\\,(\\mathrm{nM})^2$$\nIts square root is:\n$$\\sqrt{61025\\,(\\mathrm{nM})^2} \\approx 247.032386\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nNow we can calculate $[RL]$:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{255 - 247.032386}{2}\\,\\mathrm{nM} = \\frac{7.967614}{2}\\,\\mathrm{nM} \\approx 3.983807\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{3.983807\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}} \\approx 0.7967614$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.7968$$\nThis result indicates that approximately $79.68\\%$ of the available SNARE binding sites are occupied by complexin at equilibrium under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7968}$$", "id": "2695679"}, {"introduction": "Accessory proteins modulate fusion by altering the energy landscape of the SNARE-mediated pathway.
