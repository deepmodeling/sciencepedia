We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe relationship between synaptic current, synaptic conductance, and electrochemical driving force is a specific application of Ohm's law to ion channels. The current ($I$) flowing through a population of open channels is directly proportional to the total conductance ($g$) of those channels and the electrochemical driving force acting on the permeable ions. This is expressed as:\n$$I = g \\cdot (V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$$\nwhere $V_m$ is the membrane potential and $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential of the ion channel. The term $(V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$ represents the electrochemical driving force.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are conducting a voltage-clamp experiment, which means the membrane potential is held constant at a specified value, $V_{\\text{hold}}$. We are interested in the peak current of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, $I_{\\text{peak}}$, which corresponds to the peak synaptic conductance, $g_{\\text{peak}}$, that occurs when the maximum number of synaptic channels are transiently opened by the release of a single quantum of neurotransmitter.\n\nSubstituting these specific parameters into the general equation gives:\n$$I_{\\text{peak}} = g_{\\text{peak}} \\cdot (V_{\\text{hold}} - E_{\\text{rev}})$$\n\nTo find the expression for the peak synaptic conductance, we simply rearrange this equation by algebraic manipulation:\n$$g_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{V_{\\text{hold}} - E_{\\text{rev}}}$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNow, we will substitute the given numerical values into this expression to calculate the value of $g_{\\text{peak}}$.

Since the problem asks for the answer in nanosiemens ($\\text{nS}$), and $1\\ \\text{nS} = 10^{-9}\\ \\text{S}$, we have:\n$$g_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{12}{70}\\ \\text{nS} \\approx 0.17142857...\\ \\text{nS}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$g_{\\text{peak}} \\approx 0.1714\\ \\text{nS}$$\n\nThe explanation for why conductance is a positive value despite the negative current is fundamental to the principles of electrophysiology.\n$1$. By electrophysiological convention, an inward flow of positive charge into the cell is defined as a negative current. The measured current $I_{\\text{peak}} = -12\\ \\text{pA}$ is negative, which correctly signifies an inward current of cations, as expected for an excitatory postsynaptic event.\n$2$. The driving force, $(V_{\\text{hold}} - E_{\\text{rev}})$, determines the direction and magnitude of ion flow. Here, the driving force is $(-70\\ \\text{mV} - 0\\ \\text{mV}) = -70\\ \\text{mV}$. A negative driving force indicates an electrochemical gradient that propels positive ions into the cell (from the outside, where potential is $0\\ \\text{mV}$, to the inside, which is at a more negative potential than $E_{\\text{rev}}$).\n$3$. Conductance, $g_{\\text{peak}}$, is an intrinsic physical property of the ion channels. It represents the capacity to conduct electric current and, like electrical resistance (its reciprocal), cannot be a negative value. A conductance of $0$ corresponds to a closed, non-conducting channel, while any positive value signifies an open, conducting state.\n$4$. From a mathematical standpoint, the equation $g_{\\text{peak}} = I_{\\text{peak}} / (V_{\\text{hold}} - E_{\\text{rev}})$ shows that the conductance is the ratio of the current to the driving force. In this case, it is the ratio of a negative current ($-12\\ \\text{pA}$) to a negative driving force ($-70\\ \\text{mV}$). The division of one negative number by another yields a positive number, which is consistent with the physical requirement that conductance must be positive. Therefore, the negative sign of the current is a direct consequence of the negative driving force at the specified holding potential, while the conductance itself remains a positive, physical quantity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1714}$$", "id": "2726532"}, {"introduction": "While the total synaptic conductance provides a measure of the synaptic event's strength, it is ultimately the result of a discrete number of ion channels opening simultaneously.

Specifically:\n\n- Explain mechanistically why an increase in $R_s$ reduces the measured peak mEPSC amplitude, identifying both the instantaneous voltage error mechanism and the finite clamp-speed (low-pass) mechanism set by $R_s$ and $C_m$ relative to $\\tau_r$.\n- For the parameter values above, derive an approximate fractional change in measured peak amplitude when $R_s$ doubles from $8\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ to $16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.

An increase in $R_s$ reduces apparent mEPSC amplitude because the synaptic current drops across $R_s$, decreasing the effective driving force at the membrane, and because the $R_s$–$C_m$ combination slows the clamp relative to the event rise, attenuating fast peaks. For $V_h=-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}=0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $g_{\\mathrm{peak}}=1.2\\,\\mathrm{nS}$, $C_m=10\\,\\mathrm{pF}$, $\\tau_r=0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, increasing $R_s$ from $8\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ to $16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ produces approximately a $1\\%$ additional attenuation from instantaneous voltage error and about a $12\\%$ additional attenuation from the finite clamp-speed effect, for a combined $\\sim 13\\%$ decrease in measured peak. Online $R_s$ can be tracked with small ($\\Delta V \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) test pulses, using the initial current immediately after the step to estimate $R_s$, and post hoc exclusions can remove sweeps where $R_s$ drifts by more than $20\\%$ from baseline or where the instantaneous voltage error $|I_{\\mathrm{peak}}|R_s$ exceeds about $2$–$5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nB. An increase in $R_s$ does not alter mEPSC amplitude because voltage clamp maintains $V_m=V_h$ regardless of $R_s$; changes in $R_s$ only increase noise. Monitoring $R_s$ online is unnecessary; post hoc exclusion based solely on baseline noise level is sufficient.\n\nC. An increase in $R_s$ increases apparent mEPSC amplitude because the higher series resistance increases the fraction of synaptic current that passes through the membrane. The correct way to monitor $R_s$ online is to use the steady-state current during a small test pulse to compute $R_s=\\Delta V/I_{\\infty}$, and to exclude sweeps only if membrane capacitance $C_m$ changes by more than $20\\%$.\n\nD. An increase in $R_s$ reduces apparent mEPSC amplitude, but the effect is entirely due to changes in the membrane time constant $\\tau=C_m R_m$; $R_s$ does not affect clamp speed.

It is scientifically sound and well-posed. Therefore, I will proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution from First Principles**\n\nThe analysis is broken down into three parts as requested: mechanistic explanation, quantitative estimation, and monitoring strategy.\n\n**1. Mechanistic Explanation of mEPSC Amplitude Reduction by Increased $R_s$**\n\nIn an ideal voltage clamp, the membrane potential ($V_m$) is held perfectly at the command potential ($V_h$). However, the access resistance ($R_s$) of the patch pipette is in series with the cell, creating a voltage divider and a low-pass filter. An increase in $R_s$ degrades the quality of the voltage clamp in two primary ways, both of which reduce the measured amplitude of a fast synaptic current like an mEPSC.\n\n-   **Instantaneous Voltage Error:** The synaptic current, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, must flow through the series resistance $R_s$ to be measured by the amplifier. According to Ohm's law, this current creates a voltage drop across $R_s$, equal to $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}R_s$. Consequently, the actual membrane potential, $V_m$, is not equal to the holding potential $V_h$. Instead, $V_m = V_h - I_{\\mathrm{syn}}R_s$. The synaptic current itself is determined by the synaptic conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$) and the driving force ($V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$), where $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the reversal potential for the excitatory current.\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{syn}} = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t) (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\n    Substituting the expression for the true $V_m$:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{syn}} = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t) ( (V_h - I_{\\mathrm{syn}}R_s) - E_{\\mathrm{rev}} )$$\n    Solving for $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, which is the current we aim to measure ($I_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$):\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(1 + g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)R_s) = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)(V_h - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{syn}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)(V_h - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})}{1 + g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)R_s}$$\n    The term $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)(V_h - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ represents the ideal current, $I_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, that would flow if $R_s=0$. The denominator $(1 + g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)R_s)$ shows that the presence of $R_s$ introduces an error that reduces the measured current. As $R_s$ increases, this attenuation becomes more severe. This effect is \"instantaneous\" as it depends on the momentary values of current and conductance.\n\n-   **Finite Clamp Speed (Low-Pass Filtering):** The combination of the series resistance $R_s$ and the cell's membrane capacitance $C_m$ forms a first-order low-pass RC filter. The time constant of this filter is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}} = R_s C_m$. The voltage-clamp amplifier can only sense and control the membrane potential through this filter. For a rapidly changing synaptic current, such as an mEPSC with a rise time constant $\\tau_r$, the clamp cannot respond infinitely fast. If the event's kinetics are comparable to or faster than the filter's time constant (i.e., $\\tau_r$ is not much larger than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}}$), the fast-rising phase of the current will be \"filtered out\" or attenuated. The measured peak amplitude will be smaller than the true peak, and the measured rise time will be slowed. An increase in $R_s$ increases $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}}$, making the filter \"slower\" (lower cutoff frequency), which leads to greater attenuation of fast events.\n\n**2. Quantitative Estimation of Fractional Amplitude Change**\n\nLet us separate the two effects and estimate their contributions when $R_s$ increases from $R_{s1} = 8\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ to $R_{s2} = 16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$. Other parameters are: $g_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nS}$, $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $C_m = 10\\,\\mathrm{pF}$, $\\tau_r = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n-   **Contribution from Instantaneous Voltage Error:**\n    The attenuation factor due to voltage error is $f_{\\mathrm{VE}} = 1 / (1 + g_{\\mathrm{peak}}R_s)$.\n    For $R_{s1} = 8 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$:\n    The term $g_{\\mathrm{peak}}R_{s1} = (1.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S})(8 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega) = 0.0096$.\n    The attenuation factor is $f_{\\mathrm{VE},1} = 1 / (1 + 0.0096) \\approx 0.9905$. This corresponds to a $1 - 0.9905 = 0.95\\%$ reduction in amplitude.\n    For $R_{s2} = 16 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$:\n    The term $g_{\\mathrm{peak}}R_{s2} = (1.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S})(16 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega) = 0.0192$.\n    The attenuation factor is $f_{\\mathrm{VE},2} = 1 / (1 + 0.0192) \\approx 0.9812$. This corresponds to a $1 - 0.9812 = 1.88\\%$ reduction in amplitude.\n    The change in amplitude *relative to the amplitude at $R_{s1}$* is the ratio of the factors: $f_{\\mathrm{VE},2} / f_{\\mathrm{VE},1} = 0.9812 / 0.9905 \\approx 0.9906$. This is a further reduction of $1 - 0.9906 = 0.0094$, or approximately $1\\%$.\n\n-   **Contribution from Finite Clamp Speed (Filtering):**\n    The filter time constant is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}} = R_s C_m$. The event rise time is $\\tau_r = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    For $R_{s1} = 8\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$:\n    $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter},1} = (8 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega)(10 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) = 80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    For $R_{s2} = 16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$:\n    $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter},2} = (16 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega)(10 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) = 160 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.16\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    The attenuation of the peak of a fast event can be approximated. A common, though simplified, approximation for the attenuation factor is $f_{\\mathrm{filt}} \\approx \\tau_r / (\\tau_r + \\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}})$.\n    For $R_{s1}$: $f_{\\mathrm{filt},1} \\approx 0.5 / (0.5 + 0.08) = 0.5 / 0.58 \\approx 0.862$.\n    For $R_{s2}$: $f_{\\mathrm{filt},2} \\approx 0.5 / (0.5 + 0.16) = 0.5 / 0.66 \\approx 0.758$.\n    The change in amplitude from filtering *relative to the amplitude at $R_{s1}$* is $f_{\\mathrm{filt},2} / f_{\\mathrm{filt},1} = 0.758 / 0.862 \\approx 0.879$. This is a further reduction of $1 - 0.879 = 0.121$, or approximately $12\\%$.\n\n-   **Combined Effect:**\n    The total measured peak amplitude $I_{\\mathrm{peak, meas}}$ is approximately the ideal peak amplitude multiplied by both attenuation factors: $I_{\\mathrm{peak, meas}} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{ideal}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{VE}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{filt}}$.\n    The ratio of the measured peak amplitude at $R_{s2}$ to that at $R_{s1}$ is:\n    $$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak,2}}}{I_{\\mathrm{peak,1}}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{VE},2} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{filt},2}}{f_{\\mathrm{VE},1} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{filt},1}} = \\left(\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{VE},2}}{f_{\\mathrm{VE},1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{filt},2}}{f_{\\mathrm{filt},1}}\\right) \\approx (0.9906) \\times (0.879) \\approx 0.8708$$\n    This corresponds to a total decrease in measured amplitude of $1 - 0.8708 = 0.1292$, or approximately $13\\%$.\n\n**3. Online Monitoring Strategy and Post Hoc Exclusion Thresholds**\n\nTo guard against such artifacts, $R_s$ must be monitored throughout an experiment. A standard method involves applying small, brief voltage steps ($\\Delta V$, e.g., $5-10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) at regular intervals.\n-   **$R_s$ Estimation:** When a voltage step $\\Delta V$ is applied, the membrane potential $V_m$ cannot change instantaneously due to the membrane capacitance $C_m$. At the first instant ($t=0^+$), the entire voltage step drops across the series resistor $R_s$. According to Ohm's law, the initial peak of the capacitive current transient, $I_{\\mathrm{peak,cap}}$, is given by $I_{\\mathrm{peak,cap}} = \\Delta V / R_s$. By measuring this peak current, one can calculate $R_s$ in real time:\n    $$R_s = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I_{\\mathrm{peak,cap}}}$$\n-   **Post Hoc Exclusion:** Collected data should be reviewed, and traces recorded when the clamp quality was poor should be excluded. Common criteria include:\n    -   **Drift in $R_s$:** Exclude any recordings (sweeps) where $R_s$ has changed by more than a set percentage from its initial value at the start of the recording (e.g., a threshold of $15-25\\%$). A $20\\%$ threshold is common.\n    -   **Absolute Voltage Error:** The voltage error at the peak of the event, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{err}} = |I_{\\mathrm{peak}}|R_s$, should be kept small to ensure the clamp is effective. A common criterion is to exclude events where this error exceeds a threshold, typically in the range of $2-5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A:** This option correctly describes the two mechanisms of amplitude reduction (voltage error and low-pass filtering). Its quantitative estimate of an additional $\\sim 1\\%$ reduction from voltage error and $\\sim 12\\%$ from filtering, for a combined total of $\\sim 13\\%$, accurately matches our derivation. The proposed monitoring strategy ($R_s = \\Delta V / I_{\\mathrm{initial}}$) and the post hoc exclusion criteria ($R_s$ drift $> 20\\%$, voltage error $|I_{\\mathrm{peak}}|R_s > 2-5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) are all standard and correct practices in electrophysiology. **Correct.**\n\n-   **B:** This option claims $R_s$ does not alter amplitude because the voltage clamp is perfect. This premise is fundamentally false. A real voltage clamp is limited by $R_s$. Consequently, its conclusion and recommendation to not monitor $R_s$ are incorrect and represent poor experimental practice. **Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C:** This option incorrectly claims that increased $R_s$ *increases* amplitude. Its proposed method for monitoring $R_s$ using steady-state current ($I_{\\infty}$) is also incorrect; $\\Delta V / I_{\\infty}$ measures the total DC input resistance ($R_s + R_m$), not $R_s$ alone. **Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D:** This option correctly states that amplitude is reduced but incorrectly attributes the entire effect to the membrane time constant $\\tau_m = R_m C_m$ and falsely claims $R_s$ does not affect clamp speed. The key time constant for clamp speed is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}} = R_s C_m$. Confusing $\\tau_m$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{filter}}$ is a critical error. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a thorough analysis from first principles, Option A provides the most accurate and complete description of the phenomenon, the quantitative effects, and the appropriate experimental controls.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2726535"}]}
