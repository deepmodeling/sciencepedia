Profile for Kiss-and-Run Exocytosis:**\n- **Fusion Pore Dynamics:** A narrow pore opens, connecting the vesicle lumen to the extracellular space, and then recloses before significant dilation.\n- **pHluorin Signal:**\n    - **Step Amplitude:** Upon pore opening, protons ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) rapidly equilibrate between the extracellular space ($\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 7.4$) and the vesicle lumen ($\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 5.5$), leading to a rapid neutralization of the lumen. This causes a step-like dequenching of the pHluorin molecules within the vesicle. The magnitude of this step is proportional to the total amount of pHluorin in the vesicle, which in turn relates to the vesicle's size and protein expression level.\n    - **Decay Kinetics:** Upon pore closure, the $\\mathrm{V}$-ATPase pumps protons back into the vesicle, reacidifying the lumen and quenching the pHluorin fluorescence. This process is described as a \"relatively fast monoexponential decay\" with a time constant $\\tau$ on the order of seconds.\n- **Amperometric Signal:** The narrow, transient pore permits only a slow leakage of catecholamine neurotransmitters. This generates a low-amplitude current known as a \"foot\". Since the pore closes before dilating, the rapid, bulk release of content does not occur. Therefore, the signature is a \"foot-only\" signal, possibly prolonged, without a subsequent large spike.\n\n**2. Profile for Full-Fusion Exocytosis:**\n- **Fusion Pore Dynamics:** A narrow pore opens and then irreversibly dilates, leading to the complete merger of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane.\n- **pHluorin Signal:**\n    - **Step Amplitude:** The initial event is the same as in kiss-and-run: pore opening and rapid luminal neutralization. Therefore, for a vesicle of the same size, the initial pHluorin step amplitude should be comparable to that of a kiss-and-run event.\n    - **Decay Kinetics:** Since the vesicle fully collapses, reacidification by the $\\mathrm{V}$-ATPase is not possible. The pHluorin-tagged membrane proteins diffuse laterally in the plasma membrane and are eventually cleared from the site by endocytosis. This is a much slower process, described as having a decay time constant $\\tau$ on the order of tens of seconds.\n- **Amperometric Signal:** The initial narrow pore produces a brief \"foot\" signal. The subsequent rapid and full dilation of the pore allows for the explosive release of the entire vesicle content, generating a large, high-frequency amperometric \"spike\".\n\n**Summary of Differentiating Criteria:**\n| Observable                | Kiss-and-Run                                           | Full Fusion                                                    |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| pHluorin Step Amplitude   | Standard step (proportional to vesicle content)        | Standard step (comparable to Kiss-and-Run for same-size vesicle) |\n| pHluorin Decay $\\tau$     | Fast ($\\sim \\mathrm{seconds}$)                           | Slow ($\\sim \\mathrm{tens\\ of\\ seconds}$)                         |\n| Amperometry               | Foot-only, no large spike                              | Brief foot followed by a large spike                           |\n\nWe now evaluate each option against this derived summary.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.
