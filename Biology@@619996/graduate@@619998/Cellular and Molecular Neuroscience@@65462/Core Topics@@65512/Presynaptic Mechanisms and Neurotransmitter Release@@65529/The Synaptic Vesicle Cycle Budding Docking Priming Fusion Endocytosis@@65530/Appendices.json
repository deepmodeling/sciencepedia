It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a standard, simplified model of synaptic vesicle pool dynamics, which is a core topic in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We may thus proceed with the formal derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expected depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles after a train of $N$ action potentials. Let the initial size of the RRP be $R_0$. The total depletion, which we denote by the random variable $D$, is the total number of vesicles that undergo fusion during the train of $N$ spikes. We seek to compute the expectation of $D$, denoted as $E[D]$.\n\nLet us consider the set of $R_0$ vesicles initially present in the RRP. We can label these vesicles from $i=1$ to $i=R_0$. For each vesicle $i$, let us define an indicator random variable $F_i$ such that:\n$$\nF_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if vesicle } i \\text{ fuses during the } N \\text{ spikes} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if vesicle } i \\text{ does not fuse during the } N \\text{ spikes}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of fused vesicles, $D$, is the sum of these indicator variables over all vesicles in the initial pool:\n$$ D = \\sum_{i=1}^{R_0} F_i $$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total depletion is the sum of the expectations of the individual indicator variables:\n$$ E[D] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{R_0} F_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{R_0} E[F_i] $$\nThe expectation of an indicator random variable is equal to the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, $E[F_i] = P(F_i=1)$, where $P(F_i=1)$ is the probability that vesicle $i$ fuses at some point during the train of $N$ spikes.\n\nAccording to the problem's assumption (ii), the probability of fusion, $p$, is constant for any given primed vesicle and for each action potential. All vesicles in the RRP are functionally identical in this model. Consequently, the probability of fusion for any single vesicle $i$ during the train, $P(F_i=1)$, is the same for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, R_0\\}$. Let us denote this common probability as $P_{\\text{fuse}}$. The expression for the expected depletion simplifies to:\n$$ E[D] = \\sum_{i=1}^{R_0} P_{\\text{fuse}} = R_0 \\cdot P_{\\text{fuse}} $$\nOur task is now reduced to calculating $P_{\\text{fuse}}$. It is more direct to first calculate the complementary probability, $P_{\\text{survive}}$, which is the probability that a single vesicle does *not* fuse during the entire train of $N$ spikes. A vesicle fuses if it has not survived. Thus, $P_{\\text{fuse}} = 1 - P_{\\text{survive}}$.\n\nLet us consider a single vesicle from the initial RRP. At the first spike, the probability that this vesicle fuses is $p$. The probability that it does not fuse is $1-p$.\nIf the vesicle does not fuse at the first spike, it remains in the primed RRP. At the second spike, the probability that it fuses is again $p$, and the probability that it survives this second spike is again $1-p$. This process repeats for all $N$ spikes.\n\nA vesicle survives the entire train of $N$ spikes if and only if it survives the first spike, AND the second spike, ..., AND the $N$-th spike. The outcome for a vesicle at each spike is an independent event, conditional on its survival up to that point. The probability of a vesicle surviving the entire train is the product of the probabilities of it surviving each individual spike:\n$$ P_{\\text{survive}} = \\underbrace{(1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times \\dots \\times (1-p)}_{N \\text{ times}} = (1-p)^N $$\nNow, we can find the probability $P_{\\text{fuse}}$ that a vesicle fuses at some point during the train. This event is the complement of the vesicle surviving the entire train.\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}} = 1 - P_{\\text{survive}} = 1 - (1-p)^N $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $P_{\\text{fuse}}$ back into our equation for the expected depletion $E[D]$:\n$$ E[D] = R_0 \\cdot \\left(1 - (1-p)^N\\right) $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the expected depletion of the RRP in units of vesicles.

By working through the logic of this analysis [@problem_id:2767708], you will learn to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimental data.", "problem": "A central approach to estimating the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and the initial release probability in excitatory synapses is cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) analysis during high-frequency stimulation. Consider a synapse stimulated with a train of $50$ stimuli at $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, while postsynaptic receptor saturation and desensitization have been pharmacologically minimized and the driving force held constant. The EPSC for each stimulus is integrated to obtain the charge per EPSC, denoted $Q_i$ for the $i$-th EPSC. The cumulative charge is defined as $C(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Q_i$.

Use the following modeling assumptions explicitly in your reasoning:\n\n- The synapse contains a homogeneous readily releasable pool of $N$ vesicles at train onset, each releasing independently with per-stimulus release probability $p$ and quantal charge $q$, so that $Q_i \\approx p q R_i$, where $R_i$ is the number of vesicles available immediately before stimulus $i$.\n- Vesicle replenishment into the readily releasable pool occurs between stimuli at an average rate that becomes constant in the late phase under high-frequency stimulation.\n- In the late phase, release per stimulus equals replenishment per stimulus (steady state), and the cumulative plot becomes linear with slope equal to the replenishment contribution per stimulus.\n- Any residual steady-state occupancy of the readily releasable pool just before stimuli in the late phase is small compared to the pool at train onset under the chosen frequency, allowing the standard back-extrapolation approximation.\n\nUsing these premises:\n\n1) Derive why the back-extrapolated $y$-intercept of the late linear fit approximates the total charge initially contained in the readily releasable pool at train onset.\n\n2) Compute the readily releasable pool size in vesicles from the given regression parameters and $q$.\n\n3) Compute the initial per-stimulus release probability $p$ from $Q_1$ and the estimated RRP charge.\n\n4) Compute the steady-state replenishment rate in vesicles per second from the slope and $q$.\n\nExpress the readily releasable pool size in vesicles.

We can proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation to justify the back-extrapolation method for estimating the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles, and then to compute several key synaptic parameters.\n\n1) Derivation of the back-extrapolation method's validity.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the initial number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool (RRP) at the start of the stimulation train ($t=0$). Let $p$ be the probability of release for each vesicle in the RRP upon the arrival of a single action potential (stimulus). Let $q$ be the quantal charge, i.e., the charge corresponding to the fusion of a single vesicle. Let $r$ be the number of vesicles replenished into the RRP during one inter-stimulus interval. We assume $p$ and $r$ are constant during the high-frequency train, as per the standard model simplified for this analysis.\n\nLet $R_i$ be the number of vesicles in the RRP immediately before the $i$-th stimulus. The initial condition is $R_1 = N_0$.\nThe charge released by the $i$-th stimulus, $Q_i$, is given by the quantal hypothesis:\n$$ Q_i = q p R_i $$\nBetween stimulus $i$ and $i+1$, the RRP is depleted by release and refilled by replenishment. The number of vesicles in the pool before the next stimulus, $R_{i+1}$, is described by the mass-balance difference equation:\n$$ R_{i+1} = R_i - pR_i + r = (1-p)R_i + r $$\nThis is a linear first-order non-homogeneous difference equation. Its solution, with the initial condition $R_1 = N_0$, is:\n$$ R_i = (N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})(1-p)^{i-1} + \\frac{r}{p} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $Q_i$:\n$$ Q_i = qp \\left[ (N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})(1-p)^{i-1} + \\frac{r}{p} \\right] = qp(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})(1-p)^{i-1} + qr $$\nThe cumulative charge after $N$ stimuli, $C(N)$, is the sum of the individual EPSC charges:\n$$ C(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Q_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ qp(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})(1-p)^{i-1} + qr \\right] $$\nThis sum can be split into two parts:\n$$ C(N) = qp(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p}) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (1-p)^{i-1} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} qr $$\nThe first sum is a geometric series. Evaluating the sums gives:\n$$ C(N) = qp(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p}) \\frac{1-(1-p)^N}{1-(1-p)} + Nqr $$\n$$ C(N) = q(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})[1-(1-p)^N] + Nqr $$\nThe problem states that a linear regression is performed on the late, steady-depressing phase of the $C(N)$ versus $N$ plot. In this phase, for large $N$, the term $(1-p)^N$ approaches zero, as $0  p  1$. The equation for $C(N)$ thus approaches a linear asymptote:\n$$ C_{asym}(N) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty, (1-p)^N\\to 0} C(N) \\approx q(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})(1) + Nqr $$\n$$ C_{asym}(N) = (qr)N + q(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p}) $$\nThis is the equation of a straight line, $y = mx+b$, where the stimulus number $N$ is the independent variable. By comparing terms, we can identify the slope and y-intercept of this asymptotic line:\n- The slope is $m = qr$. This is the charge replenished and then released per stimulus interval in the steady state.\n- The y-intercept is $b = q(N_0 - \\frac{r}{p})$.\n\nThe term $R_{ss} = r/p$ represents the steady-state number of vesicles in the RRP (where release $pR_{ss}$ balances replenishment $r$). So, the intercept can be written as $b = qN_0 - qR_{ss}$. This means the back-extrapolated intercept is an estimate of the initial RRP charge ($qN_0$) minus the charge of the residual steady-state pool ($qR_{ss}$).\n\nThe problem provides a critical modeling assumption: \"Any residual steady-state occupancy of the readily releasable pool... is small compared to the pool at train onset\". This translates to $R_{ss} \\ll N_0$. Consequently, the charge of the steady-state pool is negligible compared to the charge of the initial pool: $qR_{ss} \\ll qN_0$.\nUnder this specific approximation, the intercept $b$ becomes a direct estimate of the total charge of the initial RRP:\n$$ b = qN_0 - qR_{ss} \\approx qN_0 $$\nThis completes the justification. The back-extrapolated y-intercept provides an estimate of the total charge of the initial RRP, provided the steady-state pool size is negligible.\n\n2) Compute the readily releasable pool size ($N_0$) in vesicles.\n\nFrom the derived approximation $b \\approx qN_0$, we can calculate the RRP size $N_0$.\nGiven: $b = 5.40\\,\\mathrm{pC}$ and $q = 0.270\\,\\mathrm{pC/vesicle}$.\n$$ N_0 \\approx \\frac{b}{q} = \\frac{5.40\\,\\mathrm{pC}}{0.270\\,\\mathrm{pC/vesicle}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{vesicles} $$\nThe problem requests the final answer rounded to three significant figures.\n\n3) Compute the initial per-stimulus release probability ($p$).\n\nThe charge of the first EPSC is given by $Q_1 = q p R_1$. Since $R_1=N_0$, we have $Q_1 = q p N_0 = p(qN_0)$.\nUsing the approximation $qN_0 \\approx b$, we get $Q_1 \\approx p b$.\nWe can solve for $p$:\n$$ p \\approx \\frac{Q_1}{b} $$\nGiven: $Q_1 = 1.52\\,\\mathrm{pC}$ and $b = 5.40\\,\\mathrm{pC}$.\n$$ p \\approx \\frac{1.52\\,\\mathrm{pC}}{5.40\\,\\mathrm{pC}} \\approx 0.28148... $$\nSo, the initial release probability is approximately $0.281$.\n\n4) Compute the steady-state replenishment rate in vesicles per second.\n\nFrom the derivation in part (1), the slope of the late linear fit is $m = qr$, where $r$ is the replenishment rate in vesicles per inter-stimulus interval.\nGiven: $m = 0.210\\,\\mathrm{pC/stimulus}$ and $q = 0.270\\,\\mathrm{pC/vesicle}$.\n$$ r = \\frac{m}{q} = \\frac{0.210\\,\\mathrm{pC/stimulus}}{0.270\\,\\mathrm{pC/vesicle}} = \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.778\\,\\mathrm{vesicles/stimulus} $$\nThe stimulation frequency is $f = 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The replenishment rate per second, $r_{rate}$, is the rate per interval multiplied by the number of intervals per second ($f$).\n$$ r_{rate} = r \\times f = (\\frac{7}{9}\\,\\mathrm{vesicles/interval}) \\times (100\\,\\mathrm{intervals/s}) = \\frac{700}{9}\\,\\mathrm{vesicles/s} \\approx 77.8\\,\\mathrm{vesicles/s} $$\n\nThe question asks for the readily releasable pool size in vesicles, rounded to three significant figures, as the final answer.\n$N_0 = 20$.

Therefore:\n$$ p_2(T=0) = p([Ca]_0) = p_1 $$\nHowever, the vesicle pool is depleted by the first pulse before the second release occurs. The problem states the events at an AP occur sequentially: (1) release and pool decrement, (2) calcium step. This implies the state of the pool for the second, simultaneous pulse is the post-depletion state, $R(0^{+})$.\n$$ R(T=0^{-}) \\rightarrow R(0^{+}) = R_{\\max} - A_1 $$\nThe amplitude of the second release is thus:\n$$ A_2(T=0) = p_2(T=0) \\cdot R(0^{+}) = p([Ca]_0) (R_{\\max} - A_1) $$\nThe paired-pulse ratio for $T=0$ is:\n$$ \\text{PPR}(0) = \\frac{A_2(T=0)}{A_1} = \\frac{p([Ca]_0) (R_{\\max} - A_1)}{p([Ca]_0) R_{\\max}} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - A_1}{R_{\\max}} = 1 - \\frac{A_1}{R_{\\max}} $$\nSince $A_1 = p([Ca]_0) R_{\\max}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{PPR}(0) = 1 - p([Ca]_0) $$\nThis result correctly isolates the effect of pure vesicle pool depletion, as facilitation due to calcium is explicitly excluded by the problem's convention for $T=0$.\n\nThe derived analytical expressions allow for direct computation of the PPR for any given interstimulus interval $T$ without numerical integration, as requested.
