Plasma membrane syntaxin-1 can adopt an open or closed conformation; in the closed state, its N-terminal Ha, Hb, Hc (Habc) bundle packs against its SNARE motif. Mammalian uncoordinated-18 (Munc18-1), a Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family protein, binds strongly and selectively to closed syntaxin (the so-called mode-1 interaction), stabilizing the closed conformation and chaperoning syntaxin to the plasma membrane. During vesicle priming, Munc13 catalyzes opening of syntaxin, while Munc18 acts as a template or scaffold that nucleates assembly of the trans-SNARE complex with synaptobrevin (also known as Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein, VAMP) and Synaptosomal-Associated Protein of $25\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ (SNAP-25).\n\nConsider a simplified equilibrium model in which a single syntaxin molecule can be in one of three states: open ($O$), closed and unbound to Munc18 ($C$), or closed and bound to Munc18 ($MC$). Assume the following foundational facts and conditions:\n- In the absence of Munc18, open and closed syntaxin are isoenergetic, so that $ [O] : [C] = 1 : 1 $ at equilibrium.\n- Munc18 binds only the closed conformation with equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{d}$, and the free Munc18 concentration $[M]$ is effectively constant and satisfies $[M] \\gg [\\text{syntaxin}]$.\n- Wild-type has $K_{d} = 0.1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $[M] = 1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

In the absence of Munc18, these states are isoenergetic, implying the equilibrium constant $K_{conf} = \\frac{[O]}{[C]} = 1$.\n- **Equilibrium 2 (Binding):** $M + C \\rightleftharpoons MC$. Munc18 binds only to the closed conformation ($C$) with an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d = \\frac{[M][C]}{[MC]}$.\n- **Condition on Munc18:** The free Munc18 concentration, $[M]$, is constant and $[M] \\gg [\\text{syntaxin}]$.\n- **Parameters (Wild-Type, WT):** $K_{d} = 0.1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $[M] = 1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- **Parameters (Mutant, mut):** A mutation weakens the interaction $10$-fold, so $K_{d}^{\\text{mut}} = 10 \\times K_{d} = 1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- **Rate Assumption:** The vesicle priming rate is proportional to the concentration of the $MC$ complex. Rate $\\propto [MC]$.\n- **Quantities to Predict:** The change in (i) the total pool of closed syntaxin, defined as $[C_{total}] = [C] + [MC]$, and (ii) the vesicle priming rate due to the mutation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a simplified but well-established model of conformational selection in the Munc18-syntaxin system. The principles of chemical equilibrium and ligand binding are core concepts in physical chemistry and biophysics. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete set of assumptions and parameters required to derive a unique solution for the relative changes in the quantities of interest. The language is objective and the premises are internally consistent. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe system involves two linked equilibria: the conformational change of syntaxin and the binding of Munc18 to the closed conformation.\n1. $C \\rightleftharpoons O$ with $K_{conf} = \\frac{[O]}{[C]} = 1$, which means $[O] = [C]$.\n2. $M + C \\rightleftharpoons MC$ with $K_d = \\frac{[M][C]}{[MC]}$, which means $[MC] = \\frac{[M][C]}{K_d}$.\n\nLet $[S_{total}]$ be the total concentration of syntaxin. The conservation of mass requires:\n$$[S_{total}] = [O] + [C] + [MC]$$\nSubstituting the equilibrium relationships into this equation:\n$$[S_{total}] = [C] + [C] + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}[C]$$\n$$[S_{total}] = [C] \\left(2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}\\right)$$\nThis allows us to express the concentration of each species as a fraction of the total syntaxin concentration. The fraction of syntaxin in the unbound closed state ($C$) is:\n$$f_C = \\frac{[C]}{[S_{total}]} = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}$$\nThe fraction in the Munc18-bound closed state ($MC$) is:\n$$f_{MC} = \\frac{[MC]}{[S_{total}]} = \\frac{\\frac{[M]}{K_d}[C]}{[S_{total}]} = \\frac{\\frac{[M]}{K_d}}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}$$\n\nWe are asked to analyze two quantities:\n(i) The total pool of closed syntaxin: $[C_{total}] = [C] + [MC]$. The fraction of total syntaxin that is closed is $f_{C,total} = f_C + f_{MC}$.\n$$f_{C,total} = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}} + \\frac{\\frac{[M]}{K_d}}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}$$\n(ii) The vesicle priming rate, which is proportional to $[MC]$. We will analyze the behavior of $f_{MC}$.\n\nThe mutation increases $K_d$ by a factor of $10$. Let's examine the effect on the ratio $\\frac{[M]}{K_d}$, which determines the state populations.\n- **Wild-Type (WT):** $\\frac{[M]}{K_d} = \\frac{1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 10$.\n- **Mutant (mut):** $\\frac{[M]}{K_d^{\\text{mut}}} = \\frac{1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 1$.\n\nThe mutation causes the parameter $\\frac{[M]}{K_d}$ to decrease from $10$ to $1$.\n\n**Analysis of Quantity (i): Total Closed Syntaxin Pool**\nThe fraction of closed syntaxin is $f_{C,total} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}$. To see how this fraction changes, we can consider it as a function of $x = \\frac{[M]}{K_d}$, i.e., $g(x) = \\frac{1+x}{2+x}$. The derivative is $g'(x) = \\frac{(1)(2+x) - (1+x)(1)}{(2+x)^2} = \\frac{1}{(2+x)^2}$. Since $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$, the function is strictly increasing. As the mutation decreases $x$ from $10$ to $1$, the value of $f_{C,total}$ must decrease.\n\nQuantitatively:\n- $f_{C,total}^{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{1 + 10}{2 + 10} = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.917$\n- $f_{C,total}^{\\text{mut}} = \\frac{1 + 1}{2 + 1} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667$\nThe fraction of closed syntaxin decreases. Therefore, the total pool of closed syntaxin decreases. This is a direct consequence of Le Châtelier's principle: weakening the binding interaction that sequesters the closed state ($C$) shifts the overall equilibrium away from the closed population ($C$ and $MC$) and toward the open state ($O$).\n\n**Analysis of Quantity (ii): Vesicle Priming Rate**\nThe priming rate is proportional to $[MC]$, and thus to the fraction $f_{MC} = \\frac{\\frac{[M]}{K_d}}{2 + \\frac{[M]}{K_d}}$. Let us consider this as a function of $x = \\frac{[M]}{K_d}$, i.e., $h(x) = \\frac{x}{2+x}$. The derivative is $h'(x) = \\frac{(1)(2+x) - (x)(1)}{(2+x)^2} = \\frac{2}{(2+x)^2}$. Since $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$, this function is also strictly increasing. As the mutation decreases $x$ from $10$ to $1$, the value of $f_{MC}$ must decrease.\n\nQuantitatively:\n- $f_{MC}^{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{10}{2 + 10} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$\n- $f_{MC}^{\\text{mut}} = \\frac{1}{2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$\nThe fraction of Munc18-bound syntaxin decreases significantly. Since the priming rate is proportional to $[MC]$, the vesicle priming rate decreases.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mutation causes a decrease in the total closed syntaxin pool and a decrease in the vesicle priming rate.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The closed syntaxin pool decreases, and vesicle priming decreases.**\n    Our derivation shows that the mutation, by increasing $K_d$, reduces Munc18's ability to stabilize the closed state. This reduces the total concentration of closed syntaxin ($[C]+[MC]$) and also the concentration of the essential priming intermediate ($[MC]$). Both parts of this statement are consistent with the analysis.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The closed syntaxin pool decreases, and vesicle priming increases.**\n    The first part is correct. The second part is incorrect. A weaker binding affinity (higher $K_d$) cannot lead to a higher concentration of the bound complex $[MC]$ under these equilibrium conditions.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The closed syntaxin pool increases, and vesicle priming decreases.**\n    The first part is incorrect. Weaker stabilization of the closed state leads to a decrease, not an increase, in its total population. The second part is correct.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The closed syntaxin pool increases, and vesicle priming increases.**\n    Both parts of this statement are incorrect, as they are the opposite of the derived effects.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. No material change in either parameter, because Munc18 primarily affects fusion, not priming or syntaxin conformation.**\n    This statement contradicts the explicit premises of the problem. We are instructed to use a model where Munc18 binding *does* affect syntaxin conformation via conformational selection and where the $[MC]$ complex *is* the determinant of the priming rate. Our calculations show a material change in both parameters (e.g., the priming rate is predicted to drop by $60\\%$). Therefore, this option is invalid within the context of the problem.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2727799"}, {"introduction": "The zippering of the SNARE complex is a powerful mechanical process that generates the force required to overcome the large energy barrier of membrane fusion.

This layer is situated within the hydrophobic interior of the $4$-helix bundle.\n\n**1. Analysis of SNARE Complex Stability ($\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium stability of the protein complex is quantified by the Gibbs free energy of folding and association, $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$. A more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$ corresponds to a more stable complex.\n\n- **Wild-Type ($3$Q:$1$R) Complex:** The wild-type $0$-layer consists of three glutamine (Q) residues and one arginine (R) residue. Arginine is a large amino acid with a positively charged guanidinium group. Glutamine is polar but uncharged. Placing a formal charge, like that of arginine, into a low-dielectric, hydrophobic environment incurs a significant electrostatic energy penalty (a desolvation penalty). While this penalty is partially mitigated by the formation of hydrogen bonds with the three surrounding polar glutamine residues, an unfavorable electrostatic interaction remains. In fact, this so-called \"ionic layer\" is a point of structural strain and electrostatic frustration, and it *destabilizes* the complex relative to a hypothetical purely hydrophobic layer. It is a key functional feature, not an optimal one for stability alone.\n\n- **Mutant ($4$Q) Complex:** The R$\\to$Q mutation replaces the single charged arginine with a fourth glutamine. The resulting $4$Q layer is composed entirely of polar, uncharged residues. This configuration eliminates the large energetic penalty associated with burying an uncompensated charge in the hydrophobic core. The four glutamine side chains can arrange into a highly favorable, planar, and symmetric hydrogen-bonding network. This arrangement is significantly more stable from an electrostatic and steric perspective than the asymmetric and charged $3$Q:$1$R configuration.\n\n- **Conclusion on Stability:** By replacing the electrostatically unfavorable arginine with a neutral glutamine, the mutation relieves the inherent strain in the $0$-layer. This leads to a thermodynamically more stable complex. Therefore, the $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$ for the $4$Q mutant is more negative than that of the wild-type $3$Q:$1$R complex. In other words, the mutation **increases** the stability of the SNARE complex.\n\n**2.

This machinery uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to apply mechanical force to the N-termini of the SNARE helices, processively unzippering the complex.\n\n- **Relationship between Stability and Disassembly Rate:** The rate of any chemical or biochemical process, including protein unfolding, is governed by the height of the activation energy barrier ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$). The stability of the initial state (the folded *cis*-SNARE complex, with free energy $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$) is a primary contributor to this barrier. A more stable complex has a lower ground-state free energy, which, all else being equal, increases the energy required to reach the transition state for unfolding.\n\n- **Effect of the Mutation:** As established in the first part of our analysis, the $4$Q mutant complex is significantly more stable than the wild-type complex. This increased thermodynamic stability translates directly into increased kinetic resistance to forced unfolding. The NSF/$\\alpha$-SNAP machinery must expend more energy or time to disrupt the highly stable, symmetric hydrogen bond network of the $4$Q layer compared to the strained, less stable $3$Q:$1$R layer of the wild-type complex.\n\n- **Conclusion on Disassembly Rate:** Because the $4$Q mutant complex is more stable, it presents a higher activation energy barrier for disassembly by NSF/$\\alpha$-SNAP. Consequently, the rate of disassembly will be **slower** for the mutant complex compared to the wild-type.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n1.  SNARE complex stability: **Increases**.\n2.
