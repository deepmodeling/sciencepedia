The parameters and assumptions given are standard and sufficient for a unique solution. I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\n1) Derivation of the expected Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC) amplitude.\n\nThe problem states that the presynaptic active zone has $N$ independent release sites. The release of a vesicle at any given site $i$ (for $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$) is a random event. We can model this with a set of random variables. Let $X_i$ be the random variable for release at site $i$, such that:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if a vesicle is released} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if no vesicle is released} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that these events are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials with a success probability of $p$. Therefore, the probability mass function for each $X_i$ is $P(X_i=1) = p$ and $P(X_i=0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe current generated by a single release event is $q$. Thus, the current contributed by site $i$ is $q \\cdot X_i$. The total EPSC amplitude, which we shall denote as $I$, is the linear sum of the currents from all $N$ sites:\n$$\nI = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} q \\cdot X_i\n$$\nWe are asked to find the expected EPSC amplitude, $E[I]$. Using the expression for $I$:\n$$\nE[I] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} q \\cdot X_i\\right]\n$$\nSince $q$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\nE[I] = q \\cdot E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right]\n$$\nThe problem explicitly requires the use of the linearity of expectation. This property states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations, regardless of whether they are independent. Applying this property:\n$$\nE[I] = q \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]\n$$\nNow, we must find the expectation of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$. By definition, the expected value is:\n$$\nE[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i=1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i=0) = (1) \\cdot p + (0) \\cdot (1-p) = p\n$$\nSince the release events are identically distributed, the expectation $E[X_i]$ is equal to $p$ for all sites from $i=1$ to $N$. Substituting this result back into the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p = Np\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this sum back into the expression for the expected total current, $E[I]$:\n$$\nE[I] = q \\cdot (Np) = Npq\n$$\nThis is the expression for the expected EPSC amplitude based on the given assumptions and derived using the linearity of expectation.\n\n2) Calculation of the fold-change and interpretation.\n\nThe baseline expected EPSC amplitude, which we denote $E_{base}$, is given by the expression derived above:\n$$\nE_{base} = Npq\n$$\nAn experimental manipulation alters the number of release sites and the per-site release probability. The new number of sites, $N'$, is $1.3$ times the baseline number, $N$:\n$$\nN' = 1.3N\n$$\nThe new per-site release probability, $p'$, is $0.8$ times the baseline probability, $p$:\n$$\np' = 0.8p\n$$\nThe quantal amplitude $q$ remains unchanged, so $q' = q$.\n\nThe new expected EPSC amplitude, $E_{new}$, can be calculated using our derived formula with the new parameters:\n$$\nE_{new} = N'p'q' = (1.3N)(0.8p)(q)\n$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can express $E_{new}$ in terms of $E_{base}$:\n$$\nE_{new} = (1.3 \\times 0.8) \\cdot (Npq)\n$$\nCalculating the product of the numerical factors:\n$$\n1.3 \\times 0.8 = 1.04\n$$\nTherefore, the new expected amplitude is:\n$$\nE_{new} = 1.04 \\cdot (Npq) = 1.04 \\cdot E_{base}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative fold-change, defined as the ratio of the new expected EPSC amplitude to the baseline expected EPSC amplitude:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{E_{new}}{E_{base}} = \\frac{1.04 \\cdot E_{base}}{E_{base}} = 1.04\n$$\nThe fold-change is a unitless quantity with a value of $1.04$.\n\nThe fold-change of $1.04$ indicates a net potentiation, or a $4\\%$ increase, in the expected synaptic strength. This outcome demonstrates that the structural enhancement of the active zone, specifically the $30\\%$ increase in the number of release sites, more than compensates for the functional reduction in release efficacy, the $20\\%$ decrease in per-site release probability, leading to an overall stronger synapse.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.04}\n$$", "id": "2739508"}, {"introduction": "The release probability, $p$, is not a fixed value but is exquisitely sensitive to the precise nanoscale organization of calcium channels around a docked vesicle.

Consider a nanodomain arrangement in which $N$ identical Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs) are tightly and symmetrically coupled to the vesicle at the same distance $r$, and during a single action potential all $N$ VGCCs open synchronously with identical single-channel calcium flux and open time.

It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. We shall proceed with its formal analysis.\n\nLet $p$ be the instantaneous release probability of the synaptic vesicle, let $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ be the local calcium concentration at the sensor, and let $N$ be the number of synchronously open Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs).\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental relationships. First, the release probability is proportional to the $n$-th power of the calcium concentration, with a cooperativity coefficient $n=3$. We express this as:\n$$p = k_1 [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}$$\nwhere $k_1$ is a constant of proportionality and the given value for the cooperativity is $n=3$. Thus,\n$$p = k_1 [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{3}$$\n\nSecond, the problem states that under the assumptions of linear diffusion and superposition, the peak calcium concentration at the sensor location scales linearly with the number of simultaneously open channels, $N$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = k_2 N$$\nHere, $k_2$ is a second constant of proportionality that encapsulates all parameters related to the single-channel calcium flux, the fixed distance $r$ from the channels to the sensor, and the properties of the diffusion medium, including linear buffering. The problem's premise that the coupling geometry and channel properties are unchanged implies that $k_2$ is constant as $N$ is varied.\n\nWe can combine these two relationships to express the release probability $p$ directly as a function of the number of channels $N$. Substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = k_1 (k_2 N)^{3} = k_1 k_2^{3} N^{3}$$\nLet us define a new composite constant $K = k_1 k_2^{3}$. This constant $K$ is fixed for the given system. The relationship between release probability and the number of channels is therefore:\n$$p(N) = K N^{3}$$\nThis shows that the release probability scales with the cube of the number of co-localized, synchronously active calcium channels.\n\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative factor, $F$, by which the number of channels must be increased to double the release probability. Let the initial state be characterized by a number of channels $N_1$ and a corresponding release probability $p_1$. From our derived equation:\n$$p_1 = K N_1^{3}$$\n\nLet the final state be characterized by a new number of channels, $N_2$, and a release probability $p_2$. The condition given in the problem is that the release probability is doubled, so:\n$$p_2 = 2 p_1$$\nThe release probability in the final state is given by:\n$$p_2 = K N_2^{3}$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $p_1$ and $p_2$ into the condition $p_2 = 2 p_1$, we obtain:\n$$K N_2^{3} = 2 (K N_1^{3})$$\n\nSince a non-zero probability is implied, the constant $K$ is non-zero and can be canceled from both sides of the equation, yielding:\n$$N_2^{3} = 2 N_1^{3}$$\n\nThe problem defines the required multiplicative factor as $F = \\frac{N_2}{N_1}$. To find $F$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\\frac{N_2^{3}}{N_1^{3}} = 2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{N_2}{N_1}\\right)^{3} = 2$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of $F$ into this equation gives:\n$$F^{3} = 2$$\n\nTo find the value of $F$, we take the cube root of both sides.

No site releases more than one vesicle (univesicular release).\n$3$. The number of released vesicles, $k$, in a given trial follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim B(N, p)$.\n$4$.

Thus, $N=25.0$ and $p=0.700$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for a qualitative explanation of how structural heterogeneity would bias these estimates. The assumed model is homogeneous, with uniform quantal size $q$ and release probability $p$ across all $N$ sites.\n\n$1$. **Heterogeneity in release probability ($p_i$)**: If release probabilities vary across sites (e.g., due to different coupling distances between release sites and calcium channels), while quantal size remains uniform, the synaptic variance for a given mean current is reduced. The variance for a heterogeneous set of probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$ is $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) = q^2 N(\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) - \\sigma_p^2)$, where $\\bar{p}$ is the mean probability and $\\sigma_p^2$ is its variance. This is lower than the variance for a homogeneous synapse with probability $\\bar{p}$. The mean-variance parabola is shifted downwards. When fitting this reduced-variance data to a homogeneous model, the curvature of the parabola appears less pronounced than it should for the true number of sites. This leads to an **underestimation of the number of sites $N$**.\n\n$2$. **Heterogeneity in quantal size ($q_i$)**: If quantal sizes vary across sites (e.g., due to differences in vesicle-filling or postsynaptic receptor density), while release probability $p$ is uniform, the effective quantal size and the variance are both inflated. The mean-variance relationship becomes $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) \\approx \\bar{q}(1+CV_q^2)\\langle I \\rangle - \\frac{(1+CV_q^2)}{N}\\langle I \\rangle^2$, where $\\bar{q}$ is the mean quantal size and $CV_q$ is its coefficient of variation. The analysis would estimate an apparent quantal size $q_{est} = \\bar{q}(1+CV_q^2)$ from the initial slope, which is an overestimation of the true mean $\\bar{q}$. Simultaneously, it would estimate the number of sites as $N_{est} = N/(1+CV_q^2)$, which is an **underestimation of the true number of sites $N$**.\n\nIn summary, both forms of heterogeneity described would lead to an underestimation of the number of functional release sites $N$ when analyzed with a simple, homogeneous binomial model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n25.0 & 0.700\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2739534"}]}
