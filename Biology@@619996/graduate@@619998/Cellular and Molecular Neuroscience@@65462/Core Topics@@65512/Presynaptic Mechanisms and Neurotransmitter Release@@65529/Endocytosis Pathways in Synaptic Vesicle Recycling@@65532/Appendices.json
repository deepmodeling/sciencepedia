The problem is objective, complete, and contains no contradictions or scientifically invalid assumptions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fluorescence reporter is a monoprotic acid, which we denote as $HA$. It exists in equilibrium with its deprotonated (conjugate base) form, $A^-$, according to the reaction:\n$$\nHA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-\n$$\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes the relationship between $pH$, $pK_a$, and the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base:\n$$\npH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that fluorescence, $F$, is proportional to the fraction of deprotonated reporter molecules. Let us define this fraction, $\\alpha$, as:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA] + [A^-]}\n$$\nThus, $F = k \\cdot \\alpha$ for some proportionality constant $k$. To derive the dependence of fluorescence on $pH$ and $pK_a$, we must express $\\alpha$ as a function of these variables. From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can write the ratio of the concentrations as:\n$$\n\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}\n$$\nNow, we can rewrite the expression for $\\alpha$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio gives the dependence of $\\alpha$ (and thus fluorescence) on $pH$ and $pK_a$:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH) = \\frac{10^{(pH - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\n$$\nThis can be written in the equivalent and often more convenient sigmoidal form:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH) = \\frac{1}{10^{(pK_a - pH)} + 1}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the proportional dependence of fluorescence on $pH$ and $pK_a$.

Therefore, implement orthogonal, target-selective and acute genetic tests: neuron-specific conditional double knockout of dynamin-1 and dynamin-3 in the mature brain (e.g., Cre recombinase activated post-development), acute sequestration of adaptor protein 2 via rapamycin-inducible “knocksideways,” and auxin-inducible degron–mediated acute degradation of clathrin heavy chain.

This means targeting different components of the same pathway (e.g., both clathrin coat formation and scission) using different methods.\n    4.  **Rescue**: The \"gold standard\" to prove an effect is on-target is to perform a rescue experiment, where function is restored by re-expressing a wild-type version of the protein that is immune to the initial perturbation.\n    5.  **Multi-modal Readout**: Combining functional data ($\\tau_{\\text{endo}}$) with structural data (electron microscopy to visualize coated pits, endosomes, etc.) provides a much more complete picture than either method alone.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.

No additional controls are necessary beyond vehicle.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It willfully ignores the foundational fact that these inhibitors have poor specificity.

It proposes an excellent set of orthogonal, specific, and acutely inducible genetic perturbations targeting the most relevant proteins (presynaptic dynamins, the core AP-2 adaptor, and clathrin itself). It correctly includes the principles of rescue experiments to confirm specificity and the use of both functional and structural readouts. The interpretive framework is logical and sound. The minor imprecision in describing the rescue (\"RNA interference–resistant wild-type allele\" is more specific to RNAi, but the principle of rescue is correctly invoked) does not detract from the overwhelming correctness of the proposed strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C.

Genetic manipulations targeting clathrin or adaptor protein 2 are unnecessary because cholesterol is required for clathrin-coated pits.**\nThis option is deeply flawed. Methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin is a notoriously non-specific tool that disrupts the entire plasma membrane, affecting nearly all forms of trafficking, not just CME. It cannot be considered a \"selective CME probe.\" While caveolar endocytosis is likely not a major pathway here, ruling it out does not prove CME is the default. The assertion that direct genetic targeting of clathrin or AP-2 is \"unnecessary\" is antithetical to rigorous science and ignores the most specific tools available.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Overexpress the clathrin heavy chain “hub” fragment stably for $4$ weeks to inhibit clathrin function and, in parallel, apply chlorpromazine chronically to maintain adaptor protein 2 at the plasma membrane. If both conditions slow $\\tau_{\\text{endo}}$, conclude CME is required; any cytotoxicity is acceptable because it reflects strong pathway inhibition rather than off-target effects.**\nThis option contains multiple severe errors. A $4$-week stable expression is a chronic perturbation, which invites confounding compensatory changes, violating the principle of acute temporal control. Chronic application of a non-specific and toxic drug like chlorpromazine is poor experimental design. The statement that \"any cytotoxicity is acceptable\" is scientifically indefensible. Cytotoxicity compromises cellular health and makes it impossible to interpret effects on a specific physiological process. It is a hallmark of off-target effects or system failure, not a sign of successful pathway inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Knock out dynamin-2 only, because it is ubiquitous and therefore must carry synaptic endocytosis, and use Pitstop at a lower dose to avoid off-target effects. If either manipulation slows $\\tau_{\\text{endo}}$, attribute the effect to CME specifically, since dynamin-2 acts downstream of clathrin in synapses.**\nThe reasoning in this option is faulty. The problem states that dynamin-1 and -3 are dominant at presynapses, making them the more relevant targets than the less abundant dynamin-2. The logic that ubiquity implies primary function in a specialized compartment is incorrect. Using Pitstop at a lower dose reduces but does not eliminate off-target concerns. Finally, attributing any dynamin-dependent phenotype solely to CME is an oversimplification, as dynamin is required for other endocytic pathways as well.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2709910"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems operate with finite resources, and at a synapse, the endocytic machinery can be overwhelmed by high rates of neurotransmission, potentially engaging different retrieval pathways.

A more specific condition, detailed balance, holds for this type of reversible chain, stating that the rate of flow between any two adjacent states must be equal in both directions:\n$$\nP_{n} \\lambda_{n} = P_{n+1} \\mu_{n+1} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, \\dots, c-1\n$$\nWe can use this relationship to express each $P_n$ in terms of $P_0$.\nFor $n=0$:\n$P_0 \\lambda_0 = P_1 \\mu_1 \\implies P_0 \\lambda = P_1 (1 \\cdot \\mu) \\implies P_1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} P_0$.\nFor $n=1$:\n$P_1 \\lambda_1 = P_2 \\mu_2 \\implies P_1 \\lambda = P_2 (2 \\cdot \\mu) \\implies P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu} P_1$.\nSubstituting the expression for $P_1$ gives:\n$P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} P_0\\right) = \\frac{1}{2!} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\\right)^2 P_0$.\n\nBy induction, we can establish the general relationship for any state $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, c\\}$:\n$$\nP_n = P_{n-1} \\frac{\\lambda_{n-1}}{\\mu_n} = P_{n-1} \\frac{\\lambda}{n\\mu}\n$$\nUnfolding this recurrence relation, we obtain:\n$$\nP_n = \\frac{\\lambda^n}{n! \\mu^n} P_0 = \\frac{(\\lambda/\\mu)^n}{n!} P_0\n$$\nThe problem defines the offered load, a dimensionless quantity, as $a = \\lambda / \\mu$. Substituting this definition yields:\n$$\nP_n = \\frac{a^n}{n!} P_0\n$$\nTo determine $P_0$, we use the normalization condition that the sum of probabilities over all possible states must be unity:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{c} P_k = 1\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $P_k$:\n$$\nP_0 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{c} \\frac{a^k}{k!} \\right) = 1\n$$\nThis allows us to solve for $P_0$:\n$$\nP_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{k=0}^{c} \\frac{a^k}{k!}}\n$$\nThe blocking probability, denoted $B(c,a)$, is the long-run fraction of arrivals that find all $c$ servers busy and are consequently diverted. For a Poisson arrival process, the PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) principle applies. This powerful result states that the proportion of arrivals that find the system in state $n$ is equal to the long-run proportion of time the system spends in state $n$, which is $P_n$. Therefore, the blocking probability is simply the steady-state probability of being in the blocking state, $c$.\n$$\nB(c,a) = P_c\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_c$ and $P_0$:\n$$\nB(c,a) = \\frac{a^c / c!}{\\sum_{k=0}^{c} \\frac{a^k}{k!}}\n$$\nThis is the Erlang-B formula, which completes the derivation required by the first task.\n\nThe second task is to compute the requested metrics for the four test cases. We apply the derived formula and the given definitions. All floating-point results are rounded to six decimal places.\n\nCase $1$: $(c=4, \\mu=6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}, f=20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}, \\alpha=0.7)$\n- Arrival rate: $\\lambda = \\alpha f = 0.7 \\cdot 20 = 14\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Offered load: $a = \\lambda / \\mu = 14 / 6 \\approx 2.333333$.\n- Saturation: Is $\\lambda \\ge c \\mu$?
