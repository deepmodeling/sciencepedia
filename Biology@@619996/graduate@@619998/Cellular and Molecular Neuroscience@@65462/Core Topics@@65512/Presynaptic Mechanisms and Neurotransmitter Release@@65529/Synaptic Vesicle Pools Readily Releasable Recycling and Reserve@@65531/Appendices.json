It is based on the established \"cumulative EPSC analysis\" method for estimating the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. All provided data and underlying principles are consistent with established neuroscientific theory and experimental practice. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: a derivation, a numerical calculation, and a justification of the method with a discussion of biases. These will be addressed in order.\n\n1. Derivation of the expression for the readily releasable pool size, $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$.\n\nThe cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), $C(n)$, after $n$ stimuli is the sum of the peak amplitudes of the individual EPSCs, $I(k)$, from the first to the $n$-th stimulus:\n$$\nC(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} I(k)\n$$\nThe amplitude of an individual EPSC, $I(k)$, is the product of the number of vesicles released, $v(k)$, and the mean current produced by a single vesicle, which is the quantal size $q$.\n$$\nI(k) = v(k) \\cdot q\n$$\nDuring a high-frequency stimulus train, vesicles are released from the readily releasable pool (RRP), causing its depletion. Simultaneously, the RRP is replenished from other vesicle pools (the recycling and reserve pools). After a sufficient number of stimuli, a steady state is approached where the rate of vesicle release is balanced by the rate of replenishment. In this steady state, the number of vesicles released per stimulus becomes approximately constant. Let this steady-state number be $v_{ss}$. The corresponding steady-state EPSC amplitude is $\\Delta I_{ss} = v_{ss} \\cdot q$.\n\nWhen this steady state is reached, the cumulative EPSC plot, $C(n)$ versus $n$, becomes linear for large $n$. The slope of this linear portion is the average current added per stimulus, which is $\\Delta I_{ss}$. A linear regression to this late portion of the plot gives a line of the form:\n$$\nL(n) = (\\Delta I_{ss}) \\cdot n + I_0\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ is the intercept on the current axis at $n=0$, obtained by back-extrapolating the linear fit.\n\nThe key insight of this method lies in the interpretation of the intercept $I_0$. This value represents the total current that would have been released from the RRP *if there had been no replenishment*. To see this, consider the total current measured at a late stimulus $n$, $C(n)$, which is well-approximated by $L(n)$. This total current is composed of two parts: the current from the initial RRP vesicles and the current from all vesicles that have been replenished and subsequently released up to that point. The total replenished current can be approximated as the steady-state release rate multiplied by the number of stimuli, which is $n \\cdot \\Delta I_{ss}$.\n\nThe intercept $I_0$ is mathematically equivalent to taking the cumulative current on the extrapolated line at stimulus $n$ and subtracting the total contribution from the steady-state process:\n$$\nI_0 = L(n) - (\\Delta I_{ss}) \\cdot n\n$$\nThis difference isolates the portion of the cumulative current that is in excess of what would be expected from replenishment alone. This excess is precisely the current that was generated by depleting the initial RRP. Therefore, $I_0$ serves as a direct measure of the total charge carrier capacity of the initial RRP, expressed in units of current.\n\nGiven that the total current capacity of the RRP is the product of the number of vesicles in the pool, $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$, and the current per vesicle, $q$, we have the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nI_0 = N_{\\mathrm{RRP}} \\cdot q\n$$\nFrom this, we derive the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{RRP}} = \\frac{I_0}{q}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for the first part of the problem.\n\n2. Calculation of $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nBack-extrapolated intercept, $I_0 = 3\\,\\mathrm{nA}$.\nQuantal size, $q = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nTo perform the calculation, the units must be consistent. We will convert both quantities to Amperes ($A$).\n$I_0 = 3\\,\\mathrm{nA} = 3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,A$.\n$q = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,A = 2 \\times 10^{-11}\\,A$.\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{RRP}} = \\frac{I_0}{q} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,A}{2 \\times 10^{-11}\\,A}\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{RRP}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 10^{(-9 - (-11))} = 1.5 \\times 10^{2} = 150\n$$\nThe result is a dimensionless quantity representing the number of vesicles, as required. The size of the readily releasable pool is $150$ vesicles.\n\n3. Justification and discussion of biases.\n\nThe validity of the back-extrapolation method rests on several key assumptions:\ni. The system reaches a true steady state where vesicle release and replenishment rates are equal and constant. The late part of the cumulative EPSC plot must be demonstrably linear.\nii. The quantal size, $q$, remains constant throughout the stimulus train. This implies the absence of significant postsynaptic factors such as receptor saturation or desensitization.\niii. Vesicle replenishment does not contribute significantly to release during the initial phase of RRP depletion. The model assumes replenishment becomes the dominant source of released vesicles only after the initial RRP has been substantially depleted.\niv. All vesicles within the RRP are functionally homogeneous, contributing equally to the total pool estimate.\n\nCondition that biases $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ low (underestimation):\nA primary factor that leads to an underestimation of $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ is **postsynaptic receptor desensitization**. During a high-frequency train, sustained exposure to glutamate can cause receptors to enter a desensitized, non-conducting state. This effectively reduces the quantal size $q$ for later stimuli in the train. The cumulative plot $C(n)$ will therefore rise more slowly than it would with a constant $q$, causing the slope of the late, linear portion ($\\Delta I_{ss}$) to be shallower. A shallower slope results in a back-extrapolated line that has a smaller intercept, $I_0$. Because $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}} = I_0/q$, the smaller calculated $I_0$ leads directly to an underestimation of the RRP size.\n\nCondition that biases $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ high (overestimation):\nAn overestimation of $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ can occur if there is **rapid vesicle replenishment that begins early in the stimulus train**. The model assumes that the initial, high levels of release are drawn exclusively from the standing RRP. However, if replenishment mechanisms are activated very quickly, some of the vesicles released even by the first few stimuli may be newly replenished ones. This \"contaminating\" release is not from the original RRP but is summed into the cumulative current $C(n)$. The method incorrectly attributes this early-replenished and released current to the initial pool, thereby inflating the curvature of the initial part of the plot. This leads to a larger back-extrapolated intercept $I_0$ and, consequently, an overestimation of $N_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{150}\n$$", "id": "2758010"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of a finite readily releasable pool (RRP), this exercise explores the dynamic consequences of vesicle depletion and replenishment.

This outcome is a direct consequence of the problem's premises: the first stimulus depletes the RRP, and the recovery process is not fast enough to fully replenish the pool before the second stimulus arrives. The number of vesicles available for the second release is thus smaller than for the first.

Assume the following first-principles base and operational assumptions.\n\n1. Quantal model and depletion without replenishment: there are $N_{\\mathrm{true}}$ readily releasable vesicles at $t=0$. On each pulse, each unreleased vesicle releases with probability $p_0$, independently across vesicles and across pulses. Therefore, the expected number of vesicles released on pulse $i$ is $n_i = p_0 (1-p_0)^{i-1} N_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and in the absence of replenishment, $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} n_i = N_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\n\n2.

AMPA receptor desensitization and recovery: a fraction $\\rho$ of AMPA receptors enters a desensitized state immediately after a large glutamate transient; the desensitized fraction recovers exponentially with time constant $\\tau$.

The parameters are within a plausible, albeit high-release-probability, physiological range for central synapses. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a quantitative solution.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle inconsistency in the definition of the receptor availability factor, $r_i$. The formula is given as $r_i = 1 - \\rho \\, e^{-(i-1)\\Delta t/\\tau}$. For the first pulse ($i=1$), this yields $r_1 = 1 - \\rho \\, e^0 = 1 - \\rho = 0.7$.

(valid when the first pulse dominates desensitization due to rapid depletion)\". This physical description implies the following sequence:\n1.  Before pulse $1$, all receptors are available, so the availability factor should be $r_1=1$.\n2.  Pulse $1$ causes a fraction $\\rho$ of receptors to desensitize.\n3.  Just before pulse $i$ (for $i>1$), which occurs at time $(i-1)\\Delta t$ after pulse $1$, the fraction of desensitized receptors has decayed from $\\rho$ to $\\rho e^{-(i-1)\\Delta t/\\tau}$.\n4.

I will proceed with this corrected model for $r_i$.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid, contingent on the clarification of the desensitization model as described above.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe goal is to calculate the fractional bias of the RRP estimate, $N_{\\mathrm{est}}/N_{\\mathrm{true}}$. The naive estimate is given by:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{est}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} I_i^{\\mathrm{meas}}}{q} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} q \\, n_i \\, S(n_i) \\, r_i}{q} = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} n_i \\, S(n_i) \\, r_i$$\nThe true RRP size is $N_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} n_i$. The bias arises from the factors $S(n_i)$ and $r_i$, which represent saturation and desensitization, respectively. Both factors are less than or equal to $1$, so we must expect $N_{\\mathrm{est}} < N_{\\mathrm{true}}$, indicating an underestimation.\n\nWe must calculate the terms of the series for $N_{\\mathrm{est}}$. The number of vesicles released on pulse $i$ is:\n$$n_i = p_0 (1-p_0)^{i-1} N_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.5 (1-0.5)^{i-1} \\times 100 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^i$$\nThe saturation factor for pulse $i$ is:\n$$S(n_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + n_i/n_s} = \\frac{1}{1 + n_i/20}$$\nThe receptor availability for pulse $i$, based on our validated model, is:\n$$r_1 = 1$$\n$$r_i = 1 - \\rho \\, e^{-(i-1)\\Delta t/\\tau} = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-(i-1)(10/20)} = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-0.5(i-1)} \\quad \\text{for } i > 1$$\n\nWe compute the first few terms of the sum for $N_{\\mathrm{est}}$:\n- **For $i = 1$**:\n  $n_1 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^1 = 50$\n  $S(n_1) = 1/(1 + 50/20) = 1/3.5 \\approx 0.2857$\n  $r_1 = 1$\n  Term 1: $n_1 S(n_1) r_1 = 50 \\times (1/3.5) \\times 1 \\approx 14.286$\n\n- **For $i = 2$**:\n  $n_2 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^2 = 25$\n  $S(n_2) = 1/(1 + 25/20) = 1/2.25 \\approx 0.4444$\n  $r_2 = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-0.5(1)} \\approx 1 - 0.3 \\times 0.6065 = 0.8180$\n  Term 2: $n_2 S(n_2) r_2 \\approx 25 \\times 0.4444 \\times 0.8180 \\approx 9.089$\n\n- **For $i = 3$**:\n  $n_3 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^3 = 12.5$\n  $S(n_3) = 1/(1 + 12.5/20) = 1/1.625 \\approx 0.6154$\n  $r_3 = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-0.5(2)} = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-1} \\approx 1 - 0.3 \\times 0.3679 = 0.8896$\n  Term 3: $n_3 S(n_3) r_3 \\approx 12.5 \\times 0.6154 \\times 0.8896 \\approx 6.843$\n\n- **For $i = 4$**:\n  $n_4 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^4 = 6.25$\n  $S(n_4) = 1/(1 + 6.25/20) = 1/1.3125 \\approx 0.7619$\n  $r_4 = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-0.5(3)} = 1 - 0.3 \\, e^{-1.5} \\approx 1 - 0.3 \\times 0.2231 = 0.9331$\n  Term 4: $n_4 S(n_4) r_4 \\approx 6.25 \\times 0.7619 \\times 0.9331 \\approx 4.443$\n\n- **For $i = 5$**:\n  $n_5 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^5 = 3.125$\n  $S(n_5) \\approx 0.8649$, $r_5 \\approx 0.9594$. Term 5 $\\approx 2.593$\n\n- **For $i = 6$**:\n  $n_6 = 100 \\cdot (0.5)^6 = 1.5625$\n  $S(n_6) \\approx 0.9275$, $r_6 \\approx 0.9754$. Term 6 $\\approx 1.414$\n\nThe terms of the series decrease rapidly. Summing the computed terms:\n$N_{\\mathrm{est}} \\approx 14.286 + 9.089 + 6.843 + 4.443 + 2.593 + 1.414 = 38.668$\nThe sum of subsequent terms is small. Let's add Term 7 ($\\approx 0.741$) and Term 8 ($\\approx 0.380$), which gives $N_{\\mathrm{est}} \\approx 39.789$.\nSo, $N_{\\mathrm{est}} \\approx 40$.\n\nThe ratio of the estimated RRP to the true RRP is:\n$$\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{est}}}{N_{\\mathrm{true}}} \\approx \\frac{40}{100} = 0.40$$\nThis means the RRP is underestimated, with the estimate being approximately $40\\%$ of the true value. The underestimation is $100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The RRP is underestimated by approximately $60\\%$ (i.e., $N_{\\mathrm{est}} \\approx 0.40 \\, N_{\\mathrm{true}}$); appropriate controls are a low-affinity competitive AMPA receptor antagonist such as $\\gamma$-D-glutamylglycine or kynurenic acid to linearize peak responses, together with cyclothiazide to block AMPA receptor desensitization; lowering extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can additionally reduce multivesicular release.**\n-   **Quantitative analysis**: My calculation gives $N_{\\mathrm{est}}/N_{\\mathrm{true}} \\approx 0.40$, corresponding to a $60\\%$ underestimation. This matches the option's claim.\n-   **Pharmacological analysis**: The two artifacts are receptor saturation and desensitization.\n    -   *Saturation*: A low-affinity competitive antagonist (like kynurenic acid) effectively raises the concentration of glutamate needed to activate receptors, linearizing the response to the high glutamate concentrations caused by multivesicular release. This is a standard and correct technique.\n    -   *Desensitization*: Cyclothiazide (CTZ) is a well-known positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors that specifically inhibits their desensitization. This is the correct agent to block this artifact.\n    -   *Additional control*: Lowering extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reduces presynaptic release probability ($p_0$), which reduces the number of vesicles released per pulse ($n_i$). Smaller $n_i$ values mitigate the saturation problem at its source. This is also a valid strategy.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The RRP is overestimated by approximately $25\\%$; appropriate controls are a high-affinity AMPA receptor antagonist such as CNQX and block of glutamate transporters with TBOA to prolong glutamate.**\n-   **Quantitative analysis**: The calculation shows a significant underestimation, not an overestimation. This is incorrect.\n-   **Pharmacological analysis**: A high-affinity antagonist like CNQX would substantially block the current, not linearize it for measurement. Blocking glutamate transporters with TBOA would prolong glutamate in the synaptic cleft, worsening both saturation and desensitization. These controls are counterproductive.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The RRP is underestimated by approximately $10\\%$; appropriate controls are MK-801 to block $N$-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and gabazine to block $\\mathrm{GABA}_A$ receptors.**\n-   **Quantitative analysis**: The underestimation is approximately $60\\%$, not $10\\%$. This is incorrect.\n-   **Pharmacological analysis**: MK-801 blocks NMDA receptors and gabazine blocks GABA_A receptors. While these might be used in an experiment to isolate AMPA receptor currents from other synaptic components, they do not address the specific artifacts of AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization, which are the sources of bias in this problem.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The estimate is accurate within $5\\%$; no pharmacological controls are necessary if $p_0$ is high.**\n-   **Quantitative analysis**: The error is approximately $60\\%$, far greater than $5\\%$. This is incorrect.\n-   **Mechanistic analysis**: The statement that no controls are needed if $p_0$ is high is fundamentally wrong. A high $p_0$ causes large numbers of vesicles to be released simultaneously, which is the direct cause of the severe saturation and desensitization artifacts. A low $p_0$ would have resulted in a more accurate estimate.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2757961"}]}
