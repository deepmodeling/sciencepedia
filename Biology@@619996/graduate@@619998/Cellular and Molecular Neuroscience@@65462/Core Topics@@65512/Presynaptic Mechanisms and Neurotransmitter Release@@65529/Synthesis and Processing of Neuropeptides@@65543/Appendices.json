ProNP contains canonical dibasic cleavage sites and ends with a glycine required for C-terminal amidation.

They interpret the signal as evidence of physiological processing. You are asked to evaluate the limitations of this approach and identify appropriate controls that would establish whether the detected products reflect bona fide neuropeptide maturation.\n\nBase your reasoning on the following well-tested principles and facts in cellular and molecular neuroscience: the Central Dogma, the organization of the secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi to trans-Golgi network), the existence of regulated secretory granules (dense-core vesicles, DCVs) versus constitutive secretion, the compartmentalization and specificity of proprotein convertases (for example, prohormone convertase 1/3 and prohormone convertase 2 versus furin), the requirement for an acidic lumen (approximately $\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 5.5$ to $\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 6.0$) and calcium for endoproteolysis, trimming by carboxypeptidase E, and C-terminal amidation by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM).

Select all that apply.\n\nA. Overexpressed ProNP in HEK293 cells will encounter endogenous furin in the trans-Golgi network, favoring constitutive secretion and potentially non-physiological cleavage patterns; therefore, peptide product identity should be validated by mass spectrometry against products generated in a neuroendocrine positive-control cell (for example, AtT-20 or PC-12), and by testing whether co-expression of prohormone convertase 1/3, prohormone convertase 2, 7B2 and proSAAS shifts the product profile toward the expected neuroendocrine pattern.\n\nB. Because HEK293 cells lack regulated secretory granules, any processed peptide is expected to be released constitutively rather than in a stimulus-dependent manner; therefore, regulated exocytosis should be assayed by comparing basal secretion to high $K^+$-evoked secretion or a secretagogue in a neuroendocrine positive-control line, with the expectation that only physiologically processed peptide pools exhibit a stimulus-dependent increase.\n\nC. High-level expression of ProNP ensures accurate maturation even without DCVs, so an ELISA signal in the medium is sufficient evidence of physiological processing; no additional controls are necessary provided that the ELISA detects the predicted sequence.\n\nD.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe core issue is the use of a non-neuroendocrine cell line (HEK293) to study a uniquely neuroendocrine process (neuropeptide maturation). Physiological neuropeptide processing is a multi-step process that is both spatially and temporally segregated within the regulated secretory pathway, culminating in storage within DCVs for stimulus-dependent release.\n\nThe provided assumptions establish that HEK293 cells lack this specialized machinery.\n$1$. **Sorting and Trafficking**: ProNP, upon entering the secretory pathway via its signal peptide, will be trafficked through the ER and Golgi. In the TGN, lacking the signals or machinery for sorting into DCVs (which are themselves deficient in HEK293 cells), ProNP will be directed into the constitutive secretory pathway. This means it will be packaged into vesicles that move directly to the plasma membrane for immediate, unregulated release.\n$2$. **Enzymatic Processing**: The specific enzymes for neuropeptide maturation—PC$1/3$, PC$2$, CPE, and PAM—are typically co-packaged into DCVs where the acidic lumen ($\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 5.5$) and high calcium concentration create an optimal environment for their activity. In HEK293 cells, the precursor will instead encounter furin, a ubiquitous convertase in the TGN. Furin recognizes dibasic sites but may have different specificity, leading to non-physiological cleavage products. The environment of the constitutive pathway is not optimized for PC$1/3$/PC$2$, CPE, or PAM activity, even if they were present.\n$3$. **Detection Method**: The ELISA method detects an epitope but provides no structural information. It cannot distinguish between the authentic, fully processed neuropeptide and various other forms, such as the unprocessed precursor, partially cleaved intermediates, or incorrectly cleaved products, all of which might be secreted into the medium and potentially contain the epitope recognized by the antibody.\n$4$. **Overexpression**: High-level expression can saturate the endogenous processing enzymes (like furin), leading to the secretion of a large amount of unprocessed or partially processed precursor, further confounding interpretation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the experiment is fundamentally flawed, and the team's conclusion is premature and likely incorrect. Appropriate controls must address these specific deficiencies.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Overexpressed ProNP in HEK293 cells will encounter endogenous furin in the trans-Golgi network, favoring constitutive secretion and potentially non-physiological cleavage patterns; therefore, peptide product identity should be validated by mass spectrometry against products generated in a neuroendocrine positive-control cell (for example, AtT-20 or PC-12), and by testing whether co-expression of prohormone convertase 1/3, prohormone convertase 2, 7B2 and proSAAS shifts the product profile toward the expected neuroendocrine pattern.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the problem of aberrant cleavage by furin in the constitutive pathway. The proposed controls are impeccable. Mass spectrometry is the gold standard for verifying the exact molecular weight and sequence of the peptide products, resolving the ambiguity of an ELISA. Comparing these products to those generated in a proper neuroendocrine cell line (AtT-20 or PC-12), which possesses the complete regulated secretory machinery, is a necessary positive control. Furthermore, attempting to reconstitute the physiological pathway in HEK293 cells by co-expressing the correct convertases (PC$1/3$, PC$2$) and their associated modulators ($7\\mathrm{B}2$, proSAAS) is a powerful method to demonstrate that these specific enzymes are required for proper processing.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because HEK293 cells lack regulated secretory granules, any processed peptide is expected to be released constitutively rather than in a stimulus-dependent manner; therefore, regulated exocytosis should be assayed by comparing basal secretion to high $K^+$-evoked secretion or a secretagogue in a neuroendocrine positive-control line, with the expectation that only physiologically processed peptide pools exhibit a stimulus-dependent increase.**\nThis statement correctly identifies a key functional difference: constitutive versus regulated release. A hallmark of mature neuropeptides is their storage in DCVs and release only upon specific stimulation (e.g., depolarization by high extracellular $K^+$). Since HEK293 cells lack this pathway, any detected peptide will be released constitutively. The proposed control, a stimulus-secretion coupling assay in a positive-control neuroendocrine cell line, directly tests for this physiological property. This is a critical experiment to distinguish between simple secretion and bona fide neuropeptide biology.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. High-level expression of ProNP ensures accurate maturation even without DCVs, so an ELISA signal in the medium is sufficient evidence of physiological processing; no additional controls are necessary provided that the ELISA detects the predicted sequence.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. According to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, high substrate (ProNP) concentration is likely to saturate the limited processing enzymes, leading to *incomplete*, not accurate, maturation. Furthermore, as discussed, an ELISA signal is insufficient evidence of correct processing due to its lack of structural specificity. This statement reflects a naive and incorrect understanding of the underlying cell biology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. ProNP processing relies primarily on the cytosolic proteasome; thus, adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 would increase mature peptide yield and validate the processing pathway in HEK293 cells.**\nThis premise is false. ProNP is a precursor for a secreted peptide, so it is synthesized on ER-bound ribosomes and translocated into the lumen of the secretory pathway. Its processing occurs within the compartments of this pathway (TGN, DCVs). The proteasome is a cytosolic/nuclear complex responsible for degrading cytosolic proteins. While it is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded secretory proteins, this is a quality control mechanism, not the maturation pathway. Inhibiting the proteasome would not validate the physiological processing of a neuropeptide.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Proper maturation of many neuropeptides requires an acidic DCV lumen and carboxypeptidase E for trimming, followed by C-terminal amidation by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase; therefore, as a control, show acidification-dependence (for example, sensitivity to bafilomycin A1) and co-express peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase and carboxypeptidase E while verifying colocalization with DCV markers (for example, chromogranin A) in a regulated secretory cell, then compare to HEK293.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the crucial downstream processing steps (trimming by CPE, amidation by PAM) and the required acidic environment of the DCV. The proposed controls are highly relevant. Using bafilomycin A1, a V-type H$^+$-ATPase inhibitor, to block vesicular acidification and observe an inhibition of processing would demonstrate the requirement for an acidic lumen. Co-expressing CPE and PAM is a valid reconstitution experiment to see if these specific enzymes are a limiting factor in HEK293 cells. Finally, demonstrating colocalization of the processing machinery with DCV markers (like chromogranin A) in a proper neuroendocrine cell line is essential to establish the correct subcellular context, which is absent in HEK293 cells.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. The presence of an N-terminal signal peptide in ProNP guarantees sorting into DCVs in HEK293 cells; thus, stimulus-dependent release will be observed without additional manipulation.**\nThis statement is false. An N-terminal signal peptide targets a protein for co-translational translocation into the ER, initiating its entry into the entire secretory pathway. It does not, by itself, contain the sorting information for the regulated secretory pathway (i.e., for entry into DCVs at the TGN). Moreover, HEK293 cells largely lack the ability to form DCVs in the first place. Therefore, the conclusion that stimulus-dependent release will be observed is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**G. To distinguish physiological, intragranular processing from non-physiological cleavage en route to the plasma membrane, perform pulse–chase metabolic labeling to measure the kinetics of conversion and release; physiological processing should show a temporal delay for conversion within storage granules and a releasable pool that increases selectively upon stimulation.**\nThis statement proposes a powerful kinetic experiment to differentiate the two pathways. Pulse-chase analysis tracks a cohort of newly synthesized proteins over time. The constitutive pathway is rapid, with newly synthesized proteins appearing in the medium with minimal delay. The regulated pathway involves a significant lag time as precursors are processed and packaged into a storage pool (DCVs). This stored pool is then released in a burst upon stimulation. Measuring these distinct kinetic profiles is a rigorous method to distinguish constitutive secretion from physiological processing and storage.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**H. N-linked glycosylation is the sole determinant of sorting into the regulated secretory pathway; therefore, inhibiting glycosylation with tunicamycin will abolish neuropeptide production and serves as a definitive control for physiological processing.**\nThe premise is false. While N-linked glycosylation can be important for the folding and stability of some protein precursors, it is not the \"sole determinant\" for sorting into DCVs. The leading model for sorting of many neuropeptide precursors is sorting-by-aggregation within the TGN lumen. Inhibiting glycosylation with tunicamycin is a blunt tool that can cause widespread protein misfolding and would not serve as a specific or definitive control for sorting into the regulated pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABEG}$$", "id": "2758704"}]}
