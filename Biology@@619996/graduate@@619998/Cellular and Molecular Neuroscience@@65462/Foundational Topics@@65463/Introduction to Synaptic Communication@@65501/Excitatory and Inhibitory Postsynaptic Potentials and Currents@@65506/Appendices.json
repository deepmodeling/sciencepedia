It is scientifically grounded in established principles of cellular neuroscience, mathematically well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time-to-peak, $t_{\\text{peak}}$, for a synaptic current $I_{s}(t)$. The current is given by the expression $I_{s}(t) = g_{s}(t)\\,(V - E_{s})$. The driving force, $(V - E_{s})$, is stated to be approximately constant over the relevant timescale. The synaptic conductance, $g_{s}(t)$, is given for $t \\ge 0$ by the difference-of-exponentials function:\n$$\ng_{s}(t) = g_{0}\\,\\big[\\exp(-t/\\tau_{d}) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_{r})\\big]\n$$\nwhere $g_{0} > 0$ and the time constants satisfy $\\tau_{d} > \\tau_{r} > 0$.\n\nFor a glutamatergic excitatory synapse, the reversal potential $E_{s}$ is typically close to $0\\,\\text{mV}$. The membrane potential $V$ of a neuron at rest is negative (e.g., $-65\\,\\text{mV}$). Therefore, the driving force $(V - E_{s})$ is a negative constant. Let us examine the sign of the conductance term in the square brackets. Since $\\tau_{d} > \\tau_{r} > 0$, it follows that for any $t > 0$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\tau_{d}} < \\frac{1}{\\tau_{r}}$, which implies $-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{d}} > -\\frac{t}{\\tau_{r}}$. Because the exponential function is strictly increasing, we have $\\exp(-t/\\tau_{d}) > \\exp(-t/\\tau_{r})$. Consequently, the term $\\big[\\exp(-t/\\tau_{d}) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_{r})\\big]$ is positive for all $t > 0$. Since $g_{0} > 0$, the conductance $g_{s}(t)$ is a positive function for $t > 0$.\n\nThe total synaptic current $I_{s}(t)$ is the product of a positive function $g_{s}(t)$ and a negative constant $(V - E_{s})$, resulting in a negative current (an inward flow of positive charge). The \"peak\" of this excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) corresponds to its maximum magnitude, which means its most negative value. This occurs precisely when the conductance $g_{s}(t)$ reaches its maximum value. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the time $t$ at which $g_{s}(t)$ is maximized.\n\nTo find the maximum of $g_{s}(t)$, we compute its derivative with respect to time $t$ and set it to zero.

We shall proceed in three parts as requested: first, the mechanism of chloride accumulation; second, the derivation of the chloride equilibrium potential; and third, the calculation of the shift in the GABA reversal potential.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanism. The Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter 2 (KCC2) is a member of the solute carrier family $12$ (SLC12) and functions as a secondary active transporter. It couples the electroneutral efflux of one potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) and one chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) from the neuron. The energy for this transport process is not derived directly from ATP hydrolysis but from the electrochemical gradient of potassium, which is established and maintained by the primary active transporter, the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase. In a mature neuron, the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase actively pumps $\\text{K}^+$ into the cell, creating a high intracellular potassium concentration relative to the outside. This results in a strong outward-directed concentration gradient for $\\text{K}^+$. KCC2 harnesses the energy stored in this gradient to drive the extrusion of $\\text{Cl}^-$ from the cell, even against its own concentration gradient. This active extrusion is what maintains the low intracellular chloride concentration ($[\\text{Cl}^-]_i$) characteristic of mature neurons. When KCC2 expression is reduced, its transport capacity is diminished. The primary mechanism for active chloride extrusion is therefore compromised. Consequently, the passive influx of chloride through other leak channels and transporters is no longer adequately counteracted. This leads to a net accumulation of chloride inside the cell, causing the resting $[\\text{Cl}^-]_i$ to rise until a new, higher steady-state concentration is reached.\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the chloride equilibrium potential, which is equivalent to the Nernst potential for chloride, $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. The problem states that the GABA reversal potential $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ can be approximated by $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ as the GABA$_A$ receptor channel is selectively permeable to chloride.
