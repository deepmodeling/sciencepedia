The gap junctions are formed by Connexin-36 (Cx36) channels. Assume ohmic behavior over the small command voltage and that each intercellular gap-junction channel contributes a constant unitary conductance. The following data are obtained at steady state: a junctional current $I_j = 16.2$ pA is measured at a transjunctional voltage $V_j = 9.0$ mV.

This will be accomplished by a sequential application of fundamental principles stated in the problem.\n\nFirst, we determine the junctional conductance, $G_j$. The problem states that the junction exhibits ohmic behavior, which is described by Ohm's law. For a conductive element, Ohm's law relates the current $I$ passing through it to the voltage $V$ across it and its conductance $G$ by the equation $I = G V$. For the gap junction, this becomes:\n$$I_j = G_j V_j$$\nwhere $I_j$ is the junctional current and $V_j$ is the transjunctional voltage. We are given $I_j = 16.2$ pA and $V_j = 9.0$ mV. To find $G_j$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$G_j = \\frac{I_j}{V_j}$$\nWe must use consistent SI units for the calculation. The prefix pico (p) corresponds to a factor of $10^{-12}$, and milli (m) corresponds to $10^{-3}$.\n$$G_j = \\frac{16.2 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ A}}{9.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ S}$$\nThe unit of conductance is the Siemens (S). The problem asks for the result to be expressed in nanosiemens (nS), where the prefix nano (n) corresponds to a factor of $10^{-9}$. Therefore:\n$$G_j = 1.8 \\text{ nS}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the expected number of open channels, $N_{\\text{open}}$. The problem states that the total conductance of the junction is the sum of the conductances of the individual open channels, which are acting as independent conductors in parallel. This is the principle of conductance additivity. The total junctional conductance $G_j$ is the product of the number of open channels, $N_{\\text{open}}$, and the unitary conductance of a single channel, which we denote as $\\gamma_{ch}$.\n$$G_j = N_{\\text{open}} \\cdot \\gamma_{ch}$$\nWe are given the unitary conductance $\\gamma_{ch} = 12$ pS. We can solve for $N_{\\text{open}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{open}} = \\frac{G_j}{\\gamma_{ch}}$$\nUsing the value for $G_j$ calculated previously and ensuring consistent units (pico, p, is $10^{-12}$), we have:\n$$N_{\\text{open}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ S}}{12 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}} = \\frac{1.8}{12} \\times 10^3 = 0.15 \\times 1000 = 150$$\nThus, the expected number of open channels at steady state is $150$. As this is an expectation value, it is not required to be an integer, but in this specific case, the calculation yields an integer.\n\nThird, we estimate the total number of channels in the junctional plaque, $N_{\\text{total}}$. The open probability, $P_o$, is defined as the ratio of the expected number of open channels to the total number of channels available to open.\n$$P_o = \\frac{N_{\\text{open}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$$\nWe are given that for this transjunctional voltage, $P_o = 0.5$. We can rearrange this definition to solve for $N_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{open}}}{P_o}$$\nSubstituting the previously calculated value for $N_{\\text{open}}$ and the given value for $P_o$:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{150}{0.5} = 300$$\nWe estimate the total number of Connexin-36 channels in the junction to be $300$.\n\nThe three requested values are: $G_j = 1.8$ nS, $N_{\\text{open}} = 150$, and $N_{\\text{total}} = 300$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.8 & 150 & 300 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2706271"}, {"introduction": "Having quantified the properties of a single junction, we now place it within a functional circuit.

By Kirchhoff’s current law at each node, the algebraic sum of currents leaving the intracellular node equals the net injected current at that node. Using Ohm’s law, the current through any conductance equals that conductance times the voltage across it.\n\nFor neuron $1$, the membrane leak current to ground is $G_m V_1$, and the junctional current flowing from neuron $1$ to neuron $2$ is $G_j (V_1 - V_2)$.

The protocol must leverage their distinct properties: voltage-dependent rectification, sensitivity to extracellular divalent cations ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$), and sensitivity to specific pharmacological agents.\n\nThe provided facts establish the following key differences:\n1.  **Divalent Sensitivity**: Connexin hemichannel open probability ($P_o$) is low in physiological divalent concentrations but is strongly increased upon their removal. Panx1 channels are much less sensitive to physiological divalent concentrations. This provides the primary tool for selectively activating the connexin component.\n2.  **Rectification**: In low-divalent conditions, connexin hemichannels exhibit pronounced outward rectification (i.e., they pass current more easily in the outward direction, at positive potentials, than in the inward direction). Panx1 channels exhibit a quasi-linear or weakly outwardly rectifying current-voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship.\n3.  **Pharmacology**: Connexin hemichannels are potently blocked by lanthanides like $\\mathrm{La}^{3+}$. Panx1 channels are blocked by probenecid. Carbenoxolone blocks both and is therefore non-selective for this task.\n\nAn optimal protocol must systematically exploit these differences to isolate each current component. A logical approach involves:\n1.  Suppressing confounding endogenous currents (voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels).\n2.  Establishing a baseline $I$-$V$ relationship in a condition where one channel type (Panx1) is active and the other (connexin) is mostly quiescent.
