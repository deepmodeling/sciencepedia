We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the relationship between synaptic current, membrane potential, and reversal potential. The synaptic current, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, for a channel with conductance $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is given by the ohmic approximation:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{syn}} = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})\n$$\nHere, $V_m$ is the membrane potential and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the reversal potential for the specific ion channel or synapse. The conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is an intrinsically positive quantity. Therefore, the direction of the current is determined entirely by the sign of the driving force, which is the term $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$.\n\nThe problem states that positive current is defined as outward flow of positive charge. The change in membrane potential, $\\frac{dV_m}{dt}$, is related to the total ionic current, $I_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, by the equation $C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -I_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, where $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance, a positive constant. Upon activation of a synapse, the new current $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is introduced. Thus, the initial change in $V_m$ is governed by $\\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{syn}}}{C_m}$.\n\nFrom this relationship, we deduce the following:\n1.  If $I_{\\mathrm{syn}} > 0$ (outward current), then $\\frac{dV_m}{dt} < 0$. The membrane potential becomes more negative, which is hyperpolarization. This corresponds to an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n2.  If $I_{\\mathrm{syn}} < 0$ (inward current), then $\\frac{dV_m}{dt} > 0$. The membrane potential becomes more positive, which is depolarization. This corresponds to an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP).\n\nWe are given the initial membrane potential $V_m = -75\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.

The task is to determine if a neuron, described by a conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire model, will fire a spike in response to a specific synaptic input.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental principle of charge conservation. The rate of change of charge $Q$ on the membrane capacitance $C_m$ is equal to the total current flowing into the cell. As $Q = C_m V$, this is expressed as:\n$$\nC_m \\frac{dV}{dt} = I_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the membrane potential and $t$ is time.

According to the problem's definition, the firing probability $P_{\\mathrm{fire}}$ is $1$ if a spike occurs and $0$ otherwise. As no spike can occur, the firing probability is $0$. This result is independent of the specific values of $C_m$, $g_L$, $g_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, and $\\tau$, as long as they are physically meaningful (i.e., positive). The determinative factors are the hierarchy of potentials: $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} \\le E_{\\mathrm{rev}} < V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2747720"}]}
