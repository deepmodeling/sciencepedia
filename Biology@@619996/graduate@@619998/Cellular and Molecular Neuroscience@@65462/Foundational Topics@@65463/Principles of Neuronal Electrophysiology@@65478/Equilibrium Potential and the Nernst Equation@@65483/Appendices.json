The problem does not violate any fundamental principles and is not incomplete, contradictory, or trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species is the sum of its chemical potential, $\\mu$, and its electrical potential energy. For an ideal solution, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu} = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln[c] + zF\\phi $$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $[c]$ is the molar concentration of the ion, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\phi$ is the local electrical potential.\n\nAt thermodynamical equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition is met when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane (intracellular and extracellular compartments). For the potassium ion, $K^{+}$, this is stated as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{K, \\text{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{K, \\text{out}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the electrochemical potential for the intracellular (in) and extracellular (out) compartments gives:\n$$ \\mu_{K}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{\\text{in}} + z_{K}F\\phi_{\\text{in}} = \\mu_{K}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{\\text{out}} + z_{K}F\\phi_{\\text{out}} $$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_{K}^{\\circ}$ depends on the nature of the ion and the solvent, but not on the local concentration or potential, and thus it is identical on both sides and cancels out.\n$$ RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{\\text{in}} + z_{K}F\\phi_{\\text{in}} = RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{\\text{out}} + z_{K}F\\phi_{\\text{out}} $$\nOur objective is to find the equilibrium potential, which is the transmembrane potential difference $E_{K} = \\phi_{\\text{in}} - \\phi_{\\text{out}}$.

Since the membrane is permeable only to $K^{+}$, the efflux of these positive ions leaves behind a net negative charge inside the cell (uncompensated anions) and builds up a net positive charge on the immediate outer surface of the membrane. This separation of charge generates an electrical potential difference across the membrane, making the inside negative relative to the outside. This inside-negative electrical potential creates an electrical force that opposes the further efflux of positively charged $K^{+}$ ions. Equilibrium is reached when this inward electrical force exactly balances the outward chemical driving force. Therefore, the equilibrium potential $E_{K}$ must be negative.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically.

It is free of scientific flaws, ambiguities, and contradictions. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the calcium equilibrium potential, $E_{Ca}$. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of an ion must be equal on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{Ca}$, for the calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{Ca} = \\mu_{Ca} + z_{Ca} F \\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{Ca}$ is the chemical potential, $z_{Ca}=+2$ is the valence of calcium, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the local electric potential.\n\nFor an ideal dilute solute, the chemical potential is:\n$$\n\\mu_{Ca} = \\mu_{Ca}^0 + RT \\ln[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{Ca}^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ is the molar concentration.\n\nThe equilibrium condition is $\\tilde{\\mu}_{Ca, \\text{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{Ca, \\text{out}}$. Substituting the expressions for the electrochemical potential, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{Ca}^0 + RT \\ln[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{in}} + z_{Ca} F \\psi_{\\text{in}} = \\mu_{Ca}^0 + RT \\ln[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{out}} + z_{Ca} F \\psi_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential term $\\mu_{Ca}^0$ is identical on both sides and thus cancels.

The expression becomes:\n$$\nE_{Ca} = \\frac{RT}{z_{Ca}F} \\left( \\ln[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{out}} - u \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of $E_{Ca}$ with respect to $u$ is straightforward, as $\\ln[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{out}}$ is held constant for this operation:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\partial E_{Ca}}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left[ \\frac{RT}{z_{Ca}F} \\big(\\text{constant} - u\\big) \\right] = -\\frac{RT}{z_{Ca}F}\n$$\nThe sensitivity $S$ is remarkably independent of ion concentrations and depends only on fundamental constants, temperature, and ionic valence.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value of $S$.

The use of the GABA$_A$ reversal potential as a measure of $E_{Cl}$ is standard practice, as is the use of gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp to preserve $[Cl^-]_{in}$.

The problem is well-posed, asking for logical deductions based on a clear set of initial conditions and a specific hypothesis. The language is precise and objective. The problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe equilibrium potential for an ion is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$E_{ion} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}}$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $[ion]_{out}$ and $[ion]_{in}$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations (more accurately, activities) of the ion, respectively.\n\nFor the chloride ion ($Cl^-$), the valence $z$ is $-1$. Thus, the Nernst potential for chloride, $E_{Cl}$, is:\n$$E_{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{-1 \\cdot F} \\ln \\frac{[Cl^-]_{out}}{[Cl^-]_{in}} = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\frac{[Cl^-]_{out}}{[Cl^-]_{in}}$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$E_{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\frac{[Cl^-]_{in}}{[Cl^-]_{out}}$$\nFrom this final form, it is evident that $E_{Cl}$ varies directly with the natural logarithm of the ratio of intracellular to extracellular chloride concentration. A higher intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_{in}$, will result in a less negative (more depolarized) $E_{Cl}$. Conversely, a lower $[Cl^-]_{in}$ will result in a more negative (more hyperpolarized) $E_{Cl}$.\n\nThe problem states that in immature neurons, NKCC1 expression is high and KCC2 expression is low.\n- **NKCC1** is a cotransporter that moves one $Na^+$ ion, one $K^+$ ion, and two $Cl^-$ ions **into** the cell, using the electrochemical gradient of $Na^+$ as the primary driving force.\n- **KCC2** is a cotransporter that moves one $K^+$ ion and one $Cl^-$ ion **out of** the cell, using the electrochemical gradient of $K^+$ as the driving force.\n\nUnder the baseline condition of high NKCC1 and low KCC2 activity, there is a net influx of $Cl^-$ ions. This leads to an active accumulation of chloride inside the cell, such that $[Cl^-]_{in}$ is maintained at a level higher than would be dictated by passive distribution alone. This elevated $[Cl^-]_{in}$ results in a relatively depolarized $E_{Cl}$ (e.g., in the range of $-30$ mV to $-50$ mV), which is typically more positive than the resting membrane potential of these neurons.\n\nThe task is to evaluate experimental manipulations that directly test the role of NKCC1 and correctly predict the outcome. A direct test must involve a targeted perturbation of NKCC1 itself.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Acute bath application of bumetanide (a selective NKCC1 inhibitor at low micromolar concentrations) to immature neurons; $E_{Cl}$ shifts to more negative (hyperpolarized) potentials.**\n- **Manipulation Analysis**: Bumetanide is a specific inhibitor of NKCC1. Its application directly perturbs the function of NKCC1, constituting a direct test of the hypothesis.\n- **Predicted Effect**: Inhibiting NKCC1 will block the primary mechanism of active $Cl^-$ influx. The residual activity of chloride exporters (such as the low levels of KCC2) and passive efflux will lead to a net outward movement of $Cl^-$, causing $[Cl^-]_{in}$ to decrease.\n- **Impact on $E_{Cl}$**: According to the Nernst equation, $E_{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\frac{[Cl^-]_{in}}{[Cl^-]_{out}}$, a decrease in $[Cl^-]_{in}$ makes the argument of the logarithm smaller (and more negative), thus causing $E_{Cl}$ to become more negative (hyperpolarize).\n- **Verdict**: The manipulation is a direct test, and the predicted shift in $E_{Cl}$ is correct. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Acute bath application of bumetanide to immature neurons; $E_{Cl}$ shifts to more positive (depolarized) potentials.**\n- **Manipulation Analysis**: This is the same direct test as in option A.\n- **Predicted Effect**: As established above, inhibiting NKCC1 will cause $[Cl^-]_{in}$ to decrease, leading to a more negative (hyperpolarized) $E_{Cl}$.\n- **Impact on $E_{Cl}$**: The prediction that $E_{Cl}$ shifts to more positive potentials is the opposite of the correct biophysical consequence.\n- **Verdict**: The predicted outcome is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Overexpression of NKCC1 in immature neurons via viral transduction; $E_{Cl}$ shifts to more negative (hyperpolarized) potentials.**\n- **Manipulation Analysis**: Overexpressing NKCC1 is a valid and direct method to test its function by augmenting its activity.\n- **Predicted Effect**: Increasing the number of functional NKCC1 transporters on the cell membrane will enhance the rate of $Cl^-$ influx, causing $[Cl^-]_{in}$ to increase above its already high baseline level.\n- **Impact on $E_{Cl}$**: An increase in $[Cl^-]_{in}$ will make the ratio $\\frac{[Cl^-]_{in}}{[Cl^-]_{out}}$ larger, and its logarithm will become less negative. Consequently, $E_{Cl}$ will shift to a more positive (depolarized) potential.\n- **Verdict**: The predicted shift to more negative potentials is the opposite of the correct outcome. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of *Slc12a2* (the NKCC1 gene) in immature neurons; $E_{Cl}$ shifts to more negative (hyperpolarized) potentials.**\n- **Manipulation Analysis**: Using shRNA to knock down the gene encoding NKCC1 (*Slc12a2*) is a specific genetic manipulation that directly reduces the expression of the transporter. This is a direct test of its long-term contribution to chloride homeostasis.\n- **Predicted Effect**: Reduced expression of NKCC1 leads to a decrease in active $Cl^-$ influx. As in the case of pharmacological inhibition, this allows efflux mechanisms to dominate, resulting in a lower steady-state $[Cl^-]_{in}$.\n- **Impact on $E_{Cl}$**: A decrease in $[Cl^-]_{in}$ will cause $E_{Cl}$ to shift to more negative (hyperpolarized) potentials.\n- **Verdict**: The manipulation is a direct test, and the predicted shift in $E_{Cl}$ is correct. **Correct**.\n\n**E. Pharmacological inhibition of KCC2 with VU0463271 in immature neurons; $E_{Cl}$ shifts to more negative (hyperpolarized) potentials.**\n- **Manipulation Analysis**: This experiment perturbs KCC2, not NKCC1. The problem requires a manipulation that *directly tests the role of NKCC1*. While results from this experiment are relevant to the overall understanding of chloride homeostasis, it is not a direct test of the NKCC1 hypothesis. It is an indirect manipulation or a control.\n- **Predicted Effect**: Furthermore, let us evaluate the prediction. KCC2 is a chloride exporter. Inhibiting its (low baseline) activity would block a pathway for $Cl^-$ efflux. This would cause $[Cl^-]_{in}$ to increase slightly, as the influx from NKCC1 would be less opposed. An increase in $[Cl^-]_{in}$ would cause $E_{Cl}$ to shift to more positive (depolarized) potentials.\n- **Verdict**: This option is flawed on two counts. First, it is not a direct test of NKCC1's role. Second, the predicted shift is the opposite of the expected biophysical effect. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2710524"}]}
