All provided parameters are within physiologically realistic ranges, and the underlying principles are fundamental to biophysics. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe task is to analyze the thermodynamic equilibrium of the potassium–chloride cotransporter KCC2. KCC2 facilitates the electroneutral outward transport of one potassium ion ($K^+$) and one chloride ion ($Cl^-$). The net transport process for one cycle in the outward direction can be written as:\n$$\nK^{+}_{\\text{in}} + Cl^{-}_{\\text{in}} \\rightleftharpoons K^{+}_{\\text{out}} + Cl^{-}_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThe change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$, for this process determines the direction and magnitude of the net flux. It is calculated as the difference between the total chemical potential of the products (ions in the extracellular space) and the reactants (ions in the intracellular space).\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = (\\mu_{K,o} + \\mu_{Cl,o}) - (\\mu_{K,i} + \\mu_{Cl,i})\n$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = (\\mu_{K,o} - \\mu_{K,i}) + (\\mu_{Cl,o} - \\mu_{Cl,i})\n$$\nThe chemical potential $\\mu_j$ for an ionic species $j$ with valence $z_j$ and activity $a_j$ at a location with electric potential $\\psi$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{j} = \\mu_{j}^{0} + RT \\ln a_{j} + z_{j} F \\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. We will approximate activities $a_j$ with molar concentrations $[j]$.\n\nThe difference in chemical potential for $K^+$ between the outside ($o$) and inside ($i$) is:\n$$\n\\mu_{K,o} - \\mu_{K,i} = (\\mu_{K}^{0} + RT \\ln [K^+]_o + z_K F \\psi_o) - (\\mu_{K}^{0} + RT \\ln [K^+]_i + z_K F \\psi_i)\n$$\nThe standard potential $\\mu_K^0$ is identical in both compartments and cancels out.\n$$\n\\mu_{K,o} - \\mu_{K,i} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_o}{[K^+]_i}\\right) + z_K F (\\psi_o - \\psi_i)\n$$\nSimilarly, for $Cl^-$:\n$$\n\\mu_{Cl,o} - \\mu_{Cl,i} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Cl^-]_o}{[Cl^-]_i}\\right) + z_{Cl} F (\\psi_o - \\psi_i)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_o}{[K^+]_i}\\right) + z_K F (\\psi_o - \\psi_i) + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Cl^-]_o}{[Cl^-]_i}\\right) + z_{Cl} F (\\psi_o - \\psi_i)\n$$\nCombining terms:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_o [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_i}\\right) + (z_K + z_{Cl}) F (\\psi_o - \\psi_i)\n$$\nThe transporter is electroneutral, meaning there is no net charge movement per cycle.

Consequently, the electrical work term vanishes, as stated in the problem. The expression for the free energy change simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_o [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_i}\\right)\n$$\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, there is no net flux, which means the net free energy change for the transport cycle is zero ($\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = 0$).\n$$\nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_o [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_i}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFor this to be true, the argument of the natural logarithm must be $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{[K^+]_o [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_i} = 1\n$$\nThis leads to the equilibrium condition that defines the steady-state intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_i$, set by KCC2:\n$$\n[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_i = [K^+]_o [Cl^-]_o\n$$\n\nNext, we address the qualitative predictions. The \"outward KCC2 driving force\" is defined as $-\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$. A positive outward driving force corresponds to a negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$, promoting the extrusion of ions.\nInitially, the system is at equilibrium with $[K^+]_o = 4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. At this point, $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = 0$, and the driving force is zero. The initial intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{initial}}$, is determined by this equilibrium:\n$$\n[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{initial}} = \\frac{[K^+]_{o,\\text{initial}} [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i} = \\frac{(4\\,\\mathrm{mM})(130\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{140\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{520}{140}\\,\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{26}{7}\\,\\mathrm{mM}\n$$\nWhen $[K^+]_o$ is acutely elevated to $[K^+]_{o,\\text{final}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, we must evaluate the instantaneous change in $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$ before $[Cl^-]_i$ has adjusted.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_{o,\\text{final}} [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_{i,\\text{initial}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{initial}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_{o,\\text{final}} [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i \\left(\\frac{[K^+]_{o,\\text{initial}} [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i}\\right)}\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^+]_{o,\\text{final}}}{[K^+]_{o,\\text{initial}}}\\right)\n$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{4}\\right) = RT \\ln(2)\n$$\nSince $R > 0$ and $T > 0$, $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} > 0$. The outward driving force is $-\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = -RT \\ln(2)$, which is negative. The magnitude of the driving force is $|-\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}| = RT \\ln(2)$. Since the initial magnitude was $0$, the elevation of $[K^+]_o$ increases the magnitude of the driving force.\nA positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$ indicates that the reaction is spontaneous in the reverse (inward) direction. KCC2 will now transport $K^+$ and $Cl^-$ *into* the cell. This influx of chloride ions will cause the intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_i$, to increase. Therefore, the sign of the change in $[Cl^-]_i$ is positive.\n\nFinally, we compute the new steady-state intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{final}}$, after the system re-equilibrates with $[K^+]_o = 8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. We use the equilibrium condition derived earlier:\n$$\n[K^+]_i [Cl^-]_{i,\\text{final}} = [K^+]_{o,\\text{final}} [Cl^-]_o\n$$\nSolving for $[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{final}}$:\n$$\n[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{final}} = \\frac{[K^+]_{o,\\text{final}} [Cl^-]_o}{[K^+]_i}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n[Cl^-]_{i,\\text{final}} = \\frac{(8\\,\\mathrm{mM})(130\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{140\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{1040}{140}\\,\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{104}{14}\\,\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{52}{7}\\,\\mathrm{mM}\n$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $7.42857... \\,\\mathrm{mM}$.

It describes a common and non-trivial challenge in cellular neuroscience: a depolarizing shift in the reversal potential for $\\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_{\\text{A}}$) receptor-mediated currents, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$, has been observed, and the objective is to determine if this shift is attributable to a decrease in the activity of the Potassium–Chloride Cotransporter $2$ (KCC2). The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It correctly requires an analysis of confounding factors and the identification of a rigorous experimental strategy.\n\nWe begin with an analysis based on first principles.\n\nThe intracellular chloride concentration, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, in a neuron is dynamically regulated by the interplay of ion transporters and channels. The primary transporters mentioned are KCC2, which extrudes $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and the Sodium–Potassium–Chloride Cotransporter $1$ (NKCC1), which accumulates $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Additionally, chloride-permeable channels, including GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ receptors, glycine receptors, and CLC-2, allow for passive flux of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ down its electrochemical gradient.\n\nThe reversal potential for a channel permeable only to chloride would be given by the Nernst equation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $z$ is the valence of the ion ($-1$ for $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ are the extracellular and intracellular chloride concentrations, respectively.\n\nHowever, the problem correctly specifies a physiological bicarbonate-buffered solution. GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ receptors are significantly permeable to bicarbonate ions ($\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) in addition to chloride. Therefore, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ is not equal to $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$. Its value is dictated by the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) voltage equation for anions, which for these two species is:\n$$E_{\\text{GABA}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}} \\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + \\rho [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} + \\rho [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}} \\right)$$\nwhere $P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ are the respective membrane permeabilities through the channel, and $\\rho = P_{\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}/P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ is the permeability ratio (typically $\\approx 0.2 - 0.4$).\n\nFrom this GHK relation, it is immediately obvious that a depolarizing shift in $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ (i.e., $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ becomes less negative) can be caused by:\n$1$. An increase in $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n$2$. An increase in $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, which is linked to an increase in intracellular pH ($pH_{\\mathrm{i}}$).\n$3$. A change in the permeability ratio $\\rho$.\n\nAn increase in $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is the most common interpretation. This accumulation of intracellular chloride can result from:\n(a) Decreased extrusion, e.g., reduced KCC2 activity.\n(b) Increased influx, e.g., enhanced NKCC1 activity.\n(c) Altered passive flux through constitutively open channels (e.g., CLC-2) if the resting membrane potential is depolarized relative to the prevailing $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n\nTherefore, to attribute a shift in $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ to KCC2, one must systematically exclude or account for contributions from NKCC1, bicarbonate ions, and other chloride conductances. The gramicidin perforated-patch technique is appropriately chosen as it preserves the native intracellular ionic concentrations, which is essential for studying transport phenomena.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Conclude that KCC2 is downregulated because $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ depolarized. To confirm, apply a KCC2 inhibitor and verify that $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ repolarizes toward its baseline. Do not modify extracellular buffers or block other channels, because such manipulations would introduce artifacts.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates naive reasoning.\n1. The initial conclusion is premature and ignores all confounding factors detailed above.\n2. The proposed confirmation is logically backward. KCC2 is a chloride *extruder*. Inhibiting it would cause chloride to *accumulate*, leading to a further *depolarization* of $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ and $E_{\\text{GABA}}$, not a repolarization. This experimental design is nonsensical for confirming downregulation.\n3. The refusal to use specific pharmacological tools or buffer substitutions under the guise of avoiding \"artifacts\" is anti-scientific.

It correctly identifies the core ambiguity arising from bicarbonate permeability.\n2. It proposes a direct method to resolve this: measure $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ in a $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-free solution (e.g., HEPES-buffered), where $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ becomes equal to $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$. This isolates the variable of interest.\n3. It advocates for independent verification of $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ using a chloride sensor, adding robustness.\n4. It correctly identifies the need to assess the thermodynamic driving force for KCC2, which requires knowledge of both potassium and chloride gradients. The expression $\\ln \\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\right)$ correctly reflects the direction of KCC2-mediated flux.\n5. Crucially, it employs specific pharmacology (KCC2 inhibitors, bumetanide for NKCC1) to attribute changes to a specific transporter.\n6. It goes beyond steady-state measurements to quantify transport *kinetics* (activity) using a chloride load assay, while blocking confounding pathways. This is a direct measure of function.\n7. It seeks a molecular correlate (biochemistry) for the functional observation.\nThis strategy is a model of systematic, reductionist science applied to a complex physiological question.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Switch to whole-cell patch clamp with a high-chloride pipette to clamp $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, then any observed $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ shift must reflect transporter changes. Because the pipette fixes $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the role of bicarbonate is negligible and can be ignored.**\n\nThis option is deeply flawed.\n1. Switching to whole-cell dialysis from a pipette invalidates the entire premise of studying native ion homeostasis. It perturbs the very system one wishes to measure. The clamp is also imperfect, especially in dendritic compartments.\n2. The logic is circular and incorrect. if you clamp $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, a change in transporter activity cannot manifest as a change in $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, and therefore cannot cause a shift in $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ via that mechanism.\n3. The assertion that the role of bicarbonate becomes negligible is false. As per the GHK equation, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ remains dependent on bicarbonate even if $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is held constant.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ is close to the potassium reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, infer that KCC2 is highly active because KCC2 transport couples $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Therefore, determine $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and accept proximity of $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ to $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ as sufficient evidence of strong KCC2 extrusion.**\n\nThis option is an oversimplification.\n1. It is true that the thermodynamic equilibrium for KCC2 is achieved when $E_{\\text{Cl}} = E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. Thus, high KCC2 activity drives $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ towards $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$.\n2. The fatal flaw is equating $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ with $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. Due to bicarbonate permeability, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ is always depolarized relative to $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. For example, if KCC2 sets $E_{\\text{Cl}} = E_{\\mathrm{K}} = -90$ mV, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ might be $-78$ mV. Concluding anything from the \"proximity\" of $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ to $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ without accounting for the bicarbonate shunt is quantitatively incorrect.\n3. This method also ignores the contribution of NKCC1, which actively opposes KCC2. The steady-state $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ reflects the balance of all active and passive fluxes, not just KCC2 activity alone.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Accept that $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ differs from $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ due to bicarbonate, but assume the bicarbonate permeability ratio is fixed. Use dynamic clamp to standardize GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ conductance and measure intracellular pH with a pH-sensitive reporter to back-calculate $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ from $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ without blocking any channels or transporters; transporter-specific pharmacology is unnecessary if the back-calculation is internally consistent.**\n\nThis option is more sophisticated but remains insufficient and makes a critical error in judgment.\n1. The idea to calculate $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ from $pH_{\\mathrm{i}}$ measurements and then back-calculate $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ from the GHK equation is sound in principle.\n2. However, it relies on an assumed, constant value for the permeability ratio $\\rho$, which may not be valid as this ratio can be subject to modulation.\n3. The most significant flaw is the assertion that pharmacology is unnecessary. Even if one could perfectly determine $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ and its shift, this does not reveal the *cause* of the shift. A change in $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is the net result of all chloride fluxes. To \"disambiguate KCC2's contribution,\" one *must* use specific molecular tools like inhibitors to isolate its role from NKCC1 and other pathways. Avoiding pharmacology is not a sign of a robust method; it is an evasion of the central experimental question.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only option B presents a rigorous, multi-pronged experimental plan that is adequate to the complexity of the problem. It systematically controls for confounding variables, employs specific tools to isolate the component of interest, combines multiple measurement modalities for robustness, and links functional changes to molecular mechanisms.

Model these processes phenomenologically with first-order kinetics around a fixed intracellular volume:\n- NKCC$1$ activity factor: $$a_N(t) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{t}{\\tau_N} \\right),$$ where $\\tau_N$ is a time constant in $\\mathrm{days}$.\n- KCC$2$ activity factor: $$a_K(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left( -\\frac{t - t_{1/2}}{\\sigma} \\right)},$$ where $t_{1/2}$ is the half-activation time in $\\mathrm{days}$ and $\\sigma$ sets the developmental transition width in $\\mathrm{days}$.\n- Net intracellular chloride dynamics: $$\\frac{d C_i}{d t} = a_N(t)\\, J_0 \\;-\\; a_K(t)\\, g \\, C_i(t) \\;-\\; g_L \\left(C_i(t) - C_{\\min}\\right),$$ where $J_0$ has units $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g$ and $g_L$ have units $\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, and $C_{\\min}$ is a small floor representing leak-driven approach to low chloride in $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nCompute the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ reversal potential by $$E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(t) \\approx E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(t) = \\frac{R T}{z F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_o}{C_i(t)}\\right)\\,,$$ expressed in $\\mathrm{V}$ and then converted to $\\mathrm{mV}$ by multiplying by $1000$.\n\nNumerical integration requirements:\n- Use explicit forward Euler time-stepping on a uniform grid. If $C_i^n \\equiv C_i(t_n)$ and $\\Delta t$ is the time step in $\\mathrm{days}$, then $$C_i^{n+1} = C_i^{n} + \\Delta t \\left[a_N(t_n)\\, J_0 \\;-\\; a_K(t_n)\\, g \\, C_i^{n} \\;-\\; g_L \\left(C_i^{n} - C_{\\min}\\right)\\right].$$\n- Clamp $C_i(t)$ to remain strictly positive at all times to ensure the logarithm is well-defined; use a minimal floor if necessary.\n\nParameters, constants, and units to use for all simulations:\n- Temperature $T = 310$ $\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Universal gas constant $R = 8.314462618$ $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n- Faraday constant $F = 96485.33212$ $\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- Chloride valence $z = -1$.\n- Extracellular chloride $C_o = 130$ $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Leak parameters $g_L = 0.05$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$ and $C_{\\min} = 4$ $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Initial condition $C_i(0) = C_{i0} = 25$ $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Time step $\\Delta t = 0.001$ $\\mathrm{days}$, final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 21$ $\\mathrm{days}$.\n- Measurement times $t_{\\mathrm{eval}} = [0, 3, 7, 14, 21]$ $\\mathrm{days}$.\n- Convert $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ from $\\mathrm{V}$ to $\\mathrm{mV}$ and report values rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTest suite of parameter sets to implement:\n- Case $1$ (typical developmental switch): $\\tau_N = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 7$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 2$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.\n- Case $2$ (slow KCC$2$ upregulation): $\\tau_N = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 14$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 3$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.\n- Case $3$ (persistent NKCC$1$): $\\tau_N = 1000$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 7$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 2$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.\n- Case $4$ (strong KCC$2$): $\\tau_N = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 1$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 3.5$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.\n\nAngle units are not applicable. Physical units must be respected as defined. The final output must be the values of $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ at the specified $t_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ for each case in $\\mathrm{mV}$, each number rounded to three decimal places.\n\nFinal output format specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is the list of $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ values for a case at $t_{\\mathrm{eval}} = [0, 3, 7, 14, 21]$ in that order. For example, an output with $4$ cases must look like $[[e_{1,0},e_{1,1},e_{1,2},e_{1,3},e_{1,4}],[e_{2,0},\\dots],[e_{3,0},\\dots],[e_{4,0},\\dots]]$ where each $e_{i,j}$ is a float in $\\mathrm{mV}$ rounded to three decimal places.", "solution": "We derive a minimal model that links Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter $1$ (NKCC$1$) and Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter $2$ (KCC$2$) activities to intracellular chloride $[ \\mathrm{Cl}^{-} ]_i$ and from there to the Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_{\\text{A}}$) receptor reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$. The model is constructed from two foundational principles: mass balance of intracellular chloride and the Nernst equation for anions.\n\nFirst, define the state variable $C_i(t) \\equiv [ \\mathrm{Cl}^{-} ]_i(t)$ in $\\mathrm{mM}$ and the constant extracellular chloride $C_o \\equiv [ \\mathrm{Cl}^{-} ]_o$ in $\\mathrm{mM}$. The net rate of change of intracellular chloride concentration is written as the difference between an inward term driven by NKCC$1$ and outward terms driven by KCC$2$ and a passive leak:\n$$\\frac{d C_i}{d t} = a_N(t) J_0 - a_K(t) g C_i(t) - g_L \\left(C_i(t) - C_{\\min}\\right).$$\nHere, $a_N(t)$ and $a_K(t)$ are dimensionless activity factors capturing developmental regulation of NKCC$1$ and KCC$2$, respectively, $J_0$ has units $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g$ and $g_L$ have units $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$, and $C_{\\min}$ is a small floor concentration in $\\mathrm{mM}$. The functional forms\n$$a_N(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_N}\\right), \\quad a_K(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_{1/2}}{\\sigma}\\right)}$$\nencode a decaying NKCC$1$ activity and a sigmoidal increase of KCC$2$ activity over developmental time, with $\\tau_N$ the NKCC$1$ time constant, $t_{1/2}$ the half-activation time, and $\\sigma$ the transition width, all in $\\mathrm{days}$. This first-order phenomenology is consistent with linearization of transporter fluxes near operating ranges and constant cell volume.\n\nGiven $C_i(t)$, the chloride reversal potential follows from the Nernst equation for a monovalent anion of valence $z=-1$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(t) = \\frac{R T}{z F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_o}{C_i(t)}\\right),$$\nwith $R$ the universal gas constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, and $F$ Faraday's constant. We adopt the approximation $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(t) \\approx E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(t)$ under the assumption that GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channel permeability is dominated by chloride over bicarbonate in the regimes considered. We finally convert from $\\mathrm{V}$ to $\\mathrm{mV}$ by multiplying by $1000$.\n\nFor numerical simulation, we use explicit forward Euler integration with uniform time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$C_i^{n+1} = C_i^{n} + \\Delta t \\left[a_N(t_n)\\, J_0 \\;-\\; a_K(t_n)\\, g \\, C_i^{n} \\;-\\; g_L \\left(C_i^{n} - C_{\\min}\\right)\\right],$$\nwhere $t_n = n \\Delta t$. To avoid non-physical values and numerical issues in the logarithm, we clamp $C_i^n$ to a small positive floor if necessary. The parameters are chosen to be physiologically plausible and internally consistent:\n- $T = 310$ $\\mathrm{K}$,\n- $R = 8.314462618$ $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$,\n- $F = 96485.33212$ $\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$,\n- $z = -1$,\n- $C_o = 130$ $\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- $g_L = 0.05$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$,\n- $C_{\\min} = 4$ $\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- initial condition $C_i(0) = C_{i0} = 25$ $\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- $\\Delta t = 0.001$ $\\mathrm{days}$,\n- final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 21$ $\\mathrm{days}$,\n- evaluation times $t_{\\mathrm{eval}} = [0, 3, 7, 14, 21]$ $\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nThe test suite explores different developmental regimes:\n- Case $1$: $\\tau_N = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 7$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 2$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$,\n- Case $2$: $\\tau_N = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 14$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 3$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$,\n- Case $3$: $\\tau_N = 1000$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 7$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 2$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$,\n- Case $4$: $\\tau_N = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $t_{1/2} = 5$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $\\sigma = 1$ $\\mathrm{days}$, $J_0 = 20$ $\\mathrm{mM/day}$, $g = 3.5$ $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.\n\nAlgorithmic procedure for each case:\n- Initialize $C_i(0) = C_{i0}$, set $t=0$, and prepare the time grid to $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ with step $\\Delta t$.\n- At each time $t_n$, compute $a_N(t_n)$ and $a_K(t_n)$.\n- Update $C_i$ via the Euler step and enforce positivity by clamping to a small floor if needed.\n- Whenever $t_n$ reaches an element of $t_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ (within half a step), compute $$E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(t_n) = \\frac{R T}{z F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_o}{C_i(t_n)}\\right)\\cdot 1000$$ in $\\mathrm{mV}$ and round to three decimal places.\n- Collect the sequence $[E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(0), E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(3), E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(7), E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(14), E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(21)]$ for that case.\n\nFor quality assurance, note that the linearity of the right-hand side in $C_i$ ensures that forward Euler is numerically stable for the selected $\\Delta t$ since an effective decay rate $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = a_K(t) g + g_L$ yields $\\Delta t \\, k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) \\ll 2$ across all cases. The steady-state at a fixed time, if $a_N$ and $a_K$ were frozen, would satisfy $$C_i^{\\ast}(t) = \\frac{a_N(t) J_0 + g_L C_{\\min}}{a_K(t) g + g_L},$$ which intuitively captures how rising KCC$2$ activity and a small leak reduce $C_i$ over developmental time, producing a hyperpolarizing shift in $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$.
