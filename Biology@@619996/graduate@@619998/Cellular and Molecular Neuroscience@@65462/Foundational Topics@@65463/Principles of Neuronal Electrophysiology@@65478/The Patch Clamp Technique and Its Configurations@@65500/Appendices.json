First, we must determine the maximum tolerable peak membrane current, $I_{m,peak,max}$, that ensures the membrane voltage error does not exceed a specified limit. Second, we must calculate the predicted peak membrane current, $I_{m,peak,pred}$, for a given voltage-ramp protocol and compare it to the tolerable limit to assess the protocol's feasibility.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the concepts provided. The series resistance compensation is set to a fraction $f$. This means a portion of the voltage drop across the pipette series resistance, $R_s$, is electronically subtracted by the amplifier. The uncompensated, or residual, series resistance, $R_{s,eff}$, is what causes the error between the command voltage, $V_c(t)$, and the actual membrane potential, $V_m(t)$. As stated, this residual resistance is:\n$$R_{s,eff} = (1 - f) R_s$$\nThe voltage error, $V_{err}(t)$, is the voltage drop across this residual resistance due to the total membrane current, $I_m(t)$, flowing through it. This is a direct application of Ohm's law:\n$$V_{err}(t) = V_c(t) - V_m(t) = I_m(t) R_{s,eff}$$\nThe problem states a constraint on the maximum instantaneous voltage error: $|V_{err}(t)| \\le V_{err,max}$. This directly implies a constraint on the maximum instantaneous membrane current. The maximum acceptable peak current, $I_{m,peak,max}$, is therefore the current that produces the maximum allowed voltage error:\n$$V_{err,max} = I_{m,peak,max} R_{s,eff}$$\nSolving for $I_{m,peak,max}$ gives the first required expression:\n$$I_{m,peak,max} = \\frac{V_{err,max}}{R_{s,eff}} = \\frac{V_{err,max}}{(1 - f) R_s}$$\nWe substitute the given values: $V_{err,max} = 2~\\mathrm{mV}$, $f = 0.70$, and $R_s = 6.5~\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\n$$I_{m,peak,max} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{V}}{(1 - 0.70) \\times 6.5 \\times 10^6~\\Omega} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{V}}{0.30 \\times 6.5 \\times 10^6~\\Omega} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.95 \\times 10^6}~\\mathrm{A}$$\n$$I_{m,peak,max} \\approx 1.02564 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{A}$$\nExpressed in nanoamperes and rounded to three significant figures, the maximum acceptable peak current is $1.03~\\mathrm{nA}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the feasibility of the planned voltage ramp.

The command voltage as a function of time $t$ is:\n$$V_c(t) = V_{hold} + k \\cdot t \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le \\Delta t$$\nwhere the ramp rate $k$ is:\n$$k = \\frac{V_{final} - V_{hold}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{0~\\mathrm{V} - (-80 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{V})}{2 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s}} = 40 \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}}$$\nThe total membrane current, $I_m(t)$, is the sum of the leak current, $I_L(t)$, across the input resistance $R_{in}$, and the capacitive current, $I_C(t)$, charging the membrane capacitance $C_m$.\n$$I_m(t) = I_L(t) + I_C(t) = \\frac{V_m(t)}{R_{in}} + C_m \\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt}$$\nThe clamp is imperfect, so $V_m(t) \\neq V_c(t)$. We must use the relationship $V_m(t) = V_c(t) - I_m(t) R_{s,eff}$. Substituting the expression for $I_m(t)$ into this equation yields:\n$$V_m(t) = V_c(t) - \\left( \\frac{V_m(t)}{R_{in}} + C_m \\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} \\right) R_{s,eff}$$\nRearranging terms, we obtain a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $V_m(t)$:\n$$V_m(t) \\left(1 + \\frac{R_{s,eff}}{R_{in}}\\right) + (C_m R_{s,eff}) \\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} = V_c(t)$$\nThis describes the behavior of a low-pass filter. For a ramp input $V_c(t)$, after an initial brief transient, the output $V_m(t)$ will also follow a ramp but with a reduced slope and a time lag. The time constant of the initial transient is short compared to the ramp duration, so we can analyze the behavior using the steady-state solution. In this ramp-following steady state, we have:\n$$\\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} \\approx \\frac{k}{1 + \\frac{R_{s,eff}}{R_{in}}}$$\nThe total current $I_m(t)$ is a linear function of time, as both $V_m(t)$ and its derivative are (approximately) linear or constant. The slope of the current trace with respect to time depends on the term $\\frac{V_m(t)}{R_{in}}$. As $V_m(t)$ increases from a negative value towards zero, the current will be most positive (or least negative) at the end of the ramp, when $V_m(t)$ is maximal. Therefore, the peak current occurs at $t = \\Delta t$.\n\nAt $t = \\Delta t$, we have $V_c(\\Delta t) = V_{final} = 0~\\mathrm{V}$.

The predicted current exceeds the maximum acceptable current. Thus, the planned protocol is not feasible under the stated voltage error constraint. The feasibility indicator is $0$.\nThe final answer consists of two parts: the maximum acceptable peak current ($1.03~\\mathrm{nA}$) and the feasibility indicator ($0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.03 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2766024"}, {"introduction": "The ability to resolve the tiny currents flowing through single ion channels is fundamentally limited by background electrical noise.

This is the Norton equivalent circuit for a noisy resistor. The power spectral density of this current source, $S_i(f)$, which describes the mean-square noise current per unit frequency, is given by:\n$$\nS_i(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T}{R}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

In the context of circuit analysis, an ideal voltage clamp possesses zero input impedance. It acts as a perfect ammeter, measuring the current required to maintain its input terminal at a constant command potential. In this configuration, the input of the amplifier effectively serves as a virtual ground for AC signals.\n\nThe seal resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{seal}}$, is in parallel with the patched membrane. Both are connected to the input of the voltage-clamp amplifier. When we model $R_{\\mathrm{seal}}$ as its Norton equivalent (a noiseless resistor $R_{\\mathrm{seal}}$ in parallel with the noise current source $i_{n, \\mathrm{seal}}$), the entire circuit connected to the amplifier input consists of the membrane patch, the noiseless $R_{\\mathrm{seal}}$, and the current source $i_{n, \\mathrm{seal}}$, all in parallel.\n\nSince the amplifier input is an ideal current sink (zero impedance), all current from the noise source $i_{n, \\mathrm{seal}}$ will flow into the amplifier input and be measured. No portion of this noise current flows through the parallel resistor $R_{\\mathrmseal}}$ or the membrane patch, because the voltage across these parallel elements is held at zero by the ideal clamp.
