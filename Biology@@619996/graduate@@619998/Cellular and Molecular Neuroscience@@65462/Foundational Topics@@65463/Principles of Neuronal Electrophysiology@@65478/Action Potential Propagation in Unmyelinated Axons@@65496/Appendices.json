The solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts: first, the derivation of the expression for $r_i$; second, the numerical evaluation of $r_i$; third, the derivation of the cable equation to show the role of $r_i$ and its physical interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Axial Resistance per Unit Length ($r_{i}$)**\nWe begin with the fundamental formula for the electrical resistance $R$ of a homogeneous conductor of length $L$, cross-sectional area $A$, and uniform resistivity $\\rho$:\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$$\nWe consider a short cylindrical segment of the axon of length $\\Delta x$. For this segment, the length is $L = \\Delta x$, and the resistivity of the intracellular medium is $\\rho = \\rho_{i}$. The current flows along the axis of the axon, so the relevant area $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder.\n\nThe axon has a diameter $d$. The radius is therefore $d/2$. The cross-sectional area $A$, which is a circle, is given by:\n$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$$\nThe resistance $\\Delta R$ of this short segment of length $\\Delta x$ is:\n$$\\Delta R = \\rho_{i} \\frac{\\Delta x}{A} = \\rho_{i} \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}} = \\frac{4 \\rho_{i} \\Delta x}{\\pi d^2}$$\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_{i}$, is defined as the resistance of this segment divided by its length, in the limit that the length approaches zero.\n$$r_{i} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta R}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{4 \\rho_{i} x}{\\pi d^2} \\right)$$\nFor a uniform cylinder, this derivative is simply the coefficient of $x$. Thus, we find:\n$$r_{i} = \\frac{4 \\rho_{i}}{\\pi d^2}$$\nThis is the required expression for $r_{i}$ in terms of $\\rho_{i}$ and $d$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $r_{i}$**\nWe are given the values:\n$\\rho_{i} = 100\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}$\n$d = 0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n\nThe final result must be in units of $\\Omega/\\text{cm}$. The unit of $\\rho_{i}$ is already appropriate. The diameter $d$ must be converted from micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) to centimeters ($\\text{cm}$).\nWe know that $1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$ and $1\\,\\text{m} = 10^2\\,\\text{cm}$. Therefore:\n$$d = 0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^2\\,\\text{cm} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived expression for $r_{i}$:\n$$r_{i} = \\frac{4 \\rho_{i}}{\\pi d^2} = \\frac{4 \\times (100\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm})}{\\pi \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm})^2}$$\nFirst, evaluate the denominator:\n$$(0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm})^2 = 0.25 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{cm}^2$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $r_{i}$:\n$$r_{i} = \\frac{400\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}}{\\pi \\times 0.25 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{400}{0.25\\pi} \\times 10^8\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{1600}{\\pi} \\times 10^8\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\text{cm}}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$r_{i} \\approx \\frac{1600}{3.14159...} \\times 10^8\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\text{cm}} \\approx 509.2958... \\times 10^8\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\text{cm}}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation:\n$$r_{i} \\approx 5.092958... \\times 10^{10}\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\text{cm}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required:\n$$r_{i} \\approx 5.09 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\text{cm}}$$\n\n**Part 3: Role of $r_{i}$ in the Cable Equation**\nThe one-dimensional cable equation describes the evolution of the transmembrane voltage $V(x,t)$. We derive it by considering conservation of current in a small segment of the axon of length $\\Delta x$.\n\nThe axial current $I_i(x)$ is related to the spatial gradient of the transmembrane voltage $V(x)$ by Ohm's law applied to the axoplasm. The voltage drop $\\Delta V$ along the segment is $\\Delta V = V(x+\\Delta x) - V(x)$. This is caused by the current $I_i$ flowing through the resistance $r_i \\Delta x$:\n$$V(x+\\Delta x) - V(x) = -I_i(x) (r_i \\Delta x)$$\nIn the limit $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we have $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = -I_i r_i$.\n\nConservation of current requires that the change in axial current along the segment must equal the current that leaks out through the membrane, which we denote as the membrane current per unit length, $i_m$.\n$$I_i(x) - I_i(x+\\Delta x) = i_m \\Delta x$$\nIn the limit $\\Delta x \\to 0$, this becomes $-\\frac{\\partial I_i}{\\partial x} = i_m$.\n\nTo connect these, we differentiate the Ohm's law relation with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = -r_i \\frac{\\partial I_i}{\\partial x}$$\nSubstituting $-\\frac{\\partial I_i}{\\partial x} = i_m$, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = r_i i_m$$\nThe linear membrane approximation states that $i_m$ has a capacitive component ($c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$) and a resistive component ($V/r_m$), where $c_m$ and $r_m$ are the membrane capacitance and resistance per unit length, respectively.\n$$i_m = c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{V}{r_m}$$\nSubstituting this into our equation yields the cable equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = r_i \\left( c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{V}{r_m} \\right)$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as $\\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = \\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + V$, where the space constant is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m / r_i}$ and the time constant is $\\tau_m = r_m c_m$. The parameter $r_i$ is thus a fundamental component of the cable equation.\n\n**Explanation**: A larger internal resistance $r_i$ leads to a smaller space constant $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m/r_i}$, causing voltage to decay more steeply with distance. This constrains the spatial spread of intracellular current ahead of an action potential, limiting how far upstream depolarization can effectively bring the subsequent membrane patch to its firing threshold and thus affecting propagation velocity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.09 \\times 10^{10}}$$", "id": "2696949"}, {"introduction": "While axial resistance hinders the forward flow of current, the membrane's own resistance prevents that current from leaking out.

It is a standard exercise in biophysics that tests the application of first principles. A solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the space constant, $\\lambda$, from the fundamental geometric and material properties of the axon. The axon is modeled as a cylinder of diameter $d$. The space constant is defined by the relationship $\\lambda^2 = r_m / r_i$, where $r_m$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_i$ is the axial (intracellular) resistance per unit length.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $r_i$. The axial resistance of a segment of length $\\Delta x$ is given by $R_{\\text{axial}} = \\rho_i \\frac{\\Delta x}{A}$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the axoplasm. The resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is therefore $\\rho_i / A$. The cross-sectional area of the cylindrical axon is $A = \\pi (\\frac{d}{2})^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$.

The specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, is defined per unit area of the membrane. The resistance of a patch of membrane of length $\\Delta x$ is $R_{\\text{membrane}} = \\frac{R_m}{\\text{Area}} = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d \\Delta x}$.

The problem specifies a steady-state condition for the passive cable ahead of the action potential. The voltage distribution along an infinitely long passive cable, with a voltage source $V_0$ at $x=0$, is given by an exponentially decaying function:\n$$ V(x) = V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nIn this problem, the peak of the action potential acts as the source, so $V(0) = V_{\\text{peak}} = 40\\,\\text{mV}$.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary physical parameters and constraints to derive a scaling law and compute a ratio. The language is objective and unambiguous. The parameters and conditions, such as diameter-independent gating kinetics and channel density (implied by \"identical ion channel expression\"), are standard assumptions for this type of analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe propagation of an action potential in an unmyelinated axon is described by the cable equation. The total current flowing out of a segment of the axon membrane must equal the change in the axial current along that segment. The membrane current has two components: a capacitive current and an ionic current. The governing partial differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I_{axial}}{\\partial x} = -i_{m} = -(i_c + i_{ion}) $$\nwhere $I_{axial}$ is the axial current inside the axon, $i_m$ is the membrane current per unit length, $i_c$ is the capacitive current per unit length, and $i_{ion}$ is the ionic current per unit length.\n\nThe axial current is related to the intracellular resistivity $R_i$ and the gradient of the membrane potential $V_m$. For an axon of diameter $d$, the cross-sectional area is $A = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$. The axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is $r_i = \\frac{R_i}{A} = \\frac{4R_i}{\\pi d^2}$. Thus, $I_{axial} = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial x}$. This gives $\\frac{\\partial I_{axial}}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V_m}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nThe capacitive current per unit length is $i_c = c_m \\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t}$, where $c_m$ is the membrane capacitance per unit length. For a cylinder, $c_m$ is the specific capacitance $C_m$ multiplied by the circumference $\\pi d$, so $c_m = C_m \\pi d$.\n\nThe ionic current per unit length, $i_{ion}$, is the ionic current density across the membrane, $j_{ion}$, multiplied by the circumference, so $i_{ion} = j_{ion} \\pi d$. The problem states that the ion channel expression is identical, which implies that the properties and density of ion channels per unit area are independent of diameter. Therefore, $j_{ion}$, which is a function of membrane potential and gating variables, has a functional form that does not depend on $d$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the current balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V_m}{\\partial x^2} = c_m \\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t} + i_{ion} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4R_i}\\right)\\frac{\\partial^2 V_m}{\\partial x^2} = (C_m \\pi d) \\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t} + (j_{ion} \\pi d) $$\nDividing the entire equation by the circumference $\\pi d$ simplifies it to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{4R_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V_m}{\\partial x^2} = C_m \\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t} + j_{ion} $$\nAn action potential is a wave that propagates with a constant velocity $v$ and a fixed shape. We can thus seek a traveling wave solution of the form $V_m(x, t) = V(z)$, where $z = x - vt$. The partial derivatives can be transformed into ordinary derivatives with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dz}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -v \\frac{d}{dz} $$\nSubstituting these into the equation yields an ordinary differential equation for the wave shape $V(z)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{4R_i}\\frac{d^2V}{dz^2} + v C_m \\frac{dV}{dz} - j_{ion}(V, \\text{gating variables}) = 0 $$\nThe dynamics of the gating variables are also transformed. For a generic gating variable $g$, its dynamics are of the form $\\frac{dg}{dt} = f(V, g)$. In the moving frame, this becomes $-v \\frac{dg}{dz} = f(V, g)$.\n\nFor this equation to yield a consistent solution for the propagation velocity $v$, the terms must scale correctly with the diameter $d$. Let us perform a scaling analysis. Let $\\ell$ be the characteristic spatial length of the action potential wave and $\\tau$ be its characteristic time scale. The velocity is $v = \\ell/\\tau$. The derivatives scale as $\\frac{d}{dz} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\ell}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\ell^2}$. The ionic term $j_{ion}$ is determined by channel gating kinetics. The problem states that the characteristic ionic gating time scale is diameter-independent. This time scale is the dominant one for the action potential, so we can set $\\tau$ as a constant independent of $d$.\n\nThe equation implies a balance between the three terms. Let us balance the first two terms (axial current and capacitive current) to find the scaling:\n$$ \\frac{d}{R_i} \\frac{d^2V}{dz^2} \\sim v C_m \\frac{dV}{dz} $$\nSubstituting the scaling for the derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{R_i} \\frac{1}{\\ell^2} \\sim v C_m \\frac{1}{\\ell} $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{R_i \\ell} \\sim v C_m $$\nNow, substitute $\\ell = v \\tau$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{R_i (v \\tau)} \\sim v C_m $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{R_i \\tau} \\sim v^2 C_m $$\nRearranging for $v^2$:\n$$ v^2 \\sim \\frac{d}{R_i C_m \\tau} $$\nAccording to the problem statement, the intracellular resistivity $R_i$, the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$, and the characteristic time scale $\\tau$ are all independent of the axon diameter $d$. Therefore, the scaling relationship for the conduction velocity is:\n$$ v^2 \\propto d \\implies v \\propto \\sqrt{d} $$\nThe conduction velocity in an unmyelinated axon scales with the square root of its diameter.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio of the conduction velocities for the two given axons. Let $v_1$ be the velocity for the axon with diameter $d_1 = 0.3\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $v_2$ be the velocity for the axon with diameter $d_2 = 1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\nFrom the scaling law $v = k\\sqrt{d}$ for some constant of proportionality $k$:\n$$ \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{k\\sqrt{d_2}}{k\\sqrt{d_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_1}} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{0.3\\,\\mu\\text{m}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.2}{0.3}} = \\sqrt{4} $$\n$$ \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = 2 $$\nThe ratio of the conduction velocities is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2696957"}]}
