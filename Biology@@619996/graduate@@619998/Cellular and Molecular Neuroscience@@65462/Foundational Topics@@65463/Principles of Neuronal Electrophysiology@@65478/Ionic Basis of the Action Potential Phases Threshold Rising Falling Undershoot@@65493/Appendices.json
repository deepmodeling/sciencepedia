It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular electrophysiology, internally consistent, and well-posed, providing all necessary parameters for a unique solution. We proceed.\n\nThe dynamics of the membrane potential, $V(t)$, for an isopotential patch of membrane are governed by the principle of conservation of charge. The rate of change of charge stored on the membrane capacitance must equal the net current flowing across the membrane. This is expressed by the following differential equation:\n$$\nC_{m} \\frac{dV}{dt} = -I_{\\text{ion}} + I_{\\text{inj}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance per unit area, $I_{\\text{ion}}$ is the total ionic current density flowing out of the cell, and $I_{\\text{inj}}$ is the externally injected current density. The problem defines inward current as positive for $I_{\\text{inj}}$.\n\nThe total outward ionic current, $I_{\\text{ion}}$, is the sum of the currents through all ion channels.

The system is at a steady state, which means the membrane potential is constant, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. The injected current is also zero, $I_{\\text{inj}} = 0$. Substituting these into the governing equation gives the condition for the resting potential, $V_{\\text{rest}}$:\n$$\n0 = - \\left( g_{\\text{Na,p}}(V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{\\text{Na}}) + g_{\\text{K,leak}}(V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{\\text{K}}) \\right) + 0\n$$\nThis implies that at rest, the total ionic current is zero: $I_{\\text{ion,rest}} = 0$.

It presents a standard electrophysiological calculation based on the parallel conductance model of a neuronal membrane.

Each branch corresponds to a specific type of ion channel (sodium, potassium, leak) and is characterized by a conductance and a reversal potential (electromotive force). The total current density, $I_{\\mathrm{net}}$, is the algebraic sum of the individual current densities for each ion type.\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n\nEach individual ionic current, $I_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, follows Ohm's law, where the current is the product of the ionic conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force for an ion is the difference between the membrane potential, $V$, and the ion's Nernst or reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ion}} = g_{\\mathrm{ion}} (V - E_{\\mathrm{ion}})$$\n\nThe problem specifies the electrophysiological convention where outward movement of positive charge is a positive current.
