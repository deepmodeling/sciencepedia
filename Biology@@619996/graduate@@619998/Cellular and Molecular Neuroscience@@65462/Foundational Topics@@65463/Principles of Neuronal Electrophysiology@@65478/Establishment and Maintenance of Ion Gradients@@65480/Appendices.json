It is scientifically grounded in fundamental principles of electrostatics, it is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a solution from first principles as requested and to perform the subsequent calculation.\n\nWe will proceed with the derivation. The problem asks us to model the neuronal plasma membrane as a planar dielectric slab of thickness $d$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon$, separating two conductors of area $A$. This is the standard parallel-plate capacitor model.\n\nLet a total free charge $+Q$ be accumulated on one conducting surface (e.g., the outer surface) and $-Q$ on the other (the inner surface). The surface charge density on the plates is then $\\sigma = \\frac{Q}{A}$ and $-\\sigma = -\\frac{Q}{A}$, respectively.\n\nWe apply Gauss's law for electric fields in a dielectric medium. The electric displacement field, $\\vec{D}$, is related to the free charge density. For a parallel-plate geometry, by choosing a cylindrical Gaussian surface (a \"pillbox\") that pierces one of the plates, we find that the magnitude of the displacement field, $D$, between the plates is uniform and equal to the magnitude of the free surface charge density:\n$$D = \\sigma$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the constitutive relation for a linear dielectric, which links the electric displacement field $\\vec{D}$ to the electric field $\\vec{E}$:\n$$\\vec{D} = \\varepsilon \\vec{E}$$\nIn terms of magnitudes, this is $D = \\varepsilon E$. By combining these two equations, we can express the magnitude of the electric field $E$ in terms of the surface charge density $\\sigma$:\n$$E = \\frac{D}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma$ in terms of the total charge $Q$ and area $A$:\n$$E = \\frac{Q}{A \\varepsilon}$$\nThis electric field is uniform inside the dielectric, pointing from the positively charged plate to the negatively charged plate, under the standard approximation that ignores fringing fields.\n\nNext, we use the definition of potential difference, $V_{m}$, across a uniform electric field. The potential difference between the two plates is the line integral of the electric field from the negative plate to the positive plate:\n$$V_{m} = \\int_{0}^{d} E \\, dx = E \\int_{0}^{d} dx = E d$$\nSubstituting our expression for the electric field $E$:\n$$V_{m} = \\left( \\frac{Q}{A \\varepsilon} \\right) d$$\nThis equation shows the linear relationship between the transmembrane potential difference $V_m$ and the total charge $Q$ stored on the plates. The problem asks for the dependence of the total charge on the potential difference. We rearrange the equation to solve for $Q$:\n$$Q = \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon A}{d} \\right) V_{m}$$\nThis is the required relationship derived from first principles. The term in parentheses, $\\frac{\\varepsilon A}{d}$, is a constant for a given membrane geometry and composition. This term is defined as the capacitance, $C$. Thus, we have derived the fundamental capacitor equation:\n$$Q = C V_{m}$$\nThe capacitance $C$ is the proportionality constant that is a property of the membrane itself.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must calculate the net charge, $\\Delta Q$, that must be moved across the membrane to produce a given change in potential, $\\Delta V_{m}$. We are given the total membrane capacitance, $C_{m}$, and are told that the membrane's dielectric properties do not change.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) Voltage Equation**\nThe flux of an ionic species $S$ across a membrane is described by the Nernst–Planck equation, which accounts for diffusion due to a concentration gradient and drift due to an electric field. Let the membrane lie between $x=0$ (extracellular side) and $x=L$ (intracellular side). The membrane potential is $V_m = \\phi_{in} - \\phi_{out} = \\phi(L) - \\phi(0)$. The Nernst-Planck equation for the flux density $j_S$ of ion $S$ with valence $z_S$ is:\n$$j_S(x) = -D_S \\left( \\frac{dC_S(x)}{dx} + \\frac{z_S F}{RT} C_S(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} \\right)$$\nHere, $D_S$ is the diffusion coefficient of the ion in the membrane, $C_S(x)$ is its concentration at position $x$, $\\phi(x)$ is the electric potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nThe constant-field approximation assumes the electric field $E = -d\\phi/dx$ is constant across the membrane. Thus, $E = \\frac{\\phi(0) - \\phi(L)}{L} = \\frac{-\\left(\\phi(L) - \\phi(0)\\right)}{L} = -\\frac{V_m}{L}$. So, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{V_m}{L}$. The equation becomes:\n$$j_S = -D_S \\left( \\frac{dC_S}{dx} + \\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT L} C_S \\right)$$\nIn steady state, the flux $j_S$ must be constant for $x \\in [0, L]$.

Using an integrating factor $e^{\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RTL}x}$, we get:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( C_S(x) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m x}{RTL}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{j_S}{D_S} \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m x}{RTL}\\right)$$\nIntegrating from $x=0$ (outside) to $x=L$ (inside) with boundary conditions $C_S(0)=[S]_o$ and $C_S(L)=[S]_i$:\n$$\\int_0^L \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( C_S(x) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m x}{RTL}\\right) \\right) dx = -\\frac{j_S}{D_S} \\int_0^L \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m x}{RTL}\\right) dx$$\n$$\\left[ C_S(x) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m x}{RTL}\\right) \\right]_0^L = -\\frac{j_S}{D_S} \\left[ \\frac{RTL}{z_S F V_m} \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m x}{RTL}\\right) \\right]_0^L$$\n$$[S]_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [S]_o = -\\frac{j_S RTL}{D_S z_S F V_m} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nSolving for the flux $j_S$ and defining the permeability as $P_S = D_S/L$:\n$$j_S = P_S \\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[S]_o - [S]_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right)}$$\nAt steady state, the total transmembrane electric current density $I_{tot}$ is zero. The current carried by each ion is $I_S = z_S F j_S$.\n$$I_{tot} = \\sum_S I_S = F \\sum_S z_S j_S = 0 \\implies \\sum_S z_S j_S = 0$$\nFor the ions $K^+$, $Na^+$, and $Cl^-$, this condition is $z_K j_K + z_{Na} j_{Na} + z_{Cl} j_{Cl} = 0$. With $z_K=+1$, $z_{Na}=+1$, and $z_{Cl}=-1$, this becomes $j_K + j_{Na} - j_{Cl} = 0$.\nLet's substitute the flux expression for each ion. To simplify, we manipulate the expression to have a common denominator. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right)$:\n$$j_S = P_S \\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[S]_o \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [S]_i}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_S F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1}$$\nFor cations ($z_S=+1$, e.g., $K^+, Na^+$):\n$$j_{cat} = P_{cat} \\frac{F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[cat]_o \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [cat]_i}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1}$$\nFor anions ($z_S=-1$, e.g., $Cl^-$):\n$$j_{anion} = P_{anion} \\frac{-F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[anion]_o \\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [anion]_i}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1}$$\nThe crucial step demonstrating the effect of valence sign is to rewrite the anion flux to match the form of the cation flux. For the $Cl^-$ term, we have:\n$$-j_{Cl} = P_{Cl} \\frac{F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[Cl]_o \\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [Cl]_i}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1} = P_{Cl} \\frac{F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[Cl]_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [Cl]_o}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1}$$\nNow, $j_K + j_{Na} = j_{Cl}$, which is equivalent to $j_K + j_{Na} + (-j_{Cl}) = 0$. Using the unified expressions:\n$$\\frac{F V_m}{RT \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1\\right)} \\left[ P_K\\left([K]_o e^{-\\frac{FV_m}{RT}} - [K]_i\\right) + P_{Na}\\left([Na]_o e^{-\\frac{FV_m}{RT}} - [Na]_i\\right) + P_{Cl}\\left([Cl]_i e^{-\\frac{FV_m}{RT}} - [Cl]_o\\right) \\right] = 0$$\nAssuming $V_m \\neq 0$, the term in the square brackets must be zero.\n$$e^{-\\frac{FV_m}{RT}} \\left( P_K[K]_o + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i \\right) = \\left( P_K[K]_i + P_{Na}[Na]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl]_o \\right)$$\nSolving for $V_m$:\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K]_o + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i}{P_K[K]_i + P_{Na}[Na]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl]_o} \\right)$$\nThis is the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz voltage equation. Note how the negative valence of chloride ($z_{Cl}=-1$) results in its intracellular concentration $[Cl]_i$ appearing in the numerator and its extracellular concentration $[Cl]_o$ in the denominator, the reverse of the cations.\n\n**Calculation of the Change in Membrane Potential**\nThe change in membrane potential $\\Delta V_m$ is given by $\\Delta V_m = V_m^{\\text{new}} - V_m^{\\text{old}}$. Using the derived GHK equation:\n$$V_m^{\\text{old}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K]_o^{\\text{old}} + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i}{P_K[K]_i + P_{Na}[Na]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl]_o} \\right)$$\n$$V_m^{\\text{new}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K]_o^{\\text{new}} + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i}{P_K[K]_i + P_{Na}[Na]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl]_o} \\right)$$\nThe denominator is identical in both expressions. Let $N_{old}$ be the numerator in the old state and $N_{new}$ be the numerator in the new state, and $D$ be the common denominator.\n$$\\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{new}}{D}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{old}}{D}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{new}}{N_{old}}\\right)$$\nWe can use the relative permeabilities directly: $P_K=1$, $P_{Na}=0.05$, $P_{Cl}=0.45$. The concentrations are in $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$N_{old} = P_K[K]_o^{\\text{old}} + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i = (1)(3) + (0.05)(145) + (0.45)(5) = 3 + 7.25 + 2.25 = 12.5$.\n$N_{new} = P_K[K]_o^{\\text{new}} + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i = (1)(8) + (0.05)(145) + (0.45)(5) = 8 + 7.25 + 2.25 = 17.5$.\nNow we compute the thermal voltage term, $\\frac{RT}{F}$:\n$$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) (310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.0267073\\,\\mathrm{V} = 26.7073\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nFinally, we calculate $\\Delta V_m$:\n$$\\Delta V_m = (26.7073\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{17.5}{12.5}\\right) = (26.7073\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(1.4)$$\n$$\\Delta V_m \\approx (26.7073\\,\\mathrm{mV}) (0.336472) \\approx 8.98865\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we obtain $\\Delta V_m = 8.99\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.99}$$", "id": "2710812"}]}
