It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular electrophysiology, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation from first principles, followed by the numerical calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for a relationship between the input resistance, $R_{in}$, the specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, and the total surface area, $A$, of an isopotential soma. We are instructed to use only Ohm's law and the definition of specific membrane resistance.\n\nFirst, we define the input resistance, $R_{in}$, for the entire soma. By Ohm's law, this is the ratio of the steady-state change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_m$, to the total injected current, $I$:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_m}{I}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a direct current $I$ is injected and the system reaches a steady state, at which point the capacitive current is zero. All injected current must therefore exit the cell as ionic leak current through the membrane.\n\nSecond, we consider the local properties of the membrane. The specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, is defined as the resistance of a unit area of the membrane. It relates the local membrane potential change, $\\Delta V_m$, to the density of the current, $J_m$, flowing across that unit area. This relationship is a form of Ohm's law applied per unit area:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = J_m \\cdot R_m\n$$\nNote the units: if $\\Delta V_m$ is in Volts ($V$), and $J_m$ is in Amperes per square meter ($A/m^2$), then $R_m$ must be in Ohm-square meters ($\\Omega \\cdot m^2$). The problem states the soma is isopotential, which means $\\Delta V_m$ is uniform across the entire surface. Consequently, the current density $J_m$ must also be uniform across the entire membrane area $A$.\n\nThird, we relate the total current $I$ to the current density $J_m$. Since the current density is uniform over the total surface area $A$, the total current leaving the cell is the product of the current density and the area:\n$$\nI = J_m \\cdot A\n$$\nWe now have a system of three equations. Our objective is to find an expression for $R_{in}$ in terms of $R_m$ and $A$.\n\nFrom the equation for total current, we can express the current density as:\n$$\nJ_m = \\frac{I}{A}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $J_m$ into the equation for the specific membrane resistance:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\left(\\frac{I}{A}\\right) \\cdot R_m\n$$\nThis equation links the membrane potential change to the injected current and the cell's physical properties. Now, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta V_m$ into the definition of input resistance:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_m}{I} = \\frac{\\frac{I \\cdot R_m}{A}}{I}\n$$\nThe total current $I$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the desired relationship:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{R_m}{A}\n$$\nThis result is fundamental. It shows that the input resistance of an isopotential cell is inversely proportional to its surface area. A larger cell has a lower input resistance.\n\nNext, we are required to compute the numerical value of $R_{in}$ using the provided data:\n$R_m = 20\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$\n$A = 1{,}200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nTo perform this calculation, the units must be consistent.

All terms are standard within the field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative neuroscience. I will proceed with a full derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nFor an isopotential neuron modeled as a parallel RC circuit, the injected current $I_{inj}(t)$ is distributed between the resistive path (leak channels) and the capacitive path (lipid bilayer). By Kirchhoff's current law:\n$$I_{inj}(t) = I_R(t) + I_C(t)$$\nwhere $I_R$ is the resistive current and $I_C$ is the capacitive current.\n\nThe voltage across the membrane is $V(t)$, and we define the deflection from the resting potential as $\\Delta V(t) = V(t) - V_{rest}$. Since the problem states $E_{leak} = V_{rest}$, the resistive current is given by Ohm's law:\n$$I_R(t) = \\frac{V(t) - E_{leak}}{R_\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{\\Delta V(t)}{R_\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThe capacitive current is:\n$$I_C(t) = C_m \\frac{d V(t)}{dt} = C_m \\frac{d (\\Delta V(t))}{dt}$$\nFor $t > 0$, the injected current is a constant, $I_{inj}(t) = I_0$. The governing differential equation is:\n$$I_0 = \\frac{\\Delta V(t)}{R_\\mathrm{in}} + C_m \\frac{d (\\Delta V(t))}{dt}$$\nRearranging this into standard form for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$\\frac{d (\\Delta V)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{R_\\mathrm{in} C_m} \\Delta V = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$$\nThe membrane time constant is defined as $\\tau_m = R_\\mathrm{in} C_m$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d (\\Delta V)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_m} \\Delta V = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$$\nThe initial condition is that the voltage cannot change instantaneously at $t=0$, so $\\Delta V(0) = 0$. The solution to this differential equation with this initial condition is:\n$$\\Delta V(t) = I_0 R_\\mathrm{in} (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m})$$\nThis equation describes a single-exponential approach to a steady-state value. By comparing this theoretical form to the experimental fit:\n1.  The time constant of the exponential process, $\\tau_m$, is identical to the fitted time constant, $\\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$. Thus, $\\tau_m = \\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$.\n2.  The steady-state voltage deflection, reached as $t \\to \\infty$, is $\\Delta V_\\infty = I_0 R_\\mathrm{in}$. This is simply Ohm's law applied at steady state, when the capacitor is fully charged and $I_C = 0$.\n\nFrom these principles, we can evaluate the provided options using the given data: $I_0 = -60\\,\\mathrm{pA} = -60 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$, $\\tau_\\mathrm{fit} = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 18 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\lvert \\Delta V_\\infty \\rvert = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Since the current is hyperpolarizing ($I_0 < 0$), the voltage deflection must be negative, so $\\Delta V_\\infty = -6.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use the steady-state deflection to estimate $R_\\mathrm{in}$ by dividing the magnitude of the steady-state voltage change by the magnitude of the injected current, and take the fit time constant as the membrane time constant: $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\lvert \\Delta V_\\infty \\rvert / \\lvert I_0 \\rvert = 100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$, $\\tau_m = \\tau_\\mathrm{fit} = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.**\n\nThe procedure described is to find $R_\\mathrm{in}$ from the steady-state condition and to identify $\\tau_m$ with $\\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$.\nFrom our derivation, $\\Delta V_\\infty = I_0 R_\\mathrm{in}$, which rearranges to $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\Delta V_\\infty / I_0$. In terms of magnitudes, $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\lvert \\Delta V_\\infty \\rvert / \\lvert I_0 \\rvert$. This procedure is correct.\nThe time constant of the single-exponential voltage response is, by definition, the membrane time constant, so $\\tau_m = \\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$. This is also correct.\n\nLet us check the numerical values:\n$$R_\\mathrm{in} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{60 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 0.1 \\times 10^9\\,\\Omega = 100 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega = 100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$$\n$$\\tau_m = \\tau_\\mathrm{fit} = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe procedure is theoretically sound, and the calculated values match those stated in the option.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use the initial slope at pulse onset to estimate $R_\\mathrm{in}$ by dividing the magnitude of the initial voltage slope by the magnitude of the injected current, and take $\\tau_m = \\Delta V_\\infty / (dV/dt\\vert_{0^+})$ from the same fit parameters: $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\lvert dV/dt \\rvert_{0^+} / \\lvert I_0 \\rvert \\approx 5.6\\times 10^9\\,\\Omega$, $\\tau_m = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.**\n\nThe procedure for $R_\\mathrm{in}$ is $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\lvert dV/dt \\rvert_{0^+} / \\lvert I_0 \\rvert$. Let us examine the initial slope, $\\frac{d(\\Delta V)}{dt}\\vert_{t=0^+}$. From the governing equation, at $t=0^+$, $\\Delta V(0^+) = 0$. Therefore, the equation simplifies to $I_0 = C_m \\frac{d(\\Delta V)}{dt}\\vert_{t=0^+}$, which gives $\\frac{d(\\Delta V)}{dt}\\vert_{t=0^+} = \\frac{I_0}{C_m}$.\nSubstituting this into the proposed formula for $R_\\mathrm{in}$:\n$$R_\\mathrm{in} = \\frac{\\lvert I_0/C_m \\rvert}{\\lvert I_0 \\rvert} = \\frac{1}{C_m}$$\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. Resistance is not equal to the inverse of capacitance. They do not even have the same physical units ($\\Omega$ vs. $\\mathrm{F}^{-1}$). The procedure for estimating $R_\\mathrm{in}$ is invalid. Although the formula proposed for $\\tau_m$ is correct ($\\tau_m = \\Delta V_\\infty / (dV/dt\\vert_{0^+}) = (I_0 R_{in}) / (I_0/C_m) = R_{in}C_m$), the overall procedure is flawed because of the incorrect method for $R_\\mathrm{in}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Combine steady-state and dynamic features from the same single-exponential fit: estimate $R_\\mathrm{in}$ from the steady-state deflection as in option A, estimate the membrane capacitance $C_m$ from the initial slope via $C_m = I_0 / (dV/dt\\vert_{0^+})$, and then compute $\\tau_m = R_\\mathrm{in} C_m$. With $dV/dt\\vert_{0^+} = \\Delta V_\\infty / \\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$ from the fit, this gives $R_\\mathrm{in} = 100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$, $C_m = 180\\,\\mathrm{pF}$, and $\\tau_m = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.**\n\nThis option presents a more detailed procedure:\n1.  Estimate $R_\\mathrm{in}$ from steady state: $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\Delta V_\\infty / I_0$. As established in A, this is correct.\n2.  Estimate $C_m$ from the initial slope: $C_m = I_0 / (dV/dt\\vert_{0^+})$. As shown in B, this is correct.\n3.  Compute $\\tau_m = R_\\mathrm{in} C_m$. This is the definition of the membrane time constant and is correct.\nThe identity $dV/dt\\vert_{0^+} = \\Delta V_\\infty / \\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$ is also correct for a single exponential function $\\Delta V(t) = \\Delta V_\\infty (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_\\mathrm{fit}})$.\n\nLet us verify the numerical calculations:\n$$R_\\mathrm{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_\\infty}{I_0} = \\frac{-6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{-60 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$$\nThe initial slope is calculated from the fit parameters:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta V)}{dt}\\bigg|_{0^+} = \\frac{\\Delta V_\\infty}{\\tau_\\mathrm{fit}} = \\frac{-6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{18 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{V/s}$$\nNow, calculate $C_m$:\n$$C_m = \\frac{I_0}{dV/dt\\vert_{0^+}} = \\frac{-60 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{-1/3\\,\\mathrm{V/s}} = 180 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F} = 180\\,\\mathrm{pF}$$\nFinally, calculate $\\tau_m$ from the derived components:\n$$\\tau_m = R_\\mathrm{in} C_m = (100 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega) \\times (180 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) = 18000 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 18 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThis procedure is entirely self-consistent and physically rigorous. It correctly determines $R_\\mathrm{in}$ and calculates $\\tau_m$, finding that it is equal to the fitted value $\\tau_\\mathrm{fit}$, as expected for this model. The stated numerical values are all correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because the membrane is passive, the voltage should change instantaneously at current onset; therefore estimate $R_\\mathrm{in}$ from the instantaneous voltage step at $t=0^+$ as $R_\\mathrm{in} = \\Delta V(0^+)/I_0$, and take $\\tau_m$ from the later relaxation. For the given recording, $\\Delta V(0^+) \\approx 0$, so $R_\\mathrm{in} \\approx 0\\,\\Omega$ and $\\tau_m = 18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.**\n\nThe premise \"the voltage should change instantaneously at current onset\" is fundamentally incorrect for a parallel RC circuit. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, as this would require an infinite current ($I_C = C_m dV/dt$). Since the injected current $I_0$ is finite, the voltage must be continuous at $t=0$. Therefore, $\\Delta V(0^+) = \\Delta V(0^-) = 0$. The assumption of an instantaneous voltage step is wrong. This phenomenon would only occur if a purely resistive element (like an access resistor) were in series with the parallel RC circuit, but the problem states access resistance is negligible. The conclusion that $R_\\mathrm{in} \\approx 0\\,\\Omega$ is nonsensical and contradicts the observed steady-state voltage deflection.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2724482"}, {"introduction": "Real neurons are far more complex than a simple RC circuit, possessing intricate dendritic trees and a host of voltage-dependent ion channels.

In a spatially extended but strictly passive neuron governed by the linear cable equation, the somatic response to a step current decomposes into a weighted sum of decaying modes associated with the dendritic tree; therefore, a multi-exponential relaxation is expected and is diagnostic of electrotonic non-isopotentiality.\n\nC. The presence of a slowly relaxing voltage-dependent current (for example, the hyperpolarization-activated cation current carried by Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels) introduces at least one additional dynamical variable; linearization around rest then yields more than one relaxation time constant even in a single isopotential compartment, producing a deviation from single-exponential behavior.\n\nD.

The central observation is that the neuron's voltage response to a current step is not a single exponential, and in the hyperpolarizing direction, it exhibits a \"sag\". We must assess the validity of the proposed explanations using first principles.\n\nFirst, let us establish the baseline reference case: a single, isopotential compartment described by a passive membrane. The circuit model consists of a membrane capacitance $C_m$ in parallel with a membrane resistance $R_m$ (representing a constant leak conductance $g_m = 1/R_m$). According to Kirchhoff's current law, the total current injected, $I_{inj}$, must equal the sum of the current through the capacitor, $I_C$, and the current through the resistor, $I_m$.\n$$\nI_{inj}(t) = I_C(t) + I_m(t)\n$$\nUsing the definitions for these currents, $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt}$ and $I_m = \\frac{V_m}{R_m}$ (where $V_m$ is the membrane potential relative to the resting potential), we obtain the governing differential equation:\n$$\nI_{inj}(t) = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + \\frac{V_m}{R_m}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.

This solution describes a voltage relaxation that follows a single exponential time course. The problem states that the observed response deviates from this, thus indicating that this simple model is insufficient. The potential reasons for this deviation are either the violation of the isopotentiality assumption (i.e., the neuron is spatially extended) or the violation of the passive membrane assumption (i.e., voltage-dependent conductances are present). The experiment is stated to be free of artifacts.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Under the single-compartment, linear passive model (one isopotential membrane with constant leak and capacitance), the response to a step current is a first-order relaxation with a single time constant; therefore, if artifacts are negligible, a robust multi-exponential voltage relaxation implies that at least one assumption (isopotentiality or purely passive leak) is violated.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is a direct and logically sound deduction. As derived above, the simplest model of a neuron—an isopotential, passive RC circuit—predicts a mono-exponential voltage relaxation. The problem states that the observed relaxation is multi-exponential and that recording artifacts are negligible. By the principle of *modus tollens*, if the conclusion of a model (single-exponential relaxation) is false, then at least one of its premises must be false. The core premises of the simple model are (1) isopotentiality (single compartment) and (2) a purely passive membrane (linear, time-invariant resistor). Therefore, the observation of a multi-exponential response correctly implies that the neuron is either not isopotential or not purely passive, or both.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. In a spatially extended but strictly passive neuron governed by the linear cable equation, the somatic response to a step current decomposes into a weighted sum of decaying modes associated with the dendritic tree; therefore, a multi-exponential relaxation is expected and is diagnostic of electrotonic non-isopotentiality.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement accurately describes the behavior of a passive cable. A spatially extended neuron is modeled as a series of infinitesimal RC compartments connected by axial resistances. The governing equation is the linear cable equation:\n$$\n\\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} - V\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the length constant. When a current step is injected at the soma ($x=0$), the solution $V(0,t)$ is not a single exponential. For a neuron with a dendritic tree, the solution is equivalent to that of an infinite R-C ladder network. The voltage response at the point of injection can be expressed as a sum of infinitely many exponential terms, corresponding to the different spatial modes of voltage relaxation within the structure. The solution takes the form:\n$$\nV_m(t) = R_{in} I_0 \\left(1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} A_k e^{-t/\\tau_k}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $R_{in}$ is the input resistance and the time constants $\\tau_k$ are related to the geometry and passive properties of the neuron. In practice, this response is well-approximated by a sum of two or more dominant exponential components. This multi-exponential character is a direct consequence of the non-isopotentiality, as current spreads into and charges the distributed capacitance of the dendritic tree.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The presence of a slowly relaxing voltage-dependent current (for example, the hyperpolarization-activated cation current carried by Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels) introduces at least one additional dynamical variable; linearization around rest then yields more than one relaxation time constant even in a single isopotential compartment, producing a deviation from single-exponential behavior.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement provides another valid mechanism for non-single-exponential behavior. Consider an isopotential compartment. The total current is now $I_{inj} = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + I_{leak} + I_{vd}$, where $I_{vd}$ is a voltage-dependent current. Such a current is typically described by the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, e.g., $I_{vd} = \\bar{g} \\cdot a \\cdot (V_m - E_{ion})$, where $\\bar{g}$ is the maximal conductance, $E_{ion}$ the reversal potential, and $a$ is a gating variable. The gating variable has its own first-order dynamics: $\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{a_{\\infty}(V_m) - a}{\\tau_a(V_m)}$. We now have a system of two coupled differential equations, one for $V_m$ and one for $a$. Linearizing this system around the resting steady state results in a $2 \\times 2$ system matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix determine the time constants of relaxation. A $2 \\times 2$ system will, in general, have two distinct eigenvalues, leading to a bi-exponential relaxation. Thus, adding a single voltage-dependent process increases the order of the system by one and introduces an additional time constant.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. A depolarizing “sag” during a sustained hyperpolarizing step cannot be generated by any purely passive linear network of resistors and capacitors; such a sag implies a time-dependent increase in membrane conductance (and thus a reduction of steady-state input resistance) due to activation of voltage-dependent channels.**\n\n**Analysis:** A \"sag\" refers to a non-monotonic voltage response. During a hyperpolarizing current step ($I_{inj} < 0$), the voltage first becomes more negative, reaches a minimum, and then depolarizes toward the resting potential despite the continued presence of the hyperpolarizing current. The step response of any linear time-invariant (LTI) system, which includes any network of passive resistors and capacitors, must be monotonic. The derivative of the step response is the impulse response, which for a passive RC network is a sum of decaying exponentials with positive coefficients, $h(t) = \\sum_k A_k e^{-t/\\tau_k}$ with $A_k > 0, \\tau_k > 0$. The step response $V(t) = \\int_0^t h(s) ds$ will therefore have a derivative that is always positive (for a depolarizing step) or always negative (for a hyperpolarizing step) before reaching steady state. It cannot change sign. A sag, where the voltage derivative changes sign from negative to positive during the step, is therefore impossible in a passive RC circuit. It requires an active process. Specifically, a hyperpolarization-activated inward current (like $I_h$), which activates over time, provides a depolarizing current that opposes the injected hyperpolarizing current, causing the voltage to \"sag\" back towards rest. This activation increases the total membrane conductance, reducing the input resistance.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. In a strictly passive, spatially extended neuron, distal dendrites can act as inductors, producing a depolarizing sag during a hyperpolarizing step; therefore, a sag is compatible with purely passive structure.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect from a biophysical standpoint. Inductance is the property of storing energy in a magnetic field, typically associated with coils of wire. The components of a neuron's membrane and cytoplasm are resistors (ion channels, cytoplasm) and capacitors (lipid bilayer). There is no known passive biophysical mechanism that confers inductive properties to a dendrite. While the dynamic behavior of some *active* voltage-gated ion channels can be mathematically modeled in a way that produces resonance or oscillations, similar to an RLC circuit (e.g., in phase-plane analysis), this is an emergent property of *active* conductances, not a feature of a *strictly passive* structure. A passive cable is an RC circuit, not an RLC circuit. As established in the analysis of option D, passive RC circuits cannot produce sag.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**F. The mere observation of a multi-exponential relaxation is, by itself and without any additional controls, sufficient to conclude that voltage-dependent conductances are active; electrode and series-resistance effects cannot in principle generate additional exponential components once bridge balance is set.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement makes an overly strong and incorrect conclusion. As established in the analysis of option B, a multi-exponential relaxation is the expected response of a completely passive but spatially extended neuron. Therefore, observing a multi-exponential decay is not, by itself, sufficient to distinguish between a passive cable and an isopotential compartment with active conductances. It only rules out the simple, single-compartment passive model. Furthermore, the claim about artifacts is too absolute. While \"bridge balance\" is a technique to compensate for series resistance, this compensation is never perfect. Residual, uncompensated series resistance in series with the pipette capacitance and the cell's input impedance can readily create a second, typically fast, exponential component in the recorded voltage trace. The problem asks us to assume artifacts are negligible, but the statement in option F makes a general claim that such artifacts are impossible in principle once balanced, which is practically and theoretically an oversimplification. The primary flaw, however, is the logical error of ignoring passive cable properties as a cause for multi-exponential relaxation.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2724506"}]}
