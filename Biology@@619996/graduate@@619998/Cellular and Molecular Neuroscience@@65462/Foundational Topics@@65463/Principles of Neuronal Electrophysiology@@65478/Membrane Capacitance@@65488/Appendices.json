It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of electrophysiology, is well-posed, and uses objective, precise language. It is a standard problem in the study of passive membrane properties. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the governing differential equation for the membrane potential $V(t)$ of an isopotential patch of membrane with area $A$. The membrane is modeled as a capacitor in parallel with a resistor. The derivation must start from three fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Charge:** The total applied current, $I_{\\text{app}}(t)$, flowing into the membrane patch must equal the sum of the currents flowing through the parallel pathways: the capacitive current, $I_C(t)$, and the leak ionic current, $I_L(t)$.\n    $$I_{\\text{app}}(t) = I_C(t) + I_L(t)$$\n    The applied current is given as a spatially uniform density, $j_{\\text{app}}(t)$, so the total current is $I_{\\text{app}}(t) = j_{\\text{app}}(t) A$.\n\n2.  **Definition of Capacitance:** The charge $Q(t)$ stored on the membrane capacitance is proportional to the voltage $V(t)$ across it: $Q(t) = C V(t)$, where $C$ is the total capacitance of the patch. The capacitive current is the rate of change of this stored charge.\n    $$I_C(t) = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$$\n\n3.  **Ohm's Law for the Leak Pathway:** The leak current $I_L(t)$ is proportional to the electrical driving force across the leak resistance $R$. The problem specifies that the reversal potential for the leak pathway is set to $0$ by choice of reference. Therefore, the driving force is simply the membrane potential $V(t)$.\n    $$I_L(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{R}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_C(t)$ and $I_L(t)$ into the charge conservation equation yields:\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) A = C \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t)}{R}$$\nThis equation relates total quantities ($C$, $R$) to the membrane potential. The problem requires the result in terms of specific membrane properties: the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ (capacitance per unit area) and the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (resistance scaled by area). These are defined as:\n$$C_m = \\frac{C}{A} \\implies C = C_m A$$\n$$R_m = R A \\implies R = \\frac{R_m}{A}$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the governing equation gives:\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) A = (C_m A) \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t)}{R_m/A}$$\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) A = C_m A \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t) A}{R_m}$$\nDividing all terms by the area $A$, which is non-zero, we obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $V(t)$ in the desired form:\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t)}{R_m}$$\nThis is the required ODE. It can be rearranged into the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n$$C_m R_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V(t) = j_{\\text{app}}(t) R_m$$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the applied current density is a constant value, which we denote as $j_0$. The equation becomes:\n$$C_m R_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V(t) = j_0 R_m$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear first-order ODE with constant coefficients. The solution $V(t)$ is the sum of a homogeneous solution $V_h(t)$ and a particular (steady-state) solution $V_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $C_m R_m \\frac{dV_h}{dt} + V_h(t) = 0$, which has the solution $V_h(t) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right)$, where $K$ is an integration constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, we look for the steady-state voltage $V_{ss}$ where the voltage is no longer changing, so $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. The ODE reduces to $V_{ss} = j_0 R_m$.\n\nThe general solution is $V(t) = V_h(t) + V_p(t) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right) + j_0 R_m$.\nWe use the initial condition that the membrane is at rest before the current step, so $V(0) = 0$.\n$$V(0) = K \\exp(0) + j_0 R_m = K + j_0 R_m = 0 \\implies K = -j_0 R_m$$\nSubstituting $K$ back into the general solution gives the final solution for the membrane potential:\n$$V(t) = -j_0 R_m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right) + j_0 R_m$$\n$$V(t) = j_0 R_m \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis equation demonstrates that the membrane potential $V(t)$ approaches its steady-state value $V_{ss} = j_0 R_m$ with a **single-exponential** time course. The time constant of this exponential process, denoted by $\\tau$, is the coefficient in the denominator of the time variable in the exponent.\nBy inspection, the membrane time constant is:\n$$\\tau = R_m C_m$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau$ using the provided parameters. First, we convert the parameters to SI units.\nThe specific membrane resistance is given as $R_m = 10^4\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$. The SI unit for area is $\\text{m}^2$.\nSince $1\\ \\text{cm} = 10^{-2}\\ \\text{m}$, we have $1\\ \\text{cm}^2 = (10^{-2}\\ \\text{m})^2 = 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}^2$.\n$$R_m = 10^4\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2 \\times \\frac{10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}^2}{1\\ \\text{cm}^2} = 10^4 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^2 = 1\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^2$$\nThe specific membrane capacitance is given as $C_m = 1\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^2$.

It is therefore valid. The derivation from first principles and subsequent numerical calculation will now be performed without compromise.\n\nThe neuron is modeled by the specified electrical circuit. The command voltage $V_c(t)$ is applied to a series combination of an access resistance $R_s$ and the membrane impedance $Z_m$. The membrane impedance consists of the membrane resistance $R_m$ in parallel with the membrane capacitance $C_m$. The total current flowing from the voltage clamp amplifier is denoted by $I(t)$.\n\nThe fundamental governing equations for this circuit are derived from Kirchhoff’s laws and the constitutive relations for the components. Let $V_m(t)$ be the voltage across the membrane.\nKirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) for the outer loop gives:\n$$V_c(t) = I(t)R_s + V_m(t)$$\nKirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the node between $R_s$ and the parallel $R_m$-$C_m$ network gives:\n$$I(t) = I_R(t) + I_C(t)$$\nwhere $I_R(t)$ is the current through the membrane resistance and $I_C(t)$ is the current through the membrane capacitance.

In this limit, all transients have decayed, and voltages and currents are constant. Therefore, $\\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} = 0$, which implies the capacitive current $I_C(t \\to \\infty) = 0$. The capacitor behaves as an open circuit. The total steady-state current $I_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ flows through $R_s$ and $R_m$ in series.

The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously. Since the system was at rest for $t  0$, $V_m(0^-) = 0$. By continuity of capacitor voltage, $V_m(0^+) = 0$. At this instant, the capacitor behaves as a short circuit with respect to the voltage change.

The time constant of an RC circuit is given by the product of the capacitance and the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor. To find the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ with respect to the terminals of $C_m$, the voltage source $\\Delta V$ is set to zero (shorted). From the perspective of $C_m$, the resistances $R_s$ and $R_m$ are in parallel.\nTherefore, the Thevenin resistance is:\n$$R_{th} = \\frac{R_s R_m}{R_s + R_m}$$\nThe time constant of the circuit's transient response is thus given by:\n$$\\tau = R_{th} C_m = \\frac{R_s R_m}{R_s + R_m} C_m$$\n\nWe must now derive the expression for $C_m$.
