The amplifier applies a command potential $V_{\\mathrm{cmd}}$ at the headstage, but the membrane potential $V_{m}$ deviates from $V_{\\mathrm{cmd}}$ due to the finite series (access) resistance $R_{s}$ between the pipette and the cell interior. Assume the membrane can be represented by a resistor–capacitor element in parallel, with ionic current $I_{m}$ defined as outward positive.

It presents a fundamental problem in experimental electrophysiology which can be solved with basic principles of circuit theory. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nThe system can be modeled as an electrical circuit. The voltage clamp amplifier maintains a command potential, $V_{\\mathrm{cmd}}$, at its headstage. This point is connected to the cell interior through the pipette, which has a finite series resistance, $R_{s}$. The potential of the cell interior, relative to the extracellular ground ($0\\,\\mathrm{V}$), is the true membrane potential, $V_{m}$. The cell membrane itself allows an ionic current, $I_{m}$, to flow. The problem states we are at steady state, so the capacitive current is zero ($I_{c}=0$), and the only current flowing across the membrane is $I_{m}$.\n\nThe convention for ionic current, $I_{m}$, is defined as \"outward positive\". This means a positive value of $I_{m}$ corresponds to a net flow of positive charge out of the cell. In a voltage clamp experiment, to maintain the membrane potential $V_{m}$ constant, the amplifier must inject a current, $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$, that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the net membrane current. At steady state, this means $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ must counteract $I_{m}$. If $I_m$ is an outward current, the amplifier must *inject* an equal current into the cell. Thus, the current flowing from the amplifier headstage, through the series resistor $R_s$, and into the cell is equal to $I_m$. Let us be precise: $I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = I_m$. This current $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ flows through the series resistor $R_s$.\n\nWe can apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the loop formed by the amplifier output, the series resistor, and the cell interior. The potential at the amplifier headstage is $V_{\\mathrm{cmd}}$. The potential of the cell interior is $V_{m}$. These two points are separated by the resistor $R_{s}$. According to Ohm's law, the potential difference across a resistor is the product of the current flowing through it and its resistance. The current flowing through $R_{s}$ is $I_{m}$, directed from the headstage into the cell. For a positive (outward) $I_{m}$, current flows from the point of higher potential to the point of lower potential. Therefore, $V_{\\mathrm{cmd}}$ must be greater than $V_{m}$.\n\nThe potential drop across the series resistor is given by:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{cmd}} - V_{m} = I_{m} R_{s}$$\nThe problem defines the steady-state voltage error as $\\Delta V \\equiv V_{\\mathrm{cmd}} - V_{m}$. By direct substitution, we arrive at the expression for the voltage error in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\\Delta V = I_{m} R_{s}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the numerical value of $\\Delta V$ for the given conditions. The values are:\n$$I_{m} = 1.35\\,\\mathrm{nA}$$\n$$R_{s} = 9.2\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$$\nIt is imperative to work in base SI units to ensure consistency.\n$$I_{m} = 1.35 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n$$R_{s} = 9.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega$$\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$\\Delta V = (1.35 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (9.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$\\Delta V = (1.35 \\times 9.2) \\times (10^{-9} \\times 10^{6})\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V = 12.42 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta V = 12.42\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nFinally, we must round this result to three significant figures. The value $12.42$ rounded to three significant figures is $12.4$.\nThe numerical voltage error is therefore $12.4\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the relationship between the apparent parameters obtained from a linear regression of measured current $I$ against command potential $V_{cmd}$, and the true biophysical parameters ($g_{true}$, $E_{rev,true}$).\n\nWe start from the provided foundational principles:\n1. $I = g_{true} (V_m - E_{rev,true})$\n2. $V_{drop} = I R_s$\n3. $V_{cmd} = V_m + V_{drop}$\n\nSubstitute equation (2) into (3) to express the true membrane potential $V_m$ in terms of the command potential $V_{cmd}$ and the measured current $I$:\n$V_{cmd} = V_m + I R_s$\n$$V_m = V_{cmd} - I R_s$$\nThis shows that the actual membrane potential $V_m$ deviates from the intended command potential $V_{cmd}$ by a voltage drop across the series resistance $R_s$.\n\nNext, substitute this expression for $V_m$ into the synaptic current equation (1):\n$$I = g_{true} ((V_{cmd} - I R_s) - E_{rev,true})$$\nThis equation now relates the measured current $I$ to the experimental control parameter $V_{cmd}$ and the cell's intrinsic properties. We must rearrange this equation to solve for $I$ as a function of $V_{cmd}$, which is the relationship measured in the experiment.\n$I = g_{true} V_{cmd} - g_{true} I R_s - g_{true} E_{rev,true}$\n$I + g_{true} I R_s = g_{true} V_{cmd} - g_{true} E_{rev,true}$\n$I (1 + g_{true} R_s) = g_{true} (V_{cmd} - E_{rev,true})$\n$$I = \\frac{g_{true}}{1 + g_{true} R_s} (V_{cmd} - E_{rev,true})$$\n\nThis is the theoretical current-voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship. The experiment involves fitting the data to an empirical linear model:\n$$I = a V_{cmd} + b$$\nThis empirical model can be rewritten in terms of an apparent conductance $g_{app}$ and an apparent reversal potential $E_{rev,app}$:\n$I = g_{app} (V_{cmd} - E_{rev,app}) = g_{app} V_{cmd} - g_{app} E_{rev,app}$\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the empirical fit ($I = a V_{cmd} + b$) with this form, we identify:\n$g_{app} = a$\n$E_{rev,app} = -b/a$\n\nNow, we compare the theoretical $I$-$V$ relationship with the apparent one:\n$I = \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{g_{true}}{1 + g_{true} R_s}\\right)}_{g_{app}} (V_{cmd} - \\underbrace{E_{rev,true}}_{E_{rev,app}})$\n\nFrom this comparison, we deduce the following relationships:\n1.  **Apparent Conductance**: $g_{app} = \\frac{g_{true}}{1 + g_{true} R_s}$\n2.  **Apparent Reversal Potential**: $E_{rev,app} = E_{rev,true}$\n\nThe reversal potential is correctly measured because at $E_{rev,true}$, the synaptic current $I$ is zero. When $I=0$, the voltage drop $V_{drop} = I R_s$ is also zero. Therefore, at the reversal potential, $V_m = V_{cmd}$, and the clamp accurately reports the true reversal potential. Thus, the corrected reversal potential, $E_{rev,corr}$, is equal to the apparent one:\n$$E_{rev,corr} = E_{rev,app}$$\n\nTo find the true conductance $g_{true}$ (which we will call the corrected conductance, $g_{corr}$), we must solve the equation for $g_{app}$ for $g_{true}$:\n$g_{app} (1 + g_{true} R_s) = g_{true}$\n$g_{app} + g_{app} g_{true} R_s = g_{true}$\n$g_{app} = g_{true} - g_{app} g_{true} R_s$\n$g_{app} = g_{true} (1 - g_{app} R_s)$\n$$g_{corr} = g_{true} = \\frac{g_{app}}{1 - g_{app} R_s}$$\nThis is the correction formula for the synaptic conductance. Note that the product $g_{app} R_s$ is dimensionless, as $(nS) \\cdot (G\\Omega) = (10^{-9} S) \\cdot (10^9 \\Omega) = 1$. The denominator $1 - g_{app}R_s  1$, which means $g_{corr} > g_{app}$, confirming that series resistance leads to an underestimation of the true conductance.\n\nFinally, we quantify the error metrics.\n-   **Fractional underestimation of conductance**, $f$:\n    $$f = \\frac{g_{corr} - g_{app}}{g_{corr}} = 1 - \\frac{g_{app}}{g_{corr}} = 1 - \\frac{g_{app}}{g_{app}/(1 - g_{app} R_s)} = 1 - (1 - g_{app} R_s) = g_{app} R_s$$\n-   **Maximum magnitude of series resistance voltage error**:\n    This error is the voltage drop $V_{drop} = I R_s$. The maximum error is found by using the maximum absolute current predicted by the linear fit, $\\hat{I}(V_{cmd}) = a V_{cmd} + b$.\n    $$V_{error,max} = \\max | \\hat{I}(V_{cmd}) \\, R_s | = (\\max |a V_{cmd} + b|) \\, R_s$$\n    Since the provided test data are perfectly linear, the fitted current $\\hat{I}(V_{cmd})$ will be identical to the given current data $I$. Thus, we can compute this as $\\max(|I|) \\cdot R_s$.\n\n### Computational Steps\nFor each test case:\n1.  Given arrays of $V_{cmd}$ and $I$ values, perform OLS regression to find the slope $a$ and intercept $b$ of the line $I = a V_{cmd} + b$.\n2.  Calculate the apparent parameters: $g_{app} = a$ (in nS) and $E_{rev,app} = -b/a$ (in mV).\n3.  Given $R_s$ (in G$\\Omega$), calculate the corrected parameters:\n    $g_{corr} = \\frac{g_{app}}{1 - g_{app} R_s}$ (in nS).\n    $E_{rev,corr} = E_{rev,app}$ (in mV).\n4.  Calculate the error metrics:\n    $f = g_{app} R_s$ (decimal).\n    $V_{error,max} = \\max(|I|) \\cdot R_s$ (in mV).\n5.

The provided numerical values are physically plausible for a biological neuron.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative neuroscience that is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. We will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Governing Equation and General Solution**\n\nThe fundamental principle is the conservation of charge. For the intracellular compartment, the injected current $I_{\\text{inj}}$ must equal the total current flowing out across the membrane, $I_m$.\n$$I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = I_m(t)$$\nThe membrane current $I_m$ is composed of two components: the capacitive current $I_C$, which charges the membrane capacitance, and the ionic leak current $I_L$, which flows through the membrane resistance.\n$$I_m(t) = I_C(t) + I_L(t)$$\nThe capacitive current is defined by the relation $I_C(t) = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$, where $V(t)$ is the membrane potential and $C_m$ is the total membrane capacitance.\nThe leak current $I_L$ is described by Ohm's Law. It is proportional to the driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential $V(t)$ and the reversal potential for the leak current $E_L$. The proportionality constant is the leak conductance $g_L = 1/R_m$.\n$$I_L(t) = g_L (V(t) - E_L) = \\frac{V(t) - E_L}{R_m}$$\nCombining these equations gives the governing differential equation for the membrane potential:\n$$I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} + \\frac{V(t) - E_L}{R_m}$$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the injected current is a constant, $I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = I_0$. The equation becomes:\n$$I_0 = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} + \\frac{V(t) - E_L}{R_m}$$\nTo solve this first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation, we rearrange it into a standard form. Multiplying by $R_m$ yields:\n$$R_m I_0 = R_m C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V - E_L$$\n$$R_m C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V = E_L + R_m I_0$$\nThe solution $V(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous solution $V_h(t)$ and a particular solution $V_p(t)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $R_m C_m \\frac{dV_h}{dt} + V_h = 0$, which has the solution $V_h(t) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right)$ for some constant $K$.\nFor the particular solution, since the right-hand side is constant, we assume a constant solution $V_p(t) = V_{\\infty}$. Substituting this into the full equation gives $0 + V_{\\infty} = E_L + R_m I_0$. Thus, the particular solution is the steady-state voltage $V_{\\infty} = E_L + R_m I_0$.\nThe general solution is:\n$$V(t) = V_h(t) + V_p(t) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right) + E_L + R_m I_0$$\nWe determine the constant $K$ using the initial condition $V(0) = E_L$.\n$$V(0) = E_L = K \\exp(0) + E_L + R_m I_0 = K + E_L + R_m I_0$$\nThis implies $K = -R_m I_0$.\nSubstituting $K$ back into the general solution gives the closed-form solution for $V(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$V(t) = -R_m I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right) + E_L + R_m I_0$$\nThis is commonly written as:\n$$V(t) = E_L + R_m I_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right)\\right)$$\nFrom the structure of this solution, the term in the exponential, $\\exp(-t/\\tau_{m})$, defines the characteristic time course of the voltage change. The parameter $\\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant. By inspection, we identify it as:\n$$\\tau_m = R_m C_m$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation for the Specific Neuron**\n\nWe are given the specific parameters for the neuron.

We substitute the computed values into the general solution, ensuring unit consistency.\n- $E_L = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- $R_m I_0 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- $\\tau_m = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n\nThe solution is:\n$$V(t) = E_L + R_m I_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_m}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting the values in the required units:\n$$V(t) [\\text{in mV}] = -65 + 5 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t [\\text{in ms}]}{10}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the membrane potential as a function of time.\nLet us simplify for the final presentation:\n$$V(t) = -65 + 5 - 5 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{10}\\right) = -60 - 5 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{10}\\right)$$\nHowever, the form $V(t) = V_{\\infty} + (V_0 - V_{\\infty})\\exp(-t/\\tau_m)$ is more instructive. The requested form is a single closed-form function. The first form $V(t) = -65 + 5(1-\\exp(-t/10))$ is more explicit about the initial state and total deflection. Both are correct. We will provide the latter as it directly follows from the derivation.\n\nFinal expression:\n$$V(t) = -65 + 5 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{10}\\right) \\right)$$\nwhere $V$ is in millivolts and $t$ is in milliseconds, valid for $t \\ge 0$.\nA check at $t=0$ gives $V(0) = -65 + 5(1-1) = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which matches the initial condition.\nA check as $t\\to\\infty$ gives $V(\\infty) = -65 + 5(1-0) = -60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which is the correct steady-state voltage $E_L+R_mI_0$.
