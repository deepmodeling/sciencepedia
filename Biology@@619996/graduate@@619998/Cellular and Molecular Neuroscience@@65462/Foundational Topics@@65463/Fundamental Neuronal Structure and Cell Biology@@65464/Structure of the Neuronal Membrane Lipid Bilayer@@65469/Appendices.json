The gel state occurs when temperature $T$ is below the lipid melting temperature $T_m$; liquid-disordered occurs when $T>T_m$ for unsaturated chains that pack loosely; liquid-ordered (Lo) combines high acyl chain order with significant lateral mobility, typically stabilized by cholesterol interacting with saturated lipids such as sphingomyelin.\n- Cholesterol increases acyl chain order and thickness in liquid-disordered phases by filling free volume and aligning neighboring chains, but it disrupts the gel phase by breaking long-range translational order, producing an Lo state. Its ordering effect is strongest with saturated chains (e.g., SM) and weaker with highly polyunsaturated chains.

Lipids self-assemble into bilayers with distinct lateral states: gel (solid-ordered, $s_o$), liquid-ordered ($L_o$), and liquid-disordered ($L_d$).\n    2. The $s_o$ state occurs for $T < T_m$ (melting temperature). The $L_d$ state occurs for $T > T_m$ with unsaturated, loosely packed chains. The $L_o$ state combines high acyl chain order with lateral mobility and is stabilized by cholesterol interacting with saturated lipids.\n    3. Cholesterol increases order in $L_d$ phases and disrupts order in $s_o$ phases, producing an $L_o$ state.\n    4. The ordering effect of cholesterol is strongest with saturated lipids (e.g., SM) and weaker with unsaturated lipids.\n    5. SM has a high $T_m$ and favors tight packing.

The specified components, concentrations, temperature, and underlying principles are standard for studying membrane phase behavior and the lipid raft hypothesis. The total molar composition sums to $100\\,\\%$. The question is objective, well-posed, and requires the application of the provided principles to deduce a unique qualitative outcome. While the composition stated for an \"inner leaflet mimic\" has high sphingomyelin, which is biologically more typical of the outer leaflet, the problem is presented as a study of a model system with a defined composition. The task is to predict the physical behavior of this specific mixture, not to debate its biological accuracy. As such, the problem is self-contained and physically consistent. It is not trivial, as it requires balancing the effects of multiple components with competing phase preferences.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe system is a multi-component lipid mixture at a physiological temperature of $T = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. To predict its lateral organization, we must analyze the intrinsic properties and mutual interactions of its components.\n\n1.  **Categorization of Lipids:** The lipids can be divided into two main groups based on their acyl chain structure and resulting phase preference at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n    -   **High-$T_m$ lipid:** Sphingomyelin (SM), at a concentration of $10\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\%$. Its saturated, long acyl chains give it a high melting temperature, $T_m > 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. In isolation, it would tend to form a gel ($s_o$) phase. However, its strong affinity for cholesterol promotes the formation of a liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase.\n    -   **Low-$T_m$ lipids:** The glycerophospholipids—phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS)—constitute the majority fraction, totaling $30\\,\\% + 20\\,\\% + 5\\,\\% = 55\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\%$. Their enrichment in unsaturated acyl chains results in low melting temperatures, $T_m < 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. At the given temperature, these lipids will strongly favor the formation of a liquid-disordered ($L_d$) phase, characterized by high chain entropy and motional freedom.\n\n2.  **Role of Cholesterol:** Cholesterol, present at a high concentration of $35\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\%$, acts as a modulator of membrane order. Its rigid, planar steroid ring structure allows it to interact differently with saturated and unsaturated lipids.\n    -   **Interaction with SM:** Cholesterol exhibits a strong preferential energetic interaction with saturated lipids like SM. It intercalates between SM molecules, ordering their acyl chains and reducing void volume, while simultaneously preventing the crystallization into a gel state. This combination of SM and cholesterol is the canonical basis for the formation of the $L_o$ phase.\n    -   **Interaction with Low-$T_m$ Lipids:** Cholesterol also interacts with the unsaturated glycerophospholipids, filling some of the free volume between their kinked chains. This is the \"condensing effect\" or \"ordering effect\" on an $L_d$ phase. However, this interaction is less favorable than with SM, especially with polyunsaturated chains, and is typically insufficient to drive the bulk $L_d$ phase into a fully $L_o$ state.\n\n3.  **Prediction of Phase Coexistence:** Given the strong preference of cholesterol for SM over the unsaturated lipids, the system will undergo phase separation to minimize its free energy.\n    -   SM molecules ($10\\,\\%$) will recruit cholesterol molecules to form domains that are enriched in both components. These domains will exhibit the properties of the $L_o$ phase: high acyl chain order combined with high lateral mobility.\n    -   The remaining lipids—the majority fraction of unsaturated PC, PE, and PS ($55\\,\\%$)—will form a continuous phase or matrix. The cholesterol not sequestered by SM will partition into this phase. This matrix will remain in an $L_d$ state, albeit a more ordered version than a cholesterol-free $L_d$ phase.\n    -   A critical aspect is the relative stoichiometry. The amount of SM is limited to $10\\,\\%$. This constrains the total possible area fraction of the $L_o$ phase. Even though cholesterol is abundant ($35\\,\\%$), it cannot form an $L_o$ phase on its own or with the unsaturated lipids. It requires the saturated lipid scaffold. Therefore, the high cholesterol concentration does not guarantee a predominantly $L_o$ membrane; the limiting reactant for $L_o$ phase formation is the SM. The system will thus exhibit coexistence of $L_o$ domains within a continuous $L_d$ matrix.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n-   **A. The membrane will be predominantly liquid-ordered across most of its area because cholesterol at $35\\,\\%$ together with $10\\,\\%$ sphingomyelin is sufficient to convert essentially all regions into an Lo state by tightening packing and suppressing lateral diffusion.**\n    -   **Analysis:** This assertion is incorrect. It fails to recognize that SM, at only $10\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\%$, is the limiting component for forming stable $L_o$ domains. The high concentration of cholesterol ($35\\,\\%$) cannot overcome the intrinsic preference of the majority lipid fraction ($55\\,\\%$ unsaturated glycerophospholipids) for the $L_d$ state. The formation of the $L_o$ phase is a cooperative phenomenon requiring specific partners.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **B. The membrane will be uniformly liquid-disordered because the majority PC/PE/PS fraction is unsaturated; cholesterol cannot stabilize order at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and therefore has negligible impact on acyl chain packing.**\n    -   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. It contains two major flaws. First, the claim that cholesterol \"cannot stabilize order\" is false; it is a primary function of cholesterol. Second, it completely neglects the well-established preferential interaction between cholesterol and sphingomyelin, which is the driving force for the formation of ordered domains ($L_o$ phase). A uniform $L_d$ state is inconsistent with the presence of SM and cholesterol in these quantities.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **C. The membrane will be predominantly gel (solid-ordered) because cholesterol raises the effective melting temperature $T_m$ of the saturated and unsaturated components, freezing the bilayer at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.**\n    -   **Analysis:** This statement demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of cholesterol's function. At concentrations above a few mol$\\%$, cholesterol *prevents* the sharp, cooperative transition into the gel ($s_o$) phase. It fluidizes lipids that would otherwise be in a gel state (those with $T_m > T$) into an $L_o$ state. The formation of a gel phase in a membrane containing $35\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\%$ cholesterol is physically implausible.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **D. The membrane will exhibit coexistence of liquid-ordered nanodomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin within a continuous liquid-disordered matrix of unsaturated PC/PE/PS, because cholesterol forms preferential, ordering interactions with saturated SM to yield Lo regions while the unsaturated glycerophospholipids remain in Ld at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; the limited $10\\,\\%$ SM constrains the Lo area fraction despite $35\\,\\%$ cholesterol.**\n    -   **Analysis:** This option provides a complete and physically accurate description of the expected phase behavior. It correctly identifies the preferential interactions (Cholesterol-SM), the resulting phase separation into $L_o$ and $L_d$ domains, and crucially, recognizes that the limited fraction of SM ($10\\,\\%$) is the constraining factor for the amount of $L_o$ phase formed, despite the abundance of cholesterol. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n    -   **Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$"}, {"introduction": "For a transmembrane protein to function correctly, it must integrate properly within the lipid bilayer, a concept captured by the principle of hydrophobic mismatch.

A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe hydrophobic mismatch, $\\Delta L$, is defined as the difference between the peptide's hydrophobic length, $L_P$, and the bilayer's hydrophobic thickness, $d_L$.\n$$ \\Delta L = L_P - d_L $$\n\n**1. Initial State (before cholesterol addition):**\nThe initial hydrophobic thickness is $d_{L, \\text{initial}} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The peptide length is $L_P = 3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe initial mismatch is:\n$$ \\Delta L_{\\text{initial}} = L_P - d_{L, \\text{initial}} = 3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm} - 3.6\\,\\mathrm{nm} = +0.2\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nA positive mismatch indicates that the peptide's hydrophobic segment is longer than the bilayer's hydrophobic core. To eliminate this mismatch, the peptide can tilt by an angle $\\theta$ relative to the bilayer normal. The effective length projected along the normal becomes $L_P \\cos(\\theta)$. The mismatch is eliminated when this projected length equals the bilayer thickness:\n$$ L_P \\cos(\\theta) = d_{L, \\text{initial}} $$\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{d_{L, \\text{initial}}}{L_P} = \\frac{3.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 0.9474 $$\nSince the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ is less than $1$, a real solution for $\\theta$ exists:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos(0.9474) \\approx 18.7^\\circ $$\nA tilt of approximately $19^\\circ$ is physically reasonable and can fully compensate for the initial positive mismatch.\n\n**2. Final State (after cholesterol addition):**\nCholesterol increases the hydrophobic thickness to $d_{L, \\text{final}} = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe final mismatch is:\n$$ \\Delta L_{\\text{final}} = L_P - d_{L, \\text{final}} = 3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm} - 4.2\\,\\mathrm{nm} = -0.4\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nA negative mismatch indicates that the peptide's hydrophobic segment is shorter than the bilayer's hydrophobic core. To compensate via tilt, we would again require $L_P \\cos(\\theta) = d_{L, \\text{final}}$.\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{d_{L, \\text{final}}}{L_P} = \\frac{4.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 1.105 $$\nThe cosine of a real angle cannot exceed $1$. Therefore, there is no real angle $\\theta$ that can satisfy this condition. The maximum possible projected length of the peptide is $L_P = 3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ when it is oriented perfectly perpendicular to the membrane plane ($\\theta=0^\\circ$). Any tilt ($\\theta>0^\\circ$) would further decrease its projected length $L_P \\cos(\\theta)$, making the effective length even shorter and thus worsening the negative mismatch. Consequently, helix tilt alone cannot eliminate the mismatch in this case. The system must resort to other mechanisms, such as inducing a local thinning of the lipid bilayer around the peptide or deforming the peptide itself, to minimize the energetically unfavorable exposure of hydrophobic protein surface or hydrophilic lipid headgroups.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n- The mismatch changes from a positive value ($+0.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) to a negative value ($-0.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$).\n- The magnitude of the mismatch increases from $|+0.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}| = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $|-0.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}| = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- In the initial state, the mismatch is positive (\"protein too long\") and can be resolved by a modest helix tilt.\n- In the final state, the mismatch is negative (\"protein too short\") and cannot be resolved by helix tilt.
