We will proceed with the derivation from first principles, followed by the numerical calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for a relationship between the input resistance, $R_{in}$, the specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, and the total surface area, $A$, of an isopotential soma. We are instructed to use only Ohm's law and the definition of specific membrane resistance.\n\nFirst, we define the input resistance, $R_{in}$, for the entire soma. By Ohm's law, this is the ratio of the steady-state change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_m$, to the total injected current, $I$:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_m}{I}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a direct current $I$ is injected and the system reaches a steady state, at which point the capacitive current is zero. All injected current must therefore exit the cell as ionic leak current through the membrane.\n\nSecond, we consider the local properties of the membrane. The specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, is defined as the resistance of a unit area of the membrane. It relates the local membrane potential change, $\\Delta V_m$, to the density of the current, $J_m$, flowing across that unit area. This relationship is a form of Ohm's law applied per unit area:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = J_m \\cdot R_m\n$$\nNote the units: if $\\Delta V_m$ is in Volts ($V$), and $J_m$ is in Amperes per square meter ($A/m^2$), then $R_m$ must be in Ohm-square meters ($\\Omega \\cdot m^2$). The problem states the soma is isopotential, which means $\\Delta V_m$ is uniform across the entire surface. Consequently, the current density $J_m$ must also be uniform across the entire membrane area $A$.\n\nThird, we relate the total current $I$ to the current density $J_m$. Since the current density is uniform over the total surface area $A$, the total current leaving the cell is the product of the current density and the area:\n$$\nI = J_m \\cdot A\n$$\nWe now have a system of three equations. Our objective is to find an expression for $R_{in}$ in terms of $R_m$ and $A$.\n\nFrom the equation for total current, we can express the current density as:\n$$\nJ_m = \\frac{I}{A}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $J_m$ into the equation for the specific membrane resistance:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\left(\\frac{I}{A}\\right) \\cdot R_m\n$$\nThis equation links the membrane potential change to the injected current and the cell's physical properties. Now, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta V_m$ into the definition of input resistance:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_m}{I} = \\frac{\\frac{I \\cdot R_m}{A}}{I}\n$$\nThe total current $I$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the desired relationship:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{R_m}{A}\n$$\nThis result is fundamental. It shows that the input resistance of an isopotential cell is inversely proportional to its surface area. A larger cell has a lower input resistance.\n\nNext, we are required to compute the numerical value of $R_{in}$ using the provided data:\n$R_m = 20\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$\n$A = 1{,}200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nTo perform this calculation, the units must be consistent.

It is a standard application of steady-state passive cable theory in cellular neuroscience. I will proceed with a rigorous derivation and computation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the dendritic length constant, $\\lambda$, and the calculation of a voltage attenuation factor. We begin from fundamental principles of electrical current flow in a cylindrical conductor. The dendrite is modeled as a uniform cylinder of diameter $d$.\n\nFirst, we must define the relevant electrical parameters per unit length of the dendrite. These are the axial resistance per unit length, $r_a$, and the membrane resistance for a unit length segment, $r_m$.\n\nThe intracellular medium has a specific resistivity $R_i$ (in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}$). The axial resistance of a segment of dendrite is analogous to the resistance of a wire. For a segment of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$, the resistance is $R = R_i \\frac{L}{A}$. The axial resistance per unit length, $r_a$, is therefore $R_i/A$. The cross-sectional area of the cylindrical dendrite is $A=\\pi a^2$, where $a=d/2$ is the radius.\n$$r_a = \\frac{R_i}{A} = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi (d/2)^2} = \\frac{4 R_i}{\\pi d^2}$$\nThe units of $r_a$ are resistance per length (e.g., $\\Omega/\\mathrm{cm}$).\n\nThe cell membrane has a specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$). This represents the resistance of a unit area of the membrane. The total membrane resistance of a cylindrical segment of length $L$ depends on its surface area, which is the circumference times the length, $C \\cdot L = (\\pi d) L$. The resistance of this membrane patch is $R_{memb} = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d L}$. The membrane current per unit length, $i_m$, is the voltage across the membrane, $v_m$, divided by the membrane resistance of a unit length cylinder. For a segment of length $\\Delta x=1$, the membrane resistance is $r_m = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}$. So, the membrane current leakage per unit length is $i_m = v_m/r_m$. The quantity $r_m$ has units of resistance-length (e.g., $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}$).\n$$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}$$\n\nNow, we formulate the steady-state cable equation. Consider a small segment of the dendrite of length $\\Delta x$. Let $v(x)$ be the membrane potential (as a deviation from the resting potential) at position $x$, and let $i_a(x)$ be the axial current flowing inside the dendrite.\nAccording to Ohm's law, the voltage drop along the axial resistance of the segment is:\n$$v(x) - v(x+\\Delta x) = i_a(x) r_a \\Delta x$$\nDividing by $\\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we get:\n$$-\\frac{dv}{dx} = i_a r_a$$\nBy the principle of current conservation (Kirchhoff's current law), any change in the axial current along the segment must be due to current leaking out across the membrane. The change in axial current is $i_a(x) - i_a(x+\\Delta x)$, and the total membrane current leaking out of the segment is $i_m(x) \\Delta x$.\n$$i_a(x) - i_a(x+\\Delta x) = i_m(x) \\Delta x$$\nAgain, dividing by $\\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$:\n$$-\\frac{di_a}{dx} = i_m$$\nThe membrane current per unit length, $i_m$, is related to the membrane voltage $v$ by the membrane resistance per unit length $r_m$:\n$$i_m = \\frac{v}{r_m}$$\nWe now combine these three relations. Differentiating the first equation with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = -r_a \\frac{di_a}{dx}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\frac{di_a}{dx}$ and $i_m$:\n$$\\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = -r_a (-i_m) = r_a \\left(\\frac{v}{r_m}\\right) = \\frac{r_a}{r_m} v$$\nThis is the steady-state cable equation. It is typically written as:\n$$\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} - v = 0$$\nBy comparing the two forms, we identify the square of the length constant, $\\lambda^2$, as:\n$$\\lambda^2 = \\frac{r_m}{r_a}$$\nThus, the length constant $\\lambda$ is:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}}$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for $r_m$ and $r_a$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (\\pi d)}{4 R_i / (\\pi d^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{\\pi d} \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4 R_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d R_m}{4 R_i}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the length constant.\n\nNow, we compute its numerical value.

The general solution to the cable equation $\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} - v = 0$ is:\n$$v(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions. The dendrite is assumed to be semi-infinite, which means the voltage must decay to zero at a large distance from the origin.

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $25$:\n$$ R = \\frac{600 \\div 25}{475 \\div 25} = \\frac{24}{19} $$\nThe result, being greater than $1$, demonstrates that for this model and these parameters, inhibitory conductance at the AIS has a greater impact on the somatic current threshold for spiking than the same conductance at the soma.
