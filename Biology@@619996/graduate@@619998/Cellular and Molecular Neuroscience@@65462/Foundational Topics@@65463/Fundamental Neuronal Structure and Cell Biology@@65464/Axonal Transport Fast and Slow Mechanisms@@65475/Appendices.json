The parameters provided, such as the instantaneous velocity of a motor protein and the range of daily displacements, are consistent with established biophysical and neurobiological data. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental kinematic principles to a real-world biological system. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the effective daily displacement $D$ starting from the integral definition $D = \\int_{0}^{T} v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t)\\,dt$. The instantaneous velocity $v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t)$ is a piecewise function of time. The cargo is either in a \"run\" state with constant velocity $v$ or a \"paused\" state with velocity $0$.\n\nLet $T_{\\mathrm{run}}$ be the total time spent in the run state and $T_{\\mathrm{pause}}$ be the total time spent in the paused state over the observation window $T$. The givens state that the fraction of time spent paused is $\\alpha$. Thus, we have:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{pause}} = \\alpha T$$\nThe remaining time must be spent in the run state, so:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{run}} = T - T_{\\mathrm{pause}} = T - \\alpha T = (1 - \\alpha)T$$\n\nThe total displacement $D$ is the time integral of the instantaneous velocity over the interval $[0, T]$. We can partition this interval into a set of disjoint time segments where the cargo is running, which we denote $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{run}}$, and a set of disjoint time segments where it is paused, denoted $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{pause}}$. The union of these segments covers the entire interval $[0, T]$. The total measure of the segments in $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{run}}$ is $T_{\\mathrm{run}}$, and the total measure of the segments in $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{pause}}$ is $T_{\\mathrm{pause}}$.\n\nThe integral can be decomposed as follows:\n$$D = \\int_{0}^{T} v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t)\\,dt = \\int_{\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{run}}} v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t)\\,dt + \\int_{\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{pause}}} v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t)\\,dt$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, during the run phases, $v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t) = v$, a constant. During the pause phases, $v_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t) = 0$. Substituting these values into the integral:\n$$D = \\int_{\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{run}}} v\\,dt + \\int_{\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{pause}}} 0\\,dt$$\nSince $v$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the integral. The second term is identically zero.\n$$D = v \\int_{\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{run}}} dt + 0$$\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{run}}} dt$ is simply the total duration of the run intervals, which is $T_{\\mathrm{run}}$.\n$$D = v \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{run}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{run}}$:\n$$D = v (1 - \\alpha) T$$\nThis formula provides the total displacement. It is equivalent to defining an effective velocity $v_{\\mathrm{eff}} = v(1-\\alpha)$ and calculating the displacement as $D = v_{\\mathrm{eff}} T$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $D$. The given parameters are:\n$v = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\alpha = 0.30$\n$T = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n\nFor consistency of units, we must convert all quantities to a common system.

The result $90.72$ already has four significant figures. This displacement occurs over $T = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$, so the rate is $90.72\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,day}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the classification indicator $C$. The classification is based on the range for fast axonal transport, which is given as $[50, 400]\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,day}^{-1}$. Our computed daily displacement is $D = 90.72\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We check if this value falls within the specified range:\n$$50 \\le 90.72 \\le 400$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the observed transport process is classified as fast axonal transport.\nAccording to the definition of the indicator $C$, if the displacement falls within the fast range, then $C=1$.\nThus, $C=1$.\n\nThe two computed quantities are the displacement $D = 90.72\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the indicator $C=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 90.72 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2699477"}, {"introduction": "While fast transport delivers organelles over long distances daily, slow axonal transport moves cytoskeletal and cytosolic proteins at a much more languid pace.
