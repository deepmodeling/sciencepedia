In the bustling environment of the cell, the movement of a cargo is rarely a straight path, often involving a competitive \"tug-of-war\" between motors moving in opposite directions. This exercise provides a concrete calculation to connect Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) consumption, the discrete steps of kinesin and dynein, and the resulting net displacement of a vesicle, offering a foundational understanding of the energetic cost of intracellular logistics [@problem_id:2325968].", "problem": "In a neuron, a synaptic vesicle is transported along a microtubule track. This transport is powered by molecular motors that consume chemical energy. The primary motor for forward (anterograde) transport is kinesin.\n\nAssume the vesicle moves forward in discrete steps, each of size $d_k = 8.0 \\, \\text{nm}$. Every forward step is driven by the hydrolysis of a single molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nHowever, the transport process is not perfectly efficient due to the presence of dynein motors that can transiently cause backward (retrograde) movement. For every 10 forward steps taken by the vesicle, a dynein motor pulls the vesicle back by a single step of size $d_d = 8.0 \\, \\text{nm}$.

Whenever at least one motor is bound to the MT, the cargo advances with constant velocity $v$ (load is negligible). Each bound motor detaches independently with a constant detachment rate $k_\\text{off}$ (Poisson unbinding, exponential waiting time). While the cargo is on the MT (i.e., while at least one motor is bound), each unbound motor reattaches independently to the MT with a constant reattachment rate $k_\\text{on}$ (Poisson binding, exponential waiting time). If all motors detach simultaneously, the cargo leaves the MT and transport terminates irreversibly (no reattachment from the fully detached state).

The cargo moves at a constant velocity $v$ for the entire duration that at least one motor is bound. This duration, starting from state $1$, is precisely the mean time to absorption, $T_1$.

The units are consistent: $v$ has units of length per time, and the rates $k_\\text{on}$, $k_\\text{off}$ have units of inverse time. The expression for $T_1$ has units of time, so $L=vT_1$ has units of length.

This problem challenges you to think like an experimental biophysicist designing a state-of-the-art single-molecule assay. You will need to synthesize your understanding of the physical principles behind optical trapping and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, the very techniques that allow us to observe and manipulate individual motor proteins in action and validate the models we build [@problem_id:2732320]. Mastering these concepts is essential for critically evaluating primary literature and appreciating the empirical basis of our knowledge.", "problem": "You are designing a single-molecule assay to study the stepping of kinesin and dynein under load by combining an optical trap with Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. A polystyrene bead with refractive index greater than the surrounding aqueous medium is attached to a single motor protein that walks on a microtubule immobilized on a glass coverslip. A high numerical aperture objective is used for trapping and for forming the evanescent field. Bead position is reported as a voltage from a Quadrant Photodiode (QPD), and you must report motor-generated force as a function of displacement, while simultaneously imaging with TIRF to localize the motor near the surface and reduce background.\n\nWhich option correctly states the physical principles that enable optical trapping and TIRF in this context and outlines a scientifically sound calibration workflow to convert the QPD voltage signal to force on the bead?\n\nA. Optical trapping works because radiation pressure from scattering pushes the bead into the intensity maximum; trap stiffness depends primarily on bead charge. Calibration is done by increasing laser power until the bead no longer diffuses and equating that to the motor stall force. TIRF uses subcritical incidence angles to create a standing wave that penetrates deeply into the sample.\n\nB. Optical trapping works because the intensity gradient force arising from refractive index mismatch draws the bead toward the focus, and near the center the trap behaves as an approximately harmonic potential. To convert displacement to force, first calibrate QPD volts-to-distance by scanning the bead through the trap focus with a known stage motion, then determine trap stiffness using either equilibrium thermal fluctuations or the power spectral method while accounting for hydrodynamic drag near the surface, and finally compute force from the product of stiffness and displacement. TIRF is generated when the incidence angle exceeds the critical angle at a higher-to-lower refractive index interface, producing an evanescent field that decays exponentially with distance from the interface, thereby selectively exciting fluorophores near the surface.\n\nC. Optical trapping reads out force directly from laser power because the momentum flux uniquely determines force without any additional information. No calibration is required if laser power is known. TIRF operates by driving fluorophores into saturation so that only those bound to the surface remain fluorescent.\n\nD. Optical trapping arises from photothermal gradients that heat the bead above the medium; calibration is performed by measuring the bead’s resonance frequency in water. TIRF is produced by diffraction through a pinhole placed at the back focal plane, which confines light to the immediate vicinity of the coverslip.\n\nE. Optical trapping in this assay is dominated by the gradient force, and to convert displacement to force one may use a Stokes drag calibration by moving the fluid at a known velocity and equating viscous drag to trap force, performed far from any surface so that no correction is needed; this force–displacement relationship is then applied during the experiment. TIRF relies on total internal reflection, and the evanescent field intensity increases with distance from the interface, allowing deeper structures to be illuminated more strongly.", "solution": "First, we analyze the physical principles of the two techniques.\n\n**Optical Trapping**:\nAn optical trap uses a tightly focused laser beam to exert forces on a microscopic dielectric particle. For a particle with refractive index $n_{p}$ suspended in a medium of refractive index $n_{m}$, where $n_{p} > n_{m}$ (as stated in the problem), the dominant force is the **gradient force**. The intense, non-uniform electric field of the focused beam induces a dipole in the dielectric particle. This dipole is then pulled towards the region of highest field intensity, i.e., the focal point. Near the center of the trap, the restoring force on the bead is, to a good approximation, linear with displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position, creating an approximately harmonic potential.\n\n**Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy**:\nTIRF is a technique used to selectively excite fluorophores in a thin region near a surface. It occurs when light propagating from a higher refractive index medium (glass) to a lower refractive index medium (water) strikes the interface at an angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ greater than the critical angle, $\\theta_c$. The light is totally reflected, but an electromagnetic field called the **evanescent wave** penetrates a short distance (typically ~100 nm) into the lower-index medium. The intensity of this field decays exponentially with distance from the interface. This selective, near-surface illumination dramatically reduces background fluorescence.\n\n**Calibration Workflow (QPD Voltage to Force)**\nTo convert the raw voltage signal from the QPD into a force measurement, a two-step calibration is required.\n1.  **Displacement Calibration**: The QPD output voltage is related to the bead's physical displacement. This is achieved by scanning a trapped bead through the laser focus with a known stage motion and measuring the linear relationship between voltage and distance.\n2.  **Stiffness Calibration**: The trap stiffness, $\\kappa$, must be determined. This allows conversion from displacement to force via $F = \\kappa x$. Standard methods include analyzing the power spectrum of the bead's Brownian motion (which must account for increased hydrodynamic drag near the surface) or using the equipartition theorem, which relates the variance of the bead's position fluctuations to thermal energy ($k_B T$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A**: Incorrect. Trapping is dominated by the gradient force, not scattering pressure. TIRF requires a supercritical, not subcritical, angle, and creates a shallow evanescent field, not a deep standing wave.\n*   **B**: Correct. This statement accurately describes the gradient force and harmonic potential for trapping. It outlines a standard, rigorous calibration workflow (volts-to-distance scan, stiffness calibration via thermal fluctuations/power spectrum, accounting for surface hydrodynamics). It also correctly describes TIRF physics (supercritical angle, higher-to-lower index interface, exponentially decaying evanescent field, surface selectivity).\n*   **C**: Incorrect. Force depends on both laser power (which sets stiffness) and measured displacement. Calibration is essential. The TIRF description is wrong.\n*   **D**: Incorrect. This confuses optical trapping with photophoresis and TIRF with confocal microscopy (which uses a pinhole).\n*   **E**: Incorrect. It correctly identifies the Stokes' drag calibration method but makes a critical error by stating it should be performed far from the surface without correction, which would not match the experimental conditions. The evanescent field intensity decreases, not increases, with distance.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the only fully correct description of both the physical principles and the required calibration methodology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2732320"}]}
