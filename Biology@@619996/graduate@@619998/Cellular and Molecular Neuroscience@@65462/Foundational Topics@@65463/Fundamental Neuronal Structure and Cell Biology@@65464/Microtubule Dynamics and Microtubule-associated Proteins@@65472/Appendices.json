This practice introduces the concept of the critical concentration, a fundamental threshold in polymer dynamics. By modeling the microtubule end as a site of simple subunit addition and loss, you will derive how the balance between the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, defines a specific tubulin concentration at which net growth is zero [@problem_id:2726118]. Mastering this concept is key to understanding how cells control microtubule assembly and disassembly.", "problem": "In a simplified kinetic model for the plus-end of a neuronal microtubule, the association of soluble tubulin heterodimers with the terminal binding site follows mass-action kinetics with an association rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ (units $\\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), while dissociation of a terminal subunit occurs with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ (units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Let $[T]$ denote the concentration of free, assembly-competent tubulin in solution. The instantaneous mean growth velocity of the microtubule plus end, $v_{+}$, along a single protofilament is defined as the axial length increment per subunit addition, $\\delta$, multiplied by the net subunit incorporation rate (association minus dissociation).

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It represents a fundamental, non-trivial calculation in the study of cytoskeletal dynamics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the stall concentration $[T]_{s}$, where the net growth velocity $v_{+}$ is zero.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of association of tubulin subunits to the microtubule end, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is a bimolecular process. It is proportional to the concentration of free tubulin, $[T]$, and the number of available binding sites. For a single protofilament end, the rate of association events (in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is given by:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T]$$\nThe rate of dissociation, $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is given as a first-order process, meaning it depends only on the presence of a terminal subunit and is independent of the free tubulin concentration. The rate of dissociation events is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nThe net rate of subunit incorporation, $J$, is the difference between the association and dissociation rates:\n$$J = R_{\\mathrm{on}} - R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nThe mean growth velocity, $v_{+}$, is defined as the product of the length increment per subunit, $\\delta$, and the net incorporation rate, $J$.\n$$v_{+} = \\delta \\cdot J = \\delta (k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}})$$\nGrowth is stalled when $v_{+} = 0$. The tubulin concentration at which this occurs is denoted $[T]_{s}$. We set the expression for $v_{+}$ to zero:\n$$0 = \\delta (k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]_{s} - k_{\\mathrm{off}})$$\nGiven that the length increment $\\delta$ is a non-zero physical constant, the term in parentheses must be equal to zero for the equation to hold:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]_{s} - k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 0$$\nSolving for $[T]_{s}$ yields the analytical expression for the stall concentration:\n$$[T]_{s} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nNow, we evaluate $[T]_{s}$ numerically using the provided values: $k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 3\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$[T]_{s} = \\frac{6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{3\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $2$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $2$, which can be written as $2.0$ to indicate two significant figures. The units are $\\mu \\mathrm{M}$, as required.\n\n**Physical Interpretation of $[T]_{s}$**\nThe concentration $[T]_{s}$ represents the **critical concentration** for polymerization at the microtubule plus end. At this specific concentration of free tubulin, the rate of subunit addition ($R_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]_{s}$) is precisely balanced by the rate of subunit loss ($R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$). Consequently, there is no net change in the length of the microtubule, and the mean growth velocity is zero.\n\nIf the ambient tubulin concentration $[T]$ is greater than $[T]_{s}$, the rate of association will exceed the rate of dissociation ($R_{\\mathrm{on}} > R_{\\mathrm{off}}$), resulting in net polymerization ($v_{+} > 0$). Conversely, if $[T]$ is less than $[T]_{s}$, the rate of dissociation will be greater than the rate of association ($R_{\\mathrm{off}} > R_{\\mathrm{on}}$), leading to net depolymerization ($v_{+} < 0$).\n\nThe expression $[T]_{s} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ quantitatively demonstrates how this critical concentration is determined by the intrinsic kinetics of the system. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) function by modulating these rate constants. For example, a stabilizing MAP (e.g., Tau, MAP2) would typically decrease the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, thereby lowering the critical concentration $[T]_{s}$ and promoting microtubule assembly or stability at lower tubulin concentrations. Conversely, a destabilizing protein (e.g., a kinesin from the Kinesin-13 family) might increase $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, raising $[T]_{s}$ and favoring disassembly. Therefore, $[T]_{s}$ is not a fixed universal constant but rather a dynamic parameter reflecting the specific cellular environment, including the local activities of various MAPs that influence the fundamental on- and off-rates at the microtubule end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.0}$$", "id": "2726118"}, {"introduction": "While intrinsic polymerization is fundamental, cells actively control microtubule growth using a suite of Microtubule-Associated Proteins (MAPs).

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe total elongation velocity of the microtubule, $v$, is the linear sum of the basal velocity, $v_0$, and the velocity component contributed by the catalytic activity of XMAP215, which we denote as $v_X$. This is based on the stated assumption of independent processes.\n$$v = v_{0} + v_{X}$$\nThe velocity contribution from XMAP215, $v_X$, is determined by the rate at which XMAP215 adds tubulin dimers. This rate is the product of the intrinsic catalytic turnover rate of a single bound XMAP215 molecule, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ (in units of turnovers per second, or dimers per second), the probability that the single binding site at the plus-end is occupied by an XMAP215 molecule, $P_{\\mathrm{occ}}$, and the length added per catalytic event, $d$.\n$$v_{X} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{occ}} \\cdot d$$\nThe problem specifies that the binding and unbinding of XMAP215 is fast, justifying a quasi-steady-state assumption for the occupancy of the single binding site. This is formally equivalent to a simple ligand-receptor binding model. The probability of the site being occupied, $P_{\\mathrm{occ}}$, follows the law of mass action and is given by:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{occ}} = \\frac{[X]}{K_{D} + [X]}$$\nwhere $[X]$ is the concentration of the ligand (XMAP215) and $K_{D}$ is the dissociation constant. The problem provides an apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{M}$, which in this simplified single-site binding model, is equivalent to the dissociation constant, so we use $K_{M}$ in place of $K_{D}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{occ}} = \\frac{[X]}{K_{M} + [X]}$$\nBy substituting the expressions for $v_X$ and $P_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ back into the equation for total velocity, we obtain a complete model:\n$$v = v_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\cdot d \\cdot \\left( \\frac{[X]}{K_{M} + [X]} \\right)$$\nThe task is to derive an expression for $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.

Tau protein bound to microtubules acts as a physical obstacle for motor proteins like kinesin-1. Therefore, a reduction in tau occupancy has two primary consequences for kinesin-1-mediated transport. First, with fewer sites occupied by tau, there is a higher probability for kinesin-1 to find an unobstructed binding site on the microtubule, which is expected to increase its landing rate. Second, once a kinesin-1 motor begins moving along the microtubule, a lower density of tau obstacles reduces the probability of premature detachment. This is expected to increase the average run length of the motor. Consequently, phosphorylation of tau, by reducing its microtubule occupancy, facilitates more efficient anterograde transport by increasing both the landing rate and run length of kinesin-1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2174}$$", "id": "2726082"}]}
