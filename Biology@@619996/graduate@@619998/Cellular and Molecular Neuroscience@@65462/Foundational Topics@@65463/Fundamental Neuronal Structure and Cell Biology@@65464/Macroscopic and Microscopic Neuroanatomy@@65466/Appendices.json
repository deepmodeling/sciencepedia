It is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the attenuation factor $a$ in a simplified electrical model of a dendritic spine. The spine neck acts as a resistor, $R_{\\text{neck}}$, in series with the input resistance of the parent dendrite, $R_{d}$. This configuration forms a classic voltage divider circuit. The voltage in the spine head, $V_{\\text{head}}$, is the input voltage to this circuit, and the voltage at the dendrite, $V_{d}$, is the output voltage measured across the dendritic resistance $R_{d}$.\n\nFirst, we must find an expression for the resistance of the spine neck, $R_{\\text{neck}}$. The neck is modeled as a uniform cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. The resistance $R$ of a conductor is related to its resistivity $\\rho$, length $L$, and cross-sectional area $A$ by the formula:\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$$\nFor a cylinder, the cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi r^2$. Substituting this into the resistance formula gives the expression for the neck resistance:\n$$R_{\\text{neck}} = \\rho \\frac{L}{\\pi r^2}$$\n\nNext, we apply the voltage divider rule to the series circuit formed by $R_{\\text{neck}}$ and $R_{d}$. The voltage across the dendritic resistance, $V_{d}$, is given by:\n$$V_{d} = V_{\\text{head}} \\left( \\frac{R_{d}}{R_{\\text{neck}} + R_{d}} \\right)$$\nThe attenuation factor $a$ is defined as the ratio $a = V_{d} / V_{\\text{head}}$. Rearranging the voltage divider equation gives:\n$$a = \\frac{V_{d}}{V_{\\text{head}}} = \\frac{R_{d}}{R_{\\text{neck}} + R_{d}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the attenuation factor. To express it in terms of the fundamental parameters, we substitute the expression for $R_{\\text{neck}}$:\n$$a = \\frac{R_{d}}{\\rho \\frac{L}{\\pi r^2} + R_{d}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must evaluate $a$ numerically.

The search interval is set to $[0, 100.0]$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the function to be minimized, $f(k) = -\\widehat{K}(k)$, using the specific parameters $(w_e, \\lambda_e, w_i, \\lambda_i)$ for the case.\n2.  Use a numerical optimizer to find the value $k^\\star$ that minimizes $f(k)$ in the interval $k \\in [0, 100.0]$.\n3.  Once $k^\\star$ is determined, calculate the predicted OD column half-width $W$ using the provided formula:\n    $$\n    W = \\frac{\\pi}{k^\\star}\n    $$\n    Note that for the given parameter sets, a non-zero $k^\\star$ is expected, indicating the formation of a finite-wavelength pattern. If $k^\\star$ were to be zero, $W$ would be infinite, signifying no pattern formation.\n4.  Compute the absolute error $E$ by comparing the predicted width $W$ to the measured width $W_{\\mathrm{meas}}$:\n    $$\n    E = \\left| W - W_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\right|\n    $$\n5.  Round the final error $E$ to exactly three decimal places as required.\n\nThis procedure will be systematically applied to each of the four cases provided in the test suite.
