A base-level error at position $i$ is defined as any outcome in which the intended nucleotide is not correctly incorporated at that cycle; let $E_i$ denote the event that a base-level error occurs at cycle $i$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and probability theory. The model, which assumes a constant and independent coupling efficiency, is a standard and appropriate simplification for a first-principles analysis. All terms are defined quantitatively, such as coupling efficiency $c$ and maximum error rate $r$. The numerical value for $r$ is realistic for clinical-grade synthesis. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective, with no missing information or internal contradictions. It does not violate any fundamental principles and is structured to permit a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may be pursued.\n\nThe solution proceeds from first principles. The per-cycle coupling efficiency, $c$, is the probability of a successful nucleotide incorporation in a single cycle. A base-level error, $E_i$, is the complement to a successful incorporation. As these two outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for a given cycle, their probabilities must sum to $1$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\text{success at cycle } i) + \\mathbb{P}(E_i) = 1 $$\nTherefore, the probability of a base-level error in cycle $i$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E_i) = 1 - c $$\nThe problem states the regulatory constraint on this error rate is $\\mathbb{P}(E_i) \\le r$. Substituting our expression for $\\mathbb{P}(E_i)$ yields:\n$$ 1 - c \\le r $$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to provide a lower bound on the required coupling efficiency to satisfy the per-base error specification:\n$$ c \\ge 1 - r $$\n\nNext, we consider the entire oligonucleotide of length $n = 20$. An oligonucleotide is defined as \"acceptable\" if it is error-free. This corresponds to the event that a successful coupling occurs in every one of the $n$ cycles. Let $A$ be the event that the synthesized oligonucleotide is acceptable. Since the coupling cycles are specified as being independent events, the probability of $A$ is the product of the probabilities of success in each individual cycle.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(A) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{success at cycle } i) $$\nAs the coupling efficiency $c$ is constant for all cycles, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(A) = c^n $$\nThis quantity, $\\mathbb{P}(A)$, represents the fraction of error-free $n$-mers. We must now relate this fraction to the maximum allowable error rate $r$. From the inequality $c \\ge 1-r$, and because the function $f(c) = c^n$ is monotonically increasing for $c \\in (0,1)$ and $n > 0$, we can establish a lower bound on the fraction of acceptable oligonucleotides:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(A) = c^n \\ge (1-r)^n $$\nThis is the bound relating the fraction of error-free oligonucleotides to $r$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum coupling efficiency, $c_{\\min}$, that guarantees the fraction of error-free 20-mers is at least the \"conservative level implied by the basewise specification.\" The basewise specification is $\\mathbb{P}(E_i) \\le r$. The most conservative interpretation corresponds to the worst-case scenario permitted by this rule, which is when the error rate is at its maximum allowed value, $\\mathbb{P}(E_i) = r$. The coupling efficiency that produces this error rate is $c = 1-r$. The fraction of error-free oligonucleotides synthesized under this worst-case efficiency is therefore $(1-r)^n$. This is the \"conservative level\" mentioned.\n\nWe are required to find the minimum efficiency $c_{\\min}$ that guarantees the actual fraction of error-free products, $c^n$, is at least this conservative level. This leads to the inequality:\n$$ c^n \\ge (1-r)^n $$\nSince $c$, $r$, and $n$ are all positive, with $c, r \\in (0,1)$, we can take the $n$-th root of both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ c \\ge 1-r $$\nThe minimum value of $c$ that satisfies this condition is therefore:\n$$ c_{\\min} = 1-r $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values to find the result. We are given $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $n=20$. The value of $n$ is not required for the final calculation of $c_{\\min}$, as the logic dictates the condition must hold on a per-base level.\n$$ c_{\\min} = 1 - 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995 $$\nThis value is already expressed to four significant figures, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9995}$$", "id": "2720371"}, {"introduction": "Optimizing chemical synthesis is often a balancing act against side reactions.

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem describes two competing, irreversible, pseudo-first-order reactions: detritylation (det) and depurination (dep). The rates of these reactions depend on the constant acid activity, $a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the detritylation reaction. The fraction of DMT-protected sites remaining at time $t'$, denoted as $f_{\\mathrm{DMT}}(t')$, follows the first-order decay law:\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{\\mathrm{DMT}}}{dt'} = -k_{\\mathrm{det}} f_{\\mathrm{DMT}}\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{det}} = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{det}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant.

The \"probability of depurination per cycle\" corresponds to the fraction of susceptible purine sites that have been removed during the acid exposure time $t$. Let $f_{\\mathrm{P}}(t')$ be the fraction of intact purine sites at time $t'$. This process also follows first-order kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{\\mathrm{P}}}{dt'} = -k_{\\mathrm{dep}} f_{\\mathrm{P}}\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{dep}} = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{dep}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$.
