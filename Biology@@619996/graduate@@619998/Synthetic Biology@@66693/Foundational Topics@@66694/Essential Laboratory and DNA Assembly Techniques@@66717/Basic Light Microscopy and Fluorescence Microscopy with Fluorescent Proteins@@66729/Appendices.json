In your reasoning, determine which fluorophore is brighter under the stated identical excitation conditions.", "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the relationship between single-molecule brightness and the photophysical parameters of molar extinction coefficient, $\\epsilon$, and fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_f$. We must begin from the provided foundational principles.\n\nFirst, we relate the macroscopic Beer-Lambert law to the microscopic absorption process. The Beer-Lambert law states that for a solution with molar concentration $c$ and path length $l$, the absorbance is $A = \\epsilon c l$. The transmitted intensity $I_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is related to the incident intensity $I_{\\mathrm{in}}$ by $I_{\\mathrm{out}} = I_{\\mathrm{in}} 10^{-A}$. The fraction of incident photons absorbed by the bulk solution is therefore $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{in}} - I_{\\mathrm{out}}}{I_{\\mathrm{in}}} = 1 - 10^{-A}$. Using the identity $10^x = \\exp(x \\ln(10))$, the absorbed fraction is $1 - \\exp(-A \\ln(10))$. For the specified condition of low absorbance, $A \\ll 1$, we can use the first-order Taylor series approximation $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for a small argument $x = A \\ln(10)$. Thus, the fraction of absorbed photons is approximately $1 - (1 - A \\ln(10)) = A \\ln(10) = \\epsilon c l \\ln(10)$. This confirms the given premise that the absorbed fraction is linear in $A$.\n\nNext, we establish a microscopic model for absorption to derive the single-molecule absorption cross-section, $\\sigma$. Consider a thin slab of the solution of area $S$ and infinitesimal thickness $dl$. The change in photon flux density, $dF_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, as the light beam traverses this slab is proportional to the incident flux density $F_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, the number density of absorbers $\\rho$, and the thickness $dl$. The constant of proportionality is the absorption cross-section $\\sigma$. This gives the differential equation $dF_{\\mathrm{ex}} = -F_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\sigma \\rho dl$. Separating variables yields $\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{F_{\\mathrm{ex}}} = -\\sigma \\rho dl$. Integrating this from the front of the sample ($z=0$) to the back ($z=l$) gives $\\int_{F_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{F_{\\mathrm{out}}} \\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{F_{\\mathrm{ex}}} = \\int_{0}^{l} -\\sigma \\rho dz$, which evaluates to $\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{out}}}{F_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) = -\\sigma \\rho l$. Exponentiating both sides gives $F_{\\mathrm{out}} = F_{\\mathrm{in}} \\exp(-\\sigma \\rho l)$. Since intensity $I$ is directly proportional to photon flux $F$, we can write $I_{\\mathrm{out}} = I_{\\mathrm{in}} \\exp(-\\sigma \\rho l)$.\n\nWe now equate the macroscopic and microscopic expressions for light attenuation:\n$I_{\\mathrm{in}} \\exp(-\\epsilon c l \\ln(10)) = I_{\\mathrm{in}} \\exp(-\\sigma \\rho l)$.\nThis implies $\\epsilon c l \\ln(10) = \\sigma \\rho l$. The path length $l$ cancels. We must relate the molar concentration $c$ (in $\\mathrm{mol/L}$) to the number density $\\rho$ (in molecules/$\\mathrm{cm}^3$). Using Avogadro's constant $N_A$ and the conversion $1 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$, the number density is $\\rho = \\frac{c N_A}{1000}$. Substituting this into our equation gives:\n$\\epsilon c \\ln(10) = \\sigma \\left(\\frac{c N_A}{1000}\\right)$.\nThe concentration $c$ cancels, yielding the fundamental relationship between the molar extinction coefficient and the single-molecule absorption cross-section:\n$\\sigma = \\frac{1000 \\ln(10)}{N_A} \\epsilon$.\n\nThe problem states that the per-molecule emission rate of fluorescence, which we denote $R_{\\mathrm{em}}$, is proportional to the product of the molecular absorption probability per unit time and the fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_f$. The molecular absorption probability per unit time for a single molecule in an excitation field of photon flux density $F_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is given by the product $\\sigma F_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\nThus, the emission rate is $R_{\\mathrm{em}} = (\\sigma F_{\\mathrm{ex}}) \\Phi_f$.\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\sigma$:\n$R_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\left(\\frac{1000 \\ln(10)}{N_A} \\epsilon\\right) F_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\Phi_f$.\nFor the comparison of two fluorescent proteins under identical excitation conditions, $F_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is a constant. The terms $1000$, $\\ln(10)$, and $N_A$ are also constants. Therefore, the single-molecule emission rate is directly proportional to the product $\\epsilon \\Phi_f$:\n$R_{\\mathrm{em}} \\propto \\epsilon \\Phi_f$.\n\nThe relative molecular brightness $B$ is defined to be proportional to this product, so we can set $B = K \\epsilon \\Phi_f$, where $K$ is a constant of proportionality. We are tasked with computing the ratio $R = \\frac{B_1}{B_2}$ for fluorescent protein $\\mathrm{FP1}$ relative to $\\mathrm{FP2}$:\n$R = \\frac{K \\epsilon_1 \\Phi_{f,1}}{K \\epsilon_2 \\Phi_{f,2}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_1 \\Phi_{f,1}}{\\epsilon_2 \\Phi_{f,2}}$.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nFor $\\mathrm{FP1}$: $\\epsilon_1 = 60,000 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}cm^{-1}}$ and $\\Phi_{f,1} = 0.7$.\nFor $\\mathrm{FP2}$: $\\epsilon_2 = 110,000 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}cm^{-1}}$ and $\\Phi_{f,2} = 0.3$.\n\nFirst, let us determine which fluorophore is brighter by comparing the products $\\epsilon \\Phi_f$:\nFor $\\mathrm{FP1}$: $B_1 \\propto \\epsilon_1 \\Phi_{f,1} = 60,000 \\times 0.7 = 42,000$.\nFor $\\mathrm{FP2}$: $B_2 \\propto \\epsilon_2 \\Phi_{f,2} = 110,000 \\times 0.3 = 33,000$.\nSince $42,000 > 33,000$, the brightness of $\\mathrm{FP1}$ is greater than the brightness of $\\mathrm{FP2}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{FP1}$ is the brighter fluorophore under the stated conditions.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$R = \\frac{60,000 \\times 0.7}{110,000 \\times 0.3} = \\frac{42,000}{33,000} = \\frac{42}{33} = \\frac{14}{11}$.\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures as requested:\n$R = \\frac{14}{11} \\approx 1.272727...$\nRounding gives $R \\approx 1.273$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.273}$$", "id": "2716060"}, {"introduction": "Once a photon is emitted from a fluorescent protein, the microscope's optics dictate the fundamental physical limit of how sharply that photon can be localized.
