After background correction and log transformation using the natural logarithm, the following variance components were estimated: between-biological replicate standard deviation $s_{b} = 0.50$ (so $s_{b}^{2} = 0.25$) and within-biological, between-technical replicate standard deviation $s_{t} = 0.30$ (so $s_{t}^{2} = 0.09$).

It is a well-constructed problem that tests the ability to interpret experimental data in molecular biology. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal of this Northern blot experiment is to detect a single, sharp band corresponding to a $3.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ $mRNA$. A successful outcome requires three conditions to be met: 1) high-quality, intact $RNA$; 2) complete denaturation of $RNA$ into a linear form; and 3) proper electrophoresis conditions that ensure size-dependent separation without artifacts. We will analyze each experimental run in the context of these requirements.\n\n**Analysis of Run $\\mathrm{R1}$**\n- The total $RNA$ quality is exceedingly poor, as shown by the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of $3.5$ and a $28\\mathrm{S}\\!:\\!18\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal $RNA$ ratio of $0.8\\!:\\!1$. For high-quality, intact $RNA$, a RIN score should ideally be $> 8.0$, and the $28\\mathrm{S}\\!:\\!18\\mathrm{S}$ ratio should be approximately $2.0\\!:\\!1$. The observed values are definitive indicators of significant $RNA$ degradation.\n- The observation of a smear from $0.2\\text{–}4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ in the sample lane is the expected result for degraded $RNA$, where the target molecule has been fragmented into pieces of various smaller sizes.\n- Crucially, the synthetic $RNA$ ladder, which was added just before loading the gel, appears sharp. This demonstrates that the gel matrix, buffer, and electrophoresis conditions themselves are not the cause of the smearing. The ladder was not subjected to the same sample preparation steps (e.g., cell lysis, $RNA$ extraction) as the experimental sample.\n- The decisive piece of evidence is the replicate experiment: when an RNase inhibitor was added during cell lysis, the $RNA$ quality was high (RIN $= 9.0$) and a sharp band was obtained. This directly establishes a causal link between RNase activity during sample preparation and the degradation observed in the initial $\\mathrm{R1}$ experiment.\n\n**Analysis of Run $\\mathrm{R2}$**\n- The total $RNA$ quality is excellent (RIN $= 8.9$, $28\\mathrm{S}\\!:\\!18\\mathrm{S}$ ratio $= 2.0\\!:\\!1$), so pre-gel degradation is not the issue.\n- The electrophoresis was run at a high electric field ($10\\,\\mathrm{V/cm}$), which is double that of $\\mathrm{R1}$ and $\\mathrm{R3}$. Joule heating is proportional to the square of the voltage, so this significantly increased heat generation. This is confirmed by the high maximum gel temperature of $58\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Both the sample and the ladder bands are broadened and fuzzy. Since the ladder was not degraded, this artifact must stem from the electrophoresis step itself. High temperature increases the thermal energy of the molecules, leading to an increased diffusion coefficient ($D$), as described by the Einstein–Stokes relation, $D \\propto T$. Increased diffusion causes molecules to spread out from the center of the band, resulting in broadening.\n- The \"smiling\" effect observed is a classic symptom of gel overheating, where the center of the gel is hotter than the edges, causing $RNA$ in the center to migrate faster and creating a curved band front.\n- Therefore, the artifacts in $\\mathrm{R2}$ are attributable to overheating during electrophoresis.\n\n**Analysis of Run $\\mathrm{R3}$**\n- The total $RNA$ quality is excellent (RIN $= 9.1$, $28\\mathrm{S}\\!:\\!18\\mathrm{S}$ ratio $= 2.0\\!:\\!1$), ruling out degradation as the primary problem. Electrophoresis conditions were cool ($28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n- The key variables are the denaturing conditions. The formaldehyde concentration was low ($0.8\\,\\mathrm{M}$ vs. the standard $2.2\\,\\mathrm{M}$) and the stock was \"aged,\" suggesting its concentration might be even lower due to polymerization or oxidation. Additionally, the sample heat denaturation step was shorter and at a lower temperature ($5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at $50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ vs. $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at $65\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n- Formaldehyde is the chemical denaturant responsible for breaking hydrogen bonds in $RNA$ secondary structures (e.g., hairpins). Insufficient denaturation means the $RNA$ molecules are not fully linearized. They can exist in a population of various partially folded conformers.\n- These different conformers have different hydrodynamic radii ($r$) and will thus migrate at different speeds through the gel matrix, which separates based on size and shape. This leads to fuzzy or multiple bands. Folded structures can also migrate slower than their linear counterparts, leading to an apparent molecular weight greater than the actual, as observed (\"sizes exceeding expected lengths\"). This explains the fuzzy bands and shoulders. The problem affected both the ladder and the sample, consistent with a global problem in denaturation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In $\\mathrm{R1}$, RNase-mediated RNA degradation upstream of gel loading is the primary cause of smearing.**\nThis conclusion is strongly supported. The low RIN score and aberrant $28\\mathrm{S}\\!:\\!18\\mathrm{S}$ ratio indicate severe degradation. The sharp ladder rules out gel-related issues. The control experiment with RNase inhibitor yielding a perfect result provides definitive proof.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In $\\mathrm{R2}$, gel overheating during electrophoresis plausibly accounts for smearing of both sample and ladder.**\nThis conclusion is also strongly supported. The high-quality starting $RNA$ rules out degradation. The high voltage, high logged temperature, \"smiling\" artifact, and broadening of *both* ladder and sample bands are all classic signs of Joule heating. The increased diffusion at high temperature ($D \\propto T$) is the physical mechanism for band broadening.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In $\\mathrm{R3}$, incomplete denaturation due to insufficient formaldehyde and suboptimal sample heating is a primary cause of smearing.**\nThis conclusion is well-supported. The high-quality $RNA$ and cool running conditions point away from degradation or overheating. The explicit mention of low/aged formaldehyde and suboptimal heat treatment directly points to a failure in denaturation. The observed artifacts—multiple conformers, anomalous migration leading to apparently larger sizes—are the precise consequences of incomplete denaturation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Probe degradation and hybridization stringency, not gel or RNA quality, are the dominant contributors to smearing in all three runs.**\nThis conclusion is incorrect and contradicted by the data. First, the problems (smearing, broadening) were observed on the pre-transfer gels stained with ethidium bromide, *before* any probe hybridization occurred. Second, the problem states that a control hybridization to the ladder probe showed the same physical broadening, confirming the defect lies in the gel step, not hybridization. Third, the nature of the artifacts is different in each run and correlates perfectly with specific issues of $RNA$ quality ($\\mathrm{R1}$), electrophoresis conditions ($\\mathrm{R2}$), or denaturing conditions ($\\mathrm{R3}$). It is illogical to attribute these distinct problems to a single, constant factor like the probe.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2754762"}, {"introduction": "The final step in quantitative blotting—data normalization—is fraught with subtle pitfalls that can undermine an entire study.

Let the loaded total protein masses be $L_{C} = [20, 19, 21]$ and $L_{T} = [20, 18, 21]$ in units of $\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ for control and treatment, respectively, reflecting minor pipetting variation.\n- Let the per-$\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ abundance of the target protein be $t_{C} = 1.0$ and $t_{T} = 0.8$ arbitrary intensity units per $\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ in control and treatment, respectively, reflecting a true $20\\%$ decrease under treatment.\n- A commonly used housekeeping protein $H$ has per-$\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ abundance $h_{C} = 1.0$ and $h_{T} = 0.5$ in control and treatment, respectively, reflecting a treatment-induced $50\\%$ decrease (unknown to the experimenter).\n- A second reference protein $H_{1}$ is biologically stable with per-$\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ abundance $h_{1,C} = 1.0$ and $h_{1,T} = 1.0$.\n- A stain of total protein signal $S$ reports the total loaded mass in each lane, so its intensity per $\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ is constant and equal to $1.0$.\n\nAssume all detection is within the linear range and the proportionality constant converting amount to intensity is the same across lanes for a given analyte, so that band intensities equal per-$\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ abundance times $L$.\n\nYou will consider three normalization strategies for the target: normalization to $H$ (divide target by $H$ band in each lane), normalization to $S$ (divide target by total protein signal in each lane), and normalization to the geometric mean of $H$ and $H_{1}$ (divide target by $\\sqrt{H \\cdot H_{1}}$ in each lane). The fold change for a given strategy is defined as the mean normalized target in treatment divided by the mean normalized target in control.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Normalizing the target to $H$ yields an apparent treatment versus control fold change greater than $1$ and equal to $1.6$ in this simulation, inverting the sign of the true change of $0.8$.\n\nB. Normalizing the target to the total protein signal $S$ yields a treatment versus control fold change equal to the true per-mass change of $0.8$, despite the minor loading variation.\n\nC. Normalizing the target to the geometric mean of $H$ and $H_{1}$ produces an unbiased estimate of the target fold change (equal to $0.8$) in this simulation.\n\nD. If one insists on using $H$, first rescaling each $H$ lane by the mean $H$ across all lanes and then dividing the target by this rescaled $H$ eliminates the inversion.\n\nE. Under linear detection, for any reference $R$ used for normalization, the apparent fold change of the target after normalization equals $\\dfrac{t_{T}/t_{C}}{r_{T}/r_{C}}$; therefore, whenever $r_{T}/r_{C} < t_{T}/t_{C} < 1$, the normalized estimate exceeds $1$ and inverts the true decrease.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Number of biological replicates per condition: $n=3$.\n- Loaded total protein masses for control: $L_{C} = [20, 19, 21]$ in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{g}$.\n- Loaded total protein masses for treatment: $L_{T} = [20, 18, 21]$ in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{g}$.\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of target protein in control: $t_{C} = 1.0$ (arbitrary units).\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of target protein in treatment: $t_{T} = 0.8$ (arbitrary units), a true $20\\%$ decrease.\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of housekeeping protein $H$ in control: $h_{C} = 1.0$.\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of housekeeping protein $H$ in treatment: $h_{T} = 0.5$, a treatment-induced $50\\%$ decrease.\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of stable reference protein $H_{1}$ in control: $h_{1,C} = 1.0$.\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of stable reference protein $H_{1}$ in treatment: $h_{1,T} = 1.0$.\n- Per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance of total protein signal $S$: constant and equal to $1.0$.\n- Principle: Band intensity is proportional to amount, and within the linear range, `intensity = per-µg abundance × L`.

The concepts of housekeeping genes, total protein normalization, and normalization-induced artifacts are central to quantitative biology. The premises are sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All variables and relationships are explicitly defined, allowing for a unique calculation for each proposed normalization strategy.\n- **Objective:** The problem is expressed using precise mathematical definitions and numerical data, free from subjective language.\n- The setup is internally consistent, complete, and poses a non-trivial but solvable challenge in data analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution and evaluation of options can proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe true fold change of the target protein is the ratio of its per-$\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ abundance under treatment versus control:\n$$FC_{true} = \\frac{t_{T}}{t_{C}} = \\frac{0.8}{1.0} = 0.8$$\nThis represents a $20\\%$ decrease.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected band intensities ($I$) for each analyte in each lane, using the formula $I = \\text{abundance} \\times L$.\n\n- **Target ($Tgt$):**\n  - Control: $I_{Tgt,C} = t_{C} \\cdot L_{C} = 1.0 \\cdot [20, 19, 21] = [20, 19, 21]$\n  - Treatment: $I_{Tgt,T} = t_{T} \\cdot L_{T} = 0.8 \\cdot [20, 18, 21] = [16, 14.4, 16.8]$\n\n- **Housekeeper ($H$):**\n  - Control: $I_{H,C} = h_{C} \\cdot L_{C} = 1.0 \\cdot [20, 19, 21] = [20, 19, 21]$\n  - Treatment: $I_{H,T} = h_{T} \\cdot L_{T} = 0.5 \\cdot [20, 18, 21] = [10, 9, 10.5]$\n\n- **Stable Reference ($H_{1}$):**\n  - Control: $I_{H_1,C} = h_{1,C} \\cdot L_{C} = 1.0 \\cdot [20, 19, 21] = [20, 19, 21]$\n  - Treatment: $I_{H_1,T} = h_{1,T} \\cdot L_{T} = 1.0 \\cdot [20, 18, 21] = [20, 18, 21]$\n\n- **Total Protein Signal ($S$):**\n  - Control: $I_{S,C} = 1.0 \\cdot L_{C} = [20, 19, 21]$\n  - Treatment: $I_{S,T} = 1.0 \\cdot L_{T} = [20, 18, 21]$\n\nThe apparent fold change ($FC_{app}$) is $\\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Normalized Treatment})}{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Normalized Control})}$.\n\n**A. Normalizing the target to $H$ yields an apparent treatment versus control fold change greater than $1$ and equal to $1.6$ in this simulation, inverting the sign of the true change of $0.8$.**\n\nNormalized Target = $I_{Tgt} / I_{H}$\n- Control: $N_{C} = [20/20, 19/19, 21/21] = [1, 1, 1]$. Mean($N_C$) = $1.0$.\n- Treatment: $N_{T} = [16/10, 14.4/9, 16.8/10.5] = [1.6, 1.6, 1.6]$. Mean($N_T$) = $1.6$.\nThe apparent fold change is $FC_{app} = \\frac{1.6}{1.0} = 1.6$.\nThis apparent increase ($1.6$) indeed inverts the true decrease ($0.8$). The statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. Normalizing the target to the total protein signal $S$ yields a treatment versus control fold change equal to the true per-mass change of $0.8$, despite the minor loading variation.**\n\nNormalized Target = $I_{Tgt} / I_{S}$\n- Control: $N_{C} = [20/20, 19/19, 21/21] = [1, 1, 1]$. Mean($N_C$) = $1.0$.\n- Treatment: $N_{T} = [16/20, 14.4/18, 16.8/21] = [0.8, 0.8, 0.8]$. Mean($N_T$) = $0.8$.\nThe apparent fold change is $FC_{app} = \\frac{0.8}{1.0} = 0.8$.\nThis accurately recovers the true fold change. The statement is **Correct**.\n\n**C. Normalizing the target to the geometric mean of $H$ and $H_{1}$ produces an unbiased estimate of the target fold change (equal to $0.8$) in this simulation.**\n\nNormalized Target = $I_{Tgt} / \\sqrt{I_{H} \\cdot I_{H_{1}}}$\n- Control: The normalizer is $\\sqrt{I_{H,C} \\cdot I_{H_1,C}} = \\sqrt{[20\\cdot20, 19\\cdot19, 21\\cdot21]} = [20, 19, 21]$.\n  $N_{C} = [20/20, 19/19, 21/21] = [1, 1, 1]$. Mean($N_C$) = $1.0$.\n- Treatment: The normalizer is $\\sqrt{I_{H,T} \\cdot I_{H_1,T}} = \\sqrt{[10\\cdot20, 9\\cdot18, 10.5\\cdot21]} = \\sqrt{[200, 162, 220.5]}$.\n  $N_{T} = [16/\\sqrt{200}, 14.4/\\sqrt{162}, 16.8/\\sqrt{220.5}]$.\n  Let's simplify one term: $16/\\sqrt{200} = 16/(10\\sqrt{2}) = 1.6/\\sqrt{2} = 0.8\\sqrt{2}$. All terms simplify to $0.8\\sqrt{2}$.\n  Mean($N_T$) = $0.8\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.131$.\nThe apparent fold change is $FC_{app} = \\frac{0.8\\sqrt{2}}{1.0} = 0.8\\sqrt{2} \\neq 0.8$. The estimate is biased. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If one insists on using $H$, first rescaling each $H$ lane by the mean $H$ across all lanes and then dividing the target by this rescaled $H$ eliminates the inversion.**\n\nThe intensities of $H$ across all lanes are $[20, 19, 21, 10, 9, 10.5]$.\nThe mean is $\\bar{I}_{H,all} = (20+19+21+10+9+10.5)/6 = 89.5/6$.\nThe rescaled normalizer for a given lane $i$ is $I'_{H,i} = I_{H,i} / \\bar{I}_{H,all}$.\nThe new normalized target is $N'_{Tgt,i} = I_{Tgt,i} / I'_{H,i} = I_{Tgt,i} / (I_{H,i} / \\bar{I}_{H,all}) = (I_{Tgt,i} / I_{H,i}) \\times \\bar{I}_{H,all}$.\nThis procedure is equivalent to the original normalization to $H$ (from option A), followed by scaling every single normalized value by the same constant, $\\bar{I}_{H,all}$.\nMean($N'_C$) = Mean($N_C$) $\\times \\bar{I}_{H,all} = 1.0 \\times \\bar{I}_{H,all}$.\nMean($N'_T$) = Mean($N_T$) $\\times \\bar{I}_{H,all} = 1.6 \\times \\bar{I}_{H,all}$.\nThe new apparent fold change is $\\frac{1.6 \\times \\bar{I}_{H,all}}{1.0 \\times \\bar{I}_{H,all}} = 1.6$.\nThe result is unchanged. The inversion is not eliminated. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Under linear detection, for any reference $R$ used for normalization, the apparent fold change of the target after normalization equals $\\dfrac{t_{T}/t_{C}}{r_{T}/r_{C}}$; therefore, whenever $r_{T}/r_{C} < t_{T}/t_{C} < 1$, the normalized estimate exceeds $1$ and inverts the true decrease.**\n\nLet's derive the formula. The normalized value in any lane $i$ is $N_i = \\frac{I_{Tgt,i}}{I_{R,i}} = \\frac{t_i L_i}{r_i L_i} = \\frac{t_i}{r_i}$. The loading term $L_i$ cancels for each lane. Since $t$ and $r$ are constant within a condition, the normalized values are constant for all replicates of that condition.\n- Mean($N_C$) = $t_C / r_C$.\n- Mean($N_T$) = $t_T / r_T$.\n- $FC_{app} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(N_T)}{\\text{Mean}(N_C)} = \\frac{t_T / r_T}{t_C / r_C} = \\frac{t_T/t_C}{r_T/r_C}$. The formula is correct.\n\nNow, consider the condition $r_{T}/r_{C} < t_{T}/t_{C} < 1$.\nLet $FC_{true} = t_{T}/t_{C}$ and $FC_{ref} = r_{T}/r_{C}$. The condition is $FC_{ref} < FC_{true} < 1$.\nThe apparent fold change is $FC_{app} = FC_{true} / FC_{ref}$.\nSince $FC_{true}$ and $FC_{ref}$ are positive, and $FC_{ref} < FC_{true}$, it directly follows that their ratio $FC_{app} > 1$.\nThe true change is a decrease ($FC_{true} < 1$), while the apparent change is an increase ($FC_{app} > 1$). This constitutes an inversion. Both parts of the statement are logically sound and mathematically correct. The statement is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2754766"}]}
