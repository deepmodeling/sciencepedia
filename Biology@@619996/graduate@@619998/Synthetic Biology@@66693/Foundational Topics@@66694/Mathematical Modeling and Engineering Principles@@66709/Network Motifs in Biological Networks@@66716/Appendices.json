It is based on standard models of gene regulation in synthetic biology. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to analyze the behavior of the given regulatory functions in the limit of strong cooperativity, where the Hill coefficient $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor an activating regulator $R$, the fractional activation is given by:\n$$f_{\\text{act}}(R) = \\frac{R^{n}}{K^{n} + R^{n}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}$$\nIn the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n- If $R < K$, then $\\frac{R}{K} < 1$, and $\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n} \\to 0$.

To evaluate the limit, we divide the numerator and denominator by $\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}$, which gives $f_{\\text{act}}(R) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{K}{R}\\right)^{n} + 1}$. Since $\\frac{K}{R} < 1$, $\\left(\\frac{K}{R}\\right)^{n} \\to 0$, and thus $f_{\\text{act}}(R) \\to \\frac{1}{0+1} = 1$.\nThis function behaves as a Heaviside step function. Given the binary input definition $x=0$ for $X < K_X$ and $x=1$ for $X > K_X$, the limiting behavior of $f_{\\text{act}}(X)$ is exactly the binary variable $x$. The same applies to $f_{\\text{act}}(Y)$ and the binary variable $y$.\n\nFor a repressing regulator $R$, the fractional activity is:\n$$f_{\\text{rep}}(R) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}$$\nIn the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n- If $R < K$, then $\\frac{R}{K} < 1$, and $\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n} \\to 0$.

Thus, $f_{\\text{rep}}(R) \\to \\frac{1}{1+\\infty} = 0$.\nThis is an inverted step function. Given the binary definition for $y$, the limiting behavior of $f_{\\text{rep}}(Y)$ corresponds to the Boolean NOT operation on $y$, which is $1-y$.\n\nNow we analyze the two specified motifs.\n\n1. Coherent Type-1 Feed-Forward Loop (C1-FFL)\nIn this motif, transcription factor $X$ activates $Z$, and transcription factor $Y$ also activates $Z$. The promoter integration is multiplicative, so the fold-activation of gene $Z$ is proportional to the product of the individual activation functions:\n$$F_{Z} \\propto f_{\\text{act}}(X) f_{\\text{act}}(Y)$$\nIn the strong cooperativity limit, we substitute the step-function behaviors derived above. $f_{\\text{act}}(X)$ becomes the binary variable $x$, and $f_{\\text{act}}(Y)$ becomes the binary variable $y$.\n$$F_{Z} \\propto x y$$\nThe binary output $z_{\\text{C1}}$ is defined as $1$ if $F_{Z} > 0$ and $0$ if $F_{Z} = 0$. Since $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the product $xy$ is non-zero only if both $x=1$ and $y=1$. This corresponds to the Boolean logic function AND.\n$z_{\\text{C1}}(x,y) = x \\land y$\nThe truth table for this function is:\n- For $(x,y) = (0,0)$, $z_{\\text{C1}} = 0 \\land 0 = 0$.\n- For $(x,y) = (0,1)$, $z_{\\text{C1}} = 0 \\land 1 = 0$.\n- For $(x,y) = (1,0)$, $z_{\\text{C1}} = 1 \\land 0 = 0$.\n- For $(x,y) = (1,1)$, $z_{\\text{C1}} = 1 \\land 1 = 1$.\n\n2. Incoherent Type-1 Feed-Forward Loop (I1-FFL)\nIn this motif, $X$ activates $Z$, but $Y$ represses $Z$. The fold-activation is:\n$$F_{Z} \\propto f_{\\text{act}}(X) f_{\\text{rep}}(Y)$$\nIn the strong cooperativity limit, $f_{\\text{act}}(X)$ becomes $x$ and $f_{\\text{rep}}(Y)$ becomes $1-y$.\n$$F_{Z} \\propto x (1-y)$$\nThe output $z_{\\text{I1}}$ is $1$ if $F_{Z} > 0$. The product $x(1-y)$ is non-zero only if $x=1$ and $1-y=1$, which means $y=0$. This corresponds to the Boolean logic function $x$ AND NOT $y$.\n$z_{\\text{I1}}(x,y) = x \\land (\\neg y)$\nThe truth table for this function is:\n- For $(x,y) = (0,0)$, $z_{\\text{I1}} = 0 \\land (\\neg 0) = 0 \\land 1 = 0$.\n- For $(x,y) = (0,1)$, $z_{\\text{I1}} = 0 \\land (\\neg 1) = 0 \\land 0 = 0$.\n- For $(x,y) = (1,0)$, $z_{\\text{I1}} = 1 \\land (\\neg 0) = 1 \\land 1 = 1$.\n- For $(x,y) = (1,1)$, $z_{\\text{I1}} = 1 \\land (\\neg 1) = 1 \\land 0 = 0$.\n\n3. Hamming Distance\nThe Hamming distance $d$ between the two truth tables is the number of input pairs $(x,y)$ for which the output values $z_{\\text{C1}}(x,y)$ and $z_{\\text{I1}}(x,y)$ are different. We compare the two output columns.\n\n| Input $(x,y)$ | Output $z_{\\text{C1}}(x,y)$ | Output $z_{\\text{I1}}(x,y)$ | Mismatch ($z_{\\text{C1}} \\neq z_{\\text{I1}}$) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| $(0,0)$ | $0$ | $0$ | No |\n| $(0,1)$ | $0$ | $0$ | No |\n| $(1,0)$ | $0$ | $1$ | Yes |\n| $(1,1)$ | $1$ | $0$ | Yes |\n\nThere are two input pairs, $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$, for which the outputs are different.

The provided assumptions, while idealizations, are common in the analysis of such systems and are internally consistent.

These simplify the system analysis significantly.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that a pulse is generated. A pulse requires an initial rise followed by a fall to a steady state.\nAt $t=0$, we have $y(0)=0$ and $z(0)=0$. From equation ($2$), the initial rate of change of $z$ is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dz}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_{z}\\,H_{r}\\!\\left(y(0);K,n\\right) - \\gamma_{z}\\,z(0) = k_{z}\\,H_{r}\\!\\left(0;K,n\\right) - 0 = k_{z} \\cdot \\frac{K^n}{K^n+0^n} = k_z\n$$\nSince $k_z$ is a positive rate constant, $\\frac{dz}{dt}|_{t=0} > 0$. This proves that $z(t)$ must initially increase from $z(0)=0$.\nConcurrently, $y(t)$ increases from $y(0)=0$ according to equation ($1$). As $y(t)$ increases, the repression term $H_r(y)$ decreases, which in turn lowers the production rate of $Z$. This slowing production, combined with degradation of $Z$, will cause $z(t)$ to eventually decrease, provided the final steady-state is lower than the peak.\nThis sequence of a fast-rising signal followed by a slower decay constitutes a transient pulse.\n\nNext, we derive the amplitude of this pulse. The pulse amplitude is defined as $z_{max} - z_{final}$. We must find the maximum concentration $z_{max}$ and the final steady-state concentration $z_{final}$.\n\nThe core assumption for finding $z_{max}$ is that of timescale separation: the dynamics of $z$ are much faster than those of $y$, as indicated by $\\gamma_z \\gg \\gamma_y$. This allows us to use an adiabatic or quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation for $z$. This approximation asserts that $z(t)$ rapidly converges to and tracks the value that would make its time derivative zero, given the current value of the slower variable $y(t)$.\nThis approximation breaks down at $t=0$, where $z(0)=0$ but the QSS value is non-zero. The physical interpretation is that a rapid transient occurs on the fast timescale $\\sim 1/\\gamma_z$, during which $z$ rises from $0$ to approach the QSS value corresponding to the initial state of the slow variable, $y(0)=0$. After this initial boundary layer, $z(t)$ tracks the QSS value as $y(t)$ evolves on the slow timescale $\\sim 1/\\gamma_y$.\n\nThe maximum value of $z$, denoted $z_{max}$, is reached at the end of this initial fast phase. At this point, $y$ has had negligible time to change, so we can approximate $y \\approx y(0) = 0$. The QSS value for $z$ is found by setting $\\frac{dz}{dt}=0$ in equation ($2$):\n$$\n0 \\approx k_{z}\\,H_{r}\\!\\left(y;K,n\\right) \\;-\\; \\gamma_{z}\\,z_{qss} \\implies z_{qss}(y) = \\frac{k_z}{\\gamma_z} H_{r}\\!\\left(y;K,n\\right)\n$$\nUsing the nondimensionalization $k_z/\\gamma_z=1$:\n$$\nz_{qss}(y) = H_{r}\\!\\left(y;K,n\\right)\n$$\nThe peak value $z_{max}$ is the QSS value at $y=0$:\n$$\nz_{max} = z_{qss}(0) = H_{r}\\!\\left(0;K,n\\right) = \\frac{K^n}{K^n+0^n} = 1\n$$\nThis establishes the peak of the pulse.\n\nNow, we determine the final steady-state value, $z_{final}$. As $t \\to \\infty$, the system settles into a new steady state where $\\frac{dy}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dz}{dt}=0$.\nFirst, we find the steady state of $y$, denoted $y_{ss}$, from equation ($1$):\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_y - \\gamma_y y = 0 \\implies y_{ss} = \\frac{k_y}{\\gamma_y}\n$$\nUsing the nondimensionalization $k_y/\\gamma_y=1$, we get $y_{ss}=1$.\nNext, we find the corresponding steady state for $z$, denoted $z_{final}$, by using $y=y_{ss}=1$ in the QSS equation for $z$:\n$$\nz_{final} = z_{qss}(y_{ss}) = z_{qss}(1) = H_r(1;K,n) = \\frac{K^n}{K^n+1^n} = \\frac{K^n}{K^n+1}\n$$\nFinally, the pulse amplitude is the difference between $z_{max}$ and $z_{final}$:\n$$\n\\text{Pulse Amplitude} = z_{max} - z_{final} = 1 - \\frac{K^n}{K^n+1}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Pulse Amplitude} = \\frac{(K^n+1) - K^n}{K^n+1} = \\frac{1}{K^n+1}\n$$\nThis closed-form expression for the pulse amplitude depends only on the Hill coefficient $n$ and the repression threshold $K$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{K^{n}+1}}$$", "id": "2753926"}, {"introduction": "Ideal models provide crucial insights, but real-world circuit design requires grappling with biophysical imperfections.

First, we compute the value of $n_{\\min}$ using these parameters.\nThe numerator is:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{q - \\ell}{1 - q}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.15 - 0.03}{1 - 0.15}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.12}{0.85}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{85}\\right)$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{Y_{\\max}}{K} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_p}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(3 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5}{30}\\right)\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(3 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\right)\\right)$$\nNumerically evaluating these expressions:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{85}\\right) \\approx \\ln(0.141176) \\approx -1.95786$$\n$$3 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\right) \\approx 3 \\left(1 - 0.84648\\right) = 3(0.15352) = 0.46056$$\n$$\\ln(0.46056) \\approx -0.77530$$\nThus, the minimum required Hill coefficient is:\n$$n_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{-1.95786}{-0.77530} \\approx 2.5253$$\nThe engineered circuit has an effective Hill coefficient $n_{\\text{eff}} = m\\,n_{0}$, with $n_0 = 2$. To satisfy the performance requirement, we must have $n_{\\text{eff}} \\ge n_{\\min}$.\n$$m\\,n_{0} \\ge n_{\\min}$$\n$$m \\ge \\frac{n_{\\min}}{n_{0}} \\approx \\frac{2.5253}{2} \\approx 1.26265$$\nSince $m$ represents the number of binding sites, it must be an integer. The minimal integer value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $1.26265$, which is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2753880"}]}
