It describes a canonical model of stochastic plasmid partitioning, a fundamental topic in microbiology and synthetic biology. The assumptions—a fixed initial copy number $n$, independent segregation, and a probability $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ for symmetric division—are standard for building a baseline model. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided and no contradictions. The request is for a mathematical derivation based on first principles of probability theory, which is a rigorous and appropriate task.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nLet us consider the fate of a single plasmid molecule. The problem states that the probability of this plasmid segregating into the focal daughter cell is $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. Consequently, the probability of this same plasmid molecule *not* segregating into the focal daughter cell (and thus segregating into the other daughter cell) is $1 - p$.\n$$ P(\\text{single plasmid does not enter focal cell}) = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nLet this event be denoted by $E_i$ for the $i$-th plasmid, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$. The probability of this event for any plasmid is constant:\n$$ P(E_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} $$\nThe event that the focal daughter cell receives zero plasmid molecules, whose probability is $P_0$, is the composite event where the first plasmid does not enter the focal cell, AND the second plasmid does not enter the focal cell, ..., AND the $n$-th plasmid does not enter the focal cell. In set-theoretic terms, this is the intersection of all events $E_i$:\n$$ P_0 = P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap \\ldots \\cap E_n) $$\nThe problem explicitly states that the segregation events for the $n$ plasmid molecules are independent. The multiplication rule for independent events states that the probability of the intersection of a set of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. Applying this rule, we have:\n$$ P_0 = P(E_1) \\times P(E_2) \\times \\ldots \\times P(E_n) $$\nSubstituting the probability $P(E_i) = \\frac{1}{2}$ for each of the $n$ terms in the product yields:\n$$ P_0 = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\ldots \\times \\frac{1}{2}}_{n \\text{ times}} $$\nThis product simplifies to the $n$-th power of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$ P_0(n) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n} $$\nThis expression represents the zero-copy loss probability for a daughter cell as a function of the initial plasmid copy number $n$ under the assumption of random binomial partitioning.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, self-contained, and describes a standard, albeit simplified, model for plasmid copy number control in synthetic biology. All required information is provided and the objectives are clear. We shall now proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to construct a dynamical equation for the average plasmid copy number per cell, $n(t)$, based on a mass-balance principle. The principle states that the rate of change of $n(t)$ is the sum of the rate of plasmid replication and the rate of loss due to dilution from cell growth. This is expressed as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = (\\text{rate of replication}) - (\\text{rate of dilution})\n$$\nLet's define the terms. The system is a population of cells growing exponentially with a specific growth rate $\\mu > 0$.\n\n1.  **Rate of Replication:** The problem states that the replication initiation rate per cell is governed by a linear negative feedback law, given by the function $k_{i}(n) = \\alpha - \\beta n$, where $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$. This term represents the production of new plasmids.\n\n2.  **Rate of Dilution:** In a culture of cells growing exponentially, the concentration or average copy number of any stable intracellular component is diluted. For a quantity $n$ per cell, the rate of loss due to this dilution effect is proportional to both the quantity $n$ and the specific growth rate $\\mu$. The rate of dilution is therefore given by the term $\\mu n$.\n\nCombining these terms, we formulate the one-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the average plasmid copy number $n(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = k_{i}(n) - \\mu n\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $k_{i}(n)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = (\\alpha - \\beta n) - \\mu n\n$$\nThis can be simplified by grouping the terms dependent on $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\alpha - (\\beta + \\mu)n\n$$\nThis is the required one-dimensional dynamical equation for $n(t)$.\n\nNext, we must find the steady-state copy number, which we denote as $n^{*}$. The steady state is the condition where the copy number no longer changes over time, i.e., $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting the derivative to zero, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha - (\\beta + \\mu)n^{*}\n$$\nWe solve this linear algebraic equation for $n^{*}$:\n$$\n(\\beta + \\mu)n^{*} = \\alpha\n$$\n$$\nn^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta + \\mu}\n$$\nGiven the constraints $\\alpha > 0$, $\\beta > 0$, and $\\mu > 0$, the steady-state copy number $n^{*}$ is guaranteed to be positive, which is a physically meaningful result.\n\nFinally, we must determine the linearized eigenvalue of the system at the steady state $n^{*}$. For a one-dimensional system $\\frac{dn}{dt} = f(n)$, the eigenvalue of the linearization at a fixed point $n^{*}$ is given by the Jacobian evaluated at that point. In one dimension, the Jacobian is simply the first derivative of the function $f(n)$ with respect to $n$.\nLet our function be $f(n) = \\alpha - (\\beta + \\mu)n$.\nThe Jacobian, $J(n)$, is:\n$$\nJ(n) = \\frac{df}{dn} = \\frac{d}{dn} \\left( \\alpha - (\\beta + \\mu)n \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\nJ(n) = -(\\beta + \\mu)\n$$\nThe eigenvalue of the system linearized at the steady state $n^{*}$, denoted $\\lambda_{\\text{lin}}$, is the value of the Jacobian at $n=n^{*}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{lin}} = J(n^{*}) = -(\\beta + \\mu)\n$$\nWe note that because the original ODE is linear in $n$, the Jacobian is a constant and its value is independent of the steady-state point $n^{*}$. Since $\\beta > 0$ and $\\mu > 0$, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\text{lin}}$ is strictly negative. This indicates that the steady state $n^{*}$ is locally asymptotically stable.\n\nThe problem asks for the results to be reported as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} n^{*} & \\lambda_{\\text{lin}} \\end{pmatrix}$.
