By comparing these to the architecture of a hypothetical prokaryotic equivalent, you will gain a practical appreciation for the challenges and modifications required when transferring genetic information between these two domains of life [@problem_id:2764248].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is analyzing a eukaryotic gene to design an equivalent prokaryotic expression construct. The eukaryotic gene occupies a total genomic span of $4\\,\\text{kb}$ and contains $3$ exons of lengths $150\\,\\text{bp}$, $1200\\,\\text{bp}$, and $300\\,\\text{bp}$, separated by $2$ introns of lengths $900\\,\\text{bp}$ and $1450\\,\\text{bp}$. Assume the following: (i) transcription initiates upstream of the first exon and terminates downstream of the last exon such that the primary transcript (precursor messenger ribonucleic acid, pre-mRNA) contains all exons and introns given; (ii) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) maturation in the eukaryote removes introns completely by spliceosomal splicing with no intron retention; (iii) ignore $5^{\\prime}$ capping, $3^{\\prime}$ polyadenylation, and untranslated region (UTR) contributions beyond the given exon lengths; and (iv) in the prokaryotic design, the same coding region is encoded as a single continuous unit with no introns, and transcription yields an mRNA that is colinear with that coding region, with no additional untranslated leaders or trailers.\n\nUsing only foundational principles of the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the definition of exons and introns, and the well-established absence of spliceosomal introns in canonical prokaryotic genes, derive expressions for the lengths of the eukaryotic pre-mRNA, the eukaryotic mature mRNA, and the corresponding prokaryotic mRNA in terms of the exon and intron lengths.

It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of molecular biology, specifically the Central Dogma and the structural distinctions between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. The givens are self-contained, consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle being tested is the process of gene expression. In eukaryotes, the transcription of a gene from its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template results in a precursor messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA). This pre-mRNA molecule is a direct transcript of the gene's sequence, which includes both coding regions, known as exons, and non-coding intervening sequences, known as introns. Through a process called splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined together to form a mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In contrast, canonical prokaryotic genes are not interrupted by spliceosomal introns, and the transcribed mRNA is colinear with the coding DNA sequence. The problem requires us to calculate the lengths of the intermediate and final RNA products based on these principles.\n\nLet $N_E$ be the number of exons and $N_I$ be the number of introns. Let $L_{E_i}$ be the length of the $i$-th exon and $L_{I_j}$ be the length of the $j$-th intron, for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_E\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_I\\}$. The lengths are provided in base pairs (bp), which for the purpose of single-stranded RNA length correspond directly to nucleotides (nt).\n\nThe givens are:\n$N_E = 3$\n$L_{E_1} = 150\\,\\text{nt}$\n$L_{E_2} = 1200\\,\\text{nt}$\n$L_{E_3} = 300\\,\\text{nt}$\n$N_I = 2$\n$L_{I_1} = 900\\,\\text{nt}$\n$L_{I_2} = 1450\\,\\text{nt}$\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the length of the eukaryotic pre-mRNA, denoted $L_{\\text{pre-mRNA}}$. According to assumption (i), the pre-mRNA is the primary transcript containing all exons and introns. Its length is therefore the sum of the lengths of all individual exons and introns.\n$$L_{\\text{pre-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} L_{E_i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_I} L_{I_j}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the length of the eukaryotic mature mRNA, denoted $L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}}$. According to assumption (ii), the mature mRNA is produced by splicing, which removes all introns. Assumption (iii) instructs us to ignore other features like the $5'$ cap and $3'$ poly(A) tail. Thus, the length of the mature mRNA is simply the sum of the lengths of all exons.\n$$L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} L_{E_i}$$\n\nThird, we derive the expression for the length of the corresponding prokaryotic mRNA, denoted $L_{\\text{prok-mRNA}}$. The problem specifies a synthetic prokaryotic construct designed to express the same protein. This implies that the coding sequence of the prokaryotic gene must be identical to the coding sequence of the spliced eukaryotic mRNA. In prokaryotes, transcription is colinear. Assumption (iv) states that we ignore untranslated leader and trailer sequences. Therefore, the length of the prokaryotic mRNA must be equal to the total length of the exons from the original eukaryotic gene.\n$$L_{\\text{prok-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} L_{E_i} = L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}}$$\n\nNow we perform the calculations using the provided values.\nThe total length of the exons is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i} = L_{E_1} + L_{E_2} + L_{E_3} = 150 + 1200 + 300 = 1650\\,\\text{nt}$$\nThe total length of the introns is:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{2} L_{I_j} = L_{I_1} + L_{I_2} = 900 + 1450 = 2350\\,\\text{nt}$$\n\nUsing these sums, we evaluate the length of each RNA molecule.\n\nLength of the eukaryotic pre-mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{pre-mRNA}} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i}\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{2} L_{I_j}\\right) = 1650 + 2350 = 4000\\,\\text{nt}$$\nThis result is consistent with the provided total genomic span of $4\\,\\text{kb}$, which is $4000\\,\\text{bp}$.\n\nLength of the eukaryotic mature mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i} = 1650\\,\\text{nt}$$\n\nLength of the prokaryotic mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{prok-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i} = 1650\\,\\text{nt}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a single row matrix containing the three calculated lengths in the order: eukaryotic pre-mRNA length, eukaryotic mature mRNA length, and prokaryotic mRNA length.

We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive an expression for the total binding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$, and second, we compute the change in transcription initiation rate resulting from a destabilizing mutation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Total Binding Free Energy**\n\nThe problem states that the binding free energy of RNA polymerase to the promoter, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$, is the result of additive and independent contributions from the $-35$ element, the $-10$ element, and the upstream promoter (UP) element. Let us denote the individual free energy contributions from these elements as $\\Delta G_{-35}$, $\\Delta G_{-10}$, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{UP}}$, respectively. The assumption of additivity means that the total binding free energy is the simple algebraic sum of these individual contributions. This assumption neglects any cooperative or anti-cooperative interactions between the binding of RNA polymerase to these distinct DNA sites.\n\nTherefore, the expression for the total binding free energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta G_{-35} + \\Delta G_{-10} + \\Delta G_{\\text{UP}}\n$$\n\nThis equation formally expresses the principle of independent binding contacts outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Initiation Rate**\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the transcription initiation rate, $k$, and the binding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$, as a proportionality:\n$$\nk \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Let the proportionality constant be $A$. Then, for any promoter, the rate is given by $k = A \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} / (RT))$.\n\nWe are considering two promoters: a wild type (WT) and a mutant (mut). The rate for the wild type promoter, $k_{\\text{WT}}$, is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{WT}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}}$ is the total binding free energy for the wild type promoter.\n\nThe mutant promoter has a single base substitution in the $-10$ element which increases the total binding free energy by an amount $\\Delta \\Delta G = +1.2 \\text{ kcal/mol}$. The contributions from the $-35$ and UP elements are unchanged. The binding free energy for the mutant promoter, $\\Delta G_{\\text{mut}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{WT}} + \\Delta \\Delta G\n$$\nA positive value for $\\Delta \\Delta G$ signifies that binding is less favorable (weaker) for the mutant. The rate for the mutant promoter, $k_{\\text{mut}}$, is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{mut}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{mut}}}{RT}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}} + \\Delta \\Delta G}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the multiplicative factor $f = k_{\\text{mut}}/k_{\\text{WT}}$. We form the ratio of the two rates:\n$$\nf = \\frac{k_{\\text{mut}}}{k_{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}} + \\Delta \\Delta G}{RT}\\right)}{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}}}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant $A$ cancels.

This exercise explores the mechanism of alternative polyadenylation, where the cell can produce different mRNA isoforms from a single gene by choosing different cleavage sites. You will calculate the direct impact of this choice on mRNA length and then reason about how this structural change can alter the mRNA's susceptibility to regulation by microRNAs, a key mechanism for fine-tuning protein output [@problem_id:2764190].", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is engineering a eukaryotic expression cassette to modulate post-transcriptional control via alternative polyadenylation. In eukaryotes, cleavage and polyadenylation establish the mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) $3'$ end, and the $3'$ untranslated region (UTR) spans from the stop codon to the cleavage site. Assume that introns are fully spliced, the poly(A) tail is not included in the reported mRNA length, and nothing upstream of the stop codon changes between constructs. The team observes that one construct cleaves at a distal site located at $+1500$ nucleotides (nt) downstream of the stop codon, whereas an alternative construct cleaves at a proximal site at $+600$ nt.\n\nStarting from core definitions of eukaryotic gene structure (transcription yields a precursor mRNA that is spliced and then cleaved and polyadenylated; the mature mRNA length upstream of the poly(A) tail equals the $5'$ UTR plus the coding sequence plus the $3'$ UTR), derive an expression for the change in mature mRNA length caused solely by shifting the cleavage site from the distal to the proximal position. Define the signed change as $\\Delta L = L_{\\text{prox}} - L_{\\text{dist}}$, where $L_{\\text{prox}}$ and $L_{\\text{dist}}$ are the mature mRNA lengths (excluding the poly(A) tail) for the proximal and distal cleavage sites, respectively.\n\nCompute the numerical value of $\\Delta L$. Express your final numerical answer in nucleotides. Do not include units in the final boxed answer. No rounding is required.\n\nThen, based on core principles of microRNA (miRNA) targeting in eukaryotes, briefly explain how such a shortening of the $3'$ UTR could alter miRNA-mediated regulation, making explicit any assumptions you use about the distribution of binding sites. Your explanation will not be graded for calculation, but it must be consistent with the derivation you performed.", "solution": "The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA, excluding the poly(A) tail, is defined by the contiguous sequence of the $5'$ untranslated region ($5'$ UTR), the coding sequence (CDS), and the $3'$ untranslated region ($3'$ UTR).

Therefore, the length of the $3'$ UTR, $L_{3'\\text{UTR}}$, is numerically equivalent to the distance of the cleavage site from the stop codon.\n\nFor the construct with the distal cleavage site, the site is located at $+1500$ nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. Thus, the length of its $3'$ UTR is:\n$$L_{3'\\text{UTR, dist}} = 1500 \\text{ nt}$$\nThe total length of the mature mRNA for this construct, $L_{\\text{dist}}$, is:\n$$L_{\\text{dist}} = L_{5'\\text{UTR}} + L_{\\text{CDS}} + L_{3'\\text{UTR, dist}}$$\n\nFor the construct with the proximal cleavage site, the site is located at $+600$ nucleotides downstream of the stop codon.

This means that the length of the $5'$ UTR ($L_{5'\\text{UTR}}$) and the length of the CDS ($L_{\\text{CDS}}$) are constant for both the distal and proximal variants.\n\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the change in mature mRNA length, $\\Delta L$, defined as $\\Delta L = L_{\\text{prox}} - L_{\\text{dist}}$.

MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. They achieve this by binding, typically with imperfect complementarity, to target sequences known as miRNA response elements (MREs). In animals, these MREs are predominantly located within the $3'$ UTR of target mRNAs. Binding of a miRNA-protein complex (the RNA-induced silencing complex, or RISC) to an MRE leads to either translational repression or mRNA degradation, thereby downregulating protein production.\n\nThe calculated change $\\Delta L = -900$ nt signifies that the switch to the proximal polyadenylation site excises a $900$ nucleotide segment from the $3'$ UTR.\n\nTo explain the regulatory consequences, we must make an explicit assumption: MREs for relevant miRNAs can be distributed throughout the entire length of the longer, $1500$ nt $3'$ UTR.\n\nUnder this assumption, the shortening of the $3'$ UTR by $900$ nt is highly likely to remove MREs located within the excised distal segment (i.e., the region between $+600$ nt and $+1500$ nt). The loss of these binding sites would abrogate the repressive action of the corresponding miRNAs. Consequently, the mRNA isoform with the shorter $3'$ UTR would escape this layer of miRNA-mediated downregulation, leading to increased stability and/or translational efficiency. The ultimate result would be an increase in the synthesis of the encoded protein from the transcript with the proximal polyadenylation site compared to the transcript with the distal site. This mechanism, where alternative polyadenylation alters the repertoire of MREs, is a known biological strategy for modulating protein expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-900}$$", "id": "2764190"}]}
