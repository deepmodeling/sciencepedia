The $D$ allele is recoded at the target site so that it is not recognized and not cut by the nuclease it expresses. Consider a diploid germline cell that is heterozygous $D/W$ at this locus. Assume the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base for your reasoning: (i) under Mendelian segregation, each homologous chromosome is transmitted to a gamete with probability $1/2$, and (ii) CRISPR-induced double-strand breaks at the $W$ allele, when they occur prior to meiosis, are repaired either by Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) using the $D$ allele as a template or by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), which generates a mutation at the target site that is resistant to further cutting; call such an allele $R$.\n\nModel the process as follows.

It is a valid exercise in applying fundamental probability theory to a model from synthetic biology. Therefore, I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe derivation of the gamete genotype distribution from a heterozygous $D/W$ individual is as follows. We must calculate the total probability for a gamete to inherit each of the three possible alleles: $D$, $R$, or $W$. This requires application of the law of total probability, considering the two possible chromosomal origins for the gamete.\n\nLet $C_D$ be the event that a gamete inherits the chromosome that initially carried the $D$ allele.\nLet $C_W$ be the event that a gamete inherits the chromosome that initially carried the $W$ allele.\n\nAccording to Mendelian segregation, the probabilities of these events are:\n$$P(C_D) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(C_W) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe problem states that the $D$ allele on its original chromosome is stable. Thus, if a gamete inherits this chromosome (event $C_D$), the allele will be $D$. The conditional probabilities are:\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } D \\mid C_D) = 1$$\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } R \\mid C_D) = 0$$\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } W \\mid C_D) = 0$$\n\nNow, we must consider the outcome when a gamete inherits the chromosome that initially carried the $W$ allele (event $C_W$). The $W$ allele can be converted to $D$ or $R$, or it can remain as $W$. The probabilities for the final state of this allele are given by the sequence of events described in the problem.\n- The allele on the $C_W$ chromosome becomes $D$ if and only if a break occurs (probability $c$) and is repaired by HDR (probability $h$). The probability of this joint event is the product of the probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } D \\mid C_W) = c \\times h = ch$$\n- The allele on the $C_W$ chromosome becomes $R$ if and only if a break occurs (probability $c$) and is repaired by NHEJ (probability $n$). The probability of this joint event is:\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } R \\mid C_W) = c \\times n = cn$$\n- The allele on the $C_W$ chromosome remains $W$ if and only if no break occurs (probability $1-c$):\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } W \\mid C_W) = 1-c$$\nNote that these three outcomes for the $C_W$ chromosome are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: $ch + cn + (1-c) = c(h+n) + 1-c = c(1) + 1-c = 1$.\n\nWe can now find the total probability for each gamete genotype using the law of total probability: $P(G) = P(G \\mid C_D)P(C_D) + P(G \\mid C_W)P(C_W)$, where $G$ is the gamete genotype.\n\n1.  Probability of a $D$ gamete, $P(D)$:\n$$P(D) = P(\\text{gamete is } D \\mid C_D)P(C_D) + P(\\text{gamete is } D \\mid C_W)P(C_W)$$\n$$P(D) = (1) \\times \\frac{1}{2} + (ch) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1+ch}{2}$$\n\n2.

It presents a standard model in theoretical population genetics for a homing-based gene drive. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the critical conversion probability $c^{\\ast}$ that allows the drive allele $D$ to increase in frequency when it is rare. This is a problem of local stability analysis around the fixed point where the frequency of $D$, denoted by $p_t$, is zero. The allele $D$ invades the population if and only if the trivial equilibrium $p_t = 0$ is unstable.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of the drive allele $D$ and $1-p_t$ be the frequency of the wild-type allele $W$ among adults in generation $t$. Assuming a large, panmictic population, the genotype frequencies at the start of the life cycle (adults of generation $t$) are given by Hardy-Weinberg proportions:\n- Frequency of $WW$ adults: $(1-p_t)^2$\n- Frequency of $WD$ adults: $2p_t(1-p_t)$\n- Frequency of $DD$ adults: $p_t^2$\n\nThe first step is to determine the frequency of the $D$ allele in the gamete pool produced by these adults.\n- $DD$ adults produce only $D$ gametes.\n- $WW$ adults produce only $W$ gametes.\n- In heterozygous $WD$ adults, the drive mechanism acts. With probability $c$, the $W$ allele is converted to $D$, and the individual produces $100\\%$ $D$ gametes. With probability $1-c$, standard Mendelian segregation occurs, and the individual produces $50\\%$ $D$ gametes and $50\\%$ $W$ gametes.\nTherefore, the average proportion of $D$ gametes produced by a $WD$ heterozygote is $c \\cdot 1 + (1-c) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1+c}{2}$.\n\nThe frequency of the $D$ allele in the gamete pool, which we denote as $p'$, is the sum of contributions from each genotype, weighted by their frequencies:\n$$p' = (p_t^2) \\cdot (1) + (2p_t(1-p_t)) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1+c}{2}\\right) + ((1-p_t)^2) \\cdot (0)$$\n$$p' = p_t^2 + p_t(1-p_t)(1+c)$$\n$$p' = p_t^2 + p_t(1+c) - p_t^2(1+c)$$\n$$p' = p_t + c p_t - c p_t^2 = p_t + c p_t (1-p_t)$$\nThis equation gives the allele frequency after the drive mechanism but before selection.\n\nNext, zygotes for generation $t+1$ are formed by the random union of these gametes. The genotype frequencies in zygotes are again given by Hardy-Weinberg proportions, based on the gamete frequency $p'$:\n- Frequency of $WW$ zygotes: $(1-p')^2$\n- Frequency of $WD$ zygotes: $2p'(1-p')$\n- Frequency of $DD$ zygotes: $(p')^2$\n\nThese zygotes are subject to viability selection with fitnesses $w_{WW}=1$, $w_{WD}=1-hs$, and $w_{DD}=1-s$. The frequencies of genotypes among adults of generation $t+1$ are proportional to their zygotic frequencies multiplied by their respective fitnesses.\nThe mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the sum of these weighted frequencies:\n$$\\bar{w} = (1-p')^2 w_{WW} + 2p'(1-p') w_{WD} + (p')^2 w_{DD}$$\n$$\\bar{w} = (1-p')^2 + 2p'(1-p')(1-hs) + (p')^2(1-s)$$\n\nThe frequency of the $D$ allele among adults in generation $t+1$, denoted $p_{t+1}$, is calculated from the post-selection genotype frequencies. The number of $D$ alleles is proportional to $2 \\times (\\text{freq } DD) + 1 \\times (\\text{freq } WD)$. The total number of alleles is proportional to $2 \\times \\bar{w}$.\n$$p_{t+1} = \\frac{(p')^2(1-s) + p'(1-p')(1-hs)}{\\bar{w}}$$\n$$p_{t+1} = \\frac{p'(p'(1-s) + (1-p')(1-hs))}{\\bar{w}}$$\n$$p_{t+1} = \\frac{p'(1-hs + p'(hs-s))}{\\bar{w}}$$\nThis is the full recurrence relation for the allele frequency.\n\nTo find the condition for the drive to increase when rare, we analyze the stability of the equilibrium $p_t=0$. The drive invades if the Jacobian of the map $p_t \\mapsto p_{t+1}$, evaluated at $p_t=0$, is greater than $1$. This Jacobian is the eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\left. \\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp_t} \\right|_{p_t=0}$.\n\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp_t} = \\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp'} \\frac{dp'}{dp_t}$. We evaluate this at $p_t=0$.\nFirst, we find $\\frac{dp'}{dp_t}$:\n$$p' = p_t + cp_t - cp_t^2$$\n$$\\frac{dp'}{dp_t} = 1+c-2cp_t$$\nAt $p_t=0$, we have $\\left. \\frac{dp'}{dp_t} \\right|_{p_t=0} = 1+c$. Also note that at $p_t=0$, $p'=0$.\n\nNext, we find $\\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp'}$. Let $N(p') = p'(1-hs + p'(hs-s))$ and $D(p')=\\bar{w}$. Then $p_{t+1} = \\frac{N(p')}{D(p')}$.\nBy the quotient rule, $\\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp'} = \\frac{N'(p')D(p') - N(p')D'(p')}{[D(p')]^2}$.\nWe evaluate this at $p'=0$ (since $p_t=0 \\implies p'=0$).\nAt $p'=0$:\n$N(0) = 0$.\n$D(0) = (1-0)^2 + 2(0)(1)(1-hs) + (0)^2(1-s) = 1$.\nThe expression for the derivative simplifies to $\\left. \\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp'} \\right|_{p'=0} = \\frac{N'(0)D(0) - N(0)D'(0)}{[D(0)]^2} = \\frac{N'(0) \\cdot 1 - 0}{1^2} = N'(0)$.\n\nWe compute $N'(p')$:\n$N'(p') = \\frac{d}{dp'}\\left[ p'(1-hs) + (p')^2(hs-s) \\right] = (1-hs) + 2p'(hs-s)$.\nAt $p'=0$, $N'(0) = 1-hs$.\nThus, $\\left. \\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp'} \\right|_{p'=0} = 1-hs$.\n\nCombining these results, the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is:\n$$\\lambda = \\left. \\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp_t} \\right|_{p_t=0} = \\left( \\left. \\frac{dp_{t+1}}{dp'} \\right|_{p'=0} \\right) \\left( \\left. \\frac{dp'}{dp_t} \\right|_{p_t=0} \\right) = (1-hs)(1+c)$$\n\nThe allele $D$ increases in frequency when rare if and only if $\\lambda > 1$.\n$$(1-hs)(1+c) > 1$$\nGiven that $h \\in [0,1]$ and $s \\in [0,1)$, we have $hs < 1$, which means $1-hs$ is a positive quantity. We can therefore divide by it without changing the inequality's direction.\n$$1+c > \\frac{1}{1-hs}$$\n$$c > \\frac{1}{1-hs} - 1$$\n$$c > \\frac{1 - (1-hs)}{1-hs}$$\n$$c > \\frac{hs}{1-hs}$$\nThis inequality defines the condition for the drive to invade. The critical conversion probability, $c^{\\ast}$, is the threshold value at which this condition becomes an equality.\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{hs}{1-hs}$$\nThus, the drive allele will increase in frequency when rare if and only if its conversion probability $c$ exceeds this critical value $c^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{hs}{1 - hs}}$$", "id": "2749889"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models of invasion provide critical insights, but designing and deploying gene drives responsibly requires assessing their behavior over time and under uncertainty.

The mean fitness of the population, $\\overline{w}_t$, normalizes these frequencies:\n$$ \\overline{w}_t = f_{DD} w_{DD} + f_{DW} w_{DW} + f_{WW} w_{WW} = x_t^2 (1-s) + 2 x_t (1 - x_t) (1-hs) + (1 - x_t)^2 $$\nThe post-selection genotype frequencies are therefore:\n-   $p_{DD} = \\frac{x_t^2 (1-s)}{\\overline{w}_t}$\n-   $p_{DW} = \\frac{2 x_t (1 - x_t) (1-hs)}{\\overline{w}_t}$\n-   $p_{WW} = \\frac{(1 - x_t)^2}{\\overline{w}_t}$\n\n**Stage 2: Gametogenesis and Homing**\nDuring gamete formation, individuals produce haploid gametes. The transmission of the $D$ allele is biased in heterozygotes due to the homing mechanism.\n-   A $DD$ individual produces only $D$ gametes. The proportion of $D$ is $1$.\n-   A $WW$ individual produces only $W$ gametes. The proportion of $D$ is $0$.\n-   A $DW$ heterozygote undergoes homing with a time-dependent probability $c_t$. The expected fraction of $D$ gametes from a $DW$ individual is $\\frac{1+c_t}{2}$.\n\n**The Recurrence Relation**\nThe allele frequency in the next generation, $x_{t+1}$, is the sum of the contributions from each post-selection genotype class, weighted by their frequencies:\n$$ x_{t+1} = p_{DD} \\cdot 1 + p_{DW} \\cdot \\frac{1+c_t}{2} + p_{WW} \\cdot 0 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{DD}$ and $p_{DW}$ yields the complete update equation:\n$$ x_{t+1} = \\frac{x_t^2 (1-s) + 2 x_t (1 - x_t) (1-hs) \\left( \\frac{1+c_t}{2} \\right)}{\\overline{w}_t} $$\n$$ x_{t+1} = \\frac{x_t^2 (1-s) + x_t (1 - x_t) (1-hs) (1+c_t)}{x_t^2 (1-s) + 2 x_t (1 - x_t) (1-hs) + (1 - x_t)^2} $$\nThis equation is the core of the simulation. A numerical clipping mechanism will be applied at each step, ensuring $x_t \\in [10^{-12}, 1 - 10^{-12}]$, to prevent floating-point errors near the boundaries of $0$ and $1$.\n\n**2. Containment Strategies and Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nThe problem specifies three containment strategies, which are different models for the temporal evolution of the conversion probability $c_t$:\n-   **S1 (Split-Drive):** The conversion efficacy depends on the frequency $q_t$ of a co-released, unlinked endonuclease component. $c_t = c \\cdot q_t$, where $c$ is a base conversion rate and $q_t$ decays as $q_{t+1} = (1-\\lambda)q_t$ with initial condition $q_0=x_0$.\n-   **S2 (Daisy-Chain):** The drive construct is designed to lose its homing capability over a fixed number of generations $L$. This is modeled as a linear decay: $c_t = c \\cdot \\max\\{0, 1 - t/L\\}$.\n-   **S3 (Threshold-Reliance):** The conversion rate is constant, $c_t=c$. Containment is attempted by releasing the drive at a frequency $x_0$ below a theoretical invasion threshold $\\hat{x}^{(0)}$. This threshold is an unstable interior fixed point of the dynamics under a nominal set of parameters $(c_0, h_0, s_0)$. It is found by numerically solving $x_{t+1}(x) - x = 0$ for $x \\in (0,1)$. We will implement a numerical root-finding procedure based on scanning followed by bisection. If no interior root is found, $\\hat{x}^{(0)} = 0$.\n\nFor each strategy, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess its robustness. A $5 \\times 5 \\times 5$ grid of parameters $(c, h, s)$ is generated over specified uncertainty ranges. For each of the $125$ parameter sets, the system is simulated, and the outcome is classified as a \"failure\" based on the following criteria:\n-   **FM1 (Fixation):** $\\max_{0 \\le t \\le G} x_t \\ge x_{\\mathrm{fix}} = 0.95$.\n-   **FM2 (Persistence):** $x_G \\ge x_{\\mathrm{persist}} = 0.05$ and FM1 is not met.\n-   **FM3 (Threshold Breach, S3 only):** If $x_0 < \\hat{x}^{(0)}$, a failure occurs if $\\max_{0 \\le t \\le G} x_t \\ge \\hat{x}^{(0)}$.\n\nA simulation run is a failure if any applicable mode is triggered. The final result for each test case is the failure probability, which is the total number of failed runs divided by $125$.\n\nThe implementation will follow a modular structure. A core function will compute $x_{t+1}$ from $x_t$. Helper functions will manage the simulation loop for each strategy and check for failure modes. A top-level function will orchestrate the sensitivity analysis for each of the four test cases and format the final output.", "answer": "[0.448,0.560,0.424,0.000]", "id": "2749949"}]}
