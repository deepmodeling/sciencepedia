Since $c_x, h_x, y$ are all positive, this requires the numerator to be positive: $(m_x - d_x)y - d_x h_x > 0$.\nIf $m_x \\le d_x$, the numerator is always negative for $y>0$, so no positive $x$ values exist on this nullcline.

To analyze its local stability, we linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix $J(x,y)$.\nLet $F(x,y) = x(-d_x + \\frac{m_x y}{h_x + y} - c_x x)$ and $G(x,y) = y(-d_y + \\frac{m_y x}{h_y + x} - c_y y)$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -d_x + \\frac{m_x y}{h_x + y} - 2c_x x$\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{m_x x h_x}{(h_x+y)^2}$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = \\frac{m_y y h_y}{(h_y+x)^2}$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} = -d_y + \\frac{m_y x}{h_y + x} - 2c_y y$\nEvaluating the Jacobian at $(x,y)=(0,0)$:\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -d_x & 0 \\\\ 0 & -d_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -d_x$ and $\\lambda_2 = -d_y$. Given that $d_x>0$ and $d_y>0$, both eigenvalues are strictly negative. Therefore, the extinction equilibrium $(0,0)$ is a stable node. This is expected for an obligate mutualism, where both species decline to extinction in the absence of their partner.\n\nc) Symmetric case and bifurcation analysis\nUnder symmetric engineering, the parameters are set as $d_x=d_y=d$, $c_x=c_y=c$, $m_x=m_y=m$, and $h_x=h_y=h$. We seek symmetric coexistence equilibria of the form $(x,y)=(z,z)$ with $z>0$. Substituting into the governing equations at steady state:\n$$\nz\\left(-d + \\frac{m z}{h + z} - c z\\right) = 0\n$$\nFor a nontrivial equilibrium ($z>0$), we must solve:\n$$\n-d + \\frac{m z}{h + z} - c z = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{m z}{h + z} = d + c z \\implies m z = (d+cz)(h+z) = dh + dz + chz + cz^2\n$$\nThis leads to a quadratic equation for $z$:\n$$\ncz^2 + (d+ch-m)z + dh = 0\n$$\nA pair of nontrivial symmetric equilibria is created via a saddle-node bifurcation. This occurs when the two roots of the quadratic equation for $z$ merge into a single real root. This corresponds to the discriminant of the quadratic equation being zero:\n$$\n\\Delta = (d+ch-m)^2 - 4(c)(dh) = 0\n$$\nThis gives $(d+ch-m)^2 = 4cdh$, so $d+ch-m = \\pm 2\\sqrt{cdh}$, which implies $m = d+ch \\pm 2\\sqrt{cdh}$.\nThese expressions can be factored: $m = (\\sqrt{d} \\pm \\sqrt{ch})^2$.\nThe equilibria must be positive ($z>0$). The product of the roots is $z_1 z_2 = dh/c > 0$, so the roots have the same sign. The sum of the roots is $z_1+z_2 = -(d+ch-m)/c = (m-d-ch)/c$. For the roots to be positive, their sum must be positive, which requires $m > d+ch$.\nOf the two possible values for $m$ from the discriminant condition, only $m = d+ch+2\\sqrt{cdh}$ satisfies $m>d+ch$. The other value, $m=d+ch-2\\sqrt{cdh}$, leads to a negative sum of roots.\nTherefore, the critical mutualism strength $m_c$ at which a pair of positive symmetric equilibria is created is:\n$$\nm_c = d+ch+2\\sqrt{cdh} = (\\sqrt{d}+\\sqrt{ch})^2\n$$\nFor $m > m_c$, two distinct positive equilibria exist. Let them be $z_1$ and $z_2$, with $0 < z_1 < z_2$. The stability of these equilibria $(z,z)$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at $(z,z)$:\n$$\nJ(z,z) = \\begin{pmatrix} -cz & \\frac{mzh}{(h+z)^2} \\\\ \\frac{mzh}{(h+z)^2} & -cz \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1,2} = -cz \\pm \\frac{mzh}{(h+z)^2}$. Since all parameters and $z$ are positive, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -cz - \\frac{mzh}{(h+z)^2}$ is always negative. The stability is determined by the sign of $\\lambda_1 = -cz + \\frac{mzh}{(h+z)^2} = z(-c + \\frac{mh}{(h+z)^2})$.\nThe equilibrium is stable if $\\lambda_1 < 0$, which is equivalent to $c > \\frac{mh}{(h+z)^2}$.\nA graphical analysis or direct evaluation shows that for the smaller root $z_1$, the inequality is reversed ($c < \\frac{mh}{(h+z_1)^2}$), so $\\lambda_1>0$ and this equilibrium is an unstable saddle. For the larger root $z_2$, the inequality holds ($c > \\frac{mh}{(h+z_2)^2}$), so $\\lambda_1<0$ and this equilibrium is a stable node.\nThus, for the parameter range $m > m_c$, the system has two stable equilibria: the extinction point $(0,0)$ and the coexistence point $(z_2, z_2)$, separated by the unstable saddle point $(z_1, z_1)$. This is the condition for bistability. The problem asks for the critical value $m_c$ that marks the onset of this regime.\n\nThe expression for $m_c$ is:\n$m_c = (\\sqrt{d}+\\sqrt{ch})^2$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(\\sqrt{d} + \\sqrt{ch})^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2779463"}]}
