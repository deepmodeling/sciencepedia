The area ratio term is:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{A_m}{A_c}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{12000}{7000}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{12}{7}}\n$$\n\nThe argument of the exponential in the sieving factor ratio is, with $P = 80 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\n\\frac{A_m - A_c}{\\pi P^2} = \\frac{12000 - 7000}{\\pi (80)^2} = \\frac{5000}{6400 \\pi} = \\frac{50}{64 \\pi} = \\frac{25}{32 \\pi}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these components back into the expression for the velocity ratio and compute the final numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{v_c}{v_m} = \\left(\\frac{0.1778}{0.248}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{12}{7}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{25}{32 \\pi}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v_c}{v_m} \\approx (0.716935) \\times (1.309307) \\times \\exp(0.248695)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v_c}{v_m} \\approx (0.716935) \\times (1.309307) \\times (1.282363) \\approx 1.203855\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.204$.\nThis result shows that the correctly folded, more compact structure migrates faster than the misfolded, larger structure. This is due to the dominant effect of the Ogston sieving mechanism. While the misfolded species has a higher charge density (due to more ssDNA) and a smaller hydrodynamic radius than its area would suggest (due to the $\\sqrt{A}$ dependence), these effects are outweighed by the severe penalty in gel sieving imposed by its much larger projected area $A_m$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.204}\n$$", "id": "2729851"}]}
