The use of a morphogen gradient, noisy sensing, decoding via function inversion, and an exponential profile (a solution to the diffusion-degradation equation) are all standard, well-established concepts in quantitative biology and biophysics. The model is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information and a clear, structured path for the derivation (Taylor linearization). The inputs ($c(x)$, $\\sigma_c$) are defined, and the output ($\\sigma_x(x)$) is specified unambiguously.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, using precise mathematical and scientific language, and is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nAll other validation criteria are met. The problem does not contain contradictions, incompleteness, trivialities, or unscientific premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Positional Uncertainty**\n\nThe position estimate $\\hat{x}$ is a function of the measured concentration $c_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, specifically $\\hat{x} = c^{-1}(c_{\\mathrm{meas}})$. The measured concentration at a true position $x$ is $c_{\\mathrm{meas}} = c(\\hat{x})$. The problem asks to start with a first-order Taylor series expansion of $c(\\hat{x})$ around the true position $x$:\n$$c(\\hat{x}) \\approx c(x) + (\\hat{x} - x) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$$\nHere, $\\hat{x} - x$ represents the error in the position estimate.\nWe are given that the measured concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{meas}} = c(x) + \\eta$, where $\\eta$ is the measurement noise. Equating the two expressions for the measured concentration, we have:\n$$c(x) + \\eta \\approx c(x) + (\\hat{x} - x) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$$\nSubtracting $c(x)$ from both sides yields an approximate relationship between the concentration noise $\\eta$ and the positional error $\\hat{x} - x$:\n$$\\eta \\approx (\\hat{x} - x) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the positional error gives:\n$$\\hat{x} - x \\approx \\frac{\\eta}{\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}}$$\nThe positional uncertainty $\\sigma_{x}(x)$ is the standard deviation of the position estimate $\\hat{x}$. Since $x$ is a fixed, non-random quantity, the variance of the estimate $\\hat{x}$ is equal to the variance of the error $\\hat{x} - x$.\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2}(x) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{x}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{x} - x)$$\nUsing the derived approximation for the error, we find the variance:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2}(x) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}}\\right)$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ is evaluated at the true position $x$ and is therefore a deterministic quantity, not a random variable. We can treat it as a constant factor in the variance calculation. Using the property that for a random variable $Y$ and a constant $a$, $\\mathrm{Var}(aY) = a^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2}(x) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}}\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{Var}(\\eta)$$\nWe are given that the standard deviation of the noise $\\eta$ is $\\sigma_{c}$, so its variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta) = \\sigma_{c}^{2}$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2}(x) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_{c}^{2}}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)^{2}}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the general expression for the positional uncertainty. As standard deviation must be non-negative, we use the absolute value of the derivative in the denominator:\n$$\\sigma_{x}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\left|\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right|}$$\n\n**Specialization for an Exponential Gradient**\n\nThe problem now requires us to specialize this result for the exponential concentration profile $c(x) = c_{0} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $c(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[c_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right] = c_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) = -\\frac{c_{0}}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nNext, we take the absolute value of this derivative. Since $c_{0} > 0$, $\\lambda > 0$, and the exponential function is always positive, the absolute value is:\n$$\\left|\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{c_{0}}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{c_{0}}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression into the general formula for $\\sigma_{x}(x)$:\n$$\\sigma_{x}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\frac{c_{0}}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)}$$\nSimplifying this fraction yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\sigma_{x}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{c} \\lambda}{c_{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n\n**Analysis of the Limit $|\\partial c/\\partial x| \\to 0$**\n\nBased on the general derived expression $\\sigma_{x}(x) = \\sigma_{c} / |\\partial c/\\partial x|$, we can analyze the behavior as the magnitude of the gradient slope approaches zero. As $|\\partial c/\\partial x| \\to 0$, with a non-zero measurement noise $\\sigma_{c} > 0$, the denominator of the fraction approaches zero while the numerator remains a positive constant.\nMathematically, this means the positional uncertainty $\\sigma_{x}(x)$ diverges to infinity:\n$$\\lim_{|\\partial c/\\partial x| \\to 0} \\sigma_{x}(x) = \\infty$$\nThe physical justification is that a shallow or flat morphogen gradient provides very poor positional information. When the concentration changes very little with position, a small, unavoidable noise in the concentration measurement ($\\eta$) makes it impossible to distinguish between widely separated positions. The cell's decoding mechanism maps a small concentration range, blurred by noise, to a very large range of possible positions, resulting in a large positional uncertainty. In the limit of a perfectly flat gradient ($|\\partial c/\\partial x| = 0$), the local concentration carries no information about position, and the uncertainty becomes infinite.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sigma_{c} \\lambda}{c_{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2779048"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple gradients established by a source, multicellular systems can generate complex patterns through self-organization.

The problem requires us to analyze the behavior of an activator-inhibitor system on a one-dimensional domain of length $L=\\pi$. The dynamics are governed by a reaction-diffusion equation, and the stability of the homogeneous steady state is determined by the linearized system.\n\nFirst, we determine the set of admissible spatial wavenumbers, $k$, under no-flux (Neumann) boundary conditions. These conditions state that the spatial derivative of the concentration fields must be zero at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nThe spatial eigenfunctions that satisfy these boundary conditions for the Laplacian operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ are of the form $\\cos(k x)$. Let us verify this. The derivative is $-\\sin(k x)$ multiplied by $k$. At $x=0$, $-\\sin(k \\cdot 0) = 0$, which is always satisfied. At $x=L$, we require $-\\sin(k L) = 0$. This condition is met if $k L = n \\pi$ for any non-negative integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThus, the discrete set of admissible wavenumbers is given by:\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{n \\pi}{L}\n$$\nGiven that the tissue length is $L=\\pi$, the admissible wavenumbers simplify to:\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{n \\pi}{\\pi} = n, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThe pattern that emerges at early times is determined by the mode with the highest growth rate $\\sigma(k_n)$. We are given the dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\sigma(k) = \\sigma_{0} - \\gamma (k - k_{c})^{2}\n$$\nwith parameters $\\sigma_{0}=0.50$, $\\gamma=1.00$, and $k_{c}=2.60$. To find the dominant mode, we must find the integer $n$ for which $k_n = n$ maximizes $\\sigma(k_n)$. The function $\\sigma(k)$ is a concave-down parabola with its maximum at $k=k_c$. Therefore, the value of $\\sigma(k_n)$ is maximized when the discrete wavenumber $k_n$ is closest to the most unstable wavenumber $k_c$.\n\nWe must find the integer $n \\ge 0$ that minimizes the distance $|k_n - k_c| = |n - 2.60|$. We evaluate this for the integers surrounding $2.60$:\n- For $n=2$, the distance is $|2 - 2.60| = 0.60$.\n- For $n=3$, the distance is $|3 - 2.60| = 0.40$.\n\nThe distance is smaller for $n=3$. Therefore, the mode with index $n=3$ has the largest positive growth rate among all admissible modes. The corresponding wavenumber is $k_3 = 3$. This is the mode that will dominate the pattern formation at early times.\nAs a check, the problem states the system is stable to uniform perturbations ($k=0$). Let us compute $\\sigma(k_0=0)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(0) = 0.50 - 1.00(0 - 2.60)^2 = 0.50 - 6.76 = -6.26 < 0\n$$\nThis confirms the stability of the homogeneous steady state, as required. The growth rates for the competing modes are $\\sigma(2) = 0.50 - 1.00(2-2.60)^2 = 0.50 - 0.36 = 0.14$ and $\\sigma(3) = 0.50 - 1.00(3-2.60)^2 = 0.50 - 0.16 = 0.34$. Since $\\sigma(3) > \\sigma(2)$ and $\\sigma(3)>0$, the mode $n=3$ is indeed the fastest-growing unstable mode.\n\nNext, we must predict the number of activator stripes. The problem defines this as \"the total count of local maxima of the activator field corresponding to the spatial eigenfunction on $[0,L]$ (including possible maxima at the boundaries)\".\nThe spatial eigenfunction for the dominant mode $n=3$ is:\n$$\n\\phi_3(x) = \\cos(k_3 x) = \\cos(3x)\n$$\nWe need to find the number of local maxima of this function on the domain $x \\in [0, \\pi]$.
