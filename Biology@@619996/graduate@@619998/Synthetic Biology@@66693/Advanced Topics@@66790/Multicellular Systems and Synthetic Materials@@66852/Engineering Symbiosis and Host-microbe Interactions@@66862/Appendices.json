The encoded symbiotic gene module is translated but does not contribute to translation capacity or biomass production efficiency; it consumes a fixed proteome mass fraction denoted by $\\phi_{S}$ when induced. Consider a coarse-grained proteome allocation model in which the proteome mass is partitioned into a ribosomal sector with fraction $\\phi_{R}$, a fixed housekeeping and metabolic sector with fraction $\\phi_{Q}$ (assumed constant in a nutrient-saturated, translation-limited regime), and the synthetic symbiosis sector with fraction $\\phi_{S}$.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of proteome allocation, well-posed with sufficient constraints for a unique solution, and framed using objective, formalizable language. All conditions for a valid problem are met. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe derivation begins from the two fundamental bases provided: the proteome budget and the relationship between growth rate and translation.\n\nFirst, the total proteome mass is partitioned into three sectors, and the sum of their mass fractions must equal unity. This is the proteome budget constraint:\n$$\n\\phi_{R} + \\phi_{Q} + \\phi_{S} = 1\n$$\nwhere $\\phi_{R}$ is the ribosomal protein fraction, $\\phi_{Q}$ is the housekeeping protein fraction, and $\\phi_{S}$ is the synthetic symbiosis protein fraction.\n\nSecond, the specific growth rate, $\\lambda$, is stated to be a direct consequence of the translational activity of the ribosomes. The problem specifies that under saturating nutrient conditions, the growth rate is proportional to the *active* ribosomal proteome fraction. The proportionality constant is given as $\\kappa$. The total ribosomal fraction is $\\phi_{R}$, but a fraction $\\phi_{R}^{0}$ is translationally inactive. Therefore, the fraction of the proteome comprised of active, elongating ribosomes is $(\\phi_{R} - \\phi_{R}^{0})$.\n\nThe resulting growth law is thus:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\kappa (\\phi_{R} - \\phi_{R}^{0})\n$$\nThis equation is valid under the condition that $\\phi_{R} \\ge \\phi_{R}^{0}$, as a negative active ribosomal fraction is not physically meaningful.\n\nThe objective is to find $\\lambda$ as a function of the synthetic burden $\\phi_{S}$, and the constant parameters $\\kappa$, $\\phi_{Q}$, and $\\phi_{R}^{0}$. The current expression for $\\lambda$ depends on the variable $\\phi_{R}$, which itself changes as the cell allocates resources. We must eliminate $\\phi_{R}$ by using the proteome budget constraint.\n\nFrom the budget equation, we can express $\\phi_{R}$ in terms of the other fractions:\n$$\n\\phi_{R} = 1 - \\phi_{Q} - \\phi_{S}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\phi_{R}$ into the growth law equation:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\kappa \\left( (1 - \\phi_{Q} - \\phi_{S}) - \\phi_{R}^{0} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the specific growth rate $\\lambda$ as a function of the desired variables. By rearranging the terms inside the parenthesis, we arrive at the final, simplified form of the growth law, $\\lambda(\\phi_{S})$:\n$$\n\\lambda(\\phi_{S}) = \\kappa (1 - \\phi_{Q} - \\phi_{R}^{0} - \\phi_{S})\n$$\nThis result is the new growth law. It describes a linear decrease in the specific growth rate as the proteome fraction $\\phi_{S}$ allocated to the non-contributory symbiotic function increases. The slope of this linear relationship is $-\\kappa$. The maximum theoretical growth rate, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, is achieved when no synthetic burden is present ($\\phi_{S} = 0$), which is $\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\kappa (1 - \\phi_{Q} - \\phi_{R}^{0})$. The growth rate becomes zero when the synthetic burden is large enough such that $1 - \\phi_{Q} - \\phi_{R}^{0} - \\phi_{S} = 0$, which corresponds to the point where the remaining ribosomal fraction $\\phi_{R}$ equals the inactive fraction $\\phi_{R}^{0}$.

It is a standard problem in biochemical engineering that can be solved by applying the principle of mass conservation.\n\nWe begin by constructing a mass balance for the metabolite $M$ in the chemostat. The general mass balance equation for a species in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), which is the model for a chemostat, is:\n$$(\\text{Rate of Accumulation}) = (\\text{Rate of Flow In}) - (\\text{Rate of Flow Out}) + (\\text{Rate of Generation}) - (\\text{Rate of Consumption})$$\nLet $M(t)$ be the concentration of the metabolite in the reactor at time $t$, and let $V$ be the constant volume of the reactor. The rate of accumulation is $V \\frac{dM}{dt}$.\n\nThe terms of the mass balance are defined as follows:\n$1$. The rate of flow of metabolite $M$ into the reactor is the product of the volumetric flow rate, $F$, and the influent concentration, $M_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The dilution rate $D$ is defined as $D = F/V$, so $F = DV$. Thus, the rate of flow in is $(DV)M_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n$2$. The reactor is well-mixed, so the concentration of $M$ in the outflow stream is the same as the concentration inside the reactor, $M(t)$. The rate of flow out is therefore $(DV)M(t)$.\n$3$. The problem states that species A produces metabolite $M$ at a volumetric rate of $k_A x_A$. This is a generation term. For the total volume $V$, the total rate of generation is $V k_A x_A$.\n$4$. Species B consumes metabolite $M$ with a specific uptake rate $v_B(M) = \\dfrac{V_{\\max} M}{K_M + M}$. The volumetric consumption rate is $x_B v_B(M)$. For the total volume $V$, the total rate of consumption is $V x_B \\dfrac{V_{\\max} M}{K_M + M}$.\n\nCombining these terms into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$V \\frac{dM}{dt} = DVM_{\\mathrm{in}} - DVM + V k_A x_A - V x_B \\frac{V_{\\max} M}{K_M + M}$$\nSince the volume $V$ is constant and non-zero, we can divide the entire equation by $V$:\n$$\\frac{dM}{dt} = D(M_{\\mathrm{in}} - M) + k_A x_A - x_B \\frac{V_{\\max} M}{K_M + M}$$\nWe are asked to find the steady-state concentration, which we denote as $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. At steady state, the concentration does not change with time, so $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. Substituting $M = M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ into the equation yields:\n$$0 = D(M_{\\mathrm{in}} - M_{\\mathrm{ss}}) + k_A x_A - x_B \\frac{V_{\\max} M_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{K_M + M_{\\mathrm{ss}}}$$\nTo solve for $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, we rearrange the equation to eliminate the fraction.\n$$x_B \\frac{V_{\\max} M_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{K_M + M_{\\mathrm{ss}}} = D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - D M_{\\mathrm{ss}} + k_A x_A$$\nMultiply both sides by $(K_M + M_{\\mathrm{ss}})$:\n$$x_B V_{\\max} M_{\\mathrm{ss}} = (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A - D M_{\\mathrm{ss}})(K_M + M_{\\mathrm{ss}})$$\nNow, we expand the right side of the equation:\n$$x_B V_{\\max} M_{\\mathrm{ss}} = (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)K_M + (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)M_{\\mathrm{ss}} - D K_M M_{\\mathrm{ss}} - D M_{\\mathrm{ss}}^2$$\nWe rearrange this into the standard quadratic form $a y^2 + b y + c = 0$, where $y = M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$D M_{\\mathrm{ss}}^2 + [x_B V_{\\max} - (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A) + D K_M] M_{\\mathrm{ss}} - (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)K_M = 0$$\nLet us group the terms for the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$$D M_{\\mathrm{ss}}^2 + (D K_M + x_B V_{\\max} - D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_A x_A) M_{\\mathrm{ss}} - (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)K_M = 0$$\nThe coefficients of the quadratic equation for $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ are:\n$$a = D$$\n$$b = D K_M + x_B V_{\\max} - D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_A x_A$$\n$$c = -(D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)K_M$$\nThe solution to the quadratic equation is given by the formula $M_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nLet's analyze the terms to select the physically admissible root. The concentration $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ must be non-negative. All parameters ($D$, $k_A$, $x_A$, $x_B$, $V_{\\max}$, $K_M$, $M_{\\mathrm{in}}$) are given as strictly positive constants.\nThe coefficient $a = D$ is positive.\nThe coefficient $c = -(D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)K_M$ is the negative of a product of positive terms, so $c$ is strictly negative.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. Since $a > 0$ and $c  0$, the term $-4ac$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ is always positive, guaranteeing two distinct real roots.\nThe product of the roots is given by $c/a$. Since $a>0$ and $c0$, the product $c/a$ is negative. This implies that one root is positive and the other is negative. The physically admissible solution must be the positive root.\nTo obtain a positive root from the formula $\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we must choose the `+` sign. This is because $\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} > \\sqrt{b^2} = |b|$, so the term $-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ is always positive. The denominator $2a = 2D$ is also positive, ensuring $M_{\\mathrm{ss}} > 0$. The `-` sign would result in a negative numerator and thus a negative root.\n\nThus, the unique physically meaningful steady-state concentration is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$$-b = -(D K_M + x_B V_{\\max} - D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_A x_A) = k_A x_A + D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - D K_M - x_B V_{\\max}$$\n$$-4ac = -4(D)[-(D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)K_M] = 4D K_M (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)$$\nThe final expression for $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{(k_A x_A + D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - D K_M - x_B V_{\\max}) + \\sqrt{(D K_M + x_B V_{\\max} - D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_A x_A)^2 + 4D K_M (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)}}{2D}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical solution for the steady-state metabolite concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(k_A x_A + D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - D K_M - x_B V_{\\max}) + \\sqrt{(D K_M + x_B V_{\\max} - D M_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_A x_A)^2 + 4D K_M (D M_{\\mathrm{in}} + k_A x_A)}}{2D}}$$", "id": "2735344"}, {"introduction": "The responsible deployment of engineered microbes requires a rigorous assessment of potential ecological risks, chief among them the unintended spread of synthetic genes to native populations via horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

Derivation of the Analytic Upper Bound**\n\nLet $E$ be the event that at least one successful horizontal transfer-and-establishment occurs by time $T$. We seek an upper bound for $P(E)$. The process is a chain of three stages: contact, transfer, and establishment.\n\nFirst, according to principle (i), mass-action kinetics, the total rate of contact events between the donor population ($N_D$) and the pathogen population ($N_P$) is given by $R_{contact} = \\kappa N_D N_P$.\n\nSecond, according to principle (ii), the number of contact events in a time interval of duration $T$ can be modeled as a Poisson process. The mean number of contact events in time $T$ is $\\lambda_{contact} = R_{contact} T = \\kappa N_D N_P T$.\n\nThird, each contact event is followed by a potential gene transfer, which is a probabilistic event. According to principle (iii), this is a Bernoulli trial. The probability of a successful transfer (conjugation) per contact is $\\eta$.\n\nFourth, if a transfer occurs, the single transferred gene copy must establish in the pathogen population. According to principle (iv), the probability of establishment, $P_{est}$, for a beneficial allele with selection coefficient $s$ is bounded above by $2s$. We must also respect that a probability cannot exceed $1$. Therefore, we use the upper bound $P_{est,ub} = \\min(1, 2s)$.\n\nThe event of a single contact leading to a successful transfer *and* subsequent establishment is the logical conjunction of these independent steps. The probability of this full chain of events, given a single contact, is therefore bounded above by the product of the probabilities of the subsequent steps. Let this upper-bound probability be $p_{chain}$:\n$$p_{chain} = \\eta \\cdot P_{est,ub} = \\eta \\min(1, 2s)$$\nWe now apply the concept of thinning a Poisson process. The initial process is the stream of contact events. Each of these events results in a final \"success\" with a probability that is at most $p_{chain}$. The stream of these successful end-to-end events is therefore also a Poisson process, with a rate $R_{succ}$ bounded above by $R_{succ,ub}$:\n$$R_{succ,ub} = R_{contact} \\cdot p_{chain} = \\kappa N_D N_P \\eta \\min(1, 2s)$$\nThe mean number of successful events in time $T$, denoted $\\lambda_{succ}$, is consequently bounded above by $\\lambda_{succ,ub}$:\n$$\\lambda_{succ,ub} = R_{succ,ub} T = \\kappa N_D N_P T \\eta \\min(1, 2s)$$\nLet $X$ be the random variable for the number of successful events in time $T$. Approximating $X$ as a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda_{succ}$, we have $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{succ})$. The probability of observing at least one such event is $P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$. For a Poisson distribution, $P(X=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{succ})$. Thus, $P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{succ})$.\n\nSince the function $f(x) = 1 - \\exp(-x)$ is monotonically increasing for $x \\ge 0$, an upper bound on the probability $P(X \\ge 1)$ is obtained by substituting the upper bound for the mean, $\\lambda_{succ,ub}$.\nThe final closed-form analytic upper bound, $P_{bound}$, for the probability of at least one successful transfer-and-establishment event is:\n$$P_{bound} = 1 - \\exp(-\\kappa N_D N_P T \\eta \\min(1, 2s))$$\n\n**2.
