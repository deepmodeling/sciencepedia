The porous substrate (membrane) and the epithelial monolayer behave as two permeable layers in series.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient initial conditions and parameters to solve for a unique, stable solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard exercise in transport phenomena relevant to synthetic biology and bioengineering. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe transport of the tracer across the composite barrier is governed by Fick's first law. Under the quasi-steady state assumption, the molar flux $J$ (moles per unit area per unit time) is constant through the barrier and is proportional to the concentration difference across the barrier. The total molar flow rate, $\\dot{n}$, from the donor to the receiver chamber is given by:\n$$ \\dot{n} = J A = P_{eff} A (C_D(t) - C_R(t)) $$\nwhere $A$ is the barrier area, $P_{eff}$ is the effective permeability of the composite barrier, and $C_D(t)$ and $C_R(t)$ are the time-dependent concentrations in the donor and receiver chambers, respectively.\n\nThe composite barrier consists of the membrane and the epithelial layer in series. For Fickian diffusion, resistances add in series. The resistance of a layer is the inverse of its permeability. Note that some definitions use resistance as $1/P$, others as $1/(PA)$. Here, we define the overall resistance relation independent of area. The total concentration drop $\\Delta C_{tot} = C_D - C_R$ is the sum of the drops across the membrane ($\\Delta C_m$) and the epithelium ($\\Delta C_e$).\n$$ \\Delta C_{tot} = \\Delta C_m + \\Delta C_e $$\nThe flux $J$ is constant through both layers in the quasi-steady state:\n$$ J = P_m \\Delta C_m = P_e \\Delta C_e = P_{eff} \\Delta C_{tot} $$\nFrom this, we express the individual concentration drops in terms of the flux: $\\Delta C_m = J/P_m$ and $\\Delta C_e = J/P_e$. Substituting these into the sum:\n$$ \\Delta C_{tot} = \\frac{J}{P_m} + \\frac{J}{P_e} = J \\left(\\frac{1}{P_m} + \\frac{1}{P_e}\\right) $$\nSince $\\Delta C_{tot} = J/P_{eff}$, we equate the expressions:\n$$ \\frac{J}{P_{eff}} = J \\left(\\frac{1}{P_m} + \\frac{1}{P_e}\\right) $$\nThis yields the relation for the effective permeability:\n$$ \\frac{1}{P_{eff}} = \\frac{1}{P_m} + \\frac{1}{P_e} \\implies P_{eff} = \\frac{P_m P_e}{P_m + P_e} $$\n\nNext, we establish the mass balance equations for the two chambers. The rate of change of moles of tracer in the receiver chamber, $n_R$, is equal to the molar flow rate into it:\n$$ \\frac{dn_R}{dt} = \\dot{n} = P_{eff} A (C_D(t) - C_R(t)) $$\nSince the chamber volume $V_R$ is constant, $n_R(t) = V_R C_R(t)$, so $\\frac{dn_R}{dt} = V_R \\frac{dC_R}{dt}$. The differential equation for $C_R$ is:\n$$ V_R \\frac{dC_R}{dt} = P_{eff} A (C_D(t) - C_R(t)) $$\nThe system is closed, so the total number of moles of tracer is constant.\n$$ n_D(t) + n_R(t) = n_{total} = \\text{constant} $$\nAt time $t=0$, $n_D(0) = V_D C_0$ and $n_R(0) = 0$. Thus, $n_{total} = V_D C_0$.\nIn terms of concentrations, the conservation equation is:\n$$ V_D C_D(t) + V_R C_R(t) = V_D C_0 $$\nFrom this, we express $C_D(t)$ in terms of $C_R(t)$:\n$$ C_D(t) = C_0 - \\frac{V_R}{V_D} C_R(t) $$\nSubstituting this into the differential equation for $C_R$:\n$$ V_R \\frac{dC_R}{dt} = P_{eff} A \\left( \\left(C_0 - \\frac{V_R}{V_D} C_R(t)\\right) - C_R(t) \\right) $$\n$$ V_R \\frac{dC_R}{dt} = P_{eff} A \\left( C_0 - \\left(1 + \\frac{V_R}{V_D}\\right) C_R(t) \\right) = P_{eff} A \\left( C_0 - \\frac{V_D + V_R}{V_D} C_R(t) \\right) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = q(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dC_R}{dt} + \\left( P_{eff} A \\frac{V_D + V_R}{V_D V_R} \\right) C_R(t) = \\frac{P_{eff} A C_0}{V_R} $$\nLet us define the rate constant $\\beta = P_{eff} A \\left(\\frac{1}{V_D} + \\frac{1}{V_R}\\right) = P_{eff} A \\frac{V_D + V_R}{V_D V_R}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dC_R}{dt} + \\beta C_R(t) = \\frac{P_{eff} A C_0}{V_R} $$\nThe solution to this ODE is the sum of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The particular solution is the steady-state concentration as $t \\to \\infty$, where $\\frac{dC_R}{dt} = 0$. This equilibrium concentration, $C_{eq}$, is when the concentrations in both chambers are equal:\n$$ C_{eq} = \\frac{n_{total}}{V_{total}} = \\frac{V_D C_0}{V_D + V_R} $$\nThe general solution is of the form $C_R(t) = C_{eq} + K \\exp(-\\beta t)$, where $K$ is a constant of integration.\nWe use the initial condition $C_R(0) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = C_{eq} + K \\exp(0) \\implies K = -C_{eq} $$\nThus, the closed-form expression for the receiver concentration is:\n$$ C_R(t) = C_{eq} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-\\beta t) \\right) = \\frac{V_D C_0}{V_D + V_R} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left( -P_{eff} A \\left(\\frac{1}{V_D} + \\frac{1}{V_R}\\right) t \\right) \\right) $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters.

All provided data, models, and assumptions are physically reasonable and standard within the field of rheology and polymer processing, particularly as applied to biofabrication. The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a complete solution will be presented.\n\nThe problem requires two primary tasks: first, to derive an expression connecting the experimentally measured rheological properties to the predicted die swell ratio, and second, to compute the final width of the printed hydrogel filament.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the provided rheological data are consistent with the single-mode Maxwell model, which is the linear viscoelastic basis for the non-linear Upper-Convected Maxwell (UCM) model used to describe the flow. The problem provides the following relations for the storage modulus $G'$ and loss modulus $G''$ for a single-mode Maxwell fluid:\n$$G'(\\omega) = G_0\\frac{\\omega^2\\lambda^2}{1+\\omega^2\\lambda^2}$$\n$$G''(\\omega) = G_0\\frac{\\omega\\lambda}{1+\\omega^2\\lambda^2}$$\nHere, $G_0$ is the plateau modulus, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\lambda$ is the relaxation time.

This consistency confirms that the single-mode Maxwell model is an appropriate description for the bioink's rheological behavior under these conditions, which in turn justifies the use of the UCM model for the steady shear extrusion process.\n\nNow we proceed to derive the expression for the die swell ratio, $B$. We begin with the provided Tanner–Barus relation:\n$$B = 1 + c_B\\frac{N_{1w}}{2\\tau_w}$$\nwhere $N_{1w}$ is the first normal stress difference at the nozzle wall, $\\tau_w$ is the shear stress at the wall, and $c_B = 1.5$ is a given empirical constant. The ratio $\\frac{N_{1w}}{2\\tau_w}$ represents the recoverable shear strain at the wall.\n\nFor a UCM fluid in steady shear, the constitutive relations for $N_1$ and shear stress $\\tau$ are given as:\n$$N_1 = 2\\eta_0\\lambda\\,\\dot{\\gamma}^2$$\n$$\\tau = \\eta_0\\,\\dot{\\gamma}$$\nwhere $\\eta_0$ is the zero-shear viscosity and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the shear rate.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as dictated.\n\n1. Derivation of Interstitial Velocity, $u$.\nDarcy's law for one-dimensional flow relates the superficial velocity $u$ to the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ through the medium's permeability $k$ and the fluid's dynamic viscosity $\\mu$:\n$$ u = - \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nFor a homogeneous porous slab of length $L$ with a steady pressure drop $\\Delta p$ across it, the pressure gradient is assumed to be constant. The flow is driven from a region of high pressure to low pressure, so the gradient is negative with respect to the direction of flow. We can approximate the gradient as:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} $$\nSubstituting this into Darcy's law yields the expression for the interstitial velocity:\n$$ u = - \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} \\right) = \\frac{k \\Delta p}{\\mu L} $$\n\n2. Derivation of Shear Stress, $\\tau$.\nThe problem specifies that the local shear stress $\\tau$ experienced by cells scales with the viscosity $\\mu$ and a characteristic shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$. The shear rate is estimated as the ratio of a characteristic velocity to a characteristic length scale. For flow in a porous medium, the appropriate velocity scale is the superficial velocity $u$, and the length scale is the characteristic pore size $a$. Therefore, the shear rate is estimated as:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma} \\sim \\frac{u}{a} $$\nThe shear stress is the product of viscosity and shear rate. Adopting this scaling relation as an equality for estimation purposes gives:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{\\mu u}{a} $$\n\n3. Derivation of Drift Speed, $v_b$.\nThe problem states that the cellular drift speed $v_b$ due to mechanotaxis is directly proportional to the local shear stress $\\tau$. The constant of proportionality is the mechanosensitivity coefficient $s$. The relationship is thus:\n$$ v_b = s \\tau $$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $\\tau$:\n$$ v_b = s \\left( \\frac{\\mu u}{a} \\right) $$\nAnd further substituting the expression for $u$:\n$$ v_b = s \\frac{\\mu}{a} \\left( \\frac{k \\Delta p}{\\mu L} \\right) = \\frac{s k \\Delta p}{a L} $$\n\n4. Derivation of Migration Bias Index, $B$.\nThe one-dimensional displacement $X(T)$ of a cell after an observation time $T$ is modeled by an advection-diffusion process. This process corresponds to a biased random walk. For constant drift velocity $v_b$ and constant diffusivity $D_c$, the probability distribution of the displacement $X(T)$ is a Gaussian distribution, $X(T) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2)$, with mean and variance given by:\n$$ \\mu_X = v_b T $$\n$$ \\sigma_X^2 = 2 D_c T $$\nThe probability of a positive net displacement, $P_{\\text{down}}$, is $P(X(T) > 0)$. To compute this, we standardize the variable $X(T)$. Let $Z = \\frac{X(T) - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$ be the standard normal variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$ P(X(T) > 0) = P\\left( \\frac{X(T) - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} > \\frac{0 - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\right) = P\\left( Z > -\\frac{\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\right) $$\nBy the symmetry property of the standard normal distribution, $P(Z > -z) = P(Z < z) = \\Phi(z)$, where $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. In our case, $z = \\frac{\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} = \\frac{v_b T}{\\sqrt{2 D_c T}} = \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{2 D_c}} $$\nTherefore, $P_{\\text{down}} = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{2 D_c}}\\right)$. The CDF $\\Phi(z)$ is related to the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$, by the identity $\\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[1 + \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right]$. Applying this identity:\n$$ P_{\\text{down}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{2 D_c}} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) \\right] $$\nThe migration bias index $B$ is defined as $B = 2 P_{\\text{down}} - 1$. Substituting the expression for $P_{\\text{down}}$:\n$$ B = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) \\right] \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ B = \\left( 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) \\right) - 1 $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the bias index:\n$$ B = \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) $$\nThe computational implementation will be a direct translation of these derived analytical expressions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import erf\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of calculating interstitial velocity, shear stress,\n    and cell migration bias index in a bioprinted hydrogel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains: (k, mu, delta_p, L, a, s, Dc, T) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0e-14, 1.0e-3, 100, 1.0e-3, 5.0e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.0e-12, 3600),\n        (1.0e-14, 1.0e-3, 0, 1.0e-3, 5.0e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.0e-12, 3600),\n        (1.0e-15, 1.5e-3, 200, 1.5e-3, 3.0e-6, 2.0e-5, 5.0e-13, 7200),\n        (2.0e-14, 3.0e-3, 300, 2.0e-3, 6.0e-6, 0.5e-5, 1.5e-12, 5400),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        k, mu, delta_p, L, a, s, Dc, T = case\n\n        # 1.
