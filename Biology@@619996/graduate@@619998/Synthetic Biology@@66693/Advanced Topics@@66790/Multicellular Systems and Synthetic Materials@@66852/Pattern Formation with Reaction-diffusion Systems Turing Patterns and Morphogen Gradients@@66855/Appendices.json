It is a well-posed mathematical problem grounded in the standard theory of reaction-diffusion systems. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nA spatially homogeneous steady state, denoted by $(u^{*}, v^{*})$, of a reaction-diffusion system is defined by the condition that the local reaction kinetics vanish. For the given system, this is expressed by the set of algebraic equations:\n$$f(u^{*}, v^{*}) = \\rho - k u^{*} - \\eta u^{*} v^{*} = 0$$\n$$g(u^{*}, v^{*}) = \\sigma u^{*} - \\lambda v^{*} = 0$$\n\nHere, $u^{*}$ and $v^{*}$ are the steady-state concentrations of the two species, and $\\rho$, $k$, $\\eta$, $\\sigma$, $\\lambda$ are real parameters. The problem demands a closed-form expression for $(u^{*}, v^{*})$ and the conditions under which $u^{*} > 0$ and $v^{*} > 0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $g(u^{*}, v^{*}) = 0$, we can express $v^{*}$ in terms of $u^{*}$. Assuming $\\lambda \\neq 0$:\n$$\\sigma u^{*} = \\lambda v^{*}$$\n$$v^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} u^{*}$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $v^{*}$ into the first equation, $f(u^{*}, v^{*}) = 0$:\n$$\\rho - k u^{*} - \\eta u^{*} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} u^{*}\\right) = 0$$\n\nThis gives a quadratic equation for $u^{*}$:\n$$\\rho - k u^{*} - \\frac{\\eta \\sigma}{\\lambda} (u^{*})^{2} = 0$$\n\nTo facilitate solving this equation, we rearrange it into the standard quadratic form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\eta \\sigma}{\\lambda}\\right) (u^{*})^{2} + k u^{*} - \\rho = 0$$\n\nWe solve for $u^{*}$ using the quadratic formula, $u^{*} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, where $A = \\frac{\\eta \\sigma}{\\lambda}$, $B = k$, and $C = -\\rho$. The use of the formula requires $A \\neq 0$, so we assume $\\eta \\neq 0$ and $\\sigma \\neq 0$.\n$$u^{*} = \\frac{-k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 - 4 \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\sigma}{\\lambda}\\right)(-\\rho)}}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\sigma}{\\lambda}\\right)}$$\n$$u^{*} = \\frac{-k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda}}}{\\frac{2\\eta\\sigma}{\\lambda}}$$\n$$u^{*} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\eta\\sigma} \\left( -k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda}} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem requires a biologically meaningful steady state, which dictates that concentrations must be strictly positive, i.e., $u^{*} > 0$ and $v^{*} > 0$. From the relation $v^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} u^{*}$, if $u^{*} > 0$, then $v^{*} > 0$ if and only if $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} > 0$. This means $\\sigma$ and $\\lambda$ must have the same sign.\n\nFor a unique positive solution for $u^{*}$ to exist, the product of the roots of the quadratic equation must be negative. The product of the roots is given by $\\frac{C}{A}$.\n$$u^{*}_1 u^{*}_2 = \\frac{-\\rho}{\\frac{\\eta\\sigma}{\\lambda}} = -\\frac{\\rho\\lambda}{\\eta\\sigma}$$\nFor one root to be positive and the other negative, we require $u^{*}_1 u^{*}_2 < 0$, which implies:\n$$-\\frac{\\rho\\lambda}{\\eta\\sigma} < 0 \\quad\\implies\\quad \\frac{\\rho\\lambda}{\\eta\\sigma} > 0$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta} \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sigma} > 0$. Since we already established that $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} > 0$ (and thus $\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sigma} > 0$), this condition simplifies to $\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta} > 0$. This means $\\rho$ and $\\eta$ must have the same sign.\n\nLet's check the discriminant, $\\Delta = k^2 + \\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda}$. Under the conditions $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} > 0$ and $\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta} > 0$, we have $\\rho\\eta > 0$ and therefore the term $\\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda} = 4(\\rho\\eta)\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda}\\right)$ is strictly positive. Thus, $\\Delta = k^2 + (\\text{positive term}) > 0$, guaranteeing two distinct real roots.\n\nThe two roots for $u^{*}$ are $u^{*}_{\\pm} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\eta\\sigma} \\left( -k \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta} \\right)$.\nThe conditions $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} > 0$ and $\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta} > 0$ imply $\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\eta\\sigma} > 0$.\nThe term $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{k^2 + (\\text{positive term})} > \\sqrt{k^2} = |k|$.\nTherefore, the numerator $-k + \\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is always positive. The numerator $-k - \\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is always negative.\nSince the prefactor $\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\eta\\sigma}$ is positive, the positive root corresponds to the '+' sign.\n\nThus, the unique biologically meaningful solution is:\n$$u^{*} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\eta\\sigma} \\left( -k + \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda}} \\right)$$\n\nThe corresponding steady-state concentration $v^{*}$ is:\n$$v^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} u^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} \\left[ \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\eta\\sigma} \\left( -k + \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda}} \\right) \\right]$$\n$$v^{*} = \\frac{1}{2\\eta} \\left( -k + \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4\\eta\\sigma\\rho}{\\lambda}} \\right)$$\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for this unique, strictly positive steady state $(u^{*}, v^{*})$ to exist are:\n$1$. $\\lambda, \\eta, \\sigma \\neq 0$.\n$2$. $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda} > 0$.\n$3$. $\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta} > 0$.\nIn most physical models, all parameters $\\rho, k, \\eta, \\sigma, \\lambda$ are assumed to be positive, in which case these conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for the steady state $(u^{*}, v^{*})$ is given by the expressions derived.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\lambda}{2 \\eta \\sigma} \\left( -k + \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4 \\eta \\sigma \\rho}{\\lambda}} \\right) & \\frac{1}{2 \\eta} \\left( -k + \\sqrt{k^2 + \\frac{4 \\eta \\sigma \\rho}{\\lambda}} \\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2758480"}, {"introduction": "A uniform steady state is merely a starting point; the crucial question is whether it is stable.

An instability occurs if $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_+(k)) > 0$.\n\nFirst, we verify the given condition that the well-mixed system ($k=0$) is stable. The parameters are:\n$D_u = 1$, $D_v = 20$, $L=20$.\n$\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.

This requires $\\Delta(k^2)$ to become negative, which in turn guarantees the discriminant is positive. Thus, instability occurs when the eigenvalues are real, and the condition for instability simplifies to $\\lambda_+(k) > 0$. This requires $\\Delta(k^2) < 0$.\n\nLet us analyze the function $\\Delta(k^2)$:\n$$\n\\Delta(k^2) = D_u D_v k^4 - (D_u g_v + D_v f_u) k^2 + \\det(\\mathbf{J})\n$$\nSubstituting the parameter values:\n$D_uD_v = (1)(20) = 20$.\n$D_u g_v + D_v f_u = (1)(-1) + (20)(0.5) = -1 + 10 = 9$.\n$\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = 0.5$.\nSo, $\\Delta(k^2) = 20 k^4 - 9 k^2 + 0.5$.\nA range of unstable modes exists if the minimum of this quadratic in $k^2$ is negative. The minimum occurs at $k^2 = -(-9)/(2 \\cdot 20) = 9/40$, and the minimum value is $20(9/40)^2 - 9(9/40) + 0.5 = -0.6125 < 0$, confirming the existence of an unstable band of wavenumbers.\n\nThe initially selected mode is the one with the largest growth rate, i.e., the one corresponding to the wavenumber $k_{max}$ that maximizes $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_+(k))$. The function to maximize is $\\lambda_+(k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(T(k^2) + \\sqrt{T(k^2)^2 - 4\\Delta(k^2)}\\right)$. Maximizing this complex function is non-trivial. However, in the standard analysis of Turing systems, the maximum of the growth rate is well-approximated by the minimum of the determinant function $\\Delta(k^2)$. This is because the variation in $\\Delta(k^2)$, which has a quadratic dependence on $k^2$, typically dominates the behavior of the growth rate near its maximum, compared to the linear dependence of $T(k^2)$.\n\nWe therefore find the wavenumber $k_{max}$ that maximizes the instability by minimizing $\\Delta(k^2)$ with respect to $k^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d(k^2)} \\Delta(k^2) = \\frac{d}{d(k^2)} (20(k^2)^2 - 9k^2 + 0.5) = 40k^2 - 9\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the optimal squared wavenumber:\n$$\n40 k_{max}^2 - 9 = 0 \\implies k_{max}^2 = \\frac{9}{40} = 0.225\n$$\nThe corresponding wavenumber is $k_{max} = \\sqrt{0.225} \\approx 0.474$.\n\nThe system supports only discrete wavenumbers $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.

Substituting this form into the difference equation gives:\n$$ \\hat{u}^{n+1}(k) e^{j k x_i} = \\alpha \\left(\\hat{u}^n(k) e^{j k x_{i-1}}\\right) + (1 - 2\\alpha)\\left(\\hat{u}^n(k) e^{j k x_i}\\right) + \\alpha \\left(\\hat{u}^n(k) e^{j k x_{i+1}}\\right) $$\nUsing $x_{i\\pm1} = x_i \\pm \\Delta x$, we have:\n$$ \\hat{u}^{n+1}(k) e^{j k x_i} = \\hat{u}^n(k) e^{j k x_i} \\left[ \\alpha e^{-j k \\Delta x} + (1 - 2\\alpha) + \\alpha e^{j k \\Delta x} \\right] $$\nThe amplification factor $G(k)$ is defined as the ratio of amplitudes in successive time steps, $G(k) = \\frac{\\hat{u}^{n+1}(k)}{\\hat{u}^n(k)}$. Dividing by $\\hat{u}^n(k) e^{j k x_i}$ gives:\n$$ G(k) = 1 - 2\\alpha + \\alpha (e^{j k \\Delta x} + e^{-j k \\Delta x}) $$\nUsing Euler's identity, $e^{j\\theta} + e^{-j\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we simplify the expression for $G(k)$:\n$$ G(k) = 1 - 2\\alpha + 2\\alpha \\cos(k \\Delta x) = 1 - 2\\alpha(1 - \\cos(k \\Delta x)) $$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, we obtain:\n$$ G(k) = 1 - 4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\nFor the numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any wave number $k$, i.e., $|G(k)| \\le 1$.\n$$ \\left|1 - 4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\\right| \\le 1 $$\nThis single inequality is equivalent to the pair of inequalities:\n$$ -1 \\le 1 - 4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\le 1 $$\nThe right-hand side inequality, $1 - 4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\le 1$, simplifies to $-4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\le 0$. Since $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} > 0$ and $\\sin^2(\\cdot) \\ge 0$, this condition is always fulfilled.\n\nThe left-hand side inequality imposes the stability constraint:\n$$ -1 \\le 1 - 4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ 4\\alpha \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\le 2 $$\n$$ \\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)} $$\nThis constraint must hold for all possible wave numbers $k$. The most restrictive condition occurs when the denominator is minimized, which corresponds to maximizing the $\\sin^2$ term. The maximum value of $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$ is $1$. This occurs for the highest frequency modes resolvable on the grid, where $k \\Delta x = \\pi$.\nTherefore, the stability condition becomes:\n$$ \\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting back the definition of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis is the CFL stability condition for the Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) scheme for the one-dimensional diffusion equation. The problem asks for the largest allowable time step, which is obtained when the equality holds:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D} $$\nAny time step $\\Delta t > \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D}$ will lead to numerical instability, where errors are amplified and destroy the solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(\\Delta x)^{2}}{2D}}$$", "id": "2758463"}]}
