This exercise delves into the quantitative basis of this process, connecting the molecular architecture of a gene's promoter to the cell's macroscopic response.

This practice is fundamental for designing genetic circuits that can establish precise spatial domains.", "problem": "A morphogen controls a gene in a synthetic tissue designed for programmable self-organization, where the gene’s promoter has $n$ identical binding sites for the morphogen-activated transcription factor. The tissue is approximated as a single spatial dimension with coordinate $x \\ge 0$, and the morphogen concentration forms a fixed gradient $c(x) = c_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $c_0 > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$ are constants.

It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and requires a rigorous, step-by-step derivation. I shall therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the active fraction of the promoter, $f(c)$, as a function of the morphogen concentration, $c$. The promoter has $n$ identical and independent binding sites for the transcription factor, which we assume has a concentration proportional to the morphogen, effectively letting $c$ be the concentration of the active transcription factor. The binding of the factor to a single site is a reversible reaction governed by the law of mass action, with a dissociation constant $K_d$. For a single site, the equilibrium is $S + T \\rightleftharpoons ST$, where $S$ is the free binding site and $T$ is the transcription factor.\n\nThe dissociation constant is defined as $K_d = \\frac{[S][T]}{[ST]}$. Let the concentration of the transcription factor $[T]$ be denoted by $c$. Then, $K_d = \\frac{[S]c}{[ST]}$. The probability that a single site is occupied, which we will call $p_{\\text{bound}}$, is the ratio of the concentration of occupied sites to the total concentration of sites:\n$$ p_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[ST]}{[S] + [ST]} $$\nBy rearranging the expression for $K_d$, we have $[S] = \\frac{K_d [ST]}{c}$. Substituting this into the expression for $p_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$ p_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[ST]}{\\frac{K_d [ST]}{c} + [ST]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{c} + 1} = \\frac{c}{K_d + c} $$\nSince the $n$ sites are identical and bind independently, the probability that all $n$ sites are simultaneously occupied is the product of their individual probabilities. The promoter is defined as active only in this state. Therefore, the fraction of active promoters, $f(c)$, is:\n$$ f(c) = (p_{\\text{bound}})^n = \\left(\\frac{c}{c + K_d}\\right)^n $$\nThis is the mechanistic model for the promoter's active fraction.\n\nNext, we distinguish this from a phenomenological Hill fit. The Hill equation is a cooperative binding function, typically written as $f_{\\text{Hill}}(c) = \\frac{c^{n_H}}{K^n_H + c^{n_H}}$. Here, $n_H$ is the Hill coefficient, a parameter that quantifies the steepness or \"ultrasensitivity\" of the response, and $K$ is the concentration at which half-maximal activation is achieved. A key distinction is that the Hill equation is a phenomenological model, meaning it is formulated to fit experimental data, and its parameters ($n_H$, $K$) do not necessarily correspond to a specific physical mechanism. The parameter $n_H$ is not generally an integer and does not necessarily equal the number of binding sites. In contrast, our derived function $f(c)$ is a mechanistic model, where the parameter $n$ is a physical quantity: the exact, integer number of binding sites.\n\nWe are asked to compute the effective Hill coefficient, $n_{\\mathrm{H,eff}}$, for our mechanistic model, defined at the point of half-maximal response ($f=1/2$) as $n_{\\mathrm{H,eff}} \\equiv \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f}{1-f}\\right)\\right|_{f=1/2}$. We use the identity $\\frac{d}{d\\ln c} = c \\frac{d}{dc}$. The operand is the log-odds of activation.\nLet us first compute the derivative of the log-odds:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f}{1-f}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} (\\ln f - \\ln(1-f)) = \\frac{1}{f}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} - \\frac{1}{1-f}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(1-f)}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} $$\nNow we find $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} = c \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}c} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}c}\\left[\\left(\\frac{c}{c+K_d}\\right)^n\\right] = c \\cdot n\\left(\\frac{c}{c+K_d}\\right)^{n-1} \\left[ \\frac{(1)(c+K_d) - c(1)}{(c+K_d)^2} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} = c \\cdot n \\frac{c^{n-1}}{(c+K_d)^{n-1}} \\frac{K_d}{(c+K_d)^2} = \\frac{n c^n K_d}{(c+K_d)^{n+1}} = n \\left(\\frac{c}{c+K_d}\\right)^n \\left(\\frac{K_d}{c+K_d}\\right) = n f \\left(\\frac{K_d}{c+K_d}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $n_{\\mathrm{H,eff}}$:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H,eff}} = \\frac{1}{f(1-f)} \\left[ n f \\left(\\frac{K_d}{c+K_d}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{n}{1-f} \\left(\\frac{K_d}{c+K_d}\\right) $$\nWe evaluate this at $f(c) = 1/2$. At this point, $\\left(\\frac{c}{c+K_d}\\right)^n = 1/2$, which implies $\\frac{c}{c+K_d} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{1/n} = 2^{-1/n}$.\nThen, $\\frac{K_d}{c+K_d} = 1 - \\frac{c}{c+K_d} = 1 - 2^{-1/n}$.\nSubstituting these conditions gives:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{H,eff}} = \\frac{n}{1-1/2} (1 - 2^{-1/n}) = 2n(1-2^{-1/n}) $$\n\nThe absolute sensitivity at half-maximal input, $S_{1/2}$, is defined as $S_{1/2} \\equiv \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}c}\\right|_{f=1/2}$.\nFrom the previous calculation, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}c} = \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} = \\frac{n f}{c} (\\frac{K_d}{c+K_d})$.\nAt $f=1/2$, we have $c=c_{1/2}$, so $S_{1/2} = \\frac{n(1/2)}{c_{1/2}} (\\frac{K_d}{c_{1/2}+K_d})$.\nFrom $f(c_{1/2})=1/2$, we find the concentration $c_{1/2}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{c_{1/2}}{c_{1/2}+K_d}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{c_{1/2}}{c_{1/2}+K_d} = 2^{-1/n} \\implies c_{1/2} = (c_{1/2}+K_d)2^{-1/n} $$\n$$ c_{1/2}(1-2^{-1/n}) = K_d 2^{-1/n} \\implies c_{1/2} = K_d \\frac{2^{-1/n}}{1-2^{-1/n}} = \\frac{K_d}{2^{1/n}-1} $$\nSubstituting this concentration and the relation $\\frac{K_d}{c_{1/2}+K_d} = 1-2^{-1/n}$ into the expression for $S_{1/2}$:\n$$ S_{1/2} = \\frac{n/2}{K_d/(2^{1/n}-1)} (1-2^{-1/n}) = \\frac{n(2^{1/n}-1)}{2K_d} (1-2^{-1/n}) $$\n\nFinally, we determine the spatial position $x_{1/2}$ where activation is half-maximal. The morphogen concentration is given by the spatial gradient $c(x) = c_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. We must find the position $x_{1/2}$ such that $c(x_{1/2}) = c_{1/2}$.\n$$ c_0 \\exp(-x_{1/2}/\\lambda) = c_{1/2} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $c_{1/2}$ that we derived:\n$$ c_0 \\exp(-x_{1/2}/\\lambda) = \\frac{K_d}{2^{1/n}-1} $$\nNow we solve for $x_{1/2}$. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(c_0) - \\frac{x_{1/2}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_d}{2^{1/n}-1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{x_{1/2}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(c_0) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_d}{2^{1/n}-1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_0(2^{1/n}-1)}{K_d}\\right) $$\nMultiplying by $\\lambda$ yields the final expression for the position of half-maximal activation:\n$$ x_{1/2} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_0(2^{1/n}-1)}{K_d}\\right) $$\nThe existence of such a position $x_{1/2} \\geq 0$ requires the argument of the logarithm to be greater than or equal to $1$, i.e., $c_0(2^{1/n}-1) \\ge K_d$. This is guaranteed by the problem statement's assumption that such a position exists. The expression is dimensionally correct, as the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless (assuming $c_0$ and $K_d$ have the same units of concentration) and $\\lambda$ has units of length.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_0(2^{1/n}-1)}{K_d}\\right)}$$", "id": "2714675"}, {"introduction": "While individual cells can interpret gradients, complex patterns like stripes and spots arise from the collective behavior of an entire cell population communicating through reaction and diffusion.

The provided data are consistent and sufficient for a complete solution. We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem is structured into three parts. We shall address them in sequence.\n\nFirst, we derive the lattice-based linearized dynamics. We begin with a one-dimensional ring of $N$ cells, indexed by $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$. The concentration of species $u$ and $v$ in cell $j$ are denoted by $u_j(t)$ and $v_j(t)$. The dynamics of each cell consist of local reactions and diffusive exchange with its two nearest neighbors, $j-1$ and $j+1$ (with indices taken modulo $N$).\n\nThe diffusive flux of a species between adjacent cells is governed by Fick's first law, stating that the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. For a discrete system with cell spacing $a$, the net diffusive influx into cell $j$ for species $u$ is the sum of fluxes from its neighbors:\n$$\nJ_{u, \\text{net}} = \\kappa_u (u_{j+1} - u_j) + \\kappa_u (u_{j-1} - u_j) = \\kappa_u (u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1})\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_u$ is a coupling constant. This expression is the discrete Laplacian operator acting on $u_j$. To relate $\\kappa_u$ to the continuum diffusion coefficient $D_u$, we consider the limit where $a \\to 0$. A Taylor series expansion of $u(x \\pm a)$ around $x$ gives:\n$$\nu(x+a) - 2u(x) + u(x-a) \\approx a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nFor the discrete model to converge to the given PDE, we require $\\kappa_u a^2 (\\partial^2 u / \\partial x^2) = D_u (\\partial^2 u / \\partial x^2)$, which implies $\\kappa_u = D_u/a^2$.\n\nThe full non-linear dynamics on the lattice are thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_j}{d t} = f(u_j, v_j) + \\frac{D_u}{a^2} (u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d v_j}{d t} = g(u_j, v_j) + \\frac{D_v}{a^2} (v_{j+1} - 2v_j + v_{j-1})\n$$\nWe linearize these equations around the spatially homogeneous steady state $(u^{\\ast}, v^{\\ast})$. Let $u_j(t) = u^{\\ast} + \\delta u_j(t)$ and $v_j(t) = v^{\\ast} + \\delta v_j(t)$, where $\\delta u_j$ and $\\delta v_j$ are small perturbations. Since $f(u^{\\ast}, v^{\\ast}) = 0$ and $g(u^{\\ast}, v^{\\ast}) = 0$, the linearized system for the perturbations is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u_j\\\\ \\delta v_j\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}f_u & f_v\\\\ g_u & g_v\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u_j\\\\ \\delta v_j\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}D_u/a^2 & 0\\\\ 0 & D_v/a^2\\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u_{j+1}\\\\ \\delta v_{j+1}\\end{pmatrix} - 2\\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u_j\\\\ \\delta v_j\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u_{j-1}\\\\ \\delta v_{j-1}\\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n$$\nThe discrete nature of the spatial domain suggests seeking solutions in the form of spatial Fourier modes. We posit a solution of the form $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u_j(t) \\\\ \\delta v_j(t)\\end{pmatrix} = \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_q \\exp(i q j a) \\exp(\\sigma t)$, where $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_q$ is the mode amplitude and $\\sigma$ is the growth rate. Substituting this ansatz into the linearized system, the time derivative becomes $\\sigma \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$. The reaction term is $J \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$. The discrete diffusion operator acting on the spatial mode $\\exp(i q j a)$ yields:\n$$\n\\exp(i q (j+1) a) - 2\\exp(i q j a) + \\exp(i q (j-1) a) = \\exp(i q j a) (\\exp(i q a) - 2 + \\exp(-i q a))\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp(i q j a) (2\\cos(qa) - 2) = -2(1-\\cos(qa))\\exp(i q j a)\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $1-\\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, this becomes:\n$$\n-4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right)\\exp(i q j a)\n$$\nThe system of equations for the mode amplitudes becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_q = J \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_q - \\frac{4}{a^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix}D_u & 0\\\\ 0 & D_v\\end{pmatrix} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_q\n$$\nThis is an eigenvalue problem for the growth rate $\\sigma$. The expression multiplies the diffusion matrix, which confirms that the spatial Fourier modes diagonalize the dynamics. The eigenvalue of the discrete Laplacian operator is $-\\frac{4}{a^2}\\sin^2(\\frac{qa}{2})$. As requested, we identify this with $-\\hat{k}^2(q)$, thus proving that $\\hat{k}^2(q) = \\frac{4}{a^2}\\sin^2(\\frac{qa}{2})$.\n\nSecond, we determine the continuum band of unstable wavenumbers. In the continuum limit ($a \\to 0$, $qa \\ll 1$), we have $\\sin(\\frac{qa}{2}) \\approx \\frac{qa}{2}$, so $\\hat{k}^2(q) \\approx \\frac{4}{a^2} (\\frac{qa}{2})^2 = q^2$. The problem instructs us to replace $\\hat{k}^2(q)$ with $k^2$ and $q$ with $k$ for the continuum analysis. The growth rate $\\sigma(k)$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix:\n$$\nM_c(k) = J - k^2 D = \\begin{pmatrix}f_u - k^2 D_u & f_v\\\\ g_u & g_v - k^2 D_v\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA Turing instability requires that the homogeneous steady state is stable in the absence of diffusion ($k=0$), but unstable for some range of $k > 0$. Stability at $k=0$ requires $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J) > 0$. Using the given Jacobian $J = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\ -3 & -4\\end{pmatrix}$, we find $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = 1-4 = -3 < 0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J) = (1)(-4)-(2)(-3) = -4+6=2>0$. The condition for stability without diffusion is satisfied.\nFor $k>0$, instability arises if any eigenvalue of $M_c(k)$ has a positive real part. The eigenvalues satisfy $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(M_c(k))\\lambda + \\mathrm{Det}(M_c(k)) = 0$.\nThe trace is $\\mathrm{Tr}(M_c(k)) = \\mathrm{Tr}(J) - k^2(D_u+D_v) = -3 - k^2(1+16) = -3 - 17k^2$. Since $k^2 \\ge 0$, $\\mathrm{Tr}(M_c(k))$ is always negative. If the trace (sum of eigenvalues) is negative, at least one eigenvalue must have a negative real part. For an eigenvalue to have a positive real part, the two eigenvalues must be real and have opposite signs. This occurs if and only if their product, the determinant, is negative. Thus, the condition for instability is $\\mathrm{Det}(M_c(k)) < 0$.\nThe determinant is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(M_c(k)) = (f_u - k^2 D_u)(g_v - k^2 D_v) - f_v g_u = D_u D_v (k^2)^2 - (f_u D_v + g_v D_u) k^2 + \\mathrm{Det}(J)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $f_u=1, g_v=-4, \\mathrm{Det}(J)=2, D_u=1, D_v=16$:\n$$\nf_u D_v + g_v D_u = (1)(16) + (-4)(1) = 12\n$$\n$$\nD_u D_v = (1)(16) = 16\n$$\nThe determinant becomes a quadratic function of $k^2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(M_c(k)) = 16(k^2)^2 - 12k^2 + 2\n$$\nWe seek the range of $k^2$ where $16(k^2)^2 - 12k^2 + 2 < 0$. First, we find the roots of $8(k^2)^2 - 6k^2 + 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula for $y=k^2$:\n$$\ny = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(8)(1)}}{2(8)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 32}}{16} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2}{16}\n$$\nThe roots are $k^2 = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $k^2 = \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the quadratic in $k^2$ is an upward-opening parabola, the expression is negative between the roots. The instability condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} < k^2 < \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe continuum band of unstable wavenumbers is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} < k < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThird, we find the minimal domain size $N$ in cell diameters. We are given $a=1$. The domain size is $L = Na = N$.\nCondition 1: An allowed discrete mode must have a stripe spacing (wavelength) of $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{target}} = 12$. The allowed wavenumbers on the ring are $q_m = \\frac{2\\pi m}{Na}$, and the corresponding wavelengths are $\\lambda_m = \\frac{2\\pi}{q_m} = \\frac{Na}{m}$. With $a=1$ and $\\lambda_m=12$, this gives $12 = \\frac{N}{m}$, or $N = 12m$ for some positive integer $m$. We seek the minimal integer $N$, so we must find the minimal valid $m \\geq 1$.\n\nCondition 2: The mode corresponding to $\\lambda=12$ must be unstable in the discrete system. The instability condition for the discrete system is analogous to the continuum case, with $k^2$ replaced by $\\hat{k}^2(q)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} < \\hat{k}^2(q_m) < \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe mode with wavelength $\\lambda_m = 12$ has a wavenumber $q_m = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_m} = \\frac{2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. Note that this wavenumber is independent of $N$ or $m$, as it is determined solely by the target wavelength. We must evaluate $\\hat{k}^2(q)$ at this specific wavenumber. With $a=1$:\n$$\n\\hat{k}^2(\\pi/6) = 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{(\\pi/6) \\cdot 1}{2}\\right) = 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)\n$$\nWe use the half-angle identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$:\n$$\n\\hat{k}^2(\\pi/6) = 4 \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\pi/6)}{2} \\right) = 2(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 2 - \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nNow we must check if this value lies within the instability interval $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} < 2 - \\sqrt{3} < \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nWe verify each inequality:\nIs $2 - \\sqrt{3} > \\frac{1}{4}$? This is equivalent to $1.75 > \\sqrt{3}$, or $(\\frac{7}{4})^2 > 3$, which is $\\frac{49}{16} > 3$, or $49 > 48$. This is true.\nIs $2 - \\sqrt{3} < \\frac{1}{2}$? This is equivalent to $1.5 < \\sqrt{3}$, or $(\\frac{3}{2})^2 < 3$, which is $\\frac{9}{4} < 3$, or $9 < 12$. This is also true.\nSince $2 - \\sqrt{3}$ is in the unstable range, any discrete system with size $N = 12m$ will support an unstable mode with the target wavelength of $12$. The problem asks for the minimal integer $N$. This corresponds to the smallest possible positive integer value of $m$, which is $m=1$.\nFor $m=1$, the minimal domain size is $N = 12 \\times 1 = 12$ cell diameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2714744"}, {"introduction": "Biological development rarely occurs on a flat sheet; tissues invaginate, proliferate, and deform into the complex three-dimensional geometries of organs.

The problem is valid.\n\nSolution:\n\nPart 1: First unstable spherical harmonic on a sphere.\nThe temporal evolution of small perturbations $\\delta\\mathbf{w}$ about the steady state $(u^{*},v^{*})$ is governed by the linearized system $\\partial_{t} \\delta\\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{J} + \\mathbf{D} \\Delta_{\\mathcal{S}}) \\delta\\mathbf{w}$. On a sphere of radius $R$, the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{\\mathcal{S}}$ are the spherical harmonics $Y_{\\ell}^{m}$, with corresponding eigenvalues $-\\ell(\\ell+1)/R^2$. By expanding perturbations in this basis, $\\delta\\mathbf{w} \\propto \\exp(\\sigma_{\\ell} t) Y_{\\ell}^{m}$, the growth rates $\\sigma_{\\ell}$ are found as the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell} = \\mathbf{J} - k_{\\ell}^{2}\\mathbf{D}$, where $k_{\\ell}^{2} = \\ell(\\ell+1)/R^{2}$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix and diffusion tensor are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & 1.2 \\\\ -1.5 & -1.0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 30 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a Turing instability, one of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell}$ must have a positive real part. The eigenvalues $\\sigma$ satisfy the characteristic equation $\\sigma^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell})\\sigma + \\det(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell}) = 0$.\nThe trace is $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell}) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) - k_{\\ell}^{2}(D_u + D_v) = -0.5 - k_{\\ell}^{2}(1 + 30) = -0.5 - 31k_{\\ell}^{2}$. Since $k_{\\ell}^{2} \\ge 0$, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell})$ is always negative. For an eigenvalue to have a positive real part under this condition, the product of the eigenvalues, $\\det(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell})$, must be negative.\nThe determinant is given by:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell}) = \\det(\\mathbf{J}) - (f_u D_v + g_v D_u)k_{\\ell}^{2} + (D_u D_v)(k_{\\ell}^{2})^2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = 1.3$\n$f_u D_v + g_v D_u = (0.5)(30) + (-1.0)(1) = 14$\n$D_u D_v = (1)(30) = 30$\nThe instability condition is $\\det(\\mathbf{M}_{\\ell}) = 30(k_{\\ell}^{2})^{2} - 14k_{\\ell}^{2} + 1.3 < 0$.\nSolving the quadratic equation $30x^2 - 14x + 1.3 = 0$ for $x=k_{\\ell}^{2}$ gives the roots:\n$$\nx = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4(30)(1.3)}}{2(30)} = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{196 - 156}}{60} = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{40}}{60} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{10}}{30}\n$$\nThe parabola opens upwards, so the inequality holds for $k_{\\ell}^{2}$ between the roots:\n$k_{\\ell}^{2} \\in \\left(\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{10}}{30}, \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{10}}{30}\\right)$.\nNumerically, this range is approximately $(0.1279, 0.3387)$.\nOn the sphere, $R=5$, so $k_{\\ell}^{2} = \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{R^2} = \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{25}$. We seek the smallest integer $\\ell \\ge 1$ such that $k_{\\ell}^{2}$ falls in the unstable range.\nThis requires $0.1279 < \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{25} < 0.3387$, which implies $3.1975 < \\ell(\\ell+1) < 8.4675$.\nWe check integer values of $\\ell$:\nFor $\\ell=1$, $\\ell(\\ell+1) = 2$, which is not in the range.\nFor $\\ell=2$, $\\ell(\\ell+1) = 6$, which is in the range.\nFor $\\ell=3$, $\\ell(\\ell+1) = 12$, which is not in the range.\nThus, the smallest integer degree for which an instability occurs is $\\ell_{*} = 2$.\n\nPart 2: Wavelength adaptation on a cone.\nFirst, we find the planar wavenumber $k_*$ that maximizes the dominant growth rate $\\lambda_{+}(q)$. This is the largest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{M}_q = \\mathbf{J} - q^2\\mathbf{D}$.
