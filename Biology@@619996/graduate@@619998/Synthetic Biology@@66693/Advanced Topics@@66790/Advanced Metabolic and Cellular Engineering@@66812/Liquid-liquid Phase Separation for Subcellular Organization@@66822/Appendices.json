Both IDRs have identical amino acid composition and length but differ in sequence patterning. Consider the following model and assumptions.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Associative polymer perspective (stickers-and-spacers): Cohesion arises from specific, reversible noncovalent interactions among stickers (for example, aromatic residues and cation–pi contacts) embedded in flexible spacers. Phase separation occurs when inter-chain network connectivity percolates and the free energy of mixing is lowered by cohesive interactions sufficiently to overcome mixing entropy.\n- Polymer solution thermodynamics (Flory-Huggins mean-field reasoning): The saturation concentration, denoted by $c_{sat}$, decreases as the effective cohesive interaction density and network connectivity increase, because the chemical potential in the dilute phase is lowered by attractive inter-chain contacts.\n- Gelation/percolation criterion (Flory-Stockmayer reasoning): For reversible networks, the approach to percolation depends on the effective valence of independent inter-chain bonds per chain; loops and intramolecular self-association do not contribute to connectivity.\n- Electrostatics (Debye-Hückel screening): In a monovalent electrolyte of ionic strength $I$, the Debye length scales as $\\lambda_{D} \\propto I^{-1/2}$, so at higher salt, screened electrostatic interactions are shorter-ranged. Oppositely charged patches can drive bridging between chains, whereas mixed charges along a chain reduce long-range intrachain compaction.\n\nSystem details:\n- Both IDRs have length $N = 200$ residues and identical composition: fraction of tyrosine $f_{Y} = 0.15$, arginine $f_{R} = 0.10$, and acidic residues (aspartate plus glutamate) $f_{D+E} = 0.10$; the remainder are polar uncharged residues.\n- Temperature is fixed near room temperature, salt is monovalent at $c_{s} = 150$ mM (so $\\lambda_{D} \\approx 0.8$ nm), and pH ensures that acidic residues are deprotonated and arginine residues are protonated.\n- IDR-U (uniform): Aromatic residues and charges are uniformly interspersed such that no two tyrosines are adjacent and positive/negative residues are locally mixed without extended blocks. This yields many spatially separated sticker sites and suppresses long-range intrachain electrostatic compaction.\n- IDR-P (patterned): Aromatic stickers are clustered into contiguous triads separated by flexible spacers of approximately $10$ residues; charges are segregated into alternating blocks of $5$ positive followed by $5$ negative residues, repeated along the chain (high charge segregation). This arrangement can foster intra-chain loop formation among sticker clusters and intra-chain charge neutralization, while also enabling patch-to-patch electrostatic bridging between different chains.\n\nQuestion: Under the specified conditions, which IDR is expected to have the lower saturation concentration $c_{sat}$ for homotypic LLPS, and why?\n\nChoose the best answer.\n\nA. IDR-U has lower $c_{sat}$ because uniform sticker spacing maximizes the number of independent inter-chain contacts (effective valence) and mixed charges reduce intrachain compaction, increasing accessible inter-chain bridging.\n\nB. IDR-P has lower $c_{sat}$ because clustered stickers produce stronger multipoint avidity and segregated charge blocks promote inter-chain electrostatic bridging that dominates over any intrachain effects at $c_{s} = 150$ mM.\n\nC. Both have the same $c_{sat}$ because composition alone sets the cohesive energy density; patterning cannot change $c_{sat}$ when the number of stickers and charges is fixed.\n\nD.

There is insufficient information because the outcome depends only on the absolute binding free energy of sticker pairs, which was not provided, not on sequence patterning.", "solution": "The problem requires a comparison of the saturation concentration, $c_{sat}$, for homotypic liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), IDR-U and IDR-P. The two IDRs have identical length ($N=200$) and amino acid composition but differ in their sequence patterning. According to the provided principles, a lower $c_{sat}$ indicates a stronger propensity to phase separate, which is driven by maximizing effective inter-chain connectivity and cohesive interactions. The analysis must consider the interplay between sticker-driven cohesion and electrostatic interactions as modulated by sequence pattern.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fundamental principles given in the problem statement that will govern the analysis.\n$1$. The saturation concentration, $c_{sat}$, decreases as the effective cohesive interaction density and inter-chain network connectivity increase (Flory-Huggins reasoning).\n$2$. The formation of an extensive network, a prerequisite for phase separation, depends on the effective valence of a chain, defined as the number of independent *inter-chain* bonds it can form. *Intra-chain* bonds (loops) do not contribute to network percolation and are thus considered non-productive for LLPS (Flory-Stockmayer reasoning).\n$3$. The system is under physiological salt conditions ($c_{s} = 150$ mM), where electrostatic interactions are screened and short-ranged, with a Debye length of approximately $\\lambda_{D} \\approx 0.8$ nm.\n\nNow, we analyze each IDR in the context of these principles.\n\n**Analysis of IDR-U (Uniform Pattern)**\n- **Sticker Distribution:** The aromatic stickers (tyrosine, Y) are uniformly spaced. This spatial distribution statistically disfavors the formation of stable, multi-sticker *intra-chain* loops. A sticker on a given chain is more likely to encounter and bind to a sticker on a *different* chain rather than another sticker far down its own sequence. This maximizes the number of stickers available for inter-chain interactions, leading to a high effective valence for network formation.\n- **Charge Distribution:** The positive (arginine, R) and negative (aspartate/glutamate, D/E) charges are locally mixed. At $c_s = 150$ mM, the short-range screening prevents strong, long-range electrostatic attractions or repulsions. The local charge neutrality results in weak net electrostatic forces within the chain, which, as the problem states, \"suppresses long-range intrachain electrostatic compaction.\" The polymer chain is expected to adopt a more expanded, random coil-like conformation. This expanded state increases the solvent exposure of the stickers and reduces steric hindrance, making them more accessible for forming *inter-chain* contacts.\n\nIn summary, the uniform patterning of IDR-U promotes an expanded chain conformation where stickers are readily available to form an extensive inter-chain network. This configuration is highly favorable for LLPS, suggesting a low $c_{sat}$.\n\n**Analysis of IDR-P (Patterned/Blocky Pattern)**\n- **Sticker Distribution:** Stickers are clustered into \"triads\". A triad represents a patch of high cohesiveness. The presence of multiple such patches along a single chain increases the probability of *intra-chain* association between them, forming stable loops. Each such intra-chain interaction sequesters stickers that could have otherwise participated in inter-chain bonding, thereby reducing the chain's effective valence for network formation.\n- **Charge Distribution:** Charges are segregated into alternating blocks of positive and negative residues. This creates polyelectrolyte patches. The problem notes this can lead to two competing effects: inter-chain bridging between patches of opposite charge and intra-chain neutralization (compaction) between adjacent blocks on the same chain. Given that the blocks are adjacent, intra-chain association is kinetically and entropically favored over inter-chain association, which requires two separate chains to diffuse and align correctly. This intra-chain collapse would make the chain more compact, sterically shielding the sticker clusters and further reducing their availability for inter-chain interactions.\n\nIn summary, the blocky patterning of IDR-P strongly promotes non-productive *intra-chain* interactions, both through sticker clustering and charge segregation. These interactions reduce the effective valence and steric accessibility of cohesive sites, hindering the formation of a percolated inter-chain network. This configuration is less favorable for LLPS, which implies a higher $c_{sat}$ compared to IDR-U.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy maximizing the potential for inter-chain contacts (high effective valence) and minimizing non-productive intra-chain collapse, IDR-U is better designed to form the percolated network required for LLPS. Therefore, IDR-U is expected to have a lower saturation concentration, $c_{sat}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. IDR-U has lower $c_{sat}$ because uniform sticker spacing maximizes the number of independent inter-chain contacts (effective valence) and mixed charges reduce intrachain compaction, increasing accessible inter-chain bridging.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. It correctly identifies that IDR-U has a lower $c_{sat}$. The reasoning provided is sound:\n$1$. Uniform sticker spacing maximizes effective valence by minimizing intra-chain looping.\n$2$. Mixed charges lead to a more expanded chain (less intra-chain compaction), which increases the accessibility of stickers for inter-chain contacts.\nThe logic is consistent with all the provided theoretical principles. **Correct**.\n\n**B. IDR-P has lower $c_{sat}$ because clustered stickers produce stronger multipoint avidity and segregated charge blocks promote inter-chain electrostatic bridging that dominates over any intrachain effects at $c_{s} = 150$ mM.**\nThis option incorrectly asserts that IDR-P has a lower $c_{sat}$. While clustered stickers do have a higher binding avidity per patch, this option fails to account for the high probability that these strong interactions will be \"wasted\" on forming intra-chain loops. It makes the unsubstantiated claim that inter-chain effects \"dominate\" over intra-chain effects for the charge blocks, which contradicts the likely kinetic and entropic favorability of interactions between adjacent blocks on the same chain. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both have the same $c_{sat}$ because composition alone sets the cohesive energy density; patterning cannot change $c_{sat}$ when the number of stickers and charges is fixed.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It dismisses the role of sequence patterning, which is the central concept being tested. The provided Flory-Stockmayer principle explicitly states that network formation depends on the number of *inter-chain* bonds, a quantity that is highly sensitive to the spatial arrangement (patterning) of stickers and charges. Composition alone is insufficient to determine phase behavior. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. They have comparable $c_{sat}$ at $c_{s} = 150$ mM, but at lower salt IDR-P will have lower $c_{sat}$; therefore at the stated salt they are effectively indistinguishable.**\nThis option evades the question by speculating on behavior at a different salt concentration. The physics of the system at $c_s = 150$ mM, as analyzed above, points to a clear distinction between IDR-U and IDR-P. The claim that they are \"indistinguishable\" at the specified condition is unsubstantiated and contradicts a careful application of the provided principles. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. There is insufficient information because the outcome depends only on the absolute binding free energy of sticker pairs, which was not provided, not on sequence patterning.**\nThis option repeats the fallacy of option C. It incorrectly claims that sequence patterning is irrelevant. The problem is not about calculating an absolute value for $c_{sat}$, but about comparing the relative propensities of two systems to phase separate. This comparison can be made by reasoning about how sequence patterning affects the balance between productive inter-chain and non-productive intra-chain interactions, as guided by the provided biophysical framework. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2748584"}, {"introduction": "Once a system enters the two-phase region of its phase diagram, a crucial next step is to quantify the equilibrium state.
