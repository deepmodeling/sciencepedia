This practice guides you through the calculation of the minimum number of transporter molecules required, building a direct bridge from the transporter's intrinsic kinetic properties, $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $K_{m}$, to the required in vivo expression level. Mastering this quantitative skill is essential for designing robust and safe metabolic pathways. [@problem_id:2609233]", "problem": "An engineered bacterium synthesizes an intracellular metabolic intermediate $X$ that is toxic if its cytosolic concentration exceeds a threshold $C^{\\star}$. To mitigate accumulation, a heterologously expressed membrane exporter $T$ specific for $X$ is installed. The transporter exhibits single-site saturation kinetics with respect to the intracellular concentration of $X$, characterized by a catalytic turnover number $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and a Michaelis constant $K_{m}$, and the extracellular $X$ concentration remains negligible relative to intracellular values. Assume the cytosol is well mixed so that the concentration at the membrane equals the bulk intracellular concentration.\n\nUse the following data:\n- Intracellular production rate per cell of $X$: $r_{\\text{prod}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Michaelis constant: $K_{m} = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- Target maximum intracellular concentration not to be exceeded at steady state: $C^{\\star} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- Transporter catalytic turnover number: $k_{\\text{cat}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ per monomeric transporter.\n- Avogadro constant: $N_{A} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from a steady-state mass balance and the standard Michaelis–Menten form for a transporter acting on the intracellular substrate concentration, derive an expression for the minimal transporter copy number per cell, $n_{\\min}$, needed to ensure that the steady-state intracellular concentration is at most $C^{\\star}$.

The objective is to find the minimal integer copy number of transporters per cell, $n_{\\min}$, to maintain the steady-state concentration $C$ at or below $C^{\\star}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of enzyme kinetics (Michaelis–Menten model) and mass balance, which are fundamental to metabolic engineering and biochemistry. The given parameters are physically and biologically plausible for a bacterial cell. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to establish a unique relationship between the number of transporters and the steady-state substrate concentration. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions of a well-mixed cytosol and negligible extracellular product concentration are standard and appropriate simplifications for this type of problem, rendering it self-contained and solvable without requiring unspecified information such as cell volume. The problem is free of contradictions, pseudoscience, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe core of the problem lies in establishing a mass balance for the metabolic intermediate $X$ at steady state. At steady state, the rate of production of $X$ within the cell must equal the rate of its export from the cell. Let $J_{\\text{prod}}$ be the production rate and $J_{\\text{export}}$ be the export rate, both in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe production rate is given directly:\n$$J_{\\text{prod}} = r_{\\text{prod}}$$\n\nThe export is mediated by $n_T$ transporter molecules. The rate of transport for a single transporter molecule is described by Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The turnover number, $k_{\\text{cat}}$, is the maximum number of substrate molecules a single transporter can process per unit time. The rate for one transporter molecule (in molecules per second) is:\n$$v_{\\text{single}} = k_{\\text{cat}} \\frac{C}{K_m + C}$$\nwhere $C$ is the intracellular concentration of $X$.\n\nWith $n_T$ transporter molecules in the cell, the total export rate in molecules per second is:\n$$J_{\\text{export, molecules}} = n_T \\cdot v_{\\text{single}} = n_T k_{\\text{cat}} \\frac{C}{K_m + C}$$\n\nTo express this rate in the same units as $r_{\\text{prod}}$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), we must divide by the Avogadro constant, $N_A$:\n$$J_{\\text{export}} = \\frac{J_{\\text{export, molecules}}}{N_A} = \\frac{n_T k_{\\text{cat}}}{N_A} \\frac{C}{K_m + C}$$\n\nAt steady state, $J_{\\text{prod}} = J_{\\text{export}}$:\n$$r_{\\text{prod}} = \\frac{n_T k_{\\text{cat}}}{N_A} \\frac{C}{K_m + C}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the minimal number of transporters, $n_{\\min}$, required to ensure that the steady-state concentration $C$ does not exceed a threshold $C^{\\star}$, i.e., $C \\le C^{\\star}$. We first solve the steady-state equation for $n_T$:\n$$n_T = \\frac{r_{\\text{prod}} N_A (K_m + C)}{k_{\\text{cat}} C}$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$n_T(C) = \\frac{r_{\\text{prod}} N_A}{k_{\\text{cat}}} \\left(1 + \\frac{K_m}{C}\\right)$$\n\nFrom this expression, it is clear that $n_T$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the steady-state concentration $C$. A higher concentration $C$ (meaning the transporters are more saturated and thus more efficient) requires fewer transporters to balance the same production rate. Conversely, to maintain a lower concentration $C$, a larger number of transporters is required.\n\nTo satisfy the condition $C \\le C^{\\star}$, we must have a number of transporters $n_T$ that is greater than or equal to the number required to maintain the concentration at the maximum allowed value, $C^{\\star}$.\n$$n_T \\ge n_T(C^{\\star})$$\nTherefore, the minimal number of transporters, $n_{\\min}$, is the value calculated at $C = C^{\\star}$:\n$$n_{\\min} = \\frac{r_{\\text{prod}} N_A (K_m + C^{\\star})}{k_{\\text{cat}} C^{\\star}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. It is important to ensure that $K_m$ and $C^{\\star}$ are in the same units, which they are ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), so their ratio is dimensionless.\n- $r_{\\text{prod}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{cat}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $K_m = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $C^{\\star} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\n$$n_{\\min} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23})}{100} \\frac{(25 + 100)}{100}$$\nThe concentrations can be used directly as their units cancel out in the fraction.\n$$n_{\\min} = \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{4}}{100} \\times \\frac{125}{100}$$\n$$n_{\\min} = (6.022 \\times 10^{2}) \\times 1.25$$\n$$n_{\\min} = 602.2 \\times 1.25$$\n$$n_{\\min} = 752.75$$\n\nThe problem requires the minimal *integer* number of transporter molecules.

It constitutes a well-posed linear programming problem grounded in the established principles of Flux Balance Analysis, a standard methodology in systems biology. The problem is self-contained, its parameters are physically and mathematically consistent, and it is free of ambiguity. We now proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the biomass synthesis flux, $v_2$, subject to a set of linear constraints. The complete formulation of this linear program is as follows:\n\nMaximize:\n$$Z = v_2$$\n\nSubject to:\n1.  Mass balance at steady-state ($S v = 0$):\n    $$v_1 - v_2 - v_3 = 0$$\n    $$v_3 - v_4 = 0$$\n2.  Flux bounds (irreversibility and transporter capacities):\n    $$0 \\le v_1 \\le u_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n    $$v_2 \\ge 0$$\n    $$v_3 \\ge 0$$\n    $$0 \\le v_4 \\le u_{\\mathrm{out}}$$\n3.  Growth-coupling constraint:\n    $$v_3 \\ge \\alpha v_2$$\n\nwhere $v = [v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4]^\\top$ is the vector of reaction fluxes, $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the substrate uptake capacity, $u_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the product export capacity, and $\\alpha$ is the coupling coefficient.\n\nThis system of constraints can be simplified. From the product balance equation, $v_3 = v_4$. This allows us to replace the constraint on $v_4$ with an equivalent constraint on $v_3$:\n$$0 \\le v_3 \\le u_{\\mathrm{out}}$$\nFrom the substrate balance equation, $v_1 = v_2 + v_3$. Since $v_2 \\ge 0$ and $v_3 \\ge 0$, the lower bound $v_1 \\ge 0$ is automatically satisfied. The upper bound on $v_1$ translates to a constraint on the sum of $v_2$ and $v_3$:\n$$v_2 + v_3 \\le u_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThe problem is thus reduced to maximizing $v_2$ over the variables $v_2$ and $v_3$, subject to a simplified set of inequalities:\n$$v_2 + v_3 \\le u_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n$$v_3 \\le u_{\\mathrm{out}}$$\n$$v_3 \\ge \\alpha v_2$$\n$$v_2 \\ge 0, v_3 \\ge 0$$\n\nTo maximize $v_2$, we must analyze these constraints. The first inequality, $v_2 \\le u_{\\mathrm{in}} - v_3$, indicates that for a larger $v_2$, $v_3$ must be made as small as possible. The growth-coupling constraint, $v_3 \\ge \\alpha v_2$, provides a lower bound for $v_3$ that is proportional to $v_2$. As we seek to maximize $v_2$, the optimal solution must lie on the boundary of the feasible region where this constraint is active, i.e., at the minimum permissible value of $v_3$ for a given $v_2$. Therefore, at the optimum, we have:\n$$v_3^\\star = \\alpha v_2^\\star$$\nSubstituting this into the remaining inequalities gives us direct bounds on $v_2$:\n1.  From $v_2 + v_3 \\le u_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n    $$v_2(1 + \\alpha) \\le u_{\\mathrm{in}} \\implies v_2 \\le \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1 + \\alpha}$$\n    This bound represents the case where growth is limited by the total substrate uptake capacity.\n2.  From $v_3 \\le u_{\\mathrm{out}}$ (assuming $\\alpha > 0$ as is true for all test cases):\n    $$\\alpha v_2 \\le u_{\\mathrm{out}} \\implies v_2 \\le \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{out}}}{\\alpha}$$\n    This bound represents the case where growth is limited by the cell's capacity to export the coupled product.\n\nSince $v_2$ must satisfy both inequalities, the maximal value for $v_2$ is the most restrictive of these two bounds. The optimal biomass flux $v_2^\\star$ is therefore:\n$$v_2^\\star = \\min\\left(\\frac{u_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1 + \\alpha}, \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{out}}}{\\alpha}\\right)$$\nThe corresponding optimal product formation flux is $v_3^\\star = \\alpha v_2^\\star$.\n\nWe now apply this analytical solution to each parameter set.

All required data, including the stoichiometric matrix, standard Gibbs energies, constants, and physiological bounds, are provided. The problem is well-posed, internally consistent, scientifically plausible, and directly relevant to the topic of metabolic bottleneck analysis. No ambiguities, contradictions, or factual errors are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for a three-part analysis: a stoichiometric feasibility study (FBA), a thermodynamic feasibility study, and an evaluation of proposed interventions to reconcile any discrepancy.\n\n**Task 1: Stoichiometric Feasibility (FBA)**\nThe steady-state condition is $S\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{v} = [v_{\\text{in}}, v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}]^\\top$.\nThe system of linear equations is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n+1 \\cdot v_{\\text{in}} - 1 \\cdot v_{1} = 0 \\\\\n+1 \\cdot v_{1} - 1 \\cdot v_{2} = 0 \\\\\n+1 \\cdot v_{2} - 1 \\cdot v_{3} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis yields the relationship $v_{\\text{in}} = v_{1} = v_{2} = v_{3}$.\nTo obtain a nonzero flux to the product $P_{\\text{ext}}$, we must have $v_{3} > 0$. Let $v_{3} = v$ for some $v > 0$. This implies a steady-state flux vector $\\mathbf{v} = [v, v, v, v]^\\top$. All reactions are specified as irreversible in the forward direction except for $R_2$. A flux vector with all positive components is consistent with the reaction directions. The uptake flux $v_{\\text{in}}$ is unbounded from above. Therefore, any flux vector $\\mathbf{v} = [v, v, v, v]^\\top$ with $v > 0$ is a valid solution in the FBA framework.\n**Conclusion for Task 1:** FBA alone can admit a nonzero flux to $P_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\n**Task 2: Thermodynamic Feasibility**\nFor the pathway to operate in the forward direction, all reactions must have a non-positive Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G_{j} \\leq 0$). We examine the reaction $R_2$, which has a large positive standard Gibbs energy.\nThe reaction is $R_{2}: Y \\rightleftharpoons Z$. The Gibbs energy change is $\\Delta G_{2} = \\Delta G_{2}^{\\circ\\prime} + RT \\ln([Z]/[Y])$.\nFor a forward flux $v_{2} > 0$, we require $\\Delta G_{2} \\leq 0$:\n$$ +25\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} + (2.478\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq 0 $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq -\\frac{25}{2.478} \\approx -10.089 $$\n$$ \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\leq e^{-10.089} \\approx 4.15 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis inequality specifies the required ratio of product to substrate concentration for the reaction to be spontaneous in the forward direction.\nWe must now verify if this ratio is attainable within the given physiological concentration bounds: $[Y] \\in [10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}, 10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}]$ and $[Z] \\in [10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}, 10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}]$.\nTo minimize the ratio $[Z]/[Y]$, we must select the minimum possible concentration of $Z$ and the maximum possible concentration of $Y$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right)_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{[Z]_{\\text{min}}}{[Y]_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}}{10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}} = 10^{-4} $$\nComparing the minimum achievable ratio with the required ratio:\nThe minimum achievable ratio is $10^{-4} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$. The required ratio is $\\leq 4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nSince $1 \\times 10^{-4} > 4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$, the condition for thermodynamic feasibility can never be met. The minimum possible value for $\\Delta G_2$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{2, \\text{min}} = 25 + 2.478 \\ln(10^{-4}) \\approx 25 - 22.82 = +2.18\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nSince $\\Delta G_{2, \\text{min}} > 0$, the forward reaction $Y \\rightarrow Z$ is thermodynamically forbidden under all possible concentration values within the specified bounds.\n**Conclusion for Task 2:** $R_2$ constitutes a severe thermodynamic bottleneck. A nonzero forward flux is thermodynamically infeasible, which contradicts the FBA result.\n\n**Task 3: Evaluation of Interventions**\nWe evaluate each option for its ability to make $v_3 > 0$ feasible under both stoichiometry and thermodynamics, which requires resolving the thermodynamic infeasibility of $R_2$.\n\n**A. Replace $R_{2}$ with an ATP-coupled step.**\nThe new reaction is $Y + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow Z + \\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$. The standard Gibbs energy is the sum of the individual reactions:\n$$ \\Delta G_{2', \\text{new}}^{\\circ\\prime} = \\Delta G_{2}^{\\circ\\prime} + \\Delta G_{\\text{hydrolysis}}^{\\circ\\prime} = +25\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} + (-30.5\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) = -5.5\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe new standard Gibbs energy is negative. The feasibility condition is $\\Delta G_{2'} \\leq 0$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{2'} = -5.5 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z][\\text{ADP}][\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}]}{[Y][\\text{ATP}]}\\right) \\leq 0 $$\nAssuming for simplicity that the cellular energy charge term $\\frac{[\\text{ADP}][\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}]}{[\\text{ATP}]}$ does not prevent feasibility, the condition on the metabolite concentrations is significantly relaxed. If we assume the energy charge term is unity for analysis, we need:\n$$ -5.5 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq 0 \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq \\frac{5.5}{2.478} \\approx 2.22 \\implies \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\leq 9.2 $$\nThe achievable range for $[Z]/[Y]$ is $[10^{-4}, 10^4]$. The condition $[Z]/[Y] \\leq 9.2$ can be satisfied for a wide range of concentrations. Thus, ATP coupling makes the reaction thermodynamically feasible.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Overexpress the enzyme catalyzing $R_{2}$.**\nEnzymes are biological catalysts. They increase the rate at which a reaction approaches equilibrium by lowering the activation energy. However, they do not alter the equilibrium constant or the overall Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G$) of the reaction. Since reaction $R_2$ is thermodynamically forbidden ($\\Delta G_2 > 0$), increasing the enzyme concentration will not make it spontaneous.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Add a high-capacity exporter for $Z$ and sequestration for $Y$.**\nThis intervention alters the achievable concentrations to $[Z] \\approx 10^{-8}\\,\\text{M}$ and $[Y] \\approx 10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}$. We must check if the original thermodynamic constraint for $R_2$ is satisfied under these new conditions. The new concentration ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\approx \\frac{10^{-8}\\,\\text{M}}{10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}} = 10^{-6} $$\nThe condition for feasibility remains $[Z]/[Y] \\leq 4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nSince $10^{-6} < 4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$, the condition is now satisfied. The Gibbs energy under these conditions is:\n$$ \\Delta G_2 = 25 + 2.478 \\ln(10^{-6}) \\approx 25 + 2.478(-13.82) = 25 - 34.24 \\approx -9.24\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nWith $\\Delta G_2 < 0$, the reaction becomes feasible.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. Impose a positive lower bound $v_{2} \\geq 1$ in FBA.**\nThis is an artificial modification of the mathematical model. Imposing a constraint on a flux variable in a computational model does not alter the underlying biophysical laws governing the system. The reaction remains thermodynamically forbidden, meaning a flux of $v_2 \\ge 1$ is physically impossible. This intervention produces a physically meaningless FBA solution and does not resolve the actual bottleneck.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Swap the enzyme for a variant with $\\Delta G_{2}^{\\circ\\prime}$ decreased by $10\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.**\nThis intervention, via protein engineering, changes the standard Gibbs energy of the reaction. The new value is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{2, \\text{new}}^{\\circ\\prime} = +25\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} - 10\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = +15\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe new feasibility condition is $\\Delta G_2 \\leq 0$:\n$$ +15 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq 0 \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq -\\frac{15}{2.478} \\approx -6.053 $$\n$$ \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\leq e^{-6.053} \\approx 2.35 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe minimum achievable ratio with the original concentration bounds is $([Z]/[Y])_{\\text{min}} = 10^{-4}$.\nSince $10^{-4} < 2.35 \\times 10^{-3}$, there exists a range of achievable concentrations (specifically, when $[Z]/[Y] \\leq 2.35 \\times 10^{-3}$) where the reaction is thermodynamically feasible. For instance, at the minimum ratio:\n$$ \\Delta G_2 = 15 + 2.478 \\ln(10^{-4}) \\approx 15 - 22.82 = -7.82\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThis intervention makes the reaction feasible.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2745889"}]}
