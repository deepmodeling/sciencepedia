The parameters provided are physically realistic for a bacterial system. The derivation of the growth rate $\\mu$ proceeds by applying the given fundamental bases in a logical sequence.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between growth rate $\\mu$ and the allocation of ribosomes. According to Basis 5, the growth rate is proportional to the number of ribosomes translating native proteins, denoted as $R_{\\mathrm{native}}$. We can write this as $\\mu = C \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{native}}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality. Under conditions of no heterologous expression ($N=0$), the growth rate is $\\mu_0$, and the number of native translating ribosomes is $R_{\\mathrm{native},0}$. From Basis 4 (ribosome conservation), $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_f^* + R_{\\mathrm{native},0}$, which gives $R_{\\mathrm{native},0} = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^*$. The constant $C$ can thus be determined: $C = \\frac{\\mu_0}{R_{\\mathrm{native},0}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^*}$. The general expression for the growth rate is therefore:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mu_0 \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{native}}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^*}\n$$\nWhen heterologous protein is expressed, ribosomes are partitioned between native and heterologous transcripts. The conservation equation (Basis 4) is $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_f^* + R_{\\mathrm{native}} + R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}$ is the number of ribosomes translating the heterologous enzyme. From this, we find $R_{\\mathrm{native}} = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^* - R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}$. Substituting this into the growth rate equation yields:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mu_0 \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^* - R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^*} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_f^*}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding an expression for $R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}$.\n\nThe number of ribosomes engaged in translating heterologous mRNA, $R_{\\mathrm{heterologous}}$, can be determined using a steady-state argument analogous to Little's Law. It is the product of the total rate at which ribosomes initiate translation on heterologous transcripts, $J_{\\mathrm{init,total}}$, and the average time a single ribosome spends translating one polypeptide, $\\tau$.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{heterologous}} = J_{\\mathrm{init,total}} \\cdot \\tau\n$$\nFrom Basis 3, the translation time is $\\tau = \\frac{L}{v}$.\n\nThe total initiation rate, $J_{\\mathrm{init,total}}$, is the product of the number of heterologous mRNA molecules in the cell, $M_h$, and the rate of translation initiation per mRNA molecule, $j_{\\mathrm{init,per\\_mRNA}}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{init,total}} = M_h \\cdot j_{\\mathrm{init,per\\_mRNA}}\n$$\nAccording to Basis 2, $j_{\\mathrm{init,per\\_mRNA}} = k_i R_f^*$, since the free ribosome pool is maintained at $R_f^*$.\n\nThe steady-state number of heterologous mRNA molecules, $M_h$, is determined by the balance of transcription and degradation (Basis 1).
