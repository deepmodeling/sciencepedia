The result $\\gamma = \\frac{n}{4}$ shows that this gain is directly proportional to the Hill coefficient $n$. In the context of a negative feedback loop, this \"open-loop gain\" of the plant is critical. A fundamental principle of control theory is that for a negative feedback system, the closed-loop sensitivity to external disturbances is inversely related to the open-loop gain. A higher open-loop gain allows the controller to generate a stronger corrective action for a given error (deviation from the setpoint), thus more effectively rejecting disturbances and maintaining the output close to its desired value. Therefore, a higher Hill coefficient $n$ (stronger cooperativity) results in a higher open-loop gain $\\gamma$. This means that pathways with more switch-like, cooperative responses are capable of tighter, more robust regulation when placed in a negative feedback loop, reducing the system's sensitivity to small perturbations around the operating point $S=K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n}{4}}$$", "id": "2730856"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the intrinsic properties of a system, we can design controllers to regulate its behavior.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by applying the Laplace transform to the system of differential equations. Let $X_1(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x_1(t)\\}$, $X_2(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x_2(t)\\}$, $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}$, $D(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{d(t)\\}$, $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$, $E(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e(t)\\}$, and $R(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{r(t)\\}$. Assuming zero initial conditions for the deviation variables ($x_1(0)=0$, $x_2(0)=0$), the transformed equations are:\n$$ s X_{1}(s) = -a X_{1}(s) + U(s) + D(s) \\implies X_{1}(s) = \\frac{1}{s+a} (U(s) + D(s)) $$\n$$ s X_{2}(s) = b X_{1}(s) - c X_{2}(s) \\implies Y(s) = X_{2}(s) = \\frac{b}{s+c} X_{1}(s) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $X_{1}(s)$ into the second equation yields the plant output $Y(s)$ as a function of the control input $U(s)$ and the disturbance $D(s)$:\n$$ Y(s) = \\frac{b}{(s+a)(s+c)} (U(s) + D(s)) $$\nThe plant transfer function from $U(s)$ to $Y(s)$ is $G_{p}(s) = \\frac{b}{(s+a)(s+c)}$, and the disturbance transfer function from $D(s)$ to $Y(s)$ is $G_{d}(s) = \\frac{b}{(s+a)(s+c)}$. Note that $G_{p}(s) = G_{d}(s)$.\n\nThe error is $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. In a closed-loop configuration, the control input is a function of the error, $U(s) = C(s)E(s)$, where $C(s)$ is the controller transfer function.\nSubstituting for $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$:\n$$ E(s) = R(s) - [G_{p}(s)C(s)E(s) + G_{d}(s)D(s)] $$\nSolving for $E(s)$:\n$$ E(s)(1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)) = R(s) - G_{d}(s)D(s) $$\n$$ E(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)}R(s) - \\frac{G_{d}(s)}{1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)}D(s) $$\nThe steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is found using the Final Value Theorem, $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sE(s)$, which is valid only if the closed-loop system is stable.\nThe inputs are $r(t)=r_0$ and $d(t)=D_0 H(t)$, so their Laplace transforms are $R(s) = \\frac{r_0}{s}$ and $D(s) = \\frac{D_0}{s}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E(s)$ and applying the theorem:\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)}\\frac{r_{0}}{s} - \\frac{G_{d}(s)}{1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)}\\frac{D_{0}}{s} \\right] $$\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\left[ \\frac{r_{0} - D_{0}G_{d}(s)}{1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)} \\right] $$\n\nCase (i): Proportional Control\nFor proportional control, $C(s) = K_{p}$. The characteristic equation of the closed-loop system is $1 + G_{p}(s)C(s) = 0$, which is $1 + \\frac{b K_{p}}{(s+a)(s+c)} = 0$, or $s^2 + (a+c)s + (ac + bK_{p}) = 0$. Since $a, c > 0$, the coefficient $(a+c)$ is positive. Since $b > 0$ and $K_{p} \\ge 0$, the coefficient $(ac+bK_p)$ is also positive. Thus, the closed-loop system is stable for all $K_{p} \\ge 0$, and the Final Value Theorem can be applied.\n\nWe evaluate the limit for $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ \\lim_{s\\to 0} G_{p}(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} G_{d}(s) = \\frac{b}{ac} $$\n$$ \\lim_{s\\to 0} C(s) = K_{p} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{(P)} = \\frac{r_{0} - D_{0}\\frac{b}{ac}}{1 + \\frac{b K_{p}}{ac}} = \\frac{ac r_{0} - b D_{0}}{ac + b K_{p}} $$\n\nCase (ii): Integral Control\nFor integral control, the controller is described by $\\dot{z}(t) = e(t)$ and $u(t) = K_{i}z(t)$. In the Laplace domain, $U(s) = K_{i}\\frac{E(s)}{s}$, so the controller transfer function is $C(s) = \\frac{K_{i}}{s}$. This controller introduces a pole at $s=0$.\nThe characteristic equation is $1 + G_{p}(s)C(s) = 0$, which is $1 + \\frac{bK_{i}}{s(s+a)(s+c)} = 0$, or $s^3 + (a+c)s^2 + acs + bK_{i} = 0$. For stability of this third-order polynomial, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion requires all coefficients to be positive (which is true for $K_i>0$) and $(a+c)(ac) > (1)(bK_{i})$. Thus, stability is guaranteed only for $0 < K_i < \\frac{ac(a+c)}{b}$. We proceed assuming a stabilizing $K_i$ has been chosen.\n\nThe open-loop gain is $L(s) = G_{p}(s)C(s) = \\frac{bK_i}{s(s+a)(s+c)}$. The DC gain of the loop is $\\lim_{s\\to 0} L(s) = \\infty$ for $K_i > 0$. This is the defining feature that leads to zero steady-state error for step-like inputs.\nWe evaluate the steady-state error:\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{(I)} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{r_{0} - D_{0}G_{d}(s)}{1 + G_{p}(s)C(s)} $$\nThe denominator approaches infinity as $s \\to 0$, while the numerator approaches a finite value, $r_{0} - D_{0}\\frac{b}{ac}$.\nTo be rigorous:\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{(I)} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{r_{0} - D_{0}\\frac{b}{(s+a)(s+c)}}{1 + \\frac{bK_i}{s(s+a)(s+c)}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{s(s+a)(s+c)(r_{0}) - s b D_{0}}{s(s+a)(s+c) + bK_i} $$\nThis seems incorrect. Let us re-group the expression before taking the limit.\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{(I)} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{ \\left(r_{0} - D_{0}\\frac{b}{(s+a)(s+c)}\\right) s(s+a)(s+c) }{ s(s+a)(s+c) + bK_i } $$\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{(I)} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{ s(s+a)(s+c)r_0 - s b D_0 }{ s(s+a)(s+c) + bK_i } $$\nAs $s \\to 0$, the numerator becomes $0 \\cdot (a)(c)r_0 - 0 \\cdot b D_0 = 0$.\nThe denominator becomes $0 \\cdot (a)(c) + bK_i = bK_i$.\nAssuming $K_i > 0$ and $b > 0$, the result is:\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{(I)} = \\frac{0}{bK_i} = 0 $$\n\nThe mechanistic explanation for zero steady-state error with integral control invokes the Internal Model Principle. For a system to reject a persistent disturbance with zero error, the controller must contain a model of the disturbance's dynamics. A constant disturbance $D_0 H(t)$ is generated by a system with transfer function $1/s$ (an integrator). The integral controller $C(s)=K_i/s$ explicitly introduces such a pole at the origin into the feedback loop.\nIn the time domain, if a steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\ne 0$ were to exist, the integrator state $z(t)$ would grow or shrink without bound according to $\\dot{z}(t) = e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. This would cause the control action $u(t) = K_i z(t)$ to ramp indefinitely. In a stable closed-loop system, an unbounded control action must cause the plant output $y(t)$ to change. This change in $y(t)$ would continue until $y(t)$ matches the reference $r_0$, forcing the error $e(t)$ to become zero. Only when $e(t)=0$ can the integrator's input be zero, allowing its output $u(t)$ to settle to a new, constant value. This new constant control action $u_{ss}$ is precisely the value required to counteract the constant disturbance $D_0$ and maintain the output at the setpoint $r_0$. A proportional controller lacks this memory or accumulation mechanism; it requires a persistent error to generate a persistent control action, and thus cannot fully eliminate the error from a constant disturbance.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{ac r_{0} - b D_{0}}{ac + b K_{p}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2730832"}, {"introduction": "Beyond maintaining stability, a key application of dynamic regulation is optimizing system performance toward a specific goal.

Substituting the result of the integration back into the expression for $P(T)$:\n$$\nP(T) = \\alpha u \\mu(u) X_0 \\left( \\frac{\\exp(\\mu(u)T) - 1}{\\mu(u)} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\mu(u)$ cancels out, yielding a simplified expression for $P(T)$ as a function of $u$:\n$$\nP(T, u) = \\alpha u X_0 \\left( \\exp(\\mu(u)T) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the full expression for $\\mu(u)$:\n$$\nP(T, u) = \\alpha u X_0 \\left( \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nTo find the optimal induction level $u^{\\star}$ that maximizes $P(T,u)$, we must find the critical points by taking the derivative of $P(T,u)$ with respect to $u$ and setting it to zero. The problem statement guarantees an interior maximum exists in $(0,1)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{du} = \\frac{d}{du} \\left[ \\alpha X_0 \\left( u \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) - u \\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nThe constant factor $\\alpha X_0$ can be ignored. We apply the product rule to the term $u \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{du} \\left( u \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) \\right) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) + u \\cdot \\frac{d}{du}\\left(\\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T)\\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the exponential term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{du}\\left(\\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T)\\right) = \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) \\cdot (-\\mu_0 \\gamma T)\n$$\nCombining these, the full derivative of $P(T,u)$ with respect to $u$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{du} = \\alpha X_0 \\left[ \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) - u \\mu_0 \\gamma T \\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u)T) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero for the optimal value $u = u^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\mu_0(1-\\gamma u^{\\star})T) \\left( 1 - u^{\\star} \\mu_0 \\gamma T \\right) - 1 = 0\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $u^{\\star}$. We can solve it using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the solution $w$ to the equation $w \\exp(w) = z$, denoted $w = W(z)$.\nLet us rearrange the equation:\n$$\n(1 - u^{\\star} \\mu_0 \\gamma T) \\exp(\\mu_0 T - \\mu_0 \\gamma T u^{\\star}) = 1\n$$\n$$\n(1 - u^{\\star} \\mu_0 \\gamma T) \\exp(-\\mu_0 \\gamma T u^{\\star}) \\exp(\\mu_0 T) = 1\n$$\nLet $Y = \\mu_0 \\gamma T u^{\\star}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n(1 - Y) \\exp(-Y) = \\exp(-\\mu_0 T)\n$$\nLet $W = 1 - Y$. Then $Y = 1 - W$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\nW \\exp(-(1 - W)) = \\exp(-\\mu_0 T)\n$$\n$$\nW \\exp(W - 1) = \\exp(-\\mu_0 T)\n$$\n$$\nW \\exp(W) \\exp(-1) = \\exp(-\\mu_0 T)\n$$\n$$\nW \\exp(W) = \\exp(1 - \\mu_0 T)\n$$\nBy the definition of the Lambert W function, we have:\n$$\nW = W(\\exp(1 - \\mu_0 T))\n$$\nNow, substitute back $W = 1 - Y$ and $Y = \\mu_0 \\gamma T u^{\\star}$:\n$$\n1 - \\mu_0 \\gamma T u^{\\star} = W(\\exp(1 - \\mu_0 T))\n$$\nFinally, we solve for the optimal induction level $u^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 \\gamma T u^{\\star} = 1 - W(\\exp(1 - \\mu_0 T))\n$$\n$$\nu^{\\star} = \\frac{1 - W(\\exp(1 - \\mu_0 T))}{\\mu_0 \\gamma T}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the optimal induction level.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1 - W(\\exp(1 - \\mu_0 T))}{\\mu_0 \\gamma T}}\n$$", "id": "2730896"}]}
