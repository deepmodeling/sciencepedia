The total sticker concentration is given by $s = v c$, where $v$ is the valence of the protein and $c$ is the total protein concentration. By conservation of stickers, the total concentration $s$ is the sum of free stickers and stickers participating in bonds. Since each bond involves two stickers, this conservation law is:\n$$s = [\\mathrm{S}] + 2[\\mathrm{B}]$$\nThe fraction of bound stickers, $p$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of stickers in the bound state to the total sticker concentration:\n$$p = \\frac{2[\\mathrm{B}]}{s}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express $[\\mathrm{B}]$ as a function of $p$ and $s$:\n$$[\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{p s}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation allows us to express $[\\mathrm{S}]$ in terms of $p$ and $s$:\n$$[\\mathrm{S}] = s - 2[\\mathrm{B}] = s - 2\\left(\\frac{p s}{2}\\right) = s - ps = s(1-p)$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[\\mathrm{S}]$ and $[\\mathrm{B}]$ into the law of mass action equation:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{\\frac{p s}{2}}{(s(1-p))^{2}} = \\frac{p s}{2 s^{2} (1-p)^{2}} = \\frac{p}{2 s (1-p)^{2}}$$\nThis equation relates the total sticker concentration $s$ to the bond conversion fraction $p$ and the association constant $K_{a}$.

Assuming equal reactivity of all sites and neglecting intramolecular loops, this critical conversion is given by:\n$$p_{c} = \\frac{1}{v-1}$$\nThis result is valid for $v > 2$, as bifunctional monomers ($v=2$) can only form linear chains and cannot gel.
