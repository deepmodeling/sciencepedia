It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic within the context of MFA modeling, and well-structured.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the probability of finding a metabolite molecule with a specific number of heavy isotopes, given the isotopic composition of the precursor pool. This is a classic application of the binomial distribution.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability, $f$, that any single carbon atom position in a metabolite is occupied by a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ isotope. The problem states that the sole carbon source is a mixture with a mole fraction of $0.5$ of uniformly labeled substrate ($[U\\!-\\!^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$) and a mole fraction of $0.5$ of unlabeled substrate. Let the substrate molecule have $N_s$ carbon atoms.\n\nIn a representative sample of the feed, for every mole of substrate molecules, there are $0.5$ moles of $[U\\!-\\!^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ substrate and $0.5$ moles of unlabeled substrate.\nThe total moles of carbon atoms in this sample is the sum of moles of carbon from each component:\n$$ \\text{Total moles of C} = (0.5 \\times N_s) + (0.5 \\times N_s) = N_s $$\nThe moles of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms arise solely from the uniformly labeled substrate:\n$$ \\text{Moles of }^{13}\\mathrm{C} = 0.5 \\times N_s $$\nThe atom fraction of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ in the source is the ratio of the moles of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ to the total moles of carbon. The problem defines this fraction as $f$.\n$$ f = \\frac{\\text{Moles of }^{13}\\mathrm{C}}{\\text{Total moles of C}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times N_s}{N_s} = 0.5 $$\nThus, the probability of any given carbon atom being a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ isotope is $p = f = 0.5$. The probability of it being a $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ isotope (as natural abundance is corrected for) is $1-p = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nThe problem concerns a downstream metabolite with a $C_5$ backbone. This means the molecule contains $n=5$ carbon atoms. The assumption of independent incorporation allows us to model the number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms in this molecule as a series of $n=5$ independent Bernoulli trials, where \"success\" is the incorporation of a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom.\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of the mass isotopomer $M\\!+\\!2$.

The probability of this event is given by the binomial probability mass function:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nHere, $n=5$ is the number of carbon atoms in the metabolite, $k=2$ is the number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ labels, and $p=0.5$ is the probability of any single carbon being labeled.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ P(X=2) = \\binom{5}{2} (0.5)^2 (1-0.5)^{5-2} $$\n$$ P(X=2) = \\binom{5}{2} (0.5)^2 (0.5)^3 $$\n$$ P(X=2) = \\binom{5}{2} (0.5)^5 $$\nFirst, we calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{2}$:\n$$ \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the probability equation:\n$$ P(X=2) = 10 \\times (0.5)^5 $$\nRepresenting the probability $0.5$ as the fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$ P(X=2) = 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{10}{32} $$\nFinally, we simplify this fraction to its lowest terms:\n$$ P(X=2) = \\frac{5}{16} $$\nThis result is the theoretical fraction of the $M\\!+\\!2$ mass isotopomer in the mass isotopomer distribution of the specified $C_5$ metabolite.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$$", "id": "2750989"}, {"introduction": "While metabolic models operate on the level of positional isotopomers, mass spectrometers often measure fragments of metabolites, not the whole molecule.

The carboxyl carbon $C_1$ is lost in the fragmentation process for this ion, and no derivatization carbon atoms contribute to the monitored mass shifts for this fragment (assume that the fragment’s carbon content originates solely from alanine $C_2$ and $C_3$). Natural abundance contributions from non-carbon isotopes and derivatization atoms have already been corrected. \n\nAlanine’s carbon skeleton is $C_1$ (carboxyl), $C_2$ (alpha), $C_3$ (methyl), and the ion of interest is generated by cleavage that removes the carboxyl moiety, resulting in a two-carbon fragment that retains $C_2$ and $C_3$.

Alanine possesses a three-carbon skeleton, which we denote as $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$. The isotopic state of an alanine molecule is described by a positional isotopomer, represented as a binary triple $(b_1, b_2, b_3)$, where $b_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The value $b_i = 0$ signifies that carbon $C_i$ is a $^{12}\\!C$ atom, and $b_i = 1$ signifies it is a $^{13}\\!C$ atom. The mole fraction of each positional isotopomer is given as $p_{b_1 b_2 b_3}$. The sum of all given mole fractions is $\\sum p_{b_1 b_2 b_3} = 0.30 + 0.10 + 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.09 + 0.07 + 0.12 + 0.12 = 1.00$, which confirms it is a complete and valid probability distribution.\n\nThe problem states that a fragment ion is generated by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This fragment contains only carbons $C_2$ and $C_3$ from the original alanine molecule. The carboxyl carbon, $C_1$, is lost during fragmentation. This defines the carbon atom mapping from the parent molecule (alanine) to the observed fragment. Let the fragment's carbon atoms be $C'_1$ and $C'_2$. The mapping is:\n$$\nC_2^{\\text{Ala}} \\rightarrow C'_1 \\\\\nC_3^{\\text{Ala}} \\rightarrow C'_2\n$$\nThe isotopic state of the two-carbon fragment is thus determined by the isotopic states of $C_2$ and $C_3$ in the parent alanine molecule. The isotopic state of $C_1$ is irrelevant to the mass of this specific fragment.\n\nThe mass isotopomer distribution (MID) of the fragment describes the mole fractions of fragments containing $k$ heavy isotopes (in this case, $^{13}\\!C$).

We are tasked with finding $m_1$, the mole fraction of the $M+1$ mass isotopomer.\n\nTo compute the fragment's MID, we must sum, or marginalize, the mole fractions of all parent positional isotopomers that produce a fragment with a given number of $^{13}\\!C$ atoms.\n\nAn $M+1$ fragment is one that contains exactly one $^{13}\\!C$ atom. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Carbon $C_2$ is $^{13}\\!C$ (so $b_2=1$) and carbon $C_3$ is $^{12}\\!C$ (so $b_3=0$).\n2.

The parent isotopomers satisfying this are $(0,1,0)$ and $(1,1,0)$. The combined mole fraction for this case is $p_{010} + p_{110}$.\n\nCase 2: The fragment is formed from an alanine molecule where $b_2=0$ and $b_3=1$.

Third, to compute the value of $f_{B}$ from given experimental data. I will address each part in sequence, adhering strictly to the provided information and principles of isotope tracing.\n\nPart 1: Non-identifiability with $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ glucose.\n\nThe tracer is pure $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ glucose. We assume negligible natural abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 1: Trace the label from glucose to the triose phosphate pool.\nA molecule of glucose is a $6$-carbon chain. $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ glucose is labeled at the $C1$ position. Glycolysis converts this to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), preserving the label at the $C1$ position. Thus, we have $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ FBP.\nAldolase cleaves the $6$-carbon FBP into two $3$-carbon triose phosphates: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). The cleavage maps the FBP carbons as follows:\nFBP carbons $C1, C2, C3 \\to$ DHAP carbons $C1, C2, C3$.\nFBP carbons $C4, C5, C6 \\to$ GAP carbons $C1, C2, C3$.\nTherefore, the initial products are $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ DHAP and unlabeled GAP.\n\nStep 2: Apply the triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) equilibration condition.\nTPI catalyzes the rapid and reversible interconversion of DHAP and GAP. The carbon mapping is direct: DHAP $C_i \\leftrightarrow$ GAP $C_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nWe begin with a pool of triose phosphates where per molecule of initial glucose, one molecule is $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ DHAP and one molecule is unlabeled GAP. Due to rapid equilibration, the single $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ label originally on DHAP becomes distributed across the entire triose phosphate pool (DHAP and GAP). The total pool consists of two triose phosphate molecules, one of which carries a single label at position $C1$. Thus, the probability that any given triose phosphate molecule (either DHAP or GAP) is labeled at $C1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, or $0.5$. The GAP pool feeding into the lower glycolysis modules is therefore a mixture: $50\\%$ is $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ GAP and $50\\%$ is unlabeled GAP. We can represent the average labeling of the GAP pool as a vector of probabilities for each carbon being labeled: $(0.5, 0, 0)$.\n\nStep 3: Trace the label from GAP to pyruvate.\nLet's analyze the fate of the two GAP populations.\nCase A: Unlabeled GAP (accounts for $0.5$ of the total GAP flux).\nWhether this GAP passes through Module A or Module B, the resulting pyruvate will be unlabeled ($m+0$).\nCase B: $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ GAP (accounts for $0.5$ of the total GAP flux). This GAP has a labeling state we can denote $(1,0,0)$.\nA fraction $1-f_{B}$ of this labeled GAP enters Module A. The carbon mapping is GAP $C1 \\to$ Pyr $C3$, GAP $C2 \\to$ Pyr $C2$, GAP $C3 \\to$ Pyr $C1$. The input $(1,0,0)$ yields an output pyruvate labeled at $C3$, i.e., with labeling state $(0,0,1)$. This is a singly labeled ($m+1$) molecule.\nA fraction $f_{B}$ of this labeled GAP enters Module B. The carbon mapping is GAP $C1 \\to$ Pyr $C1$, GAP $C2 \\to$ Pyr $C2$, GAP $C3 \\to$ Pyr $C3$. The input $(1,0,0)$ yields an output pyruvate labeled at C1, i.e., with labeling state $(1,0,0)$. This is also a singly labeled ($m+1$) molecule.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the intact pyruvate Mass Isotopomer Distribution (MID).\nThe MID describes the fraction of molecules with $0, 1, 2, ...$ heavy isotopes.\n-   Fraction of $m+0$ pyruvate: This arises exclusively from the unlabeled GAP population. Its fraction is $0.5$.\n-   Fraction of $m+1$ pyruvate: This arises exclusively from the $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ GAP population. All pyruvate derived from this population is singly labeled, regardless of the pathway taken. The total fraction of pyruvate coming from this source is $0.5$. Therefore, the fraction of $m+1$ pyruvate is $0.5$.\n    Specifically, the flux to $m+1$ pyruvate is a sum from both pathways acting on the labeled GAP sub-pool: $(0.5 \\times (1-f_{B})) + (0.5 \\times f_{B}) = 0.5 \\times (1-f_{B}+f_{B}) = 0.5$.\n-   Fraction of $m+2$ pyruvate: $0$. No doubly labeled GAP is produced.\n-   Fraction of $m+3$ pyruvate: $0$. No triply labeled GAP is produced.\n\nThe resulting pyruvate MID vector is ($m+0, m+1, m+2, m+3$) = $(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0)$. This result is independent of the flux split parameter $f_{B}$. Any two different values of $f_{B}$ will yield the identical pyruvate MID. This demonstrates that $f_{B}$ is non-identifiable from an intact pyruvate MID measurement under a $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ glucose labeling experiment.\n\nPart 2: Derive an expression for $\\phi_{12}$ as a function of $f_{B}$.\n\nThe experiment is repeated with pure $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ glycerol. It is given that this results in a GAP pool where all molecules carry a single $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ at GAP $C1$.\nStep 1: Define the input GAP labeling.\nThe problem states that the GAP pool entering the modules is $100\\%$ $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]$ GAP.

We need to find the MID of this fragment pool.\nThe total population of Pyr12 fragments is a mixture originating from the two pyruvate populations, $Pyr_A$ and $Pyr_B$.\n-   Fragments from $Pyr_A$ (fraction $1-f_B$ of total): The parent pyruvate has labeling $(0,0,1)$.

The fraction of $m+2$ fragments is $0$.\n$\\phi_{12}$ is defined as the $m+1$ fraction of Pyr12. By definition, this is the ratio of the number of $m+1$ fragments to the total number of fragments.
