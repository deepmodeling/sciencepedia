In the wild type (WT), a fraction $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ of glucose uptake proceeds via the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas glycolysis (EMP) branch that requires PGI; the remaining fraction $(1-\\alpha)$ proceeds via the oxidative PPP. In the PGI knockout (KO), the EMP branch from glucose-$6$-phosphate is blocked, thus $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{KO}} = 0$.\n- Consider the canonical stoichiometric conversions:\n  - Oxidative PPP: three molecules of glucose-$6$-phosphate yield three molecules of ribulose-$5$-phosphate, release three molecules of carbon dioxide, and produce six molecules of NADPH. The non-oxidative rearrangements convert three molecules of ribulose-$5$-phosphate into two molecules of fructose-$6$-phosphate and one molecule of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of metabolic stoichiometry, is well-posed with a clear\nobjective and sufficient data, and is free from contradiction or ambiguity. The simplifications are explicitly stated and are standard for creating tractable models of complex biological systems. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to design a computational model to quantify the metabolic state of *Escherichia coli* under two conditions: wild type (WT) and a phosphoglucose isomerase knockout (PGI KO). The state is defined by the production and consumption of redox cofactors NADPH and NADH. The model is based on the provided stoichiometric relationships for glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.\n\nThe central variable is the flux-splitting ratio $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, which represents the fraction of glucose catabolized through the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway. The remaining fraction, $(1-\\alpha)$, is routed through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical formulation for the key metabolic fluxes as functions of the glucose uptake rate $v_{\\mathrm{glc}}$ and the split ratio $\\alpha$. All fluxes are in units of $\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{gDW}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe total rate of pyruvate formation, $v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}$, is the sum of pyruvate produced from the EMP and PPP branches. The EMP pathway yields $2$ molecules of pyruvate per molecule of glucose, contributing $2\\,\\alpha\\,v_{\\mathrm{glc}}$. The oxidative PPP, including non-oxidative rearrangements and lower glycolysis, yields $\\frac{5}{3}$ molecules of pyruvate per molecule of glucose, contributing $\\frac{5}{3}(1-\\alpha)v_{\\mathrm{glc}}$. The total pyruvate formation rate is therefore:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha) = 2\\,\\alpha\\,v_{\\mathrm{glc}} + \\frac{5}{3}(1-\\alpha)v_{\\mathrm{glc}} = v_{\\mathrm{glc}}\\left(2\\alpha + \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{5}{3}\\alpha\\right) = v_{\\mathrm{glc}}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha + 5}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression correctly matches the one provided in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we define the total NADPH supply rate, $v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}$. NADPH is produced by the oxidative PPP and by isocitrate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle. The oxidative PPP yields $2$ molecules of NADPH per molecule of glucose, contributing $2(1-\\alpha)v_{\\mathrm{glc}}$. It is assumed that all pyruvate formed is completely oxidized ($\\beta=1$), and that each molecule of pyruvate oxidized yields $1$ molecule of NADPH from the NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. This contributes $1 \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha)$. The total supply is:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}(\\alpha) = 2(1-\\alpha)v_{\\mathrm{glc}} + v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}(\\alpha) = 2(1-\\alpha)v_{\\mathrm{glc}} + v_{\\mathrm{glc}}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha + 5}{3}\\right) = v_{\\mathrm{glc}}\\left(\\frac{6(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha + 5}{3}\\right) = v_{\\mathrm{glc}}\\left(\\frac{11 - 5\\alpha}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThis also matches the simplified expression given. The NADPH surplus, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}$, is the difference between supply and the anabolic demand, $v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,demand}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}(\\alpha) = v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}(\\alpha) - v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,demand}}\n$$\n\nNow, we determine the total NADH production rate, $v_{\\mathrm{NADH,prod}}$. NADH is produced in lower glycolysis and during pyruvate oxidation via the TCA cycle. The glycolytic NADH yield per molecule of pyruvate formed is $1$. This can be seen by summing the contributions: $2$ NADH per glucose in EMP (ratio of NADH/pyruvate is $1$) and $\\frac{5}{3}$ NADH per glucose in PPP (ratio of NADH/pyruvate is $1$). Thus, the glycolytic NADH production is $1 \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha)$. Pyruvate oxidation to CO$_2$ is stated to yield $3$ molecules of NADH per molecule of pyruvate. With $\\beta=1$, this contributes $3 \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha)$. The total production is:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{NADH,prod}}(\\alpha) = v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha) + 3\\,v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha) = 4\\,v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}(\\alpha)\n$$\nThis rate is balanced against the NADH reoxidation capacity provided by aerobic respiration. One molecule of NADH requires $\\frac{1}{2}$ molecule of O$_2$. An oxygen uptake capacity of $v_{\\mathrm{O2,max}}$ can therefore reoxidize $2\\,v_{\\mathrm{O2,max}}$ of NADH. The NADH surplus, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADH}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADH}}(\\alpha) = v_{\\mathrm{NADH,prod}}(\\alpha) - 2\\,v_{\\mathrm{O2,max}}\n$$\nA positive value indicates a redox imbalance where NADH production exceeds reoxidation capacity.\n\nThe behavior of the wild-type strain is governed by an optimization principle: it maximizes the flux through the ATP-efficient EMP pathway (i.e., maximizes $\\alpha$) subject to satisfying the cellular NADPH demand. This translates to finding the maximum $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ such that $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}(\\alpha) \\ge 0$. As $v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}(\\alpha)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\alpha$, this condition is met by setting the supply equal to the demand:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}(\\alpha) = v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,demand}} \\implies v_{\\mathrm{glc}}\\left(\\frac{11 - 5\\alpha}{3}\\right) = v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,demand}}\n$$\nSolving for the optimal $\\alpha$, denoted $\\alpha^*$:\n$$\n\\alpha^* = \\frac{11 - 3\\,v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,demand}}/v_{\\mathrm{glc}}}{5}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ must be in the range $[0, 1]$, the actual value for the wild type, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, is clamped to this interval:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\min\\left\\{1, \\max\\left\\{0, \\alpha^*\\right\\}\\right\\}\n$$\nIf $\\alpha^* < 0$, it signifies that even with maximum PPP flux ($\\alpha=0$), NADPH demand cannot be met. In this case, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is set to $0$ to maximize NADPH production. If $\\alpha^* > 1$, it means that even with maximum EMP flux ($\\alpha=1$), NADPH is overproduced. The cell still operates at $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}=1$ as per the optimization rule. If $0 \\le \\alpha^* \\le 1$, the cell operates at $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}=\\alpha^*$ to exactly meet the NADPH demand, resulting in $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}) = 0$.\n\nFor the PGI knockout mutant, the flux from glucose-$6$-phosphate to fructose-$6$-phosphate is blocked. This forces all glucose catabolism through the PPP. Therefore, for the KO strain, the split ratio is fixed: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{KO}} = 0$.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case $(v_{\\mathrm{glc}}, v_{\\mathrm{O2,max}}, v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,demand}})$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate $\\alpha^*$ using the derived formula.\n2.  Determine $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\min(1, \\max(0, \\alpha^*))$.\n3.  Set $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{KO}} = 0$.\n4.  Calculate the five required output values:\n    - $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}$\n    - $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}})$ using the formulas for $v_{\\mathrm{NADPH,supply}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}$.\n    - $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{KO}})$ for the KO case where $\\alpha = 0$.\n    - $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADH}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}})$ using the formulas for $v_{\\mathrm{pyr}}$, $v_{\\mathrm{NADH,prod}}$, and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADH}}$.\n    - $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{NADH}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{KO}})$ for the KO case where $\\alpha = 0$.\n5.
