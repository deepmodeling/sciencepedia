These systems consist of a cell extract containing all the necessary molecular machinery (ribosomes, polymerases, amino acids, etc.) to produce a protein from a DNA template.\n\nA researcher is comparing the protein expression yields from two different DNA templates encoding the same fluorescent protein. Template A is a standard circular plasmid, while Template B is a linear DNA fragment generated by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Both templates contain the identical promoter and gene sequence. When equal initial molar concentrations of each template are added to separate TX-TL reactions, the researcher observes a significantly lower final protein yield from the linear template.\n\nThis difference is primarily attributed to the presence of exonucleases in the cell extract, which degrade linear DNA but not circular DNA. To model this phenomenon, assume the following:\n1.  The degradation of the linear DNA template follows first-order kinetics with a degradation rate constant $k_{deg}$. The concentration of the circular plasmid template remains constant throughout the reaction.\n2.  The rate of protein synthesis at any given moment is directly proportional to the concentration of functional (non-degraded) DNA template present at that moment.
