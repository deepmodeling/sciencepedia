The catalytic site of the upstream enzyme defines a spherical reactive capture region of radius $a$, centered at one tether terminus; productive channeling occurs when the other tether terminus (attached to the downstream enzyme) lies within this capture region. Define the effective molarity (EM) as the molar concentration that, if supplied as free substrate in bulk solution, would yield the same instantaneous probability of finding a reactive partner inside that capture region as the tethered configuration at configurational equilibrium.

The derivation must be grounded in equilibrium statistical mechanics and a physically consistent polymer model.\n\nWe begin with the provided definition of effective molarity:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EM} \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{contact}}}{N_A V_c}\n$$\nHere, $p_{\\mathrm{contact}}$ is the equilibrium probability that the end-to-end vector of the linker, $\\vec{R}$, falls within a spherical capture volume $V_c = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$ centered at one end of the chain, and $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant.\n\nThe problem specifies that the linker is an intrinsically disordered polypeptide with contour length $L$ and persistence length $l_p$, and we are to consider the limit of a highly flexible linker, where $L \\gg l_p$. In this limit, the worm-like chain (WLC) model, which accurately describes semi-flexible polymers, converges to the Gaussian chain model. According to the central limit theorem applied to polymer chains, the probability density function, $P(\\vec{R})$, for finding the chain's end-to-end vector at $\\vec{R}$ is a Gaussian distribution:\n$$\nP(\\vec{R}) = \\left( \\frac{3}{2 \\pi \\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{3 |\\vec{R}|^2}{2 \\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$ is the mean-squared end-to-end distance of the polymer.\n\nFor the WLC model in the flexible limit ($L \\gg l_p$), the mean-squared end-to-end distance is well-approximated by the random-walk limit, which is linear in the contour length. The effective segment length, or Kuhn length, is $b = 2l_p$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\langle R^2 \\rangle \\approx 2 l_p L\n$$\n\nThe contact probability, $p_{\\mathrm{contact}}$, is the integral of the probability density function over the capture volume $V_c$. This volume is a sphere of radius $a$ centered at the origin (the position of the first enzyme's catalytic site).\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{contact}} = \\int_{|\\vec{R}| \\le a} P(\\vec{R}) \\, d^3\\vec{R}\n$$\n\nThe problem states a second condition: the capture radius is small compared to the root-mean-squared end-to-end distance, i.e., $a \\ll \\sqrt{\\langle R^2 \\rangle}$. This is a crucial approximation. Under this condition, the argument of the exponential in $P(\\vec{R})$ is very small throughout the integration volume:\n$$\n\\frac{3 |\\vec{R}|^2}{2 \\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\le \\frac{3 a^2}{2 \\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\ll 1\n$$\nTherefore, the exponential term can be approximated as $\\exp(0) = 1$ over the entire volume $V_c$. This means the probability density $P(\\vec{R})$ is effectively constant within the small capture sphere and equal to its value at the origin, $P(0)$:\n$$\nP(\\vec{R}) \\approx P(0) = \\left( \\frac{3}{2 \\pi \\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nThe integral for $p_{\\mathrm{contact}}$ thus simplifies significantly:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{contact}} \\approx \\int_{|\\vec{R}| \\le a} P(0) \\, d^3\\vec{R} = P(0) \\int_{|\\vec{R}| \\le a} d^3\\vec{R} = P(0) V_c\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the defining equation for effective molarity:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EM} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{contact}}}{N_A V_c} \\approx \\frac{P(0) V_c}{N_A V_c} = \\frac{P(0)}{N_A}\n$$\nThis demonstrates a general principle: for a small capture volume, the effective molarity is directly proportional to the probability density of finding the chain ends at zero separation.\n\nTo obtain the final expression, we substitute the formulas for $P(0)$ and $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EM} \\approx \\frac{1}{N_A} \\left( \\frac{3}{2 \\pi \\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{1}{N_A} \\left( \\frac{3}{2 \\pi (2 l_p L)} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the parenthesis gives the final result:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EM} = \\frac{1}{N_A} \\left( \\frac{3}{4 \\pi l_p L} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nThis expression gives the effective molarity in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, as required.\n\nFinally, we identify the scaling of $\\mathrm{EM}$ with the contour length $L$, holding the persistence length $l_p$ constant. From the derived expression, it is evident that the effective molarity scales with the inverse three-halves power of the linker length:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EM} \\propto L^{-3/2}\n$$\nThis scaling behavior reflects the fact that as the polymer chain becomes longer, the volume it explores increases, thereby reducing the probability density of finding its free end at the origin.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N_A} \\left(\\frac{3}{4 \\pi l_p L}\\right)^{3/2}}\n$$", "id": "2766122"}, {"introduction": "Theory and modeling must ultimately connect with physical reality.
