Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is twofold: first, to derive the rate law for a single-substrate enzyme reaction under the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA), and second, to calculate the substrate concentration $[S]$ required to achieve a specified flux $v$.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation. The reaction mechanism is given as:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{cat}} E + P\n$$\nHere, $k_1$ is the rate constant for the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$, $k_{-1}$ is the rate constant for its dissociation back to free enzyme $E$ and substrate $S$, and $k_{cat}$ is the catalytic rate constant for the formation of product $P$ and regeneration of free enzyme $E$.\n\nBased on mass-action kinetics, the rate of formation of the product, which corresponds to the reaction flux $v$, is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{cat}[ES]\n$$\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of ES}) - (\\text{rate of consumption of ES})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1}[ES] + k_{cat}[ES]) = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the QSSA, which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant after a brief initial transient, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this approximation gives:\n$$\nk_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_{1}[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]\n$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is conserved.

Substituting this expression into the QSSA equation yields:\n$$\nk_{1}([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]\n$$\nWe now solve for $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_T[S] - k_{1}[ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]\n$$\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_T[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] + k_{1}[ES][S]\n$$\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_T[S] = [ES](k_{-1} + k_{cat} + k_{1}[S])\n$$\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_{1}[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{cat} + k_{1}[S]}\n$$\nTo obtain the classical form of the rate law, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_{1}$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_{1}} + [S]}\n$$\nWe define the Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ as the collection of rate constants $K_{m} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_{1}}$.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution may be constructed.\n\nThe task is to determine if the objective function is bounded over the feasible set and, if not, to find a representative flux vector along the optimal ray. The feasible set is the region in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by the constraints $S\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$. This set is a polyhedral cone, as its constraints consist of homogeneous linear equalities and non-negativity bounds.\n\nFirst, we must characterize the null space of the matrix $S$, which is the set of all vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ satisfying $S\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$. The matrix equation is:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_{1} \\\\\nv_{2} \\\\\nv_{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis expands into a system of two linear equations:\n$$(1) \\quad 1 \\cdot v_{1} - 1 \\cdot v_{2} + 0 \\cdot v_{3} = 0$$\n$$(2) \\quad 0 \\cdot v_{1} + 1 \\cdot v_{2} - 1 \\cdot v_{3} = 0$$\nFrom equation $(1)$, we find $v_{1} = v_{2}$. From equation $(2)$, we find $v_{2} = v_{3}$. Therefore, any vector in the null space must satisfy $v_{1} = v_{2} = v_{3}$. We can express any such vector as a scalar multiple of a basis vector. Let $v_{3} = k$ for some scalar $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $v_{1} = v_{2} = v_{3} = k$. The null space of $S$, denoted $\\text{ker}(S)$, is the one-dimensional subspace spanned by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.

Since $k$ can be any non-negative real number ($k \\ge 0$), the value of $z$ can be made arbitrarily large by increasing $k$. Consequently, the maximization problem has no finite maximum, and the FBA problem is unbounded.\n\nThe problem is unbounded because the feasible cone possesses an extreme ray, with direction vector $\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, along which the objective function increases.

A general point on the ray is given by $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} k \\\\ k \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix}$. Applying the condition $v_{1}=1$ gives $k=1$. Substituting this value of $k$ back into the general form of $\\mathbf{v}$, we obtain the normalized flux vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector represents the unique point on the optimal ray satisfying the specified scaling condition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2762811"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges the gap between static, steady-state analysis and the dynamic nature of real biological systems.

A solution is feasible only if the cell can take in enough substrate to satisfy its mandatory requirements. For any non-negative growth ($v_2 \\ge 0$), we must have $v_1 - v_3 - b v_4 \\ge 0$. Using the minimal values for $v_3$ and $v_4$ as a function of $v_1$, we get:\n    $$\n    v_1 - m_{\\mathrm{eff},k} - b (r_{\\mathrm{of}} v_1) \\ge 0 \\implies v_1(1 - b r_{\\mathrm{of}}) \\ge m_{\\mathrm{eff},k}\n    $$\n    This establishes a minimum required uptake rate for viability: $v_1 \\ge \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{eff},k}}{1 - b r_{\\mathrm{of}}}$. Let us denote this threshold as $v_{1,k}^0$.\n    For a feasible solution to exist, the maximum possible uptake $\\hat{v}_{1,k}$ must be at least as large as the minimum required uptake $v_{1,k}^0$. That is, $\\hat{v}_{1,k} \\ge v_{1,k}^0$.\n    - If $\\hat{v}_{1,k} < v_{1,k}^0$, the LP is infeasible. As per the problem statement, all fluxes are set to zero: $v_k = [0, 0, 0, 0]^\\top$.\n    - If $\\hat{v}_{1,k} \\ge v_{1,k}^0$, the LP is feasible, and the optimal flux distribution is found by maximizing uptake:\n      \\begin{align*}\n      v_{1,k} &= \\hat{v}_{1,k} \\\\\n      v_{3,k} &= m_{\\mathrm{eff},k} \\\\\n      v_{4,k} &= r_{\\mathrm{of}} v_{1,k} \\\\\n      v_{2,k} &= \\frac{1}{a} (v_{1,k}(1 - b r_{\\mathrm{of}}) - m_{\\mathrm{eff},k})\n      \\end{align*}\n\n5.  **Numerical Integration**: The extracellular concentrations are updated from time step $k$ to $k+1$ using the forward Euler method with a step size of $\\Delta t$.\n    \\begin{align*}\n    S_{k+1} &= \\max(0, S_k - \\Delta t \\cdot v_{1,k} \\cdot X_k) \\\\\n    X_{k+1} &= \\max(0, X_k + \\Delta t \\cdot v_{2,k} \\cdot X_k) \\\\\n    P_{k+1} &= \\max(0, P_k + \\Delta t \\cdot v_{4,k} \\cdot X_k)\n    \\end{align*}\n    The $\\max(0, \\cdot)$ operation ensures that concentrations remain non-negative, a necessary physical constraint.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iteratively applying the analytical LP solution and the Euler update for the specified number of time steps.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Note: The problem statement allows for scipy but it is not necessary\n# as the linear program can be solved analytically.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the dFBA simulations for the specified test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Global parameters\n    a = 20.0       # Biomass precursor coefficient (dimensionless)\n    b = 1.0        # Product precursor coefficient (dimensionless)\n    V_max_g = 10.0 # Max substrate uptake rate (mmol/(gDW*h))\n    K_g = 0.5      # Substrate uptake saturation constant (mmol/L)\n    m = 1.0        # Maintenance lower bound (mmol/(gDW*h))\n    r_of = 0.1     # Overflow fraction (dimensionless)\n    V_max_p = 5.0  # Max product secretion rate (mmol/(gDW*h))\n    alpha = 0.5    # Repression factor (dimensionless)\n    P_thr = 50.0   # Repression threshold (mmol/L)\n\n    params = {\n        'a': a, 'b': b, 'V_max_g': V_max_g, 'K_g': K_g, 'm': m,\n        'r_of': r_of, 'V_max_p': V_max_p, 'alpha': alpha, 'P_thr': P_thr\n    }\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: S(0), X(0), P(0), T, dt\n        (100.0, 0.05, 0.0, 10.0, 0.01),\n        # Case 2\n        (2.0, 0.1, 0.0, 5.0, 0.01),\n        # Case 3\n        (50.0, 0.01, 60.0, 10.0, 0.01),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        S0, X0, P0, T, dt = case\n        final_state = simulate(S0, X0, P0, T, dt, params)\n        results.append(list(np.round(final_state, 6)))\n        \n    # Format the final output string as specified\n    # e.g., [[s1,x1,p1],[s2,x2,p2],[s3,x3,p3]]\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(map(str, results)) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\ndef simulate(S0, X0, P0, T, dt, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a single dynamic Flux Balance Analysis simulation run.\n\n    Args:\n        S0 (float): Initial substrate concentration (mmol/L).\n        X0 (float): Initial biomass concentration (gDW/L).\n        P0 (float): Initial product concentration (mmol/L).\n        T (float): Total simulation time (h).\n        dt (float): Time step size (h).\n        params (dict): Dictionary of model parameters.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: Final (S, X, P) concentrations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters\n    a = params['a']\n    b = params['b']\n    V_max_g = params['V_max_g']\n    K_g = params['K_g']\n    m = params['m']\n    r_of = params['r_of']\n    V_max_p = params['V_max_p']\n    alpha = params['alpha']\n    P_thr = params['P_thr']\n    \n    num_steps = int(T / dt)\n    S, X, P = S0, X0, P0\n\n    one_minus_br_of = 1.0 - b * r_of\n\n    for _ in range(num_steps):\n        # Ensure state variables are non-negative\n        S = max(0.0, S)\n        X = max(0.0, X)\n        P = max(0.0, P)\n\n        if X <= 0: # No biomass, no reaction\n            v1, v2, v3, v4 = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n        else:\n            # 1.
