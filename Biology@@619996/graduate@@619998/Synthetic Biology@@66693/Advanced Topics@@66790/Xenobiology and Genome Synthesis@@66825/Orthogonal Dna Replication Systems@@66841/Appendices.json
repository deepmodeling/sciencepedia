The orthogonal DNA polymerase, which we denote as the enzyme $E$, encounters two substrates: the right orthogonal nucleotide, $S_r$, and the wrong host nucleotide, $S_w$. The concentrations are $[S_r] = [dNTP]_r$ and $[S_w] = [dNTP]_w$.

Based on the derived formula, fidelity can be increased (i.e., $f_{\\text{error}}$ can be decreased) by:\n$1$. Increasing the concentration of the right substrate, $[S_r] = [dNTP]_r$. This increases the denominator, thus decreasing the overall fraction.\n$2$. Decreasing the concentration of the wrong substrate, $[S_w] = [dNTP]_w$. This decreases the numerator, thus decreasing the overall fraction.\nTherefore, modulating the ratio $[dNTP]_r/[dNTP]_w$ provides a direct mechanism for controlling the fidelity of the orthogonal replication system, supplementing the intrinsic discrimination provided by the polymerase's catalytic efficiencies.\n\nWe now proceed to the numerical calculation.

This statement is a direct consequence of our derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$ bases and $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ per base per replication, maintaining the master sequence requires $s_{\\max} \\gtrsim 1.65$.**\n\nWe use the error threshold condition, rearranged to solve for $s_{\\max}$:\n$$\\ln(s_{\\max})  L \\mu$$\n$$s_{\\max}  e^{L \\mu}$$\nGiven $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$ and $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nThe exponent is $L \\mu = (5.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.5$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$s_{\\max}  e^{0.5}$$\nCalculating the value: $e^{0.5} = \\sqrt{e} \\approx 1.6487$.\nThus, to maintain the master sequence, it is required that $s_{\\max}  1.6487$. The statement that $s_{\\max} \\gtrsim 1.65$ (meaning $s_{\\max}$ must be greater than or approximately equal to $1.65$) is a correct interpretation of this result.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Improving $Q$ by a fixed increment of $10^{-6}$ per base, at fixed $s_{\\max}$, causes the maximum maintainable length $L_{\\max}$ to increase without bound (that is, proportionally to $1/\\mu$) regardless of the starting error rate.**\n\nThe relationship for maximum length is $L_{\\max} \\approx \\dfrac{\\ln(s_{\\max})}{\\mu}$. It is true that $L_{\\max}$ is inversely proportional to $\\mu$ ($L_{\\max} \\propto 1/\\mu$), which means as $\\mu \\rightarrow 0$, $L_{\\max}$ increases without bound. However, the statement analyzes the effect of a *fixed improvement* on $L_{\\max}$.\nAn improvement in $Q$ by a fixed increment $\\Delta Q = 10^{-6}$ corresponds to a decrease in $\\mu$ by a fixed amount $\\Delta \\mu = 10^{-6}$.\nLet the starting error rate be $\\mu_0$. The new error rate is $\\mu_1 = \\mu_0 - \\Delta\\mu$.\nThe initial maximum length is $L_{\\max, 0} \\approx \\dfrac{\\ln(s_{\\max})}{\\mu_0}$.\nThe new maximum length is $L_{\\max, 1} \\approx \\dfrac{\\ln(s_{\\max})}{\\mu_1} = \\dfrac{\\ln(s_{\\max})}{\\mu_0 - \\Delta\\mu}$.\nThe increase in maximum length is $\\Delta L_{\\max} = L_{\\max, 1} - L_{\\max, 0}$:\n$$\\Delta L_{\\max} \\approx \\ln(s_{\\max}) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 - \\Delta\\mu} - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\right) = \\ln(s_{\\max}) \\frac{\\mu_0 - (\\mu_0 - \\Delta\\mu)}{\\mu_0(\\mu_0 - \\Delta\\mu)} = \\frac{\\ln(s_{\\max})\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu_0(\\mu_0 - \\Delta\\mu)}$$\nThe magnitude of this increase, $\\Delta L_{\\max}$, clearly depends on the starting error rate $\\mu_0$. For a smaller $\\mu_0$ (closer to $\\Delta\\mu$), the denominator becomes very small, leading to a very large increase. For a larger $\\mu_0$, the increase is smaller. Therefore, the effect is not \"regardless of the starting error rate.\" This phrase makes the statement factually incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2756151"}]}
