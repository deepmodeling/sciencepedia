The model of partitioning molecules into discrete compartments is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics and is standard in the analysis of *in vitro* compartmentalization (IVC) experiments in synthetic biology. The derivation of the Poisson distribution as a limit of the binomial distribution is a fundamental result in probability theory. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a unique, meaningful solution. There are no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe partitioning of $N$ identical items into $M$ distinct bins is a classic problem in combinatorics. For a single DNA template, the probability of it entering any specific droplet is $p = \\frac{1}{M}$, as the partitioning is uniform and random. The probability of it not entering that specific droplet is $1-p = 1 - \\frac{1}{M}$.\n\nSince the $N$ templates partition independently, the number of templates, $k$, found within a single, specific droplet follows a binomial distribution. The probability of a droplet containing exactly $k$ templates is given by the binomial probability mass function $P_{B}(k; N, p)$:\n$$P_{B}(k; N, p) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nSubstituting $p = \\frac{1}{M}$, we have:\n$$P(k) = \\binom{N}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right)^k \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{N-k}$$\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this expression in the limit where $N \\to \\infty$ and $M \\to \\infty$, while the ratio $\\lambda = \\frac{N}{M}$ remains constant. We can substitute $N = \\lambda M$ into the expression. Before taking the limit, let us expand the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k} = \\frac{N(N-1)\\cdots(N-k+1)}{k!}$.\n$$P(k) = \\frac{N(N-1)\\cdots(N-k+1)}{k!} \\frac{1}{M^k} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{N-k}$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$P(k) = \\frac{1}{k!} \\left[ \\frac{N}{M} \\frac{N-1}{M} \\cdots \\frac{N-k+1}{M} \\right] \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{N} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{-k}$$\nNow, we analyze each part in the limit as $M \\to \\infty$.\nFirst, consider the product term. For any fixed integer $j$ where $0 \\le j < k$:\n$$\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{N-j}{M} = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\lambda M - j}{M} = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left(\\lambda - \\frac{j}{M}\\right) = \\lambda$$\nSince this holds for all $k$ terms in the product, the entire product converges to $\\lambda^k$:\n$$\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{N}{M} \\frac{N-1}{M} \\cdots \\frac{N-k+1}{M} \\right] = \\lambda^k$$\nNext, consider the term $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{N} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{\\lambda M}$. Using the well-known limit definition of the exponential function, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (1 + \\frac{a}{x})^x = \\exp(a)$, we set $a = -\\lambda$ and $x = \\lambda M$:\n$$\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{\\lambda M} = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda M}\\right)^{\\lambda M} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nFinally, for the last term, as $M \\to \\infty$, the base approaches $1$:\n$$\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)^{-k} = (1-0)^{-k} = 1$$\nCombining these results, the limiting probability distribution, which we denote as $P_{P}(k; \\lambda)$, is:\n$$P_{P}(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{k!} \\cdot \\lambda^k \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThis is the probability mass function for a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, as required.\n\nThe fraction of droplets that are singly occupied, $f_{\\mathrm{single}}$, corresponds to the case where a droplet contains exactly one molecule, i.e., $k=1$. We substitute $k=1$ into the Poisson distribution:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{single}}(\\lambda) = P_{P}(k=1; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^1 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1!} = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nTo find the value of $\\lambda$ that maximizes this fraction, we must find the critical points by taking the first derivative of $f_{\\mathrm{single}}(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and setting it to zero. Using the product rule for differentiation, $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$, with $u(\\lambda) = \\lambda$ and $v(\\lambda) = \\exp(-\\lambda)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}f_{\\mathrm{single}}(\\lambda) = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left[ \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) \\right] = (1)\\exp(-\\lambda) + \\lambda(-\\exp(-\\lambda))$$\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}f_{\\mathrm{single}}(\\lambda) = \\exp(-\\lambda) - \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)\\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nWe set the derivative to zero to find the optimal value, $\\lambda^{\\ast}$:\n$$(1-\\lambda^{\\ast})\\exp(-\\lambda^{\\ast}) = 0$$\nSince $\\exp(-\\lambda^{\\ast})$ is strictly positive for all finite $\\lambda^{\\ast}$, the equation is satisfied only if the other factor is zero:\n$$1 - \\lambda^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies \\lambda^{\\ast} = 1$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we can examine the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2}{d\\lambda^2}f_{\\mathrm{single}}(\\lambda) = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left[ (1-\\lambda)\\exp(-\\lambda) \\right] = (-1)\\exp(-\\lambda) + (1-\\lambda)(-\\exp(-\\lambda)) = (-1 - 1 + \\lambda)\\exp(-\\lambda) = (\\lambda-2)\\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nAt $\\lambda=1$, the second derivative is $(1-2)\\exp(-1) = -1/e < 0$, which confirms that $\\lambda^{\\ast}=1$ corresponds to a local maximum.\n\nThe maximum fraction of singly occupied droplets, $f_{\\mathrm{single}}^{\\mathrm{max}}$, is found by substituting $\\lambda^{\\ast} = 1$ back into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{single}}(\\lambda)$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{single}}^{\\mathrm{max}} = f_{\\mathrm{single}}(1) = (1)\\exp(-1) = \\exp(-1) = \\frac{1}{e}$$\nTherefore, the optimal mean occupancy is $\\lambda^{\\ast}=1$, and the corresponding maximum fraction of singly occupied droplets is $f_{\\mathrm{single}}^{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{1}{e}$.
