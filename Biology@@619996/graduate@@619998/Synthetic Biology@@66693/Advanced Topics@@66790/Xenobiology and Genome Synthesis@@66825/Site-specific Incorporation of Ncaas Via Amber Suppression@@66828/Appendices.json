Then, briefly interpret what this value implies for the fidelity of ncAA incorporation during amber suppression at UAG in vivo (qualitative interpretation does not need to be reported in the final numeric answer).", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the substrate preference of an engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) over a competing canonical amino acid (cAA). This preference is to be determined from steady-state kinetic parameters under conditions where substrate concentrations are not saturating.\n\nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, $v$, is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the turnover number, $[E]_T$ is the total enzyme concentration, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe problem specifies that the reaction occurs under conditions where substrate concentrations are \"not saturating\". In the context of enzyme kinetics, this implies that the substrate concentration $[S]$ is much lower than the Michaelis constant $K_M$, i.e., $[S] \\ll K_M$. Under this condition, the denominator of the Michaelis-Menten equation, $K_M + [S]$, can be approximated by $K_M$. The equation for the reaction rate simplifies to:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$v \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right) [E]_T [S]$$\nThis approximation shows that when the enzyme is far from saturation, the reaction rate is directly proportional to the term $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}$. This ratio is known as the **specificity constant** or **catalytic efficiency**, and it acts as a second-order rate constant that governs the reaction between the free enzyme and the substrate. The central dogma of molecular biology dictates that the fidelity of translation depends on the ability of the aaRS to discriminate between correct (cognate) and incorrect (non-cognate) amino acids before they are attached to the tRNA. In a competitive scenario at low substrate concentrations, the relative rates of activation for two competing substrates are determined by the ratio of their specificity constants.\n\nTherefore, the preference of the aaRS for the ncAA over the cAA is given by the ratio of their respective specificity constants. Let us denote the fold preference as $P$.\n$$P = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ncAA}}}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\mathrm{cAA}}}$$\nWe are given the following kinetic parameters:\nFor the ncAA:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}, \\mathrm{ncAA}} = 3.1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$K_{M, \\mathrm{ncAA}} = 17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFor the cAA:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}, \\mathrm{cAA}} = 0.09 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$K_{M, \\mathrm{cAA}} = 130 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the specificity constant for each substrate.\nFor the ncAA:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = \\frac{3.1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nFor the cAA:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\mathrm{cAA}} = \\frac{0.09 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{130 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio of these two values.

This implies that, under conditions where both amino acids are at low concentrations, the aaRS is $263$ times more efficient at activating the desired ncAA than it is at activating the competing cAA. This high degree of specificity is a critical determinant of the fidelity of ncAA incorporation during protein synthesis. A high value signifies that mis-incorporation of the cAA at the target UAG codon will be a relatively rare event compared to the correct incorporation of the ncAA, assuming comparable intracellular concentrations of both amino acids. This is a desirable characteristic for an orthogonal translation system, as it minimizes the production of undesired protein variants and ensures the integrity of the engineered protein. However, it must be noted that the overall in vivo fidelity also depends on other factors, such as the relative intracellular concentrations of the ncAA and the pool of $20$ cAAs, and the competition with translation termination by release factors at the amber codon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{263}$$", "id": "2773657"}, {"introduction": "Once a correctly charged suppressor tRNA is available, the decisive moment occurs at the ribosome.

Plugging in the numbers: $(0.36 / 0.90) \\times 0.50 = 0.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.20$. This matches our calculated suppression efficiency. The reasoning and the result are both correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The suppression efficiency is $0.50$ because it refers to the ncAA identity among the full-length molecules only.**\nThis statement equates suppression efficiency ($\\eta_{sup}$) with the ncAA incorporation fidelity among readthrough products ($F_{ncAA}$). As shown in the derivation, $F_{ncAA} = \\eta_{sup} / P_{readthrough}$. They are not the same quantity unless $P_{readthrough} = 1$, which is not the case here ($P_{readthrough} = 0.40$). Confusing these two different conditional probabilities is a common error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Even with high suppression efficiency, the overall full-length protein yield can be low if many ribosomes fail to reach the UAG or if downstream processes reduce recovery; therefore suppression efficiency and overall full-length protein yield are distinct quantities in a multi-step expression pipeline.**\nThis is a general, qualitative statement. Our analysis demonstrates its truth. The overall normalized yield is $Y_{FL} = P_{reach} \\times (\\eta_{sup} + \\eta_{near})$. If $P_{reach}$ is low (many ribosomes fail to reach UAG), $Y_{FL}$ will be low regardless of $\\eta_{sup}$. For example, if $\\eta_{sup}$ were a high $0.80$ but $P_{reach}$ were only $0.10$, $Y_{FL}$ would be at most $0.10$. The absolute yield, not just the normalized one, is also affected by downstream processes like protein folding and stability, as the statement correctly notes. The statement's conclusion that suppression efficiency ($0.20$ in this problem) and overall full-length protein yield ($0.36$ in this problem) are distinct quantities is correct and illustrated by the problem's own data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CE}$$", "id": "2773650"}]}
