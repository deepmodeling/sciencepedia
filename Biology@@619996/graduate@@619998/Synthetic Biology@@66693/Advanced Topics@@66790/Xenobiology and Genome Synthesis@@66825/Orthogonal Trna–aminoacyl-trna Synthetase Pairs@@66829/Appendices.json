We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the rate expression for product formation, starting from first principles, for a single-substrate enzymatic reaction under the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). The elementary kinetic scheme is given by:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} E + P $$\nHere, $E$ represents the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), $S$ is the noncanonical amino acid (ncAA), $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product, the ncAA-charged tRNA. The rate constants $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$ correspond to substrate binding, substrate dissociation, and the catalytic step, respectively. The problem states that the turnover number is $k_{\\text{cat}}$, which for this simple scheme is identical to $k_2$. Thus, $k_2 = k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nThe rate of product formation, or flux ($v$), is determined by the breakdown of the $ES$ complex into product:\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\text{cat}} [ES] $$\nTo find the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$, we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation. This approximation assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over the time course of the reaction, meaning its rate of formation is equal to its rate of consumption.\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of } ES) - (\\text{rate of consumption of } ES) \\approx 0 $$\n$$ k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] = 0 $$\nSolving for $[ES]$ yields:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E][S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}} $$\nThe total concentration of enzyme, $[E]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free enzyme, $[E]$, and the enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\text{total}} = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E]_{\\text{total}} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this expression for the free enzyme concentration $[E]$ into the equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 ([E]_{\\text{total}} - [ES])[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}} $$\nWe rearrange to solve for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES](k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) = k_1 [E]_{\\text{total}}[S] - k_1[ES][S] $$\n$$ [ES]((k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) + k_1[S]) = k_1[E]_{\\text{total}}[S] $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{(k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) + k_1[S]} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_M$, is defined as $K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$.

The rate is approximately first-order in $[S]$: $v \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]$.\n2.  **Enzyme saturation** occurs when $[S] \\gg K_M$. The rate is maximal and zero-order in $[S]$: $v \\approx k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n$$ [S] = 0.120 \\ \\text{mM} $$\n$$ K_M = 0.450 \\ \\text{mM} $$\nComparing these values, we find that $[S] < K_M$. Specifically, $[S] = \\frac{0.120}{0.450} K_M \\approx 0.267 K_M$.\nSince the substrate concentration is substantially lower than the Michaelis constant, the enzyme is operating far below its maximum capacity. We can quantify this by calculating the fractional saturation of the enzyme, which is the ratio of the actual velocity $v$ to the maximal velocity $V_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ \\frac{v}{V_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]} = \\frac{0.120}{0.450 + 0.120} = \\frac{0.120}{0.570} \\approx 0.211 $$\nThe reaction is proceeding at approximately $21\\%$ of its maximum possible rate. An enzyme is considered saturated when this ratio approaches $1$. A value of $0.211$ clearly indicates that the enzyme is not saturated. The rate of the reaction is highly dependent on the concentration of the substrate, $[S]$.\nTherefore, under these conditions, the charging reaction is dominated by **substrate limitation**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{687}$$"}, {"introduction": "For an orthogonal pair to be useful, it must not only function efficiently but also operate with high fidelity, avoiding interference with the host cell's endogenous translation machinery.

Let $m_h$ be the fractional misacylation of the host tRNA, $t_h$, and $m_o$ be that of the orthogonal tRNA, $t_o$.\n\nFor the host tRNA, $t_h$, the cognate enzyme is the host aaRS, $A_h$, and the noncognate enzyme is the orthogonal aaRS, $A_o$. The charging fluxes are proportional to $k_{j,i}E_j$. The fractional misacylation is the ratio of the noncognate flux to the sum of cognate and noncognate fluxes:\n$$\nm_h = \\frac{v_{o,h}}{v_{h,h} + v_{o,h}} = \\frac{k_{o,h} E_o}{k_{h,h} E_h + k_{o,h} E_o}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant related to the tRNA concentration cancels from the ratio.

The fractional misacylation is:\n$$\nm_o = \\frac{v_{h,o}}{v_{o,o} + v_{h,o}} = \\frac{k_{h,o} E_h}{k_{o,o} E_o + k_{h,o} E_h} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{k_{o,o} E_o}{k_{h,o} E_h} + 1}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines two cognate-to-noncognate flux ratios, which we denote as $R_h$ and $R_o$:\n$$\nR_h = \\frac{k_{h,h} E_h}{k_{o,h} E_o} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R_o = \\frac{k_{o,o} E_o}{k_{h,o} E_h}\n$$\nThe misacylation fractions are thus compactly expressed as:\n$$\nm_h = \\frac{1}{R_h + 1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m_o = \\frac{1}{R_o + 1}\n$$\n\nThe crosstalk criterion requires that both misacylation fractions be less than the tolerance $\\epsilon$:\n$$\nm_h < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{1}{R_h + 1} < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad R_h + 1 > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\quad \\implies \\quad R_h > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\n$$\n$$\nm_o < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{1}{R_o + 1} < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad R_o + 1 > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\quad \\implies \\quad R_o > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\n$$\nFor the system to be considered orthogonal, both conditions must be met. This requires that the lesser of the two ratios, $R_h$ and $R_o$, must exceed $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$. The orthogonality score $S$ is defined as $S = \\min(R_h, R_o)$.

The core of the problem is to compute the misincorporation fraction at each labeling site for each possible pair of systems.\n\nLet the three orthogonal systems be indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.

The concentration of the third ncAA is zero.\n\nThe misincorporation at a genetic site designated for ncAA$_k$ (where $k \\in \\{i, j\\}$) arises from its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, aaRS$_k$, incorrectly activating the non-cognate amino acid that is present in the medium and charging it onto tRNA$_k$. The problem defines the misincorporation fraction at site $k$, which we will denote as $M_k$, as the steady-state fraction of incorporations at that site that are of the wrong ncAA among those supplied.\n\nBased on the provided premises, the rate of incorporation of a specific amino acid is proportional to the steady-state concentration of tRNA charged with that amino acid. This, in turn, is proportional to the charging flux. The problem states that the activation flux for amino acid $m$ by synthetase aaRS$_k$ is proportional to the product of the catalytic efficiency $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{M})_{km}$ and the amino acid concentration $[m]$.

The given cross-reactivity values are: $e_{12}=0.02$, $e_{13}=0.005$, $e_{21}=0.03$, $e_{23}=0.004$, $e_{31}=0.009$, and $e_{32}=0.007$.\n\nCase 1: Selection $\\{1, 2\\}$\nFor this pair, we compute the misincorporation fractions $M_1$ and $M_2$.\n$$M_1 = \\frac{e_{12}}{1 + e_{12}} = \\frac{0.02}{1 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{1.02}$$\nWe test if $M_1 < 0.01$: $\\frac{0.02}{1.02} < 0.01 \\implies 0.02 < 0.01 \\times 1.02 \\implies 0.02 < 0.0102$. This is false.\nThe condition is not met for site $1$. Therefore, this selection is not acceptable, and there is no need to check site $2$.\n\nCase 2: Selection $\\{1, 3\\}$\nFor this pair, we compute the misincorporation fractions $M_1$ and $M_3$.\n$$M_1 = \\frac{e_{13}}{1 + e_{13}} = \\frac{0.005}{1 + 0.005} = \\frac{0.005}{1.005}$$\nWe test if $M_1 < 0.01$: $\\frac{0.005}{1.005} < 0.01 \\implies 0.005 < 0.01 \\times 1.005 \\implies 0.005 < 0.01005$. This is true.\n$$M_3 = \\frac{e_{31}}{1 + e_{31}} = \\frac{0.009}{1 + 0.009} = \\frac{0.009}{1.009}$$\nWe test if $M_3 < 0.01$: $\\frac{0.009}{1.009} < 0.01 \\implies 0.009 < 0.01 \\times 1.009 \\implies 0.009 < 0.01009$. This is true.\nSince the condition is met for both sites, the selection $\\{1, 3\\}$ is acceptable.\n\nCase 3: Selection $\\{2, 3\\}$\nFor this pair, we compute the misincorporation fractions $M_2$ and $M_3$.\n$$M_2 = \\frac{e_{23}}{1 + e_{23}} = \\frac{0.004}{1 + 0.004} = \\frac{0.004}{1.004}$$\nWe test if $M_2 < 0.01$: $\\frac{0.004}{1.004} < 0.01 \\implies 0.004 < 0.01 \\times 1.004 \\implies 0.004 < 0.01004$. This is true.\n$$M_3 = \\frac{e_{32}}{1 + e_{32}} = \\frac{0.007}{1 + 0.007} = \\frac{0.007}{1.007}$$\nWe test if $M_3 < 0.01$: $\\frac{0.007}{1.007} < 0.01 \\implies 0.007 < 0.01 \\times 1.007 \\implies 0.007 < 0.01007$. This is true.\nSince the condition is met for both sites, the selection $\\{2, 3\\}$ is also acceptable.\n\nIn summary:\n- Selection $\\{1, 2\\}$: Fails.\n- Selection $\\{1, 3\\}$: Succeeds.\n- Selection $\\{2, 3\\}$: Succeeds.\n\nThe number of two-system selections that satisfy the specified requirement is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$"}]}
