A solution will be derived.\n\nThe system consists of two competitive binding equilibria for a single ligand, the orthogonal RNAP, which we will denote as E. The two types of promoters are host (h) and orthogonal (o). We are given the total concentrations of RNAP ($E_T$), host promoters ($P_T^{(h)}$), and orthogonal promoters ($P_T^{(o)}$), as well as the dissociation constants for RNAP binding to each promoter type ($K_d^{(h)}$ and $K_d^{(o)}$).\n\nLet $[E]$ be the concentration of free RNAP. Let $C_h$ and $C_o$ be the concentrations of RNAP bound to host and orthogonal promoters, respectively. The binding equilibria are described by the dissociation constants:\n$$K_{d}^{(h)} = \\frac{[E][P_h]}{C_h} \\quad (1)$$\n$$K_{d}^{(o)} = \\frac{[E][P_o]}{C_o} \\quad (2)$$\nwhere $[P_h]$ and $[P_o]$ are the concentrations of free host and orthogonal promoters.\n\nMass conservation provides the following relations:\nFor RNAP:\n$$E_T = [E] + C_h + C_o \\quad (3)$$\nFor host promoters:\n$$P_T^{(h)} = [P_h] + C_h \\quad (4)$$\nFor orthogonal promoters:\n$$P_T^{(o)} = [P_o] + C_o \\quad (5)$$\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the bound complexes, $C_h$ and $C_o$, as functions of the free RNAP concentration, $[E]$. From equation (4), we have $[P_h] = P_T^{(h)} - C_h$. Substituting this into equation (1):\n$$K_{d}^{(h)} = \\frac{[E](P_T^{(h)} - C_h)}{C_h}$$\nRearranging to solve for $C_h$:\n$$K_{d}^{(h)}C_h = [E]P_T^{(h)} - [E]C_h$$\n$$C_h(K_{d}^{(h)} + [E]) = [E]P_T^{(h)}$$\n$$C_h = \\frac{P_T^{(h)}[E]}{K_{d}^{(h)} + [E]} \\quad (6)$$\nThis is the Langmuir binding isotherm for the host promoters.\n\nBy an identical derivation for the orthogonal promoters:\n$$C_o = \\frac{P_T^{(o)}[E]}{K_{d}^{(o)} + [E]} \\quad (7)$$\n\nTo find the value of $[E]$, we substitute expressions (6) and (7) into the mass balance equation for RNAP (3):\n$$E_T = [E] + \\frac{P_T^{(h)}[E]}{K_{d}^{(h)} + [E]} + \\frac{P_T^{(o)}[E]}{K_{d}^{(o)} + [E]}$$\nThis equation has a single unknown, $[E]$. We can substitute the given numerical values (all in nM): $E_T=200$, $P_T^{(h)}=500$, $P_T^{(o)}=50$, $K_d^{(h)}=200$, $K_d^{(o)}=10$.\n$$200 = [E] + \\frac{500[E]}{200 + [E]} + \\frac{50[E]}{10 + [E]}$$\nThis is a non-linear equation for $[E]$. We can transform it into a cubic polynomial by multiplying by the denominators, but solving it requires numerical methods. Let $x = [E]$. The equation can be written as $f(x) = x + \\frac{500x}{200+x} + \\frac{50x}{10+x} - 200 = 0$. The physically meaningful root must be positive. Solving this equation numerically gives the steady-state free RNAP concentration:\n$$[E] \\approx 53.078 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nWith this value for $[E]$, we can now calculate the concentrations of the bound complexes using equations (6) and (7):\n$$C_o = \\frac{50 \\times 53.078}{10 + 53.078} = \\frac{2653.9}{63.078} \\approx 42.074 \\text{ nM}$$\n$$C_h = \\frac{500 \\times 53.078}{200 + 53.078} = \\frac{26539}{253.078} \\approx 104.865 \\text{ nM}$$\nWe can check for consistency with the RNAP mass balance: $[E] + C_h + C_o \\approx 53.078 + 104.865 + 42.074 = 200.017 \\text{ nM}$, which is consistent with $E_T=200 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the desired fraction, $f_o$:\n$$f_o = \\frac{C_o}{C_h + C_o} = \\frac{42.074}{104.865 + 42.074} = \\frac{42.074}{146.939} \\approx 0.286334$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $0.2863$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2863}$$", "id": "2756586"}, {"introduction": "While equilibrium models are useful, cellular systems are fundamentally dynamic, with component levels reflecting a balance between synthesis and removal.

Using $\\beta_{y} = 2\\delta_{y}K_{y}$, this becomes $J^{\\ast}_{21} = \\frac{2\\delta_{y}K_{y}}{4K_{x}} = \\frac{\\delta_{y}K_{y}}{2K_{x}}$.\n$J^{\\ast}_{22} = -\\delta_{y}$\n\nThe symbolic Jacobian matrix at the operating point is:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_{x} & -\\frac{n \\delta_{x} K_{x}}{2 K_{y}} \\\\ \\frac{\\delta_{y} K_{y}}{2 K_{x}} & -\\delta_{y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides the numerical values: $\\delta_{x}=0.7~\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, $\\delta_{y}=0.5~\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, $K_{x}=100~\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_{y}=50~\\mathrm{nM}$, and $n=2$.\n\nFirst, we complete the design by finding $\\beta_{x}$ and $\\beta_{y}$:\n$$\n\\beta_{x} = 2\\delta_{x}K_{x} = 2(0.7)(100) = 140~\\mathrm{nM\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{y} = 2\\delta_{y}K_{y} = 2(0.5)(50) = 50~\\mathrm{nM\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the elements of $J^{\\ast}$ numerically:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}_{11} = -0.7\n$$\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}_{12} = -\\frac{2 \\cdot 0.7 \\cdot 100}{2 \\cdot 50} = -\\frac{140}{100} = -1.4\n$$\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}_{21} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 50}{2 \\cdot 100} = \\frac{25}{200} = 0.125\n$$\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}_{22} = -0.5\n$$\nThus, the numerical Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.7 & -1.4 \\\\ 0.125 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J^{\\ast}$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J^{\\ast} - \\lambda I) = 0$, which is $\\lambda^{2} - \\mathrm{Tr}(J^{\\ast})\\lambda + \\det(J^{\\ast}) = 0$.\nThe trace is $\\mathrm{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) = -0.7 + (-0.5) = -1.2$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(J^{\\ast}) = (-0.7)(-0.5) - (-1.4)(0.125) = 0.35 + 0.175 = 0.525$.\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} - (-1.2)\\lambda + 0.525 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^{2} + 1.2\\lambda + 0.525 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-1.2 \\pm \\sqrt{(1.2)^{2} - 4(1)(0.525)}}{2} = \\frac{-1.2 \\pm \\sqrt{1.44 - 2.1}}{2} = \\frac{-1.2 \\pm \\sqrt{-0.66}}{2}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-1.2 \\pm i\\sqrt{0.66}}{2} = -0.6 \\pm i\\frac{\\sqrt{0.66}}{2}\n$$\nThe real parts of both eigenvalues are identical:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_{1}) = \\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_{2}) = -0.6\n$$\nThe largest real part of the eigenvalues is therefore $-0.6$. The units must be $\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, consistent with the units of the matrix entries.
