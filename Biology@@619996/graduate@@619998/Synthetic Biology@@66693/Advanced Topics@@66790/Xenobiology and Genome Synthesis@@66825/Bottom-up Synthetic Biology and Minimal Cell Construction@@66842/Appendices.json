It describes a standard and fundamental problem in statistical biophysics and synthetic biology, specifically related to the stochastic nature of molecular encapsulation. The assumptions provided are standard for modeling such systems:\n1.  The use of molar concentration $c_i$, volume $V$, and Avogadro's constant $N_A$ is standard chemistry.\n2.  The assumption that the number of encapsulated molecules follows a Poisson distribution is a correct and widely used limit of the binomial distribution for rare events (encapsulating a specific molecule) from a large population (the reservoir). This is physically and mathematically sound.\n3.  The assumption of independent loading for different components is a common starting point for such models and makes the problem tractable.\n\nThe problem contains no scientific fallacies, is not based on subjective claims, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. The units are consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that a vesicle contains at least one molecule of each of the $k$ specified components. Let us denote this probability as $P_{\\text{success}}$.\n\nWe begin by considering a single molecular component, indexed by $i$. The problem states that the number of molecules of this component within a vesicle follows a Poisson distribution. We must first determine the parameter of this distribution, which is its mean, typically denoted by $\\lambda_i$. The mean, $\\lambda_i$, represents the average number of molecules of component $i$ expected to be found in a vesicle of volume $V$.\n\nThe molar concentration $c_i$ is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution. The number concentration (molecules per liter) is therefore $c_i N_A$. The average number of molecules of component $i$ in a volume $V$ is the product of the number concentration and the volume:\n$$ \\lambda_i = (c_i N_A) V $$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{L})$, which correctly results in a dimensionless quantity representing a count.\n\nLet $n_i$ be the random variable for the number of molecules of component $i$ in a vesicle. According to the problem's assumption, $n_i$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_i$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$ P(n_i = m) = \\frac{\\lambda_i^m \\exp(-\\lambda_i)}{m!} $$\nfor $m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nWe are interested in the event that there is *at least one* molecule of component $i$ in the vesicle. This corresponds to the probability $P(n_i \\ge 1)$. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is finding *zero* molecules of component $i$, or $P(n_i = 0)$.\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function for $m=0$:\n$$ P(n_i = 0) = \\frac{\\lambda_i^0 \\exp(-\\lambda_i)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda_i)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda_i) $$\nThe probability of finding at least one molecule is therefore:\n$$ P(n_i \\ge 1) = 1 - P(n_i = 0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_i) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_i$:\n$$ P(n_i \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-c_i V N_A) $$\n\nThe problem requires finding the probability that a vesicle contains at least one copy of *each* of the $k$ distinct components. Let $E_i$ be the event that a vesicle contains at least one molecule of component $i$. We seek the probability of the joint event $P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap E_k)$.\n\nAccording to assumption (iii), the loading of different components is independent. This means that the events $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{k}$ are mutually independent. For independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$ P_{\\text{success}} = P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap E_k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} P(E_i) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(E_i) = P(n_i \\ge 1)$ that we derived:\n$$ P_{\\text{success}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\left(1 - \\exp(-c_i V N_A)\\right) $$\n\nThis is the final, closed-form analytical expression for the probability that a randomly formed vesicle contains at least one copy of each of the $k$ distinct components.

The core of the problem lies in the correct application of the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model under a specified boundary condition.\n\nThe fundamental equation for Michaelis-Menten kinetics describes the reaction rate, $v$, as a function of substrate concentration, $[\\text{S}]$:\n$$v = \\frac{v_{\\text{max}} [\\text{S}]}{K_M + [\\text{S}]}$$\nHere, $v$ is the intensive reaction rate (concentration per time, e.g., $\\text{M s}^{-1}$), $v_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum reaction rate, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.
