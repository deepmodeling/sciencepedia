Assume balanced exponential growth at steady state with growth rate $\\lambda$.\n\nAdopt the following foundational framework, which has been repeatedly validated for bacterial growth and proteome allocation: (i) the proteome is partitioned into a ribosomal sector with fraction $\\phi_{R}$, a metabolic sector with fraction $\\phi_{P}$, a constant housekeeping sector with fraction $\\phi_{U}$ (independent of $\\lambda$ and $\\phi$), and the synthetic load $\\phi$; (ii) proteome fractions sum to unity; (iii) the Scottâ€“Hwa bacterial growth laws hold, namely that the steady-state ribosomal fraction and metabolic fraction vary linearly with $\\lambda$ through the translational capacity $\\kappa_{t}$ and the nutritional capacity $\\kappa_{n}$, with nonzero offsets corresponding to inactive ribosomes and basal metabolism, respectively. Specifically, there exist constants $\\phi_{R}^{0}$ and $\\phi_{P}^{0}$ such that the active allocations required to support growth satisfy linear relations with $\\lambda$ via $\\kappa_{t}$ and $\\kappa_{n}$; (iv) for a stable heterologous product whose degradation is negligible on the growth timescale, the steady-state per-biomass synthesis flux equals the dilution flux by growth.\n\nUsing only these bases and standard mass-balance reasoning, derive, in closed form, expressions for:\n- the steady-state growth rate $\\lambda$ as a function of the added proteomic sector load $\\phi$ and the physiological parameters $\\kappa_{t}$, $\\kappa_{n}$, $\\phi_{R}^{0}$, $\\phi_{P}^{0}$, and $\\phi_{U}$;\n- the steady-state per-biomass synthesis flux of the therapeutic protein, $J(\\phi)$, expressed as a function of $\\phi$ and the same physiological parameters, under the assumption of negligible active degradation;\n- the collapse threshold $\\phi_{c}$, defined as the largest value of $\\phi$ for which nonnegative growth is possible under the model.\n\nAssume the parameter regime is physiologically consistent, i.e., $1 - \\phi_{U} - \\phi_{R}^{0} - \\phi_{P}^{0} > 0$.

The dilution flux of a component with concentration $C$ is given by $\\lambda C$. Thus, $J = \\lambda C$. The concentration $C$ refers to the amount of the therapeutic protein per unit total biomass.\nWithin this modeling framework, the concentration of a proteome sector is represented by its fractional allocation. The heterologous protein fraction of the total proteome is $\\phi$. Assuming the total proteome constitutes a constant fraction of the total cell biomass, the concentration of the heterologous protein per unit biomass is directly proportional to $\\phi$. The problem does not provide this proportionality constant. The most parsimonious interpretation, consistent with the standard formulation of such models, is to define the \"concentration\" in the flux balance equation as the proteome fraction $\\phi$ itself. This implies that the synthesis flux $J(\\phi)$ is defined as the rate of synthesis of the heterologous protein mass normalized by the total proteome mass. Therefore, we set $C = \\phi$.\nUnder this interpretation, the synthesis flux is:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\lambda(\\phi) \\cdot \\phi\n$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $\\lambda(\\phi)$:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\phi \\frac{\\kappa_{t} \\kappa_{n}}{\\kappa_{t} + \\kappa_{n}} \\left(1 - \\phi_{U} - \\phi_{R}^{0} - \\phi_{P}^{0} - \\phi\\right)\n$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\n**Derivation of the Collapse Threshold $\\phi_{c}$**\nThe collapse threshold, $\\phi_{c}$, is defined as the largest value of the synthetic load $\\phi$ for which non-negative growth is possible, i.e., $\\lambda(\\phi) \\geq 0$. This threshold corresponds to the point where growth ceases, so we must solve for the value of $\\phi$ where $\\lambda(\\phi) = 0$.\n$$\n\\lambda(\\phi_{c}) = \\frac{\\kappa_{t} \\kappa_{n}}{\\kappa_{t} + \\kappa_{n}} \\left(1 - \\phi_{U} - \\phi_{R}^{0} - \\phi_{P}^{0} - \\phi_{c}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the physiological parameters $\\kappa_{t}$ and $\\kappa_{n}$ are strictly positive, the term $\\frac{\\kappa_{t} \\kappa_{n}}{\\kappa_{t} + \\kappa_{n}}$ is also strictly positive.

Calculation of Prevalence Thresholds $p_{\\min}$ and $p_{\\max}$**\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical values of $\\mathrm{Se}$ and $\\mathrm{Sp}$ using the given parameters: $c = 0.85$, $r = 0.90$, $f_b = 0.02$, $a_{\\mathrm{tp}} = 0.97$, $a_{\\mathrm{fp}} = 0.01$.\n$rc = 0.90 \\times 0.85 = 0.765$.\n$\\mathrm{Se} = 0.97(0.765) + 0.01(1 - 0.765) = 0.74205 + 0.01(0.235) = 0.74205 + 0.00235 = 0.7444$.\n$f_b c = 0.02 \\times 0.85 = 0.017$.\n$\\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - [0.97(0.017) + 0.01(1 - 0.017)] = 1 - [0.01649 + 0.01(0.983)] = 1 - [0.01649 + 0.00983] = 1 - 0.02632 = 0.97368$.\n\nTo find $p_{\\min}$, we solve $\\mathrm{PPV}(p) \\geq 0.80$. Since $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $p$, $p_{\\min}$ is found by solving for equality:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p)} = 0.80 $$\n$$ p \\cdot \\mathrm{Se} = 0.80 \\cdot (\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p)) $$\n$$ p \\cdot \\mathrm{Se} (1 - 0.80) = 0.80 \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p) $$\n$$ p \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot \\mathrm{Se} = 0.80 \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) - 0.80 \\cdot p \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) $$\n$$ p(0.20 \\cdot \\mathrm{Se} + 0.80 \\cdot(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})) = 0.80 \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) $$\n$$ p_{\\min} = \\frac{0.80(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})}{0.20 \\cdot \\mathrm{Se} + 0.80(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})} $$\nSubstituting values: $1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.02632$ and $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.7444$.\n$$ p_{\\min} = \\frac{0.80(0.02632)}{0.20(0.7444) + 0.80(0.02632)} = \\frac{0.021056}{0.14888 + 0.021056} = \\frac{0.021056}{0.169936} \\approx 0.123905 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $p_{\\min} = 0.1239$.\n\nTo find $p_{\\max}$, we solve $\\mathrm{NPV}(p) \\geq 0.95$. Since $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $p$, $p_{\\max}$ is found by solving for equality:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot (1-p)}{\\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot (1-p) + (1-\\mathrm{Se})p} = 0.95 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Sp}(1 - p) = 0.95 (\\mathrm{Sp}(1 - p) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se})p) $$\n$$ (1-p) \\mathrm{Sp} (1 - 0.95) = 0.95 \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{Se})p $$\n$$ 0.05 \\cdot \\mathrm{Sp} (1-p) = 0.95 \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{Se})p $$\n$$ 0.05 \\cdot \\mathrm{Sp} = p(0.05 \\cdot \\mathrm{Sp} + 0.95(1 - \\mathrm{Se})) $$\n$$ p_{\\max} = \\frac{0.05 \\cdot \\mathrm{Sp}}{0.05 \\cdot \\mathrm{Sp} + 0.95(1 - \\mathrm{Se})} $$\nSubstituting values: $1 - \\mathrm{Se} = 1 - 0.7444 = 0.2556$ and $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.97368$.\n$$ p_{\\max} = \\frac{0.05(0.97368)}{0.05(0.97368) + 0.95(0.2556)} = \\frac{0.048684}{0.048684 + 0.24282} = \\frac{0.048684}{0.291504} \\approx 0.166992 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $p_{\\max} = 0.1670$.\n\nThe prevalence thresholds are thus $p_{\\min} = 0.1239$ and $p_{\\max} = 0.1670$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1239 & 0.1670\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "2732160"}]}
