The core of the biosensor is a genetic circuit where a powerful ammonia-repressible promoter from a nitrogen-fixing organism controls the expression of a gene encoding a vibrant blue chromoprotein. In the absence of ammonium ($NH_4^+$), the promoter is highly active, leading to the production of the blue protein. As ammonium concentration increases, it binds to a regulatory protein which in turn represses the promoter, shutting down protein synthesis.\n\nThe dynamics of the intracellular concentration of the blue chromoprotein, $[C]$, can be modeled by the following differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{prod}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n} - k_{deg}[C]\n$$\nHere, $[NH_4^+]$ is the external ammonium concentration.

Steady state is achieved when the rate of change of the concentration is zero, i.e., $\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = 0$.\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{prod}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n} - k_{deg}[C]\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero for steady state:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{k_{prod}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n} - k_{deg}[C]_{ss}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $[C]_{ss}$:\n$$\nk_{deg}[C]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{prod}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n}\n$$\n$$\n[C]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n} \\right)\n$$\nNext, we determine the maximum possible steady-state concentration, $[C]_{max}$. This maximum occurs when the repression term is minimized. The production term $\\frac{k_{prod}}{1 + ([NH_4^+]/K_m)^n}$ is maximized when the denominator is minimized. This happens when the concentration of the repressor, ammonium, is zero, i.e., $[NH_4^+] = 0$.\nSubstituting $[NH_4^+] = 0$ into the expression for $[C]_{ss}$:\n$$\n[C]_{max} = \\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{0}{K_m}\\right)^n} \\right) = \\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + 0} \\right) = \\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the biosensor is \"active\" when $[C]_{ss} \\ge 0.80 \\times [C]_{max}$. We are looking for the maximum $[NH_4^+]$ that satisfies this condition, so we can use the equality:\n$$\n[C]_{ss} = 0.80 \\times [C]_{max}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions we derived for $[C]_{ss}$ and $[C]_{max}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n} \\right) = 0.80 \\times \\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_{prod}}{k_{deg}}$ is present on both sides and can be canceled out:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n} = 0.80\n$$\nNow we solve for $[NH_4^+]$. First, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\n1 + \\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{0.80} = 1.25\n$$\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m}\\right)^n = 1.25 - 1 = 0.25\n$$\nNow, take the $n$-th root of both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{[NH_4^+]}{K_m} = (0.25)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nFinally, multiply by $K_m$ to isolate $[NH_4^+]$:\n$$\n[NH_4^+] = K_m \\times (0.25)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values: $K_m = 100$ µM and $n = 2$.\n$$\n[NH_4^+] = 100 \\, \\text{µM} \\times (0.25)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\n$$\n[NH_4^+] = 100 \\, \\text{µM} \\times \\sqrt{0.25}\n$$\n$$\n[NH_4^+] = 100 \\, \\text{µM} \\times 0.5\n$$\n$$\n[NH_4^+] = 50.0 \\, \\text{µM}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The expression of the *nif* operon is tightly regulated by the NifL-NifA two-component system, which represses transcription via NifA in response to low cellular energy status or the presence of fixed nitrogen.\n\nBased on the integrated analysis of all the provided data, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for the loss of the nitrogen-fixing phenotype in the evolved strain?\n\nA. The P432L mutation in the *pgi* gene product (Phosphoglucose Isomerase) severely impairs its enzymatic function, creating a bottleneck in glycolysis. This leads to a catastrophic deficit in cellular ATP and reducing equivalents, which triggers the NifL-NifA regulatory system to shut down the transcription of the energetically demanding *nif* genes.\n\nB. The P432L mutation in the *pgi* gene has created a novel allosteric binding site for the NifA protein, causing NifA to be sequestered and preventing it from activating transcription of the *nif* operon.\n\nC. The accumulation of Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), caused by the non-functional Phosphoglucose Isomerase, acts as a direct competitive inhibitor for the nitrogenase enzyme complex, preventing it from binding its substrates even if it were expressed.\n\nD. The P432L mutation in *pgi* is incidental. The true cause is an unobserved mutation that compromises the cell's anaerobic respiratory chain, leading to a buildup of trace intracellular oxygen which irreversibly inactivates the nitrogenase enzyme post-translationally.\n\nE. The block in glycolysis caused by the *pgi* mutation prevents the synthesis of a critical amino acid precursor that is essential for the assembly of the nitrogenase enzyme's iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco), leading to the production of an inactive apoenzyme.", "solution": "We proceed by integrating the genetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic evidence with the known regulatory and energetic requirements of nitrogen fixation, making each causal step explicit.\n\n1) Interpret the sole chromosomal mutation and its metabolic consequence.\n- The only host mutation is a non-synonymous change in the *pgi* gene, encoding phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). PGI catalyzes the reversible interconversion:\n$$\\text{G6P} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{F6P}.$$\n- The evolved strain shows a marked metabolite imbalance: G6P is elevated by a factor of 12.5 while F6P is reduced to 0.08 of the ancestor level. This pattern is diagnostic of an impaired forward flux from G6P to F6P, i.e., a bottleneck at PGI. The unchanged *pgi* transcript (log2 fold change approximately zero) supports that the defect is post-transcriptional (enzyme function), consistent with the P432L substitution compromising catalysis or stability rather than expression.\n\n2) Connect the PGI bottleneck to cellular energy and reducing power.\n- In anaerobiosis, ATP generation depends primarily on glycolytic substrate-level phosphorylation. When flux from hexose phosphates into lower glycolysis is curtailed by a block at PGI, the glycolytic throughput drops, decreasing ATP production. This is reflected by the reduced ATP/ADP ratio (0.15 relative to ancestor).\n- Reducing power for biosynthesis and nitrogen fixation depends on NADPH. Although the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway can generate NADPH from G6P, the observed $\\text{NADPH}/\\text{NADP}^+$ ratio is substantially reduced (0.20), indicating that net NADPH supply is insufficient relative to demand. A PGI block disrupts efficient carbon cycling between hexose phosphates and the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, limiting balanced flux and compounding redox stress under xylose minimal medium. The slight increases in expression of PPP enzymes (*zwf*, *pgl*, *gnd*) are minor and do not compensate for the global energy/redox shortfall, as shown by the metabolite ratios.\n\n3) Relate energetic/redox status to NifL–NifA regulation and nif transcription.\n- Nitrogenase requires at least $16$ ATP and $8$ high-energy electrons per $\\text{N}_{2}$ reduced:\n$$\\text{ATP consumption rate} = 16\\,v_{\\text{N}_{2}}, \\quad \\text{electron demand} = 8\\,v_{\\text{N}_{2}},$$\nwhere $v_{\\text{N}_{2}}$ is the rate of $\\text{N}_{2}$ reduction to $\\text{NH}_{3}$. Under low ATP and low NADPH, sustaining any significant $v_{\\text{N}_{2}}$ is energetically prohibitive.\n- The NifL–NifA system represses *nif* transcription when energy/redox status is unfavorable or fixed nitrogen is present. The data show profound repression of both the activator and structural genes:\n$$\\log_{2}\\text{(fold change)}(\\textit{nifA}) \\approx -4.0,\\quad \\log_{2}\\text{(fold change)}(\\textit{nifHDK}) \\approx -6.0,$$\nwhich is consistent with NifL-mediated inhibition of NifA activity and consequent collapse of *nif* transcription under energy/redox limitation.\n- The low glutamine level (0.10 relative) indicates poor ammonia assimilation, fully consistent with inactive nitrogen fixation and global energy limitation rather than direct enzyme poisoning or oxygen damage.\n\n4) Evaluate and exclude alternative explanations using provided evidence.\n- Option B (novel allosteric sequestration of NifA by mutant PGI) is speculative and unsupported; moreover, it does not explain the characteristic G6P/F6P imbalance or the global energy/redox deficit.\n- Option C (G6P as a competitive inhibitor of nitrogenase) is inconsistent with the data: the primary defect is transcriptional silencing (drastic drops in *nifA* and *nifHDK* mRNA), not post-translational inhibition of an abundantly expressed enzyme.\n- Option D (cryptic respiratory-chain mutation causing oxygen exposure) contradicts the intact transcriptome profile of respiratory genes and, critically, does not account for the specific PGI-associated metabolite pattern. Oxygen inactivation would not necessarily suppress *nif* transcripts to the observed extent in the absence of a regulatory trigger; the data instead match NifL–NifA repression by energy/redox signals.\n- Option E (loss of a critical amino acid precursor for FeMoco) is inconsistent with the transcriptomic signature of regulatory repression, and FeMoco biosynthesis depends on homocitrate and metal–sulfur cluster assembly rather than a single missing amino acid precursor generated uniquely downstream of PGI. Moreover, the dominant signals are energy and redox limitation upstream of any cofactor assembly bottleneck.\n\n5) Synthesis.\n- The sole coding mutation in *pgi* explains the measured accumulation of G6P and depletion of F6P, demonstrating a glycolytic bottleneck.\n- This bottleneck reduces ATP production and disrupts redox balance, as captured by the decreased ATP/ADP and $\\text{NADPH}/\\text{NADP}^+$ ratios.\n- NifL, sensing unfavorable energetic/redox conditions, prevents NifA from activating the *nif* operon, which is reflected in the profound reduction of *nifA* and *nifHDK* transcripts.\n- Therefore, the most accurate and comprehensive explanation is that the *pgi* P432L mutation cripples glycolytic flux, causing an energy/reducing-equivalent crisis that triggers NifL–NifA mediated repression of nitrogen fixation.\n\nThis chain of evidence uniquely supports option A and contradicts the alternatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2050979"}]}
