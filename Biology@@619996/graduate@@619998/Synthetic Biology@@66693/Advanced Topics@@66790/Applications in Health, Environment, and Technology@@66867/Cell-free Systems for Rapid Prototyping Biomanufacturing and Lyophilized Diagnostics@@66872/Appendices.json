It presents a standard scenario in enzyme kinetics where the total enzyme concentration is not negligible compared to the total substrate concentration, requiring a more rigorous derivation than the standard Michaelis–Menten approximation.

The problem is therefore valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe enzymatic reaction is described by the scheme:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_{1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\text{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P $$\nwhere $E$ is the enzyme T7 RNAP, $S$ is the DNA template (substrate), $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product mRNA. The initial rate of product formation, $v_{0}$, is given by:\n$$ v_{0} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES] $$\nTo find $v_{0}$, we must first determine the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$, under the given conditions. We apply the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) to the $ES$ complex, which posits that its concentration remains approximately constant after a brief initial phase. Thus, its rate of formation equals its rate of breakdown:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] = 0 $$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$ k_{1}[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] $$\nDividing by $k_{1}$ and defining the Michaelis constant $K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}$, we obtain the familiar relationship:\n$$ [E][S] = K_{M}[ES] $$\nThe problem specifies that the assumption $[S]_{T} \\gg [E]_{T}$ cannot be made. Therefore, we must use the exact mass balance equations for the total enzyme concentration $[E]_{T}$ and total substrate concentration $[S]_{T}$:\n$$ [E]_{T} = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E]_{T} - [ES] $$\n$$ [S]_{T} = [S] + [ES] \\implies [S] = [S]_{T} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting these expressions for the free concentrations $[E]$ and $[S]$ into the QSSA-derived equation yields:\n$$ ([E]_{T} - [ES])([S]_{T} - [ES]) = K_{M}[ES] $$\nExpanding the left side of the equation results in a quadratic equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{T}[S]_{T} - [E]_{T}[ES] - [S]_{T}[ES] + [ES]^2 = K_{M}[ES] $$\nRearranging this into standard quadratic form, $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$, with $x = [ES]$, we get:\n$$ [ES]^2 - ([E]_{T} + [S]_{T} + K_{M})[ES] + [E]_{T}[S]_{T} = 0 $$\nThis equation can be solved for $[ES]$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{ -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a} $$\nHere, $a=1$, $b = -([E]_{T} + [S]_{T} + K_{M})$, and $c = [E]_{T}[S]_{T}$.

The concentration of the complex, $[ES]$, cannot exceed either the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{T}$, or the total substrate concentration, $[S]_{T}$.

The negative root correctly yields $[ES] = 0$.

This form is derived under the assumption that the concentration of free substrate, $[S]$, is approximately equal to the total substrate concentration, $[S]_{T}$. This assumption, $[S] \\approx [S]_{T}$, is valid only when the amount of substrate bound to the enzyme, $[ES]$, is negligible compared to the total substrate concentration, i.e., $[ES] \\ll [S]_{T}$. Since the concentration of the complex $[ES]$ is always less than or equal to the total enzyme concentration $[E]_{T}$, a sufficient condition for the validity of the simple Michaelis-Menten equation is that the total enzyme concentration is much less than the total substrate concentration: $[E]_{T} \\ll [S]_{T}$.\n\nIn this problem, the given concentrations are $[E]_{T} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[S]_{T} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. The condition $[E]_{T} \\ll [S]_{T}$ is not only unmet but is severely violated, as $[E]_{T} = 5 \\times [S]_{T}$.
