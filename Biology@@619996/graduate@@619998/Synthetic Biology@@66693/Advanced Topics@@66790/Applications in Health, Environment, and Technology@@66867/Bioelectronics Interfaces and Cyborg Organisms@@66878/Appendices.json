It relies on established principles of electronics and neurophysiology. We shall proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) before and after a modification of the recording electrode. We begin by stating the fundamental principles required.\n\n$1$. The signal-to-noise ratio in decibels ($dB$) for voltage signals is defined based on the ratio of signal power to noise power. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage ($P \\propto V^2$), the SNR in decibels is given by:\n$$SNR_{\\text{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{signal}}}{P_{\\text{noise}}} \\right) = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{signal,rms}}}{V_{\\text{noise,rms}}} \\right)^2 \\right) = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{signal,rms}}}{V_{\\text{noise,rms}}} \\right)$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{signal,rms}}$ and $V_{\\text{noise,rms}}$ are the root-mean-square (RMS) voltages of the signal and the noise, respectively.\n\n$2$. The problem states that the neural spike may be approximated as a sinusoid for the purpose of converting its peak-to-peak voltage ($V_{\\text{pp}}$) to its RMS voltage ($V_{\\text{rms}}$). For a sinusoidal waveform, the relationship is:\n$$V_{\\text{rms}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{pp}}}{2\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\n$3$. The problem states that the dominant noise source is the electrode and directs us to use the Johnson-Nyquist scaling of thermal noise with resistance. The RMS voltage of Johnson-Nyquist noise is given by $V_{n} = \\sqrt{4k_{B}TR\\Delta f}$, where $R$ is the resistance (real part of impedance), $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\Delta f$ is the bandwidth. From this relationship, it is evident that the noise voltage scales with the square root of the resistance:\n$$V_{n,\\text{rms}} \\propto \\sqrt{R}$$\n\nWe now apply these principles to the given data.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial SNR. The spike amplitude is given as $V_{\\text{signal,pp}} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$.

Let the initial electrode impedance (its resistive component) be $R_{\\text{initial}}$ and the final impedance be $R_{\\text{final}}$. We are given $R_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\text{initial}}$.\nAccording to the Johnson-Nyquist noise scaling, the noise RMS voltage is proportional to the square root of the resistance. Therefore, the new noise voltage $V_{\\text{noise,rms,final}}$ is related to the initial noise voltage $V_{\\text{noise,rms,initial}}$ as follows:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{noise,rms,final}}}{V_{\\text{noise,rms,initial}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{final}}}{R_{\\text{initial}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}R_{\\text{initial}}}{R_{\\text{initial}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThus, the new noise voltage is:\n$$V_{\\text{noise,rms,final}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{noise,rms,initial}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe problem states that the spike amplitude at the amplifier input is unaffected by the change in electrode impedance. This is a reasonable assumption given the high input impedance of the amplifier, which forms a voltage divider with the electrode impedance.
