It describes a classic surface erosion phenomenon based on mass conservation, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution. The scenario is a direct application of enzyme kinetics to materials science, a valid interdisciplinary problem. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the film thinning rate, $v$, based on the principle of mass conservation at the receding PET-water interface. Let us consider a small, representative planar area $A$ of the PET film. The mass of a differential layer of thickness $dL$ over this area is given by $dm$:\n$$dm = \\rho \\cdot dV = \\rho \\cdot A \\cdot dL$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density of the solid PET. The rate of change of mass of the film due to erosion is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\rho A \\frac{dL}{dt}$$\nThis rate of mass loss must be equal to the rate at which mass is removed from the surface by the enzymatic action of the biofilm. The problem provides the surface molar flux of PET repeat units, $k_{s}$, with units of $\\text{mol}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. To convert this molar flux to a mass flux, $J_{m}$, we must multiply by the molar mass of the repeat unit, $M_{\\text{rep}}$:\n$$J_{m} = k_{s} \\cdot M_{\\text{rep}}$$\nThe total mass of PET removed from the area $A$ per unit time is the mass flux multiplied by the area:\n$$\\text{Rate of mass removal} = J_{m} \\cdot A = (k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}) A$$\nBy conservation of mass, the rate of mass loss from the film, which is $-\\frac{dm}{dt}$ (the negative sign indicates a decrease in mass), must equal the rate of mass removal from the surface.\n$$-\\frac{dm}{dt} = (k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}) A$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{dm}{dt}$:\n$$-\\left(\\rho A \\frac{dL}{dt}\\right) = k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}} A$$\nThe area $A$ is a common factor on both sides and cancels, which is expected for a process of uniform erosion over a large sheet:\n$$-\\rho \\frac{dL}{dt} = k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}$$\nThe problem defines the thinning rate as $v = -\\frac{dL}{dt}$. Substituting this definition into our equation yields:\n$$\\rho v = k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}$$\nSolving for the thinning rate $v$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}}{\\rho}$$\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically.

Our derived expression is $v = \\frac{k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}}{\\rho}$. The molar mass $M_{\\text{rep}}$ and density $\\rho$ are intrinsic material properties, assumed constant. Therefore, the thinning rate $v$ is constant if and only if the surface molar flux $k_{s}$ is constant. The problem statement specifies that the system is under \"saturating substrate conditions.\" In the context of enzyme kinetics, which governs this system, this corresponds to the regime where the substrate concentration is much greater than the Michaelis-Menten constant, $K_M$. For a surface reaction, the \"substrate\" is the available surface area of PET. Saturation implies that the enzymatic depolymerization rate per unit area does not depend on the amount of material remaining (i.e., the thickness $L$), but is proceeding at its maximum possible velocity, $V_{\\text{max}}$. Under these conditions, the rate of monomer release per unit area, $k_{s}$, is constant. This leads to a constant thinning velocity $v$, corresponding to a zero-order dependence on film thickness, described by the differential equation $\\frac{dL}{dt} = -v$. This approximation is valid as long as the surface remains saturated, the biofilm's enzymatic activity is steady, and there are no significant changes to the surface morphology or chemistry that would inhibit the reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.805}$$", "id": "2737045"}, {"introduction": "Effective bioremediation extends beyond simply breaking down a polymer; the resulting monomers must be fully mineralized by the engineered microbes.

The culture’s substrate uptake is constrained by the reactor feed to exactly $1.00$ mmol TPA per gram dry weight per hour ($1.00$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$).

It is a standard problem in metabolic engineering and stoichiometry. We will therefore proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe first task is to determine the stoichiometric coefficient for the complete aerobic mineralization of terephthalic acid (TPA), which has the chemical formula $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_6\\text{O}_4$. The problem specifies that the only products are carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).

To conserve carbon, all $8$ atoms must be converted to $\\text{CO}_2$. Therefore:\n    $$\\nu_{\\text{CO}_2} = 8$$\n\n2.  **Hydrogen (H) conservation**: There are $6$ atoms of hydrogen in one molecule of TPA. These are converted to water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$), which contains $2$ hydrogen atoms per molecule. Thus:\n    $$6 = 2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$$\n    $$\\nu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\n\n3.  **Oxygen (O) conservation**: Now we balance the oxygen atoms. On the reactant side, we have $4$ atoms from TPA and $2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{O}_2}$ atoms from molecular oxygen. On the product side, we have $2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{CO}_2}$ atoms from carbon dioxide and $1 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$ atoms from water. The balance is:\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = 2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{CO}_2} + \\nu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$$\n    Substituting the values for $\\nu_{\\text{CO}_2}$ and $\\nu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$ we just found:\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = 2 \\cdot (8) + 3$$\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = 16 + 3$$\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = 19$$\n    $$2 \\cdot \\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = 19 - 4 = 15$$\n    $$\\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5$$\n\nThe stoichiometric coefficient of $\\text{O}_2$ required per mole of TPA is $7.5$. The fully balanced equation is:\n$$\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_6\\text{O}_4 + 7.5 \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 8 \\text{CO}_2 + 3 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\n\nThe second task is to calculate the maximum oxygen uptake rate ($v_{\\text{O}_2}$) required to sustain complete mineralization given a TPA uptake rate ($v_{\\text{TPA}}$) of $1.00$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$. The problem states no biomass is formed and there is no intracellular storage, so all consumed TPA is catabolized. The required oxygen uptake rate is stoichiometrically linked to the TPA uptake rate.\n\nThe relationship is:\n$$v_{\\text{O}_2} = v_{\\text{TPA}} \\times \\nu_{\\text{O}_2}$$\nGiven:\n$$v_{\\text{TPA}} = 1.00 \\text{ mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}$$\nUsing the derived stoichiometric coefficient $\\nu_{\\text{O}_2} = 7.5$:\n$$v_{\\text{O}_2} = (1.00 \\text{ mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}) \\times 7.5$$\n$$v_{\\text{O}_2} = 7.50 \\text{ mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}$$\nThe input value $1.00$ has three significant figures, and the stoichiometric coefficient is an exact number. Therefore, the result must be reported to three significant figures.\n\nThe final task is a qualitative justification based on first principles. Flux balance analysis (FBA) operates on the principle of a steady state, where the production and consumption of each internal metabolite are balanced. This is expressed by the matrix equation $S \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\vec{0}$, where $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix and $\\vec{v}$ is the vector of metabolic fluxes.\nComplete oxidation of an organic substrate such as TPA is the most energetically favorable catabolic process. It involves the transfer of electrons from the substrate to an electron transport chain, with $\\text{O}_2$ acting as the terminal electron acceptor. This process regenerates oxidized cofactors (e.g., $\\text{NAD}^+$, $\\text{FAD}$) from their reduced forms (e.g., $\\text{NADH}$, $\\text{FADH}_2$), which are essential for the catabolic pathways (e.g., Krebs cycle) to continue operating.\n\nIf the oxygen uptake rate is bounded, $v_{\\text{O}_2}  7.50$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$, while the TPA uptake remains fixed at $v_{\\text{TPA}} = 1.00$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$, the cell faces a critical problem: a redox imbalance. There is insufficient $\\text{O}_2$ to accept all electrons liberated from the complete oxidation of the consumed TPA. Consequently, the electron transport chain cannot re-oxidize all the $\\text{NADH}$ and $\\text{FADH}_2$ produced. The cellular pool of oxidized cofactors ($\\text{NAD}^+$, $\\text{FAD}$) would be depleted, while the pool of reduced cofactors ($\\text{NADH}$, $\\text{FADH}_2$) would accumulate. This would inhibit cofactor-dependent dehydrogenases in central metabolism, halting catabolism and violating the steady-state assumption.\n\nTo maintain a steady state ($S \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\vec{0}$), the metabolic network must re-route fluxes to alternative pathways that consume reducing equivalents without using oxygen. This is the fundamental principle of fermentation or overflow metabolism. The optimal flux distribution, as would be predicted by FBA, would exhibit the following adaptations:\n1.  **Incomplete Oxidation**: Flux through the full Krebs cycle and terminal oxidative phosphorylation would decrease. Carbon skeletons derived from TPA would not be fully oxidized to $\\text{CO}_2$.\n2.  **Secretion of Byproducts**: To dispose of excess carbon and electrons, the cell will synthesize and secrete partially oxidized fermentation products. Common byproducts include acetate, lactate, succinate, or ethanol. The synthesis of these compounds from intermediates of central metabolism (e.g., pyruvate, acetyl-CoA) requires the consumption of $\\text{NADH}$, thereby regenerating the $\\text{NAD}^+$ necessary to sustain glycolysis and other upstream catabolic reactions.\n3.  **Redox Cofactor Balance**: The overall flux distribution will shift to ensure the net production rate of reduced cofactors is exactly balanced by their consumption rate through both the limited aerobic respiration and the newly activated anaerobic (fermentative) pathways. The result is a less efficient metabolism, as the carbon and energy stored in the secreted byproducts are lost to the cell.\n\nIn summary, an oxygen uptake constraint below the stoichiometric requirement forces a metabolic shift away from complete mineralization. The system sacrifices carbon efficiency to maintain redox homeostasis, a non-negotiable requirement for sustained metabolic activity at steady state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.50}\n$$", "id": "2737084"}, {"introduction": "To evaluate the true environmental impact of a bioremediation strategy, we must scale our understanding from the cellular level to the ecosystem.

Formulation of the Governing Equation**\n\nWe begin by establishing a mass balance for the microplastic concentration $C$ within a differential control volume element of the river, from coordinate $x$ to $x+dx$. The total flux of microplastics, $J_{total}$, is the sum of the advective flux, $J_{adv} = vC$, and the diffusive flux, $J_{diff} = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$.\n$$\nJ_{total}(x) = vC(x) - D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nThe principle of conservation of mass for a steady-state system ($\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$) states that the net rate of change of mass within the control volume is zero. This means the rate of mass entering the volume must equal the rate of mass leaving the volume plus the rate of mass lost to reaction. The reaction rate is given as a first-order sink term, $R = -kC$.\n\nIn one dimension, the conservation law is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_{total}}{dx} = R\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the total flux and the reaction rate, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( vC - D \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right) = -kC\n$$\nAssuming the velocity $v$, diffusivity $D$, and rate constant $k$ are constants, we can expand the derivative:\n$$\nv \\frac{dC}{dx} - D \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} = -kC\n$$\nRearranging this equation into the standard form of a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) yields the advection-diffusion-reaction equation:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dC}{dx} - kC = 0\n$$\n\n**2. General Solution of the ODE**\n\nTo solve this ODE, we seek solutions of the form $C(x) = e^{rx}$, which leads to the characteristic equation:\n$$\nD r^2 - v r - k = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation, $r_1$ and $r_2$, are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-(-v) \\pm \\sqrt{(-v)^2 - 4(D)(-k)}}{2D} = \\frac{v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\nThe two distinct roots are:\n$$\nr_1 = \\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\n$$\nr_2 = \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\nSince $v \\ge 0$, $D  0$, and $k \\ge 0$, the term $\\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk} \\ge \\sqrt{v^2} = v$. Consequently, $r_1$ is always positive for $v0$ or $k0$, while $r_2$ is always negative for $k0$.\n\nThe general solution of the ODE is a linear combination of the exponential functions corresponding to these roots:\n$$\nC(x) = A e^{r_1 x} + B e^{r_2 x}\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n**3. Application of Boundary Conditions**\n\nWe apply the two given boundary conditions to find the constants $A$ and $B$.\n\nFirst, consider the boundary condition at infinity: $C(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. This condition is specified for cases where biodegradation occurs ($k > 0$). As established, for $k>0$, we have $r_1 > 0$ and $r_2  0$. As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $e^{r_1 x}$ grows without bound, while the term $e^{r_2 x}$ decays to zero. For the overall concentration $C(x)$ to approach zero, the coefficient of the growing exponential term must be zero. Thus, we must have $A=0$.\nThis reduces the solution to:\n$$\nC(x) = B e^{r_2 x}\n$$\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at the source: $C(0) = C_0$.\n$$\nC(0) = B e^{r_2 \\cdot 0} = B e^0 = B\n$$\nTherefore, the constant $B$ must be equal to the initial concentration, $B = C_0$.\n\n**4. Final Analytical Solution**\n\nCombining these results, the explicit expression for the steady-state concentration profile for $x \\ge 0$ when $k > 0$ is:\n$$\nC(x) = C_0 \\exp(r_2 x) = C_0 \\exp\\left( \\left( \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\right) x \\right)\n$$\nNow, we must consider the special case where there is no biodegradation, i.e., $k=0$ (Case 3 in the test suite). The governing equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dC}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $Dr^2 - vr = 0$, which has roots $r=0$ and $r=v/D$. The general solution is thus $C(x) = A e^{0 \\cdot x} + B e^{(v/D)x} = A + B e^{(v/D)x}$.\nFor the concentration to remain physically bounded as $x \\to \\infty$, the coefficient of the exponentially growing term $e^{(v/D)x}$ (since $v > 0, D > 0$) must be zero. So, $B=0$. The solution becomes $C(x) = A$. Applying the condition $C(0) = C_0$ gives $A = C_0$.\nTherefore, for the case $k=0$, the solution is a constant concentration:\n$$\nC(x) = C_0 \\quad (\\text{for } k=0)\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: without a decay mechanism, the continuous source maintains a constant concentration throughout the domain at steady state. This is also consistent with taking the limit of the general solution as $k \\to 0$, where the exponent $r_2 \\to 0$.\n\nThe derived formulas will be implemented in a program to compute the concentrations for the specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_concentration(C0, v, D, k, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the steady-state microplastic concentration C(x) in a 1D river model.\n\n    Args:\n        C0 (float): Concentration at the source (x=0) in mg/m^3.\n        v (float): Mean flow velocity in m/s.\n        D (float): Effective diffusivity in m^2/s.\n        k (float): First-order biodegradation rate constant in s^-1.\n        x (float): Downstream distance in m.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Concentration C(x) in mg/m^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The boundary condition at x=0 is C(0) = C0.\n    if x == 0:\n        return float(C0)\n\n    # Handle the case with no biodegradation (k=0).\n    if k == 0:\n        # As derived, for k=0, the steady-state concentration is constant.\n        return float(C0)\n    else:\n        # For k > 0, use the full solution to the advection-diffusion-reaction equation.\n        # The solution is C(x) = C0 * exp(r2 * x), where\n        # r2 = (v - sqrt(v^2 + 4*D*k)) / (2*D).\n        v_squared = v**2\n        discriminant_sqrt = np.sqrt(v_squared + 4 * D * k)\n        r2 = (v - discriminant_sqrt) / (2 * D)\n        concentration = C0 * np.exp(r2 * x)\n        return concentration\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for the given test suite and prints the final output.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains: (C0, v, D, k, list_of_x_values)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (general case)\n        (100.0, 0.2, 0.05, np.log(2)/86400, [0, 100, 1000]),\n        # Case 2 (nearly advective-decay limit)\n        (50.0, 0.5, 1e-4, 1e-5, [0, 200, 1000]),\n        # Case 3 (no biodegradation)\n        (80.0, 0.3, 0.02, 0.0, [0, 10, 100]),\n        # Case 4 (strong biodegradation)\n        (120.0, 0.1, 0.01, np.log(2)/3600, [0, 50, 500]),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for C0, v, D, k, x_values in test_cases:\n        # For each case, calculate the concentration at the specified distances\n        for x in x_values:\n            conc = calculate_concentration(C0, v, D, k, x)\n            # Format the result to six decimal places as required.\n            results.append(f\"{conc:.6f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\n# Execute the main solver function.\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2736974"}]}
