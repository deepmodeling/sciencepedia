It is a straightforward application of equilibrium theory.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the receptor occupancy $R^{\\ast}$ as a function of the ligand density $L$ and the dissociation constant $K_{D}$. We begin with the definition of occupancy:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{RL}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe total receptor density is given by $R_{\\text{tot}} = R + RL$. Substituting this into the expression for $R^{\\ast}$ gives:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{RL}{R + RL}$$\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{D} = \\frac{R \\cdot L}{RL}$, we can express the unbound receptor concentration $R$ as:\n$$R = \\frac{K_{D} \\cdot RL}{L}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $R$ into the equation for $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{RL}{\\frac{K_{D} \\cdot RL}{L} + RL}$$\nWe can factor out the term $RL$ from the denominator:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{RL}{RL \\left( \\frac{K_{D}}{L} + 1 \\right)}$$\nAssuming a non-trivial case where $RL > 0$, we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{L} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D} + L}{L}}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for receptor occupancy, which is a form of the Langmuir isotherm or Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$R^{\\ast}(L, K_{D}) = \\frac{L}{L + K_{D}}$$\n\nThe second task is to determine the antigen density $L_{0.5}$ that results in an occupancy of $R^{\\ast} = 0.5$. We set our derived expression for $R^{\\ast}$ equal to $0.5$:\n$$0.5 = \\frac{L_{0.5}}{L_{0.5} + K_{D}}$$\nWriting $0.5$ as $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{L_{0.5}}{L_{0.5} + K_{D}}$$\nCross-multiplication yields:\n$$L_{0.5} + K_{D} = 2 L_{0.5}$$\nSubtracting $L_{0.5}$ from both sides, we find:\n$$K_{D} = L_{0.5}$$\nThis result shows that the dissociation constant is precisely the ligand concentration required to achieve half-maximal receptor occupancy.\n\nThe final task is to compute the occupancy on normal cells under a specific design choice. The design choice is that the affinity, defined by $K_{D}$, is selected such that the occupancy on tumor cells, with antigen density $L_{T}$, is exactly $0.5$. That is, $R^{\\ast}(L_{T}, K_{D}) = 0.5$.\nFrom our previous result, this condition directly implies a relationship between the chosen $K_{D}$ and the tumor antigen density $L_{T}$:\n$$K_{D} = L_{T}$$\nWe are asked to calculate the resulting occupancy on normal cells, which have an antigen density given by $L_{N} = \\frac{L_{T}}{10}$. We use the general formula for occupancy, $R^{\\ast} = \\frac{L}{L + K_{D}}$, with $L = L_{N}$ and the determined value of $K_{D}$:\n$$R^{\\ast}(L_{N}, K_{D}) = \\frac{L_{N}}{L_{N} + K_{D}}$$\nSubstitute the given relationships, $L_{N} = \\frac{L_{T}}{10}$ and $K_{D} = L_{T}$:\n$$R^{\\ast}(L_{N}, K_{D}) = \\frac{\\frac{L_{T}}{10}}{\\frac{L_{T}}{10} + L_{T}}$$\nAssuming $L_{T} > 0$, which must be true for there to be a distinction between tumor and background, we can factor $L_{T}$ from the denominator:\n$$R^{\\ast}(L_{N}, K_{D}) = \\frac{\\frac{L_{T}}{10}}{L_{T}\\left(\\frac{1}{10} + 1\\right)}$$\nCancel the term $L_{T}$:\n$$R^{\\ast}(L_{N}, K_{D}) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{1}{10} + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{10}{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{11}{10}}$$\nThis simplifies to the final answer:\n$$R^{\\ast}(L_{N}, K_{D}) = \\frac{1}{11}$$\nThis value represents the receptor occupancy on normal cells under the specified design criterion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}\n$$", "id": "2736246"}, {"introduction": "Mere binding is not enough; the T cell must amplify this physical event into a robust and highly specific intracellular signal.
