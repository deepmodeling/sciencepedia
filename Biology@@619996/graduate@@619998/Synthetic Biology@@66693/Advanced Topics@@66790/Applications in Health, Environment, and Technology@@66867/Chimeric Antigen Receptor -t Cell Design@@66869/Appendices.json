It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, representing a canonical problem in stochastic systems biology. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe system describes the number of CAR molecules, $N$, on a cell membrane as a continuous-time birth-death process. The state of the system is the integer $n$, representing the number of molecules. The two stochastic processes are:\n1. Production (birth): A species, which we can denote as $\\emptyset$, is converted into a CAR molecule, $N$. The reaction is $\\emptyset \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} N$. This is a zero-order process, meaning its propensity (rate) is constant and independent of the number of existing molecules. The birth rate for a state with $n$ molecules is $b_n = \\alpha$.\n2. Degradation (death): A CAR molecule $N$ is removed from the system. The reaction is $N \\xrightarrow{\\delta} \\emptyset$. This is a first-order process, meaning its propensity is proportional to the number of molecules present. The death rate for a state with $n$ molecules is $d_n = \\delta n$.\n\nLet $P(n, t)$ be the probability of having $n$ molecules at time $t$. The time evolution of this probability distribution is governed by the Chemical Master Equation (CME). The change in probability for state $n$, $\\frac{dP(n, t)}{dt}$, is the sum of probability fluxes into state $n$ minus the sum of fluxes out of state $n$.\n\nFlux into state $n$:\n- From state $n-1$ via production: propensitity is $\\alpha$, so the flux is $\\alpha P(n-1, t)$.\n- From state $n+1$ via degradation: propensitity is $\\delta(n+1)$, so the flux is $\\delta(n+1) P(n+1, t)$.\n\nFlux out of state $n$:\n- To state $n+1$ via production: propensitity is $\\alpha$, so the flux is $\\alpha P(n, t)$.\n- To state $n-1$ via degradation: propensitity is $\\delta n$, so the flux is $\\delta n P(n, t)$.\n\nThe CME is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dP(n, t)}{dt} = \\alpha P(n-1, t) + \\delta(n+1)P(n+1, t) - (\\alpha + \\delta n)P(n, t) \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1 $$\nA special case must be considered for $n=0$, as there can be no transitions from state $n=-1$ and no degradation from state $n=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dP(0, t)}{dt} = \\delta P(1, t) - \\alpha P(0, t) $$\n\nWe seek the stationary or steady-state probability distribution, $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}(n)$, where $\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{ss}}(n)}{dt} = 0$ for all $n$. Let us denote this distribution by $P(n)$ for simplicity.

The performance of the CAR-T cell as a classifier is described by its sensitivity and specificity.\n- **Sensitivity**, or the true positive rate, is the probability of activation given a tumor cell: $P(A_T > \\theta)$. This corresponds to on-tumor efficacy.\n- **Specificity**, or the true negative rate, is the probability of non-activation given a healthy cell: $P(A_H \\le \\theta)$. This corresponds to off-tumor safety.\nThe optimal threshold $\\theta_{\\text{opt}}$ is the value that minimizes a specific weighted sum of errors. Deviating from this value changes the balance between sensitivity and specificity.\n\n- **Increasing $\\theta$** from $\\theta_{\\text{opt}}$ makes activation more difficult. This increases the stringency of the CAR-T cell. Consequently, the probability of activating on a healthy cell decreases, leading to an increase in specificity ($P(A_H \\le \\theta)$ increases). This improves off-tumor safety. However, the probability of activating on a tumor cell also decreases, leading to a decrease in sensitivity ($P(A_T > \\theta)$ decreases). This reduces on-tumor efficacy. Thus, increasing $\\theta$ trades sensitivity for specificity.\n\n- **Decreasing $\\theta$** from $\\theta_{\\text{opt}}$ makes activation easier. This lowers the stringency of the CAR-T cell. Consequently, the probability of activating on a tumor cell increases, leading to an increase in sensitivity ($P(A_T > \\theta)$ increases). This enhances on-tumor efficacy. However, the probability of activating on a healthy cell also increases, meaning the probability of non-activation on a healthy cell decreases. This is a decrease in specificity ($P(A_H \\le \\theta)$ decreases), compromising off-tumor safety. Thus, decreasing $\\theta$ trades specificity for sensitivity.\nThe calculated $\\theta_{\\text{opt}}$ represents the rationally derived balance point for the given priors and equal error costs.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.04 \\times 10^{4}}\n$$", "id": "2720703"}, {"introduction": "The long-term effectiveness of CAR-T therapy hinges on the persistence and expansion of the engineered cell population after infusion.

When the parameter combination satisfies $\\alpha = r - d - k$ and $\\beta = r_m - d_m$ with $\\alpha = \\beta$, use the correct limiting solution for $M(t)$.\n- For peak time detection and area computation on $[0, t_{\\max}]$, a uniform grid with sufficient resolution is acceptable, but the model evaluation at each grid point must use the analytical solution.

It presents a well-posed initial value problem based on a standard linear ordinary differential equation model from population dynamics, applied to the relevant field of CAR-T cell engineering. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and the tasks are objective and mathematically precise.\n\nThe model is a system of two linear first-order ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\left(r - d - k\\right) E\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k E + \\left(r_m - d_m\\right) M\n$$\nwith initial conditions $E(0) = E_0$ and $M(0) = 0$.\n\nTo proceed, we define the net per-capita growth rates for the effector and memory populations, respectively, as:\n$$\n\\alpha = r - d - k\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = r_m - d_m\n$$\nThe system of equations becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\alpha E\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k E + \\beta M\n$$\n\nFirst, we solve for the effector population $E(t)$. The equation for $E(t)$ is a standard exponential growth/decay model. With the initial condition $E(0) = E_0$, the solution is:\n$$\nE(t) = E_0 e^{\\alpha t}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this solution into the equation for $M(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} - \\beta M = k E_0 e^{\\alpha t}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation, which is solved using an integrating factor $I(t) = e^{-\\beta t}$. The solution depends on whether $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are equal.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$\nMultiplying by the integrating factor and integrating yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(M(t)e^{-\\beta t}) = k E_0 e^{(\\alpha - \\beta)t}\n$$\n$$\nM(t)e^{-\\beta t} = \\frac{k E_0}{\\alpha - \\beta} e^{(\\alpha - \\beta)t} + C\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $M(0) = 0$, we find the constant of integration $C = -\\frac{k E_0}{\\alpha - \\beta}$.\nThus, the solution for the memory-like population is:\n$$\nM(t) = \\frac{k E_0}{\\alpha - \\beta} \\left( e^{\\alpha t} - e^{\\beta t} \\right)\n$$\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha = \\beta$\nIn this special case, the differential equation for $M(t)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(M(t)e^{-\\alpha t}) = k E_0 e^{(\\alpha - \\alpha)t} = k E_0\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$\nM(t)e^{-\\alpha t} = k E_0 t + C\n$$\nThe initial condition $M(0)=0$ implies $C=0$.

As permitted, this is found by evaluating the analytical solution $T(t)$ on a fine uniform time grid over the interval $[0, t_{\\max}]$ and identifying the time corresponding to the maximum value.\n3.  **Ratio of areas under the curve, $R_{\\text{AUC}}$**: This requires integrating $T(t)$ from $0$ to $t_{\\max}$.
