The early-phase population dynamics are modeled as a linear birth–death branching process: at any population size $N \\ge 1$, each individual independently gives birth at per-capita rate $b$ (per day) and dies at per-capita rate $d$ (per day), so the total birth rate is $b N$ and the total death rate is $d N$. The process is absorbed at $N=0$ (extinction). Assume independence among lineages and that the early transient occurs at low density so that density dependence is negligible.\n\nScenario analysis and stress testing yield the following three mutually exclusive environmental scenarios, with their probabilities and per-capita rates:\n- Scenario $\\mathsf{S1}$ (moderate moisture, typical soil): occurs with probability $p_{\\mathsf{S1}} = 0.5$, with $b_{\\mathsf{S1}} = 0.9$ and $d_{\\mathsf{S1}} = 0.8$.\n- Scenario $\\mathsf{S2}$ (desiccation with ultraviolet exposure): occurs with probability $p_{\\mathsf{S2}} = 0.3$, with $b_{\\mathsf{S2}} = 0.6$ and $d_{\\mathsf{S2}} = 0.9$.\n- Scenario $\\mathsf{S3}$ (stress-tested worst case, transient nutrient pulse): occurs with probability $p_{\\mathsf{S3}} = 0.2$, with $b_{\\mathsf{S3}} = 1.4$ and $d_{\\mathsf{S3}} = 0.7$.\n\nSuppose the release results in $n_0 = 3$ initially viable founder cells.

It provides a complete and consistent set of parameters for a standard model in stochastic population dynamics—the linear birth–death process. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the probability of ultimate establishment (non-extinction) for a population starting with $n_0$ individuals. We will first derive this probability from first principles for a single lineage ($n_0=1$) and then extend it to the case of $n_0$ founders using the branching property.\n\nLet $\\pi_0(t)$ be the probability that a lineage started by a single individual at time $0$ goes extinct by time $t$, i.e., $P(N(t)=0 | N(0)=1)$. In a small time interval $\\Delta t$, an individual can either give birth (with probability $b \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$), die (with probability $d \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$), or do nothing (with probability $1 - (b+d)\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$). We can write a forward equation for $\\pi_0(t)$ by considering the state of the system at time $\\Delta t$.\nThe probability of extinction by time $t+\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\n\\pi_0(t+\\Delta t) = (b \\Delta t) \\cdot (\\pi_0(t))^2 + (d \\Delta t) \\cdot 1 + (1 - (b+d)\\Delta t) \\cdot \\pi_0(t) + o(\\Delta t)\n$$\nThis equation arises from the law of total probability. If a birth occurs, the population becomes $2$. For the entire lineage to go extinct, both independent sub-lineages must go extinct, which occurs with probability $(\\pi_0(t))^2$. If a death occurs, the population is $0$ and extinction is certain (probability $1$). If nothing happens, the population is still $1$, and the probability of subsequent extinction is $\\pi_0(t)$.\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi_0(t+\\Delta t) - \\pi_0(t)}{\\Delta t} = b(\\pi_0(t))^2 - (b+d)\\pi_0(t) + d + \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, we obtain the differential equation for the extinction probability:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\pi_0}{dt} = b\\pi_0^2 - (b+d)\\pi_0 + d\n$$\nThe ultimate probability of extinction, $\\pi_0 = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\pi_0(t)$, must be a stable fixed point of this ordinary differential equation. The fixed points are the roots of the quadratic equation on the right-hand side set to zero:\n$$\nb\\pi_0^2 - (b+d)\\pi_0 + d = 0\n$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$\n(b\\pi_0 - d)(\\pi_0 - 1) = 0\n$$\nThe two fixed points are $\\pi_0 = 1$ and $\\pi_0 = \\frac{d}{b}$.\n\nWe must determine which fixed point is the correct one.\nThe process starts with one individual, so at time $t=0$, the population is not extinct. Thus, the initial condition is $\\pi_0(0) = 0$.\nThere are two cases based on the parameters $b$ and $d$:\n1.  If $b \\le d$ (subcritical or critical process), the net growth rate is non-positive. In this case, $\\frac{d}{b} \\ge 1$. Since $\\pi_0$ is a probability, it cannot exceed $1$. The only physically meaningful fixed point in the interval $[0, 1]$ is $\\pi_0 = 1$. Extinction is certain.\n2.  If $b  d$ (supercritical process), the net growth rate is positive. Both $\\pi_0 = 1$ and $\\pi_0 = \\frac{d}{b}$ are in $[0, 1]$. The derivative of the right-hand side, $f(\\pi_0) = b\\pi_0^2 - (b+d)\\pi_0 + d$, is $f'(\\pi_0) = 2b\\pi_0 - (b+d)$. At the fixed point $\\pi_0=1$, $f'(1) = 2b - (b+d) = b-d  0$, indicating it is an unstable fixed point. At $\\pi_0=\\frac{d}{b}$, $f'(\\frac{d}{b}) = 2b(\\frac{d}{b}) - (b+d) = 2d - b - d = d-b  0$, indicating it is a stable fixed point. Since the process starts at $\\pi_0(0)=0$, it will converge to the stable fixed point $\\pi_0 = \\frac{d}{b}$.\n\nIn summary, the ultimate extinction probability for a single lineage is:\n$$\n\\pi_0 = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{d}{b}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability of establishment, $P_{\\mathrm{est}}(1)$, is the complement of extinction:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{est}}(1) = 1 - \\pi_0 = 1 - \\min\\left(1, \\frac{d}{b}\\right) = \\max\\left(0, 1 - \\frac{d}{b}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states there are $n_0 = 3$ founders and that their lineages are independent. The total population goes extinct only if all $n_0$ independent lineages go extinct. The probability of this is $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}(n_0) = (\\pi_0)^{n_0}$.\nThe probability of establishment, $P_{\\mathrm{est}}(n_0)$, is the probability that at least one lineage survives:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{est}}(n_0) = 1 - P_{\\mathrm{ext}}(n_0) = 1 - (\\pi_0)^{n_0}\n$$\n\nNow we apply this to the three scenarios with $n_0=3$:\n-   **Scenario $\\mathsf{S1}$**: $b_{\\mathsf{S1}} = 0.9$, $d_{\\mathsf{S1}} = 0.8$.

Upon detection, an immediate cleanup removes a fraction $\\eta$ of the live cells present at that moment, after which remaining cells continue to decay at the same rate $k$.\n- For the mortality endpoint, the per-capita instantaneous hazard imposed on the non-target organism by live cells is $h$ (adverse-event per cell-day). For the HGT endpoint, the per-capita instantaneous contact rate leading to successful HGT is $\\beta$ (HGT-event per cell-day).\n\nLet $s_{d}$ be the standardized severity per mortality event (severity-units per death), and let $s_{g}$ be the standardized severity per successful HGT event (severity-units per HGT). A regulator adopts a risk-neutral multi-endpoint aggregation that converts the endpoints to a single risk index using policy weights $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ that satisfy $w_{1} + w_{2} = 1$, defining the aggregated annual risk index $R^{\\ast}$ (severity-units per year) as the weighted sum of the expected annual severities for the two endpoints.\n\nUsing only the above assumptions and the fundamental definition of risk as expected consequence, derive $R^{\\ast}$ from first principles and then compute its numerical value for the parameter set\n$\\lambda = 0.25$ (events year$^{-1}$), $N_{0} = 1.2 \\times 10^{11}$ (cells), $k = 0.7$ (day$^{-1}$), $r = 1.0$ (day$^{-1}$), $\\eta = 0.95$, $h = 1.5 \\times 10^{-12}$ (adverse-event per cell-day), $\\beta = 3.0 \\times 10^{-14}$ (HGT-event per cell-day), $s_{d} = 1$ (severity-units per death), $s_{g} = 600$ (severity-units per HGT), $w_{1} = 0.3$, and $w_{2} = 0.7$.\n\nReport the final aggregated annual risk index $R^{\\ast}$ as a single real number, rounded to four significant figures. Express the final value in severity-units per year.", "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed exercise in quantitative risk assessment, grounded in standard stochastic process and kinetic models. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, I will proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nThe aggregated annual risk index, $R^{\\ast}$, is defined as the weighted sum of the expected annual severities for the two endpoints: mortality of a non-target organism (endpoint $1$) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (endpoint $2$). Let $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ be the respective expected annual severities. The aggregated risk is given by:\n$$R^{\\ast} = w_{1}R_{1} + w_{2}R_{2}$$\nwhere $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ are policy weights.\n\nRisk is defined as expected consequence. The annual risk for an endpoint is the product of the mean rate of accidental releases and the expected severity per release event. Releases occur as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ events per year.\n\nLet $C_{1}$ be the expected number of deaths per single release event, and $C_{2}$ be the expected number of successful HGT events per single release event. The expected annual severities are then:\n$$R_{1} = \\lambda s_{d} C_{1}$$\n$$R_{2} = \\lambda s_{g} C_{2}$$\nwhere $s_{d}$ is the severity per death and $s_{g}$ is the severity per HGT event.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\lambda (w_{1} s_{d} C_{1} + w_{2} s_{g} C_{2})$$\nThe central task is to derive the expected consequences per event, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$.\n\nThe consequence of a single release event depends on the time of detection, $T$, which is a random variable. The detection process is memoryless with a rate $r$, which implies that $T$ follows an exponential distribution with probability density function (PDF) $f_{T}(t) = r\\exp(-rt)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFor a single release event, the abundance of engineered cells, $N(t)$, at a time $t$ after the release is affected by the cleanup action at time $T$. The population dynamics can be described as follows:\n- For $0 \\le t  T$, the cell abundance decays via first-order loss: $N(t) = N_{0}\\exp(-kt)$.\n- At $t=T$, cleanup removes a fraction $\\eta$ of the cells. The abundance immediately after cleanup is $(1-\\eta)N(T) = (1-\\eta)N_{0}\\exp(-kT)$.\n- For $t \\ge T$, the remaining cells continue to decay from this reduced number: $N(t) = ((1-\\eta)N_{0}\\exp(-kT))\\exp(-k(t-T)) = (1-\\eta)N_{0}\\exp(-kt)$.\n\nThus, for a fixed detection time $T$, the cell abundance at time $t$ is given by the piecewise function:\n$$N(t|T) = \\begin{cases} N_{0}\\exp(-kt)  0 \\le t  T \\\\ (1-\\eta)N_{0}\\exp(-kt)  t \\ge T \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe total number of deaths for a given detection time $T$, denoted $C_{1}(T)$, is the time integral of the instantaneous hazard rate, which is $h N(t|T)$.\n$$C_{1}(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h N(t|T) dt$$\nWe must split the integral at $t=T$:\n$$C_{1}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} h N_{0}\\exp(-kt) dt + \\int_{T}^{\\infty} h (1-\\eta)N_{0}\\exp(-kt) dt$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} h N_{0}\\exp(-kt) dt = h N_{0} \\left[-\\frac{\\exp(-kt)}{k}\\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{hN_{0}}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kT))$$\n$$\\int_{T}^{\\infty} h (1-\\eta)N_{0}\\exp(-kt) dt = h(1-\\eta)N_{0} \\left[-\\frac{\\exp(-kt)}{k}\\right]_{T}^{\\infty} = \\frac{h(1-\\eta)N_{0}}{k}\\exp(-kT)$$\nSumming these components gives the consequence for a fixed $T$:\n$$C_{1}(T) = \\frac{hN_{0}}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kT)) + \\frac{h(1-\\eta)N_{0}}{k}\\exp(-kT) = \\frac{hN_{0}}{k}(1 - \\eta\\exp(-kT))$$\nTo find the expected consequence per event, $C_{1}$, we must average $C_{1}(T)$ over all possible values of $T$ using its probability distribution:\n$$C_{1} = E[C_{1}(T)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{1}(t) f_{T}(t) dt$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation is more direct:\n$$C_{1} = E\\left[\\frac{hN_{0}}{k}(1 - \\eta\\exp(-kT))\\right] = \\frac{hN_{0}}{k}(1 - \\eta E[\\exp(-kT)])$$\nThe term $E[\\exp(-kT)]$ is the value of the moment-generating function of $T$, $M_{T}(s) = E[\\exp(sT)]$, evaluated at $s=-k$. For an exponential distribution with rate $r$, $M_{T}(s) = \\frac{r}{r-s}$. Thus:\n$$E[\\exp(-kT)] = M_{T}(-k) = \\frac{r}{r-(-k)} = \\frac{r}{r+k}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C_{1}$:\n$$C_{1} = \\frac{hN_{0}}{k}\\left(1 - \\eta\\frac{r}{r+k}\\right)$$\nThe derivation for $C_{2}$ is identical, with the per-capita hazard $h$ replaced by the per-capita HGT rate $\\beta$:\n$$C_{2} = \\frac{\\beta N_{0}}{k}\\left(1 - \\eta\\frac{r}{r+k}\\right)$$\nNow we assemble the full expression for $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\left[ w_{1}s_{d}\\frac{hN_{0}}{k}\\left(1 - \\eta\\frac{r}{r+k}\\right) + w_{2}s_{g}\\frac{\\beta N_{0}}{k}\\left(1 - \\eta\\frac{r}{r+k}\\right) \\right]$$\nFactoring out the common terms provides the final analytical expression for the aggregated annual risk:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\frac{N_{0}}{k} \\left(1 - \\eta\\frac{r}{k+r}\\right) (w_{1}s_{d}h + w_{2}s_{g}\\beta)$$\nThe units are consistent. The term $\\frac{N_{0}}{k}$ has units of cell-days. The term $(w_{1}s_{d}h + w_{2}s_{g}\\beta)$ has units of severity-units per cell-day. Their product gives severity-units per event.
