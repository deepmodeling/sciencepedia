This is a standard and scientifically established model in environmental engineering and microbiology. The context of a BSL-2 laboratory and the use of sodium hypochlorite are realistic. The assumptions (constant concentration, well-mixed, no organic load) are standard simplifications to achieve a first-order kinetic model. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of physical assumptions and asks for a derivation and a subsequent calculation. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for both parts. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language without subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem states that the instantaneous inactivation rate is proportional to the number of viable organisms, $N(t)$, and the disinfectant concentration, $C$. The inactivation rate is the rate of decrease of $N(t)$, which is expressed mathematically as $-\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$. The proportionality can be written as an equation by introducing a proportionality constant, which we will call $k'$.\n\n$$-\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k' N(t) C$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the concentration of the disinfectant, $C$, is constant because it is present in large excess. This allows us to treat the product $k'C$ as a single constant. The equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables.\n\n$$\\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = -k' C dt$$\n\nTo find the number of organisms $N(t)$ at any time $t$, we integrate both sides of the equation. We integrate the left side from the initial number of organisms $N_{0}$ at time $t=0$ to $N(t)$ at time $t$.\n\n$$\\int_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -k' C dt$$\n\nThe integration yields:\n\n$$[\\ln(N)]_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} = -k' C [t]_{0}^{t}$$\n\n$$\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_{0}) = -k' C (t-0)$$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k' C t \\quad (*)$$\n\nThis equation represents the first-order decay process in terms of the natural logarithm ($\\ln$). The problem requires a derivation of a base-$10$ log-linear relationship. To convert from the natural logarithm ($\\ln$, base $e$) to the common logarithm ($\\log_{10}$, base $10$), we use the change of base formula: $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\log_{10}(x)$.\n\nApplying this transformation to our equation $(*)$:\n\n$$\\ln(10) \\cdot \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k' C t$$\n\nNow, we isolate the base-$10$ logarithm term to obtain the form consistent with classical Chick-Watson kinetics:\n\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}\\right) C t$$\n\nThis is the desired base-$10$ log-linear relationship. The problem asks to explicitly identify the constant of proportionality that appears in this base-$10$ formulation. Let us define this new constant as $k$.\n\n$$k = \\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$$\n\nSo the final form of the equation is:\n\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k C t$$\n\nThe constant $k$ is the Chick-Watson rate constant for a base-$10$ formulation. To determine its units, we analyze the dimensions of the original rate equation $-\\frac{dN}{dt} = k' N C$. The number of organisms $N$ is treated as a dimensionless quantity (or in units of CFU, which cancel from both sides). The term $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ has units of inverse time, $[\\text{time}]^{-1}$. The concentration $C$ has units of mass per volume, $[\\text{mass}][\\text{volume}]^{-1}$.\n\n$$[\\text{time}]^{-1} = [k'] \\cdot [\\text{concentration}]$$\n$$[k'] = \\frac{1}{[\\text{time}] \\cdot [\\text{concentration}]}$$\n\nGiven the units in the problem, time is in minutes ($\\mathrm{min}$) and concentration is in milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$). Thus, the units for $k'$ are $(\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})^{-1}$, which is $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Since $k = \\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$ and $\\ln(10)$ is a dimensionless number, the constant $k$ has the exact same units as $k'$: $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. This is consistent with the value provided in the second part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must calculate the contact time $t$ required to achieve a $6$-log reduction. A $6$-log reduction means that the ratio of final to initial organisms is $N(t)/N_{0} = 10^{-6}$.\n\nWe use the derived relationship:\n\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k C t$$\n\nSubstitute the value for a $6$-log reduction:\n\n$$\\log_{10}(10^{-6}) = -k C t$$\n\nThe base-$10$ logarithm of $10^{-6}$ is simply $-6$:\n\n$$-6 = -k C t$$\n\nNow we solve for the required time $t$:\n\n$$t = \\frac{6}{k C}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$C = 500\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$k = 1.2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product $kC$:\n\n$$kC = (1.2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}) \\times (500\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})$$\n$$kC = 1.2\\times 10^{-3} \\times 5 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n$$kC = 6 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} = 0.6 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the expression for $t$:\n\n$$t = \\frac{6}{0.6 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}$$\n$$t = 10 \\, \\mathrm{min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

It provides a standard engineering model for contaminant clearance in a ventilated enclosure. The model for bulk clearance, $dC/dt = -kC$, is a classical representation of a well-mixed volume with a constant purge rate. The concept of an efficiency factor $\\eta < 1$ to account for non-ideal mixing is standard practice in ventilation engineering.

Performing polynomial division of $-sp^2 + p(2s+sh-h) + (h-s-sh)$ by $(p-1)$ yields the quotient $(-sp + s+sh-h)$.\nSo, the bracketed expression is $(p-1)(-sp + s(1+h)-h)$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p(p-1)(-sp + s(1+h)-h)}{1 - 2sp + sp^2} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $\\Delta p$.\n\nFinally, to find the non-boundary internal equilibrium frequency $p^{\\star} \\in (0,1)$, we set $\\Delta p=0$ and solve for $p$.\n$$ \\frac{p(p-1)(-sp + s(1+h)-h)}{1 - 2sp + sp^2} = 0 $$\nThe denominator $\\bar{w}=1-2sp+sp^2 = 1 - s(2p-p^2)$ is always positive for $s \\in (0,1)$ and $p \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, we only need to find the roots of the numerator:\n$$ p(p-1)(-sp + s(1+h)-h) = 0 $$\nThis equation has three roots:\n1. $p=0$ (boundary equilibrium: wild-type population)\n2. $p=1$ (boundary equilibrium: drive allele fixation)\n3. $-sp + s(1+h)-h = 0$ (internal equilibrium, $p^{\\star}$)\n\nSolving the third case for $p$ gives the internal equilibrium $p^{\\star}$:\n$$ sp^{\\star} = s(1+h)-h $$\n$$ p^{\\star} = \\frac{s(1+h)-h}{s} = 1+h-\\frac{h}{s} $$\nThis equilibrium exists in the interval $(0,1)$ provided that $s > \\frac{h}{1+h}$.\nThe problem asks for the expression for $p^{\\star}$, which is $1+h-\\frac{h}{s}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{p(p-1)(-sp + s(1+h)-h)}{1 - 2sp + sp^2} & 1+h-\\frac{h}{s}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2717145"}]}
