We begin by stating the fundamental principles governing the system.\n\nThe total rate of the catalytic reaction, $v$, is the sum of the contributions from the unbound ribozyme ($R$) and the peptide-bound ribozyme-peptide complex ($RP$). The problem states that catalysis is a first-order process for both species. Therefore, the total rate is:\n$$v = k_{0}[R] + k_{b}[RP]$$\nwhere $[R]$ and $[RP]$ are the concentrations of the free and complexed ribozyme, respectively, and $k_{0}$ and $k_{b}$ are their intrinsic first-order rate constants.\n\nThe observed ensemble-averaged first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$, is defined as the total reaction rate $v$ divided by the total concentration of the ribozyme, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$.

The baseline population replicates at a rate of $1$.
