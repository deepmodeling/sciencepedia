The analysis rests upon the foundational principle of mass conservation for the aldehyde species, whose concentration is denoted by $S(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the aldehyde concentration, $\\frac{dS}{dt}$, is governed by the balance between its production and removal fluxes. The problem specifies the following terms:\n$1$. A constant production rate, $r_{p}$.\n$2$. An enzymatic removal rate that adheres to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, described by the function $v_{\\text{enz}}(S) = \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{M} + S}$.\n$3$. A first-order removal rate due to transport, given by $v_{\\text{trans}}(S) = k_{\\text{imm}} S$.\n\nApplying the principle of mass conservation, we formulate the governing ordinary differential equation for $S(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Production} - \\text{Total Rate of Removal} $$\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = r_{p} - v_{\\text{enz}}(S) - v_{\\text{trans}}(S) $$\nSubstituting the specific rate laws gives:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = r_{p} - \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{M} + S} - k_{\\text{imm}} S $$\n\nAt steady state, the system variables are, by definition, constant over time. Therefore, the concentration of the aldehyde ceases to change, which mathematically implies that its time derivative is zero. Let $S^{\\ast}$ denote this steady-state concentration. We set $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = r_{p} - \\frac{V_{\\max} S^{\\ast}}{K_{M} + S^{\\ast}} - k_{\\text{imm}} S^{\\ast} $$\nThis equation expresses the equilibrium condition: the total production flux is perfectly balanced by the total removal flux.\n$$ r_{p} = \\frac{V_{\\max} S^{\\ast}}{K_{M} + S^{\\ast}} + k_{\\text{imm}} S^{\\ast} $$\n\nTo solve for $S^{\\ast}$, this algebraic equation must be rearranged into a standard polynomial form.

Since all kinetic parameters ($k_{\\text{imm}}$, $r_{p}$, $K_{M}$, $V_{\\max}$) are positive, the term $4 k_{\\text{imm}} r_{p} K_{M}$ is strictly positive. This guarantees that the discriminant is positive and that real solutions exist. The magnitude of the square root term will be greater than the magnitude of the $-b$ term.

For the aldehyde concentration, this means the rate of its production, $r_p$, is precisely counteracted by the summed rates of its removal via enzymatic degradation and active transport. Our derivation and calculation have identified the unique, physically-realizable concentration $S^{\\ast}$ at which this dynamic equilibrium is achieved. Since this calculated concentration, $S^{\\ast} = 50.00\\,\\text{nM}$, is numerically smaller than the given cytotoxic threshold, $C_{\\text{tox}} = 120\\,\\text{nM}$, we must conclude that the combined cellular detoxification mechanisms are sufficient to maintain the aldehyde at a non-toxic level under the specified production rate and kinetic parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{50.00}\n$$", "id": "2740837"}, {"introduction": "Beyond direct metabolic load, toxicity can arise from unintended molecular interactions, or 'crosstalk,' a pervasive challenge in synthetic biology.

The parameters of the underlying normal distribution, $\\mu_{\\ln}$ and $\\sigma^2_{\\ln}$, can be determined from the mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ of the lognormal variable $X$ using the following standard relations:\n$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\exp\\left(\\mu_{\\ln} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\ln}}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\text{Var}(X) = \\left[\\exp(\\sigma^2_{\\ln}) - 1\\right] \\exp(2\\mu_{\\ln} + \\sigma^2_{\\ln}) $$\nThe second equation can be rewritten by substituting the expression for $\\mu^2$:\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\left[\\exp(\\sigma^2_{\\ln}) - 1\\right] \\mu^2 $$\nFrom this, we can solve for $\\sigma^2_{\\ln}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} = \\exp(\\sigma^2_{\\ln}) - 1 $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\ln} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} + 1\\right) $$\nAfter finding $\\sigma^2_{\\ln}$, we can solve for $\\mu_{\\ln}$ using the equation for $\\mu$:\n$$ \\ln(\\mu) = \\mu_{\\ln} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\ln}}{2} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\ln} = \\ln(\\mu) - \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\ln}}{2} $$\nWe need to calculate the probability $P(X > T)$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the logarithm of the fluorescence exceeds the logarithm of the threshold:\n$$ P(X > T) = P(\\ln(X) > \\ln(T)) = P(Y > \\ln(T)) $$\nTo compute this probability for the normal variable $Y$, we standardize it to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, where $Z = (Y - \\mu_{\\ln}) / \\sigma_{\\ln}$.\n$$ P(Y > \\ln(T)) = P\\left(\\frac{Y - \\mu_{\\ln}}{\\sigma_{\\ln}} > \\frac{\\ln(T) - \\mu_{\\ln}}{\\sigma_{\\ln}}\\right) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\ln(T) - \\mu_{\\ln}}{\\sigma_{\\ln}}\\right) $$\nThis probability can be expressed using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z)$, as $1 - \\Phi(z)$, or equivalently using the complementary error function, $\\text{erfc}(z)$.\n$$ P(Z > z) = 1 - \\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided. First, we compute the parameters of the normal distribution:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{9}}{(1.2 \\times 10^{5})^2} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{9}}{1.44 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.25 $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\ln} = \\ln(1 + 0.25) = \\ln(1.25) $$\nThen we find the argument of the CDF, which we denote as $z_{score}$:\n$$ z_{score} = \\frac{\\ln(T) - \\mu_{\\ln}}{\\sigma_{\\ln}} = \\frac{\\ln(T) - \\left[\\ln(\\mu) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_{\\ln}\\right]}{\\sigma_{\\ln}} = \\frac{\\ln(T) - \\ln(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_{\\ln}}{\\sigma_{\\ln}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma^2_{\\ln}$ and the ratio $T/\\mu$:\n$$ z_{score} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{\\mu}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} + 1\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} + 1\\right)}} $$\n$$ z_{score} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.3 \\times 10^{5}}{1.2 \\times 10^{5}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1.25)}{\\sqrt{\\ln(1.25)}} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{12}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1.25)}{\\sqrt{\\ln(1.25)}} $$\nNumerically evaluating these terms:\n$$ \\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314355 $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{12}\\right) \\approx 0.08004271 $$\nThe standard deviation of the log-transformed data is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\ln} = \\sqrt{\\ln(1.25)} \\approx 0.47238073 $$\nThe $z_{score}$ is therefore:\n$$ z_{score} \\approx \\frac{0.08004271 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.22314355)}{0.47238073} \\approx \\frac{0.08004271 + 0.11157178}{0.47238073} = \\frac{0.19161449}{0.47238073} \\approx 0.405638 $$\nThe required probability is $P(Z > 0.405638)$. Using standard normal distribution tables or a computational tool:\n$$ P(Z > 0.405638) = 1 - \\Phi(0.405638) \\approx 1 - 0.6575099 \\approx 0.3424901 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.3425$.
