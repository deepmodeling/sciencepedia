It is scientifically grounded, mathematically well-posed, and objectively stated. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the axioms of probability. Let $F_1$ be the event of failure for safeguard $A$ with probability $P(F_1) = p_1$, and $F_2$ be the event of failure for safeguard $B$ with probability $P(F_2) = p_2$. The events $F_1$ and $F_2$ are stipulated to be independent.\n\nFirst, we analyze the **series-layered containment** architecture. The problem states that escape requires the \"simultaneous failure of both safeguards.\" In the language of set theory and probability, this corresponds to the intersection of the two failure events, $F_1 \\cap F_2$. The probability of escape for this architecture is thus $P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,series}} = P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$. By the definition of statistical independence, the probability of the intersection of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,series}} = P(F_1 \\cap F_2) = P(F_1) P(F_2) = p_1 p_2.\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the **parallel-vulnerability containment** architecture. The problem states that escape occurs if \"either safeguard fails.\" This corresponds to the union of the two failure events, $F_1 \\cup F_2$. The probability of escape for this architecture is $P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,parallel}} = P(F_1 \\cup F_2)$. To calculate this, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle for two events:\n$$\nP(F_1 \\cup F_2) = P(F_1) + P(F_2) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2).\n$$\nSubstituting the known probabilities and applying the independence rule for the intersection term, we find:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,parallel}} = p_1 + p_2 - P(F_1) P(F_2) = p_1 + p_2 - p_1 p_2.\n$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the fold-reduction, $\\rho$, defined as the ratio of the escape probability in the series architecture to that in the parallel architecture.\n$$\n\\rho \\equiv \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,series}}}{P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,parallel}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{p_1 p_2}{p_1 + p_2 - p_1 p_2}.\n$$\nThe problem constraints $0 < p_1 < 1$ and $0 < p_2 < 1$ ensure that the denominator is strictly positive, as $p_1 + p_2 - p_1 p_2 = p_1(1-p_2) + p_2 > 0$.

In a permissive environment, both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are supplied, so the population grows without selection against revertants.

All necessary parameters ($N$, $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$) and definitions are provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Escape Probability**\n\nLet $P(\\text{Escape})$ be the probability of the escape event. This event occurs if at least one double-revertant cell is produced from the $N$ initial cells. A direct calculation of this probability would involve summing the probabilities of producing exactly $1$, exactly $2$, ..., up to $N$ double revertants. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is the non-occurrence of an escape, and subtract this from $1$. The complementary event, \"No Escape,\" corresponds to zero double-revertant cells being produced.\n\n$$P(\\text{Escape}) = 1 - P(\\text{No Escape})$$\n\nLet us first consider a single cell from the initial population of $N$ cells. This cell attempts one division. A double-revertant progeny is produced if, during this division, a reversion occurs at the locus for $M_1$ AND a reversion occurs at the locus for $M_2$.\n\nThe problem states that these two reversion events are independent.\n- The probability of reversion for $M_1$ is $\\mu_1$.\n- The probability of reversion for $M_2$ is $\\mu_2$.\n\nTherefore, the probability, let us call it $p$, that a single given cell's division attempt results in a double-revertant progeny is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$p = P(\\text{reversion}_1 \\cap \\text{reversion}_2) = P(\\text{reversion}_1) \\times P(\\text{reversion}_2) = \\mu_1 \\mu_2$$\n\nThis outcome, the production of a double revertant from a single cell's division, can be considered a \"success\" in a Bernoulli trial. The probability of \"failure\" for a single trial (i.e., the cell division does not produce a double revertant) is:\n$$1 - p = 1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2$$\n\nNow, we consider the entire population of $N$ cells. Each of the $N$ cells attempts one division. Since the reversion events are independent across cells, we have a series of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials. The \"No Escape\" event occurs if and only if all $N$ of these independent trials result in failure.\n\nThe probability that all $N$ trials fail is the product of their individual failure probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{No Escape}) = (1 - p)^N = (1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $P(\\text{Escape})$, we obtain the exact closed-form expression for the escape probability:\n$$P(\\text{Escape}) = 1 - (1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N$$\n\nThis is the exact solution based on the binomial model.\n\nThe problem also requests the asymptotic Poisson approximation. This approximation is valid in the limit of rare events, where the number of trials $N$ is very large and the probability of success per trial $p = \\mu_1 \\mu_2$ is very small, such that their product $\\lambda = Np = N \\mu_1 \\mu_2$ is a finite, moderate value. The number of successes in this limit follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$.\n\nThe probability of an escape event is the probability of observing one or more successes, $P(K \\ge 1)$, where $K$ is the random variable for the number of double revertants.\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K = 0)$$\nIn the Poisson approximation, the probability of zero successes is given by:\n$$P(K = 0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda) = \\exp(-N \\mu_1 \\mu_2)$$\nTherefore, the Poisson approximation for the escape probability is:\n$$P(\\text{Escape}) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-N \\mu_1 \\mu_2)$$\nThis result is consistent with the Taylor series expansion of the exact solution for small $p=\\mu_1\\mu_2$:\n$$(1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N = \\exp(N \\ln(1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)) \\approx \\exp(N(-\\mu_1 \\mu_2)) = \\exp(-N \\mu_1 \\mu_2)$$\n\nThe problem, however, requires the exact closed-form expression for the final answer. This is the expression derived directly from the binomial model.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - (1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N} $$", "id": "2712941"}, {"introduction": "The most advanced biocontainment designs must be resilient not only to stochastic failure but also to the persistent pressure of evolution. This practice explores a scenario where escape requires two mutational \"hits,\" but the intermediate single-mutant is less fit due to negative epistasis—a common design goal. By analyzing this system within the Wright-Fisher framework, you will determine the expected waiting time for an escape event by calculating the steady-state population of deleterious intermediates sustained by a mutation-selection balance [@problem_id:2712933]. This exercise reveals how evolutionary forces can both create challenges and be harnessed for more robust safeguard design.", "problem": "A genomically recoded bacterium is safeguarded by two independent genetic firewalls such that environmental escape requires inactivation of both firewalls. A cell that inactivates only one firewall is less fit due to negative epistasis: each single inactivation reduces relative fitness by a selection coefficient $s$, so single mutants have relative fitness $1 - s$ while the wild type has relative fitness $1$. The double mutant is the escape genotype whose first appearance defines escape; fixation of escape is not required for this problem.\n\nAssume a constant-size asexual population of $N$ cells with non-overlapping generations in a Wright–Fisher (WF) sense (each generation produces $N$ offspring). Mutations occur during reproduction as follows:\n- From wild type to any single-mutant state at per-offspring rate $\\mu_1$.\n- From a given single-mutant state to the double-mutant escape genotype at per-offspring rate $\\mu_2$.\n\nAssume $0 < \\mu_1 \\ll 1$, $0 < \\mu_2 \\ll 1$, $0 < s \\ll 1$, $N s \\gg 1$, and $\\mu_2 \\ll s$, with no back mutation and with independent lineages (so that interference among rare lineages can be neglected). Under these conditions, single-mutant lineages are transient and typically go extinct.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and fundamental definitions of reproduction, mutation, and selection in the WF framework, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the expected waiting time, in units of generations, until the first double-mutant escape genotype appears anywhere in the population.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $N$, $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$, and $s$. Do not substitute numerical values.", "solution": "The problem asks for a closed-form analytic expression for the expected waiting time, in generations, until the first appearance of a double-mutant (escape) genotype. Let this waiting time be denoted by $T_{esc}$.\n\nThe appearance of the double mutant is a rare stochastic event. The expected waiting time for such an event is the reciprocal of its rate of occurrence, which in this discrete-time Wright-Fisher framework is the probability of its occurrence per generation. Let this probability be $p_{esc}$. The expected waiting time is therefore:\n$$T_{esc} = \\frac{1}{p_{esc}}$$\nThe double-mutant (DM) genotype arises from a pre-existing single-mutant (SM) genotype via a second mutation. The probability of escape per generation, $p_{esc}$, is therefore determined by the number of SM individuals present in the population, $N_{sm}$, and their per-capita mutation rate to the DM state, $\\mu_2$.\n\nThe number of new DM genotypes expected to arise in one generation is $K_{esc} = N_{sm} \\mu_2$. For a rare event, the probability of at least one occurrence in a given trial (generation), $p_{esc}$, is well-approximated by the expected number of occurrences, provided this number is much less than $1$. The given conditions ($N \\mu_1 \\mu_2 / s \\ll 1$ is implied by $\\mu \\ll s$) ensure this is the case. Thus, we can set $p_{esc} \\approx K_{esc} = N_{sm} \\mu_2$.\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of single mutants, $N_{sm}$, in the population. The problem states that SM lineages are transient due to the deleterious selection coefficient $s > 0$. However, new SM individuals are continuously generated from the wild-type (WT) population by mutation. The condition $Ns \\gg 1$ implies that selection against the SM genotype is strong compared to genetic drift. In this regime, the total number of SM individuals in the population reaches a stochastic steady state, the average size of which can be found by a mutation-selection balance calculation. We equate the rate of production of new SM individuals to their rate of removal.\n\n1.  **Rate of production of SMs**: The population consists almost entirely of wild-type individuals, so its size is approximately $N$. Mutations from WT to SM occur at a rate $\\mu_1$ per offspring. In each generation, $N$ new offspring are produced. Therefore, the number of new SM individuals created per generation is:\n    $$R_{production} = N \\mu_1$$\n\n2.  **Rate of removal of SMs**: SM individuals have a relative fitness of $1-s$. This means that for every generation, a fraction $s$ of the SM population is effectively removed by negative selection. The number of SM individuals lost per generation due to this selection pressure is:\n    $$R_{removal} = N_{sm} s$$\n    We neglect the loss of SMs due to mutation into DMs, as the given condition $\\mu_2 \\ll s$ ensures that selection is the primary process removing SMs.\n\nAt steady state, the rate of production equals the rate of removal:\n$$R_{production} = R_{removal}$$\n$$N \\mu_1 = N_{sm} s$$\n\nSolving for the steady-state number of single mutants, $N_{sm}$, we obtain:\n$$N_{sm} = \\frac{N \\mu_1}{s}$$\n\nThis represents the time-averaged size of the standing population of deleterious single mutants. Now we can calculate the rate of appearance of the double-mutant escape genotype. This is the number of single mutants, $N_{sm}$, multiplied by the probability of a second mutation, $\\mu_2$:\n$$p_{esc} \\approx K_{esc} = N_{sm} \\mu_2 = \\left(\\frac{N \\mu_1}{s}\\right) \\mu_2 = \\frac{N \\mu_1 \\mu_2}{s}$$\nThis expression represents the probability per generation that an escape mutant appears in the population.\n\nFinally, the expected waiting time until the first escape event is the reciprocal of this probability:\n$$T_{esc} = \\frac{1}{p_{esc}} = \\frac{s}{N \\mu_1 \\mu_2}$$\n\nThis derivation relies fundamentally on the branching process nature of the single-mutant lineages. A single deleterious mutant with selection coefficient $s$ founds a lineage whose expected total size over its lifetime is $1/s$. Since new lineages are founded at a rate of $N\\mu_1$ per generation, this provides an alternative way to conceptualize the problem that yields the same result. The mutation-selection balance provides a more direct calculation for the time-averaged population size under the given strong selection, weak mutation regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{s}{N \\mu_1 \\mu_2}}$$", "id": "2712933"}]}
