[@problem_id:2724405]", "problem": "A team evaluates the insulation performance of a genetic transcriptional unit by measuring its steady-state reporter output across multiple biological and genetic contexts. Each context differs in at least one of the following: host strain background, plasmid copy number, neighboring part sequence, or growth medium, leading to different intracellular resource availabilities. According to the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and resource competition principles, context-dependency arises when upstream and downstream interactions and host resource fluctuations modulate transcription and translation, thereby causing variation in output across contexts. To quantify insulation, the team adopts a dimensionless metric called the Context Sensitivity Index (CSI), defined as the degree of dispersion in output relative to its central tendency across contexts. In particular, they equate the CSI to the coefficient of variation (CV), namely the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean across contexts, so that lower values indicate better insulation.\n\nThey measure the reporter output, in arbitrary units (AU), for $n=12$ distinct contexts and obtain an empirical mean of $\\mu = 200\\ \\mathrm{AU}$ and an empirical standard deviation of $s = 30\\ \\mathrm{AU}$. Using the definition above, compute the Context Sensitivity Index. Round your answer to three significant figures and express it as a pure number with no units. Then, based only on the principle that smaller dispersion relative to the mean indicates better insulation, state whether the insulation appears strong, weak, or intermediate in a single sentence (your interpretation should be written separately from the numerical answer and should not use a percentage sign).", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n1.  The Context Sensitivity Index (CSI) is defined as the coefficient of variation (CV).\n2.  CSI is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean across contexts.\n3.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and statistics, specifically using the coefficient of variation to normalize dispersion. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The provided values are physically plausible. The question is formalizable and directly relevant to the topic of genetic part characterization in synthetic biology.\n\nThe task is to compute the Context Sensitivity Index (CSI). The problem explicitly defines this index as the coefficient of variation ($CV$), which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. It must be noted that the problem uses the symbol $\\mu$ for the *empirical* mean. Standard statistical notation reserves $\\mu$ for the population mean and uses $\\bar{x}$ for the sample mean. Similarly, $\\sigma$ is for the population standard deviation, and $s$ is for the sample standard deviation. Since the data are from a finite number of contexts ($n=12$), these are sample statistics. We will proceed using the provided symbols, understanding that $\\mu$ here represents the sample mean.\n\nThe formula for the CSI is thus:\n$$ \\text{CSI} = \\frac{s}{\\mu} $$\nThe provided data are:\n- Empirical standard deviation, $s = 30 \\text{ AU}$.\n- Empirical mean, $\\mu = 200 \\text{ AU}$.\n\nThe number of contexts, $n=12$, is the sample size from which these statistics were derived, but it is not directly required for the calculation of the CSI itself, as the mean and standard deviation are already given.\n\nSubstituting the provided values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{CSI} = \\frac{30}{200} $$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$ \\text{CSI} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.15$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we must add a trailing zero.\n$$ \\text{CSI} = 0.150 $$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, as the units (AU) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, which is consistent with the nature of an index.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The problem states that \"smaller dispersion relative to the mean indicates better insulation.\" Our calculated CSI of $0.150$ represents a standard deviation that is $15\\%$ of the mean. This is a relatively small value for biological systems, which are often characterized by significant variability. Therefore, based on the principle provided, this small ratio of dispersion to central tendency indicates that the insulation of the genetic unit appears strong.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.150}$$", "id": "2724405"}, {"introduction": "Context dependency often arises from unintended interactions, such as competition for limited cellular resources.
