It is a standard, solvable problem in quantitative biology that tests first principles of reaction kinetics. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation**\nLet $M(t)$ be the number of intact mRNA molecules in a cell at time $t$. The dynamics of $M(t)$ can be described by a linear ordinary differential equation based on the principle of mass-action kinetics. The rate of change of $M(t)$, $\\frac{dM(t)}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of production and the rate of removal.\n\nThe rate of production is given as a constant, $\\alpha$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Production} = \\alpha $$\n\nThe intact mRNA is removed by two independent, parallel first-order processes: basal degradation and ribozyme cleavage. For first-order processes, the rate is proportional to the concentration (or number of molecules) of the reactant.\nThe rate of removal due to basal degradation is $\\delta M(t)$.\nThe rate of removal due to self-cleavage is $k_{c} M(t)$.\n\nSince these are independent pathways for removal of the same species, their rates are additive. The total rate of removal is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Removal} = \\delta M(t) + k_{c} M(t) = (\\delta + k_{c}) M(t) $$\n\nCombining the production and removal terms, we construct the governing differential equation for the mean abundance of intact mRNA:\n$$ \\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\alpha - (\\delta + k_{c}) M(t) $$\nThis equation describes a linear birth-death process.\n\n**Steady-State Mean Abundance ($M_{\\text{ss}}$)**\nThe steady state is achieved when the system reaches equilibrium, meaning the number of mRNA molecules is no longer changing over time. At steady state, $\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = 0$. Let $M_{\\text{ss}}$ be the steady-state value of $M(t)$.\n$$ 0 = \\alpha - (\\delta + k_{c}) M_{\\text{ss}} $$\nSolving this algebraic equation for $M_{\\text{ss}}$ gives the steady-state mean abundance:\n$$ (\\delta + k_{c}) M_{\\text{ss}} = \\alpha $$\n$$ M_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta + k_{c}} $$\nThe units are (molecules cell$^{-1}$ min$^{-1}$) / (min$^{-1}$), which yields molecules cell$^{-1}$, as required.\n\n**Effective mRNA Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**\nThe half-life of a species is the time required for its concentration to decrease to half of its initial value in the absence of production. To find the half-life, we consider only the decay part of the kinetic equation, setting the production term $\\alpha$ to $0$.\n$$ \\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = -(\\delta + k_{c}) M(t) $$\nWe can define an effective first-order decay rate constant, $k_{\\text{eff}}$, which is the sum of the individual rate constants for the parallel decay pathways:\n$$ k_{\\text{eff}} = \\delta + k_{c} $$\nThe decay equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = -k_{\\text{eff}} M(t) $$\nThis is a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{M} = -k_{\\text{eff}} dt $$\nIntegrating both sides from an initial time $t=0$ with concentration $M_0$ to a later time $t$ with concentration $M(t)$:\n$$ \\int_{M_0}^{M(t)} \\frac{1}{M} dM = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{\\text{eff}} dt' $$\n$$ \\left[ \\ln(M) \\right]_{M_0}^{M(t)} = -k_{\\text{eff}} [t']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln(M(t)) - \\ln(M_0) = -k_{\\text{eff}} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{M(t)}{M_0}\\right) = -k_{\\text{eff}} t $$\n$$ M(t) = M_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{eff}} t) $$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time $t$ at which $M(t) = \\frac{1}{2} M_0$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} M_0 = M_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{eff}} t_{1/2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\text{eff}} t_{1/2}) $$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\text{eff}} t_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k_{\\text{eff}} t_{1/2} $$\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta + k_{c}} $$\nThe units are (dimensionless) / (min$^{-1}$), which yields minutes, as required.\n\nThe final expressions for the effective half-life and steady-state mean abundance are thus determined.\n$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta + k_{c}}$\n$M_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta + k_{c}}$\nThese are presented as a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta + k_{c}} & \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta + k_{c}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2772133"}, {"introduction": "Building on the kinetics of single molecules, we now turn to engineering their response to regulatory inputs.

The problem is non-trivial and requires correct application of principles of statistical mechanics and differential calculus.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\nFirst, we derive the activation probability for the independent-binding regime, $f_{\\mathrm{ind}}([P])$. The partition function, $Z$, is the sum of all statistical weights. The statistical weight of the macrostate with $k$ bound proteins, which accounts for the degeneracy of choosing $k$ sites out of $n$, is given as $\\omega_k = \\binom{n}{k} ([P]/K_d)^k$. The partition function is the sum over all possible numbers of bound ligands, from $k=0$ to $k=n$.\n$$\nZ = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\omega_k = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{[P]}{K_d}\\right)^k\n$$\nThis sum is the binomial expansion of $\\left(1 + \\frac{[P]}{K_d}\\right)^n$.\n$$\nZ = \\left(1 + \\frac{[P]}{K_d}\\right)^n\n$$\nThe probability of the scaffold having exactly $k$ proteins bound is $P(k) = \\omega_k / Z$. The scaffold is defined as active if at least one site is occupied, which corresponds to the union of states for $k=1, 2, \\dots, n$.

The problem specifies the relation $f/(1-f) \\propto [P]^{n_H}$. Let this be $f_{\\mathrm{coop}}/(1-f_{\\mathrm{coop}}) = C [P]^{n_H}$ for some constant $C$.

The sequestration reaction is given as $R + S \\rightleftharpoons C$. At equilibrium, the concentrations of free species $R_f$ and $S_f$ and the complex $C$ are related by the dissociation constant $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{R_f S_f}{C}$$\nThis allows us to express the concentration of the complex as a function of the free species:\n$$C = \\frac{R_f S_f}{K_d}$$\nThe total concentrations, $R_T$ and $S_T$, are given by the sum of the free species and the complex, due to mass conservation:\n$$R_T = R_f + C$$\n$$S_T = S_f + C$$\nBy substituting the expression for $C$ into these conservation equations, we eliminate $C$ and express the total concentrations as functions of the free concentrations:\n$$R_T = R_f + \\frac{R_f S_f}{K_d} = R_f \\left(1 + \\frac{S_f}{K_d}\\right)$$\n$$S_T = S_f + \\frac{R_f S_f}{K_d} = S_f \\left(1 + \\frac{R_f}{K_d}\\right)$$\nThese two equations represent the required algebraic constraints.\n\n2) Next, we formulate the dynamical equations for the total concentrations, $R_T$ and $S_T$. The total amount of each RNA species changes due to its transcription (production) and the degradation of its free form. The complex $C$ is assumed to be stable and does not degrade. The production terms are given as Hill functions of the free concentrations, and degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta$.\nThe rate of change for $R_T$ is the rate of production of $R$ minus the rate of degradation of $R_f$:\n$$\\frac{dR_T}{dt} = v_R \\frac{R_f^n}{K^n + R_f^n} - \\delta R_f$$\nSimilarly, the rate of change for $S_T$ is:\n$$\\frac{dS_T}{dt} = v_S \\frac{S_f^n}{K^n + S_f^n} - \\delta S_f$$\nThe nullclines of the system are found by setting these time derivatives to zero.

The intersections of these lines correspond to the steady states of the system.\n\n3) We now analyze the symmetric case where $v_R = v_S = v$. We focus on one of the nullcline equations, for example, the one for $R$. Let $x = R_f$. The steady-state equation is:\n$$v \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n} = \\delta x$$\nThis equation has a trivial solution at $x=0$. For non-zero solutions ($x>0$), we can divide by $x$:\n$$v \\frac{x^{n-1}}{K^n + x^n} = \\delta$$\nTo find the condition for multiple solutions, which indicates bistability in this one-dimensional subsystem, we can rearrange the equation to study the function $f(x)$:\n$$\\frac{v}{\\delta} = \\frac{K^n + x^n}{x^{n-1}} = K^n x^{1-n} + x = f(x)$$\nThe number of positive solutions for $x$ is determined by the number of intersections between the curve $y=f(x)$ and the horizontal line $y=v/\\delta$. The emergence of multiple solutions occurs via a saddle-node bifurcation. This happens when the line $y=v/\\delta$ is tangent to the curve $y=f(x)$ at its local minimum. We find this minimum by setting the derivative of $f(x)$ to zero:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( K^n x^{1-n} + x \\right) = (1-n)K^n x^{-n} + 1$$\nSetting $f'(x)=0$ to find the critical point $x_c$:\n$$1 = (n-1)K^n x_c^{-n} \\implies x_c^n = (n-1)K^n \\implies x_c = K(n-1)^{1/n}$$\nThe second derivative is $f''(x) = -n(1-n)K^n x^{-n-1} = n(n-1)K^n x^{-n-1}$. Since $n \\geq 2$, $f''(x)>0$ for $x>0$, so $x_c$ is indeed a local minimum.\nThe saddle-node bifurcation occurs at the critical transcription rate $v^*$ where $v^*/\\delta$ equals the minimum value of $f(x)$, which is $f(x_c)$:\n$$\\frac{v^*}{\\delta} = f(x_c) = K^n \\left(K(n-1)^{1/n}\\right)^{1-n} + K(n-1)^{1/n}$$\nLet's simplify the first term:\n$$K^n \\left(K^{1-n} (n-1)^{(1-n)/n}\\right) = K (n-1)^{1/n - 1} = K \\frac{(n-1)^{1/n}}{n-1}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $v^*/\\delta$:\n$$\\frac{v^*}{\\delta} = K \\frac{(n-1)^{1/n}}{n-1} + K(n-1)^{1/n} = K(n-1)^{1/n} \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1} + 1\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{v^*}{\\delta} = K(n-1)^{1/n} \\left(\\frac{1 + n - 1}{n-1}\\right) = K(n-1)^{1/n} \\frac{n}{n-1}$$\nFinally, we solve for the critical maximal transcription rate $v^*$:\n$$v^* = \\delta K \\frac{n}{n-1} (n-1)^{1/n}$$\nFor $v>v^*$, the equation $f(x) = v/\\delta$ has two positive solutions, corresponding to a stable high-concentration state and an unstable intermediate state. Including the trivial solution $x=0$ (which is stable), the 1D subsystem is bistable.\n\n4) When the maximal transcription rate $v$ is greater than the critical value $v^*$, each isolated subsystem for $R$ and $S$ becomes bistable. This means the nullcline equations $\\dot{R}_T=0$ and $\\dot{S}_T=0$ each have three solutions in terms of free concentrations: $\\{0, R_{f,M}, R_{f,H}\\}$ and $\\{0, S_{f,M}, S_{f,H}\\}$, where the middle solutions $R_{f,M}$ and $S_{f,M}$ are unstable fixed points of the 1D dynamics, while the zero and high-concentration states are stable.\nThe intersections of the vertical $R$-nullclines and horizontal $S$-nullclines define the nine steady states of the full 2D system. The two states corresponding to a toggle switch are $(R_f, S_f)=(R_{f,H}, 0)$ and $(R_f, S_f)=(0, S_{f,H})$.\nThese states are stable. For example, consider the state $(R_{f,H}, 0)$. In the $R_f$ dimension, it is at a stable fixed point of its 1D subsystem. A small perturbation in $S_f$ to a value $\\epsilon>0$ results in a production rate for $S$ of approximately $v\\epsilon^n/K^n$, while the degradation rate is $\\delta\\epsilon$. Since $n \\geq 2$, for small $\\epsilon$, the degradation term dominates, and $\\dot{S}_T \\approx -\\delta \\epsilon < 0$. This negative feedback on $S_f$ near zero, combined with the sequestration of any produced $S$ by the abundant $R_f$, ensures that the system returns to the $S_f=0$ state. The fast binding map from total to free concentrations is monotonic and does not alter the stability of these fixed points. A symmetric argument holds for the stability of the $(0, S_{f,H})$ state.\nThus, for $v > v^*$, the system admits two stable steady states representing the classic toggle switch behavior: one RNA high, the other low (suppressed to zero).", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\delta K \\frac{n}{n-1} \\left(n-1\\right)^{1/n}} $$", "id": "2772210"}]}
