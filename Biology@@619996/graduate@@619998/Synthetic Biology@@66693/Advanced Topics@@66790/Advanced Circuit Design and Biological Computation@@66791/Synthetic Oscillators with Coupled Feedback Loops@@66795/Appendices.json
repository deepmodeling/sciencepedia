Close to this oscillatory onset, center manifold reduction and normal-form theory for a generalized Hopf (also called Bautin) bifurcation imply that the slow-time amplitude $r(t)$ of the dominant oscillatory mode obeys, after nondimensionalization and phase decoupling, the quintic amplitude equation\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{dt} \\;=\\; r\\left(\\mu \\;+\\; \\beta\\, r^{2} \\;-\\; r^{4}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $r \\ge 0$ measures oscillation amplitude of a reporter linked to $a(t)$, the parameter $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the signed distance from the Hopf bifurcation (controlled experimentally by an inducer that tunes the effective transcriptional gain), and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the cubic nonlinearity coefficient determined by the combined shapes of the activation and repression Hill nonlinearities and molecular saturation.

We will therefore proceed by analyzing the provided differential equation, which is well-posed and physically motivated, and dismiss the conflicting textual description as a careless error.\n\nThe problem requires finding the conditions for birhythmicity, defined as the coexistence of a stable quiescent state and a stable oscillatory state. In the context of the given one-dimensional amplitude equation for $r(t) \\ge 0$, this corresponds to the coexistence of a stable fixed point at $r=0$ and a stable fixed point at some $r > 0$.\n\nFixed points, or equilibria, $r^{\\ast}$, of the system are found by setting $\\frac{dr}{dt}=0$:\n$$\nr^{\\ast}\\left(\\mu + \\beta (r^{\\ast})^{2} - (r^{\\ast})^{4}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two possibilities for the fixed points.\n\n1.

The lower bound, $\\mu = -\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{4}$, corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation where the stable and unstable limit cycles are born. The upper bound, $\\mu = 0$, corresponds to the subcritical Hopf bifurcation point where the unstable limit cycle collides with the quiescent state, rendering it unstable.\n\nThe width of this birhythmicity window, $\\Delta\\mu$, is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of this interval:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu = (0) - \\left(-\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^{2}}{4}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nFinally, based on first principles of noisy single-cell dynamics, two experimentally observable signatures of such birhythmicity in time-lapse microscopy data are:\n1.  **Population Bimodality**: A population of isogenic cells, cultured under fixed conditions within the birhythmic parameter window ($-\\beta^{2}/4 < \\mu < 0$), will partition into two distinct subpopulations. One subpopulation will remain in the quiescent state (low, stable reporter signal), while the other will exhibit sustained, large-amplitude oscillations (high, periodically fluctuating reporter signal). A histogram of reporter intensities across the population at any given time would therefore be bimodal.\n2.  **Stochastic, All-or-None Switching**: Individual cells, when tracked over long periods, can exhibit spontaneous, discrete switching between the quiescent and oscillatory states. Due to inherent molecular noise, a cell in the quiescent state can be stochastically \"kicked\" across the separatrix (the unstable limit cycle), triggering an abrupt transition into the stable oscillatory state. This is an all-or-none phenomenon, not a gradual increase in oscillation amplitude, and is a key feature of systems with hard excitation enabled by a subcritical bifurcation.

The dynamics are given by the following system of dimensionless ODEs:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} \\;=\\; k_x\\left[\\alpha_0 + \\alpha\\,\\frac{x^n}{K_x^n + x^n}\\right]\\cdot\\frac{1}{1 + R\\left(\\frac{y}{K_y}\\right)^m} \\;-\\; d_x\\,x,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} \\;=\\; k_y\\,\\frac{x^p}{K_{xy}^p + x^p} \\;-\\; d_y\\,y.\n$$\nThe problem provides a set of fixed parameters: Hill coefficients $n=3$, $m=2$, $p=2$; dissociation constants $K_x=1$, $K_y=1$, $K_{xy}=1$; synthesis rates $k_x=1$, $k_y=1$; degradation rates $d_x=1$, $d_y=0.2$; and a basal activator expression rate $\\alpha_0=0.01$. The parameters $(\\alpha, R)$ are control parameters to be varied.\n\nThe core of the task is to implement a classification algorithm based on numerical integration. For each given pair of control parameters $(\\alpha, R)$, we perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Numerical Integration**: We solve the system of ODEs over the time interval $t \\in [0, T]$ where $T=300$. We must generate solutions at $N=4000$ uniformly spaced time points. This procedure is performed twice for each $(\\alpha, R)$ pair, starting from two distinct initial conditions: $z_1(0) = (x_0^{(1)}, y_0^{(1)}) = (10^{-2}, 10^{-2})$ and $z_2(0) = (x_0^{(2)}, y_0^{(2)}) = (5, 5)$. This requires a numerical ODE solver, for which the `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is appropriate.\n\n2.  **Trajectory Analysis**: For each of the two computed trajectories, we analyze its long-term behavior. The protocol dictates that the first $60\\%$ of the time series data is discarded as transient. The analysis is performed on the final $40\\%$ of the data, from $t=180$ to $t=300$.\n    Within this analysis window, we compute several metrics for each trajectory:\n    - The mean concentrations, $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$.\n    - The relative amplitudes of oscillation, defined as $A_x = \\frac{\\max(x) - \\min(x)}{\\max(10^{-8}, \\bar{x})}$ and $A_y = \\frac{\\max(y) - \\min(y)}{\\max(10^{-8}, \\bar{y})}$. The denominator is regularized to prevent division by zero.\n    - The number of local maxima (peaks) in the $x(t)$ time series. A point $x_i$ at time $t_i$ is a peak if its value is greater than its immediate neighbors, i.e., $x_{i-1} < x_i > x_{i+1}$.\n    - The Euclidean norm of the vector of time derivatives, $\\left\\|\\frac{d}{dt}(x,y)\\right\\|_2$, evaluated at the final time point $t=T=300$.\n\n3.  **Individual Trajectory Classification**: Based on these metrics, each individual trajectory is provisionally classified.\n    - A trajectory is considered **oscillatory** if its relative amplitude $A_x$ is at least $0.15$ and the number of peaks in the analysis window of $x(t)$ is at least $3$.\n    - A trajectory is considered **steady** if $A_x < 0.05$, $A_y < 0.05$, and the norm of the final time derivative is less than $10^{-5}$.\n    Note that a trajectory may be classified as neither oscillatory nor steady if it does not meet these strict criteria.\n\n4.  **Final System Classification**: The final classification for the parameter pair $(\\alpha, R)$ is determined by combining the results from the two initial conditions according to the following ordered logic:\n    - The system is classified as **bistable** (code $2$) if both trajectories are classified as steady, and the mean values of their analysis windows differ significantly. The condition for significant difference is $|\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2| \\ge 0.2$ or $|\\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2| \\ge 0.2$.\n    - If the condition for bistability is not met, the system is classified as **oscillatory** (code $1$) if at least one of the two trajectories is classified as oscillatory.\n    - Otherwise, the system is classified as **steady** (code $0$).\n\nThis rigorous, multi-step protocol translates the qualitative concepts of \"steady state\", \"oscillation\", and \"bistability\" into a concrete, deterministic algorithm. The implementation will follow this procedure precisely for each of the specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the synthetic oscillator classification problem by implementing the\n    specified numerical protocol.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fixed model parameters ---\n    n = 3.0\n    m = 2.0\n    p = 2.0\n    K_x = 1.0\n    K_y = 1.0\n    K_xy = 1.0\n    k_x = 1.0\n    k_y = 1.0\n    d_x = 1.0\n    d_y = 0.2\n    alpha_0 = 0.01\n\n    def ode_system(t, z, alpha, R):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ordinary differential equations for the synthetic oscillator.\n        z = [x, y], where x is activator and y is repressor concentration.\n        \"\"\"\n        x, y = z\n        \n        # Avoid division by zero or negative concentrations, though solver should handle it\n        x = max(0, x)\n        y = max(0, y)\n\n        # Activator equation\n        positive_feedback = alpha * (x**n) / (K_x**n + x**n)\n        repression = 1.0 / (1.0 + R * (y / K_y)**m)\n        dxdt = k_x * (alpha_0 + positive_feedback) * repression - d_x * x\n\n        # Repressor equation\n        activation_of_repressor = k_y * (x**p) / (K_xy**p + x**p)\n        dydt = activation_of_repressor - d_y * y\n\n        return [dxdt, dydt]\n\n    def analyze_trajectory(t, z, alpha, R):\n        \"\"\"\n        Analyzes a single trajectory according to the problem's protocol.\n        \"\"\"\n        x, y = z\n        N = len(t)\n        \n        # Define the analysis window (last 40% of the data)\n        analysis_start_index = int(0.6 * N)\n        x_analysis = x[analysis_start_index:]\n        y_analysis = y[analysis_start_index:]\n        \n        # --- Calculate metrics for classification ---\n\n        # 1.
