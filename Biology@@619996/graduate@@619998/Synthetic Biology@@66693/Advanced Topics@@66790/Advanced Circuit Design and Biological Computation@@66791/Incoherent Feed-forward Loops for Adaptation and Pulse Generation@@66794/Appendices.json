Linearize the two branches as first-order filters driven by the same input. Let $x(t)$ be the activating branch output and $y(t)$ be the repressing branch output.

First, for this critical point to be a maximum, the second derivative $\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dt^{2}}$ must be negative at $t = t_{p}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dt^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{g_{a}}{\\tau_{a}}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{a}) - \\frac{g_{r}}{\\tau_{r}}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{r})\\right) = -\\frac{g_{a}}{\\tau_{a}^{2}}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{a}) + \\frac{g_{r}}{\\tau_{r}^{2}}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{r})\n$$\nAt $t=t_{p}$, we use the condition $\\frac{g_{a}}{\\tau_{a}}\\exp(-t_{p}/\\tau_{a}) = \\frac{g_{r}}{\\tau_{r}}\\exp(-t_{p}/\\tau_{r})$.

The activating branch must be faster than the repressing branch.\n\nWith $\\tau_r  \\tau_a$, the denominator $\\tau_r - \\tau_a$ in the expression for $t_p$ is positive. For $t_p$ to be positive, the numerator $\\ln\\left(\\frac{g_a \\tau_r}{g_r \\tau_a}\\right)$ must also be positive. This requires $\\frac{g_a \\tau_r}{g_r \\tau_a}  1$, which simplifies to $\\frac{g_a}{\\tau_a}  \\frac{g_r}{\\tau_r}$. This inequality has a clear physical interpretation: the initial rate of production of the activator, $\\dot{x}(0) = g_a/\\tau_a$, must be greater than the initial rate of production of the repressor, $\\dot{y}(0) = g_r/\\tau_r$. This ensures that the output $Z(t)$ initially rises from $Z(0)=0$, which is a prerequisite for a peak.\n\nInterpretation of limiting and special cases:\n-   Case $\\tau_{r} \\gg \\tau_{a}$: The repressing branch is much slower than the activating one. In this limit, $\\frac{\\tau_{r}}{\\tau_{r}-\\tau_{a}} \\to 1$, and $t_{p} \\approx \\tau_{a}\\ln\\left(\\frac{g_{a}\\tau_{r}}{g_{r}\\tau_{a}}\\right)$. The system robustly generates a pulse. The peak time $t_{p}$ increases logarithmically with the repressor time constant $\\tau_{r}$, meaning a slower repression leads to a later peak.\n-   Case $\\tau_{a} \\gg \\tau_{r}$: The activator is much slower than the repressor. The condition for a maximum, $\\tau_{a}  \\tau_{r}$, is violated. No peak (maximum) occurs. Instead, if $\\frac{g_a}{\\tau_a}  \\frac{g_r}{\\tau_r}$, the output $Z(t)$ initially decreases, creating a trough.\n-   Case $g_{a} = g_{r}$: This corresponds to perfect adaptation, where the steady-state output is $Z(\\infty) = g_a - g_r = 0$. The output returns precisely to its pre-stimulus level. The expression for the peak time simplifies to $t_{p} = \\frac{\\tau_{a}\\tau_{r}}{\\tau_{r} - \\tau_{a}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{r}}{\\tau_{a}}\\right)$. A peak exists if and only if $\\tau_{r}  \\tau_{a}$, confirming that the temporal dynamics, not just the steady-state gains, are critical for pulse generation.\n\nThe final derived expression for $t_{p}$ encapsulates these conditions.

Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = 0\n$$\nWe will solve this system for a generic, constant input level $X$. The given differential equations become a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state concentrations, which we denote as $Y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_{y} X - \\beta_{y} Y_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_{1} X - \\alpha_{2} Y_{\\mathrm{ss}} + k_{0} - \\beta_{z} Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, we can directly solve for $Y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ as a function of $X$:\n$$\n\\beta_{y} Y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\alpha_{y} X \\implies Y_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X) = \\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}} X\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the steady-state level of the repressor $Y$ is directly proportional to the input signal $X$.\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $Y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ into the second equation to find $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_{1} X - \\alpha_{2} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}} X\\right) + k_{0} - \\beta_{z} Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\n\\beta_{z} Z_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\alpha_{1} X - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}} X + k_{0}\n$$\nFactoring out $X$ gives:\n$$\n\\beta_{z} Z_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X + k_{0}\n$$\nFinally, the steady-state concentration of the output $Z$ as a function of the input $X$ is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a pre-step steady state at $X=X_{0}$ and a post-step steady state at $X=X_{1}$. Using the derived general formula for $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X)$, these are:\n- Pre-step steady state ($X_{0}$): $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X_{0}) = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{0} + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$\n- Post-step steady state ($X_{1}$): $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X_{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{1} + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$\n\nPerfect adaptation occurs when the steady-state output $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is independent of the input level $X$. Inspecting the general expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X)$, this independence requires the coefficient of the term containing $X$ to be zero:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}} = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to the well-known condition for perfect adaptation in a linearized I-FFL:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{y} = \\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}\n$$\nThis condition represents a \"balancing\" of the two pathways from $X$ to $Z$: the direct activation path (with strength proportional to $\\alpha_{1}$) and the indirect repression path (with strength proportional to $\\alpha_{2} \\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}$).\n\nThe presence of the leaky expression term $k_{0}$ does not affect the condition for perfect adaptation, as $k_{0}$ does not appear in the expression $\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{y} = \\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}$. However, if the adaptation condition is met, the steady-state value of $Z$ becomes $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$. This means that the leaky expression sets the baseline level to which the system adapts.\n\nThe final task is to derive an expression for the baseline-subtracted steady-state change, $\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}}$. Using its definition and the expressions for the pre-step and post-step steady states:\n$$\n\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}} = Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X_{1}) - Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X_{0})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{1} + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{0} + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}} \\right]\n$$\nThe constant term $\\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$ cancels out, demonstrating that baseline subtraction indeed removes the effect of the leaky production term on the change in steady state:\n$$\n\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{1} - \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{0}\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms yields the final expression:\n$$\n\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) (X_{1} - X_{0})\n$$\nTo present this as a single fraction without nested fractions, we find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{y} - \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) (X_{1} - X_{0})\n$$\nThis gives the final closed-form analytic expression:\n$$\n\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}} = \\frac{(\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{y} - \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{y})(X_{1} - X_{0})}{\\beta_{y}\\beta_{z}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{y} - \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{y})(X_{1} - X_{0})}{\\beta_{y}\\beta_{z}}}\n$$", "id": "2747353"}, {"introduction": "While linear models provide invaluable insight, real biological systems are inherently nonlinear, often due to saturation effects in processes like transcription factor binding.
