The analysis will proceed in three steps as requested: linearization, stability analysis, and derivation of the oscillation frequency at the Hopf bifurcation.\n\nFirst, we linearize the system around the steady state $(x_1^*, x_2^*, x_3^*)$. The local dynamics are described by the Jacobian matrix $J$, where the elements are $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}$ evaluated at the steady state.

This is the central idea of the describing function method. The effective gain of the nonlinearity, when driven by a sinusoid of amplitude $A$, is averaged over one cycle. This effective gain, which we identify with $\\sigma(A)$, must decrease with amplitude due to saturation of the Hill function. For small amplitudes $A \\to 0$, the system behaves linearly, and the growth rate approaches the small-signal loop gain, which we call $\\sigma_0$. As the amplitude $A$ increases, the oscillation begins to sample the saturated parts of the Hill function (where $x \\gg K$ or $x \\ll K$), where the gain $|f'(x)|$ is small. This causes the effective gain $\\sigma(A)$ to decrease.\n\nA rigorous derivation of the describing function for a Hill-type nonlinearity is complex.

For large amplitudes ($A \\gg A_s$), the term $(A/A_s)^h$ dominates the denominator, causing $\\sigma(A)$ to decrease as $A^{-h}$. This represents the gain compression caused by promoter saturation.\n3.  The parameter $A_s$ sets the amplitude scale at which saturation becomes significant. It represents the transition from the linear to the saturated regime.\n4.  The parameter $h$ controls the sharpness of this transition, consistent with its role in determining the steepness of the underlying Hill function.\n\nNext, we must find the nonzero steady-state amplitude, denoted $A^*$.
