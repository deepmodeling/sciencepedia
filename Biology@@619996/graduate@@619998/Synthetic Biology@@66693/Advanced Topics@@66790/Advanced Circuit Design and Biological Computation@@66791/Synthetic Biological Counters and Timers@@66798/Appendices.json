The proteolysis is controlled by a tunable protease tag, such that strengthening the tag changes the degradation rate constant from $\\gamma$ to $\\gamma'$. Assume that messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is not limiting and that the protein dynamics can be modeled as a single-species birth–death process whose mean behavior is governed by the mass-action ordinary differential equation $dP/dt = k - \\gamma P$ with initial condition $P(0) = 0$, where $P(t)$ is the mean protein copy number at time $t$.

We will proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe system's escape from state A to state B is a stochastic process driven by thermal noise. The problem states that this process can be modeled using the Kramers escape theory for an overdamped system. The rate of escape, $k_{esc}$, over a potential barrier of height $\\Delta U$ in the presence of noise of strength $D$ is given by the Arrhenius-Kramers formula:\n$$ k_{esc} = k_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U}{D}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_{0}$ is the attempt frequency or pre-exponential factor, which is given as a constant.\n\nDuring an input pulse of amplitude $A$, the potential landscape is tilted, and the barrier height is reduced to $\\Delta U(A) = \\Delta U_{0} - \\alpha A$.

Before proceeding, the problem statement is validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a classic nonparalyzable dead-time counting problem, which is a standard model in stochastic processes.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the process. Input pulses arrive according to a homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate $\\lambda$. When a pulse arrives at a time when the counter is \"ready\", it triggers a response. This pulse is the \"triggering pulse\" for a \"reported count\". Upon being triggered, the counter enters a \"dead\" or unresponsive state for a fixed duration $\\tau$. Any pulses that arrive during this time interval do not trigger a new count. After the time $\\tau$ has elapsed, the counter returns to the \"ready\" state and can be triggered by the next arriving pulse.\n\nThe problem defines a \"merged count\" as a reported count that results from at least $2$ input pulses. Since a reported count is, by definition, initiated by a single triggering pulse, this means a merged count occurs if the triggering pulse is followed by at least one additional pulse within the subsequent response window of duration $\\tau$.\n\nLet us consider a triggering pulse that arrives at an arbitrary time $t_{0}$. This event initiates a reported count and renders the counter unresponsive for the time interval $(t_{0}, t_{0} + \\tau]$. A merged count will be registered if and only if the number of additional input pulses arriving within this specific interval is one or more.\n\nA fundamental property of the homogeneous Poisson process is that the number of arrivals in disjoint time intervals is statistically independent. This is often referred to as the property of independent increments. A consequence of this is the memoryless property: the behavior of the process after any time $t$ is independent of the history of the process up to time $t$. Therefore, the occurrence of a triggering pulse at $t_{0}$ has no influence on the arrival of subsequent pulses in the interval $(t_{0}, t_{0} + \\tau]$.\n\nThe number of events, which we will denote by $N_{\\tau}$, occurring in any time interval of fixed length $\\tau$ for a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ is described by the Poisson distribution. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$\nP(N_{\\tau} = k) = \\frac{(\\lambda\\tau)^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)}{k!}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) and the mean of the distribution is $\\mu = \\lambda\\tau$.\n\nWe are interested in the event that a reported count is a merged count. This corresponds to the condition that the number of additional pulses, $N_{\\tau}$, in the response window of length $\\tau$ is at least $1$. The probability of this event, $P_{\\text{merge}}(\\lambda,\\tau)$, is therefore $P(N_{\\tau} \\geq 1)$.\n\nIt is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that no additional pulses arrive in the interval. This corresponds to $N_{\\tau} = 0$. The probability of a reported count *not* being a merged count is $P(N_{\\tau} = 0)$.\n\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function with $k=0$, we find:\n$$\nP(N_{\\tau} = 0) = \\frac{(\\lambda\\tau)^{0} \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)}{0!}\n$$\nBy definition, $0! = 1$ and $(\\lambda\\tau)^{0} = 1$ for any non-zero $\\lambda\\tau$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nP(N_{\\tau} = 0) = \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)\n$$\nThe probability that the count is merged, $P(N_{\\tau} \\geq 1)$, is the complement of the probability that it is not merged, $P(N_{\\tau} = 0)$. Therefore:\n$$\nP_{\\text{merge}}(\\lambda,\\tau) = P(N_{\\tau} \\geq 1) = 1 - P(N_{\\tau} = 0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(N_{\\tau} = 0)$, we arrive at the final expression for the probability of a merged count:\n$$\nP_{\\text{merge}}(\\lambda,\\tau) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the product of the arrival rate $\\lambda$ and the response time $\\tau$, which is the mean number of pulses expected within a response window.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\tau)}\n$$", "id": "2777809"}]}
