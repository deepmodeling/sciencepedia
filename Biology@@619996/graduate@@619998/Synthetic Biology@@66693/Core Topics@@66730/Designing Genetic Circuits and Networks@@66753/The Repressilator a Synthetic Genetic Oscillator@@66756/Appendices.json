The system's dynamics are governed by a set of parameters, and the behavior can be described by a functional relationship between these parameters.\n\nLet the set of all physical parameters that govern the system be $\\{k_m, k_p, \\delta_m, \\delta_p, K, h\\}$. The total number of parameters is $n=6$. The problem states that the only relevant fundamental physical dimensions are concentration, which we denote by $[C]$, and time, which we denote by $[T]$. The number of fundamental dimensions is $d=2$.\n\nTo apply the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, we must first determine the dimensions of each parameter in terms of these fundamental dimensions.\nThe governing ordinary differential equations, while not explicitly provided, can be inferred from the description of the processes:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_i}{dt} = \\text{production} - \\text{degradation} = f(P_j) - \\delta_m M_i\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP_i}{dt} = \\text{production} - \\text{degradation} = k_p M_i - \\delta_p P_i\n$$\nThe concentrations $M_i$ and $P_i$ both have dimensions of $[C]$. The time $t$ has dimension $[T]$.\n\nFrom the structure of these equations, we deduce the dimensions of the parameters:\n1.  The term $\\delta_p P_i$ must have the same dimensions as $\\frac{dP_i}{dt}$, which are $[C][T]^{-1}$. Therefore, $[\\delta_p][C] = [C][T]^{-1}$, which implies that the protein degradation rate $\\delta_p$ has dimensions $[\\delta_p] = [T]^{-1}$.\n2.  Similarly, for the mRNA degradation term $\\delta_m M_i$, we have $[\\delta_m][C] = [C][T]^{-1}$, so the mRNA degradation rate $\\delta_m$ has dimensions $[\\delta_m] = [T]^{-1}$.\n3.  For the translation term $k_p M_i$, we have $[k_p][C] = [C][T]^{-1}$, so the translation rate constant $k_p$ has dimensions $[k_p] = [T]^{-1}$.\n4.  The transcription is described by a Hill function. The rate of transcription, $f(P_j)$, has dimensions of concentration per unit time, $[C][T]^{-1}$. The Hill function is given as $\\frac{k_m}{1 + (P_j/K)^h}$. For the argument of the Hill function $(P_j/K)$ to be dimensionless, the parameter $K$, the half-maximal concentration, must have the same dimensions as the protein concentration $P_j$. Thus, $[K] = [C]$.\n5.  Since the denominator $1 + (P_j/K)^h$ is dimensionless, the overall dimensions of the transcription term are determined by the transcription rate constant $k_m$. Thus, $[k_m] = [C][T]^{-1}$.\n6.  The Hill coefficient $h$ is an exponent in a dimensionless term and is explicitly stated to be intrinsically dimensionless. Thus, $[h] = [C]^0[T]^0 = 1$.\n\nThe dimensions of the $n=6$ parameters are as follows:\n- $[k_m] = [C]^{1}[T]^{-1}$\n- $[k_p] = [C]^{0}[T]^{-1}$\n- $[\\delta_m] = [C]^{0}[T]^{-1}$\n- $[\\delta_p] = [C]^{0}[T]^{-1}$\n- $[K] = [C]^{1}[T]^{0}$\n- $[h] = [C]^{0}[T]^{0}$\n\nThe Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem states that the number of independent dimensionless groups, $k$, that can be formed from a set of $n$ physical parameters is given by $k = n - r$, where $r$ is the rank of the dimensional matrix constructed from these parameters.\n\nThe dimensional matrix is constructed by listing the exponents of the fundamental dimensions for each parameter. The rows correspond to the fundamental dimensions ($[C]$, $[T]$) and the columns correspond to the parameters ($k_m, k_p, \\delta_m, \\delta_p, K, h$).\n\nThe dimensional matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe number of parameters is $n=6$. We must now find the rank, $r$, of the matrix $A$. The rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). The two rows of the matrix are $(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)$ and $(-1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0)$. Since the first row is not a scalar multiple of the second row, the two rows are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is $r=2$.\n\nApplying the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem:\n$$\nk = n - r\n$$\nSubstituting the values $n=6$ and $r=2$:\n$$\nk = 6 - 2 = 4\n$$\nThus, there are $4$ independent dimensionless groups that control the dynamics of the symmetric repressilator. The problem states that intrinsically dimensionless parameters that cannot be eliminated by scaling must be counted. The application of the theorem in this manner correctly includes the dimensionless parameter $h$ as one of the resulting groups, as it corresponds to a column of zeros in the dimensional matrix, which contributes to $n$ but not to $r$. The scaling of state variables ($M_i, P_i$) and time ($t$) corresponds to choosing a basis of $r=2$ parameters (e.g., $K$ as the concentration scale and $\\delta_p^{-1}$ as the time scale) to non-dimensionalize the system, leaving $k = n-r$ dimensionless groups.

The system consists of six ordinary differential equations ($3$ for mRNA, $3$ for protein) which are nondimensionalized into a singularly perturbed form, with a parameter $\\varepsilon = \\delta_p/\\delta_m$ separating the fast mRNA dynamics from the slow protein dynamics for the biologically relevant case $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$. The problem asks for an evaluation of statements regarding the validity of a model reduction, where the fast mRNA dynamics are eliminated by taking the formal limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$.\n\nThe problem setup is scientifically sound, mathematically consistent, and well-posed. It is grounded in the established principles of chemical kinetics and dynamical systems theory, specifically geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). The premises are valid, and we may proceed with the analysis of the options.\n\nThe full system in dimensionless form is given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon\\,\\frac{d y_i}{d \\tau} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1+x_{i-1}^{\\,n}} \\;-\\; y_i \\equiv f_i(x,y)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d x_i}{d \\tau} \\;=\\; \\alpha\\, y_i \\;-\\; x_i \\equiv g_i(x,y)\n$$\nfor $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, with indices taken modulo $3$. Here, $y_i$ are the fast variables (mRNA concentrations) and $x_i$ are the slow variables (protein concentrations).\n\nThe reduction procedure involves analyzing the system in the limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. We first identify the critical manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0$, which is the set of points where the fast dynamics are at equilibrium:\n$$\nf_i(x,y) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad y_i \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1+x_{i-1}^{\\,n}}\n$$\nThe dynamics on this manifold, known as the reduced flow or slow flow, are obtained by substituting this quasi-steady-state condition into the slow dynamics equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_i}{d \\tau} \\;=\\; \\alpha\\,\\frac{1}{1+x_{i-1}^{\\,n}} \\;-\\; x_i\n$$\nThe validity of this reduction hinges on the stability of the critical manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0$ with respect to the fast dynamics. We examine the Jacobian of the fast vector field $f = (f_1, f_2, f_3)$ with respect to the fast variables $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)$:\n$$\nJ_y(f) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; -I_3\n$$\nwhere $I_3$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. The eigenvalues of this Jacobian are all $-1$. Since all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts, the critical manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0$ is uniformly attracting for the fast subsystem. In the language of GSPT, this means $\\mathcal{C}_0$ is a normally hyperbolic attracting manifold. Fenichel's theorems on the persistence of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds then provide the rigorous foundation for relating the dynamics of the full system to the reduced system for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If $\\varepsilon\\ll 1$ and the $3$-protein reduced system possesses a hyperbolic limit cycle, then for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$ the full $6$-dimensional system admits a nearby limit cycle whose amplitude and period differ from those of the reduced cycle by at most order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$.**\n\nThis statement is a direct and standard application of Fenichel's theorems. Given that the critical manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0$ is normally hyperbolic, any hyperbolic invariant set of the reduced flow, such as a hyperbolic limit cycle, persists as a nearby invariant set for the full system for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$. More precisely, if the reduced flow on $\\mathcal{C}_0$ has a hyperbolic limit cycle $\\gamma_0$, then for small enough $\\varepsilon$, the full system has a unique hyperbolic limit cycle $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ in a neighborhood of $\\gamma_0$. Furthermore, the geometry and dynamical properties of $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$, such as its period and amplitude, can be expressed as an asymptotic series in $\\varepsilon$, with the leading-order term being the property of $\\gamma_0$ and the first correction being of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. The statement is a correct articulation of a central result of singular perturbation theory.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Eliminating mRNA is valid when $\\varepsilon\\gg 1$ because proteins equilibrate faster than mRNA, so setting $\\dfrac{d x_i}{d \\tau}\\approx 0$ preserves the phase lag that sustains oscillations.**\n\nThis statement is flawed in its reasoning. The parameter $\\varepsilon = \\delta_p/\\delta_m$ represents the ratio of the protein decay rate to the mRNA decay rate. The condition $\\varepsilon \\gg 1$ implies $\\delta_p \\gg \\delta_m$, meaning that proteins decay much faster than mRNA. In this regime, proteins are the fast species and mRNA are the slow species. A valid quasi-steady-state approximation would involve eliminating the fast protein variables, not the slow mRNA variables. This would correspond to setting $\\frac{dx_i}{d\\tau} \\approx 0$, which yields $x_i \\approx \\alpha y_i$. The procedure mentioned in the problem statement—eliminating mRNA via $y_i = 1/(1+x_{i-1}^n)$—is derived from the limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ and is only valid when $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$. Applying it for $\\varepsilon \\gg 1$ is a fundamental error. The statement confuses the condition ($\\varepsilon \\gg 1$) with the procedure valid for the opposite limit.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Eliminating mRNA necessarily destroys oscillations because the mRNA layer supplies the only dynamical delay; hence the reduced $3$-protein system cannot oscillate for any $n$ and $\\alpha$.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The reduced $3$-protein system is a classic example of a system that can generate oscillations through a negative feedback loop. The structure of the system, where $x_1$ represses $x_2$, $x_2$ represses $x_3$, and $x_3$ represses $x_1$, constitutes a feedback loop of length $3$. It is a well-established result from the theory of feedback oscillators that such a loop can produce sustained oscillations, provided the \"gain\" and \"phase shift\" are sufficient. In this model, this translates to the requirement that the repressive nonlinearity is sufficiently steep. Linear stability analysis of the reduced system's unique fixed point shows that a Hopf bifurcation occurs and sustained oscillations emerge for a Hill coefficient $n > 2$. Therefore, the claim that the reduced system cannot oscillate for any $n$ and $\\alpha$ is false. The problem statement itself correctly assumes that parameters can be chosen for the reduced system to oscillate.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The critical manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0=\\{(x,y): y_i=\\dfrac{1}{1+x_{i-1}^{\\,n}}\\}$ is normally hyperbolic and attracting for all $x$, so geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) ensures persistence of qualitative dynamics from the reduced flow to the full system for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$.**\n\nAs established in the preliminary analysis, the stability of the critical manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0$ with respect to the fast dynamics is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $\\partial f / \\partial y$. We calculated this Jacobian to be $-I_3$, whose eigenvalues are all $-1$. Since none of the eigenvalues have zero real part, the manifold $\\mathcal{C}_0$ is, by definition, normally hyperbolic. Since all eigenvalues are negative, it is an attracting manifold. This is precisely the condition required for the application of Fenichel's theorems, which form the core of GSPT. These theorems guarantee that for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a slow manifold $\\mathcal{C}_\\varepsilon$ near $\\mathcal{C}_0$ that is invariant under the full flow, and the dynamics on $\\mathcal{C}_\\varepsilon$ are a small perturbation of the reduced dynamics on $\\mathcal{C}_0$. This ensures that the qualitative features of the reduced flow (such as hyperbolic fixed points and limit cycles) persist in the full system. The statement is a correct and precise justification for the model reduction.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Even when $\\varepsilon$ is small, eliminating mRNA can shift the oscillation boundary: close to the onset of oscillations, the reduced model may predict no oscillation while the full model oscillates due to the additional phase lag from finite mRNA dynamics; therefore, reduction without qualitative change is most reliable when the reduced limit cycle is strongly hyperbolic (for example, Floquet multipliers bounded away from the unit circle).**\n\nThis statement addresses a critical and subtle aspect of singular perturbation analysis. GSPT guarantees persistence of *hyperbolic* objects. The onset of oscillation occurs at a Hopf bifurcation, which is a non-hyperbolic point. At such a bifurcation, the system is not structurally stable, and small perturbations—in this case, the terms of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$ that distinguish the full system from the reduced one—can lead to a qualitative change in the dynamics. The finite decay time of mRNA ($\\varepsilon > 0$) introduces an additional dynamical delay, or phase lag, into the feedback loop. This additional lag can enable oscillations in parameter regimes where the reduced model (with zero lag from mRNA) predicts a stable steady state. Consequently, the true boundary for oscillations in the full system's parameter space does not exactly coincide with the boundary predicted by the reduced model. The approximation is therefore least reliable near bifurcation boundaries. Conversely, the reduction is most reliable far from any bifurcation, where the limit cycle is \"strongly\" hyperbolic—meaning its Floquet multipliers are far from the unit circle in the complex plane. This robustness ensures that an $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$ perturbation will not be sufficient to cross a bifurcation boundary and alter the qualitative dynamics.

Using the fixed point condition $\\gamma = x^{\\ast}(1+(x^{\\ast})^n)$, we can simplify $g$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{-x^{\\ast}(1+(x^{\\ast})^n) n (x^{\\ast})^{n-1}}{(1+(x^{\\ast})^n)^2} = \\frac{-n(x^{\\ast})^n}{1+(x^{\\ast})^n}\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix for the system $(\\dot{x}_1, \\dot{x}_2, \\dot{x}_3)^T$ with dependencies on $(x_3, x_1, x_2)$ respectively, is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & g \\\\ g & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & g & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix can be written as $J = -I + gP$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix and $P$ is the cyclic permutation matrix:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $P$ is a circulant matrix representing a unidirectional permutation, and $-I$ is also a circulant matrix (and diagonal), the Jacobian $J$ is a circulant matrix, which can be described as a circulant perturbation of the identity matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J$ are related to the eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $P$ by $\\lambda = -1 + g\\mu$. The eigenvalues of the permutation matrix $P$ are the cube roots of unity, scaled appropriately due to its structure. More formally, for a $3 \\times 3$ circulant matrix with first row $(c_0, c_1, c_2)$, the eigenvalues are $\\mu_k = c_0 + c_1 \\omega^k + c_2 \\omega^{2k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, with $\\omega = \\exp(2\\pi i/3)$. For $P$, the first row is $(0, 0, 1)$, so its eigenvalues are $\\mu_k = \\omega^{2k}$.\n$\\mu_0 = \\omega^0 = 1$.\n$\\mu_1 = \\omega^2 = \\exp(4\\pi i/3) = -1/2 - i\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n$\\mu_2 = \\omega^4 = \\omega = \\exp(2\\pi i/3) = -1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Jacobian $J$ are therefore:\n$\\lambda_0 = g\\mu_0 - 1 = g - 1$.\n$\\lambda_{1,2} = g\\mu_{2,1} - 1 = g(-1/2 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}/2) - 1 = -1 - g/2 \\pm i g\\sqrt{3}/2$.\nSince $x^{\\ast}>0$ and $n \\ge 2$, $g$ is a negative real number. Let $g = -|g|$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_0 = -|g|-1 < 0$ and $\\lambda_{1,2} = -1 + |g|/2 \\mp i|g|\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n\nA Hopf bifurcation occurs when the real part of the complex-conjugate eigenvalue pair crosses zero.\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{1,2}) = -1 + \\frac{|g|}{2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad |g| = 2\n$$\nSince $g$ is negative, the condition is $g=-2$. We must have oscillations only if $|g|$ can reach $2$. The range of $g$ is $g = \\frac{-n(x^*)^n}{1+(x^*)^n}$, which maps $x^* \\in (0, \\infty)$ to $g \\in (-n, 0)$. Thus, the condition $|g|=2$ can only be satisfied if $n>2$. For $n=2$, $|g|<2$, so the fixed point is always stable and no bifurcation occurs.\n\nAt the Hopf bifurcation point ($g=-2$), the imaginary part of the eigenvalues is non-zero:\n$$\n\\text{Im}(\\lambda_{1,2}) = \\mp \\frac{|g|\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\mp \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\mp\\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThe dimensionless angular frequency of oscillations at the onset is the magnitude of this imaginary part, $\\omega^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe corresponding dimensionless period is:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega^{\\ast}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThis value is a constant, $T^{\\ast} \\approx 3.6276$. It is a number of order one. This result holds for any set of parameters that are tuned to the Hopf bifurcation point ($g=-2$), which justifies the statement that \"$T^{\\ast}$ is approximately of order one over a wide parameter regime near oscillation onset\".\n\nFinally, we relate the dimensionless period to the dimensional period $T$. The time scaling is $\\tau = \\delta_p t$. A dimensionless period interval $T^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a dimensional period interval $T$ by the relation:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\delta_p T\n$$\nTherefore, the dimensional period is $T = \\frac{T^{\\ast}}{\\delta_p}$. Substituting the value of $T^{\\ast}$ at the Hopf bifurcation point:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{\\delta_p} \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the dimensional period of oscillation at its onset scales inversely with the protein degradation rate $\\delta_p$. Given $\\delta_p$ in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $T$ will be in units of seconds.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}\\delta_p}}\n$$", "id": "2784246"}]}
