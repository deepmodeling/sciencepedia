We must first validate the problem's integrity, which it passes. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. We may thus proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is a simple repression architecture where a repressor transcription factor, $R$, binds to a single operator site on the DNA, $O$, to form a complex, $RO$. This process is governed by the reversible reaction at equilibrium:\n$$ R + O \\rightleftharpoons RO $$\nThe strength of this interaction is quantified by the dissociation constant, $K_D$, defined as:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[R][O]}{[RO]} $$\nwhere $[R]$, $[O]$, and $[RO]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free repressor, free operator, and the repressor-operator complex, respectively.\n\nThe standard-state free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, is related to the dissociation constant through the fundamental thermodynamic relationship:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln(K_{eq}) $$\nFor a dissociation reaction where one molecule yields two, the equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$ must be made dimensionless by dividing concentrations by the standard state concentration, $c^0$. Thus, $K_{eq} = K_D/c^0$. The relationship becomes:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_D}{c^0}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This equation forms the bridge between the macroscopic thermodynamic parameter $\\Delta G^\\circ$ and the microscopic equilibrium parameter $K_D$.\n\nPromoter activity in this model is a function of operator occupancy. The occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of operator sites bound by the repressor:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\text{Bound Operators}]}{[\\text{Total Operators}]} = \\frac{[RO]}{[O] + [RO]} $$\nBy dividing the numerator and denominator by $[RO]$ and using the definition of $K_D$ to express $[O]/[RO]$ as $K_D/[R]$, we obtain the occupancy as a function of the free repressor concentration $[R]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[O]}{[RO]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_D}{[R]}} = \\frac{[R]}{K_D + [R]} $$\nThis is the Langmuir isotherm for single-site binding.\n\nThe problem defines the gate threshold, which we denote as $C_{th}$, as the free TF concentration $[R]$ at which the promoter output is halfway between its unbound and bound states. This corresponds to an operator occupancy of $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. We set $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ in the occupancy equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{C_{th}}{K_D + C_{th}} $$\nSolving for $C_{th}$, we find:\n$$ K_D + C_{th} = 2C_{th} \\implies C_{th} = K_D $$\nThis is a critical result: for this simple repression system, the gate's threshold concentration is numerically equal to the dissociation constant of the repressor-operator interaction.\n\nNow, we analyze the effect of the mutation. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ (consensus operator) and the mutated state by subscript $2$ (weakened operator). The mutation induces a change in the standard-state binding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G^\\circ_2 - \\Delta G^\\circ_1$. Using our established relations:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_1 = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{D,1}}{c^0}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta G^\\circ_2 = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{D,2}}{c^0}\\right) $$\nHere, $K_{D,1} = C_{th,1}$ and $K_{D,2} = C_{th,2}$.\nThe change $\\Delta\\Delta G$ is then:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{D,2}}{c^0}\\right) - RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{D,1}}{c^0}\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{D,2}}{K_{D,1}}\\right) $$\nSince $C_{th} = K_D$, the ratio of the dissociation constants is equal to the ratio of the threshold concentrations:\n$$ \\frac{K_{D,2}}{K_{D,1}} = \\frac{C_{th,2}}{C_{th,1}} $$\nSubstituting this into the free energy equation and solving for the fold-change in the threshold concentration gives the propagation mechanism:\n$$ \\frac{C_{th,2}}{C_{th,1}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G}{RT}\\right) $$\nA positive $\\Delta\\Delta G$ ($1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) signifies that the binding is weakened, making the free energy of binding less favorable (less negative or more positive). This leads to an increase in $K_D$ and, consequently, an increase in the threshold concentration $C_{th}$.\n\nTo address the question of how operator occupancy changes at the original threshold, we must calculate the occupancy of the mutated operator, $\\theta_2$, at the original threshold concentration, $[R] = C_{th,1} = K_{D,1}$.\n$$ \\theta_2([R] = K_{D,1}) = \\frac{K_{D,1}}{K_{D,2} + K_{D,1}} $$\nBy dividing the numerator and denominator by $K_{D,1}$, we express this in terms of the fold-change, $\\frac{K_{D,2}}{K_{D,1}}$:\n$$ \\theta_2([R] = K_{D,1}) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D,2}}{K_{D,1}} + 1} $$\nSince $\\Delta\\Delta G > 0$, the fold-change $\\frac{K_{D,2}}{K_{D,1}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)$ is greater than $1$. Therefore, the new occupancy at the original threshold concentration is $\\theta_2 < \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is a logical consequence of the weakened binding affinity.\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value for the fold-change in the threshold concentration.

The total transcriptional output is the weighted average of the activity of each state.\n\nLet us first analyze the $1$-site architecture. The promoter has a single operator site to which the repressor transcription factor (TF) can bind. There are two possible states for this system:\n$1$. The operator site is unbound.
