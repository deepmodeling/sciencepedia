It is expressed in objective, formal language. The problem does not violate any principles of mathematics or science, contains no missing or contradictory information, and is a formalizable and relevant exercise in the analysis of synthetic genetic circuits. It is not trivial, as it requires distinguishing between an absolute output threshold and a relative one defined by the system's own dynamic range.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires finding the concentration $A_{0.5}$ at which the output $y$ equals an absolute value of $0.5$. We set the given expression for $y$ to $0.5$:\n$$0.5 = \\beta + (1-\\beta)\\frac{A_{0.5}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{0.5}^{n}}$$\nTo solve for $A_{0.5}$, we first isolate the term containing it.\n$$0.5 - \\beta = (1-\\beta)\\frac{A_{0.5}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{0.5}^{n}}$$\nProvided that $\\beta \\ne 1$, which is given by the problem constraint $0 \\le \\beta < 1$, we can divide by $(1-\\beta)$:\n$$\\frac{0.5 - \\beta}{1 - \\beta} = \\frac{A_{0.5}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{0.5}^{n}}$$\nLet us invert both sides to simplify the algebra:\n$$\\frac{1 - \\beta}{0.5 - \\beta} = \\frac{K^{n} + A_{0.5}^{n}}{A_{0.5}^{n}} = \\frac{K^{n}}{A_{0.5}^{n}} + 1$$\nNow, we solve for the ratio $(K/A_{0.5})^n$:\n$$\\frac{K^{n}}{A_{0.5}^{n}} = \\frac{1 - \\beta}{0.5 - \\beta} - 1 = \\frac{(1 - \\beta) - (0.5 - \\beta)}{0.5 - \\beta} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5 - \\beta}$$\nSolving for $A_{0.5}^{n}$:\n$$A_{0.5}^{n} = K^{n} \\frac{0.5 - \\beta}{0.5} = K^{n}(1 - 2\\beta)$$\nTaking the $n$-th root gives the expression for $A_{0.5}$:\n$$A_{0.5} = K (1 - 2\\beta)^{1/n}$$\nFor $A_{0.5}$ to exist as a real, positive concentration, the term within the parentheses must be strictly positive. This leads to the constraint $1 - 2\\beta > 0$, which simplifies to $\\beta < 0.5$. If $\\beta \\ge 0.5$, the basal expression is already at or above the target output, so an absolute output of $y=0.5$ cannot be reached by increasing $A$ from $0$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the half-maximal effective concentration, $A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}$. This is defined relative to the promoter's minimal and maximal outputs.\nFirst, we determine the minimal output, $y_{\\min}$, which occurs at $A=0$:\n$$y_{\\min} = y(0) = \\beta + (1-\\beta)\\frac{0^{n}}{K^{n} + 0^{n}} = \\beta$$\nNext, we determine the maximal output, $y_{\\max}$, which occurs in the limit as $A \\to \\infty$:\n$$y_{\\max} = \\lim_{A\\to\\infty} \\left[ \\beta + (1-\\beta)\\frac{A^{n}}{K^{n} + A^{n}} \\right]$$\nTo evaluate the limit, we divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $A^n$:\n$$y_{\\max} = \\beta + (1-\\beta) \\lim_{A\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{(K/A)^{n} + 1} = \\beta + (1-\\beta)\\frac{1}{0+1} = \\beta + (1-\\beta) = 1$$\nThe output required for the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is the value halfway between $y_{\\min}$ and $y_{\\max}$:\n$$y_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}} = \\frac{y_{\\min} + y_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{\\beta + 1}{2}$$\nNow, we must find the concentration $A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}$ that produces this output level by setting $y(A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}) = y_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}$:\n$$\\frac{1+\\beta}{2} = \\beta + (1-\\beta)\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}$$\nIsolating the term with $A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}$:\n$$\\frac{1+\\beta}{2} - \\beta = (1-\\beta)\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}$$\n$$\\frac{1+\\beta - 2\\beta}{2} = \\frac{1-\\beta}{2} = (1-\\beta)\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}$$\nSince $1-\\beta \\ne 0$, we can divide both sides by $(1-\\beta)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}{K^{n} + A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}}$$\nThis simple relation can be solved for $A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^n$:\n$$K^{n} + A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n} = 2 A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}$$\n$$K^{n} = A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}^{n}$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides, and knowing that both $K$ and $A$ must be positive, we find:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}} = K$$\nThis result demonstrates that the half-maximal effective concentration, when defined relative to the system's own operational range (from $y_{\\min}$ to $y_{\\max}$), is identically equal to the parameter $K$, independent of both the leakiness $\\beta$ and the Hill coefficient $n$. This is a fundamental property of the Hill equation structure.

We can express this difference as an integral over the parameter $c$. Let $y(u, \\xi) = \\frac{\\xi u^n}{1 + \\xi u^n}$. The integrand is $y(u, c) - y(u, 1)$.

Under this condition:\n$$\n\\kappa_2 N_2^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2} \\implies N_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa_2} \\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}\n$$\nSimilarly, from the second equation, we solve for $N_1^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{g_2}{d} = 1+(\\kappa_1 N_1^{\\ast})^{n_1} \\implies (\\kappa_1 N_1^{\\ast})^{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{d} - 1 = \\frac{g_2-d}{d}\n$$\nThe existence condition is $g_2 > d$. Under this condition:\n$$\n\\kappa_1 N_1^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1} \\implies N_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa_1} \\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}\n$$\nThus, the coexistence equilibrium exists if and only if $g_1 > d$ and $g_2 > d$. The explicit expressions are:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\delta_1 K_1}{\\alpha_1} \\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\delta_2 K_2}{\\alpha_2} \\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}\n$$\n\nThe third task is to analyze the local stability of this coexistence equilibrium. We compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the reduced system, evaluated at $(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})$. Let the system be $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = f_1(N_1, N_2)$ and $\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = f_2(N_1, N_2)$.\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial N_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial N_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial N_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial N_2} \\end{pmatrix}_{(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})}\n$$\nThe diagonal elements are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial N_1} = \\frac{g_1}{1+(\\kappa_2 N_2)^{n_2}} - d\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial N_2} = \\frac{g_2}{1+(\\kappa_1 N_1)^{n_1}} - d\n$$\nAt the equilibrium $(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})$, both of these expressions are zero by definition of the equilibrium. So, $J_{11} = 0$ and $J_{22} = 0$.\n\nThe off-diagonal elements are:\n$$\nJ_{12} = \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial N_2} = N_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_2} \\left[ \\frac{g_1}{1+(\\kappa_2 N_2)^{n_2}} \\right] = N_1 \\left[ \\frac{-g_1 n_2 (\\kappa_2 N_2)^{n_2-1} \\kappa_2}{(1+(\\kappa_2 N_2)^{n_2})^2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nJ_{21} = \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial N_1} = N_2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_1} \\left[ \\frac{g_2}{1+(\\kappa_1 N_1)^{n_1}} \\right] = N_2 \\left[ \\frac{-g_2 n_1 (\\kappa_1 N_1)^{n_1-1} \\kappa_1}{(1+(\\kappa_1 N_1)^{n_1})^2} \\right]\n$$\nThe Hill-type inhibition terms are monotonically decreasing functions of their argument. Since all parameters and variables at the coexistence equilibrium ($n_1, n_2, \\kappa_1, \\kappa_2, g_1, g_2, N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast}$) are positive, it is clear that $J_{12} < 0$ and $J_{21} < 0$. This reflects the mutual inhibition between the two strains.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix at the coexistence equilibrium is therefore:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & J_{12}^{\\ast} \\\\ J_{21}^{\\ast} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\text{ with } J_{12}^{\\ast} < 0 \\text{ and } J_{21}^{\\ast} < 0\n$$\nThe local stability is determined by the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J^{\\ast}$, found from the characteristic equation $\\det(J^{\\ast} - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix} -\\lambda & J_{12}^{\\ast} \\\\ J_{21}^{\\ast} & -\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - J_{12}^{\\ast} J_{21}^{\\ast} = \\lambda^2 - J_{12}^{\\ast} J_{21}^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nThis gives $\\lambda^2 = J_{12}^{\\ast} J_{21}^{\\ast}$. Since $J_{12}^{\\ast} < 0$ and $J_{21}^{\\ast} < 0$, their product is positive: $J_{12}^{\\ast} J_{21}^{\\ast} > 0$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{J_{12}^{\\ast} J_{21}^{\\ast}}$.\nThe eigenvalues are real, non-zero, and have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). An equilibrium point with at least one eigenvalue having a positive real part is unstable. The presence of one positive and one negative real eigenvalue indicates that the coexistence equilibrium is a saddle point. Therefore, the coexistence equilibrium is locally unstable.\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio $R^{\\ast} \\equiv \\frac{N_1^{\\ast}}{N_2^{\\ast}}$. Using the expressions for $N_1^{\\ast}$ and $N_2^{\\ast}$ derived previously:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{N_1^{\\ast}}{N_2^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\kappa_1} \\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}}{\\frac{1}{\\kappa_2} \\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\kappa_2}{\\kappa_1} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}}{\\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}} = \\frac{\\alpha_2/(\\delta_2 K_2)}{\\alpha_1/(\\delta_1 K_1)} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}}{\\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for the ratio.\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha_2 \\delta_1 K_1}{\\alpha_1 \\delta_2 K_2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{g_2-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}}{\\left(\\frac{g_1-d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha_2 \\delta_1 K_1}{\\alpha_1 \\delta_2 K_2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{g_2 - d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_1}}{\\left(\\frac{g_1 - d}{d}\\right)^{1/n_2}}}$$", "id": "2763227"}]}
