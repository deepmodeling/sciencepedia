It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biochemical kinetics, specifically gene regulation, and is mathematically well-posed.

The variable $x(t)$ represents concentration and must be non-negative, $x \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we address the existence and uniqueness of positive steady states. A steady state, denoted $x^{\\ast}$, is a concentration that is time-invariant. By definition, this means the rate of change of concentration is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{x=x^{\\ast}} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the governing equation yields the algebraic equation for any steady state $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\beta\\,\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma\\,x^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nThis is the required algebraic equation. For a positive steady state, we seek solutions $x^{\\ast} > 0$. The equation can be rearranged to equate the production rate and the degradation rate:\n$$\n\\beta\\,\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)^{n}} = \\gamma\\,x^{\\ast}\n$$\nTo determine the number of positive solutions, we can analyze the intersection of two functions of $x$: the production rate function, $P(x) = \\beta\\,\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}}$, and the degradation rate function, $D(x) = \\gamma\\,x$. The steady states $x^{\\ast}$ are the points where $P(x^{\\ast}) = D(x^{\\ast})$.\n\nWe examine the properties of these two functions for $x > 0$.\nThe degradation function, $D(x) = \\gamma\\,x$, is a linear function starting from the origin $D(0) = 0$ with a constant positive slope, $\\gamma > 0$. It is therefore strictly monotonically increasing for all $x > 0$.\n\nThe production function, $P(x) = \\beta\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-1}$, is a Hill repression function. We analyze its monotonic properties by computing its derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\beta \\left(-1\\right) \\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{n x^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right) = - \\frac{n \\beta}{K^n} \\frac{x^{n-1}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2}\n$$\nGiven that $\\beta > 0$, $K > 0$, and $n \\ge 1$, for any $x > 0$, the term $x^{n-1}$ is positive. All other terms in the fraction are positive. Therefore, $\\frac{dP}{dx} < 0$ for all $x > 0$. This proves that the production function $P(x)$ is strictly monotonically decreasing for all positive concentrations $x$.\n\nNow, we compare the behavior of $P(x)$ and $D(x)$.\nAt $x = 0$, the degradation rate is $D(0) = 0$. The production rate is $P(0) = \\beta\\,\\frac{1}{1+0} = \\beta$. Since $\\beta > 0$, we have $P(0) > D(0)$.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, the degradation rate $D(x) \\to \\infty$. The production rate $P(x) \\to 0$ because the denominator grows without bound.\nThus, the function $P(x)$ starts at a value $\\beta$ and strictly decreases towards $0$, while the function $D(x)$ starts at $0$ and strictly increases without bound. A strictly decreasing function and a strictly increasing function can intersect at most once for $x>0$. Because $P(0) > D(0)$ and $P(x) < D(x)$ for large enough $x$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that they must intersect at least once for some $x^{\\ast} > 0$.\nCombining these two facts, there must be exactly one positive solution $x^{\\ast}$ to the equation $P(x) = D(x)$.\nTherefore, for any valid choice of parameters $(\\beta, \\gamma, K, n)$, multiple positive steady states cannot exist. The system always possesses a unique positive steady state.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value of the unique positive steady state for the specific parameters $(\\beta,\\gamma,K,n) = (50,\\,1,\\,3,\\,2)$.\nWe substitute these values into the steady-state equation:\n$$\n50 \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{x}{3}\\right)^{2}} = 1 \\cdot x\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n50 = x \\left(1 + \\frac{x^2}{9}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n50 = x + \\frac{x^3}{9}\n$$\nMultiplying by $9$ to clear the denominator, we obtain a cubic polynomial equation for the steady state $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n(x^{\\ast})^3 + 9x^{\\ast} - 450 = 0\n$$\nWe must find the unique positive root of this cubic equation. Let $f(x) = x^3 + 9x - 450$. We can estimate the root's location.\nFor $x=7$, $f(7) = 7^3 + 9(7) - 450 = 343 + 63 - 450 = -44$.\nFor $x=8$, $f(8) = 8^3 + 9(8) - 450 = 512 + 72 - 450 = 134$.\nThe root $x^{\\ast}$ lies between $7$ and $8$. A numerical method, such as Newton-Raphson, can be used to find a more precise value. Let us refine our search.\nTesting $x=7.2$: $f(7.2) = (7.2)^3 + 9(7.2) - 450 = 373.248 + 64.8 - 450 = -11.952$.\nTesting $x=7.3$: $f(7.3) = (7.3)^3 + 9(7.3) - 450 = 389.017 + 65.7 - 450 = 4.717$.\nThe root is between $7.2$ and $7.3$, and closer to $7.3$.\nLet's test $x=7.27$: $f(7.27) = (7.27)^3 + 9(7.27) - 450 \\approx 384.27 + 65.43 - 450 = -0.3$.\nLet's test $x=7.272$: $f(7.272) = (7.272)^3 + 9(7.272) - 450 \\approx 384.58 + 65.45 - 450 = 0.03$.\nThe change in sign confirms the root is between $7.27$ and $7.272$.\nAs $|f(7.272)|=0.03$ is an order of magnitude smaller than $|f(7.27)|=0.3$, the root is much closer to $7.272$.\nTo meet the requirement of four significant figures, we round our best estimate. Linear interpolation gives a value of approximately $7.2718$.

The expression becomes $\\mu = \\frac{hy}{1+y}$. Since $x^\\ast$ can take any positive value (by adjusting $k$), $y$ can also take any positive value. We want to find the maximum possible value of $\\mu$ for a given $h$. We examine the function $\\mu(y) = h(y/(1+y))$. This is a monotonically increasing function of $y$. Its supremum is reached as $y \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\sup_{y > 0} \\mu(y) = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} h \\frac{y}{1+y} = h. $$\nFor oscillations to occur, the system parameters must allow the feedback gain $\\mu$ to exceed the critical value $\\mu_{crit}$. This means the maximum possible value of $\\mu$ must be greater than or equal to $\\mu_{crit}$.\n$$ \\sup(\\mu) \\ge \\mu_{crit} \\implies h \\ge \\mu_{crit}. $$\nThe minimal Hill coefficient, $h_{min}$, for which oscillations can possibly occur is thus equal to the critical gain $\\mu_{crit}$.\nFor the minimal number of stages, $n_{min}=3$, we found $\\mu_{crit} = 8$.\nThus, the minimal Hill coefficient required is $h_{min}=8$.\n\nThe minimal integer number of stages is $n_{min}=3$, and the corresponding minimal Hill coefficient is $h_{min}=8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[3, 8]}$$", "id": "2753488"}]}
