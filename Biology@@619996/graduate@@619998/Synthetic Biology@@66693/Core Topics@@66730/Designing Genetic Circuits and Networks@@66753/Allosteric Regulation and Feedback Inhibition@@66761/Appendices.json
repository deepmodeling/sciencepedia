Two residues, denoted $X$ and $Y$, are hypothesized to form an interaction network that transmits the inhibitory signal from the allosteric site to the active site, thereby implementing feedback inhibition. To interrogate whether $X$ and $Y$ are energetically coupled in the inhibitor-bound state, you perform a double mutant cycle using alanine substitutions at $X$ and $Y$. For the purposes of this analysis, you measure the standard Gibbs free energies of inhibitor binding, denoted $\\,\\Delta G_{b}\\,$, for four protein variants at the same temperature and solution conditions: wild type ($\\mathrm{WT}$), single mutants ($X$ and $Y$), and the double mutant ($XY$).

It rests upon fundamental principles of chemical thermodynamics, specifically the concept that the Gibbs free energy is a state function. This allows for the application of a thermodynamic cycle to analyze the energetic coupling between residues in a protein, a standard and rigorous method in biophysical chemistry. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing data. We shall therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of a double mutant cycle to determine the coupling energy between two residues, $X$ and $Y$, based on their combined effect on inhibitor binding affinity. The foundation of this analysis is that the Gibbs free energy, $G$, is a state function, which means the change in free energy, $\\Delta G$, between any two states is independent of the path taken. Consequently, for any closed thermodynamic cycle, the sum of free energy changes must be zero.\n\nLet the four protein variants be denoted as $\\mathrm{WT}$ (wild type), $X$ (single mutant at position $X$), $Y$ (single mutant at position $Y$), and $XY$ (double mutant).

Definition of the double mutant cycle:\n\nThe double mutant cycle connects these four protein states via mutational transformations. We analyze the effects of these mutations on the inhibitor binding free energy. A thermodynamic cycle can be constructed as a box diagram where the corners represent the four protein variants. The edges of this cycle represent the change in inhibitor binding free energy upon a single mutation in a given background.\n\nThe two pathways from the $\\mathrm{WT}$ state to the $XY$ state are:\nPath 1: $\\mathrm{WT} \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow XY$\nPath 2: $\\mathrm{WT} \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow XY$\n\nThe edges of the cycle are defined as the change in binding free energy due to a particular mutation.\n- The effect of mutating $X$ in the wild-type background is: $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{X \\text{ on } WT} = \\Delta G_{b}^{X} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n- The effect of mutating $Y$ in the wild-type background is: $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } WT} = \\Delta G_{b}^{Y} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n- The effect of mutating $Y$ in the background of the $X$ mutant is: $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } X} = \\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{X}$.\n- The effect of mutating $X$ in the background of the $Y$ mutant is: $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{X \\text{ on } Y} = \\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{Y}$.\n\nThe cycle is closed, meaning the change in free energy in going from $\\mathrm{WT}$ to $XY$ is path-independent.\nFor Path 1: $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{\\text{Path 1}} = \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{X \\text{ on } WT} + \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } X} = (\\Delta G_{b}^{X} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) + (\\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{X}) = \\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\nFor Path 2: $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{\\text{Path 2}} = \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } WT} + \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{X \\text{ on } Y} = (\\Delta G_{b}^{Y} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) + (\\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{Y}) = \\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\nAs expected, $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{\\text{Path 1}} = \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{\\text{Path 2}}$. This confirms the thermodynamic consistency of the cycle.\n\n2. Derivation of the coupling energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY}$:\n\nThe coupling energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY}$, quantifies the non-additivity of the effects of the two mutations on inhibitor binding energy. If the two mutations were energetically independent (i.e., not coupled), the effect of making one mutation (e.g., $Y$) would be the same regardless of the background (i.e., whether the other mutation, $X$, is present or not). In this hypothetical non-coupled scenario:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } X} = \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } WT} \\quad (\\text{if uncoupled})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{X} = \\Delta G_{b}^{Y} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThe coupling energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY}$, is precisely the difference between these two terms, which quantifies the deviation from this ideal additivity. It can be defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY} = \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } X} - \\Delta(\\Delta G_{b})_{Y \\text{ on } WT}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the edges from Part 1:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY} = (\\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{X}) - (\\Delta G_{b}^{Y} - \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the final analytical expression for the coupling energy:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY} = \\Delta G_{b}^{XY} - \\Delta G_{b}^{X} - \\Delta G_{b}^{Y} + \\Delta G_{b}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThis expression is symmetric with respect to $X$ and $Y$ and represents the failure of the individual mutational effects to sum linearly. A non-zero value of $\\Delta\\Delta G_{XY}$ indicates that the residues $X$ and $Y$ are energetically coupled in the context of inhibitor binding.\n\n3.
