The model is based on established principles of gene regulation dynamics, including Hill functions for transcriptional activation and first-order kinetics for degradation. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or invalid premises. Therefore, the problem is valid, and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe solution requires two parts: first, the derivation of the steady-state concentrations, and second, a qualitative analysis of their dependence on the input and system parameters.\n\n**1. Derivation of Steady-State Expressions**\n\nThe steady states of the system, denoted as $y^{\\ast}$ and $z^{\\ast}$, are the concentrations of $y$ and $z$ at which their rates of change are zero. This is found by setting $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dz}{dt} = 0$. The steady state is defined by the condition that the production rate of each species is perfectly balanced by its degradation rate.\n\nFor the species $y$, the dynamical equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\alpha_{y}\\,\\frac{x^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x^{n_{xy}}} - \\delta_{y}\\,y\n$$\nGiven that the input $x$ is clamped at a constant value $x(t) \\equiv x_{0}$, we set the derivative to zero and solve for the steady-state concentration $y^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_{y}\\,\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}} - \\delta_{y}\\,y^{\\ast}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $y^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{y}\\,y^{\\ast} = \\alpha_{y}\\,\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}\n$$\n$$\ny^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}\\,\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the unique steady-state concentration of the intermediate regulator $y$ as a function of the input $x_{0}$ and the parameters governing its synthesis and degradation.\n\nFor the species $z$, the dynamical equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = \\alpha_{z}\\,\\left[\\frac{x^{n_{xz}}}{K_{xz}^{n_{xz}}+x^{n_{xz}}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{y^{n_{yz}}}{K_{yz}^{n_{yz}}+y^{n_{yz}}}\\right] - \\delta_{z}\\,z\n$$\nAt steady state, we have $x = x_{0}$ and $y = y^{\\ast}$. Setting the derivative to zero, we find:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_{z}\\,\\left[\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}{K_{xz}^{n_{xz}}+x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{(y^{\\ast})^{n_{yz}}}{K_{yz}^{n_{yz}}+(y^{\\ast})^{n_{yz}}}\\right] - \\delta_{z}\\,z^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $z^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{z}\\,z^{\\ast} = \\alpha_{z}\\,\\left[\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}{K_{xz}^{n_{xz}}+x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{(y^{\\ast})^{n_{yz}}}{K_{yz}^{n_{yz}}+(y^{\\ast})^{n_{yz}}}\\right]\n$$\n$$\nz^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha_{z}}{\\delta_{z}}\\,\\left[\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}{K_{xz}^{n_{xz}}+x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{(y^{\\ast})^{n_{yz}}}{K_{yz}^{n_{yz}}+(y^{\\ast})^{n_{yz}}}\\right]\n$$\nTo obtain a closed-form expression for $z^{\\ast}$ that depends only on the input $x_{0}$ and the model parameters, we must substitute the derived expression for $y^{\\ast}$ into the equation for $z^{\\ast}$. This yields the final expression:\n$$\nz^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha_{z}}{\\delta_{z}}\\,\\left(\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}{K_{xz}^{n_{xz}}+x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}\\right)\\left[ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}\\right)^{n_{yz}}}{K_{yz}^{n_{yz}}+\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}\\right)^{n_{yz}}} \\right]\n$$\n\n**2. Qualitative Analysis of Steady-State Dependence**\n\nThe qualitative behavior of the steady states is dictated by the mathematical properties of the Hill function, $H(c; K, n) = \\frac{c^{n}}{K^{n}+c^{n}}$, which is a central component of the model.\n\n**Dependence on input $x_{0}$ (Monotonicity):**\nA fundamental property of the activating Hill function $H(c; K, n)$ is that it is a monotonically increasing function of its argument $c$ for all positive parameters $K$ and $n \\ge 1$. It describes a sigmoidal saturation from $0$ to $1$.\nThe steady-state expression for $y^{\\ast}$ is proportional to a Hill function of $x_{0}$: $y^{\\ast}(x_0) = \\frac{\\alpha_y}{\\delta_y} H(x_0; K_{xy}, n_{xy})$. Because $H$ is a monotonically increasing function of $x_0$, $y^{\\ast}$ is also a monotonically increasing function of $x_0$.\nThe steady-state expression for $z^{\\ast}$ is proportional to a product of two terms that both depend on $x_0$: $z^{\\ast}(x_0) = \\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} H(x_0; K_{xz}, n_{xz}) H(y^{\\ast}(x_0); K_{yz}, n_{yz})$. The first term, $H(x_0; K_{xz}, n_{xz})$, is monotonically increasing in $x_0$. The second term, $H(y^{\\ast}(x_0); K_{yz}, n_{yz})$, is a composition of two monotonically increasing functionsâ€”$H(y;...)$ with respect to $y$, and $y^{\\ast}(x_0)$ with respect to $x_0$. A composition of increasing functions is itself increasing. Thus, the second term is also monotonically increasing with $x_0$. As the product of two positive, monotonically increasing functions, $z^{\\ast}$ is therefore a monotonically increasing function of the input $x_0$.\n\n**Dependence on Hill Coefficients $n_{xy}$, $n_{xz}$, $n_{yz}$ (Ultrasensitivity):**\nThe Hill coefficient, $n$, quantifies the degree of cooperativity in transcription factor binding, which manifests as the steepness, or \"ultrasensitivity,\" of the transcriptional response. A higher value of $n$ yields a more switch-like transition from a low to a high expression level as the activator concentration crosses the activation threshold $K$.\n- For $y^{\\ast}$, the Hill coefficient $n_{xy}$ determines the ultrasensitivity of its response to $x_{0}$. A large $n_{xy}$ implies that a small change in $x_{0}$ centered around the threshold $K_{xy}$ induces a sharp, switch-like change in the concentration of $y^{\\ast}$.\n- For $z^{\\ast}$, the response to $x_{0}$ is influenced by all three Hill coefficients. The multiplicative, or AND-gate, nature of the activation of $z$ means that high expression of $z$ requires BOTH the direct activation from $x$ and the indirect activation via $y$ to be substantial. The sharpness of activation is determined by the coefficients: $n_{xz}$ for the direct path $x \\to z$, $n_{yz}$ for the path $y \\to z$, and $n_{xy}$ for the path $x \\to y$. An increase in any of these coefficients enhances the steepness of the corresponding regulatory step. Consequently, the overall response of $z^{\\ast}$ to changes in $x_{0}$ can exhibit very high ultrasensitivity, particularly when the system parameters are such that the cascaded switch-like behaviors compound.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}\\,\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}  \\frac{\\alpha_{z}}{\\delta_{z}}\\,\\left(\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}{K_{xz}^{n_{xz}}+x_{0}^{n_{xz}}}\\right)\\left[ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}\\right)^{n_{yz}}}{K_{yz}^{n_{yz}}+\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}\\frac{x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}{K_{xy}^{n_{xy}}+x_{0}^{n_{xy}}}\\right)^{n_{yz}}} \\right]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2722231"}, {"introduction": "Beyond equilibrium, the true power of network motifs lies in their dynamic functions.

In the NFL, the step produces a new steady state of $z$ higher than baseline without exact adaptation; $Y$ knockdown increases this steady-state level and slows the response. Therefore, apply the step in $X$ with and without $Y$ knockdown: if only the non-knockdown condition shows near-adaptation and the knockdown abolishes it, the circuit is an I-FFL; if neither condition adapts, the circuit is an NFL.\n\nB. Both I-FFL and NFL exhibit perfect adaptation of $z$ back to baseline after the step because both contain a repressor; $Y$ knockdown will induce sustained oscillations only in the NFL, providing a diagnostic signature.\n\nC. In the I-FFL, the steady-state $z$ increases monotonically with $x$ for any Hill functions, so adaptation cannot occur; in the NFL, negative feedback ensures exact adaptation to the pre-step level provided stability; $Y$ knockdown reduces the peak amplitude of $z$ in both motifs, enabling discrimination by peak sizes.\n\nD.

The inducer concentration is now $x_1$. The rate of change of $Z$ is $\\frac{dz}{dt}|_{t=0^+} = \\alpha_z a_X(x_1) r_Y(y_0) - \\delta_z z_0$. From the pre-step steady state, we have $\\delta_z z_0 = \\alpha_z a_X(x_0) r_Y(y_0)$. Substituting this gives $\\frac{dz}{dt}|_{t=0^+} = \\alpha_z r_Y(y_0) [a_X(x_1) - a_X(x_0)]$. Since $x_1  x_0$ and $a_X(\\cdot)$ is an increasing function, $a_X(x_1)  a_X(x_0)$, which implies $\\frac{dz}{dt}|_{t=0^+}  0$. Thus, $z(t)$ begins to increase immediately.\n\n- **Intermediate and Long-Term Response:** The variable $Y$ begins to accumulate towards its new, higher steady state $y_1 = (\\alpha_y/\\delta_y) a_X(x_1)$, with a characteristic time $\\tau_y = 1/\\delta_y$. As $y(t)$ increases, the repression function $r_Y(y(t))$ decreases, reducing the synthesis rate of $Z$. The problem states a time-scale separation $\\delta_z  \\delta_y$, meaning $Z$ dynamics ($\\tau_z = 1/\\delta_z$) are faster than $Y$ dynamics ($\\tau_y = 1/\\delta_y$). This separation of timescales is crucial: $Z$ responds quickly to the activation by $X$, causing an initial rise. Subsequently, the slowly accumulating $Y$ begins to repress $Z$, causing $z(t)$ to decrease. This combination of fast activation and delayed repression generates a pulse in $z(t)$. The output $z(t)$ rises to a peak and then falls to a new steady state, $z_1$.\n\n- **Steady-State Behavior:** The new steady state for $Z$ is $z_1 = \\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} a_X(x_1) r_Y\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_y}{\\delta_y} a_X(x_1)\\right)$. The steady-state output $z_{ss}(x)$ is a product of an increasing function of $x$ (via $a_X(x)$) and a decreasing function of $x$ (via $r_Y(\\cdot)$ and $a_X(x)$). This means $z_{ss}(x)$ is not necessarily monotonic. For pulse generation, parameters are typically such that the new steady state $z_1$ is close to the old one $z_0$, a phenomenon known as approximate adaptation.\n\n- **Effect of $Y$ Knockdown ($\\alpha_y \\to s \\alpha_y$ for $s \\in (0,1)$):** The production of $Y$ is reduced.\n    - The new steady state for $Y$ is $y_1^{(s)} = s (\\alpha_y/\\delta_y) a_X(x_1)$, which is lower than the non-knockdown value.\n    - The new steady state for $Z$ is $z_1^{(s)} = \\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} a_X(x_1) r_Y(y_1^{(s)})$. Since $y_1^{(s)}  y_1$ and $r_Y(\\cdot)$ is decreasing, $r_Y(y_1^{(s)})  r_Y(y_1)$. Therefore, $z_1^{(s)}  z_1$. The knockdown increases the steady-state level of $Z$.\n    - Dynamically, the repressive arm of the I-FFL is weakened. The delayed repression is less effective, which prevents the concentration $z(t)$ from falling after its initial rise. The pulse behavior is diminished or completely abolished, resulting in a sustained high level of $z(t)$.\n\n**2. Negative Feedback Loop (NFL) Analysis**\n\nThe dynamics are given by:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt}=\\beta_y\\,a_Z(z)-\\delta_y\\,y $$\n$$ \\frac{dz}{dt}=\\alpha_z\\,a_X(x)\\,r_Y(y)-\\delta_z\\,z $$\n\n- **Response to Step Input:** Similar to the I-FFL, $z(t)$ rises initially because $\\frac{dz}{dt}|_{t=0^+}  0$. As $z(t)$ increases, it activates the production of $Y$. The subsequent accumulation of $Y$ represses $Z$, creating a negative feedback loop ($Z \\to Y \\dashv Z$). This feedback counteracts the initial rise in $Z$.\n\n- **Steady-State Behavior:** The new steady state $(y_1, z_1)$ is given by the solution to $z_1 = \\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} a_X(x_1) r_Y\\left(\\frac{\\beta_y}{\\delta_y} a_Z(z_1)\\right)$. The right-hand side is a decreasing function of $z_1$ but an increasing function of the input $x_1$. An increase in $x_1$ shifts this curve upward, resulting in a new intersection with the line $g(z)=z$ at a higher value of $z_1$. Thus, $z_1  z_0$. This type of proportional negative feedback does not produce perfect or approximate adaptation, a fact also provided in the problem statement. The system settles to a new, higher steady state.\n\n- **Effect of $Y$ Knockdown ($\\beta_y \\to s \\beta_y$ for $s \\in (0,1)$):** The knockdown weakens the negative feedback loop because $Y$ is produced less effectively in response to $Z$.\n    - The new steady state $z_1^{(s)}$ is given by $z_1^{(s)} = \\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} a_X(x_1) r_Y\\left(s \\frac{\\beta_y}{\\delta_y} a_Z(z_1^{(s)})\\right)$. As $s$ decreases, the argument of $r_Y$ decreases, so $r_Y$ increases. This leads to a higher steady-state value for $Z$, so $z_1^{(s)}  z_1$.\n    - Dynamically, weakening the negative feedback reduces its braking effect on the rise of $Z$. A standard analysis of such feedback systems shows that reducing the loop gain typically makes the system respond *faster* (i.e., decreases the settling time or rise time).\n\n**Distinguishing Experiment**\n\nThe essential difference is that the I-FFL, under appropriate parameterization, exhibits a pulse-like response with approximate adaptation, while the NFL does not adapt. Further, this adaptive behavior of the I-FFL is critically dependent on the strength of the repressive path through $Y$. Knocking down $Y$ should therefore abolish this adaptation. In the NFL, knockdown also changes the response (e.g., higher steady state), but it does not introduce or abolish adaptation, as the circuit does not adapt in the first place. This provides a clear experimental signature.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. In the I-FFL, the step $x_0\\to x_1$ produces a fast transient increase in $z(t)$ followed by a return close to the pre-step level (approximate adaptation) because $Y$ accumulates and represses $Z$; $Y$ knockdown ($s1$) abolishes adaptation and yields a sustained elevated $z$ steady state. In the NFL, the step produces a new steady state of $z$ higher than baseline without exact adaptation; $Y$ knockdown increases this steady-state level and slows the response. Therefore, apply the step in $X$ with and without $Y$ knockdown: if only the non-knockdown condition shows near-adaptation and the knockdown abolishes it, the circuit is an I-FFL; if neither condition adapts, the circuit is an NFL.**\n\nThis option correctly describes the pulse/adaptive behavior of the I-FFL and its abolishment by $Y$ knockdown. It correctly states that the NFL does not adapt and that its steady state increases upon knockdown. The proposed experiment leverages this key difference and is a valid strategy for distinguishing the motifs. There is one inaccuracy: the claim that $Y$ knockdown \"slows the response\" of the NFL. My analysis indicates the response should become faster. However, compared to the other options, this is a minor error in a secondary detail. The primary logic concerning adaptation is sound. Given the instruction to choose the *best* option, this one is the strongest candidate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Both I-FFL and NFL exhibit perfect adaptation of $z$ back to baseline after the step because both contain a repressor; $Y$ knockdown will induce sustained oscillations only in the NFL, providing a diagnostic signature.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. First, the NFL model presented does not exhibit adaptation, perfect or approximate. Its steady-state output increases with the input. Second, the I-FFL typically shows approximate, not perfect, adaptation. Third, weakening a negative feedback loop (via knockdown) makes it *less* prone to oscillations, not more. Sustained oscillations would require strong feedback and sufficient delay, and knockdown moves the system in the opposite direction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In the I-FFL, the steady-state $z$ increases monotonically with $x$ for any Hill functions, so adaptation cannot occur; in the NFL, negative feedback ensures exact adaptation to the pre-step level provided stability; $Y$ knockdown reduces the peak amplitude of $z$ in both motifs, enabling discrimination by peak sizes.**\n\nThis option contains multiple errors. The steady-state response $z_{ss}(x)$ of the I-FFL is generally non-monotonic, which is the very reason it can exhibit adaptive behavior where $z_{ss}(x_1) \\approx z_{ss}(x_0)$. The claim that the NFL ensures exact adaptation is also false; this requires integral control, which is not present. Finally, the knockdown of $Y$ weakens repression/negative feedback, which should lead to *higher* output levels, not reduced peak amplitude.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The I-FFL and NFL are indistinguishable by step responses in $z(t)$ because both can produce pulses or monotonic responses depending on parameters; only frequency-response measurements can separate them; $Y$ knockdown does not affect the I-FFL steady state of $z$ if $x_1  x_0$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While parameter tuning can alter the responses, the fundamental difference in adaptive capability provides a clear basis for distinction using step responses, especially when combined with a knockdown experiment as proposed in A. The claim that frequency response is the *only* method is an overstatement. Most egregiously, the claim that $Y$ knockdown does not affect the I-FFL steady state is demonstrably false; weakening the repressor path must increase the steady-state output $Z$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A provides the most accurate description of the circuit behaviors and proposes a logically sound experimental design for their discrimination, despite a minor inaccuracy regarding the NFL response speed. It is unequivocally the best choice among the given options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2722223"}]}
