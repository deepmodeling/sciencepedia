By Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange form of the remainder, for any $u$ in the specified interval, there exists a number $c$ between $u_0$ and $u$ such that the error is given by:\n$$g(u) - L(u) = \\frac{g''(c)}{2!}(u-u_0)^2$$\nThe worst-case absolute error, $E_{\\max}$, over the interval $u \\in [u_0-\\Delta, u_0+\\Delta]$ is therefore bounded by:\n$$E_{\\max} = \\max_{u \\in [u_0-\\Delta, u_0+\\Delta]} \\left| \\frac{g''(c)}{2}(u-u_0)^2 \\right|$$\nSince $c$ is also in the interval $[u_0-\\Delta, u_0+\\Delta]$, the bound can be expressed as:\n$$E_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\max_{u \\in [u_0-\\Delta, u_0+\\Delta]} (u-u_0)^2\\right) \\left(\\max_{c \\in [u_0-\\Delta, u_0+\\Delta]} |g''(c)|\\right)$$\nThe first term is simply $\\Delta^2$.

The corresponding half-time is:\n$$t_{1/2,m} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{d_m + \\mu}$$\nFor a protein species in any stage, the active degradation rate is $d_p$, so its total removal rate is $\\delta_p = d_p + \\mu$. The corresponding half-time is:\n$$t_{1/2,p} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{d_p + \\mu}$$\n\nThe total delay $T(\\mu)$ is approximated by the sum of these half-times for all species across all three stages.\n$$T(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (t_{1/2,m} + t_{1/2,p})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the half-times:\n$$T(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(2)}{d_m + \\mu} + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{d_p + \\mu} \\right)$$\nThis confirms the expression for $T(\\mu)$ provided in the problem statement. As the terms are identical for each stage, this simplifies to:\n$$T(\\mu) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{d_m + \\mu} + \\frac{1}{d_p + \\mu} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the robustness metric $\\rho$. The nominal parameters are given as $d_{m}=0.10\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $d_{p}=0.03\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, and $\\mu_{0}=0.020\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The metric $\\rho$ is defined as:\n$$ \\rho \\equiv \\max_{\\alpha \\in \\{0.8,\\,1.2\\}} \\frac{\\left|T(\\alpha\\,\\mu_{0})-T(\\mu_{0})\\right|}{T(\\mu_{0})} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the delay at the nominal growth rate $T(\\mu_0)$:\n$$T(\\mu_{0}) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.10 + 0.020} + \\frac{1}{0.03 + 0.020} \\right) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.12} + \\frac{1}{0.05} \\right)$$\n$$T(\\mu_{0}) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{25}{3} + 20 \\right) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{85}{3} \\right) = 85\\ln(2)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the delay for a $20\\%$ decrease in growth rate, where $\\alpha=0.8$. The growth rate is $\\mu_1 = 0.8 \\times \\mu_0 = 0.8 \\times 0.020 = 0.016\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$T(\\mu_{1}) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.10 + 0.016} + \\frac{1}{0.03 + 0.016} \\right) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.116} + \\frac{1}{0.046} \\right)$$\nThe relative change is:\n$$\\frac{|T(\\mu_1)-T(\\mu_0)|}{T(\\mu_0)} = \\frac{\\left| 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.116} + \\frac{1}{0.046} \\right) - 85\\ln(2) \\right|}{85\\ln(2)} = \\left| \\frac{3}{85} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.116} + \\frac{1}{0.046} \\right) - 1 \\right|$$\n$$\\left| \\frac{3}{85} (8.620689\\dots + 21.739130\\dots) - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\frac{3}{85}(30.359819\\dots) - 1 \\right| = |1.071523\\dots - 1| = 0.071523\\dots$$\n\nThen, we calculate the delay for a $20\\%$ increase in growth rate, where $\\alpha=1.2$. The growth rate is $\\mu_2 = 1.2 \\times \\mu_0 = 1.2 \\times 0.020 = 0.024\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$T(\\mu_{2}) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.10 + 0.024} + \\frac{1}{0.03 + 0.024} \\right) = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.124} + \\frac{1}{0.054} \\right)$$\nThe relative change is:\n$$\\frac{|T(\\mu_2)-T(\\mu_0)|}{T(\\mu_0)} = \\left| \\frac{3}{85} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.124} + \\frac{1}{0.054} \\right) - 1 \\right|$$\n$$\\left| \\frac{3}{85} (8.064516\\dots + 18.518518\\dots) - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\frac{3}{85}(26.583034\\dots) - 1 \\right| = |0.938224\\dots - 1| = 0.061775\\dots$$\n\nThe robustness metric $\\rho$ is the maximum of these two values:\n$$\\rho = \\max(0.071523\\dots, 0.061775\\dots) = 0.071523\\dots$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $0.0715$.\n\n**Task 2: Parameter Tuning for Robustness**\n\nThe task is to identify biochemical parameters that can be adjusted to make the designed delay $T(\\mu)$ robust against variations in the growth rate $\\mu$. In the context of this model, the parameters that can be biochemically engineered are the active degradation rates, $d_m$ for mRNA and $d_p$ for protein. The number of stages, $N$, could also be considered an adjustable parameter, but the problem fixes it at $N=3$.\n\nA robust delay is one that is insensitive to changes in $\\mu$. Mathematically, this corresponds to minimizing the magnitude of the sensitivity of $T(\\mu)$ with respect to $\\mu$. The robustness metric $\\rho$ is a discrete measure of this sensitivity. To reduce $\\rho$, we must reduce the dependence of $T(\\mu)$ on $\\mu$. Let us examine the derivative of $T(\\mu)$:\n$$\\frac{dT}{d\\mu} = \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left[ 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{d_m + \\mu} + \\frac{1}{d_p + \\mu} \\right) \\right] = -3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{(d_m + \\mu)^2} + \\frac{1}{(d_p + \\mu)^2} \\right)$$\nThe magnitude of this sensitivity is:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dT}{d\\mu} \\right| = 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{(d_m + \\mu)^2} + \\frac{1}{(d_p + \\mu)^2} \\right)$$\nTo minimize this sensitivity for a given $\\mu$, the denominators $(d_m + \\mu)^2$ and $(d_p + \\mu)^2$ must be maximized. This is achieved by **increasing** the active degradation rates $d_m$ and $d_p$.\n\nWhen $d_m \\gg \\mu$ and $d_p \\gg \\mu$, the growth-mediated dilution term $\\mu$ becomes a negligible component of the total removal rates $\\delta_m$ and $\\delta_p$. In this limit, the delay function approaches a constant value independent of $\\mu$:\n$$T(\\mu) \\approx 3\\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{1}{d_m} + \\frac{1}{d_p} \\right)$$\nUnder these conditions, the circuit is said to be \"insulated\" from growth-rate fluctuations, and the delay becomes robust. Therefore, to minimize $\\rho$, one must increase the values of $d_m$ and $d_p$. The directionality is unambiguous: increasing the active degradation rates improves the robustness of the designed delay. This strategy, however, comes at a cost. Increasing $d_m$ and $d_p$ will also reduce the absolute value of the delay time. To achieve a specific target delay value while simultaneously ensuring robustness, one would need to compensate by adjusting another parameter, such as increasing the number of stages $N$ in the cascade.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0715}$$", "id": "2784955"}]}
