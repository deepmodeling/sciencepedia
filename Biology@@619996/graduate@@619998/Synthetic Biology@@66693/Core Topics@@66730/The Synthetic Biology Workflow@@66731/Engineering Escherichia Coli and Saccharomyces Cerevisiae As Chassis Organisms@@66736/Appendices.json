{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The efficiency of translating a gene into a protein is not solely determined by its amino acid sequence but is also highly dependent on the host organism's cellular machinery. This practice delves into the concept of \"codon usage bias,\" where different organisms show preferences for certain codons over others that code for the same amino acid. By implementing a kinetic model based on hypothetical codon availability weights, you will quantify how these preferences can create translational bottlenecks and affect the overall protein yield, a foundational skill for rationally designing genes for heterologous expression in chassis like E. coli and S. cerevisiae [@problem_id:2732911].", "problem": "You are given a formalized kinetic model for translation elongation to compare expected translation efficiencies of a single coding DNA sequence in two host organisms: Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology and posits that the average per-codon decoding time in a host is inversely proportional to the availability of the corresponding transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), which is here proxied by host-specific codon availability weights. Formally, for a host $h$, a codon $c$, and an arbitrary host-dependent proportionality constant $k_h > 0$, the decoding time is $t_{c,h} = 1/(k_h f_{c,h})$ where $f_{c,h} > 0$ is the given relative availability weight for codon $c$ in host $h$. For a coding sequence comprising codons $\\{c_1, \\dots, c_L\\}$, the total elongation time is $T_h = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} t_{c_i,h}$. To eliminate unknown host-dependent scale factors and the effect of sequence length, you must compute the normalized relative translation efficiency in host $h$ defined as\n$$\nE_h \\equiv \\frac{T_{h,\\mathrm{opt}}}{T_h} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{f_{c_i,h}}},\n$$\nwhere $a_i$ is the amino acid specified at position $i$, and $f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}$ is the maximum $f_{c,h}$ among the synonymous codons for amino acid $a_i$ in host $h$. This normalization corresponds to the ratio of the optimal time (using, at each position, the best synonymous codon in host $h$) to the actual time of the given sequence. Additionally, define translation bottlenecks in host $h$ as the set of codon positions achieving the maximum per-codon time $t_{c_i,h}$ along the sequence; that is, positions $i$ such that $\\frac{1}{f_{c_i,h}}$ is maximized.\n\nInput data for this task are fully specified below and must be embedded directly in your program. The sequence alphabet is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with standard uppercase bases, and reading frames are in-frame from the first nucleotide. All frequencies $f_{c,h}$ are strictly positive real numbers.\n\nYou must implement the above model and compute, for each test case: the pair $(E_{\\mathrm{Ec}}, E_{\\mathrm{Sc}})$, the cross-host ratio $R = E_{\\mathrm{Ec}}/E_{\\mathrm{Sc}}$, and the bottleneck position lists for both hosts as $1$-based indices. All floating-point outputs must be rounded to $6$ decimal places.

The problem is to be validated before any solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Model for per-codon decoding time:** For a host $h$ and codon $c$, the decoding time is $t_{c,h} = 1/(k_h f_{c,h})$, where $k_h > 0$ is a host-specific proportionality constant and $f_{c,h} > 0$ is the codon's relative availability weight in that host.\n- **Total elongation time:** For a sequence of $L$ codons $\\{c_1, \\dots, c_L\\}$, the total time is $T_h = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} t_{c_i,h}$.\n- **Normalized relative translation efficiency:**\n$$E_h = \\frac{T_{h,\\mathrm{opt}}}{T_h} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{f_{c_i,h}}}$$\nHere, $a_i$ is the amino acid at position $i$, and $f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}$ is the maximum availability weight among all synonymous codons for amino acid $a_i$ in host $h$.\n- **Translation bottlenecks:** The set of $1$-based codon positions $i$ where the decoding time $t_{c_i,h}$ (or equivalently, the value $1/f_{c_i,h}$) is maximized for the sequence in host $h$.\n- **Cross-host ratio:** $R = E_{\\mathrm{Ec}}/E_{\\mathrm{Sc}}$.\n- **Amino Acid to Codon Mapping:**\n  - Lysine (K): {AAA, AAG}\n  - Glycine (G): {GGT, GGC, GGA, GGG}\n  - Proline (P): {CCT, CCC, CCA, CCG}\n  - Aspartic Acid (D): {GAT, GAC}\n- **Host-specific Codon Availability Weights ($f_{c,h}$):**\n  - **E. coli (Ec):** AAA: $0.7$, AAG: $0.3$; GGT: $0.35$, GGC: $0.4$, GGA: $0.1$, GGG: $0.15$; CCT: $0.3$, CCC: $0.18$, CCA: $0.22$, CCG: $0.3$; GAT: $0.65$, GAC: $0.35$.\n  - **S. cerevisiae (Sc):** AAA: $0.3$, AAG: $0.7$; GGT: $0.4$, GGC: $0.2$, GGA: $0.25$, GGG: $0.15$; CCT: $0.2$, CCC: $0.15$, CCA: $0.5$, CCG: $0.15$; GAT: $0.45$, GAC: $0.55$.\n- **Test Cases (DNA sequences):**\n  1. \"AAAGGAGGTGGCCCGCCACCCCCTGATGACAAG\"\n  2. \"AAA\" repeated $10$ times.\n  3. \"AAAGGCCCGGATAAAGGCCCGGAT\"\n- **Output Specifications:** For each test case, compute the tuple $(E_{\\mathrm{Ec}}, E_{\\mathrm{Sc}})$, the ratio $R$, and the lists of bottleneck positions for each host.

The model is grounded in molecular biology principles.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. All necessary data (sequences, weights, mappings) and definitions (formulas for $E_h$ and bottlenecks) are explicitly provided. The objective is clear, and a unique solution can be algorithmically determined.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem statement is written in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The data provided is sufficient and self-consistent. The set of codons in the test sequences is a subset of the codons for which weights are provided.\n- **Realism and Feasibility:** The given weights are plausible numerical values. The model, while an abstraction, is not physically impossible or scientifically implausible for its intended purpose of relative comparison.\n- **Structural Integrity:** The definitions are unambiguous. The logic is non-circular.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary components for a solution are provided. A complete, reasoned solution will be developed.\n\n**Principle-Based Design of the Solution**\n\nThe task is to implement the provided quantitative model. The core of the problem lies in the correct application of the formula for normalized relative translation efficiency, $E_h$, and the identification of translation bottlenecks.\n\nFirst, the necessary biological information must be encoded into appropriate data structures. This includes:\n1.  A mapping from each codon to its corresponding amino acid.\n2.  The host-specific availability weights, $f_{c,h}$, for each codon $c$ in each host $h \\in \\{\\mathrm{Ec}, \\mathrm{Sc}\\}$.\n\nThe formula for efficiency $E_h$ is a ratio of two sums. The denominator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{f_{c_i,h}}$, represents the sum of inverse availability weights for the codons $c_i$ actually present in the sequence. This term is proportional to the total elongation time, $T_h$. The numerator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}}$, represents the sum of inverse availability weights for an idealized optimal sequence, where for each amino acid $a_i$ in the translated protein, the most abundant (fastest to decode) synonymous codon in host $h$ is used. This term is proportional to the minimal possible elongation time, $T_{h,\\mathrm{opt}}$.\n\nThe computational procedure for a given DNA sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Sequence Parsing:** The input DNA string is parsed into a list of $L$ codons, $\\{c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_L\\}$, by taking successive non-overlapping triplets of nucleotides.\n\n2.  **Pre-computation of Optimal Weights:** For each host $h$ and each relevant amino acid $a$, we must pre-calculate the maximum availability weight, $f_{a,h}^{\\max}$. This is done by iterating through all synonymous codons for $a$ and finding the maximum of their $f_{c,h}$ values in host $h$.\n\n3.  **Per-Host Calculation:** The following steps are performed for each host, $h=\\mathrm{Ec}$ and $h=\\mathrm{Sc}$.\n    a.  **Summation for $E_h$**:\n        - Initialize two accumulators: `sum_inv_f_actual` for the denominator and `sum_inv_f_optimal` for the numerator.\n        - Initialize a list to store the per-codon time metric, $\\{1/f_{c_1,h}, 1/f_{c_2,h}, \\dots, 1/f_{c_L,h}\\}$.\n        - Iterate from $i=1$ to $L$:\n            i.  Identify the codon $c_i$ and the corresponding amino acid $a_i$.\n            ii. Retrieve the actual weight $f_{c_i,h}$ and the pre-computed optimal weight $f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}$.\n            iii. Add $1/f_{c_i,h}$ to `sum_inv_f_actual` and store it for bottleneck analysis.\n            iv. Add $1/f_{a_i,h}^{\\max}$ to `sum_inv_f_optimal`.\n    b.  **Efficiency Calculation**: Compute $E_h = \\text{sum\\_inv\\_f\\_optimal} / \\text{sum\\_inv\\_f\\_actual}$.\n    c.  **Bottleneck Identification**: Find the maximum value in the stored list of per-codon time metrics, $\\{1/f_{c_i,h}\\}$. Identify all $1$-based indices $i$ where this maximum value occurs. These indices form the bottleneck list for host $h$.\n\n4.  **Cross-Host Ratio**: After computing $E_{\\mathrm{Ec}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Sc}}$, calculate the ratio $R = E_{\\mathrm{Ec}} / E_{\\mathrm{Sc}}$.\n\n5.  **Formatting**: The results for each test case—$E_{\\mathrm{Ec}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{Sc}}$, $R$, and the two bottleneck lists—are collected and formatted according to the output specification, with floating-point numbers rounded to $6$ decimal places. This process is repeated for all provided test cases. The final output is a single string representing a list of these results.\n\nThis structured, step-by-step process ensures that all components of the problem are addressed accurately and systematically, transforming the biological model into a deterministic algorithm.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes translation efficiency and bottlenecks for DNA sequences in E. coli and S. cerevisiae.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Data Definition ---\n    # Codon to Amino Acid mapping\n    codon_to_aa = {\n        'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',  # Lysine\n        'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G',  # Glycine\n        'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',  # Proline\n        'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D',  # Aspartic Acid\n    }\n\n    # Amino Acid to Synonymous Codons mapping\n    aa_to_codons = {\n        'K': ['AAA', 'AAG'],\n        'G': ['GGT', 'GGC', 'GGA', 'GGG'],\n        'P': ['CCT', 'CCC', 'CCA', 'CCG'],\n        'D': ['GAT', 'GAC'],\n    }\n\n    # Host-specific codon availability weights (f_c,h)\n    f_weights = {\n        'Ec': {\n            'AAA': 0.7, 'AAG': 0.3,\n            'GGT': 0.35, 'GGC': 0.4, 'GGA': 0.1, 'GGG': 0.15,\n            'CCT': 0.3, 'CCC': 0.18, 'CCA': 0.22, 'CCG': 0.3,\n            'GAT': 0.65, 'GAC': 0.35,\n        },\n        'Sc': {\n            'AAA': 0.3, 'AAG': 0.7,\n            'GGT': 0.4, 'GGC': 0.2, 'GGA': 0.25, 'GGG': 0.15,\n            'CCT': 0.2, 'CCC': 0.15, 'CCA': 0.5, 'CCG': 0.15,\n            'GAT': 0.45, 'GAC': 0.55,\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Test cases\n    test_cases = [\n        \"AAAGGAGGTGGCCCGCCACCCCCTGATGACAAG\",\n        \"AAA\" * 10,\n        \"AAAGGCCCGGATAAAGGCCCGGAT\",\n    ]\n\n    # --- Pre-computation ---\n    # Pre-compute maximum availability weights (f_a,h^max) for each amino acid in each host\n    f_max_weights = {'Ec': {}, 'Sc': {}}\n    for host in ['Ec', 'Sc']:\n        for aa, codons in aa_to_codons.items():\n            max_f = max(f_weights[host][c] for c in codons)\n            f_max_weights[host][aa] = max_f\n\n    # --- Main Logic ---\n    all_results = []\n    for dna_sequence in test_cases:\n        # 1.

Substituting this condition into the equation gives the specific volumetric flux under these saturating conditions:\n$$v_i = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat},i} [E_T]_i (10\\,K_{m,i})}{K_{m,i} + 10\\,K_{m,i}} = \\frac{10\\,k_{\\text{cat},i} [E_T]_i K_{m,i}}{11\\,K_{m,i}} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},i} [E_T]_i$$\nThis volumetric flux has units of moles per liter per second. The problem requires the per-cell flux, $J_i$, in units of molecules per cell per second. To convert, we must multiply the volumetric flux by the cell volume, $V_{\\text{cell}}$, and Avogadro's constant, $N_A$:\n$$J_i = v_i \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} \\cdot N_A$$\nThe enzyme concentration $[E_T]_i$ is related to the number of active enzyme molecules per cell, $n_{i, \\text{active}}$, by:\n$$[E_T]_i = \\frac{n_{i, \\text{active}}}{N_A \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_i$ and $[E_T]_i$ into the equation for $J_i$:\n$$J_i = \\left(\\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},i} \\frac{n_{i, \\text{active}}}{N_A \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}}}\\right) \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} \\cdot N_A$$\nThe terms for cell volume $V_{\\text{cell}}$ and Avogadro's constant $N_A$ cancel, yielding a direct relationship for the per-cell flux of step $i$:\n$$J_i = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},i} n_{i, \\text{active}}$$\nThis represents the catalytic capacity of each step under the given substrate saturation. For a linear irreversible pathway, the overall steady-state flux, $J_{\\text{pathway}}$, is governed by the step with the lowest capacity, known as the rate-limiting step or bottleneck.\n$$J_{\\text{pathway}} = \\min(J_1, J_2, J_3)$$\n\nWe now compute the step capacities for each chassis.\n\n**Analysis for *Escherichia coli***\nIn this chassis, all enzymes are fully active, so $n_{i, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Ec})} = n_i^{(\\text{Ec})}$.\nThe step capacities are:\n$J_{1}^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},1} n_{1}^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\frac{10}{11} (50) (5.0 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{10}{11} (250 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{2500 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$ molecules cell$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n$J_{2}^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},2} n_{2}^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\frac{10}{11} (25) (8.0 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{10}{11} (200 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{2000 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$ molecules cell$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n$J_{3}^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},3} n_{3}^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\frac{10}{11} (100) (2.0 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{10}{11} (200 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{2000 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$ molecules cell$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nComparing these values, the minimum capacity is $\\frac{2000 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$.\nTherefore, the steady-state pathway flux in *E. coli* is:\n$$J^{(\\text{Ec})} = \\min(J_{1}^{(\\text{Ec})}, J_{2}^{(\\text{Ec})}, J_{3}^{(\\text{Ec})}) = \\frac{2000 \\times 10^{3}}{11} \\text{ molecules cell}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nThe rate-limiting steps are step $2$ and step $3$, which are co-limiting as they have identical and minimal capacities.\n\n**Analysis for *Saccharomyces cerevisiae***\nIn this chassis, enzyme $E_2$ is only partially active. The number of active $E_2$ molecules is:\n$n_{2, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Sc})} = n_{2}^{(\\text{Sc})} \\cdot f_{2}^{(\\text{Sc})} = (3.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\cdot (0.80) = 2.4 \\times 10^{3}$.\nEnzymes $E_1$ and $E_3$ are fully active: $n_{1, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Sc})} = n_{1}^{(\\text{Sc})} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}$ and $n_{3, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Sc})} = n_{3}^{(\\text{Sc})} = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}$.\n\nThe step capacities are:\n$J_{1}^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},1} n_{1, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\frac{10}{11} (50) (1.5 \\times 10^{4}) = \\frac{10}{11} (75 \\times 10^{4}) = \\frac{7500 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$ molecules cell$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n$J_{2}^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},2} n_{2, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\frac{10}{11} (25) (2.4 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{10}{11} (60 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{600 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$ molecules cell$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n$J_{3}^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\frac{10}{11} k_{\\text{cat},3} n_{3, \\text{active}}^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\frac{10}{11} (100) (5.0 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{10}{11} (500 \\times 10^{3}) = \\frac{5000 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$ molecules cell$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nComparing these values, the minimum capacity is $\\frac{600 \\times 10^{3}}{11}$.\nTherefore, the steady-state pathway flux in *S. cerevisiae* is:\n$$J^{(\\text{Sc})} = \\min(J_{1}^{(\\text{Sc})}, J_{2}^{(\\text{Sc})}, J_{3}^{(\\text{Sc})}) = \\frac{600 \\times 10^{3}}{11} \\text{ molecules cell}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nThe rate-limiting step is step $2$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe problem requests the ratio of the steady-state per-cell flux in *E. coli* to that in *S. cerevisiae*.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{J^{(\\text{Ec})}}{J^{(\\text{Sc})}} = \\frac{\\frac{2000 \\times 10^{3}}{11}}{\\frac{600 \\times 10^{3}}{11}} $$\nThe common factors of $\\frac{10^3}{11}$ cancel:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{2000}{600} = \\frac{20}{6} = \\frac{10}{3} $$\nThis is the final answer as an exact fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}$$", "id": "2732893"}, {"introduction": "A crucial decision in synthetic biology is how to introduce a genetic circuit into a chassis: on a multi-copy plasmid or as a stable integration into the chromosome.

The model of total expression as a sum of i.i.d. random variables, where the number of terms in the sum is itself a random variable, is a standard compound random variable formulation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique solution. It is stated objectively and formally. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe total protein output, $X$, is a compound random variable defined as $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{i}$, where $N$ is the random gene copy number and $Y_{i}$ are i.i.d. random variables representing protein expression from the $i$-th gene copy, with mean $\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}] = \\alpha$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}) = \\sigma^2$. We will first derive general expressions for the mean and variance of $X$.\n\nTo find the expected value of $X$, we apply the Law of Total Expectation (or the tower property):\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X|N]] $$\nFirst, we compute the inner conditional expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[X|N]$. Given a fixed copy number $N=n$, the conditional expectation is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X|N=n] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}] = n\\alpha $$\nThus, the conditional expectation as a function of the random variable $N$ is $\\mathbb{E}[X|N] = N\\alpha$.\nSubstituting this back into the Law of Total Expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[N\\alpha] = \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[N] $$\n\nTo find the variance of $X$, we apply the Law of Total Variance:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X|N)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X|N]) $$\nWe must compute the two terms on the right-hand side.\nFor the first term, we need the conditional variance $\\mathrm{Var}(X|N)$.
