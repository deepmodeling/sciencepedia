Our goal is to derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of $X$, denoted $E[X]$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the total number of independent candidate protospacer windows to consider is $N = G - n + 1$.

This implies that the probability of any given window being an off-target site is the same for all windows. Let us denote this constant probability as $p_{ot} = P(X_i=1)$. The expression for the expected value simplifies to:\n$$\nE[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{ot} = N \\cdot p_{ot} = (G-n+1) p_{ot}\n$$\nThe central part of the problem is to determine the probability $p_{ot}$.

Since the nucleotide at each position is independent, $K$ follows a binomial distribution, $K \\sim B(n, p_{mismatch})$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe objective is to compute the probability of the event where priming is triggered and the ultimate fate of the complex is dissociation, not interference. Let this event be denoted by $A$. We formalize the conditions based on the problem statement.\n\n1.  **\"Priming occurs\"**: This happens if the complex remains bound for a time of at least $\\tau_p$. The lifetime of the complex is determined by the first of two events: dissociation or interference. Thus, the complex is bound until time $T_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\min(T_{\\mathrm{off}}, T_{\\mathrm{int}})$. The condition for priming is $T_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\ge \\tau_p$, which is equivalent to the conjunction of two conditions: $T_{\\mathrm{off}} \\ge \\tau_p$ and $T_{\\mathrm{int}} \\ge \\tau_p$.\n2.  **\"No interference cleavage occurs before dissociation\"**: This is a statement about the ordering of the two stochastic events. This means that the time to dissociation is less than the time to interference: $T_{\\mathrm{off}} < T_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the event $A$ is the intersection:\n$$A = \\{ (T_{\\mathrm{off}} \\ge \\tau_p) \\cap (T_{\\mathrm{int}} \\ge \\tau_p) \\cap (T_{\\mathrm{off}} < T_{\\mathrm{int}}) \\}$$\nThe times $T_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{int}}$ are independent exponential random variables with rates $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$, respectively.

The domain can be expressed as $t_o \\in [\\tau_p, \\infty)$ and $t_i \\in (t_o, \\infty)$, noting that since $t_o \\ge \\tau_p$, the condition $t_i > t_o$ automatically ensures $t_i > \\tau_p$.\n\nThe integral is set up as follows:\n$$P(A) = \\int_{\\tau_p}^{\\infty} \\int_{t_o}^{\\infty} f(t_o, t_i) \\, dt_i \\, dt_o = \\int_{\\tau_p}^{\\infty} \\int_{t_o}^{\\infty} k_{\\mathrm{off}} k_{\\mathrm{int}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t_o - k_{\\mathrm{int}} t_i) \\, dt_i \\, dt_o$$\n\nFirst, we solve the inner integral with respect to $t_i$:\n$$ \\int_{t_o}^{\\infty} k_{\\mathrm{int}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{int}} t_i) \\, dt_i = \\left[ -\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{int}} t_i) \\right]_{t_o}^{\\infty} = 0 - (-\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{int}} t_o)) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{int}} t_o) $$\n\nNext, substitute this result into the outer integral:\n$$ P(A) = \\int_{\\tau_p}^{\\infty} k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t_o) \\, \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{int}} t_o) \\, dt_o = \\int_{\\tau_p}^{\\infty} k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) t_o) \\, dt_o $$\n\nNow, we solve this integral:\n$$ P(A) = k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\left[ \\frac{-\\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) t_o)}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\right]_{\\tau_p}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{-k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\left( \\lim_{t_o \\to \\infty} \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) t_o) - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) \\tau_p) \\right) $$\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{off}} > 0$ and $k_{\\mathrm{int}} > 0$, the limit is $0$.\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{-k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\left( 0 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) \\tau_p) \\right) $$\nThis yields the final analytic expression for the probability:\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) \\tau_p) $$\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical values for the rates $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\nFirst, we calculate the mismatch counts $M_s$ and $M_n$ from the given mismatch profile $\\{2, 7, 10, 15, 23, 28\\}$.\n- Seed region mismatches (positions $1-8$): $\\{2, 7\\}$.

Conditional on $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{f}$, the set of functional targets is fixed. The total cleavage rate is the sum of the rates of the functional targets:\n$$\\Lambda_{\\mathbf{f}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} f_i \\lambda_i$$\nAs stated, the time to the first cleavage, $T_c$, is exponentially distributed with this total rate $\\Lambda_{\\mathbf{f}}$. The probability of escape is the probability that this cleavage time is greater than $\\tau_r$. For an exponential distribution, this survival probability is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Escape} | \\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{f}) = \\mathbb{P}(T_c > \\tau_r) = \\exp(-\\Lambda_{\\mathbf{f}} \\tau_r) = \\exp\\left(-\\tau_r \\sum_{i=1}^{M} f_i \\lambda_i\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P_{\\text{escape}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{escape}} = \\sum_{f_1, \\dots, f_M} \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\tau_r \\sum_{i=1}^{M} f_i \\lambda_i\\right) \\prod_{j=1}^{M} q_j^{f_j} (1 - q_j)^{1-f_j} \\right)$$\nThe exponential of a sum can be written as a product of exponentials. We can then rearrange the products:\n$$P_{\\text{escape}} = \\sum_{f_1, \\dots, f_M} \\left( \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{M} \\exp(-f_i \\lambda_i \\tau_r)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{M} q_j^{f_j} (1 - q_j)^{1-f_j}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$P_{\\text{escape}} = \\sum_{f_1, \\dots, f_M} \\prod_{i=1}^{M} \\left( q_i^{f_i} (1-q_i)^{1-f_i} \\exp(-f_i \\lambda_i \\tau_r) \\right)$$\nThe sum of products can be factored into a product of sums:\n$$P_{\\text{escape}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{f_i=0}^{1} \\left( q_i^{f_i} (1-q_i)^{1-f_i} \\exp(-f_i \\lambda_i \\tau_r) \\right)$$\nLet us evaluate the inner sum for a single target $i$. It has two terms, for $f_i=0$ and $f_i=1$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $f_i=0$: $q_i^0 (1-q_i)^{1-0} \\exp(-0 \\cdot \\lambda_i \\tau_r) = 1-q_i$. This is the probability that the target is non-functional.\n    \\item For $f_i=1$: $q_i^1 (1-q_i)^{1-1} \\exp(-1 \\cdot \\lambda_i \\tau_r) = q_i \\exp(-\\lambda_i \\tau_r)$. This is the probability that the target is functional AND cleavage does not occur in time.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe sum is the total probability of 'escaping' target $i$: $(1-q_i) + q_i \\exp(-\\lambda_i \\tau_r)$.\nThus, the general expression for the unconditional phage escape probability with $M$ spacers, which we denote $E_M$, is:\n$$E_M = \\prod_{i=1}^{M} \\left[ (1 - q_i) + q_i \\exp(-\\lambda_i \\tau_r) \\right]$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the absolute reduction in escape probability, $\\Delta \\equiv E_{\\text{single},1} - E_{\\text{multi}}$. Here, $E_{\\text{multi}}$ corresponds to $M=3$ spacers, and $E_{\\text{single},1}$ corresponds to using only spacer $1$, which is the case $M=1$ with parameters $q_1$ and $\\lambda_1$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\tau_r = 420 \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n    \\item $(q_1, q_2, q_3) = (0.94, 0.91, 0.88)$\n    \\item $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = (0.025, 0.018, 0.012) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe escape probability for the single-spacer case ($M=1$) is:\n$$E_{\\text{single},1} = (1 - q_1) + q_1 \\exp(-\\lambda_1 \\tau_r)$$\nThe escape probability for the multi-spacer case ($M=3$) is:\n$$E_{\\text{multi}} = \\left[ (1 - q_1) + q_1 \\exp(-\\lambda_1 \\tau_r) \\right] \\left[ (1 - q_2) + q_2 \\exp(-\\lambda_2 \\tau_r) \\right] \\left[ (1 - q_3) + q_3 \\exp(-\\lambda_3 \\tau_r) \\right]$$\n\nLet us first compute the dimensionless exponents $\\lambda_i \\tau_r$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\lambda_1 \\tau_r = 0.025 \\times 420 = 10.5$\n    \\item $\\lambda_2 \\tau_r = 0.018 \\times 420 = 7.56$\n    \\item $\\lambda_3 \\tau_r = 0.012 \\times 420 = 5.04$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow, we compute the individual per-target escape probabilities:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $P_1 = (1 - 0.94) + 0.94 \\exp(-10.5) = 0.06 + 0.94 \\exp(-10.5) \\approx 0.06002578$\n    \\item $P_2 = (1 - 0.91) + 0.91 \\exp(-7.56) = 0.09 + 0.91 \\exp(-7.56) \\approx 0.09047403$\n    \\item $P_3 = (1 - 0.88) + 0.88 \\exp(-5.04) = 0.12 + 0.88 \\exp(-5.04) \\approx 0.12571191$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith these, we have $E_{\\text{single},1} = P_1$ and $E_{\\text{multi}} = P_1 P_2 P_3$.\nThe absolute reduction is $\\Delta = E_{\\text{single},1} - E_{\\text{multi}} = P_1 - P_1 P_2 P_3 = P_1(1 - P_2 P_3)$.\n$$\\Delta = (0.06002578) \\times (1 - (0.09047403) \\times (0.12571191))$$\n$$\\Delta = (0.06002578) \\times (1 - 0.01137397)$$\n$$\\Delta = (0.06002578) \\times (0.98862603)$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx 0.05934354$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we obtain $0.05934$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05934}$$", "id": "2725204"}]}
