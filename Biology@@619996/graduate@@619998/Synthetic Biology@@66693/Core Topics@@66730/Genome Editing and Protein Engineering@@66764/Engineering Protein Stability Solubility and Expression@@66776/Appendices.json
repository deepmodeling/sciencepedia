The provided physical parameters ($\\Delta H_m$, $T_m$, $\\Delta C_p$) are within a realistic range for globular proteins. The problem is well-posed, containing all necessary information and consistent constraints for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions (two-state model, constant $\\Delta C_p$) are standard and acceptable simplifications for this type of problem. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fraction of folded protein, $f_{F}$, at a specified temperature $T$. For a two-state equilibrium between the folded ($F$) and unfolded ($U$) states, $F \\rightleftharpoons U$, the equilibrium constant for unfolding is defined as $K = \\frac{[U]}{[F]}$. The total concentration of protein is $[P]_{total} = [F] + [U]$. The fraction of folded protein is therefore:\n$$f_{F} = \\frac{[F]}{[P]_{total}} = \\frac{[F]}{[F] + [U]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[F]$ yields:\n$$f_{F} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[U]}{[F]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + K}$$\nTo find $f_{F}$, we must first determine the value of the equilibrium constant $K$ at the temperature $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The equilibrium constant is related to the Gibbs free energy change of unfolding, $\\Delta G(T)$, by the relation:\n$$K = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(T)}{RT}\\right)$$\nOur central task is to calculate $\\Delta G(T)$ at $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$ using the parameters given at the melting temperature $T_{m} = 330\\,\\mathrm{K}$. We start from the fundamental definition of Gibbs free energy:\n$$\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H(T) - T\\Delta S(T)$$\nTo find the temperature dependence of $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$, we integrate the provided differential relations, assuming $\\Delta C_p$ is constant. The reference state is at the melting temperature, $T_m$.\nIntegration of $d\\Delta H/dT = \\Delta C_{p}$ from $T_m$ to $T$ gives:\n$$\\int_{\\Delta H(T_m)}^{\\Delta H(T)} d(\\Delta H) = \\int_{T_m}^{T} \\Delta C_p dT$$\n$$\\Delta H(T) - \\Delta H(T_m) = \\Delta C_p (T - T_m)$$\nLetting $\\Delta H(T_m) = \\Delta H_m$, we have the temperature-dependent enthalpy of unfolding:\n$$\\Delta H(T) = \\Delta H_m + \\Delta C_p (T - T_m)$$\nSimilarly, integration of $d\\Delta S/dT = \\Delta C_p/T$ from $T_m$ to $T$ gives:\n$$\\int_{\\Delta S(T_m)}^{\\Delta S(T)} d(\\Delta S) = \\int_{T_m}^{T} \\frac{\\Delta C_p}{T} dT$$\n$$\\Delta S(T) - \\Delta S(T_m) = \\Delta C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_m}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta S(T) = \\Delta S(T_m) + \\Delta C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_m}\\right)$$\nAt the melting temperature $T_m$, the system is at equilibrium, which means $\\Delta G(T_m) = 0$. From the definition of Gibbs free energy at this temperature:\n$$\\Delta G(T_m) = \\Delta H(T_m) - T_m \\Delta S(T_m) = 0$$\nThis implies that the entropy of unfolding at the melting temperature is $\\Delta S(T_m) = \\frac{\\Delta H(T_m)}{T_m} = \\frac{\\Delta H_m}{T_m}$.\nWe now substitute the expressions for $\\Delta H(T)$ and $\\Delta S(T)$ back into the equation for $\\Delta G(T)$:\n$$\\Delta G(T) = \\left[ \\Delta H_m + \\Delta C_p (T - T_m) \\right] - T \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta H_m}{T_m} + \\Delta C_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_m}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis equation is a form of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.

It presents a classic and fundamental question in protein biophysics: deconvolving the energetic contributions to protein stability. The system described (a monomeric, two-state folding protein) is a standard model for thermodynamic analysis. The observed stabilization ($\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) is a physically realistic magnitude for a single-site mutation. The goal is clear and objective.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It asks for a specific set of measurable signatures to distinguish between two well-defined physical mechanisms. The provided assumptions and fundamental relations are standard in physical chemistry and biophysics and are sufficient to construct a logical argument.\n\nThe problem setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The constraint that the backbone structure is unaltered is important, as it implies that the stabilization arises from local changes in side-chain interactions rather than a global structural rearrangement, which would complicate the analysis. The methods allowed (equilibrium thermodynamics) are appropriate for the question asked. The problem is not trivial; it requires a nuanced understanding of the thermodynamic signatures of different non-covalent interactions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound problem in biophysical chemistry. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe objective is to design an experiment to differentiate between stabilization due to enhanced hydrophobic packing and stabilization due to a new or strengthened hydrogen bond. We must analyze the expected thermodynamic signatures of each mechanism. Let the wild-type be denoted by $\\mathrm{WT}$ and the mutant by $\\mathrm{MUT}$. The stabilization is quantified by $\\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{MUT}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{WT}}  0$.\n\n**Mechanism 1: Improved Hydrophobic Core Packing**\n\nThis mechanism involves the increased burial of nonpolar surface area away from the solvent (water). The thermodynamics of this process are dominated by the hydrophobic effect.\n\n1.  **Heat Capacity Change ($\\Delta C_{p}$)**: The hydrophobic effect is uniquely characterized by a large, negative change in heat capacity upon transfer from water to a nonpolar environment ($\\Delta C_{p, \\text{folding}}  0$). This arises from the release of ordered water molecules that solvate nonpolar groups in the unfolded state. If the mutant improves hydrophobic packing, it buries more nonpolar surface area upon folding. Consequently, the magnitude of the heat capacity change should increase. We expect $\\Delta C_{p, \\mathrm{MUT}}  \\Delta C_{p, \\mathrm{WT}}$, which means $|\\Delta C_{p, \\mathrm{MUT}}| > |\\Delta C_{p, \\mathrm{WT}}|$. This is a primary and robust signature.\n\n2.  **Volume Change ($\\Delta V$)**: High pressure typically denatures proteins, indicating that the volume of the system (protein + solvent) is smaller in the unfolded state than the folded state. Thus, the volume change of unfolding, $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}}$, is negative. $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}} = -\\Delta V_{\\text{fold}}$. The negative $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}}$ is primarily due to two factors: (i) elimination of packing defects (voids) in the protein interior upon unfolding and (ii) electrostriction of water around newly exposed charged and polar groups. The transfer of nonpolar groups into water contributes a *positive* term to $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}}$. Therefore, enhancing the hydrophobic core packing, which increases the nonpolar surface area buried upon folding, would make the hydrophobic contribution to $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}}$ more negative. However, the dominant effect is often viewed differently: better packing in the folded state reduces internal voids, making $\\Delta V_{\\text{fold}}$ more positive relative to wild-type. Consequently, $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}} = -\\Delta V_{\\text{fold}}$ would become less negative for the mutant. Pressure-induced unfolding would be less effective.\n\n3.  **Isotope Effect ($\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$)**: The hydrophobic effect is known to be slightly stronger in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ than in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. Thus, a protein stabilized by hydrophobic interactions will be slightly more stable in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$. The mutant, with its enhanced hydrophobic packing, would be expected to show a stabilization in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$, but the *additional* stabilization ($\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{D_2O}} - \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$) should be modest and scale with the already-present hydrophobic character of the protein.\n\n**Mechanism 2: Formation or Strengthening of an Intra-protein Hydrogen Bond**\n\nThis mechanism involves replacing protein-water and/or water-water hydrogen bonds with an internal protein-protein hydrogen bond.\n\n1.  **Heat Capacity Change ($\\Delta C_{p}$)**: The formation of a single hydrogen bond does not involve a large-scale reorganization of solvent water in the same manner as the burial of a large nonpolar surface. While there are heat capacity effects associated with hydrogen bonding, they are much smaller than those associated with the hydrophobic effect. Therefore, adding or strengthening one hydrogen bond in a $150$-residue protein is expected to have a negligible effect on the overall $\\Delta C_{p}$ of folding, which is dominated by the hydrophobic burial of the protein core. We expect $\\Delta C_{p, \\mathrm{MUT}} \\approx \\Delta C_{p, \\mathrm{WT}}$.\n\n2.  **Enthalpy and Entropy Changes ($\\Delta H$, $\\Delta S$)**: The formation of a hydrogen bond is an energetically favorable process, driven by a negative enthalpy change. Thus, the stabilization $\\Delta \\Delta G$ should be primarily enthalpic, meaning $\\Delta \\Delta H = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{MUT}} - \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{WT}}  0$. At the melting temperature $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, $\\Delta G(T_{\\mathrm{m}}) = \\Delta H(T_{\\mathrm{m}}) - T_{\\mathrm{m}} \\Delta S(T_{\\mathrm{m}}) = 0$. A more negative $\\Delta H(T_{\\mathrm{m}})$ for the mutant would require a correspondingly more negative $\\Delta S(T_{\\mathrm{m}})$ to achieve $\\Delta G=0$ at the higher $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This is a classic example of enthalpy-entropy compensation. The primary signature is an enthalpically driven stabilization.\n\n3.  **Volume Change ($\\Delta V$)**: The formation of an internal hydrogen bond, replacing interactions with solvent, is not expected to significantly alter the overall molar volume of the protein or the solvent organization in a way that would produce a large change in $\\Delta V_{\\text{folding}}$. Any change would be minimal compared to effects from hydrophobic burial or electrostriction. We expect $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{MUT}} \\approx \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n\n4.  **Isotope Effect ($\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$)**: Deuterium bonds are generally stronger and more stable than hydrogen bonds. If the stabilization stems from a new hydrogen bond, substituting $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ with $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ will make that internal bond a deuterium bond, increasing its strength. This results in a significantly larger stability increase for the mutant in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ compared to the wild-type, which does not have this specific new bond. This provides a strong, direct diagnostic.\n\n5.  **pH Dependence**: If the hydrogen bond involves an ionizable group (e.g., Asp, Glu, His, Lys), the stability of the bond will depend on the protonation state of that group. The overall protein stability will then show a marked dependence on $\\mathrm{pH}$ centered around the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of the group involved. This is another powerful, albeit conditional, diagnostic.\n\n**Summary of Signatures:**\n\n| Thermodynamic Parameter | Hydrophobic Packing Mutant | Hydrogen Bond Mutant |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $\\Delta(\\Delta C_{p})$ | More negative ($|\\Delta C_{p}|\n$ increases) | Approximately zero |\n| $\\Delta(\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}})$ | Less negative | Approximately zero |\n| $\\Delta \\Delta G$ origin | Dominated by hydrophobic effect | Dominated by $\\Delta \\Delta H  0$ |\n| $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ effect | Small additional stabilization | Large additional stabilization |\n| $\\mathrm{pH}$ dependence | Unlikely to be pronounced | Pronounced, if titratable group involved |\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Perform Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ to extract $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, $\\Delta H(T)$, and $\\Delta C_{p}$ for wild-type and mutant across a broad temperature range; repeat the DSC in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$; and measure pressure-dependent unfolding at fixed $T$ to obtain $\\Delta V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta G}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T}$. Predict that a hydrophobic-packing mutant will show a more negative folding $\\Delta C_{p}$ (increased $|\\Delta C_{p}|$), a reduced magnitude of the pressure-unfolding volume change (that is, $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}}$ becomes less negative, implying weaker pressure-induced unfolding), and only a small additional stabilization in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ beyond the wild-type isotope effect. Predict that a hydrogen-bond mutant will show little or no change in $\\Delta C_{p}$ relative to wild-type but a larger increase in the unfolding enthalpy $\\Delta H$ at $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ with compensatory $\\Delta S$ change (enthalpy-driven stabilization), minimal change in $\\Delta V$, and a larger additional stabilization in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ along with pronounced $\\mathrm{pH}$ dependence if titratable donors/acceptors are involved.**\n\nThis option proposes a comprehensive suite of experiments measuring precisely the parameters identified in our derivation: $\\Delta C_{p}$, $\\Delta V$, and the $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ isotope effect. The predicted outcomes for each mechanism are in exact agreement with our theoretical analysis. The predictions for the hydrophobic mutant (more negative $\\Delta C_{p}$, less negative $\\Delta V_{\\text{unfold}}$, small isotope effect) are correct. The predictions for the hydrogen-bond mutant (unchanged $\\Delta C_{p}$, enthalpy-driven stabilization, minimal $\\Delta V$ change, large isotope effect, potential pH dependence) are also correct. This experimental design is the gold standard for addressing this question.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Measure $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ of wild-type and mutant as a function of sodium chloride concentration from $0$ to $1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and conclude that if $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ increases with ionic strength for the mutant more than wild-type, the mechanism is hydrogen bonding; if it decreases, it is hydrophobic. Use the slope $\\frac{\\partial T_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\partial I}$ as the diagnostic signature.**\n\nThis proposal is flawed. The effect of salt ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$) on protein stability is complex (a combination of Debye-Hückel screening and Hofmeister effects). Salt can stabilize proteins by strengthening the hydrophobic effect (salting-out) or by screening unfavorable electrostatic repulsions. It can destabilize them by screening favorable salt bridges or by direct binding interactions. Attributing a positive $\\frac{\\partial T_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\partial I}$ to hydrogen bonding and a negative slope to hydrophobic effects is an unsubstantiated and incorrect simplification. For instance, strengthening the hydrophobic effect via salting-out would *increase* $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, contradicting the premise of the option. This diagnostic is unreliable and not mechanistically specific.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Measure folding and unfolding rate constants of wild-type and mutant in viscous solvents (for example, add glycerol from $0$ to $30\\%$ by volume) and attribute any decrease in the unfolding activation enthalpy to hydrophobic packing whereas any increase to hydrogen bonding. Use Arrhenius analysis of rates to infer the mechanism.**\n\nThis approach is misguided. First, it investigates kinetics ($k_{\\text{fold}}, k_{\\text{unfold}}$) and the properties of the transition state, whereas the problem concerns the origin of stability in the folded ground state ($\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$), which is an equilibrium thermodynamic property. While related through $\\Delta G = -RT \\ln(k_{\\text{fold}}/k_{\\text{unfold}})$, kinetic changes do not directly report on the nature of interactions in the folded state. Second, glycerol is not merely a visco-genic agent; it is a chemical co-solvent that is preferentially excluded from the protein surface, which thermodynamically stabilizes the compact folded state. This stabilizing effect complicates any interpretation based solely on viscosity. The proposed correlation between activation enthalpy changes and the stabilization mechanism is ad-hoc and lacks a firm theoretical basis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Perform chemical denaturation with urea for wild-type and mutant at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, extract the $m$-values from $\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ} - m\\,[\\text{urea}]$, and combine with circular dichroism to monitor secondary structure. Conclude that a decrease in $m$ with increased stability indicates hydrophobic packing, whereas an unchanged $m$ indicates hydrogen bonding. Use $m$ as the diagnostic signature of mechanism.**\n\nThis method is also weak. The $m$-value is proportional to the change in solvent-accessible surface area upon unfolding ($\\Delta$ASA). A single-site mutation, whether it improves packing or adds an H-bond, is unlikely to cause a large, easily interpretable change in the global $\\Delta$ASA and thus the $m$-value. The assertion that a decrease in $m$ indicates hydrophobic packing is not a general principle. Indeed, a more compact folded state due to better packing could, in principle, lead to a larger $\\Delta$ASA if the unfolded state ensemble is unaffected, potentially increasing the $m$-value. The signal-to-noise for detecting a change in $m$ from a single mutation is low, and its interpretation is ambiguous compared to the direct thermodynamic measurements proposed in option A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that proposes a scientifically sound, direct, and comprehensive experimental plan capable of distinguishing the two stabilization mechanisms based on fundamental thermodynamic principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2734913"}, {"introduction": "Effective protein engineering seldom involves optimizing a single parameter in isolation; improving thermodynamic stability ($\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$) might come at the cost of expression level or solubility. This practice places you in the role of a computational protein designer tasked with navigating these complex trade-offs [@problem_id:2734955]. You will implement a Pareto optimization algorithm, a powerful technique used in modern synthetic biology to identify a set of 'best-compromise' solutions from a pool of candidates, each with multiple, often conflicting, predicted properties. This exercise bridges fundamental biophysical concepts with practical, multi-objective design strategies.", "problem": "You are designing single amino acid substitutions to improve protein behavior along three experimentally grounded axes: thermodynamic stability, solubility, and expression. The fundamental biological bases are: (i) the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, which links codon usage to translation efficiency; (ii) equilibrium thermodynamics of protein folding, where the folded fraction increases as the folding free energy decreases; and (iii) colloid and protein chemistry observations that electrostatic repulsion associated with larger magnitude net charge reduces aggregation propensity. You are given predicted properties for candidate single mutations, each specified by a tuple of three values: the change in folding free energy relative to wild type, the net charge at physiological pH, and the codon adaptation index. Specifically, each mutation is represented as a triple $(\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}, Q, \\text{CAI})$, where $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ is in kilocalories per mole, $Q$ is the net charge (dimensionless units of the elementary charge), and $\\text{CAI}$ is unitless in $[0,1]$. From first principles, the following objective directions are justified: lower (more negative) $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ is preferred; higher absolute net charge $|Q|$ is preferred as a solubility proxy; and higher $\\text{CAI}$ is preferred as an expression proxy. To cast all objectives into a common minimization framework for multi-objective analysis, define the objective vector for mutation $i$ as\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}^{(i)} \\equiv \\left( f_1^{(i)}, f_2^{(i)}, f_3^{(i)} \\right) = \\left( \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{(i)}, -\\left|Q^{(i)}\\right|, -\\text{CAI}^{(i)} \\right).\n$$\nUse the standard Pareto dominance relation: mutation $a$ dominates mutation $b$ (denoted $a \\prec b$) if and only if $f_k^{(a)} \\le f_k^{(b)}$ for all $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ and there exists at least one index $k$ such that $f_k^{(a)}  f_k^{(b)}$. A mutation is Pareto-optimal (on the estimated Pareto front) if it is not dominated by any other mutation in the set.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case below, identifies the indices of the Pareto-optimal mutations under the minimization of $\\left(\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}, -|Q|, -\\text{CAI}\\right)$ and returns them in ascending order. Treat equality within numerical comparisons exactly (no special tolerances): two identical objective vectors do not dominate one another, and both should be retained as Pareto-optimal.\n\nPhysical units: the values of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ are given in kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol). Your code must treat them as real numbers and does not need to convert units. There are no angles. Numerical outputs are indices only and therefore have no units.\n\nTest suite. Each test case is a list of mutations with indices starting at $0$. For each mutation, the triple is given as $(\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}, Q, \\text{CAI})$:\n- Test case $1$ (general trade-offs, mixed signs):\n    - Index $0$: $(-1.5,\\ +2,\\ 0.78)$\n    - Index $1$: $(-0.5,\\ +6,\\ 0.62)$\n    - Index $2$: $(-1.2,\\ -4,\\ 0.90)$\n    - Index $3$: $(-2.0,\\ +1,\\ 0.55)$\n    - Index $4$: $(-0.8,\\ +8,\\ 0.88)$\n    - Index $5$: $(-1.5,\\ -6,\\ 0.70)$\n    - Index $6$: $(-1.0,\\ +3,\\ 0.92)$\n- Test case $2$ (ties and near-ties):\n    - Index $0$: $(-1.0,\\ +2,\\ 0.80)$\n    - Index $1$: $(-1.0,\\ +2,\\ 0.80)$\n    - Index $2$: $(-1.1,\\ +2,\\ 0.79)$\n    - Index $3$: $(-0.9,\\ +5,\\ 0.85)$\n- Test case $3$ (boundary charge magnitude $0$ versus high magnitude, extreme $\\text{CAI}$):\n    - Index $0$: $(-0.2,\\ 0,\\ 0.99)$\n    - Index $1$: $(-1.8,\\ 0,\\ 0.50)$\n    - Index $2$: $(-1.8,\\ +10,\\ 0.50)$\n    - Index $3$: $(-0.2,\\ +10,\\ 0.99)$\n- Test case $4$ (a single dominant mutation):\n    - Index $0$: $(-1.5,\\ +7,\\ 0.95)$\n    - Index $1$: $(-1.0,\\ +5,\\ 0.90)$\n    - Index $2$: $(-0.5,\\ +3,\\ 0.85)$\n    - Index $3$: $(-1.5,\\ +7,\\ 0.90)$\n\nProgram specification and required output format:\n- Implement the dominance check exactly as defined above for three-objective minimization of $\\left(\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}, -|Q|, -\\text{CAI}\\right)$.\n- For each test case, return a list of the indices in ascending order of all mutations that are Pareto-optimal.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is a list of indices with no spaces. For example, if the Pareto fronts for three test cases are $[0,2]$, $[1]$, and $[0,3]$, then the required output is exactly the single line: \"[[0,2],[1],[0,3]]\".", "solution": "We formalize each mutation $i$ by its predicted triple $(\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{(i)}, Q^{(i)}, \\text{CAI}^{(i)})$. The derivation of the objectives is grounded in established principles: (i) the thermodynamic probability that a protein is folded at equilibrium increases as the folding free energy decreases; therefore, making $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ more negative (stabilizing) is desirable and is modeled as minimizing $f_1^{(i)} = \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{(i)}$; (ii) the tendency for colloidal proteins to aggregate is mitigated by electrostatic repulsion, which increases with the magnitude of the net charge, so higher $|Q|$ is used as a simple, interpretable solubility-promoting proxy; we convert this to a minimization by defining $f_2^{(i)} = -|Q^{(i)}|$; (iii) the Central Dogma and extensive empirical literature relate codon usage to translation elongation efficiency; higher codon adaptation index is a proxy for higher expression, which we minimize via $f_3^{(i)} = -\\text{CAI}^{(i)}$. Thus, each mutation is mapped to the three-objective vector\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}^{(i)} = \\left( \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{(i)}, -\\left|Q^{(i)}\\right|, -\\text{CAI}^{(i)} \\right).\n$$\nWe use the standard Pareto dominance for minimization: for two mutations $a$ and $b$, mutation $a$ dominates $b$ (denoted $a \\prec b$) if and only if for all objectives $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $f_k^{(a)} \\le f_k^{(b)}$ and for at least one objective $k$ we have $f_k^{(a)}  f_k^{(b)}$. A mutation is Pareto-optimal if there is no other mutation that dominates it.\n\nAlgorithmic design proceeds directly from this definition. Given a finite set of $n$ mutations in a test case, we:\n- Compute $\\mathbf{f}^{(i)}$ for each $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ by $f_1^{(i)} = \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{(i)}$, $f_2^{(i)} = -|Q^{(i)}|$, and $f_3^{(i)} = -\\text{CAI}^{(i)}$.\n- For each pair $(i,j)$ with $i \\ne j$, check dominance:\n    - $i$ dominates $j$ if $f_k^{(i)} \\le f_k^{(j)}$ for $k=1,2,3$ and at least one strict inequality holds.\n    - If any $j$ dominates $i$, then $i$ is not Pareto-optimal.\n    - If no $j$ dominates $i$, retain $i$ as Pareto-optimal.\n- Collect the indices of Pareto-optimal mutations and sort them in ascending order to produce the result for that test case.\n\nThis pairwise comparison procedure has time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for each test case, which is appropriate for the small sets provided. Equality is treated exactly: identical $\\mathbf{f}^{(i)}$ and $\\mathbf{f}^{(j)}$ do not establish dominance in either direction due to the strict inequality requirement on at least one objective, so both remain on the Pareto front.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the test suite:\n- Test case $1$: compute $\\mathbf{f}^{(i)}$ for indices $0$ through $6$. Index $1$ is dominated (for example, by index $4$ which is no worse in any objective and strictly better in all three), while indices $0$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ are not dominated by any other mutation due to different trade-offs between $f_1$, $f_2$, and $f_3$. The Pareto front indices are $[0,2,3,4,5,6]$.\n- Test case $2$: indices $0$ and $1$ are identical; index $2$ improves $f_1$ relative to $0$ and $1$ but slightly worsens $f_3$; index $3$ improves $f_2$ and $f_3$ relative to $0$ and $1$ but worsens $f_1$; no mutation dominates another. The Pareto front indices are $[0,1,2,3]$.\n- Test case $3$: index $2$ dominates index $1$ because they have equal $f_1$ and $f_3$ while index $2$ has strictly better $f_2$; index $3$ dominates index $0$ analogously. Indices $2$ and $3$ do not dominate one another due to a trade-off between $f_1$ and $f_3$. The Pareto front indices are $[2,3]$.\n- Test case $4$: index $0$ dominates all others since it is no worse in any objective and strictly better in at least one relative to each other mutation; index $3$ is strictly dominated by index $0$ through improvement in $f_3$ with equality in $f_1$ and $f_2$. The Pareto front indices are $[0]$.\n\nThe program should therefore produce a single line printing the list of these index lists with no spaces inside brackets, namely $[[0,2,3,4,5,6],[0,1,2,3],[2,3],[0]]$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef pareto_front_indices(mutations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a list of mutations, each as a tuple (ddg, Q, CAI),\n    return sorted list of indices that are Pareto-optimal under minimization of\n    (ddg, -|Q|, -CAI).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(mutations)\n    # Compute objective vectors f = (ddg, -|Q|, -CAI)\n    f = []\n    for (ddg, q, cai) in mutations:\n        f.append((ddg, -abs(q), -cai))\n    f = np.array(f, dtype=float)\n\n    pareto = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        dominated = False\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            # Check if j dominates i: all objectives = and at least one \n            if np.all(f[j] = f[i]) and np.any(f[j]  f[i]):\n                dominated = True\n                break\n        if not dominated:\n            pareto.append(i)\n    return sorted(pareto)\n\ndef format_result(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Format as a single string with no spaces inside the brackets:\n    e.g., [[0,2,3],[1],[0,3]]\n    \"\"\"\n    inner = []\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        inner.append(\"[\" + \",\".join(str(x) for x in lst) + \"]\")\n    return \"[\" + \",\".join(inner) + \"]\"\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1\n        [\n            (-1.5, +2, 0.78),\n            (-0.5, +6, 0.62),\n            (-1.2, -4, 0.90),\n            (-2.0, +1, 0.55),\n            (-0.8, +8, 0.88),\n            (-1.5, -6, 0.70),\n            (-1.0, +3, 0.92),\n        ],\n        # Test case 2\n        [\n            (-1.0, +2, 0.80),\n            (-1.0, +2, 0.80),\n            (-1.1, +2, 0.79),\n            (-0.9, +5, 0.85),\n        ],\n        # Test case 3\n        [\n            (-0.2, 0, 0.99),\n            (-1.8, 0, 0.50),\n            (-1.8, +10, 0.50),\n            (-0.2, +10, 0.99),\n        ],\n        # Test case 4\n        [\n            (-1.5, +7, 0.95),\n            (-1.0, +5, 0.90),\n            (-0.5, +3, 0.85),\n            (-1.5, +7, 0.90),\n        ],\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for mutations in test_cases:\n        result = pareto_front_indices(mutations)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format (no spaces inside).\n    print(format_result(results))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2734955"}]}
