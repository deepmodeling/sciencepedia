In steady-state exponential growth, the fraction of time that the promoter is occupied by the dCas9–sgRNA complex can be approximated by the equilibrium fractional occupancy of the binding site by the complex. Assume one-to-one binding between the dCas9–sgRNA complex and the target site, negligible sequestration by off-target sites, and that time-averaged occupancy equals equilibrium occupancy.\n\nYou perform a Western blot with a purified dCas9 standard, obtaining a linear calibration between band intensity and mass of dCas9: intensity $I$ (arbitrary units) equals slope $\\beta$ times mass $m$ (in ng), that is $I = \\beta\\, m$.

Decreasing $K_D$ by a factor of $10$ shifts the dose-response curve leftward by a factor of $10$ on the $u$ axis (lower $u$ needed for the same response) without changing the maximal repression depth, provided $\\eta$ is unchanged. To deconvolve $K_D$ from $\\eta$, measure $y(u)$ for a matrix of gRNAs spanning different $K_D$ values (via designed mismatches) with a fixed effector domain, and for a matrix of effector domains spanning different $\\eta$ with a fixed gRNA; fit each curve to extract $u_{50}$ (the inducer at half-maximal effect) and $E_{\\max}$ (the asymptotic repression at high $u$). Attribute systematic shifts in $u_{50}$ across gRNAs (at fixed effector) to changes in $K_D$, and systematic changes in $E_{\\max}$ across effectors (at fixed gRNA) to changes in $\\eta$.

To separate $K_D$ from $\\eta$, drive dCas9 with a stronger promoter to increase $C$ and thereby measure potency independent of binding, since higher $C$ eliminates the influence of $K_D$. Horizontal shifts with gRNA changes will be negligible once $C$ is large, so any remaining differences in $y(u)$ must reflect $\\eta$.", "solution": "We proceed to derive the dose-response curve and analyze its properties. Let us use the CRISPRi model for this analysis, as the conclusions generalize directly to the CRISPRa case.\nSubstituting the expression for $C(u)$ into the formula for $\\theta(u)$:\n$$ \\theta(u) = \\dfrac{\\alpha u}{\\alpha u + K_D} $$\nNow, substituting this into the output expression for CRISPRi:\n$$ y(u) = y_0 \\left(1 - \\eta \\left( \\dfrac{\\alpha u}{\\alpha u + K_D} \\right) \\right) $$\nThis equation describes the dose-response curve, relating the inducer concentration $u$ to the reporter output $y$.\n\nTo understand how this curve shifts, we must analyze its key features: the maximal effect and the concentration required for half-maximal effect, denoted as $u_{50}$.\n\nThe baseline expression, at $u=0$, is $y(0) = y_0(1-0) = y_0$.\nThe expression at saturating inducer concentration ($u \\to \\infty$) is:\n$$ y_{\\text{sat}} = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} y(u) = y_0 \\left(1 - \\eta \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{\\alpha u}{\\alpha u + K_D} \\right) = y_0 \\left(1 - \\eta \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{1}{1 + K_D/(\\alpha u)} \\right) = y_0(1 - \\eta) $$\nThe maximal repression depth is the difference $y(0) - y_{\\text{sat}} = y_0 - y_0(1-\\eta) = y_0 \\eta$. This maximal effect depends on the basal expression $y_0$ and the effector potency $\\eta$, but it is independent of the gRNA affinity, represented by $K_D$.\n\nNext, we calculate the inducer concentration $u_{50}$ that yields the half-maximal effect. The response value halfway between the baseline ($y_0$) and the saturated level ($y_0(1-\\eta)$) is:\n$$ y_{50} = y_0(1-\\eta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left( y_0 - y_0(1-\\eta) \\right) = y_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\eta}{2}\\right) $$\nWe find $u_{50}$ by solving $y(u_{50}) = y_{50}$:\n$$ y_0 \\left(1 - \\eta \\left( \\dfrac{\\alpha u_{50}}{\\alpha u_{50} + K_D} \\right) \\right) = y_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\eta}{2}\\right) $$\nAssuming $\\eta \\neq 0$ and $y_0 \\neq 0$, we can simplify:\n$$ \\eta \\left( \\dfrac{\\alpha u_{50}}{\\alpha u_{50} + K_D} \\right) = \\frac{\\eta}{2} $$\n$$ \\dfrac{\\alpha u_{50}}{\\alpha u_{50} + K_D} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ 2 \\alpha u_{50} = \\alpha u_{50} + K_D $$\n$$ \\alpha u_{50} = K_D $$\n$$ u_{50} = \\frac{K_D}{\\alpha} $$\nThis result is crucial. The inducer concentration required for a half-maximal effect, $u_{50}$, is directly proportional to the dissociation constant $K_D$. A lower $K_D$ (stronger binding affinity) results in a lower $u_{50}$, meaning the dose-response curve shifts to the left on the $u$ axis. A decrease in $K_D$ by a factor of $10$ will cause a decrease in $u_{50}$ by the same factor of $10$.\n\nSummary of parameter effects:\n1.  Changing gRNA affinity (varying $K_D$) horizontally shifts the dose-response curve. $u_{50}$ is proportional to $K_D$.\n2.  Changing effector potency (varying $\\eta$) vertically scales the response range. The maximal effect is proportional to $\\eta$.\n\nWith this theoretical framework, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. This option states that decreasing $K_D$ by a factor of $10$ shifts the curve leftward by a factor of $10$ without changing the maximal repression depth, if $\\eta$ is constant. Our derivation shows $u_{50} = K_D/\\alpha$ and maximal repression is $y_0 \\eta$. This prediction is precisely correct. The option then proposes a deconvolution strategy: perform a matrix experiment, varying gRNAs (to vary $K_D$) while keeping the effector fixed, and varying effectors (to vary $\\eta$) while keeping the gRNA fixed. Then, by fitting the resulting dose-response curves, one can extract $u_{50}$ and the maximal effect $E_{\\max}$ (which corresponds to $y_0\\eta$). Changes in $u_{50}$ across gRNAs would be attributed to changes in $K_D$, while changes in $E_{\\max}$ across effectors would be attributed to changes in $\\eta$. This is a perfect experimental design based on our analysis, as it isolates the variables. The suggestion to independently quantify $C(u)$ is an excellent and necessary experimental control to ensure the dCas9:gRNA concentration profile is not an unintended variable.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. This option claims that decreasing $K_D$ increases maximal repression depth and leaves $u_{50}$ unchanged. Our derivation proves this false; $K_D$ controls $u_{50}$, and $\\eta$ controls the maximal repression depth. The proposed deconvolution strategy of varying chromatin state is not suitable for cleanly separating $K_D$ and $\\eta$ as defined in the problem, as it introduces a new, complex variable that could affect both binding and effector function.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. This option claims changing gRNA affinity alters the Hill coefficient $n$. The derived response curve has the form $\\theta(u) = \\frac{u}{u + u_{50}}$, which is a Michaelis-Menten function, corresponding to a Hill coefficient of $n=1$. Changing $K_D$ only changes $u_{50}$; it does not introduce cooperativity or alter the fundamental shape, so $n$ remains $1$. The prediction is false. The proposed strategy using dynamic hysteresis is designed to probe non-equilibrium dynamics, which is irrelevant to the equilibrium model given in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. This option suggests increasing $C$ by using a stronger promoter to measure potency ($\\eta$) independent of binding ($K_D$). At very high $C$ (such that $C \\gg K_D$), occupancy $\\theta$ approaches $1$, and the output $y$ approaches its saturating value $y_0(1-\\eta)$. This does allow a measurement of $\\eta$, a valid point. However, this strategy is proposed to \"deconvolve\" $K_D$ and $\\eta$. By driving the system into saturation where $C \\gg K_D$, the system's output becomes insensitive to $K_D$, making it impossible to measure or compare different $K_D$ values. This strategy helps measure one parameter by masking the other, rather than enabling the separate measurement of both. The strategy in option A is superior because it allows for the characterization of both parameters across their relevant ranges. Therefore, this is not a complete deconvolution strategy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A provides a correct theoretical prediction and a sound, comprehensive experimental strategy to address the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2726372"}]}
