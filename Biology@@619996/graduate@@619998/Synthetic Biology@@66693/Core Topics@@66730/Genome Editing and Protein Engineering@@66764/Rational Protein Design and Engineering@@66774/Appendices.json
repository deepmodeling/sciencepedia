Since the denominator $P(D)$ is a normalization constant independent of $H$, and the prior probabilities are given as equal ($P(H=\\alpha) = P(H=3_{10}) = 0.5$), maximizing the posterior probability is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood $P(D|H)$.\n\nThe observations $\\mathbf{x}_i$ are stated to be independent and identically distributed draws from a bivariate normal distribution, conditioned on the helix type $H$.

It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and all parameters are defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed to find the solution.\n\nThe problem is to find the global minimum energy (GME) configuration of a tripeptide system. The total energy for a rotamer assignment $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$, where $r_i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, is given by the pairwise-decomposable function:\n$$E(r_1,r_2,r_3) = h_1(r_1) + h_2(r_2) + h_3(r_3) + J_{12}(r_1,r_2) + J_{13}(r_1,r_3) + J_{23}(r_2,r_3)$$\n\nFirst, we assemble the given energy parameters into vector and matrix forms as required.\n\nThe self-energies $h_i(r_i)$ are:\n$$\nh_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.1 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\nh_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 & 0.5 & -0.1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\nh_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 & 0.6 & 0.3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe pairwise interaction energies $J_{ij}(r_i, r_j)$ form three matrices, $E_{12}$, $E_{13}$, and $E_{23}$, where $[E_{ij}]_{k,l} = J_{ij}(k,l)$:\n$$\nE_{12} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 & 0.5 & -0.2 \\\\ 0.5 & 0.2 & 0.4 \\\\ -0.2 & 0.4 & 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nE_{13} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3 & -0.1 & 0.2 \\\\ -0.1 & 0.0 & 0.6 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nE_{23} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 & 0.4 & -0.3 \\\\ 0.4 & 0.5 & 0.2 \\\\ -0.3 & 0.2 & 0.0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe will employ a branch-and-bound (BnB) search algorithm to find the GME. We will branch on the residues in the order $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. The core of the BnB algorithm is the calculation of a lower bound for the energy of any complete assignment within a given branch (a partial assignment). For a partial assignment on a set of residues $A$, the lower bound $LB$ on the total energy is the exact energy of the partial assignment plus an optimistic (minimal) estimate of the energy of the remaining unassigned residues $U$:\n$$LB = E_{partial}(A) + \\sum_{k \\in U} \\min_{r_k} \\left( h_k(r_k) + \\sum_{j \\in A} J_{jk}(r_j, r_k) \\right) + \\sum_{k,l \\in U, k<l} \\min_{r_k, r_l} J_{kl}(r_k, r_l)$$\nThroughout the search, we maintain an upper bound on the GME, $E_{best}$, which is the lowest energy found so far for any full assignment. If at any node in the search tree $LB \\ge E_{best}$, that entire branch can be pruned.\n\nWe begin by finding a good initial upper bound. A heuristic choice is the configuration that minimizes self-energies: $(r_1, r_2, r_3) = (2, 3, 1)$. The energy of this state is:\n$$E(2,3,1) = h_1(2) + h_2(3) + h_3(1) + J_{12}(2,3) + J_{13}(2,1) + J_{23}(3,1)$$\n$$E(2,3,1) = 0.1 + (-0.1) + 0.0 + 0.4 + (-0.1) + (-0.3) = 0.0$$\nWe initialize our upper bound: $E_{best} = 0.0$.\n\nNow, we begin the systematic search.\nBranching on residue $1$:\n**Branch 1: $r_1=1$**\nThe partial energy is $h_1(1) = 0.8$. The unassigned residues are $U=\\{2,3\\}$. The lower bound is:\n$$LB(r_1=1) = h_1(1) + \\min_{r_2}[h_2(r_2) + J_{12}(1,r_2)] + \\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(1,r_3)] + \\min_{r_2, r_3} J_{23}(r_2,r_3)$$\nLet us calculate the components:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $h_1(1) = 0.8$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_2}[h_2(r_2) + J_{12}(1,r_2)] = \\min(0.2+0.0, 0.5+0.5, -0.1-0.2) = \\min(0.2, 1.0, -0.3) = -0.3$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(1,r_3)] = \\min(0.0+0.3, 0.6-0.1, 0.3+0.2) = \\min(0.3, 0.5, 0.5) = 0.3$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_2, r_3} J_{23}(r_2,r_3) = -0.3$, which corresponds to $J_{23}(1,3)$ and $J_{23}(3,1)$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, $LB(r_1=1) = 0.8 + (-0.3) + 0.3 + (-0.3) = 0.5$.\nSince $LB(r_1=1) = 0.5 > E_{best} = 0.0$, we can **prune this entire branch**. All $3^2=9$ states with $r_1=1$ are guaranteed to have an energy of at least $0.5$ and cannot be the minimum. This is a non-trivial pruning step.\n\n**Branch 2: $r_1=2$**\nThe partial energy is $h_1(2) = 0.1$. The lower bound is:\n$$LB(r_1=2) = h_1(2) + \\min_{r_2}[h_2(r_2) + J_{12}(2,r_2)] + \\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(2,r_3)] + \\min_{r_2, r_3} J_{23}(r_2,r_3)$$\nThe components are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $h_1(2) = 0.1$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_2}[h_2(r_2) + J_{12}(2,r_2)] = \\min(0.2+0.5, 0.5+0.2, -0.1+0.4) = \\min(0.7, 0.7, 0.3) = 0.3$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(2,r_3)] = \\min(0.0-0.1, 0.6+0.0, 0.3+0.6) = \\min(-0.1, 0.6, 0.9) = -0.1$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_2, r_3} J_{23}(r_2,r_3) = -0.3$\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, $LB(r_1=2) = 0.1 + 0.3 + (-0.1) + (-0.3) = 0.0$.\nSince $LB(r_1=2) = 0.0 \\le E_{best} = 0.0$, this branch must be explored further.\n\n**Branch 3: $r_1=3$**\nThe partial energy is $h_1(3) = 0.4$. The lower bound is:\n$$LB(r_1=3) = h_1(3) + \\min_{r_2}[h_2(r_2) + J_{12}(3,r_2)] + \\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(3,r_3)] + \\min_{r_2, r_3} J_{23}(r_2,r_3)$$\nThe components are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $h_1(3) = 0.4$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_2}[h_2(r_2) + J_{12}(3,r_2)] = \\min(0.2-0.2, 0.5+0.4, -0.1+0.1) = \\min(0.0, 0.9, 0.0) = 0.0$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(3,r_3)] = \\min(0.0+0.2, 0.6+0.6, 0.3+0.1) = \\min(0.2, 1.2, 0.4) = 0.2$\n    \\item $\\min_{r_2, r_3} J_{23}(r_2,r_3) = -0.3$\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, $LB(r_1=3) = 0.4 + 0.0 + 0.2 + (-0.3) = 0.3$.\nSince $LB(r_1=3) = 0.3 > E_{best} = 0.0$, this branch is also pruned.\n\nThe search is now restricted to the branch where $r_1=2$. We proceed to branch on $r_2$.\n\n**Sub-branch 2.1: $(r_1, r_2) = (2, 1)$**\nThe partial energy is $E_{part} = h_1(2) + h_2(1) + J_{12}(2,1) = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.8$.\nThe lower bound is $LB(2,1) = E_{part} + \\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(2,r_3) + J_{23}(1,r_3)]$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $r_3=1$: $h_3(1)+J_{13}(2,1)+J_{23}(1,1) = 0.0 + (-0.1) + 0.2 = 0.1$\n    \\item For $r_3=2$: $h_3(2)+J_{13}(2,2)+J_{23}(1,2) = 0.6 + 0.0 + 0.4 = 1.0$\n    \\item For $r_3=3$: $h_3(3)+J_{13}(2,3)+J_{23}(1,3) = 0.3 + 0.6 + (-0.3) = 0.6$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe minimum optimistic completion is $0.1$. Thus, $LB(2,1) = 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9$.\nSince $0.9 > E_{best} = 0.0$, this sub-branch is pruned.\n\n**Sub-branch 2.2: $(r_1, r_2) = (2, 2)$**\nThe partial energy is $E_{part} = h_1(2) + h_2(2) + J_{12}(2,2) = 0.1 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.8$.\n$LB(2,2) = 0.8 + \\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(2,r_3) + J_{23}(2,r_3)]$. The completion term is $\\min(0.0-0.1+0.4, 0.6+0.0+0.5, 0.3+0.6+0.2) = \\min(0.3, 1.1, 1.1) = 0.3$.\n$LB(2,2) = 0.8 + 0.3 = 1.1$. Since $1.1 > E_{best} = 0.0$, this sub-branch is pruned.\n\n**Sub-branch 2.3: $(r_1, r_2) = (2, 3)$**\nThe partial energy is $E_{part} = h_1(2) + h_2(3) + J_{12}(2,3) = 0.1 + (-0.1) + 0.4 = 0.4$.\n$LB(2,3) = 0.4 + \\min_{r_3}[h_3(r_3) + J_{13}(2,r_3) + J_{23}(3,r_3)]$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $r_3=1$: $h_3(1)+J_{13}(2,1)+J_{23}(3,1) = 0.0 + (-0.1) + (-0.3) = -0.4$\n    \\item For $r_3=2$: $h_3(2)+J_{13}(2,2)+J_{23}(3,2) = 0.6 + 0.0 + 0.2 = 0.8$\n    \\item For $r_3=3$: $h_3(3)+J_{13}(2,3)+J_{23}(3,3) = 0.3 + 0.6 + 0.0 = 0.9$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe minimum optimistic completion is $-0.4$. Thus, $LB(2,3) = 0.4 + (-0.4) = 0.0$.\nSince $0.0 \\le E_{best} = 0.0$, we must evaluate the three full assignments in this sub-branch.\n\n**Level 3: Final assignments for $(r_1,r_2)=(2,3)$**\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item State $(2,3,1)$: $E(2,3,1) = E_{part}(2,3) + h_3(1) + J_{13}(2,1) + J_{23}(3,1) = 0.4 + 0.0 + (-0.1) + (-0.3) = 0.0$. This matches our current $E_{best}$. $E_{best}$ remains $0.0$.\n    \\item State $(2,3,2)$: $E(2,3,2) = E_{part}(2,3) + h_3(2) + J_{13}(2,2) + J_{23}(3,2) = 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.0 + 0.2 = 1.2$.

This is not a new minimum.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe search is now complete. All $27$ possible states have been implicitly or explicitly considered. The minimum energy found is $0.0$, corresponding to the state $(r_1, r_2, r_3) = (2, 3, 1)$.\n\nThe global minimum energy is $E_{\\min} = 0.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0}$$", "id": "2767949"}]}
