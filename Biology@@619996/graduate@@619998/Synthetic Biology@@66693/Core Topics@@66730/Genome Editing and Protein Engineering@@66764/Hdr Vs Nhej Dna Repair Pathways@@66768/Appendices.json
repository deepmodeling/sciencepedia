It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical kinetics applied to molecular biology. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the System of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the rates of the two competing repair processes. The rate of change for each population is described as follows:\n\nThe population of unrepaired DSBs, $D(t)$, decreases as DSBs are repaired by either NHEJ or HDR. Since each repair event is a first-order process, the rate of repair is proportional to the number of available DSBs. The total rate of depletion of $D(t)$ is the sum of the rates of the two pathways.\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = - (\\text{rate of NHEJ}) - (\\text{rate of HDR}) = -k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}D(t) - k_{\\mathrm{HDR}}D(t)\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = -(k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} + k_{\\mathrm{HDR}})D(t)\n$$\nThe cumulative number of DSBs repaired by NHEJ, $N(t)$, increases at the rate that NHEJ events occur.\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}D(t)\n$$\nSimilarly, the cumulative number of DSBs repaired by HDR, $H(t)$, increases at the rate that HDR events occur.\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{HDR}}D(t)\n$$\nThus, we have the system of three linear first-order ODEs with initial conditions $D(0)=D_0$, $N(0)=0$, and $H(0)=0$.\n\n**Solution of the ODEs**\n\nFirst, we solve for $D(t)$. The equation for $D(t)$ is a simple exponential decay equation. Let $k_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} + k_{\\mathrm{HDR}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{total}}D(t)\n$$\nThis equation has the general solution $D(t) = C \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}t)$ for some constant $C$.
