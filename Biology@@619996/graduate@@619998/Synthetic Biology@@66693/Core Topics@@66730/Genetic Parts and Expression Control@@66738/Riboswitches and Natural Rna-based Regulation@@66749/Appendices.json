A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins from the law of mass action for a $1{:}1$ reversible binding reaction between a riboswitch aptamer, $R$, and a small-molecule ligand, $L$, to form a complex, $RL$:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nAt equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the dissociated species to the concentration of the complex:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of the free, unbound aptamer, $[L]$ is the concentration of the free, unbound ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the ligand-bound aptamer complex.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total aptamer population that is bound by the ligand. For a system with a single binding site per aptamer, this is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of bound aptamers}}{\\text{Total concentration of aptamers}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe total concentration of the aptamer, $[R]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of the free and bound forms:\n$$[R]_{\\text{tot}} = [R] + [RL]$$\nTo derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to express the concentration of free aptamer, $[R]$, in terms of other variables:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the mass balance equation for the aptamer:\n$$[R]_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]$$\nFactoring out the term $[RL]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$[R]_{\\text{tot}} = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right)$$\nRearranging this equation to find the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}}$ yields the fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo obtain the standard form of the equation, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for fractional occupancy as a function of $K_d$ and $[L]$.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $\\theta$, we use the given data.

The fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is the probability that a riboswitch is in the ligand-bound conformation. The overall regulatory output of the gene controlled by the riboswitch is a population-weighted average of the expression levels corresponding to the unbound and bound states.\n\nFor a repressing riboswitch, ligand binding reduces or abolishes gene expression (e.g., by forming a transcription terminator). The unbound state is \"ON,\" and the bound state is \"OFF.\" The overall expression level is proportional to $(1-\\theta)$, the fraction of riboswitches in the active, unbound state. As ligand concentration increases, $\\theta$ increases from $0$ to $1$, causing the expression level to decrease. A higher $\\theta$ therefore corresponds to stronger repression.\n\nFor an activating riboswitch, ligand binding promotes gene expression (e.g., by resolving a terminator stem into an anti-terminator). The unbound state is \"OFF,\" and the bound state is \"ON.\" The overall expression level is directly proportional to $\\theta$, the fraction of riboswitches in the active, bound state. As ligand concentration increases, $\\theta$ increases, causing the expression level to increase. A higher $\\theta$ therefore corresponds to stronger activation.\n\nIn both scenarios, $\\theta$ acts as a transfer function that converts the input signal (ligand concentration) into the proportion of macromolecular switches that have changed state, which in turn dictates the magnitude of the downstream regulatory response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.833}\n$$", "id": "2771122"}, {"introduction": "Once a ligand is sensed, a riboswitch must transduce this information into a structural change, typically by modulating the stability of a regulatory hairpin.

Therefore, the calculated value of $-2.28$ is expressed as $-2.280~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The negative sign indicates that, under these conditions, the folded hairpin state is thermodynamically favored over the unfolded state.\n\nFor the qualitative analysis, the stability of the hairpin is quantified by its overall Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$. A more negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ signifies a more stable structure. The free energy contribution from the loop, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{loop}}$, is fundamentally an entropic penalty arising from the loss of conformational freedom when the flexible RNA chain is constrained into a closed loop. For loops of biologically relevant sizes (typically $L \\ge 3$), this penalty is always positive ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{loop}} > 0$).\n\nThe magnitude of this penalty generally increases with loop size $L$. Ignoring special stabilizing motifs, the relationship for loops that are not sterically strained is often approximated by a logarithmic function, e.g., $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{loop}}(L) \\propto \\ln(L)$. Therefore, increasing the loop size $L$ increases the positive value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{loop}}(L)$. Since $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{stacks}} + \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{loop}}(L)$, a larger loop size leads to a less negative (or more positive) $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{total}}$, which corresponds to a decrease in overall hairpin stability. Conversely, decreasing the loop size (down to the steric limit, typically $L=3$) would decrease the entropic penalty, resulting in a more negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{total}}$ and thus a more stable hairpin.\n\nIn the functional context of a riboswitch, where this hairpin sequesters a ribosome binding site (RBS), hairpin stability is a primary determinant of the regulatory outcome. The riboswitch exists in an equilibrium between a translationally 'OFF' (folded hairpin) and 'ON' (unfolded, accessible RBS) state.\n- Higher hairpin stability (e.g., from a smaller loop, yielding a more negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) biases the equilibrium toward the folded 'OFF' state, resulting in more effective sequestration of the RBS and stronger repression of translation.\n- Lower hairpin stability (e.g., from a larger loop, yielding a less negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) shifts the equilibrium toward the unfolded 'ON' state. This leads to a 'leakier' switch, characterized by weaker repression and a higher basal level of gene expression.\nConsequently, loop size is a critical design parameter for engineering synthetic riboswitches, as it allows for the fine-tuning of the switch's regulatory properties, such as its dynamic range and sensitivity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2.280}\n$$", "id": "2771137"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the goal of quantitative biology is to build predictive models that connect molecular mechanisms to cellular phenotypes.
