Consider two variants, fluorescent protein 1 (FP1) and fluorescent protein 2 (FP2), each dissolved at the same molar concentration in the same cuvette of optical path length and measured with the same illumination intensity and the same detection optics.

No rounding is required; report the exact ratio.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. It is based on established principles of photophysics and is well-posed. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the steady-state emitted photon fluxes per unit volume, which we define as the brightness $B$, for two fluorescent proteins, FP1 and FP2. The brightness $B$ is the number of photons emitted per unit time per unit volume.\n\nAccording to the definition provided, the quantum yield, $\\Phi$, is the ratio of the number of emitted photons to the number of absorbed photons. In terms of rates per unit volume, this can be written as:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{B}{N_{abs}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{abs}$ is the rate of photon absorption per unit volume. From this, the brightness is directly proportional to the rate of photon absorption:\n$$\nB = \\Phi \\cdot N_{abs}\n$$\n\nOur task is to find an expression for $N_{abs}$ starting from the Beer–Lambert law. The Beer–Lambert law is given as $A = \\varepsilon c \\ell$, where $A$ is the decadic absorbance, $\\varepsilon$ is the molar decadic extinction coefficient, $c$ is the molar concentration, and $\\ell$ is the optical path length. The absorbance is also defined as $A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_t}\\right)$, where $I_0$ is the incident light intensity and $I_t$ is the transmitted light intensity.\n\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_t}\\right) = \\varepsilon c \\ell\n$$\nExponentiating both sides with base $10$ allows us to express the transmitted intensity as:\n$$\nI_t = I_0 \\cdot 10^{-\\varepsilon c \\ell}\n$$\nThe absorbed intensity, $I_{abs}$, is the difference between the incident and transmitted intensities:\n$$\nI_{abs} = I_0 - I_t = I_0 - I_0 \\cdot 10^{-\\varepsilon c \\ell} = I_0 \\left(1 - 10^{-\\varepsilon c \\ell}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the solution is dilute, with absorbance $A < 0.05$. In this limit, the argument of the exponential, $\\varepsilon c \\ell$, is much less than $1$. We can use a Taylor series expansion for the exponential term. First, we convert the base-$10$ exponential to a natural exponential:\n$$\n10^{-x} = \\exp(-\\ln(10)x)\n$$\nFor a small argument $y$, the Taylor expansion of $\\exp(-y)$ is approximately $1 - y$. Thus, for small $A = \\varepsilon c \\ell$, we have:\n$$\n10^{-\\varepsilon c \\ell} = \\exp(-\\ln(10)\\varepsilon c \\ell) \\approx 1 - \\ln(10)\\varepsilon c \\ell\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for absorbed intensity:\n$$\nI_{abs} \\approx I_0 \\left(1 - (1 - \\ln(10)\\varepsilon c \\ell)\\right) = I_0 \\ln(10) \\varepsilon c \\ell\n$$\nThis expression gives the total intensity absorbed over the entire path length $\\ell$. The rate of photon absorption per unit volume, $N_{abs}$, must be derived from this. Let us consider the energy flux (intensity) as being proportional to the photon flux $F$ (photons per unit area per unit time). The total number of photons absorbed per unit time in the cuvette volume $V = \\mathcal{A} \\ell$, where $\\mathcal{A}$ is the cross-sectional area of the beam, is $F_{abs} \\mathcal{A} \\propto I_{abs} \\mathcal{A}$.\n$$\n\\text{Total photons absorbed per second} \\propto I_0 \\ln(10) \\varepsilon c \\ell \\mathcal{A}\n$$\nTo find the average rate of absorption per unit volume, we divide this by the volume $V = \\mathcal{A}\\ell$:\n$$\nN_{abs} = \\frac{\\text{Total photons absorbed per second}}{\\text{Volume}} \\propto \\frac{I_0 \\ln(10) \\varepsilon c \\ell \\mathcal{A}}{\\mathcal{A}\\ell} = I_0 \\ln(10) \\varepsilon c\n$$\nThis demonstrates that in the dilute limit, the rate of photon absorption per unit volume is approximately uniform throughout the sample and is proportional to the incident intensity $I_0$, the concentration $c$, and the extinction coefficient $\\varepsilon$.\n\nNow we can write the expression for the brightness $B$:\n$$\nB = \\Phi \\cdot N_{abs} \\propto \\Phi \\varepsilon c I_0\n$$\nThe product $\\Phi\\varepsilon$ is often referred to as the molecular brightness of a fluorophore.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of brightness for FP1 and FP2, denoted as $B_1/B_2$.\n$$\n\\frac{B_1}{B_2} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\Phi_1 \\varepsilon_1 c_1 I_{0,1}}{k \\cdot \\Phi_2 \\varepsilon_2 c_2 I_{0,2}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The problem states that the molar concentrations are the same ($c_1 = c_2 = c$) and the illumination intensities are the same ($I_{0,1} = I_{0,2} = I_0$). The other factors such as collection efficiency are also identical and cancel out. Therefore, the ratio simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{B_1}{B_2} = \\frac{\\Phi_1 \\varepsilon_1}{\\Phi_2 \\varepsilon_2}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the relative brightness.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\nFor FP1: $\\varepsilon_{1}=60,000\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}cm^{-1}}$ and $\\Phi_{1}=0.6$.\nFor FP2: $\\varepsilon_{2}=30,000\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}cm^{-1}}$ and $\\Phi_{2}=0.8$.\n\nThe numerical ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{B_1}{B_2} = \\frac{0.6 \\times 60,000}{0.8 \\times 30,000} = \\frac{36,000}{24,000} = \\frac{36}{24}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3 \\times 12}{2 \\times 12} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n$$\nThe ratio of the steady-state emitted photon fluxes per unit volume for FP1 versus FP2 is $1.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.5}$$", "id": "2722849"}, {"introduction": "An ideal reporter would be instantly active upon synthesis, but real fluorescent proteins require time to fold and undergo chromophore maturation.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\nThe per-cell catalytic activity, which we will denote as $\\alpha$, is defined as the number of product molecules formed per unit time per cell.

The number of molecules is related to the number of moles, $n$, by Avogadro's constant, $N_{A}$, such that $N = n N_{A}$. The activity can then be written in terms of the molar production rate, $\\frac{dn}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{N_{A}}{N_{cells}} \\frac{dn}{dt}\n$$\nThe number of moles $n$ in a volume $V_{well}$ is given by $n = C V_{well}$, where $C$ is the molar concentration. The rate of mole production is thus $\\frac{dn}{dt} = V_{well} \\frac{dC}{dt}$. The total number of cells is $N_{cells} = \\rho_{cell} V_{well}$, where $\\rho_{cell}$ is the cell concentration (cells per unit volume). Substituting these into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{N_{A}}{\\rho_{cell} V_{well}} \\left( V_{well} \\frac{dC}{dt} \\right) = \\frac{N_{A}}{\\rho_{cell}} \\frac{dC}{dt}\n$$\nThis shows that the per-cell activity is an intensive property, independent of the assay volume $V_{well}$.\n\nThe rate of change of product concentration, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$, is related to the measured rate of change of absorbance, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, by the Beer-Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon C l$. For the initial linear phase of the reaction, we differentiate with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\varepsilon l \\frac{dC}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the molar extinction coefficient and $l$ is the optical path length.

The volume of the liquid is $V_{well} = A_{cross} l$, where $A_{cross}$ is the cross-sectional area. The well has a circular cross-section with diameter $d$.\n$$\nA_{cross} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n$$\nTherefore, the path length is $l = \\frac{V_{well}}{A_{cross}} = \\frac{4V_{well}}{\\pi d^2}$.

For the sample with $\\text{OD}_{600} = 0.100$:\n$$\n\\rho_{cell} = (0.100) \\times (8.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{cells}/\\text{mL}) = 8.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{cells}/\\text{mL}\n$$\nFor consistency in units, we will convert this concentration.
