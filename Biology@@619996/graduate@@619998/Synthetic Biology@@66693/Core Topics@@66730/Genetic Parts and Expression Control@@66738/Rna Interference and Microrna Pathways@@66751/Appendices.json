In a well-mixed cellular environment at constant temperature, assume reversible bimolecular binding between free RISC-loaded miRNA (ligand) and the target site on the mRNA (receptor site), with association rate constant $k_{on}$ and dissociation rate constant $k_{off}$. The system is assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium, the site is non-cooperative and monovalent, and the total site concentration is sufficiently low compared to the free miRNA concentration such that depletion of free ligand is negligible (that is, free miRNA concentration is well approximated by the total miRNA concentration). Fractional occupancy is defined as the fraction of sites bound by RISC-loaded miRNA at equilibrium.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action for the reversible reaction and the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{D}$ in terms of $k_{on}$ and $k_{off}$, derive an expression for the equilibrium fractional occupancy in terms of the free miRNA concentration and $K_{D}$.
