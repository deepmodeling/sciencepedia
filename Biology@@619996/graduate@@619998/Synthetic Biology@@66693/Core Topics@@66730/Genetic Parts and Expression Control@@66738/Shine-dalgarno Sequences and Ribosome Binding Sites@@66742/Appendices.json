The solution will be formulated based on the principles of statistical thermodynamics as described.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationships provided in the problem statement. The translation initiation rate, which we denote as $I$, is stated to be proportional to the equilibrium occupancy of the ribosome on the ribosome binding site (RBS). The equilibrium occupancy, in turn, is proportional to the Boltzmann factor associated with the total Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$.
