There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\n\nThe problem states that the number of integration events per cell, $K$, follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of $\\lambda$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $K$ is given by:\n$$ P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} $$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) representing the number of events, and $\\lambda$ is the average rate of events, which in this context is the MOI.\n\nPart 1: Derive the expression for $f_{1}(\\lambda)$.\nThe function $f_{1}(\\lambda)$ represents the expected fraction of cells that carry exactly one integration event. This corresponds to the probability that the random variable $K$ takes the value $1$. We can find this by substituting $k=1$ into the Poisson PMF:\n$$ f_{1}(\\lambda) = P(K=1) = \\frac{\\lambda^{1} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1!} $$\nSince $1! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ f_{1}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nThis is the desired expression for the fraction of cells with a single integration event as a function of the MOI, $\\lambda$.\n\nPart 2: Determine $\\lambda^{\\star}$ and the maximal fraction $f_{1}(\\lambda^{\\star})$.\nTo find the value of $\\lambda$ that maximizes $f_{1}(\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\ge 0$, we must use differential calculus. We need to find the critical points of $f_{1}(\\lambda)$ by taking its derivative with respect to $\\lambda$ and setting it to zero.\n\nThe function to be maximized is $f_{1}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)$.\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}(uv) = u\\frac{dv}{d\\lambda} + v\\frac{du}{d\\lambda}$, with $u=\\lambda$ and $v=\\exp(-\\lambda)$:\n$$ \\frac{d f_{1}}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) \\right) = (1) \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda) + \\lambda \\cdot (-\\exp(-\\lambda)) $$\n$$ \\frac{d f_{1}}{d\\lambda} = \\exp(-\\lambda) - \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)\\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$ (1-\\lambda)\\exp(-\\lambda) = 0 $$\nThe term $\\exp(-\\lambda)$ is strictly positive for all real values of $\\lambda$. Therefore, the equation is satisfied only if the term $(1-\\lambda)$ is zero:\n$$ 1 - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 1 $$\nThis gives a single critical point at $\\lambda = 1$.\n\nTo confirm that this point corresponds to a maximum, we apply the second derivative test. We differentiate $\\frac{d f_{1}}{d\\lambda}$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2} f_{1}}{d\\lambda^{2}} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( (1-\\lambda)\\exp(-\\lambda) \\right) = (-1) \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda) + (1-\\lambda) \\cdot (-\\exp(-\\lambda)) $$\n$$ \\frac{d^{2} f_{1}}{d\\lambda^{2}} = -\\exp(-\\lambda) - \\exp(-\\lambda) + \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) = (\\lambda-2)\\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical point $\\lambda=1$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d^{2} f_{1}}{d\\lambda^{2}} \\right|_{\\lambda=1} = (1-2)\\exp(-1) = -1 \\cdot \\exp(-1) = -\\exp(-1) $$\nSince $\\exp(-1)$ is a positive constant, the second derivative at $\\lambda=1$ is negative. This confirms that $f_{1}(\\lambda)$ has a local maximum at $\\lambda=1$.\n\nThe domain of the function is $\\lambda \\ge 0$. We must check the behavior at the boundary. At $\\lambda=0$, $f_{1}(0) = 0 \\cdot \\exp(0) = 0$. As $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, $f_{1}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) \\to 0$ (as the exponential decay dominates the linear growth). Since the function is zero at the boundary and its limit at infinity, and has only one critical point which is a local maximum, this local maximum must be the global maximum over the domain $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\nThus, the optimal MOI is $\\lambda^{\\star} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the corresponding maximal fraction of single-integrant cells by substituting $\\lambda^{\\star}=1$ into the expression for $f_{1}(\\lambda)$:\n$$ f_{1}(\\lambda^{\\star}) = f_{1}(1) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-1) = \\exp(-1) $$\nThis means that at an MOI of $1$, the fraction of cells containing exactly one genetic construct is maximized, and this maximum fraction is $\\exp(-1)$, which is approximately $0.368$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the pair $(\\lambda^{\\star}, f_{1}(\\lambda^{\\star}))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\exp(-1)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2743973"}, {"introduction": "After designing the screen, the next practical question is one of resources: how long must the cell sorter run to collect enough target cells for downstream analysis?

The model relies on the Poisson process and independent Bernoulli trials, which are fundamental and appropriate tools for this type of analysis. The parameters provided are realistic for modern instrumentation. The question is unambiguous and all necessary information for a unique solution is provided. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe task is to derive an expression for the expected number of collected target cells and then use this to find the time required to collect a specified number of cells.\n\nLet $N(T)$ be the random variable representing the total number of events (cells) arriving at the interrogation point in a time interval of duration $T$. According to the problem statement, this follows a homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate $r$. The probability mass function of $N(T)$ is given by:\n$$P(N(T) = k) = \\frac{\\exp(-rT)(rT)^k}{k!}, \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$$\nThe expectation of $N(T)$ is $E[N(T)] = rT$.\n\nFor any single event arriving at the sorter, there are two successive, independent conditions that must be met for it to be a collected target cell.\nFirst, the cell must be a target, which occurs with probability $f$.\nSecond, conditional on being a target, the cell must be successfully sorted and collected, which occurs with probability $\\eta$.\nThe probability, $p_{coll}$, that any given arriving cell is successfully collected as a target is the product of these probabilities:\n$$p_{coll} = f \\eta$$\n\nLet $N_{coll}(T)$ be the random variable for the number of collected target cells in the time interval $T$. We can find its expectation, $E[N_{coll}(T)]$, using the law of total expectation (also known as the tower property of expectation):\n$$E[N_{coll}(T)] = E[E[N_{coll}(T) | N(T)]]$$\nGiven a fixed number of total arrivals, $N(T)=k$, the number of collected target cells, $N_{coll}(T)$, is the number of successes in $k$ independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p_{coll}$. This is a binomial distribution, $N_{coll}(T)|_{N(T)=k} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(k, p_{coll})$.\nThe conditional expectation is therefore:\n$$E[N_{coll}(T) | N(T)=k] = k \\cdot p_{coll} = k f \\eta$$\nSubstituting this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$E[N_{coll}(T)] = E[N(T) \\cdot f \\eta]$$\nSince $f$ and $\\eta$ are constants, they can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$E[N_{coll}(T)] = f \\eta \\cdot E[N(T)]$$\nSubstituting $E[N(T)] = rT$, we arrive at the expression for the expected number of collected target cells:\n$$E[N_{coll}(T)] = r T f \\eta$$\n\nAlternatively, one can use the \"thinning\" property of Poisson processes. A Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$, when its events are independently selected with probability $p$, results in a new Poisson process with rate $\\lambda p$. In this problem, the initial process of rate $r$ is thinned by the target probability $f$, resulting in a Poisson process of target cells with rate $rf$. This process is then thinned again by the sort yield $\\eta$, resulting in a final Poisson process of collected target cells with rate $r_{coll} = r f \\eta$. The expected number of events for this new process over a duration $T$ is simply its rate multiplied by the duration, which is $(r f \\eta)T$, confirming the previous result.\n\nThe problem asks for the average time required, $T_{req}$, to collect $N_{target} = 10^6$ cells. The average rate of collection is constant and is given by $R_{coll} = r f \\eta$. The required time is the total number of cells to be collected divided by the average collection rate.\n$$T_{req} = \\frac{N_{target}}{R_{coll}} = \\frac{N_{target}}{r f \\eta}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$N_{target} = 10^6$\n$r = 5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$f = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$\\eta = 0.85$\n\nFirst, calculate the collection rate in cells per second:\n$$R_{coll} = (5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 0.85$$\n$$R_{coll} = (25 \\times 10^{1}) \\times 0.85 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 250 \\times 0.85 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 212.5 \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nNow, calculate the required time in seconds:\n$$T_{req, s} = \\frac{10^6}{212.5} \\text{ s} \\approx 4705.88235 \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in hours.
