It describes a simple linear reaction network, a fundamental model in chemical kinetics and systems biology. The principles of mass-action kinetics are to be applied, which is a standard and rigorous method. The problem provides all necessary information—the reaction scheme and the nature of the rate constants—to construct a system of linear ODEs. It is well-established that for positive rate constants, such a system possesses a unique, stable, positive steady-state solution. The problem is therefore not ill-posed, incomplete, or contradictory. It is a straightforward application of first principles, not a trivial or pseudo-profound question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe evolution of the concentrations $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations derived from the principle of mass-action kinetics. For each species, the rate of change of its concentration is the sum of the rates of all reactions producing it minus the sum of the rates of all reactions consuming it.\n\nFor species $A$, its concentration is denoted by $a(t)$.\n- Production of $A$ occurs through the reaction $\\emptyset \\xrightarrow{k_0} A$. This is a zero-order reaction with respect to the system's species, so its rate is simply the constant $k_0$.\n- Consumption of $A$ occurs through the reaction $A \\xrightarrow{k_1} B$. This is a first-order reaction with respect to $A$, so its rate is $k_1 a(t)$.\nThe resulting differential equation for $a(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = k_0 - k_1 a(t) $$\n\nFor species $B$, its concentration is denoted by $b(t)$.\n- Production of $B$ occurs through the reaction $A \\xrightarrow{k_1} B$. The rate of this reaction, and thus the production rate of $B$, is $k_1 a(t)$.\n- Consumption of $B$ occurs through the reaction $B \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\emptyset$. This is a first-order reaction with respect to $B$, so its rate is $k_2 b(t)$.\nThe resulting differential equation for $b(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{db}{dt} = k_1 a(t) - k_2 b(t) $$\n\nThe system of ODEs is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = k_0 - k_1 a $$\n$$ \\frac{db}{dt} = k_1 a - k_2 b $$\n\nA steady state is defined as the condition where the concentrations of all species do not change with time.

Since concentrations must be positive ($x_s>0$), we analyze the function $p(x) = x^3+x-3$. Its derivative is $p'(x) = 3x^2+1  0$, so the function is strictly increasing. Since $p(1) = -1$ and $p(2) = 7$, there is a unique real root $x_s \\in (1, 2)$. This defines the symmetric steady state $(x_s, x_s)$.\n\nCase $2$: $x^{\\ast}y^{\\ast} = 1$.\nSubstituting $y^{\\ast} = 1/x^{\\ast}$ into the first steady-state equation:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{3}{1 + (1/x^{\\ast})^2} = \\frac{3}{1 + 1/(x^{\\ast})^2} = \\frac{3(x^{\\ast})^2}{(x^{\\ast})^2+1}\n$$\nSince $x^{\\ast}>0$, we can divide by $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{3x^{\\ast}}{(x^{\\ast})^2+1} \\implies (x^{\\ast})^2 + 1 = 3x^{\\ast} \\implies (x^{\\ast})^2 - 3x^{\\ast} + 1 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the two roots for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n$$\nThis gives two asymmetric steady states:\n$SS_2: (x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$\n$SS_3: (x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$\n\nNow we analyze the stability of each of the three steady states using the trace-determinant test.

The determinant is $\\det(J_1) = 1 - \\frac{4}{9}(x_s^2)^3 = 1 - \\frac{4}{9}(x_s^3)^2$. From the cubic equation, we have $x_s^3 = 3 - x_s$.\n$$\n\\det(J_1) = 1 - \\frac{4}{9}(3-x_s)^2\n$$\nTo determine the sign, we must assess if $(3-x_s)^2  9/4$. This is equivalent to $|3-x_s|  3/2 = 1.5$. Since we established $1  x_s  2$, and more tightly $p(1.5) = 1.5^3+1.5-3=3.375-1.5=1.8750$, we know that $1  x_s  1.5$. Therefore, $1.5  3-x_s  2$, which implies $|3-x_s|  1.5$.\nThus, $\\frac{4}{9}(3-x_s)^2  1$, which makes $\\det(J_1)  0$. The symmetric steady state is a saddle point and is therefore **unstable**.\n\nStability of asymmetric states $SS_2$ and $SS_3$:\nFor both of these states, we established that $x^{\\ast}y^{\\ast} = 1$.\nThe determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(J_{2,3}) = 1 - \\frac{4}{9}(1)^3 = 1 - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n$$\nSince $\\det(J_{2,3}) = 5/9  0$ and $\\text{tr}(J) = -2  0$, both asymmetric steady states are **stable**. The eigenvalues are real, so they are stable nodes.\n\nIn conclusion, the system has three steady states: one symmetric state which is unstable, and two asymmetric states which are both stable.

For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this is equivalent to the conditions that the trace $\\text{Tr}(J)  0$ and the determinant $\\text{Det}(J)  0$. Here, $\\text{Tr}(J) = -2$, which is always negative. Therefore, stability depends only on the sign of the determinant:\n$$\n\\text{Det}(J) = (-1)(-1) - \\left(- \\dfrac{2 a y^{\\ast}}{\\left(1 + (y^{\\ast})^2\\right)^2}\\right) \\left(- \\dfrac{2 a x^{\\ast}}{\\left(1 + (x^{\\ast})^2\\right)^2}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4 a^2 x^{\\ast} y^{\\ast}}{\\left(1+(x^{\\ast})^2\\right)^2 \\left(1+(y^{\\ast})^2\\right)^2}  0\n$$\nNumerically, we compute the eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$, for each unique steady state. The state is classified as asymptotically stable if the maximum of their real parts is less than a negative tolerance:\n$$\n\\max \\{ \\Re(\\lambda_1), \\Re(\\lambda_2) \\} \\le - \\varepsilon_{\\text{stab}}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{\\text{stab}} = 10^{-8}$. This strict condition correctly identifies states with eigenvalues having zero real part (as occurs at a bifurcation) as not asymptotically stable.\n\nThis entire procedure—root-finding, clustering, and stability analysis—is executed for each test case specified: $a = 1.5$ (subcritical), $a = 3.0$ (supercritical), and $a = 2.0$ (critical bifurcation point). The final output for each case is the total count of distinct steady states, $N$, and the count of asymptotically stable steady states, $S$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and analyzes steady states for a genetic toggle switch model.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define numerical parameters from the problem statement\n    M = 31\n    EPS_RES = 1e-10\n    EPS_UNIQ = 1e-8\n    EPS_STAB = 1e-8\n\n    # Define the test cases (parameter 'a')\n    test_cases = [1.5, 3.0, 2.0]\n    \n    final_results = []\n\n    for a in test_cases:\n        # Define the system of equations for the root finder\n        # F(z) = 0, where z = [x, y]\n        def system_equations(z, a_param):\n            x, y = z\n            eq1 = a_param / (1 + y**2) - x\n            eq2 = a_param / (1 + x**2) - y\n            return [eq1, eq2]\n\n        # Define the Jacobian matrix function\n        def jacobian_matrix(z, a_param):\n            x, y = z\n            j12 = -2 * a_param * y / (1 + y**2)**2\n            j21 = -2 * a_param * x / (1 + x**2)**2\n            return np.array([[-1.0, j12], [j21, -1.0]])\n\n        # Generate the grid of initial guesses\n        search_domain = np.linspace(0, a, M)\n        initial_guesses = []\n        for x0 in search_domain:\n            for y0 in search_domain:\n                initial_guesses.append([x0, y0])\n\n        # --- Part 1: Find all potential steady states ---\n        found_solutions = []\n        for guess in initial_guesses:\n            # Use scipy's root finder\n            sol = root(system_equations, guess, args=(a,), method='hybr', tol=EPS_RES)\n            \n            # Check for convergence and validity\n            if sol.success:\n                solution_point = sol.x\n                # Check residual norm\n                residual_norm = np.linalg.norm(system_equations(solution_point, a))\n                # Check non-negativity\n                if residual_norm  EPS_RES and np.all(solution_point >= 0):\n                    found_solutions.append(solution_point)\n\n        # --- Part 2: Cluster solutions to find unique steady states ---\n        if not found_solutions:\n            unique_steady_states = []\n        else:\n            unique_steady_states = [found_solutions[0]]\n            for sol in found_solutions[1:]:\n                is_unique = True\n                for unique_sol in unique_steady_states:\n                    if np.linalg.norm(sol - unique_sol)  EPS_UNIQ:\n                        is_unique = False\n                        break\n                if is_unique:\n                    unique_steady_states.append(np.array(sol))\n        \n        num_distinct_states = len(unique_steady_states)\n        \n        # --- Part 3: Analyze stability of each unique steady state ---\n        num_stable_states = 0\n        for state in unique_steady_states:\n            # Compute the Jacobian at the steady state\n            J = jacobian_matrix(state, a)\n            \n            # Compute the eigenvalues\n            eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(J)\n            \n            # Check stability criterion\n            max_real_part = np.max(np.real(eigenvalues))\n            if max_real_part = -EPS_STAB:\n                num_stable_states += 1\n\n        final_results.append([num_distinct_states, num_stable_states])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The output from running this locally is [[1, 1], [3, 2], [1, 0]]\n    # It must be formatted as [[1,1],[3,2],[1,0]]\n    str_results = [str(res).replace(' ', '') for res in final_results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(str_results)}]\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2776770"}]}
