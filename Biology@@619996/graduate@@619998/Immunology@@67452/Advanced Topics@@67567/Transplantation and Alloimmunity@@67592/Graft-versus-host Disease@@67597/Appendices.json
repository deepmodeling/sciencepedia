This exercise explores the immunological basis for this phenomenon by focusing on minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs). By analyzing a classic case of a sex-mismatched transplant, you will practice identifying the specific class of antigens responsible, reinforcing the principle that donor T-cell recognition extends beyond the major HLA proteins to other polymorphic peptides presented by them [@problem_id:2232867].", "problem": "A 25-year-old male patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia undergoes a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedure to replace his cancerous bone marrow. The donor is his 23-year-old sister, who is identified as a perfect match for all classical Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I (A, B, C) and class II (DR, DQ) loci. Following the transplantation, the patient begins to show symptoms of skin rash, diarrhea, and liver dysfunction. These symptoms are diagnosed as a manifestation of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), an immunological complication where the transplanted donor immune cells (the graft) attack the patient's own tissues (the host). This reaction is understood to be mediated by differences in minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs), which are polymorphic peptides presented by the identical HLA molecules. Given the specific sex mismatch between the clinically-healthy donor and the patient, a particular class of mHAs is strongly implicated as the cause.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the class of mHAs most likely responsible for the GVHD in this specific scenario, and the chromosome on which their encoding genes are located?\n\nA.

H-Y antigens; X chromosome", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the immunological mechanism causing GVHD in an HLA-matched HSCT. GVHD occurs when donor T lymphocytes recognize recipient antigens as foreign when presented by shared HLA molecules. In HLA-identical transplants, this is typically mediated by minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs), which are polymorphic peptides derived from normal host proteins and presented by the identical HLA molecules.\n\nStep 2: Incorporate the key variable: sex mismatch with a female donor and male recipient. In this scenario, a well-established class of mHAs—H-Y antigens—becomes relevant. H-Y antigens are peptides derived from proteins encoded by genes on the Y chromosome. These peptides are expressed in male tissues and presented by HLA molecules.\n\nStep 3: Explain the tolerance and recognition basis. The female donor has not expressed Y chromosome-encoded proteins during thymic selection and therefore has not developed central tolerance to H-Y peptides. Consequently, donor-derived T cells can recognize H-Y peptides presented by the recipient’s HLA molecules as foreign, producing the observed GVHD manifestations (skin, gut, liver).\n\nStep 4: Exclude incorrect alternatives. \n- H-X antigens on the X chromosome (option A) are not the classical designation and do not explain the sex-mismatch-specific risk.\n- Autosomal mHAs on chromosome 6 (option C) are not specifically linked to sex mismatch; chromosome 6 encodes HLA, not a unique set of autosomal mHAs responsible for this pattern.\n- Mitochondrial mHAs (option D) are not the classical drivers in female-to-male GVHD scenarios.\n- H-Y antigens on the X chromosome (option E) is incorrect because H-Y antigens are encoded on the Y chromosome.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the above reasoning. The class of mHAs most likely implicated is H-Y antigens, and their genes are located on the Y chromosome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2232867"}, {"introduction": "Moving from molecular mechanisms to clinical practice, this problem challenges you to act as a consulting immunologist. You are presented with a complex patient case following an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and must synthesize clinical signs, laboratory data, and risk factors to form a unifying diagnosis.

The patient profile, treatment modalities, risk factors, clinical presentation, and laboratory values are all consistent with established medical science and pathophysiology. The scenario is realistic and based on factual principles of immunology and HSCT.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a detailed clinical vignette with sufficient data to allow for differential diagnosis based on the provided information. It explicitly lists negative findings to help narrow the possibilities. A unique, logical conclusion can be reached.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is objective and clinical. It presents data and observations without subjective interpretation or bias.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained and not missing critical information. Key risk factors (HLA mismatch, donor type, graft source) and clinical features (organ involvement, lab values, timeline) are all specified. Important differential diagnoses are addressed with relevant negative test results.\n5.  **Consistency**: There are no internal contradictions. The symptoms, signs, and laboratory data form a coherent clinical picture.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in clinical immunology. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires an explanation based on first principles of transplantation immunology. The core principle of graft-versus-host disease is allorecognition: mature T-lymphocytes from the donor graft recognize host tissues as foreign, leading to an immune-mediated attack.\n\n**First Principles Analysis:**\n1.  **Allorecognition and Risk Factors**: The patient received an allogeneic transplant, which is the fundamental prerequisite for GVHD. Several potent risk factors for GVHD are present:\n    - **HLA Mismatch**: A single HLA class I mismatch between an unrelated donor and recipient provides a strong antigenic stimulus for donor T-cells. Donor CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes recognize this mismatched class I molecule on host cells, a process called direct allorecognition.\n    - **Unrelated Donor**: Unrelated donors carry a higher risk of GVHD than matched related donors, due to more significant minor histocompatibility antigen disparities.\n    - **Graft Source**: Peripheral blood stem cells are rich in mature T-lymphocytes, significantly increasing the risk and severity of acute GVHD compared to bone marrow.\n    - **Conditioning Regimen**: Myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide causes extensive tissue damage, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-$\\alpha$, IL-$1$) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This \"cytokine storm\" primes the immune system and lowers the threshold for T-cell activation.\n    - **Prophylaxis Failure**: The patient's tacrolimus trough level is low (3.2 ng/mL). Typical target troughs for GVHD prophylaxis in the early post-transplant period are higher, often in the range of 5-15 ng/mL. A low level indicates sub-therapeutic immunosuppression, creating a \"breakthrough\" condition where donor T-cells are not adequately controlled.\n\n2.  **Effector Phase and Organ Tropism**: Once activated, donor T-cells orchestrate an attack on host tissues. The classical targets for acute GVHD are epithelial cells in the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the small bile ducts of the liver.\n    - **Timeline**: The onset on day $+28$ falls squarely within the classic window for *acute* GVHD, which is conventionally defined as occurring within the first 100 days post-transplant.\n    - **Skin Involvement**: The \"diffuse pruritic maculopapular rash over approximately 60% of body surface area\" is the pathognomonic skin manifestation of acute GVHD.\n    - **GI Involvement**: The \"watery diarrhea of 1.5 L/day with cramping\" is a hallmark of acute GVHD of the lower GI tract, resulting from cytotoxic T-cell-mediated damage to the intestinal crypts.\n    - **Liver Involvement**: The laboratory profile shows a cholestatic pattern of liver injury. The significantly elevated total bilirubin (6.2 mg/dL), with a high direct (conjugated) fraction (5.3 mg/dL), and a markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (480 U/L) with only mild transaminitis (ALT 88 U/L, AST 76 U/L), is the classic signature of hepatic acute GVHD. This reflects damage to the interlobular bile duct epithelium.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Other Possibilities**:\n    - **Infection**: The workup for common infectious mimics is negative (*C. difficile*, CMV in plasma, bacteremia).\n    - **Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS/VOD)**: This is a toxic liver injury from the conditioning regimen, typically occurring earlier (e.g., before day $+21$). The cardinal triad of SOS/VOD includes painful hepatomegaly, jaundice, and fluid retention (ascites, weight gain). The problem states the patient has *no* hepatomegaly and *no* ascites. This makes SOS/VOD highly unlikely.\n    - **Drug Toxicity**: The tacrolimus level is low, not toxic. A new drug-induced liver injury (DILI) or rash is unlikely, as no new relevant medications were started.\n\n**Conclusion based on First Principles**: The constellation of risk factors (HLA-mismatched unrelated donor, PBSC graft), the timing of onset (day $+28$), the sub-therapeutic immunosuppression (low tacrolimus), and the specific clinical syndrome involving the classic triad of target organs (skin, GI tract, liver with cholestatic injury) makes acute GVHD the most compelling and unifying diagnosis.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Acute graft-versus-host disease is the unifying diagnosis, given early post-transplant onset, the classic triad of target organs (skin, gastrointestinal tract, and cholestatic liver injury), and potentiating risk factors that favor donor T-cell alloreactivity.**\nThis statement is perfectly consistent with the analysis derived from first principles. The onset is correct for acute GVHD. The organ involvement is the classic triad. The liver injury pattern is correctly identified as cholestatic. The underlying mechanism of donor T-cell alloreactivity is correctly invoked, and the provided scenario is rich with the potentiating risk factors mentioned.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Chronic graft-versus-host disease is more likely, because cholestatic jaundice is a hallmark and chronic graft-versus-host disease commonly presents with watery diarrhea during the first 30 days.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The classical timeline for chronic GVHD is an onset after day $+100$. While overlap syndromes exist, a presentation at day $+28$ with features typical of acute inflammation is, by definition, acute GVHD. The claim that chronic GVHD \"commonly presents with watery diarrhea during the first 30 days\" is factually wrong; this presentation is characteristic of acute GVHD.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) best explains the picture, because it typically presents at day $+28$ with isolated cholestasis but can also produce a diffuse rash and high-volume diarrhea.**\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors. First, the clinical signs for SOS/VOD (painful hepatomegaly, ascites) are explicitly absent. Second, the typical onset of SOS/VOD is earlier than day $+28$. Third, SOS/VOD does *not* cause a diffuse maculopapular rash or high-volume secretory diarrhea. The pathophysiology is sinusoidal endothelial damage and obstruction, not an immune attack on skin and gut epithelium.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity is the most probable cause, because low tacrolimus troughs directly cause secretory diarrhea, diffuse morbilliform rash, and cholestatic liver injury in the early post-transplant period.**\nThis statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of pharmacology and immunology. Toxicity is caused by high drug levels, not low ones. The patient's tacrolimus level is low (3.2 ng/mL). A low level signifies inadequate immunosuppression, which is a *cause* of GVHD, not a direct cause of the symptoms themselves via a toxicity mechanism. The logic is inverted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Concomitant cytomegalovirus colitis plus drug-induced liver injury is most likely, because these together explain diarrhea and cholestatic jaundice, and cytomegalovirus commonly causes a diffuse maculopapular rash early after transplant even when plasma polymerase chain reaction is negative.**\nThis option is less likely for several reasons. It requires two separate pathologies to explain what a single diagnosis (acute GVHD) explains perfectly (Occam's razor). Plasma CMV PCR is a sensitive test for CMV reactivation, and its negative result makes active CMV disease less probable, although tissue-invasive disease cannot be ruled out completely without biopsy. Furthermore, a diffuse maculopapular rash is not a common feature of CMV colitis. Finally, invoking DILI without an offending agent is speculative. Acute GVHD provides a more parsimonious and better-supported explanation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2850995"}, {"introduction": "The final practice takes you to the cutting edge of GVHD research, where understanding disease pathogenesis relies on dissecting complex, high-dimensional data.

It is a well-constructed question that tests the understanding of a complex, multi-modal data analysis workflow in a real-world biomedical context. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option evaluation.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles and Requirements**\n\nA correct analytical pipeline must systematically address the stated principles and requirements.\n\n1.  **Addressing Technical Variation (Requirement 1):** The presence of batch effects necessitates stringent data preprocessing. This includes quality control (QC) to remove low-quality cells (e.g., high mitochondrial content, low gene counts) and cell doublets. Following QC, data must be normalized to account for sequencing depth differences. Crucially, an integration or batch correction algorithm must be applied to merge datasets from different runs and donors, designed specifically to remove technical noise while preserving true biological variation between conditions (lesion vs. blood).\n\n2.  **Leveraging Paired Data (Principles 2 and 3):** The paired scRNA-seq and TCR-seq data are central. The analysis must link the gene expression profile of each T cell to its clonotype. It must then identify clonotypes that are expanded (Principle 2) and test whether these expanded clonotypes are statistically enriched in the disease tissue (lesion) compared to the periphery (blood) (Principle 3). This step is critical for pinpointing the putative disease-causing cells.\n\n3.  **Controlling for Heterogeneity (Requirement 2):** Data from multiple donors will have significant inter-individual variation. Any statistical comparison, such as differential expression or clonotype enrichment testing, must explicitly account for this. This is typically achieved by using a mixed-effects statistical model where ‘donor’ is included as a random effect, or by performing stratified analyses within each donor. Pooling data naively across donors is a severe statistical error.\n\n4.  **Identifying Pathogenic Signatures and Targets (Objective & Requirement 3):** To understand what makes the pathogenic cells destructive, one must perform differential expression analysis comparing the lesion-enriched, expanded T cell clonotypes against appropriate control populations (e.g., non-expanded cells in the lesion, or clonotypes in the blood). The results of this analysis must then be interpreted for biological mechanism (e.g., cytotoxicity, inflammatory signaling via gene set enrichment analysis) and for druggability (Requirement 3). This involves analyzing cell-cell communication via ligand-receptor inference and cross-referencing candidate genes/proteins with databases of known druggable targets. Statistical rigor, such as controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), is mandatory.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Perform stringent quality control to remove low-complexity cells, high mitochondrial ribonucleic acid cells, and doublets; normalize counts and correct for batch effects across donors and runs using integration that preserves lesion-specific signals; subset T cells based on canonical markers such as CD3E and TRAC, then recluster T cells and annotate subsets using well-validated markers (for example, cytotoxic effectors by GZMB, PRF1; regulatory T cells by FOXP3; interferon-gamma responsive states by interferon-gamma gene sets). Jointly analyze TCR data to identify expanded clonotypes and test for enrichment of clonotypes in lesion versus blood using appropriate count models or Fisher’s exact tests with donor-aware stratification. Perform differential expression between lesion-enriched expanded clonotypes and bystander or naive T cells while modeling donor as a random effect, then conduct gene set enrichment for cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma response, infer trajectories from naive to effector states, and run transcription factor regulon analysis to implicate key regulators. Infer ligand-receptor interactions between infiltrating T cells and tissue-resident cells with expression thresholds to avoid spurious pairs, prioritizing chemokines and cytokines such as CXCL9 or CXCL10–CXCR3 and IL-15–IL-2RB if supported by expression. Nominate drug targets by intersecting upregulated, clonotype-enriched genes and high-scoring ligands/receptors with a curated druggable genome and perturbational databases (for example, Connectivity Map), controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at level $\\alpha$ and requiring effect sizes above a predefined threshold; cross-validate against independent GVHD datasets if available.**\n\nThis option describes a comprehensive and methodologically sound pipeline. It correctly implements (1) stringent QC and advanced batch correction, (2) robust identification of pathogenic clonotypes using paired TCR data and donor-aware statistics, (3) proper differential expression analysis controlling for donor effects, and (4) a multi-pronged approach to functional analysis and druggable target nomination that is both data-driven and mechanistically plausible. Every step aligns with the principles and requirements of the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. To avoid noise, regress out highly variable genes including cytokines and TCR genes prior to dimensionality reduction; cluster all cells from lesion and blood together without batch correction; annotate clusters solely by unsupervised features; identify the top mean-expressed genes in any cluster and input this list into a perturbational signature resource to select drugs; do not incorporate clonotype information; to remove confounding, regress out activation and cell cycle signals before differential expression; perform differential expression by comparing positions along t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) axes without modeling donor.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Regressing out cytokines and TCR genes removes the primary biological signal of interest. Ignoring batch correction when it is known to exist is unacceptable. Discarding clonotype information negates the power of the experimental design. Regressing out activation signals is illogical when studying an activation-driven disease. Using t-SNE coordinates for differential expression is a profound misunderstanding of the algorithm. Failing to model donor effects invalidates the statistical comparisons.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Conduct basic quality control and normalization, then cluster and annotate T cells; identify differentially expressed genes by comparing all lesion T cells pooled together versus all blood T cells pooled together; run ligand-receptor inference and select any ligand with a statistically significant $p$-value as a therapeutic target; propose blocking programmed cell death protein one (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand one (PD-L1) to restore tolerance because these molecules are immune checkpoints; ignore clonotype information and donor effects to keep the model simple.**\n\nThis option is naive and statistically invalid. It explicitly ignores donor effects and clonotype information, which are critical for a correct analysis. Pooling all lesion cells versus all blood cells dilutes the signal from the truly pathogenic minority and leads to spurious findings. Selecting targets based only on a $p$-value without considering effect size or druggability is poor practice. Proposing PD-1 blockade is a pre-conceived hypothesis, not a data-driven conclusion from the proposed pipeline. Simplicity at the cost of validity is not a virtue in science.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. After quality control, normalization, and integration, subset T cells and compute pseudotime trajectories; define genes that increase along pseudotime as drivers of pathogenicity and target them directly; assume all inferred transcription factors are druggable and prioritize these as therapeutic candidates; do not perform ligand-receptor inference or cross-reference with druggability resources; omit clonotype expansion analysis to avoid bias from unequal sequencing depth.**\n\nThis option makes several critical errors. While pseudotime can be a useful exploratory tool, equating correlation with pseudotime to causal “driver” status is an oversimplification. The assumption that all transcription factors are druggable is factually incorrect; they are a notoriously difficult target class. Omitting clonotype analysis—the key to identifying antigen-specific responses—is a major failure to utilize the provided data, and the justification (avoiding bias) is weak, as methods exist to handle such biases. Ignoring ligand-receptor inference and druggability checks violates the core objective of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only one that describes a scientifically rigorous, statistically valid, and comprehensive workflow capable of achieving the stated objectives. The other options contain severe methodological flaws that would invalidate their conclusions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2850964"}]}
