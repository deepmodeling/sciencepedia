It utilizes the internationally standardized Banff classification for allograft pathology, a cornerstone of diagnosis and research in transplantation. The provided clinical scenario and histopathological scores represent a realistic and frequently encountered case in clinical practice. The language is precise and objective. The question is well-posed, providing all necessary information (histology scores, serology, and $C4d$ status) to arrive at a diagnosis using the Banff criteria. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A definitive solution can be derived by applying the Banff classification diagnostic criteria.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine the most accurate rejection phenotype by systematically evaluating the provided data against the formal Banff criteria for T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR).\n\n**1. Assessment for T-cell–mediated Rejection (TCMR)**\nThe diagnosis of acute TCMR relies on evidence of inflammation in the tubulointerstitium and arteries.\n-   **Acute TCMR Grade IA**: Requires significant interstitial inflammation ($i=2$ or $i=3$) and moderate tubulitis ($t=2$).\n    -   The given scores are $i=2$ and $t=2$.\n    -   These scores precisely meet the criteria for Acute TCMR, Grade IA.\n-   **Acute TCMR Grade IB**: Requires significant interstitial inflammation ($i=2$ or $i=3$) and severe tubulitis ($t=3$). This is not met.\n-   **Acute TCMR Grades II and III**: Require evidence of intimal arteritis ($v>0$).\n    -   The given score is $v=0$.\n    -   Therefore, higher grades of TCMR are excluded.\n\nBased on the scores $i=2$ and $t=2$, there is a clear diagnosis of **Acute TCMR, Grade IA**.\n\n**2. Assessment for Antibody-mediated Rejection (ABMR)**\nThe diagnosis of active ABMR requires that three criteria are met simultaneously:\n\n-   **Criterion 1: Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury.**\n    This includes one or more of the following:\n    -   Microvascular inflammation, defined as a sum of glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis scores $(g + ptc) \\geq 2$.\n    -   Intimal or transmural arteritis ($v > 0$).\n    -   Acute thrombotic microangiopathy.\n    In this case, the scores are $g=1$ and $ptc=2$. The sum is $g + ptc = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n    Since $3 \\geq 2$, the criterion for significant microvascular inflammation is met.\n\n-   **Criterion 2: Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium.**\n    This includes one or more of the following:\n    -   Linear $C4d$ staining in peritubular capillaries.\n    -   At least moderate microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc \\geq 2$), in the absence of C4d positivity.\n    -   Increased expression of gene transcripts indicative of endothelial injury (not provided, but not essential given the other findings).\n    The problem states that $C4d$ staining is negative. However, the microvascular inflammation score is $g+ptc=3$, which is $\\geq 2$. According to the Banff criteria, this level of inflammation is sufficient to meet Criterion 2 even when $C4d$ is negative. This is the definition of **$C4d$-negative ABMR**.\n\n-   **Criterion 3: Serologic evidence of circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA).**\n    The problem explicitly states that HLA class II DSAs are detected. This criterion is met.\n\nSince all three criteria are satisfied, there is a concurrent diagnosis of **Active Antibody-Mediated Rejection, $C4d$-negative**.\n\n**3. Assessment for Chronic Rejection**\nThe diagnosis of chronic active ABMR requires evidence of chronic tissue injury, primarily transplant glomerulopathy (TG), which is defined pathologically by glomerular basement membrane duplication (double contours), scored as $cg > 0$.\n-   The problem explicitly states there are \"no chronic glomerular double contours on light microscopy and no electron microscopic evidence of duplicated glomerular basement membranes\" and \"no other chronic scarring scores are elevated.\"\n-   This means $cg=0$ and other chronicity scores are absent.\n-   Therefore, a diagnosis of chronic active ABMR is excluded. The process is entirely active.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe recipient's biopsy fulfills the diagnostic criteria for both Acute TCMR, Grade IA, and Active ABMR, $C4d$-negative. When criteria for both rejection types are met in the same specimen, the diagnosis is **Mixed Rejection**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Acute T-cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), Banff grade IA, only**: **Incorrect**. This diagnosis is incomplete. While the criteria for TCMR are met, this option ignores the compelling evidence for concurrent ABMR: significant microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc=3$) in the presence of DSA.\n-   **B. Active antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), C4d-negative, only**: **Incorrect**. This diagnosis is also incomplete. While the criteria for active $C4d$-negative ABMR are met, this option ignores the tubulointerstitial inflammation ($i=2$, $t=2$) that is diagnostic of TCMR Grade IA.\n-   **C. Mixed rejection: acute T-cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) Banff grade IA and active antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), C4d-negative**: **Correct**. This is the most accurate and complete diagnosis, as it accounts for all the provided histopathological and serological findings. The biopsy shows clear, independent evidence for both cellular and humoral rejection pathways occurring simultaneously.\n-   **D. Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR)**: **Incorrect**. The problem explicitly states the absence of chronic changes, particularly the lack of glomerular basement membrane duplication ($cg = 0$), which is a hallmark of chronic ABMR.\n-   **E. No rejection; borderline or nonspecific changes only**: **Incorrect**. The histopathological scores are not borderline. The combination of $i=2$ and $t=2$ is diagnostic for TCMR Grade IA. The combination of $g=1$, $ptc=2$, and positive DSA is diagnostic for active ABMR.

This problem moves from diagnosis to mechanism, asking you to explain the fundamental biochemistry that makes $C4d$ a stable marker of complement activation and, crucially, the immunological pathways that allow antibody-mediated rejection to proceed without it. A deep understanding of these principles is essential for a nuanced interpretation of complex cases and for appreciating the full spectrum of humoral rejection [@problem_id:2850482].", "problem": "A renal allograft biopsy obtained for persistent graft dysfunction shows diffuse glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis consistent with microvascular inflammation. Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against human leukocyte antigen class II are detected in the recipient serum. However, staining for complement fragment $C4d$ in peritubular capillaries is negative by both immunofluorescence and paraffin immunohistochemistry. Using first principles of complement biology and antibody effector mechanisms, select the option that most accurately integrates: (i) the biochemical basis for why $C4d$ deposition is interpreted as a stable footprint of prior classical pathway activation on endothelium, and (ii) immunologically sound circumstances in which antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) can be driven by DSA yet be $C4d$-negative in the graft.\n\nA. $C4d$ persists because classical pathway activation by antigen-bound immunoglobulin exposes a reactive internal thioester in $C4b$, allowing covalent linkage to endothelial nucleophiles; subsequent cleavage by factor I yields surface-bound $C4d$, which is chemically inert and stable. ABMR may be $C4d$-negative when DSA are predominantly non–complement-fixing isotypes (for example, IgG4) or when Fc is insufficiently clustered to recruit $C1q$, shifting injury toward Fc gamma receptor–mediated endothelial activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity without substantial classical pathway activation.\n\nB. $C4d$ persists because it binds ionically to negatively charged glycocalyx and is retained until complement is fully consumed; ABMR may be $C4d$-negative when terminal pathway is blocked by CD59, which prevents $C4d$ generation even if upstream classical pathway is engaged.\n\nC. $C4d$ is a specific product of the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase and therefore reports alternative pathway activation; ABMR may be $C4d$-negative in lectin pathway–dominant responses because mannan-binding lectin activation does not generate $C4d$.\n\nD. $C4d$ positivity indicates ongoing membrane attack complex–mediated lysis, so absence of $C4d$ excludes antibody as the mediator; the observed microvascular inflammation with DSA must reflect T cell–mediated rejection rather than ABMR.", "solution": "The problem statement is forwarded for validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Core pathology: Renal allograft biopsy for persistent graft dysfunction.\n- Histopathological findings: Diffuse glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis, consistent with microvascular inflammation.\n- Serological findings: Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II are detected.\n- Complement staining: Staining for complement fragment $C4d$ in peritubular capillaries is negative, verified by both immunofluorescence and paraffin immunohistochemistry.\n- Question: Select the option that integrates (i) the biochemical basis for $C4d$ as a stable marker of classical complement pathway activation and (ii) the immunological circumstances for DSA-driven, $C4d$-negative antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a recognized and clinically significant scenario in transplant immunology: $C4d$-negative antibody-mediated rejection. All terms used—renal allograft, DSA, HLA, $C4d$, glomerulitis, capillaritis—are standard and well-defined in the field. The premise is based on established, not speculative, immunological and pathological principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The question is structured to elicit a specific, integrated explanation based on fundamental principles. It presents a clear set of findings and asks for the underlying mechanisms. A unique, correct answer exists within modern immunology.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical. The findings are presented as facts (\"shows...\", \"are detected...\", \"is negative...\"). There is no subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary information to deduce the answer. The combination of microvascular inflammation, DSA presence, and $C4d$ negativity is a consistent, albeit complex, clinical picture that points toward specific pathophysiological mechanisms. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem in immunology. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe problem requires an explanation of two interconnected phenomena: the nature of $C4d$ deposition and the mechanism of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in its absence.\n\n**(i) Biochemical Basis for $C4d$ as a Stable Footprint:**\nThe classical complement pathway is initiated when the $C1$ complex, specifically its $C1q$ subunit, binds to the Fc regions of antigen-bound antibodies, typically of the IgM or IgG (subclasses IgG1 and IgG3) isotype. In this context, the antigen is donor HLA on the allograft endothelium. This binding activates the serine proteases $C1r$ and $C1s$. Activated $C1s$ cleaves its substrates, $C4$ and $C2$.\n\nThe cleavage of $C4$ into $C4a$ (an anaphylatoxin) and $C4b$ is the critical event. Within the native $C4$ molecule, there exists a shielded internal thioester bond. Upon cleavage and conformational change into $C4b$, this thioester bond becomes exposed and highly reactive. It can readily form a covalent bond (an ester or amide linkage) with hydroxyl or amino groups on molecules of the nearby cell surface. This covalent attachment anchors $C4b$ to the site of complement activation, in this case, the endothelial cell membrane.\n\nSurface-bound $C4b$ is a substrate for the regulatory protease, Factor I. Factor I, with cofactors, cleaves $C4b$ into two fragments: the soluble $C4c$ and the small, surface-bound $C4d$ fragment. The original covalent bond formed by the thioester group is retained within the $C4d$ fragment. Because $C4d$ is biochemically inert and resistant to further proteolysis, and because it is covalently bound to the tissue, it persists for an extended period (days to weeks). It thus serves as a stable, historical marker—a \"footprint\" or \"scar\"—of prior classical (or lectin) pathway activation, even if the initial insult has resolved.\n\n**(ii) Immunological Basis for $C4d$-Negative ABMR:**\nThe diagnosis of ABMR hinges on evidence of antibody-mediated damage. The presence of DSA and corresponding microvascular inflammation are key criteria. The question is how this can occur without leaving the $C4d$ footprint. This implies that either the complement cascade is not activated, or it is activated in a manner that does not lead to significant $C4d$ deposition.\n\n1.  **Non-Complement-Fixing Antibodies:** The ability to activate the classical complement pathway is isotype- and subclass-dependent. While IgM, IgG1, and IgG3 are potent activators, other immunoglobulin subclasses are not. Specifically, IgG4 and, to a lesser extent, IgG2 are poor activators of the $C1q$-dependent classical pathway. If the recipient's DSA response is dominated by these non-complement-fixing isotypes, the antibodies will bind to donor HLA on the endothelium but fail to recruit $C1q$ and initiate the cascade.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Fc Clustering:** Activation of $C1q$ by IgG requires binding to at least two Fc domains in close proximity. If the density of the target HLA antigens on the endothelium is low, or if the titer of DSA is low, the bound IgG molecules may be too sparsely distributed to allow for the stable, multivalent binding of a $C1q$ molecule. This would prevent efficient classical pathway activation.\n\n3.  **Complement-Independent Effector Mechanisms:** In the absence of complement activation, DSA can still mediate endothelial injury through other pathways. The primary mechanism involves the engagement of Fc receptors on immune cells.\n    -   **Fc Gamma Receptor (FcγR) Engagement:** Infiltrating leukocytes, such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, express FcγRs. These receptors bind to the Fc portion of the DSA coating the endothelial cells.\n    -   **Endothelial Activation:** This binding can directly activate the endothelial cells, causing them to upregulate adhesion molecules, release chemokines, and adopt a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic phenotype. This leads to the recruitment of more inflammatory cells, creating the observed glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis.\n    -   **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC):** Effector cells, particularly NK cells, can be triggered via their FcγRs to release cytotoxic granules (e.g., perforin and granzymes), killing the antibody-coated endothelial cells.\n\nIn summary, $C4d$-negative ABMR occurs when DSA cause graft injury primarily through cellular mechanisms like ADCC and FcγR-mediated inflammation, rather than through the classical complement cascade. This is often associated with DSA isotypes that do not fix complement effectively.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $C4d$ persists because classical pathway activation by antigen-bound immunoglobulin exposes a reactive internal thioester in $C4b$, allowing covalent linkage to endothelial nucleophiles; subsequent cleavage by factor I yields surface-bound $C4d$, which is chemically inert and stable. ABMR may be $C4d$-negative when DSA are predominantly non–complement-fixing isotypes (for example, IgG4) or when Fc is insufficiently clustered to recruit $C1q$, shifting injury toward Fc gamma receptor–mediated endothelial activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity without substantial classical pathway activation.**\nThis option correctly describes the biochemistry of $C4d$ deposition, highlighting the critical role of the thioester bond in $C4b$, covalent linkage, and subsequent cleavage by Factor I. It also correctly identifies the primary mechanisms of $C4d$-negative ABMR: the involvement of non-complement-fixing antibody isotypes (like IgG4) and the shift towards complement-independent effector functions such as FcγR-mediated inflammation and ADCC. The explanation is comprehensive and accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $C4d$ persists because it binds ionically to negatively charged glycocalyx and is retained until complement is fully consumed; ABMR may be $C4d$-negative when terminal pathway is blocked by CD59, which prevents $C4d$ generation even if upstream classical pathway is engaged.**\nThis option contains two major errors. First, $C4d$ persistence is due to *covalent* bonding, not weak ionic interactions. This covalent linkage is the basis of its stability as a diagnostic marker. Second, CD59 is a regulator of the *terminal* complement pathway, blocking the formation of the $C5b-9$ membrane attack complex. The generation of $C4d$ occurs far *upstream* in the cascade. A block by CD59 would have no effect on whether $C4d$ is deposited.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $C4d$ is a specific product of the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase and therefore reports alternative pathway activation; ABMR may be $C4d$-negative in lectin pathway–dominant responses because mannan-binding lectin activation does not generate $C4d$.**\nThis option fundamentally mischaracterizes the complement pathways. $C4d$ is a product of the classical and lectin pathways, both of which utilize $C4$. The alternative pathway does *not* involve $C4$ and its $C3$ convertase is $C3bBb$. Therefore, $C4d$ is specifically *not* a marker of the alternative pathway. The second clause is also false; the lectin pathway protease MASP-2 cleaves $C4$, and thus its activation *does* lead to $C4d$ deposition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $C4d$ positivity indicates ongoing membrane attack complex–mediated lysis, so absence of $C4d$ excludes antibody as the mediator; the observed microvascular inflammation with DSA must reflect T cell–mediated rejection rather than ABMR.**\nThis option is incorrect on several points. First, $C4d$ indicates *upstream* pathway activation, not necessarily ongoing terminal lysis by the membrane attack complex. Second, and more critically, the absence of $C4d$ does *not* exclude antibody as the mediator. This contradicts the well-established existence of $C4d$-negative ABMR. Given the presence of DSA and classic microvascular inflammation, an antibody-mediated process is strongly implicated, even without a $C4d$ signal. Attributing these findings exclusively to T cell–mediated rejection is a diagnostic error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2850482"}, {"introduction": "While acute rejection is a major concern in the early post-transplant period, chronic rejection is the leading cause of late graft failure.

The provided immunological principles accurately reflect the current understanding and diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection as defined by the Banff consensus conferences. The data are internally consistent and sufficient to formulate a differential diagnosis and determine the logical next steps for confirmation. The problem requires the application of established principles to a realistic clinical case, which is a valid scientific exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe patient's presentation $3$ years post-transplantation with a gradual rise in creatinine and new proteinuria is characteristic of a chronic process. We must systematically analyze the findings in the context of the Banff classification for allograft rejection.\n\nThe diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) requires meeting several criteria. For active ABMR, these are:\n1.  Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury, such as microvascular inflammation (glomerulitis $[g]$ and/or peritubular capillaritis $[ptc]$), and/or intimal or transmural arteritis ($v$).\n2.  Evidence of recent or current antibody interaction with the vascular endothelium. This can be met by either: (a) linear $C4d$ staining in peritubular capillaries; or (b) moderate microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc \\ge 2$); or (c) increased expression of validated endothelial-associated gene transcripts.\n3.  Serological evidence of circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA).\n\nThe diagnosis of **chronic active** ABMR (caABMR) requires evidence of both chronic injury and ongoing active rejection. This involves:\n1.  Morphological evidence of chronic endothelial injury, most commonly transplant glomerulopathy ($cg$) or severe peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering ($ptcml$).\n2.  All criteria for active ABMR as listed above.\n\nLet us apply these criteria to the patient's data:\n- **DSA Presence (Criterion 3)**: The patient has persistent anti-HLA-DQ DSA. This criterion is met.\n- **Antibody-Endothelium Interaction (Criterion 2)**:\n    - $C4d$ staining is negative. So, criterion 2a is not met.\n    - Microvascular inflammation is present with a score of $g=2$ and $ptc=1$. The sum $g+ptc = 3$, which is $\\ge 2$. This meets criterion 2b for active, $C4d$-negative ABMR.\n- **Evidence of Chronic Injury (caABMR Criterion 1)**: Light microscopy suggests early transplant glomerulopathy (GBM duplication), but this is not definitive. The pathologist correctly states that electron microscopy is required to confirm this finding, which is the gold standard for identifying the ultrastructural changes of $cg$, specifically GBM double contours.\n\n**Synthesis**: The patient has definitive evidence for DSA and active, $C4d$-negative microvascular inflammation. This strongly supports a diagnosis of an active antibody-mediated process. The clinical timeline ($3$ years post-transplant, insidious onset) and the suspicion of $cg$ on light microscopy strongly point toward a **chronic active ABMR (caABMR)**. However, the diagnosis remains presumptive until the chronic component (the $cg$ lesion) is definitively established. Therefore, the logical next step is to obtain the evidence needed to confirm the chronic injury.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $C4d$ negativity excludes antibody-mediated rejection; this is unlikely to be ABMR. Evaluate for T cell–mediated rejection with granzyme B immunohistochemistry as the principal confirmatory test.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A central tenet of modern transplant immunology, and a principle explicitly stated in the problem, is the existence of $C4d$-negative ABMR. The presence of significant microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc=3$) in the presence of DSA is strong evidence *for* ABMR, not against it. Furthermore, evidence for T cell–mediated rejection is minimal ($i$ and $t$ scores are minimal, $v=0$), making it an unlikely primary diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The findings are most consistent with chronic active ABMR if ultrastructural or molecular evidence of chronic endothelial injury is demonstrated; proceed with electron microscopy to detect early glomerular basement membrane double-contours, obtain an endothelial-associated gene expression profile (for example, a validated Molecular Microscope Diagnostic System transcript signature), and perform functional DSA assays (for example, $C1q$ or $C3d$-binding) as supportive evidence.**\nThis option correctly identifies the most likely diagnosis: chronic active ABMR. It accurately states that confirmation hinges on demonstrating chronic endothelial injury. The proposed next steps are entirely appropriate and reflect the state-of-the-art in diagnosis:\n- **Electron microscopy (EM)**: This is the gold standard to confirm transplant glomerulopathy ($cg > 0$), which would satisfy the chronicity criterion for caABMR.\n- **Molecular diagnostics (gene expression profiling)**: The Molecular Microscope can provide an independent, quantitative measure of endothelial activation and injury, which can substitute for or supplement the histological criteria for ABMR in complex or $C4d$-negative cases.\n- **Functional DSA assays**: Assessing the complement-binding capacity of DSA (e.g., $C1q$ or $C3d$-binding assays) provides valuable prognostic information and corroborates the pathogenic potential of the detected antibodies, although it is not a primary diagnostic criterion.\nThis option provides a complete and correct diagnostic and management plan.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The process must be acute ABMR because microvascular inflammation signifies acuteness; require $C4d$ positivity on repeat staining to confirm and no further chronicity assessment is necessary.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, microvascular inflammation signifies an *active* process, which can occur in either an acute or chronic setting (i.e., chronic *active* ABMR). Given the $3$-year timeline and suspicion of $cg$, a purely \"acute\" process is less likely. Second, demanding $C4d$ positivity is incorrect, as $C4d$-negative ABMR is well-established. Third, ignoring the need to assess for chronicity is a serious oversight in a patient $3$ years post-transplant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The changes are most consistent with calcineurin inhibitor toxicity; confirm by measuring trough drug levels and attributing the microvascular inflammation to drug effect despite negative $C4d$.**\nThis is inconsistent with the presented evidence. The classic histopathology of CNI toxicity includes arteriolar hyalinosis, isometric tubular vacuolization, and striped interstitial fibrosis, not the prominent glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis seen here. While CNI toxicity can cause a thrombotic microangiopathy in some cases, this presentation with existing DSA makes ABMR a far more probable cause of the MVI. The problem also states that CNI levels are within the target range, making overt toxicity less likely.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. This represents non-human leukocyte antigen autoantibody–mediated vasculopathy; confirm by testing for anti–angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies alone, which is sufficient to establish the diagnosis in the setting of $C4d$ negativity.**\nWhile non-HLA antibodies (such as those against the angiotensin II type $1$ receptor, AT1R) are a recognized cause of rejection, it is illogical to invoke them as the primary explanation when classic anti-HLA DSA are already detected. The principle of parsimony dictates that the present anti-HLA-DQ DSA are the most likely cause of the observed pathology. Investigating non-HLA antibodies is typically reserved for cases of suspected ABMR where HLA-DSA are absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2850407"}]}
