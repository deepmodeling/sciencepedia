For any other value of $k$, this condition is not met unless $T=0$.\n\nThe problem specifically directs us to analyze the stability of the tumor-free equilibrium, which is $(T^*, E^*) = (0, \\frac{s}{\\delta})$. To assess its local stability, we linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix, $J$, at this point. The system functions are $f(T, E) = rT - kET$ and $g(T, E) = s - \\delta E$. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n$$\nJ(T, E) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - kE & -kT \\\\ 0 & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the tumor-free equilibrium $(0, \\frac{s}{\\delta})$:\n$$\nJ\\left(0, \\frac{s}{\\delta}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - k\\left(\\frac{s}{\\delta}\\right) & -k(0) \\\\ 0 & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{ks}{\\delta} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting matrix is upper triangular. The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the system at the tumor-free equilibrium are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = r - \\frac{ks}{\\delta}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = -\\delta\n$$\nAn equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable if and only if the real parts of all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at that point are negative.\nWe are given that $\\delta > 0$, which means $\\lambda_2 = -\\delta$ is always negative. Consequently, the stability of the tumor-free equilibrium is entirely determined by the sign of $\\lambda_1$.\n\nFor local asymptotic stability, we require $\\lambda_1 < 0$:\n$$\nr - \\frac{ks}{\\delta} < 0\n$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $k$, we get:\n$$\nr < \\frac{ks}{\\delta}\n$$\nGiven that $s>0$ and $\\delta>0$, we can multiply both sides by $\\frac{\\delta}{s}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{r\\delta}{s} < k\n$$\nThus, the tumor-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if $k > \\frac{r\\delta}{s}$. Conversely, the equilibrium is unstable if $\\lambda_1 > 0$, which occurs when $k < \\frac{r\\delta}{s}$.\n\nThe problem defines the critical cytotoxic efficacy, $k_c$, as the value such that the tumor-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable for $k > k_c$ and unstable for $k < k_c$. Our analysis shows that this transition occurs precisely at the point where the inequality flips. This defines the critical value $k_c$.\nTherefore, the critical cytotoxic efficacy is:\n$$\nk_c = \\frac{r\\delta}{s}\n$$\nThis expression represents the threshold for the killing efficacy of effector cells. If the efficacy $k$ is above this threshold, the immune system can control the tumor and drive it to extinction. If $k$ is below this threshold, the tumor's intrinsic growth rate outpaces the immune-mediated killing, leading to uncontrolled growth.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{r\\delta}{s}}\n$$", "id": "2887337"}]}
