The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or scientifically implausible data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe probability of a response for a patient with a vector of biomarkers $\\mathbf{x}$ is denoted by $p(\\mathbf{x})$. The odds of response are defined as the ratio of the probability of response to the probability of non-response:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{p(\\mathbf{x})}{1 - p(\\mathbf{x})}\n$$\nThe logistic regression model uses the logit link function, which is the natural logarithm of the odds (the log-odds):\n$$\n\\operatorname{logit}(p(\\mathbf{x})) = \\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}))\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, the model is given by:\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x})) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\,\\frac{\\text{CPS}}{10} + \\beta_{2}\\,\\frac{\\text{TMB}}{5} + \\beta_{3}\\,\\frac{\\text{TIL}}{10}\n$$\nThe composite biomarker score $S(\\mathbf{x})$ is defined as the linear predictor without the intercept:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = \\beta_{1}\\,\\frac{\\text{CPS}}{10} + \\beta_{2}\\,\\frac{\\text{TMB}}{5} + \\beta_{3}\\,\\frac{\\text{TIL}}{10}\n$$\nThus, the log-odds for any patient can be written compactly as:\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x})) = \\beta_{0} + S(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nThe odds ratio (OR) for Patient A (with biomarker vector $\\mathbf{x}_A$) relative to Patient B (with biomarker vector $\\mathbf{x}_B$) is the ratio of their respective odds:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_A)}{\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_B)}\n$$\nTo derive the expression for the OR, we first consider the log-odds for each patient:\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_A)) = \\beta_{0} + S(\\mathbf{x}_A)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_B)) = \\beta_{0} + S(\\mathbf{x}_B)\n$$\nSubtracting the log-odds of Patient B from that of Patient A gives the natural logarithm of the odds ratio:\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_A)) - \\ln(\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_B)) = (\\beta_{0} + S(\\mathbf{x}_A)) - (\\beta_{0} + S(\\mathbf{x}_B))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_A)}{\\text{Odds}(\\mathbf{x}_B)}\\right) = S(\\mathbf{x}_A) - S(\\mathbf{x}_B)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{OR}) = S(\\mathbf{x}_A) - S(\\mathbf{x}_B)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the desired expression for the odds ratio in terms of the composite biomarker scores:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\exp(S(\\mathbf{x}_A) - S(\\mathbf{x}_B))\n$$\nThis derivation is complete. Now, we compute the numerical value. First, we calculate the composite biomarker scores for Patient A and Patient B using the given coefficients $\\beta_{1}=0.35$, $\\beta_{2}=0.50$, and $\\beta_{3}=0.40$.\n\nFor Patient A, with $\\text{CPS}_A = 20$, $\\text{TMB}_A = 12$, and $\\text{TIL}_A = 15$:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_A) = (0.35)\\left(\\frac{20}{10}\\right) + (0.50)\\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right) + (0.40)\\left(\\frac{15}{10}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_A) = (0.35)(2) + (0.50)(2.4) + (0.40)(1.5)\n$$\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_A) = 0.70 + 1.20 + 0.60 = 2.50\n$$\nFor Patient B, with $\\text{CPS}_B = 1$, $\\text{TMB}_B = 5$, and $\\text{TIL}_B = 5$:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_B) = (0.35)\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) + (0.50)\\left(\\frac{5}{5}\\right) + (0.40)\\left(\\frac{5}{10}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_B) = (0.35)(0.1) + (0.50)(1) + (0.40)(0.5)\n$$\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_B) = 0.035 + 0.50 + 0.20 = 0.735\n$$\nThe difference in composite scores is:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}_A) - S(\\mathbf{x}_B) = 2.50 - 0.735 = 1.765\n$$\nFinally, we compute the odds ratio:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\exp(1.765) \\approx 5.841505...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as required, we obtain $5.84$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.84}\n$$", "id": "2855800"}]}
