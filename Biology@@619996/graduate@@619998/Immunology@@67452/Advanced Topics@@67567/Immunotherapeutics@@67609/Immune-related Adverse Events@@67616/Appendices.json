This exercise provides a foundational model for this concept, using simple arithmetic to show how checkpoint blockade can dramatically shift the crucial ratio of effector T cells ($T_{\\text{eff}}$) to regulatory T cells ($T_{\\text{reg}}$). By calculating the change in this ratio after a single discrete step, you will gain a tangible understanding of how these therapies disrupt immune homeostasis at the cellular level [@problem_id:2858110].", "problem": "In patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), immune-related adverse events can emerge when effector T cells (Teff) expand and regulatory T cells (Treg) lose suppressive function. Consider a simple one-step model grounded in proportional change: if a population increases by a relative amount $p$, its next value is multiplied by $(1+p)$; if an effective capacity is reduced by a fraction $q$, its next effective value is multiplied by $(1-q)$. A patient starts with $100$ effector T cells and $100$ regulatory T cells. After one time step under checkpoint blockade, effector T cell proliferation increases by $30\\%$, and Treg suppressive capacity is reduced by $50\\%$, which we model as the effective Treg count being halved.

The model, based on proportional change, is a standard first-order approximation and does not violate any scientific principles. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary initial conditions and a clear, unambiguous rule for calculation, ensuring a unique solution exists. The data are self-consistent; the statement that Treg capacity is \"reduced by $50\\%$\" is explicitly equated to the \"effective Treg count being halved,\" which corresponds to multiplication by $(1 - 0.50) = 0.50$. All terms are defined, and the question is objective. The problem is therefore deemed valid as it presents a straightforward mathematical modeling exercise within a legitimate scientific context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the new ratio of effective effector T cells to effective regulatory T cells after one discrete time step.

According to the specified proportional change rule, the new population $N_{Teff}(1)$ is:\n$$ N_{Teff}(1) = N_{Teff}(0) \\times (1 + p) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ N_{Teff}(1) = 100 \\times (1 + 0.30) = 100 \\times 1.30 = 130 $$\n\nFor the regulatory T cells, their suppressive capacity is reduced by a fraction $q = 50\\% = 0.50$. This is explicitly modeled as the effective Treg count being modified. The rule for reduction implies the new effective count, $N_{Treg,eff}(1)$, is:\n$$ N_{Treg,eff}(1) = N_{Treg}(0) \\times (1 - q) $$\nThis is consistent with the problem's statement that the \"effective Treg count being halved,\" as $1 - q = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ N_{Treg,eff}(1) = 100 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 100 \\times 0.50 = 50 $$\n\nThe new effective effector-to-Treg ratio, $R(1)$, is the ratio of these two new quantities:\n$$ R(1) = \\frac{N_{Teff}(1)}{N_{Treg,eff}(1)} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the populations at $t=1$:\n$$ R(1) = \\frac{130}{50} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$ R(1) = \\frac{13}{5} = 2.6 $$\nThis is the final required value, a pure number representing the new ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.6}$$", "id": "2858110"}, {"introduction": "Building on the static view of cellular ratios, we now turn to the temporal dynamics of irAEs, because it is not just a matter of *if* an adverse event will occur, but *when*.
