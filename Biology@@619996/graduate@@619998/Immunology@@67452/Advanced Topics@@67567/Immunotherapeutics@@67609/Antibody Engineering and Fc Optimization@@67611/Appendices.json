The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid and can be solved.\n\nWe begin with the derivation. Let the Fc fragment be denoted by $A$ and the $\\text{Fc}\\gamma\\text{RIIIa}$ receptor by $B$. Their reversible binding forms a complex, $AB$. The reaction is represented as:\n$$\nA + B \\underset{k_{\\text{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\text{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} AB\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of formation of the complex (association) is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = k_{\\text{on}} [A] [B]\n$$\nAnd the rate of breakdown of the complex (dissociation) is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} = k_{\\text{off}} [AB]\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the net rate of change of the complex concentration is zero, meaning the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$\nk_{\\text{on}} [A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}} = k_{\\text{off}} [AB]_{\\text{eq}}\n$$\nwhere the subscript `eq` denotes concentrations at equilibrium. The problem defines the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{D}$, as the ratio of the product of free reactant concentrations to the complex concentration at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}}}{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}\n$$\nBy rearranging the rate equality at equilibrium, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}}}{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}\n$$\nTherefore, the relationship connecting the equilibrium dissociation constant to the kinetic rate constants is:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}\n$$\nThis derivation is complete. We now apply this relationship to the provided data.\n\nFirst, for the afucosylated Fc variant ($K_{D, \\text{afuco}}$):\n$$\nK_{D, \\text{afuco}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off, afuco}}}{k_{\\text{on, afuco}}} = \\frac{0.2\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{2 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}\n$$\nThe problem requires the value in nanomolar ($\\text{nM}$). Since $1\\ \\text{M} = 10^{9}\\ \\text{nM}$:\n$$\nK_{D, \\text{afuco}} = (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^{9}\\ \\text{nM}}{1\\ \\text{M}}\\right) = 1000\\ \\text{nM}\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures, we get $1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{nM}$.\n\nSecond, for the fucosylated Fc variant ($K_{D, \\text{fuco}}$):\n$$\nK_{D, \\text{fuco}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off, fuco}}}{k_{\\text{on, fuco}}} = \\frac{0.24\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{8 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.03 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{M} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}\n$$\nConverting to nanomolar:\n$$\nK_{D, \\text{fuco}} = (3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^{9}\\ \\text{nM}}{1\\ \\text{M}}\\right) = 3000\\ \\text{nM}\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures, we get $3.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{nM}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-change in affinity. Affinity is the inverse of the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_{A} = 1/K_{D}$). A lower $K_{D}$ signifies a higher affinity. The fold-change in affinity of the afucosylated Fc relative to the fucosylated Fc is the ratio of their respective affinities:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\text{Affinity}_{\\text{afuco}}}{\\text{Affinity}_{\\text{fuco}}} = \\frac{1 / K_{D, \\text{afuco}}}{1 / K_{D, \\text{fuco}}} = \\frac{K_{D, \\text{fuco}}}{K_{D, \\text{afuco}}}\n$$\nUsing the unrounded values for precision:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}} = 3\n$$\nRounding this result to two significant figures gives $3.0$.\n\nNote that the afucosylated variant exhibits a lower $K_{D}$ value ($1000\\ \\text{nM}$ vs $3000\\ \\text{nM}$), which correctly corresponds to a higher binding affinity.

There are no identifiable flaws. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, as a function of the ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$.\n\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors, $[RL]$, to the total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, and the concentration of ligand-bound receptors, $[RL]$.\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\theta$ gives:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}\n$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nFrom this expression, we can isolate the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}\n$$\nThe term $[RL]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator's sum. It can be factored out and canceled, provided $[RL] > 0$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1}\n$$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional receptor occupancy. This is the Langmuir-Hill equation for non-cooperative, $1{:}1$ binding.\n\nThe second task is to compute the fractional occupancy for both receptor allotypes at a ligand concentration of $[L] = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. First, all concentrations must be in consistent units. We convert the $K_D$ values from $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- For the $\\mathrm{V}158$ allotype: $K_D^{\\mathrm{V}158} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- For the $\\mathrm{F}158$ allotype: $K_D^{\\mathrm{F}158} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nThe ligand concentration is given as $[L] = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nNow we calculate the fractional occupancy for each allotype using the derived formula $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{V}158$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{V}158} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{100}{1100} = \\frac{1}{11}\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{F}158$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{F}158} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{3000\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{100}{3100} = \\frac{1}{31}\n$$\n\nThe final task is to determine the fold-change in the minimal antibody concentration, $[L]^{*}$, required for the $\\mathrm{F}158$ allotype relative to the $\\mathrm{V}158$ allotype to reach the same activation threshold, $\\theta^{*}$. The model establishes that $\\theta([L]^{*}; K_D) = \\theta^{*}$.\n\nLet $[L]_{\\mathrm{V}158}^{*}$ and $[L]_{\\mathrm{F}158}^{*}$ be the minimal concentrations for the $\\mathrm{V}158$ and $\\mathrm{F}158$ allotypes, respectively.

To do this, we rearrange the occupancy equation to solve for $[L]^{*}$ in terms of $K_D$ and $\\theta^{*}$:\n$$\n\\theta^{*} = \\frac{[L]^{*}}{K_D + [L]^{*}}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^{*} (K_D + [L]^{*}) = [L]^{*}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^{*} K_D + \\theta^{*} [L]^{*} = [L]^{*}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^{*} K_D = [L]^{*} - \\theta^{*} [L]^{*} = [L]^{*} (1 - \\theta^{*})\n$$\n$$\n[L]^{*} = K_D \\left(\\frac{\\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}}\\right)\n$$\nThis result shows that for a fixed threshold occupancy $\\theta^{*}$, the required ligand concentration $[L]^{*}$ is directly proportional to the dissociation constant $K_D$. The term $\\frac{\\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}}$ is a constant because $\\theta^{*}$ is the same for both allotypes.\n\nWe can now write the expressions for the minimal concentrations for each allotype:\n$$\n[L]_{\\mathrm{V}158}^{*} = K_D^{\\mathrm{V}158} \\left(\\frac{\\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n[L]_{\\mathrm{F}158}^{*} = K_D^{\\mathrm{F}158} \\left(\\frac{\\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}}\\right)\n$$\nThe fold-change is the ratio of these two concentrations:\n$$\n\\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{F}158}^{*}}{[L]_{\\mathrm{V}158}^{*}} = \\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{F}158} \\left(\\frac{\\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}}\\right)}{K_D^{\\mathrm{V}158} \\left(\\frac{\\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}}\\right)} = \\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{F}158}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{V}158}}\n$$\nThe constant term cancels, and the fold-change in required concentration is simply the ratio of the dissociation constants. Substituting the given values:\n$$\n\\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{F}158}^{*}}{[L]_{\\mathrm{V}158}^{*}} = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 3.0\n$$\nThe lower affinity of the $\\mathrm{F}158$ allotype ($K_D$ is higher) means that a $3$-fold higher concentration of antibody is required to achieve the same level of receptor occupancy and thus trigger a biological response.
