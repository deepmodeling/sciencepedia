It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed problem in biophysical chemistry applied to an immunological context. It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two results. First, the derivation of an expression for the fraction of engaged B7 ligands bound by CD28, denoted $f_{28}$. Second, a calculation of the CTLA-4 abundance, $R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$, required for $f_{28}$ to be exactly one-half.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $f_{28}$\n\nWe model the competitive binding of two receptors, CD28 ($R_{28}$) and CTLA-4 ($R_C$), to a single ligand B7 ($L$). The interactions are described by the following reversible reactions at equilibrium:\n$$ R_{28} + L \\rightleftharpoons C_{28} $$\n$$ R_{C} + L \\rightleftharpoons C_{C} $$\nwhere $C_{28}$ is the CD28–B7 complex and $C_{C}$ is the CTLA-4–B7 complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constants for these reactions are given by:\n$$ K_{28} = \\frac{[R_{28}][L]}{[C_{28}]} $$\n$$ K_{C} = \\frac{[R_{C}][L]}{[C_{C}]} $$\nHere, $[X]$ denotes the abundance or concentration of species $X$ at steady state. We can rearrange these expressions to solve for the concentrations of the bound complexes:\n$$ [C_{28}] = \\frac{[R_{28}][L]}{K_{28}} $$\n$$ [C_{C}] = \\frac{[R_{C}][L]}{K_{C}} $$\n\nThe problem states that we are in the low-occupancy regime, where the concentration of unbound receptor is approximately equal to the total receptor concentration for each species. Mathematically, this assumption is expressed as:\n$$ [R_{28}] \\approx R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\n$$ [R_{C}] \\approx R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the expressions for the complex concentrations, we obtain:\n$$ [C_{28}] \\approx \\frac{R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]}{K_{28}} $$\n$$ [C_{C}] \\approx \\frac{R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]}{K_{C}} $$\n\nThe fraction of engaged B7 ligands that are bound by CD28, $f_{28}$, is defined as the number of B7 ligands bound to CD28 divided by the total number of engaged B7 ligands. The total number of engaged ligands is the sum of ligands bound to CD28 and ligands bound to CTLA-4.\n$$ f_{28} = \\frac{[C_{28}]}{[C_{28}] + [C_{C}]} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[C_{28}]$ and $[C_{C}]$ based on our assumptions:\n$$ f_{28} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]}{K_{28}}}{\\frac{R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]}{K_{28}} + \\frac{R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]}{K_{C}}} $$\nThe concentration of free ligand, $[L]$, is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out.

We set our derived expression for $f_{28}$ equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{28}}}{\\frac{R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{28}} + \\frac{R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{C}}} $$\nThis equation is satisfied if and only if the two terms in the denominator are equal:\n$$ \\frac{R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{28}} = \\frac{R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{C}} $$\nThis condition states that for the ligand binding to be split equally between the two receptors, their respective \"binding potentials\", given by the ratio of total abundance to the dissociation constant, must be equal.\n\nWe now solve for $R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$ R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{K_{C}}{K_{28}} $$\nThe problem provides the following parameter values:\n$K_{28} = 5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$K_{C} = 0.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$R_{28}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2.4 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules per cell\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$ R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = (2.4 \\times 10^{4}) \\times \\frac{0.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} $$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel as expected.\n$$ R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = (2.4 \\times 10^{4}) \\times 0.1 $$\n$$ R_{C}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2.4 \\times 10^{3} $$\nThe result is $2400$ molecules per cell.

This is a steady state $(\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0, \\frac{dE}{dt} = 0)$ where the tumor population is zero, i.e., $T^* = 0$.\nSubstituting $T^* = 0$ into the first equation automatically satisfies it:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt}\\bigg|_{T=0} = r(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{0}{K}\\right) - \\kappa (0) E = 0 $$\nSubstituting $T^* = 0$ into the second equation to find the corresponding equilibrium value for $E^*$:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt}\\bigg|_{(0, E^*)} = \\sigma - \\delta E^* + \\frac{\\alpha E^* (0)}{H + 0} - \\eta E^* (0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma - \\delta E^* = 0 \\implies E^* = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} $$\nThe tumor-free equilibrium is therefore $(T^*, E^*) = \\left(0, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}\\right)$.\n\nTo analyze the local stability of this equilibrium, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(T, E)$, and evaluate it at this point.\n$$ J(T, E) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} = r - \\frac{2r}{K}T - \\kappa E $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E} = -\\kappa T $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(E \\left(\\frac{\\alpha T}{H+T} - \\eta T\\right)\\right) = E \\left(\\frac{\\alpha(H+T) - \\alpha T(1)}{(H+T)^2} - \\eta\\right) = E \\left(\\frac{\\alpha H}{(H+T)^2} - \\eta\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E} = - \\delta + \\frac{\\alpha T}{H+T} - \\eta T $$\n\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at the equilibrium point $\\left(0, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}\\right)$:\n$$ J_{11} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T}\\bigg|_{(0, \\sigma/\\delta)} = r - \\frac{2r}{K}(0) - \\kappa\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}\\right) = r - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} $$\n$$ J_{12} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\bigg|_{(0, \\sigma/\\delta)} = -\\kappa (0) = 0 $$\n$$ J_{21} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T}\\bigg|_{(0, \\sigma/\\delta)} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha H}{(H+0)^2} - \\eta\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{H} - \\eta\\right) $$\n$$ J_{22} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E}\\bigg|_{(0, \\sigma/\\delta)} = -\\delta + \\frac{\\alpha(0)}{H+0} - \\eta(0) = -\\delta $$\nThe Jacobian matrix at the tumor-free equilibrium is:\n$$ J^* = J\\left(0, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{H} - \\eta\\right) & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $J^*$ have negative real parts. Since $J^*$ is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = r - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = -\\delta $$\nThe parameter $\\delta$ represents a decay rate and is therefore positive ($\\delta > 0$), which means $\\lambda_2 = -\\delta$ is always negative. This reflects the biological reality that in the absence of stimulation, the T cell population would decay.\n\nThe stability condition thus rests entirely on the sign of $\\lambda_1$. For local asymptotic stability, we require $\\lambda_1 < 0$:\n$$ r - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} < 0 $$\nThis inequality can be interpreted as the condition that the rate of tumor cell killing by the baseline T cell population ($\\kappa E^* = \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta}$) must exceed the tumor's intrinsic net growth rate ($r$).\n\nTo find the condition on $\\sigma$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$ r < \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} $$\n$$ r\\delta < \\kappa\\sigma $$\nSince $\\kappa > 0$ (it is a rate constant), we can divide by it without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$ \\sigma > \\frac{r\\delta}{\\kappa} $$\nThis is the condition for the local asymptotic stability of the tumor-free equilibrium. The minimal value of the baseline T cell influx, $\\sigma_c$, required to achieve this stability is the value at the boundary of this condition.\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\frac{r\\delta}{\\kappa} $$\nThis result indicates that to maintain a tumor-free state against small perturbations, the baseline rate of immune cell supply must be sufficiently high to counteract the tumor's intrinsic growth, scaled by the ratio of T cell decay to killing efficacy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{r\\delta}{\\kappa}}\n$$", "id": "2856224"}]}
