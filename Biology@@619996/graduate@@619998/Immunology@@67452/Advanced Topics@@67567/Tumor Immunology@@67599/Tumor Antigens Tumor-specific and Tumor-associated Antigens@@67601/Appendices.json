Consider a tumor whose nonsynonymous tumor mutation burden is $8$ per $\\mathrm{Mb}$ across a coding sequence span of $30\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$. Suppose a fraction $0.5$ of these nonsynonymous mutations occur in genes that are transcriptionally expressed. Assume that each expressed nonsynonymous mutation yields one candidate mutant peptide that enters the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) processing pathway.

Provide your final answer as a single real number representing a count (no units). No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem statement is submitted for validation.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\nThe following data and definitions are provided:\n-   Nonsynonymous tumor mutation burden ($B$): $8$ per $\\mathrm{Mb}$. This is the number of nonsynonymous mutations per megabase of coding DNA.\n-   Coding sequence span ($L$): $30\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$. This is the total length of the coding sequence considered.\n-   Fraction of nonsynonymous mutations in expressed genes ($f_{exp}$): $0.5$.\n-   Genesis of candidate peptides: Each expressed nonsynonymous mutation is assumed to yield one candidate mutant peptide.\n-   Per-candidate Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) binding probability ($P_{bind}$): $0.01$. This is the probability that a single candidate peptide will bind to an HLA molecule with sufficient affinity for presentation.\n-   Assumptions: Independence across mutations and linearity of expectation.\n-   Objective: Derive an expression and compute the expected number of presented mutant peptides (neoantigens).\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of cancer immunology, specifically concerning the generation of neoantigens from somatic mutations. The terminology used, such as \"nonsynonymous mutation,\" \"tumor mutation burden,\" \"MHC class I,\" and \"HLA binding,\" is standard in the field. The provided numerical values ($B=8 \\text{ per Mb}$, $L=30 \\text{ Mb}$, $f_{exp}=0.5$, $P_{bind}=0.01$) are within plausible ranges observed in clinical and research settings. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a calculation. The directive to use linearity of expectation provides a clear mathematical framework. The problem is objective, quantitative, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected number of presented neoantigens, which we shall denote as $E[N_{pres}]$. We construct the solution by sequentially determining the quantities involved.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of nonsynonymous mutations ($N_{mut}$) within the specified coding sequence span. This is the product of the tumor mutation burden ($B$) and the coding sequence span ($L$).\n$$N_{mut} = B \\times L$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{mut} = (8 \\text{ mutations}/\\mathrm{Mb}) \\times (30 \\text{ Mb}) = 240 \\text{ mutations}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the number of these mutations that are in expressed genes, which is the number of mutations that can potentially generate a protein product. This count, $N_{exp}$, is obtained by multiplying the total number of mutations ($N_{mut}$) by the fraction of mutations that are expressed ($f_{exp}$).\n$$N_{exp} = N_{mut} \\times f_{exp}$$\nSubstituting the value for $N_{mut}$:\n$$N_{exp} = 240 \\times 0.5 = 120$$\nAccording to the problem statement, each expressed nonsynonymous mutation yields one candidate mutant peptide. Thus, the number of candidate peptides is equal to $N_{exp}$, which is $120$.\n\nThird, we calculate the expected number of these candidate peptides that will successfully bind to an HLA molecule and be presented on the cell surface. Let us define a set of indicator random variables, $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{N_{exp}}$, where $i$ indexes each of the $N_{exp}$ candidate peptides. For each peptide $i$, let $X_i=1$ if the peptide is presented, and $X_i=0$ if it is not.\nThe probability that any given peptide is presented is the HLA binding probability, $P(X_i=1) = P_{bind} = 0.01$.\nThe expected value of each indicator random variable is:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\times P(X_i=1) + 0 \\times P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = P_{bind}$$\nThe total number of presented peptides, $N_{pres}$, is the sum of these indicator variables over all candidate peptides:\n$$N_{pres} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{exp}} X_i$$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of presented peptides, $E[N_{pres}]$. We apply the principle of linearity of expectation, which states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations, regardless of their independence.\n$$E[N_{pres}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{exp}} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{exp}} E[X_i]$$\nSince $E[X_i] = P_{bind}$ for all $i$:\n$$E[N_{pres}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{exp}} P_{bind} = N_{exp} \\times P_{bind}$$\nThis confirms that the expected total is the number of trials multiplied by the probability of success for each trial.\n\nNow, we combine all steps into a single expression for the expected number of presented neoantigens:\n$$E[N_{pres}] = (B \\times L) \\times f_{exp} \\times P_{bind}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$E[N_{pres}] = (8 \\times 30) \\times 0.5 \\times 0.01$$\n$$E[N_{pres}] = 240 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.01$$\n$$E[N_{pres}] = 120 \\times 0.01$$\n$$E[N_{pres}] = 1.2$$\nThe expected number of presented mutant peptides is $1.2$. This is an average value; the actual number for any single tumor would be an integer, but the expectation can be a non-integer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.2}$$", "id": "2902539"}, {"introduction": "One might intuitively expect that a recurrent driver mutation, such as BRAF V600E found in many melanoma patients, would generate a \"public\" neoantigen that could be targeted universally. However, this is rarely the case. This thought experiment challenges you to deconstruct the antigen processing and presentation pathway to uncover why a shared mutation typically leads to a patient-specific, or \"private,\" neoantigen repertoire, considering factors from proteasomal cleavage to the profound effects of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) polymorphism. [@problem_id:2902490]", "problem": "A cohort of melanoma patients all carry the same canonical driver mutation in the B-Raf Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase (BRAF), namely the valine-to-glutamate substitution at position $600$ (BRAF V600E). Investigators expect that this shared mutation will yield a shared set of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) neoantigens visible to cytotoxic T lymphocytes across patients. However, mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics and immunogenicity assays reveal that the exact mutation-bearing pMHC species detected on the tumor cell surface are not shared across all patients and vary with Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I alleles.\n\nStarting from the Central Dogma (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein) and the antigen processing and presentation pathway for HLA class I (proteasomal proteolysis, Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase (ERAP) trimming, loading onto HLA class I heavy chain with Beta-$2$ microglobulin (B2M) in the peptide loading complex, and export to the plasma membrane), and from the core definition that tumor-specific antigens (neoantigens) arise from non-self alterations in the amino acid sequence, whereas tumor-associated antigens are self-derived but aberrantly expressed, determine which statements correctly explain why a shared recurrent mutation such as BRAF V600E does not guarantee shared pMHC neoantigens across patients and HLA alleles.\n\nSelect all that apply.\n\nA. HLA polymorphism leads to distinct peptide-binding motifs and anchor residue requirements; peptides spanning the V600E substitution can adopt different registers and lengths across alleles, and may fail to achieve adequate affinity or stability for some alleles, preventing a common pMHC across patients.\n\nB. The proteasome, TAP, and ERAP generate and edit cytosolic peptides in an allele- and tissue-independent way; because the BRAF primary sequence around position $600$ is the same, the identical set of mutation-bearing peptides will be produced and presented in all patients regardless of cellular context.\n\nC. Tumors can reduce or abrogate antigen presentation by downregulating components of the antigen-processing machinery or by losing HLA class I expression (for example, via loss of heterozygosity at HLA loci or defects in B2M), thereby preventing surface display of mutation-derived peptides despite the mutation being present.\n\nD.

Differences in proteasome isoform usage (constitutive versus immunoproteasome) and nearby post-translational modifications can alter cleavage and trimming preferences, shifting which mutation-containing peptide registers reach the endoplasmic reticulum and bind HLA, yielding interpatient variability even for the same amino acid substitution.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid and poses a substantive question in tumor immunology. The core task is to identify the mechanisms that explain the observed discordance between a shared somatic mutation and the resulting repertoire of presented neoantigens across a patient cohort. The basis for analysis shall be the established pathway of HLA class I antigen processing and presentation.\n\nThe generation of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) neoantigen is a sequential, probabilistic process starting from the mutant protein product. A mutation such as BRAF V600E gives rise to a novel amino acid sequence, but for this sequence to be recognized by the immune system, a peptide fragment containing the mutation must navigate the entire antigen presentation cascade successfully. Variability and bottlenecks exist at each stage.\n\n1.  **Protein Synthesis and Degradation**: The amount of BRAF V600E protein that serves as a substrate for processing is determined by gene expression levels, mRNA stability, translational efficiency, and protein turnover rates. These factors can vary significantly between different patients' tumors.\n\n2.  **Proteasomal Cleavage**: The protein is cleaved into peptides by the proteasome. The set of initial peptide fragments depends on the proteasome's cleavage specificity. This specificity is not uniform; it differs between the constitutive proteasome and the immunoproteasome, whose expression is often induced in the tumor microenvironment. Post-translational modifications flanking the mutation site can also alter cleavage patterns.\n\n3.  **Peptide Transport and Trimming**: The generated peptides must be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), which has its own sequence and length preferences. Within the ER, peptides may be further trimmed by Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidases (ERAPs), which also exhibit sequence specificity.\n\n4.  **HLA Binding**: This is the most critical source of inter-patient variability. The HLA genes are extraordinarily polymorphic. Each HLA allele encodes a molecule with a unique peptide-binding groove structure. This structure dictates strict requirements for the length and amino acid sequence (specifically at \"anchor\" positions) of the peptides it can bind. A peptide generated from BRAF V600E that binds with high affinity to one patient's HLA allele (e.g., HLA-A\\*02:01) is very unlikely to bind to a different allele (e.g., HLA-B\\*44:02) present in another patient.\n\n5.  **Component Integrity**: The entire antigen presentation machinery (APM) must be functional. Tumors frequently evade immune destruction by downregulating or incurring loss-of-function mutations in APM components, such as the HLA heavy chain itself, Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), or TAP.\n\nBased on these principles, each statement is evaluated as follows:\n\nA. HLA polymorphism leads to distinct peptide-binding motifs and anchor residue requirements; peptides spanning the V600E substitution can adopt different registers and lengths across alleles, and may fail to achieve adequate affinity or stability for some alleles, preventing a common pMHC across patients.\n**Analysis**: This statement is fundamentally correct. It accurately identifies HLA polymorphism as the primary reason for patient-specific neoantigen presentation. The concepts of distinct binding motifs, anchor residues, peptide registers, affinity, and stability are all central to the specificity of HLA-peptide interactions. This directly explains why a neoantigen is restricted to certain HLA alleles and is not shared across the population.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\nB. The proteasome, TAP, and ERAP generate and edit cytosolic peptides in an allele- and tissue-independent way; because the BRAF primary sequence around position $600$ is the same, the identical set of mutation-bearing peptides will be produced and presented in all patients regardless of cellular context.\n**Analysis**: This statement is patently false. The generation and editing of peptides are not independent of cellular context. As explained above, proteasome composition (constitutive vs. immunoproteasome) varies. The activity of TAP and ERAP can also be modulated. The ultimate conclusion that an identical set of peptides will be *presented* is a grievous error, as it entirely ignores the determinative role of polymorphic HLA binding.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Tumors can reduce or abrogate antigen presentation by downregulating components of the antigen-processing machinery or by losing HLA class I expression (for example, via loss of heterozygosity at HLA loci or defects in B2M), thereby preventing surface display of mutation-derived peptides despite the mutation being present.\n**Analysis**: This statement correctly describes a major mechanism of tumor immune escape. Loss of HLA expression, commonly through loss of heterozygosity or inactivating mutations in B2M (which is required for all HLA class I surface expression), creates a global defect in antigen presentation. In such a tumor, no peptides, including neoantigens, can be presented, thus explaining the absence of the expected pMHC species.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\nD. Variation across tumors in messenger RNA splicing, protein abundance, turnover kinetics, and subcellular localization modulates the intracellular supply of candidate mutation-bearing peptides, such that their concentration may be insufficient to compete for HLA loading in some patients.\n**Analysis**: This statement correctly identifies upstream, \"supply-side\" sources of variability. The presentation of a peptide on an HLA molecule is a competitive process. The abundance of a specific neoantigen precursor peptide must be sufficient to outcompete the vast number of peptides derived from self-proteins. Inter-patient and inter-tumoral heterogeneity in gene expression, protein stability, and degradation rates directly impact this substrate supply, providing a valid explanation for why a potential neoantigen may not be presented in some cases.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\nE. Because driver mutations are functionally selected during oncogenesis, they create universal overexpressed tumor-associated antigens whose processing and HLA binding are constrained to be identical across patients, ensuring a common pMHC.\n**Analysis**: This statement is flawed in multiple respects. First, it incorrectly categorizes a mutation-derived antigen as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), whereas by definition, it is a tumor-specific antigen or neoantigen. Second, a driver mutation's functional role provides no constraint that forces processing and HLA binding to be identical across patients; this claim defies the reality of HLA polymorphism and variable cellular machinery. The conclusion that a common pMHC is ensured is the exact opposite of the observed phenomenon.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. Differences in proteasome isoform usage (constitutive versus immunoproteasome) and nearby post-translational modifications can alter cleavage and trimming preferences, shifting which mutation-containing peptide registers reach the endoplasmic reticulum and bind HLA, yielding interpatient variability even for the same amino acid substitution.\n**Analysis**: This statement correctly identifies valid sources of variability in the initial generation of the peptide repertoire. The catalytic subunits of the immunoproteasome, which is often expressed in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, have different cleavage preferences from the constitutive proteasome. This, along with the potential influence of post-translational modifications on cleavage, means that even from an identical source protein, different sets of peptides can be generated in different patients, contributing to the observed variability.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "2902490"}, {"introduction": "After computational prediction of neoantigens, the crucial next step is empirical validation: proving that a patient's T cells can actually recognize and respond to these peptides.

It presents a standard, well-defined task in tumor immunology with clear scientific objectives and constraints. We must evaluate each experimental design against the fundamental principles of T cell immunology.\n\nA rigorous experiment to validate T cell responses to predicted neoantigens must satisfy the following criteria:\n$1$. **Correct Antigen Presentation**: The assay must use autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that express the patient's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, specifically HLA-A\\*02:01 for the provided $9$â€“$10$-mer peptides, to present these epitopes to T cells. The T cells must be from the same patient (autologous).\n$2$. **Specificity Controls**: The design must include meticulous controls to ensure any observed response is specific to the neoantigen and not an experimental artifact. This includes a negative vehicle control (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and an irrelevant peptide control (a peptide with similar characteristics that is not the target antigen).\n$3$. **Functionality Control**: A positive control is required to confirm the T cells are viable and capable of producing a cytokine response upon stimulation. This stimulus should ideally confirm the integrity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway.\n$4$. **MHC Restriction**: The design must explicitly demonstrate that the T cell response is restricted by the patient's MHC molecules. This is a defining characteristic of T cell recognition and is non-negotiable for a valid conclusion. It is typically shown using MHC-blocking antibodies or HLA-mismatched APCs.\n$5$. **Appropriate Assay Conditions**: Stimulation should be performed *ex vivo* to measure pre-existing responses, using non-toxic peptide concentrations (typically $1$â€“$10\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) and avoiding polyclonal stimuli (like interleukin-2 (IL-2)) that would cause non-specific bystander activation.\n$6$. **Rigorous Data Analysis**: For flow cytometry-based assays, data analysis must include proper gating to isolate the cell population of interest (e.g., live, singlet, CD3$^+$, CD8$^+$ T cells). For any assay, clear and statistically sound criteria for defining a positive response must be established.\n\nWe now evaluate each proposed design against these principles.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis design proposes using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) for interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$). It uses purified autologous CD8$^+$ T cells co-cultured with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). This is a clean and appropriate system for assessing CD8$^+$ T cell responses to MHC class I peptides. The peptide concentration ($1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) and stimulation time ($16$â€“$20$ hours) are standard for a direct *ex vivo* assay. The negative controlsâ€”vehicle (DMSO) and matched irrelevant peptidesâ€”are excellent. The positive control, plate-bound anti-CD3, correctly verifies TCR-mediated activation capacity. Critically, MHC restriction is demonstrated by two independent and robust methods: antiâ€“HLA-A,B,C blocking antibody and HLA-mismatched allogeneic DCs. The criteria for calling a positive response are clearly defined and quantitative. This protocol adheres to all principles of a scientifically rigorous experiment.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:**\nThis design uses whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which is acceptable. However, it stimulates the cells with peptide and IL-2 for $7$ days. This is an *in vitro* expansion, not a direct measurement of the circulating T cell response. The continuous presence of a high dose of IL-2 ($100\\,\\text{U/mL}$) will induce non-specific proliferation and activation, making it impossible to distinguish an antigen-specific response from bystander effects. The negative control (\"media only\") is insufficient as it omits the peptide vehicle control (DMSO). The positive control, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin, bypasses TCR signaling entirely. Most importantly, the design explicitly states that \"No MHC blocking or HLA-mismatch control is included.\" This is a fatal flaw, as it fails to demonstrate MHC restriction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis design employs intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). It uses a peptide pool at a very high concentration of $50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ per peptide, which risks non-specific T cell activation or toxicity. The inclusion of soluble anti-CD28 during stimulation can further lower the activation threshold and increase background noise. As with option B, it fails to include any method to test for MHC restriction, a critical requirement. The most egregious error is in the data analysis: \"Cells are analyzed without gating on viability or on CD3$^+$ T cells.\" Analyzing flow cytometry data without excluding dead cells (via a viability dye) and non-T cells (by CD3 gating) is scientifically invalid. Dead cells non-specifically bind antibodies, and any observed cytokine production cannot be definitively attributed to T cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis design uses ICS and a sophisticated cell preparation involving purified T cells and APCs. It correctly uses short peptides ($9$â€“$10$-mers) for CD8$^+$ T cells and longer peptides ($15$-mers) for potential CD4$^+$ T cell responses, which is appropriate for MHC class II presentation to the patient's HLA-DRB1\\*04:01 allele. The peptide concentration ($1$â€“$2\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) and stimulation duration ($6$ hours) are ideal for an *ex vivo* ICS assay. It includes both vehicle (DMSO) and irrelevant peptide negative controls. The positive control (soluble anti-CD3) is valid. Crucially, it includes comprehensive tests for MHC restriction for both T cell subsets: antiâ€“HLA-A,B,C for CD8$^+$ cells, antiâ€“HLA-DR for CD4$^+$ cells, and the use of HLA-mismatched APCs. The proposed flow cytometry analysis is meticulous, including gating on singlets, live cells, and specific T cell subsets. The criteria for positivity are stringent and well-defined. This design represents the gold standard for this type of investigation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option E:**\nThis design uses autologous tumor lysate as the antigen source. While this can be a valid screening method, it does not fulfill the problem's task of testing responses to the specific synthetic peptides provided. The use of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a catastrophic error. LPS is a potent Toll-like receptor agonist that will induce a massive, non-specific inflammatory response from APCs, leading to bystander activation of T cells and completely confounding the results. A lysate from an unrelated tumor is a poor negative control. Most importantly, the design omits any test for MHC restriction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, only experimental designs A and D satisfy the stringent requirements for scientific rigor, proper controls, and demonstration of MHC-restricted, antigen-specific T cell activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2902497"}]}
