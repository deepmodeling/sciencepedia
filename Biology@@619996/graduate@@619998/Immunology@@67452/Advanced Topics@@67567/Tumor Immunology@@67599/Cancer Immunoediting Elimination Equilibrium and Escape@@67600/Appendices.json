During the elimination phase of cancer immunoediting, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) of density $E(t)$ kill tumor cells. Assume the following fundamental and widely used modeling assumptions:\n- In the short-time window after a strong priming or adoptive transfer, the CTL density is approximately constant at $E(t) \\approx E_{0}$.\n- CTL-mediated killing of tumor cells follows mass-action kinetics with rate constant $k$, so that the per capita death rate imposed on tumor cells is $k\\,E_{0}$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the early-time tumor dynamics are given by $dT/dt = \\big(r - k\\,E_{0}\\big)\\,T$.

I will proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested. The analysis is structured according to the three tasks posed in the problem.\n\n1) Derivation of the condition for elimination.\nThe dynamics of the tumor cell population $T(t)$ are described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\left(r - k E_{0}\\right) T\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the tumor-intrinsic growth rate, $k$ is the mass-action killing rate constant, and $E_{0}$ is the constant density of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This is a linear, homogeneous, first-order differential equation. For a given initial tumor population $T(0)$ at time $t=0$, the solution is:\n$$\nT(t) = T(0) \\exp\\left(\\left(r - k E_{0}\\right)t\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines elimination as the condition where $T(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for all time $t \\ge 0$, starting from any positive initial population $T(0) > 0$. For an exponential function of the form $A \\exp(\\lambda t)$ with $A > 0$, the function is strictly decreasing if and only if the rate constant $\\lambda$ is negative. In our model, the effective rate constant is $\\lambda = r - k E_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, for elimination to occur, we must have:\n$$\nr - k E_{0} < 0\n$$\nRearranging this inequality provides the quantitative condition on the parameters for the elimination regime:\n$$\nr < k E_{0}\n$$\nThis condition has a clear biological interpretation: elimination of the tumor is achieved when the intrinsic per capita growth rate of the tumor ($r$) is strictly less than the per capita killing rate imposed by the immune system ($k E_{0}$).\n\n2) Definition of the basic immune control number $R_{I}$.\nThe second task is to define a dimensionless quantity, $R_{I}$, that compares the rate of tumor-intrinsic expansion to the rate of immune-mediated killing. The rate of expansion is characterized by $r$, which has units of $\\text{time}^{-1}$. The rate of killing is characterized by the product $k E_{0}$. The dimensions of $k$ are $\\text{volume} \\cdot \\text{cell}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{time}^{-1}$ and the dimensions of $E_{0}$ are $\\text{cells} \\cdot \\text{volume}^{-1}$, so the product $k E_{0}$ also has units of $\\text{time}^{-1}$.\n\nA dimensionless number can be formed by taking the ratio of these two rates. To establish a clear threshold for control, we use the elimination condition $r < k E_{0}$. Dividing both sides by the positive quantity $k E_{0}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{k E_{0}} < 1\n$$\nThis inequality structure suggests defining the basic immune control number as the ratio of the tumor growth rate to the immune killing rate. This is analogous to the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ in epidemiology, where a value less than $1$ signifies population decline. Thus, we define $R_{I}$ as:\n$$\nR_{I} = \\frac{r}{k E_{0}}\n$$\nWith this definition, the elimination regime is characterized by $R_{I} < 1$. The equilibrium and escape regimes correspond to $R_{I} = 1$ and $R_{I} > 1$, respectively.\n\n3) Calculation of $R_{I}$ and interpretation.\nThe third task is to compute $R_{I}$ using the provided parameter values:\n- $r = 0.028\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$\n- $E_{0} = 4.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{cells}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$\n- $k = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{mL}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we compute the immune killing rate, $k E_{0}$:\n$$\nk E_{0} = (1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{mL}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{cells}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nk E_{0} = (1.2 \\times 4.0) \\times 10^{-7+5}\\,\\text{day}^{-1} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}\n$$\nSo, $k E_{0} = 0.048\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the dimensionless number $R_{I}$ using its definition:\n$$\nR_{I} = \\frac{r}{k E_{0}} = \\frac{0.028\\,\\text{day}^{-1}}{0.048\\,\\text{day}^{-1}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the fraction:\n$$\nR_{I} = \\frac{28}{48} = \\frac{7}{12}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value required, we perform the division:\n$$\nR_{I} \\approx 0.58333...\n$$\nThe problem specifies rounding the result to $3$ significant figures. This gives:\n$$\nR_{I} \\approx 0.583\n$$\nSince $R_{I} \\approx 0.583 < 1$, the condition for elimination is satisfied.

This is a standard, scientifically accepted framework for theoretical investigation. $T$ acts as the prey, and $E$ acts as the predator.

It asks for the equilibrium and stability analysis of a two-dimensional autonomous system, which is a mathematically well-posed problem.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem is therefore deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed as follows. First, we find the equilibrium points. Second, we linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix. Third, we evaluate the stability of each equilibrium point. Finally, we interpret these mathematical results within the specified biological context.\n\n**1. Derivation of Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points, denoted $(T^{\\ast}, E^{\\ast})$, are solutions to the system where the rates of change are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dE}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the algebraic system:\n$$\nT^{\\ast}(r - k E^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha T^{\\ast} - \\delta E^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nFrom the first equation, we have two possibilities: $T^{\\ast} = 0$ or $r - k E^{\\ast} = 0$.\n\nCase 1: $T^{\\ast} = 0$.\nSubstituting $T^{\\ast} = 0$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n\\alpha(0) - \\delta E^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies -\\delta E^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\delta > 0$, this implies $E^{\\ast} = 0$. Thus, we find the trivial, or tumor-free, equilibrium point:\n$$\n(T_1^{\\ast}, E_1^{\\ast}) = (0, 0)\n$$\n\nCase 2: $r - k E^{\\ast} = 0$.\nThis implies $E^{\\ast} = \\frac{r}{k}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n$$\n\\alpha T^{\\ast} - \\delta \\left(\\frac{r}{k}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\alpha T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\delta r}{k} \\implies T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}\n$$\nSince all parameters $r, k, \\alpha, \\delta$ are positive, we have $T^{\\ast} > 0$ and $E^{\\ast} > 0$. This gives the nontrivial, or coexistence, equilibrium point:\n$$\n(T_2^{\\ast}, E_2^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}, \\frac{r}{k}\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Stability Analysis via Linearization**\nThe stability of the equilibria is determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the system, evaluated at each equilibrium point. The vector field is given by $\\mathbf{F}(T,E) = \\begin{pmatrix} f(T,E) \\\\ g(T,E) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} rT - kET \\\\ \\alpha T - \\delta E \\end{pmatrix}$. The Jacobian matrix $J$ is:\n$$\nJ(T,E) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - kE & -kT \\\\ \\alpha & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe analyze the stability of each equilibrium.\n\nStability of the trivial equilibrium $(T_1^{\\ast}, E_1^{\\ast}) = (0, 0)$:\nThe Jacobian evaluated at $(0,0)$ is:\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - k(0) & -k(0) \\\\ \\alpha & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r & 0 \\\\ \\alpha & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = r$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\delta$.\nSince $r > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$, we have one positive eigenvalue ($\\lambda_1 > 0$) and one negative eigenvalue ($\\lambda_2 < 0$). This configuration defines a **saddle point**. A saddle point is inherently unstable.\n\nStability of the nontrivial equilibrium $(T_2^{\\ast}, E_2^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}, \\frac{r}{k})$:\nThe Jacobian evaluated at this point is:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}, \\frac{r}{k}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - k\\left(\\frac{r}{k}\\right) & -k\\left(\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}\\right) \\\\ \\alpha & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha} \\\\ \\alpha & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo determine stability, we examine the trace ($\\text{tr}$) and determinant ($\\det$) of this matrix.\n$$\n\\text{tr}(J) = 0 + (-\\delta) = -\\delta\n$$\n$$\n\\det(J) = (0)(-\\delta) - \\left(-\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha}\\right)(\\alpha) = \\delta r\n$$\nSince $\\delta > 0$, the trace is negative: $\\text{tr}(J) < 0$.\nSince $\\delta > 0$ and $r > 0$, the determinant is positive: $\\det(J) > 0$.\nFor a two-dimensional system, an equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if and only if $\\text{tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\det(J) > 0$. Both conditions are met. Therefore, the nontrivial equilibrium is **locally asymptotically stable**. The nature of the stable equilibrium (node or spiral) depends on the sign of the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial, $\\Delta = (\\text{tr}(J))^2 - 4\\det(J) = (-\\delta)^2 - 4(\\delta r) = \\delta(\\delta - 4r)$. If $\\delta > 4r$, it is a stable node; if $\\delta < 4r$, it is a stable spiral. In either case, it is stable.\n\n**3. Interpretation in Cancer Immunoediting**\nWe now interpret these findings.\n- **Elimination**: This phase implies the complete eradication of the tumor. The tumor-free state is $(0,0)$. However, our analysis shows this point is a saddle. Trajectories starting arbitrarily close to, but not exactly at, $(0,0)$ with $T(0) > 0$ will move away from it. This means that if even a small number of tumor cells are present, the system will not converge to the tumor-free state. Therefore, this model does not describe successful tumor elimination from a pre-existing tumor population.\n- **Equilibrium**: This phase represents a state where the immune system controls tumor growth, holding it in a dormant or chronic state. The nontrivial equilibrium $(T_2^{\\ast}, E_2^{\\ast})$ represents precisely this scenario: a persistent population of tumor cells coexisting with a persistent population of effector cells. Its local stability implies that small perturbations in either cell population will be corrected, and the system will return to this balanced state. This is the mathematical analogue of the immunoediting 'equilibrium' phase.\n- **Escape**: This phase corresponds to uncontrolled tumor growth, overwhelming the immune response. In this model, all trajectories in the biologically relevant first quadrant ($T>0, E>0$) are drawn towards the stable coexistence equilibrium. There are no trajectories that lead to unbounded growth ($T \\to \\infty$). Thus, this simple bilinear model **does not predict the 'escape' phase**. Escape would require additional nonlinearities, such as immune suppression by the tumor or a limited killing capacity of the effector cells (e.g., a Holling type II functional response), which are not included in the provided equations.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the analytical expression for the tumor-cell component $T^{\\ast}$ of the nontrivial equilibrium. Based on our derivation, this is:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}\n$$\nThis expression quantifies the size of the tumor population that is held in check by the immune system, as a function of the system's biological parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\delta r}{\\alpha k}}\n$$", "id": "2838550"}, {"introduction": "The final stage, \"escape,\" occurs when tumor variants arise that are no longer recognized or controlled by the immune system, often after a long period of equilibrium.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of a one-sided $p$-value using Fisher's exact test. This test is appropriate for analyzing contingency tables, particularly with small sample sizes, as it calculates the exact probability of observing the given data, or more extreme data, under the null hypothesis ($H_0$) that the row and column variables are independent. In this context, $H_0$ states there is no association between mutation type (nonsynonymous/synonymous) and MHC binding status (binder/non-binder).\n\nFirst, we must construct the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table from the given data and calculate the marginal totals. Let the rows represent the mutation type and the columns represent the MHC binding status.\n\n|               | Binders | Non-binders | Row Total |\n|---------------|---------|-------------|-----------|\n| Nonsynonymous | $a = 1$ | $b = 9$     | $a+b = 10$  |\n| Synonymous    | $c = 4$ | $d = 6$     | $c+d = 10$  |\n| Column Total  | $a+c = 5$ | $b+d = 15$    | $N = 20$    |\n\nThe total number of mutations is $N = 1+4+9+6 = 20$.\nThe row totals are the total number of nonsynonymous mutations ($10$) and synonymous mutations ($10$).\nThe column totals are the total number of mutations in binders ($5$) and non-binders ($15$).\n\nIn Fisher's exact test, we consider the marginal totals to be fixed. The probability of observing any specific table with these fixed marginals is given by the hypergeometric distribution. The probability of a table with cell counts $a, b, c, d$ is:\n$$ P(a, b, c, d) = \\frac{\\binom{a+b}{a}\\binom{c+d}{c}}{\\binom{N}{a+c}} = \\frac{\\binom{a+c}{a}\\binom{b+d}{b}}{\\binom{N}{a+b}} $$\nLet us use the standard formulation:\n$$ P(\\text{table}) = \\frac{(\\text{row 1 total})!

This corresponds to testing for a depletion of nonsynonymous mutations in the \"Binders\" category, which means we are interested in whether the observed value of $a=1$ is unusually small. The one-sided $p$-value is the sum of probabilities of observing the given table and all other possible tables that are even more extreme in supporting this alternative hypothesis. \"More extreme\" here means tables with a value of cell $a$ less than or equal to the observed value of $1$.\n\nGiven the marginals, the minimum possible value for $a$ is $\\max(0, (a+b)+(a+c)-N) = \\max(0, 10+5-20) = 0$. The maximum value is $\\min(a+b, a+c) = \\min(10, 5) = 5$.

If $a=0$, the other cells are determined by the fixed marginals: $c = 5-0=5$, $b = 10-0=10$, and $d = 10-5=5$. The counts are $a=0, b=10, c=5, d=5$.\n$$ P(a=0) = \\frac{\\binom{10}{0}\\binom{10}{5}}{\\binom{20}{5}} $$\nWe compute the new binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{10}{0} = 1$\n$\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 252$\nSo, the probability of this more extreme table is:\n$$ P(a=0) = \\frac{1 \\times 252}{15504} = \\frac{252}{15504} $$\n\nThe one-sided $p$-value is the sum of these probabilities:\n$$ p = P(a=1) + P(a=0) = \\frac{2100}{15504} + \\frac{252}{15504} = \\frac{2352}{15504} $$\nNow we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as required.\n$$ p \\approx 0.151702786... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.1517$.\nThis $p$-value of $0.1517$ is greater than conventional significance levels (e.g., $0.05$), so we would not reject the null hypothesis.
