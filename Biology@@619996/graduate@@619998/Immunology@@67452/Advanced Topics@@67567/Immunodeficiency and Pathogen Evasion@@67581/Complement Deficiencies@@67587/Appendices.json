The patient is not taking immunosuppressive drugs.\n- **Foundational Facts:**\n    1.  The classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways are distinct initiation routes.\n    2.  All three pathways converge at the formation of $C3$ convertases.\n    3.  The pathways subsequently form $C5$ convertases.\n    4.  The pathways share a common terminal pathway ($C5$ through $C9$) that assembles the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC).\n    5.  $\\mathrm{CH}50$ assay measures classical pathway–mediated hemolysis.\n    6.  $\\mathrm{AH}50$ assay measures alternative pathway–mediated hemolysis.\n    7.  Antigenic levels of $C3$ and $C4$ measure protein abundance, not function.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of clinical immunology and the pathophysiology of the complement system. The clinical presentation (recurrent *Neisseria* infections) and laboratory findings ($\\mathrm{CH}50$, $\\mathrm{AH}50$, $C3$, $C4$ levels) constitute a classic, well-documented scenario in immunodeficiency. The foundational facts provided are correct statements of complement biology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient, consistent data to allow for logical deduction of the most probable location of the defect within the complement cascade. A unique and meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The data are quantitative and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing critical information. The problem is valid. We will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to localize the complement defect based on the presented clinical and laboratory data. We will analyze the data in the context of the provided foundational facts.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Screening Assays:** The patient has an undetectable Total Classical Pathway Hemolytic Activity ($\\mathrm{CH}50$) and an undetectable Alternative Pathway Hemolytic Activity ($\\mathrm{AH}50$).\n    - The $\\mathrm{CH}50$ assay requires the functional integrity of the entire classical pathway: $C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, C2, C3$, and all terminal components ($C5, C6, C7, C8, C9$). A deficiency in any of these components will result in a very low or undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$.\n    - The $\\mathrm{AH}50$ assay requires the functional integrity of the alternative pathway: Factor D, Factor B, Properdin, $C3$, and all terminal components ($C5, C6, C7, C8, C9$). A deficiency in any of these will result in a low or undetectable $\\mathrm{AH}50$.\n\n2.  **Synthesize Findings:** Since both the $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$ are undetectable, the defect must lie in a component or set of components common to both pathways. Reviewing the pathway structure, the common components are $C3$ and the terminal pathway components, $C5$ through $C9$.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Common Pathway Components:**\n    - **$C3$ Component:** A deficiency of $C3$ would indeed abolish both $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$. However, the problem explicitly states that the antigenic level of $C3$ is within the reference interval. While a rare dysfunctional mutant protein with normal antigenic levels is a theoretical possibility, the absence of the protein is ruled out. More importantly, $C3$ deficiency leads to a broad spectrum of severe pyogenic infections, not just neisserial infections. Given the normal antigenic level, a primary defect in a downstream component is a more parsimonious explanation.\n    - **Terminal Pathway Components ($C5-C9$):** These components form the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which is the final effector mechanism responsible for lysing the target cells (sensitized sheep red blood cells in the $\\mathrm{CH}50$ assay; rabbit red blood cells in the $\\mathrm{AH}50$ assay). A deficiency in any single component from $C5$ to $C9$ will prevent the formation of a functional MAC. This would result in a failure of hemolysis in both assays, leading to undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$ values. This perfectly matches the laboratory data.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Upstream Pathway Components:**\n    - The problem states that the antigenic level of $C4$ is normal. $C4$ is part of the classical pathway. A deficiency in other early classical pathway components (e.g., $C1$, $C2$) would lead to an undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$ but would leave the alternative pathway intact, resulting in a normal $\\mathrm{AH}50$. This contradicts the data.\n    - Similarly, a defect in early alternative pathway components (e.g., Factor D, Properdin) would lead to an undetectable $\\mathrm{AH}50$ but a normal $\\mathrm{CH}50$. This also contradicts the data.\n    - Deficiency of regulatory factors like Factor H or Factor I leads to uncontrolled alternative pathway activation, causing consumption and therefore *low* levels of $C3$. The patient has a normal $C3$ level, ruling this out.\n\n5.  **Correlate with Clinical Presentation:** The patient's history of recurrent invasive *Neisseria meningitidis* infection is the hallmark clinical manifestation of deficiencies in the terminal complement pathway ($C5-C9$). The MAC is critically important for defense against encapsulated bacteria, particularly *Neisseria* species.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of Derivation:** The combination of undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$ with normal $C3$ and $C4$ levels, in a patient with recurrent neisserial infections, points unequivocally to a defect in one of the terminal complement components ($C5, C6, C7, C8,$ or $C9$). The logical next step is to measure the levels of these individual components to identify the specific deficiency. This can be done through antigenic assays (e.g., ELISA, immunonephelometry) or functional reconstitution assays, where purified individual components are added to the patient's serum to see which one restores hemolytic activity.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Early classical pathway deficiency (for example $C1q, C1r, C1s$, or $C2$); order antigenic assays for $C1q, C2,$ and $C4$ and expect isolated reduction of $\\mathrm{CH}50$ with normal $\\mathrm{AH}50$.**\nThis option claims the defect is in the early classical pathway. Such a defect would cause a low/undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$, but the $\\mathrm{AH}50$ would be normal. The patient's data shows an undetectable $\\mathrm{AH}50$. The reasoning presented in the option itself contradicts the patient's data.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Dysregulation of the alternative pathway due to deficiency of factor $H$ or factor $I$; order factor $H$, factor $I$, and $C3$ levels, anticipating secondary consumption with decreased $C3$.**\nThis option suggests a deficiency of regulatory proteins. Such a deficiency leads to unchecked activation of the alternative pathway, resulting in the consumption and depletion of $C3$. The problem states that the patient's $C3$ level is normal.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Terminal pathway deficiency ($C5$–$C9$); order antigenic assays for $C5, C6, C7, C8,$ and $C9$, and perform stepwise reconstitution hemolytic testing by adding purified individual terminal components to patient serum to identify the specific defective component.**\nThis option correctly localizes the defect to the terminal pathway ($C5-C9$). This localization is entirely consistent with all provided information: undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$, normal $C3$ and $C4$ levels, and a clinical history of recurrent neisserial infections. The proposed diagnostic plan—measuring individual terminal components—is the correct and standard approach to confirm and pinpoint the specific deficiency.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) pathway deficiency (MBL or MBL-Associated Serine Proteases, MASP); order MBL and MASP antigenic assays because lectin pathway defects typically abolish both $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$.**\nThe premise of this option is fundamentally flawed. An isolated MBL pathway deficiency does not cause undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$. The $\\mathrm{CH}50$ assay initiates complement via antibody-antigen complexes, bypassing the MBL pathway. The $\\mathrm{AH}50$ assay tests the alternative pathway, which is also independent of MBL.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Alternative pathway assembly defect due to factor $D$ or properdin deficiency; order factor $D$ and properdin levels because these defects typically reduce both $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$ with normal $C3$ and $C4$.**\nThe primary effect of a Factor D or properdin deficiency is an undetectable $\\mathrm{AH}50$. It does not abolish the $\\mathrm{CH}50$, which is initiated independently by the classical pathway. The statement that these defects \"typically reduce both $\\mathrm{CH}50$ and $\\mathrm{AH}50$\" is misleading. An undetectable $\\mathrm{CH}50$ is not the expected finding.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2842690"}, {"introduction": "Building on diagnostic localization, this problem delves into the quantitative biochemical consequences of a component deficiency.

It is also produced by the catalytic action of the convertase $c$ on C3 at a rate $k_{c} c$. It is consumed during the formation of convertase $c$ at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{form}} b$. Upon decay of the convertase $c$, one molecule of $b$ is returned to the pool, resulting in a source term $k_{d} c$. Finally, $b$ is inactivated by Factor I at a rate $k_{i} b$. Combining these terms gives the rate of change for $b$:\n    $$ \\frac{db}{dt} = k_{f} w + k_{c} c - k_{\\mathrm{form}} b + k_{d} c - k_{i} b $$\n    Grouping the terms by variable yields:\n    $$ \\frac{db}{dt} = k_{f} w - (k_{\\mathrm{form}} + k_{i}) b + (k_{c} + k_{d}) c $$\n\nThe complete system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = k_{t} x_{0} - k_{dw} w \\\\\n\\frac{db}{dt} = k_{f} w - (k_{\\mathrm{form}} + k_{i}) b + (k_{c} + k_{d}) c \\\\\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{form}} b - k_{d} c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNext, we solve for the steady-state concentrations ($w_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, $b_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, $c_{\\mathrm{ss}}$) by setting the time derivatives to zero.\n\nFrom the first equation, $\\frac{dw}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ k_{t} x_{0} - k_{dw} w_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0 \\implies w_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{t} x_{0}}{k_{dw}} $$\n\nFrom the third equation, $\\frac{dc}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{form}} b_{\\mathrm{ss}} - k_{d} c_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0 \\implies c_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{form}}}{k_{d}} b_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\n\nNow, substitute these expressions for $w_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ into the second equation at steady state, $\\frac{db}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ k_{f} \\left(\\frac{k_{t} x_{0}}{k_{dw}}\\right) - (k_{\\mathrm{form}} + k_{i}) b_{\\mathrm{ss}} + (k_{c} + k_{d}) \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{form}}}{k_{d}} b_{\\mathrm{ss}}\\right) = 0 $$\nWe solve for $b_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{f} k_{t} x_{0}}{k_{dw}} = b_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left[ (k_{\\mathrm{form}} + k_{i}) - \\frac{(k_{c} + k_{d}) k_{\\mathrm{form}}}{k_{d}} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{f} k_{t} x_{0}}{k_{dw}} = b_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left[ k_{\\mathrm{form}} + k_{i} - \\frac{k_{c} k_{\\mathrm{form}}}{k_{d}} - k_{\\mathrm{form}} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{f} k_{t} x_{0}}{k_{dw}} = b_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left[ k_{i} - \\frac{k_{c} k_{\\mathrm{form}}}{k_{d}} \\right] = b_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left[ \\frac{k_{i} k_{d} - k_{c} k_{\\mathrm{form}}}{k_{d}} \\right] $$\nA stable, non-negative steady state requires the amplification loop to be under control, which means the term in brackets must be positive: $k_{i} k_{d} - k_{c} k_{\\mathrm{form}} > 0$.
