The mother is confirmed by sequencing to be heterozygous for a known pathogenic BTK variant (a known carrier), and the pedigree shows no male-to-male transmission, consistent with X-linked inheritance. Assume the father is an unaffected male without the familial BTK variant. XLA is fully penetrant in hemizygous males (probability of clinical disease given hemizygous male is $1$), while heterozygous females are almost always clinically unaffected; however, due to extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation, a heterozygous female manifests clinically with probability $p = 0.01$. The mother is currently pregnant. A non-invasive prenatal test for fetal sex (Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT)) reports “male.” For a “male” call, the test has sensitivity $S_{e} = 0.995$ and specificity $S_{p} = 0.990$ with respect to true fetal sex.

The probability of clinical disease given a hemizygous male genotype is $1$.\n    - A heterozygous female manifests clinically with probability $p = 0.01$.\n- **Prior Probabilities**:\n    - The prior probability of a male birth is $r = P(\\text{Fetus is male}) = 0.512$.\n- **Diagnostic Test (NIPT) for Fetal Sex**:\n    - The test result is \"male\".\n    - For a \"male\" call, the sensitivity is $S_{e} = 0.995$.\n    - For a \"male\" call, the specificity is $S_{p} = 0.990$.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    - Independent meioses.\n    - Independent test performance.\n    - No male-to-male transmission.\n    - Complete penetrance in hemizygous males.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of human genetics (X-linked inheritance), immunology (primary B cell defects), and medical diagnostics (NIPT performance metrics). The gene (BTK), the disease (XLA), and the concepts of sensitivity, specificity, and penetrance are all standard and factually correct within the domain of medical science. The provided numerical values are plausible for biological and diagnostic contexts.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and relationships to calculate the requested posterior probability. The question is specific and unambiguous. A unique, stable solution can be derived using standard probability theory, specifically Bayes' rule.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language. It is free of subjective claims, pseudoscience, or speculative assertions. The interpretation of sensitivity and specificity, while requiring care, is standard in diagnostic testing: sensitivity is the true positive rate, and specificity is the true negative rate.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability that the fetus will be clinically affected with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, given that a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) reported the fetal sex as \"male\".\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $M$: The fetus is a true biological male.\n- $F$: The fetus is a true biological female.\n- $A$: The fetus is clinically affected with XLA.\n- $T_{M}$: The NIPT result is \"male\".\n\nWe are asked to find the conditional probability $P(A | T_{M})$. Using the definition of conditional probability, this is:\n$$\nP(A | T_{M}) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T_{M})}{P(T_{M})}\n$$\n\nWe will calculate the numerator and the denominator separately using the law of total probability, partitioning the sample space by the sex of the fetus ($M$ and $F$).\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities related to the NIPT. The givens are:\n- Prior probability of a male fetus: $P(M) = r = 0.512$.\n- Prior probability of a female fetus: $P(F) = 1 - r = 1 - 0.512 = 0.488$.\n- Sensitivity of the \"male\" test: $S_{e} = P(T_{M} | M) = 0.995$. This is the probability of a \"male\" call given the fetus is male.\n- Specificity of the \"male\" test: $S_{p} = P(T_{F} | F) = 0.990$, where $T_F$ is the event of a \"female\" call. This is the probability of a \"female\" call given the fetus is female (true negative rate for a \"male\" test).\n- From specificity, we deduce the false positive rate for a \"male\" call: $P(T_{M} | F) = 1 - P(T_{F} | F) = 1 - S_{p} = 1 - 0.990 = 0.010$.\n\nNow, we calculate the denominator, $P(T_{M})$, the total probability of a \"male\" NIPT result:\n$$\nP(T_{M}) = P(T_{M} | M)P(M) + P(T_{M} | F)P(F)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nP(T_{M}) = (0.995)(0.512) + (0.010)(0.488) = 0.50944 + 0.00488 = 0.51432\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the conditional probabilities of the fetus being clinically affected, given its sex. Let $X^{a}$ denote the X chromosome carrying the pathogenic BTK variant and $X^{A}$ denote the normal allele.\n- The mother is a carrier with genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$.\n- The father is unaffected with genotype $X^{A}Y$.\n\nFrom Mendelian genetics for an X-linked trait:\n- For a male fetus, the possible genotypes are $X^{A}Y$ and $X^{a}Y$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Since XLA is fully penetrant in males, a male with genotype $X^{a}Y$ will be affected.\nThus, the probability of a male fetus being affected is:\n$$\nP(A | M) = P(\\text{genotype } X^{a}Y | M) \\times (\\text{penetrance}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = 0.5\n$$\n- For a female fetus, the possible genotypes are $X^{A}X^{A}$ and $X^{A}X^{a}$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Only heterozygous females ($X^{A}X^{a}$) are at risk. The problem states they manifest clinically with probability $p = 0.01$.\nThus, the probability of a female fetus being affected is:\n$$\nP(A | F) = P(\\text{genotype } X^{A}X^{a} | F) \\times P(\\text{manifests} | X^{A}X^{a}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.01 = 0.005\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the numerator, $P(A \\cap T_{M})$. We again use the law of total probability, partitioning by sex:\n$$\nP(A \\cap T_{M}) = P(A \\cap T_{M} | M)P(M) + P(A \\cap T_{M} | F)P(F)\n$$\nThe state of being affected ($A$) depends on the genotype, while the test result ($T_M$) depends on the presence of Y-chromosome material. These events are conditionally independent given the sex of the fetus. Therefore, $P(A \\cap T_{M} | M) = P(A | M)P(T_{M} | M)$ and $P(A \\cap T_{M} | F) = P(A | F)P(T_{M} | F)$.\nThe expression for the numerator becomes:\n$$\nP(A \\cap T_{M}) = P(A | M)P(T_{M} | M)P(M) + P(A | F)P(T_{M} | F)P(F)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nP(A \\cap T_{M}) = (0.5)(0.995)(0.512) + (0.005)(0.010)(0.488)\n$$\n$$\nP(A \\cap T_{M}) = 0.25472 + 0.0000244 = 0.2547444\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the desired posterior probability $P(A | T_{M})$:\n$$\nP(A | T_{M}) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T_{M})}{P(T_{M})} = \\frac{0.2547444}{0.51432} \\approx 0.495299\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nP(A | T_{M}) \\approx 0.4953\n$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the fetus is clinically affected with XLA, given the \"male\" NIPT result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4953}\n$$", "id": "2882580"}, {"introduction": "Beyond genetic risk, a key part of diagnosing B cell defects is the functional assessment of humoral immunity.

The CVID population is partitioned into two mutually exclusive subgroups, severe ($C_S$) and moderate ($C_M$).
