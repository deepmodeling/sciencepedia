This first exercise provides a quantitative framework for estimating the rate at which this material is produced by a pathogen. By integrating principles of molecular genetics—such as codon structure and degeneracy—with population parameters like mutation bias, you will calculate the expected number of potentially antigen-altering (nonsynonymous) mutations per genome, providing a first-principles estimate of a pathogen's capacity for rapid evolution [@problem_id:2834030].", "problem": "A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus relies on antigenic variation driven by amino acid substitutions in its surface glycoprotein. Consider a strain with a single long open reading frame of length $L = 1.10 \\times 10^{4}$ nucleotides that is translated in-frame with no overlaps. The per-site, per-replication mutation probability is $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}$. Assume that each site experiences at most one point mutation per replication and ignore insertion-deletion events.\n\nUnder the standard genetic code, whether a point mutation is synonymous or nonsynonymous depends on codon position and degeneracy at the third codon position. Empirical codon-usage analysis for this virus shows that among third positions, the fraction that are fourfold-degenerate is $f_{4} = 0.58$, twofold-degenerate is $f_{2} = 0.35$, and nondegenerate is $f_{0} = 0.07$, with $f_{4} + f_{2} + f_{0} = 1$.

Express the final expected count as a decimal number and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the expected number of nonsynonymous mutations per genome per replication. This quantity, denoted $E[N_{ns}]$, is the product of the total number of nucleotides in the open reading frame, $L$, the per-site mutation probability, $\\mu$, and the genome-averaged probability that a random point mutation is nonsynonymous, $P(ns)$.\n$$E[N_{ns}] = L \\mu P(ns)$$\nThe central task is to derive $P(ns)$ from the provided information.\n\nThe open reading frame is composed of codons, each three nucleotides long. Mutations can occur at the first, second, or third codon position. Assuming mutations are distributed uniformly across the genome, the probability of a mutation occurring at any of the three positions is equal, i.e., $P(\\text{pos 1}) = P(\\text{pos 2}) = P(\\text{pos 3}) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, $P(ns)$ can be decomposed into contributions from each codon position:\n$$P(ns) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(ns | \\text{pos } i) P(\\text{pos } i) = \\frac{1}{3} (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)$$\nwhere $S_i = P(ns | \\text{pos } i)$ is the probability that a mutation is nonsynonymous, given it occurred at codon position $i$.\n\nThe provided empirical quantities $s_1 = 0.96$ and $s_2 = 1.00$ represent the \"fraction of single-nucleotide changes that are nonsynonymous\". This phrasing refers to the outcome of observed mutation events, which are subject to inherent mutation biases. Therefore, these values must be interpreted as the bias-weighted probabilities $S_1$ and $S_2$. Any other interpretation, for example treating them as unweighted averages over all three possible nucleotide changes at a site, would lead to an underspecified problem for $S_1$, as it would be impossible to deconvolve the separate contributions of transitions and transversions without additional information. We proceed with the only logical interpretation that renders the problem solvable.\nThus, we have:\n$S_1 = s_1 = 0.96$\n$S_2 = s_2 = 1.00$. The value $S_2=1$ is consistent with the biological fact that any nucleotide change at the second codon position alters the encoded amino acid.\n\nThe probability $S_3$ must be derived from first principles using the provided information about codon degeneracy and mutation bias. $S_3$ is the weighted average of the probability of a nonsynonymous mutation across the different types of third-position sites:\n$$S_3 = f_4 P(ns | \\text{pos 3, 4-fold}) + f_2 P(ns | \\text{pos 3, 2-fold}) + f_0 P(ns | \\text{pos 3, non-deg})$$\nwhere $f_4=0.58$, $f_2=0.35$, and $f_0=0.07$ are the fractions of third-position sites that are fourfold-degenerate, twofold-degenerate, and nondegenerate, respectively.\n\n1.  At a fourfold-degenerate site, any change of the third nucleotide is synonymous by definition. Therefore, $P(ns | \\text{pos 3, 4-fold}) = 0$.\n2.  At a nondegenerate site, any change of the third nucleotide is nonsynonymous by definition. Therefore, $P(ns | \\text{pos 3, non-deg}) = 1$.\n3.  At a twofold-degenerate site, the outcome of a mutation depends on whether it is a transition or a transversion. We must account for the transition-to-transversion bias, $\\kappa = 2.5$.\n\nLet $p_{ts}$ be the probability that a given mutation is a transition, and $p_{tv}$ be the probability that it is a transversion. At any site, there is one possible transition and two possible transversions. Given a transition rate $k_{ts}$ and a per-transversion rate $k_{tv}$, the ratio is defined as $\\kappa = k_{ts}/k_{tv}$. The total mutation rate is $\\mu = k_{ts} + 2k_{tv}$.\nThe conditional probabilities are:\n$$p_{ts} = \\frac{k_{ts}}{k_{ts} + 2k_{tv}} = \\frac{\\kappa k_{tv}}{\\kappa k_{tv} + 2k_{tv}} = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa + 2}$$\n$$p_{tv} = \\frac{2k_{tv}}{k_{ts} + 2k_{tv}} = \\frac{2k_{tv}}{\\kappa k_{tv} + 2k_{tv}} = \\frac{2}{\\kappa + 2}$$\nIn the standard genetic code, at a twofold-degenerate third position, the single possible transition is always synonymous, while the two possible transversions are always nonsynonymous.\nTherefore, the probability of a nonsynonymous mutation at a twofold-degenerate site is:\n$$P(ns | \\text{pos 3, 2-fold}) = P(ns|ts)p_{ts} + P(ns|tv)p_{tv} = (0)p_{ts} + (1)p_{tv} = \\frac{2}{\\kappa + 2}$$\nSubstituting the values into the expression for $S_3$:\n$$S_3 = (0.58)(0) + (0.35)\\left(\\frac{2}{2.5 + 2}\\right) + (0.07)(1) = 0.35 \\left(\\frac{2}{4.5}\\right) + 0.07 = 0.35 \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right) + 0.07$$\n$$S_3 = \\frac{1.4}{9} + 0.07 = \\frac{1.4}{9} + \\frac{0.63}{9} = \\frac{2.03}{9}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the overall probability $P(ns)$:\n$$P(ns) = \\frac{1}{3} (S_1 + S_2 + S_3) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(0.96 + 1.00 + \\frac{2.03}{9}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(1.96 + \\frac{2.03}{9}\\right)$$\n$$P(ns) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1.96 \\times 9 + 2.03}{9}\\right) = \\frac{1}{27} (17.64 + 2.03) = \\frac{19.67}{27}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the expected number of nonsynonymous mutations per genome per replication using the given values $L = 1.10 \\times 10^{4}$ and $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}$:\n$$E[N_{ns}] = L \\mu P(ns) = (1.10 \\times 10^{4}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\left(\\frac{19.67}{27}\\right)$$\n$$E[N_{ns}] = (0.22) \\left(\\frac{19.67}{27}\\right) = \\frac{4.3274}{27} \\approx 0.16027407...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.1603$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1603}\n$$", "id": "2834030"}, {"introduction": "The emergence of a new mutation is only the first step; its fate is determined by population-level forces that dictate whether it is lost or maintained as standing variation.

The problem is valid, as it is grounded in established principles of population genetics and all necessary parameters and definitions are provided.\n\nFirst, the derivation from first principles.\nLet $N_e$ be the effective population size of the diploid organism. The total number of alleles at the locus in the population is $2N_e$. Let $G_t$ be the probability of homozygosity at generation $t$, defined as the probability that two alleles sampled randomly from the population are identical by state. The quantity of interest, heterozygosity $H_t$, is related by $H_t = 1 - G_t$. We will derive a recurrence relation for $G_t$ to find its equilibrium value.\n\nIn the Wright–Fisher model, the alleles of generation $t+1$ are sampled with replacement from the alleles of generation $t$. Consider two alleles sampled in generation $t+1$. There are two mutually exclusive events regarding their immediate ancestry:\n1. They are copies of a single parental allele from generation $t$. The probability of this event is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, their ancestors are necessarily identical.\n2. They are copies of two distinct parental alleles from generation $t$.

Let $\\mu$ be the per-allele mutation rate per generation. For two alleles to be identical by state, they must descend from identical ancestral alleles and neither must have undergone mutation. The probability that a single allele does not mutate is $1-\\mu$. The probability that neither of the two alleles mutate is $(1-\\mu)^2$.\n\nCombining these, the recurrence relation for homozygosity becomes:\n$$G_{t+1} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)G_t \\right] (1 - \\mu)^2$$\nAt equilibrium, the genotypic frequencies are stable, so $G_{t+1} = G_t = \\hat{G}$.\n$$\\hat{G} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)\\hat{G} \\right] (1 - \\mu)^2$$\nThe problem specifies a \"small-mutation regime,\" which implies that the mutation rate $\\mu$ is very small ($\\mu \\ll 1$).

There is a $2$-fold drop in the polyclonal neutralization titer, which indicates that epitope disruption is occurring. However, the drop in the $\\text{HI}$ titer ($4$-fold) is disproportionately larger. This discrepancy coincides with a $2$-fold increase in avidity. The data suggest that the total $4$-fold $\\text{HI}$ drop is a composite effect: a $2$-fold drop from epitope disruption (as measured by the $\\mathrm{FRNT}_{50}$) and an additional $2$-fold drop from the increased avidity. The question asks for substitutions that *primarily* mediate escape via epitope disruption. Since the avidity increase has an effect of the same magnitude as the epitope disruption on the $\\text{HI}$ titer, it cannot be said that epitope disruption is the primary mechanism. The escape phenomenon has two significant contributing factors.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

There is no change in receptor-binding avidity. This profile, like that of K166N, is a clear and unambiguous signature of antigenic escape caused by epitope disruption. The location of the mutation near the Sa site and the corresponding $16$-fold drop in the mAb-Sa $\\mathrm{FRNT}_{50}$ titer (from $1600$ to $100$) provide further support for this conclusion.\n*   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, substitutions K166N and G158E exhibit proportional drops in $\\text{HI}$ and $\\mathrm{FRNT}_{50}$ titers with no significant change in avidity, fitting the definition of antigenic escape via epitope disruption. Substitution Q226L shows an avidity-driven phenotype. Substitution E190D shows a hybrid phenotype where epitope disruption is not the primary mechanism. Therefore, only substitutions K166N and G158E satisfy the problem's criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2834099"}]}
