The concept of a \"glycan shield\" and its role in epitope occlusion is a central tenet in the field. The numerical values provided are biologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-defined. It requests the calculation of an expected value under clear probabilistic assumptions (Bernoulli trials, independence). A unique, stable solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific terminology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of glycans on a single Env trimer. This can be solved using the properties of expectation, specifically the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable, $X_{i,j}$, for the event that a glycan is present at a specific site. Let $i$ be the index for the potential glycosylation site on a given protomer, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 28\\}$, and let $j$ be the index for the protomer within the trimer, where $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe variable $X_{i,j}$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_{i,j} = \\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if site } i \\text{ on protomer } j \\text{ is occupied by a glycan} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if site } i \\text{ on protomer } j \\text{ is unoccupied}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that the probability of any given site being occupied is $p = 0.85$. Therefore, the probability distribution of $X_{i,j}$ is a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$.\n$$\nP(X_{i,j} = 1) = p = 0.85\n$$\n$$\nP(X_{i,j} = 0) = 1 - p = 0.15\n$$\nThe expected value of a Bernoulli random variable is simply the probability of success. Thus, the expected value of $X_{i,j}$ is:\n$$\nE[X_{i,j}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{i,j} = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{i,j} = 0) = p = 0.85\n$$\nThe total number of glycans on the Env trimer, which we denote as $N_{trimer}$, is the sum of the occupancies of all possible sites across all three protomers. The total number of potential sites on the trimer is $N_{total} = N_{protomers} \\times N_{sites} = 3 \\times 28 = 84$.\n$$\nN_{trimer} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{28} X_{i,j}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the expected number of glycans per trimer, which is $E[N_{trimer}]$. A fundamental property of expectation is its linearity: the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$\nE[N_{trimer}] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{28} X_{i,j}\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{28} E[X_{i,j}]\n$$\nSince the expected value $E[X_{i,j}]$ is the same for all sites and all protomers ($E[X_{i,j}] = p = 0.85$), we can simplify the sum. The sum consists of $N_{total} = 84$ identical terms.\n$$\nE[N_{trimer}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{84} p = 84 \\cdot p\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nE[N_{trimer}] = 84 \\times 0.85 = 71.4\n$$\nThis value is already given to three significant figures.\n\nMechanistic explanation:\nThe high density of N-linked glycans on the HIV-1 Env trimer forms a physical barrier known as the \"glycan shield.\" These carbohydrate molecules are large and flexible, projecting from the viral protein surface. B cell receptors (BCRs) and the antibodies they produce are also large protein complexes. The glycan shield sterically occludes, or hides, the underlying protein epitopes on the Env surface from recognition and binding by these immune molecules. Because the glycans are synthesized by the host cell's machinery, they are recognized as \"self\" and are non-immunogenic. This allows the virus to camouflage its foreign protein antigens under a cloak of host-like molecules, thus evading the humoral immune response.\n\nCaveats introduced by incomplete occupancy and heterogeneity:\n1.  **Incomplete Occupancy**: The occupancy probability of $p = 0.85$ implies that, on average, $15\\%$ of potential N-linked glycosylation sites are unoccupied. These unoccupied sites create \"holes\" or gaps in the glycan shield, exposing patches of the underlying protein. These exposed regions could potentially serve as epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. However, the high mutation rate of HIV-1 allows the virus to rapidly alter the positions of its glycosylation sites, effectively moving these holes and escaping any antibody response that might develop against them.\n2.  **Site Heterogeneity**: The problem simplifies reality by assuming a uniform glycan type. In fact, N-linked glycans undergo differential processing in the host cell Golgi apparatus, resulting in site-specific microheterogeneity. A single glycosylation site can be occupied by various glycan structures (e.g., high-mannose, complex, or hybrid types), each with different sizes, shapes, and flexibility. This structural diversity makes the glycan shield a non-uniform, heterogeneous surface, further complicating the challenge for B cells to produce broadly effective antibodies that can navigate this landscape to reach conserved protein epitopes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{71.4}\n$$", "id": "2867364"}, {"introduction": "Beyond passive shielding, HIV-1 employs active sabotage of the host's antigen presentation pathway, a feat orchestrated by the accessory protein Negative factor (Nef).

AP-1 is involved in sorting at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. AP-2 is involved in endocytosis from the plasma membrane.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established mechanisms of HIV-1 immunoevasion, specifically the multiple trafficking-related functions of the Nef protein. The experimental data provided are consistent with known literature: wild-type Nef robustly downregulates CD4 and selectively downregulates HLA-A and HLA-B while sparing HLA-C. The phenotype of the unknown mutant—selective loss of HLA-A/B downregulation with preserved CD4 downregulation—is a distinct and mechanistically informative result. The problem provides sufficient information and principles to logically deduce the identity of the mutation from the given options. The problem setup is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or otherwise flawed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Analysis of the Experimental Phenotype**\n\nThe objective is to identify a mutation in Nef that accounts for the observed experimental data. We must first precisely define the phenotype of the unknown mutant relative to the wild-type protein.\n1.  **Wild-type Nef function:** The data confirm that wild-type Nef performs two primary downregulation functions in this system:\n    -   It strongly downregulates surface CD4 (from 100% to 28%).\n    -   It selectively downregulates surface HLA-A and HLA-B (to 38% and 45%, respectively) while largely sparing HLA-C (96%).\n2.  **Unknown Mutant Nef function:** The data for the mutant show a dissociation of these two functions:\n    -   The ability to downregulate CD4 is preserved; the surface level is reduced to 30%, a value comparable to the wild-type effect (28%).\n    -   The ability to downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B is almost completely abolished; surface levels remain high at 92% and 90%, respectively, which are very near the control level of 100%. HLA-C remains unaffected (98%), as expected.\n\nTherefore, the causal mutation must be one that specifically abrogates the molecular mechanism responsible for HLA-A/B downregulation while leaving the mechanism for CD4 downregulation functionally intact.\n\n**Mechanistic Basis of Nef-Mediated Downregulation**\n\nThe problem statement directs us to consider the roles of adaptor protein complexes. The mechanisms for CD4 and HLA-I downregulation by Nef are distinct and rely on different motifs within Nef interacting with different adaptor complexes.\n\n-   **CD4 Downregulation:** Nef enhances the endocytosis of CD4 from the cell surface. It acts as a connector, linking the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 to the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex. This interaction is primarily mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif (LL) in the C-terminal flexible loop of Nef. Mutation of this dileucine motif disrupts Nef-AP-2 binding and selectively impairs CD4 downregulation.\n\n-   **HLA-A/B Downregulation:** Nef prevents the transit of newly synthesized HLA-A and HLA-B molecules to the cell surface by re-routing them from the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) to the endo-lysosomal pathway for degradation. Nef connects the cytoplasmic tails of HLA-A/B to the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex at the TGN. This interaction is critically dependent on an acidic cluster motif (EEEE) in the N-terminal region of Nef. Mutation of this acidic cluster disrupts Nef-AP-1 binding and selectively impairs HLA-A/B downregulation.\n\n-   **Membrane Association:** For Nef to perform any of its functions involving membrane-bound receptors (CD4, HLA-I) and membrane-associated trafficking machinery (AP-1, AP-2), it must first be anchored to cellular membranes. This is achieved via N-terminal myristoylation at glycine residue 2 (G2).\n\nWith these principles, we can evaluate each option.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. N-terminal myristoylation site mutant G2A (abolishes membrane attachment)**\nThis mutation prevents the attachment of myristate, a lipid anchor. The resulting Nef protein is soluble in the cytosol and cannot associate with the plasma membrane or Golgi membranes. Without membrane localization, Nef cannot access its targets (CD4, HLA-I) or the relevant adaptor complexes. Consequently, a G2A mutant is incompetent for *both* CD4 downregulation and HLA-A/B downregulation. The experimental data show that CD4 downregulation is intact. This option is therefore inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Acidic cluster mutant at residues 62–65 (EEEE → AAAA)**\nThis mutation disrupts the AP-1 binding site on Nef. As the Nef-AP-1 interaction is essential for diverting HLA-A and HLA-B from the TGN, this mutant would lose the ability to downregulate these molecules. Surface expression of HLA-A and HLA-B would remain high. However, CD4 downregulation, which depends on the AP-2 adaptor binding to the dileucine motif elsewhere on Nef, would be unaffected. This predicted phenotype—loss of HLA-A/B downregulation with preservation of CD4 downregulation—precisely matches the experimental data (HLA-A/B > 90%, CD4 ≈ 30%).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Dileucine sorting motif mutant at residues 164/165 (LL → AA)**\nThis mutation disrupts the AP-2 binding site on Nef. The Nef-AP-2 interaction is required for enhanced endocytosis of CD4. Therefore, this mutant would lose the ability to downregulate CD4. Surface expression of CD4 would remain high. The mechanism for HLA-A/B downregulation, which depends on the acidic cluster and AP-1, would remain intact. This predicts the opposite phenotype to what was observed: preservation of HLA-A/B downregulation and loss of CD4 downregulation. This is inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding proline-rich motif mutant P72A/P75A**\nThis proline-rich motif (PxxP) mediates interactions with SH3 domains of cellular signaling proteins, such as Src-family tyrosine kinases (e.g., Hck). These interactions are involved in altering T cell activation signaling pathways to promote viral replication but are not directly required for the downregulation of CD4 or HLA-I via clathrin adaptor pathways. A mutation in this domain would primarily affect signaling functions, while the protein trafficking functions would be expected to remain largely intact. The phenotype would approximate that of wild-type Nef in this assay (downregulation of both CD4 and HLA-A/B). This does not match the specific loss of HLA-A/B downregulation seen in the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2867422"}, {"introduction": "The battle between HIV-1 and the host unfolds deep within the infected cell, in a molecular arms race between viral proteins and host restriction factors.

Of these, $1,150$ are guanosine-to-adenosine ($G\\rightarrow A$) transitions, accounting for a fraction of $1,150/1,840 \\approx 0.625$, or $62.5\\%$. The control experiment states that viruses with effective Vif function exhibit a baseline $G\\rightarrow A$ rate of less than $10\\%$. The observed rate of $62.5\\%$ is substantially higher than this baseline. Furthermore, the observation of a subset of sequences with clustered $G\\rightarrow A$ mutations (hypermutation) is a classic signature of APOBEC3 activity. Effective Vif function suppresses APOBEC3 packaging and subsequent hypermutation. Therefore, the high frequency of $G\\rightarrow A$ mutations and the presence of hypermutated genomes are strong evidence that Vif function is ineffective or absent in the viral population sampled. The lack of a similar pattern for $C\\rightarrow T$ changes confirms that the mutational pressure is specific to the minus-strand DNA intermediate, which is the substrate for APOBEC3 enzymes.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Dinucleotide Context Preference**:\n    APOBEC3 enzymes deaminate cytidine (C) to uracil (U) on the single-stranded minus-sense viral cDNA. During the synthesis of the plus-sense DNA strand, this U is read as a thymidine (T), and an adenosine (A) is incorporated opposite it. The original C on the minus-strand corresponds to a G on the plus-strand, so the net result is a $G\\rightarrow A$ transition in the final proviral DNA. Different APOBEC3 family members have distinct sequence context preferences for the target cytidine. We must determine if the observed data match a known enzymatic signature.\n\n    The analysis focuses on the $5'$-neighbor of the mutated G on the plus-strand. We calculate the expected number of mutations for each context based on the genomic background frequencies, assuming no bias, and compare it to the observed numbers. The total number of $G\\rightarrow A$ events is $1,150$.\n\n    -   **Context $5'$-G (plus-strand $GG \\rightarrow AG$)**:\n        -   Background frequency of $GG$ dinucleotides (where a G could be a target): $f(GG) = 0.18$.\n        -   Expected number of mutations: $1,150 \\times 0.18 = 207$.\n        -   Observed number of mutations: $805$.\n        -   The ratio of observed to expected is $805 / 207 \\approx 3.89$. This indicates a strong enrichment for mutations in this context. A $GG \\rightarrow AG$ plus-strand signature corresponds to deamination of C in a 5'-CC-3' context on the minus-strand, which is the hallmark of APOBEC3G (A3G).\n\n    -   **Context $5'$-A (plus-strand $GA \\rightarrow AA$)**:\n        -   Background frequency of $GA$: $f(GA) = 0.21$.\n        -   Expected number of mutations: $1,150 \\times 0.21 = 241.5$.\n        -   Observed number of mutations: $230$.\n        -   The ratio of observed to expected is $230 / 241.5 \\approx 0.95$. There is no enrichment; the observed frequency is consistent with the genomic background. A $GA \\rightarrow AA$ plus-strand signature corresponds to deamination of C in a $5'$-TC-$3'$ context on the minus-strand, which is the hallmark of APOBEC3F (A3F).\n\n    -   **Contexts $5'$-C and $5'$-T**:\n        -   For $GC$: Expected = $1,150 \\times 0.31 = 356.5$. Observed = $60$. Strong depletion.\n        -   For $GT$: Expected = $1,150 \\times 0.30 = 345$. Observed = $55$. Strong depletion.\n\n    The quantitative analysis demonstrates an overwhelming bias for $G\\rightarrow A$ mutations to occur in a $5'$-G context. This is the specific signature of APOBEC3G activity. The signature for APOBEC3F is absent. Other potential mechanisms like RT error are explicitly ruled out by the problem statement as lacking strong context bias, and CTL selection is a selective, not a mutational, force and cannot explain the specific biochemical signature of hypermutation.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Vif function is ineffective or absent, allowing APOBEC3G activity to dominate; cytidine deamination on the minus-strand cDNA produces plus-strand $G\\rightarrow A$ transitions enriched at plus-strand $5'$-G contexts (i.e., $GG\\rightarrow AG$), consistent with APOBEC3G’s preference for cytidines in 5'-CC-3' motifs on the minus-strand.**\n- This statement is fully consistent with the analysis. The high $G\\rightarrow A$ rate and hypermutation indicate ineffective Vif. The dramatic enrichment of mutations in the $GG \\rightarrow AG$ context ($805$ observed vs. $207$ expected) correctly identifies APOBEC3G as the dominant enzyme. The option correctly links the plus-strand observation ($GG \\rightarrow AG$) to the established minus-strand molecular mechanism (5'-CC-3' preference of A3G).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Vif function is fully effective; the enrichment of $G\\rightarrow A$ at plus-strand $5'$-G (i.e., $GG\\rightarrow AG$) reflects an intrinsic bias of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase independent of strand-specific deamination, and clustering arises from RT processivity errors.**\n- This statement is incorrect. The assertion of \"fully effective\" Vif is contradicted by the high $G\\rightarrow A$ rate ($62.5\\% > 10\\%$) and hypermutation. The problem statement explicitly notes that RT \"does not strongly favor a particular dinucleotide context,\" contradicting the claim that RT bias is the cause.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Vif function is ineffective, but the data are best explained by APOBEC3F, whose hallmark is enrichment of plus-strand $GA\\rightarrow AA$; the observed $GG\\rightarrow AG$ predominance is an expected variant of this signature.**\n- This statement is incorrect. While it correctly identifies Vif as ineffective, it misattributes the mutational signature. The hallmark of APOBEC3F ($GA \\rightarrow AA$) is not enriched in the data (observed $230$ vs. expected $241.5$). The claim that the predominant $GG \\rightarrow AG$ signature is a \"variant\" of the A3F signature is biologically false; they are distinct signatures corresponding to different enzymes (A3G and A3F, respectively).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Vif function is intact; the pattern is driven by cytotoxic T lymphocyte selection for amino acid changes within epitopes, which specifically favors $G\\rightarrow A$ in $GG$ contexts on the plus-strand, and the strand asymmetry is incidental.**\n- This statement is incorrect. The claim of intact Vif is contradicted by the data. Attributing the pattern to CTL selection is implausible, as selection acts on the protein level and cannot explain a genome-wide, specific dinucleotide mutational bias and catastrophic hypermutation. The statement that strand asymmetry is \"incidental\" ignores a key mechanistic clue pointing directly to the APOBEC3 pathway.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Vif function is partially effective, yielding a mixed APOBEC3G/APOBEC3F signature; therefore, one should observe roughly even enrichment across $GG\\rightarrow AG$ and $GA\\rightarrow AA$, rather than a strong skew toward one context.**\n- This statement is incorrect. Its premise leads to a conclusion that is falsified by the data. If a mixed signature were present, one would expect to see enrichment for both the A3G ($GG \\rightarrow AG$) and A3F ($GA \\rightarrow AA$) contexts. The data show strong enrichment for only the A3G signature and no enrichment for the A3F signature. The skew is strongly toward one context, not \"roughly even.\"\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2867405"}]}
