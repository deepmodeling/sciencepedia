The provided data for the HIV-1 genome length and reverse transcriptase error rate are consistent with established biological literature. The modeling approach, using a sum of Bernoulli trials and its approximation by a Poisson distribution for rare events over many trials, is a standard and correct application of probability theory. Thus, the problem is valid and can be solved from first principles as requested.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of nucleotide bases in the HIV-1 genome, and let $p$ be the per-base point mutation probability per replication cycle.\nThe given values are:\n- Genome length, $N = 9.7 \\times 10^{3}$.\n- Mutation probability, $p = 3 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nFollowing the first principle provided, we model the occurrence of a mutation at each of the $N$ bases as an independent Bernoulli trial.

By the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations.\n$$\n\\lambda = E[K] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p = Np\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\lambda = (9.7 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-5}) = 29.1 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.291\n$$\nThis is the expected number of mutations per cycle.\n\nAccording to the second principle provided, for a large number of trials ($N = 9700$ is large) and a small probability of success in each trial ($p = 3 \\times 10^{-5}$ is small), the distribution of the sum $K$ (which is formally a binomial distribution $B(N, p)$) can be accurately approximated by a Poisson distribution with a mean $\\lambda = Np$.\nThus, we model the random variable $K$ as following a Poisson distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, with $\\lambda = 0.291$.
