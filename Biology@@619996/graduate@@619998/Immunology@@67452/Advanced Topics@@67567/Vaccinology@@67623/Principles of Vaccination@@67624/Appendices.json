This foundational exercise challenges you to build the classic herd immunity equation from first principles, starting with only the definitions of the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and vaccine efficacy ($E$). Mastering this derivation solidifies your understanding of how individual-level vaccine effects scale to create population-level protection against pathogen invasion. [@problem_id:2884807]", "problem": "A directly transmitted pathogen is introduced into a large host population with homogeneous mixing, where the disease dynamics can be modeled by a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) framework at the time of introduction. The pathogen in a fully susceptible population has a basic reproduction number (denoted $R_0$) that is constant and independent of vaccination. A vaccine is rolled out before introduction with coverage fraction $c$ and is of the leaky type: each vaccinated individual’s susceptibility to infection is reduced by a constant vaccine efficacy $E$ with $0<E<1$, while infectiousness and duration of infection are unaffected for any breakthrough infections.\n\nUsing only the following foundational elements:\n- The definition of the basic reproduction number (denoted $R_0$) as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population.\n- The definition of the effective reproduction number (denoted $R_e$) at introduction as the expected number of secondary cases in the actual population state, which under homogeneous mixing equals $R_0$ multiplied by the average susceptibility of the population relative to a fully susceptible baseline.\n- The invasion criterion that a pathogen cannot invade when $R_e<1$.\n\nDerive from first principles the minimal vaccine coverage $c^{*}$ required to prevent invasion.

Do not round; provide the exact simplified expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimal vaccine coverage, denoted $c^*$, required to prevent the invasion of a pathogen into a population. The derivation must proceed from the foundational principles provided.\n\nLet the total population be normalized to $1$. The population is partitioned into two groups: vaccinated and unvaccinated. The fraction of the population that is vaccinated is given by the coverage $c$. Consequently, the fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is $1-c$.\n\nThe vaccine is of the leaky type with efficacy $E$, where $0 < E < 1$. This means the susceptibility of a vaccinated individual is reduced by a factor of $E$ compared to an unvaccinated individual. Let the susceptibility of an unvaccinated individual be the baseline, normalized to $s_{unvac} = 1$. The susceptibility of a vaccinated individual, $s_{vac}$, is therefore:\n$$ s_{vac} = 1 - E $$\n\nThe problem states that the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, at the time of introduction is given by the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, multiplied by the average susceptibility of the population. We must first compute this average susceptibility, which we denote as $\\bar{s}$. The average susceptibility is the weighted average of the susceptibilities of the vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations, where the weights are their respective fractions in the total population.\n$$ \\bar{s} = (1-c) \\cdot s_{unvac} + c \\cdot s_{vac} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $s_{unvac}$ and $s_{vac}$:\n$$ \\bar{s} = (1-c) \\cdot 1 + c \\cdot (1-E) $$\nDistributing the terms, we get:\n$$ \\bar{s} = 1 - c + c - cE $$\n$$ \\bar{s} = 1 - cE $$\nThis expression represents the average susceptibility of the population relative to a fully susceptible baseline.\n\nNow, we use the provided definition for the effective reproduction number, $R_e$:\n$$ R_e = R_0 \\cdot \\bar{s} $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\bar{s}$:\n$$ R_e = R_0 (1 - cE) $$\n\nThe problem provides the invasion criterion: a pathogen cannot invade if $R_e < 1$. To prevent invasion, we must ensure this condition is met. The minimal vaccine coverage, $c^*$, required to prevent invasion corresponds to the critical threshold where the system is at the boundary of invasion, i.e., where $R_e=1$. Any coverage $c > c^*$ will result in $R_e < 1$.\n\nWe set the expression for $R_e$ to $1$ and solve for the coverage, which we will label $c^*$:\n$$ R_0 (1 - c^*E) = 1 $$\n\nTo solve for $c^*$, we perform algebraic manipulation. First, we divide both sides by $R_0$. This is permissible as for an epidemic to be a concern, we must have $R_0 > 1$, so $R_0 \\neq 0$.\n$$ 1 - c^*E = \\frac{1}{R_0} $$\nNext, we isolate the term containing $c^*$:\n$$ c^*E = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} $$\nTo simplify the right-hand side, we find a common denominator:\n$$ c^*E = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0} $$\nFinally, we divide by the vaccine efficacy $E$ to solve for $c^*$. Since the problem states $0 < E < 1$, $E$ is non-zero.\n$$ c^* = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{E R_0} $$\nThis expression is the derived closed-form analytic expression for the minimal vaccine coverage required to prevent pathogen invasion, expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the vaccine efficacy $E$. This result is contingent on the assumption that an epidemic is possible in an unvaccinated population, i.e., $R_0 > 1$.

Vaccination reduces the average susceptibility. We must calculate this reduction for each model.\n\n**Analysis of the All-or-None Model**\nIn the all-or-none model, the population is partitioned. A fraction $1-c$ is unvaccinated and has susceptibility $1$. A fraction $c$ is vaccinated. Within this vaccinated group, a fraction $\\text{VE}_S$ is fully protected (susceptibility $0$) and a fraction $1-\\text{VE}_S$ is not protected (susceptibility $1$).\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}$, is the weighted average over these sub-populations:\n$$s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}(c) = (1-c) \\cdot 1 + c \\cdot \\left[ (1-\\text{VE}_S) \\cdot 1 + \\text{VE}_S \\cdot 0 \\right]$$\n$$s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}(c) = 1-c + c(1-\\text{VE}_S) = 1-c+c-c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S$$\n$$s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}(c) = 1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S$$\nThe effective reproduction number for the all-or-none model is therefore:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{AoN}}(c) = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S)$$\nThe herd-immunity threshold, $c^{\\ast}$, is the minimum coverage $c$ for which $R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{AoN}}(c) \\leq 1$. We solve for the boundary case $R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{AoN}}(c^{\\ast}) = 1$:\n$$R_0 (1 - c^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{VE}_S) = 1$$\n$$1 - c^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{VE}_S = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{VE}_S = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{\\text{VE}_S}$$\nSubstituting the given values $R_0 = 5$ and $\\text{VE}_S = 0.8$:\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{5}}{0.8} = \\frac{1 - 0.2}{0.8} = \\frac{0.8}{0.8} = 1$$\nThus, for the all-or-none model, the required coverage to achieve herd immunity is $c^{\\ast} = 1.0$.\n\n**Analysis of the Leaky Model**\nIn the leaky model, a fraction $1-c$ of the population is unvaccinated (susceptibility $1$). The entire fraction $c$ of vaccinated individuals has their susceptibility reduced to $1-\\text{VE}_S$.\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $s_{\\text{avg, Leaky}}$, is:\n$$s_{\\text{avg, Leaky}}(c) = (1-c) \\cdot 1 + c \\cdot (1-\\text{VE}_S)$$\n$$s_{\\text{avg, Leaky}}(c) = 1-c + c - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S = 1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S$$\nFor the purpose of calculating the population-level average susceptibility, the two models are equivalent.

The only value of $c$ in the allowed domain $c \\in [0,1]$ that satisfies this condition is $c=1$. There exists no value of $c$ in the interval $[0,1)$ that suffices to bring the effective reproduction number to $1$ or below.\nThis critical case arises because the parameters are chosen such that $R_0(1-\\text{VE}_S) = 5(1-0.8) = 5(0.2) = 1$. This means that even if the entire population is vaccinated ($c=1$), each infected individual still produces, on average, one new infection, and the epidemic can persist. To achieve epidemic control ($R_{\\text{eff}} < 1$), one would require a vaccine with higher efficacy or a pathogen with lower transmissibility, such that $R_0(1-\\text{VE}_S) < 1$.\nSince no $c < 1$ exists that satisfies the condition, the indicator variable $I$ is $0$.\n\nThe final requested quantities are $c^{\\ast} = 1.0$ and $I=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2543611"}, {"introduction": "While our epidemiological models rely on parameters like vaccine efficacy, the biological basis of this protection is often a complex, multivariate signature.

Including confounders as unpenalized covariates is correct (Principle vi).\n- **Validation:** Nested cross-validation is the gold standard for hyperparameter tuning and obtaining an unbiased estimate of model performance (Principle iv). Stratification is a good practice for maintaining data structure in folds. Using the held-out test set for final, one-time validation is the correct procedure.\n- **CoP Definition:** Defining the CoP from the model's linear predictor is a standard and valid approach.\n- **Herd Immunity:** The proposal correctly links the model's output—a distribution of protection levels across individuals—to a population-level epidemiological calculation, accounting for heterogeneity. This is a principled extension from individual risk to public health planning.\n\n**Verdict on A:** **Correct**. This pipeline adheres to all stated first principles and represents a state-of-the-art approach.\n\n**B. Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the full dataset (including the held-out test set) to reduce dimensionality by retaining the principal components explaining $95\\%$ of variance, then apply linear discriminant analysis with forward stepwise selection on these components using all $n = 400$ participants. Use the resubstitution error to select the final discriminant function, interpret the first principal component loading vector as the correlate of protection, and, for herd immunity, use the mean antibody titer among vaccinees to estimate the population protection regardless of heterogeneity in other omics.**\n\nThis option contains multiple, severe methodological flaws.\n- **Data Leakage:** Performing PCA on the full dataset ($n=400$), including the test set, constitutes data leakage. The principal components, which form the new feature space for the model, are derived using information from the test data. This violates the sanctity of the test set (related to Principle v).\n- **Training on Test Data:** Building the final model using all $n=400$ participants means there is no independent test set for evaluation.\n- **Improper Performance Metric:** Using \"resubstitution error\" (i.e., error on the training data) to select a model is a classic error that leads to overfitting and gives a highly optimistic, biased measure of performance. This violates Principle (iv), which requires cross-validation for out-of-sample performance estimation.\n- **Incorrect CoP Interpretation:** The first principal component simply captures the axis of maximal variance in the predictor data; it is an unsupervised measure and has no guaranteed relationship with the outcome (protection). It cannot be interpreted as a CoP.\n- **Oversimplified Herd Immunity:** Ignoring the multivariate signature and heterogeneity in favor of a simple mean antibody titer contradicts the study's primary objective and the problem's explicit instructions.\n\n**Verdict on B:** **Incorrect**. This pipeline is fundamentally flawed and violates multiple principles of valid statistical modeling.\n\n**C. Fit separate least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regressions within each modality using all participants to select features; take the intersection of selected features across the three modalities and refit an unregularized logistic regression on the full dataset with those features. Define the correlate of protection as the maximum single antigen titer among the $p_{\\text{ser}} = 5$ serological measures, and set the herd immunity threshold by adopting a fixed antibody titer cutoff from a different population, without re-estimation.**\n\nThis option also has critical errors.\n- **Training on Test Data:** Using \"all participants\" for both feature selection and refitting the final model invalidates the evaluation process.\n- **Flawed Integration Strategy:** Taking the intersection of features is a poor integration strategy. A feature might be predictive in only one modality, and taking the intersection would discard it. The intersection could even be empty.\n- **Ignoring Multivariate Goal:** Defining the CoP as a single antigen titer completely abandons the stated central goal of finding an *integrated, multivariate* correlate.\n- **Unprincipled Generalization:** Applying a CoP cutoff from a different population without any validation or calibration is scientifically unsound and ignores context-specificity.\n\n**Verdict on C:** **Incorrect**. This approach violates the data splitting protocol, employs a questionable feature integration strategy, and fails to address the core objectives of the study.\n\n**D. Fit a ridge-penalized logistic regression on the concatenated features without standardizing features, choose the regularization parameter by minimizing the training loss, and define the correlate of protection as the linear combination that maximizes a pseudo-$R^2$ on the training data. For herd immunity planning, use the classical threshold $1 - 1/R_0$ for vaccination coverage, assuming it does not depend on heterogeneity in vaccine-induced protection or on the biomarker distribution.**\n\nThis option demonstrates a misunderstanding of how regularized regression works.\n- **No Standardization:** Failing to standardize features of different scales (e.g., gene expression counts vs. antibody titers) before applying ridge regression is a critical mistake. The penalty will be applied inequitably, making the model's coefficients dependent on arbitrary units rather than effect size.\n- **Improper Hyperparameter Tuning:** Choosing the regularization parameter to minimize *training loss* is incorrect. This would always favor $\\lambda \\to 0$ (i.e., no regularization), leading to a non-regularized, overfit model. Hyperparameters must be tuned based on out-of-sample performance, e.g., via cross-validation (violates Principle iv). Optimizing a metric on training data is equally wrong.\n- **Oversimplified Herd Immunity:** Using the classical formula $1 - 1/R_0$ assumes a \"leaky\" or all-or-nothing vaccine with uniform efficacy and ignores the rich information about heterogeneous protection that the multivariate model is supposed to provide. This contradicts the herd immunity goal specified in the problem statement.\n\n**Verdict on D:** **Incorrect**. The proposed pipeline is flawed in its application of regularization and its oversimplified approach to the herd immunity calculation.\n\n**E. Use stacked generalization: within the training set, for each modality separately, fit a regularized logistic regression (for example, elastic net) to produce out-of-fold predicted probabilities by $K$-fold cross-validation; standardize features and tune hyperparameters strictly within folds. Fit a second-stage logistic LASSO to the out-of-fold predictions from the three base models plus the raw serology features, with age and prior exposure entered unpenalized. Tune the second-stage penalty by nested cross-validation and evaluate final performance on the held-out test set to obtain a meta-level linear predictor as the multivariate correlate of protection. For herd immunity planning, integrate the distribution of predicted protection among vaccinees with a chosen $R_0$ to derive the minimum coverage required to drive the effective transmission potential below the epidemic threshold, accounting for heterogeneous protection.**\n\nThis option describes stacked generalization (stacking), another advanced and principled approach.\n- **Model Choice:** Stacking is a powerful ensemble method for integrating heterogeneous models or data sources.\n- **Data Handling:** The pipeline correctly describes how to generate inputs for the meta-learner: predictions for each data point must come from a model trained without that data point (\"out-of-fold predictions\"). This correctly avoids data leakage. Standardizing and tuning within folds is also correct (Principle v).\n- **Model Construction:** The two-stage process is well-defined. Base learners are trained on individual modalities, and a meta-learner combines their outputs. Using LASSO for the meta-learner and including confounders unpenalized is sound (Principles iii, vi).\n- **Validation:** nested cross-validation for tuning and a final evaluation on the held-out test set is a rigorous validation strategy (Principle iv).\n- **CoP Definition:** The linear predictor from the final meta-model serves as the integrated multivariate signature, fulfilling the study's objective.\n- **Herd Immunity:** The proposed connection to herd immunity is identical to that in option A and is the correct, principled approach that leverages the model's output.\n\n**Verdict on E:** **Correct**. This pipeline describes a valid, sophisticated, and principled workflow that is fully consistent with the provided first principles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and E describe methodologically sound and rigorous pipelines for achieving the study's objectives.
