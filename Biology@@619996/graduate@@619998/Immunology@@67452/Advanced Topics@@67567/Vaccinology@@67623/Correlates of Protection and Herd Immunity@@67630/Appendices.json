The transmission potential of a vaccinated infected individual, $T_{\\text{vac}}$, is therefore:\n$$T_{\\text{vac}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - VE_T)$$\nThe vaccination coverage is $c$, meaning a fraction $c$ of the population is vaccinated and a fraction $1-c$ is unvaccinated. Due to the assumption of random vaccination and homogeneous mixing, a randomly chosen infected individual has a probability $c$ of being vaccinated and $1-c$ of being unvaccinated.\n\nThe population-average transmission potential, $T_{\\text{avg}}$, is the weighted average of the transmission potentials of the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups:\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = (1-c) \\cdot T_{\\text{unvac}} + c \\cdot T_{\\text{vac}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_{\\text{vac}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = (1-c) \\cdot T_{\\text{unvac}} + c \\cdot [T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - VE_T)]$$\nFactor out $T_{\\text{unvac}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} \\left[ (1-c) + c(1 - VE_T) \\right]$$\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} [1 - c + c - c \\cdot VE_T]$$\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - c \\cdot VE_T)$$\nThe effective reproduction number $R_e$ is $R_0$ scaled by the ratio of the current average transmission potential $T_{\\text{avg}}$ to the baseline potential $T_{\\text{unvac}}$:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\frac{T_{\\text{avg}}}{T_{\\text{unvac}}} = R_0 \\frac{T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - c \\cdot VE_T)}{T_{\\text{unvac}}}$$\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot VE_T)$$\nTo halt the epidemic spread, the effective reproduction number must be less than one, $R_e  1$.

For a robust schedule, we design it to satisfy $N(t) \\ge N_{min}$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$.\n\nThe dynamics of the titer are characterized by exponential decay between boosters and a multiplicative increase at the time of a booster. Let $\\Delta$ be the constant interval between boosters. Let $t_k$ be the time of the $k$-th booster. The titer just before the boost is $N(t_k^{-})$, and the titer just after is $N(t_k^{+}) = b N(t_k^{-})$, where $b  1$.\n\nIn any interval between boosters, $(t_k, t_{k+1})$, where $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta$, the titer decays according to first-order kinetics:\n$$\nN(t) = N(t_k^{+}) \\exp(-\\lambda (t-t_k))\n$$\nSince $\\lambda  0$, the function $N(t)$ is monotonically decreasing in this interval.
