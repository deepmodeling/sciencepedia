In the rolling-probe model of solvent exposure used in structural vaccinology, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of a residue is determined by the surface area that remains accessible to a spherical solvent probe of radius $r_p$ as it rolls over the protein. Model each targeted residue as a sphere of effective radius $r_i$ (representing the local side-chain envelope). The maximum solvent-exposed area for a fully exposed residue is the surface area of a sphere of radius $R_i = r_i + r_p$. In the intact trimer, local occlusion by neighboring protein elements and glycan shielding reduce exposure. Let $f_i$ be the fraction of surface points occluded by protein-protein contacts and $g_i$ be the fraction occluded by glycans, and assume these two processes act independently so that the accessible fraction is $a_i = (1 - f_i)(1 - g_i)$. Thus the SASA of residue $i$ is $A_i = 4 \\pi R_i^2 a_i$.\n\nIn systems vaccinology, the initial B cell receptor (BCR) engagement potential of a neutralizing epitope can be proxied by a weighted accessibility index $E = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i A_i$, where $w_i$ are paratope complementarity weights inferred from deep mutational scanning of antibody contact preferences and normalized so that $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i = 1$.\n\nFor a solvent probe radius $r_p = 0.14$ nm, compute the weighted accessibility index $E$ in nm$^2$ for the following residues, and then briefly explain how accessibility mechanistically relates to immunogenicity and BCR engagement in the context of rational vaccine design.

An effective antibody response begins with the physical engagement of a B cell receptor (BCR) on a naive B cell with its cognate epitope on an antigen.\n1.  **BCR Engagement**: The BCR is a large, membrane-anchored antibody molecule. For binding to occur, the epitope must be physically accessible to the binding site (paratope) of the BCR. An epitope that is buried within the interior of a protein or sterically occluded by neighboring structural elements or post-translational modifications, such as dense glycosylation (a \"glycan shield\"), is inaccessible. Such an epitope is effectively invisible to the patrolling B cell repertoire.\n2.  **Immunogenicity**: An epitope's immunogenicity, its capacity to elicit an immune response, is therefore critically dependent upon its accessibility. A high solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) increases the probability of a stochastic encounter and successful binding event with a B cell bearing a complementary BCR. This binding, along with T cell help, triggers B cell activation, clonal expansion, and entry into the germinal center reaction, where affinity maturation and class switching occur, ultimately producing high-affinity secreted antibodies and memory B cells.\n3.  **Rational Vaccine Design**: The principle of \"epitope focusing\" in rational vaccine design leverages this mechanism. Scientists aim to engineer immunogens that present conserved, neutralizing epitopes with maximal accessibility. Conversely, immunodominant but non-neutralizing or strain-specific epitopes may be deliberately occluded or removed. The metric $E$ calculated in this problem is a quantitative proxy for this \"immunogenic potential.\" It refines the simple SASA concept by weighting the contribution of each residue's accessibility ($A_i$) by its importance to antibody binding ($w_i$), providing a more sophisticated tool for computationally evaluating and optimizing vaccine candidates before expensive and time-consuming experimental testing. By maximizing this index for a target neutralizing epitope, one aims to direct the immune response toward producing the desired functional antibodies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.129}$$", "id": "2892930"}, {"introduction": "While antibody responses are critical, many modern vaccines also aim to elicit robust T-cell immunity.

Therefore, the total receptor occupancy is approximately proportional to this sum:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{total}} \\approx \\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}} $$\nTo compare the relative Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement between the two cohorts, we can compute and compare a \"Binding Score,\" $S$, for each cohort, where $S = \\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}}$.\n\nFirst, let us tabulate the dissociation constants ($K_d$ in $\\mathrm{nM}$) for all IgG species.\n-   IgG1: $K_{d,1}^{\\text{fuc}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,1}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{3000}{20} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   IgG3: $K_{d,3}^{\\text{fuc}} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,3}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{1500}{20} = 75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   IgG2: $K_{d,2}^{\\text{fuc}} = 25000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,2}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{25000}{10} = 2500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   IgG4: $K_{d,4}^{\\text{fuc}} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,4}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{10000}{10} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nNext, we calculate the concentrations of each IgG species for each cohort, based on the total concentration $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{total}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\n**Cohort A Calculations:**\n-   IgG1 ($60\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.60 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 6\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afucosylated (afuc): $[\\text{IgG1, afuc}]_A = 0.20 \\times 6\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Fucosylated (fuc): $[\\text{IgG1, fuc}]_A = 0.80 \\times 6\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG3 ($20\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.20 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG3, afuc}]_A = 0.40 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Fuc: $[\\text{IgG3, fuc}]_A = 0.60 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG2 ($15\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.15 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG2, afuc}]_A = 0.05 \\times 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG4 ($5\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.05 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG4, afuc}]_A = 0.10 \\times 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe Binding Score for Cohort A ($S_A$) is the sum of each species' concentration divided by its $K_d$. We ignore the fucosylated IgG2 and IgG4 as their contributions are minimal due to very high $K_d$ values.\n$$ S_A = \\frac{[\\text{IgG1, afuc}]_A}{K_{d,1}^{\\text{afuc}}} + \\frac{[\\text{IgG1, fuc}]_A}{K_{d,1}^{\\text{fuc}}} + \\frac{[\\text{IgG3, afuc}]_A}{K_{d,3}^{\\text{afuc}}} + \\frac{[\\text{IgG3, fuc}]_A}{K_{d,3}^{\\text{fuc}}} + \\dots $$\n$$ S_A \\approx \\frac{1.2}{150} + \\frac{4.8}{3000} + \\frac{0.8}{75} + \\frac{1.2}{1500} $$\n$$ S_A \\approx 0.00800 + 0.00160 + 0.01067 + 0.00080 \\approx 0.02107 $$\nThe dominant contributions come from afucosylated IgG3 ($0.01067$) and afucosylated IgG1 ($0.00800$).\n\n**Cohort B Calculations:**\n-   IgG1 ($70\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.70 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 7\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG1, afuc}]_B = 0.05 \\times 7\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Fuc: $[\\text{IgG1, fuc}]_B = 0.95 \\times 7\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 6.65\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG3 ($10\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.10 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG3, afuc}]_B = 0.10 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Fuc: $[\\text{IgG3, fuc}]_B = 0.90 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe Binding Score for Cohort B ($S_B$):\n$$ S_B = \\frac{[\\text{IgG1, afuc}]_B}{K_{d,1}^{\\text{afuc}}} + \\frac{[\\text{IgG1, fuc}]_B}{K_{d,1}^{\\text{fuc}}} + \\frac{[\\text{IgG3, afuc}]_B}{K_{d,3}^{\\text{afuc}}} + \\frac{[\\text{IgG3, fuc}]_B}{K_{d,3}^{\\text{fuc}}} + \\dots $$\n$$ S_B \\approx \\frac{0.35}{150} + \\frac{6.65}{3000} + \\frac{0.1}{75} + \\frac{0.9}{1500} $$\n$$ S_B \\approx 0.00233 + 0.00222 + 0.00133 + 0.00060 \\approx 0.00648 $$\n\n**Comparison of Engagement:**\nThe ratio of the binding scores provides the relative engagement:\n$$ \\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \\frac{0.02107}{0.00648} \\approx 3.25 $$\nThis result indicates that Cohort A will produce approximately $3.25$-fold higher Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement than Cohort B. This significant increase in receptor engagement is expected to result in substantially higher ADCC potential. The main drivers for this difference are the higher concentration of high-affinity IgG3 in Cohort A ($2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ vs $1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) and, critically, the much larger fraction of afucosylated IgG1 and IgG3, which possess $20$-fold higher affinity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\nA. Cohort A will produce approximately a $3$-fold higher Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement than Cohort B and thus higher ADCC, driven primarily by the higher IgG3 fraction and greater afucosylation of IgG1 and IgG3 in Cohort A at the same $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ antigen-specific IgG concentration.\n- Our calculation shows a $\\sim 3.25$-fold higher engagement for Cohort A, which is well-approximated by \"$3$-fold\". The predicted consequence of higher ADCC is correct. The reasoning—that the difference is driven by the superior IgG3 proportion and afucosylation levels in Cohort A—is fully supported by the breakdown of the binding scores. **Correct**.\n\nB. Cohort B will produce higher Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement than Cohort A because its higher IgG1 proportion dominates binding; differences in afucosylation are negligible at $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- Our calculation shows Cohort A has higher engagement, not Cohort B. The higher IgG1 proportion in B is insufficient to overcome the higher affinity profile of Cohort A. The statement that afucosylation differences are negligible is false; afucosylated species are the primary drivers of binding. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa is effectively saturated at $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ antigen-specific IgG regardless of subclass or glycoform, so both cohorts will have similar engagement and ADCC.\n- The total IgG concentration ($10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) is much lower than all relevant $K_d$ values (starting from $75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$). The receptor is far from saturated. Consequently, engagement is highly dependent on the antibody mixture, and the engagement is not similar between cohorts. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Cohort A will show only a modest increase (about $1.6$-fold) in Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement relative to Cohort B, mainly due to its higher IgG1 content rather than afucosylation, so ADCC will be only slightly higher in Cohort A.\n- The calculated increase is $\\sim 3.25$-fold, not a \"modest\" $1.6$-fold. Furthermore, Cohort A has a lower IgG1 content ($60\\%$) than Cohort B ($70\\%$), and the effect is driven primarily by afucosylation, contrary to what is stated. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Cohort A will have lower Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa binding than Cohort B because afucosylation reduces Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa affinity, leading to reduced ADCC in Cohort A.\n- Cohort A has higher, not lower, binding. The premise that afucosylation reduces affinity is fundamentally incorrect. Afucosylation reduces the dissociation constant $K_d$, which corresponds to an *increase* in affinity. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2892870"}]}
