Applying this to our two components, we have:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{lip}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{M_{\\mathrm{lip}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}}{M_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}} $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of the molar ratio $R$ gives:\n$$ R = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}} / M_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} / M_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}}{M_{\\mathrm{lip}}}\\right) $$\nThis expression shows that the molar ratio is the product of the mass ratio and the inverse molar mass ratio of the two components. We will now determine these two ratios from the information provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the mass ratio, $\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}}$. The problem states that the ionizable lipid constitutes a mass fraction $f_{\\mathrm{lip}} = 0.50$ of the combined mass of mRNA and ionizable lipid. This is expressed as:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{lip}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} + m_{\\mathrm{lip}}} $$\nGiven $f_{\\mathrm{lip}} = 0.50$, we have:\n$$ 0.50 = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} + m_{\\mathrm{lip}}} $$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator yields:\n$$ 0.50 \\times (m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} + m_{\\mathrm{lip}}) = m_{\\mathrm{lip}} $$\n$$ 0.50 \\times m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} + 0.50 \\times m_{\\mathrm{lip}} = m_{\\mathrm{lip}} $$\nSubtracting $0.50 \\times m_{\\mathrm{lip}}$ from both sides:\n$$ 0.50 \\times m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} = 0.50 \\times m_{\\mathrm{lip}} $$\nThis simplifies to $m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} = m_{\\mathrm{lip}}$. Therefore, the mass ratio is exactly unity:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lip}}}{m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}} = 1 $$\nNote that the total volume of the formulation, $V = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$, and the mRNA mass concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, which would yield a total mRNA mass of $m_{\\mathrm{mRNA}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$, are consistent with this but are not required for the calculation of the aformentioned ratio.\n\nSecond, we determine the molar mass of the mRNA molecule, $M_{\\mathrm{mRNA}}$. The problem gives the molar mass of the ionizable lipid as $M_{\\mathrm{lip}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The mRNA is a linear polymer with a transcript length of $L = 4000$ nucleotides. The average molar mass per ribonucleotide monomer is given as $M_{\\mathrm{nt}} = 330\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

You can use selective genetic or pharmacologic perturbations and pathway-resolved readouts. Practical constraints: primary human PBMCs are available from healthy donors; you can deplete specific cell subsets, apply small-molecule or oligonucleotide antagonists, deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA), and perform intracellular phospho-protein cytometry and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides a clear set of available methodologies. I will proceed with the evaluation of the proposed experimental designs.\n\nA successful design must adhere to several core principles:\n1. **Specificity of Perturbation**: Interventions must selectively target either the TLR7 or the RIG-I pathway with minimal off-target effects. Genetic knockdown or highly specific antagonists are superior to broad-spectrum inhibitors.\n2. **Proximity of Readout**: Measurements should be taken as close to the initial signaling event as possible to establish causality. This means assessing the activation of pathway-specific transcription factors (e.g., phosphorylation of Interferon Regulatory Factors, IRFs) or primary gene transcription (e.g., IFN subtype mRNA) rather than late, cumulative downstream effects.\n3. **Control of Confounding Factors**: The experiment must account for the heterogeneity of cell types in PBMCs and, crucially, must mitigate the influence of the type I IFN feedback loop, where secreted IFN binds to its receptor (IFNAR) and triggers a massive, non-specific amplification of hundreds of Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This is best achieved by analyzing responses at early time points.\n4. **Inclusion of Controls**: Appropriate positive and negative controls are necessary to validate that the perturbations are effective and that the signaling pathways are functional.\n\nBased on these principles, I will now analyze each option.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\n\nThis option proposes a multi-faceted approach.\n- **Perturbations**: It uses a highly specific oligonucleotide antagonist for TLR7, IRS661, which is an excellent choice for selective inhibition. It also suggests bafilomycin A1, which, while broader (inhibiting all endosomal acidification), is a standard tool. To inhibit the cytosolic pathway, it correctly proposes the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS), the essential downstream adaptor for all RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I. This is a specific and effective strategy.\n- **Controls**: It includes proper positive controls: a TLR7/8 agonist, resiquimod (R848), to validate the endosomal pathway inhibition, and a synthetic $5'$-triphosphate hairpin RNA to validate the cytosolic pathway inhibition.\n- **Readouts**: The chosen readouts are optimal for pathway deconvolution. Measuring early intracellular phosphorylation of Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7) versus Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) by flow cytometry directly assesses the activation of the key transcription factors. The TLR7-MyD88 pathway in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) predominantly activates IRF7, leading to interferon alpha (IFN-α) production, while the RIG-I-MAVS pathway predominantly activates IRF3 (and IRF7) via TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), preferentially driving interferon beta (IFN-β) production. Measuring IFN-α and IFN-β messenger RNA (mRNA) by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) serves as a direct readout of the transcriptional output of these pathways.\n- **Confounder Control**: Crucially, the design specifies analysis at \"early time points, before extensive paracrine feedback\" and within \"defined cell subsets (plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes)\". This correctly isolates the primary response from the confounding secondary amplification loop and accounts for the cell-type-specific expression of the sensors (e.g., high TLR7 in pDCs).\n\nThis design is comprehensive, rigorous, and directly addresses the problem's goal of causal deconvolution.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\n\n- **Perturbations**: This option uses chloroquine and the TBK1 inhibitor BX795. Chloroquine is a non-specific inhibitor of endosomal acidification, affecting TLR3, 7, 8, and 9, making it impossible to isolate the contribution of TLR7. BX795 inhibits TBK1, a kinase that is a convergence point for multiple innate sensing pathways, including not only RIG-I but also TLR3, TLR4 (via the TRIF adaptor), and some DNA sensing pathways. Its use does not permit specific attribution to RIG-I signaling.\n- **Readouts**: The readout is \"total secreted type I IFN protein\" at a \"single late time point\". This is fundamentally flawed. A late time point measures the cumulative effect of production and the massive signal amplification via the IFNAR feedback loop, making it impossible to trace the signal back to its origin. Measuring total type I IFN protein fails to distinguish between IFN-α and IFN-β, which are key differential outputs of the TLR7 and RIG-I pathways.\n\nThis design is plagued by non-specific inhibitors and a temporally and functionally unresolved readout, making it unsuitable for causal deconvolution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\n\n- **Perturbations**: It proposes TLR7 desensitization with a low dose of R848. While this is a known phenomenon (TLR tolerance), its completeness and specificity can be variable. More importantly, the readout is fundamentally misguided.\n- **Readouts**: It suggests measuring nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activity. While both TLR7 and RIG-I can activate NF-κB, the primary transcription factors driving type I IFN production are IRF3 and IRF7. Using NF-κB as a proxy for IFN is incorrect. Furthermore, using a co-cultured HEK293 reporter cell line introduces an unnecessary and confounding layer of complexity. The readout should be from the primary responding cells (PBMCs).\n- **Analysis**: The logic of attributing the remaining signal to RIG-I is an oversimplification, especially given that the readout (NF-κB) is not specific to interferon production.\n\nThis design fails by choosing an inappropriate readout that is not directly linked to the biological question of IFN production and by using an indirect co-culture system.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\n\n- **Perturbations**: It proposes inhibiting Janus kinase (JAK) signaling with ruxolitinib. JAKs are downstream of the IFNAR. Blocking them prevents the amplification loop. While this can be a useful tool to isolate the primary IFN production, it does not itself distinguish between the upstream sensors (TLR7 vs. RIG-I). The design then makes a critical error in its choice of readout.\n- **Readouts**: It proposes measuring a panel of $10$ ISGs at a \"late time point\". ISGs are products of the very feedback loop that ruxolitinib is supposed to block. Measuring ISGs to infer the initial trigger is logically flawed. If ruxolitinib works perfectly, ISG induction should be abrogated. If it works partially, the signal is still a convoluted downstream effect. The specified \"late time point\" further complicates interpretation. The note about depleting cells \"without phenotypic confirmation\" is an admission of poor experimental practice.\n\nThe logic of this experiment is circular. It blocks a pathway and then measures the output of that same pathway to draw conclusions about events far upstream.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option E**\n\n- **Perturbations**: This design uses irrelevant inhibitors. To inhibit endosomal sensing of ssRNA, it proposes a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) antagonist. TLR3 senses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), not the ssRNA stimulus of interest. To impair cytosolic sensing, it proposes melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) siRNA. MDA5 primarily senses long dsRNA, whereas RIG-I is the key sensor for the short, $5'$-triphosphate-bearing ssRNA that is a common contaminant in *in vitro* transcribed mRNA. While there can be overlap, ignoring the primary sensors TLR7 and RIG-I in favor of TLR3 and MDA5 is a fatal error in the design.\n- **Readouts**: The idea of comparing LNP delivery to cationic lipid transfection is sound, as is the measurement of phospho-IRF3 and phospho-IRF7. However, these sound components are rendered useless by the incorrect choice of inhibitors.\n\nThe entire experiment is based on targeting the wrong molecular sensors for the stimulus in question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nOption A is the only design that is methodologically sound, specific, and logically structured to achieve causal deconvolution of TLR7 versus RIG-I signaling in response to mRNA-LNPs. It employs specific perturbations, pathway-proximal readouts, and appropriate controls for confounding variables, representing the gold standard for this type of immunological investigation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2872447"}]}
