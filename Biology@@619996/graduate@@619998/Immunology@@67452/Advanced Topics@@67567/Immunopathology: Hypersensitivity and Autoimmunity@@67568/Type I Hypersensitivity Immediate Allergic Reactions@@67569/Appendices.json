In Type I hypersensitivity, antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to high-affinity receptors on tissue mast cells crosslinks upon antigen exposure, triggering degranulation and the release of vasoactive mediators such as histamine and tryptase, as well as lipid mediators and cytokines. The first-line pharmacologic intervention is epinephrine, which counteracts mediator-induced vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction via agonism at alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The mass-normalized pediatric intramuscular dosing principle for epinephrine is a widely adopted, well-tested rule: a fixed mass-specific dose is multiplied by body mass to obtain the total dose, and solution concentration is defined as amount per volume, which determines the injection volume by dimensional analysis.\n\nA $7$-year-old child weighs $25\\ \\text{kg}$.
