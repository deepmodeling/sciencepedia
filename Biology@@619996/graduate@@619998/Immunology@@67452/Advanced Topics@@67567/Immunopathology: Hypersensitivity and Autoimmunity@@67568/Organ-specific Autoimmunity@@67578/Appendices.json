It presents a simplified but mechanistically sound model of T cell repertoire selection and activation, suitable for mathematical analysis. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the naive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire consist of $N$ distinct clonotypes, where $N = 10^{8}$. We model the reactivity of each clonotype as an independent Bernoulli trial.\n\nFirst, consider the non-risk HLA background. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th clonotype, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The variable $X_i$ takes the value $1$ if the clonotype is insulin-reactive above the activation threshold, and $0$ otherwise.

The problem states that a risk HLA allele multiplicatively modifies the effective success probability from $p$ to a new probability $p'$. This occurs through three mechanistic levers:\n\n1.  **Increased peptide–HLA density (factor $a$)**: An increase in the density of a specific insulin-derived peptide presented on an HLA molecule raises the probability that a T cell with a potentially corresponding TCR will encounter its ligand. This directly scales the base probability of a productive engagement. The factor is given as $a = 3.5$.\n\n2.  **Reduced thymic negative selection stringency (factor $b$)**: Negative selection is the process by which self-reactive T cells are deleted in the thymus. A reduction in the stringency of this process means that a larger fraction of insulin-reactive T cells will survive and enter the peripheral naive pool. If the initial number of potential reactive cells is fixed, and the survival fraction for these cells is increased by a factor $b$, the resulting frequency of such cells in the naive repertoire will increase by the same factor. The factor is given as $b = 2.0$.\n\n3.  **Diminished peripheral tolerance (factor $c$)**: Peripheral tolerance mechanisms, such as suppression by regulatory T cells, prevent the activation of autoreactive T cells that have escaped thymic selection. A weakening of these mechanisms increases the probability that an encounter between an insulin-reactive T cell and its antigen will result in activation rather than anergy or suppression. This applies a further multiplicative scaling to the overall probability of a clonotype being \"reactive above activation threshold\". The factor is given as $c = 1.4$.\n\nThe problem states these factors combine multiplicatively to define the new per-clonotype probability, $p'$. Therefore:\n$$\np' = a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot p\n$$\nLet $Y_i$ be the indicator random variable for the $i$-th clonotype in the risk-allele background, with $Y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p')$.

The expected number, $E_{\\text{risk}}$, is calculated similarly:\n$$\nE_{\\text{risk}} = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[Y_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p' = Np'\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p'$, we get:\n$$\nE_{\\text{risk}} = N \\cdot (a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot p) = (N p) \\cdot a \\cdot b \\cdot c\n$$\nThis is equivalent to scaling the baseline expected count by the product of the risk factors.\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values provided:\n$N = 10^{8}$\n$p = 10^{-6}$\n$a = 3.5$\n$b = 2.0$\n$c = 1.4$\n\nFirst, calculate the product of the risk factors:\n$$\na \\cdot b \\cdot c = 3.5 \\times 2.0 \\times 1.4 = 7.0 \\times 1.4 = 9.8\n$$\nNow, we compute the final expected count, $E_{\\text{risk}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{risk}} = (10^{8}) \\cdot (10^{-6}) \\cdot (9.8) = 10^{2} \\cdot 9.8 = 100 \\times 9.8 = 980\n$$\nThe expected number of insulin-reactive-above-threshold clonotypes in the naive repertoire of an individual with the risk-allele background is $980$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{980}\n$$", "id": "2878869"}, {"introduction": "The culmination of an autoimmune response is tissue destruction, driven by effector immune cells that have infiltrated the target organ.
