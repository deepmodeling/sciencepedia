Do not include units in your final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is coherent and grounded in the fundamental principles of transport phenomena. It is well-posed and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed directly to the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a derivation of the cumulative transported mass, $M$, as a function of time, $t$; and second, a calculation of this mass for a specified set of experimental parameters.\n\nWe begin with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which states that the molar or mass flux, $J$, is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient, $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nHere, $J$ is the flux (mass per unit area per unit time), $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $C$ is the concentration of the diffusing substance. The coordinate $x$ is oriented perpendicular to the planar monolayer.\n\nThe problem specifies steady-state conditions, which implies that the flux $J$ is constant with respect to the position $x$ across the monolayer. Let the thickness of the monolayer be $h$. We can integrate Fick's law across the thickness of the barrier, from the luminal side ($x=0$) to the basolateral side ($x=h$):\n$$ \\int_0^h J \\,dx = \\int_{C_L}^{C_B} -D \\,dC $$\nSince $J$ and $D$ are constant with respect to $x$, this integration yields:\n$$ J \\int_0^h dx = -D \\int_{C_L}^{C_B} dC $$\n$$ J \\cdot h = -D (C_B - C_L) = D (C_L - C_B) $$\nIn this context, $C_L$ is the concentration on the luminal side and $C_B$ is the concentration on the basolateral side. The problem defines the concentration difference as $\\Delta C = C_L - C_B$, as transport occurs from the luminal to the basolateral compartment. The problem also specifies \"sink conditions\" in the basolateral compartment, which ensures that $C_B$ is negligible and $\\Delta C$ remains constant.\n\nRearranging the equation for flux, we get:\n$$ J = \\frac{D}{h} \\Delta C $$\nThe term $\\frac{D}{h}$ combines the properties of the diffusing substance ($D$) and the barrier ($h$) into a single parameter known as the permeability coefficient, or apparent permeability, $P$. Thus, we define $P \\equiv \\frac{D}{h}$. The expression for flux simplifies to:\n$$ J = P \\Delta C $$\nThis equation relates the mass flux directly to the permeability and the constant concentration difference across the monolayer.\n\nNext, we relate the flux to the total mass of the substance transported across the monolayer. The flux $J$ is the rate of mass transport per unit area. The total rate of mass transport, $\\frac{dM}{dt}$, across a monolayer of area $A$ is therefore the product of the flux and the area:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = J \\cdot A $$\nSubstituting the expression for flux, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = P \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C $$\nThe problem states that the apparent permeability $P$, the area $A$, and the concentration difference $\\Delta C$ are all constant over the duration of the experiment. Therefore, the rate of mass transport $\\frac{dM}{dt}$ is constant. To find the cumulative mass $M$ transported over a time interval $t$, we integrate this rate equation with respect to time from $0$ to $t$.\n$$ \\int_0^M dM' = \\int_0^t (P \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C) \\,dt' $$\nAssuming that at time $t=0$, the transported mass is $M(0)=0$, the integration yields the final derived expression:\n$$ M(t) = P \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C \\cdot t $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must calculate the numerical value of the transported mass. The given parameters are:\n- Apparent permeability $P = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$\n- Exposed area $A = 1\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$\n- Concentration difference $\\Delta C = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n- Duration $t = 30\\ \\mathrm{minutes}$\n\nBefore substituting these values into our derived formula, we must ensure all units are consistent. The permeability is given in SI-derived units with centimeters and seconds. We will convert all quantities to a consistent set of units.\nThe duration is given as $t = 30\\ \\mathrm{minutes}$. We convert this to seconds:\n$$ t = 30\\ \\mathrm{min} \\times \\frac{60\\ \\mathrm{s}}{1\\ \\mathrm{min}} = 1800\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThe concentration difference is given as $\\Delta C = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}$. The problem specifies to treat $1\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ as $1\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Delta C = 0.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}} $$\nNow all units are in the centimeter-gram-second system (or a variant thereof), with mass in milligrams. Let's substitute the numerical values into the expression for $M$:\n$$ M = (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}) \\cdot (1\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}) \\cdot (0.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/cm^3}) \\cdot (1800\\ \\mathrm{s}) $$\nWe check the unit cancellation: $(\\mathrm{cm/s}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{cm^2}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mg/cm^3}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{s}) = \\mathrm{mg}$. The resulting unit is milligrams, as expected for mass.\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ M = (1 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (1) \\cdot (0.5) \\cdot (1800)\\ \\mathrm{mg} $$\n$$ M = 900 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mg} $$\n$$ M = 9 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in micrograms ($\\mu\\mathrm{g}$).

Upon encountering antigens from the commensal microbiota in the gut, and in the absence of any regulatory population, these cells will differentiate into pathogenic effector T cells. Per principle (ii), these will be primarily $\\text{Th}1$ and $\\text{Th}17$ cells, producing high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$, $\\text{TNF}$, and $\\text{IL-}17\\text{A}$. This uncontrolled inflammation causes severe colitis, which manifests as progressive weight loss (cachexia), significant shortening of the colon, and a high histopathology score ($H$).\n\n**Arm 1: Co-transfer with Wild-Type (WT) Tregs**\nPrinciple (iii) states that Tregs suppress effector responses. By co-transferring WT Tregs, we introduce a potent regulatory mechanism. These Tregs will act to prevent the pathogenic differentiation and proliferation of the naive T cells. They achieve this by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like $\\text{IL-}10$ and $\\text{TGF-}\\beta$, by consuming the essential T cell growth factor $\\text{IL-}2$, and through other mechanisms. The expected outcome is the prevention of colitis. Mice should maintain body weight, have normal colon length, and a very low histology score $H$. The cytokine profile will be shifted from pro-inflammatory to regulatory, with low levels of $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$, $\\text{IL-}17\\text{A}$, and $\\text{TNF}$, and high levels of $\\text{IL-}10$ and $\\text{TGF-}\\beta$. The transferred $\\text{Foxp}3^{+}$ Tregs will persist and expand, so their frequency among donor $\\text{CD}4^{+}$ T cells will be high (at or above the initial $50\\%$).\n\n**Arm 2: Co-transfer with $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs**\nThis arm tests the importance of a specific Treg suppressive molecule, $\\text{IL-}10$. According to principle (iii), $\\text{IL-}10$ is a major mechanism of suppression. In the context of gut inflammation, Treg-derived $\\text{IL-}10$ is known to be particularly critical and non-redundant. While these $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs can still use other mechanisms like $\\text{TGF-}\\beta$ production and $\\text{IL-}2$ consumption, the loss of $\\text{IL-}10$ severely cripples their ability to control mucosal inflammation. Therefore, protection will be lost. The outcome will be similar to the baseline condition: development of severe colitis with weight loss, colon shortening, high $H$, and high levels of $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$, $\\text{IL-}17\\text{A}$, and $\\text{TNF}$. Some $\\text{TGF-}\\beta$ may still be produced by the $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs, but it will be insufficient to prevent disease.\n\n**Arm 3: Co-transfer of WT Tregs into $\\text{LysM-Cre } Il10ra^{fl/fl}$ Recipients**\nThis arm tests which cells need to *respond* to $\\text{IL-}10$ for suppression to be effective. The $\\text{LysM-Cre}$ system deletes the $\\text{IL-}10$ receptor ($\\text{Il10ra}$) on myeloid cells, which include macrophages and dendritic cells. These myeloid cells are key players in driving T cell responses by presenting antigens and producing inflammatory cytokines. $\\text{IL-}10$ acts on these cells to dampen their inflammatory activity. In this setup, the WT Tregs produce $\\text{IL-}10$, but their primary target cells (myeloid cells) in the recipient are unable to receive the signal. Consequently, the myeloid cells remain in a pro-inflammatory state, continue to produce cytokines like $\\text{TNF}$, and effectively activate the naive T cells, overriding the suppressive attempts of the Tregs. Protection will be abrogated. Mice will develop severe colitis. The hallmark of this group is the paradoxical combination of severe inflammation (high $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$, $\\text{TNF}$, high $H$) *despite* the presence of high levels of $\\text{IL-}10$ in the tissue (produced by the functional WT Tregs, but unable to act on its target).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Co-transfer of wild-type Tregs prevents cachexia and colon shortening, yields low $H$, increases the frequency of donor Foxp$3^{+}$ cells, and shifts mucosal cytokines toward high IL-$10$ and TGF-$\\beta$ with concomitant decreases in IFN-$\\gamma$, IL-$17$A, and TNF. $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs fail to protect: mice lose weight, exhibit short colons, high $H$, and retain high IFN-$\\gamma$/IL-$17$A/TNF despite some TGF-$\\beta$.

Co-transfer of wild-type Tregs accelerates disease by depriving conventional T cells of IL-$2$, resulting in compensatory skewing to Th$17$; animals exhibit earlier weight loss, high $H$, increased IL-$17$A, and unchanged IL-$10$. $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs are more protective than wild-type because IL-$10$ impairs Treg survival in lymphopenia. Myeloid IL-$10$ receptor status in recipients does not influence outcomes.**\n    *   The premise that Treg-mediated $\\text{IL-}2$ consumption accelerates disease is fundamentally incorrect; it is a suppressive mechanism. The claim that $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs are more protective is contrary to established evidence. The claim that myeloid $\\text{IL-}10$ receptor status is irrelevant is also incorrect.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Co-transfer of wild-type Tregs does not change disease incidence but converts a Th$1$-dominant colitis into a Th$17$-dominant colitis due to TGF-$\\beta$ provided by Tregs; IFN-$\\gamma$ decreases, IL-$17$A increases, TNF and IL-$10$ are unchanged, with no effect on weight or $H$. $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs protect equivalently because TGF-$\\beta$ suffices. Myeloid IL-$10$ receptor deficiency in recipients partially reduces protection but most mice remain healthy.**\n    *   The premise that WT Tregs do not change disease incidence is false; they prevent it. The claim that they simply skew the response without providing protection is incorrect. The idea that $\\text{TGF-}\\beta$ alone is sufficient and $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs are fully protective is false. The effect of myeloid $\\text{IL-}10$ receptor deficiency is described as partial, whereas it is known to be a profound defect.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Co-transfer of wild-type Tregs induces deletion of the naive donor T cell pool, eliminating detectable donor T cells; all cytokines (IFN-$\\gamma$, IL-$17$A, TNF) become undetectable, IL-$10$ and TGF-$\\beta$ are baseline, and $H$ is near zero. $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs still delete effectors and protect fully. Myeloid IL-$10$ receptor deficiency has no impact because the primary mechanism is deletion, not cytokine signaling.**\n    *   The primary mechanism of Treg suppression in this model is not the complete physical deletion of the effector T cell pool. Both populations persist. The claim that $Il10^{-/-}$ Tregs protect fully via this non-existent deletion mechanism is false. The assertion that cytokine signaling is irrelevant contradicts principle (iii) and a vast body of literature.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2859955"}]}
