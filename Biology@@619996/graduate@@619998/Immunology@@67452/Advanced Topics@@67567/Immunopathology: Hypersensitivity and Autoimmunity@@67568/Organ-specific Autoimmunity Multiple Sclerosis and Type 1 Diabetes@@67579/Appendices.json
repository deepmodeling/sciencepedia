Consider a source population in which T1D has prevalence $K = 0.005$.

The provided data ($K$, $p_{\\text{case}}$, $p_{\\text{control}}$) are within a plausible range for such a genetic association. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data and standard epidemiological assumptions (HWE, rare disease approximation, multiplicative model) to allow for a unique, computable solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of two quantities: the allelic odds ratio and the population attributable fraction.\n\n**Part 1: Allelic Odds Ratio ($OR_{\\text{allele}}$)**\n\nThe odds of an allele being HLA-DQ8 among cases is the ratio of the frequency of the DQ8 allele to the frequency of non-DQ8 alleles:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{case}}}{1 - p_{\\text{case}}} $$\nSubstituting the given value $p_{\\text{case}} = 0.45$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}} = \\frac{0.45}{1 - 0.45} = \\frac{0.45}{0.55} = \\frac{9}{11} $$\nThe odds of an allele being HLA-DQ8 among controls is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{control}}}{1 - p_{\\text{control}}} $$\nSubstituting the given value $p_{\\text{control}} = 0.15$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{0.15}{1 - 0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{3}{17} $$\nThe allelic odds ratio, $OR_{\\text{allele}}$, is the ratio of these odds:\n$$ OR_{\\text{allele}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}}} = \\frac{9/11}{3/17} = \\frac{9}{11} \\times \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3 \\times 17}{11} = \\frac{51}{11} $$\nNumerically, this is $OR_{\\text{allele}} \\approx 4.63636...$.\n\n**Part 2: Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**\n\nThe population attributable fraction (PAF) measures the proportion of disease incidence in a population that is due to a specific exposure. The exposure is defined as carrying at least one HLA-DQ8 allele. We must derive this from first principles.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the HLA-DQ8 allele in the population, which we estimate from the controls: $p = p_{\\text{control}} = 0.15$. The frequency of the non-DQ8 allele is $q = 1 - p = 0.85$.\nUnder the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the population, the genotype frequencies for individuals with $0$, $1$, or $2$ copies of the HLA-DQ8 allele are:\n- $f_0$ (non-carrier, non-DQ8/non-DQ8): $f_0 = q^2 = (0.85)^2 = 0.7225$.\n- $f_1$ (heterozygote, DQ8/non-DQ8): $f_1 = 2pq = 2(0.15)(0.85) = 0.255$.\n- $f_2$ (homozygote, DQ8/DQ8): $f_2 = p^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225$.\n\nLet $R_0$, $R_1$, and $R_2$ be the disease risks (probabilities) for individuals with $0$, $1$, and $2$ DQ8 alleles, respectively. The multiplicative model on log-odds and the rare disease approximation ($OR \\approx RR$) imply the following relationships for risk ratios relative to non-carriers:\n- Risk ratio for heterozygotes: $RR_1 = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} \\approx OR_{\\text{het}} = OR_{\\text{allele}} = \\frac{51}{11}$.\n- Risk ratio for homozygotes: $RR_2 = \\frac{R_2}{R_0} \\approx OR_{\\text{hom}} = (OR_{\\text{allele}})^2 = \\left(\\frac{51}{11}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2601}{121}$.\n\nThe PAF is the fraction of total cases that would be prevented if the exposure (carrying at least one DQ8 allele) were eliminated. The total number of cases in a population of size $N$ is proportional to the overall risk $P(D) = f_0 R_0 + f_1 R_1 + f_2 R_2$. The number of cases attributable to the exposure is proportional to $(R_1 - R_0)f_1 + (R_2 - R_0)f_2$.\nTherefore, the PAF is:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{(R_1 - R_0)f_1 + (R_2 - R_0)f_2}{f_0 R_0 + f_1 R_1 + f_2 R_2} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by the baseline risk $R_0$:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{(\\frac{R_1}{R_0} - 1)f_1 + (\\frac{R_2}{R_0} - 1)f_2}{f_0 + (\\frac{R_1}{R_0})f_1 + (\\frac{R_2}{R_0})f_2} = \\frac{(RR_1 - 1)f_1 + (RR_2 - 1)f_2}{f_0 + RR_1 f_1 + RR_2 f_2} $$\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n- $f_0 = 0.7225$\n- $f_1 = 0.255$\n- $f_2 = 0.0225$\n- $RR_1 = \\frac{51}{11} \\approx 4.63636$\n- $RR_2 = \\frac{2601}{121} \\approx 21.49587$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$ (RR_1 - 1)f_1 + (RR_2 - 1)f_2 = \\left(\\frac{51}{11} - 1\\right)(0.255) + \\left(\\frac{2601}{121} - 1\\right)(0.0225) $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{40}{11}\\right)(0.255) + \\left(\\frac{2480}{121}\\right)(0.0225) \\approx (3.63636)(0.255) + (20.49587)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\approx 0.92727 + 0.46116 = 1.38843 $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ f_0 + RR_1 f_1 + RR_2 f_2 = 0.7225 + \\left(\\frac{51}{11}\\right)(0.255) + \\left(\\frac{2601}{121}\\right)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\approx 0.7225 + (4.63636)(0.255) + (21.49587)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\approx 0.7225 + 1.18227 + 0.48366 = 2.38843 $$\nFinally, the PAF is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$ PAF \\approx \\frac{1.38843}{2.38843} \\approx 0.58132 $$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\nThe allelic odds ratio is $4.636$.\nThe population attributable fraction is $0.5813$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.636 & 0.5813 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2879161"}, {"introduction": "Beyond genetic risk, the activation of autoreactive T cells is a critical event governed by a balance of signals at the immunological synapse.

It presents a standard quantitative model of competitive receptor-ligand binding at the immunological synapse, using established principles of chemical kinetics and immunology. All required parameters are provided. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a fold-increase in the minimum required number of pMHC complexes, $N_{\\text{pMHC}}^{\\text{min}}$, for T-cell activation. This is determined by comparing two scenarios: a baseline state with no CTLA-4 expression ($R_{\\text{CTLA4}} = 0$) and an upregulated state ($R_{\\text{CTLA4}} = 80$). The solution involves solving for the equilibrium concentration of CD28–CD80/86 complexes, denoted by $x$, in each case.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing equations from fundamental principles as instructed. The law of mass action for a two-dimensional reversible reaction $A+B \\rightleftharpoons C$ gives the dissociation constant $K_D = \\frac{[A]_{free}[B]_{free}}{[C]}$.\nFor the CD28–CD80/86 interaction, the reactants are free CD28 and free CD80/86, and the product is the complex. The densities are:\n- Complex density: $[CD28–CD80/86] = x$\n- Free CD28 density: $[CD28]_{free} = R_{28} - x$\n- Free ligand (CD80/86) density: $[CD80/86]_{free} = L_f$\nThe equilibrium condition is thus $K_{28} = \\frac{(R_{28}-x)L_f}{x}$, which rearranges to $x = \\frac{(R_{28}-x)L_f}{K_{28}}$.\nBy identical logic for the CTLA-4–CD80/86 interaction, with complex density $y$, we have $K_{\\text{CTLA4}} = \\frac{(R_{\\text{CTLA4}}-y)L_f}{y}$, which gives $y = \\frac{(R_{\\text{CTLA4}}-y)L_f}{K_{\\text{CTLA4}}}$.\nThe principle of mass conservation for the ligand CD80/86 states that the total ligand density, $L_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of free ligand and ligand bound in complexes.\n$L_{\\text{tot}} = L_f + x + y$, which yields $L_f = L_{\\text{tot}} - x - y$.\nThe provided equations are thus correctly derived.\n\nThe T-cell activation threshold is given by $S_{\\text{tot}} = S_{\\text{TCR}} + S_{28} \\ge \\Theta$.
