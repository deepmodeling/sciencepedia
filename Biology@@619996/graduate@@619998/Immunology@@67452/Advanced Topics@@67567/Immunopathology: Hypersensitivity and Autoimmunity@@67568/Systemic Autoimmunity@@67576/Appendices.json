The overall expression level for a given cell type (wild-type or duplicated) is given by $E = E_{\\max} \\frac{S^{m}}{S^{m} + S_{50}^{m}}$. The fold-change is therefore the ratio of their respective expression levels. Assuming the maximal possible expression $E_{\\max}$ is an intrinsic property of the cellular machinery and independent of TLR7 copy number, we have:\n$$F = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dup}}}{E_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{dup}}^{m}}{S_{\\mathrm{dup}}^{m} + S_{50}^{m}}}{E_{\\max} \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{wt}}^{m}}{S_{\\mathrm{wt}}^{m} + S_{50}^{m}}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{dup}}^{m}}{S_{\\mathrm{dup}}^{m} + S_{50}^{m}} \\left( \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{wt}}^{m}}{S_{\\mathrm{wt}}^{m} + S_{50}^{m}} \\right)^{-1}$$\nWe must calculate the surplus signals $S_{\\mathrm{wt}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{dup}}$. This requires first calculating the number of bound receptors, $B$, for each case.\n\n**Part 1: Wild-Type (wt) pDCs**\nThe total number of receptors is $N_{\\mathrm{wt}} = N_{0} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$.\nThe ligand concentration $[L] = 15\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d} = 15\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ are given.\nThe number of occupied receptors is:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{wt}} = N_{\\mathrm{wt}} \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]} = (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\frac{15}{15 + 15} = (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\frac{15}{30} = (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}$$\nThe activation threshold is $B_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{4}$. Since $B_{\\mathrm{wt}} > B_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the cell is activated.\nThe surplus signal is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{wt}} = B_{\\mathrm{wt}} - B_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4} - 1.2 \\times 10^{4} = 0.3 \\times 10^{4} = 3.0 \\times 10^{3}$$\nNow, we calculate the fractional IFN signature output using the Hill equation with parameters $m=2$ and $S_{50} = 6.0 \\times 10^{3}$:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{wt}}^{m}}{S_{\\mathrm{wt}}^{m} + S_{50}^{m}} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{3})^{2}}{(3.0 \\times 10^{3})^{2} + (6.0 \\times 10^{3})^{2}} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{6}}{9 \\times 10^{6} + 36 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{6}}{45 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{9}{45} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\n**Part 2: TLR7-Duplicated (dup) pDCs**\nThe total number of receptors is $N_{\\mathrm{dup}} = 2N_{0} = 2 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) = 6.0 \\times 10^{4}$.\nThe number of occupied receptors is:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{dup}} = N_{\\mathrm{dup}} \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]} = (6.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\frac{15}{15 + 15} = (6.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$$\nSince $B_{\\mathrm{dup}} > B_{\\mathrm{th}}$, this cell is also activated.\nThe surplus signal is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{dup}} = B_{\\mathrm{dup}} - B_{\\mathrm{th}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4} - 1.2 \\times 10^{4} = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$$\nThe fractional IFN signature output is:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dup}}}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{dup}}^{m}}{S_{\\mathrm{dup}}^{m} + S_{50}^{m}} = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{4})^{2}}{(1.8 \\times 10^{4})^{2} + (6.0 \\times 10^{3})^{2}} = \\frac{3.24 \\times 10^{8}}{3.24 \\times 10^{8} + 0.36 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{3.24 \\times 10^{8}}{3.60 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{3.24}{3.60} = \\frac{324}{360} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9$$\n\n**Part 3: Fold-Change Calculation**\nThe fold-change $F$ is the ratio of the two expression levels:\n$$F = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dup}}}{E_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dup}}/E_{\\max}}{E_{\\mathrm{wt}}/E_{\\max}} = \\frac{0.9}{0.2} = 4.5$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $F = 4.500$.\n\n**Part 4: Qualitative Conclusion on Activation Threshold Ligand Concentration**\nThe problem also asks for a qualitative conclusion regarding the effect of TLR7 duplication on the activation threshold ligand concentration, $[L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This is the concentration of ligand required to achieve $B = B_{\\mathrm{th}}$. We can derive an expression for $[L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$ from the binding equation:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{th}} = N \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{th}}}{K_{d} + [L]_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nSolving for $[L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{th}}(K_{d} + [L]_{\\mathrm{th}}) = N [L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n$$B_{\\mathrm{th}} K_{d} = (N - B_{\\mathrm{th}}) [L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n$$[L]_{\\mathrm{th}} = K_{d} \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{th}}}{N - B_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nThis equation shows that $[L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is inversely related to the total number of receptors, $N$. As $N$ increases, the denominator $(N - B_{\\mathrm{th}})$ increases, and thus $[L]_{\\mathrm{th}}$ decreases (assuming $N > B_{\\mathrm{th}}$, which must be true for activation to be possible). Since $N_{\\mathrm{dup}} > N_{\\mathrm{wt}}$, it follows that $[L]_{\\mathrm{th, dup}} < [L]_{\\mathrm{th, wt}}$. Therefore, TLR7 duplication *decreases* the activation threshold ligand concentration, making the cell more sensitive to ligand. This is consistent with the initial premise of the problem. This qualitative conclusion is derived but is not part of the final boxed answer as per instructions.\nThe final numerical answer is the computed fold-change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.500}$$", "id": "2891773"}, {"introduction": "In clinical immunology, diagnosing systemic autoimmune diseases relies on integrating clinical signs with biomarker data, such as the presence of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies.
