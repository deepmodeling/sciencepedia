The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors: $[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]$.\nTherefore, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}\n$$\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, we can express the concentration of free receptors $[R]$ in terms of $[RL]$, $[L]$, and $K_{d}$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_{d} [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_{d} [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]}\n$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of the complex, $[RL] \\neq 0$, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $[RL]$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified to:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the Langmuir isotherm, which describes single-site, non-cooperative binding.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of B-cell survival, $P_{\\text{surv}}$, is proportional to the fractional receptor occupancy $\\theta$.

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nWe begin from the principle of competitive inhibition. For any given Janus kinase isoform $j$, the reversible binding of an inhibitor $I$ to the kinase $J_j$ is described by the equilibrium:\n$$ J_j + I \\rightleftharpoons J_jI $$\nThe dissociation constant for this equilibrium is the inhibition constant, $K_{i,j}$:\n$$ K_{i,j} = \\frac{[J_j][I]}{[J_jI]} $$\nHere, $[J_j]$ is the concentration of free, active kinase, $[I]$ is the free inhibitor concentration, and $[J_jI]$ is the concentration of the inactive, inhibitor-bound kinase.\n\nThe problem states that the fractional activity of a kinase, which we will denote as $\\alpha_j$, is equal to the fraction of kinase molecules that are not bound by the inhibitor. The total kinase concentration is $[J_{j,\\text{total}}] = [J_j] + [J_jI]$.\nTherefore, the fractional activity is:\n$$ \\alpha_j = \\frac{[J_j]}{[J_{j,\\text{total}}]} $$\nFrom the definition of $K_{i,j}$, we can express $[J_jI]$ in terms of $[J_j]$:\n$$ [J_jI] = \\frac{[J_j][I]}{K_{i,j}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for total kinase concentration gives:\n$$ [J_{j,\\text{total}}] = [J_j] + \\frac{[J_j][I]}{K_{i,j}} = [J_j] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i,j}} \\right) $$\nNow, we can derive the expression for the fractional activity $\\alpha_j$:\n$$ \\alpha_j = \\frac{[J_j]}{[J_j] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i,j}} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i,j}}} $$\nThis expression provides the residual activity of a single JAK isoform as a function of inhibitor concentration and its inhibition constant.\n\nNext, we apply this to the two specified signaling pathways.\n\nFor IL-6 signaling, the pathway requires two JAK1 molecules to be simultaneously active. The problem states that residual signaling, $S_{\\text{IL-6}}$, is the product of the residual activities of the required isoforms. As the two JAK1 molecules are acted upon independently by the inhibitor, the probability of both being active is the product of their individual probabilities (fractional activities).\n$$ S_{\\text{IL-6}} = \\alpha_{\\text{JAK1}} \\times \\alpha_{\\text{JAK1}} = (\\alpha_{\\text{JAK1}})^2 $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\alpha_j$:\n$$ S_{\\text{IL-6}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i,\\text{JAK}1}}} \\right)^2 $$\nThe fractional inhibition, $I_{\\text{IL-6}}$, is defined as $1$ minus the residual signaling activity:\n$$ I_{\\text{IL-6}} = 1 - S_{\\text{IL-6}} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i,\\text{JAK}1}}} \\right)^2 $$\n\nFor IFN-γ signaling, the pathway requires one JAK1 and one JAK2 molecule to be simultaneously active.
