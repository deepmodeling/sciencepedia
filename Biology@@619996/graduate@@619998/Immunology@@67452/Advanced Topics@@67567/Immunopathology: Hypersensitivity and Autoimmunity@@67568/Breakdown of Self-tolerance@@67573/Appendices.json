In a simplified two-dimensional binding model at the cell-cell interface, treat all species as surface densities.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained; it provides all necessary constants, densities, and a crucial simplifying assumption (the ligand-limited regime) required to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The terminology is precise and the data are physically consistent. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from first principles as demanded.

B7 ligand binding to CTLA-4 receptor: $\\text{B7} + \\text{CTLA-4} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{B7--CTLA-4}$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium state for each reaction is described by its two-dimensional dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nFor the B7-CD28 interaction, the concentration of complexes, denoted $C_{\\mathrm{CD28}}$, is given by:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{CD28}}}$$\nRearranging for the complex density yields:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CD28}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}}}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the B7-CTLA-4 interaction, the concentration of complexes, $C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$, is:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the system is in a ligand-limited regime where the total ligand density is low. This justifies the approximation that the amount of bound receptor is negligible compared to the total amount of receptor.

Stability is determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(N) = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta + 2\\gamma \\eta N$ at each fixed point.\n-   At $N^{*}_{1} = 0$, the derivative is $f'(0) = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta$. By a given constraint, this is negative. Therefore, $N=0$ is a stable fixed point (an attractor).\n-   At $N^{*}_{2} = N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the derivative is $f'(N_{\\mathrm{crit}}) = (\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta) + 2\\gamma \\eta \\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\gamma \\eta}\\right) = (\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta) + 2(\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}) = \\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}$. By constraint, this is positive. Therefore, $N=N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is an unstable fixed point (a repeller).\n\nThe unstable fixed point $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ acts as a separatrix. If the population size at the start of the post-infection phase, $N(\\tau)$, is below this threshold, the clone will contract to extinction ($N \\to 0$). If $N(\\tau)$ is above this threshold, the clone will grow unchecked. This latter case is the \"irreversible expansion\".\n\n**Derivation of the Minimal Infection Duration $\\tau_{\\min}$**\nIrreversible expansion is triggered if $N(\\tau) > N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The minimal duration $\\tau_{\\min}$ is the time required for the clone to grow such that its size at the end of the infection period exactly reaches the critical threshold:\n$$\nN(\\tau_{\\min}) = N_{\\mathrm{crit}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N(\\tau_{\\min})$ from Part 1 and $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ from Part 2:\n$$\nN_{0} \\exp\\left((\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta) \\tau_{\\min}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\gamma \\eta}\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\tau_{\\min}$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left((\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta) \\tau_{\\min}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\n$$\nThe problem states that $N_0$ is below the threshold, meaning $N_0 < N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. This guarantees that the argument of the logarithm to be taken is greater than $1$, ensuring $\\tau_{\\min} > 0$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n(\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta) \\tau_{\\min} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, dividing by the net growth rate during infection yields the expression for the minimal duration:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the minimum infection duration required to push the autoreactive clone past the point of no return, into a state of self-sustained, irreversible expansion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2837775"}]}
