The timelines, symptoms, complement profiles, and histopathological findings are consistent with established immunological principles. Case X describes classic serum sickness (a systemic Type III hypersensitivity). Case Y describes a classic Arthus reaction (a localized Type III hypersensitivity).\n*   **Well-Posed and Self-Contained:** The problem provides sufficient, non-contradictory information for a differential diagnosis. It clearly distinguishes a primary exposure scenario (Case X) from a pre-sensitized scenario (Case Y), which is central to the question about immune response kinetics.\n*   **Objectivity:** The descriptions use precise and standard clinical and laboratory terminology, devoid of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on first principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nImmune complex-mediated (Type III) hypersensitivity reactions are caused by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in tissues, leading to complement activation and inflammation. The localization and timing of the reaction depend on the site of immune complex formation and the immune status of the individual.\n\n**Analysis of Case X:**\nThe volunteer has no prior exposure, necessitating a primary immune response.\n1.  **Kinetics:** An injected soluble protein antigen (antigen X) circulates. A primary humoral response is initiated, which takes approximately $7$ to $10$ days to produce significant levels of antibody, primarily IgM followed by IgG. The problem states that IgG is detected on day $7$, consistent with this timeline.\n2.  **Pathogenesis:** Around days $7$ to $14$, as the IgG titer rises, it encounters the antigen that may still be present in the circulation. This leads to the formation of soluble antigen-antibody (immune) complexes. These complexes are of an intermediate size, ideal for evading clearance by the reticuloendothelial system and depositing in the walls of small blood vessels, particularly in the kidneys (glomeruli), joints (synovium), and skin.\n3.  **Complement Activation:** The IgG within the deposited complexes activates the classical complement pathway. This activation consumes complement components, explaining the observed low serum C$3$ ($45$ mg/dL), low C$4$ ($6$ mg/dL), and reduced CH$50$.\n4.  **Inflammation:** Complement activation fragments C$3$a and C$5$a act as anaphylatoxins, increasing vascular permeability, and as chemoattractants for neutrophils. Neutrophils are recruited to the site of deposition and, upon attempting to phagocytose the complexes, release lytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, causing vasculitis and tissue damage.\n5.  **Clinical Correlation:** This systemic vasculitis manifests as fever, rash (urticaria), and joint pain (arthralgias). The deposition in renal glomeruli causes glomerulonephritis, leading to hematuria and proteinuria. The kidney biopsy showing granular deposition of IgG and complement is the pathognomonic finding.\nThis entire clinical picture is the definition of **systemic immune complex disease, or serum sickness**, resulting from active, primary immunization against a foreign antigen.\n\n**Analysis of Case Y:**\nThe volunteer is pre-sensitized, with high baseline titers of anti-antigen X IgG.\n1.  **Kinetics:** This is a secondary exposure scenario. The presence of high levels of pre-formed antibody allows for an immediate reaction upon re-introduction of the antigen.\n2.  **Pathogenesis:** The antigen is injected intradermally, in a localized area. The high concentration of pre-existing IgG in the circulation and interstitial fluid rapidly binds to the antigen at the injection site. This forms large, insoluble immune complexes that precipitate *in situ* within the local blood vessel walls.\n3.  **Complement Activation and Inflammation:** As in Case X, the complexes activate complement, leading to a potent local inflammatory response characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, as seen in the biopsy (\"neutrophil-rich small-vessel vasculitis\"). The severe inflammation can lead to vessel thrombosis and ischemic necrosis (\"fibrinoid necrosis\" and \"central area of necrosis\"). The biopsy confirms local deposition of IgG and C$3$.\n4.  **Clinical Correlation:** The reaction is rapid (onset within hours) and localized to the site of antigen challenge, producing a painful, swollen (indurated), and red (erythematous) lesion. Because the reaction is confined locally, the systemic consumption of complement is negligible, explaining why serum C$3$, C$4$, and CH$50$ levels remain within the normal range.\nThis localized form of Type III hypersensitivity in a pre-sensitized individual is known as the **Arthus reaction**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Case X: Systemic immune complex–mediated serum sickness following active immunization; Case Y: Local Arthus reaction due to preformed antibody**\n    *   The classification for Case X as systemic serum sickness following active immunization is correct, as derived above.\n    *   The classification for Case Y as a local Arthus reaction due to preformed antibody is also correct, as derived above.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Case X: Immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity to antigen X; Case Y: Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (Type II) to antigen X–coated cells**\n    *   Case X is not Type I hypersensitivity. Type I reactions are IgE-mediated and occur within minutes, not $9$ days. They do not cause consumption of C$3$ and C$4$ in this manner.\n    *   Case Y is not Type II hypersensitivity. The antigen is a soluble glycoprotein, not an antigen fixed on a cell surface. The pathology is vasculitis from immune complex deposition, not targeted cell killing.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Case X: Local Arthus reaction; Case Y: Delayed-type (Type IV) hypersensitivity**\n    *   Case X describes a systemic reaction (fever, arthralgia, glomerulonephritis), not a local one like the Arthus reaction.\n    *   Case Y is not Type IV hypersensitivity. Type IV reactions are T-cell mediated, peak at $48-72$ hours, and show mononuclear cell infiltration, not the rapid, neutrophil-rich, antibody- and complement-mediated reaction observed.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Case X: Accelerated serum sickness due to preformed antibody; Case Y: Classic Arthus reaction mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE)**\n    *   Case X cannot be accelerated serum sickness because the problem states the volunteer had \"no prior exposure\" and thus no preformed antibody. The timeline ($>7$ days) is consistent with classic, not accelerated, serum sickness.\n    *   Case Y is incorrect because the Arthus reaction is mediated by IgG (and complement), not IgE. The problem explicitly states the volunteer has high titers of anti-antigen X IgG. IgE mediates Type I hypersensitivity.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2904371"}, {"introduction": "The pathogenesis of Type III hypersensitivity hinges on the failure to clear immune complexes from circulation.

I will employ the forward Euler method, where the state is updated at each step $n$ as:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_n + \\Delta t_n \\cdot f(x_n)\n$$\nwhere $f(x_n) = (\\frac{dx}{dt})|_{x=x_n}$.\n\nThe time step $\\Delta t_n$ is adaptive, based on a prescribed heuristic for the instantaneous timescale $\\tau_n$:\n$$\n\\tau_n = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{ass}}(1-x_n)A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x_n) + k_{\\mathrm{dec}}}\n$$\nThe time step for the a given iteration is then $\\Delta t_n = \\min(0.1 \\tau_n, 1.0)$. This adaptive scheme adjusts the step size to be smaller when the system dynamics are fast, ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. After each step, the value of $x$ is clamped to the physically meaningful interval $[0,1]$.\n\nThe integration proceeds until the system converges to a steady state. Convergence is defined by two conditions being met simultaneously: the change in $x$ per step must be negligible, $|x_{n+1} - x_n| < 10^{-10}$, and the net rate of change must be close to zero, $|\\frac{dx}{dt}| < 10^{-10}$. A maximum number of iterations is imposed to prevent getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nThe algorithm is implemented as a Python function that takes a set of parameters, calculates the constant $k_{\\mathrm{dec}}$, and iteratively updates $x$ from $x_0$ according to the rules above until convergence is reached. This process is repeated for each of the five parameter sets provided in the test suite. The final computed steady-state value $x^\\star$ for each case is then rounded to $6$ decimal places and formatted as specified.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the steady-state C3 convertase coverage for multiple parameter sets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Each tuple contains parameters in the order:\n    # (A0, alpha, K, k_ass, k0, aP, P, kH, H, kI, I)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.05, 1.2, 0.05, 1.0, 0.3, 1.5, 0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1),\n        (0.05, 1.2, 0.05, 1.0, 0.3, 1.5, 0.1, 0.6, 1.0, 0.3, 0.1),\n        (0.05, 1.2, 0.05, 1.0, 0.3, 1.5, 1.0, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1),\n        (0.0, 0.5, 0.05, 1.0, 0.3, 1.5, 0.0, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5),\n        (0.02, 5.0, 0.01, 1.0, 0.2, 1.0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        x_star = compute_steady_state(params)\n        results.append(f\"{x_star:.6f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef compute_steady_state(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the steady state x* by numerically integrating the ODE.\n    \n    The function uses an explicit Euler method with an adaptive time step\n    as specified in the problem description.\n    \"\"\"\n    A0, alpha, K, k_ass, k0, aP, P, kH, H, kI, I = params\n\n    # --- Simulation constants ---\n    X0 = 1e-9                      # Initial condition for x\n    MAX_ITERATIONS = 5_000_000     # Safety break to prevent infinite loops\n    CONVERGENCE_TOL_DX = 1e-10     # Tolerance for change in x\n    CONVERGENCE_TOL_DXDT = 1e-10   # Tolerance for rate of change\n    DT_FACTOR = 0.1                # Factor for adaptive time step (0.1 * tau)\n    MAX_DT = 1.0                   # Maximum allowed time step\n\n    # Pre-calculate the constant effective decay rate k_dec\n    k_dec = (k0 / (1.0 + aP * P)) + kH * H + kI * I\n\n    x = X0\n    \n    for _ in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):\n        x_old = x\n        \n        # Calculate the effective assembly drive A_eff(x)\n        A_eff = A0 + (alpha * x) / (K + x)\n        \n        # Calculate the net rate of change of x (dx/dt)\n        assembly_flux = k_ass * (1.0 - x) * A_eff\n        decay_flux = k_dec * x\n        dxdt = assembly_flux - decay_flux\n        \n        # Calculate the adaptive time step delta_t\n        # Timescale tau = 1 / (k_ass * (1-x) * A_eff + k_dec)\n        # Note: assembly_flux = k_ass * (1-x) * A_eff\n        # The prompt says tau = 1/(k_ass(1-x)A_eff(x) + k_dec(P,H,I))\n        # assembly_flux only accounts for the first part of the denominator.\n        # But the expression in the prompt is not for the assembly flux, but for part of the tau calculation.\n        # Let's check: tau = 1 / (rate of increase per site + rate of decrease per site).\n        # dx/dt = rate_inc * (1-x) - rate_dec * x.
