It presents a standard scenario in receptor pharmacology and provides all necessary definitions and data to proceed with a rigorous solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Occupancy Equation\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental definitions provided. The system is at equilibrium, governed by the law of mass action for a reversible bimolecular reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptor, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe total receptor concentration, $[R]_T$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nFrom this conservation equation, the concentration of free receptors can be expressed as:\n$$[R] = [R]_T - [RL]$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_d$ yields:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([R]_T - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nTo derive an expression for receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, which is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$, we must rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio.\nFirst, we multiply both sides by $[RL]$:\n$$K_d [RL] = ([R]_T - [RL])[L]$$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$K_d [RL] = [R]_T [L] - [RL] [L]$$\nNext, we consolidate all terms containing $[RL]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_d [RL] + [RL] [L] = [R]_T [L]$$\nFactoring out the term $[RL]$ on the left side:\n$$[RL] (K_d + [L]) = [R]_T [L]$$\nTo isolate the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$, we divide both sides by $[R]_T$ and by the term $(K_d + [L])$:\n$$\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nBy definition, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$. Therefore, the expression for receptor occupancy as a function of free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$ is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a single class of non-interacting binding sites.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Receptor Occupancy\n\nWe are given the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d = 1.5\\ \\text{nM}$. We are to compute the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ at three different ligand concentrations: $[L]_1 = 0.5\\ \\text{nM}$, $[L]_2 = 1.5\\ \\text{nM}$, and $[L]_3 = 5\\ \\text{nM}$. We use the derived formula $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$ for each case.\n\nCase a: $[L] = 0.5\\ \\text{nM}$\n$$\\theta_1 = \\frac{0.5}{1.5 + 0.5} = \\frac{0.5}{2.0} = 0.25$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $0.2500$.\n\nCase b: $[L] = 1.5\\ \\text{nM}$\n$$\\theta_2 = \\frac{1.5}{1.5 + 1.5} = \\frac{1.5}{3.0} = 0.5$$\nAs expected, when the ligand concentration equals the dissociation constant, the receptor occupancy is exactly one-half. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.5000$.\n\nCase c: $[L] = 5\\ \\text{nM}$\n$$\\theta_3 = \\frac{5}{1.5 + 5} = \\frac{5}{6.5} = \\frac{10}{13}$$\nThe decimal value is approximately $0.7692307...$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.7692$.\n\nThe three occupancies, reported as a row vector in order of increasing $[L]$, are $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2500 & 0.5000 & 0.7692 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nPart 3: Inference of Cellular Response Rank Order\n\nThe problem states two assumptions: $1$) intrinsic efficacy is constant, and $2$) cellular response, which we denote as $E$, is directly proportional to receptor occupancy, $\\theta$. This relationship can be written as:\n$$E = c \\cdot \\theta$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates the intrinsic efficacy of the system. Since $c$ is a positive constant, the magnitude of the response $E$ is a strictly increasing function of the occupancy $\\theta$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that occupancy itself is a function of ligand concentration $[L]$:\n$$E([L]) = c \\cdot \\theta([L]) = c \\cdot \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nTo justify the rank order, we must analyze the behavior of $\\theta$ as a function of $[L]$. We can examine the first derivative of $\\theta$ with respect to $[L]$:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{d[L]} = \\frac{d}{d[L]} \\left( \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} \\right)$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $(f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/g^2$:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{d[L]} = \\frac{(1)(K_d + [L]) - ([L])(1)}{(K_d + [L])^2} = \\frac{K_d}{(K_d + [L])^2}$$\nSince concentrations and the dissociation constant $K_d$ must be non-negative physical quantities (and in fact $K_d > 0$ for any meaningful dissociation), the numerator $K_d$ is positive. The denominator $(K_d + [L])^2$ is also always positive. Therefore, the derivative $\\frac{d\\theta}{d[L]}$ is strictly positive for all $[L] \\ge 0$.\n\nThis proves that receptor occupancy $\\theta$ is a monotonically increasing function of the ligand concentration $[L]$. Consequently, since the cellular response $E$ is directly proportional to $\\theta$, $E$ must also be a monotonically increasing function of $[L]$.\n\nGiven the ligand concentrations $[L]_1 = 0.5\\ \\text{nM}$, $[L]_2 = 1.5\\ \\text{nM}$, and $[L]_3 = 5\\ \\text{nM}$, we have the ordering:\n$$[L]_1 < [L]_2 < [L]_3$$\nBecause the response function $E([L])$ is monotonically increasing, the corresponding cellular responses $E_1, E_2, E_3$ will follow the same rank order:\n$$E_1 < E_2 < E_3$$\nTherefore, the expected rank order of cellular responses, from lowest to highest, corresponds to the order of increasing ligand concentrations: the response at $0.5\\ \\text{nM}$ is the lowest, the response at $1.5\\ \\text{nM}$ is intermediate, and the response at $5\\ \\text{nM}$ is the highest.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2500 & 0.5000 & 0.7692 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2890667"}, {"introduction": "Identifying trace-level lipids like SPMs in complex biological fluids is a major analytical challenge fraught with potential for error.

This unequivocally satisfies the requirement for physicochemical identity confirmation. **Verdict: Pass.**\n2.  **HRMS (Criterion ii):** A precursor mass error of $\\leq 2$ ppm is reported, which represents excellent mass accuracy. The experimental isotopic envelope is quantitatively validated against the theoretical pattern for a C, H, O-only compound: the $M+1$ relative abundance is within $\\pm 20\\%$ of the expected value ($n_C \\times 0.0107$), the $M+2$ abundance is consistent with $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_2$ and $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ contributions, and no anomalous isotopic patterns (e.g., from halogens) are observed. This constitutes a rigorous confirmation of elemental composition. **Verdict: Pass.**\n3.  **MS/MS (Criterion iii):** The tandem mass spectrum contains $\\geq 6$ non-redundant fragment ions that match the authentic standard's spectrum, confirmed by a spectral dot product of $\\geq 0.95$. The use of multiple fragments provides high structural specificity, and a dot product of this magnitude indicates near-perfect spectral identity. **Verdict: Pass.**\n4.  **Controls (Criterion iv):** The workflow employs a comprehensive strategy to prevent and control for artifacts. This includes the use of antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene) and metal chelators (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), low-temperature processing under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) and shielded from light. Crucially, it includes negative controls (matrix blanks and time-zero samples showing $< 1\\%$ of signal) and a time-course experiment demonstrating no increase in the analyte signal over time at room temperature. This provides definitive evidence that the detected SPM is of biological origin and not an ex vivo artifact. **Verdict: Pass.**\n**Conclusion for A:** Workflow A flawlessly meets all four stringent criteria for confident identification. It represents the \"gold standard\" analytical procedure.\n\n**Analysis of Workflow B**\n1.  **Chromatography (Criterion i):** No authentic standard is used. Retention time is compared to a \"class standard\" with a wide tolerance ($|\\Delta t| \\leq 0.20$ minutes). This is insufficient, as isomers within a class can have very similar retention times. This fails to provide specific identification. **Verdict: Fail.**\n2.  **HRMS (Criterion ii):** The mass error of $\\leq 5$ ppm is acceptable, but the isotopic pattern is explicitly not evaluated. This is a critical omission, as mass accuracy alone cannot distinguish between isobaric compounds of different elemental composition. **Verdict: Fail.**\n3.  **MS/MS (Criterion iii):** Identification is based on a single \"diagnostic\" fragment from a library. This directly contradicts the principle that identification must be based on multiple independent fragment ions to ensure structural specificity. **Verdict: Fail.**\n4.  **Controls (Criterion iv):** No autoxidation controls are performed, and sample handling involves air exposure at room temperature. This protocol invites artifact formation, making any results unreliable for labile molecules like SPMs. **Verdict: Fail.**\n**Conclusion for B:** This workflow is profoundly flawed and fails on every major criterion. It is unacceptable for rigorous scientific work.\n\n**Analysis of Workflow C**\n1.  **Chromatography (Criterion i):** Coelution with an authentic standard is demonstrated with high precision ($|\\Delta t| \\leq 0.01$ minutes). **Verdict: Pass.**\n2.  **HRMS (Criterion ii):** While mass error is low ($\\leq 3$ ppm), the isotopic pattern exhibits a $3:1$ ratio for the $M$ and $M+2$ peaks. This is the characteristic signature of a single chlorine atom. Since SPMs are defined as consisting of C, H, and O only, this isotopic pattern provides conclusive evidence that the detected ion is *not* the target SPM. The assignment of this ion as $[\\mathrm{M}{-}\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ without considering its true, chlorinated elemental formula is a severe interpretation error. **Verdict: Fail.**\n3.  **MS/MS (Criterion iii):** The statement that the MS/MS spectrum matches the authentic (non-chlorinated) standard with a high dot product ($0.96$) is contradictory to the precursor ion data. If the precursor is chlorinated, its fragmentation pattern should differ from that of a non-chlorinated analog. This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding or misreporting of the data. The primary evidence from the precursor ion (the isotope pattern) must take precedence. **Verdict: Fail.**\n4.  **Controls (Criterion iv):** While blanks are clean, the workflow's primary failure is the misidentification of a different chemical entity. **Verdict: Fail.**\n**Conclusion for C:** The workflow correctly acquires data that proves the analyte is not the target SPM, but then incorrectly interprets this data as a confirmation. This represents a critical failure in scientific reasoning.\n\n**Analysis of Workflow D**\n1.  **Chromatography (Criterion i):** No authentic standard is used. Comparison to literature retention times with a large deviation ($|\\Delta t| \\approx 0.15$ minutes) is not a valid method for confirmation due to inter-laboratory and inter-instrument variability. **Verdict: Fail.**\n2.  **HRMS (Criterion ii):** Has good mass accuracy ($\\leq 2$ ppm) but does not mention isotopic analysis, which is an incomplete characterization. **Verdict: Incomplete/Fail.**\n3.  **MS/MS (Criterion iii):** The MS/MS spectrum yields only $\\leq 2$ fragment ions, which is insufficient for distinguishing between isomers and thus fails the criterion of using multiple fragments for structural specificity. **Verdict: Fail.**\n4.  **Controls (Criterion iv):** The workflow provides direct evidence of massive artifact formation: background signal is high ($30\\%$) and increases substantially over time ($60\\%$). No preventative measures (antioxidants, chelators) were taken. This proves the measurement is dominated by artifacts. **Verdict: Fail.**\n**Conclusion for D:** This workflow fails due to inadequate chromatographic confirmation, insufficient structural data from MS/MS, and incontrovertible evidence of artifactual generation of the signal.\n\n**Analysis of Workflow E**\n1.  **Chromatography (Criterion i):** Coelution with a deuterated analog ($|\\Delta t| \\leq 0.02$ minutes) is a strong and accepted method for confirming retention time identity, assuming negligible isotope effects on chromatography. **Verdict: Pass.**\n2.  **HRMS (Criterion ii):** Mass accuracy is excellent ($\\leq 2$ ppm). However, the isotopic pattern is only described as \"broadly consistent\". This subjective description lacks the quantitative rigor specified in workflow A and required for stringent identification. **Verdict: Weak Pass/Fail.**\n3.  **MS/MS (Criterion iii):** The use of $4$ shared fragment ions with a spectral dot product of $0.92$ is good, but less compelling than the $\\geq 6$ ions and $\\geq 0.95$ dot product of workflow A. It meets the minimum requirement of \"multiple\" ions, but is less stringent. **Verdict: Weak Pass.**\n4.  **Controls (Criterion iv):** Antioxidants are used and matrix blanks are clean. However, the explicit absence of time-zero or time-course autoxidation controls is a significant flaw. The use of antioxidants is a preventative measure, but without control experiments, there is no *proof* of their efficacy. One cannot \"exclude\" the possibility of artifacts without demonstrating their absence. This fails the stringency requirement. **Verdict: Fail.**\n**Conclusion for E:** While significantly better than B, C, and D, this workflow has notable weaknesses. The lack of rigorous isotopic pattern analysis and, most importantly, the absence of definitive time-course controls to rule out artifacts means it does not meet the \"stringent criteria\" for confident identification.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\n\nOnly workflow A satisfies all four pillars of rigorous analyte identification as laid out in the problem statement. Workflows B, C, and D contain catastrophic flaws. Workflow E represents a good, but not stringent, attempt that falls short, particularly in its control for artifacts.\n\nTherefore, we evaluate the final options:\n- Option A: Only workflow A meets the stringent criteria. This is consistent with our analysis. **Correct.**\n- Option B: Workflows A and C meet the stringent criteria. This is incorrect, as workflow C is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect.**\n- Option C: Workflows A and E meet the stringent criteria. This is incorrect, as workflow E fails to meet the stringency required for artifact control. **Incorrect.**\n- Option D: Workflows A, C, and E meet the stringent criteria.

We substitute the expressions for $m$ and $s$ into the constraint equation:\n$$\n\\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\eta \\alpha}{2\\lambda} \\right) + \\gamma \\left( \\frac{\\nu + \\eta \\gamma}{2\\mu} \\right) = k_c\n$$\nThis allows us to solve for $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta \\alpha^2}{2\\lambda} + \\frac{\\gamma \\nu}{2\\mu} + \\frac{\\eta \\gamma^2}{2\\mu} = k_c\n$$\nGroup the terms containing $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2\\lambda} + \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\mu} \\right) = k_c - \\frac{\\gamma \\nu}{2\\mu}\n$$\nTo simplify the term in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\eta \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda}{2\\lambda \\mu} \\right) = \\frac{2\\mu k_c - \\gamma \\nu}{2\\mu}\n$$\nNow, we can isolate $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\left( \\frac{2\\mu k_c - \\gamma \\nu}{2\\mu} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2\\lambda \\mu}{\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\lambda (2\\mu k_c - \\gamma \\nu)}{\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the optimal value of $s$, which we label $s^{\\star}$. We substitute the derived expression for $\\eta$ back into our equation for $s$:\n$$\ns^{\\star} = \\frac{\\nu + \\eta \\gamma}{2\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left( \\nu + \\gamma \\left[ \\frac{\\lambda (2\\mu k_c - \\gamma \\nu)}{\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda} \\right] \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we place all terms in the parenthesis over a common denominator $(\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda)$:\n$$\ns^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left( \\frac{\\nu(\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda) + \\gamma \\lambda (2\\mu k_c - \\gamma \\nu)}{\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we expand the terms in the numerator:\n$$\n\\nu \\alpha^2 \\mu + \\nu \\gamma^2 \\lambda + 2\\gamma \\lambda \\mu k_c - \\gamma^2 \\lambda \\nu\n$$\nThe terms $\\nu \\gamma^2 \\lambda$ and $-\\gamma^2 \\lambda \\nu$ cancel each other out. The numerator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nu \\alpha^2 \\mu + 2\\gamma \\lambda \\mu k_c = \\mu (\\nu \\alpha^2 + 2\\gamma \\lambda k_c)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $s^{\\star}$:\n$$\ns^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left( \\frac{\\mu (\\nu \\alpha^2 + 2\\gamma \\lambda k_c)}{\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda} \\right)\n$$\nThe factor of $\\mu$ in the numerator and the $1/(2\\mu)$ pre-factor cancel, yielding the final closed-form expression for the optimal level of $s$:\n$$\ns^{\\star} = \\frac{\\nu \\alpha^2 + 2\\gamma \\lambda k_c}{2(\\alpha^2 \\mu + \\gamma^2 \\lambda)}\n$$\nThis expression provides the optimal level of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators, $s^{\\star}$, exclusively in terms of the given model parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\nu \\alpha^{2} + 2 \\gamma \\lambda k_{c}}{2(\\mu \\alpha^{2} + \\lambda \\gamma^{2})}}$$", "id": "2890640"}]}
