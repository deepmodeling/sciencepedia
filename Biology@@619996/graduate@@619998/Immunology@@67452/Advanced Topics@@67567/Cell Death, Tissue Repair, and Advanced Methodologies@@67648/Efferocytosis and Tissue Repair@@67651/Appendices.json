The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. It is objective and free of ambiguity or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is twofold: first, to derive an expression for the uptake velocity $v$ as a function of the free ligand concentration $L$, the dissociation constant $K_{d}$, and the maximal uptake velocity $V_{\\max}$; second, to compute the numerical value of $v$ for the given parameters.\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1. The definition of the dissociation constant, from the law of mass action:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptor, $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration, and $[RL]$ is the receptor-ligand complex concentration.\n\n2.  The conservation of total receptors:\n$$R_{T} = [R] + [RL]$$\nwhere $R_{T}$ is the total receptor concentration.\n\n3.

Substituting these into the proportionality gives $V_{\\max} = k \\cdot 1$, which establishes that the constant of proportionality is $k = V_{\\max}$. Therefore, the precise relationship between $v$ and $\\theta$ is:\n$$v = V_{\\max} \\cdot \\theta = V_{\\max} \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$$\n\nOur task is to express $v$ using only the parameters $L$, $K_{d}$, and $V_{\\max}$. This requires expressing the receptor occupancy $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$ in terms of $L$ and $K_{d}$.\n\nFrom the receptor conservation equation, we isolate the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[R] = R_{T} - [RL]$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{T} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\n\nWe now must solve this equation for the fraction $\\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$. We proceed by algebraic manipulation:\n$$K_{d} [RL] = (R_{T} - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_{d} [RL] = R_{T}[L] - [RL][L]$$\nWe collect terms containing $[RL]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_{d} [RL] + [RL][L] = R_{T}[L]$$\nFactor out $[RL]$:\n$$[RL] (K_{d} + [L]) = R_{T}[L]$$\nTo find the fraction $\\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$, we divide both sides by $R_{T}$ and by the term $(K_{d} + [L])$:\n$$\\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis expression represents the receptor occupancy $\\theta$.

It is a well-defined mathematical problem grounded in a scientific context. The request to derive the result from first principles provides a clear path for reasoning and prevents a trivial lookup of a known formula.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nWe model the system as a continuous-time Markov chain, specifically a birth–death process. Let the state of the system at time $t$ be $N(t)$, representing the number of apoptotic neutrophils in the system (either waiting for clearance or undergoing clearance).\n\nThe process is defined by birth rates (arrivals) $\\lambda_n$ and death rates (service completions) $\\mu_n$ for each state $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n- The arrival of apoptotic neutrophils is a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$. Thus, the birth rate is independent of the current state: $\\lambda_n = \\lambda$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n- The clearance is performed by a single macrophage population (a single server) with an exponential service time at rate $\\mu$. Therefore, the death rate is $\\mu$ when the system is not empty, and $0$ when the system is empty. So, $\\mu_n = \\mu$ for all $n \\ge 1$, and $\\mu_0 = 0$.\n\nSince the problem specifies the stable regime $0 < \\rho < 1$, where $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$, a stationary distribution exists. Let $P_n$ be the stationary probability that the system is in state $n$, i.e., $P_n = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} P(N(t) = n)$.\n\nIn steady state, the rate of flow into any state must equal the rate of flow out of that state. For a birth–death process, this simplifies to the detailed balance equations, which state that the rate of transitioning from state $n$ to $n+1$ must equal the rate of transitioning from state $n+1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\lambda_n P_n = \\mu_{n+1} P_{n+1} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 0\n$$\nSubstituting the rates for our $\\text{M/M/1}$ system:\n$$\n\\lambda P_n = \\mu P_{n+1} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 0\n$$\nThis allows us to express $P_{n+1}$ in terms of $P_n$:\n$$\nP_{n+1} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} P_n = \\rho P_n\n$$\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by induction.\nFor $n=1$: $P_1 = \\rho P_0$.\nFor $n=2$: $P_2 = \\rho P_1 = \\rho (\\rho P_0) = \\rho^2 P_0$.\nIn general, for any $n \\ge 0$, the stationary probability of being in state $n$ is given by:\n$$\nP_n = \\rho^n P_0\n$$\nTo find the value of $P_0$, we use the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P_n = 1\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $P_n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n P_0 = P_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = 1\n$$\nThe sum is a geometric series. Since we are in the stable regime where $0 < \\rho < 1$, the series converges:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = \\frac{1}{1 - \\rho}\n$$\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\nP_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\rho} \\right) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $P_0$, the probability that the system is empty (the macrophage is idle), gives:\n$$\nP_0 = 1 - \\rho\n$$\nThe complete stationary distribution is then:\n$$\nP_n = (1 - \\rho) \\rho^n \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 0\n$$\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly arriving apoptotic neutrophil undergoes secondary necrosis. The condition for secondary necrosis is that the neutrophil experiences a nonzero waiting time. In this $\\text{M/M/1}$ model, an arriving entity must wait if and only if the server is busy upon its arrival. The server is busy if the number of entities in the system is one or more, i.e., $N(t) \\ge 1$.\n\nWe now invoke the property that Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages (PASTA). This fundamental result states that for a system with Poisson arrivals, the proportion of arrivals that find the system in a given state is equal to the long-run time-average proportion of time the system spends in that state.\n\nLet $P_{necrosis}$ be the probability that an arriving neutrophil undergoes secondary necrosis. According to the problem definition and PASTA, this is equivalent to the steady-state probability that the system is busy.\n$$\nP_{necrosis} = P(\\text{an arriving neutrophil finds the server busy})\n$$\nBy PASTA, this is equal to the time-average probability that the server is busy:\n$$\nP_{necrosis} = P(N \\ge 1)\n$$\nwhere $N$ is a random variable following the stationary distribution $P_n$.\nThe probability $P(N \\ge 1)$ can be calculated as $1$ minus the probability that the system is empty, $P(N=0) = P_0$.\n$$\nP(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $P_0$:\n$$\nP_{necrosis} = 1 - (1 - \\rho) = \\rho\n$$\nThus, the probability that a randomly arriving apoptotic neutrophil undergoes secondary necrosis is precisely the traffic intensity, $\\rho$. This result is intuitively pleasing: as the arrival rate $\\lambda$ approaches the service capacity $\\mu$, the system becomes more congested, and the likelihood that an arrival must wait approaches $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\rho}$$", "id": "2846917"}]}
