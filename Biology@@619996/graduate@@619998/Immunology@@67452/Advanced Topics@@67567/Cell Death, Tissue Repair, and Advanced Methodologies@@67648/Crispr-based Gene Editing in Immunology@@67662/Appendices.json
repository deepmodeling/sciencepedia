We are given a model where the cleavage likelihood at any site is related to the mismatch penalties between the guide RNA (gRNA) and the DNA target.\n\nLet $L_k$ denote the relative likelihood of cleavage at a site $k$. The on-target site, denoted by the subscript $on$, has by definition zero mismatches. For any off-target site, denoted by the subscript $off,j$, there is a set of mismatched nucleotide positions, $M_j$. The total mismatch penalty for this off-target site, $W_j$, is the sum of position-specific mismatch penalty weights, $w_i$, for all mismatched positions $i \\in M_j$.\n$$ W_j = \\sum_{i \\in M_j} w_i $$\nFor the on-target site, the set of mismatches is empty, so its total penalty is $W_{on} = 0$.\n\nThe problem states that a unit of weighted mismatch penalty results in a ten-fold reduction in cleavage likelihood. This implies an exponential relationship. The relative cleavage likelihood, $L_k$, for a site with a total penalty $W_k$ can be expressed as:\n$$ L_k \\propto 10^{-W_k} $$\nLet the proportionality constant be $C$.
