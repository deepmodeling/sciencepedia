Let $N$ be the random variable representing the number of cognate peptide–MHC complexes on the surface of a single macrophage. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean value $\\lambda$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer representing the number of events.

It is a well-posed, physically consistent problem that can be solved using fundamental principles of transport phenomena. We now proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe governing principle is the conservation of mass. At steady state, the divergence of the mass flux $\\vec{J}$ must balance the volumetric rate of consumption. For a uniform zero-order consumption rate $q$, the conservation equation is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = -q $$\nAccording to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$ \\vec{J} = -D \\nabla C $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, assumed to be constant. Combining these two equations yields the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$ -\\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla C) = -q \\implies D \\nabla^2 C = q $$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the problem, the concentration $C$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only, i.e., $C=C(r)$. The Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$, in spherical coordinates for a function of $r$ only is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 C(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the reaction-diffusion equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation for the oxygen concentration profile:\n$$ \\frac{D}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = q $$\nThis can be rearranged for integration:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2 $$\nWe perform the first integration with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) dr = \\int \\frac{q}{D} r^2 dr $$\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r^3 + K_1 $$\nwhere $K_1$ is the first constant of integration. To find the concentration $C(r)$, we divide by $r^2$ and integrate again:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{K_1}{r^2} $$\n$$ C(r) = \\int \\left( \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{K_1}{r^2} \\right) dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 - \\frac{K_1}{r} + K_2 $$\nwhere $K_2$ is the second constant of integration.\n\nNow, we must apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $K_1$ and $K_2$.\nThe first boundary condition arises from the physical requirement of a finite concentration and finite flux at the center of the sphere, $r=0$. If $K_1 \\neq 0$, the concentration term $-\\frac{K_1}{r}$ and the gradient term $\\frac{K_1}{r^2}$ would diverge as $r \\to 0$. This is physically nonsensical. Therefore, we must have $K_1=0$. This is equivalent to imposing the symmetry condition that the flux at the center is zero, $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$. With $K_1=0$, the solution simplifies to:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + K_2 $$\nThe second boundary condition is given explicitly at the periphery of the granuloma, $r=R$, where the oxygen concentration is maintained at $C_0$:\n$$ C(R) = C_0 $$\nSubstituting this into our simplified solution:\n$$ C_0 = \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 + K_2 $$\nSolving for the constant $K_2$:\n$$ K_2 = C_0 - \\frac{qR^2}{6D} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $K_2$ back into the solution for $C(r)$ yields the final radial oxygen concentration profile inside the granuloma:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + \\left( C_0 - \\frac{qR^2}{6D} \\right) $$\n$$ C(r) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThis expression describes a parabolic decrease in oxygen concentration from the periphery towards the center.\n\nThe final task is to determine the critical granuloma radius, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, at which the center ($r=0$) first becomes hypoxic. This occurs when the concentration at the center, $C(0)$, is equal to the hypoxia threshold, $C_h$.
