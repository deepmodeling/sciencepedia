It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of competitive Langmuir adsorption, a fundamental concept in surface science and biomaterial interactions. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective to derive a unique steady-state solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical parameters are realistic. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe kinetics of the adsorption-desorption process for the two competing proteins, $A$ and $B$, on a surface with a fixed number of sites can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Let $\\theta_A(t)$ and $\\theta_B(t)$ be the fractional surface coverages of proteins $A$ and $B$ at time $t$, respectively. The fraction of unoccupied sites is then $\\theta_E(t) = 1 - \\theta_A(t) - \\theta_B(t)$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass-action, the rate of adsorption is proportional to the bulk concentration of the protein and the fraction of available sites. The rate of desorption is proportional to the fraction of sites already occupied by that protein.\n\nFor protein $A$, the rate of change of its fractional coverage is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = (\\text{rate of adsorption of } A) - (\\text{rate of desorption of } A)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{\\text{on},A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},A} \\theta_A\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for protein $B$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = (\\text{rate of adsorption of } B) - (\\text{rate of desorption of } B)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = k_{\\text{on},B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},B} \\theta_B\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state coverages. At steady state, the net rate of change of coverage for each species is zero. This means we set the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nThis yields a system of two algebraic equations:\n1. $k_{\\text{on},A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},A} \\theta_A = 0$\n2. $k_{\\text{on},B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},B} \\theta_B = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ in terms of the fraction of empty sites, $(1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)$:\nFrom (1):\n$$\nk_{\\text{on},A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) = k_{\\text{off},A} \\theta_A \\implies \\theta_A = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\nFrom (2):\n$$\nk_{\\text{on},B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) = k_{\\text{off},B} \\theta_B \\implies \\theta_B = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n\nIt is convenient to define the equilibrium association constant, $K_{A,i}$, for each protein $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$ as the ratio of its on-rate to its off-rate constant:\n$$\nK_{A,i} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},i}}{k_{\\text{off},i}}\n$$\nThis constant quantifies the binding affinity of the protein for the surface. The equations become:\n$$\n\\theta_A = K_{A,A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = K_{A,B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n\nThe total fractional coverage is $\\theta_A + \\theta_B$. We can substitute the expressions above:\n$$\n\\theta_A + \\theta_B = K_{A,A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) + K_{A,B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_A + \\theta_B = (K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B)(1 - (\\theta_A + \\theta_B))\n$$\n\nLet $S = \\theta_A + \\theta_B$. The equation is $S = (K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B)(1-S)$. Solving for $S$:\n$$\nS(1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B) = K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\nThis is the total fractional coverage. To find the individual coverages, we substitute the expression for the fraction of empty sites, $1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B = 1 - S$, back into the equations for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$.\n$$\n1 - S = 1 - \\frac{K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\nTherefore, the final expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ are:\n$$\n\\theta_A = K_{A,A} C_A (1 - S) = \\frac{K_{A,A} C_A}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = K_{A,B} C_B (1 - S) = \\frac{K_{A,B} C_B}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\nExpressed in terms of the original rate constants, these are:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right) C_A}{1 + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right) C_A + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right) C_B}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right) C_B}{1 + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right) C_A + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right) C_B}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these expressions numerically. First, we compute the dimensionless quantities $K_{A,i}C_i$:\nFor protein $A$:\n$$\nK_{A,A} C_A = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}} C_A = \\frac{10^{5}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}}{10^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = (10^{7}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{M}) = 500\n$$\nFor protein $B$:\n$$\nK_{A,B} C_B = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}} C_B = \\frac{10^{4}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}}{10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = (10^{8}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = 100\n$$\nThe common denominator is:\n$$\nD = 1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B = 1 + 500 + 100 = 601\n$$\nNow, we calculate the fractional coverages:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{500}{601} \\approx 0.8319467...\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\frac{100}{601} \\approx 0.1663893...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required:\n$$\n\\theta_A \\approx 0.832\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B \\approx 0.166\n$$\n\nInterpretation:\nThe numerical results show that $\\theta_A \\approx 0.832$ and $\\theta_B \\approx 0.166$. Since $\\theta_A > \\theta_B$, protein $A$ is the dominant component of the protein corona at steady state. The reason for this dominance is found in the derived quantities that determine surface occupancy. The steady-state partitioning of proteins onto the surface is governed by the competition parameter, which is the product of the protein's association constant (affinity) and its bulk concentration, $K_{A,i}C_i$. We calculated $K_{A,A}C_A = 500$ and $K_{A,B}C_B = 100$. Protein $A$ dominates because its competition parameter is five times larger than that of protein $B$ ($500/100 = 5$). It is instructive to note that protein $B$ has a higher intrinsic affinity for the surface ($K_{A,B} = 10^8\\,\\text{M}^{-1}$) compared to protein $A$ ($K_{A,A} = 10^7\\,\\text{M}^{-1}$). However, the much higher concentration of protein $A$ ($C_A = 50 \\times C_B$) more than compensates for its lower affinity, leading to its prevalence on the surface at equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.832  0.166 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2837015"}, {"introduction": "After the initial protein corona is formed, immune cells begin to interact with and respond to the biomaterial.

Assembly and disassembly are modeled by mass-action kinetics, with assembly rate modulated by a Hill function $H(R)$ that captures cooperative activation by reactive oxygen species:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt}=k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,H(R(t))\\,[1-A(t)]-k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,A(t),\\quad\nH(R)=\\frac{R^n}{K_R^n+R^n},\n$$\nwith $k_{\\mathrm{on}}0$, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\ge 0$, Hill coefficient $n\\ge 1$, and half-activation $K_R0$. This construction is consistent with widely used models of receptor-mediated assembly with cooperativity.\n\nThe initial conditions $B(0)=0$, $R(0)=0$, $A(0)=0$ represent an unexposed, inactive baseline. All variables and parameters are dimensionless, so no unit conversion is needed.\n\nAlgorithmic approach:\n- For each test case, define the parameter set by starting from the base parameters and applying the case-specific overrides.\n- Define the time-dependent release flux $r(t)=J_0 e^{-t/\\tau}+J_{\\mathrm{bg}}$.\n- Construct the right-hand side function $f(t,y)$ for $y=[B,R,A]^\\top$ implementing the three coupled ordinary differential equations above.\n- Numerically integrate from $t=0$ to $t=T$ using a robust variable-step solver suitable for potentially stiff dynamics; methods such as backward differentiation formula or Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations with Automatic method switching are appropriate. We employ a standard library solver with adaptive step size and stiffness detection to ensure stability.\n- Extract $A(T)$ from the final state and round to $3$ decimal places.\n\nQualitative expectations across the test suite:\n- Case $1$: With $J_0=2.0$ and $\\tau=5.0$ plus a nonzero $J_{\\mathrm{bg}}=0.2$, the ion burden $B(t)$ rises and approaches a steady state proportional to $J_{\\mathrm{bg}}$, reactive oxygen species attain a nonzero steady state due to saturable production from $B(t)$, and the activation fraction $A(t)$ approaches a balance between assembly and disassembly. We expect $A(T)$ to be appreciably above $0$.\n- Case $2$: With $J_0=0.0$ and $J_{\\mathrm{bg}}=0.0$, there is no external drive; $B(t)$, $R(t)$, and $A(t)$ remain at $0$, so $A(T)$ is $0.000$.\n- Case $3$: Fast efflux $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}=2.0$ reduces $B(t)$ and thus $R(t)$ and $H(R)$, yielding a smaller $A(T)$ than Case $1$.\n- Case $4$: High and sustained release $J_0=8.0$, $\\tau=10.0$ increases the area under the burden curve and the steady background ensures a higher reactive oxygen species level; $A(T)$ should be close to its upper bound, limited by disassembly.\n- Case $5$: Increasing $K_R$ to $0.7$ shifts the Hill response rightward, requiring higher reactive oxygen species for the same activation, thus reducing $A(T)$ relative to Case $1$ despite similar exposure.\n\nThe program integrates the system for each case and prints a single line with the five rounded values $[A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4,A_5]$, where each $A_i$ is $A(T)$ rounded to $3$ decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef hill_function(R, K_R, n):\n    # Hill activation; safe for R=0\n    return (R**n) / (K_R**n + R**n)\n\ndef release_flux(t, J0, tau, J_bg):\n    return J0 * np.exp(-t / tau) + J_bg\n\ndef odes(t, y, params):\n    B, R, A = y\n    # Unpack parameters\n    alpha = params['alpha']\n    k_eff = params['k_eff']\n    k_rg = params['k_rg']\n    K_B = params['K_B']\n    r0 = params['r0']\n    k_rd = params['k_rd']\n    k_on = params['k_on']\n    k_off = params['k_off']\n    n = params['n']\n    K_R = params['K_R']\n    J0 = params['J0']\n    tau = params['tau']\n    J_bg = params['J_bg']\n    # Flux\n    r_t = release_flux(t, J0, tau, J_bg)\n    # dB/dt\n    dBdt = alpha * r_t - k_eff * B\n    # dR/dt\n    dRdt = k_rg * (B / (K_B + B)) + r0 - k_rd * R if B >= 0 else r0 - k_rd * R\n    # dA/dt\n    H = hill_function(R, K_R, n)\n    dAdt = k_on * H * (1.0 - A) - k_off * A\n    return [dBdt, dRdt, dAdt]\n\ndef integrate_case(case_params, T):\n    # Initial conditions\n    y0 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n    # Integrate using a robust method with stiffness handling\n    sol = solve_ivp(\n        fun=lambda t, y: odes(t, y, case_params),\n        t_span=(0.0, T),\n        y0=y0,\n        method='LSODA',\n        atol=1e-9,\n        rtol=1e-7\n    )\n    if not sol.success:\n        # Fallback: try a different method\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=lambda t, y: odes(t, y, case_params),\n            t_span=(0.0, T),\n            y0=y0,\n            method='BDF',\n            atol=1e-9,\n            rtol=1e-7\n        )\n    B_T, R_T, A_T = sol.y[:, -1]\n    # Clip to [0,1] for A to avoid tiny numerical excursions\n    A_T = float(np.clip(A_T, 0.0, 1.0))\n    return A_T\n\ndef format_results(values):\n    # Round to 3 decimal places, keep trailing zeros\n    return \"[\" + \",\".join(f\"{v:.3f}\" for v in values) + \"]\"\n\ndef solve():\n    # Base parameters (dimensionless)\n    base_params = {\n        'alpha': 0.5,\n        'k_eff': 0.3,\n        'k_rg': 1.0,\n        'K_B': 1.0,\n        'r0': 0.0,\n        'k_rd': 1.0,\n        'k_on': 1.0,\n        'k_off': 0.05,\n        'n': 3,\n        'K_R': 0.5,\n        'J_bg': 0.2,\n        'J0': 0.0,   # will be overridden per case\n        'tau': 5.0   # default, may be overridden\n    }\n    T = 40.0\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case applies overrides to the base parameters.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: J0=2.0, tau=5.0\n        {'J0': 2.0, 'tau': 5.0},\n        # Case 2: J0=0.0, tau=5.0, J_bg=0.0\n        {'J0': 0.0, 'tau': 5.0, 'J_bg': 0.0},\n        # Case 3: J0=2.0, tau=5.0, k_eff=2.0\n        {'J0': 2.0, 'tau': 5.0, 'k_eff': 2.0},\n        # Case 4: J0=8.0, tau=10.0\n        {'J0': 8.0, 'tau': 10.0},\n        # Case 5: J0=1.0, tau=5.0, K_R=0.7\n        {'J0': 1.0, 'tau': 5.0, 'K_R': 0.7},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for overrides in test_cases:\n        # Merge base parameters with overrides\n        params = dict(base_params)\n        params.update(overrides)\n        # Integrate and collect A(T)\n        A_T = integrate_case(params, T)\n        results.append(A_T)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(format_results(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2836960"}]}
