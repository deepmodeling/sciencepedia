The primary endpoint is the difference in the mean Shannon diversity (natural logarithm base) of the gut microbiome between cases (patients with immune-mediated colitis) and matched healthy controls. Assume that, by prior published cohorts of gut microbiome profiling in similar populations, the within-group variances of Shannon diversity are approximately constant and equal to $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} = 0.36$ for cases and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2} = 0.25$ for controls.

It presents a standard biostatistical power calculation scenario, employing established concepts such as Shannon diversity, case-control studies, and the Central Limit Theorem. The context of immunotherapy-related adverse events and microbiome dysbiosis is a valid and current area of biomedical research. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, variances, and effect size) for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters are numerically plausible. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\mathrm{case}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}$ be the true population mean Shannon diversities for the case and control groups, respectively. Let $\\bar{X}_{\\mathrm{case}}$ and $\\bar{X}_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}$ denote the sample means from independent samples of size $n$ from each group. The variances are given as $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} = 0.36$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2} = 0.25$.\n\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sample means are approximately normally distributed:\n$\\bar{X}_{\\mathrm{case}} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{case}}, \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2}}{n}\\right)$\n$\\bar{X}_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}, \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}\\right)$\n\nThe difference of the sample means, $D = \\bar{X}_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\bar{X}_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}$, is therefore also normally distributed. Its distribution is:\n$D \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}, \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2}}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}\\right) = N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}, \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}\\right)$\n\nThe hypothesis test is formulated as:\nNull hypothesis $H_0: \\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = 0$.\nAlternative hypothesis $H_1: \\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} \\neq 0$.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, the distribution of the difference $D$ is $N\\left(0, \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}\\right)$. The standardized test statistic is:\n$Z = \\frac{D - 0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}} \\sim N(0, 1)$\n\nFor a two-sided test with a Type I error rate of $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if the observed statistic falls in the tails of the null distribution. The critical values are $\\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{q}$ is the $q$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution. Rejection occurs if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. This is equivalent to rejecting $H_0$ if:\n$|D| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}$\n\nPower, $1-\\beta$, is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true. We consider a specific alternative where the true difference has magnitude $|\\Delta|$, such that $|\\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}| = |\\Delta|$. Without loss of generality, let the true difference be $\\Delta > 0$. Power is the probability of observing $|D|$ in the rejection region, given this true difference.\n$1 - \\beta = P\\left(|D| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}} \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = \\Delta \\right)$\n\nFor a reasonably powered study, the probability of rejecting in the incorrect tail (i.e., $D < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\dots}$) is negligible. Thus, power is well-approximated by the probability of rejecting in the correct tail:\n$1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left(D > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}} \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\mu_{\\mathrm{case}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = \\Delta \\right)$\n\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize $D$ under the alternative hypothesis, where its mean is $\\Delta$:\n$$1 - \\beta = P\\left( \\frac{D - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}} > \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}} \\right)$$\nThe term on the left of the inequality is a standard normal variable, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. The probability $P(Z > k) = 1-\\beta$ implies that the lower bound $k$ must be the quantile $z_{\\beta}$, which is equal to $-z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$-z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}}$$\nRearranging for $\\Delta$:\n$\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}}{n}}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$\n\nWe now solve for the sample size $n$. Squaring both sides and isolating $n$:\n$\\frac{\\Delta^2 n}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2}} = (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2$\n$n = \\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2 (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2})}{\\Delta^2}$\nThis is the general formula for the required sample size per group. The use of $|\\Delta|$ in the denominator ensures $n$ is positive regardless of the direction of the effect.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.9600$\n$1-\\beta = 0.90 \\implies \\beta=0.10 \\implies z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.90} \\approx 1.2816$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{case}}^{2} = 0.36$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}^{2} = 0.25$\n$\\Delta = 0.35$\n\nSubstituting these into the derived formula:\n$n = \\frac{(1.9600 + 1.2816)^2 (0.36 + 0.25)}{0.35^2}$\n$n = \\frac{(3.2416)^2 (0.61)}{0.1225}$\n$n = \\frac{10.50795456 \\times 0.61}{0.1225}$\n$n = \\frac{6.4098522816}{0.1225}$\n$n \\approx 52.325$\n\nSince the sample size must be an integer, we must take the ceiling of this value to ensure the power is at least $0.90$.\n$n_{\\mathrm{minimal}} = \\lceil 52.325 \\rceil = 53$.\n\nTherefore, a sample size of $53$ cases and $53$ controls is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{53}$$", "id": "2846602"}, {"introduction": "After collecting microbiome data, the next challenge is to distill vast amounts of sequencing information into a clear, quantitative measure of dysbiosis.

The analysis proceeds in three distinct parts: derivation, calculation, and interpretation.\n\nFirst, the validation of the problem statement is performed.\nThe problem provides three relative abundance vectors, $H$, $H_{\\mathrm{diet}}$, and $D$, for $5$ bacterial taxa. The components of each vector are non-negative and sum to $1$. The objective is to use a standard ecological metric, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, to quantify and compare compositional shifts. The problem is scientifically grounded in microbial ecology and immunology, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. No scientific, logical, or factual contradictions are present. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the simplified Bray-Curtis dissimilarity expression.\n\nThe standard definition of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, $\\Delta(X, Y)$, between two samples with abundance vectors $X = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N)$ and $Y = (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_N)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N |x_i - y_i|}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i + y_i)}\n$$\nThis definition is valid for any non-negative abundance data. The problem specifies that the vectors represent relative abundances, which imposes the constraint that the components of each vector sum to $1$.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i = 1\n$$\nThis constraint simplifies the denominator of the dissimilarity formula significantly. By applying the L-additivity of summation:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i + y_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^N y_i = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the original definition yields the simplified expression for relative abundance vectors:\n$$\n\\Delta(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N |x_i - y_i|}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N |x_i - y_i|\n$$\nThis is the required expression in terms of component-wise absolute differences.\n\nFor completeness, the equivalent expression in terms of component-wise minima is derived. The Bray-Curtis similarity, $C_{BC}$, is defined as:\n$$\nC_{BC}(X, Y) = \\frac{2 \\sum_{i=1}^N \\min(x_i, y_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i + y_i)}\n$$\nFor relative abundances, the denominator is $2$, so the similarity becomes the sum of the component-wise minimum values:\n$$\nC_{BC}(X, Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\min(x_i, y_i)\n$$\nThe dissimilarity is then $\\Delta = 1 - C_{BC}$, which gives:\n$$\n\\Delta(X, Y) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^N \\min(x_i, y_i)\n$$\nThese two forms are equivalent, which can be confirmed using the identity $|a - b| = a + b - 2\\min(a, b)$ for any non-negative numbers $a$ and $b$. Summing over all components for vectors $X$ and $Y$ whose components sum to $1$ gives $\\sum |x_i - y_i| = \\sum x_i + \\sum y_i - 2\\sum\\min(x_i, y_i) = 1 + 1 - 2\\sum\\min(x_i, y_i) = 2(1 - \\sum\\min(x_i, y_i))$.

The units are consistent within each Monod term (e.g., $C$ and $K_{C,E}$ are both in $\\mathrm{mM}$; $O$ and $K_{O}$ are both in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), making the saturation terms dimensionless as required.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires two parts: a conceptual justification and a quantitative calculation.\n\n**Conceptual Justification**\n\nNiche theory posits that the ecological success of an organism is determined by its traits and the availability of resources in its environment. In the context of the mammalian gut, the primary niche dimensions include available nutrients (electron donors like carbon sources) and electron acceptors.\n\nIn a healthy, homeostatic gut, the environment is strictly anaerobic. The absence of potent electron acceptors like oxygen and nitrate means that the metabolic landscape is dominated by fermentation. Organisms like the obligate anaerobe $A$ are highly adapted to this niche, competing for fermentable carbon sources. Facultative anaerobes like $E$ must also rely on fermentation, a less energetically efficient process than respiration.\n\nInflammation fundamentally alters the niche. The host immune response, involving enzymes such as Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) and NADPH oxidases, generates reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. These are converted into nitrate ($NO_3^−$) and introduce trace amounts of oxygen ($O_2$) into the gut lumen, particularly near the epithelium.\n\nThis host-driven process creates new niche opportunities by introducing electron acceptors that were previously absent. According to the problem's model, the facultative anaerobe $E$ is capable of exploiting both oxygen and nitrate for respiration. Respiration yields significantly more energy per mole of carbon source than fermentation, translating to a higher potential growth rate ($\\mu^{\\max}$). The obligate anaerobe $A$, by definition, cannot utilize these electron acceptors. Its growth remains limited by the efficiency of fermentation.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of oxygen and nitrate by the host's inflammatory response provides a distinct competitive advantage to Enterobacteriaceae-like organisms ($E$). They are able to switch to a more efficient metabolism (respiration), allowing them to outgrow the obligate anaerobes ($A$) that are specialists for the non-inflamed, anaerobic environment. This resource-based advantage explains the characteristic \"bloom\" of such facultative anaerobes during dysbiosis associated with gut inflammation.\n\n**Quantitative Calculation**\n\nWe are tasked to compute the fold growth advantage $R = \\frac{\\mu_{E}}{\\mu_{A}}$. This requires calculating the specific growth rates $\\mu_{E}$ and $\\mu_{A}$ under the given conditions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the growth rate of the obligate anaerobe, $\\mu_{A}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{A} = \\mu^{\\max}_{A}\\,\\frac{C}{K_{C,A} + C}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$C = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $K_{C,A} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $\\mu^{\\max}_{A} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{A} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{10}{1 + 10} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{10}{11} = \\frac{5}{11}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the growth rate of the facultative anaerobe, $\\mu_{E}$. This involves first calculating the potential growth rates from oxygen and nitrate respiration, $\\mu_{E,O}$ and $\\mu_{E,N}$, and then selecting the maximum.\n\nWe evaluate the individual Monod saturation terms:\n- Carbon term: $\\frac{C}{K_{C,E} + C} = \\frac{10}{2 + 10} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n- Oxygen term: $\\frac{O}{K_{O} + O} = \\frac{5}{1 + 5} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n- Nitrate term: $\\frac{N}{K_{N} + N} = \\frac{200}{50 + 200} = \\frac{200}{250} = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\mu_{E,O}$ using Liebig's law of the minimum:\n$$\n\\mu_{E,O} = \\mu^{\\max}_{E,O}\\,\\min\\!\\left(\\frac{C}{K_{C,E} + C},\\,\\frac{O}{K_{O} + O}\\right)\n$$\nWith $\\mu^{\\max}_{E,O} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{E,O} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{5}{6}, \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{6}{5}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nIn this case, growth is co-limited by carbon and oxygen.\n\nNext, we calculate $\\mu_{E,N}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{E,N} = \\mu^{\\max}_{E,N}\\,\\min\\!\\left(\\frac{C}{K_{C,E} + C},\\,\\frac{N}{K_{N} + N}\\right)\n$$\nWith $\\mu^{\\max}_{E,N} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. We must compare the carbon and nitrate terms: $\\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$ and $\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$. The minimum is the nitrate term.\n$$\n\\mu_{E,N} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{5}{6}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{16}{25}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 0.64\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nIn this case, growth is limited by nitrate availability.\n\nThe actual growth rate of species $E$ is the maximum of the rates achievable by the two respiratory pathways:\n$$\n\\mu_{E} = \\max(\\mu_{E,O}, \\mu_{E,N}) = \\max(1.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}, 0.64\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nSpecies $E$ will preferentially use oxygen respiration as it yields a higher growth rate.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold growth advantage ratio, $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\mu_{E}}{\\mu_{A}} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{\\frac{5}{11}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = \\frac{11}{5} = 2.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n$R = 2.20$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.20}\n$$", "id": "2846613"}]}
