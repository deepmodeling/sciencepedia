A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Fractional Activity**\nThe foundation of this model is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a macromolecule's binding sites by a ligand. For an inhibitor with concentration $[B]$ and a Hill coefficient $n$, the fractional occupancy is given by:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[B]^n}{K_d + [B]^n}\n$$\nwhere $K_d$ is a constant related to the dissociation of the inhibitor-enzyme complex.\n\nThe problem states that the fractional inhibition, denoted here as $I_{\\text{frac}}$, is equal to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{frac}} = \\theta = \\frac{[B]^n}{K_d + [B]^n}\n$$\nThe fractional activity $A$ is the portion of enzyme activity that remains in the presence of the inhibitor. Assuming the maximum activity is normalized to $1$, the fractional activity is:\n$$\nA = 1 - I_{\\text{frac}}\n$$\nNext, we must relate the constant $K_d$ to the given parameter $\\text{IC}_{50}$. The $\\text{IC}_{50}$ is defined as the inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme activity is reduced by one-half. This means that when $[B] = \\text{IC}_{50}$, the fractional activity $A = 0.5$. Consequently, the fractional inhibition $I_{\\text{frac}}$ must also be $0.5$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{frac}}([B] = \\text{IC}_{50}) = 1 - A([B] = \\text{IC}_{50}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\nSubstituting $[B] = \\text{IC}_{50}$ and $I_{\\text{frac}} = 0.5$ into the equation for fractional inhibition allows us to solve for $K_d$:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n}{K_d + (\\text{IC}_{50})^n}\n$$\n$$\n0.5(K_d + (\\text{IC}_{50})^n) = (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_d + 0.5 (\\text{IC}_{50})^n = (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_d = 0.5 (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\n$$\nK_d = (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $K_d$ back into the equation for fractional inhibition:\n$$\nI_{\\text{frac}} = \\frac{[B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for fractional activity $A$:\n$$\nA = 1 - I_{\\text{frac}} = 1 - \\frac{[B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nA = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n} - \\frac{[B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n - [B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nThis yields the final derived expression for fractional activity $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in the equivalent form $A = \\frac{1}{1 + ([B]/\\text{IC}_{50})^n}$, which is a standard representation of an inhibitory dose-response curve. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nThe second part of the problem requires the calculation of $A$ using the provided values: $[B]=2\\ \\text{mM}$, $\\text{IC}_{50}=0.5\\ \\text{mM}$, and $n=1$. The units (mM) are consistent and will cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction as required.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nA = \\frac{(0.5)^1}{(0.5)^1 + (2)^1}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{0.5}{0.5 + 2}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{0.5}{2.5}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nThe problem demands the result be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.
