Butyrate is a key immunomodulatory metabolite that promotes regulatory T cell differentiation and supports epithelial barrier function. Assume a well-mixed, steady-state environment with the following foundational, well-tested biochemical facts and definitions:\n\n1. Conservation of matter (in particular, conservation of carbon) holds for all transformations.\n2. The Bifidobacterium bifid shunt ferments a hexose unit to acetate and lactate with a molar product ratio of $1.5{:}1$ (acetate{:}lactate) in the absence of growth, which corresponds to an equal split of product carbon between acetate and lactate (that is, $3$ carbon atoms to acetate and $3$ to lactate per hexose).\n3. Lactate-to-butyrate conversion by Eubacterium proceeds according to the stoichiometry\n$$\\text{lactate} + \\text{acetate} \\to \\text{butyrate} + \\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},$$\nso that one mole of lactate and one mole of acetate yield one mole of butyrate.\n4. Growth yield coefficients are specified on a carbon basis as the fraction of substrate carbon diverted to biomass carbon:\n   - For Bifidobacterium, $Y_{X/C}^{(B)}$ is the fraction of HMO carbon converted to biomass carbon, with the remainder to extracellular fermentation products.\n   - For Eubacterium, $Y_{X/C}^{(E)}$ is the fraction of consumed substrate carbon (from lactate plus acetate) diverted to biomass carbon, with the remainder to extracellular products in the same relative partition implied by the stoichiometric reaction.\n\nConsider a chemostat-like setting with an HMO input flux of $F_{H} = 7.50$ $\\mathrm{mmol}$ hexose-equivalents per hour. Take $Y_{X/C}^{(B)} = 0.15$ and $Y_{X/C}^{(E)} = 0.10$. Assume that acetate supplied by Bifidobacterium is not limiting for the Eubacterium reaction (that is, the acetate supply is sufficient to pair $1{:}1$ with all lactate available for cross-feeding). Under these assumptions, use carbon conservation and the above stoichiometries and yield definitions to compute the expected steady-state butyrate production rate by the consortium.\n\nExpress the final butyrate production rate in $\\mathrm{mmol \\cdot h^{-1}}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "We proceed from conservation of carbon and the given stoichiometries and yield definitions.\n\nStep 1: Translate the Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) input flux into carbon flow to Bifidobacterium. One mole of hexose contains $6$ moles of carbon atoms. The total carbon influx to Bifidobacterium is therefore\n$$C_{\\text{in}}^{(B)} = 6 F_{H} \\quad \\text{(mol C h}^{-1}\\text{)}.$$\n\nBy definition, a fraction $Y_{X/C}^{(B)}$ of this carbon becomes biomass carbon, and the remainder becomes extracellular fermentation products:\n$$C_{\\text{prod}}^{(B)} = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) C_{\\text{in}}^{(B)} = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) 6 F_{H}.$$\n\nFor the bifid shunt in the absence of growth, one hexose yields $1.5$ moles of acetate and $1$ mole of lactate, which corresponds to splitting the product carbon equally between acetate and lactate. Under growth, we assume the product partition (by carbon) remains equal. Hence,\n$$C_{\\text{Ac}}^{(B)} = C_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{prod}}^{(B)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) 6 F_{H}.$$\n\nConvert these carbon flows to molar product fluxes using their carbon numbers: acetate has $2$ carbons and lactate has $3$ carbons. Therefore,\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{Ac}}^{(B)} = \\frac{C_{\\text{Ac}}^{(B)}}{2} = \\frac{\\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) 6 F_{H}}{4} = 1.5 \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) F_{H},\n$$\n\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)} = \\frac{C_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)}}{3} = \\frac{\\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) 6 F_{H}}{6} = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) F_{H}.\n$$\n\n\nThese reproduce the canonical acetate:lactate molar ratio of $1.5{:}1$ scaled by the fraction of carbon not assimilated into biomass.\n\nStep 2: Determine the substrate limitation for the Eubacterium reaction. The stoichiometry is $1{:}1$ lactate:acetate to form butyrate. From Step 1,\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\text{Ac}}^{(B)}}{v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)}} = \\frac{1.5 \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) F_{H}}{\\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) F_{H}} = 1.5.\n$$\n\nThus acetate is produced in $1.5$-fold excess relative to lactate; consequently, lactate limits the cross-feeding reaction. We assume Eubacterium consumes all available lactate from Bifidobacterium at steady state, paired $1{:}1$ with acetate. Therefore, the lactate consumption flux by Eubacterium is\n$$v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(E,\\text{cons})} = v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)}.$$\n\nStep 3: Account for Eubacterium growth yield on a carbon basis. Let $v$ denote the common molar consumption rate of lactate and acetate, $v \\equiv v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(E,\\text{cons})} = v_{\\text{Ac}}^{(E,\\text{cons})}$. The total substrate carbon consumed by Eubacterium per unit time is\n$$C_{\\text{cons}}^{(E)} = 3 v + 2 v = 5 v.$$\n\nBy definition, a fraction $Y_{X/C}^{(E)}$ of this consumed carbon is diverted to biomass carbon; the remainder, $\\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) C_{\\text{cons}}^{(E)}$, exits as extracellular products in the ratios implied by the stoichiometric reaction. The baseline product carbon partition for the reaction lactate $+$ acetate $\\to$ butyrate $+$ carbon dioxide $+$ water is $4$ carbons to butyrate and $1$ carbon to carbon dioxide per $5$ carbons in. Under the assumption that growth does not alter this relative partition of non-biomass carbon among products, the carbon flow to butyrate is\n\n$$\nC_{\\text{but}}^{(E)} = \\frac{4}{5} \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) C_{\\text{cons}}^{(E)} = \\frac{4}{5} \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) 5 v = 4 \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) v.\n$$\n\nHence the molar butyrate production rate (divide by $4$ carbons per butyrate) is\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{but}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{but}}^{(E)}}{4} = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) v = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(E,\\text{cons})}.\n$$\n\n\nUsing $v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(E,\\text{cons})} = v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)}$ from Step 2, and $v_{\\text{Lac}}^{(B)} = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) F_{H}$ from Step 1, we obtain the consortium-level mapping from HMO input to butyrate output:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{but}} = \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(E)}\\right) \\left(1 - Y_{X/C}^{(B)}\\right) F_{H}.\n$$\n\n\nStep 4: Numerical evaluation. Substitute $F_{H} = 7.50$ $\\mathrm{mmol \\cdot h^{-1}}$, $Y_{X/C}^{(B)} = 0.15$, and $Y_{X/C}^{(E)} = 0.10$:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{but}} = \\left(1 - 0.10\\right)\\left(1 - 0.15\\right) \\times 7.50 = 0.90 \\times 0.85 \\times 7.50.\n$$\n\nCompute in steps:\n\n$$\n0.85 \\times 7.50 = 6.375,\\quad 0.90 \\times 6.375 = 5.7375.\n$$\n\n\nTherefore, the expected steady-state butyrate production rate is $5.7375$ $\\mathrm{mmol \\cdot h^{-1}}$.

The following processes occur:\n- Each attached entity produces free particles at per-capita rate $p$.\n- Each attached entity is lost at per-capita rate $\\delta$.\n- Each free particle is cleared at per-capita rate $c$.\n- Each free particle attaches to form a new attached entity at per-capita rate $a T_0$, but IgA neutralization reduces the effective attachment rate by a multiplicative factor $(1-\\phi)$, where $\\phi \\in [0,1]$ is the neutralizing fraction induced by microbiome-driven IgA maturation.
