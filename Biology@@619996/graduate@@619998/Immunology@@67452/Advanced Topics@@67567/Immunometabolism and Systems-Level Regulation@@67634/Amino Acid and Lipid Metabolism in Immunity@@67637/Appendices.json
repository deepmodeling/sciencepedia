The core of the problem relies on the direct application of the Michaelis–Menten equation and principles of stoichiometry, which are fundamental to biochemistry.\n\nThere is a potential ambiguity in the problem's definition of survival time. It is stated that CPT1A produces palmitoyl-carnitine, which would replenish the pool, while survival time is defined as the time to deplete this same pool. However, the problem provides an explicit directive: \"Assuming the FAO flux remains constant... determine the survival time... defined as the time until the available palmitoyl–carnitine pool is depleted.\" This constitutes a specific, albeit simplified, model for the calculation. We are instructed to treat the pool as a finite resource consumed at a constant rate, where this rate is determined by the CPT1A kinetics.

The residual activity $r(C) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + C/IC_{50}}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the drug concentration $C$, for $C \\geq 0$. Consequently, the term $-0.65 \\cdot r(C)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $C$. Therefore, the objective function $J_{\\mathrm{kill}}(C) = 1.65 - 0.65 \\cdot r(C)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $C$.\n\nTo maximize a monotonically increasing function, one must choose the largest possible value of its argument. In this problem, we must find the largest value of $C$ that is permitted by the constraint $J_{\\mathrm{tox}}(C) \\leq 1.20$. The optimal concentration $C^{\\ast}$ will therefore be at the boundary of the feasible region, where the constraint is active, i.e., $J_{\\mathrm{tox}}(C^{\\ast}) = 1.20$.\n\nWe solve this equation for $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n1.35 - 0.35 \\cdot r(C^{\\ast}) = 1.20\n$$\n$$\n0.35 \\cdot r(C^{\\ast}) = 1.35 - 1.20\n$$\n$$\n0.35 \\cdot r(C^{\\ast}) = 0.15\n$$\n$$\nr(C^{\\ast}) = \\dfrac{0.15}{0.35} = \\dfrac{15}{35} = \\dfrac{3}{7}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the definition of $r(C^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{1}{1 + C^{\\ast}/IC_{50}} = \\dfrac{3}{7}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\n1 + \\dfrac{C^{\\ast}}{IC_{50}} = \\dfrac{7}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\dfrac{C^{\\ast}}{IC_{50}} = \\dfrac{7}{3} - 1 = \\dfrac{4}{3}\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{4}{3} \\cdot IC_{50}\n$$\nThe problem provides $IC_{50} = 0.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Substituting this value:\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{4}{3} \\cdot 0.50 = \\dfrac{2}{3} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nAs a final step, we provide the numerical answer rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nC^{\\ast} \\approx 0.6666... \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.667\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.667}$$", "id": "2831870"}]}
