This exercise models the stochastic nature of V(D)J recombination, where random nucleotide additions can shift the reading frame, rendering the gene non-productive. By applying basic probability theory, you will calculate the overall success rate of this process, providing insight into the fundamental efficiency and logic of allelic exclusion [@problem_id:2835592].", "problem": "In developing B lymphocytes, immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement proceeds through attempted recombination events that generate a contiguous variable region exon, which will be translated only if the rearranged coding sequence preserves the triplet reading frame. From the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), translation reads nucleotide triplets, so frameshifted sequences are nonproductive. Empirical observations of random nucleotide addition and deletion at coding joints during V(D)J recombination support modeling the reading frame offset modulo three as approximately uniformly distributed; thus, under random junctional diversity, the probability that a completed heavy chain rearrangement yields an in-frame coding sequence is $1/3$ per attempt.\n\nConsider a simplified, yet biologically realistic, checkpoint model of pro-B cells:\n- Each cell can make at most two independent heavy chain rearrangement attempts, one on each allele, in sequence.\n- If the first attempt is in-frame, allelic exclusion halts further rearrangement; if the first attempt is out-of-frame, the cell proceeds to attempt rearrangement on the second allele.\n- There is no further rescue on an already-attempted allele, and attempts are conditionally independent with identical success probability $1/3$ for being in-frame, reflecting random junctional addition.\n\nStarting from these premises and the probabilistic independence of the two alleles’ attempts, derive the expected proportion of cells that successfully produce at least one in-frame heavy chain rearrangement and thus pass the heavy-chain checkpoint. Express your final probability as a single reduced fraction (no units, no percentage sign).", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a cell passes the heavy-chain checkpoint. This occurs if at least one of the two possible rearrangement attempts results in an in-frame sequence. Let $p$ denote the probability of a successful in-frame rearrangement for a single attempt. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe probability of a failed (out-of-frame) rearrangement is therefore:\n$$1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nLet $S$ be the event that the cell is successful. According to the model, a cell can achieve success through two mutually exclusive pathways:\n\n1.  The first rearrangement attempt on the first allele is successful. The probability of this event is $p$. Upon this success, the process halts due to allelic exclusion, and no further attempts are made.\n\n2.  The first attempt fails, but the second attempt on the second allele is successful. This is a compound event. The first part is the failure of the first attempt, which has a probability of $1 - p$. The second part is the success of the second attempt, which has a probability of $p$. Since the two attempts are described as independent events, the probability of this entire sequence is the product of their individual probabilities: $(1-p)p$.\n\nThe total probability of success, $P(S)$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint pathways.\n$$P(S) = (\\text{Probability of success on 1st attempt}) + (\\text{Probability of failure on 1st AND success on 2nd})$$\n$$P(S) = p + (1-p)p$$\nSubstituting the given value of $p = 1/3$ into this expression:\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $9$.\n$$P(S) = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nAlternatively, we can solve this by calculating the probability of the complementary event: total failure. A cell fails the checkpoint only if both rearrangement attempts are out-of-frame. Let $F$ be the event of total failure.\n$$F = (\\text{Failure on 1st attempt}) \\cap (\\text{Failure on 2nd attempt})$$\nThe probability of this event, due to independence, is:\n$$P(F) = (1-p)(1-p) = (1-p)^2$$\nSubstituting the value of $p$:\n$$P(F) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nThe probability of success, $P(S)$, is the complement of the probability of failure.\n$$P(S) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nBoth methods produce the same result, confirming the correctness of the derivation.
