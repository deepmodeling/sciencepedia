A B cell receptor (BCR) consists of a membrane immunoglobulin ($mIg$) heavy and light chain pair.\n2.  The $mIg$ is noncovalently associated with the heterodimer Immunoglobulin alpha ($Ig\\alpha$, also known as $CD79a$) and Immunoglobulin beta ($Ig\\beta$, also known as $CD79b$).\n3.  The cytoplasmic tails of $Ig\\alpha$ and $Ig\\beta$ contain Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs ($ITAMs$).\n4.  A biophysical rule states that oppositely charged residues within transmembrane helices promote specific helix-helix association in the low dielectric environment of the lipid bilayer.\n5.  Neutralization of these charges removes a dominant stabilizing interaction.\n6.  The native BCR's $mIg$ heavy chain contains a conserved basic residue (positively charged) in its transmembrane segment.\n7.  The native BCR's $Ig\\alpha$ and $Ig\\beta$ each contribute acidic residues (negatively charged) in their transmembrane segments.\n8.  These charged residues form a complementary electrostatic network stabilizing the tripartite association ($mIg + Ig\\alpha + Ig\\beta$).\n9.  This stable tripartite association is necessary for Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) exit.\n10. ER quality control permits export only of fully assembled complexes and retains or degrades unassembled subunits.\n11. An engineered mutant is considered where the acidic transmembrane residues in both $Ig\\alpha$ and $Ig\\beta$ are replaced by alanine.\n12. The cytoplasmic $ITAM$ tyrosines are left unchanged in the mutant.\n13. The question asks to predict the most likely outcome for BCR surface expression and proximal signaling in response to antigen.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The description of the BCR complex, the role of charged transmembrane residues in protein-protein interactions within a membrane, the function of $ITAMs$ in signaling, and the principle of ER quality control are all fundamental and well-established concepts in immunology and cell biology. The premises are factually sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear initial state (native BCR), a specific perturbation (mutation of charged residues to alanine), and a set of governing principles. It asks for a predictable final state (phenotype). A unique solution can be derived logically from the given information.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is scientifically sound, logically structured, and contains sufficient information to deduce a unique outcome. The principles provided are internally consistent and accurately reflect biological reality.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution is derived from the application of the principles provided to the specified mutation.\n\n1.  **Principle of Assembly**: The stable assembly of the tripartite BCR complex ($mIg+Ig\\alpha+Ig\\beta$) is stated to depend on a \"dominant stabilizing interaction\" (Given $4$, $5$). This interaction is an electrostatic network between a basic (positive) residue on the $mIg$ transmembrane segment and acidic (negative) residues on the $Ig\\alpha$ and $Ig\\beta$ transmembrane segments (Givens $6$, $7$, $8$). The attraction between opposite charges is particularly strong in the low dielectric constant environment of the lipid bilayer, as electrostatic forces are inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium.\n\n2.  **Effect of Mutation**: The mutation replaces the acidic residues in $Ig\\alpha$ and $Ig\\beta$ with alanine. Alanine is a small amino acid with an uncharged, nonpolar side chain. This constitutes a \"neutralization of those charges\" as described in Given $5$.\n\n3.  **Consequence for Assembly**: According to Given $5$, this neutralization \"removes a dominant stabilizing interaction\". The loss of the strong electrostatic attraction between the $mIg$ chain and the $Ig\\alpha/Ig\\beta$ heterodimer will severely compromise the free energy of association, $\\Delta G_{\\text{assoc}}$. A stable complex is characterized by a large negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{assoc}}$. Removing a dominant attractive force makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{assoc}}$ much less negative, or potentially positive, thereby preventing stable complex formation. The subunits ($mIg$, $Ig\\alpha$, $Ig\\beta$) will fail to associate correctly into the tripartite structure.\n\n4.  **Consequence for Trafficking**: According to Given $10$, \"ER quality control permits export only of fully assembled complexes and retains or degrades unassembled subunits\". Since the mutation prevents stable assembly, the individual BCR subunits or incorrectly assembled partial complexes will be recognized by the ER quality control machinery (such as chaperones like BiP) and retained within the ER lumen. Eventually, they are targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD).\n\n5.  **Consequence for Surface Expression**: As the assembled BCR complexes cannot exit the ER, they cannot be transported through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The direct consequence is a severe reduction, or complete absence, of BCRs on the B cell surface.\n\n6.  **Consequence for Signaling**: Proximal BCR signaling, both tonic (antigen-independent) and antigen-induced, is initiated at the plasma membrane. It requires the physical presence of the receptor complex, including the $ITAM$-containing $Ig\\alpha$ and $Ig\\beta$ subunits, at the cell surface. Although the $ITAMs$ themselves are structurally intact (Given $12$), their retention within the ER prevents their access to the plasma membrane-associated tyrosine kinases (e.g., Lyn, Fyn, Blk) that are responsible for their phosphorylation. Without phosphorylation of $ITAMs$, the entire downstream signaling cascade (involving Syk, PLC$\\gamma$2, etc.) cannot be initiated. Therefore, both tonic signaling (which relies on baseline receptor activity) and antigen-induced signaling will be ablated.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Severely reduced to absent BCR surface expression with loss of both tonic and antigen-induced signaling, because neutralization of the acidic transmembrane residues disrupts electrostatic helix-helix association with the basic mIg transmembrane residue, preventing stable assembly and ER export; ITAMs remain intact but are not phosphorylated because the complex does not reach the plasma membrane.**\n    This option provides a complete and accurate summary of the derived consequences. It correctly links the charge neutralization to failed assembly, failed assembly to failed ER export, failed ER export to loss of surface expression, and loss of surface expression to a complete loss of signaling capability. The reasoning is sound and follows directly from the premises.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Normal BCR surface expression because export signals in the Igα/Igβ cytoplasmic tails suffice for trafficking, but impaired signaling because alanine substitutions in the transmembrane segments impede access of kinases to the ITAM tyrosines.**\n    This option is incorrect. It falsely assumes that cytoplasmic export signals can override the stringent ER quality control that monitors protein complex assembly. The problem explicitly states that ER exit requires the complex to be \"fully assembled\". The primary defect is in assembly and trafficking, not a subtle impairment of kinase access at the membrane. The premise of normal surface expression is fundamentally flawed.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Increased BCR surface expression with constitutive signaling, because neutral transmembrane helices avoid electrostatic repulsion and therefore favor oligomerization and clustering in the membrane.**\n    This option is incorrect. It misinterprets the nature of the original interaction. The interaction between the basic $mIg$ residue and the acidic $Ig\\alpha/\\beta$ residues is attractive, not repulsive. Neutralizing the acidic residues removes this attraction; it does not \"avoid repulsion\" to favor assembly. Therefore, the premise for increased expression and constitutive signaling is based on a false understanding of electrostatics and protein interactions.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Normal BCR surface expression with selective loss of antigen-induced signaling but preserved tonic signaling, because neutralization weakens only high-avidity clustering while allowing baseline assembly and export.**\n    This option is incorrect. It wrongly posits that the electrostatic interaction is a minor factor affecting only higher-order clustering, rather than a \"dominant stabilizing interaction\" critical for the formation of the fundamental BCR unit itself (Given $5$). If baseline assembly is prevented, as deduced, then there can be no surface expression, and consequently, neither tonic nor antigen-induced signaling can occur. The premise of normal surface expression is incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2834798"}, {"introduction": "The initial event that triggers a B cell response is the binding of an antigen to the B cell receptor.

The problem provides the *bulk* antigen concentration, $[L]$. The derivation implicitly assumes that the binding of ligand to the receptors on the cell surface does not significantly deplete this bulk concentration. In other words, we assume the concentration of free ligand at equilibrium is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration added to the system, i.e., $[L]_{free} \\approx [L]_{total}$. This assumption is valid when the total concentration of receptors in the entire system volume is much less than both the ligand concentration and the dissociation constant $K_D$. Given that the receptors are confined to cell surfaces within a typically much larger solution volume, this condition is almost always met for soluble ligands in standard experimental setups. Under this assumption, the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is determined solely by the intrinsic affinity of the interaction ($K_D$) and the ambient ligand concentration ($[L]$), and not by the number of receptors available.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the provided values: $K_D = 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and $[L] = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M} + 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}}$$\nTo simplify the expression, we can write $10^{-8}$ as $10 \\times 10^{-9}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{10^{-9}}{10^{-9} + 10 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{10^{-9}}{11 \\times 10^{-9}}$$\nThe term $10^{-9}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{11}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.09090909...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.09091$$\n\nRegarding the stated receptor surface density of $10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}^{-2}$: under the assumption of non-depletion of the soluble ligand, this value is irrelevant for calculating the *fractional occupancy*, $\\theta$. As demonstrated, $\\theta$ depends only on $[L]$ and $K_D$. The receptor density would become a necessary parameter if one were asked to calculate the *absolute number* of bound ligands per cell, or if the system conditions were such that ligand depletion was significant (e.g., very high cell density in a small volume), thereby violating our primary assumption.
