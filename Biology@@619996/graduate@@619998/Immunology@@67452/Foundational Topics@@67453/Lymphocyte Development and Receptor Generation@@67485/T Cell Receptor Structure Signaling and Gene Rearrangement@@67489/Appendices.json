Therefore, a solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires a quantitative analysis of the molecular composition of the TCR signaling apparatus. The total number of ITAMs is the sum of the ITAMs contributed by each individual polypeptide chain within the complex.\n\nFirst, we must enumerate the constituent chains of the specified TCR complex. The complex consists of:\n- One CD$3$ $\\gamma\\varepsilon$ heterodimer, which contributes one CD$3$ $\\gamma$ chain and one CD$3$ $\\varepsilon$ chain.\n- One CD$3$ $\\delta\\varepsilon$ heterodimer, which contributes one CD$3$ $\\delta$ chain and a second CD$3$ $\\varepsilon$ chain.\n- One $\\zeta\\zeta$ homodimer, which contributes two identical $\\zeta$ chains.\n\nSumming these components, the total inventory of signaling chains per TCR complex is:\n- $1$ CD$3$ $\\gamma$ chain\n- $1$ CD$3$ $\\delta$ chain\n- $2$ CD$3$ $\\varepsilon$ chains\n- $2$ $\\zeta$ chains\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ITAMs contributed by each type of chain, using the given values.\nLet $N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\text{chain})$ be the number of ITAMs on a given chain. The problem states:\n- $N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\gamma) = 1$\n- $N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\delta) = 1$\n- $N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\varepsilon) = 1$\n- $N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\zeta) = 3$\n\nThe total number of ITAMs, denoted $N_{\\text{ITAM, total}}$, is the sum of the ITAMs from all chains in the complex:\n$$\nN_{\\text{ITAM, total}} = (1 \\times N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\gamma)) + (1 \\times N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\delta)) + (2 \\times N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\varepsilon)) + (2 \\times N_{\\text{ITAM}}(\\zeta))\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN_{\\text{ITAM, total}} = (1 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 3)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{ITAM, total}} = 1 + 1 + 2 + 6\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{ITAM, total}} = 10\n$$\nThus, a single, complete TCR complex contains a total of $10$ ITAMs.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the maximum number of ZAP-$70$ molecules that can be recruited. The problem provides a simplifying, idealized condition: \"each ITAM can recruit at most $1$ ZAP-$70$ molecule.\" This establishes a one-to-one stoichiometric relationship between the number of available ITAM docking sites and the number of recruited ZAP-$70$ molecules.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{ZAP-70, max}}$ be the maximum number of recruited ZAP-$70$ molecules. Given the one-to-one binding, this number is equal to the total number of ITAMs.\n$$\nN_{\\text{ZAP-70, max}} = N_{\\text{ITAM, total}}\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nN_{\\text{ZAP-70, max}} = 10\n$$\n\nThe two quantities to be reported are the total number of ITAMs and the maximum number of recruited ZAP-$70$ molecules, in that order.

The setup is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed and Complete**: The problem is self-contained. It provides a clear initial state, a specific perturbation (the mutation), and defines the functions of all relevant components. This information is sufficient to deduce the logical consequences on the downstream pathways in question. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid. It presents a logical challenge based on established principles of signal transduction.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires tracing the consequences of the LAT Y$132$F mutation through the two specified signaling cascades: the calcium pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Calcium Signaling Pathway**:\n    -   According to definition (ii), PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ is the enzyme responsible for generating $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ and DAG from $\\mathrm{PIP}_2$.\n    -   The problem states that the LAT Y$132$F mutation abolishes the binding and, by extension, the recruitment and activation of PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ at the plasma membrane.\n    -   Without active PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$, the production of its downstream product, $\\mathrm{IP}_3$, will be severely impaired.\n    -   Definition (iii) states that $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ is the trigger for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum.\n    -   Therefore, the loss of $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ production will lead to a strong diminishment or complete abolition of intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux.\n    -   A secondary consequence, related to $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling, is the activation of the transcription factor NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells). NFAT activation is dependent on the phosphatase calcineurin, which is itself $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent. Thus, a lack of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux will also severely impair NFAT activation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Ras-MAPK (ERK) Signaling Pathway**:\n    -   Definition (v) describes two parallel pathways for Ras activation, which leads to ERK phosphorylation.\n    -   **Pathway 1 (RasGRP1-dependent)**: This pathway is dependent on DAG (definition v), which recruits RasGRP$1$ (definition iii). As established above, the LAT Y$132$F mutation blocks the PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ activity required for DAG production. Therefore, this branch of Ras activation will be non-functional or severely impaired.\n    -   **Pathway 2 (SOS-dependent)**: This pathway is dependent on Grb$2$ (definition v), which recruits SOS (definition iv). The problem explicitly states that the Grb$2$-binding tyrosines on LAT are intact and phosphorylated normally. Thus, the Grb$2$-SOS complex can still be recruited to the LAT signalosome, and SOS, a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), can activate Ras. This branch of Ras activation remains functional.\n    -   **Net Effect on ERK**: Since one of the two parallel pathways for Ras activation (the Grb$2$-SOS axis) is preserved, Ras will still be activated, leading to downstream phosphorylation of ERK. The total level of ERK phosphorylation may be modestly reduced compared to a wild-type cell because the contribution from the RasGRP$1$ pathway is lost, but it will not be abolished. The signal will be \"near-normal\" or partially reduced, but certainly not absent.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n-   **Calcium Signaling**: Strongly diminished $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux and NFAT activation.\n-   **Ras-MAPK Signaling**: Largely preserved ERK phosphorylation, sustained by the intact Grb$2$-SOS pathway, with a possible modest reduction in overall signal amplitude due to the loss of the parallel RasGRP$1$ pathway.\n\n**Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Strongly diminished $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux and Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) activation, with near-normal ERK phosphorylation via Grb2–SOS, potentially with a modest reduction in amplitude due to loss of DAG input to RasGRP$1$.**\n    This option perfectly aligns with the derived consequences. It correctly identifies the severe impact on the calcium/NFAT axis and the preservation of the ERK axis via the redundant Grb$2$–SOS pathway, while acknowledging the potential for a modest decrease due to the loss of the RasGRP$1$ input.\n    **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Preserved $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux due to compensatory phospholipase C-$\\beta$ activity, but loss of ERK phosphorylation because Ras activation requires PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ exclusively.**\n    This option is incorrect on two counts. First, it invokes a compensatory mechanism (PLC-$\\beta$) not mentioned in the problem statement; based on the given information, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux must be impaired. Second, it falsely claims that Ras activation requires PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ exclusively, directly contradicting definition (v) which describes the Grb$2$-dependent SOS pathway.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Strong impairment of both $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux and ERK phosphorylation because both strictly require PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ recruitment to LAT.**\n    This option is partially correct in stating that $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux is strongly impaired. However, it is incorrect in stating that ERK phosphorylation is also strongly impaired. This fails to account for the parallel, PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$-independent pathway for Ras activation via Grb$2$-SOS.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Enhanced ERK phosphorylation due to increased Grb$2$ occupancy on LAT, with no change in $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux.**\n    This option is incorrect. The claim of \"no change in $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux\" is a direct contradiction of the necessary role of PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$ in producing $\\mathrm{IP}_3$. The idea of \"enhanced ERK phosphorylation\" is speculative and not supported by the provided text, but the error regarding calcium signaling is definitive.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. Loss of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-$\\kappa$B) activation only, with preservation of both $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux and ERK phosphorylation.**\n    This option is incorrect. It wrongly claims preservation of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux. Furthermore, while NF-$\\kappa$B activation is indeed dependent on the PLC-$\\gamma$ $1$-DAG-PKC$\\theta$ pathway and would be impaired, it would not be the *only* pathway affected; the calcium/NFAT pathway is also critically impacted.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2894325"}]}
