In a simplified, single-attempt-per-allele model, assume the following well-established features of the recombination mechanism:\n\n1. Recombination requires pairing (synapsis) of recombination signal sequences (RSS). Let the probability that a given allele establishes correct synapsis be $p_{s}$.\n2. Conditional on synapsis, recombination activating gene (RAG) nuclease generates a double-strand break (RSS cleavage). Let the probability that cleavage occurs, given synapsis, be $p_{c}$.\n3. The coding joint, if formed, has a one-in-three chance of being in-frame. Let the frame usage probability be $p_{f} = \\frac{1}{3}$, consistent with equiprobable reading frames.\n\nAssume independence of the above events on a given allele and independence across alleles. Also assume perfect feedback inhibition via the pre-TCR checkpoint: the second allele only attempts recombination if and only if the first allele fails to produce a productive (in-frame) rearrangement. Each allele can be tried at most once.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the definition of independence in probability theory, derive a closed-form analytical expression for the probability that the cell achieves at least one productive TCR $\\beta$ rearrangement after allowing biallelic attempts with feedback inhibition. Express your final answer as a function of $p_{s}$ and $p_{c}$ with $p_{f} = \\frac{1}{3}$.

The setup is well-posed, self-contained, and uses objective, formalizable language. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the total probability of achieving at least one productive T cell receptor (TCR) $\\beta$ chain rearrangement.\n\nFirst, let us determine the probability of a productive rearrangement on a single allele. Let this probability be denoted by $P_{success}$. A productive rearrangement requires a sequence of three dependent events to occur: correct synapsis, subsequent cleavage, and finally, the formation of an in-frame coding joint.\n\nLet $E_s$ be the event of correct synapsis. The probability is given as $P(E_s) = p_s$.\nLet $E_c$ be the event of RAG-mediated cleavage. The probability is given as conditional on synapsis: $P(E_c | E_s) = p_c$.\nLet $E_f$ be the event that the resulting joint is in-frame. The formation of a joint requires that both synapsis and cleavage have occurred. The probability of an in-frame joint is given as conditional on its formation: $P(E_f | E_s \\cap E_c) = p_f = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of a successful, productive rearrangement on a single allele, $P_{success}$, is the probability of the intersection of these three events, $P(E_s \\cap E_c \\cap E_f)$. Using the chain rule for probabilities:\n$$P_{success} = P(E_s \\cap E_c \\cap E_f) = P(E_f | E_s \\cap E_c) \\times P(E_c | E_s) \\times P(E_s)$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$$P_{success} = p_f \\cdot p_c \\cdot p_s$$\nGiven $p_f = \\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$P_{success} = \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c$$\n\nNow, we must consider the process of biallelic recombination with feedback inhibition. The cell has two chances to achieve a productive rearrangement: on the first allele, and if that fails, on the second allele. Let $P_{total}$ be the total probability of success.\n\nThe event of achieving at least one productive rearrangement is the complement of the event where both allelic attempts fail. It is often simpler to calculate the probability of total failure and subtract it from $1$.\n\nLet $F_1$ be the event that the first allele fails to produce a productive rearrangement. The probability of this event is:\n$$P(F_1) = 1 - P_{success} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c$$\n\nAccording to the problem's rule of feedback inhibition, the second allele is attempted only if the first one fails. Let $F_2$ be the event that the second allele fails. The probability of failure for the second allele, given that it is attempted, is the same as for the first, due to the stated independence across alleles:\n$$P(F_2) = 1 - P_{success} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c$$\n\nThe total failure of the thymocyte to produce a productive TCR $\\beta$ chain is the event that the first allele fails AND the second allele fails ($F_1 \\cap F_2$). Since the attempt on the second allele is contingent on the failure of the first, and the intrinsic outcomes are independent, the probability of total failure is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{total failure}) = P(F_1) \\times P(F_2) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right)^2$$\n\nThe probability of at least one success, $P_{total}$, is therefore $1$ minus the probability of total failure:\n$$P_{total} = 1 - P(\\text{total failure}) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right)^2$$\n\nTo obtain the final expression, we expand the squared term:\n$$P_{total} = 1 - \\left(1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right)^2\\right)$$\n$$P_{total} = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3} p_s p_c + \\frac{1}{9} p_s^2 p_c^2\\right)$$\n$$P_{total} = 1 - 1 + \\frac{2}{3} p_s p_c - \\frac{1}{9} p_s^2 p_c^2$$\n$$P_{total} = \\frac{2}{3} p_s p_c - \\frac{1}{9} p_s^2 p_c^2$$\n\nThis expression represents the probability that the cell achieves at least one productive TCR $\\beta$ rearrangement, derived strictly from the given premises and fundamental principles of probability theory.

The parameter $\\alpha_8$ becomes $\\alpha_8' = s \\alpha_8$. The signaling rates are given by $\\lambda_i = \\lambda_0 / \\alpha_i$. Thus, the post-perturbation rates are:\n- $\\lambda_4 = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\alpha_4}$ (unchanged)\n- $\\lambda_8' = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\alpha_8'} = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{s \\alpha_8}$\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall fraction of mature cells in each lineage is the weighted sum of the contributions from each subpopulation. Let $N_{CD4}$ be the number of mature CD4 cells and $N_{CD8}$ be the number of mature CD8 cells from a total population of $N$ selecting thymocytes.\nThe total number of CD4 cells is:\n$$N_{CD4} = N \\times P(C_4) = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} P(C_4 | M_{\\mathrm{II}}) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} P(C_4 | M_{\\mathrm{I}}) \\right)$$\n$$N_{CD4} = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c) \\right)$$\nThe total number of CD8 cells is:\n$$N_{CD8} = N \\times P(C_8) = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} P(C_8 | M_{\\mathrm{II}}) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} P(C_8 | M_{\\mathrm{I}}) \\right)$$\n$$N_{CD8} = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c)) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c)) \\right)$$\n\nThe CD4:CD8 ratio, denoted by $R$, is the ratio of the total number of CD4 cells to the total number of CD8 cells. The factor $N$ cancels.\n$$R = \\frac{N_{CD4}}{N_{CD8}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c)}{f_{\\mathrm{II}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c)) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c))}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates in terms of the given parameters:\n$$R = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{\\alpha_4}\\right) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{s \\alpha_8}\\right)}{f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{\\alpha_4}\\right)\\right) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{s \\alpha_8}\\right)\\right)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the post-perturbation CD4:CD8 ratio.\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values: $f_{\\mathrm{I}} = 0.6$, $f_{\\mathrm{II}} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{0} = 0.6 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}$, $T_{c} = 5.0 \\, \\text{min}$, $\\alpha_{4} = 3.0$, $\\alpha_{8} = 1.0$, and $s = 0.5$.\n\nFirst, we compute the exponents for the exponential functions:\n- For the MHC class II restricted group (using $\\alpha_4$):\n$$-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{\\alpha_4} = -\\frac{0.6 \\times 5.0}{3.0} = -\\frac{3.0}{3.0} = -1.0$$\n- For the MHC class I restricted group (using $\\alpha_8'$):\n$$-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{s \\alpha_8} = -\\frac{0.6 \\times 5.0}{0.5 \\times 1.0} = -\\frac{3.0}{0.5} = -6.0$$\n\nNext, we substitute these values into the expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{0.4 \\exp(-1.0) + 0.6 \\exp(-6.0)}{0.4 (1 - \\exp(-1.0)) + 0.6 (1 - \\exp(-6.0))}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression numerically:\nThe exponential terms are:\n$\\exp(-1.0) \\approx 0.367879$\n$\\exp(-6.0) \\approx 0.002479$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$N_R = (0.4 \\times 0.367879) + (0.6 \\times 0.002479) \\approx 0.147152 + 0.001487 = 0.148639$\n\nThe denominator is:\n$D_R = 0.4 \\times (1 - 0.367879) + 0.6 \\times (1 - 0.002479)$\n$D_R = (0.4 \\times 0.632121) + (0.6 \\times 0.997521) \\approx 0.252848 + 0.598513 = 0.851361$\n\nThe final ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{0.148639}{0.851361} \\approx 0.174599$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $R = 0.1746$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1746}$$", "id": "2893263"}]}
