Under the single-hit model, a recipient engrafts if and only if it receives at least one LT-HSC.

The outcome is binary: either engraftment occurs or it does not. We are given that the number of non-engrafted recipients is $x_i$ out of $n_i$. The probability of no engraftment for a given dose $c_i$ is given by the single-hit Poisson model as $p_i = \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)$. Consequently, the probability of engraftment is $1 - p_i = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)$.\n\nThe number of non-engrafted mice $x_i$ in a group of $n_i$ mice follows a binomial distribution with probability mass function:\n$$ L_i(\\lambda) = \\binom{n_i}{x_i} p_i^{x_i} (1-p_i)^{n_i-x_i} = \\binom{n_i}{x_i} [\\exp(-\\lambda c_i)]^{x_i} [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)]^{n_i-x_i} $$\nSince the four dose groups are independent, the total likelihood function $L(\\lambda)$ is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$ L(\\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} L_i(\\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\binom{n_i}{x_i} \\exp(-\\lambda c_i x_i) [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)]^{n_i-x_i} $$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $\\lambda$, it is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\lambda) = \\ln(L(\\lambda))$:\n$$ \\ell(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left[ \\ln\\binom{n_i}{x_i} - \\lambda c_i x_i + (n_i - x_i) \\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)) \\right] $$\nThe MLE, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is found by setting the first derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\\lambda$ (the score function) to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{d\\lambda} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left[ -c_i x_i + (n_i - x_i) \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)) \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{d\\lambda} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left[ -c_i x_i + (n_i - x_i) \\frac{c_i \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)} \\right] $$\nSetting $\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\lambda} = 0$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\left[ -x_i + \\frac{(n_i - x_i) \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)} \\right] = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\frac{-x_i(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)) + (n_i - x_i) \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\frac{n_i \\exp(-\\lambda c_i) - x_i}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda c_i)} = 0 $$\nWhile this equation would typically be solved numerically, the provided data reveals a specific structure.

At this value, $x_i = n_i \\exp(-\\hat{\\lambda} c_i)$, so $n_i - x_i = n_i(1 - \\exp(-\\hat{\\lambda} c_i))$.

Use boolean literals in lowercase as in many programming languages (true/false) if your language uses such representation; in Python, booleans render as True/False and are acceptable.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-defined computational task grounded in the principles of single-cell data analysis, specifically RNA velocity modeling for inferring cell fate trajectories in hematopoiesis. All necessary data, mathematical definitions, and parameters are provided, rendering the problem self-contained, objective, and scientifically sound. I will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to construct a Markov model of cell state transitions based on RNA velocity vectors and to validate this model against independent lineage barcoding data. The system comprises four cell clusters representing a hematopoietic differentiation path: Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC), Multipotent Progenitor (MPP), Common Myeloid Progenitor (CMP), and Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor (GMP). The clusters are indexed from $0$ to $3$ in this order.\n\nFirst, we establish a reference point for each cluster $k$ by computing its centroid, $\\mathbf{c}_k$, as the arithmetic mean of the coordinates of all cells within that cluster.\n$$\n\\mathbf{c}_k = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{cluster } k} \\mathbf{x}_i\n$$\nwhere $N_k$ is the number of cells in cluster $k$ and $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is the coordinate vector of cell $i$.\n\nNext, we compute the transition probability from each cell to all possible target clusters. For a cell $i$ in a source cluster $s$ with position $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}_i$, its transition tendency towards a target cluster $t$ is quantified by the alignment of its velocity vector with the displacement vector pointing to the target cluster's centroid. The displacement vector is $\\mathbf{d}_{i,t} = \\mathbf{c}_t - \\mathbf{x}_i$. The alignment is measured by the cosine similarity between $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{d}_{i,t}$. We define an alignment score $a_{i,t}$ as the non-negative part of this cosine similarity:\n$$\na_{i,t} = \\max\\left\\{0, \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{d}_{i,t}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_i\\|_2 \\|\\mathbf{d}_{i,t}\\|_2}\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ is the Euclidean norm. If either $\\mathbf{v}_i$ or $\\mathbf{d}_{i,t}$ is a zero vector, its norm is $0$, and we define $a_{i,t} = 0$. These scores are then normalized to yield per-cell transition probabilities $p_{i,t}$:\n$$\np_{i,t} = \\frac{a_{i,t}}{\\sum_{u=0}^{3} a_{i,u}}\n$$\nThis normalization is performed only if $\\sum_{u} a_{i,u} > 0$. If a cell's velocity vector shows no positive alignment to any cluster centroid (i.e., $\\sum_{u} a_{i,u} = 0$), we employ a fallback mechanism. The probabilities are then based on the inverse exponential of the Euclidean distance to cluster centroids, governed by a temperature parameter $\\sigma = 1.0$:\n$$\np_{i,t} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{d}_{i,t}\\|_2}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nThese values are subsequently normalized to sum to $1$.\n\nThe cluster-to-cluster transition probability, $P_{s,t}$, from a source cluster $s$ to a target cluster $t$, is computed by averaging the per-cell probabilities $p_{i,t}$ for all cells $i$ belonging to cluster $s$. Each row of the resulting matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ is then re-normalized to ensure it is row-stochastic.\n$$\nP_{s,t} = \\frac{1}{N_s} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{cluster } s} p_{i,t} \\quad \\text{followed by row-normalization}\n$$\n\nTo model multi-step differentiation processes, we compute the $k$-step transition matrix by taking the $k$-th power of $\\mathbf{P}$, denoted $\\mathbf{P}^k$. The problem specifies $k=3$ to represent the canonical steps from HSC to GMP. The entry $(\\mathbf{P}^3)_{0,3}$ thus represents the $3$-step transition probability from HSC (index $0$) to GMP (index $3$).\n\nWe then assess the \"directional support\" for the HSC-to-GMP trajectory. This is a boolean condition which is true if and only if the $3$-step probability of transitioning from HSC to GMP is strictly greater than the $3$-step probabilities of transitioning from HSC to any of the other clusters (including itself). Let $\\mathbf{P}^{(3)} = \\mathbf{P}^3$. The condition is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}^{(3)}_{0,3} > \\mathbf{P}^{(3)}_{0,0} \\quad \\land \\quad \\mathbf{P}^{(3)}_{0,3} > \\mathbf{P}^{(3)}_{0,1} \\quad \\land \\quad \\mathbf{P}^{(3)}_{0,3} > \\mathbf{P}^{(3)}_{0,2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we validate the velocity-inferred one-step transition probabilities against an independent experimental modality, lineage barcoding, represented by a given transition matrix $\\mathbf{B}$. The comparison is performed for the HSC source cluster (the first row of matrices $\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD). For two probability distributions $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$, JSD is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{JSD}(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) = \\frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(\\mathbf{p} \\| \\mathbf{m}) + \\frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(\\mathbf{q} \\| \\mathbf{m})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{m} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{q})$ is the mixture distribution, and $D_{KL}(\\mathbf{p} \\| \\mathbf{m}) = \\sum_j p_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_j}{m_j}\\right)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The convention $0 \\ln(0/x) = 0$ is applied. A validation is considered successful if the computed JSD is less than or equal to a threshold $\\tau = 0.25$.\n\nFor each test case, we will compute four values: the directional support boolean, the $3$-step HSC-to-GMP probability, the JSD between HSC rows of $\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, and the validation pass boolean. The floating-point numbers will be rounded to $6$ decimal places.", "answer": "```\n[[true,0.444738,0.170669,true],[false,0.258810,0.052601,true],[false,0.250000,0.106841,true]]\n```", "id": "2852618"}]}
