All necessary parameters and definitions are provided. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the specificity ratio and evaluate it under specific conditions. Let us begin from first principles.\n\nLet $P(\\tau)$ be the probability of productive signaling for a ligand with a mean bound lifetime $\\tau$. This requires the completion of $N$ sequential proofreading steps before the ligand-receptor complex dissociates.\n\nThe dissociation of the complex is a Poisson process with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 1/\\tau$. Each proofreading step is an independent Poisson process with rate $k_{\\mathrm{p}}$.\n\nConsider the first proofreading step. For this step to be successful, it must occur before the complex dissociates. We have two competing, independent exponential processes: proofreading (rate $k_{\\mathrm{p}}$) and dissociation (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$). According to the provided rule, the probability that the event with rate $k_{\\mathrm{p}}$ occurs before the event with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is given by:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{step}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{p}}}{k_{\\mathrm{p}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$$\nSubstituting $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 1/\\tau$, we have:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{step}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{p}}}{k_{\\mathrm{p}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{p}}\\tau}{k_{\\mathrm{p}}\\tau + 1}$$\nAfter one successful proofreading step, the system must complete the next step. Due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the remaining lifetime of the complex is still exponentially distributed with the same mean $\\tau$. Since all $N$ proofreading steps are independent and have the same rate $k_{\\mathrm{p}}$, the probability of success for each step is identical.\n\nFor a productive signal to be generated, all $N$ steps must complete successfully before dissociation. The probability of this sequence of events is the product of the probabilities for each individual step:\n$$P(\\tau) = (P_{\\mathrm{step}})^N = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{p}}\\tau}{1 + k_{\\mathrm{p}}\\tau} \\right)^N$$\nThis is the exact expression for the probability of productive signaling.\n\nThe problem specifies that we must work in the regime where proofreading is rate-limiting, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{p}} \\ll 1/\\tau$.

It demonstrates that kinetic proofreading amplifies the ratio of ligand lifetimes by a power of $N$.\n\nWe are now required to evaluate this expression for the given values: $N=3$, $\\tau_1 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\tau_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.
