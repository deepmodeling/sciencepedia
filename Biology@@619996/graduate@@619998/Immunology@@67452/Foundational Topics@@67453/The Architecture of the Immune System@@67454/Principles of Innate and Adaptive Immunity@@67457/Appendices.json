A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the principle of conservation of flux at steady state. The steady-state condition dictates that the rate of change of the number of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes, $N$, on the cell surface is zero.

The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Removal})\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$, which leads to the condition:\n$$\n(\\text{Rate of Production}) = (\\text{Rate of Removal})\n$$\n\nFirst, we define the rate of production of pMHC complexes that arrive at the cell surface.\n1.  Peptides are generated in the cytosol at a constant rate $r$ (peptides per cell per unit time).\n2.  A fraction $\\alpha$ of these peptides is transported into the endoplasmic reticulum. The flux of peptides into the ER is therefore $r \\alpha$.\n3.  Of those peptides that enter the ER, a fraction $\\beta$ is successfully loaded onto MHC class I molecules. The problem states a stoichiometric relationship where each loaded peptide yields one pMHC complex. Therefore, the rate of formation of pMHC complexes destined for the cell surface is $(r \\alpha) \\beta = r \\alpha \\beta$.\nThis is the rate of production, or influx, of pMHC complexes to the plasma membrane.

The rate of removal, or efflux, $J_{\\text{out}}$, is given by:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{out}} = \\gamma N\n$$\nThe units of $\\gamma$ are (time)$^{-1}$, and the units of $N$ are (complexes per cell).

We substitute this into our expression for $G([L])$:\n$$\nG(x K_m) = \\frac{K_m}{K_m + 2(x K_m)}\n$$\nSince $K_m$ is a non-zero dissociation constant, we can factor it out from the denominator and simplify:\n$$\nG(x K_m) = \\frac{K_m}{K_m(1 + 2x)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2x}\n$$\nThe problem requires us to find the smallest $x$ that satisfies the inequality $G([L]) \\leq 0.05$.

This value is exact.\nThe physical interpretation is that a ligand concentration of at least $9.5$ times the effective Michaelis constant is required to ensure that doubling the ligand concentration results in a signaling output increase of no more than $5\\%$.

The antigen is a high-affinity peptide presented at high density on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The APC expresses CD80 and CD86, but you administer a monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28) from engaging its ligands. You then measure early signaling readouts (calcium flux and phosphorylation of proximal kinases), transcriptional outputs (Interleukin-2 (IL-2) messenger ribonucleic acid and c-Fos), metabolic reprogramming markers (ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and glucose uptake), and clonal expansion over several days. \n\nStarting from the two-signal model of T cell activation (signal one via the T cell receptor (TCR) engaging peptide–MHC and signal two via costimulation, canonical example CD28–CD80/CD86), and the well-established fact that CD28 promotes Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt–mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and Protein kinase C-theta ($PKC-\\theta$)–dependent activation of Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ($NF-\\kappa B$) and Activator protein 1 (AP-1), predict how blockade of CD28 affects the activation threshold in the presence of strong antigen and explain the mechanistic basis.

CD28 blockade increases the activation threshold (rightward shift in the half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$) and reduces the maximal proliferative response; mechanistically, loss of CD28-driven PI3K–Akt–mTORC1 and PKC-θ–dependent NF-κB and AP-1 activation uncouples Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) from its partners, limiting IL-2 transcription and stability and impairing metabolic reprogramming, so that even with strong antigen, TCR-only signaling yields calcium and NFAT but insufficient IL-2 and bioenergetic support for full clonal expansion.\n\nB. CD28 blockade lowers the activation threshold because it prevents Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen $4$ (CTLA-4) recruitment to the synapse, thereby enhancing TCR signal strength and Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation; the maximal response increases due to reduced activation-induced cell death.\n\nC. In the presence of strong antigen, CD28 blockade does not alter the activation threshold or the maximal response because high-affinity TCR ligation saturates downstream pathways; PI3K–Akt and NF-κB become fully activated independently of CD28.\n\nD.

The predictions are experimentally verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe activation of a naive T lymphocyte requires two distinct signals.\nSignal 1 is delivered through the T cell receptor (TCR) upon engagement with a peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex on an APC. The problem states this signal is strong (\"high-affinity peptide presented at high density\"). This signal is sufficient to initiate the proximal signaling cascade, including phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the CD3 complex, recruitment and activation of ZAP-70 kinase, and subsequent triggering of downstream pathways. These pathways include:\n1.  Activation of Phospholipase C-gamma 1 ($PLC\\gamma1$), leading to the generation of inositol trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG). $IP_3$ mediates calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) release from the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in $Ca^{2+}$ flux and activation of the phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT), allowing its translocation into the nucleus.\n2.  Activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, which leads to the formation and activation of the transcription factor Activator Protein 1 (AP-1), a heterodimer of Fos and Jun proteins. The problem's mention of c-Fos measurement is pertinent here.\n\nSignal 2 is a costimulatory signal, prototypically delivered by the engagement of CD28 on the T cell with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, on the APC. In this problem, this signal is specifically blocked by a monoclonal antibody. The established functions of CD28 signaling, provided in the problem, are crucial: promotion of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling and enhancement of $NF-\\kappa B$ and AP-1 activation.\n\nThe consequence of blocking CD28 must be analyzed in the context of a strong Signal 1.\n- **Effect on Transcription**: Full transcriptional activation of key genes, such as IL-2, requires the cooperative assembly of multiple transcription factors on the gene's promoter and enhancer regions. The IL-2 promoter famously requires the synergistic binding of NFAT, AP-1, and $NF-\\kappa B$. While strong TCR signaling (Signal 1) can induce NFAT translocation and some level of AP-1 activation, it is insufficient for potent $NF-\\kappa B$ activation. CD28 signaling, via its recruitment of components that activate $PKC-\\theta$, is critical for robust $NF-\\kappa B$ activation. Without CD28 input, the tripartite complex at the IL-2 promoter is incomplete or unstable, leading to weak and transient IL-2 gene transcription. Furthermore, CD28 signaling is known to stabilize IL-2 mRNA, preventing its rapid degradation. Loss of this signal means any IL-2 mRNA that is produced will have a short half-life. The outcome is a profound deficit in IL-2 production.\n- **Effect on Metabolism**: T cell clonal expansion is an enormously energy-intensive process requiring a massive increase in nutrient uptake and biosynthesis. This metabolic reprogramming is controlled by the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway. CD28 is the principal activator of this pathway in T cells. TCR signaling alone provides only weak and transient PI3K activation. Without CD28 costimulation, the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis is not engaged effectively. Consequently, the cell fails to upregulate glucose transporters (like Glut1), increase glucose uptake and glycolysis, or boost protein synthesis (a process monitored by phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of mTORC1). The cell remains in a state of metabolic quiescence, unable to support the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of cell division.\n- **Overall Phenotype**: A T cell receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2 enters a state known as anergy, or functional unresponsiveness. It fails to produce sufficient IL-2 to drive its own proliferation and cannot undergo sustained clonal expansion.\n- **Dose-Response Analysis**: The \"activation threshold\" refers to the concentration of antigen required to elicit a response. Costimulation (Signal 2) lowers this threshold, allowing T cells to respond to lower amounts of antigen. Conversely, blocking costimulation increases the antigen requirement for any given level of activation. This corresponds to a rightward shift in the dose-response curve and an increase in the half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$). The \"maximal response\" refers to the response at saturating antigen concentrations. Even with a strong, saturating Signal 1, the absence of Signal 2 creates a bottleneck. The lack of metabolic reprogramming and insufficient IL-2 production places a hard ceiling on the proliferative capacity. Therefore, the maximal response is also significantly reduced.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A**: This option states that CD28 blockade increases the activation threshold ($EC_{50}$) and reduces the maximal response. It correctly attributes this to the loss of CD28-driven PI3K–Akt–mTORC1 and $PKC-\\theta$-dependent $NF-\\kappa B$ and AP-1 activation, which prevents full IL-2 transcription and stability by uncoupling NFAT from its partners. It correctly concludes that TCR-only signaling provides early signals ($Ca^{2+}$, NFAT) but is insufficient for clonal expansion. This aligns perfectly with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n- **B**: This option claims that CD28 blockade *lowers* the activation threshold. This is the opposite of the established role of CD28. It incorrectly conflates the function of CD28 (an activating receptor) with the blockade of an inhibitory receptor like Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Blocking CD28 is immunosuppressive, not activating. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C**: This option suggests that a strong Signal 1 can completely compensate for the absence of Signal 2. This contradicts the fundamental principle of the two-signal model. While strong TCR stimulation can partially activate some downstream pathways, it cannot qualitatively replace the unique and essential contributions of CD28 signaling, particularly regarding robust metabolic reprogramming via PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 and IL-2 mRNA stabilization. The maximal response is demonstrably not independent of CD28. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D**: This option correctly states that the activation threshold is increased but incorrectly claims the maximal response is unchanged. As explained, the maximal proliferative response is critically dependent on costimulation. The mechanistic explanation is also flawed; CD28 signaling does not primarily act on early calcium flux, and transcriptional/metabolic programs are not determined entirely by TCR signal strength. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E**: This option proposes a compensatory upregulation of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) that restores proliferation. While CD25 is upregulated upon activation, this is futile if the ligand, IL-2, is not being produced in sufficient quantities. The primary defect caused by CD28 blockade is the failure of IL-2 production itself. Upregulating the receptor cannot fix a lack of the ligand. Proliferation is not normalized. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of T cell activation principles, option A provides the most complete and accurate description of the experimental outcome and its underlying molecular mechanisms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2883955"}]}
