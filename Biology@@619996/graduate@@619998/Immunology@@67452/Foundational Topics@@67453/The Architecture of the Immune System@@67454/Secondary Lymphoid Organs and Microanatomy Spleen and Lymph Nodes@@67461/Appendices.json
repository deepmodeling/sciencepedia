The context is biophysical transport in immunology, which is a valid scientific domain. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary variables ($U$, $L$, $D$) for the derivation and calculation of a dimensionless number. The provided parameters are dimensionally consistent and are stated to be physiologically plausible. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe transport of a solute, such as the antigen of concentration $c(x, t)$, in a one-dimensional system is governed by the principle of conservation of mass. This principle is expressed through the advection-diffusion equation. The derivation begins with a mass balance over a differential control volume. In one dimension, this yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nwhere $J$ is the total flux of the antigen along the $x$-direction, and $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$ is the rate of change of concentration in time. The total flux $J$ is the sum of the advective flux, $J_{adv}$, due to bulk fluid motion, and the diffusive flux, $J_{diff}$, due to random molecular motion.\n\nThe constitutive expressions for these fluxes are:\n1.  Advective flux: $J_{adv} = U c$. This represents the transport of the solute carried by the bulk fluid moving at mean velocity $U$.\n2.  Diffusive flux: $J_{diff} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. This is Fick's first law, describing transport down a concentration gradient, where $D$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe total flux is therefore $J = J_{adv} + J_{diff} = Uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this expression for the total flux into the conservation equation gives the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( Uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) = 0 $$\nAssuming the velocity $U$ and diffusion coefficient $D$ are constant with respect to position $x$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the antigen concentration. To compare the relative importance of advection and diffusion, we perform a scaling analysis of the terms in this equation at steady state, or for any process where both transport mechanisms are active. We are interested in comparing the magnitude of the advection term, $U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, to the diffusion term, $D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nLet us estimate the order of magnitude of these terms using the characteristic scales provided. Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale over which the concentration changes significantly. Let $\\Delta c$ be the characteristic change in concentration over this length scale.\nThe first-order spatial derivative can be scaled as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c}{L} $$\nThe second-order spatial derivative can be scaled as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c/L}{L} = \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2} $$\nNow, we can estimate the magnitudes of the advection and diffusion terms:\n-   Magnitude of advection term: $|U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}| \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}$\n-   Magnitude of diffusion term: $|D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}| \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}$\n\nThe dimensionless group that compares advection to diffusion is the ratio of the magnitudes of these two terms:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Magnitude of Advection}}{\\text{Magnitude of Diffusion}} \\sim \\frac{U \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}}{D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}} $$\nSimplifying this expression, we obtain the dimensionless group:\n$$ \\frac{U L}{D} $$\nThis dimensionless number is known as the Péclet number, denoted $\\mathrm{Pe}$. It fundamentally represents the ratio of the rate of advective transport to the rate of diffusive transport.\n\nNext, we evaluate this dimensionless group for the given parameters:\n-   Characteristic length $L = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n-   Mean velocity $U = 50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   Diffusion coefficient $D = 80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the Péclet number:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D} = \\frac{(50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}) (200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m})}{80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}} $$\nThe units are consistent and cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless number:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{10000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1000}{8} = 125 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $125$, which already contains three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we determine which transport mechanism dominates. The Péclet number provides this information:\n-   If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\gg 1$, the advective transport rate is much greater than the diffusive transport rate, and thus advection dominates.\n-   If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\ll 1$, the diffusive transport rate is much greater than the advective transport rate, and thus diffusion dominates.\n-   If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\approx 1$, both mechanisms are of comparable importance.\n\nIn this case, $\\mathrm{Pe} = 125$. Since $125 \\gg 1$, advection is the dominant mode of antigen transport along the subcapsular sinus under these conditions. The bulk flow of lymph is far more effective at transporting the antigen over the length scale of $200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ than molecular diffusion is.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{125}\n$$", "id": "2888207"}, {"introduction": "While lymph nodes filter lymph, the spleen's unique open circulation is specialized for filtering the blood.

Particles exchange between blood and spleen with first-order rate constants $k_{bs}$ (blood to spleen) and $k_{sb}$ (spleen to blood). Elimination occurs via hepatic macrophages from blood with rate constant $k_{h}$ and via splenic filtering from the spleen with rate constant $k_{f}$.

A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe system dynamics are described by a set of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations based on mass balance. For the pre-splenectomy case:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_b}{dt} = k_{sb}A_s(t) - k_{bs}A_b(t) - k_h A_b(t) = k_{sb}A_s(t) - (k_{bs} + k_h)A_b(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA_s}{dt} = k_{bs}A_b(t) - k_{sb}A_s(t) - k_f A_s(t) = k_{bs}A_b(t) - (k_{sb} + k_f)A_s(t)\n$$\nThe problem states a \"rapid-exchange\" regime, where the intercompartmental transfer rates ($k_{bs}$, $k_{sb}$) are much greater than the elimination rates ($k_h$, $k_f$). This justifies the quasi-equilibrium assumption, which posits that the distribution of particles between the two compartments reaches equilibrium on a timescale much faster than that of elimination. At this equilibrium, the net rate of transfer between the compartments is approximately zero:\n$$\nk_{bs}A_b(t) \\approx k_{sb}A_s(t)\n$$\nThis allows us to express the amount in the spleen as a function of the amount in the blood:\n$$\nA_s(t) \\approx \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}} A_b(t)\n$$\nThe total amount of particles in the system is $A_{total}(t) = A_b(t) + A_s(t)$. We can express $A_{total}(t)$ in terms of $A_b(t)$:\n$$\nA_{total}(t) \\approx A_b(t) + \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}} A_b(t) = \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}\\right) A_b(t) = \\left(\\frac{k_{sb} + k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}\\right) A_b(t)\n$$\nUnder the quasi-equilibrium assumption, the system behaves as a single compartment containing $A_{total}(t)$ that decays with an effective first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{eff,pre}}$. The rate of change of the total amount is the sum of the rates of change of the individual compartments:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{total}}{dt} = \\frac{dA_b}{dt} + \\frac{dA_s}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the original differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{total}}{dt} = (k_{sb}A_s - (k_{bs} + k_h)A_b) + (k_{bs}A_b - (k_{sb} + k_f)A_s)\n$$\nThe intercompartmental transfer terms cancel, leaving only the elimination terms:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{total}}{dt} = -k_h A_b(t) - k_f A_s(t)\n$$\nTo find the effective rate constant, we must express the right-hand side in terms of $A_{total}(t)$. We use the quasi-equilibrium relationship to define the fractions of the total amount in each compartment. The fraction in blood, $f_b$, is:\n$$\nf_b = \\frac{A_b}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_b}{A_b + A_s} = \\frac{A_b}{A_b + \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}A_b} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}} = \\frac{k_{sb}}{k_{sb} + k_{bs}}\n$$\nSimilarly, the fraction in the spleen, $f_s$, is:\n$$\nf_s = \\frac{A_s}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_s}{A_b + A_s} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}A_b}{A_b + \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}A_b} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}}{1 + \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb}}} = \\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb} + k_{bs}}\n$$\nSubstituting $A_b = f_b A_{total}$ and $A_s = f_s A_{total}$ into the equation for $\\frac{dA_{total}}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{total}}{dt} = -k_h (f_b A_{total}) - k_f (f_s A_{total}) = -(k_h f_b + k_f f_s) A_{total}\n$$\nThis is a first-order decay process $\\frac{dA_{total}}{dt} = -k_{\\text{eff,pre}} A_{total}$, where the effective elimination rate constant for the pre-splenectomy case is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff,pre}} = k_h f_b + k_f f_s = k_h \\left(\\frac{k_{sb}}{k_{sb} + k_{bs}}\\right) + k_f \\left(\\frac{k_{bs}}{k_{sb} + k_{bs}}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff,pre}} = \\frac{k_h k_{sb} + k_f k_{bs}}{k_{sb} + k_{bs}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the post-splenectomy case, the splenic compartment does not exist. The model reduces to a single compartment (blood) with elimination only via the liver.

The time rate of change of the cell count in a compartment is the sum of all influx rates minus the sum of all efflux rates.\n\n**1. Formulate the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nFor the paracortical compartment, the number of lymphocytes is $N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$.\n- **Influx**: Lymphocytes enter from the blood via HEVs at a constant rate $F = k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}$.\n- **Efflux**: Lymphocytes leave the paracortex by two routes:\n    - Transit to the medulla, with rate $k_{\\mathrm{transit}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$.\n    - Cell death, with rate $k_{\\mathrm{death}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$.\n\nThe conservation equation for the paracortex is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{P}}}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}}_{\\text{Influx}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)}_{\\text{Transit to M}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{death}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)}_{\\text{Death}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{P}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}} - (k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}) N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)\n$$\n\nFor the medullary compartment, the number of lymphocytes is $N_{\\mathrm{M}}(t)$.\n- **Influx**: Lymphocytes enter from the paracortex at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{transit}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$.\n- **Efflux**: Lymphocytes leave the medulla by two routes:\n    - Egress to efferent lymph, with an effective rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{egress,eff}} = (1 - f) k_{\\mathrm{egress}}$. The rate is $k_{\\mathrm{egress,eff}} N_{\\mathrm{M}}(t)$.\n    - Cell death, with rate $k_{\\mathrm{death}} N_{\\mathrm{M}}(t)$.\n\nThe conservation equation for the medulla is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{M}}}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)}_{\\text{Influx from P}} - \\underbrace{(1 - f) k_{\\mathrm{egress}} N_{\\mathrm{M}}(t)}_{\\text{Egress}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{death}} N_{\\mathrm{M}}(t)}_{\\text{Death}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{M}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{transit}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) - ((1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}) N_{\\mathrm{M}}(t)\n$$\n\n**2. Solve for Steady-State Population Numbers**\n\nAt steady state, the cell numbers are constant, so the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{P}}}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{M}}}{dt} = 0$. The steady-state populations are denoted $N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast}$.\n\nFrom the paracortex equation at steady state:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}} - (k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}) N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}}{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}}\n$$\n\nFrom the medulla equation at steady state:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{transit}} N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} - ((1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}) N_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $N_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{ (1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}} } N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$ into the equation for $N_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{ (1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}} } \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}}{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}} k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{(k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}) ((1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}})}\n$$\n\n**3. Derive the Total Steady-State Number**\n\nThe total steady-state number of lymphocytes in the lymph node, $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\ast}$, is the sum of the numbers in the two compartments:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\ast} = N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} + N_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}}{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}} k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{(k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}) ((1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}})}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\ast} = N_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_P^*$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}}{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify, combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} = \\frac{(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}} + k_{\\mathrm{transit}}}{(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}}\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the total steady-state lymphocyte number is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} C_{\\mathrm{blood}}}{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + (1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}}{(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression to be implemented for computation. It is physically meaningful only if the denominators are non-zero. Since all rate constants are inherently non-negative, $k_{\\mathrm{transit}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}} > 0$ and $(1 - f)k_{\\mathrm{egress}} + k_{\\mathrm{death}} > 0$ as long as $k_{\\mathrm{death}} > 0$, which is true for all test cases. The special case where $f=1$ (full blockade) is handled correctly as long as $k_{\\mathrm{death}} > 0$. If $k_{\\mathrm{death}} = 0$ and $f=1$, the model predicts an infinite accumulation of cells in the medulla, which is physically correct under the model assumptions (no exit path). In our cases, this does not occur.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total steady-state number of lymphocytes in a lymph node model\n    for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (C_blood, k_entry, k_transit, k_egress, f, k_death)\n    test_cases = [\n        (2000, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.01),  # Case 1\n        (2000, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0, 0.01),    # Case 2\n        (2000, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 1, 0.01),    # Case 3 (boundary, full blockade)\n        (0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.01),     # Case 4 (edge, no influx)\n        (1500, 0.5, 5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.02)     # Case 5 (fast transit)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        C_blood, k_entry, k_transit, k_egress, f, k_death = case\n\n        # The derived formula for the total steady-state lymphocyte number is:\n        # N_tot_star = N_p_star + N_m_star\n        # where N_p_star = (k_entry * C_blood) / (k_transit + k_death)\n        # and N_m_star = (k_transit * N_p_star) / ((1 - f) * k_egress + k_death)\n        \n        # We can write N_tot_star = N_p_star * (1 + k_transit / ((1 - f) * k_egress + k_death))\n        \n        # Check for zero influx, which directly results in zero cells.\n        if k_entry * C_blood == 0:\n            N_tot_star = 0.0\n        else:\n            # Denominators for N_p_star and N_m_star calculations\n            den_p = k_transit + k_death\n            den_m = (1 - f) * k_egress + k_death\n\n            #\n            # The problem is well-posed for the given test cases, ensuring denominators are non-zero.\n            # Den_p will be positive since k_transit and k_death are positive.\n            # Den_m will be positive since k_death > 0.\n            #\n            \n            # Calculate steady-state number in the paracortex\n            N_p_star = (k_entry * C_blood) / den_p\n            \n            # Calculate steady-state number in the medulla\n            N_m_star = (k_transit * N_p_star) / den_m\n            \n            # Total steady-state number\n            N_tot_star = N_p_star + N_m_star\n\n        # Round the result to the nearest integer\n        results.append(round(N_tot_star))\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2888215"}]}
