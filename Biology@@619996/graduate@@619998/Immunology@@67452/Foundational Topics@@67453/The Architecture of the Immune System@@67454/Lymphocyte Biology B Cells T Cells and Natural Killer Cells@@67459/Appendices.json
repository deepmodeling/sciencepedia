Consider the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus with exactly $V$ distinct $V$ segments, $D$ distinct $D$ segments, and $J$ distinct $J$ segments available for recombination. Assume the following:\n- Segment choices are independent and equally likely across available segments.\n- Junctional diversity occurs independently at the $V$–$D$ and $D$–$J$ junctions.\n- At each junction, the number of inserted non-templated nucleotides is a random variable $N$ that follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$.\n- Each inserted nucleotide is independently and uniformly chosen from the set of $4$ deoxyribonucleotides.\n- Discard any effects of exonucleolytic trimming, palindromic additions, codon structure, reading frame constraints, or selection; count distinct nucleotide-level complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences only.\n\nStarting from first principles that combinatorial diversity multiplies across independent choices and that the number of distinct sequences formed by an insertion of length $n$ is $4^{n}$, derive the expected total number of distinct nucleotide-level CDR3 sequences generated by a single round of heavy chain recombination under these assumptions.

No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is a valid theoretical problem in quantitative immunology. I will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total diversity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) arises from two primary sources as defined in the problem: combinatorial diversity and junctional diversity. The problem states that segment choices are independent and that junctional diversity at the two junctions occurs independently. Under the assumption of independence, the total number of distinct a priori possible sequences is the product of the number of options at each stage. Since junctional diversity involves a random process (the number of nucleotide insertions), we must calculate the *expected* total number of sequences.\n\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of distinct nucleotide-level CDR3 sequences. This number can be expressed as the product of the number of choices from three independent sources:\n$1$. The number of combinatorial V-D-J segment pairings, which we denote as $N_{comb}$.\n$2$. The number of distinct nucleotide sequences generated at the $V$–$D$ junction, denoted as $N_{junc, VD}$.\n$3$. The number of distinct nucleotide sequences generated at the $D$–$J$ junction, denoted as $N_{junc, DJ}$.\n\nThus, the total number of sequences is the random variable $N_{total} = N_{comb} \\times N_{junc, VD} \\times N_{junc, DJ}$. We are tasked with finding its expected value, $E[N_{total}]$.\nDue to the independence of these processes, the expectation of the product is the product of the expectations:\n$$E[N_{total}] = E[N_{comb} \\times N_{junc, VD} \\times N_{junc, DJ}]$$\nSince $N_{comb}$ is a deterministic quantity and the two junctional diversity events are independent, this simplifies to:\n$$E[N_{total}] = N_{comb} \\times E[N_{junc, VD}] \\times E[N_{junc, DJ}]$$\n\nWe will now calculate each term separately.\n\nFirst, we address the combinatorial diversity, $N_{comb}$.\nThe problem provides $V$ distinct $V$ segments, $D$ distinct $D$ segments, and $J$ distinct $J$ segments. The choice of one segment from each category is independent. Therefore, the total number of unique V-D-J combinations is the product of the number of available segments in each class:\n$$N_{comb} = V \\times D \\times J$$\nThis is a constant value.\n\nSecond, we address the junctional diversity. This process occurs at two independent locations: the $V$–$D$ junction and the $D$–$J$ junction. The underlying mechanism is identical for both, so we can analyze a single junction and apply the result to both $E[N_{junc, VD}]$ and $E[N_{junc, DJ}]$.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of non-templated nucleotides inserted at a junction. The problem states that $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability mass function for $N$ is:\n$$P(N=n) = \\frac{\\lambda^{n} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{n!}, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nFor each inserted nucleotide, there are $4$ possible choices (A, C, G, T), selected uniformly and independently. If $n$ nucleotides are inserted, the number of distinct sequences that can be formed is $4 \\times 4 \\times \\dots \\times 4$ ($n$ times), which is $4^n$.\nThe number of sequences generated at a junction, which we denote $N_{junc}$, is therefore a random variable whose value is $4^N$. We must find the expected value of this random variable, $E[N_{junc}] = E[4^N]$.\n\nUsing the definition of the expected value of a function of a discrete random variable, we have:\n$$E[4^N] = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 4^n P(N=n)$$\nSubstituting the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution:\n$$E[4^N] = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 4^n \\frac{\\lambda^{n} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{n!}$$\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-\\lambda)$ as it does not depend on the summation index $n$:\n$$E[4^N] = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{4^n \\lambda^n}{n!}$$\nWe can combine the terms with the exponent $n$:\n$$E[4^N] = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(4\\lambda)^n}{n!}$$\nThe summation term is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}$. In our case, $x = 4\\lambda$.\nTherefore, the sum evaluates to $\\exp(4\\lambda)$:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(4\\lambda)^n}{n!} = \\exp(4\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for the expectation:\n$$E[4^N] = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\exp(4\\lambda) = \\exp(4\\lambda - \\lambda) = \\exp(3\\lambda)$$\nSo, the expected number of distinct sequences generated at a single junction is $\\exp(3\\lambda)$.\nSince the processes at the $V$–$D$ and $D$–$J$ junctions are identical and independent, we have:\n$$E[N_{junc, VD}] = \\exp(3\\lambda)$$\n$$E[N_{junc, DJ}] = \\exp(3\\lambda)$$\n\nFinally, we combine these results to find the total expected number of distinct CDR3 sequences.\n$$E[N_{total}] = N_{comb} \\times E[N_{junc, VD}] \\times E[N_{junc, DJ}]$$\n$$E[N_{total}] = (V \\times D \\times J) \\times \\exp(3\\lambda) \\times \\exp(3\\lambda)$$\n$$E[N_{total}] = VDJ \\exp(3\\lambda + 3\\lambda)$$\n$$E[N_{total}] = VDJ \\exp(6\\lambda)$$\n\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the expected total number of distinct CDR3 sequences under the given idealized assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{VDJ \\exp(6\\lambda)}$$", "id": "2865307"}, {"introduction": "A T cell's decision to activate is not a simple on/off switch but a carefully integrated outcome of competing positive and negative signals.
