The objective is to quantify the impact of this feedback by comparing the signaling response to a cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) stimulus in a naive system versus a system previously primed by an initial stimulus.\n\nFirst, we formalize the stated biological mechanisms into a mathematical model. We are given three state variables: the concentration of active STING, denoted $A(t)$; the concentration of an interferon proxy, $F(t)$; and the concentration of USP13, $U(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of active STING, $A(t)$, are governed by its activation and deactivation. Activation is driven by the cGAMP input signal, $c(t)$, and depends on the available pool of inactive STING, $S(t)$. Given the conservation law $S_{\\mathrm{tot}} = S(t) + A(t)$, where $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total STING concentration, the inactive pool is $S(t) = S_{\\mathrm{tot}} - A(t)$. The activation rate, following mass-action kinetics, is thus $k_{\\mathrm{on}} c(t) (S_{\\mathrm{tot}} - A(t))$. Deactivation occurs through two pathways: a basal, first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and a feedback-driven deubiquitination process. The latter's rate is proportional to both active STING, $A(t)$, and the protease concentration, $U(t)$, with a rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{du}}$. Combining these terms, the total deactivation rate is $(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{du}} U(t))A(t)$. The resulting ODE for $A(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} c(t) (S_{\\mathrm{tot}} - A) - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{du}} U) A $$\n\nNext, we model the interferon proxy, $F(t)$. Its production is stipulated to be first-order with respect to active STING, $A(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{IFN}}$. It undergoes first-order decay with rate constant $k_{F}$. This translates to the following linear ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{IFN}} A - k_{F} F $$\n\nFinally, we describe the dynamics of the feedback regulator, USP13, represented by $U(t)$. Its production is a sum of a constant basal rate, $u_{0}$, and an interferon-induced term proportional to $F(t)$ with rate constant $k_{U}$. Its degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{dU}$. The ODE for $U(t)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = u_{0} + k_{U} F - k_{dU} U $$\n\nThe system of three coupled ODEs is thus fully defined. The initial conditions are specified for a system at basal steady-state, absent any cGAMP stimulus: $A(0) = 0$, $F(0) = 0$, and $U(0) = u_{0} / k_{dU}$. The last condition represents the steady state of the third ODE when $F=0$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to perform a numerical experiment to compare two scenarios. In the \"naive\" scenario, the system is subjected to a single cGAMP pulse, $c(t) = g_{2}$ for $t \\in [0, T_{2}]$. In the \"primed\" scenario, the system receives a preliminary pulse, $c(t) = g_{1}$ for $t \\in [0, T_{1}]$, followed by a recovery period of duration $\\Delta T$ where $c(t)=0$, and then the same second pulse, $c(t) = g_{2}$ for $t \\in [T_{1} + \\Delta T, T_{1} + \\Delta T + T_{2}]$.\n\nThe signaling output is defined as $Y(t) = k_{\\mathrm{IFN}} A(t)$. We are tasked with computing the ratio $R = Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{primed}} / Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{naive}}$. Here, $Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{naive}}$ is the maximum value of $Y(t)$ during the pulse in the naive simulation, i.e., for $t \\in [0, T_{2}]$. Similarly, $Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{primed}}$ is the maximum of $Y(t)$ during the *second* pulse in the primed simulation, i.e., for $t \\in [T_{1} + \\Delta T, T_{1} + \\Delta T + T_{2}]$. This ratio $R$ quantifies the attenuation of the signaling response due to the prior stimulation.\n\nTo solve this, we will implement a program that numerically integrates the ODE system for each test case under both naive and primed conditions. We will use a standard numerical integration routine from the SciPy library, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, which is suitable for such initial value problems. To accurately determine the maximum of $Y(t)$ within the specified time windows, the integrator's dense output feature will be utilized. This allows for evaluation of the solution on a fine time grid covering the window of interest, ensuring the peak value is not missed. For each parameter set, the program will execute the two simulations, find the respective peak outputs, compute the ratio $R$ according to the specified rules, and format the result as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and solves a dynamical model of the cGAS-STING pathway to compute\n    the effect of IFN priming on subsequent signaling.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Parameter tuple order:\n    # p = (k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot, g1, T1, delta_T, g2, T2)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.05, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 120.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.05, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 120.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.0, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 120.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.5, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.1, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 120.0, 10.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.05, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 600.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for params_tuple in test_cases:\n        k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot, g1, T1, delta_T, g2, T2 = params_tuple\n\n        def odes(t, y, c_func, params):\n            \"\"\"Defines the system of ODEs for the cGAS-STING model.\"\"\"\n            k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot = params\n            A, F, U = y\n            c_val = c_func(t)\n            dAdt = k_on * c_val * (S_tot - A) - (k_off + k_du * U) * A\n            dFdt = k_IFN * A - k_F * F\n            dUdt = u0 + k_U * F - k_dU * U\n            return [dAdt, dFdt, dUdt]\n\n        # Shared initial conditions and ODE parameters\n        y0 = [0.0, 0.0, u0 / k_dU if k_dU > 0 else 0.0]\n        ode_params = (k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot)\n        integrator_kwargs = {'method': 'RK45', 'dense_output': True, 'rtol': 1e-6, 'atol': 1e-9}\n\n        # --- Naive Simulation ---\n        def c_func_naive(t):\n            return g2 if 0.0 <= t <= T2 else 0.0\n\n        t_span_naive = [0.0, T2]\n        Y_max_naive = 0.0\n        \n        if T2 > 0:\n            sol_naive = solve_ivp(\n                lambda t, y: odes(t, y, c_func_naive, ode_params),\n                t_span_naive,\n                y0,\n                **integrator_kwargs\n            )\n            t_eval_naive = np.linspace(t_span_naive[0], t_span_naive[1], 500)\n            y_eval_naive = sol_naive.sol(t_eval_naive)\n            A_sol_naive = y_eval_naive[0]\n            Y_naive = k_IFN * A_sol_naive\n            if Y_naive.size > 0:\n                Y_max_naive = np.max(Y_naive)\n\n        # --- Primed Simulation ---\n        def c_func_primed(t):\n            if 0.0 <= t <= T1:\n                return g1\n            elif T1 + delta_T <= t <= T1 + delta_T + T2:\n                return g2\n            else:\n                return 0.0\n\n        t_end_primed = T1 + delta_T + T2\n        t_span_primed = [0.0, t_end_primed]\n        Y_max_primed = 0.0\n\n        sol_primed = solve_ivp(\n            lambda t, y: odes(t, y, c_func_primed, ode_params),\n            t_span_primed,\n            y0,\n            **integrator_kwargs\n        )\n            \n        t_window_start = T1 + delta_T\n        t_window_end = t_end_primed\n\n        if t_window_start < t_window_end:\n            t_eval_primed = np.linspace(t_window_start, t_window_end, 500)\n            y_eval_primed = sol_primed.sol(t_eval_primed)\n            A_sol_primed = y_eval_primed[0]\n            Y_primed = k_IFN * A_sol_primed\n            if Y_primed.size > 0:\n                Y_max_primed = np.max(Y_primed)\n\n        # --- Calculate Ratio R as per problem specification ---\n        if Y_max_naive == 0.0:\n            R = 1.0 if Y_max_primed == 0.0 else 0.0\n        else:\n            R = Y_max_primed / Y_max_naive\n        \n        results.append(f\"{R:.3f}\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2839431"}]}
