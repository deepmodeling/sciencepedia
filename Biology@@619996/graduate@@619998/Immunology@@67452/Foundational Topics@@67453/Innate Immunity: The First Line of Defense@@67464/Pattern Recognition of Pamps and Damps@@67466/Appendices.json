By reasoning through the distinct roles of adaptors like TIRAP and TRAM, you will explore how the compartmentalization of signaling—from the plasma membrane versus the endosome—allows the cell to generate qualitatively different responses to the same PAMP.", "problem": "A research group is dissecting how pattern recognition receptor pathways parse pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into discrete transcriptional outputs. As a fundamental base, recall that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect PAMPs and DAMPs and signal through adaptor proteins to activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). In this framework: Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP; also called MyD88 Adaptor-Like, MAL) localizes Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response Protein MyD88 (MyD88) to plasma-membrane TLRs (notably TLR2 and TLR4); TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) recruits TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) to endosomal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and a delayed phase of NF-κB. TLR2 recognizes bacterial lipopeptides and signals via MyD88; Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a prototypical PAMP and signals via both MyD88 and TRIF, the latter after endocytosis. Cluster of Differentiation 14 (CD14) promotes TLR4 internalization, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) is a TRIF-biased TLR4 agonist.\n\nYou engineer a macrophage line bearing a loss-of-function mutation in TIRAP that abolishes its phosphoinositide-dependent membrane localization but leaves MyD88, TRAM, TRIF, and TLR expression unchanged. You stimulate cells with $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ (a TLR2/1 agonist) or LPS (a TLR4 agonist) and measure early IκBα degradation at $t = 15$ minutes, IRF3 phosphorylation at $t = 60$ minutes, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion at $t = 4$ hours, and interferon-β (IFN-β) at $t = 6$ hours. You are asked to predict the signaling consequences of the TIRAP mutation for TLR2 and TLR4, and to propose a scientifically grounded compensatory intervention that leverages the TRAM–TRIF axis to recover signaling where possible.\n\nWhich option best integrates the predicted effects and a mechanism-centered compensation?\n\nA. The TIRAP mutation abolishes both TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Early NF-κB, late NF-κB, and IRF3 activation are lost for both $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ and LPS. Overexpressing TRAM cannot compensate because TRIF requires prior MyD88 priming.\n\nB. The TIRAP mutation abrogates MyD88-dependent signaling by TLR2 and the early MyD88 arm of TLR4, markedly reducing IκBα degradation at $t = 15$ minutes and TNF-α at $t = 4$ hours for $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ and LPS. However, LPS still induces TRAM–TRIF–IRF3 signaling from endosomes, preserving IRF3 phosphorylation at $t = 60$ minutes and IFN-β at $t = 6$ hours. A targeted compensation is to drive TLR4 into the TRAM–TRIF pathway by promoting CD14-dependent endocytosis (for example, supplying soluble CD14 or using TRIF-biased MPLA) together with TRAM overexpression, which restores type I interferon and delayed NF-κB outputs for LPS but cannot rescue $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ responses.\n\nC.

The described roles of the adaptors TIRAP, MyD88, TRAM, and TRIF, and the differential signaling of TLR2 and TLR4 from distinct cellular compartments (plasma membrane vs. endosomes) are scientifically accurate and represent the canonical understanding in the field of immunology. The experimental design, including the specific mutation, stimuli, and readouts, is coherent and poses a well-defined question in molecular and cellular biology. The problem is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities. It is complete, objective, and testable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires a systematic analysis of the TLR signaling network, first by predicting the impact of a specific molecular perturbation (TIRAP loss-of-function) and then by designing a rational intervention.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the TIRAP Mutation's Impact:**\n    - The function of TIRAP is to act as a sorting adaptor, recruiting MyD88 to TLRs located at the plasma membrane, specifically TLR2 and TLR4. The mutation ablates this function.\n    - **Consequence for TLR2 signaling (stimulated by $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$):** The problem states TLR2 signals exclusively via MyD88. Since TIRAP is essential for recruiting MyD88 to TLR2 at the plasma membrane, a loss-of-function mutation in TIRAP will abrogate all TLR2 signaling. Therefore, upon stimulation with $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$, there will be no early IκBα degradation (no NF-κB activation) and consequently no TNF-α secretion. TLR2 does not signal via the TRIF pathway, so IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-β secretion would be zero, both in wild-type and mutant cells.\n    - **Consequence for TLR4 signaling (stimulated by LPS):** TLR4 has two signaling arms.\n        - The **MyD88-dependent arm** originates at the plasma membrane and requires TIRAP. The TIRAP mutation will abolish this arm. This leads to the loss of early NF-κB activation, so IκBα degradation at $t=15$ minutes will be absent or severely reduced.\n        - The **TRIF-dependent arm** originates from endosomes following TLR4 internalization. This arm requires the adaptor TRAM to recruit TRIF. The problem explicitly states that TRAM and TRIF function are intact. The activation of this pathway is therefore independent of TIRAP. Consequently, upon LPS stimulation, the TRAM-TRIF pathway will be activated, leading to IRF3 phosphorylation at $t=60$ minutes and subsequent IFN-β secretion at $t=6$ hours. This arm also activates a \"delayed phase of NF-κB\", which may still induce some TNF-α, but the loss of the strong, early MyD88-dependent induction will lead to a marked reduction in total TNF-α secretion.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Compensatory Intervention:**\n    - The objective is to leverage the TRAM–TRIF axis. This is only possible for TLR4, which uses this axis. It is impossible for TLR2.\n    - To enhance the TRAM-TRIF pathway, one must promote the cellular processes that lead to its activation. According to the problem, this pathway is initiated from endosomes. Thus, any intervention that increases the amount of TLR4 in endosomes or boosts the signaling efficiency of the endosomal complex will be effective.\n    - **Proposed Strategies:**\n        1.  **Promote TLR4 endocytosis:** The problem states CD14 promotes TLR4 internalization. Supplying excess soluble CD14 would enhance this process, driving more TLR4 into the endosomal TRIF-dependent pathway.\n        2.  **Use a TRIF-biased agonist:** The problem defines MPLA as such an agonist. Using MPLA instead of LPS would inherently favor the TRIF pathway.\n        3.  **Overexpress pathway components:** Overexpressing TRAM, the specific sorting adaptor for the TRIF pathway at TLR4, would increase the efficiency of TRIF recruitment and enhance signaling flux.\n    - A scientifically sound compensation would combine these strategies to maximize the remaining TRIF-dependent outputs (IFN-β and delayed NF-κB) for TLR4 but would be unable to rescue TLR2 signaling.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The TIRAP mutation abolishes both TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Early NF-κB, late NF-κB, and IRF3 activation are lost for both $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ and LPS. Overexpressing TRAM cannot compensate because TRIF requires prior MyD88 priming.**\n    This option is **Incorrect**. It incorrectly claims that TLR4 signaling is completely abolished. The TRAM-TRIF pathway for TLR4 is independent of TIRAP and remains functional, preserving IRF3 activation and IFN-β production. The claim that TRIF requires MyD88 priming is also contrary to the established model of bifurcating TLR4 signaling presented in the problem.\n\n*   **B. The TIRAP mutation abrogates MyD88-dependent signaling by TLR2 and the early MyD88 arm of TLR4, markedly reducing IκBα degradation at $t = 15$ minutes and TNF-α at $t = 4$ hours for $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ and LPS. However, LPS still induces TRAM–TRIF–IRF3 signaling from endosomes, preserving IRF3 phosphorylation at $t = 60$ minutes and IFN-β at $t = 6$ hours. A targeted compensation is to drive TLR4 into the TRAM–TRIF pathway by promoting CD14-dependent endocytosis (for example, supplying soluble CD14 or using TRIF-biased MPLA) together with TRAM overexpression, which restores type I interferon and delayed NF-κB outputs for LPS but cannot rescue $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$ responses.**\n    This option is **Correct**. Its prediction of signaling outcomes aligns perfectly with the derived analysis: TLR2 signaling is lost; for TLR4, the MyD88 arm is lost but the TRIF arm is preserved. The proposed compensation strategy is mechanistically sound, targeting the specific steps (endocytosis, TRIF-biased agonism, adaptor overexpression) that enhance the remaining functional pathway. It correctly notes that this compensation is specific to TLR4 and cannot rescue TLR2.\n\n*   **C. The TIRAP mutation diverts TLR2 to signal via TRAM–TRIF from endosomes, rescuing IRF3 and IFN-β for $\\text{Pam}_3\\text{CSK}_4$. A suitable compensation is to co-treat with poly(I:C) to further bias TLR2 toward TRIF, thereby restoring both early and late NF-κB.**\n    This option is **Incorrect**. It proposes a non-existent signaling pathway where TLR2 is \"diverted\" to use TRAM-TRIF. There is no scientific basis for this rewiring. TLR2 is canonically restricted to the MyD88 pathway. Furthermore, poly(I:C) is a TLR3 agonist and has no role in modulating TLR2 signaling in the manner described.\n\n*   **D. The TIRAP mutation selectively enhances MyD88-independent reactive oxygen species production by TLR4 while suppressing TRAM–TRIF. To compensate, inhibit dynamin-dependent endocytosis to retain TLR4 at the plasma membrane and thereby strengthen TRAM–TRIF signaling for IFN-β induction.**\n    This option is **Incorrect**. It makes two fundamentally flawed claims. First, there is no basis to assume the TIRAP mutation would suppress TRAM-TRIF signaling. Second, the proposed compensation is contradictory. The TRIF pathway is explicitly stated to signal from endosomes, which requires endocytosis. Inhibiting endocytosis would therefore block, not strengthen, TRAM-TRIF signaling.\n\n*   **E. The TIRAP mutation impairs TLR2 but leaves TLR4 signaling entirely intact because TRIF is sufficient for all LPS responses. No compensation is required, and early NF-κB and TNF-α remain unchanged upon LPS stimulation.**\n    This option is **Incorrect**. It erroneously claims TLR4 signaling is \"entirely intact\". The MyD88-dependent arm is lost, which means early responses like IκBα degradation at $t=15$ minutes are not intact, and downstream outputs like TNF-α would not be \"unchanged\". TRIF is not sufficient for all LPS responses, particularly the early phase of NF-κB activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2879693"}, {"introduction": "An effective immune response requires distinguishing between different types of threats, such as a viral infection versus sterile tissue damage.

This crucial property allows us to factor the joint likelihood:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\mathbf{s} \\mid H) = \\prod_{i} \\Pr(s_i \\mid H)\n$$\nConsequently, the total log-likelihood ratio is the sum of the individual log-likelihood ratios for each receptor:\n$$\n\\text{LLR}_{\\text{total}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\prod_{i} \\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{V}})}{\\prod_{i} \\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{S}})}\\right) = \\sum_{i} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{V}})}{\\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{S}})}\\right) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ \\ln(\\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{V}})) - \\ln(\\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{S}})) \\right]\n$$\nEach observation $s_i$ is modeled by a log-normal distribution, $s_i \\mid H \\sim \\mathrm{LogNormal}(\\mu_{i,H}, \\sigma_i^2)$, with the probability density function:\n$$\n\\Pr(s_i \\mid H) = \\frac{1}{s_i \\sigma_i \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(\\ln s_i - \\mu_{i,H})^2}{2\\sigma_i^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe natural logarithm of this likelihood is:\n$$\n\\ln(\\Pr(s_i \\mid H)) = -\\ln(s_i) - \\ln(\\sigma_i) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi) - \\frac{(\\ln s_i - \\mu_{i,H})^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\n$$\nThe log-likelihood ratio for a single receptor $i$ is then:\n$$\n\\text{LLR}_i = \\ln(\\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{V}})) - \\ln(\\Pr(s_i \\mid H_{\\mathrm{S}})) = \\frac{(\\ln s_i - \\mu_{i,H_{\\mathrm{S}}})^2}{2\\sigma_i^2} - \\frac{(\\ln s_i - \\mu_{i,H_{\\mathrm{V}}})^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\n$$\nThe log-posterior-odds $\\Lambda$ is computed by summing these terms over all three receptors and adding the log-prior odds:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{V}})}{\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{S}})}\\right) + \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{TLR4}, \\mathrm{RIGI}, \\mathrm{cGAS}\\}} \\text{LLR}_i\n$$\nFinally, the posterior probability $\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{V}} \\mid \\mathbf{s})$ is recovered from the log-posterior-odds using the logistic (sigmoid) function:\n$$\n\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{V}} \\mid \\mathbf{s}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\Lambda)}\n$$\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Calculate the log-prior odds: $\\ln(\\frac{0.35}{0.65})$.\n$2$. For each test case $(s_{\\mathrm{TLR4}}, s_{\\mathrm{RIGI}}, s_{\\mathrm{cGAS}})$:\n    a. Initialize a total log-likelihood ratio to $0$.\n    b. For each receptor $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{TLR4}, \\mathrm{RIGI}, \\mathrm{cGAS}\\}$, calculate its contribution to the LLR using the corresponding measurement $s_i$ and the provided parameters $(\\mu_{i,H_{\\mathrm{V}}}, \\mu_{i,H_{\\mathrm{S}}}, \\sigma_{i})$. This is achieved by computing the log-likelihood of the observation under each hypothesis, $H_{\\mathrm{V}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{S}}$, and taking their difference.\n    c. Sum the individual LLRs.\n    d. Add the log-prior odds to obtain the log-posterior-odds $\\Lambda$.\n    e. Calculate the posterior probability $\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{V}} \\mid \\mathbf{s})$ using the logistic function.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for the given test cases. We will use the provided parameter values:\n- Priors: $\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{V}}) = 0.35$, $\\Pr(H_{\\mathrm{S}}) = 0.65$.\n- TLR4: $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{V}}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\sigma) = (\\ln(1.4), \\ln(3.0), 0.4)$.\n- RIG-I: $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{V}}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\sigma) = (\\ln(5.0), \\ln(1.2), 0.35)$.\n- cGAS: $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{V}}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\sigma) = (\\ln(3.0), \\ln(1.8), 0.5)$.\n\nThe implementation will utilize numerical libraries to ensure accurate computation of logarithmic and exponential functions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import lognorm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the posterior probability of viral infection for five test cases using a Bayesian classifier.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the five test cases as triples of receptor fold-changes.\n    # Format: (s_TLR4, s_RIGI, s_cGAS)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.2, 6.0, 3.2),\n        (3.8, 1.1, 1.9),\n        (3.0, 4.5, 2.5),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (1.0, 10.0, 6.0),\n    ]\n\n    # Define the parameters for the log-normal distributions for each receptor.\n    # H_V: Viral infection hypothesis\n    # H_S: Sterile injury hypothesis\n    params = {\n        'TLR4': {'mu_V': np.log(1.4), 'mu_S': np.log(3.0), 'sigma': 0.4},\n        'RIGI': {'mu_V': np.log(5.0), 'mu_S': np.log(1.2), 'sigma': 0.35},\n        'cGAS': {'mu_V': np.log(3.0), 'mu_S': np.log(1.8), 'sigma': 0.5},\n    }\n\n    # Define the prior probabilities for the hypotheses.\n    prior_V = 0.35\n    prior_S = 1.0 - prior_V\n\n    # Calculate the log-prior odds, ln(P(H_V) / P(H_S)).\n    log_prior_odds = np.log(prior_V / prior_S)\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each test case to compute the posterior probability.\n    for case in test_cases:\n        s_tlr4, s_rigi, s_cgas = case\n        s_values = {'TLR4': s_tlr4, 'RIGI': s_rigi, 'cGAS': s_cgas}\n        \n        # Initialize the total log-likelihood ratio (LLR).\n        total_llr = 0.0\n        \n        # Calculate the LLR by summing the contributions from each receptor.\n        for receptor, p in params.items():\n            s_val = s_values[receptor]\n            \n            # The scale parameter for scipy's lognorm is exp(mu).\n            # The shape parameter 's' is our sigma.\n            \n            # Log-likelihood of the observation given viral infection (H_V).\n            log_lik_V = lognorm.logpdf(s_val, s=p['sigma'], scale=np.exp(p['mu_V']))\n            \n            # Log-likelihood of the observation given sterile injury (H_S).\n            log_lik_S = lognorm.logpdf(s_val, s=p['sigma'], scale=np.exp(p['mu_S']))\n            \n            # Add the individual LLR for this receptor to the total.\n            total_llr += log_lik_V - log_lik_S\n            \n        # The log-posterior odds is the sum of the log-prior odds and the total LLR.\n        log_posterior_odds = log_prior_odds + total_llr\n        \n        # Convert the log-posterior odds to a posterior probability using the logistic function.\n        # P(H_V | s) = 1 / (1 + exp(-log_posterior_odds))\n        posterior_V = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-log_posterior_odds))\n        \n        # Store the result formatted to six decimal places.\n        results.append(f\"{posterior_V:.6f}\")\n\n    # Print the final output in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2879739"}]}
