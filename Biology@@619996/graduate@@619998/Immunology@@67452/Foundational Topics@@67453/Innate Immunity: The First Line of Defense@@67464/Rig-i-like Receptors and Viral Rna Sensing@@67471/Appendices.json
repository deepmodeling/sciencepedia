This detection triggers a signaling cascade that culminates in the production of type I interferons, a key antiviral defense. A simplified model of this activation process proposes that the total signaling strength, $S$, in an infected cell is the sum of the individual contributions from the two major RLRs: Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). The activation strength of each pathway is directly proportional to the concentration of its specific RNA ligand multiplied by a characteristic activation constant.\n\nThe specificities and activation constants for the receptors are as follows:\n- RIG-I preferentially binds to short, `$5^{\\prime}$-triphosphorylated` RNA strands.

The mutation neutralizes the protein's positive charge, so this favorable interaction is lost. The change in the free energy of binding, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, is therefore positive (destabilizing):\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = -E_{\\mathrm{coul}} \\approx +0.95\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nFor simplicity in discussion, we can state this energy loss is roughly $+1\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we relate this change in free energy to the change in the dissociation constant, $K_d$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_d^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{K_d^{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant ($1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$) and $T$ is the absolute temperature ($298\\ \\mathrm{K}$).\nThe value of $RT$ at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$RT = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.592\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nWe can now calculate the fold-change in $K_d$:\n$$\\frac{K_d^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{K_d^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.9507\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{0.592\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}\\right) \\approx \\exp(1.606) \\approx 4.98$$\nThis indicates that the binding affinity becomes weaker by a factor of approximately $5$.\n\nUsing the wild-type dissociation constant, $K_d^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, we can calculate the mutant dissociation constant:\n$$K_d^{\\mathrm{mutant}} = K_d^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\times 4.98 = (5\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\times 4.98 \\approx 24.9\\ \\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe new $K_d$ is approximately $25\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFinally, the problem states that the half-maximal effective concentration, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, scales with the loss in binding affinity. Therefore, a $\\sim 5$-fold increase in $K_d$ will result in a $\\sim 5$-fold increase (rightward shift) in the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, indicating reduced signaling potency.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. $K_d$ increases from $5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ to approximately $25$–$35\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ (about $5$–$7$-fold weaker), with a commensurate $\\sim 5$–$7$-fold rightward shift in $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, consistent with loss of roughly $1\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ of favorable electrostatic interaction at physiological ionic strength.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our calculations.

The predicted shift in $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is also consistent. **Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $K_d$ decreases to approximately $1\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ (stronger binding), and signaling potency increases roughly $5$-fold, because removing a positive charge reduces electrostatic repulsion with the $5^{\\prime}\\mathrm{ppp}$ group.**\n    This is fundamentally incorrect. The interaction between a basic residue ($+1$) and a phosphate group (negative) is attractive. Removing the positive charge eliminates a favorable attraction, weakening binding and increasing $K_d$. The reasoning is flawed. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $K_d$ remains approximately $5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and signaling potency is unchanged, because electrostatic contributions are fully screened at $I = 0.15\\ \\mathrm{M}$ and thus negligible.**\n    This is incorrect. While salt screens electrostatic interactions, it does not eliminate them, especially at short distances. Our calculation shows that even with screening, the energy contribution is significant ($\\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$), leading to a measurable change in affinity. The Debye length ($\\kappa^{-1} \\approx 8\\ \\text{\\AA}$) is larger than the interaction distance ($r \\approx 3\\ \\text{\\AA}$), indicating that screening is substantial but incomplete. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. $K_d$ increases by more than $10^3$-fold into the micromolar range and signaling is abolished, because neutralizing one basic residue removes all specific recognition of the $5^{\\prime}\\mathrm{ppp}$ group.**\n    This is a gross overestimation. A $1000$-fold increase in $K_d$ would require an energy penalty of $\\Delta\\Delta G = RT \\ln(1000) \\approx 0.592 \\times 6.91 \\approx 4.1\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. This is much larger than the calculated loss of $\\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. It is also biophysically unlikely that a single point mutation would \"remove all specific recognition\" in a high-affinity interaction that likely involves multiple contacts. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. $K_d$ increases modestly from $5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ to approximately $10\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ (about $2$-fold), with a roughly $2$-fold rightward shift in $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, because the energy penalty for losing one charge at $I = 0.15\\ \\mathrm{M}$ is less than $0.5\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.**\n    This is an underestimation. Our calculation yielded an energy penalty of $\\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.
