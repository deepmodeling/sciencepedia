{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The activation of Nod-like receptors like NLRP3 is a tightly controlled process resembling the action of a molecular switch. The central NACHT domain, a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This exercise challenges you to think mechanistically by analyzing a hypothetical mutation that locks NLRP3 in its ATP-bound state, providing insight into how the energy cycle of the NACHT domain governs inflammasome activation and how its disruption can lead to spontaneous inflammation. [@problem_id:2255127]", "problem": "A researcher is studying the activation of the inflammasome in a line of macrophages. The inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that plays a critical role in innate immunity by sensing danger signals and initiating inflammation. A key component is the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) protein. Canonical activation of NLRP3 requires two signals. Signal 1 (priming), often provided by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), upregulates the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-Interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β). Signal 2 (activation), such as extracellular Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), triggers the oligomerization of NLRP3. This oligomerization is dependent on ATP binding to NLRP3's central NACHT domain, which then facilitates the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1, leading to caspase-1 auto-activation. Active caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-1β into its mature, secretable form and also induces a pro-inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis.\n\nThe researcher introduces a specific point mutation into the *Nlrp3* gene. This mutation alters the NACHT domain such that it binds ATP with extremely high affinity but is completely incapable of hydrolyzing it. The protein is thus \"locked\" in an ATP-bound conformation.\n\nAssuming the macrophages carrying this mutation are first primed with LPS (Signal 1), what would be the most likely functional consequence of this mutation when compared to wild-type macrophages that are also primed but do not receive a canonical Signal 2?\n\nA. The mutant macrophages will be unable to assemble the inflammasome, even if a strong Signal 2 is provided, resulting in no IL-1β secretion or pyroptosis.\n\nB. The mutant macrophages will show spontaneous and continuous inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis, even in the complete absence of LPS priming.\n\nC. The mutant macrophages will undergo spontaneous inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis without the need for a canonical Signal 2.\n\nD. The mutant macrophages will assemble the inflammasome but will only secrete IL-1β, without undergoing pyroptosis, because ATP hydrolysis is specifically required for pyroptotic signaling.\n\nE. The mutant macrophages will show normal basal activity but will have an enhanced response, with much faster and stronger IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis, only upon receiving a canonical Signal 2.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the requirements for canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Canonical activation requires two signals:\n- Signal 1 (priming, e.g., LPS) induces transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1beta, ensuring sufficient availability of the sensor and the cytokine precursor substrate.\n- Signal 2 (activation, e.g., extracellular ATP) induces NLRP3 oligomerization. Mechanistically, ATP binding to the NACHT domain promotes a conformational state competent for oligomerization and recruitment of ASC and pro-caspase-1, which enables caspase-1 auto-activation. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1beta to mature IL-1beta and cleaves gasdermin D, driving pyroptosis.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the mutation on NLRP3 regulation. The mutation enforces very high-affinity ATP binding and abolishes ATP hydrolysis, thereby locking NLRP3 in an ATP-bound conformation. For NACHT/AAA+ family ATPases, ATP binding promotes the active/assembly-competent state, whereas hydrolysis typically enables conformational cycling and termination/reset of activity rather than the initial activation step.\n\nStep 3: Predict the functional outcome in LPS-primed cells without a canonical Signal 2. Because ATP binding (not hydrolysis) is the key trigger for NLRP3 oligomerization, an NLRP3 that is constitutively ATP-bound will be predisposed to oligomerize and recruit ASC and pro-caspase-1 even in the absence of an external activation signal. Given that LPS priming has already provided ample NLRP3 and pro-IL-1beta, spontaneous inflammasome assembly will yield caspase-1 activation, IL-1beta maturation and secretion, and gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis without requiring a canonical Signal 2.\n\nStep 4: Exclude alternative options based on mechanism.\n- Option A is unlikely: inability to hydrolyze ATP does not prevent ATP-bound oligomerization; rather, it prevents cycling off. Thus assembly should occur, not be blocked, and provision of Signal 2 would not be necessary for activation.\n- Option B overstates independence from priming: without priming, pro-IL-1beta levels are low, so robust IL-1beta secretion is limited. The question also explicitly sets the primed condition, making B less appropriate than C.\n- Option D is inconsistent: caspase-1 activation drives both IL-1beta processing and pyroptosis via gasdermin D; there is no specific requirement for ATP hydrolysis solely for pyroptosis once the inflammasome assembles.\n- Option E is inconsistent: the mutant should already be active without Signal 2, not merely show an enhanced response only upon Signal 2.\n\nTherefore, in LPS-primed mutant macrophages, spontaneous inflammasome assembly and downstream outputs occur without a canonical Signal 2, best matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2255127"}, {"introduction": "After exploring the mechanisms of inflammasome activation, the next logical step in research is to quantitatively measure its functional output, most notably the secretion of the potent cytokine Interleukin-1β ($IL-1\\beta$).
