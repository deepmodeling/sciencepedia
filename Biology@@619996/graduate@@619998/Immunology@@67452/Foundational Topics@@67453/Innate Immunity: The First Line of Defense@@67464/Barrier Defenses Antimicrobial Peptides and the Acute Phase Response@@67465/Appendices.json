The problem is objective and uses precise scientific language. No flaws, such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity, are detected.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the surface potential, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)$, from the surface charge density $\\sigma$. We start with the one-dimensional linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ in the aqueous region $x>0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\kappa^2 \\psi(x)\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A\\exp(-\\kappa x) + B\\exp(\\kappa x)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. We apply the boundary condition that the potential must vanish far from the surface, i.e., $\\psi(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. This condition requires that the coefficient of the exponentially growing term, $B$, must be zero. Thus, the solution becomes:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A\\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is the potential at the surface, $x=0$, which we denote as $\\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)\\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nNext, we invoke Gauss's law at the interface $x=0$. The electric field $E(x)$ in the aqueous phase is the negative gradient of the potential:\n$$\nE(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)\\exp(-\\kappa x) \\right] = \\kappa \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)\\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nThe electric field at the interface from the aqueous side ($x=0^{+}$) is:\n$$\nE(0^{+}) = \\kappa \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)\n$$\nGauss's law states that the discontinuity in the electric displacement field across the interface equals the free surface charge density, $\\sigma$. Assuming the electric field inside the membrane ($x<0$) is zero, this relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon E(0^{+}) = \\sigma\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the aqueous medium. Substituting the expression for $E(0^{+})$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0) = \\sigma\n$$\nSolving for the surface potential $\\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0)$ yields the desired relation, which is the Grahame equation in the Debye-Hückel approximation:\n$$\n\\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}(0) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa}\n$$\nNow, we proceed to calculate the quantity of interest, $\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^{(\\mathrm{B})}-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^{(\\mathrm{H})}$. The molar electrostatic binding free energy is given by $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}} = z\\,F\\,\\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.

Therefore, the difference in effective potentials is:\n$$\n\\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\mathrm{H})} = \\left( \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}^{(\\mathrm{B})}(0) + f\\,\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{B}} \\right) - \\left( \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}^{(\\mathrm{H})}(0) + f\\,\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{H}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\mathrm{H})} = \\left( \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}^{(\\mathrm{B})}(0) - \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}^{(\\mathrm{H})}(0) \\right) + f \\left( \\psi_{d,\\mathrm{B}} - \\psi_{d,\\mathrm{H}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the derived expression for the surface potential:\n$$\n\\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}^{(\\mathrm{B})}(0) - \\psi_{\\mathrm{surf}}^{(\\mathrm{H})}(0) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa} - \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G$, we obtain the final analytical formula for the calculation:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = z\\,F \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa} + f(\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{B}} - \\psi_{d,\\mathrm{H}}) \\right]\n$$\nThe attenuation factor $f$ is calculated from the given parameters $d=0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda=0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\nf = \\exp(-d/\\lambda) = \\exp(-0.5/0.5) = \\exp(-1)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values, ensuring all are in SI units.\n-   $z = 6$\n-   $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n-   $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}} = -0.020\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$\n-   $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}} = -0.004\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$\n-   $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}} = -0.020 - (-0.004) = -0.016\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$\n-   $\\varepsilon_r = 78.5$\n-   $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,V^{-1}\\,m^{-1}}$\n-   $\\kappa = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}} = 1.25 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$\n-   $\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{B}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{H}} = 0.27\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{B}} - \\psi_{d,\\mathrm{H}} = 0.20 - 0.27 = -0.07\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator for the surface potential term:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa = (78.5)(8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,V^{-1}\\,m^{-1}})(1.25 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}) \\approx 0.8689\\,\\mathrm{C\\,V^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nNow, calculate the two potential difference terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\kappa} = \\frac{-0.016\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}}{0.8689\\,\\mathrm{C\\,V^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}} \\approx -0.018414\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\nf(\\psi_{d,\\mathrm{B}} - \\psi_{d,\\mathrm{H}}) = \\exp(-1) \\times (-0.07\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx (0.367879) \\times (-0.07\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx -0.025752\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe total difference in effective potential is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\mathrm{B})} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\mathrm{H})} \\approx -0.018414\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.025752\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx -0.044166\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = z\\,F\\,\\Delta\\psi_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx (6)(96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})(-0.044166\\,\\mathrm{V})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx -25566\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, so we convert the units:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx -25.566\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $-25.6\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.

This is a very substantial loss of binding affinity, which, according to the problem, leads to a substantial loss of activity.\n\nFor AMP-Y ($z_Y = +3$, amphipathic): Its total binding energy is the sum of electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions: $U_Y(I) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nThe problem states that the hydrophobic contribution is salt-insensitive, with $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx -6 \\, k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\nAt physiological salt, $U_Y(I_{\\mathrm{phys}}) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}}) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nAt high salt, $U_Y(I_{\\mathrm{high}}) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I_{\\mathrm{high}}) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx 0.26 \\, U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}}) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nThe hydrophobic term $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ is a large, favorable, and constant contribution to binding. It acts as an \"anchor\" that is not affected by salt. While the electrostatic part of its binding is reduced by the same fraction as for AMP-X, this only affects one component of its total binding energy. The presence of the significant, salt-insensitive hydrophobic energy $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ means that AMP-Y will retain a much larger fraction of its total binding affinity compared to AMP-X. Therefore, AMP-Y is predicted to retain substantial activity at high salt.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement.\n\nA. When $I$ increases from $0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}$ to $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$, the electrostatic attraction at $d=0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ scales down by a factor of approximately $0.26$ independent of $z$; therefore AMP-X (purely electrostatic, $z=+8$) loses most activity, whereas AMP-Y ($z=+3$ plus $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}\\approx -6\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$) retains substantial activity.\nThis statement is consistent with our calculation, which yielded a scaling factor of $\\approx 0.26$. Our derivation also showed this factor is independent of $z$. The conclusion about the differential activity loss of AMP-X and AMP-Y is also correct based on our physical analysis. AMP-X's purely electrostatic binding is severely weakened, while AMP-Y's binding is buffered by its salt-insensitive hydrophobic component. **Correct**.\n\nB. Increasing $I$ increases $\\kappa^{-1}$, so screening decreases and both AMPs should become more active at $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$ than at $0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThis statement contains a fundamental error. According to the formula $\\kappa^{-1} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{I}$, increasing the ionic strength $I$ *decreases*, not increases, the Debye length $\\kappa^{-1}$. A smaller Debye length signifies *stronger* electrostatic screening, which weakens electrostatic interactions. Consequently, activity based on electrostatic attraction should decrease, not increase. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Hydrophobic insertion energies are screened by salt similarly to electrostatic attraction; therefore AMP-Y will lose at least as much activity as AMP-X when $I$ rises to $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThis statement directly contradicts a premise given in the problem: \"...hydrophobic insertion free energy $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$\" is \"salt-insensitive\". The conclusion is based on this false premise and is therefore invalid in the context of the problem. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The fractional drop in electrostatic attraction is larger for higher valence ligands; therefore AMP-X will lose a larger fraction of its electrostatic component than AMP-Y when $I$ increases, even if both approach at the same $d$.\nOur derivation of the scaling factor $S$ explicitly showed that it is independent of the peptide valence $z$. The fractional drop is $1-S$, which is therefore also independent of $z$. While the absolute magnitude of the energy loss, $|\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{elec}}| = |(S-1)U_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}})|$, is indeed proportional to $z$ and thus larger for AMP-X, the statement incorrectly refers to the *fractional* drop. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Acute phase responses raise plasma protein concentrations sufficiently to increase $I$ from $0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}$ to approximately $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$; hence both AMPs will be equivalently inactivated in inflamed serum, irrespective of hydrophobicity.\nThis statement makes two flawed assertions. First, the physiological claim about a four-fold increase in ionic strength during an acute phase response is highly dubious. Second, and more importantly within the problem's physical model, the conclusion that both AMPs are \"equivalently inactivated ... irrespective of hydrophobicity\" is false. Our analysis has shown that the salt-insensitive hydrophobic component of AMP-Y is precisely the reason it is *not* inactivated to the same degree as the purely electrostatic AMP-X. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2835935"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the molecular interactions of individual peptides, we now zoom out to model the dynamics of the broader systemic response that regulates them.

Suppose that, starting at $t=0$, the net CRP synthesis rate is increased to a constant value $k_s$ for a finite induction interval of duration $\\tau$, after which the synthesis rate returns to $0$. Let the first-order clearance rate constant be $k_d$. Assume $k_s>0$, $k_d>0$, $\\tau \\geq 0$, and $C(0)=0$.\n\nUsing mass balance and first-order kinetics as the fundamental base, model the dynamics with a piecewise constant input for synthesis and derive, from first principles, the exact expressions for the peak plasma concentration of CRP and the exact time from induction onset at which this peak occurs, in terms of $k_s$, $k_d$, and $\\tau$.\n\nExpress your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression containing the peak concentration followed by the time-to-peak, formatted as a row matrix. Do not include units. No numerical rounding is required; provide the expressions symbolically in terms of $k_s$, $k_d$, and $\\tau$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- System: C-reactive protein (CRP) dynamics in plasma.\n- Variable: $C(t)$ is the plasma concentration of CRP at time $t \\geq 0$.\n- Compartment Model: Plasma is a well-mixed compartment of effectively constant volume.\n- Clearance Kinetics: First-order process with rate constant $k_d > 0$.\n- Synthesis Kinetics: Net synthesis rate is a piecewise function.

This is a standard and scientifically valid approach for modeling substance dynamics in biological systems.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

All necessary parameters ($k_s, k_d, \\tau$) and the initial condition ($C(0)=0$) required to formulate and solve the mathematical model are provided. There are no ambiguities or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a straightforward exercise in modeling and solving a linear ordinary differential equation. We will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the concentration of CRP, $C(t)$, in a well-mixed compartment is the mass balance equation. The rate of change of concentration is the difference between the rate of synthesis and the rate of clearance.\nLet $R_{in}(t)$ be the rate of concentration increase due to synthesis and $R_{out}(t)$ be the rate of concentration decrease due to clearance. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{in}(t) - R_{out}(t)\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, clearance is a first-order process, so $R_{out}(t) = k_d C(t)$. The synthesis rate is given as a piecewise constant function of time:\n$$\nR_{in}(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \nk_s & \\text{if } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } t > \\tau \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis leads to a piecewise differential equation for the system.\n\n**Phase 1: Synthesis and Clearance ($0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$)**\nFor the time interval when synthesis is active, the differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_s - k_d C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it to the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + k_d C(t) = k_s\n$$\nWe solve this using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_d dt\\right) = \\exp(k_d t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\exp(k_d t) \\frac{dC}{dt} + k_d \\exp(k_d t) C(t) = k_s \\exp(k_d t)\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( C(t) \\exp(k_d t) \\right) = k_s \\exp(k_d t)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\nC(t) \\exp(k_d t) = \\int k_s \\exp(k_d t) dt = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} \\exp(k_d t) + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} + A \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nWe apply the initial condition $C(0) = 0$:\n$$\nC(0) = 0 = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} + A \\exp(0) \\implies A = -\\frac{k_s}{k_d}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the solution, we obtain the expression for CRP concentration during the synthesis phase, which we denote $C_1(t)$:\n$$\nC_1(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d t)) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau\n$$\n\n**Phase 2: Clearance Only ($t > \\tau$)**\nFor the time interval after synthesis has ceased, the differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k_d C(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable equation, and its solution is a standard exponential decay:\n$$\nC(t) = B \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nwhere $B$ is a constant. We determine $B$ by enforcing the condition of continuity of concentration at time $t = \\tau$. The concentration at the end of Phase 1 must equal the concentration at the start of Phase 2. Let $C_2(t)$ be the concentration in this phase.\n$$\nC_2(\\tau) = C_1(\\tau)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate $C_1(\\tau)$:\n$$\nC_1(\\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))\n$$\nNow we set $C_2(\\tau)$ equal to this value:\n$$\nB \\exp(-k_d \\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau)) \\exp(k_d \\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1)\n$$\nThus, the solution for $t > \\tau$ is:\n$$\nC_2(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) \\exp(-k_d t) \\quad \\text{for } t > \\tau\n$$\n\n**Finding the Peak Concentration and Time-to-Peak**\nTo find the maximum concentration, we analyze the derivative of $C(t)$ in each interval.\n- For $0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_1}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d t)) \\right) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (k_d \\exp(-k_d t)) = k_s \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nSince $k_s > 0$ and $\\exp(-k_d t) > 0$ for all $t$, we have $\\frac{dC_1}{dt} > 0$. This demonstrates that the concentration $C(t)$ is strictly increasing throughout the interval $[0, \\tau]$.\n\n- For $t > \\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_2}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) \\exp(-k_d t) \\right) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) (-k_d \\exp(-k_d t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_2}{dt} = -k_s (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nGiven the constraints $\\tau \\geq 0$ and $k_d > 0$, the term $\\exp(k_d \\tau)$ is always greater than or equal to $1$. If $\\tau > 0$, then $\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1 > 0$. Since $k_s > 0$ and the exponential term is positive, $\\frac{dC_2}{dt} < 0$. This indicates that the concentration $C(t)$ is strictly decreasing for all $t > \\tau$. If $\\tau = 0$, the entire process is trivial, $C(t)=0$ for all $t$.\n\nThe function $C(t)$ increases until $t=\\tau$ and then decreases for $t>\\tau$. The maximum value must therefore occur at the point where the behavior changes, which is $t = \\tau$.\nThe time at which the peak concentration occurs is:\n$$\nt_{peak} = \\tau\n$$\nThe peak concentration, $C_{peak}$, is the value of the concentration at this time, $C(\\tau)$. We use the expression for $C_1(t)$ to find this value:\n$$\nC_{peak} = C_1(\\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))\n$$\nThese results are the exact analytic expressions required.\n\nFinal Expressions:\n- Peak Concentration: $C_{peak} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))$\n- Time-to-Peak: $t_{peak} = \\tau$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau)) & \\tau \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2835936"}]}
