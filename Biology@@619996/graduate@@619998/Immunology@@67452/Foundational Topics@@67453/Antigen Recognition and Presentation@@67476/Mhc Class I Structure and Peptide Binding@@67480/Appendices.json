The description of a $9$-mer peptide with anchor residues at P$2$ and P$9$ binding to an MHC class I molecule, with pockets B and F accommodating these anchors, is a classic and accurate model in structural immunology. The thermodynamic relationship between the Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant is a cornerstone of physical chemistry.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($K_d$ values, temperature, standard state) to compare the thermodynamics of the two peptide-MHC interactions. The question is precise and asks for a specific set of analyses.\n3.  **Consistency**: The data are internally consistent. The peptide $P_1$ with hydrophobic anchors, which are stated to be preferred by the MHC pockets, exhibits a much lower dissociation constant ($K_{d,1} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$) than the peptide $P_2$ with mismatched polar residues ($K_{d,2} = 5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$).

The assumptions (ideal dilute solution, standard state) are explicitly stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. It provides a valid basis for a rigorous analysis. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamic Relationship**\nThe problem specifies the dissociation reaction: $\\mathrm{PM} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{P} + \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the dissociation constant, $K_d$. In terms of activities, $K_d = \\frac{a_\\mathrm{P} a_\\mathrm{M}}{a_\\mathrm{PM}}$. With the given standard state of $c^\\circ = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$ and the approximation that activity coefficients are unity, the thermodynamic (dimensionless) equilibrium constant is numerically equal to the value calculated from molar concentrations, i.e., $K_d = \\frac{[\\mathrm{P}][\\mathrm{M}]}{[\\mathrm{PM}]}$ where concentrations are in $\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^\\circ$) and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant ($K_{eq}$) for any reaction is:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -R T \\ln K_{eq} $$\nFor the dissociation reaction, $K_{eq} = K_d$. Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for dissociation is:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}} = -R T \\ln K_d $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal molar gas constant (approximately $8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$) and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**Part 2: Comparison of Standard Free Energies**\nWe are given $K_{d,1} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}$ and $K_{d,2} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nClearly, $K_{d,1} < K_{d,2}$.\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$. Thus, $K_{d,1} < K_{d,2}$ implies $\\ln K_{d,1} < \\ln K_{d,2}$.\nThe term $-R T$ is negative since $R > 0$ and $T > 0$. Multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality.\nTherefore,\n$$ -R T \\ln K_{d,1} > -R T \\ln K_{d,2} $$\nwhich means\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}}(P_1) > \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}}(P_2) $$\nThis result is logical: a stronger binding interaction ($P_1$, smaller $K_d$) corresponds to a less spontaneous dissociation reaction (a more positive, or less negative, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}}$).\n\n**Part 3: Structural Rationale**\nThe binding of a peptide to the MHC class I groove is driven by a combination of factors. A crucial component is the interaction of peptide anchor residues with specific pockets in the groove. For $P_1$, the hydrophobic anchor residues at positions $2$ and $9$ fit well into the complementary hydrophobic B and F pockets. This leads to favorable van der Waals interactions (an enthalpic contribution, $\\Delta H < 0$) and, most importantly, the hydrophobic effect. The hydrophobic effect is the entropically driven process where ordered water molecules are released from the nonpolar surfaces of both the peptide side chains and the MHC pockets into the bulk solvent, leading to a large increase in the total entropy of the system ($\\Delta S_{solvent} \\gg 0$).\nFor $P_2$, the polar residues at the anchor positions are a mismatch for the hydrophobic pockets. This results in a loss of the favorable interactions seen with $P_1$. Forcing a polar group into a nonpolar environment is energetically costly. Consequently, the binding of $P_2$ is much weaker, as reflected by its substantially larger $K_d$.\nThe overall binding free energy, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = \\Delta H^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}} - T \\Delta S^\\circ_{\\mathrm{total}}$, becomes more negative (more favorable) when interactions are complementary, as with $P_1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Statement:** For $\\mathrm{PM} \\to \\mathrm{P} + \\mathrm{M}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}} = - R T \\ln K_d$, where $R$ is the universal molar gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature in Kelvin, and $K_d$ is the thermodynamic equilibrium dissociation constant defined with a $1\\ \\mathrm{M}$ standard state.\n- **Analysis:** This equation is the correct thermodynamic relationship for the specified dissociation reaction. The definitions of the variables are correct.\n- **Ordering:** \"because $K_{d,1} < K_{d,2}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}}(P_1) > \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{diss}}(P_2)$\". This inequality is mathematically correct as derived above.\n- **Rationale:** \"...stronger enthalpic stabilization of $P_1$ via optimal anchoring...which lowers $K_d$\". The optimal anchoring of hydrophobic residues in hydrophobic pockets creates favorable van der Waals contacts, which contribute to a more negative enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}}$), i.e., enthalpic stabilization. This, along with the large favorable solvent entropy change (hydrophobic effect), leads to stronger binding and a lower $K_d$. The rationale correctly identifies the structural basis (optimal anchoring) and links it to a thermodynamic term (enthalpic stabilization) and the observed outcome (lower $K_d$). The mention of entropic costs (conformational restriction, some ordered interfacial water) is also a valid part of a complete thermodynamic picture.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Statement:** For $\\mathrm{P} + \\mathrm{M} \\to \\mathrm{PM}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = - R T \\ln K_d$.\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect. For the association reaction, the equilibrium constant is $K_a = 1/K_d$. The correct relation is $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = -R T \\ln K_a = R T \\ln K_d$. The stated equation is wrong by a sign.\n- **Definitions:** \"$R$ can be replaced by the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ without conversion, $T$ may be taken in degrees Celsius\". This is fundamentally incorrect. $R$ is a molar constant ($\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$) while $k_B$ is a molecular constant ($\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$); they are related by Avogadro's number ($R = N_A k_B$) and are not interchangeable. Thermodynamic equations require absolute temperature (Kelvin), not Celsius.\n- **Ordering and Rationale:** The derived inequality and the rationale about water displacement are also incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option contains multiple, severe errors in fundamental principles of thermodynamics.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Statement:** For $\\mathrm{P} + \\mathrm{M} \\to \\mathrm{PM}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = R T \\ln K_d$.\n- **Analysis:** This statement refers to the association reaction. The question explicitly gives the stoichiometry for the dissociation reaction ($\\mathrm{PM} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{P} + \\mathrm{M}$) and asks for the relationship for \"the dissociation reaction\". While the equation $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = R T \\ln K_d$ is correct in itself, and the subsequent inequality $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}}(P_1) < \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{assoc}}(P_2)$ is also correct, this option does not address the reaction specified in the prompt.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It fails to answer the question as posed, which specifically concerns the dissociation reaction.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Statement:** \"...$K_d$ should be taken as a simple ratio of molar concentrations regardless of standard state...\".\n- **Analysis:** This is a fundamental error. The argument of a logarithm must be a dimensionless quantity. The use of a standard state, $c^\\circ = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$, correctly renders the equilibrium constant dimensionless. To ignore the standard state is incorrect.\n- **Rationale:** \"...the dominant contribution to binding is entropic, so the more constrained $P_1$ must have a larger $K_d$ than $P_2$\". This reasoning is flawed. It considers only the unfavorable conformational entropy cost of binding the peptide, while ignoring the large, favorable contributions from enthalpy (van der Waals forces) and solvent entropy (hydrophobic effect). This incorrect reasoning leads to the conclusion that $P_1$ binds weaker (larger $K_d$), which directly contradicts the data provided in the problem statement ($K_{d,1} < K_{d,2}$).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It contains a severe conceptual error about standard states and employs fallacious physical reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2869085"}, {"introduction": "Predicting which of the myriad peptides generated within a cell will bind to a specific MHC allele is a central challenge in immunology and vaccinology.

There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a straightforward application of the principle of additivity in a log-odds scoring model, a core concept in the analysis of biomolecular interactions. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe biological function of Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules is to bind short peptides, typically $8$ to $11$ amino acids in length, derived from intracellular proteins and present them on the cell surface for surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The peptide-binding groove of an MHC-I molecule is a cleft formed by the $\\alpha 1$ and $\\alpha 2$ domains of its heavy chain. This groove contains several subsites or \"pockets\", denoted $A$ through $F$, which interact with the side chains (R-groups) of the peptide's amino acid residues.\n\nThe specificity of peptide binding to a particular MHC-I allele is largely determined by the physicochemical properties of these pockets. For many alleles, including HLA-A*02:01, the pockets at either end of the groove anchor the peptide, with the $B$ pocket accommodating the side chain of the residue at position $2$ ($P_2$) being a primary anchor. The compatibility between the side chain at $P_2$ and the $B$ pocket is a critical determinant of binding affinity.\n\nPosition-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are a common tool in bioinformatics used to model these binding preferences. A PSSM for peptide-MHC binding is a matrix of scores, where each element $M(P_i=\\text{aa}_j)$ represents the contribution of amino acid $\\text{aa}_j$ at position $P_i$ to the overall binding propensity. These scores are typically log-odds scores, defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the frequency of an amino acid at a given position in a set of known binders to its frequency in a background set (e.g., non-binders or the proteome).\n\nThe problem states that the total binding log-odds score, $S$, is calculated as the sum of independent contributions from each peptide position, plus a constant baseline term $C$. For a nonamer peptide with sequence $P_1P_2...P_9$, the score $S$ is given by the additive formula:\n$$ S = C + \\sum_{i=1}^{9} M(P_i) $$\nwhere $M(P_i)$ is the PSSM score for the amino acid at position $i$.\n\nWe are asked to calculate the change in this score, $\\Delta S$, when the residue at position $P_2$ is substituted. Let the initial peptide have alanine (Ala) at $P_2$ and the final peptide have leucine (Leu) at $P_2$. All other residues ($P_1$, $P_3$, ..., $P_9$) remain unchanged.\n\nThe initial score, $S_{\\text{initial}}$, for the peptide with Ala at $P_2$ is:\n$$ S_{\\text{initial}} = C + M(P_1) + M(P_2=\\text{Ala}) + \\sum_{i=3}^{9} M(P_i) $$\nThe final score, $S_{\\text{final}}$, for the peptide with Leu at $P_2$ is:\n$$ S_{\\text{final}} = C + M(P_1) + M(P_2=\\text{Leu}) + \\sum_{i=3}^{9} M(P_i) $$\nThe change in score, $\\Delta S$, is the difference between the final and initial scores:\n$$ \\Delta S = S_{\\text{final}} - S_{\\text{initial}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the scores:\n$$ \\Delta S = \\left( C + M(P_1) + M(P_2=\\text{Leu}) + \\sum_{i=3}^{9} M(P_i) \\right) - \\left( C + M(P_1) + M(P_2=\\text{Ala}) + \\sum_{i=3}^{9} M(P_i) \\right) $$\nDue to the additivity assumption, the baseline constant $C$ and the score contributions from all unchanged positions ($P_1$, $P_3$ through $P_9$) cancel out. The change in the total score is thus solely determined by the change in the score at the position of substitution, $P_2$:\n$$ \\Delta S = M(P_2=\\text{Leu}) - M(P_2=\\text{Ala}) $$\nWe are given the PSSM values from the problem statement:\n- $M(P_2=\\text{Ala}) = -0.742$\n- $M(P_2=\\text{Leu}) = 1.178$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta S$:\n$$ \\Delta S = 1.178 - (-0.742) $$\n$$ \\Delta S = 1.178 + 0.742 $$\n$$ \\Delta S = 1.920 $$\nThe units are in nats, as specified. The result $1.920$ has four significant figures. The positive value of $\\Delta S$ indicates that the substitution from alanine to leucine at $P_2$ increases the predicted binding score, suggesting a more favorable interaction with the $B$ pocket of HLA-A*02:01.

We may proceed with the solution derivation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between thermodynamics (Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$) and kinetics (association rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}$, and dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$).\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the ratio of the kinetic rate constants:\n$$K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of binding is related to the equilibrium dissociation constant by the equation:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln K_D$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $K_D$ into the free energy equation gives:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} \\right)$$\nThe change in Gibbs free energy upon mutation, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$, is the difference between the mutant and wild-type binding energies:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$$\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{k_{\\text{on}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}} \\right) - RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{k_{\\text{on}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} \\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln \\left[ \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}} / k_{\\text{on}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} / k_{\\text{on}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} \\right]$$\nThe problem states as a key assumption that $k_{\\text{on}}$ is not significantly altered, thus $k_{\\text{on}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}} \\approx k_{\\text{on}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The equation reduces to a direct relationship between the change in free energy and the change in the dissociation rate:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} \\approx RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} \\right)$$\nWe can now solve for the ratio of the dissociation rates:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = +1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $R = 1.987\\,\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy, $RT$:\n$$RT = (1.987\\,\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 615.97\\,\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nNext, we calculate the exponent:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}}{RT} = \\frac{1500\\,\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}}}{615.97\\,\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 2.435$$\nNow, we find the ratio of the rates:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = e^{2.435} \\approx 11.41$$\nThis result indicates that the Y84A mutation increases the peptide dissociation rate by a factor of approximately $11.4$. A factor of $10$ is an order of magnitude, so this is \"roughly an order of magnitude\".\n\nFinally, we calculate the new dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}$:\n$$k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}} = k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\times \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times 11.41 \\approx 1.14 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThe positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ indicates a destabilization of the complex, which corresponds to a shorter peptide residency time (higher $k_{\\text{off}}$) and thus lower thermal stability.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. The mutation weakens C-terminal anchoring by removing a direct hydrogen bond and the tyrosine wall of the $F$ pocket, leading to an increase in $k_{\\text{off}}$ by roughly an order of magnitude (to approximately $1\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$) with little change in $k_{\\text{on}}$, and thus a less thermally stable peptide–MHC class I complex.\n- **Analysis:** This statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The structural description is correct. The calculated increase in $k_{\\text{off}}$ is by a factor of $\\approx 11.4$ (roughly an order of magnitude) to a value of $\\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ (which is approximately $1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$). The condition of \"little change in $k_{\\text{on}}$\" is used as a premise. The conclusion of a \"less thermally stable\" complex is correct, as destabilization ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}>0$) implies lower stability.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\nB. The mutation strengthens C-terminal anchoring because alanine allows tighter packing and additional water-mediated hydrogen bonds, decreasing $k_{\\text{off}}$ by about a factor of $2$ and increasing complex thermal stability.\n- **Analysis:** This contradicts the given information. The problem states $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} \\approx +1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is a destabilization, not a strengthening or an increase in stability. Correspondingly, $k_{\\text{off}}$ must increase, not decrease.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nC. The mutation primarily increases $k_{\\text{on}}$ by about a factor of $10$ due to a larger pocket entrance while leaving $k_{\\text{off}}$ unchanged, yielding faster binding and a more thermally stable complex.\n- **Analysis:** This directly contradicts the problem's assumption that \"$k_{\\text{on}}$ is not significantly altered\". It also incorrectly claims $k_{\\text{off}}$ is unchanged, which is inconsistent with the destabilizing energy change. Finally, it wrongly concludes the complex is more stable.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nD. The mutation has negligible effects on peptide binding kinetics or stability but alters only T cell receptor recognition due to changes at the surface distant from the peptide C-terminus.\n- **Analysis:** This is factually incorrect based on the provided data. A change in $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ of $+1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ and a corresponding order-of-magnitude change in $k_{\\text{off}}$ are not \"negligible\" effects. The problem also explicitly directs to ignore TCR recognition.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2869031"}]}
