This exercise provides direct practice in deciphering these binding rules by using an established \"binding motif\" for a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele to predict which of two candidate peptides is more likely to be presented. Mastering this skill is fundamental to understanding immunogenicity and the computational prediction of T cell epitopes [@problem_id:2865983].", "problem": "A Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule presents intracellular peptides to T cells by binding short peptides in a groove whose specificity is governed by allele-defined pockets that impose residue preferences at discrete peptide positions. For MHC class I, the two primary anchors are typically at peptide position $P2$ (engaging the so-called B pocket) and the C-terminal position $P\\Omega$ (engaging the F pocket). The binding contribution of a peptide can be reasoned from the compatibility of its side chains at $P2$ and $P\\Omega$ with the allele’s pocket chemistry, along with secondary contributions from other positions.

The description of MHC class $I$ peptide presentation, the role of primary anchor residues at positions $P2$ and $P\\Omega$, the concept of allele-specific binding pockets, and the known binding motif for HLA-B\\*07:02 (a preference for Proline at $P2$ and hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus) are all factually correct and central to the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The question asks for a comparative assessment, which leads to a unique and meaningful conclusion based on the provided framework.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information (the peptides, the allele, the binding preferences, and the core principle for evaluation) to arrive at a logical answer. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard application of established principles in immunology. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires a comparison of the binding likelihood of two $9$-mer peptides to the MHC class $I$ allele HLA-B\\*07:02. The fundamental basis for this comparison is the degree to which each peptide satisfies the primary anchor preferences of the allele at positions $P2$ and $P\\Omega$. For a $9$-mer peptide, the C-terminal position $P\\Omega$ is position $P9$.\n\nThe stated preferences for HLA-B\\*07:02 are:\n1.  Position $P2$: Proline ($P$).\n2.  Position $P\\Omega$ ($P9$): A hydrophobic residue.\n\nLet us analyze each peptide.\n\n**Peptide 1: “APRTVYQLL”**\n- The sequence is $A-P-R-T-V-Y-Q-L-L$.\n- **Position $P2$**: The residue is Proline ($P$). This **satisfies** the primary anchor preference for position $P2$.\n- **Position $P9$ ($P\\Omega$)**: The residue is Leucine ($L$). Leucine is an aliphatic amino acid with a nonpolar, hydrophobic side chain. This **satisfies** the primary anchor preference for a hydrophobic residue at the C-terminus.\n\nConclusion for Peptide 1: “APRTVYQLL” satisfies both of the specified primary anchor preferences for HLA-B\\*07:02. It is therefore predicted to be a strong binder.\n\n**Peptide 2: “AQPTVYQLL”**\n- The sequence is $A-Q-P-T-V-Y-Q-L-L$.\n- **Position $P2$**: The residue is Glutamine ($Q$). Glutamine has a polar, uncharged side chain. It is not Proline. This **fails to satisfy** the primary anchor preference for position $P2$.\n- **Position $P9$ ($P\\Omega$)**: The residue is Leucine ($L$). As established, Leucine is hydrophobic. This **satisfies** the primary anchor preference for the C-terminus.\n\nConclusion for Peptide 2: “AQPTVYQLL” satisfies only one of the two primary anchor preferences. It fails to meet the critical requirement at position $P2$.\n\n**Comparison**\nBased on the explicit rule that binding is driven by satisfying the primary anchor preferences at $P2$ and $P\\Omega$, \"APRTVYQLL\" is a far more likely binder than \"AQPTVYQLL\". The first peptide fulfills both primary requirements, while the second fulfills only one. The mismatch at $P2$ for the second peptide is a significant defect.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. “APRTVYQLL” is more likely to bind because it satisfies the $P2$-proline and C-terminal hydrophobic preferences, whereas “AQPTVYQLL” does not.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derivation above. \"APRTVYQLL\" has $P$ at $P2$ and $L$ (hydrophobic) at $P9$. \"AQPTVYQLL\" has $Q$ at $P2$ (not $P$) and $L$ at $P9$. The reasoning and conclusion are entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. “AQPTVYQLL” is more likely to bind because a proline at $P3$ can substitute for the lack of proline at $P2$ in engaging the B pocket.**\nThis statement is immunologically unsound. The peptide backbone is held in a constrained conformation within the MHC binding groove. The B pocket is structurally positioned to accommodate the side chain of the residue at $P2$. The side chain of the residue at $P3$ projects from a different position on the peptide backbone and typically points away from the B pocket. It cannot physically occupy the B pocket as a substitute for the $P2$ residue. The problem statement itself defines the B pocket as engaging $P2$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both peptides are equally likely to bind because they share the same C-terminal residue, and the C-terminal anchor dominates over $P2$.**\nThe problem identifies both $P2$ and $P\\Omega$ as *primary* anchors, implying they are both of high importance. It provides no information to suggest that one dominates the other. To assume a hierarchy of anchors is to introduce outside information not supported by the problem statement. Based on the given rules, a peptide satisfying two primary anchors is superior to one satisfying only one. Therefore, they are not equally likely to bind.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither peptide is likely to bind because “APRTVYQLL” contains a basic residue at $P3$, and “AQPTVYQLL” lacks a proline at $P2$, so both violate critical rules.**\nThis option contains two claims. The first claim is that \"APRTVYQLL\" violates a critical rule due to the basic residue Arginine ($R$) at $P3$. The problem does not state any prohibitive rules for secondary positions like $P3$. It only mentions \"secondary contributions,\" which can be positive, neutral, or negative, but are not described as \"critical.\" The peptide \"APRTVYQLL\" perfectly satisfies the two explicitly stated critical rules for the primary anchors. The second claim, that \"AQPTVYQLL\" lacks a proline at $P2$, is true, but this does not support the overall conclusion that *neither* is likely to bind. \"APRTVYQLL\" is a very strong candidate. The premise that both violate critical rules is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2865983"}, {"introduction": "After understanding the rules of binding, we now move inside the cell to explore how optimal peptides are selected for presentation. This problem challenges you to connect the molecular function of tapasin, a key component of the peptide-loading complex, to a measurable biophysical outcome—the thermal stability of the final peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex. This practice illustrates the crucial concept of \"peptide editing\" and how cellular quality control mechanisms ensure that only stable, high-affinity pMHC complexes reach the cell surface [@problem_id:2866002].", "problem": "A researcher isolates the total pool of cell-surface peptide–Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (pMHC I) molecules from two otherwise isogenic human cell lines: a wild-type line and a line with a complete loss of tapasin (a component of the peptide-loading complex, PLC). The researcher then measures the thermal unfolding behavior of the purified pools by Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF), which reports an apparent melting temperature $T_m$ distribution for the heterogeneous mixture of pMHC I species. Assume the following well-established facts: (i) peptide binding stabilizes MHC I heavy chain–beta-2 microglobulin into the folded pMHC I, and the magnitude of stabilization increases with peptide affinity; (ii) higher apparent $T_m$ reflects greater thermodynamic stability of the folded complex; (iii) tapasin, within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) peptide-loading complex, catalyzes peptide exchange and edits the peptide repertoire toward higher-affinity ligands. Based solely on these principles, which qualitative change best describes how the loss of tapasin would be reflected in the DSF-derived $T_m$ distribution of cell-surface pMHC I?\n\nA. Relative to wild-type, tapasin-deficient cells show a left-shifted and broadened $T_m$ distribution with an increased low-$T_m$ shoulder, consistent with a larger fraction of suboptimally loaded or partially empty MHC I; a minor high-$T_m$ subpopulation may persist from alleles that are relatively tapasin-independent.\n\nB. Relative to wild-type, tapasin-deficient cells show a right-shifted and narrowed $T_m$ distribution because the absence of tapasin reduces peptide exchange, locking in only the highest-affinity peptides.\n\nC. The mean $T_m$ is unchanged, but the overall fluorescence amplitude decreases because tapasin loss affects dye accessibility rather than thermodynamic stability.\n\nD. The distribution becomes bimodal with both modes at higher $T_m$ values because peptide supply from the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) is unrestricted in the absence of tapasin, favoring more stable complexes.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation to ensure its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe explicit information provided in the problem statement is as follows:\n- **System**: Two isogenic human cell lines are used: one wild-type (WT) and one with a complete loss of tapasin.\n- **Analyte**: The total pool of cell-surface peptide–Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (pMHC I) molecules.\n- **Methodology**: Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) is employed to measure thermal unfolding.\n- **Measurement**: The experiment yields an apparent melting temperature ($T_m$) distribution for the heterogeneous pMHC I mixture.\n- **Principle (i)**: Peptide binding stabilizes the pMHC I complex.

The roles of MHC class I, peptides, the peptide-loading complex (PLC), tapasin, and the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) are textbook knowledge. The stated relationship between peptide affinity, pMHC I stability, and melting temperature ($T_m$) is a fundamental concept in biophysics and protein chemistry. The experimental setup is standard. The premises are factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear biological perturbation (loss of tapasin) and asks for the resulting biophysical consequence ($T_m$ distribution change) based on a defined set of principles. A unique, qualitative solution can be logically derived from the provided information.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It uses established scientific terminology and relies on explicitly stated \"well-established facts\" as axioms for deduction, avoiding any subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution is derived by a logical synthesis of the three provided principles.\n\n1.  **Function of Tapasin (Principle iii)**: Tapasin is an editor. In wild-type (WT) cells, it ensures that the MHC class I molecules that eventually reach the cell surface are predominantly loaded with high-affinity peptides. It accomplishes this by stabilizing the peptide-receptive state of MHC I within the PLC and catalyzing the dissociation of low-affinity peptides, allowing higher-affinity peptides to bind and form a stable complex that can be exported from the ER.\n\n2.  **Consequence of Tapasin Loss**: In the tapasin-deficient cell line, this critical peptide editing function is absent. MHC class I molecules will load peptides in a less discriminating manner. Consequently, the repertoire of peptides that successfully load onto MHC I and are transported to the cell surface will be much broader and of significantly lower average affinity compared to the WT case. This pool will include many suboptimal peptides. Furthermore, a fraction of MHC I molecules may fail to acquire any stable peptide and either be retained/degraded in the ER or reach the cell surface in a highly unstable, \"partially empty\" or peptide-receptive conformation.\n\n3.  **Relating Peptide Affinity to Stability and $T_m$ (Principles i & ii)**: Principle (i) states that stability is proportional to peptide affinity. Principle (ii) states that $T_m$ is a direct measure of stability. Therefore, a higher peptide affinity results in a higher $T_m$.\n\n4.  **Prediction of the $T_m$ Distribution**:\n    -   Because the tapasin-deficient cells express a pMHC I pool with a lower average peptide affinity, the average thermal stability of this pool must be lower than that of the WT pool. This translates to a **left shift** in the overall $T_m$ distribution, meaning the mean or peak $T_m$ will be at a lower temperature.\n    -   The loss of the editing filter means that the range of peptide affinities represented on the cell surface will be much wider than in WT cells. In WT, selection favors a narrow range of high-affinities. In the knockout, affinities will range from very low to moderate. This increased heterogeneity in stability will cause a **broadening** of the $T_m$ distribution.\n    -   The presence of a significant population of very low-affinity or partially empty complexes, which are extremely unstable, will create a prominent feature at the low-temperature end of the distribution, described as an **increased low-$T_m$ shoulder** or sub-peak.\n    -   It is also an established fact (though provided as a hint within option A, its logic is sound) that certain MHC I alleles are \"tapasin-independent\" and can load high-affinity peptides with reasonable efficiency even without tapasin. Therefore, it is plausible that a **minor subpopulation** of highly stable pMHC I complexes persists, which would be observed as a small peak or tail at high $T_m$ values.\n\nIn summary, the loss of tapasin is expected to result in a pMHC I surface population that is, on average, less stable and more heterogeneous. This corresponds to a $T_m$ distribution that is shifted to lower temperatures, is broader, and possesses a significant low-$T_m$ component.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **A. Relative to wild-type, tapasin-deficient cells show a left-shifted and broadened $T_m$ distribution with an increased low-$T_m$ shoulder, consistent with a larger fraction of suboptimally loaded or partially empty MHC I; a minor high-$T_m$ subpopulation may persist from alleles that are relatively tapasin-independent.**\n    This description perfectly matches the logical deductions made above. The left-shift reflects lower average stability. The broadening reflects increased heterogeneity. The low-$T_m$ shoulder reflects the presence of highly unstable, suboptimally loaded complexes. The persistence of a minor high-$T_m$ population is a known nuance for tapasin-independent alleles. This statement is entirely consistent with the provided principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Relative to wild-type, tapasin-deficient cells show a right-shifted and narrowed $T_m$ distribution because the absence of tapasin reduces peptide exchange, locking in only the highest-affinity peptides.**\n    This is incorrect. A \"right-shift\" implies increased stability, which contradicts the known function of tapasin as a quality control factor that promotes stability. The reasoning that loss of exchange \"locks in\" high-affinity peptides is flawed; it is more likely to lock in the *first* peptides that bind, which are statistically more likely to be of low or moderate affinity. Loss of editing leads to decreased, not increased, stringency.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. The mean $T_m$ is unchanged, but the overall fluorescence amplitude decreases because tapasin loss affects dye accessibility rather than thermodynamic stability.**\n    This is incorrect. Principle (iii) states that tapasin edits the peptide repertoire. Principle (i) links the peptide to stability. Principle (ii) links stability to $T_m$. It is therefore a logical necessity that the mean $T_m$ *must* change. Claiming stability is unaffected is a direct contradiction of the problem's premises.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. The distribution becomes bimodal with both modes at higher $T_m$ values because peptide supply from the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) is unrestricted in the absence of tapasin, favoring more stable complexes.**\n    This is incorrect. The prediction of higher $T_m$ values (higher stability) is wrong for the reasons already stated. The reasoning is also factually flawed. Tapasin forms a bridge between MHC I and TAP, facilitating efficient peptide transfer. The loss of tapasin uncouples this interaction, which can *impair*, not unrestrict, the loading of peptides from TAP.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2866002"}, {"introduction": "The ability to present antigens is itself a tightly regulated process, controlled at the level of gene transcription.

The roles of $CIITA$ as a master coactivator, the enhanceosome complex ($RFX$, $NF-Y$, $CREB/ATF$), and the conserved S-X-Y promoter architecture for $HLA$ class II genes are all central and accepted concepts in the field.

It describes a molecular defect and its context using standard scientific terminology.\n-   **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information: the nature of the defect (*cis*-element mutation), the status of the key *trans*-factors ($CIITA$, enhanceosome components), and the specific gene locus affected ($HLA-DR$). There are no internal contradictions. The principles laid out at the beginning serve as the axioms for solving the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed question in molecular biology that tests the understanding of gene regulation by distinguishing between *cis*- and *trans*-acting elements. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem describes a classic loss-of-function scenario due to a mutation in a *cis*-regulatory element. The central logic is as follows:\n\n1.  Transcription of $HLA$ class II genes requires the assembly of a DNA-binding \"enhanceosome\" complex, consisting of $RFX$, $NF-Y$, and $CREB/ATF$, on the conserved S-X-Y box promoter module.\n2.  This enhanceosome serves as a docking platform to recruit the non-DNA-binding master coactivator, $CIITA$.\n3.  $CIITA$ then orchestrates the assembly of the general transcriptional machinery, leading to gene expression.\n\nIn the given cell line, the defect is a \"clustered point mutation\" in the S box of the $HLA-DR$ promoter. This specific *cis*-defect will disrupt the formation or stability of the enhanceosome complex exclusively at the $HLA-DR$ locus. Consequently, the recruitment of $CIITA$ to the $HLA-DR$ promoter will fail.\n\nEven though $IFN-\\gamma$ stimulation leads to robust induction of $CIITA$ expression, the resulting $CIITA$ protein cannot function at the $HLA-DR$ promoter because its essential DNA-docking platform is compromised. This directly leads to a selective failure of $HLA-DR$ transcription.\n\nSince the promoters of other class II genes, such as $HLA-DQ$ and $HLA-DP$, are wild-type, the enhanceosome will assemble correctly on them. The induced $CIITA$ will be successfully recruited to these loci, leading to their normal, inducible expression.\n\nTherefore, the predicted phenotype is a selective loss of $HLA-DR$ expression, while other class II genes remain inducible.\n\nNow, we evaluate the rescue strategies based on the problem's explicit principle: \"defects in *cis*-elements... cannot be overcome solely by increasing *trans*-acting factor abundance\".\n-   Increasing *trans*-factors ($CIITA$, $RFX$, $NF-Y$) will not work because the DNA \"landing strip\" is broken.\n-   A valid rescue must either fix the broken landing strip (promoter repair) or bypass the need for it (artificially tethering the coactivator to the DNA).\n\nWith this framework, we analyze each option:\n\n**A. Selective failure of HLA-DR transcription and surface expression despite normal CIITA induction, with preserved inducibility of other class II loci that have intact promoters; not rescued by IFN-$\\gamma$ or CIITA overexpression, but rescued by restoring the cis-element or artificially tethering the coactivator to DNA (for example, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats–deactivated Cas9 fused to CIITA targeted to the HLA-DR promoter, or precise promoter repair).**\n\n*   **Phenotype Prediction**: \"Selective failure of $HLA-DR$ transcription... with preserved inducibility of other class II loci\". This perfectly matches the derived phenotype. The defect is local to the $HLA-DR$ promoter.\n*   **Rescue Strategy Evaluation**: It correctly states that increasing *trans*-factors ($IFN-\\gamma$ to boost $CIITA$, or direct $CIITA$ overexpression) will fail. It then proposes two biologically sound and logical solutions: 1) restoring the *cis*-element (\"precise promoter repair\"), which directly fixes the root cause, and 2) bypassing the defective recruitment step by artificially tethering the coactivator $CIITA$ to the promoter using a system like $dCas9-CIITA$. This bypasses the need for the S-box-dependent enhanceosome assembly for recruitment. This entire statement is consistent with the initial principles.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Global loss of all class II genes and invariant chain due to a proximal Janus kinase 2 ($JAK2$) signaling bottleneck; fully rescued by high-dose IFN-$\\gamma$.**\n\n*   **Phenotype Prediction**: \"Global loss of all class II genes\". This is incorrect. The mutation is specific to the $HLA-DR$ promoter.\n*   **Cause**: \"$JAK2$ signaling bottleneck\". This is contradicted by the given information that \"$CIITA$ gene is intact and robustly induced by $IFN-\\gamma$\". $IFN-\\gamma$ signals through the $JAK-STAT$ pathway, so robust $CIITA$ induction proves the pathway is functional.\n*   **Rescue Strategy Evaluation**: \"fully rescued by high-dose $IFN-\\gamma$\". This violates the axiom that increasing *trans*-acting factors cannot rescue a *cis*-element defect.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Selective loss of the accessory molecule HLA-DM with intact HLA-DR, because the S box controls only accessory genes; rescued by overexpression of Regulatory Factor X subunit 5 ($RFX5$).**\n\n*   **Phenotype Prediction**: \"Selective loss of... $HLA-DM$ with intact $HLA-DR$\". This is incorrect. The mutation is explicitly stated to be in the $HLA-DR$ promoter. Furthermore, the S-X-Y box is the canonical promoter for classical class II genes ($DR$, $DQ$, $DP$), not exclusively for accessory genes.\n*   **Rescue Strategy Evaluation**: \"rescued by overexpression of $RFX5$\". This proposes rescuing a *cis*-defect with a *trans*-factor, which is proscribed by the problem's rules.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Normal basal HLA-DR transcription but failure upon activation because the S box functions only as a high-amplitude enhancer; rescued by tumor necrosis factor-$\\alpha$ co-stimulation to bypass the S box.**\n\n*   **Phenotype Prediction**: \"Normal basal... but failure upon activation\". The S-X-Y module is generally considered essential for establishing the transcription-competent state, affecting both basal and induced expression. The claim that the S box is *only* for high-amplitude enhancement is an unsubstantiated assertion. A defect in a core promoter element is expected to cripple transcription more fundamentally.\n*   **Rescue Strategy Evaluation**: \"rescued by $TNF-\\alpha$ co-stimulation\". This introduces an unrelated pathway without any mechanistic basis for how it would bypass a structural defect in the $HLA-DR$ promoter's DNA sequence.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Markedly reduced HLA-DR expression that can be fully rescued by overexpressing Nuclear Factor Y subunit A (NF-YA) and RFX to saturate the X and Y boxes, thereby bypassing the requirement for the mutated S box without altering the promoter.**\n\n*   **Phenotype Prediction**: \"Markedly reduced $HLA-DR$ expression\". This is plausible, but less precise than \"failure\".\n*   **Rescue Strategy Evaluation**: \"fully rescued by overexpressing $NF-YA$ and $RFX$\". This directly and flagrantly violates the central rule provided in the problem statement: a *cis*-defect cannot be overcome by overexpressing *trans*-factors. The S, X, and Y boxes are known to act cooperatively, and simply saturating two of them is not expected to compensate for the loss of the third.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2865969"}]}
