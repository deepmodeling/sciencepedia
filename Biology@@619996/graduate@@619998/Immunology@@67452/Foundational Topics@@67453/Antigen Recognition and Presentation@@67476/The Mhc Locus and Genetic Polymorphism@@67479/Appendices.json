The problem provides the fundamental principles for this determination:\n1. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule's peptide-binding groove is formed by the $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ domains of the heavy chain.\n2. Consequently, polymorphisms that alter peptide-binding specificity are predominantly located within these two domains.\n\nThe problem supplies the precise residue boundaries for each domain of the mature heavy chain:\n- $\\alpha_1$ domain: residues 25–114\n- $\\alpha_2$ domain: residues 115–206\n- $\\alpha_3$ domain: residues 207–297\n- Transmembrane segment: residues 298–336\n- Cytoplasmic tail: residues 337–365\n\nThe logical procedure is to first classify each of the given variants into its respective domain based on its position number and then to select the set of variants falling within the $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ domains.\n\nHere is the classification of each variant:\n- K66N: Position 66 is within the range [25, 114].

K146N, W147R, Y116F, Q152E\nAll variants in this option are located in the $\\alpha_2$ domain. This is a correct subset of variants that can alter the peptide-binding groove. However, it is significantly less complete than option A, as it omits all four variants from the $\\alpha_1$ domain and three others from the $\\alpha_2$ domain that are listed in option A.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.

Therefore, these variants are not the most likely to alter peptide presentation directly.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nD. I314T, S343P\nThe variant I314T is in the transmembrane segment, and S343P is in the cytoplasmic tail. Neither of these domains is part of the extracellular peptide-binding structure. These variants would affect membrane anchoring or intracellular signaling, not peptide binding.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nE. K66N, D77N, L290P\nThis option contains a mix of variants. K66N and D77N are correctly identified as being in the $\\alpha_1$ domain. However, L290P is in the $\\alpha_3$ domain. The inclusion of a variant outside the peptide-binding groove domains makes this option incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only choice that exclusively contains variants from the $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ domains and is the most extensive such list offered.

Population genetics provides a powerful framework for this analysis, with the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) serving as a null model against which we can detect evolutionary forces.

Although HLA-B is highly polymorphic, this aggregation yields a tractable test of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), appropriate when evaluating deviations attributable to selection or assortative mating that act at the motif level. The data are: $n = 6$ individuals with observed genotype counts $B1/B1 = 3$, $B1/B2 = 1$, and $B2/B2 = 2$. The corresponding allele counts are $M_{B1} = 7$ and $M_{B2} = 5$ among $2n = 12$ gene copies.\n\nStarting from the random union of gametes model for HWE and conditioning on the observed total number of $B1$ alleles, $M_{B1} = M$, treat each allocation of the $M$ copies of the $B1$ allele among the $2n$ gene copies as equally likely under equilibrium.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem requires the validation of a dataset against Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using a conditional exact test, followed by an interpretation of the findings.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem statement must be assessed.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Sample size (number of diploid individuals): $n = 6$.\n- Allele categories at the HLA-B locus: $B1$ and $B2$.\n- Observed genotype counts: $3$ individuals of genotype $B1/B1$, $1$ individual of genotype $B1/B2$, and $2$ individuals of genotype $B2/B2$.\n- Observed allele counts: $M_{B1} = 7$ and $M_{B2} = 5$.\n- Total number of gene copies in the sample: $2n = 12$.\n- The test is to be conditioned on the observed total number of $B1$ alleles, $M \\equiv M_{B1} = 7$.\n- The model assumes that under the null hypothesis of HWE, each allocation of the $M$ copies of the $B1$ allele among the $2n$ gene copies is equally likely.\n- The two-sided $p$-value is defined as the sum of conditional probabilities of all possible heterozygote counts, $h$, for which the conditional probability is less than or equal to that of the observed heterozygote count.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is well-defined and scientifically grounded in the field of population genetics. The data provided are internally consistent: the total number of individuals is $3+1+2=6$, which matches $n=6$. The count of the $B1$ allele is $2 \\times (\\text{count of } B1/B1) + 1 \\times (\\text{count of } B1/B2) = 2 \\times 3 + 1 = 7$, matching $M_{B1}$.

The total number of alleles is $7+5=12$, which equals $2n$. The specified statistical procedure, the conditional exact test for HWE, is a standard method for analyzing genotype count data, especially with small sample sizes. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is posed objectively.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Conditional Probability Mass Function**\n\nLet $H$ be the random variable representing the number of heterozygotes ($B1/B2$) in a sample of $n$ individuals. We are asked to find the conditional probability mass function $P(H=h | n, M)$, where $n$ is the number of individuals and $M$ is the count of the $B1$ allele.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of HWE, and conditioning on the observed allele counts, we consider all possible ways to arrange the $M$ copies of the $B1$ allele and the $2n-M$ copies of the $B2$ allele among the $2n$ available gene slots (two for each of the $n$ individuals). The total number of distinct arrangements of these alleles is given by the binomial coefficient for choosing the positions of the $M$ $B1$ alleles:\n$$ N_{total} = \\binom{2n}{M} $$\nThis constitutes the size of our sample space.\n\nNext, we must determine the number of these arrangements that result in exactly $h$ heterozygotes. Let this number be $N(H=h)$.\nAn individual is heterozygous if they possess one $B1$ and one $B2$ allele.\nFor a sample to contain exactly $h$ heterozygotes, the following must hold:\n1. We must choose $h$ individuals out of the total $n$ to be heterozygous. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{n}{h}$.\n2. For each of these $h$ chosen individuals, one gene copy must be $B1$ and the other must be $B2$. For each individual, there are two gene slots. The $B1$ can be in the first slot and $B2$ in the second, or vice versa. Thus, for each heterozygous individual, there are $2$ ways to arrange the alleles. For $h$ such individuals, there are $2^h$ possible arrangements.\n3. The remaining $n-h$ individuals must be homozygous.\n4. The $h$ heterozygotes account for $h$ copies of the $B1$ allele and $h$ copies of the $B2$ allele. This leaves $M-h$ copies of $B1$ and $(2n-M)-h$ copies of $B2$ to be distributed among the $n-h$ homozygous individuals.\n5. The remaining $M-h$ copies of the $B1$ allele must form $\\frac{M-h}{2}$ homozygous $B1/B1$ individuals. For this to be an integer, $M$ and $h$ must have the same parity.\n6. The remaining $(2n-M)-h$ copies of the $B2$ allele must form $\\frac{2n-M-h}{2}$ homozygous $B2/B2$ individuals. For this to be an integer, $2n-M$ and $h$ must have the same parity, which is the same condition as the previous point.\n7. From the $n-h$ individuals designated as homozygous, we must select $\\frac{M-h}{2}$ of them to be $B1/B1$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{n-h}{(M-h)/2}$. The remaining $\\frac{2n-M-h}{2}$ individuals are then, by necessity, of genotype $B2/B2$.\n\nCombining these steps, the total number of arrangements corresponding to $h$ heterozygotes is the product of the number of ways for each step:\n$$ N(H=h) = \\binom{n}{h} \\binom{n-h}{\\frac{M-h}{2}} 2^h $$\nThe conditional probability of observing $h$ heterozygotes is the ratio of $N(H=h)$ to $N_{total}$:\n$$ P(H=h | n, M) = \\frac{\\binom{n}{h} \\binom{n-h}{(M-h)/2} 2^h}{\\binom{2n}{M}} $$\nThis is the required probability mass function, valid for values of $h$ where all terms are well-defined (i.e., arguments of binomial coefficients are non-negative integers and $h$ has the same parity as $M$).\n\n**Calculation of the p-value for the Observed Data**\n\nThe given data are: $n=6$, $M=7$, and the observed number of heterozygotes is $h_{obs}=1$. The total number of gene copies is $2n=12$.\nThe support of the distribution for $H$ is determined by the constraints: $0 \\le h \\le n=6$; $h \\le M=7$; $h \\le 2n-M=5$. Also, $h$ must have the same parity as $M=7$, so $h$ must be odd. Therefore, the possible values for $h$ are $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$.\n\nThe denominator of the PMF is:\n$$ \\binom{2n}{M} = \\binom{12}{7} = \\frac{12!}{7!5!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 792 $$\nNow we calculate the probability for each possible value of $h \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}$.\n\nFor $h=1$:\n$$ P(H=1) = \\frac{\\binom{6}{1} \\binom{6-1}{(7-1)/2} 2^1}{\\binom{12}{7}} = \\frac{\\binom{6}{1} \\binom{5}{3} 2^1}{792} = \\frac{6 \\times 10 \\times 2}{792} = \\frac{120}{792} $$\n\nFor $h=3$:\n$$ P(H=3) = \\frac{\\binom{6}{3} \\binom{6-3}{(7-3)/2} 2^3}{\\binom{12}{7}} = \\frac{\\binom{6}{3} \\binom{3}{2} 2^3}{792} = \\frac{20 \\times 3 \\times 8}{792} = \\frac{480}{792} $$\n\nFor $h=5$:\n$$ P(H=5) = \\frac{\\binom{6}{5} \\binom{6-5}{(7-5)/2} 2^5}{\\binom{12}{7}} = \\frac{\\binom{6}{5} \\binom{1}{1} 2^5}{792} = \\frac{6 \\times 1 \\times 32}{792} = \\frac{192}{792} $$\nAs a check, the probabilities must sum to $1$: $\\frac{120+480+192}{792} = \\frac{792}{792} = 1$. The distribution is correct.\n\nThe observed heterozygote count is $h_{obs}=1$. The probability of this observation under the null hypothesis is $P(H=1) = 120/792$.\nThe two-sided $p$-value is the sum of probabilities of all outcomes that are as likely or less likely than the observed outcome. We compare the probabilities:\n$P(H=1) = 120/792$\n$P(H=3) = 480/792$\n$P(H=5) = 192/792$\nThe only outcome with probability less than or equal to $P(H=1)$ is $h=1$ itself.\nThus, the $p$-value is:\n$$ p\\text{-value} = P(H=1) = \\frac{120}{792} = \\frac{5}{33} $$\nConverting to a decimal, $5 \\div 33 \\approx 0.151515...$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.1515$.\n\n**Interpretation**\nThe expected number of heterozygotes under HWE is $E[H] = \\sum h P(H=h) = 1(\\frac{120}{792}) + 3(\\frac{480}{792}) + 5(\\frac{192}{792}) = \\frac{120 + 1440 + 960}{792} = \\frac{2520}{792} = \\frac{35}{11} \\approx 3.18$.\nThe observed count of $h_{obs}=1$ is substantially lower than the expected count, indicating a heterozygote deficiency. Such a deficiency can be caused by several factors, including inbreeding (which increases homozygosity) or selection against heterozygotes (underdominance). While heterozygote advantage (balancing selection) is typically expected at HLA loci, the data points towards an opposing trend. However, the calculated $p$-value of $0.1515$ is greater than the conventional significance threshold of $0.05$. Therefore, despite the apparent heterozygote deficiency, the observed data are not statistically inconsistent with the null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The deviation can plausibly be attributed to random sampling variation in this small sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1515}$$", "id": "2899450"}, {"introduction": "Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, such as the heterozygote excess often observed at MHC loci, strongly suggest the action of balancing selection.

It is a valid exercise in applied probability theory, modeling a fundamental concept in immunogenetics. All necessary data and constraints for a unique solution are provided. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in calculating the probability of a union of events. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of $N$ events, where $E_i$ is the event that allele $i$ presents a given peptide. The probability that at least one of these alleles presents the peptide is the probability of their union, $P(\\cup_{i=1}^N E_i)$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE) provides an exact formula for this probability:\n$$ P\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^N E_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^N P(E_i) - \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} P(E_i \\cap E_j) + \\sum_{1 \\le i < j < k \\le N} P(E_i \\cap E_j \\cap E_k) - \\dots + (-1)^{N-1} P\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^N E_i\\right) $$\nThe problem specifies that the individual presentation probabilities, $p_{\\ell}$, are small, and that the events are \"rare.\" This justifies truncating the PIE series at the second-order term. The higher-order terms involve products of three or more small probabilities (e.g., $p_A p_B p_C$), which are negligible compared to the first-order ($p_\\ell$) and second-order ($p_\\ell p_m$) terms. The approximation is thus:\n$$ P\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^N E_i\\right) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^N P(E_i) - \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} P(E_i \\cap E_j) $$\nThis approximation states that the total probability is the sum of individual probabilities, corrected for the pairwise overlaps to avoid double-counting.\n\nWe must compute this probability for two cases: a fully homozygous individual and a fully heterozygous individual.\n\nCase 1: Fully Homozygous Individual ($P_{\\mathrm{hom}}$)\nA fully homozygous individual has one unique allele at each of the three loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Let us denote these alleles as $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$. The events of interest are $E_{A_1}$, $E_{B_1}$, and $E_{C_1}$. The probability that at least one allele presents the peptide is $P_{\\mathrm{hom}} = P(E_{A_1} \\cup E_{B_1} \\cup E_{C_1})$.\n\nApplying the second-order PIE approximation:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{hom}} \\approx P(E_{A_1}) + P(E_{B_1}) + P(E_{C_1}) - \\left( P(E_{A_1} \\cap E_{B_1}) + P(E_{A_1} \\cap E_{C_1}) + P(E_{B_1} \\cap E_{C_1}) \\right) $$\nFrom the problem statement:\n- The first-order probabilities are $P(E_{A_1}) = p_A$, $P(E_{B_1}) = p_B$, and $P(E_{C_1}) = p_C$.\n- The second-order (intersection) probabilities involve alleles from different loci.

We group them by the type of interaction.\n- **Within-locus pairs**: These are pairs of alleles from the same locus. There are $3$ such pairs: $(A_1, A_2)$, $(B_1, B_2)$, and $(C_1, C_2)$.\nThe sum of their intersection probabilities is:\n$P(E_{A_1} \\cap E_{A_2}) + P(E_{B_1} \\cap E_{B_2}) + P(E_{C_1} \\cap E_{C_2}) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}p_A^2 + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}p_B^2 + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}p_C^2 = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}(p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_C^2)$.\n- **Between-locus pairs**: These are pairs of alleles from different loci.\n    - Pairs between locus A and B: There are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ such pairs. For each, the intersection probability is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}p_A p_B$. The total contribution is $4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}p_A p_B$.\n    - Pairs between locus A and C: Similarly, $4$ pairs with a total contribution of $4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}p_A p_C$.\n    - Pairs between locus B and C: Similarly, $4$ pairs with a total contribution of $4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}p_B p_C$.\nThe total sum for between-locus pairs is $4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}(p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C)$.\n\nCombining all second-order terms:\n$$ \\sum_{i < j} P(E_i \\cap E_j) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}(p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_C^2) + 4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}(p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C) $$\n\nSubstituting the sums back into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{het}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{het}} \\approx 2(p_A + p_B + p_C) - \\left[ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}(p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_C^2) + 4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}(p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C) \\right] $$\nThis expression reveals the \"diminishing returns\" of adding more alleles. While the first-order term doubles compared to the homozygous case, the subtractive second-order correction term grows more than quadratically (from $3$ pairwise terms to $15$), preventing the total probability from doubling. Heterozygosity at a locus (e.g., A) increases the locus-level probability from $p_A$ to $2p_A - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}p_A^2$, which is less than $2p_A$ due to overlap in peptide recognition.\n\nCalculation of the Fold-Change $\\mathcal{F}$\nWe are given the values: $p_A = 0.010$, $p_B = 0.015$, $p_C = 0.005$, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}} = 1.4$, and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}} = 1.1$.\n\nFirst, calculate intermediate sums:\n- $S_1 = p_A + p_B + p_C = 0.010 + 0.015 + 0.005 = 0.030$\n- $S_{2,\\mathrm{cross}} = p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C = (0.010)(0.015) + (0.010)(0.005) + (0.015)(0.005) = 0.00015 + 0.00005 + 0.000075 = 0.000275$\n- $S_{2,\\mathrm{sq}} = p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_C^2 = (0.010)^2 + (0.015)^2 + (0.005)^2 = 0.0001 + 0.000225 + 0.000025 = 0.00035$\n\nNow compute $P_{\\mathrm{hom}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{hom}} \\approx S_1 - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}S_{2,\\mathrm{cross}} = 0.030 - (1.1)(0.000275) = 0.030 - 0.0003025 = 0.0296975 $$\n\nNext, compute $P_{\\mathrm{het}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{het}} \\approx 2S_1 - \\left[ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{within}}S_{2,\\mathrm{sq}} + 4\\lambda_{\\mathrm{between}}S_{2,\\mathrm{cross}} \\right] $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{het}} \\approx 2(0.030) - \\left[ (1.4)(0.00035) + 4(1.1)(0.000275) \\right] $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{het}} \\approx 0.060 - \\left[ 0.00049 + 4(0.0003025) \\right] $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{het}} \\approx 0.060 - \\left[ 0.00049 + 0.00121 \\right] $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{het}} \\approx 0.060 - 0.0017 = 0.0583 $$\n\nFinally, compute the fold-change $\\mathcal{F}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{F} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{het}}}{P_{\\mathrm{hom}}} = \\frac{0.0583}{0.0296975} \\approx 1.963116... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as required, we obtain $\\mathcal{F} = 1.963$.\nThis result quantifies the significant, though not doubled, immunological advantage conferred by MHC heterozygosity in terms of the breadth of the peptide repertoire that can be presented.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.963} $$", "id": "2899414"}]}
