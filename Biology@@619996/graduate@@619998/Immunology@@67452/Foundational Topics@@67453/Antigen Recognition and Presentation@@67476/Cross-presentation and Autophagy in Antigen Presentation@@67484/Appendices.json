{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To master the complexities of antigen presentation, one must first solidify the foundational rule: the pathway to Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) presentation is dictated by the antigen's origin. This exercise challenges you to apply this core principle to two distinct scenarios—presentation of an exogenous protein versus a virally-coded endogenous protein. By correctly identifying the processing machinery required in each case, you will reinforce your understanding of the fundamental logic that separates the canonical MHC I pathway from the specialized process of cross-presentation [@problem_id:2844943].", "problem": "A dendritic cell (DC) can display peptides on Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) either from intracellular (endogenous) proteins or from exogenous proteins via cross-presentation. Two mechanistically distinct routes for exogenous cross-presentation are classically recognized: a cytosolic route in which antigens escape endosomes into the cytosol for proteasomal processing and Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP)–dependent import of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or ER-phagosome hybrids, and a vacuolar route in which peptides are generated by endo-lysosomal proteases and loaded onto MHC I in endosomal compartments without TAP. Macroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy) generally delivers cytosolic proteins to lysosomes and most strongly contributes to Major Histocompatibility Complex class II presentation, whereas LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) modulates phagosomal maturation and can influence antigen preservation versus degradation during cross-presentation.\n\nConsider the following two conditions using otherwise identical DC:\n- Condition X: DC are incubated with soluble full-length ovalbumin (OVA) protein and then assessed for surface SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ complexes, where SIINFEKL corresponds to the OVA residues $257\\text{–}264$.\n- Condition Y: DC are productively infected with a cytosolic-replicating virus expressing full-length OVA and then assessed for surface SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ complexes.\n\nStarting from the core definitions above, predict for each condition whether the SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ complexes are generated via a pathway that requires proteasomal proteolysis and TAP, and justify your choices by explicitly reasoning about the intracellular location of the source antigen, the route by which peptides access MHC I, and how autophagy or LAP would or would not be expected to contribute to SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ generation.\n\nWhich option best captures the correct mapping and mechanistic justification?\n\nA. Condition X generates SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ predominantly via a vacuolar, TAP-independent route because soluble OVA remains within endosomes and is cut by endosomal proteases; Condition Y generates SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ via the conventional endogenous MHC I pathway requiring the proteasome and TAP.\n\nB. Condition X can generate SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ via cytosolic cross-presentation that depends on proteasomal degradation and TAP-mediated peptide import into the ER or ER–phagosome hybrids; Condition Y generates SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ via the endogenous MHC I pathway that is proteasome- and TAP-dependent. Autophagy primarily supports class II presentation and is not required for SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ generation in either condition.\n\nC.

Condition X uses a cytosolic, TAP-dependent route to generate SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$, but Condition Y predominantly uses a vacuolar, TAP-independent pathway because viral antigens are abundant in autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes, bypassing the proteasome.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard immunological scenario to test the understanding of antigen processing pathways. All provided definitions and conditions are consistent with established principles in the field of immunology. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core task is to determine, for two distinct conditions, whether the generation of SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ complexes requires proteasomal proteolysis and the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP).\n\n**Analysis of Condition X**\n\nIn Condition X, dendritic cells (DCs) are incubated with soluble, full-length ovalbumin (OVA) protein.\n1.  **Antigen Source and Location:** The OVA protein is an exogenous antigen. It is taken up by the DC from the extracellular environment, primarily via endocytosis, and is initially contained within endosomal vesicles.\n2.  **Pathway to MHC I Presentation:** For an exogenous antigen to be presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I), the process of cross-presentation must occur. The problem statement outlines two routes. The predominant and classical route for soluble antigens like OVA is the cytosolic route. This entails the translocation of the OVA protein from the endosome into the cytosol.\n3.  **Processing Machinery:** Once in the cytosol, the OVA protein is treated as if it were an endogenous protein. It is ubiquitinated, unfolded, and degraded by the **proteasome** into smaller peptides. The resulting peptides, including the SIINFEKL epitope (residues $257\\text{–}264$), are then transported from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or a specialized ER-phagosome compartment by the **TAP** transporter.\n4.  **Loading and Display:** Inside the ER, the SIINFEKL peptide is loaded onto a nascent $H\\text{-}2K^b$ molecule, an MHC I allotype. This peptide-MHC complex is then stabilized and transported to the cell surface for presentation.\n5.  **Conclusion for Condition X:** This pathway explicitly depends on both **proteasomal degradation** and **TAP-mediated transport**. The vacuolar pathway, which is proteasome- and TAP-independent, is generally considered a minor route for this type of antigen. Macroautophagy delivers cytosolic components to the lysosome and is not the primary entry route for exogenous OVA.\n\n**Analysis of Condition Y**\n\nIn Condition Y, DCs are productively infected with a cytosolic-replicating virus that expresses full-length OVA.\n1.  **Antigen Source and Location:** The viral genome directs the host cell's translational machinery to synthesize OVA protein. Therefore, the OVA in this condition is an endogenous antigen, located directly within the **cytosol** of the DC.\n2.  **Pathway to MHC I Presentation:** This scenario represents the canonical endogenous MHC I presentation pathway.\n3.  **Processing Machinery:** Cytosolic proteins, including the virally-expressed OVA, are subject to constitutive turnover. They are targeted for degradation by the **proteasome**, which generates a pool of peptides.\n4.  **Loading and Display:** The resulting peptides, including SIINFEKL, are transported from the cytosol into the ER by the **TAP** transporter. In the ER, SIINFEKL binds to $H\\text{-}2K^b$ molecules, and the stable complexes are trafficked to the plasma membrane.\n5.  **Conclusion for Condition Y:** This pathway is the textbook definition of endogenous antigen presentation and fundamentally requires both the **proteasome** and **TAP**. While autophagy can deliver cytosolic material to lysosomes (primarily for MHC II presentation), it is not the principal pathway for generating MHC I peptides from a standard cytosolic protein.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- **Condition X:** Cross-presentation via the cytosolic route requires the proteasome and TAP.\n- **Condition Y:** Endogenous presentation via the classical pathway requires the proteasome and TAP.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Condition X generates SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ predominantly via a vacuolar, TAP-independent route because soluble OVA remains within endosomes and is cut by endosomal proteases; Condition Y generates SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ via the conventional endogenous MHC I pathway requiring the proteasome and TAP.**\nThe analysis of Condition Y is correct. However, the analysis of Condition X is incorrect. The cytosolic, TAP-dependent route is the major pathway for cross-presentation of soluble OVA, not the vacuolar one.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Condition X can generate SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ via cytosolic cross-presentation that depends on proteasomal degradation and TAP-mediated peptide import into the ER or ER–phagosome hybrids; Condition Y generates SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ via the endogenous MHC I pathway that is proteasome- and TAP-dependent. Autophagy primarily supports class II presentation and is not required for SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$ generation in either condition.**\nThis option correctly describes the pathway for Condition X as cytosolic cross-presentation, which is proteasome- and TAP-dependent. It correctly describes the pathway for Condition Y as the classical endogenous pathway, which is also proteasome- and TAP-dependent. The statement regarding autophagy's primary role in MHC II presentation and its non-essential role for MHC I presentation in these specific contexts is also accurate based on the problem's premises and general knowledge.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Condition X relies on endosomal proteases to produce SIINFEKL but requires TAP to load SIINFEKL onto MHC I in the ER; Condition Y requires autophagy to deliver viral OVA to lysosomes, where SIINFEKL is generated and then loaded onto recycling MHC I without TAP.**\nThe description for Condition X is mechanistically inconsistent. Peptides generated by endosomal proteases (vacuolar route) are not then transported by TAP into the ER (cytosolic route); these are mutually exclusive steps. The description for Condition Y incorrectly posits an autophagy-lysosome pathway as the dominant mechanism, contradicting the canonical proteasome-TAP pathway for endogenous antigens.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Condition X uses a cytosolic, TAP-dependent route to generate SIINFEKL–$H\\text{-}2K^b$, but Condition Y predominantly uses a vacuolar, TAP-independent pathway because viral antigens are abundant in autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes, bypassing the proteasome.**\nThe analysis of Condition X is correct. However, the analysis of Condition Y is incorrect. It wrongly suggests that the main pathway for a cytosolic viral antigen is an autophagy-mediated, TAP-independent one. The classical proteasome- and TAP-dependent pathway is the predominant mechanism.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2844943"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in modern cell biology is the ability to use chemical inhibitors as probes to dissect intricate molecular pathways.

Two mechanistically distinct routes can generate peptide–Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) complexes from exogenous protein: a cytosolic route and a vacuolar route. Use the following fundamental, well-tested facts as the only starting points for your reasoning and prediction.\n\n- In the cytosolic route, internalized antigens are exported from endosomes to the cytosol, degraded by the proteasome into peptides, transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), and loaded onto MHC I, sometimes followed by recycling to phagosomes. This route is proteasome- and TAP-dependent and is favored when endosomal proteolysis is restrained so that intact antigen persists long enough to be exported.\n- In the vacuolar route, internalized antigens are processed within endosomes or lysosomes by acid-dependent proteases (cathepsins), and peptides are loaded onto MHC I within those compartments, independent of proteasome and TAP.\n- Vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase) establishes and maintains low intraluminal acidity in endosomes and lysosomes, enabling cathepsin activity and promoting autophagosome–lysosome fusion. Inhibition of v-ATPase by bafilomycin raises endosomal and lysosomal pH and blocks late autophagic flux.\n\nPredict the impact of bafilomycin on cross-presentation through the cytosolic versus the vacuolar routes for a typical globular protein antigen internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis in conventional dendritic cells. Choose the single best option that captures both the direction of change in each route and the altered sensitivity to pathway-specific inhibitors.\n\nA. Cytosolic cross-presentation increases, remaining proteasome- and TAP-dependent, while vacuolar cross-presentation decreases due to loss of cathepsin activity; the bafilomycin-enhanced presentation is abrogated by proteasome or TAP inhibition but not further reduced by cathepsin inhibitors.\n\nB. Both cytosolic and vacuolar cross-presentation decrease because acidification is globally required for antigen unfolding and translocation; adding proteasome or cathepsin inhibitors produces little additional effect beyond bafilomycin.\n\nC. Vacuolar cross-presentation increases because antigens are retained longer in endosomes and can be loaded onto MHC I there, while cytosolic cross-presentation decreases due to inhibition of endosome-to-cytosol export; cathepsin inhibitors reverse the bafilomycin effect, but proteasome inhibition does not.\n\nD. Total cross-presentation is unchanged in magnitude and route usage; bafilomycin primarily upregulates costimulatory molecules without altering antigen processing, so inhibitor sensitivities remain the same.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of immunology and cell biology, well-posed, and provides a sufficient and consistent set of premises to logically deduce the outcome of the described experimental perturbation.\n\nThe task is to predict the effect of bafilomycin on the cytosolic and vacuolar routes of cross-presentation. Let us proceed by a step-by-step derivation based on the provided facts.\n\n1.  **Primary Action of Bafilomycin:** The problem states that bafilomycin is an inhibitor of the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase). The function of v-ATPase is to pump protons into endosomes and lysosomes, thereby maintaining a low intraluminal acidity. Consequently, inhibition of v-ATPase by bafilomycin will prevent this acidification, leading to an increase in the endosomal and lysosomal pH.\n\n2.  **Impact on the Vacuolar Route:** The vacuolar route is defined as being dependent on processing by \"acid-dependent proteases (cathepsins)\" within endosomes or lysosomes. As established in point $1$, bafilomycin raises the pH of these compartments, moving it away from the acidic optimum required for cathepsin activity. This directly inhibits the function of cathepsins. Without active cathepsins, the antigen cannot be processed into peptides within the vacuole. Therefore, the vacuolar route of cross-presentation will be substantially decreased or completely abrogated.\n\n3.  **Impact on the Cytosolic Route:** The cytosolic route is explicitly stated to be \"favored when endosomal proteolysis is restrained so that intact antigen persists long enough to be exported.\" By inhibiting cathepsin activity, bafilomycin accomplishes precisely this restraint of endosomal proteolysis. The antigen is protected from degradation within the endosome, increasing the quantity of intact antigen available for the subsequent step of the cytosolic pathway: export into the cytosol. This increased substrate availability for the cytosolic machinery (proteasome degradation, TAP transport, and loading onto MHC I) will lead to an enhancement of the cytosolic cross-presentation route.\n\n4.  **Predicted Sensitivity to Inhibitors:** The treatment with bafilomycin causes a mechanistic shift, shunting antigen processing from the vacuolar route to the cytosolic route.\n    *   Since the enhanced presentation now proceeds via the cytosolic pathway, it must be dependent on the machinery of that pathway. The problem states this route is \"proteasome- and TAP-dependent.\" Therefore, the bafilomycin-enhanced cross-presentation should be sensitive to and abrogated by the addition of proteasome inhibitors or TAP inhibitors.\n    *   The vacuolar pathway is already non-functional due to the high pH caused by bafilomycin. Adding a specific cathepsin inhibitor would target an enzymatic step that is already inactive due to the unfavorable pH environment. This is an instance of epistasis, where the effect of one inhibitor (bafilomycin) masks the potential effect of another (cathepsin inhibitor). Thus, adding cathepsin inhibitors should not cause a significant *further* reduction in cross-presentation beyond the effect of bafilomycin.\n\nBased on this derivation, we can evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. Cytosolic cross-presentation increases, remaining proteasome- and TAP-dependent, while vacuolar cross-presentation decreases due to loss of cathepsin activity; the bafilomycin-enhanced presentation is abrogated by proteasome or TAP inhibition but not further reduced by cathepsin inhibitors.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our step-by-step deduction. It correctly predicts an increase in the cytosolic route, a decrease in the vacuolar route, and the precise shift in sensitivity to pathway-specific inhibitors.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both cytosolic and vacuolar cross-presentation decrease because acidification is globally required for antigen unfolding and translocation; adding proteasome or cathepsin inhibitors produces little additional effect beyond bafilomycin.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It contradicts the premise that restrained endosomal proteolysis (which bafilomycin causes) *favors* the cytosolic route, implying it should increase, not decrease. It also introduces an unsubstantiated claim that acidification is required for translocation to the cytosol. The prediction about inhibitor sensitivity is also flawed, as proteasome inhibition should have a strong effect on the enhanced cytosolic pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Vacuolar cross-presentation increases because antigens are retained longer in endosomes and can be loaded onto MHC I there, while cytosolic cross-presentation decreases due to inhibition of endosome-to-cytosol export; cathepsin inhibitors reverse the bafilomycin effect, but proteasome inhibition does not.**\nThis statement makes several incorrect claims. Vacuolar cross-presentation will decrease, not increase, because the required acidic environment is lost. While antigen is retained, it cannot be processed for loading. It also incorrectly states that cytosolic cross-presentation decreases. The logic regarding inhibitor effects is nonsensical; a cathepsin inhibitor would mimic, not reverse, the proteolytic-inhibition aspect of bafilomycin's action.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Total cross-presentation is unchanged in magnitude and route usage; bafilomycin primarily upregulates costimulatory molecules without altering antigen processing, so inhibitor sensitivities remain the same.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It ignores the direct, stated effect of bafilomycin on endosomal pH and its necessary consequences for the two described antigen processing pathways. A change in the fundamental conditions (pH) for one pathway must alter the balance between the routes. The claim about costimulatory molecules is outside the scope of the provided premises.

Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is lipidated to form LC3-II on autophagosomal membranes, and its steady-state abundance reflects the balance between LC3-II generation and lysosomal degradation. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) inhibits the vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase), blocking autophagosome–lysosome fusion and acidification, thereby preventing LC3-II degradation. At steady state over a short time window, the amount of LC3-II that accumulates when degradation is blocked reflects the amount that would otherwise have been degraded, providing a basis to infer autophagic flux relevant to cross-presentation.\n\nA research team measures LC3-II turnover in primary DCs under two conditions: resting control (R) and cross-presentation-stimulated (CP) by antigen pulsing.

Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) inhibits this degradation.
