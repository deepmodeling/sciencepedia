This indicates that $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}(\\text{mut}) < \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}(\\text{WT})$. A smaller positive Gibbs free energy of dissociation implies that the dissociation process for the mutant is less non-spontaneous, or energetically less demanding, than for the wild-type. This means the mutant peptide-MHC complex is less stable than the wild-type complex. This is consistent with the initial data, where the mutant has a $10$-fold higher dissociation constant ($K_{D,\\ \\text{mut}} = 500\\ \\text{nM}$ vs $K_{D,\\ \\text{WT}} = 50\\ \\text{nM}$), signifying weaker binding affinity.\n\nIn the context of antigen presentation pathways:\n-   **Endogenous Pathway (MHC Class I)**: Peptides from intracellular proteins are loaded onto MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum. The stability of this complex is paramount for its transport to the cell surface and for sustained presentation to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The calculated negative $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}$ indicates that the mutation destabilizes the complex. A less stable pMHC-I complex is more likely to dissociate either before reaching the cell surface or too quickly upon arrival, leading to inefficient or failed activation of T cells. This could result in immune evasion by a pathogen or cancer cell.\n-   **Exogenous Pathway (MHC Class II)**: Extracellular antigens are processed and loaded onto MHC class II molecules in specialized endosomal compartments of professional antigen-presenting cells. These complexes are presented to helper CD4+ T cells. Similarly, a destabilizing mutation, as quantified by the negative $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}$, would reduce the half-life of the pMHC-II complex on the cell surface. This diminishes the duration and strength of the signal delivered to helper T cells, potentially leading to a weaker adaptive immune response.\n\nIn both pathways, the magnitude of $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}$ ($-5.935\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$) quantifies a significant loss in binding energy, consistent with a mutation at an important anchor residue that compromises the stability and, consequently, the immunogenicity of the presented peptide.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-5.935}\n$$", "id": "2833563"}, {"introduction": "Once a pMHC complex is successfully formed and displayed on the cell surface, its presentation is not permanent.

We can separate the variables $N$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state at time $t=0$ to a state at an arbitrary time $t>0$. The number of complexes changes from $N(0)$ to $N(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{N(0)}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{\\tilde{N}} \\, d\\tilde{N} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, d\\tilde{t}\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln|\\tilde{N}| \\right]_{N(0)}^{N(t)} = \\left[ -k\\tilde{t} \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince $N(t)$ represents a physical quantity (number of molecules), it is non-negative, so we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N(0)) = -kt - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for the ratio $\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nBy definition, the fraction of complexes remaining is $f(t) = \\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}$. Thus, we have the expression for $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNext, we must determine the rate constant $k$ from the given half-life, $t_{1/2} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$. By definition of half-life, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the number of complexes is half the initial number, $N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{N(0)}{2}$. Therefore, the fraction remaining at $t_{1/2}$ is:\n$$\nf(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{N(t_{1/2})}{N(0)} = \\frac{N(0)/2}{N(0)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting $t = t_{1/2}$ into our expression for $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t_{1/2}) = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(-k t_{1/2})\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-k t_{1/2} = -\\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $k$ back into the equation for $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-t/t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis gives the final, most direct expression for the fraction remaining at time $t$:\n$$\nf(t) = 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}\n$$\nUsing the given value $t_{1/2} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$, the specific function is $f(t) = 2^{-t/6}$, where $t$ is in hours.\n\nWe can now compute the required fractions.\nFor $t = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nf(12) = 2^{-12/6} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nFor $t = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nf(24) = 2^{-24/6} = 2^{-4} = \\frac{1}{2^4} = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\n\n**Discussion of Biological Implications**\nThe derived expression $f(t) = 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$ quantifies the exponential decay of peptide-MHC complexes on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC) such as a dendritic cell. The activation of a naive T lymphocyte—either a CD8$^{+}$ cytotoxic T cell recognizing a peptide on MHC-I or a CD4$^{+}$ helper T cell recognizing a peptide on MHC-II—requires the T cell receptor (TCR) to engage a sufficient density of its specific cognate peptide-MHC complex. This engagement must be sustained over a period of time to trigger a full activation signal.\n\nOur calculation shows that after $t=12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, which is two half-lives, only $25\\%$ of the original complexes remain. After $t=24\\,\\mathrm{h}$, or four half-lives, this number drops to a mere $6.25\\%$ ($1/16$) of the initial density. This rapid decay imposes a strict temporal window of opportunity for effective T cell activation. An APC is most potent shortly after it has processed and presented antigen. If a T cell with the correct TCR specificity does not encounter the APC within this timeframe, the density of the relevant peptide-MHC complexes may fall below the threshold required for stable TCR ligation and signal transduction.\n\nThis kinetic constraint is a fundamental regulatory mechanism. It ensures that immune responses are mounted against current, active threats and are not unduly sustained in response to antigens that have already been cleared. The continuous turnover of peptide-MHC complexes forces the immune system to constantly re-sample the antigenic environment, limiting the duration of T cell-APC interactions and preventing chronic, potentially auto-reactive or damaging, inflammatory responses. The half-life of a given peptide-MHC complex is therefore a critical parameter that helps shape the dynamics and magnitude of the adaptive immune response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{16} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2833531"}]}
