The peptide-binding groove of MHC class II (heterodimer of an $\\alpha$ chain and a $\\beta$ chain) accommodates a core of approximately $9$ residues, with side chains at positions $P1$, $P4$, $P6$, and $P9$ occupying distinct pockets. For many HLA-DR alleles, the $P1$ pocket is deep and hydrophobic, favoring bulky hydrophobic or aromatic side chains. The $P1$ pocket is largely shaped by polymorphic residues on the HLA-DR $\\beta$ chain, notably the residue at $\\beta 86$ at the floor of the pocket, and by hydrophobic contributions from the HLA-DR $\\alpha$ chain (for example, $\\alpha 24$ Phe and $\\alpha 31$ Tyr).\n\nYou are given the following:\n- Allele: HLA-DRB1*01:01, which has a hydrophobic $P1$ pocket consistent with $\\beta 86$ Gly and a hydrophobic microenvironment.\n- Peptide (length $16$): TQNVFDEASAVLLKQG\n- Task part $1$: Assign a plausible $9$-residue binding register for this peptide on HLA-DRB1*01:01.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided to deduce a logical solution based on established principles of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-peptide interactions.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. Task $1$ requires the identification of a plausible $9$-residue binding register for the given peptide on the HLA-DRB1*01:01 allele. Task $2$ requires proposing a minimal set of mutations on the HLA-DR $\\beta$ chain to invert the specificity of the $P1$ pocket from hydrophobic to positively charged.\n\n**Part 1: Binding Register Assignment**\n\nThe peptide sequence is TQNVFDEASAVLLKQG, a $16$-mer. The MHC class II binding groove accommodates a core of approximately $9$ amino acid residues. The HLA-DRB1*01:01 allele is described as having a deep and hydrophobic $P1$ pocket, favoring bulky hydrophobic or aromatic side chains. We must scan the peptide for potential $9$-residue segments where the first residue ($P1$) fits this description.\n\nThe peptide sequence is:\n$T_1-Q_2-N_3-V_4-F_5-D_6-E_7-A_8-S_9-A_{10}-V_{11}-L_{12}-L_{13}-K_{14}-Q_{15}-G_{16}$\n\nPotential hydrophobic/aromatic residues that could serve as the $P1$ anchor are Valine ($V$), Phenylalanine ($F$), and Leucine ($L$).\n\n1.  **Register starting at $V_4$**: The $9$-residue core would be $V_4FDEASAVL_{12}$.\n    -   $P1 = V$ (Valine): Hydrophobic, but less bulky than Phenylalanine ($F$) or Leucine ($L$). It is a plausible but not optimal candidate for a \"bulky hydrophobic\" preference.\n    -   $P4 = E$ (Glutamate): Negatively charged. While some alleles have pockets that can accommodate charged residues, it is generally less favorable for the canonical anchor pockets, which are often hydrophobic.\n    -   $P6 = S$ (Serine): A small, polar residue. The problem states \"$P6$ often tolerates small residues,\" making this acceptable.\n    -   $P9 = L$ (Leucine): A bulky hydrophobic residue. The problem states that HLA-DRB1*01:01 \"commonly tolerates hydrophobic residues at $P9$,\" making this a good fit.\n    The presence of a charged residue at $P4$ and a moderately bulky $P1$ makes this register plausible but perhaps suboptimal.\n\n2.  **Register starting at $F_5$**: The $9$-residue core would be $F_5DEASAVLL_{13}$.\n    -   $P1 = F$ (Phenylalanine): A bulky aromatic residue. This is an ideal fit for a deep, hydrophobic $P1$ pocket.\n    -   $P4 = A$ (Alanine): A small, hydrophobic residue. This is a very common and favorable residue for the typically hydrophobic $P4$ pocket of HLA-DR molecules.\n    -   $P6 = A$ (Alanine): A small residue. This fits the preference for small residues at $P6$.\n    -   $P9 = L$ (Leucine): A bulky hydrophobic residue. This fits the stated preference of HLA-DRB1*01:01 at $P9$.\n    This register is exceptionally well-suited to the described binding preferences. All anchor residues are highly plausible.\n\nOther potential registers beginning with hydrophobic anchors later in the sequence (e.g., at $V_{11}$, $L_{12}$, $L_{13}$) do not allow for a full $9$-mer core within the $16$-amino-acid peptide. Therefore, the register starting at $F_5$ is the most chemically and structurally sound choice.\n\n**Part 2: Mutation to Invert $P1$ Pocket Specificity**\n\nThe goal is to modify the hydrophobic $P1$ pocket to preferentially bind a positively charged residue like Lysine ($K$) or Arginine ($R$). The most rational strategy to achieve this is through electrostatic complementarity: introducing a negatively charged residue at a key position within the pocket.\n\nThe problem specifies that the HLA-DRB1*01:01 allele has a Glycine ($G$) at position $\\beta 86$, which is located at the \"floor of the pocket.\" Glycine has a minimal side chain (a single hydrogen atom), creating a deep pocket whose character is determined by the surrounding residues. To attract a positively charged side chain ($K$ or $R$), we must introduce a negative charge.\n\nThe logical mutation is to replace the small, neutral Glycine at $\\beta 86$ with a negatively charged amino acid, such as Aspartate ($D$) or Glutamate ($E$). The mutation $\\beta 86 \\ G \\rightarrow D$ places the carboxylate group ($COO^−$) of Aspartate at the bottom of the pocket, creating a strong electrostatic attraction for the ammonium group ($NH_3^+$) of Lysine or the guanidinium group of Arginine.\n\nThis single mutation is a minimal change (as requested) and is mechanistically targeted to achieve the desired outcome. It must also be restricted to the $\\beta$ chain, which it is.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **Register $5$–$13$: FDEASAVLL, with $P1= \\mathrm{F}$, $P4= \\mathrm{A}$, $P6= \\mathrm{A}$, $P9= \\mathrm{L}$. Minimal mutations: $\\beta 86 \\ \\mathrm{G} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{D}$ to introduce a negative charge at the $P1$ pocket floor, promoting Lys/Arg at $P1$.**\n-   **Register**: This is the register $F_5DEASAVLL_{13}$ identified as the most plausible in our analysis. The anchor assignment ($P1=F, P4=A, P6=A, P9=L$) is correct.\n-   **Mutations**: This proposes the single mutation $\\beta 86 \\ G \\rightarrow D$, perfectly matching our rational design.

Minimal mutations: $\\beta 57 \\ \\mathrm{D} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A}$ to relieve the conserved salt-bridge and alter pocket polarity toward charged $P1$ anchors.**\n-   **Register**: This is incorrect. Placing a negatively charged Aspartate ($D$) at $P1$ is energetically unfavorable in the deep, hydrophobic $P1$ pocket of HLA-DRB1*01:01.\n-   **Mutations**: The proposal is nonsensical. The goal is to invert specificity to favor *positive* charges, which would require *adding* a negative charge, not removing one. Furthermore, while a key Aspartate exists at $\\beta 57$ in HLA-DQ alleles, this feature is not conserved in HLA-DR in the same structural context, and its role is more related to other pockets (like $P9$) and overall complex stability. This mutation is irrelevant to engineering the $P1$ pocket as described.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nC. **Register $4$–$12$: VFDEASAVL, with $P1= \\mathrm{V}$, $P4= \\mathrm{E}$, $P6= \\mathrm{S}$, $P9= \\mathrm{L}$.

While the $\\beta 86 \\ G \\rightarrow D$ change is correct, the addition of $\\beta 81 \\ H \\rightarrow N$ makes the set non-minimal. The single $\\beta 86 \\ G \\rightarrow D$ mutation is sufficient to cause the desired specificity inversion. The problem asks for the *minimal* set.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nD. **Register $5$–$13$: FDEASAVLL, with $P1= \\mathrm{F}$, $P4= \\mathrm{A}$, $P6= \\mathrm{A}$, $P9= \\mathrm{L}$. Minimal mutations: $\\alpha 31 \\ \\mathrm{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\beta 86 \\ \\mathrm{G} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{V}$ to add polarity and decrease hydrophobicity in $P1$ for charged anchors.**\n-   **Register**: The register assignment is correct.\n-   **Mutations**: The proposed mutations are fundamentally flawed. First, the task explicitly restricts mutations to the **HLA-DR $\\beta$ chain**, but this option includes a mutation on the $\\alpha$ chain ($\\alpha 31 \\ Y \\rightarrow D$). Second, the proposed mutation on the $\\beta$ chain, $\\beta 86 \\ G \\rightarrow V$, replaces a small neutral residue with a larger hydrophobic residue. This change would *increase* the hydrophobicity of the pocket, reinforcing its original preference, not inverting it to favor charged residues.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that presents both a correct, plausible binding register and a correct, minimal, and mechanistically sound set of mutations that satisfy all constraints of the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2869318"}, {"introduction": "Beyond structural fit, the stability of an MHC-peptide complex is governed by thermodynamics, specifically the change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$) upon binding.
