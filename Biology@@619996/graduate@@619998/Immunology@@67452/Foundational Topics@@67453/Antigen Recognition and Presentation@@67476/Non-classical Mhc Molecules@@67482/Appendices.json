Consider a single-cell context in which HLA-E binds a peptide ligand at a single site with rapid equilibrium governed by the law of mass action. Let the dissociation constant be defined as $K_{d} = \\frac{[H][L]}{[HL]}$, where $[H]$ is the concentration of unbound HLA-E, $[L]$ is the concentration of free peptide, and $[HL]$ is the concentration of the HLA-E–peptide complex. Assume that the total HLA-E concentration is $[H]_{\\mathrm{T}} = [H] + [HL]$, that peptide is in large excess so that $[L]$ can be approximated by the supplied value, and that inhibitory signaling strength is proportional to the density of HLA-E–peptide complexes on the surface. Under these assumptions, inhibitory signaling strength is proportional to the fractional occupancy $f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$.\n\nYou are given three leader peptide variants with measured dissociation constants to HLA-E: $K_{d,1} = 50$ nM, $K_{d,2} = 200$ nM, and $K_{d,3} = 1000$ nM.

Do not round unless necessary; exact forms are acceptable.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a single-site biomolecular binding equilibrium, which is a fundamental concept. We must first validate the problem's premises. The problem describes a standard immunological interaction (HLA-E with leader peptides) using the law of mass action, a cornerstone of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. The data provided are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is threefold: first, to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy, $f$; second, to compute its value for three peptide variants; and third, to determine the fold-difference in inhibitory signaling between the most and least potent variants.\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is given by:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[H][L]}{[HL]}$$\nwhere $[H]$ is the concentration of unbound HLA-E, $[L]$ is the concentration of free peptide ligand, and $[HL]$ is the concentration of the HLA-E-peptide complex.\n\nThe total concentration of HLA-E, $[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}$, is conserved, such that:\n$$[H]_{\\mathrm{T}} = [H] + [HL]$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total HLA-E that is bound to the peptide:\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$$\n\nOur first goal is to derive an expression for $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$. We can rearrange the mass conservation equation to express the concentration of unbound HLA-E, $[H]$, as:\n$$[H] = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [HL]$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[H]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{([H]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [HL])[L]}{[HL]}$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for the ratio $\\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$, which is $f$.\nMultiplying both sides by $[HL]$ gives:\n$$K_{d} [HL] = ([H]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [HL])[L]$$\n$$K_{d} [HL] = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}}[L] - [HL][L]$$\n\nTo isolate terms containing $[HL]$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$K_{d} [HL] + [HL][L] = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}}[L]$$\n$$[HL](K_{d} + [L]) = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}}[L]$$\n\nFinally, to obtain the fractional occupancy $f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$, we divide both sides by $[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and by $(K_{d} + [L])$:\n$$f = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy, also known as the Langmuir binding isotherm for a single-site interaction.\n\nThe second task is to compute $f$ for the three peptide variants. The problem specifies a peptide concentration of $[L] = 500$ nM and provides the following dissociation constants:\n$K_{d,1} = 50$ nM\n$K_{d,2} = 200$ nM\n$K_{d,3} = 1000$ nM\n\nWe calculate the fractional occupancy for each variant:\nFor variant 1:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,1} + [L]} = \\frac{500}{50 + 500} = \\frac{500}{550} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\nFor variant 2:\n$$f_2 = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,2} + [L]} = \\frac{500}{200 + 500} = \\frac{500}{700} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nFor variant 3:\n$$f_3 = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,3} + [L]} = \\frac{500}{1000 + 500} = \\frac{500}{1500} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe third task is to find the fold-difference in NK inhibitory signaling between the strongest and weakest variants. The problem states that inhibitory signaling strength, which we denote $S$, is proportional to the fractional occupancy, $f$. That is, $S = c \\cdot f$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality. Since HLA-E expression is identical, $c$ is the same for all variants.\n\nStronger signaling corresponds to a higher value of $f$. We must compare the computed values of $f$:\n$f_1 = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.909$\n$f_2 = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714$\n$f_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$\n\nClearly, $f_1 > f_2 > f_3$. Therefore, variant 1 induces the strongest inhibition ($S_{strongest} = c \\cdot f_1$) and variant 3 induces the weakest inhibition ($S_{weakest} = c \\cdot f_3$). A lower $K_d$ signifies higher binding affinity, resulting in greater fractional occupancy and thus stronger signaling at a given ligand concentration.\n\nThe fold-difference is the ratio of the strongest signaling to the weakest signaling:\n$$\\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{S_{strongest}}{S_{weakest}} = \\frac{c \\cdot f_1}{c \\cdot f_3} = \\frac{f_1}{f_3}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{11}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{10}{11} \\times 3 = \\frac{30}{11}$$\n\nThis dimensionless number is the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}$$", "id": "2877534"}, {"introduction": "Unlike classical MHC molecules that are specialized for peptides, the non-classical CD1 family has evolved to present a wide array of lipid and glycolipid antigens.

MR1 is a non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-like molecule that binds small-molecule metabolites and, upon ligand binding, forms a stable complex with beta-2 microglobulin ($\\beta_2\\mathrm{m}$) that can traffic to the plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic tail of MR1 contains a canonical tyrosine-based endosomal sorting motif of the form $\\mathrm{Yxx}\\Phi$ (where $\\Phi$ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) that is recognized by Adaptor Protein complex 2 (AP-2) to mediate clathrin-dependent internalization and endosomal sorting. A mutant MR1 is engineered in which the critical tyrosine is replaced by alanine (denoted $\\mathrm{Y}\\to\\mathrm{A}$), abolishing AP-2 recognition. Cells expressing either wild-type or mutant MR1 are exposed to one of two ligands: an endosomally loaded, microbe-derived riboflavin metabolite, $L_{\\mathrm{endo}}$, which predominantly loads onto MR1 within endosomal compartments, and a cell-permeant folate-derived analog, $L_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, which can load within the early secretory pathway, including the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), independent of endosomal access. All other processes (synthesis, folding capacity, and ligand availability) are assumed unchanged by the mutation.\n\nAfter a pulse addition of ligand at time $t=0$, surface MR1 is tracked by flow cytometry, and two summary measures are computed relative to wild-type MR1: the time to half-maximal surface stabilization, $t_{1/2}$, and the maximal stabilized surface level (peak or steady state, as appropriate), $M_{\\max}$.

This can be expressed by the rate equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_{\\text{delivery}} - k_{\\text{internalization}} \\cdot M\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{delivery}}$ is the rate of arrival of stable, liganded MR1 complexes at the surface, and $k_{\\text{internalization}}$ is the rate constant for endocytosis. At steady state, $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$, the maximal surface level is $M_{\\max} = \\frac{k_{\\text{delivery}}}{k_{\\text{internalization}}}$. The time to reach half of this maximum, $t_{1/2}$, is approximately proportional to the inverse of the internalization rate, $t_{1/2} \\propto 1/k_{\\text{internalization}}$. A more precise relationship is $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{internalization}}}$.\n\nThe problem describes two key differences between the wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y $\\to$ A) MR1:\n1. The WT MR1 possesses a $\\mathrm{Yxx}\\Phi$ motif, leading to a high rate of Adaptor Protein complex 2 (AP-2)-mediated internalization ($k_{\\text{internalization, WT}}$ is large).\n2. The mutant (Y $\\to$ A) MR1 lacks this motif, so its rate of clathrin-mediated internalization is abolished ($k_{\\text{internalization, mutant}}$ is very small).\n\nWe will analyze the consequences of this mutation in the context of two different ligands.\n\n**Case 1: Ligand $L_{\\mathrm{endo}}$**\n\nThis ligand is loaded exclusively in endosomal compartments.\nFor the WT MR1, there is a continuous cycle: MR1 is synthesized, traffics to the surface, is rapidly internalized via the AP-2 pathway into endosomes, where it encounters and binds $L_{\\mathrm{endo}}$. This binding stabilizes the MR1/$\\beta_2\\mathrm{m}$ complex, allowing it to recycle to the surface and accumulate. The rate-limiting step for surface accumulation is the successful loading within the endosomal system. Since the AP-2-mediated pathway is efficient, the delivery rate of stable complexes, $k_{\\text{delivery, WT}}$, is significant, leading to a corresponding $M_{\\max}$.\n\nFor the mutant (Y $\\to$ A) MR1, the pathway for efficient internalization is blocked. MR1 molecules arriving at the surface are essentially trapped there. Their access to the endosomal compartments where $L_{\\mathrm{endo}}$ resides is severely restricted, relying only on slow, AP-2-independent mechanisms.\n- **Effect on $M_{\\max}$:** Because the mutant MR1 cannot efficiently access its stabilizing ligand, the formation of stable, surface-destined complexes is drastically reduced. The effective delivery rate, $k_{\\text{delivery, mutant}}$, is therefore much lower than for the WT. This directly leads to a significantly lower maximal surface level. Thus, $M_{\\max}$ decreases ($M_{\\max}\\,\\downarrow$).\n- **Effect on $t_{1/2}$:** The entire process of stabilization is now dependent on a very slow, inefficient internalization step. The rate of accumulation of stable complexes is severely impeded. Consequently, the time required to reach the half-maximal concentration (even though this maximum is much lower) will be substantially longer. Thus, $t_{1/2}$ increases ($t_{1/2}\\,\\uparrow$).\n\nPrediction for $L_{\\mathrm{endo}}$: For the mutant relative to WT, $t_{1/2}\\,\\uparrow$ and $M_{\\max}\\,\\downarrow$.\n\n**Case 2: Ligand $L_{\\mathrm{ER}}$**\n\nThis cell-permeant ligand loads onto MR1 within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\nFor both WT and mutant MR1, ligand binding and stabilization occur in the ER, prior to transport to the surface. The problem states that other processes like synthesis and folding are unchanged, so we conclude that the rate of delivery of stable, liganded complexes to the surface, $k_{\\text{delivery}}$, is identical for both WT and mutant MR1. The difference between the two arises only after the complexes arrive at the plasma membrane.\n\n- **Effect on $M_{\\max}$:** The maximal surface level is given by $M_{\\max} = \\frac{k_{\\text{delivery}}}{k_{\\text{internalization}}}$. For the WT, $k_{\\text{internalization, WT}}$ is large due to the functional $\\mathrm{Yxx}\\Phi$ motif. For the mutant, $k_{\\text{internalization, mutant}}$ is very small. Since $k_{\\text{delivery}}$ is the same for both, but the denominator $k_{\\text{internalization}}$ is much smaller for the mutant, the resulting $M_{\\max, \\text{mutant}}$ will be much greater than $M_{\\max, \\text{WT}}$. Thus, $M_{\\max}$ increases ($M_{\\max}\\,\\uparrow$).\n- **Effect on $t_{1/2}$:** The time to half-maximum is given by $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{internalization}}}$. This parameter is inversely proportional to the internalization rate constant. Since $k_{\\text{internalization, mutant}} \\ll k_{\\text{internalization, WT}}$, it follows directly that $t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}} \\gg t_{1/2, \\text{WT}}$. A slower removal rate means the system takes longer to approach its new, higher steady-state level.
