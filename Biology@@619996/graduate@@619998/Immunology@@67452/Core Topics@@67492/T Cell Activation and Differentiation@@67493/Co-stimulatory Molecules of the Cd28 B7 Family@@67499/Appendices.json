To ensure that the measurement probes intrinsic binding kinetics between monovalent binding sites rather than avidity or mass-transport artifacts, you plan the following experimentally realistic setup:\n- Use a Protein A/G sensor surface to capture recombinant CD86 fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, allowing oriented capture that presents the CD28 binding site.

The kinetic constants are within a realistic range for this type of transient protein-protein interaction.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe interaction between a soluble analyte, $A$ (CD28), and a surface-immobilized ligand, $L$ (CD86), to form a complex, $C$ (CD28-CD86 complex), can be represented by the single-site reversible reaction:\n$$A + L \\rightleftharpoons C$$\nThis reaction is governed by the law of mass action. The rate of formation of the complex (association) is proportional to the concentrations of the free analyte, $[A]$, and the free ligand, $[L]$. The rate constant for this process is the association rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = k_{\\text{on}} [A] [L] $$\nThe rate of breakdown of the complex (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $[C]$. The rate constant for this process is the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} = k_{\\text{off}} [C] $$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of change of the complex concentration is zero. This occurs when the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} [A]_{\\text{eq}} [L]_{\\text{eq}} = k_{\\text{off}} [C]_{\\text{eq}} $$\nwhere the subscript 'eq' denotes the concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{D}$, is defined by the concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n$$ K_{D} \\equiv \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [L]_{\\text{eq}}}{[C]_{\\text{eq}}} $$\nBy rearranging the equilibrium rate equation, we can express this ratio in terms of the kinetic rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [L]_{\\text{eq}}}{[C]_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} $$\nTherefore, the derivation concludes that the equilibrium dissociation constant is the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} $$\n\nThis derivation is valid for the specified SPR experiment because the experiment is designed to be in a **reaction-limited regime**. In SPR, the response signal, $R$, is directly proportional to the mass of analyte bound to the surface, which corresponds to the concentration of the complex, $[C]$. The rate of change of the response is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} [A] (R_{\\text{max}} - R) - k_{\\text{off}} R $$\nThis model assumes that the analyte concentration at the sensor surface is equal to the bulk analyte concentration, $[A]$, that is being flowed over the chip. This assumption holds only if the rate of mass transport (diffusion and convection) of analyte to the surface is much faster than the rate of its consumption by the binding reaction. If this condition is not met (a mass-transport limited regime), the analyte concentration at the surface would be depleted, and the observed kinetics would be convoluted with diffusion rates, leading to an inaccurate, underestimated $k_{\\text{on}}$. The experimental design explicitly mitigates this by using a low ligand density (approximately 150 RU) to reduce the rate of analyte consumption and a high flow rate ($50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) to maximize the rate of analyte replenishment at the surface. Under these reaction-limited conditions, the law of mass action applies correctly using the bulk concentration, and the measured $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ represent the intrinsic molecular kinetic parameters. Consequently, the derived relationship $K_{D} = k_{\\text{off}} / k_{\\text{on}}$ accurately reflects the thermodynamic affinity of the molecular interaction.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $K_{D}$ using the provided experimental results:\n-   $k_{\\text{on}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{5}$ $\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{off}} = 0.625$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{0.625 \\; \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.25 \\times 10^{5} \\; \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{0.625}{1.25} \\times 10^{-5} \\; \\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ K_{D} = 0.500 \\times 10^{-5} \\; \\mathrm{M} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\; \\mathrm{M} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in nanomolar (nM). We use the conversion factor $1$ $\\mathrm{M} = 10^{9}$ $\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$ K_{D} = (5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\; \\mathrm{M}) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^{9} \\; \\mathrm{nM}}{1 \\; \\mathrm{M}} \\right) $$\n$$ K_{D} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-6+9} \\; \\mathrm{nM} $$\n$$ K_{D} = 5.00 \\times 10^{3} \\; \\mathrm{nM} $$\nThe result, $5000$, is already expressed to three significant figures as $5.00 \\times 10^3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "2841897"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of the molecular binding parameters, we can now scale up to the level of the whole cell.

This exercise challenges you to translate this qualitative concept into a minimal mathematical model to make a powerful prediction: how does the T cell's dose-response curve to antigen change when CD28 signaling is removed?

The problem is formalizable and requires non-trivial reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is adjudicated to be **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nTo predict the alteration of the dose–response curve $R(A)$, we must construct a minimal biophysical model consistent with the stated principles.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Signaling Pathways:**\n    - The TCR-dependent pathway (\"signal $1$\") activates NFAT. We model its antigen-dependent activity, $S_1(A)$, as a normalized Hill function, consistent with the problem description:\n      $$S_1(A) = \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h}$$\n      where $h$ is the Hill coefficient of the TCR signaling module and $K_T$ is its half-saturation constant. $S_1(A)$ varies between $0$ and $1$.\n\n    - The AP-$1$/NF-κB activity, which we denote $S_2(A)$, is supplied by two sources: a strong, primary contribution from CD$28$ and a weak contribution from the TCR itself.\n        - The CD$28$ contribution is constant because the B$7$ ligand density is \"fixed, saturating\". Let us denote this constant positive term as $C$.\n        - The weak TCR-dependent contribution to $S_2$ can be modeled as being proportional to the primary TCR signal, $S_1(A)$, with a small proportionality constant $\\epsilon \\ll C$.\n        - Therefore, the total AP-$1$/NF-κB activity is:\n          $$S_2(A) = C + \\epsilon S_1(A) = C + \\epsilon \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h}$$\n\n2.  **Modeling Signal Integration:**\n    - The IL-$2$ promoter logic is described as \"conjunctive promoter logic\" and \"synergistic, AND-like integration\". The simplest mathematical representation of such an AND-gate is a multiplicative model, where the final response $R(A)$ is proportional to the product of the activities of the necessary transcription factor groups (NFAT, driven by $S_1$, and AP-$1$/NF-κB, represented by $S_2$).\n      $$R(A) = k \\cdot S_1(A) \\cdot S_2(A)$$\n      where $k$ is a scaling constant.\n\n3.  **Formulating Response Functions for Both Conditions:**\n    - **Wild-Type (WT):** With intact CD$28$ signaling, $C > 0$. The response is:\n      $$R_{\\text{WT}}(A) = k \\left( \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right) \\left( C + \\epsilon \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right)$$\n    - **CD$28$-deficient (-/-):** With CD$28$ signaling removed, the constant contribution $C$ becomes zero. The response is:\n      $$R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = k \\left( \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right) \\left( 0 + \\epsilon \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right) = k \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right)^2$$\n\n4.  **Comparing Dose-Response Curve Characteristics:**\n    Let us denote the normalized Hill function $S_1(A)$ as $x(A)$ for simplicity.\n    $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) = kC \\cdot x(A) + k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2$\n    $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2$\n\n    -   **Maximal Response ($R_{\\text{max}}$):** This is the limit as $A \\to \\infty$, where $x(A) \\to 1$.\n        $R_{\\text{max, WT}} = kC \\cdot 1 + k\\epsilon \\cdot 1^2 = k(C+\\epsilon)$\n        $R_{\\text{max, -/-}} = k\\epsilon \\cdot 1^2 = k\\epsilon$\n        Since $C > 0$, it is unambiguous that $R_{\\text{max, -/-}} < R_{\\text{max, WT}}$. The maximal response is reduced.\n\n    -   **Half-Maximal Concentration ($EC_{50}$):** This is the concentration $A$ where the response is $R_{max}/2$.\n        For the -/- case: $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\text{max, -/-}} \\implies k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k\\epsilon \\implies x(A) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n        For the WT case: $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\text{max, WT}} \\implies kC \\cdot x(A) + k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(C+\\epsilon)$. Since $C \\gg \\epsilon$, the $x(A)^2$ term is small compared to the $C \\cdot x(A)$ term around the midpoint. Thus, $kC \\cdot x(A) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}kC$, which implies $x(A) \\approx 1/2$.\n        To reach the half-maximal response, the required TCR signal level is higher in the -/- case ($x(A) = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$) than in the WT case ($x(A) \\approx 0.5$). Since $x(A)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $A$, this means $EC_{50, \\text{-/-}} > EC_{50, \\text{WT}}$. The dose-response curve shifts to the right.\n\n    -   **Apparent Hill Slope (Cooperativity):** The slope of the dose-response reflects its cooperativity. We can examine the behavior at low antigen concentrations where $A \\ll K_T$, so $x(A) \\approx (A/K_T)^h$.\n        $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) \\approx kC(A/K_T)^h + k\\epsilon(A/K_T)^{2h}$. As $C \\gg \\epsilon$, the response is dominated by the first term: $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) \\propto A^h$. The apparent cooperativity is close to $h$.\n        $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = k\\epsilon \\left( (A/K_T)^h \\right)^2 = k\\epsilon (A/K_T)^{2h}$. Here, $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) \\propto A^{2h}$. The apparent cooperativity is close to $2h$.\n        Since $2h > h$ (for $h>0$), the dose-response curve for the CD$28$-/- condition is more cooperative, meaning it has a steeper apparent Hill slope than the WT curve. The WT response is \"linearized\" by the large, constant CD$28$-dependent signal $C$, which adds a quasi-linear term in $x(A)$ that dominates the response shape. Loss of this term unmasks a higher-order, more cooperative response.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:** Removing CD$28$ signaling causes:\n1.  A decrease in the maximal response.\n2.  An increase in the $EC_{50}$ (a rightward shift).\n3.  An increase in the apparent Hill slope (a steeper curve).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The dose–response shifts rightward (higher $EC_{50}$), the maximal response is reduced, and the apparent Hill slope (cooperativity) becomes steeper due to loss of a CD28-dependent quasi-linear term in the conjunctive promoter drive.**\n    - This option claims a rightward shift, reduced maximum, and steeper slope. This precisely matches all three predictions from our model. The provided reason, \"loss of a CD28-dependent quasi-linear term\", perfectly describes the mechanism in our model, where the $kC \\cdot x(A)$ term is lost upon CD$28$ removal, making the response steeper.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The dose–response shifts leftward (lower $EC_{50}$) and the maximal response increases because TCR signaling compensates multiplicatively when CD28 is absent.**\n    - This predicts a leftward shift and increased maximum. Both are contrary to our derivation and established immunological findings.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Only vertical rescaling occurs: the maximal response decreases but $EC_{50}$ and slope are unchanged because co-stimulation is a pure gain factor on a fixed TCR curve.**\n    - This describes a model where $R(A) = G \\cdot S_1(A)$. This predicts no change in $EC_{50}$ or slope, which contradicts our model reflecting synergistic AND-like logic.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Only a horizontal shift occurs: $EC_{50}$ increases, but the maximal response and slope are unchanged because co-stimulation alters sensitivity but not efficacy.**\n    - This describes a model where $R(A) \\propto S_1(A, K_{eff})$ with CD$28$ altering $K_{eff}$. This predicts no change in maximum response, which is incorrect.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. The dose–response shifts rightward and the maximal response is reduced, but the apparent Hill slope becomes shallower because the synergistic nonlinearity is lost with CD28 blockade.**\n    - This option correctly identifies the rightward shift and reduced maximum. However, it incorrectly claims the slope becomes shallower. As derived, the slope becomes steeper. The reasoning provided (\"synergistic nonlinearity is lost\") is conceptually flawed within the context of the multiplicative model; the synergy in the WT case makes the response *less* steep (more linear with respect to the transduced signal $x(A)$) than the purely quadratic -/- case.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2841941"}, {"introduction": "Conceptual models, like the one developed in the previous exercise, become truly powerful when they are connected to experimental data.

First, we must formalize the model with the provided parameters.\n\nThe normalized Interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion rate is given by the model:\n$$\nI(L_{\\mathrm{T}},L_{\\mathrm{C}}) = I_{\\max}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{TCR}}(L_{\\mathrm{T}})\\,\\big(\\varepsilon + \\alpha\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}})\\big)\n$$\nwhere the fractional occupancies follow Langmuir binding isotherms:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{TCR}}(L_{\\mathrm{T}}) = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{T}}}{L_{\\mathrm{T}} + K_{d,\\mathrm{TCR}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}}) = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{C}}}{L_{\\mathrm{C}} + K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the following constant values:\n$I_{\\max} = 1$\n$L_{\\mathrm{T}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{TCR}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fractional occupancy of the T cell receptor (TCR), which is constant throughout the experiment:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{TCR}} = \\frac{20}{20 + 10} = \\frac{20}{30} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $I_{\\max}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{TCR}}$ into the secretion model simplifies the expression to depend only on $L_{\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$\nI(L_{\\mathrm{C}}) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\left(\\varepsilon + \\alpha\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}})\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon + \\frac{2}{3}\\alpha\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}})\n$$\nThis equation is a linear model relating $I(L_{\\mathrm{C}})$ to $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}})$. The intercept of this model corresponds to the case where $L_{\\mathrm{C}}=0$, for which $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(0) = 0$. The intercept is therefore $I(0) = \\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe problem states that the intercept is constrained to match the observation at $L_{\\mathrm{C}}=0$. The data provide that for $L_{\\mathrm{C}}=0$, the observed secretion rate is $I_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.1000$. Let us denote this intercept value as $I_0$.\n$$\nI_0 = I(L_{\\mathrm{C}}=0) = I_{\\mathrm{obs}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}}=0) = 0.1000\n$$\nWith this constraint, we can rearrange the model to isolate the term containing $\\alpha$. Let's subtract the intercept from both sides:\n$$\nI(L_{\\mathrm{C}}) - I_0 = \\frac{2}{3}\\alpha\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C}})\n$$\nThis transformed model is a linear relationship that passes through the origin. We must estimate $\\alpha$ using ordinary least squares. Let us define a new set of variables for the regression:\nThe dependent variable is $y_i = I_{\\mathrm{obs},i} - I_0$.\nThe independent variable is $x_i = \\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(L_{\\mathrm{C},i})$.\nThe model to be fitted is $y_i = \\beta x_i$, where the slope $\\beta$ is a composite parameter given by $\\beta = \\frac{2}{3}\\alpha$.\n\nThe OLS estimator for the slope of a regression through the origin, $\\hat{\\beta}$, minimizes the sum of squared residuals $S = \\sum_i (y_i - \\beta x_i)^2$. The solution is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i y_i}{\\sum_i x_i^2}\n$$\nOnce $\\hat{\\beta}$ is determined, the estimator for $\\alpha$ is found by inverting the relationship $\\beta = \\frac{2}{3}\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{3}{2}\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_i x_i y_i}{\\sum_i x_i^2}\n$$\nThe summation is over the data points for which $L_{\\mathrm{C}} > 0$. We have three such points.\n\nLet us compute the values for $x_i$ and $y_i$ for each of these points.\nPoint 1: $L_{\\mathrm{C},1} = 4\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $I_{\\mathrm{obs},1} = 0.4000$\n$x_1 = \\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(4) = \\frac{4}{4 + 4} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$y_1 = 0.4000 - 0.1000 = 0.3000 = \\frac{3}{10}$\n\nPoint 2: $L_{\\mathrm{C},2} = 8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $I_{\\mathrm{obs},2} = 0.5000$\n$x_2 = \\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(8) = \\frac{8}{8 + 4} = \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$y_2 = 0.5000 - 0.1000 = 0.4000 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nPoint 3: $L_{\\mathrm{C},3} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $I_{\\mathrm{obs},3} = 0.6000$\n$x_3 = \\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}(20) = \\frac{20}{20 + 4} = \\frac{20}{24} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n$y_3 = 0.6000 - 0.1000 = 0.5000 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, we compute the necessary sums, using fractions for precision.\nThe sum of products $\\sum_i x_i y_i$:\n$$\n\\sum_i x_i y_i = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{4}{15} + \\frac{5}{12}\n$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $60$:\n$$\n\\sum_i x_i y_i = \\frac{3 \\cdot 3}{60} + \\frac{4 \\cdot 4}{60} + \\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{60} = \\frac{9 + 16 + 25}{60} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\nThe sum of squares $\\sum_i x_i^2$:\n$$\n\\sum_i x_i^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{25}{36}\n$$\nThe common denominator is $36$:\n$$\n\\sum_i x_i^2 = \\frac{9}{36} + \\frac{16}{36} + \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{9 + 16 + 25}{36} = \\frac{50}{36} = \\frac{25}{18}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i y_i}{\\sum_i x_i^2} = \\frac{5/6}{25/18} = \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{18}{25} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 18}{6 \\cdot 25} = \\frac{90}{150} = \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n$$\nFinally, we compute the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{3}{2}\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9\n$$\nThis is an exact value.
