A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Error Ratio**\nLet us consider a single step in the sequence of $N$ phosphorylation events. At any intermediate state before the final step, two mutually exclusive events can occur: a successful phosphorylation step with rate $k_p$, or dissociation of the TCR-pMHC bond with rate $k_{\\text{off}}(f)$. Since an event occurring at a constant rate is a Poisson process, the time until that event occurs is exponentially distributed.\n\nLet $\\tau_p$ be the waiting time for a phosphorylation event and $\\tau_{\\text{off}}$ be the waiting time for unbinding. The probability that the next event is a phosphorylation step is the probability that $\\tau_p < \\tau_{\\text{off}}$. For two competing independent exponential processes with rates $k_p$ and $k_{\\text{off}}(f)$, this probability is given by the ratio of the rates:\n$$P_{\\text{step success}} = \\frac{k_p}{k_p + k_{\\text{off}}(f)}$$\nFor the T cell to be activated, all $N$ sequential phosphorylation steps must occur before the bond dissociates. Since each step is identical and the processes are memoryless (Markov property), the total probability of successful activation, $P_{\\text{success}}$, is the product of the probabilities of success for each of the $N$ steps:\n$$P_{\\text{success}}(f) = \\left( \\frac{k_p}{k_p + k_{\\text{off}}(f)} \\right)^N$$\nThe problem specifies that we are in the strong proofreading regime, where the unbinding rate is much larger than the phosphorylation rate, i.e., $k_{\\text{off}}(f) \\gg k_p$. This allows for a simplification of the denominator: $k_p + k_{\\text{off}}(f) \\approx k_{\\text{off}}(f)$. The success probability can therefore be approximated as:\n$$P_{\\text{success}}(f) \\approx \\left( \\frac{k_p}{k_{\\text{off}}(f)} \\right)^N$$\nThis expression shows that for a high-fidelity system, the success probability is low, but the specificity is enhanced.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of erroneous activation (by a noncognate ligand, nc) to correct activation (by a cognate ligand, cog). This ratio is:\n$$\\text{Error Ratio} = \\frac{P_{\\text{success}}^{\\text{nc}}(f)}{P_{\\text{success}}^{\\text{cog}}(f)} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{k_p}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{nc}}(f)} \\right)^N}{\\left( \\frac{k_p}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{cog}}(f)} \\right)^N}$$\nThe intracellular phosphorylation rate $k_p$ and the number of steps $N$ are intrinsic to the T cell's signaling machinery and are assumed to be independent of the ligand identity. Thus, the terms involving $k_p$ and the exponent $N$ can be rearranged:\n$$\\text{Error Ratio} = \\frac{(k_p)^N}{(k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{nc}}(f))^N} \\cdot \\frac{(k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{cog}}(f))^N}{(k_p)^N} = \\frac{(k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{cog}}(f))^N}{(k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{nc}}(f))^N}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the error ratio, which depends only on the quantities requested:\n$$\\text{Error Ratio} = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{cog}}(f)}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{nc}}(f)} \\right)^N$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this ratio using the provided parameters for $f = 10\\,\\text{pN}$, $N = 3$, and $k_B T = 4.114\\,\\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the exponent arguments for the rate models.
