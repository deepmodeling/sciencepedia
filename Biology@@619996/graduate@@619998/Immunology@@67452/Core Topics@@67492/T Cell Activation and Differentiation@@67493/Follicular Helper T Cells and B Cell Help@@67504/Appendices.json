Do not use a percent sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the frequency of a specific subset of T lymphocytes, known as T follicular helper ($T_{fh}$) cells, within the total $CD4^{+}$ T cell population. The analysis is based on a sequential gating strategy from flow cytometry data, which mathematically translates to a chain of conditional probabilities. The problem is well-posed and grounded in correct biological and mathematical principles.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the problem using the language of probability theory. The overarching population is the set of $CD4^{+}$ T cells, so all probabilities are conditional on a cell being $CD4^{+}$. We define the following events for a randomly selected cell from this population:\n- Let $E_1$ be the event that the cell is $CXCR5^{+}$.\n- Let $E_2$ be the event that the cell is $PD-1^{\\text{high}}$.\n- Let $E_3$ be the event that the cell is $ICOS}^{+}$.\n- Let $E_4$ be the event that the cell is $CCR7^{\\text{low}}$.\n\nThe problem operationally defines a $T_{fh}$ cell within the $CD4^{+}$ gate as a cell satisfying all these criteria. The objective is to compute the probability of the intersection of these events, which we denote as $P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3 \\cap E_4)$.\n\nThe provided experimental data are given as a sequence of conditional frequencies. We translate these into conditional probabilities, noting that the conditioning on $CD4^{+}$ is implicit in the setup.\n1. The fraction of $CXCR5^{+}$ cells among $CD4^{+}$ T cells is $20\\%$. This is the probability of the first event in our sequence:\n$$P(E_1) = 0.20$$\n2. The fraction of $PD-1^{\\text{high}}$ cells among $CXCR5^{+} CD4^{+}$ T cells is $60\\%$. This is a conditional probability, representing the second step in the gating hierarchy:\n$$P(E_2 | E_1) = 0.60$$\n3. The fraction of $ICOS^{+}$ cells among $PD-1^{\\text{high}} CXCR5^{+} CD4^{+}$ T cells is $75\\%$. This is the next conditional probability in the sequence:\n$$P(E_3 | E_1 \\cap E_2) = 0.75$$\n4. The fraction of $CCR7^{\\text{low}}$ cells among $ICOS^{+} PD-1^{\\text{high}} CXCR5^{+} CD4^{+}$ T cells is $80\\%$. This is the final conditional probability:\n$$P(E_4 | E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3) = 0.80$$\n\nThe problem assumes \"the stated conditional frequencies hold along the specified gating sequence.\" This structure mandates the use of the chain rule of probability to find the joint probability of the intersection of these events. The chain rule states:\n$$P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3 \\cap E_4) = P(E_1) \\times P(E_2 | E_1) \\times P(E_3 | E_1 \\cap E_2) \\times P(E_4 | E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3)$$\n\nAttention must be paid to the first given data point: \"Among $CD4^{+}$ T cells, the fraction that is $CCR7^{\\text{high}}$ is $40\\%$.\" This implies that the marginal probability of a $CD4^{+}$ cell being $CCR7^{\\text{low}}$ is $P(E_4) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$. This information is extraneous to the calculation required by the sequential gating logic. The sequential model explicitly provides the *conditional* probability $P(E_4 | E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3) = 0.80$, which is the correct value to use in the chain rule. The marginal probability is irrelevant to the specified path of analysis and must be disregarded.\n\nWe now proceed with the calculation by substituting the given conditional probabilities into the chain rule formula:\n$$P(T_{fh} \\text{ among } CD4^{+}) = 0.20 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.80$$\n\nTo execute the multiplication in a systematic manner:\nFirst, we compute the product of the first two terms:\n$$0.20 \\times 0.60 = 0.12$$\nNext, we multiply this result by the third term. It is efficient to use fractional representation for $0.75$:\n$$0.12 \\times 0.75 = 0.12 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 0.03 \\times 3 = 0.09$$\nFinally, we multiply this intermediate result by the last term:\n$$0.09 \\times 0.80 = 0.072$$\n\nThus, the expected frequency of the T follicular helper cell gate, as defined by the phenotype $CD4^{+} CXCR5^{+} PD-1^{\\text{high}} ICOS^{+} CCR7^{\\text{low}}$, among the total $CD4^{+}$ T cell population is $0.072$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.072}\n$$", "id": "2849252"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have considered how to count Tfh cells, we turn to their cardinal function: orchestrating the selection of high-affinity B cells within the germinal center. This process hinges on a fierce competition for a limited amount of Tfh-derived help. This exercise challenges you to articulate the fundamental logic of this competition, focusing on how a B cell's ability to efficiently capture and present a specific antigen is the decisive factor for its survival and selection [@problem_id:2849280].", "problem": "In a germinal center light zone, two B cell clones, $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$, coexist. Clone $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ expresses a B cell receptor (BCR) that binds a foreign protein antigen retained on follicular dendritic cells, while clone $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$ has an irrelevant BCR. Both clones internalize ambient proteins and display abundant self-derived peptide–major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII) on their surface. A pool of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells carries T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for a peptide derived from the foreign antigen bound by $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$.

Antigen-specific B cells monopolize antigen on follicular dendritic cells, but Tfh help in the germinal center is distributed randomly among nearby B cells, making peptide–MHC class II specificity unnecessary for receiving help.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   A germinal center light zone contains two B cell clones, $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$.\n-   Clone $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ has a B cell receptor (BCR) specific for a foreign protein antigen on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).\n-   Clone $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$ has an irrelevant BCR.\n-   Both clones internalize ambient proteins and display abundant self-derived peptide–major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII).\n-   A pool of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells is present.\n-   The Tfh cells possess T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for a peptide derived from the foreign antigen.\n-   Tfh cell help is delivered via contact-dependent interactions and cytokine secretion.\n-   The delivery of help is dependent on TCR engagement with the cognate pMHCII.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing the canonical mechanism of B cell selection within a germinal center. It is well-posed, providing a clear scenario and asking for a justification of a known immunological outcome. All terms are standard and their roles are defined consistently with established principles of immunology. The setup is self-contained and does not contain contradictions or factual errors. The conditions described are not physically impossible or scientifically implausible; they represent a classic model for studying adaptive immunity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe central principle governing the competition between B cells in a germinal center is the efficiency with which they can acquire antigen, process it, and present it to Tfh cells to receive survival signals. The quantity and quality of Tfh help are limited, thus creating a competitive environment where only the most \"fit\" B cells are selected.\n\n$1$. **Antigen Acquisition**: The B cell receptor (BCR) is the primary tool for antigen acquisition from the surface of follicular dendritic cells. The clone $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ possesses a BCR that specifically recognizes and binds the foreign antigen. This specific binding triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis, an extremely efficient mechanism for internalizing large quantities of the specific antigen. In contrast, the clone $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$ has an irrelevant BCR and cannot specifically bind this antigen. It can only internalize antigen from the surrounding fluid via non-specific mechanisms like macropinocytosis, which is orders of magnitude less efficient than BCR-mediated uptake.\n\n$2$. **Antigen Processing and Presentation**: Once internalized, the foreign protein antigen is proteolytically cleaved into peptides within the endosomal compartments of the B cell. These peptides are then loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHCII) molecules. The resulting peptide-MHCII (pMHCII) complexes are transported to the cell surface for presentation.\n\nBecause $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ internalizes a large amount of the foreign antigen, it will generate a high surface density of pMHCII complexes displaying the specific foreign peptide. $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$, having internalized very little, if any, of the foreign antigen, will display a negligible density of the relevant foreign pMHCII. As stated, both clones display abundant self-derived pMHCII, but these are irrelevant to the specific Tfh cells in this scenario.\n\n$3$. **Tfh Cell Recognition and Activation**: The Tfh cells are defined as having T cell receptors (TCRs) that are specific for the foreign peptide presented on MHCII. When a Tfh cell scans the surfaces of B cells, it requires engagement of its TCR with the cognate pMHCII to form a stable immunological synapse and become activated to deliver help.\n\n$4$. **Competitive Outcome**: The high density of cognate pMHCII on the surface of $B_{\\mathrm{Ag}}$ cells allows them to effectively engage the specific Tfh cells, form stable synapses, and receive the necessary contact-dependent (e.g., CD40-CD40L) and cytokine-mediated signals for survival and proliferation. The $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$ cells, lacking the cognate pMHCII, cannot form such stable interactions with the Tfh cells. The self-peptides they present do not engage the foreign-peptide-specific TCRs. Consequently, $B_{\\mathrm{Ns}}$ cells fail to receive Tfh help and are eliminated via apoptosis. This process ensures that only B cells with high-affinity, specific BCRs are selected to differentiate further.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Antigen-specific B cells concentrate the foreign antigen through BCR-mediated endocytosis, generating a high density of cognate peptide–MHC class II; Tfh TCRs recognize only these cognate complexes, sustaining stable contacts and preferentially delivering help to those B cells, whereas self-derived peptide–MHC class II on non-specific B cells does not engage the TCRs.**\nThis statement provides a complete and accurate description of the mechanism. It correctly identifies BCR-mediated antigen concentration as the key initial step, links this to the high-density presentation of cognate pMHCII, and correctly describes the specificity of TCR recognition leading to preferential help delivery. It also correctly states that self-pMHCII on non-specific cells is not a substrate for recognition by these Tfh cells.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Non-specific B cells receive equivalent help because Tfh cells respond to any peptide–MHC class II regardless of peptide sequence, relying primarily on the total surface density of MHC class II and adhesion molecules.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. TCR recognition is exquisitely specific for the combination of a particular peptide and a particular MHC molecule. The problem statement itself refutes this by specifying that help *depends on TCR engagement with cognate peptide–MHC class II*. If Tfh-cell help were promiscuous, there would be no basis for antigen-specific B cell selection.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Antigen-specific B cells inherently express higher basal levels of MHC class II, so they present more self peptides and thereby attract Tfh cells even without foreign antigen capture.**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. First, there is no established principle that antigen-specific B cells have inherently higher basal MHCII levels. Second, and more critically, the Tfh cells are specific for a *foreign* peptide. Presenting more *self* peptides would be completely ineffective at engaging these Tfh cells. The signal for help is the cognate foreign peptide.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Non-specific B cells are compensated by bystander cytokines secreted diffusely by Tfh cells, so competition for help does not require cognate peptide recognition at the T cell receptor.**\nThis is incorrect. While some bystander effects may exist, Tfh help is known to be delivered in a highly directed manner within the immunological synapse. Crucial contact-dependent signals (like CD40L) are not diffuse. Polarized cytokine secretion ensures that help is delivered specifically to the B cell that provided the TCR stimulus. If diffuse bystander help were sufficient, the stringent selection process of the germinal center would fail.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Antigen-specific B cells monopolize antigen on follicular dendritic cells, but Tfh help in the germinal center is distributed randomly among nearby B cells, making peptide–MHC class II specificity unnecessary for receiving help.**\nThis statement is internally contradictory. The first part, regarding antigen monopolization, is correct. However, the conclusion that Tfh help is distributed randomly is incorrect and counteracts the very purpose of the germinal center reaction. Tfh help is precisely targeted to B cells presenting the correct antigen, which is the cornerstone of affinity maturation. Random help distribution would obviate the need for specific antigen presentation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2849280"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of single-cell competition, our final practice scales up to the population level to explore the dynamics of clonal selection over time.

It is a well-posed, scientifically-grounded problem that formalizes principles of clonal selection in immunology into a deterministic computational model. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The task is to compute a specific metric based on the provided discrete-time dynamical system. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe model describes the evolution of frequencies $p_i(t)$ of $K$ competing B cell clones. We are given $K=4$ clones, with initial frequencies $p_i(0) = 1/4$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Each clone $i$ has a fixed affinity $a_i > 0$. The simulation runs for $T=5$ time steps.\n\nThe dynamics are governed by the following equations. First, the Tfh help $h_i(t)$ received by clone $i$ at time $t$ is competitively allocated:\n$$\nh_i(t) = \\frac{a_i^\\eta p_i(t)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} a_j^\\eta p_j(t)}\n$$\nwhere the parameter $\\eta=1.0$ controls the influence of affinity on help capture. Since $\\sum_{i=1}^K p_i(t) = 1$, if we set $\\eta=0$, help is proportional to frequency. With $\\eta=1.0$, higher affinity clones have a disproportional advantage in capturing help.\n\nSecond, the fitness $F_i(t)$ of clone $i$ is a function of its intrinsic affinity $a_i$ and the captured help $h_i(t)$:\n$$\nF_i(t) = a_i^\\gamma \\, h_i(t)^\\delta\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma \\ge 0$ and $\\delta \\ge 0$ are parameters that determine the relative contributions of intrinsic affinity and acquired help to the selection process. A value of $\\delta > 0$ introduces frequency-dependent selection, as $h_i(t)$ depends on $p_i(t)$.\n\nThird, the clone frequencies are updated in each round according to the standard replicator equation, which normalizes the population after selection:\n$$\np_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t) \\, F_i(t)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} p_j(t) \\, F_j(t)}\n$$\n\nFor computational implementation, it is efficient to derive a simplified, single-step recurrence relation for $p_i(t+1)$. We substitute the expressions for $h_i(t)$ and $F_i(t)$ into the update rule:\n$$\np_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t) \\left( a_i^\\gamma \\left( \\frac{a_i^\\eta p_i(t)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k^\\eta p_k(t)} \\right)^\\delta \\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} p_j(t) \\left( a_j^\\gamma \\left( \\frac{a_j^\\eta p_j(t)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k^\\eta p_k(t)} \\right)^\\delta \\right)}\n$$\nThe term $(\\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k^\\eta p_k(t))^{-\\delta}$ is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels. This leads to the simplified recurrence:\n$$\np_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t) a_i^\\gamma a_i^{\\eta\\delta} p_i(t)^\\delta}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} p_j(t) a_j^\\gamma a_j^{\\eta\\delta} p_j(t)^\\delta} = \\frac{a_i^{\\gamma + \\eta\\delta} p_i(t)^{1+\\delta}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} a_j^{\\gamma + \\eta\\delta} p_j(t)^{1+\\delta}}\n$$\nThis form connects the frequencies at time $t+1$ directly to the frequencies at time $t$ and the fixed parameters, avoiding the explicit calculation of intermediate quantities $h_i(t)$ and $F_i(t)$ in each step. This is the relation we will implement.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to find the Simpson concentration $S$ for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the parameters for the specific case: the affinity vector $\\mathbf{a}$, and the exponents $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$. The values $K=4$, $T=5$, and $\\eta=1.0$ are fixed.\n2.  Initialize the frequency vector $p(0)$ as a uniform distribution: $p_i(0) = 1/4$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.  Iterate the simplified recurrence relation for $t$ from $0$ to $T-1=4$. In each iteration, the vector $p(t)$ is used to compute $p(t+1)$.\n4.  After $T=5$ rounds, the final frequency distribution $p(T)$ is obtained.\n5.  Compute the Simpson concentration $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i(T)^2$.\n\nAnalysis of special cases provides a verification of the model's logic.\n- Case 5: $(\\gamma, \\delta, \\mathbf{a}) = (0.0, 0.0, \\mathbf{a}^{(1)})$. The exponents in the simplified recurrence become $\\gamma+\\eta\\delta=0$ and $1+\\delta=1$. The update rule is $p_i(t+1) = \\frac{a_i^0 p_i(t)^1}{\\sum_j a_j^0 p_j(t)^1} = \\frac{p_i(t)}{\\sum_j p_j(t)} = p_i(t)$, since $\\sum_j p_j(t)=1$. The frequencies do not change from their initial state. Thus, $p_i(T) = p_i(0) = 1/4$ for all $i$. The Simpson concentration is $S = \\sum_{i=1}^4 (1/4)^2 = 4 \\times (1/16) = 1/4 = 0.25$.\n- Case 6: $(\\gamma, \\delta, \\mathbf{a}) = (1.0, 1.0, \\mathbf{a}^{(2)})$. Here, the affinities are homogeneous: $a_i = 1.0$ for all $i$. The term $a_i^{\\gamma+\\eta\\delta}$ is equal to $1.0^{\\gamma+\\eta\\delta}=1.0$ for all clones and can be factored out of the summation and cancelled. The update rule simplifies to $p_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t)^{1+\\delta}}{\\sum_j p_j(t)^{1+\\delta}}$. Because all clones start with identical frequencies $p_i(0)=1/4$, they will evolve identically. Frequencies remain uniform at $1/4$ throughout the simulation. Therefore, $S = 0.25$ for this case as well.\n\nThese analytical results for cases $5$ and $6$ serve as a baseline against which the results of selection under heterogeneous affinities can be compared.
