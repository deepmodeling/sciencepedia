This practice invites you to step into the role of an experimental immunologist to dissect the signaling hierarchy that governs this process. By analyzing a hypothetical experiment, you will explore the distinct and crucial roles of the initiating cytokine Interleukin-12 (IL-12) versus the amplifying cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$) in establishing a stable and functional Th1 phenotype [@problem_id:2895728].", "problem": "A research group cultures naive mouse $CD4^+$ T cells from a monoclonal T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic line with antigen-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) under otherwise neutral conditions. They compare three conditions that differ only during the initial priming interval of $48$ hours: (i) isotype control antibody, (ii) neutralizing antibody to Interleukin-12 (IL-12), and (iii) neutralizing antibody to Interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$). After $48$ hours, all antibody and cytokines are washed out, and the cells are rested without exogenous cytokines. On day $5$, the cells are restimulated with plate-bound anti-CD$3$ in the absence of polarizing cytokines. The group assesses: (a) the fraction of cells producing IFN-$\\gamma$ by intracellular staining, (b) the per-cell level of T-box transcription factor T-bet (encoded by *Tbx21*), and (c) qualitative chromatin marks at the *Ifng* locus (presence of activating H$3$K$4$me$3$ and loss of repressive H$3$K$27$me$3$).\n\nUsing only well-established principles of helper T cell differentiation, predict the comparative effects of blocking IL-12 versus blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ during the initial priming on both the magnitude and the stability of T helper $1$ (Th$1$) polarization at restimulation.

Blocking IL-12 during priming yields a marked reduction in Th$1$ magnitude (fewer IFN-$\\gamma$ producers and lower T-bet) and weak Th$1$ stability (diminished H$3$K$4$me$3$ and persistence of H$3$K$27$me$3$ at Ifng), whereas blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ causes only a modest reduction in initial magnitude but preserves stable Th$1$ imprinting because IL-12/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription $4$ (STAT$4$) signaling remains intact.\n\nB.

Blocking IL-12 during priming converts cells by default into T helper $2$ (Th$2$) cells, while blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ paradoxically increases Th$1$ stability due to removal of negative feedback through interferon-regulatory pathways.", "solution": "The problem statement describes a classical in vitro experiment to dissect the roles of Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$) in the differentiation and memory of T helper $1$ (Th$1$) cells. The statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and uses standard immunological terminology and experimental design. It is therefore valid for analysis.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the hierarchical signaling network that governs Th$1$ commitment. This process is initiated by antigen-presenting cells, here dendritic cells (DCs), which produce IL-12 upon activation. The subsequent signaling cascade within the naive $CD4^+$ T cell dictates its differentiation trajectory.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Th$1$ Differentiation:**\n\n$1$. **Initiation via IL-12/STAT$4$ Axis**: IL-12, produced by DCs, binds to the IL-12 receptor on the T cell. This action triggers the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor STAT$4$ (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription $4$). Activated pSTAT$4$ moves to the nucleus and serves two primary functions:\n    a. It directly binds to the promoter regions of both the *Tbx21* gene (which encodes the master regulator T-box transcription factor T-bet) and the *Ifng* gene (which encodes IFN-$\\gamma$), initiating their transcription.\n    b. This IL-12/STAT$4$ pathway is the cardinal, lineage-defining signal for Th$1$ differentiation. Without it, the entire program fails to launch effectively.\n\n$2$. **Amplification via IFN-$\\gamma$/STAT$1$ Axis**: The IFN-$\\gamma$ produced initially (under the control of STAT$4$) acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner. It binds to the IFN-$\\gamma$ receptor on T cells, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT$1$. Activated pSTAT$1$ also translocates to the nucleus where it potently enhances the expression of T-bet. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop: IL-12 $\\rightarrow$ STAT$4$ $\\rightarrow$ initial T-bet/IFN-$\\gamma$ $\\rightarrow$ STAT$1$ $\\rightarrow$ amplified T-bet $\\rightarrow$ robust IFN-$\\gamma$ production.\n\n$3$. **Commitment and Stability via T-bet**: T-bet is the master regulator. Once its expression reaches a high threshold, driven by both STAT$4$ and STAT$1$, it orchestrates the complete Th$1$ phenotype. Critically for this problem, T-bet remodels the chromatin structure at key gene loci.\n    a. At the *Ifng* locus, T-bet recruits histone methyltransferases that deposit activating epigenetic marks, such as trimethylation of lysine $4$ on histone $3$ (H$3$K$4$me$3$).\n    b. Simultaneously, it recruits histone demethylases that remove repressive marks, such as trimethylation of lysine $27$ on histone $3$ (H$3$K$27$me$3$).\n    c. This epigenetic remodeling renders the *Ifng* locus 'open' and transcriptionally permissive. This state is heritable through cell division and is the molecular basis for the *stability* of the Th$1$ lineage. A cell with such an epigenetically modified *Ifng* locus is considered \"committed\" and will rapidly produce IFN-$\\gamma$ upon restimulation, even in the absence of the original polarizing cytokines (IL-12).\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Conditions:**\n\n*   **Condition (i) - Isotype control**: This is the positive control where the full pathway proceeds as described above, resulting in high magnitude (many IFN-$\\gamma$ producers, high T-bet) and stable commitment (presence of H$3$K$4$me$3$ and absence of H$3$K$27$me$3$ at the *Ifng* locus).\n\n*   **Condition (ii) - Neutralizing antibody to IL-12**: Blocking IL-12 severs the pathway at its origin. The STAT$4$ signal is abrogated. Consequently, there is no primary induction of T-bet or initial IFN-$\\gamma$. The IFN-$\\gamma$/STAT$1$ amplification loop cannot start. T-bet levels will remain minimal. Without sufficient T-bet, the epigenetic remodeling required for stability will not occur.\n    *   **Magnitude**: Drastically reduced. The fraction of IFN-$\\gamma$ producers and per-cell T-bet levels will be very low.\n    *   **Stability**: Severely compromised. The *Ifng* locus will retain its repressive H$3$K$27$me$3$ marks and will not acquire activating H$3$K$4$me$3$ marks. The cells will not be committed Th$1$ cells.\n\n*   **Condition (iii) - Neutralizing antibody to IFN-$\\gamma$**: Blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ cuts the positive feedback loop but leaves the initial IL-12/STAT$4$ pathway intact. STAT$4$ will be activated and will induce a primary, albeit suboptimal, level of T-bet. However, the amplification of T-bet expression via STAT$1$ is blocked.\n    *   **Magnitude**: Reduced, but less severely than in the anti-IL-12 condition. There will be fewer IFN-$\\gamma$ producers and lower T-bet levels than the control, as amplification is missing.\n    *   **Stability**: The effect on stability is more nuanced. The primary lineage-defining signal from STAT$4$ is present, and some T-bet is produced. This may be sufficient to initiate some degree of epigenetic imprinting. Compared to the complete failure of commitment in the anti-IL-12 condition, the Th$1$ lineage choice is made, but its reinforcement and full stabilization are impaired. Therefore, stability is reduced but not abolished. The cells are partially imprinted towards the Th$1$ lineage.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: Blocking IL-12 has a catastrophic effect on both the magnitude and stability of the Th$1$ response. Blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ has a more moderate effect, reducing the magnitude of the response but allowing the initial commitment signal to proceed, thereby resulting in a greater degree of stability than is seen with IL-12 blockade.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Blocking IL-12 during priming yields a marked reduction in Th$1$ magnitude (fewer IFN-$\\gamma$ producers and lower T-bet) and weak Th$1$ stability (diminished H$3$K$4$me$3$ and persistence of H$3$K$27$me$3$ at Ifng), whereas blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ causes only a modest reduction in initial magnitude but preserves stable Th$1$ imprinting because IL-12/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription $4$ (STAT$4$) signaling remains intact.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly describes the severe consequences of blocking the primary initiator IL-12 on both magnitude and stability (epigenetic marks). It also correctly contrasts this with the milder effect of blocking the IFN-$\\gamma$ amplification loop, correctly attributing the remaining commitment to the intact IL-12/STAT$4$ signal. The term \"preserves stable Th$1$ imprinting\" is used in a comparative sense, meaning stability is not abolished as it is with anti-IL-12. This is the most accurate and nuanced description. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ during priming abolishes Th$1$ commitment even if IL-12 is present because Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription $1$ (STAT$1$) is strictly required to induce T-bet; in contrast, blocking IL-12 has minimal impact if IFN-$\\gamma$ is intact.**\n    This option is factually incorrect. STAT$4$, not STAT$1$, is the primary inducer of T-bet. Therefore, blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ does not \"abolish\" commitment. Furthermore, the claim that blocking IL-12 has \"minimal impact\" is the opposite of the truth; it is the most critical signal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Blocking IL-12 and blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ have equivalent effects: both reduce early IFN-$\\gamma$ output but have no effect on long-term stability once antibodies are removed, because Th$1$ stability is determined solely by TCR signal strength at restimulation.**\n    This option contains two major errors. First, the effects are not equivalent, as shown by the hierarchical nature of the signaling pathway. Second, it fundamentally misunderstands Th$1$ stability, which is an epigenetically programmed state established during priming, not something determined de novo by restimulation signal strength alone. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Blocking IL-12 during priming converts cells by default into T helper $2$ (Th$2$) cells, while blocking IFN-$\\gamma$ paradoxically increases Th$1$ stability due to removal of negative feedback through interferon-regulatory pathways.**\n    This option is unsubstantiated. The default fate in neutral conditions without an IL-12 signal is not necessarily Th$2$ differentiation, which requires its own cytokine, IL-4. The second clause is also false; the IFN-$\\gamma$ signal is a core component of a positive, not negative, feedback loop for Th$1$ commitment. Blocking it would decrease, not increase, stability. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2895728"}, {"introduction": "While T-bet is known as the \"master regulator\" of Th1 cells, its function is far more nuanced than a simple on/off switch.

Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is translated to protein.\n2.  Cytokine-receptor signaling through Janus kinase–Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK–STAT) pathways, exemplified by Interleukin-12 (IL-12) signaling via STAT4 and Interferon-$\\gamma$ (IFN-$\\gamma$) signaling via STAT1.\n3.  Transcription factors bind cis-regulatory DNA elements to recruit cofactors and chromatin remodelers, establishing enhancer–promoter communication and stable gene expression programs.\n\n**Background Information:**\n1.  The T-box transcription factor T-bet (encoded by *Tbx21*) is the canonical T helper $1$ (Th$1$) master regulator.\n2.  T-bet functions include: promoting IFN-$\\gamma$ production, upregulating the IL-12 receptor, facilitating trafficking to sites of inflammation (e.g., via CXCR3 and selectin ligand biosynthesis), and repressing alternative Th$2$/Th$17$ fates.\n3.  Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a related T-box factor with overlapping DNA-binding specificity to T-bet.\n\n**Experimental Setup:**\n1.  Source of cells: Naive $CD4^{+}$ T cells from *Tbx21*^{-/-} mice.\n2.  Culture conditions: Th$1$-polarizing conditions (IL-12, anti–IL-4).\n3.  Experimental intervention: Retroviral transduction with constructs expressing Eomes, T-bet, or empty vector.\n4.  Time point for readouts: Day $5$.\n\n**Experimental Results:**\n1.  **Effector cytokine output:** IFN-$\\gamma$ production by intracellular staining is T-bet: $85\\%$, Eomes: $55\\%$, vector: $5\\%$.\n2.  **IL-12 signaling:** *Il12rb2* transcripts and phospho-STAT4 levels after an IL-12 pulse are T-bet: high, Eomes: intermediate, vector: low.\n3.  **Chemokine receptor function:** CXCR3 expression and migration toward CXCL10 ($100$ nM) shows a migration index of T-bet: $4.0$, Eomes: $1.2$, vector: $1.0$.\n4.  **Selectin ligand biosynthesis:** P-selectin–Fc binding and transcripts for *Gcnt1* and *Fut7* are T-bet: high, Eomes: baseline comparable to vector.\n5.  **Alternative lineage repression:** *Il4* and *Rorc* transcripts are strongly repressed only by T-bet; Eomes shows minimal repression relative to vector.\n6.  **Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq):**\n    -   Increased accessibility at the *Ifng* locus (e.g., CNS-22) is observed with both T-bet and Eomes.\n    -   Increased accessibility at the *Cxcr3* promoter and a *Gcnt1* enhancer is observed only with T-bet.\n\n**Question:**\nWhich mechanistic explanation best justifies why Eomes partially compensates for T-bet in IFN-$\\gamma$ production yet fails to fully recapitulate Th$1$ trafficking and repression of alternative fates?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set firmly within the field of immunology, specifically T cell differentiation. The concepts—Th$1$ cells, transcription factors T-bet and Eomes, JAK-STAT signaling, retroviral gene expression, and analytical techniques like ATAC-seq—are all standard and fundamentally correct. The described roles of T-bet are accurate. The experimental design is a classic \"rescue\" experiment, a valid and powerful tool in molecular biology.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a comprehensive dataset and asks for a mechanistic interpretation that explains all observations. The question is specific, answerable, and requires synthesis of the provided data and principles. A unique, best-fit explanation can be discerned by evaluating the options against the data.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical and descriptive, devoid of subjective or biased phrasing. The data is presented quantitatively or with clear qualitative comparisons (high, intermediate, low).\n4.  **Completeness:** The problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary background principles, experimental design, and a rich set of results covering gene expression, protein function, and chromatin state. This information is sufficient to construct a logical argument and evaluate the given options.\n5.  **No other flaws detected:** The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or based on non-formalizable concepts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is **valid**. It is a well-constructed, scientifically sound problem that tests the ability to integrate molecular data to form a coherent mechanistic conclusion. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to explain a dichotomy: Eomes partially restores IFN-$\\gamma$ production in the absence of T-bet, but fails to restore other key Th$1$ functions like trafficking and lineage suppression. We must use the provided data to build a mechanism.\n\n1.  **Explaining Partial IFN-$\\gamma$ Rescue:**\n    -   The data show that Eomes-transduced cells produce IFN-$\\gamma$ at a level ($55\\%$) significantly above the vector control ($5\\%$), but below the T-bet rescue ($85\\%$).\n    -   The ATAC-seq data provides a direct mechanism: both T-bet and Eomes increase chromatin accessibility at the *Ifng* locus. This is consistent with the given principle that they are both T-box factors with \"overlapping DNA-binding specificity\". By binding to cis-regulatory elements at the *Ifng* locus, they can recruit chromatin remodelers, opening the locus for transcription.\n    -   Furthermore, Eomes achieves an \"intermediate\" level of *Il12rb2* expression and subsequent STAT4 phosphorylation. The IL-12/STAT4 pathway is a critical positive feedback loop for Th$1$ differentiation and IFN-$\\gamma$ production. Therefore, Eomes partially restores this amplification loop, contributing to the observed IFN-$\\gamma$ production. The restoration is incomplete compared to T-bet, which aligns with the intermediate phenotype.\n\n2.  **Explaining Failure to Restore Trafficking:**\n    -   Trafficking function is assessed by two systems: the CXCR3/CXCL10 axis and the P-selectin ligand.\n    -   For the CXCR3 axis, Eomes fails completely. The migration index ($1.2$) is comparable to the vector control ($1.0$), whereas T-bet induces robust migration (index $4.0$). The ATAC-seq data reveals the molecular basis for this failure: T-bet increases accessibility at the *Cxcr3* promoter, while Eomes does not. This means Eomes is incapable of activating the *Cxcr3* gene.\n    -   For the P-selectin ligand, the required biosynthetic enzymes *Gcnt1* and *Fut7* are induced by T-bet but not by Eomes. Again, the ATAC-seq data provides the explanation: T-bet increases accessibility at a *Gcnt1* enhancer, but Eomes does not.\n\n3.  **Explaining Failure to Repress Alternative Lineages:**\n    -   T-bet strongly represses the key Th$2$ (*Il4*) and Th$17$ (*Rorc*) lineage genes. Eomes fails to do this, showing minimal repression compared to the vector control.\n\n**Synthesis of Mechanism:**\nThe data collectively point to a model of differential gene regulation. T-bet and Eomes can both bind to and activate a subset of common target genes, such as *Ifng*, likely through their shared T-box DNA-binding domain. However, the regulation of a distinct set of genes—including *Cxcr3*, *Gcnt1*, *Il4*, and *Rorc*—requires an activity that T-bet possesses but Eomes lacks. The ATAC-seq results, showing a failure of Eomes to even open chromatin at these specific loci, are a critical observation. This implies that binding of the T-box domain alone is insufficient for regulation at these sites. Instead, regulation likely requires the recruitment of additional co-factors or cooperation with other transcription factors that bind to adjacent or composite DNA elements. The ability to mediate these protein-protein interactions would reside in domains of the T-bet protein that are different or absent in Eomes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Eomes shares T-box DNA-binding specificity with T-bet and can occupy *Ifng* enhancers to recruit chromatin remodelers such as SWI/SNF (for example, BRG$1$), restoring IFN-$\\gamma$ and an IL-$12$/STAT$4$ feed-forward loop to a limited degree; however, Eomes lacks the N-terminal interfaces and phosphorylation-dependent docking that enable T-bet to cooperate with Runx family transcription factor $3$ (Runx$3$), H$2.0$-like homeobox (Hlx), and STAT$1$ at composite motifs within *Cxcr3*, *Gcnt1*, and *Il4*/*Rorc* regulatory regions, so it neither installs core $2$ O-glycan enzymes nor establishes repressive chromatin at Th$2$/Th$17$ loci required for trafficking and fate exclusion.**\n\nThis option provides a comprehensive explanation that aligns perfectly with our derived mechanism. It correctly identifies that shared binding specificity at the *Ifng* locus explains the partial rescue of IFN-$\\gamma$ and the associated IL-12/STAT4 loop. Crucially, it proposes a specific and plausible reason for the divergent functions: T-bet possesses unique protein domains for interacting with other transcription factors (Runx3, Hlx, STAT1), which are required for gene regulation at specific loci (*Cxcr3*, *Gcnt1*, *Il4*/*Rorc*). This differential cofactor/co-regulator recruitment explains why Eomes fails to induce chromatin accessibility and gene expression at these specific sites. The conclusion that Eomes fails to induce glycosylation enzymes (*Gcnt1*) and repress alternative lineages (*Il4*/*Rorc*) is a direct restatement of the experimental findings. This option integrates all data into a single, mechanistically sound hypothesis consistent with established principles of transcriptional regulation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Eomes cannot bind T-box motifs in the *Ifng* locus but instead increases Interleukin-$2$ (IL-$2$) secretion to drive bystander activation, which nonspecifically enhances IFN-$\\gamma$; its failure to induce trafficking genes reflects the absence of Type I Interferon receptor in *Tbx21*^{-/-} cells.**\n\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds. First, the claim that \"Eomes cannot bind T-box motifs in the *Ifng* locus\" is directly contradicted by the ATAC-seq data, which shows Eomes increases chromatin accessibility at this very locus. Second, it proposes an indirect IL-2-mediated mechanism for which there is no evidence in the provided data. Third, the claim about the \"absence of Type I Interferon receptor in *Tbx21*^{-/-} cells\" is a fabrication; there is no biological basis for this, and T-bet is shown to function perfectly well in these same cells, invalidating this premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The difference arises entirely from subcellular localization: Eomes is retained in the cytosol in $CD4^{+}$ T cells and only occasionally enters the nucleus to activate *Ifng*, whereas T-bet is constitutively nuclear, allowing stable activation of chemokine receptor and glycosyltransferase genes and repression of alternative lineage factors.**\n\nThis explanation is inconsistent with the observed pattern of gene expression. If Eomes were primarily cytosolic and only occasionally entered the nucleus, one would expect a globally weak, stochastic effect on all potential target genes. Instead, we see a strong, reliable effect on some genes (*Ifng*, leading to $55\\%$ of cells becoming positive) and a complete lack of effect on others (*Cxcr3*, *Gcnt1*). This locus-specific difference in activity is not well explained by a general impairment in nuclear localization. It is more plausibly explained by differential activity *within* the nucleus at specific gene regulatory elements, as supported by the ATAC-seq data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Eomes more strongly activates STAT$3$ than STAT$4$, diverting cells toward T helper $17$ (Th$17$) differentiation; thus, reduced IFN-$\\gamma$ derives from lineage diversion, and the lack of trafficking molecules is due to Transforming Growth Factor-$\\beta$ (TGF-$\\beta$) inhibition of glycosylation pathways.**\n\nThis option is directly contradicted by the data. It claims Eomes diverts cells toward the Th17 lineage. However, the data explicitly state that Eomes causes \"minimal repression\" of the key Th17 transcription factor *Rorc* relative to the vector control, meaning it does *not* promote the Th17 lineage. The Th17 program is not activated. Therefore, the premise of lineage diversion is false. Consequently, the downstream conclusions about reduced IFN-$\\gamma$ and lack of trafficking molecules are built on a faulty foundation. Furthermore, the invocation of TGF-$\\beta$ is unsubstantiated, as it was not part of the Th1-polarizing culture conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2895757"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate purpose of a Th1 cell is to orchestrate an effective immune response, primarily through its signature cytokine, IFN-$\\gamma$.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe steady-state production rate of nitric oxide ($\\mathrm{NO}$) as a function of the IFN-$\\gamma$ concentration, $[I]$, is given by the Hill equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NO}([I]) = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\,[I]^{n}}{K^{n}+[I]^{n}}\n$$\nWe are tasked to find the concentrations $[I]$ that result in a production rate equal to a fraction $f$ of the maximal rate $V_{\\max}$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NO}([I]) = f \\cdot V_{\\max}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\mathrm{NO}([I])$ yields:\n$$\nf \\cdot V_{\\max} = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\,[I]^{n}}{K^{n}+[I]^{n}}\n$$\nSince $V_{\\max}$ represents a maximal rate, it is non-zero, and we can divide both sides by $V_{\\max}$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[I]^{n}}{K^{n}+[I]^{n}}\n$$\nWe must now solve this algebraic equation for $[I]$.\n$$\nf \\cdot (K^{n}+[I]^{n}) = [I]^{n}\n$$\n$$\nf K^{n} + f [I]^{n} = [I]^{n}\n$$\n$$\nf K^{n} = [I]^{n} - f [I]^{n}\n$$\n$$\nf K^{n} = [I]^{n} (1 - f)\n$$\nIsolating $[I]^{n}$:\n$$\n[I]^{n} = K^{n} \\frac{f}{1 - f}\n$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides gives the general solution for $[I]$:\n$$\n[I] = K \\left( \\frac{f}{1 - f} \\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nWe are given the parameter values $K=0.80$ ng/mL and $n=2$. We will now apply these to the two specified cases.\n\nCase 1: Find $[I]$ for $f=0.5$.\nSubstituting $f=0.5$ into our derived general solution:\n$$\n[I] = K \\left( \\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5} \\right)^{1/2} = K \\left( \\frac{0.5}{0.5} \\right)^{1/2} = K (1)^{1/2} = K\n$$\nThis result is a trivial consequence of the definition of the parameter $K$, which is the concentration required for half-maximal response.\nGiven $K=0.80$ ng/mL, the concentration is $0.80$ ng/mL. As per the problem's instruction to round to three significant figures, this is $[I] = 0.800$ ng/mL.\n\nCase 2: Find $[I]$ for $f=0.9$.\nSubstituting $f=0.9$, $K=0.80$ ng/mL, and $n=2$ into the general solution:\n$$\n[I] = (0.80) \\left( \\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.9} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n[I] = (0.80) \\left( \\frac{0.9}{0.1} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n[I] = (0.80) \\left( 9 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n[I] = (0.80) \\cdot 3\n$$\n$$\n[I] = 2.4 \\text{ ng/mL}\n$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures as required, we obtain $[I] = 2.40$ ng/mL.\n\nThe two IFN-$\\gamma$ concentrations required to achieve fractions $f=0.5$ and $f=0.9$ of the maximal NO production rate are $0.800$ ng/mL and $2.40$ ng/mL, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.800 & 2.40 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2895762"}]}
