The scenario describes Th17 cell differentiation, a standard topic in immunology.

This is written as:\n$$ F = P(X > \\theta) $$\nWe are given that $X$ is a log-normally distributed random variable. This means that its natural logarithm, $Y = \\ln X$, is a normally distributed random variable, with $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$.\n\nBecause the natural logarithm function is a strictly monotonically increasing function, the inequality $X > \\theta$ is equivalent to the inequality $\\ln X > \\ln \\theta$. Therefore, we can express the fraction $F$ in terms of the normally distributed variable $Y$:\n$$ F = P(\\ln X > \\ln \\theta) = P(Y > \\ln \\theta) $$\nTo find this probability, we must standardize the normal random variable $Y$. A standard normal random variable, denoted $Z$, is defined by the transformation $Z = \\frac{Y - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We apply this transformation to our inequality:\n$$ Y > \\ln \\theta \\implies Y - \\mu > \\ln \\theta - \\mu \\implies \\frac{Y - \\mu}{\\sigma} > \\frac{\\ln \\theta - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nThus, the probability $F$ can be expressed in terms of the standard normal variable $Z$:\n$$ F = P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\ln \\theta - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is denoted by $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$.
