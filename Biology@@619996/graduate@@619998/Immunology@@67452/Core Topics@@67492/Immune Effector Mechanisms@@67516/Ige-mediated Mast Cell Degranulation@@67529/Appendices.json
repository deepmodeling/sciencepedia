A crosslinked cluster is defined as an antigen molecule binding to $k \\geq 2$ receptors.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental equilibrium relationships. Let $R_{free}$ be the concentration of free IgE-FcεRI complexes at equilibrium. The binding of a single epitope on an antigen to a receptor is governed by the microscopic dissociation constant $K_d$. We define $p$ as the probability that any given epitope on an antigen is bound to a receptor. According to the law of mass action for the binding of a free receptor to a free epitope, this probability is a function of the free receptor concentration:\n$$p = \\frac{R_{free}}{K_d + R_{free}}$$\nThis relation can be rearranged to express $R_{free}$ in terms of $p$:\n$$p(K_d + R_{free}) = R_{free} \\implies p K_d = R_{free}(1 - p) \\implies R_{free} = \\frac{p K_d}{1-p}$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of receptors. The total receptor concentration, $R_T$, is the sum of free receptors, $R_{free}$, and bound receptors, $R_{bound}$.\n$$R_T = R_{free} + R_{bound}$$\nThe total concentration of bound receptors, $R_{bound}$, corresponds to the total concentration of bound epitopes. With a total antigen concentration of $A_T$ and a valency of $v$, the total concentration of epitopes in the system is $v A_T$. Therefore, the concentration of bound receptors is:\n$$R_{bound} = p \\cdot (v A_T)$$\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation for receptors gives:\n$$R_{free} = R_T - R_{bound} = R_T - v A_T p$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $R_{free}$. Equating them allows us to find an equation for the equilibrium probability $p$:\n$$\\frac{p K_d}{1-p} = R_T - v A_T p$$\nRearranging this equation gives a quadratic equation for $p$:\n$$p K_d = (R_T - v A_T p)(1-p)$$\n$$p K_d = R_T - R_T p - v A_T p + v A_T p^2$$\n$$v A_T p^2 - (R_T + K_d + v A_T) p + R_T = 0$$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x=p$, $a = v A_T$, $b = -(R_T + K_d + v A_T)$, and $c = R_T$. The solution for $p$ is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$p = \\frac{(R_T + K_d + v A_T) \\pm \\sqrt{(R_T + K_d + v A_T)^2 - 4(v A_T)R_T}}{2 v A_T}$$\nTo select the physically meaningful root, we consider the limit as $A_T \\to 0$. In this limit, there should be no binding, but the equation for $p$ is not immediately obvious. The probability $p$ represents the conditional probability of an epitope being bound, given an antigen is present. As $A_T \\to 0$, $R_{free} \\to R_T$, and $p$ should approach the finite value $\\frac{R_T}{K_d+R_T}$. The negative root of the quadratic equation correctly captures this behavior (via L'Hôpital's rule), while the positive root diverges. Thus, we choose the negative sign:\n$$p = \\frac{R_T + K_d + v A_T - \\sqrt{(R_T + K_d + v A_T)^2 - 4 v A_T R_T}}{2 v A_T}$$\n\nNow, we model the distribution of cluster sizes. Since each of the $v$ epitopes on an antigen binds independently with probability $p$, the number of receptors bound to a single antigen follows a binomial distribution. The probability that an antigen is bound to exactly $k$ receptors is:\n$$P(k) = \\binom{v}{k} p^k (1-p)^{v-k}$$\nThe concentration of clusters of size $k$ is $A_k = A_T P(k)$. Since each cluster of size $k$ contains $k$ receptors, the concentration of receptors participating in clusters of size $k$, denoted $[R_k]$, is:\n$$[R_k] = k \\cdot A_k = k A_T \\binom{v}{k} p^k (1-p)^{v-k}$$\n\nThe problem requires the fraction of receptors in dimers ($k=2$) among all receptors in crosslinked clusters ($k \\geq 2$). Let's denote this fraction $f_{\\mathrm{dimer}}$.\nThe numerator is the concentration of receptors in dimers, $[R_2]$:\n$$[R_2] = 2 A_T \\binom{v}{2} p^2 (1-p)^{v-2} = 2 A_T \\frac{v(v-1)}{2} p^2 (1-p)^{v-2} = v(v-1) A_T p^2 (1-p)^{v-2}$$\nThe denominator is the total concentration of receptors in all crosslinked clusters, $\\sum_{k=2}^{v} [R_k]$. We can calculate this by noting that the sum over all possible cluster sizes (from $k=1$ to $v$) is the total concentration of bound receptors, $R_{bound} = v A_T p$.\n$$\\sum_{k=2}^{v} [R_k] = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{v} [R_k]\\right) - [R_1] = R_{bound} - [R_1]$$\nThe concentration of receptors in clusters of size $k=1$ is:\n$$[R_1] = 1 \\cdot A_T \\binom{v}{1} p^1 (1-p)^{v-1} = v A_T p (1-p)^{v-1}$$\nTherefore, the denominator is:\n$$\\sum_{k=2}^{v} [R_k] = v A_T p - v A_T p (1-p)^{v-1} = v A_T p \\left(1 - (1-p)^{v-1}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{dimer}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{dimer}} = \\frac{[R_2]}{\\sum_{k=2}^{v} [R_k]} = \\frac{v(v-1) A_T p^2 (1-p)^{v-2}}{v A_T p \\left(1 - (1-p)^{v-1}\\right)}$$\nThe terms $v A_T p$ cancel, simplifying the expression to:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{dimer}} = \\frac{(v-1) p (1-p)^{v-2}}{1 - (1-p)^{v-1}}$$\nThis expression is valid for $v \\geq 2$. For $v=1$, no crosslinking is possible, and the denominator is zero.\n\nThe final step is to substitute the expression for $p$ into this formula to obtain the final answer as a function of the given parameters $v, A_T, R_T, K_d$.
