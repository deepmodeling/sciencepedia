Flow cytometry demonstrates that the target cell has no detectable Fas (CD95) on its surface, but Western blotting and functional assays confirm normal expression and activity of the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery, including BAX, BAK, cytochrome c release, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), caspase-9, and executioner caspase-3. Consider the two canonical cytotoxic lymphocyte pathways: the perforin–granzyme pathway and the Fas–Fas ligand (Fas–FasL) pathway.

Perforin–granzyme B–mediated killing dominates, because perforin enables delivery of granzyme B into the cytosol where it engages the intrinsic pathway by activating BID, leading to BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, Apaf-1 apoptosome assembly, caspase-9 activation, and downstream caspase-3–mediated apoptosis.\n\nB.

It describes the interaction between a CTL and a target cell, involving the two major mechanisms of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. All molecules and pathways mentioned (CD8$^{+}$, Fas/FasL, perforin, granzyme B, BAX/BAK, mitochondrial pathway, caspases) are central to this field. The scenario of a virus-infected cell downregulating a surface receptor like Fas to evade the immune system is a known and realistic biological phenomenon.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear and specific scenario. The absence of the Fas receptor is a critical and unambiguous constraint. The question asks for a logical deduction based on this constraint and the provided definitions of the pathways. A unique and logical conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. It presents factual biological conditions without subjective-opinion or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem statement presents no violations of scientific principles, logical consistency, or objectivity. It is a self-contained, well-posed problem grounded in established immunology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nDerivation of Solution\nThe problem requires an evaluation of the two canonical CTL killing mechanisms under the specific condition that the target cell lacks the Fas receptor (CD95).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Fas–FasL Pathway:** This pathway is a an example of extrinsic apoptosis, initiated by an external signal. It functions through the interaction of a death ligand, FasL (expressed on the surface of the activated CTL), with its cognate death receptor, Fas (expressed on the surface of the target cell). The problem explicitly states that the target cell has \"no detectable Fas (CD95) on its surface\". According to the principle of receptor–ligand dependence for death receptor signaling, the absence of the receptor renders the pathway non-functional. FasL on the CTL cannot bind to its target, and thus the downstream signaling cascade—recruitment of the FADD adaptor protein, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), and activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-8—cannot be initiated. Therefore, the Fas–FasL pathway is effectively abrogated.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Perforin–Granzyme Pathway:** This pathway involves the directed release of cytotoxic granules from the CTL into the immunological synapse. These granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of serine proteases called granzymes, with granzyme B being the most potent in inducing apoptosis. The problem states that the delivery mechanism is \"receptor independence for granule exocytosis–mediated delivery\". Perforin creates pores in the target cell membrane, allowing granzyme B to enter the cytosol. Once inside, granzyme B can initiate apoptosis through multiple routes. It can directly cleave and activate executioner caspases such as caspase-3. Alternatively, and of particular relevance here, it can amplify the apoptotic signal by engaging the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Granzyme B does this by cleaving the BH3-only protein BID to its truncated form, tBID. The problem explicitly confirms that the machinery of this pathway—including BAX, BAK, cytochrome c, Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3—is fully functional. The generated tBID translocates to the mitochondria and induces the oligomerization of BAX and BAK, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytochrome c then binds to Apaf-1, triggering the assembly of the apoptosome, which in turn recruits and activates caspase-9. Active caspase-9 then activates executioner caspase-3, culminating in apoptosis.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the Fas–FasL pathway is blocked due to the absence of its receptor, and the perforin–granzyme pathway remains fully competent to act on a functional intrinsic apoptotic machinery within the target cell, the perforin–granzyme pathway will be the dominant, if not exclusive, mechanism for killing this target cell.\n\nEvaluation of Options\n**A. Perforin–granzyme B–mediated killing dominates, because perforin enables delivery of granzyme B into the cytosol where it engages the intrinsic pathway by activating BID, leading to BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, Apaf-1 apoptosome assembly, caspase-9 activation, and downstream caspase-3–mediated apoptosis.**\nThis option correctly identifies the perforin–granzyme pathway as dominant. The provided rationale is an accurate and detailed description of one of the major mechanisms of granzyme B action—the engagement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway via BID cleavage. This mechanism is fully consistent with the givens of the problem, which state that the mitochondrial pathway components are all present and functional.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Fas–FasL remains dominant, because caspase-8 can still be recruited to a death-inducing signaling complex via other adaptors even when Fas is absent, so loss of Fas has little impact on extrinsic apoptosis during cytotoxic T cell killing.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Fas–FasL signaling pathway is critically dependent on the physical interaction between FasL and the Fas receptor. The formation of the canonical DISC that activates caspase-8 in response to FasL requires the Fas receptor. The claim that this can be bypassed by \"other adaptors\" is a biologically false premise in the context of Fas-mediated signaling. The loss of Fas has a definitive, not \"little\", impact: it completely blocks this specific pathway.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\\alpha$)–TNF receptor 1 signaling becomes dominant, because TNF-$\\alpha$ secreted by cytotoxic T cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis in most targets independently of mitochondrial amplification and can substitute for the loss of Fas.**\nThis option introduces a pathway, TNF-$\\alpha$ signaling, that is outside the two canonical pathways specified by the problem. The question asks to predict the dominant pathway from the choice of perforin-granzyme and Fas-FasL. Furthermore, the assertion that TNF-$\\alpha$ induces apoptosis \"independently of mitochondrial amplification\" in \"most targets\" is a gross oversimplification and often untrue. Many cell types require mitochondrial amplification (the \"Type II\" pathway) for TNF-$\\alpha$-mediated apoptosis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Granulysin-mediated osmotic lysis becomes dominant, because granulysin directly disrupts membranes and therefore bypasses both the Fas–FasL and mitochondrial pathways, making the state of the mitochondrial machinery irrelevant.**\nWhile granulysin is a component of cytotoxic granules and can lyse cells at high concentrations, the primary effector of CTL-induced apoptosis is granzyme B. To posit that granulysin-mediated lysis becomes the *dominant* mechanism is not the standard model. More importantly, the rationale argues that the mitochondrial machinery becomes \"irrelevant\". This is a poor argument when the problem explicitly provides that this machinery is functional, and a well-established pathway (granzyme B -> BID -> mitochondria) directly utilizes it. The most parsimonious explanation is that the CTL uses the pathway that is available and effective, which is the granzyme B-mitochondrial axis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–death receptor DR4/DR5 signaling dominates, because TRAIL is constitutively expressed on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells and does not require the presence of Fas on the target to trigger caspase-8–dependent apoptosis in most cells.**\nSimilar to option C, this introduces a\nthird pathway (TRAIL signaling) which is not one of the two canonical pathways the problem asks to be considered. The solution must be derived from an analysis of the perforin–granzyme and Fas–FasL pathways, as per the problem constraints.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2880418"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational differences between the pathways, a key skill for any immunologist is the ability to experimentally dissect complex cellular processes.

The roles of $Ca^{2+}$, the perforin–granzyme pathway, and the Fas–FasL pathway are well-established scientific facts. EGTA is a standard experimental tool used to chelate extracellular $Ca^{2+}$, and its high selectivity for $Ca^{2+}$ over $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (dissociation constant $K_d$ for $Ca^{2+}$ is orders of magnitude lower than for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) is a known property. The given concentrations are realistic for cell culture experiments. The distinction between rapid (perforin) and slow (FasL) killing kinetics is also a well-documented phenomenon.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to deduce a unique outcome based on established biological mechanisms. The question is clear and unambiguous.\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical and free of subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions or missing critical data for a conceptual analysis. The problem is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution requires an analysis of the calcium dependency of each cytotoxic pathway.\n\n**1. The Perforin–Granzyme Pathway**\nThis pathway involves the directed secretion of lytic granules from the CTL into the immunological synapse formed with the target cell. This process has at least two critical steps that are dependent on extracellular calcium.\n*   **Lytic Granule Exocytosis:** Following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement with the peptide-MHC complex on the target cell, a signaling cascade is initiated in the CTL. This cascade leads to an increase in the CTL's intracellular free calcium concentration, $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_i$. A major component of this increase is the influx of $Ca^{2+}$ from the extracellular medium through channels such as the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. This sharp rise in $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_i$ is an absolute requirement for the final fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane at the synapse, a process known as degranulation or exocytosis.\n*   **Perforin Function:** After release, perforin monomers must bind to the target cell's plasma membrane and oligomerize to form a transmembrane pore. This process—both binding and polymerization—is strictly dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of $Ca^{2+}$ in the extracellular space (i.e., the synaptic cleft).\n\nThe addition of $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA to a medium containing $1.8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $Ca^{2+}$ results in the chelation of virtually all free extracellular $Ca^{2+}$. The concentration of free $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_\\text{ext}$ will plummet to nanomolar or picomolar levels. This has two definitive consequences for the perforin pathway:\n    *   It will prevent the TCR-induced influx of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ into the CTL, thereby inhibiting lytic granule exocytosis.\n    *   Even if any residual exocytosis were to occur, the absence of free $Ca^{2+}$ in the synapse would render the perforin protein non-functional, preventing it from forming pores in the target cell membrane.\n\nSince the perforin–granzyme pathway is responsible for rapid target cell killing (within minutes), its complete inhibition will abolish the cytotoxicity observed at the early time point of $60\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\n**2. The Fas–FasL Pathway**\nThis pathway is mediated by the interaction of two transmembrane proteins: FasL on the CTL and its receptor, Fas, on the target cell.\n*   **Mechanism:** Upon TCR stimulation, CTLs upregulate the expression of FasL. The trimeric FasL binds to and trimerizes Fas on the target cell surface. This conformational change recruits the adaptor protein FADD, which in turn recruits pro-caspase-8, forming the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC). At the DISC, pro-caspase-8 molecules undergo proximity-induced auto-activation, initiating a downstream executioner caspase cascade (e.g., activating caspase-3) that culminates in apoptosis.\n*   **Calcium Dependency:** The core signaling events of this pathway—ligand-receptor binding, receptor clustering, and DISC assembly—are protein-protein interactions that do not require extracellular calcium. The entire signaling cascade can proceed effectively in a calcium-depleted extracellular environment.\n\nThis pathway has slower kinetics than the perforin pathway, as it often requires de novo synthesis of FasL and the subsequent signaling cascade takes time. Its effects are typically measured over several hours. Therefore, in the presence of EGTA, the Fas–FasL pathway should remain functional and lead to an accumulation of apoptotic target cells, which will be detectable at the $6\\,\\mathrm{h}$ time point.\n\n**Predicted Outcome:**\n*   **At $60\\,\\mathrm{min}$:** Cytotoxicity will be abolished or reduced to background levels because the rapid, $Ca^{2+}$-dependent perforin pathway is blocked.\n*   **At $6\\,\\mathrm{h}$:** Cytotoxicity will be observed due to the action of the slower, $Ca^{2+}$-independent Fas–FasL pathway.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA will abolish the rapid cytotoxicity at $60\\,\\mathrm{min}$ by blocking calcium-dependent lytic granule exocytosis and perforin membrane binding, but will have minimal effect on Fas–FasL-mediated apoptosis, which will still accumulate and be detectable by $6\\,\\mathrm{h}$.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement perfectly aligns with our derivation. It correctly identifies that rapid ($60\\,\\mathrm{min}$) cytotoxicity is blocked due to the inhibition of two key $Ca^{2+}$-dependent steps of the perforin pathway (exocytosis and perforin function). It also correctly states that the slower Fas–FasL pathway is largely unaffected and will result in measurable cytotoxicity at the later time point ($6\\,\\mathrm{h}$).\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA will enhance perforin-mediated lysis by inhibiting calcium-dependent membrane repair while leaving Fas–FasL unchanged, thereby increasing both early ($60\\,\\mathrm{min}$) and late ($6\\,\\mathrm{h}$) killing.**\n*   **Analysis:** This is incorrect. While target cells do employ $Ca^{2+}$-dependent membrane repair mechanisms, this is irrelevant when the formation of perforin pores is completely blocked upstream by the lack of $Ca^{2+}$. There can be no enhancement of a process that is not occurring. The premise that perforin-mediated lysis occurs at all in the presence of EGTA is fundamentally flawed.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA will selectively inhibit Fas–FasL-mediated death because Fas receptor trimerization and caspase-8 activation are calcium-dependent, but will spare granule exocytosis; early ($60\\,\\mathrm{min}$) killing is preserved whereas late ($6\\,\\mathrm{h}$) killing is lost.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement incorrectly assigns the calcium dependencies. Granule exocytosis is critically $Ca^{2+}$-dependent and will not be spared. The Fas–FasL primary signaling cascade is not $Ca^{2+}$-dependent. This option describes the exact opposite of the established mechanisms.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA will eliminate both perforin–granzyme and Fas–FasL pathways at all time points because both require extracellular calcium influx for execution.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement is an incorrect overgeneralization. While it is correct that the perforin–granzyme pathway is eliminated, it is incorrect to state that the Fas–FasL pathway requires extracellular calcium. The Fas–FasL pathway will remain functional. Therefore, killing will not be eliminated at all time points.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2880397"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of understanding is the ability to synthesize multiple lines of evidence to solve a complex problem.

This is statistically indistinguishable from the healthy controls, who show an increase from $3\\%$ to $38\\%$. CD107a is a component of the lytic granule membrane that becomes exposed on the CTL surface only when the granule fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents. Therefore, this result unequivocally demonstrates that the molecular machinery responsible for lytic granule polarization, docking, priming, and fusion at the immunological synapse is intact and functional in the patient's CTLs. The process of degranulation itself is normal.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Fas–FasL Pathway (Annexin V Assay)**: The experiment using CMA to inhibit the perforin pathway and target cells sensitive to Fas-mediated killing shows that the patient's CTLs induce apoptosis (measured by annexin V, a marker of early apoptosis) in $62\\%$ of targets. This is comparable to the $58\\%$ induced by control CTLs. This result confirms that the entire Fas–FasL signaling axis is functional, including the expression and function of FasL on the patient's CTLs and the downstream apoptotic signaling cascade within the target cells. This finding effectively isolates the defect to the perforin–granzyme pathway.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Perforin-Granzyme Pathway ($^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ Release Assay)**: This assay measures the release of $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ from the cytoplasm of pre-loaded target cells, which occurs upon loss of membrane integrity. This lytic event is primarily caused by pores formed by the perforin protein. The patient's CTLs show a catastrophic failure in this assay, mediating almost no lysis ($<5\\%$ at $4$ hours) compared to the robust lysis by control CTLs ($40\\%$ at $4$ hours).\n\n**Synthesis of Results**\n\nWe have established the following:\n*   Granule exocytosis (degranulation) is **normal**.\n*   The contents of the lytic granules are released into the immunological synapse.\n*   Target cell killing via the perforin-dependent mechanism is severely **impaired**.\n*   Killing via the Fas–FasL pathway is **normal**.\n\nThe defect must therefore lie downstream of granule fusion but be intrinsic to the components of the perforin-granzyme pathway. The logical steps are: release of granule contents, perforin action on the target membrane, and granzyme action within the target cell. The profound defect in the $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release assay, which directly reflects membrane damage, points to a failure in the very first step after granule release: the formation of pores in the target cell membrane by perforin.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Docking and priming of lytic granules at the immunological synapse (for example, RAB27A or MUNC13-4 dependent steps)**: This step precedes granule membrane fusion. As established by the normal CD107a upregulation, these processes are functional. A defect here would lead to impaired degranulation, which is contrary to the evidence. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Perforin pore formation in the target cell membrane (for example, due to perforin protein deficiency or misprocessing)**: This hypothesis is perfectly consistent with all observations. Normal degranulation would release a non-functional or absent perforin protein. Without perforin pores, granzymes cannot enter the target cell, and direct membrane lysis does not occur. This single defect fully explains the severe impairment in the $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release assay despite normal degranulation and a normal Fas-FasL pathway. This clinical picture is characteristic of Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Type 2 (FHL2), which is caused by mutations in the perforin gene ($PRF1$). Thus, this option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Induction or expression of Fas ligand (FasL) on activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes**: The experiment demonstrates that the patient's CTLs mediate Fas-dependent killing at levels comparable to controls. This directly proves that FasL expression and function are intact. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Availability and activity of granzymes within lytic granules (for example, granzyme B loss or cathepsin C–dependent activation defect)**: This is a plausible but less likely explanation. If perforin were functional but granzymes were absent or inactive, granzymes would fail to induce apoptosis after entering the cell. However, the $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release assay primarily measures perforin-mediated lysis. While downstream apoptotic events induced by granzymes contribute to secondary necrosis and can enhance $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release over time, the near-complete absence of lysis at $4$ hours ($<5\\%$) strongly implicates a failure of the initial, direct membrane-disrupting action of perforin itself. A perforin defect (Option B) is a more fundamental lesion that explains the failure of the entire pathway, including the lack of granzyme delivery. A granzyme-only defect does not explain the lack of primary perforin-mediated lysis as effectively. Therefore, Option B is the *most likely* cause. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Target cell initiator caspase-8 function downstream of Fas engagement**: The demonstration of normal Fas-FasL mediated apoptosis, measured by annexin V positivity in the target cells, confirms that the target cell's intrinsic apoptotic machinery, including the initiator caspase-8, is functional. A defect here would have prevented the apoptosis observed in the control experiment. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2880419"}]}
