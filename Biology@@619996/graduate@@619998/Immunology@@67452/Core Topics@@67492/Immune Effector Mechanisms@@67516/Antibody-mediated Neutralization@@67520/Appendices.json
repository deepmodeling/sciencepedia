By working through a typical data scenario, you will practice calculating the standard $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer and firmly grasp the principle of how this key metric allows for the direct comparison of neutralization activity between different samples.", "problem": "A laboratory uses the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) to quantify antibody-mediated neutralization of a cytopathic virus by patient sera. In PRNT, a virus-only control yields a baseline plaque count denoted $P_{0}$, and a serum at dilution factor $d$ (expressed as a fraction of the undiluted serum, so that $d = 1/320$ for a $1:320$ dilution) yields a plaque count $P(d)$. The observed neutralization at dilution $d$ is defined as the fractional reduction in plaques relative to control, $R(d) = 1 - P(d)/P_{0}$. The $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution factor that produces $R(d) = 0.5$ under otherwise identical assay conditions.\n\nA sample of Serum A produces, by interpolation across a two-fold serial dilution series, exactly $50\\%$ plaque reduction at a dilution of $1:320$. A second sample, Serum B, produces exactly $50\\%$ plaque reduction at a dilution of $1:40$. Assume both sera were tested side-by-side in the same assay run so that comparisons across sera are valid.\n\nUsing the core definition of $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer and first principles of dilution, (i) determine the $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer for Serum A, and (ii) derive how to compare neutralizing activity across sera using titers. Then compute the fold difference in neutralization potency defined as the ratio of the $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer of Serum A to that of Serum B.\n\nExpress your final answer as a pure number (no units), rounded to three significant figures. Report only the fold-difference as your final numeric answer.", "solution": "The solution requires a step-by-step application of the provided definitions to calculate the titers and their ratio.\n\n(i) Determination of the $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ Titer for Serum A.\nThe $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution factor, $d$, at which a $50\\%$ plaque reduction is observed. A $50\\%$ reduction corresponds to a fractional reduction $R(d) = 0.5$.\nFor Serum A, this condition is met at a dilution of $1:320$. The corresponding dilution factor, $d_A$, is the fractional representation of this dilution:\n$$d_A = \\frac{1}{320}$$\nAccording to the definition, the $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer for Serum A, which we denote as $\\text{Titer}_A$, is the reciprocal of $d_A$:\n$$\\text{Titer}_A = \\frac{1}{d_A} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{320}} = 320$$\n\n(ii) Derivation of Method for Comparing Neutralizing Activity.\nNeutralization potency refers to the effectiveness of a serum in neutralizing a pathogen. A higher potency implies that a smaller amount of the original serum is required to achieve a specific level of neutralization. In the context of the PRNT assay, this means a more potent serum must be diluted to a greater extent to reduce its neutralizing activity to the $50\\%$ threshold.\nLet us consider two sera, Serum A and Serum B, with corresponding dilution factors $d_A$ and $d_B$ that each yield $R(d) = 0.5$. Their respective titers are $\\text{Titer}_A = \\frac{1}{d_A}$ and $\\text{Titer}_B = \\frac{1}{d_B}$.\nIf Serum A is more potent than Serum B, it means that to reach the same $50\\%$ neutralization endpoint, Serum A must be diluted more than Serum B. A greater dilution corresponds to a smaller dilution factor. Therefore, if Serum A is more potent than Serum B, then $d_A < d_B$.\nFrom this inequality, we can deduce the relationship between their titers:\n$$d_A < d_B \\implies \\frac{1}{d_A} > \\frac{1}{d_B} \\implies \\text{Titer}_A > \\text{Titer}_B$$\nThis shows that a higher $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer corresponds to a higher neutralization potency. The comparison of neutralizing activity between two sera can thus be formalized as the ratio of their titers. The fold difference in potency of Serum A relative to Serum B is given by the ratio:\n$$\\text{Fold Difference} = \\frac{\\text{Titer}_A}{\\text{Titer}_B}$$\nThis ratio quantifies how many times more potent Serum A is compared to Serum B.\n\n(iii) Computation of the Fold Difference.\nFollowing the logic established in parts (i) and (ii), we first calculate the titer for Serum B. Serum B achieves $R(d) = 0.5$ at a dilution of $1:40$. The dilution factor $d_B$ is:\n$$d_B = \\frac{1}{40}$$\nThe $\\text{PRNT}_{50}$ titer for Serum B, $\\text{Titer}_B$, is the reciprocal of $d_B$:\n$$\\text{Titer}_B = \\frac{1}{d_B} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{40}} = 40$$\nWe have already determined that $\\text{Titer}_A = 320$. The fold difference in neutralization potency of Serum A relative to Serum B is the ratio of their titers:\n$$\\text{Fold Difference} = \\frac{\\text{Titer}_A}{\\text{Titer}_B} = \\frac{320}{40} = 8$$\nThe problem requires this result rounded to three significant figures. The exact value is $8$, which is written as $8.00$ to convey three significant figures.

Since $\\rho = \\frac{R_A(C)}{R_B(C)} \\approx 21.82 > 1$, it is clear that $R_A(C) > R_B(C)$. Specifically, the residual infectivity for antibody $A$ is more than $21$ times greater than for antibody $B$. Therefore, antibody $B$, which exhibits a higher Hill coefficient (stronger cooperativity), provides substantially better protection at this concentration ($10$ times the $\\text{IC}_{50}$).
