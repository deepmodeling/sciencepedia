It is scientifically grounded in established principles of receptor pharmacology and immunology, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its formulation. No logical contradictions, factual unsoundness, or fatal ambiguities are present. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental process is the reversible binding of a ligand, Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), denoted as $L$, to a receptor, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), denoted as $R$. This interaction forms a receptor-ligand complex, $RL$. The process is assumed to have reached equilibrium and follows the law of mass action for a $1{:}1$ stoichiometry:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptor, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex. A lower $K_d$ value signifies a higher binding affinity.\n\nFractional receptor occupancy, denoted by $\\theta$, is the fraction of the total receptor population that is bound by the ligand at equilibrium. It is defined as:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} $$\nThe total receptor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL] $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of the known quantities $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of total receptor concentration to solve for the free receptor concentration, $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = [R]_{\\text{total}} - [RL] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the $K_d$ equation gives:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{([R]_{\\text{total}} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]} $$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the fractional occupancy, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}$.\n$$ K_d [RL] = ([R]_{\\text{total}} - [RL])[L] $$\n$$ K_d [RL] = [R]_{\\text{total}}[L] - [RL][L] $$\n$$ K_d [RL] + [RL][L] = [R]_{\\text{total}}[L] $$\n$$ [RL](K_d + [L]) = [R]_{\\text{total}}[L] $$\nDividing both sides by $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ and by $(K_d + [L])$ yields the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$ \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a $1{:}1$ binding system. The problem states we can assume the free ligand concentration $[L]$ is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration provided, which is $[L] = 200\\,\\text{nM}$. This assumption is valid when the total receptor concentration is much lower than the ligand concentration, which is typical in such biological systems.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nLigand concentration: $[L] = 200\\,\\text{nM}$\nDissociation constant at pH $6.0$: $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$\nDissociation constant at pH $7.4$: $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4} = 5\\,\\mu\\text{M}$\n\nBefore calculation, we must ensure all concentrations are in the same units.

At the acidic pH of $6.0$ inside the endosome, the fractional occupancy is high ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = 0.8000$). This indicates that IgG molecules internalized into the endosome bind efficiently to FcRn. This binding sequesters the IgG, protecting it from the default pathway of lysosomal degradation. Upon trafficking of the FcRn-IgG complex back to the cell surface, the environment shifts to the neutral pH of $7.4$. At this pH, the binding affinity drops dramatically (as shown by the much larger $K_d$), resulting in a very low fractional occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4} = 0.03846$). This causes the rapid dissociation and release of the IgG from FcRn back into the bloodstream. This pH-dependent cycle of binding and release is the precise mechanism by which FcRn salvages IgG from catabolism, thereby extending its circulatory half-life.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8000 & 0.03846 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2875966"}, {"introduction": "Building on the quantitative understanding of pH-dependent binding, we now explore its application in therapeutic antibody engineering.

If $K_{d,WT}^{pH6}$ is the wild-type constant and $K_{d,Mut}^{pH6}$ is the mutant constant, then $K_{d,Mut}^{pH6} = K_{d,WT}^{pH6} / 5$.\n7.  **Mutation Effect (Neutral pH):** The dissociation constant at $pH\\,7.4$, denoted $K_d^{pH7.4}$, remains unchanged. So, $K_{d,Mut}^{pH7.4} = K_{d,WT}^{pH7.4}$.\n8.  **Constant Parameters:** All other system parameters (endocytic rate, receptor abundance, etc.) are assumed to be constant.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing the established mechanism of FcRn-mediated IgG homeostasis. The provided binding equation is a standard model in biochemistry. The premises regarding the mutation's effects are specific, and the principles connecting binding to function (salvage and release) are biologically correct. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with no contradictions or ambiguities. It is a valid problem in immunology and biophysical chemistry. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe serum half-life of IgG is primarily determined by the efficiency of the FcRn salvage pathway, which protects it from lysosomal degradation. This process involves two critical, pH-dependent steps: binding in the acidic endosome and release at the neutral pH of the cell surface.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the effect on binding at endosomal $pH\\,6.0$.**\nThe problem states that the mutation causes the dissociation constant at $pH\\,6.0$ to decrease $5$-fold: $K_{d,Mut}^{pH6} = K_{d,WT}^{pH6} / 5$.\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is an inverse measure of binding affinity; a smaller $K_d$ corresponds to a stronger binding interaction. Therefore, the mutation increases the binding affinity of IgG for FcRn at the acidic pH of the endosome.\n\nWe now examine the effect on receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, using the given formula: $\\theta = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$.\nLet $[L_{endo}]$ be the concentration of free IgG in the endosome.\nThe occupancy for the wild-type IgG is $\\theta_{WT}^{pH6} = \\dfrac{[L_{endo}]}{[L_{endo}] + K_{d,WT}^{pH6}}$.\nThe occupancy for the mutant IgG is $\\theta_{Mut}^{pH6} = \\dfrac{[L_{endo}]}{[L_{endo}] + K_{d,Mut}^{pH6}} = \\dfrac{[L_{endo}]}{[L_{endo}] + (K_{d,WT}^{pH6}/5)}$.\n\nSince the denominator for the mutant, $[L_{endo}] + K_{d,WT}^{pH6}/5$, is smaller than the denominator for the wild-type, $[L_{endo}] + K_{d,WT}^{pH6}$, it follows that $\\theta_{Mut}^{pH6} > \\theta_{WT}^{pH6}$.\nThe problem states that salvage efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of occupancy at $pH\\,6.0$. Since the mutation increases this occupancy, it must also **increase the salvage efficiency**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect on release at plasma $pH\\,7.4$.**\nThe problem states that the dissociation constant at $pH\\,7.4$ is unchanged by the mutation: $K_{d,Mut}^{pH7.4} = K_{d,WT}^{pH7.4}$.\nEfficient recycling requires the IgG to dissociate from FcRn upon return to the cell surface to re-enter the plasma. This release is governed by the binding affinity at neutral pH. Since $K_d^{pH7.4}$ is unchanged, the binding affinity at $pH\\,7.4$ is also unchanged. The problem premise states that for the wild-type, binding is already weak enough for efficient release. As this characteristic is preserved in the mutant, the release step is **not impaired**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the effect on serum half-life.**\nThe serum half-life of an antibody is the time it takes for its concentration in the blood to reduce by half. This is inversely related to its clearance rate. The FcRn salvage pathway is the dominant mechanism that prevents clearance.\nWe have concluded:\n1.  The mutation increases salvage efficiency, meaning a larger fraction of endocytosed IgG is rescued from degradation.\n2.  The mutation does not impair the release of salvaged IgG back into circulation.\n\nA more efficient salvage process leads to a lower overall rate of degradation and clearance from the plasma. Consequently, the IgG molecule will persist in the circulation for a longer duration. Therefore, the **serum half-life increases**.\n\nCombining these findings, the mutation leads to an increase in salvage efficiency and an increase in serum half-life.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Salvage efficiency increases; serum half-life increases.**\nThis aligns perfectly with our derivation. Increased binding at $pH\\,6.0$ enhances salvage, and because release at $pH\\,7.4$ is unaffected, the net result is a longer half-life.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Salvage efficiency decreases; serum half-life decreases.**\nThis is incorrect. A decrease in $K_d^{pH6}$ signifies stronger, not weaker, binding. Stronger binding at $pH\\,6.0$ leads to increased, not decreased, salvage efficiency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Salvage efficiency increases; serum half-life decreases due to impaired release at $pH\\,7.4$.**\nThe first part is correct, but the second is not. Release impairment would occur if binding at $pH\\,7.4$ became stronger (i.e., if $K_d^{pH7.4}$ decreased). The problem explicitly states that $K_d^{pH7.4}$ is unchanged. Therefore, release is not impaired, and half-life does not decrease for this reason.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Salvage efficiency is unchanged; serum half-life is unchanged.**\nThis is incorrect. As derived, a $5$-fold change in $K_d$ at $pH\\,6.0$ will change the receptor occupancy, $\\theta^{pH6}$, unless the system is fully saturated ($[L] \\gg K_d$ and $\\theta \\approx 1$), a condition not stated and generally not assumed. A change in occupancy directly implies a change in salvage efficiency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Salvage efficiency increases; serum half-life is unchanged because recycling saturates completely.**\nThe first part is correct. The second part introduces an unsubstantiated assumption. If \"recycling saturates,\" it might imply that the salvage pathway has a maximum capacity. However, increasing the efficiency of capture into this pathway (higher $\\theta^{pH6}$) would still be expected to increase the total number of molecules salvaged per unit time, up to that capacity, thus increasing half-life. The conclusion that half-life remains unchanged contradicts the fundamental link between salvage efficiency and half-life unless very specific and unstated saturation conditions are met that would also likely contradict the premise that salvage efficiency increases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2876004"}, {"introduction": "The final step in our practical exploration is to bridge the gap between cellular mechanisms and systemic pharmacokinetics.
