The task is to numerically solve this ODE under several distinct conditions and extract specific metrics from the resulting time-series data. The model is scientifically grounded in fundamental principles of immunology and population dynamics. All parameters, initial conditions, and functional forms are explicitly provided, rendering the problem self-contained and solvable.\n\nThe core of the problem is the differential equation for the clonal population size, $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = r(t)\\,N(t)\\left(1-\\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right) - d\\,N(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes logistic growth, modulated by a time-varying effective proliferation rate $r(t)$, and a first-order death process with rate constant $d$. The initial condition is given as $N(0) = N_0$.\n\nTo solve this ODE, a numerical integration scheme is required. The problem specifies an \"explicit time-marching method.\" The most direct and simplest implementation of this is the Forward Euler method. Given a time step $\\Delta t$, the population size at time $t_{i+1} = t_i + \\Delta t$ is approximated from the value at time $t_i$ as:\n$$\nN(t_{i+1}) \\approx N(t_i) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\left. \\frac{dN}{dt} \\right|_{t=t_i}\n$$\nSubstituting the ODE, we obtain the discretized update rule:\n$$\nN_{i+1} = N_i + \\Delta t \\left[ r(t_i) N_i \\left(1 - \\frac{N_i}{K}\\right) - d N_i \\right]\n$$\nwhere $N_i = N(t_i)$. We will apply this rule iteratively, starting from $N_0$, over a discretized time grid from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\text{end}}$ with spacing $\\Delta t$. The small given time step $\\Delta t = 0.01$ ensures the stability and accuracy of this explicit method for the given system parameters.\n\nThe effective proliferation rate, $r(t)$, is a composite function defined as:\n$$\nr(t) = r_{\\max} \\, S(t) \\, M_{\\text{early}}(t) \\, M_{\\text{late}}(t)\n$$\nEach component must be calculated at each time step $t_i$:\n1.  **Antigen Stimulus $S(t)$**: This is a simple exponential decay, $S(t_i) = S_0 \\exp(-t_i/\\tau_A)$. The initial level $S_0$ is a parameter varied across test cases.\n2.  **Early Inhibition $M_{\\text{early}}(t)$**: This factor models CTLA-4 activity. It depends on an indicator function $u_{\\text{CTLA4}}(t)$ which is $1$ if CTLA-4 is active and $0$ otherwise. According to the problem, natural activity occurs for $t \\in [0, T_{\\text{priming}}]$. A therapeutic blockade, if applied, forces $u_{\\text{CTLA4}}(t)$ to $0$ during the specified blockade interval. The multiplicative factor is $M_{\\text{early}}(t_i) = (1 + \\alpha_{\\text{CTLA4}}\\,u_{\\text{CTLA4}}(t_i))^{-1}$.\n3.  **Late Inhibition $M_{\\text{late}}(t)$**: This factor models PD-1 activity. It similarly depends on an indicator $u_{\\text{PD1}}(t)$, which is naturally active for $t \\ge T_{\\text{PD1,onset}}$. Blockade forces $u_{\\text{PD1}}(t)$ to $0$ during its specified active window. The factor is $M_{\\text{late}}(t_i) = (1 + \\alpha_{\\text{PD1}}\\,u_{\\text{PD1}}(t_i))^{-1}$.\n\nAfter simulating the entire time course $N(t)$ for each test case, we must compute two output metrics:\n1.  **Peak Clonal Size ($N_{\\text{peak}}$)**: This is simply the maximum value attained by the population array, $N_{\\text{peak}} = \\max(\\{N_i\\})$.\n2.  **Post-Peak Contraction Rate ($c_{\\max}$)**: This metric requires careful calculation. First, we identify the time of the peak, $t_{\\text{peak}}$. Then, for all subsequent times $t_i \\ge t_{\\text{peak}}$ where the population $N_i$ is above a threshold $N_{\\text{thr}} = \\max(1, 0.01\\,N_{\\text{peak}})$, we calculate the instantaneous relative decline rate:\n$$\nc_i = \\frac{N_i - N_{i+1}}{\\Delta t \\cdot N_i}\n$$\nThe value of $c_{\\max}$ is the maximum non-negative rate found in this post-peak phase, consistent with the definition $c_{\\max}=\\max_{t\\in[t_{\\text{peak}},\\,T_{\\text{end}}-\\Delta t]}\\left\\{\\max\\left(0,\\,c(t)\\right)\\right\\}$.\n\nThe computational procedure is therefore: for each test case defined by a triplet $(S_0, \\text{CTLA4\\_block}, \\text{PD1\\_block})$, we execute the time-marching simulation to generate the full population trajectory $N(t)$, and then process this trajectory to find $N_{\\text{peak}}$ and $c_{\\max}$.
