The experimenters measure nuclear concentrations of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) and the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) component c-Fos at discrete time points. They assume c-Jun is not limiting, so nuclear c-Fos is proportional to nuclear AP-1, and AP-1 availability for NFAT:AP-1 heterodimerization can be taken as the nuclear c-Fos concentration. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) transcription requires cooperative NFAT:AP-1 binding at the promoter and is assumed to initiate only when the nuclear NFAT:AP-1 heterodimer concentration meets or exceeds a fixed threshold.\n\nUse the following scientifically grounded base:\n- NFAT enters the nucleus upon sustained calcium-calcineurin signaling, whereas AP-1 is produced via mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling; NFAT alone (without AP-1) preferentially drives anergy-associated gene expression rather than IL-2 transcription.\n- At rapid equilibrium, the NFAT:AP-1 heterodimer is formed by a reversible bimolecular association characterized by a dissociation constant $K_{d}$ defined by $K_{d} = \\dfrac{[\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{free}}}{[\\text{NFAT:AP-1}]}$.\n- The measured nuclear values are total concentrations of the respective species at each time, with conservation $[\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{free}} + [\\text{NFAT:AP-1}]$ and $[\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{free}} + [\\text{NFAT:AP-1}]$.\n\nData and parameters:\n- Nuclear NFAT concentrations (nanomolar, nM) at times $t = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40$ minutes are: $[\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{total}}(t) = 5, 40, 70, 90, 80$.\n- Nuclear c-Fos concentrations (nanomolar, nM), taken as $[\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{total}}(t)$, at the same times are: $[\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{total}}(t) = 1, 5, 10, 12, 8$.\n- The dissociation constant for NFAT:AP-1 in the nucleus is $K_{d} = 8$ nM.\n- The IL-2 transcriptional initiation threshold is $C_{\\text{th}} = 15$ nM of nuclear NFAT:AP-1 heterodimer.\n\nTask:\n- For each time point, compute the equilibrium nuclear NFAT:AP-1 heterodimer concentration $C(t) = [\\text{NFAT:AP-1}](t)$ from first principles using mass-action equilibrium and conservation.

It is valid.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe task is to determine the equilibrium concentration of the NFAT:AP-1 heterodimer, denoted by $C(t) = [\\text{NFAT:AP-1}](t)$, at several time points. We are given the total concentrations of NFAT and AP-1, which we denote as $N_{T}(t) = [\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{total}}(t)$ and $A_{T}(t) = [\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{total}}(t)$.\n\nThe equilibrium relationship is given by the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{free}}}{C(t)}$$\nThe conservation of mass for each species provides the following relations:\n$$[\\text{NFAT}]_{\\text{free}} = N_{T}(t) - C(t)$$\n$$[\\text{AP-1}]_{\\text{free}} = A_{T}(t) - C(t)$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the free concentrations into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(N_{T}(t) - C(t))(A_{T}(t) - C(t))}{C(t)}$$\nThis equation must be solved for $C(t)$. We rearrange it into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where the variable is $x = C(t)$.\n$$K_{d} C(t) = N_{T}(t)A_{T}(t) - N_{T}(t)C(t) - A_{T}(t)C(t) + C(t)^2$$\n$$C(t)^2 - (N_{T}(t) + A_{T}(t) + K_{d})C(t) + N_{T}(t)A_{T}(t) = 0$$\nThe solution to this quadratic equation is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{(N_{T}(t) + A_{T}(t) + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_{T}(t) + A_{T}(t) + K_{d})^2 - 4 N_{T}(t)A_{T}(t)}}{2}$$\nTwo solutions arise from the $\\pm$ sign. However, the concentration of the complex, $C(t)$, cannot exceed the total concentration of either of its components. That is, $C(t) \\le N_{T}(t)$ and $C(t) \\le A_{T}(t)$. The solution with the plus sign would lead to a concentration $C(t)$ that is greater than $N_{T}(t)$ or $A_{T}(t)$, which is physically impossible. Therefore, we must select the minus sign for the physically valid solution:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{(N_{T}(t) + A_{T}(t) + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(N_{T}(t) + A_{T}(t) + K_{d})^2 - 4 N_{T}(t)A_{T}(t)}}{2}$$\nWe now apply this formula to each time point using the provided data, with $K_{d} = 8$ nM.\n\nAt $t=0$ min: $N_{T}(0)=5$ nM, $A_{T}(0)=1$ nM.\n$$C(0) = \\frac{(5+1+8) - \\sqrt{(5+1+8)^2 - 4(5)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{14 - \\sqrt{196 - 20}}{2} = \\frac{14 - \\sqrt{176}}{2} = 7 - \\sqrt{44} \\approx 0.367 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nAt $t=10$ min: $N_{T}(10)=40$ nM, $A_{T}(10)=5$ nM.\n$$C(10) = \\frac{(40+5+8) - \\sqrt{(40+5+8)^2 - 4(40)(5)}}{2} = \\frac{53 - \\sqrt{2809 - 800}}{2} = \\frac{53 - \\sqrt{2009}}{2} \\approx 4.092 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nAt $t=20$ min: $N_{T}(20)=70$ nM, $A_{T}(20)=10$ nM.\n$$C(20) = \\frac{(70+10+8) - \\sqrt{(70+10+8)^2 - 4(70)(10)}}{2} = \\frac{88 - \\sqrt{7744 - 2800}}{2} = \\frac{88 - \\sqrt{4944}}{2} = 44 - \\sqrt{1236} \\approx 8.846 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nAt $t=30$ min: $N_{T}(30)=90$ nM, $A_{T}(30)=12$ nM.\n$$C(30) = \\frac{(90+12+8) - \\sqrt{(90+12+8)^2 - 4(90)(12)}}{2} = \\frac{110 - \\sqrt{12100 - 4320}}{2} = \\frac{110 - \\sqrt{7780}}{2} = 55 - \\sqrt{1945} \\approx 10.952 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nAt $t=40$ min: $N_{T}(40)=80$ nM, $A_{T}(40)=8$ nM.\n$$C(40) = \\frac{(80+8+8) - \\sqrt{(80+8+8)^2 - 4(80)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{96 - \\sqrt{9216 - 2560}}{2} = \\frac{96 - \\sqrt{6656}}{2} = 48 - \\sqrt{1664} \\approx 7.208 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nThe calculated concentrations of the NFAT:AP-1 heterodimer at the measured times are approximately $0.367$, $4.092$, $8.846$, $10.952$, and $7.208$ nM. The maximum concentration, $C_{\\max}$, occurs at $t=30$ min:\n$$C_{\\max} = C(30) = 55 - \\sqrt{1945} \\text{ nM}$$\n\nThe problem requires a decision on whether the IL-2 transcription threshold is crossed. This occurs if $C_{\\max} \\geq C_{\\text{th}}$, where $C_{\\text{th}} = 15$ nM. We must evaluate the inequality:\n$$55 - \\sqrt{1945} \\geq 15$$\nRearranging the inequality, we test if:\n$$40 \\geq \\sqrt{1945}$$\nSince both sides are positive, we can square them without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$40^2 \\geq 1945$$\n$$1600 \\geq 1945$$\nThis inequality is false. Thus, $C_{\\max}$ is less than $C_{\\text{th}}$. The concentration of the NFAT:AP-1 complex never reaches the $15$ nM threshold for IL-2 gene transcription at any of the measured time points.\n\nAccording to the problem's mapping rule, if a threshold is never crossed, the output must be $0$. This result is biologically consistent with the principle that insufficient cooperative binding of NFAT and AP-1, despite high levels of NFAT, can lead to T-cell anergy rather than activation.\n\nThe final numerical output is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2880715"}, {"introduction": "Once a T cell's fate is set by its internal signaling programs, it manifests as a distinct surface phenotype that immunologists can measure.

Since the two observations are independent, the likelihood function $L$ for the parameters $N_0$ and $\\kappa$, given the data $(n_1, n_2)$, is the product of the probabilities of each observation:\n$$L(N_0, \\kappa | n_1, n_2) = P(n_1; \\mu_1) \\times P(n_2; \\mu_2)$$\n$$L(N_0, \\kappa) = \\frac{\\mu_1^{n_1} \\exp(-\\mu_1)}{n_1!} \\times \\frac{\\mu_2^{n_2} \\exp(-\\mu_2)}{n_2!}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_1 = N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1)$ and $\\mu_2 = N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)$:\n$$L(N_0, \\kappa) = \\frac{(N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1))^{n_1} \\exp(-N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1))}{n_1!} \\times \\frac{(N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2))^{n_2} \\exp(-N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2))}{n_2!}$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimates, we maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell = \\ln(L)$, as it simplifies the mathematics.\n$$\\ell(N_0, \\kappa) = n_1 \\ln(N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1)) - N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1) - \\ln(n_1!) + n_2 \\ln(N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)) - N_0 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2) - \\ln(n_2!)$$\nCombining terms and dropping the constant parts (which do not depend on the parameters $N_0$ and $\\kappa$):\n$$\\ell(N_0, \\kappa) = n_1(\\ln N_0 - \\kappa t_1) + n_2(\\ln N_0 - \\kappa t_2) - N_0(\\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + \\exp(-\\kappa t_2))$$\n$$\\ell(N_0, \\kappa) = (n_1+n_2)\\ln N_0 - (n_1 t_1 + n_2 t_2)\\kappa - N_0(\\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + \\exp(-\\kappa t_2))$$\nTo find the parameters $(\\hat{N}_0, \\hat{\\kappa})$ that maximize $\\ell$, we take the partial derivatives with respect to $N_0$ and $\\kappa$ and set them to zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial N_0} = \\frac{n_1+n_2}{N_0} - (\\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial \\kappa} = -(n_1 t_1 + n_2 t_2) - N_0(-\\,t_1 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1) - t_2 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)) = 0$$\nFrom the first equation, we can express the MLE of $N_0$ in terms of $\\kappa$:\n$$\\hat{N}_0 = \\frac{n_1+n_2}{\\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $N_0$ into the second equation (set to zero):\n$$-(n_1 t_1 + n_2 t_2) + \\left(\\frac{n_1+n_2}{\\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)}\\right) (t_1 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + t_2 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)) = 0$$\nTo solve for $\\kappa$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$(n_1+n_2)(t_1 \\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + t_2 \\exp(-\\kappa t_2)) = (n_1 t_1 + n_2 t_2)(\\exp(-\\kappa t_1) + \\exp(-\\kappa t_2))$$\nExpanding both sides:\n$$n_1 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_1} + n_1 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_2} + n_2 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_1} + n_2 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_2} = n_1 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_1} + n_1 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_2} + n_2 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_1} + n_2 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_2}$$\nWe cancel identical terms from both sides ($n_1 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_1}$ and $n_2 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_2}$):\n$$n_1 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_2} + n_2 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_1} = n_1 t_1 e^{-\\kappa t_2} + n_2 t_2 e^{-\\kappa t_1}$$\nGroup terms containing $e^{-\\kappa t_1}$ and $e^{-\\kappa t_2}$:\n$$e^{-\\kappa t_1}(n_2 t_1 - n_2 t_2) = e^{-\\kappa t_2}(n_1 t_1 - n_1 t_2)$$\n$$n_2(t_1 - t_2)e^{-\\kappa t_1} = n_1(t_1 - t_2)e^{-\\kappa t_2}$$\nAssuming $t_1 \\neq t_2$, we divide both sides by $(t_1 - t_2)$:\n$$n_2 e^{-\\kappa t_1} = n_1 e^{-\\kappa t_2}$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\kappa$:\n$$\\frac{e^{-\\kappa t_1}}{e^{-\\kappa t_2}} = \\frac{n_1}{n_2}$$\n$$\\exp(\\kappa(t_2-t_1)) = \\frac{n_1}{n_2}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\kappa(t_2-t_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)$$\nThis yields the maximum likelihood estimator for $\\kappa$:\n$$\\hat{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\ln(n_1/n_2)}{t_2-t_1}$$\nThis is the general expression for the MLE of the rate constant $\\kappa$ for a two-time-point dataset.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two experimental conditions.\n\nFor the low Fas-signaling condition:\nThe data are $t_1=2$, $n_1=950$ and $t_2=5$, $n_2=600$.\n$$\\kappa_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{\\ln(950/600)}{5-2} = \\frac{\\ln(95/60)}{3} = \\frac{\\ln(19/12)}{3}$$\n\nFor the high Fas-signaling condition:\nThe data are $t_1=2$, $n_1=920$ and $t_2=5$, $n_2=380$.\n$$\\kappa_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{\\ln(920/380)}{5-2} = \\frac{\\ln(92/38)}{3} = \\frac{\\ln(46/19)}{3}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-increase in the AICD rate, defined as $F = \\kappa_{\\text{high}}/\\kappa_{\\text{low}}$.\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(46/19)}{3}}{\\frac{\\ln(19/12)}{3}} = \\frac{\\ln(46/19)}{\\ln(19/12)}$$\nWe now compute the numerical value for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\ln(2.42105\\ldots)}{\\ln(1.58333\\ldots)} \\approx \\frac{0.884140}{0.459532} \\approx 1.923983$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required gives $1.924$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.924}$$", "id": "2880664"}]}
