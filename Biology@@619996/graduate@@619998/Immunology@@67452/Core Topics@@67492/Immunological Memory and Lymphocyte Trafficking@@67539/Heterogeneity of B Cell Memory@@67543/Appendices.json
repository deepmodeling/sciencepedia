It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nThe binding of a soluble antigen, which acts as a ligand ($L$), to a B cell receptor ($R$) on the cell surface can be described as a reversible one-to-one reaction:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nwhere $RL$ represents the antigen-bound receptor complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction (association) is proportional to the concentrations of the free reactants, $k_{on}[R][L]$, and the rate of the reverse reaction (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $k_{off}[RL]$. Here, $k_{on}$ is the association rate constant and $k_{off}$ is the dissociation rate constant.\n\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$\nk_{on}[R][L] = k_{off}[RL]\n$$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant, and it can also be expressed in terms of the equilibrium concentrations:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nA lower $K_D$ value signifies a higher affinity of the receptor for its ligand, as a lower concentration of ligand is needed to occupy half of the receptors.\n\nThe receptor occupancy, which we will denote as $B$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound to the ligand at equilibrium. If $[R_T]$ is the total concentration of receptors, then:\n$$\nB = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}\n$$\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors, $[R]$, and bound receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the free receptor concentration as $[R] = [R_T] - [RL]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of $K_D$:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{([R_T] - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nThe problem states that the free antigen concentration, $[L]$, is well-approximated by the total antigen concentration, which is given as $30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$. This is a valid assumption when the ligand is in large molar excess compared to the total receptor concentration, as stated.\n\nTo derive the occupancy $B$ as a function of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we rearrange the equation. First, we can divide both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $[R_T]$:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}\\right)[L]}{\\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of occupancy, $B = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{(1 - B)[L]}{B}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression relating $K_D$, $[L]$, and $B$. We now solve for $B$:\n$$\nK_D \\cdot B = (1 - B)[L]\n$$\n$$\nK_D \\cdot B = [L] - B[L]\n$$\n$$\nK_D \\cdot B + B[L] = [L]\n$$\n$$\nB(K_D + [L]) = [L]\n$$\n$$\nB = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site, which is the expression for equilibrium receptor occupancy we were tasked to derive from first principles.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two B cell subsets, A and B.\nGiven data:\nDissociation constant for Subset A: $K_{D,A} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$\nDissociation constant for Subset B: $K_{D,B} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$\nFree antigen concentration: $[L] = 30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$\n\nFor Subset A, the equilibrium occupancy $B_A$ is:\n$$\nB_A = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D,A} + [L]} = \\frac{30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{10 \\, \\mathrm{nM} + 30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{30}{40} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n$$\n\nFor Subset B, the equilibrium occupancy $B_B$ is:\n$$\nB_B = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D,B} + [L]} = \\frac{30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{nM} + 30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{30}{130} = \\frac{3}{13}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold difference in occupancy, defined as the ratio $B_A / B_B$:\n$$\n\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{\\frac{3}{13}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{13}{3} = \\frac{13}{4} = 3.25\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the value is $3.250$.\n\nTo justify which subset is more likely to be activated, we must consider the biophysical meaning of occupancy. B cell activation requires the cross-linking of multiple BCRs, which initiates an intracellular signaling cascade. The magnitude of this initial signal is a function of the number of engaged receptors. This number is directly proportional to the receptor occupancy, $B$. A higher occupancy at a given antigen concentration translates to a stronger and more sustained signal.\n\nThe condition described, $[L] = 30 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$, represents an antigen-limiting environment, particularly for the low-affinity Subset B, as the antigen concentration is well below its $K_D$ of $100 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$. For Subset A, this concentration is above its $K_D$ of $10 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$. Consequently, Subset A achieves a high occupancy of $75\\%$, while Subset B achieves a much lower occupancy of approximately $23.1\\%$. The $3.25$-fold higher receptor occupancy for Subset A means that, for a given number of total receptors on a cell, a B cell from Subset A will have $3.25$ times more antigen-bound receptors than a B cell from Subset B. Assuming a common signaling threshold for activation (a minimum number of engaged receptors required to trigger a response), the high-affinity Subset A is significantly more likely to surpass this threshold and become activated. This principle of affinity-based selection is fundamental to the process of affinity maturation in germinal centers, where B cells with higher affinity BCRs are preferentially selected for survival and differentiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.250}$$", "id": "2853001"}, {"introduction": "Once activated, a B cell faces a crucial fate decision: differentiate into a terminally differentiated, antibody-secreting plasma cell or enter a developmental path toward becoming a long-lived memory cell.

Well-tested observations include: BCL6 is required for germinal center and memory fate and represses IRF4; IRF4 at sustained or high levels promotes Blimp-1 expression and plasma cell fate while repressing Bach2; Bach2 supports memory by promoting BCL6 and repressing Blimp-1; Blimp-1 antagonizes BCL6.

It is scientifically grounded as a standard modeling approach, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the formal analysis.\n\nThe system under consideration is a synchronous Boolean network with four nodes, denoted by the variables $B$, $I$, $A$, and $P$, each taking values in $\\{0, 1\\}$. A steady state is a state vector $(B, I, A, P)$ that remains unchanged by the application of the update rules. This condition translates to a system of four simultaneous Boolean equations:\n$$B = A \\land \\neg P \\quad (1)$$\n$$P = I \\land \\neg A \\quad (2)$$\n$$A = B \\land \\neg I \\quad (3)$$\n$$I = \\neg B \\quad (4)$$\nWe must find all state vectors $(B, I, A, P) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$ that satisfy these four equations. The most direct method is algebraic substitution.\n\nFrom equation $(4)$, the value of $I$ is determined exclusively by the value of $B$. We substitute this expression for $I$ into equation $(3)$:\n$$A = B \\land \\neg(\\neg B)$$\nBy the law of double negation in Boolean algebra, $\\neg(\\neg X) = X$ for any Boolean variable $X$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$A = B \\land B$$\nBy the idempotent law of conjunction, $X \\land X = X$. Therefore, we find a necessary condition for any steady state:\n$$A = B$$\nThis implies that in any steady state, the nodes $A$ and $B$ must have identical values.\n\nWe now have two variables, $A$ and $I$, expressed in terms of $B$: $A = B$ and $I = \\neg B$. We can use these relations to simplify the remaining equations. Let us substitute them into equation $(2)$:\n$$P = I \\land \\neg A$$\n$$P = (\\neg B) \\land (\\neg B)$$\nApplying the idempotent law again, we obtain:\n$$P = \\neg B$$\nThis result establishes that the value of $P$ is also determined solely by the value of $B$.\n\nAt this point, we have derived the following set of necessary conditions for any steady state:\n$$A = B$$\n$$I = \\neg B$$\n$$P = \\neg B$$\nThese relations imply that the entire state vector $(B, I, A, P)$ is defined by the value of the single variable $B$. To confirm that these relations are sufficient and self-consistent, we must substitute them back into the one remaining unused equation, equation $(1)$:\n$$B = A \\land \\neg P$$\n$$B = (B) \\land \\neg(\\neg B)$$\n$$B = B \\land B$$\n$$B = B$$\nThis equation reduces to a tautology, an identity that is true for any value of $B$. It imposes no additional constraints on $B$. Therefore, any state vector of the form $(B, \\neg B, B, \\neg B)$ is a valid steady state of the system.\n\nSince $B$ is a Boolean variable, it can assume two possible values, $0$ or $1$. Each value of $B$ defines a unique steady state.\n\nCase 1: $B = 0$.\nThe values of the other variables are:\n$I = \\neg 0 = 1$\n$A = 0$\n$P = \\neg 0 = 1$\nThis gives the steady state $(B, I, A, P) = (0, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\nCase 2: $B = 1$.\nThe values of the other variables are:\n$I = \\neg 1 = 0$\n$A = 1$\n$P = \\neg 1 = 0$\nThis gives the steady state $(B, I, A, P) = (1, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nWe have rigorously determined that the system possesses exactly two steady states. The next task is to classify them according to the given definitions:\n- Memory-phenotype steady state: $B=1$ and $P=0$.\n- Plasma-phenotype steady state: $B=0$ and $P=1$.\n\nLet us classify the two states we found:\n1. The steady state $(1, 0, 1, 0)$ has $B=1$ and $P=0$. This configuration precisely matches the definition of a memory-phenotype steady state.\n2. The steady state $(0, 1, 0, 1)$ has $B=0$ and $P=1$.

This term is not directly given and must be calculated using the law of total probability, as required by the problem statement.\n\nThe law of total probability allows us to express $P(T)$ by partitioning the sample space based on the true state of the cell ($D$ or $D^c$):\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nIn this expression, we have $P(T|D)$, $P(D)$, and $P(D^c)$. The term $P(T|D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the cell is not a classical memory B cell (a false positive). This is not the specificity. Specificity is $P(T^c|D^c)$. However, since a cell must either test positive or negative, we have:\n$$P(T|D^c) + P(T^c|D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + (1 - P(T^c|D^c))P(D^c)$$\nLet us use the symbolic representations: $Se = P(T|D)$, $Sp = P(T^c|D^c)$, and $p = P(D)$.
