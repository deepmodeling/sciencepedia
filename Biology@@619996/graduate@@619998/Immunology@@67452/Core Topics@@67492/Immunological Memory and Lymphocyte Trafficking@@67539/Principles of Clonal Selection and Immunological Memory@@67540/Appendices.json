The values provided for the total number of B cells and clonotypes are reasonable estimations for a model system. The concept of a fraction of the naive repertoire being able to respond to a given epitope is central to immunology. The assumption of a uniform distribution is an acceptable simplification for a theoretical problem of this nature.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A unique solution can be determined from the provided data.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a straightforward calculation based on the principles of immunology and probability. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of naive B cells that are \"recruitable\" for a specific epitope. These are the precursor cells for the primary immune response.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of naive B cells and $K$ be the total number of unique clonotypes.\nThe given values are:\n$$N = 10^{8}$$\n$$K = 10^{7}$$\n\nThe problem states that the naive B cells are distributed uniformly among the clonotypes. This is a critical piece of information. It means that each unique clonotype is represented by the same number of cells. Let us denote the number of cells per clonotype by $c$. This value is the total number of cells divided by the total number of clonotypes:\n$$c = \\frac{N}{K} = \\frac{10^{8}}{10^{7}} = 10$$\nSo, each clonotype consists of exactly $10$ cells.\n\nNext, we are given that a fraction $f$ of the clonotypes are \"recruitable\" for the given epitope, where:\n$$f = 10^{-5}$$\n\nThe total number of recruitable clonotypes, which we can denote as $K_{recruitable}$, is the product of the fraction $f$ and the total number of clonotypes $K$:\n$$K_{recruitable} = f \\times K = 10^{-5} \\times 10^{7} = 10^{2} = 100$$\nThus, there are $100$ unique clonotypes capable of responding to the epitope.\n\nThe total number of naive precursor cells available for the response is the number of recruitable clonotypes multiplied by the number of cells per clonotype. Let us denote this quantity by $N_{precursor}$:\n$$N_{precursor} = K_{recruitable} \\times c$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{recruitable}$ and $c$:\n$$N_{precursor} = (f \\times K) \\times \\left(\\frac{N}{K}\\right)$$\nThe term $K$ for the total number of clonotypes cancels out, which simplifies the expression to:\n$$N_{precursor} = f \\times N$$\n\nThis result is intuitive. Because the cells are uniformly distributed across clonotypes, the fraction of recruitable *cells* in the total population is identical to the fraction of recruitable *clonotypes* in the repertoire.\n\nThe problem also requests the derivation from probabilistic principles, specifically linearity of expectation. We can formalize this as follows. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of recruitable cells. We can express $X$ as the sum of $N$ indicator variables, $X_i$, for each cell $i = 1, 2, ..., N$:\n$$X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nwhere $X_i = 1$ if cell $i$ is recruitable, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe expected value of $X$ is, by linearity of expectation:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable $E[X_i]$ is the probability that the event it indicates occurs. In this case, it is the probability $p$ that a randomly selected cell is recruitable.\n$$E[X_i] = P(X_i = 1) = p$$\nDue to the uniform distribution of cells among clonotypes, the probability that a randomly chosen cell belongs to a recruitable clonotype is simply the fraction of such clonotypes, which is $f$. Thus, $p = f$.\nSubstituting this into the sum:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f = N \\times f$$\nThis confirms our previous, more direct derivation. The expected number of naive precursor cells is indeed the product of the total number of naive cells and the fraction of recruitable clonotypes.\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation using the given values:\n$$E[X] = N \\times f = 10^{8} \\times 10^{-5} = 10^{(8-5)} = 10^{3}$$\nThe expected number of precursor cells is $1000$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of somatic hypermutation used in theoretical immunology and requires a rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nWe are asked to derive the probability distribution for the total number of mutations, $N$, accumulated in a B-cell descendant after a sequence of $k$ divisions. The derivation must proceed from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nLet $X_i$ be the random variable representing the number of mutations occurring during the $i$-th division, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\nAccording to the problem statement, each $X_i$ is an independent random variable following a Poisson distribution with a mean rate parameter $\\mu$.\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for each $X_i$ is therefore given by:\n$$P(X_i = n) = \\frac{\\mu^n \\exp(-\\mu)}{n!}$$\nfor any non-negative integer $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe total number of accumulated mutations, $N$, after $k$ divisions is the sum of the mutations from each individual division. Thus, we define $N$ as:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i$$\nThe problem requires that we do not use the pre-stated result concerning the sum of independent Poisson random variables. Therefore, we will derive the PMF of $N$ using the principle of mathematical induction on the number of divisions, $k$.\n\nLet $P_k(m)$ denote the probability $P(N = m)$ after $k$ divisions. We wish to find a closed-form expression for $P_k(m)$. Let our inductive hypothesis, $\\mathcal{H}(k)$, be the statement that the sum of $k$ such variables, $N_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i$, follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $k\\mu$. That is:\n$$\\mathcal{H}(k): P(N_k = m) = \\frac{(k\\mu)^m \\exp(-k\\mu)}{m!}$$\n\nBase Case: For $k=1$, the total number of mutations is $N_1 = X_1$. The distribution of $N_1$ is given directly as a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\mu$.\n$$P(N_1 = m) = P(X_1 = m) = \\frac{\\mu^m \\exp(-\\mu)}{m!}$$\nOur formula for $\\mathcal{H}(1)$ gives $\\frac{(1 \\cdot \\mu)^m \\exp(-1 \\cdot \\mu)}{m!} = \\frac{\\mu^m \\exp(-\\mu)}{m!}$. Thus, the base case $\\mathcal{H}(1)$ is true.\n\nInductive Step: Assume that the hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}(k-1)$ is true for some integer $k-1 \\ge 1$. This means the total number of mutations after $k-1$ divisions, $N_{k-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} X_i$, follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $(k-1)\\mu$:\n$$P(N_{k-1} = j) = \\frac{((k-1)\\mu)^j \\exp(-(k-1)\\mu)}{j!}$$\nWe must now show that $\\mathcal{H}(k)$ is true. The total number of mutations after $k$ divisions is $N_k = N_{k-1} + X_k$. Since all $X_i$ are independent, the random variable $N_{k-1}$ (which is a function of $X_1, \\dots, X_{k-1}$) is independent of $X_k$.\n\nTo find the PMF of $N_k$, we compute $P(N_k = m)$. This event occurs if $N_{k-1}$ takes on some value $j$ and $X_k$ takes on the value $m-j$, where $j$ can be any integer from $0$ to $m$. We sum over all possible values of $j$:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m} P(N_{k-1} = j \\text{ and } X_k = m-j)$$\nDue to the independence of $N_{k-1}$ and $X_k$, we can write this as a convolution sum:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m} P(N_{k-1} = j) P(X_k = m-j)$$\nWe now substitute the PMF for $X_k$ and the PMF for $N_{k-1}$ from our inductive hypothesis:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\left( \\frac{((k-1)\\mu)^j \\exp(-(k-1)\\mu)}{j!} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu^{m-j} \\exp(-\\mu)}{(m-j)!} \\right)$$\nWe can factor out terms that are constant with respect to the summation index $j$:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\exp(-(k-1)\\mu) \\exp(-\\mu) \\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\frac{((k-1)\\mu)^j \\mu^{m-j}}{j!(m-j)!}$$\nThe exponential terms combine to $\\exp(-k\\mu)$. To simplify the sum, we multiply and divide by $m!$:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\frac{\\exp(-k\\mu)}{m!} \\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\frac{m!}{j!(m-j)!} ((k-1)\\mu)^j \\mu^{m-j}$$\nThe term $\\frac{m!}{j!(m-j)!}$ is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m}{j}$. The expression becomes:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\frac{\\exp(-k\\mu)}{m!} \\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} ((k-1)\\mu)^j \\mu^{m-j}$$\nThe sum is an application of the binomial theorem, which states that $(a+b)^m = \\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} a^j b^{m-j}$. In our case, $a = (k-1)\\mu$ and $b = \\mu$. Therefore, the sum is:\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} ((k-1)\\mu)^j \\mu^{m-j} = ((k-1)\\mu + \\mu)^m = (k\\mu)^m$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $P(N_k = m)$:\n$$P(N_k = m) = \\frac{\\exp(-k\\mu)}{m!} (k\\mu)^m = \\frac{(k\\mu)^m \\exp(-k\\mu)}{m!}$$\nThis is precisely the statement of $\\mathcal{H}(k)$. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, the total number of mutations $N$ after $k$ divisions follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $k\\mu$.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form analytic expression for this probability, which is the PMF of a Poisson distribution with mean $k\\mu$, evaluated at $m$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(k\\mu)^{m} \\exp(-k\\mu)}{m!}}$$", "id": "2883795"}, {"introduction": "The processes of clonal selection and expansion leave a distinct signature on the responding lymphocyte population, drastically altering its composition.

It is a valid problem. Proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two indices of diversity for two time points, based on clonotype frequencies derived from sequencing read counts.\n\nFirst, we define the clonotype frequencies, $p_i$, for each time point using the given formula $p_i = n_i / N$, where $n_i$ is the read count for clonotype $i$ and $N$ is the total number of reads at that time point.\n\n**Analysis for Day $0$:**\nThe total number of clonotypes is $S=8$.\nThe total number of reads is $N_0 = 800$.\nThe read counts for all $8$ clonotypes are identical: $n_{i,0} = 100$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 8\\}$.\nThe frequency for each clonotype is therefore uniform:\n$$p_{i,0} = \\frac{n_{i,0}}{N_0} = \\frac{100}{800} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\n\nNow, we calculate the Shannon diversity, $H_0$. The formula is $H_0 = -\\sum_{i=1}^{8} p_{i,0} \\ln(p_{i,0})$.\nSince all frequencies are equal, the formula simplifies significantly:\n$$H_0 = -\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -8 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\ln(8)$$\nThe numerical value is $\\ln(8) \\approx 2.07944$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $2.079$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Simpson concentration index, $\\lambda_0$. The formula is $\\lambda_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} p_{i,0}^2$.\nAgain, with uniform frequencies:\n$$\\lambda_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 = 8 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right) = \\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.1250$.\n\n**Analysis for Day $14$:**\nThe total number of clonotypes is $S=8$.\nThe total number of reads is $N_{14} = 2000$.\nThe read counts are $\\{800, 400, 200, 200, 100, 100, 100, 100\\}$.\nWe calculate the frequency for each clonotype:\n$p_{1,14} = \\frac{800}{2000} = 0.4$\n$p_{2,14} = \\frac{400}{2000} = 0.2$\n$p_{3,14} = \\frac{200}{2000} = 0.1$\n$p_{4,14} = \\frac{200}{2000} = 0.1$\n$p_{5,14} = \\frac{100}{2000} = 0.05$\n$p_{6,14} = \\frac{100}{2000} = 0.05$\n$p_{7,14} = \\frac{100}{2000} = 0.05$\n$p_{8,14} = \\frac{100}{2000} = 0.05$\n\nWe calculate the Shannon diversity, $H_{14} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{8} p_{i,14} \\ln(p_{i,14})$.\n$$H_{14} = - \\left[ (0.4 \\ln(0.4)) + (0.2 \\ln(0.2)) + 2(0.1 \\ln(0.1)) + 4(0.05 \\ln(0.05)) \\right]$$\nSubstituting the values of the natural logarithms:\n$H_{14} \\approx - \\left[ (0.4 \\times -0.91629) + (0.2 \\times -1.60944) + 2(0.1 \\times -2.30259) + 4(0.05 \\times -2.99573) \\right]$\n$H_{14} \\approx - \\left[ -0.366516 - 0.321888 - 0.460518 - 0.599146 \\right]$\n$H_{14} \\approx -(-1.748068) = 1.748068$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $1.748$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the Simpson concentration index, $\\lambda_{14} = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} p_{i,14}^2$.\n$$\\lambda_{14} = (0.4)^2 + (0.2)^2 + 2(0.1)^2 + 4(0.05)^2$$\n$$\\lambda_{14} = 0.16 + 0.04 + 2(0.01) + 4(0.0025)$$\n$$\\lambda_{14} = 0.16 + 0.04 + 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.23$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.2300$.\n\n**Interpretation of Results:**\n- **Shannon Diversity ($H$):** This index measures the uncertainty in predicting the identity of a randomly chosen clonotype. It is maximized when all clonotypes have equal frequency. The value decreased from $H_0 \\approx 2.079$ to $H_{14} \\approx 1.748$. This decrease signifies a reduction in population evenness. The repertoire has become less diverse because a few clonotypes now dominate.\n- **Simpson Concentration Index ($\\lambda$):** This index measures the probability that two randomly selected clonotypes are identical. It is minimized for an even distribution and approaches $1$ as a single clonotype dominates. The value increased from $\\lambda_0 = 0.1250$ to $\\lambda_{14} = 0.2300$. This increase indicates that the population has become more concentrated, or dominated by a smaller number of high-frequency clonotypes.\n\nThe direction of change in both indices is consistent with the process of clonal selection. The initial, relatively even B cell population (high $H$, low $\\lambda$) was exposed to an antigen. This triggered the preferential and massive proliferation of those clones with B cell receptors that bind the antigen with high affinity. The result is a post-immunization repertoire (Day $14$) that is skewed, with a few clonotypes having greatly expanded to high frequencies, leading to lower evenness (lower $H$) and higher dominance (higher $\\lambda$).\n\nThe computed values are compiled in the required order.\n1.
