Neutrophils from healthy donors and from patients with Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type II (LAD II; a guanosine diphosphate-fucose transporter defect that markedly reduces fucosylation of selectin ligands) are perfused at steady wall shear stress. Assume the following, which are consistent with widely used two-dimensional (2D) binding kinetics under flow and with the known biology of the leukocyte adhesion cascade.\n\n- The wall shear stress is such that the instantaneous neutrophil contact patch area with the substrate is approximately $A_c = 5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$.

Engagement of E-selectin during rolling increases the high-affinity fraction in rolling healthy cells by approximately a threefold factor, to $f_{\\text{HI}}^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx 0.15$, via inside-out signaling, whereas in LAD II cells lacking effective E-selectin engagement the fraction remains low, $f_{\\text{HI}}^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx 0.02$.\n- The effective 2D on-rate and off-rate for high-affinity LFA-1:ICAM-1 binding are $k_{\\text{on}}^{I} = 8\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}^{I} = 0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, respectively.\n- Use the standard 2D mass-action approximation for quasi-steady bonds in a contact patch: the expected concurrent number of bonds of a given class is $n \\approx \\dfrac{k_{\\text{on}}\\,m_{\\text{ligand}}\\,m_{\\text{receptor}}\\,A_c}{k_{\\text{off}}}$.

It is a well-formulated, quantitative problem grounded in established biophysical principles. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis requires separate calculations for healthy and Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type II (LAD II) neutrophils.\n\n**1. Healthy Neutrophils**\n\nFirst, calculate the expected number of E-selectin bonds, $n_E^{\\text{healthy}}$, which determines rolling behavior. The receptor is E-selectin on the substrate and the ligand is on the neutrophil.\n$$n_E^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx \\dfrac{k_{\\text{on}}^{E}\\,m_{L}^{\\text{healthy}}\\,m_{E}\\,A_c}{k_{\\text{off}}^{E}}$$\n$$n_E^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx \\dfrac{(5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1})\\,(5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(10\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2)}{1\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.25$$\nWith $n_E^{\\text{healthy}} = 1.25$ bonds, the mean rolling velocity, $v_r^{\\text{healthy}}$, is:\n$$v_r^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx \\dfrac{v_{\\text{free}}}{1 + n_E^{\\text{healthy}}} = \\dfrac{v_{\\text{free}}}{1 + 1.25} = \\dfrac{v_{\\text{free}}}{2.25} \\approx 0.444\\,v_{\\text{free}}$$\nNext, calculate the expected number of high-affinity LFA-1:ICAM-1 bonds, $n_I^{\\text{healthy}}$, which determines firm arrest. The effective density of high-affinity LFA-1 receptors on the rolling healthy neutrophil is:\n$$m_{\\text{LFA-HI}}^{\\text{healthy}} = m_{\\text{LFA}} \\times f_{\\text{HI}}^{\\text{healthy}} = (50\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times 0.15 = 7.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}$$\nNow, we calculate $n_I^{\\text{healthy}}$:\n$$n_I^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx \\dfrac{k_{\\text{on}}^{I}\\,m_{\\text{LFA-HI}}^{\\text{healthy}}\\,m_{\\text{ICAM}}\\,A_c}{k_{\\text{off}}^{I}}$$\n$$n_I^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx \\dfrac{(8\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1})\\,(7.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(20\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2)}{0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.2$$\nThe probability of firm arrest is calculated using the Poisson model with mean $\\lambda = n_I^{\\text{healthy}} = 1.2$:\n$$P_{\\text{arrest}}^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx 1 - e^{-1.2}(1 + 1.2) = 1 - 2.2 \\times e^{-1.2}$$\nUsing $e^{-1.2} \\approx 0.3012$,\n$$P_{\\text{arrest}}^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx 1 - 2.2 \\times 0.3012 \\approx 1 - 0.6626 = 0.3374$$\nSo, for healthy neutrophils: rolling velocity is approximately $44\\%$ of free-stream velocity, and arrest probability is approximately $34\\%$.\n\n**2. LAD II Neutrophils**\n\nThe same calculations are performed for LAD II cells, using their specific parameters. The number of E-selectin bonds, $n_E^{\\text{LAD}}$, is:\n$$n_E^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx \\dfrac{k_{\\text{on}}^{E}\\,m_{L}^{\\text{LAD}}\\,m_{E}\\,A_c}{k_{\\text{off}}^{E}}$$\n$$n_E^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx \\dfrac{(5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1})\\,(0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(10\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2)}{1\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.025$$\nThis very low number of bonds results in a rolling velocity close to the free-stream velocity:\n$$v_r^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx \\dfrac{v_{\\text{free}}}{1 + n_E^{\\text{LAD}}} = \\dfrac{v_{\\text{free}}}{1 + 0.025} = \\dfrac{v_{\\text{free}}}{1.025} \\approx 0.9756\\,v_{\\text{free}}$$\nFor arrest, the effective density of high-affinity LFA-1 is much lower due to the lack of selectin-mediated signaling:\n$$m_{\\text{LFA-HI}}^{\\text{LAD}} = m_{\\text{LFA}} \\times f_{\\text{HI}}^{\\text{LAD}} = (50\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times 0.02 = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}$$\nThe expected number of integrin bonds, $n_I^{\\text{LAD}}$, is:\n$$n_I^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx \\dfrac{k_{\\text{on}}^{I}\\,m_{\\text{LFA-HI}}^{\\text{LAD}}\\,m_{\\text{ICAM}}\\,A_c}{k_{\\text{off}}^{I}}$$\n$$n_I^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx \\dfrac{(8\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1})\\,(1\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(20\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2})\\,(5\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2)}{0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.16$$\nThe probability of firm arrest is calculated with $\\lambda = n_I^{\\text{LAD}} = 0.16$:\n$$P_{\\text{arrest}}^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx 1 - e^{-0.16}(1 + 0.16) = 1 - 1.16 \\times e^{-0.16}$$\nUsing $e^{-0.16} \\approx 0.8521$,\n$$P_{\\text{arrest}}^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx 1 - 1.16 \\times 0.8521 \\approx 1 - 0.9885 = 0.0115$$\nSo, for LAD II neutrophils: motion is near free-stream velocity ($\\approx 97.6\\%$ of $v_{\\text{free}}$), and arrest probability is approximately $1.2\\%$.\n\n**3. Transmigration**\nFor both cell types, the problem states that necessary components for transmigration are absent, so it is negligible.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Healthy neutrophils exhibit slow rolling with mean $v_r \\approx 0.44\\,v_{\\text{free}}$ and approximately $20\\%$ firm arrest; LAD II neutrophils show near free-stream motion with $\\approx 2.5\\%$ rolling and $\\approx 1\\%$ arrest; transmigration is negligible in both.**\n- Healthy rolling velocity: My calculation is $v_r^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx 0.444\\,v_{\\text{free}}$. The option states $\\approx 0.44\\,v_{\\text{free}}$. This is a match.\n- Healthy arrest probability: My calculation is $\\approx 34\\%$. The option states $\\approx 20\\%$. This is a quantitative discrepancy, but both values represent significant arrest.\n- LAD II motion: My calculation is $v_r^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx 0.976\\,v_{\\text{free}}$. This is \"near free-stream motion\". The phrase \"$\\approx 2.5\\%$ rolling\" is unconventional but can be interpreted as a $2.5\\%$ reduction from free-stream velocity ($1 - 0.975 = 0.025$), which is consistent with my calculation.\n- LAD II arrest probability: My calculation is $\\approx 1.2\\%$. The option states $\\approx 1\\%$. This is an excellent match.\n- Transmigration: My analysis shows it is negligible for both. This matches the option.\nDespite the discrepancy in healthy arrest probability, this option correctly captures all qualitative behaviors and matches three of the four key quantitative predictions very well.\nVerdict: **Correct**. It is the best description among the choices.\n\n**B. Healthy and LAD II neutrophils roll equivalently because ICAM-1 supports rolling; LAD II arrest is higher due to compensatory integrin use; transmigration is high in LAD II.**\n- Rolling equivalence: My calculations show $v_r^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx 0.44\\,v_{\\text{free}}$ while $v_r^{\\text{LAD}} \\approx 0.98\\,v_{\\text{free}}$. They are not equivalent.\n- Reason for rolling: The model provided bases rolling velocity solely on $n_E$, not ICAM-1 bonds.\n- LAD II arrest: My calculations show LAD II arrest ($\\approx 1.2\\%$) is far lower than healthy arrest ($\\approx 34\\%$), not higher.\n- Transmigration: The problem states it is negligible.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. Every claim is contradicted by the calculations and problem statement.\n\n**C. Healthy neutrophils do not roll because E-selectin alone cannot mediate rolling without P-selectin; LAD II neutrophils roll normally but fail to arrest; transmigration equals healthy.**\n- Healthy rolling: The premise that E-selectin alone cannot mediate rolling is biologically false and contradicts the problem's own model, which predicts robust rolling ($v_r^{\\text{healthy}} \\approx 0.44\\,v_{\\text{free}}$).\n- LAD II rolling: LAD II cells move at near-free stream velocity, which is not \"normal rolling\".\n- Arrest and Transmigration: The claims that LAD II fails to arrest and transmigration is equal for both are correct, but the primary premises about rolling are fundamentally flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Healthy and LAD II behave similarly because E-selectin recognition depends on sialic acid rather than fucose; both roll and arrest comparably; transmigration is absent in both.**\n- Reason for similarity: The statement that E-selectin recognition does not depend on fucose is factually incorrect; the sLe$^x$ ligand requires fucose. The entire problem is based on the functional consequence of its absence in LAD II.\n- Behavioral similarity: My calculations show drastically different rolling and arrest behavior for healthy versus LAD II cells. They are not comparable.\n- Transmigration: The claim that transmigration is absent is correct.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.

The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe problem requires the formulation and analysis of a model for the surface density of P-selectin, $P(t)$, on an endothelial cell following stimulation. The model is based on the principles of conservation of mass and first-order reaction kinetics.\n\n### 1. Formulation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)\n\nLet $P(t)$ be the surface density (molecules/$\\mu\\text{m}^2$) and $R(t)$ be the density of the releasable intracellular store (molecules/$\\mu\\text{m}^2$) at time $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe change in the releasable store $R(t)$ is governed solely by exocytosis, which depletes it. The rate of this process is first-order in $R(t)$ with rate constant $k_{\\text{exo}}$. For $t \\ge 0$, the stimulus $u(t)=1$, so the ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -k_{\\text{exo}} R(t) $$\n\nThe change in the surface density $P(t)$ is the result of two competing processes: exocytosis, which increases $P(t)$, and endocytosis, which decreases it. The exocytosis flux is $k_{\\text{exo}}R(t)$, and the endocytosis flux is first-order in $P(t)$ with rate constant $k_{\\text{endo}}$, given by $k_{\\text{endo}}P(t)$. The conservation of mass for $P(t)$ thus yields:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\text{exo}} R(t) - k_{\\text{endo}} P(t) $$\n\nThis gives the system of coupled linear first-order ODEs for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = -k_{\\text{exo}}\\,R(t), \\quad R(0) = S \\\\\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\text{exo}}\\,R(t) - k_{\\text{endo}}\\,P(t), \\quad P(0) = P_0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### 2. Analytical Solution of the ODEs\n\nFirst, we solve for $R(t)$. The equation for $R(t)$ is a standard exponential decay model. Its solution is:\n$$ R(t) = S \\, e^{-k_{\\text{exo}}t} $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $R(t)$ into the equation for $P(t)$ gives a linear first-order non-homogeneous ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} + k_{\\text{endo}}P(t) = k_{\\text{exo}} S \\, e^{-k_{\\text{exo}}t} $$\n\nThis equation is solved using an integrating factor, $I(t) = e^{\\int k_{\\text{endo}} dt} = e^{k_{\\text{endo}}t}$. The solution process depends on whether the rate constants $k_{\\text{exo}}$ and $k_{\\text{endo}}$ are distinct or equal.\n\n**Case 1: $k_{\\text{exo}} \\ne k_{\\text{endo}}$**\nMultiplying the ODE by the integrating factor and integrating yields:\n$$ P(t) e^{k_{\\text{endo}}t} = \\int k_{\\text{exo}} S e^{(k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}})t} dt = \\frac{k_{\\text{exo}}S}{k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}}} e^{(k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}})t} + C $$\nUsing the initial condition $P(0)=P_0$, the integration constant $C$ is found to be $C = P_0 - \\frac{k_{\\text{exo}}S}{k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}}}$. Substituting $C$ and solving for $P(t)$ gives the solution:\n$$ P(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{exo}}S}{k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}}} e^{-k_{\\text{exo}}t} + \\left(P_0 - \\frac{k_{\\text{exo}}S}{k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}}}\\right) e^{-k_{\\text{endo}}t} $$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$ P(t) = P_0 e^{-k_{\\text{endo}}t} + \\frac{k_{\\text{exo}}S}{k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}}} \\left( e^{-k_{\\text{exo}}t} - e^{-k_{\\text{endo}}t} \\right) $$\n\n**Case 2: $k_{\\text{exo}} = k_{\\text{endo}} = k$**\nIn this boundary case, the exponential term in the integral becomes $e^0=1$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(P(t)e^{kt}) = kS $$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$ P(t)e^{kt} = kSt + C $$\nUsing the initial condition $P(0)=P_0$, we find $C=P_0$. The solution for $P(t)$ is therefore:\n$$ P(t) = (P_0 + kSt)e^{-kt} $$\n\n### 3. Computation of Observables and Determination of $t_{\\text{peak}}$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of $P(t)$ at two time points, $t_1$ and $t_2$, and the time of peak surface expression, $t_{\\text{peak}}$.\n\nValues for $P(t_1)$ and $P(t_2)$ are found by direct substitution into the appropriate analytical solution for $P(t)$ derived above.\n\nThe peak time $t_{\\text{peak}}$ is the value of $t \\ge 0$ that maximizes $P(t)$.

The derivative of $P(t)$ at $t=0$ determines the initial behavior:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = k_{\\text{exo}}R(0) - k_{\\text{endo}}P(0) = k_{\\text{exo}}S - k_{\\text{endo}}P_0 $$\n- If $k_{\\text{exo}}S - k_{\\text{endo}}P_0 \\le 0$, the function $P(t)$ is non-increasing for $t \\ge 0$ (as $P(t)$ must eventually decay to $0$). The maximum value is at $t=0$, so $t_{\\text{peak}}=0$. This condition correctly handles edge cases such as $S=0$ or $k_{\\text{exo}}=0$.\n- If $k_{\\text{exo}}S - k_{\\text{endo}}P_0 > 0$, the function initially increases, guaranteeing a peak exists for $t_{\\text{peak}}>0$.\n\nAs stipulated, $t_{\\text{peak}}$ is determined numerically by finding the root of the function $f(t) = \\frac{dP}{dt}(t)$ using a bisection method. The function $f(t)$ can be written in a self-contained form by differentiating the analytical solutions for $P(t)$:\n- For $k_{\\text{exo}} \\ne k_{\\text{endo}}$:\n  $$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = -k_{\\text{endo}}P_0 e^{-k_{\\text{endo}}t} + \\frac{k_{\\text{exo}}S}{k_{\\text{endo}}-k_{\\text{exo}}}(-k_{\\text{exo}}e^{-k_{\\text{exo}}t} + k_{\\text{endo}}e^{-k_{\\text{endo}}t}) $$\n- For $k_{\\text{exo}} = k_{\\text{endo}} = k$:\n  $$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = (kS - kP_0 - k^2St)e^{-kt} $$\n\nThe root-finding algorithm proceeds as follows: if a peak is expected ($k_{\\text{exo}}S - k_{\\text{endo}}P_0 > 0$), we establish a search bracket $[a, b]$ where $f(a)>0$ and $f(b)<0$. We set $a=0$ (since $f(0)>0$) and find a suitable $b$ by starting with $b=1$ and doubling it until $f(b)<0$. The bisection algorithm is then applied to this bracket to find the root with high precision.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the P-selectin dynamics problem for a suite of test cases.\n    It calculates P(t) at two time points and the time of peak expression,\n    then prints the results in the specified format.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test cases: (k_exo, k_endo, S, P0, t1, t2)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: General distinct rates, negligible baseline\n        (0.05, 0.01, 1000.0, 0.0, 60.0, 300.0),\n        # Case B: Boundary equal rates\n        (0.02, 0.02, 500.0, 50.0, 60.0, 300.0),\n        # Case C: Endocytosis faster than exocytosis, nonzero baseline\n        (0.01, 0.05, 800.0, 200.0, 60.0, 300.0),\n        # Case D: Empty store edge case\n        (0.10, 0.02, 0.0, 300.0, 60.0, 300.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        results.append(calculate_observables(*params))\n\n    # Format the final output string as per requirements (no spaces).\n    inner_strings = []\n    for res in results:\n        # Format each value to exactly three decimal places.\n        inner_s = \",\".join([f\"{v:.3f}\" for v in res])\n        inner_strings.append(f\"[{inner_s}]\")\n    \n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(inner_strings)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\ndef calculate_observables(k_exo, k_endo, S, P0, t1, t2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates P(t1), P(t2), and t_peak for a given set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define a function for the P-selectin surface density P(t)\n    def p_surface(t):\n        if np.isclose(k_exo, k_endo):\n            k = k_exo\n            if t  0: return P0\n            return (P0 + k * S * t) * np.exp(-k * t)\n        else:\n            if t  0: return P0\n            coeff = (k_exo * S) / (k_endo - k_exo)\n            return P0 * np.exp(-k_endo * t) + coeff * (np.exp(-k_exo * t) - np.exp(-k_endo * t))\n\n    # Define a function for the derivative dP/dt\n    def dp_dt(t):\n        if np.isclose(k_exo, k_endo):\n            k = k_exo\n            if k == 0: return 0.0\n            return np.exp(-k * t) * (k * S - k * P0 - k**2 * S * t)\n        else:\n            # This handles k_exo=0 implicitly as S=0 or k_exo=0 both lead to t_peak=0\n            # via the initial slope check.\n            term1 = -k_endo * P0 * np.exp(-k_endo * t)\n            coeff = (k_exo * S) / (k_endo - k_exo)\n            term2 = coeff * (-k_exo * np.exp(-k_exo * t) + k_endo * np.exp(-k_endo * t))\n            return term1 + term2\n\n    # Calculate t_peak\n    t_peak = 0.0\n    initial_slope = k_exo * S - k_endo * P0\n    \n    # A peak exists for t > 0 only if the initial slope is positive.\n    # A small tolerance is used for floating-point comparison.\n    if initial_slope > 1e-9:\n        # Implement bisection method to find the root of dP/dt = 0.\n        \n        # 1.

This advanced problem moves beyond simple kinetics to explore how the lifetime of a selectin bond, and thus the cell's rolling velocity, is regulated by hydrodynamic shear stress. By applying a realistic piecewise model that incorporates both slip-bond and catch-bond characteristics, you will directly calculate how changes in blood flow are translated into the nonlinear behavior of a rolling leukocyte, revealing the fundamental biophysics at play [@problem_id:2899078].", "problem": "A leukocyte rolling on an inflamed endothelium forms transient bonds mediated by selectins during the initial capture and rolling phase of the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Consider a minimal mechanochemical model in which at any instant a single load-bearing selectin–ligand bond sustains the hydrodynamic torque. The bond exhibits a Bell-like slip off-rate at low force with a catch transition: specifically, the force-dependent off-rate is $k_{\\text{off}}(F)=k_0 \\exp\\!\\big(F x_b/(k_B T)\\big)$, but for forces $F$ in the interval $10$–$30$ $\\text{pN}$ the catch transition halves this off-rate relative to the slip prediction (that is, multiplies it by $1/2$), while for $F30$ $\\text{pN}$ the off-rate reverts to the slip form $k_0 \\exp\\!\\big(F x_b/(k_B T)\\big)$. Assume the following:\n\n- The leukocyte is approximated as a rigid sphere of radius $R=4.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ near a plane wall in steady shear flow with wall shear stress $\\tau_w$.\n- The hydrodynamic torque on the sphere scales as $M_h = C_M R^3 \\tau_w$ with $C_M=1$ (a near-wall Stokes-flow scaling), and this torque is balanced by a single tensile bond force $F$ acting with a lever arm $\\ell=0.30\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, so that $F = M_h/\\ell = (R^3/\\ell)\\,\\tau_w$.\n- The thermal energy is $k_B T = 4.28\\,\\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$ at $T=310\\,\\text{K}$, the reactive compliance is $x_b=0.20\\,\\text{nm}$, and the zero-force off-rate is $k_0$ (symbolic).\n- Rolling is arrest-dominated: each bond formation produces a pause of mean duration $\\tau_b(F)=1/k_{\\text{off}}(F)$ during which the cell is effectively stationary, and the cell advances a mean distance $d_0$ per release event.

This fold-change is defined as the ratio $v(\\tau_{w2})/v(\\tau_{w1})$.\n\nAccording to the provided model, the mean rolling velocity $v$ is directly proportional to the bond off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}$, with a constant of proportionality $d_0$. The relationship is given as $v(\\tau_w) \\approx d_0\\,k_{\\text{off}}\\!\\big(F(\\tau_w)\\big)$, where $F(\\tau_w)$ is the force on the bond as a function of the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$. The constants $d_0$ and the zero-force off-rate $k_0$ will cancel in the final ratio.\n\nThe fold-change is therefore the ratio of the off-rates at the two corresponding forces, $F_2 = F(\\tau_{w2})$ and $F_1 = F(\\tau_{w1})$:\n$$\n\\frac{v(\\tau_{w2})}{v(\\tau_{w1})} = \\frac{d_0\\,k_{\\text{off}}(F_2)}{d_0\\,k_{\\text{off}}(F_1)} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}(F_2)}{k_{\\text{off}}(F_1)}\n$$\n\nThe first step is to determine the forces $F_1$ and $F_2$ corresponding to the shear stresses $\\tau_{w1}$ and $\\tau_{w2}$. The force $F$ is related to the shear stress $\\tau_w$ by the expression $F = (C_M R^3/\\ell)\\,\\tau_w$. The problem states that the constant $C_M=1$.

The problem describes a piecewise definition for the off-rate. The standard slip-bond model is $k_s(F) = k_0 \\exp(F x_b/(k_B T))$.\nThe off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}(F)$ is defined as:\n- $k_{\\text{off}}(F) = k_s(F)$ for forces outside the interval $(10\\,\\text{pN}, 30\\,\\text{pN})$.\n- $k_{\\text{off}}(F) = \\frac{1}{2} k_s(F)$ for forces $F$ within the interval $(10\\,\\text{pN}, 30\\,\\text{pN})$.\n\nWe evaluate our calculated forces against this criterion:\n- $F_1 \\approx 21.33\\,\\text{pN}$, which satisfies $10\\,\\text{pN}  F_1  30\\,\\text{pN}$.

Thus, $F_2$ falls into the slip-bond regime.\n\nUsing these findings, we write the explicit expressions for $k_{\\text{off}}(F_1)$ and $k_{\\text{off}}(F_2)$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F_1) = \\frac{1}{2} k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F_1 x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F_2) = k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F_2 x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the required ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{v(\\tau_{w2})}{v(\\tau_{w1})} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}(F_2)}{k_{\\text{off}}(F_1)} = \\frac{k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F_2 x_b}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F_1 x_b}{k_B T}\\right)} = 2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F_2 x_b}{k_B T} - \\frac{F_1 x_b}{k_B T}\\right) = 2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{(F_2 - F_1) x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe symbolic constants $k_0$ and $d_0$ have cancelled, as expected.
