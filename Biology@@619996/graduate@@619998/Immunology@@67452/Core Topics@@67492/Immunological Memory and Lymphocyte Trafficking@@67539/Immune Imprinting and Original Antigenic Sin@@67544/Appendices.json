To quantify the phenomenon of immune imprinting and original antigenic sin (OAS), we consider the allocation of serological boosting after vaccination across a panel of antigens using Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assays.\n\nFoundational facts:\n- The HI titer is defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that inhibits hemagglutination and is measured in two-fold serial dilutions. Thus, if the post-vaccination titer increases by a factor of $k$ relative to the pre-vaccination titer for a given antigen, then the change can be represented as $\\log_{2}(k)$ “two-fold steps.”\n- Summation of $\\log_{2}$-transformed fold-changes across antigens is appropriate for quantifying total increases because two-fold titration steps add on a logarithmic scale.\n\nYou are given the following measured HI titers for one individual, pre- and post-vaccination:\n- Initially imprinted subtype panel (three distinct H3 antigens):\n  - Antigen Alpha: pre-vaccination $40$, post-vaccination $320$.\n  - Antigen Beta: pre-vaccination $20$, post-vaccination $160$.\n  - Antigen Gamma: pre-vaccination $10$, post-vaccination $40$.\n- Vaccine-matched antigen (contemporary H1 included in the vaccine):\n  - Antigen V: pre-vaccination $20$, post-vaccination $80$.\n\nDefine the “imprinting concentration ratio” $R$ to operationalize the extent to which post-vaccination increases are concentrated at the initially imprinted subtype versus the vaccine-matched subtype as follows: \n1.

They aim to quantify the fraction of total serum binding to the booster antigen that is attributable to imprinted specificities before and after boosting using a competition Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). They have an epitope-mapped monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the imprinted epitope and can prepare its antigen-binding fragment (Fab). The detection secondary recognizes human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and does not recognize mouse Fab. They will coat plates with the booster antigen, incubate with either a nonbinding control Fab or the imprinted-epitope Fab at saturating concentrations, and then add diluted human serum.\n\nAs fundamental bases, use: (i) the law of mass action and the occupancy concept for antigen–antibody binding, (ii) that, within a validated linear range of the ELISA, the optical density (OD) is proportional to the amount of bound human immunoglobulin, and (iii) that blocking an epitope with a saturating, non-cross-reactive Fab prevents serum antibodies to that epitope from binding without affecting access to nonoverlapping epitopes.\n\nAt a single validated serum dilution, the following OD values are obtained when coating with the booster antigen:\n- Pre-boost serum: control Fab well OD of $1.00$, imprint-epitope Fab well OD of $0.60$, and no-antigen background OD of $0.10$.\n- Post-boost serum: control Fab well OD of $1.40$, imprint-epitope Fab well OD of $0.70$, and no-antigen background OD of $0.10$.\n\nWhich option correctly describes how a competition ELISA with an epitope-specific monoclonal can quantify the fraction of serum binding attributable to imprinted specificities before and after boosting, including the appropriate controls, assumptions, and normalization, and yields the correct numerical estimates from the data above?\n\nA.

The use of a monovalent Fab is appropriate. The formula correctly calculates the inhibited signal as a fraction of the total *specific* signal (by subtracting background in the denominator). The numerical calculations are correct, with reasonable rounding.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Add a saturating concentration of full-length imprint-epitope mouse IgG competitor to the serum and calculate the imprinted fraction as the ratio $\\text{OD}_{\\text{imprint IgG}} / \\text{OD}_{\\text{no competitor}}$ without background subtraction or controls, because any decrease must be due to competition.

The reading in the presence of the imprint-epitope Fab is a measure of the *non-imprinted* response, not the \"imprint-only\" response. The logic is inverted.
