The domed follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) overlying a Peyer’s patch contains specialized microfold (M) cells that transcytose intact luminal antigen to the subepithelial dome, where antigen-presenting cells initiate adaptive immune responses.

It is a well-posed quantitative problem based on established biological principles. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the net antigen flux into the Peyer's patch, which is the total mass of antigen transported per unit time by all microfold (M) cells in the specified area. We are instructed to derive this quantity from fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of M cells, which we denote by $N_{M}$, within the given area of the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), $A$. The surface density of M cells, $d$, is defined as the number of cells per unit area.\n$$ d = \\frac{N_{M}}{A} $$\nTo find the total number of cells, we rearrange this definition:\n$$ N_{M} = d \\times A $$\nThe given values are a density $d = 100 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ and an area $A = 5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. We substitute these values into the equation.\n$$ N_{M} = \\left( 100 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mathrm{mm}^{2}} \\right) \\times (5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^{2}) = 500 \\, \\text{cells} $$\nTherefore, there are 500 M cells on the specified FAE area.\n\nNext, we calculate the total rate of antigen transport. The problem states that each M cell transports antigen at a constant rate, $r = 10 \\, \\mathrm{pg}/\\mathrm{hour}$. This rate is the mass of antigen transported per individual cell per unit time.\n\nThe net antigen flux, which we will denote as $\\Phi$, is the total mass transported by all $N_{M}$ cells per unit time. The problem assumes that cells act independently and that other transport mechanisms are negligible. Therefore, the total flux is the product of the number of cells and the rate of transport per cell.\n$$ \\Phi = N_{M} \\times r $$\nWe have calculated $N_{M} = 500$ and are given the rate $r = 10 \\, \\mathrm{pg}/\\mathrm{hour}$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\Phi = 500 \\times \\left( 10 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{pg}}{\\mathrm{hour}} \\right) = 5000 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{pg}}{\\mathrm{hour}} $$\nThis is the total mass of antigen transported into the Peyer's patch per hour.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in units of nanograms per hour ($\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{hour}$). We must convert from picograms ($\\mathrm{pg}$) to nanograms ($\\mathrm{ng}$). The conversion factor is:\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{ng} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{pg} = 10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{pg} $$\nTo perform the conversion, we apply this factor to our calculated flux:\n$$ \\Phi = 5000 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{pg}}{\\mathrm{hour}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{ng}}{10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{pg}} = 5 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{ng}}{\\mathrm{hour}} $$\nThe net antigen flux is precisely $5 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{hour}$.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

It is free from subjective or non-scientific claims.\n\nVerdict: The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and mathematically well-posed. No flaws are identified. The solution process may proceed.\n\nSolution Derivation.\nThe net protective benefit function, $P(d)$, is given by the expression:\n$$P(d) = c(d) - r(d) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta d)\\right) - \\alpha d$$\nTo find the value of $d$ that maximizes $P(d)$, we must first find the critical points by taking the first derivative of $P(d)$ with respect to $d$ and setting it to zero. This is the stationarity condition.\n$$P'(d) = \\frac{d}{dd}P(d) = \\frac{d}{dd}\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta d) - \\alpha d\\right)$$\nUsing the rules of differentiation, we obtain:\n$$P'(d) = 0 - (-\\beta)\\exp(-\\beta d) - \\alpha = \\beta\\exp(-\\beta d) - \\alpha$$\nSetting the first derivative to zero to find the stationary point, which we denote $d^\\ast$:\n$$P'(d^\\ast) = \\beta\\exp(-\\beta d^\\ast) - \\alpha = 0$$\nSolving for $d^\\ast$:\n$$\\beta\\exp(-\\beta d^\\ast) = \\alpha$$\n$$\\exp(-\\beta d^\\ast) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\beta d^\\ast = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)$$\n$$d^\\ast = -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)$$\nThis expression can be simplified using the property of logarithms, $\\ln(x^{-1}) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$d^\\ast = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right)$$\nFor $d^\\ast$ to be a physically meaningful solution, it must lie in the domain $d \\geq 0$. As $\\beta > 0$, this requires that $\\ln(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}) \\geq 0$, which in turn requires $\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} \\geq 1$, or $\\beta \\geq \\alpha$. The given parameters are $\\alpha = 0.01$ and $\\beta = 0.2$. Since $0.2 > 0.01$, the condition is satisfied, and our stationary point $d^\\ast$ is positive.\n\nNext, we apply the second derivative test to confirm that this stationary point corresponds to a local maximum. We compute the second derivative of $P(d)$:\n$$P''(d) = \\frac{d}{dd}P'(d) = \\frac{d}{dd}\\left(\\beta\\exp(-\\beta d) - \\alpha\\right)$$\n$$P''(d) = \\beta(-\\beta)\\exp(-\\beta d) = -\\beta^2\\exp(-\\beta d)$$\nFor any $d \\geq 0$, the term $\\exp(-\\beta d)$ is positive. Since $\\beta = 0.2$, $\\beta^2$ is also positive. Therefore, the second derivative, $P''(d)$, is strictly negative for all $d \\geq 0$.\n$$P''(d) = -\\beta^2\\exp(-\\beta d) < 0$$\nA strictly negative second derivative indicates that the function $P(d)$ is strictly concave over its entire domain.
