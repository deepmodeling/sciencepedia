In such assays, polarized epithelial cells with tight junctions restrict paracellular diffusion, and receptor-mediated endocytosis and transcytosis proceed vectorially from the basolateral to the apical domain. The following facts are considered foundational: epithelial polarity segregates proteins to apical versus basolateral membranes; receptor-mediated endocytosis is energy-dependent and strongly reduced at low temperature; paracellular leak across intact tight junctions is low, largely nonsaturable with respect to ligand concentration, and can be quantified with inert tracers; pIgR recognizes polymeric immunoglobulins that contain a joining chain and, following transcytosis, its ectodomain (secretory component) is cleaved and remains associated with IgA in the apical compartment. A researcher plans to quantify basolateral-to-apical transport of fluorescently labeled dIgA by adding it to the basolateral chamber of a Transwell and sampling the apical chamber over time, reporting apical fluorescence as transported cargo. They must design appropriate controls to attribute the signal specifically to pIgR-mediated transcytosis and to exclude paracellular leak and nonspecific binding.\n\nWhich option describes an experimental design and control set that is sufficient and specific to conclude that the measured basolateral-to-apical transport of fluorescent dIgA reflects pIgR-mediated transcytosis under physiologically intact barrier conditions?\n\nA.

It forms a valid basis for a rigorous evaluation of experimental design. Proceeding to solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nA conclusive demonstration of pIgR-mediated transcytosis requires a set of controls that systematically address the following criteria:\n\n1.  **Barrier Integrity**: The epithelial monolayer must form a tight barrier to prevent paracellular diffusion, which would confound the measurement of active transport. This requires verification of tight junction function.\n2.  **Specificity of Interaction**: The transport must be shown to be specific to the dIgA-pIgR interaction. This is tested via:\n    a.  **Competition**: Transport of labeled dIgA should be saturable and inhibited by an excess of unlabeled dIgA.\n    b.  **Ligand Specificity**: Molecules that do not bind pIgR (e.g., monomeric IgA, IgG) should not be transported.\n    c.  **Receptor Dependence**: Perturbation of the receptor itself (e.g., genetic knockdown, blocking antibodies) must inhibit transport.\n3.  **Mechanism of Transport**: The process must be consistent with receptor-mediated endocytosis and transcytosis. This is verified by:\n    a.  **Energy/Temperature Dependence**: The process must be significantly inhibited at low temperatures (e.g., $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) where active cellular processes are arrested.\n    b.  **Vectoriality**: The transport must occur from the basolateral compartment (where pIgR is expressed) to the apical compartment.\n    c.  **Exclusion of Non-internalized Ligand**: Signal from ligand merely bound to the cell surface, but not transcytosed, must be excluded from the final measurement.\n4.  **Confirmation of Pathway Completion**: The final product of the pathway, secretory IgA (dIgA bound to the secretory component), should be detectable in the apical medium.\n\nThese criteria will be used to evaluate each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Seed epithelial cells stably expressing human pIgR onto Transwell inserts and culture until transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) stabilizes above $1000\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Verify basolateral pIgR localization by immunostaining. Add fluorescent dIgA to the basolateral chamber at graded concentrations while keeping the apical chamber ligand-free.

Finally, detect secretory component in the apical medium by immunoblot to confirm pIgR ectodomain cleavage associated with transported dIgA.**\n\n-   **Barrier Integrity**: Excellent. High TEER ($>1000\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$) is used, and its stability is monitored. Critically, it includes a paracellular flux marker ($10\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran), which is a more direct and reliable measure of barrier function for solutes of this size than TEER alone.\n-   **Specificity of Interaction**: Excellent. It includes all necessary controls: saturation (graded concentrations), competition (excess unlabeled dIgA), proper negative ligand controls (mIgA, IgG), and direct receptor perturbation (siRNA or blocking antibody). It also correctly verifies basolateral pIgR localization.\n-   **Mechanism of Transport**: Excellent. It correctly tests for temperature dependence ($37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ vs $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), establishes the correct vectoriality (basolateral to apical), and includes an acid wash to remove non-internalized ligand.\n-   **Confirmation of Pathway Completion**: Excellent. It includes detection of the secretory component in the apical medium, confirming the full transcytotic pathway including proteolytic cleavage of pIgR.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**. This option describes a comprehensive and rigorous experimental design that addresses all necessary criteria.\n\n**B. Seed epithelial cells without verifying pIgR polarity, add fluorescent dIgA to the apical chamber, and measure basolateral fluorescence over $t = 60\\ \\mathrm{min}$ at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Use pentameric Immunoglobulin M (IgM) as a negative control cargo and rely solely on TEER above $500\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ as the barrier control, without temperature shift or receptor perturbation.**\n\n-   **Vectoriality**: Incorrect. The experiment is run in the apical-to-basolateral direction. pIgR-mediated transport of dIgA is basolateral-to-apical. This is a fundamental experimental flaw.\n-   **Controls**: Fatally insufficient. pIgR polarity is not verified. Pentameric IgM is also a ligand for pIgR and thus acts as a competitor, not a negative control. Barrier control is weak (TEER only). It lacks temperature dependence, specific competition, and receptor perturbation controls.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This design is fundamentally flawed and inadequate.\n\n**C. Add fluorescent dIgA to both apical and basolateral chambers at equal concentration to minimize gradients. To increase sensitivity, briefly treat monolayers with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to reduce tight junction resistance by approximately $50\\%$. Use bovine serum albumin as a noncompeting protein control, and measure apical fluorescence at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.**\n\n-   **Setup Logic**: Illogical. Adding ligand to both chambers eliminates the net concentration gradient required to measure vectorial transport. The goal is to measure transport *from* one side *to* the other.\n-   **Barrier Integrity**: Intentionally compromised. EDTA chelates $Ca^{2+}$ and disrupts tight junctions. This defeats the purpose of studying transport across an intact physiological barrier and would lead to massive paracellular leak, invalidating any measurement of transcytosis.\n-   **Controls**: Inadequate. Bovine serum albumin is not a proper negative control for a specific immunoglobulin receptor. No controls for temperature, competition, or receptor dependence are included.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This experimental design is counter-intuitive and self-invalidating.\n\n**D. Add fluorescent dIgA to the basolateral chamber at a single concentration and measure apical fluorescence at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Use high-abundance serum albumin as a competitor to test specificity and immunostain for early endosome markers to confirm endocytosis. Verify that TEER exceeds $800\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, but omit paracellular tracer measurements, temperature dependence, and receptor perturbation.**\n\n-   **Controls**: Grossly insufficient.\n    -   Competition: Albumin does not bind pIgR and is therefore not a specific competitor. This control is invalid for testing specificity.\n    -   Saturation: A single ligand concentration is used, preventing any analysis of saturability.\n    -   Mechanism: Lacks temperature dependence control. Staining for endosome markers confirms uptake but does not prove specific transcytosis to the apical surface.\n    -   Barrier: Lacks a paracellular tracer, a more robust control than TEER alone.\n    -   Receptor dependence: Lacks direct receptor perturbation.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This design lacks multiple critical controls that are essential for attributing the signal specifically to pIgR-mediated transcytosis.\n\n**E. Add fluorescent dIgA basolaterally and measure apical fluorescence at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Compete with excess pentameric IgM and use a blocking antibody against pIgR added to the apical chamber. Confirm monolayer integrity by TEER only, do not perform basolateral acid wash, and do not include negative cargo controls such as monomeric IgA or IgG.**\n\n-   **Controls**: Flawed and insufficient.\n    -   Temperature: Comparing $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is a weak control. While $20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ can block exit from the trans-Golgi network, it does not robustly inhibit endocytosis itself, for which $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is the standard control.\n    -   Receptor Perturbation: A blocking antibody is added to the *apical* chamber. Since the ligand is added basolaterally to bind basolateral pIgR, an apical antibody cannot block the initial step of transcytosis. This control is misplaced and ineffective.\n    -   Nonspecific binding: No acid wash is performed, meaning surface-bound, non-internalized ligand could be incorrectly measured as transported cargo.\n    -   Specificity: Lacks proper negative cargo controls (mIgA/IgG).\n    -   Barrier: Relies on TEER only.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This design includes fundamentally misplaced or weak controls and omits several other necessary ones.\n\nBased on this rigorous, principle-based analysis, Option A is the only design that is sufficient and specific.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2902048"}, {"introduction": "Once a reliable assay is established, the next step is to quantify the system's performance.

It is a standard biophysical problem involving kinetic modeling and data fitting. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Derivation of the Saturation Model**\n\nThe transport of IgA via pIgR can be modeled as a two-step process, analogous to enzyme kinetics. Let $L$ represent the ligand (dimeric IgA) at concentration $C$, let $R$ be the free pIgR at the basolateral surface, and let $RL$ be the IgA-pIgR complex.\n\nThe first step is reversible binding of the ligand to the receptor:\n$$ R + L \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} RL $$\nwhere $k_1$ is the association rate constant and $k_{-1}$ is the dissociation rate constant.\n\nThe second step is the irreversible, rate-limiting transcytosis of the complex, resulting in the release of IgA at the apical surface and the eventual recycling of the receptor.\n$$ RL \\stackrel{k_{trans}}{\\longrightarrow} R_{recycled} + L_{apical} $$\nwhere $k_{trans}$ is the rate constant for the overall transcytosis process.\n\nThe apical flux, $J$, is proportional to the rate of this second step:\n$$ J = k_{trans} [RL] $$\nwhere $[RL]$ is the surface concentration of the IgA-pIgR complex.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of the complex $[RL]$ is constant. Therefore, the rate of formation of the complex equals its rate of removal:\n$$ k_1 [R] [L] = k_{-1} [RL] + k_{trans} [RL] = (k_{-1} + k_{trans}) [RL] $$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_{total}]$, is the sum of free and bound receptors: $[R_{total}] = [R] + [RL]$. Substituting $[R] = [R_{total}] - [RL]$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_1 ([R_{total}] - [RL]) [L] = (k_{-1} + k_{trans}) [RL] $$\nRecognizing that $[L]$ is the concentration $C$:\n$$ k_1 [R_{total}] C - k_1 [RL] C = (k_{-1} + k_{trans}) [RL] $$\n$$ k_1 [R_{total}] C = (k_{-1} + k_{trans} + k_1 C) [RL] $$\nSolving for $[RL]$:\n$$ [RL] = \\frac{k_1 [R_{total}] C}{k_{-1} + k_{trans} + k_1 C} = \\frac{[R_{total}] C}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{trans}}{k_1} + C} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[RL]$ into the equation for flux $J$:\n$$ J = k_{trans} \\frac{[R_{total}] C}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{trans}}{k_1} + C} $$\nWe define two key parameters:\n- The maximal flux, $J_{\\max}$, which occurs at saturating ligand concentration ($C \\to \\infty$), where all receptors are bound ($[RL] \\to [R_{total}]$). Thus, $J_{\\max} = k_{trans} [R_{total}]$.\n- The half-saturation constant, $K_{M}$, which is the Michaelis-Menten constant for this system: $K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{trans}}{k_1}$. This is the concentration $C$ at which the flux $J$ is half of its maximum.\n\nSubstituting these definitions yields the hyperbolic saturation model:\n$$ J = \\frac{J_{\\max} C}{K_{M} + C} $$\nThis justifies the use of a two-parameter hyperbolic model.\n\n**2. Linearization and Parameter Estimation**\n\nTo estimate $J_{\\max}$ and $K_{M}$ from the data using linear regression, we must linearize the model. The Hanes-Woolf transformation is statistically robust and will be used here. We rearrange the hyperbolic equation:\n$$ \\frac{C}{J} = \\frac{C (K_{M} + C)}{J_{\\max} C} = \\frac{K_{M} + C}{J_{\\max}} $$\n$$ \\frac{C}{J} = \\left(\\frac{1}{J_{\\max}}\\right)C + \\frac{K_{M}}{J_{\\max}} $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = mx + b$, where:\n- $y = \\frac{C}{J}$\n- $x = C$\n- The slope is $m = \\frac{1}{J_{\\max}}$\n- The y-intercept is $b = \\frac{K_{M}}{J_{\\max}}$\n\nFrom the slope and intercept of a linear fit, the parameters are found as $J_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{m}$ and $K_{M} = b \\cdot J_{\\max} = \\frac{b}{m}$.\n\nWe transform the given data $(C, J)$ into $(x, y) = (C, C/J)$:\n- $(5, 17.0) \\rightarrow (5, 0.29412)$\n- $(10, 30.5) \\rightarrow (10, 0.32787)$\n- $(20, 47.5) \\rightarrow (20, 0.42105)$\n- $(40, 69.0) \\rightarrow (40, 0.57971)$\n- $(80, 86.5) \\rightarrow (80, 0.92486)$\n- $(160, 101.0) \\rightarrow (160, 1.58416)$\n\nPerforming a linear least-squares regression on these $n=6$ transformed points $(x_i, y_i)$ using the formulae:\n$$ m = \\frac{n(\\sum x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n(\\sum x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2} $$\n$$ b = \\frac{\\sum y_i - m \\sum x_i}{n} $$\nWe compute the required sums:\n- $\\sum x_i = 315$\n- $\\sum y_i \\approx 4.13177$\n- $\\sum x_i^2 = 34125$\n- $\\sum x_i y_i \\approx 363.8125$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formulae:\n$$ m = \\frac{6(363.8125) - (315)(4.13177)}{6(34125) - (315)^2} = \\frac{2182.875 - 1301.50755}{204750 - 99225} = \\frac{881.36745}{105525} \\approx 0.0083523 $$\n$$ b = \\frac{4.13177 - (0.0083523)(315)}{6} = \\frac{4.13177 - 2.6309745}{6} = \\frac{1.5007955}{6} \\approx 0.25013 $$\nNow we calculate the kinetic parameters:\n$$ J_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{1}{0.0083523} \\approx 119.726 \\, \\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n$$ K_{M} = \\frac{b}{m} = \\frac{0.25013}{0.0083523} \\approx 29.946 \\, \\mathrm{nM} $$\n\n**3. Physiological Interpretation of Parameters**\n\n- **$J_{\\max}$ (Maximal Flux):** The estimated value is $J_{\\max} \\approx 119.7 \\, \\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This parameter represents the absolute maximum transport capacity of the epithelial monolayer. It is a composite parameter defined by $J_{\\max} = k_{trans} [R_{total}]$. Its value is constrained by two fundamental physiological limits: (1) the total number of pIgR molecules expressed on the basolateral surface of the cells ($[R_{total}]$) and (2) the intrinsic rate of the entire transcytotic pathway ($k_{trans}$), which includes endocytosis, vesicular trafficking across the cytoplasm, and exocytosis at the apical membrane. A finite $J_{\\max}$ signifies that the system is saturable, as observed.\n\n- **$K_{M}$ (Half-Saturation Concentration):** The estimated value is $K_{M} \\approx 29.9 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$. This parameter is the concentration of dimeric IgA at which the transport flux is half of the maximum ($J = J_{\\max}/2$). It serves as an inverse measure of the system's effective affinity for IgA. A lower $K_{M}$ would imply that the system operates more efficiently at lower IgA concentrations. The value of $K_{M}$ depends on the rate constants for IgA binding ($k_1$), dissociation ($k_{-1}$), and transcytosis ($k_{trans}$). Physiologically, this value defines the concentration range over which the transport rate is most sensitive to changes in local IgA concentration. Comparing this $K_M$ to the typical physiological concentrations of dimeric IgA found in the lamina propria would indicate the normal operating point of the transport system (i.e., whether it is typically near-saturated or operating in the linear regime).\n\n**4.

The luminal SIgA concentration $C_{L}$ at steady state is determined by a balance between input by transcytosis and first-order luminal clearance with rate constant $k_{\\text{lum}}$ in a well-mixed luminal volume $V_{L}$.\n\nAssume the following parameter values are appropriate for a defined mucosal region and are time-invariant over the measurement window: baseline dIgA production rate $R_{0}$ is $10 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$; the vaccine doubles the number of IgA-secreting plasma cells without changing per-cell output or pIgR expression, so post-vaccination production is $2R_{0}$; the transport parameters are $V_{\\max} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $K_{R} = 3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$; the luminal volume is $V_{L} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$; the luminal clearance rate constant is $k_{\\text{lum}} = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from fundamental biochemical transport principles (saturable receptor-mediated throughput and steady-state mass balance), derive the predicted post-vaccination steady-state SIgA concentration $C_{L}^{\\text{post}}$ in the lumen. Express the final answer in $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of biochemical transport and pharmacokinetics, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We will therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the post-vaccination steady-state concentration of Secretory Immunoglobulin A ($C_{L}^{\\text{post}}$) in a mucosal lumen. This derivation rests upon two fundamental principles stated in the problem: $1$) saturable, receptor-mediated transport kinetics and $2$) a steady-state mass balance within the luminal compartment.\n\nFirst, we formalize the net transcytotic flux of SIgA, denoted by $J(R)$. The problem describes a saturable process dependent on the dIgA production rate, $R$. This behavior is characteristic of systems with a finite number of transporters, in this case, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). Such a process is mathematically described by the Michaelis-Menten-type equation, which relates the flux $J$ to the supply rate $R$:\n$$J(R) = \\frac{V_{\\max} R}{K_{R} + R}$$\nHere, $V_{\\max}$ represents the maximum possible transport flux when the system is fully saturated ($R \\to \\infty$), and $K_{R}$ is the half-saturation constant, representing the supply rate $R$ at which the flux $J(R)$ is equal to one-half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nSecond, we establish the mass balance for SIgA in the well-mixed luminal volume $V_{L}$ at steady state. A steady state is achieved when the rate of SIgA input into the lumen equals the rate of SIgA removal from the lumen.\nThe rate of input is the transcytotic flux, $J(R)$.\nThe problem specifies that clearance from the lumen is a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{\\text{lum}}$. The total mass of SIgA in the lumen is the product of its concentration $C_{L}$ and the volume $V_{L}$. Therefore, the rate of removal is given by $k_{\\text{lum}} C_{L} V_{L}$.\nEquating the rate of input and the rate of removal yields the steady-state condition:\n$$J(R) = k_{\\text{lum}} C_{L} V_{L}$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $J(R)$ into the mass balance equation, we can solve for the steady-state concentration $C_{L}$ as a function of the dIgA production rate $R$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\max} R}{K_{R} + R} = k_{\\text{lum}} C_{L} V_{L}$$\nIsolating $C_{L}$ gives the general model for the steady-state concentration:\n$$C_{L}(R) = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{lum}} V_{L}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} R}{K_{R} + R} \\right)$$\nThis equation provides the predicted SIgA concentration for any given dIgA production rate $R$.\n\nThe problem asks for the post-vaccination concentration, $C_{L}^{\\text{post}}$. According to the givens, vaccination doubles the number of IgA-secreting plasma cells, resulting in a post-vaccination production rate $R_{\\text{post}}$ that is twice the baseline rate $R_{0}$.\nGiven $R_{0} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, the post-vaccination rate is:\n$$R_{\\text{post}} = 2 R_{0} = 2 \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into the derived equation for $C_{L}(R)$, using $R = R_{\\text{post}}$. The parameter values are:\n$V_{\\max} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$K_{R} = 3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{lum}} = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$V_{L} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n\nIt is imperative to ensure dimensional consistency. The final concentration must be in $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, so we must convert the volume $V_{L}$ from milliliters to liters:\n$$V_{L} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mL} = 50 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{L} = 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{L}$$\n\nNow we compute the post-vaccination concentration $C_{L}^{\\text{post}} = C_{L}(R_{\\text{post}})$:\n$$C_{L}^{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{(0.2 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1})(0.05 \\ \\mathrm{L})} \\left( \\frac{(12 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) (20 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1})}{(3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) + (20 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1})} \\right)$$\nFirst, calculate the value of the clearance term in the denominator:\n$$k_{\\text{lum}} V_{L} = (0.2 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1})(0.05 \\ \\mathrm{L}) = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nNext, calculate the value of the flux term:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\max} R_{\\text{post}}}{K_{R} + R_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{12 \\times 20}{3 + 20} \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = \\frac{240}{23} \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nFinally, combine these results to find $C_{L}^{\\text{post}}$:\n$$C_{L}^{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{0.01 \\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\left( \\frac{240}{23} \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\right) = \\frac{240}{0.23} \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$C_{L}^{\\text{post}} \\approx 1043.47826 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$C_{L}^{\\text{post}} \\approx 1043 \\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThis is the predicted steady-state SIgA concentration in the lumen after vaccination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1043}$$", "id": "2901933"}]}
