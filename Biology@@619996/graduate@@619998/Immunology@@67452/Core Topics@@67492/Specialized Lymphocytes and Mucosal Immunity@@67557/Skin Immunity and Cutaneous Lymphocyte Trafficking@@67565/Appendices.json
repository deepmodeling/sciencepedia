It presents a standard one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model at steady state, which is a valid and appropriate framework for analyzing the distribution of a signaling molecule in biological tissue. We will proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation for the chemokine concentration, $C(x)$, is given as:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}} - k\\,C = 0\n$$\nwhere $D$ and $k$ are positive constants representing diffusivity and consumption rate, respectively. This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. We can write it as $\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{k}{D}C = 0$.

The leukocyte adhesion cascade is a fundamental, universally accepted model of leukocyte trafficking. The experimental setup (conditional knockout, adoptive transfer, DTH model) is standard and appropriate for the question asked.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to deduce a unique outcome based on established biological principles. The question is precise and asks for the most consistent set of outcomes.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe enzyme C2GnT1 is essential for initiating the formation of Core 2 O-glycans by adding an $N$-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue in a $\\beta$-$1,6$ linkage to a Core $1$ O-glycan precursor ($Gal\\beta1$-$3GalNAc\\alpha1$-Ser/Thr). The resulting branched Core 2 structure is the preferred scaffold for the subsequent addition of sialic acid and fucose to generate high-avidity ligands for E-selectin and P-selectin.\n\nThe primary E-selectin ligand on skin-homing T cells is the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), an epitope defined by the HECA-452 antibody, which consists of sialyl Lewis X (sLe$^x$) presented on various protein backbones, most prominently PSGL-1. The primary P-selectin ligand is PSGL-1. The synthesis of functional, high-avidity versions of both these ligands is critically dependent on Core 2 O-glycosylation.\n\nTherefore, deleting C2GnT1 in T cells will prevent the formation of Core 2 O-glycans. This will lead to:\n$1$. **Defective Selectin Ligand Synthesis:** The T cells will be unable to synthesize functional CLA and high-affinity P-selectin ligands on PSGL-1. This defect is directly measurable as reduced binding of soluble E-selectin and P-selectin chimeras (e.g., E-selectin–Fc) and reduced staining with the CLA-specific antibody, HECA-452.\n$2$. **Impaired Adhesion Cascade Step (i):** The leukocyte adhesion cascade begins with tethering and rolling, a step mediated by selectins on endothelium binding to their ligands on leukocytes. Since the C2GnT1-deficient T cells lack functional E- and P-selectin ligands, they will fail to efficiently tether to and roll on the inflamed dermal venules, where E-selectin and P-selectin are upregulated. This would manifest as a greatly reduced rolling flux in intravital microscopy studies.\n$3$. **Impaired Adhesion Cascade Step (iii):** Rolling and tethering are prerequisites for firm arrest. The rolling motion slows the leukocyte sufficiently to allow it to sense and respond to endothelium-bound chemokines (CCL17, CCL27), which trigger the activation of integrins (LFA-1, VLA-4). Without efficient rolling, the cells will move too quickly past the inflamed site to receive the necessary chemokine signals for firm arrest. Consequently, the number of firmly arrested C2GnT1-deficient T cells will be drastically reduced.\n$4$. **Reduced Tissue Infiltration and Inflammation:** The failure to execute the adhesion cascade results in a failure to extravasate from the blood into the inflamed skin tissue. This will lead to a reduced accumulation of C2GnT1-deficient T cells at the site of the DTH reaction. As effector T cells are key mediators of DTH, their reduced presence will cause an attenuation of the inflammatory response, measurable as reduced ear swelling.\n$5$. **Preserved Chemokine and Effector Functions:** The problem states to assume comparable activation status and does not provide any basis to assume that C2GnT1, a glycosyltransferase, directly regulates chemokine receptor expression/signaling or cytokine production pathways. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that intrinsic chemotaxis towards CCL17/CCL27 and the capacity to produce cytokines upon stimulation remain intact.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Markedly reduced binding of E-selectin–Fc and P-selectin–Fc chimeras and reduced HECA-452 (CLA) staining on C2GnT1-deficient T cells; decreased intravital microscopy rolling flux and fewer firm arrests in inflamed dermal venules; reduced accumulation in inflamed skin and attenuated ear swelling; preserved chemotaxis to CCL27 and normal ex vivo cytokine production.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is fully consistent with the derived consequences. It correctly identifies the molecular defect (loss of selectin ligands), the resulting trafficking defect (impaired rolling and arrest), the macroscopic outcome (reduced accumulation and inflammation), and the preserved functions (chemotaxis, cytokine production).\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Enhanced firm adhesion in inflamed dermal venules because loss of bulky O-glycans facilitates integrin access to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1; increased accumulation in inflamed skin and exacerbated ear swelling; reduced need for selectin-mediated rolling.**\n- **Evaluation:** This argument is fundamentally flawed. It ignores the sequential nature of the adhesion cascade, which is a required principle for this problem. Selectin-mediated rolling is not an optional step that can be bypassed; it is essential for bringing leukocytes into close enough contact with the endothelium at a slow enough speed to allow for chemokine signaling and subsequent integrin-mediated arrest. The hypothesis that removing O-glycans \"unmasks\" integrins is speculative and contradicts the established primary role of C2GnT1. The predicted outcomes are the opposite of what would occur.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Impaired homing to peripheral lymph nodes due to defective L-selectin ligand biosynthesis, leading to reduced T-cell priming; cutaneous inflammation is diminished primarily because fewer effector T cells are generated.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option mislocates the primary defect. The experiment tests the trafficking of *already generated* effector T cells into the *skin*, a process dependent on E- and P-selectin. Homing to lymph nodes via L-selectin and the process of T-cell priming are prior events not being tested in this experimental setup. The premise \"fewer effector T cells are generated\" contradicts the experimental design where equal numbers are transferred.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Normal trafficking into inflamed skin but reduced effector function because C2GnT1 loss diminishes CCR4 surface expression; chemotaxis to CCL17 and CCL27 is impaired while selectin-dependent interactions are intact.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option contains multiple falsehoods. The statement that \"selectin-dependent interactions are intact\" is the exact opposite of the primary consequence of C2GnT1 loss. Consequently, trafficking will not be normal. Furthermore, there is no established evidence that C2GnT1 loss primarily affects CCR4 expression to a degree that it becomes the principal defect. The central role of C2GnT1 is in selectin ligand biosynthesis.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Preserved rolling due to compensation by Core 1 O-glycans on PSGL-1, but defective egress from skin because C2GnT1 loss reduces sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1); accumulation in skin is increased due to retention.**\n- **Evaluation:** The premise of \"preserved rolling\" is incorrect. Core 1 O-glycans are known to be poor substrates for forming high-avidity selectin ligands, and compensation is minimal. The primary defect is in tissue *entry*, not *egress*. The proposed link to S1PR1, the receptor for egress, is speculative and secondary to the profound and well-documented defect in entry. The predicted outcome of increased accumulation due to retention is therefore based on a faulty chain of reasoning and contradicts the expected reduction in cell entry.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2889122"}]}
