It is a well-defined exercise in combinatorial mathematics applied to molecular immunology. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total number of distinct TRD rearrangements, which we denote as $N_{total}$. The problem specifies that the total repertoire is composed of two mutually exclusive classes of rearrangements: those with one D segment (V–D–J), and those with two D segments (V–D–D–J). The total number of rearrangements is therefore the sum of the number of possibilities in each class, a direct application of the sum rule of combinatorics.\n$$N_{total} = N_{V-D-J} + N_{V-D-D-J}$$\nwhere $N_{V-D-J}$ is the number of rearrangements with one D segment and $N_{V-D-D-J}$ is the number of rearrangements with two D segments.\n\nFirst, we calculate $N_{V-D-J}$. This rearrangement requires the selection of one V segment, one D segment, and one J segment. The problem states that these choices are independent events.\n- The number of ways to select one V segment from a pool of $n_V$ distinct segments is $n_V$.\n- The number of ways to select one D segment from a pool of $n_D$ distinct segments is $n_D$.\n- The number of ways to select one J segment from a pool of $n_J$ distinct segments is $n_J$.\n\nBy the product rule for independent events, the total number of distinct V–D–J rearrangements is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n$$N_{V-D-J} = n_{V} \\cdot n_{D} \\cdot n_{J}$$\n\nNext, we calculate $N_{V-D-D-J}$. This rearrangement requires the selection of one V segment, two distinct D segments in a specified order, and one J segment.\n- The number of ways to select one V segment is $n_V$.\n- The number of ways to select one J segment is $n_J$.\n- We must determine the number of ways to select two distinct D segments from a pool of $n_D$ segments, where the order of selection matters. This corresponds to an ordered permutation without replacement.\n- For the first D segment in the tandem pair ($D_{1}$), there are $n_D$ choices.\n- For the second D segment ($D_{2}$), the choice must be distinct from the first. Thus, there are $n_D - 1$ remaining choices.\n- The total number of ordered pairs of distinct D segments is the product $n_D \\cdot (n_D - 1)$.

It is a standard exercise in biophysical modeling. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Fractional Receptor Occupancy $\\theta(L)$**\nWe start from the given definitions:\n1.  The dissociation constant: $K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n2.  The mass balance for the total receptor: $[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$\n\nFrom the mass balance equation (2), we express the concentration of free receptor $[R]$ as:\n$$ [R] = [R]_T - [RL] $$\nSubstitute this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of the dissociation constant (1), and representing the constant free ligand concentration $[L]$ as $L$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{([R]_T - [RL]) L}{[RL]} $$\nOur objective is to find an expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta(L) = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$. To achieve this, we must first solve for $[RL]$ in terms of $[R]_T$, $L$, and $K_D$.\n$$ K_D [RL] = ([R]_T - [RL]) L = [R]_T L - [RL] L $$\nRearrange the terms to group all terms containing $[RL]$:\n$$ K_D [RL] + [RL] L = [R]_T L $$\n$$ [RL] (K_D + L) = [R]_T L $$\nSolving for the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex $[RL]$ yields:\n$$ [RL] = \\frac{[R]_T L}{K_D + L} $$\nNow, we can find the fractional occupancy $\\theta(L)$ by dividing by the total receptor concentration $[R]_T$:\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{1}{[R]_T} \\left( \\frac{[R]_T L}{K_D + L} \\right) $$\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\frac{L}{K_D + L} $$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Normalized Activation $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$**\nThe normalized activation $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$ is stated to follow a Hill-type dependence on $L$. The general form of the Hill equation is:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{L^n}{K_A^n + L^n} $$\nwhere $K_A$ is the ligand concentration that produces a half-maximal response ($\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{2}$) and $n$ is the Hill coefficient.\n\nThe problem specifies that half-maximal activation occurs at the ligand concentration, which we will denote $L_{1/2}$, that yields half-occupancy ($\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$). We use the expression for $\\theta(L)$ derived in Part 1 to find this concentration:\n$$ \\theta(L_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{L_{1/2}}{K_D + L_{1/2}} $$\nSolving for $L_{1/2}$:\n$$ K_D + L_{1/2} = 2 L_{1/2} $$\n$$ K_D = L_{1/2} $$\nThis result shows that the ligand concentration yielding half-occupancy is equal to the dissociation constant $K_D$. According to the problem's assumption, this is also the concentration for half-maximal activation. Therefore, the parameter $K_A$ in the Hill equation is equal to $K_D$.\nSubstituting $K_A = K_D$ into the generic Hill equation gives the specific expression for normalized activation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{L^n}{K_D^n + L^n} $$\nThis is the required expression for normalized activation as a function of $L$, $K_D$, and $n$.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Normalized Activation**\nWe are given the following values:\n- $L = 1.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_D = 0.45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $n = 3$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$. The units $(\\mu\\mathrm{M})$ are consistent and will cancel. It is more efficient to first compute the ratio $\\frac{K_D}{L}$ and then substitute it into an equivalent form of the Hill equation.\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{L^n}{K_D^n + L^n} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D^n}{L^n} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{K_D}{L}\\right)^n + 1} $$\nFirst, calculate the ratio $\\frac{K_D}{L}$ as an exact fraction:\n$$ \\frac{K_D}{L} = \\frac{0.45}{1.2} = \\frac{45}{120} = \\frac{3 \\times 15}{8 \\times 15} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nNow substitute this ratio and $n=3$ into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3 + 1} $$\nCalculate the cubic term:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3^3}{8^3} = \\frac{27}{512} $$\nSubstitute this result back into the expression:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27}{512} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27}{512} + \\frac{512}{512}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27 + 512}{512}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{539}{512}} $$\nThe final result for the normalized activation is:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{512}{539} $$\nThe numbers $512=2^9$ and $539=7^2 \\times 11$ share no common prime factors, so this fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{512}{539}}$$", "id": "2906218"}, {"introduction": "The response of the immune system to a challenge unfolds at the population level, where specific clones of lymphocytes may expand or contract.

This describes a relatively even or polyclonal repertoire.\n\nBy Day $7$, after the phosphoantigen challenge, the frequency distribution has dramatically shifted. Clonotype $C_1$ has expanded from $25\\%$ to $62.5\\%$ of the population, while all other clonotypes have decreased in relative frequency. This is a classic signature of antigen-driven clonal selection and expansion. This increased dominance of a single clone is quantitatively captured by a decrease in Shannon entropy ($H_7 \\approx 1.17$), an increase in Simpson concentration ($D_7 \\approx 0.43$), and a marked rise in clonality ($C_{P,7} \\approx 0.27$). This response is precisely what is expected for phosphoantigen-responsive Vγ9Vδ2 T cells.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

Shannon entropy decreases; Simpson concentration increases; “clonality” goes from about $0.79$ to about $0.57$. Interpretation: clonal dominance lessens after challenge because the diversity index is smaller.**\n- The direction of change for entropy and concentration is correct.\n- The stated clonality values are incorrect. They appear to be derived from the Simpson diversity index ($1-D$), which is not the metric defined in the problem. $1-D_0 \\approx 1 - 0.209 = 0.791$ and $1-D_7 \\approx 1 - 0.428 = 0.572$. The problem explicitly mandates the use of Pielou-normalized clonality.\n- The interpretation that \"clonal dominance lessens\" is factually incorrect based on the raw data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Shannon entropy and Simpson concentration are unchanged because richness is fixed at $5$; Pielou-normalized clonality remains at $0$ since richness does not change. Interpretation: no meaningful repertoire restructuring occurred.**\n- The premise that entropy and concentration are functions of richness alone is false. They are functions of the frequency distribution $p_i$, which changed.\n- Pielou-normalized clonality is only $0$ for a perfectly even distribution, which was not the case at either time point.\n- The interpretation of \"no meaningful restructuring\" is decisively falsified by the data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2906180"}]}
