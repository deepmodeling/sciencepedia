Some ligands act as agonists that stabilize MR1 on the cell surface and drive T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent activation, whereas other ligands act as antagonists that stabilize MR1 but fail to elicit signaling. Consider a system in which MR1 presents a single binding site for ligands and binds three ligands from a well-stirred extracellular reservoir at constant concentrations: an agonist $A$, an antagonist $I$, and an endogenous weak partial agonist $E$. Assume the following foundational principles: (i) the law of mass action at thermodynamic equilibrium for each ligand with dissociation constant $K_{d,j}$, (ii) conservation of the total MR1 pool, and (iii) only ligand-bound MR1 is exported to the cell surface, so that empty MR1 contributes neither to surface density nor to signaling.

Based on principle (iii), only ligand-bound MR1 is exported to the surface, and thus able to signal. The simplest and most direct interpretation is that the signal generated by each type of complex is proportional to its total concentration. Thus, the total unnormalized signal $S_{unnorm}$ is proportional to the sum of the concentrations of each complex, weighted by its respective efficacy $e_J$:\n$S_{unnorm} \\propto e_{A}[MR1 \\cdot A] + e_{I}[MR1 \\cdot I] + e_{E}[MR1 \\cdot E]$\n\nLet's introduce a proportionality constant $C$.\n$S_{unnorm} = C \\left( e_{A}\\frac{[MR1]_{f} [A]}{K_{d,A}} + e_{I}\\frac{[MR1]_{f} [I]}{K_{d,I}} + e_{E}\\frac{[MR1]_{f} [E]}{K_{d,E}} \\right)$\n$S_{unnorm} = C [MR1]_{f} \\left( \\frac{e_{A} [A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{e_{I} [I]}{K_{d,I}} + \\frac{e_{E} [E]}{K_{d,E}} \\right)$\n\nWe can express $[MR1]_{f}$ in terms of $[MR1]_{T}$:\n$[MR1]_{f} = \\frac{[MR1]_{T}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{d,I}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{unnorm}$:\n$S_{unnorm} = C [MR1]_{T} \\frac{\\frac{e_{A} [A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{e_{I} [I]}{K_{d,I}} + \\frac{e_{E} [E]}{K_{d,E}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{d,I}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$\n\nThe problem states that the signal $S$ is normalized to the interval $[0,1]$. This requires dividing $S_{unnorm}$ by the maximum possible signal, $S_{max}$. $S_{max}$ is achieved when all MR1 molecules are bound to the ligand with the highest efficacy.

Mathematically, this corresponds to the solutions of the nonlinear algebraic system:\n$$\nf_T(T^*, R^*) = 0\n$$\n$$\nf_R(T^*, R^*) = 0\n$$\nThese equations define the nullclines of the system, and their intersections are the steady states.\n\nThe stability of a steady state $(T^*, R^*)$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ evaluated at that point. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n$$\nJ(T, R) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial R} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_R}{\\partial T} & \\frac{\\partial f_R}{\\partial R} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives, we find the elements of the Jacobian:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial T} = -\\delta_T\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial R} = \\alpha_T \\frac{d}{dR} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K_{TR}}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1} = -2\\alpha_T \\frac{R/K_{TR}^2}{\\left(1 + (R/K_{TR})^2\\right)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_R}{\\partial T} = \\alpha_R \\frac{d}{dT} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{T}{K_{RT}}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1} = -2\\alpha_R \\frac{T/K_{RT}^2}{\\left(1 + (T/K_{RT})^2\\right)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_R}{\\partial R} = -\\delta_R\n$$\nA steady state is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues of $J(T^*, R^*)$ have negative real parts. For a a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this condition is equivalent to the Routh-Hurwitz criteria: $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J) > 0$.\n\nLet us first examine the trace of the Jacobian:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = \\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial T} + \\frac{\\partial f_R}{\\partial R} = -\\delta_T - \\delta_R\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, all degradation rates $\\delta_T$ and $\\delta_R$ are strictly positive. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Tr}(J)$ is always negative for any point $(T, R)$ in the phase space. This has a significant consequence: the system cannot exhibit periodic orbits (limit cycles), as dictated by the Bendixson-Dulac theorem. All trajectories must converge to a steady state.\n\nWith $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) < 0$ guaranteed, the condition for asymptotic stability simplifies to requiring that the determinant of the Jacobian be positive:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J) = (-\\delta_T)(-\\delta_R) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial R}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_R}{\\partial T}\\right) > 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the partial derivatives, the stability condition at a steady state $(T^*, R^*)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J) = \\delta_T \\delta_R - 4\\alpha_T \\alpha_R \\frac{R^*/K_{TR}^2}{\\left(1 + (R^*/K_{TR})^2\\right)^2} \\frac{T^*/K_{RT}^2}{\\left(1 + (T^*/K_{RT})^2\\right)^2} > 0\n$$\nSolving the system of steady-state equations analytically is not feasible in general. We will therefore employ a robust numerical approach. The fundamental property that all trajectories converge to a steady state allows us to find all stable steady states (attractors) by simulating the system from a multitude of initial conditions.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each of the six parameter sets, we define the corresponding ODE system.\n$2$. We establish a grid of initial conditions $(T_0, R_0)$ that covers a relevant portion of the non-negative quadrant of the phase space. The domain is chosen to be larger than the maximum possible steady-state values, which can be bounded by $\\max(T) \\le \\alpha_T/\\delta_T + s_{12}/\\delta_T$ and $\\max(R) \\le \\alpha_R/\\delta_R + s_{23}/\\delta_R$.\n$3$. For each initial condition, we numerically integrate the ODE system using a high-precision solver (`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`) for a sufficiently long time duration to ensure convergence to a steady state.\n$4$. The resulting final states of all trajectories are collected. We then identify the unique final states by clustering them based on Euclidean distance, with a small tolerance (e.g., $10^{-4}$). These unique final states are our candidate stable steady states.\n$5$. For each candidate state, we perform two verification steps: first, we confirm it is a true steady state by ensuring the vector field $(dT/dt, dR/dt)$ at that point is numerically close to zero. Second, we confirm its stability by computing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix and ensuring it is positive.\n$6$. The number of unique states that satisfy both verification criteria is the final count of asymptotically stable steady states for the given parameter set.\n\nThis method is reliable because the basins of attraction for the stable steady states will capture trajectories originating from the grid of initial points, and our stability condition based on the Jacobian determinant is both necessary and sufficient. This procedure is implemented in the provided Python code to compute the results for all six test cases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[2,1,1,1,1,2]}$$", "id": "2863251"}]}
