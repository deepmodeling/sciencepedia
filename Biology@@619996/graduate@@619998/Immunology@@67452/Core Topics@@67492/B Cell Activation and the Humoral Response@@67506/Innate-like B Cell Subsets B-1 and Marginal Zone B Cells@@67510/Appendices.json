Let the signaling output be\n$$\nS(A) \\;=\\; g\\, S_{\\max}\\,\\frac{A^{n}}{K^{n}+A^{n}},\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the effective surface antigen density presented to an MZ B cell, $n$ is the Hill coefficient, $K$ is the antigen density at half-maximal response, $S_{\\max}$ is the maximal signaling output when the BCR is saturated, and $g$ is a dimensionless gain factor proportional to CD19 surface expression.

The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient equations and a simplifying assumption to determine the desired ratio. All terms are clearly defined. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nProceeding with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly applying the low-occupancy approximation, $A \\ll K$. This condition implies that $A^n \\ll K^n$. Consequently, the denominator of the Hill function can be simplified:\n$$K^n + A^n \\approx K^n$$\nApplying this approximation to the Hill function term gives:\n$$\\frac{A^n}{K^n + A^n} \\approx \\frac{A^n}{K^n} = \\left(\\frac{A}{K}\\right)^n$$\nThis approximation linearizes the relationship between the signaling output and $A^n$ for low antigen concentrations.\n\nNow, we rewrite the two activation conditions using this approximation.\nFor the normal condition ($g_0 = 1$, $A_0$):\n$$T = S_{\\max} \\frac{A_0^n}{K^n + A_0^n} \\approx S_{\\max} \\left(\\frac{A_0}{K}\\right)^n$$\nFor the haploinsufficient condition ($g_1 = 0.5$, $A_1$):\n$$T = 0.5 S_{\\max} \\frac{A_1^n}{K^n + A_1^n} \\approx 0.5 S_{\\max} \\left(\\frac{A_1}{K}\\right)^n$$\nSince the activation threshold $T$ is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions for $T$:\n$$S_{\\max} \\left(\\frac{A_0}{K}\\right)^n = 0.5 S_{\\max} \\left(\\frac{A_1}{K}\\right)^n$$\nThe terms $S_{\\max}$ and $K^{-n}$ are non-zero constants present on both sides of the equation, and thus can be cancelled:\n$$A_0^n = 0.5 A_1^n$$\nWe are required to find the fold-change $F = \\frac{A_1}{A_0}$. To do so, we rearrange the equation to isolate the ratio $\\frac{A_1^n}{A_0^n}$:\n$$\\frac{A_1^n}{A_0^n} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{A_1}{A_0}\\right)^n = 2$$\nSubstituting the definition $F = \\frac{A_1}{A_0}$:\n$$F^n = 2$$\nTo solve for $F$, we take the $n$-th root of both sides of the equation:\n$$F = 2^{1/n}$$\nThis is the final expression for the fold-change in minimal activating antigen density, expressed solely in terms of the Hill coefficient $n$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative functional consequence: The result $F = 2^{1/n}$ indicates that $F > 1$ for any positive Hill coefficient $n$ (in biology, $n > 0$, and for cooperativity, $n > 1$). This means $A_1 > A_0$, so a higher concentration of antigen is required to trigger activation in CD19-haploinsufficient MZ B cells. This represents a decreased sensitivity to antigen. Marginal zone (MZ) B cells are critical for mounting rapid, T-cell independent antibody responses against blood-borne pathogens.
