This practice explores the fundamental concept of distinct developmental origins for B-1 and B-2 cells—B-1 cells arising primarily from fetal progenitors and being self-maintaining, while B-2 cells are continuously replenished from adult bone marrow. By reasoning through this thought experiment [@problem_id:2866962], you will solidify your understanding of how lineage origin dictates B cell population maintenance in different anatomical niches.", "problem": "An adult mouse is lethally irradiated and reconstituted with unfractionated adult bone marrow cells only. No fetal liver cells, no neonatal tissues, and no peritoneal cavity cells are transferred. After stable engraftment is confirmed at $8$ weeks, you analyze B cell populations in the spleen and peritoneal cavity and measure steady-state serum immunoglobulin M (IgM). Based solely on well-established principles of hematopoietic ontogeny and lineage maintenance—that fetal/neonatal hematopoiesis preferentially generates B-$1$ lineage cells that become long-lived and self-renewing in body cavities, whereas adult bone marrow hematopoiesis predominantly produces conventional B-$2$ lineage cells—predict the most likely outcome and select the best justification.\n\nA. The spleen shows robust recovery of conventional B-$2$ cells (including follicular and marginal zone subsets), the peritoneal cavity shows a profound deficiency of B-$1$a (CD$5^{+}$) cells with only trace B-$1$b cells, and steady-state serum IgM is reduced relative to nonirradiated controls, because adult bone marrow lacks efficient B-$1$a progenitors and irradiation ablates the self-renewing B-$1$ pool.\n\nB.

Adult bone marrow hematopoiesis predominantly produces conventional B-$2$ lineage cells.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The experimental design described—lethal irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation—is a canonical method in immunology to study the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The stated premise regarding the distinct origins and maintenance of B-$1$ and B-$2$ cell lineages is a well-established and fundamental concept in B cell biology. Lethal irradiation is known to ablate not only hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow but also long-lived, sessile, and self-renewing populations in peripheral tissues, such as the B-$1$ cells in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. The reconstitution source is explicitly defined as adult bone marrow, and crucial confounding sources (fetal liver, peritoneal cells) are explicitly excluded. The question is well-posed, asking for a logical prediction based on these standard conditions and principles. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, and the setup is complete for the question being asked.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe problem requires predicting the state of the B cell compartment following hematopoietic reconstitution from an adult bone marrow source.\n\n$1$. **Effect of Lethal Irradiation**: A lethal dose of total body irradiation ablates the entirety of the host's hematopoietic system. This includes hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, developing lymphocyte precursors, and mature, long-lived lymphocyte populations throughout the body. Critically, this includes the self-renewing pool of B-$1$ cells, primarily B-$1$a cells, that reside in the peritoneal and pleural cavities and are responsible for a significant fraction of \"natural\" serum IgM.\n\n$2$. **Potential of Adult Bone Marrow Progenitors**: The transplanted adult bone marrow contains a complete set of HSCs and downstream progenitors necessary to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system. However, as stated in the problem's premise—which reflects established scientific fact—the developmental potential of these adult progenitors is skewed. They are highly efficient at generating progenitors for the conventional B-$2$ lineage. These B-$2$ cells develop in the bone marrow, migrate to the spleen and other secondary lymphoid organs, and differentiate into follicular ($FO$) and marginal zone ($MZ$) B cells. In contrast, adult bone marrow is a very poor source of progenitors for the B-$1$a lineage. The primary wave of B-$1$a cell generation occurs during fetal and neonatal life, originating from progenitors in the fetal liver. These fetal-derived B-$1$a cells seed the body cavities, where they are maintained throughout adult life by self-renewal, independent of ongoing input from the bone marrow.\n\n$3$. **Predicted Outcome**:\n- **Spleen Reconstitution**: Since the transplanted adult bone marrow is rich in B-$2$ progenitors, we expect a robust and efficient reconstitution of the conventional B-$2$ cell compartment. The spleen will be repopulated with newly generated follicular and marginal zone B cells.\n- **Peritoneal Cavity Reconstitution**: The original, self-renewing B-$1$a cell population was ablated by irradiation. The adult bone marrow graft lacks the specific progenitors to efficiently replenish this niche. Consequently, there will be a profound and persistent deficiency of B-$1$a cells (defined by the marker $\\text{CD}5^{+}$) in the peritoneal cavity. The B-$1$b lineage also has fetal origins, but some evidence suggests it can be generated, albeit inefficiently, from adult progenitors. Therefore, a small or \"trace\" population of B-$1$b cells might be detectable, but the dominant B-$1$a population will be absent.\n- **Serum IgM Levels**: B-$1$a cells are major producers of steady-state, \"natural\" serum IgM. The ablation of the B-$1$a population and its failed reconstitution from an adult bone marrow source will lead to a significant reduction in the total concentration of serum IgM compared to a normal, non-irradiated control mouse that possesses an intact B-$1$a cell pool.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The spleen shows robust recovery of conventional B-$2$ cells (including follicular and marginal zone subsets), the peritoneal cavity shows a profound deficiency of B-$1$a (CD$5^{+}$) cells with only trace B-$1$b cells, and steady-state serum IgM is reduced relative to nonirradiated controls, because adult bone marrow lacks efficient B-$1$a progenitors and irradiation ablates the self-renewing B-$1$ pool.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles. It correctly predicts the successful reconstitution of the B-$2$ lineage, the failure to reconstitute the B-$1$a lineage, the resulting reduction in serum IgM, and provides the precise and correct justification for these outcomes. The mention of $\\text{CD}5^{+}$ correctly identifies the B-$1$a subset.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both the spleen and peritoneal cavity reconstitute with near-normal frequencies of B-$1$a and B-$1$b cells alongside B-$2$ cells, and steady-state serum IgM is near normal, because multipotent adult bone marrow progenitors can generate all mature B cell subsets equivalently in adults.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The central premise of the justification—that adult progenitors generate all B cell subsets \"equivalently\"—is false. There is a well-documented lineage bias where adult bone marrow overwhelmingly favors B-$2$ development over B-$1$a development. Therefore, B-$1$a cells and serum IgM would not recover to near-normal levels.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The peritoneal cavity preferentially reconstitutes with B-$1$a cells while the spleen shows poor B-$2$ recovery, and serum IgM is elevated, because B-$1$a cells are radioresistant and rapidly expand by self-renewal after irradiation.**\nThis option contains multiple scientific errors. First, B-$1$a cells are not radioresistant to a lethal irradiation protocol; if they were, the experiment would be impossible as they would not be ablated. Second, the adult bone marrow source would lead to robust B-$2$ recovery, not poor recovery. Third, B-$1$a cells would not preferentially reconstitute for reasons already stated. Fourth, serum IgM would not be elevated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No meaningful B cell reconstitution is observed in either compartment, and serum IgM remains absent, because B cell development requires thymic support that is compromised by irradiation and not restored by bone marrow alone.**\nThis statement demonstrates a basic misunderstanding of lymphocyte development. The development of B cells (B-lymphopoiesis) occurs primarily in the bone marrow and is independent of the thymus. The thymus is the site of T cell development (T-lymphopoiesis). While T cells provide \"help\" for certain mature B cell functions (e.g., T-dependent antibody responses), they are not required for the initial generation and reconstitution of the B cell compartment from hematopoietic progenitors. Adult bone marrow contains all necessary precursors to restore B-lymphopoiesis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2866962"}, {"introduction": "A key difference between B-1 and B-2 cells lies not just in their origin, but in how they respond to antigens to generate antibody diversity. This exercise challenges you to connect a B cell subset's typical activation pathway—T-independent for B-1 versus T-dependent for B-2—to the downstream molecular machinery of affinity maturation, such as germinal center formation and somatic hypermutation. Mastering this reasoning [@problem_id:2866903] is crucial for predicting the quality and characteristics of an antibody response mounted by different arms of the B cell compartment.", "problem": "A researcher is comparing how mature B cell subsets diversify their antibodies after initial activation. The two subsets of interest are B-$1$ cells and B-$2$ cells. The following foundational facts are known and may be used as the basis for reasoning:\n\n- Somatic hypermutation is a process that introduces point mutations into immunoglobulin variable region genes and requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Affinity maturation is the population-level increase in average antigen-binding affinity that arises when higher-affinity clones are selectively expanded after somatic hypermutation.\n- In T-dependent responses, B cells form germinal centers (GCs) within follicles, where AID is induced, and selection occurs via antigen displayed on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) together with T follicular helper (Tfh) cell help through CD$40$-CD$40$L and cytokines. These GC microanatomical and cellular interactions are necessary for sustained cycles of mutation and selection.\n- In T-independent responses, B cells can be activated by multivalent antigens and innate signals (for example, via Toll-like receptors), typically outside follicles and without substantial Tfh help or GC formation. Extrafollicular plasmablast responses can occur rapidly but generally lack iterative selection.\n- B-$1$ cells are enriched in pleural and peritoneal cavities, are long-lived and self-renewing, have a restricted and often germline-biased B cell receptor repertoire, and commonly respond to T-independent antigens to produce “natural” immunoglobulin M (IgM). B-$2$ cells dominate follicles and mount classical T-dependent responses to protein antigens, including robust GC reactions with class switching.\n\nThe researcher immunizes mice with either a multivalent polysaccharide or a protein antigen and then tracks mutation frequency in immunoglobulin variable regions and the average antibody affinity over time. They also note whether germinal centers form, whether CD$40$-CD$40$L interactions with T cells are required, and whether selection on FDCs is observed.\n\nWhich statement best contrasts the extent of somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation in B-$1$ versus B-$2$ responses and correctly justifies the difference by the operative mechanistic constraints?\n\nA. B-$1$ responses show minimal somatic hypermutation and limited or no affinity maturation; B-$2$ responses show extensive somatic hypermutation and robust affinity maturation, because B-$2$ cells undergo germinal center reactions driven by CD$40$-CD$40$L interactions and selection on follicular dendritic cells, whereas B-$1$ cells are activated predominantly by T-independent, innate cues outside follicles with lower activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression and lack of T follicular helper help.\n\nB. Both B-$1$ and B-$2$ responses undergo extensive somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, because activation-induced cytidine deaminase is ubiquitously expressed in all activated B cells regardless of context, and high-affinity selection proceeds equivalently in extrafollicular foci.\n\nC. B-$1$ responses undergo greater somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation than B-$2$ responses, because their self-renewal permits cumulative mutation over time and multivalent polysaccharide antigens accelerate selection through strong B cell receptor cross-linking.\n\nD. B-$2$ responses exhibit somatic hypermutation, but affinity maturation is minimal because selection requires repetitive antigen exposure; B-$1$ responses achieve high affinity rapidly due to strong cross-linking by T-independent antigens that substitutes for selection.\n\nE. B-$1$ responses achieve high affinity predominantly by receptor editing in the bone marrow, whereas B-$2$ responses lack activation-induced cytidine deaminase and rely on class-switch recombination only.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe foundational facts and experimental setup provided are as follows:\n- **Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) and Affinity Maturation (AM):** SHM introduces point mutations into immunoglobulin variable regions and requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). AM is the population-level increase in antigen-binding affinity resulting from the selective expansion of higher-affinity clones after SHM.\n- **T-Dependent (TD) Responses:** B cells form germinal centers (GCs) in follicles. In GCs, AID is induced, and selection occurs with antigen on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and help from T follicular helper (Tfh) cells via CD$40$-CD$40$L interactions and cytokines. These GC mechanisms are essential for sustained cycles of mutation and selection.\n- **T-Independent (TI) Responses:** B cells are activated by multivalent antigens and innate signals (e.g., Toll-like receptors), typically outside follicles. These responses lack substantial Tfh help and GC formation. The resulting extrafollicular responses are rapid but generally lack iterative selection.\n- **B-$1$ Cells:** These cells are common in pleural and peritoneal cavities, are long-lived and self-renewing, have a restricted and germline-biased B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, and typically respond to TI antigens to produce \"natural\" immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n- **B-$2$ Cells:** These cells are the dominant population in follicles and mount classical TD responses to protein antigens, which include robust GC reactions and class switching.\n- **Experimental Design:** Mice are immunized with either a multivalent polysaccharide (a model TI antigen) or a protein antigen (a model TD antigen). The researcher measures mutation frequency (SHM) and average antibody affinity (AM). They also observe GC formation, the requirement for CD$40$-CD$40$L interactions, and selection on FDCs.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is scrutinized for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The provided \"foundational facts\" are accurate representations of core principles in adaptive immunology concerning B cell biology. The mechanisms of TD and TI responses, the function of GCs, AID, Tfh cells, and the characteristics of B-$1$ and B-$2$ cells are all well-established scientific concepts. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly structured. It provides a set of premises (the foundational facts) and an experimental context, then asks for a conclusion that contrasts the two cell types based on these premises. A unique, logical solution can be derived. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The language used is precise, technical, and free of bias or subjective claims. All terms are standard in the field of immunology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically accurate, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution will now be derived from the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of SHM and AM in B-$1$ and B-$2$ cell responses, justified by their differing activation mechanisms as outlined in the givens.\n\n1.  **Analysis of B-$2$ Cell Response:** According to the givens, B-$2$ cells are the primary mediators of T-dependent (TD) responses to protein antigens. This type of response is characterized by the formation of germinal centers (GCs). Within the GC microenvironment, several key events occur: induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which initiates SHM in the immunoglobulin variable region genes; and a rigorous selection process. This selection involves B cells competing for antigen presented on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and receiving survival signals from T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a process critically dependent on CD$40$-CD$40$L interaction. The problem states these GC interactions are \"necessary for sustained cycles of mutation and selection.\" Therefore, a B-$2$ cell response to a protein antigen will feature extensive SHM and, as a direct consequence of the selection process, robust affinity maturation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of B-$1$ Cell Response:** The givens state that B-$1$ cells predominantly respond to T-independent (TI) antigens, such as multivalent polysaccharides. TI responses are defined as occurring outside of follicles, without significant Tfh cell help, and without the formation of GCs. The description explicitly notes that these extrafollicular responses \"generally lack iterative selection.\" Since the machinery for sustained mutation and selection (the GC, with its specialized FDCs and Tfh cells) is absent in a typical B-$1$ cell response, there is no mechanism for driving robust affinity maturation. While some level of AID expression and SHM might occur upon initial activation, it will not be coupled to an iterative selection process. Consequently, the B-$1$ cell response will be characterized by minimal to no SHM and a corresponding lack of significant affinity maturation. The antibodies produced will be of relatively low affinity and predominantly of the IgM isotype, consistent with the \"natural\" antibody role of B-$1$ cells.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** In summary, B-$2$ cells, through TD GC reactions, are equipped for extensive SHM and affinity maturation. B-$1$ cells, through TI extrafollicular responses, are not. The key mechanistic difference is the presence or absence of the germinal center reaction, with its integrated system of mutation (AID) and selection (FDC/Tfh).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nEach option will be evaluated against this derived conclusion.\n\n*   **A. B-$1$ responses show minimal somatic hypermutation and limited or no affinity maturation; B-$2$ responses show extensive somatic hypermutation and robust affinity maturation, because B-$2$ cells undergo germinal center reactions driven by CD$40$-CD$40$L interactions and selection on follicular dendritic cells, whereas B-$1$ cells are activated predominantly by T-independent, innate cues outside follicles with lower activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression and lack of T follicular helper help.**\n    This statement is perfectly consistent with the derivation from the provided facts. It correctly assigns low SHM/AM to B-$1$ cells and high SHM/AM to B-$2$ cells. The justification is also correct: it attributes the robust B-$2$ response to GC reactions involving CD$40$-CD$40$L (Tfh help) and FDCs, and attributes the weak B-$1$ response to the lack of this machinery in TI, extrafollicular responses.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Both B-$1$ and B-$2$ responses undergo extensive somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, because activation-induced cytidine deaminase is ubiquitously expressed in all activated B cells regardless of context, and high-affinity selection proceeds equivalently in extrafollicular foci.**\n    This statement is factually incorrect based on the givens. The problem states that the GC interactions are \"necessary for sustained cycles of mutation and selection,\" which directly contradicts the claim that selection proceeds \"equivalently in extrafollicular foci.\" The premise about ubiquitous AID expression is also an oversimplification not supported by the givens.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. B-$1$ responses undergo greater somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation than B-$2$ responses, because their self-renewal permits cumulative mutation over time and multivalent polysaccharide antigens accelerate selection through strong B cell receptor cross-linking.**\n    This statement incorrectly inverts the relationship. B-$2$ cells undergo more SHM and AM. The reasoning is flawed: B-$1$ cell self-renewal is a property of the population's maintenance, not a mechanism for affinity maturation during an immune response. Strong BCR cross-linking is an activation signal for TI responses, not a substitute for the iterative selection process that drives affinity maturation in GCs.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. B-$2$ responses exhibit somatic hypermutation, but affinity maturation is minimal because selection requires repetitive antigen exposure; B-$1$ responses achieve high affinity rapidly due to strong cross-linking by T-independent antigens that substitutes for selection.**\n    This statement is incorrect. It falsely claims that affinity maturation is \"minimal\" in B-$2$ responses; the givens establish that B-$2$ cells mount robust GC reactions that lead to significant affinity maturation. The GC reaction itself provides the \"repetitive antigen exposure\" through cycling. It also incorrectly suggests B-$1$ cells achieve high affinity, and that BCR cross-linking can substitute for Darwinian selection, both of which are contradicted by the provided principles.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. B-$1$ responses achieve high affinity predominantly by receptor editing in the bone marrow, whereas B-$2$ responses lack activation-induced cytidine deaminase and rely on class-switch recombination only.**\n    This statement contains multiple fundamental errors. Receptor editing is a developmental tolerance mechanism in the bone marrow, not a\n    mechanism for generating high-affinity antibodies to foreign antigens in the periphery. The claim that B-$2$ cells \"lack\" AID is in direct contradiction to the given fact that AID is induced in GCs. Finally, class-switch recombination changes antibody effector function (isotype), not affinity, which is determined by the variable region.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only statement that correctly contrasts the two cell types and provides the correct mechanistic justification based on the provided principles is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2866903"}, {"introduction": "Beyond conceptual models, quantitative biology is essential for evaluating the relative contributions of different cell populations to a physiological state, such as the serum antibody pool.

Consider a mouse model in which peritoneal cavity B-1 cells (the innate-like subset that self-renews and constitutively secretes natural immunoglobulin M) and conventional follicular B-2 cells (which predominantly respond adaptively) are differentially labeled by immunoglobulin heavy-chain allotype. Specifically, recipients are reconstituted such that B-1 cells derive from an IgM allotype-$a$ donor and B-2 cells derive from an IgM allotype-$b$ donor. You wish to compute the absolute B-1–derived immunoglobulin M concentration given the total immunoglobulin M concentration and to estimate the fraction $f$ of serum immunoglobulin M that is B-1–derived.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Antibody in serum is secreted by B cells; total immunoglobulin M concentration is the sum of contributions from distinct cellular sources.\n- Allotype-specific capture-detection assays can distinguish immunoglobulin M of different heavy-chain allotypes with finite cross-reactivity that can be quantified and corrected.\n- In a well-mixed compartment at steady state without catabolic differences by allotype, the fraction of immunoglobulin M from a source equals that source’s immunoglobulin M concentration divided by the total immunoglobulin M concentration.\n\nExperimental design requirement:\n- Outline a rigorous design to estimate the B-1 fraction $f$ using allotype marking, and specify how you will correct for finite cross-reactivity in the assay to recover the true allotype-resolved concentrations.\n\nQuantitative data:\n- The total serum immunoglobulin M concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{IgM}} = 1.10~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n- An allotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantifies allotype-$a$ and allotype-$b$ immunoglobulin M in the same serum.

It represents a coherent, albeit nuanced, problem in quantitative immunology that correctly models experimental data analysis, including the reconciliation of data from different assays.\n\nThe task is to determine the concentration of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) derived from B-1 cells in a specially constructed mouse model. This requires a three-step quantitative analysis: 1. Outlining the experimental and mathematical model; 2. Solving for the true, uncorrupted concentrations of IgM from each source based on cross-reactive assay data; 3. Calculating the final B-1-derived IgM concentration by normalizing to an independently measured total IgM concentration.\n\n**1. Experimental Design and Algebraic Model**\n\nThe experiment utilizes an allotype chimera mouse model. In this model, the hematopoietic system is reconstituted such that distinct B cell populations are sourced from donors with different immunoglobulin heavy-chain allotypes. Specifically, B-1 cells are derived from a donor expressing IgM allotype-$a$, and conventional B-2 cells are from a donor expressing IgM allotype-$b$. This genetic labeling allows for the distinction of their secreted products in the serum.\n\nThe quantification is performed using allotype-specific Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs). Such assays are not perfectly specific and exhibit finite cross-reactivity.

The sum of our calculated true concentrations is $C_{a} + C_{b} = \\frac{0.406 + 0.2716}{0.999} = \\frac{0.6776}{0.999} \\approx 0.6783~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. This value is not equal to the given $C_{\\mathrm{IgM}}$. This discrepancy is common when combining data from different experimental methods. The problem specifies a procedure to resolve this: the ratio derived from the allotype-specific assay is considered reliable, and this ratio is to be applied to the given total concentration.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fraction $f$ of serum IgM that is B-1-derived, based on our corrected values:\n$$ f = \\frac{C_{a}}{C_{a} + C_{b}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.406}{0.999}}{\\frac{0.6776}{0.999}} = \\frac{0.406}{0.6776} $$\nThis fraction $f$ represents the relative contribution of B-1 cells to the total IgM pool.\n$$ f \\approx 0.59917 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the absolute B-1-derived IgM concentration, denoted $C_{B1}$, by multiplying this fraction by the total IgM concentration $C_{\\mathrm{IgM}}$:\n$$ C_{B1} = f \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{IgM}} = \\left( \\frac{0.406}{0.6776} \\right) \\times 1.10~\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\n$$ C_{B1} \\approx 0.59917355 \\times 1.10 \\approx 0.65909090...~\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures as required gives:\n$$ C_{B1} \\approx 0.6591~\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\nThis value represents the reconciled, absolute concentration of IgM originating from the B-1 cell population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6591}\n$$", "id": "2866925"}]}
