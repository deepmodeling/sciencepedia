We shall proceed by first principles as defined in the problem statement.\n\nThe system is governed by three foundational statements:\n1. The definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the number of free receptors, $[A]$ is the concentration of free antigen, and $[RA]$ is the number of antigen-bound receptors on a single cell.\n\n2.

The definition of fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RA]}{R_T}$$\n\nOur first objective is to derive an expression for $\\theta$ as a function of $[A]$ and $K_D$.\nFrom the receptor conservation equation (2), we can express the number of free receptors, $[R]$, in terms of the total and bound receptors:\n$$[R] = R_T - [RA]$$\nWe substitute this expression into the equilibrium equation (1):\n$$K_D = \\frac{(R_T - [RA])[A]}{[RA]}$$\nThe next step is to rearrange this equation to solve for $[RA]$.\n$$K_D [RA] = (R_T - [RA])[A]$$\n$$K_D [RA] = R_T [A] - [RA][A]$$\n$$K_D [RA] + [RA][A] = R_T [A]$$\nFactoring out $[RA]$ on the left side gives:\n$$[RA] (K_D + [A]) = R_T [A]$$\nSolving for the number of bound receptors, $[RA]$, we find:\n$$[RA] = \\frac{R_T [A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[RA]$ into the definition of fractional occupancy, $\\theta$ (equation 3):\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RA]}{R_T} = \\frac{1}{R_T} \\left( \\frac{R_T [A]}{K_D + [A]} \\right)$$\nThe term for the total number of receptors, $R_T$, cancels, yielding the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\nThis result, a form of the Langmuir binding isotherm, shows that the fraction of occupied receptors is dependent only on the antigen concentration and the receptor-antigen dissociation constant, not on the total number of receptors.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the provided data:\nAntigen concentration, $[A] = 8.0 \\text{ nM}$.\nDissociation constant, $K_D = 20.0 \\text{ nM}$.\nThe total receptor number, $R_T = 1.5 \\times 10^5$, is extraneous to this calculation.\n\nSubstituting the values into our derived formula:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{8.0 \\text{ nM}}{20.0 \\text{ nM} + 8.0 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{8.0}{28.0} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.28571428...$$\nAs requested, rounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.2857$$\n\nFinally, we articulate how the equilibrium occupancy, $\\theta$, constrains T-dependent B cell activation. The activation of a B cell is a threshold-dependent process that is fundamentally governed by the absolute number of engaged BCRs, which is given by the product $\\theta \\cdot R_T$. A value of $\\theta$ that is too low will result in a sub-threshold number of engaged receptors, precluding activation. This constraint operates through at least two critical, interconnected mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Antigen Internalization and Presentation:** B cell activation requires the cell to receive help from a cognate T follicular helper (Tfh) cell. This help is contingent upon the B cell's ability to internalize the antigen-BCR complex, process the antigen into peptides, and present these peptides on Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. The density of these peptide-MHC-II complexes on the B cell surface must exceed a certain threshold to form a stable immunological synapse with a Tfh cell. Since the quantity of presented peptide is a function of the quantity of internalized antigen, which is directly proportional to the number of engaged receptors ($[RA] = \\theta \\cdot R_T$), a low value of $\\theta$ leads to insufficient antigen presentation and a failure to secure the necessary T cell-derived survival and differentiation signals.\n\n2.  **BCR Microcluster Formation and Intracellular Signaling:** Antigen binding triggers the spatial reorganization of BCRs on the cell membrane into signaling-competent microclusters. This clustering facilitates the trans-phosphorylation of ITAM motifs on the BCR-associated signaling subunits Ig-$\\alpha$ and Ig-$\\beta$ by Src-family kinases, which in turn recruits and activates the Syk tyrosine kinase. This initiates a signaling cascade that is essential for B cell activation. The formation of stable microclusters and the generation of a sustained signal are highly cooperative processes that depend on a critical density of engaged receptors. If receptor occupancy $\\theta$ is low, engagement is sparse, signaling is weak and transient, and the cell fails to cross the biochemical threshold required for commitment to an activation program.\n\nIn summary, $\\theta$ determines the magnitude of the initial stimulus. The probability of activation is a steeply sigmoidal function of this stimulus. The calculated value $\\theta \\approx 0.2857$ places the B cell at a specific input level, and its subsequent fate depends on whether this input is sufficient to overcome the intrinsic activation barriers of the cell and the extrinsic requirements of the immune microenvironment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2857}$$", "id": "2894584"}, {"introduction": "After a B cell internalizes antigen, it must locate a rare cognate T helper cell to receive the necessary signals for full activation—a process called linked recognition.
