We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe derivation begins from the provided fundamental relationship for the standard Gibbs free energy of binding for the wild-type ($wt$) and mutant ($mut$) receptors.\n\nFor the wild-type receptor:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{wt}} = -R T \\ln K_{A,\\mathrm{wt}} $$\nFor the mutant receptor:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut}} = -R T \\ln K_{A,\\mathrm{mut}} $$\nThe change in the standard binding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, is defined as the difference between the mutant and wild-type free energies:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{wt}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{wt}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (-R T \\ln K_{A,\\mathrm{mut}}) - (-R T \\ln K_{A,\\mathrm{wt}}) $$\nFactoring out the term $-R T$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = -R T (\\ln K_{A,\\mathrm{mut}} - \\ln K_{A,\\mathrm{wt}}) $$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln a - \\ln b = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = -R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{A,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{A,\\mathrm{wt}}}\\right) $$\nThe problem defines the association constant $K_A$ in terms of the dissociation constant $K_D$ as $K_A = 1/K_D$. We substitute this into the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{K_{A,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{A,\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{1/K_{D,\\mathrm{mut}}}{1/K_{D,\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{K_{D,\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{D,\\mathrm{mut}}} = \\left(\\frac{K_{D,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{D,\\mathrm{wt}}}\\right)^{-1} $$\nWe recognize the term in the parenthesis as the definition of the fold change, $f_{K_D}$:\n$$ \\frac{K_{A,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{A,\\mathrm{wt}}} = (f_{K_D})^{-1} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = -R T \\ln\\left((f_{K_D})^{-1}\\right) $$\nUsing another logarithmic identity, $\\ln(a^{-1}) = -\\ln a$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = -R T (-\\ln f_{K_D}) = R T \\ln f_{K_D} $$\nTo find the expression for $f_{K_D}$, we must isolate it.

This is a unitless quantity, as expected for a fold change.\n\nFinally, we address the biological implication of $f_{K_D} < 1$.\nThe fold change is defined as $f_{K_D} = K_{D,\\mathrm{mut}}/K_{D,\\mathrm{wt}}$. A value of $f_{K_D} < 1$ directly implies that $K_{D,\\mathrm{mut}} < K_{D,\\mathrm{wt}}$. The dissociation constant, $K_D$, is an inverse measure of binding affinity; a smaller $K_D$ corresponds to a higher affinity. Therefore, the mutation has resulted in a receptor with higher affinity for the antigen.\nIn the competitive environment of a germinal center, B cells compete for a limited amount of antigen. A B cell expressing a higher-affinity receptor can bind antigen more effectively, particularly at low antigen concentrations. Successful antigen capture and internalization is a prerequisite for receiving T cell help, which in turn provides critical survival and proliferation signals. Consequently, a mutant B cell with $f_{K_D} < 1$ has a competitive advantage, increasing its probability of being positively selected for survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0876}\n$$", "id": "2889542"}, {"introduction": "The generation of antibody diversity via somatic hypermutation (SHM) is not a random process; it is sculpted by a sophisticated molecular machinery that initiates and then processes DNA lesions.

The roles of AID, UNG, and MSH2 as described are accurate and represent the canonical model of SHM. AID initiates the process by creating $U:G$ mismatches. These mismatches are then processed by three distinct, competing pathways: replication (leading to $C:G$ transitions), UNG-dependent BER (leading to $C:G$ transversions), and MSH2-dependent MMR (leading to $A:T$ mutations). The stated hotspot motifs (WRC/GYW for AID, WA/TW for Pol $\\eta$) are also correct. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly structured. It provides a set of initial conditions (three specific knockouts and a wild-type reference) and a set of rules (the foundational facts). The question asks for a qualitative prediction of the mutational spectrum, which is a deducible outcome from the given rules and conditions. A unique set of predictions can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The controlled experimental design (isogenic lines, equal AID expression, no selection differences) ensures that any predicted differences are due solely to the genetic modifications, making the problem objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem of biological reasoning. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe mutational spectrum in each genotype must be determined by analyzing the consequences of removing specific DNA repair pathways, starting from the initial lesion created by AID.\n\n**Baseline: Wild-Type (WT) Cells**\nIn WT cells, all three pathways are active and compete to resolve the $U:G$ mismatch created by AID at WRC/GYW hotspots.\n1.  **Replication Pathway:** A fraction of $U:G$ lesions escape repair and, upon DNA replication, result in $C \\to T$ transitions.\n2.  **UNG/BER Pathway:** UNG excises the uracil, creating an abasic (AP) site. Translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases bypass this AP site, introducing nucleotides that often result in $C:G$ transversions (e.g., $C \\to A$ or $C \\to G$).\n3.  **MSH2/MMR Pathway:** MSH2 (as part of the MSH2-MSH6 complex) recognizes the $U:G$ mismatch. This triggers a repair process involving the error-prone polymerase Pol $\\eta$, which synthesizes a new DNA patch. Pol $\\eta$ has a propensity to introduce errors, predominantly at $A:T$ bases within WA/TW motifs.\n\nTherefore, the WT mutation spectrum consists of:\n- Mutations at both $C:G$ and $A:T$ pairs.\n- $C:G$ mutations are a mixture of transitions and transversions.\n- Two types of hotspot enrichment: at WRC/GYW motifs (the initial AID target) and at WA/TW motifs (the target of the MSH2/Pol $\\eta$ pathway).\n\n**Analysis of Mutant Genotypes**\n\n**1. $Ung^{-/-}$ Genotype:**\n- The UNG/BER pathway is inactivated. The creation of abasic sites from uracil is blocked.\n- Consequently, the pathway that generates $C:G$ transversions is eliminated. All $C:G$ mutations must now arise from the replication pathway, which produces only $C \\to T$ transitions.\n- The $U:G$ lesions are now processed only by the MSH2/MMR pathway and the replication pathway. Since a major competing pathway (UNG) is removed, the flux of $U:G$ lesions into the MSH2 pathway is expected to increase. This leads to more Pol $\\eta$ activity and thus an increase in $A:T$ mutations. The number of $C:G$ mutations decreases (due to loss of the transversion component).\n- **Prediction for $Ung^{-/-}$:**\n    - (i) **$C:G$ mutation class:** Dominated by $C \\to T$ transitions.\n    - (ii) **$A:T$/$C:G$ ratio:** Increased, as $A:T$ mutations (from the now more active MSH2 pathway) increase and $C:G$ transversions are lost.\n    - (iii) **Hotspot usage:** Enrichment at WRC/GYW is preserved because AID targeting is unchanged and leads to $C:G$ transitions. Enrichment at WA/TW motifs is also preserved (and possibly enhanced) because the MSH2/Pol $\\eta$ pathway is fully active.\n\n**2. $Msh2^{-/-}$ Genotype:**\n- The MSH2/MMR pathway is inactivated.\n- This is the sole pathway responsible for generating mutations at $A:T$ bases. Therefore, $A:T$ mutagenesis is expected to be severely reduced or eliminated.\n- The $U:G$ lesions are now processed only by the UNG/BER pathway and the replication pathway. This leads to mutations exclusively at $C:G$ sites. Since MSH2 is no longer competing with UNG, more lesions may be funneled into the UNG pathway, potentially increasing the proportion of $C:G$ transversions.\n- **Prediction for $Msh2^{-/-}$:**\n    - (i) **$C:G$ mutation class:** A mixture of transitions (from replication) and transversions (from UNG). The proportion of transversions may be elevated compared to WT.\n    - (ii) **$A:T$/$C:G$ ratio:** Markedly decreased, approaching zero, due to the loss of the $A:T$ mutation pathway.\n    - (iii) **Hotspot usage:** Enrichment at WRC/GYW is preserved, as all mutations originate from AID's action at these sites. Enrichment at WA/TW motifs is lost because the Pol $\\eta$ pathway responsible for it is inactive.\n\n**3. $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$ Double-Deficient Genotype:**\n- Both the UNG/BER and MSH2/MMR pathways are inactivated.\n- The only remaining mechanism to process the $U:G$ lesion is the replication pathway.\n- AID deaminates C to U, and this U is not repaired. During replication, U pairs with A, leading to a permanent $C:G \\to T:A$ mutation in one daughter cell line. This is a $C \\to T$ transition.\n- **Prediction for $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$:**\n    - (i) **$C:G$ mutation class:** Consists almost exclusively of $C \\to T$ transitions.\n    - (ii) **$A:T$/$C:G$ ratio:** No $A:T$ mutations are generated, so the ratio is practically zero. All mutations are at $C:G$ sites.\n    - (iii) **Hotspot usage:** Mutations are a direct readout of AID activity. Therefore, enrichment at WRC/GYW motifs is preserved and very strong. Enrichment at WA/TW motifs is absent.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $Ung^{-/-}$: $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio increased; $C:G$ class dominated by transitions; strong enrichment at WRC/GYW and preserved WA/TW enrichment. $Msh2^{-/-}$: $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio markedly decreased; elevated $C:G$ transversions alongside transitions; WRC/GYW enrichment preserved but WA/TW enrichment lost. $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$: $A:T$ mutations approach zero; $C:G$ nearly exclusively transitions; WRC/GYW enrichment preserved and WA/TW enrichment absent.**\n- The description for $Ung^{-/-}$ matches our prediction perfectly.\n- The description for $Msh2^{-/-}$ matches our prediction, including the plausible detail of elevated transversions.\n- The description for $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$ also matches our prediction precisely.\nThis option is fully consistent with the established model of SHM.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $Ung^{-/-}$: $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio decreased; $C:G$ class dominated by transversions; loss of WRC/GYW enrichment but preserved WA/TW enrichment. $Msh2^{-/-}$: $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio increased; $C:G$ class dominated by transitions; WA/TW enrichment enhanced. $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$: Balanced $A:T$ and $C:G$ mutations with random hotspot usage.**\n- The $Ung^{-/-}$ description is incorrect on multiple points. The ratio should increase, not decrease. $C:G$ mutations should be transitions, not transversions (the UNG pathway for transversions is knocked out).\n- The $Msh2^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. The $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio should decrease, not increase.\n- The $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. $A:T$ mutations should be absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $Ung^{-/-}$: $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio unchanged; $C:G$ class unchanged from wild type; hotspot usage unchanged across all motifs. $Msh2^{-/-}$: $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio unchanged; modest reduction in both hotspots. $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$: Global reduction in mutations with loss of all hotspot enrichments.**\n- The $Ung^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. Removing a key repair pathway (UNG) must alter the balance of mutations ($A:T$/$C:G$ ratio) and the types of mutations at $C:G$ sites (loss of transversions). Claiming no change is illogical.\n- The $Msh2^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. Loss of MSH2 has a drastic effect on the $A:T$/$C:G$ ratio, not \"unchanged\".\n- The $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. All mutations are now direct $C \\to T$ transitions at AID hotspots, so WRC/GYW enrichment should be very strong, not lost.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $Ung^{-/-}$: $A:T$ mutations eliminated; $C:G$ class shifts to transversions with loss of WRC/GYW enrichment. $Msh2^{-/-}$: $A:T$ mutations dominate with strong WA/TW enrichment and reduced WRC/GYW usage. $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$: $C:G$ transversions dominate with preserved WA/TW enrichment.**\n- The $Ung^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. $A:T$ mutations are generated by the intact MSH2 pathway. $C:G$ mutations shift to transitions, not transversions.\n- The $Msh2^{-/-}$ description is incorrect. In MSH2 knockout, $A:T$ mutations are the ones that are eliminated, not dominant.\n- The $Ung^{-/-} Msh2^{-/-}$ description is incorrect.

The provided data are:\n- Observed nonsynonymous mutations, $N_{obs, \\mathrm{FR}} = 18$.\n- Observed synonymous mutations, $S_{obs, \\mathrm{FR}} = 12$.\n- Effective nonsynonymous sites, $S_{N, \\mathrm{FR}} = 480$.\n- Effective synonymous sites, $S_{S, \\mathrm{FR}} = 160$.\n\nWe compute $dN_{\\mathrm{FR}}$ and $dS_{\\mathrm{FR}}$:\n$$dN_{\\mathrm{FR}} = \\frac{N_{obs, \\mathrm{FR}}}{S_{N, \\mathrm{FR}}} = \\frac{18}{480} = \\frac{3}{80}$$\n$$dS_{\\mathrm{FR}} = \\frac{S_{obs, \\mathrm{FR}}}{S_{S, \\mathrm{FR}}} = \\frac{12}{160} = \\frac{3}{40}$$\n\nThe ratio $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FR}}$ for the FR is:\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{FR}} = (dN/dS)_{\\mathrm{FR}} = \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{FR}}}{dS_{\\mathrm{FR}}} = \\frac{3/80}{3/40} = \\frac{3}{80} \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{40}{80} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSince $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FR}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 < 1$, this result indicates purifying (negative) selection acting on the FR. This is consistent with the need to conserve the structural integrity of the immunoglobulin fold.\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R$, defined as the ratio of the two $\\omega$ values.\n$$R \\equiv \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{CDR}}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{FR}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$R = \\frac{7/3}{1/2} = \\frac{7}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{14}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $R = 4.6666...$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 4.667$$\nThis value quantifies the disparity in selective pressures, showing that the positive selection in the CDR is substantially stronger than the purifying selection in the FR, relative to their respective neutral mutation rates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.667}$$", "id": "2889451"}]}
