Before we analyze the pathway's kinetics or assembly, it is crucial to understand the biochemical foundation of its key enzyme. This first practice uses a thought experiment involving a targeted mutation to explore the indispensable nature of the MASP-2 active site, reinforcing how fundamental principles of enzymology govern this vital immune response.

Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is pre-incubated to bind the surface, and then one of two conditions is applied: either wild-type MASP-2 (MBL-associated serine protease-2) or a MASP-2 variant bearing an active-site mutation $S \\to A$ in the catalytic serine. The system contains purified C4, C2, and C3, physiological $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and no other proteases (in particular, MASP-1/MASP-3 are absent).

Abolished C4 cleavage, but spontaneous C2 activation suffices to form C4b2a and drive minimal C3b deposition.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed biochemical question grounded in the established principles of enzymology and immunology. It describes a controlled *in vitro* experiment to probe the function of a specific protein, MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), within the lectin complement pathway. The conditions are clearly defined, including the composition of the system and the specific mutation introduced. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing this system are:\n1. The catalytic mechanism of serine proteases.\n2. The sequential activation cascade of the lectin complement pathway.\n\n**Principle 1: Serine Protease Catalysis and the Effect of the $S \\to A$ Mutation**\n\nSerine proteases, such as MASP-2, utilize a catalytic triad in their active site, which classically includes a serine (Ser) residue. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of this serine acts as a potent nucleophile to attack the peptide bond of the substrate, initiating catalysis. The problem states that this catalytic serine is mutated to an alanine (Ala), a mutation denoted as $S \\to A$. An alanine residue possesses a methyl group (-CH$_3$) as its side chain. This group is chemically inert, non-polar, and cannot function as a nucleophile. Therefore, a MASP-2 protein bearing an $S \\to A$ mutation in its active site is catalytically inactive or \"dead\". It can no longer perform its proteolytic function. This is not a mutation that merely reduces activity; it abolishes it entirely.\n\n**Principle 2: The Lectin Pathway Cascade**\n\nThe sequence of events in the reconstituted system with wild-type MASP-2 would be as follows:\na. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) binds to the mannan-coated surface.\nb. This binding induces a conformational change in the associated MASP-2 zymogen, activating its protease function.\nc. Active MASP-2 cleaves its first substrate, complement component 4 (C4), into a small fragment C4a and a large fragment C4b.\nd. The nascent C4b fragment contains a reactive internal thioester bond that allows it to covalently attach to the surface near the site of activation. This is measured as \"surface C4b deposition\".\ne. Active MASP-2 also cleaves its second substrate, complement component 2 (C2), into C2a and C2b. This cleavage is most efficient when C2 is bound to surface-deposited C4b. The generation of the C2a fragment is measured as \"fluid-phase C2a generation\".\nf. The C2a fragment associates with surface-bound C4b to form the bimolecular complex C4b2a. This complex is the C3 convertase of the lectin pathway.\ng. The C4b2a convertase is an active enzyme (with the proteolytic site residing in the C2a subunit) that cleaves complement component 3 (C3) into C3a and C3b.\nh. The resulting C3b fragment, like C4b, has a reactive thioester and deposits onto the surface. This is \"surface C3b deposition\".\n\n**Analysis of the System with Mutant MASP-2**\n\nNow, we replace the wild-type MASP-2 with the catalytically inactive $S \\to A$ mutant.\n- The initial binding of MBL to the mannan-coated surface is a protein-carbohydrate interaction and is independent of the proteolytic activity of its associated proteases. The problem confirms this is preserved. The inactive MASP-2 remains complexed with MBL.\n- When the cascade should begin (step b), the MASP-2 mutant, despite undergoing conformational changes upon MBL binding, cannot cleave any substrates because its catalytic machinery has been ablated (Principle 1).\n- Therefore, MASP-2 cannot cleave C4. No C4b is generated, and thus there will be zero surface C4b deposition.\n- Similarly, MASP-2 cannot cleave C2. No C2a is generated, and thus there will be zero fluid-phase C2a generation.\n- Since neither C4b nor C2a is produced, the C3 convertase (C4b2a) cannot be assembled.\n- Without the C3 convertase, C3 will not be cleaved. No C3b will be generated, and thus there will be zero surface C3b deposition.\n\nIn summary, the mutation halts the entire proteolytic cascade at its inception. All readouts downstream of MBL binding—C4b deposition, C2a generation, and C3b deposition—will be at baseline, undetectable levels.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. No detectable C4 or C2 cleavage and no C3b deposition; MBL binding to mannan is preserved but the proteolytic steps fail.**\nThis statement accurately describes the predicted outcome. The catalytically dead MASP-2 cannot initiate cleavage of C4 or C2. Consequently, no C3 convertase forms, and no C3b is deposited. The initial recognition step of MBL binding is unaffected.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Normal C4 cleavage but no C2 cleavage, leading to accumulation of surface C4b without C3b deposition.**\nThis is incorrect. The $S \\to A$ mutation ablates the single catalytic site of MASP-2. It is mechanistically impossible for the enzyme to cleave one substrate (C4) but not another (C2) when the tool for cleavage itself has been destroyed. The premise of \"Normal C4 cleavage\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Partial C4 and C2 cleavage at reduced rates, yielding a low but measurable level of C3b deposition.**\nThis is incorrect. An $S \\to A$ mutation in a catalytic serine is not expected to cause a partial reduction in activity (a hypomorphic phenotype). It is a functional null mutation. The methyl group of alanine cannot substitute for the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of serine in any meaningful way. There is no basis for expecting any cleavage, even at reduced rates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No change in any readout because MASP-1 functionally compensates for MASP-2 in the reconstituted system.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem statement explicitly and critically states that the system is reconstituted with purified components and that \"MASP-1/MASP-3 are absent\". Therefore, functional compensation by MASP-1 is impossible, as it is not present. This option contradicts the given experimental conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Abolished C4 cleavage, but spontaneous C2 activation suffices to form C4b2a and drive minimal C3b deposition.**\nThis statement is internally contradictory and factually flawed. It correctly posits that C4 cleavage is abolished. However, it then claims the formation of C4b2a. The formation of this complex requires C4b as a scaffold. If C4 cleavage is abolished, there is no C4b, and C4b2a cannot form. The idea of \"spontaneous C2 activation\" is also not a significant pathway; C2 activation requires cleavage by a protease, which in this pathway is MASP-2.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2898691"}, {"introduction": "Once activated, the speed at which MASP-2 cleaves its substrates determines the tempo of the downstream immune response.

The problem is self-contained and free of internal contradictions. The request to use the Michaelis-Menten model is appropriate for the described conditions (initial rate, single substrate, negligible product inhibition).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the initial rate of C4a generation, which we denote as $v_0$. The problem states that this rate is equivalent to the rate of consumption of the substrate, C4. Under the specified conditions (initial-rate, quasi–steady-state approximation), this rate is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]_0}{K_m + [S]_0}\n$$\nwhere $[S]_0$ is the initial substrate concentration and $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum reaction rate.\n\nThe maximum rate $V_{\\max}$ is defined as:\n$$\nV_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{active}}\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the turnover number and $[E]_{\\mathrm{active}}$ is the concentration of the catalytically active enzyme, in this case, MASP-2.\n\nIt is necessary to first determine $[E]_{\\mathrm{active}}$ from the total amount of MASP-2 supplied, $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The problem provides a sequence of events that reduce the total enzyme concentration to the final active concentration.\n\n1.  The total concentration of MASP-2 is given as $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n\n2.  A fraction $f_{\\mathrm{bind}} = 0.75$ of this total amount binds to the MBL-decorated surface. The concentration of bound MASP-2, $[E]_{\\mathrm{bound}}$, is:\n    $$\n    [E]_{\\mathrm{bound}} = [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{bind}}\n    $$\n\n3.  Of this bound population, a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{act}} = 0.80$ becomes activated. The concentration of activated MASP-2 before accounting for inhibition, $[E]_{\\mathrm{act, gross}}$, is:\n    $$\n    [E]_{\\mathrm{act, gross}} = [E]_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{act}} = [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{act}}\n    $$\n\n4.  Finally, a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 0.10$ of the catalytically active MASP-2 is inactivated by C1-INH. This means the fraction that remains active is $(1 - f_{\\mathrm{inh}})$. The final concentration of catalytically competent MASP-2, $[E]_{\\mathrm{active}}$, is therefore:\n    $$\n    [E]_{\\mathrm{active}} = [E]_{\\mathrm{act, gross}} \\times (1 - f_{\\mathrm{inh}}) = [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{act}} \\times (1 - f_{\\mathrm{inh}})\n    $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n[E]_{\\mathrm{active}} = (8.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (0.75) \\times (0.80) \\times (1 - 0.10)\n$$\n$$\n[E]_{\\mathrm{active}} = (8.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (0.75) \\times (0.80) \\times (0.90)\n$$\n$$\n[E]_{\\mathrm{active}} = (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (0.80) \\times (0.90)\n$$\n$$\n[E]_{\\mathrm{active}} = (4.8\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (0.90) = 4.32\\ \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nThe concentration of active MASP-2 is $4.32\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate $V_{\\max}$ using the given $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 9.5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\nV_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{active}} = (9.5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (4.32\\ \\mathrm{nM}) = 41.04\\ \\mathrm{nM}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nWith $V_{\\max}$, we can compute the initial rate $v_0$ using the Michaelis-Menten equation.

The use of reconstituted serum with specific component depletions and inhibitions is a standard experimental technique. The genetic deficiency of C2 is a known immunodeficiency. The premises are not contradictory; the conditions are clearly specified to isolate the lectin pathway and test the effect of a specific molecular absence. The problem asks for a logical deduction from the given principles and conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe lectin pathway of complement is initiated when Pattern Recognition Molecules (PRMs), such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL), recognize and bind to carbohydrate patterns on a surface. In this experiment, the mannan-coated surface serves as the target for MBL, which is stated to be present and functional.\n\n1.  Binding of MBL to the mannan surface leads to the activation of MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2. The problem states these are present and active.\n2.  Activated MASP-2 cleaves complement component C4 into two fragments, a smaller anaphylatoxin C4a and a larger fragment C4b. The C4b fragment can covalently attach to the activating surface. This step proceeds normally in the described system.\n3.  The next step in the canonical lectin pathway, as stated in principle (i), is the cleavage of complement component C2 by MASP-2. This cleavage would produce fragments C2a (the larger, proteolytically active fragment) and C2b.\n4.  According to principle (ii), the C2a fragment would then bind to the surface-bound C4b to form the complex C4b2a. This complex is the C3 convertase of the classical and lectin pathways.\n5.  The central condition of the problem is a complete genetic deficiency of C2. This means there is no C2 protein in the serum. Consequently, MASP-2 cannot cleave C2, and the C2a fragment cannot be generated.\n6.  Without the C2a fragment, the C3 convertase, C4b2a, cannot be assembled. The cascade is arrested at this critical step.\n7.  Since the C3 convertase is absent, complement component C3 will not be cleaved into C3a and C3b. Therefore, there will be no deposition of C3b on the surface (i.e., no C3 opsonization). Measurement of surface C3 cleavage products will yield a null result.\n8.  The formation of the C5 convertase, C4b2a3b, requires both the initial C4b2a complex and the subsequent attachment of a C3b molecule. Since neither the C4b2a complex nor C3b can be formed, the C5 convertase cannot be assembled.\n9.  In the absence of a C5 convertase, complement component C5 is not cleaved into C5a and C5b.\n10. As stated in principle (iii), the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) is initiated by C5b. Without the generation of C5b, the terminal pathway involving C6, C7, C8, and C9 cannot proceed. Lytic activity attributable to the MAC will be zero.\n\nIn summary, the complete absence of C2 constitutes an absolute block in the lectin pathway cascade after the step of C4 cleavage. All subsequent events, including C3 cleavage, C5 cleavage, and MAC formation, are abolished.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. With C2 deficiency, C4b2a and C4b2a3b cannot form; lectin pathway–mediated C3 opsonization and C5b–C9 MAC assembly are abolished despite intact PRMs and MASPs.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derived consequences. The absence of C2 prevents formation of the C3 convertase (C4b2a), which in turn prevents the formation of the C5 convertase (C4b2a3b). This failure abrogates all downstream functions, including C3 deposition and MAC assembly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. C3 convertase formation is preserved because MASP-1 directly cleaves C3 on the surface; however, C5 convertase formation fails, yielding absent MAC with normal C3 deposition.**\nThis option proposes an alternative mechanism for C3 cleavage by MASP-1. While some studies suggest such an activity, it is not the canonical, efficient pathway. More importantly, it contradicts principle (ii) provided in the problem statement, which explicitly defines the lectin pathway C3 convertase as C4b2a. Following the rules of the problem, we must adhere to the given principles. The claim of \"normal C3 deposition\" through such a secondary mechanism is highly improbable and inconsistent with textbook immunology and the problem's own framework.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. C2 deficiency is bypassed by recruitment of C2b into the convertase; C3 and C5 convertases assemble normally when PRMs and MASPs are intact.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. First, if there is a complete genetic deficiency of C2, no C2 protein is available to be cleaved, so neither C2a nor C2b can be generated. Second, even if C2 were present, it is the C2a fragment that contains the serine protease domain and is incorporated into the C4b2a convertase, not the smaller C2b fragment. This option is biologically nonsensical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Alternative pathway amplification on deposited C4b restores C3bBb and thereby rescues C5 convertase and MAC formation under lectin initiation, so overall lytic activity is near normal.**\nThis option is directly contradicted by the experimental setup. The problem explicitly states that the alternative pathway is disabled using a factor D inhibitor. Factor D is the protease that cleaves Factor B (bound to C3b) to form the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. Without active Factor D, the alternative pathway is non-functional and cannot provide any amplification or rescue mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2898673"}]}
