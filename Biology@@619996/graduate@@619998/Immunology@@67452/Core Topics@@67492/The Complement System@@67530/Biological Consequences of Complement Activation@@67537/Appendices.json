The combination of recent pharyngitis, hematuria with red blood cell casts, and edema is a textbook scenario for post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN), often post-streptococcal. The use of complement studies to investigate the underlying immunopathology of glomerulonephritis is a standard and fundamental practice in immunology and nephrology. The provided laboratory values are consistent with known patterns of complement activation in such diseases. The problem is firmly grounded in established medical science.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a specific clinical context and a complete set of relevant laboratory data with reference ranges. The question asks for an interpretation of these data to identify the involved complement pathway and formulate a differential diagnosis. This is a well-defined task with a unique, scientifically supported solution.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is composed of objective clinical observations and quantitative laboratory measurements. There are no subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The data are sufficient for a competent analysis. The clinical history (pharyngitis) and the lab profile (low $C3$, normal $C4$) are internally consistent and point toward a specific category of immunological pathology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a realistic and non-trivial diagnostic challenge. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed to a full solution.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe complement system is a crucial part of the innate immune system. Its activation can occur via three primary pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways, all of which converge to cleave component `$C3$` and activate the terminal pathway (`$C5-C9$`).\n\n1.  **The Classical Pathway** is typically initiated by antigen-antibody complexes. Its activation consumes early components `$C1q$`, `$C1r$`, `$C1s$`, `$C4$`, and `$C2$`, which then leads to the consumption of `$C3$`. Therefore, significant classical pathway activation is characterized by low levels of both `$C4$` and `$C3$`.\n2.  **The Lectin Pathway** is initiated by the binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to carbohydrates on pathogen surfaces. It also proceeds through cleavage of `$C4$` and `$C2$`, leading to `$C3$` consumption. Its activation profile, therefore, also involves low `$C4$` and low `$C3$`.\n3.  **The Alternative Pathway** can be activated directly by certain pathogen surfaces or through spontaneous low-level hydrolysis of `$C3$` (tick-over). It bypasses `$C1$`, `$C4$`, and `$C2$`, directly consuming `$C3$` with the help of Factor B, Factor D, and Properdin. Therefore, isolated or predominant activation of the alternative pathway is characterized by **low `$C3$` with a normal `$C4$`**.\n\nThe functional assays provided are:\n*   **$CH50$ (Total Hemolytic Complement):** This measures the function of the entire classical and terminal pathways. A low value indicates a deficiency or consumption of any component from `$C1$` through `$C9$`.\n*   **$AH50$ (Alternative Pathway Hemolytic Complement):** This measures the function of the alternative and terminal pathways. A low value indicates a deficiency or consumption of an alternative pathway component (Factor B, Factor D, Properdin) or a shared terminal component (`$C3$`, `$C5-C9$`).\n\n**Analysis of Patient Data**\n\n*   `$C3 = 38$` mg/dL (low): This indicates significant and ongoing complement activation leading to `$C3$` consumption.\n*   `$C4 = 26$` mg/dL (normal): This is the most discriminating finding. A normal `$C4$` level effectively rules out significant activation of the classical or lectin pathways, as both would consume `$C4$`.\n*   `$CH50 = 12$` U/mL (low): The classical pathway functional assay is low. Since the classical pathway itself is not being activated (normal `$C4$`), this low value must be due to the consumption of a downstream component shared by all pathways, namely `$C3$`. The profound depletion of `$C3$` prevents the classical pathway from proceeding to completion in this *in vitro* assay.\n*   `$AH50 = 9$` U/mL (low): The alternative pathway functional assay is low. This confirms that there is a defect in this pathway, which, in the context of a low `$C3$`, is due to consumption of alternative pathway components, including `$C3$` itself.\n\n**Conclusion:** The aformentioned pattern—low `$C3$`, normal `$C4$`, low `$CH50$`, and low `$AH50$`—is the definitive signature of **predominant alternative pathway activation and consumption**.\n\nThe clinical presentation of acute nephritic syndrome following pharyngitis, coupled with this complement profile, directs the differential diagnosis towards conditions driven by alternative pathway dysregulation. This includes:\n1.  **Post-Infectious Glomerulonephritis (PIGN):** The most probable diagnosis in this context. Certain bacterial antigens can directly trigger and amplify the alternative pathway. The condition is typically self-limited.\n2.  **`$C3$` Glomerulopathy (`$C3G$`):** A category of rare kidney diseases characterized by dysregulation of the alternative pathway. This can be caused by acquired factors (e.g., `$C3$` nephritic factor, an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative pathway `$C3$`-convertase) or genetic mutations in complement regulatory proteins (e.g., Factor H, Factor I). An acute infection can be a trigger that unmasks an underlying predisposition to `$C3G$`.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Predominant alternative pathway activation and consumption; differential includes $C3$ glomerulopathy driven by $C3$ nephritic factor, complement factor H or factor I deficiency, and post-infectious glomerulonephritis**\nThis option correctly identifies the pathway based on the low `$C3$` and normal `$C4$` profile. The differential diagnosis provided is scientifically impeccable. It includes the most likely acute, consumption-driven state (PIGN) and correctly identifies the chronic/genetic states of alternative pathway dysregulation (`$C3G$` due to `$C3$` nephritic factor, and deficiencies of the regulators Factor H or I) that present identically.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Predominant classical pathway deficiency or consumption; differential includes C2 deficiency and active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) flare**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Classical pathway activation is defined by consumption of `$C4$`. The patient's `$C4$` level is normal. SLE nephritis typically presents with low `$C3$` **and** low `$C4$`. An isolated `$C2$` deficiency would cause a low `$CH50$` but would not, in itself, cause consumption of `$C3$`. The patient's clinical signs (no rash, no arthritis) also argue against SLE.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Predominant terminal pathway deficiency; differential centers on inherited C5–C9 deficiency with recurrent Neisseria infections**\nThis option is erroneous. An isolated deficiency of a terminal component (`$C5$`–`$C9$`) would result in a low `$CH50$` and low `$AH50$`, as these assays cannot complete. However, the levels of upstream components, specifically `$C3$` and `$C4$`, would be normal. This patient has a severely depleted `$C3$`. Furthermore, the clinical manifestation of terminal pathway deficiency is susceptibility to *Neisseria* infections, not glomerulonephritis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Predominant isolated classical pathway overactivation due to C1 inhibitor deficiency; differential includes hereditary angioedema and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple logical grounds. First, `$C1$` inhibitor deficiency leads to uncontrolled cleavage of `$C4$` and `$C2$`, resulting in a very low `$C4$` level, which contradicts the patient's data. `$C3$` is typically not consumed. Second, the clinical manifestation is angioedema due to bradykinin overproduction, not the nephritic syndrome seen in this patient. The periorbital edema here is due to renal fluid retention.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Predominant alternative pathway component deficiency; differential includes factor B, factor D, or properdin deficiency with normal upstream components**\nThis option demonstrates a misunderstanding of complement pathology. A deficiency of an activating component of the alternative pathway (Factor B, D, or Properdin) would *impair* its function, not cause overactivation. Such a deficiency would lead to a low `$AH50$` but would result in normal `$C3$` levels, as the pathway would be unable to consume `$C3$`. The patient's data show profound `$C3$` *consumption*, indicating pathway *overactivation*.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2836540"}, {"introduction": "The development of targeted therapeutics represents a paradigm shift in treating immune-mediated diseases.

Patient Y has an autoimmune hemolytic process dominated by extravascular clearance of red blood cells via complement opsonization; the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is positive for `$C3d$` on erythrocytes, and splenic macrophages show increased uptake of `$C3b$`-coated cells. The clinician wants to choose between inhibiting complement component `$C5$` versus `$C3$`, and also to anticipate the most likely differences in infectious and immunopathologic risks across the two strategies. Based only on foundational definitions of complement activation (that is, that `$C3$` cleavage yields the opsonin `$C3b$` and the anaphylatoxin `$C3a$`, and that `$C5$` cleavage initiates assembly of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) through `$C5b$`–`$C9$` leading to direct lysis, with `$C5a$` as a potent chemoattractant), which of the following strategies best aligns with the dominant pathophysiology in each patient and most accurately predicts differential side-effect profiles?\n\nA.

Cleavage of `$C5$` initiates the assembly of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) via `$C5b$`–`$C9$`, which leads to direct cellular lysis.\n    3.  Cleavage of `$C5$` also produces `$C5a$`, a potent chemoattractant.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The clinical scenarios described for Patient X (PNH) and Patient Y (complement-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia) are accurate representations of real-world pathologies. PNH pathophysiology is correctly linked to the loss of regulators like `$CD55$` and `$CD59$`, leading to MAC-mediated intravascular hemolysis. The description of Patient Y's condition, with `$C3b$`-mediated opsonization leading to extravascular hemolysis by splenic macrophages, is a classic mechanism of autoimmune hemolysis. The foundational definitions of `$C3$` and `$C5$` function are a correct, albeit simplified, summary from immunology.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct clinical cases and a clear set of rules (the foundational definitions) from which to deduce the most logical therapeutic intervention and its consequences. It asks for a comparative analysis, which is a standard format for problems in clinical reasoning. The problem is self-contained and does not contain contradictory information. All terms are Eobjective and clearly defined within the context of immunology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe complement system has two principal effector pathways relevant to this problem:\n1.  **Opsonization for Phagocytosis:** Mediated primarily by the deposition of `$C3b$` on a target surface.\n2.  **Terminal Cytolysis:** Mediated by the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC, composed of `$C5b$`–`$C9$`).\n\nThe cascade is sequential: activation leads to the formation of a `$C3$` convertase, which cleaves `$C3$` into `$C3a$` and `$C3b$`. The `$C3b$` component can then participate in forming a `$C5$` convertase, which cleaves `$C5$` into `$C5a$` and `$C5b$`. `$C5b$` initiates MAC formation. Therefore, inhibition of `$C3$` will block all downstream events, including both `$C3b$`-mediated opsonization and MAC-dependent lysis. Inhibition of `$C5$` is more distal; it will block only MAC formation and `$C5a$` generation, while preserving the upstream functions of `$C3b$` and `$C3a$`.\n\n**Analysis of Patient X (PNH):**\nThe pathology is specified as **intravascular hemolysis**. The erythrocytes lack protective proteins (`$CD55$` and `$CD59$`), making them susceptible to attack by the complement system. Based on the provided definitions, direct cell lysis is caused by the MAC. Therefore, the primary therapeutic goal is to prevent MAC formation. Inhibition of `$C5$` cleavage directly blocks the initial step of MAC assembly (formation of `$C5b$`) and is the most targeted approach to prevent intravascular hemolysis. This strategy preserves upstream complement functions, including the generation of the opsonin `$C3b$`. The primary adverse effect of `$C5$` inhibition is the loss of MAC-mediated bactericidal activity, which is particularly critical for defense against Neisseria species, most notably *Neisseria meningitidis*.\n\n**Analysis of Patient Y (Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia):**\nThe pathology is specified as **extravascular clearance** via **complement opsonization**, with splenic macrophages taking up **`$C3b$`-coated cells**. This pathology is driven by the opsonin `$C3b$`, not by the MAC. The therapeutic goal is to prevent the opsonization of erythrocytes with `$C3b$`. Therefore, the logical intervention is to inhibit `$C3$` cleavage. This prevents the formation of `$C3b$`, thereby halting the signal for phagocytosis by splenic macrophages. `$C5$` inhibition would be ineffective, as it would not stop the deposition of `$C3b$`. The consequence of `$C3$` inhibition is a profound and broad complement deficiency. The loss of `$C3b$` severely impairs opsonophagocytosis, leading to increased susceptibility to a wide range of encapsulated bacteria. Furthermore, `$C3b$` is essential for the clearance of immune complexes; its absence increases the risk of immune complex-mediated diseases.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Prefer `$C5$` inhibition for Patient X to prevent MAC-mediated intravascular hemolysis while preserving `$C3b$`-mediated opsonophagocytosis; accept increased susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis, with opsonization and immune complex clearance largely intact. Prefer `$C3$` inhibition for Patient Y to block `$C3b$` deposition and splenic clearance; anticipate broader susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria and impaired immune complex clearance.**\n- For Patient X: This statement correctly identifies `$C5$` inhibition as the targeted therapy for MAC-mediated lysis, correctly notes the preservation of `$C3b$` functions (opsonization, immune complex clearance), and correctly identifies the specific risk of *Neisseria* infection.\n- For Patient Y: This statement correctly identifies `$C3$` inhibition as the appropriate therapy to block `$C3b$`-mediated opsonization and correctly predicts the consequences of broad complement blockade: susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria and impaired immune complex clearance.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.

Impaired immune complex clearance is a hallmark of `$C3$` deficiency, not `$C5$` deficiency.\n- For Patient X: This is incorrect. `$C3$` inhibition prevents the formation of the `$C5$` convertase, thus it absolutely does not \"spare MAC\". It would cause, not avoid, bacterial infections.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Prefer `$C3$` inhibition for Patient Y but anticipate primarily selective loss of `$C5a$` with preserved `$C3b$` opsonization; risk is chiefly attenuated neutrophil chemotaxis without increased infections by encapsulated bacteria.

The claim that `$C3b$` opsonization is \"preserved\" is a direct contradiction. Consequently, the claim of no increased risk of infection from encapsulated bacteria is false.\n- For Patient X: This is incorrect. `$C5$` inhibition carries a well-established, clinically significant risk of meningococcal disease. The statement \"no meaningful infectious risk\" is false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.

Prefer `$C3$` inhibition for Patient Y to reduce extravascular opsonization while preserving MAC formation and resistance to Neisseria.**\n- For Patient X: This is incorrect. `$C5$` inhibition preserves `$C3b$`, it does not cause its loss. The bacterial risk is not minimal.\n- For Patient Y: This is incorrect. `$C3$` inhibition prevents MAC formation because `$C3b$` is a necessary component of the `$C5$` convertase.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the provided principles, only option A provides a logically and immunologically sound analysis for both patients.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2836510"}, {"introduction": "Modern immunology increasingly relies on quantitative and computational models to understand complex biological systems.

All entries are floats representing $\\mu$M.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. The provided parameters and reaction scheme constitute a valid basis for deriving a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the dynamics of complement activation. The problem is a standard exercise in systems biology and is solvable as stated.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Dynamical System\n\nThe system is described by the time evolution of five species concentrations: $C_3(t)$, $C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$, $iC_{\\text{3b}}(t)$, $E(t)$, and $I(t)$. We will derive the ODE for each species by applying the Law of Mass Action to the specified reaction scheme. For any species $X$, its rate of change, $\\frac{d[X]}{dt}$, is the sum of the rates of all reactions producing it minus the sum of the rates of all reactions consuming it. All concentrations are in units of $\\mu$M and time is in seconds (s).\n\nLet the vector of state variables be $y(t) = [C_3(t), C_{\\text{3b}}(t), iC_{\\text{3b}}(t), E(t), I(t)]^T$.\n\n**1. Rate of change of native C3, $\\frac{dC_3}{dt}$**\nThe concentration of local native $C_3$ is governed by three processes:\n- A constant influx (source) term, $s$, with units $\\mu\\text{M s}^{-1}$.\n- Consumption via cleavage catalyzed by the convertase $E(t)$. The reaction is $C_3 + E \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{cleave}}} C_{\\text{3b}} + E$. The rate of this reaction is $v_{\\text{cleave}} = k_{\\mathrm{cleave}} C_3(t) E(t)$.\n- A first-order loss term, $-k_{\\mathrm{out}} C_3(t)$, representing diffusion away from the surface.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the first ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dC_3}{dt} = s - k_{\\mathrm{cleave}} C_3(t) E(t) - k_{\\mathrm{out}} C_3(t) $$\n\n**2. Rate of change of active C3b, $\\frac{dC_{\\text{3b}}}{dt}$**\nThe concentration of surface-bound active $C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$ changes due to four processes:\n- Production from the cleavage of $C_3$. Only a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{deposit}}$ of the cleaved $C_3$ successfully deposits as active $C_{\\text{3b}}$ on the surface. The production rate is $+f_{\\mathrm{deposit}} v_{\\text{cleave}} = +f_{\\mathrm{deposit}} k_{\\mathrm{cleave}} C_3(t) E(t)$.\n- Production from the spontaneous decay of the convertase $E(t)$ via the reaction $E \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{decay}}} C_{\\text{3b}}$. The rate is $+k_{\\mathrm{decay}} E(t)$.\n- Consumption to form new convertase via the reaction $C_{\\text{3b}} + B \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{form}}} E$. As factor B is assumed constant at $B_0$, this is a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to $C_{\\text{3b}}$. The consumption rate is $-k_{\\mathrm{form}} B_0 C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$.\n- Consumption via inactivation by the inhibitor $I(t)$ via the reaction $I + C_{\\text{3b}} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{inact}}} iC_{\\text{3b}}$. The consumption rate is $-k_{\\mathrm{inact}} I(t) C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the second ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\text{3b}}}{dt} = f_{\\mathrm{deposit}} k_{\\mathrm{cleave}} C_3(t) E(t) + k_{\\mathrm{decay}} E(t) - k_{\\mathrm{form}} B_0 C_{\\text{3b}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{inact}} I(t) C_{\\text{3b}}(t) $$\n\n**3. Rate of change of inactive iC3b, $\\frac{diC_{\\text{3b}}}{dt}$**\nThe concentration of surface-bound inactive $iC_{\\text{3b}}(t)$ is determined by two processes:\n- Production from the inactivation of $C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$ by the inhibitor $I(t)$. The rate is $+k_{\\mathrm{inact}} I(t) C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$.\n- A first-order clearance term, representing removal from the surface, with rate $-k_{\\mathrm{clear}} iC_{\\text{3b}}(t)$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the third ODE:\n$$ \\frac{diC_{\\text{3b}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{inact}} I(t) C_{\\text{3b}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{clear}} iC_{\\text{3b}}(t) $$\n\n**4. Rate of change of convertase activity, $\\frac{dE}{dt}$**\nThe effective convertase activity $E(t)$ is governed by three processes:\n- Production from $C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$ and factor $B_0$. The rate is $+k_{\\mathrm{form}} B_0 C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$.\n- Spontaneous decay back to $C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$. The rate is $-k_{\\mathrm{decay}} E(t)$.\n- Neutralization by the inhibitor $I(t)$ via the reaction $I + E \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{Ibind}}} \\varnothing$. The rate is $-k_{\\mathrm{Ibind}} I(t) E(t)$.\nNote that $E$ acts as a catalyst in the $C_3$ cleavage reaction, so its concentration is not changed by that step.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the fourth ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{form}} B_0 C_{\\text{3b}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{decay}} E(t) - k_{\\mathrm{Ibind}} I(t) E(t) $$\n\n**5. Rate of change of inhibitor, $\\frac{dI}{dt}$**\nThe concentration of the local inhibitor $I(t)$ is determined by four processes:\n- A constant influx (source) term, $s_I$, with units $\\mu\\text{M s}^{-1}$.\n- A first-order loss term, $-k_{\\mathrm{Iout}} I(t)$, representing diffusion away or degradation.\n- Consumption through the inactivation of $C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$. The rate is $-k_{\\mathrm{inact}} I(t) C_{\\text{3b}}(t)$.\n- Consumption through the neutralization of $E(t)$. The rate is $-k_{\\mathrm{Ibind}} I(t) E(t)$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the fifth and final ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = s_I - k_{\\mathrm{Iout}} I(t) - k_{\\mathrm{inact}} I(t) C_{\\text{3b}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{Ibind}} I(t) E(t) $$\n\nThis system of five coupled, first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equations forms the complete dynamical model.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Implementation Strategy\n\nThe derived system of ODEs is likely to be stiff, as reaction rates can span several orders of magnitude, leading to dynamics on widely different time scales. A numerical solver suitable for stiff problems is required, as specified. We will use the `solve_ivp` function from the `scipy.integrate` library with the `Radau` method, which is an implicit Runge-Kutta method well-suited for stiff ODEs.\n\nThe implementation will proceed as follows:\n1.  A function implementing the system of ODEs will be defined. It will take the current time $t$, the state vector $y(t)$, and a dictionary of parameters as input, and return the vector of derivatives $dy/dt$.\n2.  The base set of parameters will be stored in a dictionary.\n3.  Each of the five test cases will be processed in a loop. For each case:\n    a. The specific parameter set is created by updating the base set with any specified overrides.\n    b. The initial state vector $y(0) = [C_3(0), C_{\\text{3b}}(0), iC_{\\text{3b}}(0), E(0), I(0)]$ is constructed from the given initial conditions.\n    c. `solve_ivp` is called to integrate the system over the time interval $[0, 3600]$ s.\n    d. The final values of $C_{\\text{3b}}(3600)$, $iC_{\\text{3b}}(3600)$, and $E(3600)$ are extracted from the solution.\n    e. These values are rounded to three decimal places and stored.\n4.  Finally, the collected results from all test cases are formatted into a single string as a list of lists and printed to standard output.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and numerically solves a minimal dynamical model of complement activation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base parameter values\n    params_base = {\n        'k_cleave': 1e-3,   # uM^-1 s^-1\n        'f_deposit': 0.8,   # unitless\n        'k_form': 3e-3,     # uM^-1 s^-1\n        'k_decay': 5e-4,    # s^-1\n        'k_inact': 2e-3,    # uM^-1 s^-1\n        'k_Ibind': 2e-3,    # uM^-1 s^-1\n        'k_clear': 1e-4,    # s^-1\n        'k_out': 1e-4,      # s^-1\n        'k_Iout': 1e-3,     # s^-1\n        's': 1e-2,          # uM s^-1\n        's_I': 1e-3,        # uM s^-1\n        'B0': 1.0,          # uM\n    }\n\n    # Test suite definition\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (baseline)\n        {\n            'initials': {'C3_0': 6.0, 'I_0': 0.2, 'E_0': 0.0},\n            'params_override': {'B0': 1.0}\n        },\n        # Case 2 (no inhibitor)\n        {\n            'initials': {'C3_0': 6.0, 'I_0': 0.0, 'E_0': 0.0},\n            'params_override': {'B0': 1.0, 's_I': 0.0}\n        },\n        # Case 3 (strong inhibition)\n        {\n            'initials': {'C3_0': 6.0, 'I_0': 1.0, 'E_0': 0.0},\n            'params_override': {'B0': 1.0, 'k_inact': 4e-3, 'k_Ibind': 4e-3, 's_I': 2e-3}\n        },\n        # Case 4 (limited factor B)\n        {\n            'initials': {'C3_0': 6.0, 'I_0': 0.2, 'E_0': 0.0},\n            'params_override': {'B0': 0.05}\n        },\n        # Case 5 (preformed convertase and faster decay)\n        {\n            'initials': {'C3_0': 6.0, 'I_0': 0.2, 'E_0': 0.1},\n            'params_override': {'B0': 1.0, 'k_decay': 5e-3}\n        },\n    ]\n\n    def complement_ode(t, y, params):\n        \"\"\"\n        System of ODEs for the complement activation model.\n        y = [C3, C3b, iC3b, E, I]\n        \"\"\"\n        C3, C3b, iC3b, E, I = y\n\n        # Unpack parameters for clarity\n        s, s_I = params['s'], params['s_I']\n        k_out, k_Iout, k_clear = params['k_out'], params['k_Iout'], params['k_clear']\n        k_cleave, f_deposit = params['k_cleave'], params['f_deposit']\n        k_form, B0 = params['k_form'], params['B0']\n        k_decay = params['k_decay']\n        k_inact = params['k_inact']\n        k_Ibind = params['k_Ibind']\n\n        # Rates of reactions based on Law of Mass Action\n        v_cleave = k_cleave * C3 * E\n        v_form = k_form * B0 * C3b\n        v_decay = k_decay * E\n        v_inact = k_inact * I * C3b\n        v_Ibind = k_Ibind * I * E\n\n        # Differentials for each species\n        dC3_dt = s - v_cleave - k_out * C3\n        dC3b_dt = f_deposit * v_cleave + v_decay - v_form - v_inact\n        diC3b_dt = v_inact - k_clear * iC3b\n        dE_dt = v_form - v_decay - v_Ibind\n        dI_dt = s_I - k_Iout * I - v_inact - v_Ibind\n\n        return [dC3_dt, dC3b_dt, diC3b_dt, dE_dt, dI_dt]\n\n    results = []\n    T_final = 3600.0\n    t_span = [0, T_final]\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Set up parameters for the current case\n        current_params = params_base.copy()\n        current_params.update(case['params_override'])\n\n        # Set up initial conditions for the current case\n        y0 = [\n            case['initials']['C3_0'],  # C3(0)\n            0.0,                      # C3b(0)\n            0.0,                      # iC3b(0)\n            case['initials']['E_0'],   # E(0)\n            case['initials']['I_0']    # I(0)\n        ]\n\n        # Solve the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            complement_ode,\n            t_span,\n            y0,\n            method='Radau',\n            t_eval=[T_final],\n            args=(current_params,)\n        )\n\n        # Extract final state [C3, C3b, iC3b, E, I]\n        final_state = sol.y[:, -1]\n        \n        # Species indices: C3=0, C3b=1, iC3b=2, E=3\n        C3b_T = final_state[1]\n        iC3b_T = final_state[2]\n        E_T = final_state[3]\n\n        # Round and append the required results\n        results.append([round(C3b_T, 3), round(iC3b_T, 3), round(E_T, 3)])\n\n    # Format output according to specification\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2836590"}]}
