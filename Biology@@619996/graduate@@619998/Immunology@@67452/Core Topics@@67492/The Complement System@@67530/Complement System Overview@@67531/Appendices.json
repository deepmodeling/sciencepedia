The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium and probability theory.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a bacterium is considered \"bound\" if at least one of its $N$ mannose ligand sites is occupied by an MBL molecule. It is more direct to first calculate the probability that a bacterium is *not* bound and then subtract this from $1$. A bacterium is not bound if and only if all of its $N$ binding sites are free (unoccupied).\n\nLet $p_{free}$ be the probability that a single, randomly chosen mannose site on the bacterial surface is free at equilibrium. Since the $N$ sites are stipulated to be identical and independent, the probability that all $N$ sites are simultaneously free, which is the probability that the bacterium is unbound ($P_{unbound}$), is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P_{unbound} = (p_{free})^N$$\n\nConsequently, the fraction of bound bacteria, $F_{bound}$, is given by:\n$$F_{bound} = 1 - P_{unbound} = 1 - (p_{free})^N$$\n\nOur next task is to determine $p_{free}$ from the given equilibrium conditions. The binding of a single MBL molecule, $L$, to a single mannose site, $S$, is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$L + S \\rightleftharpoons LS$$\nThe equilibrium association constant, $K_a$, is defined as:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[LS]}{[L][S]}$$\nwhere $[L]$ is the concentration of free MBL, $[S]$ is the concentration of free mannose sites, and $[LS]$ is the concentration of occupied (complexed) sites. The problem states that the bulk concentration $[L]$ is constant.\n\nThe probability that a site is free, $p_{free}$, is the fraction of total sites that are in the free state, $S$.\n$$p_{free} = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + [LS]}$$\nBy rearranging the equilibrium constant definition, we can express $[LS]$ in terms of $[S]$:\n$$[LS] = K_a [L] [S]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_{free}$:\n$$p_{free} = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + K_a [L] [S]} = \\frac{[S]}{[S](1 + K_a [L])}$$\nAssuming $[S]$ is not zero, we can simplify this to:\n$$p_{free} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_a [L]}$$\nThis expression gives the probability of a single site being free as a function of the MBL concentration and the association constant.\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $F_{bound}$:\n$$F_{bound} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_a [L]} \\right)^N$$\nThis is the general expression for the fraction of bound bacteria under the given assumptions.\n\nWe proceed to evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n- The number of sites per bacterium: $N = 1000$.\n- The equilibrium association constant: $K_a = 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}$.\n- The bulk MBL concentration: $[L] = 10 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units.

It is therefore **valid**. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe central defect is a deficiency in Complement Factor I ($CFI$), a serine protease that is the principal negative regulator of the complement cascade. Its primary function, as stated in principle (ii), is the proteolytic inactivation of activated complement components $C3b$ and $C4b$, which requires cofactors like Factor H ($CFH$) for $C3b$ and $C4$-binding protein ($C4BP$) for $C4b$. A $CFI$ activity of $30\\%$ indicates a severe functional impairment.\n\n1.  **Effect on the Alternative Pathway (AP) and $C3$ levels**:\n    According to principle (i), the alternative pathway undergoes continuous, low-level spontaneous activation (\"tickover\"), generating a small amount of $C3b$. In a healthy individual, this $C3b$ is rapidly inactivated by $CFI$ and its cofactors. In this patient, due to deficient $CFI$ activity, the inactivation of $C3b$ is inefficient.\n    The persisting $C3b$ binds to Factor B ($FB$), which is then cleaved by Factor D ($FD$) to form the AP $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$. This enzyme is a powerful protease that cleaves numerous molecules of $C3$ into $C3a$ and $C3b$. This creates a potent amplification loop: more $C3b$ leads to more $C3bBb$ convertase, which in turn generates even more $C3b$.\n    Due to the failure of negative regulation by $CFI$, this amplification loop proceeds unchecked in the plasma. The consequence is a massive, continuous consumption of plasma $C3$. Therefore, the antigenic level of **$C3$ will be low**.\n\n2.  **Effect on the Classical Pathway (CP) and $C4$ levels**:\n    The classical pathway is typically initiated by antigen-antibody complexes, and is not subject to the same spontaneous tickover as the AP. While principle (ii) states that $CFI$ also inactivates $C4b$ (a component of the CP $C3$ convertase, $C4b2a$), the primary dysregulation in $CFI$ deficiency is the runaway AP amplification. There is no chronic stimulus for the classical pathway, so there is no large-scale consumption of its early components like $C1$, $C4$, and $C2$. The plasma pool of $C4$ remains largely unaffected. Therefore, the antigenic level of **$C4$ will be normal**.\n\n3.  **Effect on Functional Hemolytic Assays ($\\mathrm{AH}50$ and $\\mathrm{CH}50$)**:\n    Principle (iii) states that these assays are limited by the component in shortest supply. Both assays measure the ability of the patient's serum to lyse sensitized erythrocytes, which requires the integrity of the entire complement cascade from initiation through the formation of the terminal membrane attack complex ($C5b\\text{-}9$).\n    - **$\\mathrm{AH}50}$ (Alternative Pathway)**: This assay relies on the components of the AP. Due to the chronic, uncontrolled consumption of $C3$ as detailed above, the patient's serum is severely deficient in $C3$. Without sufficient $C3$, the AP cannot proceed on the target cells to form the membrane attack complex. Thus, **$\\mathrm{AH}50}$ will be low**.\n    - **$\\mathrm{CH}50}$ (Classical Pathway)**: This assay relies on the components of the CP and the common terminal pathway. Although the early components of the CP ($C1, C4, C2$) are present at normal levels, the cascade requires $C3$ to proceed. The severe systemic depletion of $C3$ creates a functional block in the cascade. Therefore, lysis is prevented. Thus, **$\\mathrm{CH}50}$ will be low**.\n\n4.  **Effect on the Soluble Terminal Complement Complex ($\\mathrm{sC5b\\text{-}9}$)**:\n    The uncontrolled AP amplification not only depletes $C3$ but also leads to the formation of the AP $C5$ convertase, typically $(C3b)_2Bb$. This enzyme cleaves $C5$ to generate $C5b$, which initiates the assembly of the terminal complement complex ($C5b\\text{-}9$). When this occurs in the fluid phase (plasma) rather than on a cell surface, regulatory proteins like Vitronectin (S-protein) bind to the complex, forming the non-lytic soluble terminal complement complex, $\\mathrm{sC5b\\text{-}9}$.\n    Since there is chronic, ongoing activation of the complement cascade through the AP, there is continuous generation of $C5b$ and subsequent formation of the terminal complex. Therefore, the level of **$\\mathrm{sC5b\\text{-}9}$ will be elevated**.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Profile**:\n- $C3$: Low\n- $C4$: Normal\n- $\\mathrm{AH}50$: Low\n- $\\mathrm{CH}50$: Low\n- $\\mathrm{sC5b\\text{-}9}$: Elevated\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $C3$ low, $C4$ normal, $\\mathrm{AH}50$ low, $\\mathrm{CH}50$ low, $\\mathrm{sC5b\\text{-}9}$ elevated**\nThis profile perfectly matches the derived predictions.
