This thought experiment [@problem_id:2868397] focuses on the pivotal role of the C8 component in this transition. By considering a hypothetical mutation that disrupts membrane insertion, you can deconstruct the sequential logic of pore formation and appreciate the energetic and structural importance of overcoming the membrane's free-energy barrier, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$.", "problem": "A researcher engineers a point mutation in complement component $C8$ that deletes the hydrophobic membrane-inserting helix within the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin-like (MACPF) domain of the $C8\\alpha$ subunit, but preserves the surface recognized by the upstream complex $C5b-7$, so that the mutant $C8$ binds $C5b-7$ with normal affinity. Red blood cells are sensitized with antibody to activate the classical pathway, and equimolar wild-type amounts of all other complement proteins, including $C9$, are present. From first principles about terminal complement assembly, predict the effect of this mutation on membrane lytic activity and justify the mechanism.\n\nBase your reasoning only on the following well-tested facts: (i) complement-mediated lysis by the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) requires formation of a bona fide transmembrane pore, (ii) $C5b-7$ is membrane-associated but by itself does not form transmembrane pores, (iii) the C8 heterotrimer ($C8\\alpha$, $C8\\beta$, $C8\\gamma$) binds $C5b-7$ and initiates membrane penetration, and (iv) $C9$ monomers polymerize on a membrane-inserted $C5b-8$ to complete the pore. In your justification, explain how the mutation would alter the ability of the complex to overcome the membrane insertion free-energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and to nucleate $C9$ polymerization.\n\nWhich statement best describes the expected outcome?\n\nA. Lytic activity is essentially abolished, because loss of the $C8\\alpha$ membrane-inserting helix prevents initial membrane penetration and proper nucleation of $C9$ polymerization, so the complex remains a non-transmembrane pre-pore.\n\nB. Lytic activity is modestly reduced (to roughly $20$–$30\\%$ of normal), because $C8\\beta$ and $C8\\gamma$ can partially compensate for insertion and still recruit enough $C9$ to form functional pores.\n\nC. Lytic activity is near-normal, because $C5b-7$ can directly recruit and polymerize $C9$ without requiring membrane insertion by $C8\\alpha$.\n\nD. Lytic activity is increased, because removal of the $C8\\alpha$ helix eliminates an autoinhibitory element and leads to hyperactive $C9$ polymerization on the membrane surface without the need for insertion.", "solution": "The formation of the lytic Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) is a sequential process.\n$1$. The $C5b-7$ complex forms and, as stated in fact (ii), associates with the target cell membrane. This association is initially superficial and does not constitute a pore.\n$2$. The C8 heterotrimer, composed of $C8\\alpha$, $C8\\beta$, and $C8\\gamma$ subunits, binds to the $C5b-7$ complex. The problem states this binding occurs with normal affinity for the mutant C8.\n$3$. According to fact (iii), the function of C8 is to *initiate membrane penetration*. This is a critical, energy-dependent step. The hydrophobic membrane-inserting helices of the MACPF domains within the $C8\\alpha$ and $C8\\beta$ subunits undergo a conformational change and insert into the lipid bilayer. This process overcomes the substantial free-energy barrier, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, for inserting a hydrophilic protein structure into a hydrophobic environment. This initial insertion creates a small, stable, transmembrane defect.\n$4$. Fact (iv) states that $C9$ monomers polymerize on a *membrane-inserted* $C5b-8$ complex to form the final, larger pore. The proper insertion of C8 is therefore the structural and energetic prerequisite for the nucleation of $C9$ polymerization.\n\nNow, we analyze the consequences of the specified mutation. The mutation deletes the hydrophobic membrane-inserting helix of the $C8\\alpha$ subunit. This is a critical loss-of-function mutation. While the mutant C8 can still bind to $C5b-7$ on the membrane, its ability to perform its primary function—initiating membrane penetration—is severely compromised. The $C8\\alpha$ subunit is a principal contributor to this insertion event. Without its hydrophobic helix, the C8 complex cannot properly insert into the lipid bilayer. The energy barrier $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ for creating a stable transmembrane structure will not be overcome. The resulting $C5b-8$ complex will remain a peripheral membrane protein complex, a \"pre-pore,\" rather than an integral, transmembrane one.\n\nBecause the $C5b-8$ complex is not properly membrane-inserted, it cannot serve as an effective template for $C9$ polymerization, as required by fact (iv). The specific conformation of the inserted C8 subunits is what nucleates the polymerization of $C9$. Without this template, $C9$ monomers cannot be properly recruited, unfolded, and polymerized into the final pore structure.\n\nConclusion: The cascade is arrested at the $C5b-8$ stage. No transmembrane pore is formed. According to fact (i), a bona fide transmembrane pore is required for lysis. Therefore, lytic activity must be essentially abolished.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. Lytic activity is essentially abolished, because loss of the $C8\\alpha$ membrane-inserting helix prevents initial membrane penetration and proper nucleation of $C9$ polymerization, so the complex remains a non-transmembrane pre-pore.\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derived consequences. The deletion of the helix prevents insertion, which in turn prevents $C9$ nucleation. Without a $C9$ pore, there is no lysis. The final state is a non-functional pre-pore complex. This reasoning is sound and directly follows from the provided facts. **Correct**.\n\nB. Lytic activity is modestly reduced (to roughly $20$–$30\\%$ of normal), because $C8\\beta$ and $C8\\gamma$ can partially compensate for insertion and still recruit enough $C9$ to form functional pores.\nThis is incorrect. First, $C8\\gamma$ does not possess a MACPF domain and is not involved in insertion in the same manner as $C8\\alpha$ and $C8\\beta$. Second, while $C8\\beta$ does have an inserting helix, the proper nucleation of $C9$ depends on the correctly formed $C5b-8$ transmembrane structure, to which both $C8\\alpha$ and $C8\\beta$ contribute. The loss of the $C8\\alpha$ helix is a critical defect that would destabilize the entire inserted structure, making it a very poor, if not entirely non-functional, template for $C9$. A mere \"modest reduction\" is highly improbable for such a critical structural defect. The outcome should be catastrophic failure, not partial function. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Lytic activity is near-normal, because $C5b-7$ can directly recruit and polymerize $C9$ without requiring membrane insertion by $C8\\alpha$.\nThis statement contradicts the provided facts. Fact (iii) and (iv) establish a strict sequence: $C5b-7$ binds C8, which then inserts, and only then does the resulting $C5b-8$ complex recruit $C9$. There is no known direct pathway from $C5b-7$ to $C9$ polymerization. The problem even states that the mutant C8 binds to $C5b-7$, meaning the $C5b-8$ complex does form, precluding any hypothetical bypass. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Lytic activity is increased, because removal of the $C8\\alpha$ helix eliminates an autoinhibitory element and leads to hyperactive $C9$ polymerization on the membrane surface without the need for insertion.\nThis is biologically and physically nonsensical. The hydrophobic helix is a functional element required for insertion, not an autoinhibitory one. A gain-of-function (increased activity) from deleting a critical functional domain is illogical. Furthermore, polymerization \"on the membrane surface\" without insertion would not create a transmembrane pore, which fact (i) specifies is necessary for lysis. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2868397"}, {"introduction": "Once formed, the MAC functions as a molecular drill, punching a hole in the target cell membrane that leads to lysis.
