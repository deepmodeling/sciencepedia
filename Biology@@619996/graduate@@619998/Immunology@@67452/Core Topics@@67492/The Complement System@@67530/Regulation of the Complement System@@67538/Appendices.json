The model is an idealization but does not violate fundamental principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the reaction network based on the problem description.

At steady state, the concentrations of the intermediates no longer change with time. We apply the steady-state condition by setting the time derivatives to zero.\nLet $C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}}$ and $C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}}$ denote the steady-state concentrations.\n$$ \\frac{dC_{w}}{dt} = 0 \\implies k_{h} C_{3}^{0} - k_{b} C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dC_{conv}}{dt} = 0 \\implies k_{b} C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}} - k_{H} C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}} = 0 $$\n\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations with two unknowns, $C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}}$ and $C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}}$. We must solve for $C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}}$, which is the quantity $[\\mathrm{C3(H2O)Bb}]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate $\\mathrm{C3(H2O)}$, $C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ k_{b} C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}} = k_{h} C_{3}^{0} $$\n$$ C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{h} C_{3}^{0}}{k_{b}} $$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express the steady-state concentration of the convertase, $C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}}$, in terms of $C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ k_{H} C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}} = k_{b} C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}} $$\n$$ C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{H}} C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $C_{w, \\mathrm{ss}}$ into the equation for $C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{H}} \\left( \\frac{k_{h} C_{3}^{0}}{k_{b}} \\right) $$\n\nThe term $k_{b}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ C_{conv, \\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{h} C_{3}^{0}}{k_{H}} $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the steady-state concentration of the active fluid-phase C3 convertase, $[\\mathrm{C3(H2O)Bb}]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The result is physically sensible. The steady-state flux through this linear pathway is determined by the initial production rate, $k_{h} C_{3}^{0}$. At steady state, the rate of convertase formation must equal this flux. Therefore, $k_H C_{conv, ss} = k_h C_3^0$, which yields our result. The parameter $k_b$ determines the steady-state level of the upstream intermediate $\\mathrm{C3(H2O)}$ but not the steady-state level of the final species in this simple chain.\n\nThe dimensional consistency is checked: $C_{3}^{0}$ has units of molarity (M), $k_{h}$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{H}$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The resulting units are $\\frac{\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{M}}{\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{M}$, which is the correct unit for a concentration.\nThe final expression is $[\\mathrm{C3(H2O)Bb}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{h} C_{3}^{0}}{k_{H}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{h} C_{3}^{0}}{k_{H}}}\n$$", "id": "2886315"}, {"introduction": "While negative regulators limit convertase activity, positive regulators like properdin are crucial for a potent response on activating surfaces.

The system is influenced by the normalized abundances of three regulatory proteins: Factor H ($H$), Decay-Accelerating Factor ($D$), and properdin ($P$).\n\nWe will derive the rate equation $\\frac{dx_i}{dt}$ for each species by summing the rates of all reactions that produce it and subtracting the rates of all reactions that consume it.\n\nThe rate equation for $x_1(t)$ (free $C3b$):\nThe concentration of free C$3$b, $x_1$, decreases through two processes: formation of unstable convertase, $x_1 \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{form}}} x_2$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{form}} x_1$, and irreversible inactivation to iC$3$b, $x_1 \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{inact}} H} x_4$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{inact}} H x_1$.\nIt increases through the dissociation of both unstable and stabilized convertases. The total decay rate of the unstable convertase $x_2$ is the sum of its basal decay ($k_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)}$) and the accelerated decay contributed by DAF ($k_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D$) and Factor H ($k_{H} H$). Thus, $x_2$ decays back to $x_1$ at a rate of $(k_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + k_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + k_{H} H)x_2$. Similarly, the stabilized convertase $x_3$ decays back to $x_1$ at a rate of $(\\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + \\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + \\tilde{k}_{H} H)x_3$.\nCombining these terms yields the first ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = - (k_{\\mathrm{form}} + k_{\\mathrm{inact}} H) x_1 + (k_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + k_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + k_{H} H) x_2 + (\\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + \\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + \\tilde{k}_{H} H) x_3\n$$\n\nThe rate equation for $x_2(t)$ (unstable convertase $C3bBb$):\nThe concentration of unstable convertase, $x_2$, increases from the formation reaction $x_1 \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{form}}} x_2$ at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{form}} x_1$, and from the dissociation of the properdin-stabilized complex, $x_3 \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} x_2$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{off}} x_3$.\nIt is consumed by all its decay pathways, with a total rate of $(k_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + k_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + k_{H} H)x_2$, and by binding properdin to form the stabilized complex, $x_2 \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{on}} P} x_3$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{on}} P x_2$.\nCombining these terms yields the second ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_2}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{form}} x_1 - (k_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + k_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + k_{H} H + k_{\\mathrm{on}} P) x_2 + k_{\\mathrm{off}} x_3\n$$\n\nThe rate equation for $x_3(t)$ (stabilized convertase $C3bBbP$):\nThe concentration of stabilized convertase, $x_3$, is produced solely by the binding of properdin to $x_2$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{on}} P x_2$.\nIt is consumed by dissociation back to $x_2$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{off}} x_3$, and by its own decay pathways. The total decay rate for $x_3$ is $(\\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + \\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + \\tilde{k}_{H} H)x_3$.\nCombining these terms yields the third ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_3}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} P x_2 - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + \\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{decay}}^{(0)} + \\tilde{k}_{\\mathrm{DAF}} D + \\tilde{k}_{H} H) x_3\n$$\n\nThe rate equation for $x_4(t)$ (inactive $C3b$):\nThe concentration of the terminally inactivated product, $x_4$, increases through the Factor H-dependent inactivation of $x_1$, at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{inact}} H x_1$. In this model, it has no consumption pathways.\nThis gives the fourth and final ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_4}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{inact}} H x_1\n$$\n\nThis constitutes a system of $4$ coupled, linear, first-order ODEs with constant coefficients for any given set of parameters $(H, D, P)$. To verify internal consistency, we can check for the conservation of mass. The sum of the derivatives is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4) = \\frac{dx_1}{dt} + \\frac{dx_2}{dt} + \\frac{dx_3}{dt} + \\frac{dx_4}{dt} = 0\n$$\nAll terms cancel out, confirming that the total concentration of all C$3$ derivatives, $X_{\\mathrm{total}} = x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4$, is conserved. Given the initial conditions $x_1(0) = C_0$ and $x_2(0)=x_3(0)=x_4(0)=0$, we have $X_{\\mathrm{total}}(t) = C_0$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nThe problem requires computing two metrics:\n$1$. The final active convertase fraction at time $T=1800\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{final}} = \\frac{x_2(T) + x_3(T)}{C_0}\n$$\n$2$. The time-averaged active convertase fraction over $[0, T]$:\n$$\n\\bar{f} = \\frac{1}{T C_0} \\int_{0}^{T} \\left(x_2(t) + x_3(t)\\right)\\, dt\n$$\n\nTo solve this initial value problem, we employ a numerical ODE solver. The system of equations is integrated from $t=0$ to $t=T$ using the given initial conditions. The solver's dense output feature is used, which provides a continuous interpolation of the solution. This allows for accurate evaluation of $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$ at any time $t \\in [0, T]$, which is essential for precisely calculating the definite integral for $\\bar{f}$ using a numerical quadrature method. The final state at $t=T$ directly yields $f_{\\mathrm{final}}$. This procedure is repeated for each of the $5$ specified parameter sets $(H, D, P)$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp, quad\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ODE model for the alternative complement pathway C3 convertase\n    dynamics and calculates the required output metrics for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define kinetic and system parameters\n    k_form = 1e-3  # s^-1\n    k_decay_0 = 5e-3  # s^-1\n    k_tilde_decay_0 = 5e-4  # s^-1\n    k_DAF = 1e-2  # s^-1\n    k_tilde_DAF = 7e-3  # s^-1\n    k_H = 5e-3  # s^-1\n    k_tilde_H = 3e-3  # s^-1\n    k_on = 2e-3  # s^-1\n    k_off = 1e-3  # s^-1\n    k_inact = 5e-4  # s^-1\n    \n    C0 = 100.0  # nM\n    T_final = 1800.0  # s\n\n    # Initial conditions vector: [x1(0), x2(0), x3(0), x4(0)]\n    y0 = [C0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n    # Test suite of regulator abundances (H, D, P)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),  # Case 1: Typical case\n        (0.0, 0.0, 0.0),  # Case 2: Absent regulators\n        (0.5, 0.2, 5.0),  # Case 3: Strong stabilization\n        (0.5, 5.0, 0.5),  # Case 4: Strong decay acceleration\n        (5.0, 0.5, 0.5),  # Case 5: Strong inactivation\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    def ode_system(t, y, H, D, P):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ordinary differential equations.\n        y: state vector [x1, x2, x3, x4]\n        H, D, P: dimensionless regulator abundances\n        \"\"\"\n        x1, x2, x3, _ = y\n\n        # Combined decay rates for unstable (x2) and stabilized (x3) convertases\n        decay_rate_x2 = k_decay_0 + k_DAF * D + k_H * H\n        decay_rate_x3 = k_tilde_decay_0 + k_tilde_DAF * D + k_tilde_H * H\n\n        # System of ODEs based on mass-action kinetics\n        dx1_dt = -(k_form + k_inact * H) * x1 + decay_rate_x2 * x2 + decay_rate_x3 * x3\n        dx2_dt = k_form * x1 - (decay_rate_x2 + k_on * P) * x2 + k_off * x3\n        dx3_dt = k_on * P * x2 - (k_off + decay_rate_x3) * x3\n        dx4_dt = k_inact * H * x1\n        \n        return [dx1_dt, dx2_dt, dx3_dt, dx4_dt]\n\n    for H_val, D_val, P_val in test_cases:\n        # Numerically integrate the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=ode_system,\n            t_span=[0, T_final],\n            y0=y0,\n            args=(H_val, D_val, P_val),\n            dense_output=True,  # Necessary for accurate integration\n            method='RK45',       # A robust, general-purpose solver\n            rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9 # Standard tolerances for accuracy\n        )\n\n        # --- Calculate final active convertase fraction ---\n        # Get concentrations at the final time T_final\n        x2_T, x3_T = sol.y[1, -1], sol.y[2, -1]\n        \n        # Compute the fraction relative to the initial total concentration C0\n        f_final = (x2_T + x3_T) / C0\n\n        # --- Calculate time-averaged active convertase fraction ---\n        # Define the integrand function: sum of active convertases\n        def active_convertase_concentration(t):\n            # Use the dense output (interpolated solution) for high accuracy\n            y_t = sol.sol(t)\n            return y_t[1] + y_t[2]\n\n        # Use numerical quadrature to find the integral over [0, T_final]\n        integral_val, _ = quad(active_convertase_concentration, 0, T_final)\n        \n        # Normalize by time and initial total concentration\n        f_bar = integral_val / (T_final * C0)\n        \n        # Append formatted results\n        all_results.append(\"{:.6f}\".format(f_final))\n        all_results.append(\"{:.6f}\".format(f_bar))\n\n    # Print results in the specified single-line format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(all_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2886326"}]}
