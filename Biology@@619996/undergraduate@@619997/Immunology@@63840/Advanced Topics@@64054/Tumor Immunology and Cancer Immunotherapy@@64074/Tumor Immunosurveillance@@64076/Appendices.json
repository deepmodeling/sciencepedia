By analyzing a specific failure point caused by a non-functional Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) protein, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate machinery required for cytotoxic T-cells to 'see' and target nascent tumor cells [@problem_id:2282850].", "problem": "A research team is studying a patient with a particularly aggressive form of malignant melanoma. Upon molecular analysis of the tumor cells, they discover a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene that codes for the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) protein. All nucleated somatic cells normally process a sample of their internal proteins, known as endogenous antigens, and display fragments of them on their surface to be surveyed by the immune system. This process is fundamental for the detection and elimination of cancerous or virally infected cells by Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), which recognize these fragments when they are presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, which of the following describes the most direct and significant consequence for the antigen presentation capabilities of these melanoma cells?\n\nA.

To answer this, we must review the canonical MHC class I antigen presentation pathway.\n\n**Step 1: The MHC Class I Pathway for Endogenous Antigens**\nThe MHC class I pathway is responsible for presenting peptides from endogenous proteins, which are proteins synthesized within the cell's own cytoplasm. In a cancer cell, this includes mutated or overexpressed proteins that can act as tumor antigens.\n\n1.  **Protein Degradation**: Endogenous proteins are constantly being turned over. Proteins targeted for degradation are ubiquitinated and then broken down into short peptide fragments by a large, cylindrical protease complex in the cytoplasm called the proteasome.\n2.  **Peptide Transport**: These peptide fragments must be transported from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where new MHC class I molecules are being synthesized.\n3.  **The Role of TAP**: This transport step is actively mediated by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). TAP is a heterodimeric protein (composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits) embedded in the ER membrane, forming a channel that specifically pumps peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER.\n4.  **MHC Class I Loading**: Inside the ER, newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains associate with a smaller protein called beta-2 microglobulin. This complex is held in a receptive state by a group of chaperone proteins, collectively known as the peptide-loading complex, which includes TAP itself. When a peptide of the appropriate length and sequence is transported into the ER by TAP, it binds to the peptide-binding groove of the MHC class I molecule.\n5.  **Surface Expression**: The binding of a peptide stabilizes the MHC class I molecule, which is then released from the peptide-loading complex and transported through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.\n6.  **Immune Surveillance**: On the cell surface, the peptide-MHC class I complex can be recognized by the T-cell receptor of a CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL). If the peptide is recognized as foreign (e.g., from a virus) or abnormal (e.g., from a cancerous mutation), the CTL is activated to kill the presenting cell.\n\n**Step 2: Consequence of the TAP Mutation**\nThe problem states there is a loss-of-function mutation in the TAP protein. This means the peptide pump is non-functional.\n\n-   The proteasome will still function correctly, degrading endogenous proteins into peptides in the cytoplasm (disproving option B).\n-   However, these peptides cannot be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum.\n-   Without a supply of peptides in the ER, the newly synthesized MHC class I molecules cannot bind a peptide.\n-   MHC class I molecules that fail to bind a peptide are inherently unstable. They are retained within the ER and eventually targeted for degradation through a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD).\n-   Therefore, very few, if any, stable MHC class I molecules will ever complete their journey to the cell surface.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n-   **A. An inability to process and load peptides derived from extracellular pathogens onto MHC class II molecules.** This is incorrect. The MHC class II pathway handles *exogenous* antigens (those taken up from outside the cell). This pathway involves endosomes and lysosomes and does not use the TAP protein.\n-   **B. The proteasome in the cytoplasm will be unable to degrade mutated cancer-associated proteins into peptide fragments.** This is incorrect. The proteasome's function is upstream of and independent from TAP's function. The mutation in TAP does not affect protein degradation.\n-   **C. A significant reduction in the quantity of stable, peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules expressed on the cell surface.** This is correct. As explained above, the lack of peptide transport into the ER prevents the stable assembly and subsequent surface expression of MHC class I molecules. This is a classic mechanism of immune evasion by tumors.\n-   **D. A significant increase in the quantity of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, as they are no longer being loaded with peptides.** This is incorrect. Unloaded MHC class I molecules are unstable and are degraded, not transported to the surface. Their surface expression is therefore dramatically reduced, not increased.\n-   **E. The melanoma cells will present intact, whole proteins on their surface via MHC class I molecules instead of short peptides.** This is incorrect. The binding groove of an MHC class I molecule is physically constrained and can only accommodate short peptides (typically 8-10 amino acids), not intact proteins.\n\nTherefore, the direct and most significant consequence of a non-functional TAP protein is the failure to load MHC class I molecules with peptides, leading to their instability and a drastic reduction in their expression on the cell surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282850"}, {"introduction": "Successfully presenting a tumor antigen is not always enough to trigger a productive anti-tumor response; the immunological context of the presentation is equally critical. This exercise explores the 'two-signal model' of T-cell activation, a foundational concept explaining how lymphocytes are directed towards either activation or tolerance. This scenario highlights how tumors can induce a state of functional unresponsiveness, or 'anergy', by ensuring antigen is presented without a crucial co-stimulatory signal, effectively disarming the responding T-cells [@problem_id:2282849].", "problem": "A research team is investigating immune evasion mechanisms in a mouse model of a slow-growing, non-inflammatory carcinoma. They observe that proteins shed by the tumor cells are collected by migratory Dendritic Cells (DCs), which then travel to the local tumor-draining lymph node. Within the lymph node, these DCs process the proteins and present tumor-derived peptides on their cell surface. Further analysis using flow cytometry reveals that these specific DCs express high levels of peptide-loaded Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules, but negligible levels of the co-stimulatory molecule B7 (CD80/CD86).\n\nA naive CD8+ T cell, whose T Cell Receptor (TCR) specifically recognizes one of the tumor peptides being presented, enters the lymph node from the bloodstream and encounters one of these tumor-antigen-presenting DCs.\n\nBased on the principles of T cell activation, what is the most likely immunological outcome for this naive T cell following this interaction?\n\nA. The T cell will undergo rapid clonal expansion and differentiate into a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) capable of killing tumor cells.\n\nB. The T cell will enter a state of functional unresponsiveness, known as anergy, rendering it unable to respond to later encounters with the same antigen.\n\nC. The T cell will differentiate into a memory T cell, which will circulate long-term and mount a strong response upon a secondary tumor exposure.\n\nD. The T cell will be activated to become a T helper cell that produces cytokines to help B cells produce tumor-specific antibodies.\n\nE. The T cell will immediately undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) before it can receive any signals from the DC.", "solution": "Principle of naive T cell activation: a naive T cell requires at least two signals from an antigen-presenting cell. Signal 1 is antigen-specific recognition via TCR binding to peptide presented on the appropriate MHC molecule (for CD8^{+} T cells, peptide-MHC class I). Signal 2 is co-stimulation, classically CD28 on the T cell binding to B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell. A third, cytokine-mediated differentiation signal shapes effector fate but does not substitute for the need for co-stimulation for initial activation. In the absence of co-stimulation, delivery of signal 1 alone to a naive T cell leads to peripheral tolerance, most commonly functional unresponsiveness (anergy) or, less often, deletion.\n\nApplying to the scenario: the dendritic cells have high levels of peptide-loaded MHC class I (providing signal 1) but negligible B7 (CD80/CD86), so they cannot provide signal 2 via CD28. The naive CD8^{+} T cell’s TCR will recognize the tumor-derived peptide-MHC I complex (signal 1), but it will not receive CD28-mediated co-stimulation. In a non-inflammatory, slow-growing tumor context, DCs remain semi-mature and tolerogenic, reinforcing the absence of co-stimulatory signals.\n\nTherefore, instead of undergoing clonal expansion and differentiating into cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the naive CD8^{+} T cell will enter a state of functional unresponsiveness (anergy). This excludes:\n- Rapid clonal expansion and CTL differentiation (requires co-stimulation; option A is incorrect).\n- Memory T cell generation (requires successful activation and expansion; option C is incorrect).\n- Differentiation into a T helper cell (the cell is CD8^{+}, not CD4^{+}; option D is incorrect).\n- Immediate apoptosis before receiving signals (activation-induced cell death generally follows prior activation; signal 1 alone typically induces anergy rather than immediate apoptosis; option E is unlikely).\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2282849"}, {"introduction": "Tumors are under immense selective pressure from the immune system, a process known as immunoediting, which can lead to the survival of cancer cells that become 'invisible' to T-cells.

Neutrophils", "solution": "We identify the immune mechanisms relevant to tumor cell recognition:\n1) Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells) require antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules to engage the T cell receptor and mediate killing. If tumor cells lose MHC class I expression, CD8+ T cells cannot recognize them, so this mechanism is evaded.\n2) Helper T lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells) recognize peptides presented on MHC class II. Typical tumor cells, including melanoma cells, do not express MHC class II constitutively, and CD4+ T cells are not the primary cytotoxic effector against MHC class I-deficient tumor cells.\n3) Natural killer (NK) cells integrate inhibitory and activating signals. Inhibitory receptors (such as KIRs) recognize self MHC class I on target cells and suppress NK cell activation. Loss of MHC class I removes this inhibitory signal (“missing-self” recognition). Concurrently, stress-associated ligands on tumor cells (such as MIC-A/B or ULBPs) engage activating receptors on NK cells (such as NKG2D), providing an activating signal (“induced-self”). The combination of missing inhibitory signaling and present activating signaling primes NK cells to recognize and eliminate MHC class I-deficient tumor cells.\n4) B lymphocytes primarily mediate humoral immunity by producing antibodies; they are not the primary effectors for recognizing and killing MHC class I-deficient tumor cells based on missing-self.\n5) Neutrophils are innate phagocytes important for bacterial defense and inflammatory responses; they are not the primary cells that recognize missing-self and stress ligands to kill such tumor cells.\n\nTherefore, the immune cell type primarily responsible for recognizing and eliminating MHC class I-deficient tumor cells that express stress ligands is Natural Killer cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282831"}]}
