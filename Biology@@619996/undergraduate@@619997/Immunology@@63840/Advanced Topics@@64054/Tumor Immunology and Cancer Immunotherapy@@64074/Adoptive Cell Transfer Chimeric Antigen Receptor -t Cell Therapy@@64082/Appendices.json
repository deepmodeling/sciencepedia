In this model, the proliferation of CAR-T cells is driven exclusively by their interaction with and killing of tumor cells. The key parameter of this model is the 'expansion-to-kill' ratio, $\\rho$, defined as the net number of new CAR-T cells generated for each tumor cell destroyed.

Other factors, such as the natural death of CAR-T cells and the intrinsic growth of the tumor, are considered negligible during the primary, rapid expansion phase of the therapy.\n\nA major complication of this therapy is Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a systemic inflammatory response. The clinical severity of CRS is often correlated with the peak population of CAR-T cells achieved in the patient.
