This first practice explores the distinct roles of two key players in this process: Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) from the adaptive immune system and Natural Killer (NK) cells from the innate system. This exercise [@problem_id:2282575] delves into the critical trade-off a tumor faces when it alters its Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I expression, a common escape tactic. By working through this scenario, you will understand how evading one arm of the immune system can render a tumor cell vulnerable to attack by another.", "problem": "In the field of tumor immunology, a central concept is how cancer cells evolve to evade the immune system. Two primary cytotoxic effector cells involved in anti-tumor immunity are Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells.\n\n- **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs)** are a component of the adaptive immune system. They recognize and kill target cells by using their T-cell receptor to bind to specific foreign or mutated peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules on the surface of the target cell.\n- **Natural Killer (NK) cells** are part of the innate immune system. Their activity is governed by a balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. A crucial inhibitory signal for NK cells is the recognition of self-MHC Class I molecules on a cell's surface. The absence of these molecules, a phenomenon described by the \"missing-self\" hypothesis, removes this inhibition and can lead to NK cell-mediated killing of the target cell.\n\nA research team is studying a human melanoma cell line. They engineer a mutant version of this cell line by deleting the gene for beta-2-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). The $\\beta_2$m protein is a necessary component for the stable assembly and expression of MHC Class I molecules on the cell surface. Consequently, the mutant cell line fails to display MHC Class I molecules.\n\nCompared to the original, unmodified (wild-type) melanoma cells which express normal levels of MHC Class I, how would the susceptibility of this new mutant cell line to killing by CTLs and NK cells be altered?\n\nA. It would become more susceptible to both CTLs and NK cells.\n\nB. It would become less susceptible to both CTLs and NK cells.\n\nC. It would become more susceptible to CTLs but less susceptible to NK cells.\n\nD. It would become less susceptible to CTLs but more susceptible to NK cells.\n\nE. There would be no change in its susceptibility to either cell type.", "solution": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes require recognition of specific peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I on target cells through their T-cell receptors to initiate killing. Deletion of beta-2-microglobulin prevents the proper assembly and surface expression of MHC Class I, thereby eliminating peptide–MHC Class I complexes on the melanoma cell surface. Without MHC Class I, CTLs cannot engage their T-cell receptor with antigen-presenting complexes on these tumor cells, so the mutant cells become less susceptible to CTL-mediated killing.\n\nNatural Killer cells integrate activating and inhibitory signals, with a key inhibitory input being recognition of self–MHC Class I on potential target cells. According to the missing-self hypothesis, loss of MHC Class I removes this inhibitory signal, tipping the balance toward activation and cytotoxicity by NK cells. Therefore, absence of MHC Class I due to beta-2-microglobulin deletion makes the mutant melanoma cells more susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing.\n\nCombining these two effects, the mutant cell line is less susceptible to CTLs but more susceptible to NK cells, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2282575"}, {"introduction": "Tumors often evolve beyond simply hiding from the immune system; they can develop sophisticated strategies to actively suppress anti-tumor responses. A cornerstone of T-cell biology is the \"two-signal model,\" which requires both antigen recognition (Signal 1) and a costimulatory signal (Signal 2) for full activation. This problem [@problem_id:2282564] examines a crucial immune evasion mechanism where tumor cells present antigens but fail to provide the necessary costimulation, leading to T-cell paralysis, or \"anergy.\" This concept is fundamental to understanding why some tumors are non-responsive to immune attack and how modern immunotherapies aim to reverse this state.", "problem": "A research group is investigating a novel mechanism of tumor immune evasion in a murine model of carcinoma. The engineered tumor cells are designed to express a strong, non-self peptide antigen, designated `TAA-1`, which is effectively processed and presented on their surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, genetic modification ensures these tumor cells completely lack the cell-surface expression of B7 family costimulatory molecules (specifically, B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86). When naive CD8+ T cells whose T-Cell Receptors (TCRs) are specific for the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex are co-cultured with these tumor cells, the T cells not only fail to become activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes but are subsequently unable to respond to the same antigen when presented by fully competent professional antigen-presenting cells. This induced state of unresponsiveness is known as anergy.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for the induction of anergy in these CD8+ T cells?\n\nA. The affinity of the T-Cell Receptor for the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex is too low to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade, preventing Signal 1 of T cell activation.\n\nB. The tumor cells actively secrete inhibitory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-$\\beta$), which override the activation signals and induce a quiescent state in the T cells.\n\nC. The interaction between the TCR and the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex delivers the first activation signal, but the absence of B7-mediated co-stimulation through CD28 on the T cell results in an anergic state instead of full activation.\n\nD. The T cells recognize the `TAA-1` peptide but fail to activate because they do not express the necessary co-receptor, CD8, required to stabilize the MHC-I interaction.\n\nE. The tumor cells express PD-L1, which binds to the PD-1 receptor on the T cells, delivering a potent inhibitory signal that actively shuts down the T cell's activation program.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: Naive T cell activation requires two signals. Signal 1 is delivered when the TCR recognizes a specific peptide-MHC complex. Signal 2 is delivered when CD28 on the T cell binds B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell. In the absence of Signal 2, TCR engagement alone induces anergy rather than activation, characterized by failure to produce interleukin-2 and long-lasting unresponsiveness to subsequent antigen exposure. Symbolically,\n$$\n\\text{Activation} \\iff S_{1} \\land S_{2}, \\qquad \\text{Anergy} \\iff S_{1} \\land \\neg S_{2}.\n$$\n\nApplication to the scenario: The engineered tumor cells process and present the non-self antigen `TAA-1` on MHC class I, ensuring that naive CD8^{+} T cells receive Signal 1 via their TCRs recognizing the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex. However, these tumor cells lack B7-1 and B7-2, so they cannot provide co-stimulation through CD28; therefore Signal 2 is absent. Thus, in this system $S_{1}=\\text{true}$ and $S_{2}=\\text{false}$, which by the rule above leads to anergy.\n\nWhy the alternatives are less accurate:\n- Option A is incorrect because Signal 1 is present by design: the antigen is effectively processed and presented, and the T cells are specific for `TAA-1`/MHC-I.\n- Option B introduces inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-$\\beta$, which can suppress T cells, but the most direct and sufficient cause given is the absence of B7-mediated co-stimulation; cytokine secretion is not specified and is not required to explain anergy here.\n- Option D is incorrect because the cells are CD8^{+} T cells, so they do express CD8; lack of CD8 is not the issue.\n- Option E involves PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signaling, which is not described here and is not necessary to explain the observed anergy; the defining experimental manipulation is the absence of B7 ligands.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that TCR engagement (Signal 1) without B7-CD28 co-stimulation (Signal 2) induces anergy, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282564"}, {"introduction": "Immunoediting is a dynamic evolutionary process, where the \"rules\" of selection are dictated by the tumor's local environment.

By calculating a selection coefficient based on the balance of CTL and NK cell activity, you will predict how tumors colonizing the lung versus the liver can be driven to evolve in opposite directions, providing a powerful illustration of immunoediting in action.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of tumor immunoediting, the process by which the immune system shapes the characteristics of a progressing tumor. A tumor population consists of two phenotypes: cells expressing Major Histocompatibility Complex class I ($P^{+}$) and escape-variant cells that have lost MHC-I expression ($P^{-}$).\n\nThe net growth rate, $r$, of a tumor cell subpopulation is given by $r = g - k$, where $g$ is the intrinsic proliferation rate and $k$ is the death rate due to immune predation.\n- For $P^{+}$ cells, the death rate $k_{+}$ is primarily due to Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs). This rate is modeled as $k_{+} = C \\cdot T_{eff}$, where $C$ is the CTL killing efficacy constant and $T_{eff}$ is the effective number of tumor-infiltrating CTLs. There is also a small rate of mutation, $\\mu$, where $P^{+}$ cells convert to $P^{-}$ cells. The net growth rate for $P^{+}$ is thus $r_{+} = g - k_{+} - \\mu$.\n- For $P^{-}$ cells, which are invisible to CTLs, the death rate $k_{-}$ is primarily due to Natural Killer (NK) cells. This rate is modeled as $k_{-} = K \\cdot N_{K,eff}$, where $K$ is the NK killing efficacy constant and $N_{K,eff}$ is the effective number of active NK cells. The net growth rate for $P^{-}$ is $r_{-} = g - k_{-}$.\n\nThe selection coefficient, $S$, for the $P^{-}$ escape variant is defined as the difference in net growth rates, $S = r_{-} - r_{+}$. A positive value of $S$ indicates a fitness advantage for the $P^{-}$ variant, leading to its selection and eventual dominance.
