The pre-transplant crossmatch test for pre-formed antibodies against the donor was negative. The initial post-operative period is unremarkable, and the new kidney functions well. However, seven days post-transplantation, the patient presents with a fever, graft tenderness, and a significant rise in serum creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney dysfunction. A renal biopsy is performed, and the histopathological examination reveals a dense infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly T-cells, within the kidney interstitium and tubules, along with evidence of tubulitis.\n\nBased on the timing of the onset and the specific histopathological findings, which of the following is the most likely immunological diagnosis?\n\nA. Hyperacute rejection\n\nB. Acute cellular rejection\n\nC. Chronic rejection\n\nD. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n\nE. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)", "solution": "We first analyze the timing of the dysfunction. The onset at seven days post-transplantation is consistent with an acute rejection process rather than hyperacute (which occurs within minutes to hours) or chronic (which typically develops over months to years). Therefore, the timing supports an acute rejection category.\n\nNext, we interpret the histopathology. The biopsy shows a dense infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly T-cells, within the interstitium and tubules, with tubulitis. This pattern is characteristic of acute cellular (T-cell mediated) rejection, a type IV hypersensitivity reaction driven by recipient T-cells recognizing donor alloantigens, leading to interstitial inflammation and tubulitis; endothelitis may also be seen.\n\nWe then exclude the alternatives:\n- Hyperacute rejection is mediated by preformed anti-donor antibodies (type II hypersensitivity), producing immediate graft failure with widespread thrombosis, neutrophilic infiltrates, and fibrinoid necrosis. A negative pre-transplant crossmatch and the delayed timing argue strongly against this.\n- Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in the acute setting would show microvascular injury with peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis, C4d deposition, and prominent neutrophils/plasma cells, not a predominantly T-cell interstitial infiltrate with tubulitis.\n- Chronic rejection presents later with progressive interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and vascular intimal thickening, not acute T-cell–rich interstitial infiltrates and tubulitis.\n- Graft-versus-host disease is a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which donor T-cells attack recipient tissues; it is not the typical process in solid organ transplantation such as kidney.\n\nCombining the timing and the specific T-cell–predominant interstitial infiltrate with tubulitis, the most likely diagnosis is acute cellular rejection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2276641"}, {"introduction": "Preventing rejection is as critical as diagnosing it, and modern medicine relies on targeted immunosuppressive drugs. To understand how these drugs work, we must connect their molecular targets to core principles of lymphocyte activation. This exercise explores the mechanism of a widely used antibody therapy, forcing a deep dive into the interleukin-2 signaling pathway that fuels the proliferation of alloreactive T-cells [@problem_id:2276597].", "problem": "A patient undergoing a solid organ transplantation, such as a kidney transplant from an unrelated donor, is at high risk for graft rejection. This rejection is primarily mediated by the recipient's T-lymphocytes that recognize the donor's cells as foreign, a phenomenon known as alloreactivity. To prevent this, the patient is treated with an immunosuppressive drug called basiliximab. Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the alpha chain (also known as CD25) of the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. The high-affinity IL-2 receptor, which is crucial for T-cell function, is composed of three chains: alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD132). The alpha chain (CD25) is not highly expressed on resting T-cells but is rapidly upregulated upon their activation.\n\nGiven the mechanism of action of basiliximab, what is the primary consequence for the alloreactive T-cells that have been activated by the foreign graft tissue?\n\nA. Inhibition of clonal proliferation.\n\nB. Direct and immediate induction of apoptosis in resting T-cells.\n\nC. Blockade of the initial interaction between the T-cell receptor and the foreign Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules.\n\nD. Prevention of T-cell differentiation into memory cells.\n\nE. Upregulation of inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules on the T-cell surface.", "solution": "1. Fundamental immunology of allorejection: Alloreactive T-lymphocytes recognizing donor antigen presented on foreign MHC become activated through TCR engagement plus costimulation. Upon activation, these T-cells rapidly upregulate the alpha chain (CD25) of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor, whose full high-affinity form comprises the alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and common gamma (CD132) chains. Activated T-cells also produce IL-2, which binds in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to the high-affinity IL-2 receptor, triggering JAK/STAT signaling that drives entry into the cell cycle, clonal expansion, and differentiation. Thus, IL-2 signaling is the critical driver of clonal proliferation of activated T-cells.\n\n2. Mechanism of basiliximab: Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD25 (the IL-2R alpha chain). By binding CD25, basiliximab blocks the assembly and/or function of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor on activated T-cells, preventing IL-2 from productively engaging its receptor and transducing proliferative signals. Resting T-cells express little to no CD25, so they are largely spared.\n\n3. Primary consequence for activated alloreactive T-cells: Because IL-2 signaling is required for clonal expansion after activation, blockade of CD25 primarily prevents IL-2–dependent proliferation of these activated T-cells. It does not directly induce apoptosis of resting T-cells, does not interfere with the initial TCR–MHC interaction (signal 1), and does not specifically upregulate inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules. While reduced proliferation can secondarily diminish the pool from which memory cells arise, the principal and most immediate effect is inhibition of clonal proliferation.\n\n4. Option assessment:\n- A. Inhibition of clonal proliferation: Correct, as explained above via IL-2 receptor blockade on activated T-cells.\n- B. Direct and immediate induction of apoptosis in resting T-cells: Incorrect; resting T-cells lack high CD25 expression and basiliximab is not an apoptotic agent for resting T-cells.\n- C. Blockade of the initial interaction between the T-cell receptor and foreign MHC: Incorrect; this interaction involves the TCR and MHC, not IL-2R.\n- D. Prevention of T-cell differentiation into memory cells: Not the primary mechanism; any effect is indirect and secondary to reduced proliferation.\n- E. Upregulation of inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules: Not the mechanism of basiliximab.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is inhibition of clonal proliferation of activated alloreactive T-cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2276597"}, {"introduction": "Transplant medicine is increasingly a data-driven field, moving beyond traditional pathology to high-resolution molecular diagnostics. This advanced practice places you in the role of a computational immunologist facing a common but difficult diagnostic dilemma: is the patient rejecting the graft, or is a concurrent viral infection causing inflammatory 'bystander' effects? By analyzing T-cell receptor sequencing data, you will learn a quantitative approach to dissect the immune response and pinpoint the true culprits of graft injury [@problem_id:2276622].", "problem": "As a computational immunologist at a leading transplant center, you are tasked with interpreting complex genomic data to guide clinical decisions. A patient who received a kidney transplant six months ago now presents with signs of acute graft dysfunction. A key diagnostic challenge is to distinguish between true allorejection, which is mediated by T-cells recognizing foreign Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules on the graft, and a flare-up of a latent viral infection, which can cause 'bystander activation' of T-cells and mimic rejection.\n\nTo investigate the cellular basis of the immune response, high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell Receptor (TCR) beta-chain repertoire was performed on blood samples taken before the transplant (pre) and at the time of graft dysfunction (post). The frequency of each T-cell clonotype, defined by its unique TCR sequence, is determined. The data also includes a cross-reference to a large database of public TCRs known to be specific for common viruses like Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV).\n\nYou are tasked with calculating a metric, the \"Alloreactivity Dominance Score\" (ADS), to quantify the likelihood that the observed T-cell expansion is driven by alloreactivity. The ADS is based on identifying a subset of clonotypes that have significantly expanded post-transplant.\n\nFirst, define the \"expanded repertoire\" as the set of all clonotypes that simultaneously satisfy two conditions:\n1. The post-transplant frequency ($f_{\\text{post}}$) is greater than $1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n2. The fold-change in frequency ($f_{\\text{post}} / f_{\\text{pre}}$) is greater than 100.\n\nNext, the Alloreactivity Dominance Score (ADS) is defined as the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{ADS} = \\frac{\\text{Total frequency of private clonotypes in the expanded repertoire}}{\\text{Total frequency of all clonotypes in the expanded repertoire}}\n$$\nA \"private\" clonotype is one that does *not* have a match in the public virus-specific database.
