This condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\n\nConsider a couple where both individuals are phenotypically healthy but are confirmed to be heterozygous carriers of the recessive allele that causes LAD-I. They are planning to have a family and wish to understand the genetic risks. Assuming that the outcome for each child is an independent event, calculate the probability that if they have four children, at least one of them will be affected by LAD-I.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let 'A' represent the dominant, healthy allele and 'a' represent the recessive allele responsible for Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency, Type I (LAD-I). Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, an individual must have the genotype 'aa' to be affected. Individuals with genotypes 'AA' (homozygous dominant) or 'Aa' (heterozygous) are phenotypically healthy. The problem states that both parents are heterozygous carriers, so their genotype is 'Aa'.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of a single child being affected by LAD-I. We can use a Punnett square for the cross between two heterozygous parents ('Aa' x 'Aa').\n\nThe possible genotypes for their offspring are:\n- AA (homozygous dominant, unaffected): 1 out of 4 possible outcomes, so the probability is $P(\\text{AA}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Aa (heterozygous, unaffected carrier): 2 out of 4 possible outcomes, so the probability is $P(\\text{Aa}) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- aa (homozygous recessive, affected): 1 out of 4 possible outcomes, so the probability is $P(\\text{aa}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that a single child is affected with LAD-I.\n$$p = P(\\text{aa}) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nLet $q$ be the probability that a single child is unaffected (either 'AA' or 'Aa').\n$$q = P(\\text{unaffected}) = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nWe need to find the probability that at least one out of four children is affected. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of affected children. We want to calculate $P(X \\ge 1)$.\n\nCalculating $P(X \\ge 1)$ directly would involve summing the probabilities of having exactly one, two, three, or four affected children: $P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4)$.\n\nA more straightforward approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that *none* of the four children are affected, i.e., $P(X=0)$, and subtract this from 1.\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\n\nThe probability that a single child is unaffected is $q = \\frac{3}{4}$. Since the outcome for each of the four children is an independent event, the probability that all four children are unaffected is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(X=0) = q \\times q \\times q \\times q = q^{4} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{4}$$\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{3^{4}}{4^{4}} = \\frac{81}{256}$$\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one child being affected:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\frac{81}{256}$$\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = \\frac{256}{256} - \\frac{81}{256} = \\frac{256 - 81}{256} = \\frac{175}{256}$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\\frac{175}{256} \\approx 0.68359375$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 0.684.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.684}$$", "id": "2244291"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its genetic origins, the core defect in LAD-I is the functional failure of leukocytes to migrate from the bloodstream to sites of infection.

LAD-I is caused by a defect in CD18, the common beta chain of the $\\beta_2$ integrins, which include LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), and p150,95 (CD11c/CD18).\n\nStep 2: State the relevant immunologic principle.\nLeukocyte recruitment to sites of acute inflammation follows the leukocyte adhesion cascade:\n- Rolling mediated by selectins,\n- Chemokine-induced activation,\n- Firm adhesion via integrins (e.g., LFA-1, Mac-1) binding to ICAM-1,\n- Transmigration (diapedesis) across endothelium.\nIn LAD-I, the absence or dysfunction of CD18 impairs the integrin-dependent firm adhesion and subsequent transmigration of neutrophils from blood vessels into tissues.\n\nStep 3: Connect the pathophysiology to the Rebuck skin window assay at the 4-hour time point.\nThe Rebuck skin window assay collects cells that migrate into a superficial abrasion under a coverslip. In the early phase of acute inflammation (approximately 0 to 6 hours), neutrophils are the predominant leukocytes that migrate into the site in a healthy individual. Therefore:\n- Healthy control at 4 hours: the coverslip should be covered with a high number of neutrophils.\n- LAD-I patient at 4 hours: neutrophils cannot undergo firm adhesion and transmigration, so few to no neutrophils reach the abrasion; the coverslip is largely devoid of cells.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on these principles.\n- Choice A is inconsistent with LAD-I and instead suggests Chediak-Higashi syndrome (giant granules due to LYST defect); moreover, LAD-I specifically prevents neutrophil emigration, leading to paucity of cells at the site.\n- Choice B is incorrect because lymphocytes and plasma cells are characteristic of later, chronic inflammation; at 4 hours, a healthy response is neutrophil predominant, and LAD-I would not show an abundance of lymphocytes and plasma cells at this early time point.\n- Choice C correctly predicts that the LAD-I patient’s coverslip is largely acellular (profound absence of neutrophils), while the control’s coverslip shows abundant neutrophils.\n- Choice D is incorrect because the healthy control should exhibit a robust neutrophilic influx at 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the patient’s coverslip is largely devoid of neutrophils while the control’s coverslip is covered with many neutrophils.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2244266"}, {"introduction": "Different mutations can cause clinically similar syndromes, necessitating precise molecular diagnostics to guide treatment. This practice challenges you to interpret data from an *in vitro* adhesion assay that uses specific chemical activators to dissect the underlying molecular fault. By analyzing how neutrophils respond to chemokine versus manganese ($Mn^{2+}$) stimulation, you can distinguish between LAD-I, where the integrin protein is absent, and LAD-III, where the signaling pathway to activate the integrin is broken [@problem_id:2244270].", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating two patients, P1 and P2, who both present with recurrent, life-threatening bacterial infections and impaired wound healing. These symptoms are characteristic of a group of genetic disorders known as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD). The investigation aims to distinguish between LAD-I, caused by a failure to produce the $\\beta_2$ integrin subunit and thus a lack of key adhesion molecules on the neutrophil surface, and LAD-III, caused by a defect in the intracellular signaling pathway required for activating these integrins.\n\nTo achieve this, an *in vitro* adhesion assay is conducted. Neutrophils are isolated from a healthy control subject and from patients P1 and P2.

The percentage of cells that firmly adhere to the ICAM-1 surface is quantified. This \"Adhesion Efficiency\" is measured under three distinct experimental conditions:\n1.  **Resting:** Cells are incubated in a standard physiological buffer.\n2.  **Chemokine-Stimulated:** Cells are treated with a chemokine, which mimics the physiological signal that triggers \"inside-out\" signaling to activate integrins.\n3.  **Manganese-Treated:** Cells are treated with Manganese(II) chloride ($\\text{MnCl}_2$).
