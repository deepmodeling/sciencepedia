This exercise explores the lymphocyte proliferation assay, a classic technique used to measure T-cell immunocompetence. By applying a mitogen like Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) that specifically stimulates T-cell division, we can directly quantify their proliferative capacity. This hypothetical scenario challenges you to predict the outcome of such an assay for a patient with complete DiGeorge syndrome, thereby forging a direct link between the fundamental cellular defect—the absence of T-cells—and a clear, quantitative laboratory result [@problem_id:2271691].", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the case of an infant presenting with recurrent viral and fungal infections, a congenital heart defect, and hypocalcemic seizures. A diagnosis of complete DiGeorge syndrome is suspected. To assess the patient's cellular immunity, a lymphocyte proliferation assay is performed. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), which are a population of blood cells including lymphocytes and monocytes, are isolated from both the infant patient and a healthy, age-matched control subject.\n\nFor both the patient and the control, the PBMCs are cultured under two conditions:\n1.  In culture medium alone (unstimulated).\n2.  In culture medium containing Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a lectin known to be a potent mitogen.\n\nAfter a 72-hour incubation period, cellular proliferation is quantified by measuring the incorporation of a radioactive nucleotide into newly synthesized DNA. The results are expressed as a Stimulation Index (SI), calculated as the ratio of radioactivity (counts per minute) in the PHA-stimulated culture to the radioactivity in the unstimulated culture.\n\nBased on the immunological defect associated with classic, complete DiGeorge syndrome, which of the following options most accurately predicts the outcome of this assay and provides the correct underlying reason?\n\nA. The patient's SI will be near 1.0, and significantly lower than the control's SI. This is because PHA is a T-cell mitogen, and complete DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by thymic aplasia, leading to a profound deficiency of circulating T-cells.\n\nB. The patient's SI will be significantly higher than the control's SI. This is because the patient's B-cells undergo hyper-proliferation to compensate for the lack of T-cell function, and B-cells are strongly stimulated by PHA.\n\nC. The patient's SI will be comparable to the control's SI. This is because while T-cells are absent, the patient's natural killer (NK) cells and B-cells will proliferate in response to PHA, yielding a normal overall response.\n\nD. The patient's SI will be near 1.0, and significantly lower than the control's SI. This is because the underlying genetic deletion in DiGeorge syndrome also causes an intrinsic defect in the DNA replication machinery of all lymphocytes, preventing any proliferation.\n\nE. The patient's SI will be comparable to the control's SI. This is because PHA acts as a pan-lymphocyte mitogen, stimulating B-cells and T-cells equally, and the patient has a normal number of B-cells.", "solution": "The clinical triad of recurrent viral and fungal infections, congenital heart defects, and hypocalcemic seizures indicates complete DiGeorge syndrome with thymic aplasia and resultant profound T-cell deficiency.\n\nDefine the Stimulation Index as\n$$\nSI=\\frac{\\text{cpm}_{\\text{PHA-stimulated}}}{\\text{cpm}_{\\text{unstimulated}}}.\n$$\nThe mitogen used, PHA, is a T-cell mitogen that induces proliferation by cross-linking T-cell surface receptors (e.g., TCR/CD3).

This practice problem shifts our focus to the molecular genetics underlying DiGeorge syndrome, specifically the 22q11.2 deletion. It introduces the important clinical distinction between a constitutional deletion, present in all cells, and somatic mosaicism, where only a fraction of cells are affected. Based on a hypothetical but realistic data set, you will perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fraction of affected cells, providing hands-on experience in interpreting genomic data from modern diagnostic assays [@problem_id:2271689].", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating a patient with recurrent sinopulmonary infections and a mild T-cell lymphopenia, which are suggestive of a partial DiGeorge syndrome phenotype. The primary hypothesis is a microdeletion in the 22q11.2 chromosomal region. To distinguish between a constitutional deletion (present in all cells) and somatic mosaicism (present in a fraction of cells), a quantitative genomic assay is performed on nucleated cells from a peripheral blood sample.\n\nThe assay measures a Dosage Quotient (DQ), which is the ratio of the copy number of a Target Locus (TL) inside the 22q11.2 region to the copy number of a stable Reference Locus (RL) on another autosome. By definition, a normal diploid cell has a DQ of 1.0, as it possesses two copies of both the TL and the RL. In a cell with a heterozygous constitutional 22q11.2 deletion, there is only one copy of the TL and two copies of the RL, yielding a DQ of 0.5.\n\nFor this patient, the analysis of the bulk blood sample yields a DQ of 0.815. Assuming the sample is a two-component mixture of normal diploid cells and cells heterozygous for the 22q11.2 deletion, calculate the fraction of cells in the sample that carry the deletion. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $f$ denote the fraction of cells carrying the heterozygous 22q11.2 deletion in the bulk sample. Normal diploid cells have two copies of both the target locus (TL) and the reference locus (RL), yielding a per-cell dosage quotient (DQ) of $1$. Cells with the heterozygous deletion have one copy of the TL and two copies of the RL, yielding a per-cell DQ of $0.5$.\n\nIn a mixture of $(1 - f)$ normal cells and $f$ deletion cells, the total TL copy number across $N$ cells is $2(1 - f)N + 1 \\cdot fN = (2 - f)N$, and the total RL copy number is $2N$.

This exercise presents a critical scenario where an infant unable to produce their own T-cells faces a threat from foreign T-cells of maternal origin that crossed the placenta during gestation. To solve this, you must synthesize core immunological principles, including T-cell selection, Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restriction, and alloreactivity. Your task is to predict the most severe clinical consequence, understanding how a state of profound immunodeficiency can paradoxically lead to a life-threatening attack known as Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) [@problem_id:2271700].", "problem": "A neonate is diagnosed with complete DiGeorge syndrome, a condition characterized by the congenital absence of the thymus. Despite the inability to produce its own T-lymphocytes, a laboratory analysis of the infant's blood reveals a small but proliferating population of T-cells. Further genetic analysis confirms that these T-cells are of maternal origin, having engrafted in the infant after crossing the placenta. These maternal T-cells are mature and were selected in the mother's thymus based on her own unique set of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules.\n\nConsidering the immunological state of the infant and the origin of the circulating T-cells, which of the following represents the most immediate and severe immunological complication for this infant?\n\nA.

The infant will develop a severe autoimmune disorder because the maternal T-cells were not properly educated to tolerate the infant's self-antigens.\n\nE. The maternal T-cells will stimulate the infant's B-cells non-specifically, leading to hypergammaglobulinemia (excessive antibody production).", "solution": "The infant has complete DiGeorge syndrome, implying congenital absence of the thymus and thus an inability to generate its own T-lymphocytes or to educate T-cells on the infant’s own Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The detected circulating T-cells are maternal, which crossed the placenta and engrafted. These maternal T-cells are mature and have undergone positive and negative selection in the maternal thymus, meaning they are restricted to recognizing antigen in the context of maternal MHC and are tolerant to maternal self-antigens, not the infant’s.\n\nKey immunologic principles:\n- T-cell antigen recognition is MHC-restricted; T-cells selected on maternal MHC are not selected to recognize peptides on the infant’s MHC as self.\n- Alloreactivity: Mature T-cells often respond strongly to non-self MHC molecules, even without conventional antigen specificity, because differences in MHC molecules themselves are highly immunogenic. Thus, maternal T-cells can recognize the infant’s MHC and peptides as foreign.\n- In hosts with profound T-cell deficiency (as in thymic aplasia), donor T-cells can engraft unopposed and attack host tissues, producing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), characterized by rash, diarrhea, liver dysfunction, and marrow suppression. This is the most immediate and severe risk, as it arises directly from donor T-cells attacking host tissues.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect: Maternal T-cells are not matched to the infant’s MHC and will not provide robust, coordinated, long-term protective immunity; rather, they tend to be alloreactive and pathogenic in this context.\n- B is correct: Maternal T-cells will recognize the infant’s cells as foreign due to MHC mismatch and will mediate GvHD; this is the most immediate and severe complication.\n- C is less likely and not the most immediate issue: While survival signals can be influenced by MHC interactions and cytokines, mature donor T-cells can persist and expand in the lymphopenic environment; apoptosis is not the primary concern compared to alloreactivity and GvHD.\n- D mislabels the mechanism: The pathology is not classical autoimmunity (loss of self-tolerance by self-derived lymphocytes) but alloreactive donor T-cell responses against host tissues, i.e., GvHD.\n- E is incorrect: Maternal T-cells are unlikely to provide effective cognate help to infant B-cells due to MHC mismatch; hypergammaglobulinemia is not expected. Instead, immune deficiency and GvHD are concerns.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and severe complication is GvHD mediated by maternal T-cells recognizing the infant’s tissues as foreign.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2271700"}]}
