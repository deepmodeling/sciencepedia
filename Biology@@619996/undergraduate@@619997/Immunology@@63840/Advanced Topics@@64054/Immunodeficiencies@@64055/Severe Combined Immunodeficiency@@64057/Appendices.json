This first practice places you in the role of a diagnostician, tasked with analyzing a classic presentation of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). By examining a patient's lymphocyte profile from flow cytometry data, you will apply your knowledge of lymphocyte development to deduce the specific molecular pathway that has been disrupted [@problem_id:2267987].", "problem": "An infant presents with recurrent, severe opportunistic infections, including oral thrush and pneumonia. A blood analysis is ordered to investigate a potential primary immunodeficiency. Flow cytometry analysis of the infant's peripheral blood lymphocytes reveals the following profile:\n-   The population of cells expressing T-cell Receptors (TCRs) and the CD3 surface marker is almost entirely absent.\n-   The population of cells expressing B-cell Receptors (BCRs) and the CD19 surface marker is also almost entirely absent.\n-   The population of Natural Killer (NK) cells, identified by the CD56 marker in the absence of CD3, is present in normal numbers and demonstrates normal cytotoxic function in vitro.\n\nThis specific pattern of absent T and B lymphocytes, but present and functional NK cells, is characteristic of a failure in a fundamental developmental process shared by T and B cells. Given this information, which of the following is the most likely underlying genetic defect causing this form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)?\n\nA. A loss-of-function mutation in the genes encoding Recombination-Activating Gene 1 or 2 (RAG1/RAG2).\n\nB. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the common gamma chain ($\\gamma_c$), a shared component of several cytokine receptors.\n\nC. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene for Adenosine Deaminase (ADA), an enzyme involved in purine metabolism.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene for Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a signaling molecule critical for B-cell development.\n\nE. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene for ZAP-70, a protein kinase essential for T-cell signaling.", "solution": "We are given an infant with recurrent opportunistic infections and a flow cytometry profile showing absence of T cells (CD3 with TCR) and B cells (CD19 with BCR), but normal numbers and function of NK cells (CD56, CD3 negative). This immunophenotype is summarized as $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$.\n\nThe key inference is that a fundamental developmental process shared by T and B cells is defective, while NK cell development is spared. The shared process is V(D)J recombination, which is essential for generating functional antigen receptors on both T cells (TCR) and B cells (BCR). Failure of V(D)J recombination prevents expression of a functional TCR or BCR, leading to developmental arrest and absence of mature T and B lymphocytes. NK cells do not require V(D)J recombination and thus are unaffected.\n\nThe enzymes that initiate V(D)J recombination are encoded by the RAG1 and RAG2 genes. Loss-of-function mutations in RAG1 or RAG2 block recombination, producing the $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$ SCID phenotype. Therefore, option A matches the described profile.\n\nTo exclude other options:\n- Option B (loss of $\\gamma_c$, the common gamma chain) disrupts cytokine signaling via receptors such as IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. IL-7 is critical for T-cell development and IL-15 for NK-cell development. The classic phenotype is $T^{-}B^{+}NK^{-}$, which does not match.\n- Option C (ADA deficiency) causes toxic purine metabolite accumulation affecting all lymphocytes, typically yielding $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{-}$, which does not match.\n- Option D (BTK deficiency) impairs B-cell development leading to X-linked agammaglobulinemia, with $B^{-}T^{+}NK^{+}$, which does not match.\n- Option E (ZAP-70 deficiency) impairs T-cell receptor signaling, classically causing absent CD8 T cells with dysfunctional CD4 T cells, while B cells are present; NK cells are present. This does not produce a $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$ profile.\n\nTherefore, the most likely underlying genetic defect is a loss-of-function mutation in RAG1 or RAG2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2267987"}, {"introduction": "Understanding human immunodeficiencies has been profoundly advanced by studying animal models where specific genes can be precisely targeted. This exercise asks you to predict the immunological consequence of knocking out the *Jak3* gene, a critical component of the common gamma chain ($\\gamma_c$) cytokine receptor pathway. This scenario will test your understanding of how cytokine signals govern the development of distinct lymphocyte lineages and leads to a different classic SCID phenotype [@problem_id:2267981].", "problem": "To investigate the roles of specific signaling pathways in lymphocyte development, a team of immunologists has generated a knockout mouse model that lacks a functional *Jak3* gene. Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a tyrosine kinase known to associate with the intracellular domain of certain cytokine receptor chains. The researchers plan to characterize the lymphocyte populations in the spleen of homozygous knockout (*Jak3*⁻/⁻) mice and compare them to their wild-type (WT) littermates.\n\nSplenocytes will be isolated from both *Jak3*⁻/⁻ and WT mice, and the relative proportions of major lymphocyte subsets will be determined using flow cytometry. The following cell surface markers will be used for identification:\n- T-cells will be identified by the presence of the marker CD3.\n- B-cells will be identified by the presence of the marker B220.\n- Natural Killer (NK) cells will be identified by the presence of the marker NK1.1.\n\nWhich of the following options best predicts the flow cytometry profile of lymphocyte populations in the spleen of a *Jak3*⁻/⁻ mouse when compared to a WT control?\n\nA.

A severely reduced proportion of CD3-positive cells, a normal proportion of B220-positive cells, and a severely reduced proportion of NK1.1-positive cells.\n\nE. Approximately normal proportions of CD3-positive, B220-positive, and NK1.1-positive cells.", "solution": "Jak3 is a tyrosine kinase that constitutively associates with the common gamma chain (also called CD132) shared by receptors for cytokines in the interleukin-2 receptor family, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. Signal transduction through these receptors requires Jak3; therefore, a Jak3 knockout abrogates signaling by all common gamma chain cytokines.\n\nThe developmental roles of these cytokines specify which lymphocyte lineages are affected:\n- IL-7 signaling is essential for T-cell development in the thymus; loss of Jak3 therefore causes a severe reduction of CD3-positive T cells.\n- IL-15 signaling is essential for NK cell development and survival; loss of Jak3 therefore causes a severe reduction of NK1.1-positive NK cells.\n- B-cell development and peripheral maintenance are comparatively less dependent on common gamma chain cytokines for their presence as a lineage in the spleen. Although early murine B lymphopoiesis can use IL-7 signals, the key point in this question is that the readout is the relative proportion among splenic lymphocytes. With T cells and NK cells severely reduced, the relative fraction of B220-positive cells among total lymphocytes will be approximately normal (and can even appear increased), even if absolute B-cell numbers might be variably affected.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because T cells would not be normal; they are severely reduced due to loss of IL-7 signaling.\n- B is incorrect because B cells are not expected to be severely reduced in relative proportion in the spleen, whereas T and NK cells are severely reduced.\n- C is incorrect because NK cells are not normal; they are severely reduced due to loss of IL-15 signaling.\n- D is correct: severely reduced CD3-positive cells (T), normal proportion of B220-positive cells (B), and severely reduced NK1.1-positive cells (NK).\n- E is incorrect because profound changes occur in T and NK compartments.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is a severe reduction in T and NK cells with an approximately normal proportion of B cells among splenic lymphocytes, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2267981"}, {"introduction": "The label \"immunodeficiency\" is ultimately about a failure of function, not just the absence of cells. This final practice moves beyond simple lymphocyte counts to explore the critical concept of cellular cooperation within the adaptive immune system. You will analyze a scenario that directly probes why the absence of T-cells cripples the antibody response, even when B-cells are present, highlighting the indispensable role of T-cell help in generating humoral immunity [@problem_id:2268017].", "problem": "An infant is diagnosed with a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by a near-complete absence of circulating T-lymphocytes but a normal number of circulating B-lymphocytes (a $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID phenotype). To evaluate the functional capacity of the immune system, the infant is given a standard pediatric vaccine containing a purified protein antigen, which is known to elicit a T-cell dependent antibody response. Weeks later, blood analysis reveals that the infant has failed to produce any detectable levels of antigen-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.\n\nGiven this clinical scenario, which of the following statements provides the most accurate mechanistic explanation for the failure of antibody production, despite the normal B-lymphocyte count?\n\nA. The patient's B-cells possess an intrinsic genetic defect that prevents their B-cell receptors from binding to the protein antigen.\n\nB. The patient's antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, are unable to process the protein antigen and present it on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules.\n\nC. The patient's B-cells, after binding the antigen, do not receive the essential co-stimulatory and cytokine signals from helper T-cells that are required for their full activation, proliferation, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.\n\nD. A deficiency in the patient's complement system prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex, which is a necessary step for B-cell activation by protein antigens.\n\nE. The enzyme activation-induced deaminase (AID), which is responsible for immunoglobulin class switching, is non-functional in the patient's B-cells.", "solution": "1. Identify the immune defect: The infant has a $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID phenotype, meaning there is a profound deficiency of circulating T-lymphocytes with a normal number of circulating B-lymphocytes. This specifically predicts a failure of T-cell dependent immune functions, while T-independent pathways might be variably affected but are not central to protein antigen responses.\n\n2. Nature of the antigenic stimulus: The vaccine contains a purified protein antigen known to elicit a T-cell dependent antibody response. Protein antigens require presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) on MHC class II to CD4^{+} T helper cells, which then provide help to B cells through co-stimulatory interactions and cytokines.\n\n3. Mechanistic requirements for T-dependent B-cell responses:\n   - APCs process extracellular protein antigens and present peptide fragments on MHC class II to CD4^{+} T cells.\n   - Activated CD4^{+} T cells provide essential help to B cells through CD40L (on T cells) binding to CD40 (on B cells) and through cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-21.\n   - These signals are required for full B-cell activation, proliferation, germinal center formation, somatic hypermutation, and class-switch recombination to produce high-affinity IgG-secreting plasma cells.\n\n4. Consequence of absent T cells: In $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID, even though B cells are present and can bind antigen via their B-cell receptors, they cannot receive the required CD40L-mediated co-stimulation and cytokine signals from helper T cells. Therefore, they fail to undergo full activation and class switching, leading to failure to generate antigen-specific IgG following a protein (T-dependent) vaccine.\n\n5. Evaluation of alternatives:\n   - A is unlikely: An intrinsic BCR binding defect across the B-cell repertoire would not specifically align with $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID and would instead resemble conditions like X-linked agammaglobulinemia with very low B cells, not a normal B-cell count.\n   - B is incorrect: APCs in $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID are generally intact in antigen processing and MHC class II presentation; the limiting step is the absence of T cells to recognize presented antigen and provide help.\n   - C is correct: Without helper T-cell co-stimulation (CD40L-CD40) and cytokines, B cells cannot complete activation or class-switch to IgG, explaining the absent antigen-specific IgG despite normal B-cell numbers.\n   - D is incorrect: The complement membrane attack complex is not required for B-cell activation to protein antigens; while complement fragments like C3d can enhance B-cell activation via CR2, the MAC is irrelevant to this process.\n   - E is inconsistent with the scenario: AID deficiency causes a failure of class switching (hyper-IgM phenotype) with preserved antigen-specific IgM; it does not require T-cell absence and does not explain a $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID phenotype. Moreover, the key mechanistic deficit here is the absence of T-cell help, not an intrinsic B-cell CSR enzyme defect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate mechanistic explanation for the failure to produce antigen-specific IgG after a protein vaccine in a $T^{-}B^{+}$ SCID patient is the lack of essential helper T-cell co-stimulation and cytokines for B-cell activation and class switching.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2268017"}]}
