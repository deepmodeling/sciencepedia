This exercise challenges you to act as a diagnostician, interpreting classic laboratory results to navigate the complexities of the complement system.

An immunologist orders a panel to screen for complement system deficiencies. The results from two key functional assays are as follows:\n\n1.  **CH50 Assay:** This test, formally known as the Total Hemolytic Complement assay, measures the functional capacity of the classical complement pathway to lyse antibody-coated sheep red blood cells. The patient's CH50 value is zero.\n2.  **APH50 Assay:** This test, the Alternative Pathway Hemolytic assay, measures the functional capacity of the alternative complement pathway to lyse uncoated rabbit red blood cells.

Functionally, this requires early classical components and the terminal cascade:\n- Classical pathway sequence: antigen-bound IgG/IgM activates C1 (C1q, C1r, C1s), which cleaves C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase $C4b2a$, then C3 is cleaved to C3b, forming the C5 convertase and initiating MAC formation $C5b$–$C9$.\nThus, CH50 depends on $\\{C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, C2, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9\\}$.\n\nThe APH50 assay measures the integrity of the alternative pathway, which proceeds independently of C1, C2, and C4:\n- Alternative pathway sequence: spontaneous C3 hydrolysis yields C3b, which binds factor B; factor D cleaves factor B to form the C3 convertase $C3bBb$, stabilized by properdin (P). This then activates C5 and drives MAC formation $C5b$–$C9$.\nThus, APH50 depends on $\\{\\text{factor B}, \\text{factor D}, \\text{properdin}, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9\\}$.\n\nGiven APH50 is normal, all proteins required for the alternative pathway are functionally intact, including the shared components $C3$ and $C5$–$C9$. Therefore, deficiencies in shared or alternative-specific proteins are excluded:\n- Excluded by normal APH50: $C3$ (choice B), $C9$ (choice D), properdin (choice A), and factor D (choice E).\n\nGiven CH50 is zero, there is a complete loss of classical pathway function, which must be due to a deficiency in a classical-specific component, since shared components are intact by the APH50 result. The classical-specific candidates are $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, or $C2$. Among the provided options, only $C4$ (choice C) is such a component.\n\nThe clinical history further supports an early classical pathway deficiency: deficiencies of $C1q$, $C2$, or $C4$ are classically associated with a lupus-like disease and increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections due to impaired clearance of immune complexes and opsonization.\n\nTherefore, the most likely single complement protein deficiency is $C4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2224467"}, {"introduction": "A functional immune system requires not just powerful activation mechanisms but also robust negative regulation to prevent self-damage. This problem explores what happens when these regulatory \"brakes\" fail, leading to uncontrolled complement consumption. By examining a case of profoundly low $C3$ levels despite a normal $C3$ gene, you will deduce the role of key regulatory proteins like Factor I and appreciate why maintaining homeostasis is critical for immunological health [@problem_id:2224449].", "problem": "A two-year-old child is brought to a clinic with a history of recurrent, severe pyogenic (pus-forming) bacterial infections since infancy. A comprehensive immunological workup is performed. The results show a profoundly low level of serum Complement component 3 (C3), measuring less than 10% of the normal concentration. This finding suggests a high rate of C3 consumption. To investigate the root cause, genetic sequencing of the gene encoding C3 is performed, which reveals a completely normal, wild-type sequence, ruling out a primary defect in C3 production.\n\nThe central amplification loop of the complement system involves the C3 convertase, an enzyme complex that cleaves C3 into its active fragments. The activity of this convertase is normally under tight negative regulation to prevent systemic C3 depletion and host tissue damage. Given the patient's clinical and laboratory findings, a defect in a regulatory protein is suspected.\n\nBased on this information, a functional deficiency in which of the following proteins is the most probable cause of the patient's condition?\n\nA. Properdin (Factor P)\nB. Complement component C5\nC. Factor I\nD. Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL)", "solution": "1. The child has recurrent severe pyogenic infections and profoundly low serum $C3$ with a normal $C3$ gene, which indicates excessive consumption rather than impaired synthesis of $C3$.\n\n2. The central amplification loop of the alternative pathway is driven by the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$, which cleaves $C3$:\n$$\nC3 \\xrightarrow{C3\\ \\text{convertase}} C3a + C3b\n$$\nFormation and amplification proceed via:\n$$\nC3b + B \\xrightarrow{D} C3bBb \\quad (\\text{alternative pathway } C3 \\text{ convertase})\n$$\n\n3. Negative regulation that prevents runaway $C3$ consumption is primarily mediated by Factor I (a serine protease) acting with cofactors such as Factor H, MCP (CD46), and CR1, which inactivate $C3b$:\n$$\nC3b \\xrightarrow{\\text{Factor I with Factor H/MCP/CR1}} iC3b\n$$\nBy cleaving $C3b$ to $iC3b$, Factor I terminates the amplification loop and protects against systemic $C3$ depletion.\n\n4. In Factor I deficiency, $C3b$ cannot be inactivated, leading to persistent formation and stabilization of $C3bBb$ and continuous cleavage of $C3$, thus markedly reducing serum $C3$ concentrations. Clinically, this causes recurrent pyogenic infections due to impaired opsonization.\n\n5. Evaluation of the options:\n- A. Properdin stabilizes $C3bBb$; deficiency would reduce alternative pathway activity and would not cause high $C3$ consumption. It classically predisposes to Neisseria infections with typically normal $C3$ levels.\n- B. C5 deficiency affects the terminal pathway and predisposes to Neisseria but does not cause systemic $C3$ consumption; $C3$ levels are usually normal.\n- C. Factor I deficiency removes the key negative regulator that inactivates $C3b$, causing uncontrolled $C3$ convertase activity and profound $C3$ depletion—matching the findings.\n- D. MBL deficiency impairs lectin pathway initiation but does not drive unchecked $C3$ consumption; $C3$ levels are generally near normal.\n\n6. Therefore, the most probable cause is a functional deficiency of Factor I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2224449"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond identifying a defective pathway, this practice delves into the molecular mechanics of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) itself. Not all components of a biological machine are created equal; their specific function in the assembly line dictates the consequence of their absence. By comparing the clinical outcomes of a $C7$ versus a $C9$ deficiency, you will develop a deeper appreciation for structure-function relationships and how they translate from the molecular level to the patient's bedside [@problem_id:2224411].", "problem": "The complement system is a critical part of the innate immune response that helps clear pathogens. Its terminal pathway culminates in the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), a protein structure that creates a pore in the membrane of a target pathogen, leading to its lysis. The MAC is assembled sequentially from several complement proteins, including C7 and C9.\n\nConsider two individuals with rare genetic disorders. Patient 1 has a homozygous deficiency of the C7 protein. Patient 2 has a homozygous deficiency of the C9 protein. Although both proteins are components of the MAC, the clinical outcomes for these two deficiencies are not identical.\n\nBased on your understanding of the MAC assembly process, which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the likely clinical consequences for these two patients?\n\nA. A homozygous C7 deficiency is likely to have more severe clinical consequences than a homozygous C9 deficiency because C7 is required for anchoring the entire complex to the target membrane.\nB. A homozygous C9 deficiency is likely to have more severe clinical consequences than a homozygous C7 deficiency because C9's polymerization is the final and most critical step in forming the lytic pore.\nC. Both deficiencies are expected to have equally severe clinical consequences as both proteins are essential components of the Membrane Attack Complex, and its absence in either case prevents effective pathogen lysis.\nD. A homozygous C7 deficiency is typically asymptomatic, whereas a homozygous C9 deficiency leads to severe, recurrent infections because the C5b-8 complex is cytotoxic on its own.\nE. Both deficiencies are clinically silent and do not lead to an increased susceptibility to infection, as other immune mechanisms can fully compensate for the lack of a functional MAC.", "solution": "The terminal complement pathway proceeds in a defined sequence. First, C5 convertase cleaves C5 to generate C5b, which immediately binds C6 to form the C5b6 complex. Next, C7 binds to form C5b-7; binding of C7 induces exposure of hydrophobic domains that insert into the target membrane, anchoring the assembling complex to the lipid bilayer. C8 then binds to produce C5b-8, which penetrates the membrane and is itself partially cytotoxic. Finally, multiple copies of C9 polymerize on C5b-8 to form the completed Membrane Attack Complex pore, greatly increasing membrane permeability and causing efficient lysis.\n\nFrom these mechanistic steps, the functional roles of C7 and C9 differ in a way that predicts different clinical severities when each is absent. C7 is required for membrane insertion of the complex; without C7, C5b-6 remains soluble and cannot anchor to the target membrane, preventing effective formation of the lytic complex at the pathogen surface. In contrast, without C9, the C5b-8 complex still forms and inserts into membranes, retaining partial cytotoxicity and contributing to bacterial killing, although full pore formation and maximal lysis are impaired.\n\nClinically, deficiencies in components C5 through C8 are associated with a marked increase in susceptibility to infections with Neisseria species, owing to the critical need for MAC-mediated killing. C9 deficiency tends to be the least severe of the terminal pathway deficiencies because C5b-8 retains bactericidal activity; many individuals with C9 deficiency have milder or fewer infections compared with those lacking earlier terminal components such as C7.\n\nTherefore, a homozygous C7 deficiency is expected to have more severe clinical consequences than a homozygous C9 deficiency, and the rationale is that C7 is necessary for anchoring and membrane insertion, whereas loss of C9 still allows formation of the partially cytotoxic C5b-8 complex. This corresponds to option A and contradicts options B, C, D, and E for the reasons that: B overstates the indispensability of C9 relative to C7; C ignores the residual activity of C5b-8; D inverts the known severity pattern; and E denies the well-established increased susceptibility to Neisseria in terminal complement deficiencies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2224411"}]}
