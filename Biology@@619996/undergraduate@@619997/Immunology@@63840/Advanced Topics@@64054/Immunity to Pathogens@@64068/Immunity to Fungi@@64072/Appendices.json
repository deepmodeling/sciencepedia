In humans, the majority of iron in the blood is tightly bound to the protein transferrin. The Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC) of serum is a measure of the blood's capacity to bind iron with transferrin. When serum iron levels exceed the TIBC, the excess circulates as Non-Transferrin-Bound Iron (NTBI), a form of iron that is readily available to many pathogens, dramatically increasing infection risk.\n\nConsider a patient with a genetic blood disorder who requires frequent transfusions, leading to a state of systemic iron overload. The patient's baseline TIBC is measured to be $C_{\\text{TIBC}} = 315 \\text{ µg/dL}$. During a period of severe overload, their total serum iron concentration, $C_{\\text{serum}}$, is found to be 75.0% higher than their TIBC. This condition makes them highly susceptible to invasive mucormycosis, a life-threatening fungal infection caused by organisms like *Rhizopus oryzae* that thrive in iron-rich environments.\n\nAssuming that the concentration of pathogenic-available iron is equivalent to the concentration of NTBI, calculate the concentration of this NTBI in the patient's serum.
