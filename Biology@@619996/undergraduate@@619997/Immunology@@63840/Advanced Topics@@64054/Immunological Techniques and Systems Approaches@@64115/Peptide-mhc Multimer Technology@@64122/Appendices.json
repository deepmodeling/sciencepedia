To identify and quantify the vaccine-specific cytotoxic T cells, a blood sample is taken, and the white blood cells are isolated. The cells are then stained with two fluorescent reagents for analysis by flow cytometry:\n1. A fluorescently-labeled antibody that binds to the CD8 co-receptor protein, which is a characteristic marker of cytotoxic T cells.\n2. A specially engineered reagent called a peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (pMHC-I) tetramer. This tetramer is loaded with a specific peptide derived from the virus used in the vaccine and is also fluorescently labeled (with a different color). This reagent will only bind to T cells whose T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize the specific viral peptide presented by the MHC-I molecule.\n\nThe stained cells are analyzed, and the data is presented on a two-dimensional dot plot. The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the fluorescence intensity for the CD8 marker, and the vertical axis (y-axis) represents the fluorescence intensity for the pMHC-I tetramer. The plot is divided into four quadrants based on a threshold for fluorescence:\n- Lower-Left (Q3): Negative for CD8, Negative for pMHC-I tetramer.\n- Lower-Right (Q4): Positive for CD8, Negative for pMHC-I tetramer.\n- Upper-Left (Q2): Negative for CD8, Positive for pMHC-I tetramer.\n- Upper-Right (Q1): Positive for CD8, Positive for pMHC-I tetramer.\n\nWhich quadrant would contain the population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that are specific to the viral peptide from the vaccine?\n\nA.

The pMHC-I tetramer binds only T cells whose TCR recognizes the specific viral peptide; therefore, vaccine-specific cells must also satisfy $y > y_{0}$ (tetramer positive).\n\nCombining these two necessary conditions yields $x > x_{0}$ and $y > y_{0}$, which corresponds to the Upper-Right quadrant (Q1).
