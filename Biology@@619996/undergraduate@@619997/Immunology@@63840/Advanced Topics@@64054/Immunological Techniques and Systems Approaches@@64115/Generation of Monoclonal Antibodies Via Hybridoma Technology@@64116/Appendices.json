This first practice problem examines the core of this strategy—the Hypoxanthine-Aminopterin-Thymidine (HAT) selection medium. By considering a hypothetical but critical experimental error, you will explore why the myeloma fusion partner must be deficient in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) to successfully isolate the desired hybrid cells [@problem_id:2230964].", "problem": "In an immunology laboratory, a researcher aims to generate monoclonal antibodies against a specific protein from a newly discovered virus. The standard procedure for creating hybridoma cells is initiated. This involves immunizing a mouse with the viral protein and then harvesting its spleen cells, which include antibody-producing B-cells. These spleen cells are then fused with a special line of myeloma (cancerous plasma) cells. The resulting mixture of cells is cultured in a selective medium known as Hypoxanthine-Aminopterin-Thymidine (HAT) medium. The myeloma cell line used for this procedure is supposed to be deficient in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT-), which is crucial for the cell's survival in HAT medium. The spleen cells, by contrast, are HGPRT-positive (HGPRT+) but have a finite lifespan.\n\nAfter setting up the culture, the researcher discovers a critical error: the myeloma cell line used for the fusion was not the required HGPRT-negative strain but a different, HGPRT-positive (HGPRT+) strain.\n\nAssuming the fusion process itself was successful, predict the most likely outcome for the mixed cell culture after several weeks of growth in the HAT selection medium.\n\nA. Only the desired hybridoma cells will survive and proliferate, leading to a successful production of monoclonal antibodies.\n\nB. All cells in the culture, including unfused spleen cells, unfused myeloma cells, and hybridomas, will be unable to grow and will die.\n\nC. The culture will be dominated by a population of rapidly growing, unfused myeloma cells, rendering the selection of antibody-producing hybridomas ineffective.\n\nD. Only the fused hybridoma cells and the unfused spleen cells will initially survive, but eventually only the hybridomas will remain.\n\nE. The aminopterin in the HAT medium will fail to block nucleotide synthesis in all cells, allowing all original cell populations to grow uncontrollably.", "solution": "HAT selection relies on blocking de novo nucleotide synthesis and forcing cells to use the salvage pathway. Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, shutting down de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis. Hypoxanthine and thymidine in the medium permit nucleotide synthesis only via the salvage pathway, which requires hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) for purine salvage and thymidine kinase for thymidine salvage. Thus, in HAT:\n$$\\text{Survival in HAT} \\iff \\text{functional salvage pathway (HGPRT present, and thymidine kinase present)}.$$\nIn the standard hybridoma protocol, the myeloma partner is deliberately HGPRT-negative, so unfused myeloma cells cannot use the salvage pathway and die in HAT, while spleen cells (HGPRT-positive but non-immortal) survive only transiently. Fused hybridomas inherit immortality from the myeloma line and HGPRT from the spleen B-cells, so they uniquely survive long term.\n\nHere, the error is that the myeloma line was HGPRT-positive. Evaluate each population:\n- Unfused myeloma cells (HGPRT-positive): de novo pathway is blocked by aminopterin, but the salvage pathway is intact, so they survive and proliferate indefinitely.\n- Unfused spleen cells (HGPRT-positive, finite lifespan): they can initially survive via salvage but will senesce and die over weeks because they are not immortal.\n- Hybridomas (immortal and HGPRT-positive via the spleen genome): they also survive and can proliferate.\n\nAfter several weeks, the culture will be dominated by rapidly dividing unfused myeloma cells because they are immortal, numerous, and fully capable of growth in HAT. This overgrowth makes isolation of antibody-producing hybridomas ineffective.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect because unfused HGPRT-positive myeloma cells also survive and proliferate.\n- B is incorrect because both HGPRT-positive myeloma cells and hybridomas survive in HAT.\n- C is correct: unfused HGPRT-positive myeloma cells will dominate the culture, thwarting selection.\n- D is incorrect because it omits survival of unfused myeloma cells; they do survive and overgrow the culture.\n- E is incorrect because aminopterin still blocks de novo synthesis; growth depends on the salvage pathway, which is functional in HGPRT-positive cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2230964"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of HAT selection, this next exercise presents a common experimental failure: a complete absence of surviving cell colonies. To solve this puzzle, you must look beyond the biochemical selection and consider the other essential characteristic that hybridomas must inherit to proliferate indefinitely. This practice deepens your understanding that a successful hybridoma is a unique combination of traits—a functional salvage pathway from the spleen cell and immortality from the myeloma parent [@problem_id:2230973].", "problem": "A researcher is conducting an experiment to generate monoclonal antibodies against a novel antigen. Spleen cells are harvested from a mouse that has been successfully immunized with the antigen. These spleen cells are then fused with a specialized myeloma cell line using polyethylene glycol. The resulting cell mixture is plated onto a selective culture medium known as HAT medium, which contains Hypoxanthine, Aminopterin, and Thymidine.\n\nThe standard protocol relies on specific properties of the parent cells. The spleen cells are mortal (have a finite lifespan) but possess a functional gene for the enzyme Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The myeloma cell line used in this process is engineered to be immortal but deficient in HGPRT (HGPRT-).\n\nAfter several weeks of incubation, the researcher observes that none of the culture wells contain any surviving cell colonies. Assuming the fusion procedure itself was successful and the spleen cells were viable at the start of the experiment, which of the following represents the most likely intrinsic flaw in the myeloma cell line that would account for this specific outcome?\n\nA. The myeloma cell line used was actually HGPRT-positive (HGPRT+).\n\nB. The myeloma cells were secreting their own endogenous immunoglobulins.\n\nC. The myeloma cell line had, through mutation, lost its property of immortality.\n\nD. The myeloma cell line was resistant to aminopterin.\n\nE. The myeloma cell line was derived from a different species than the spleen cells.", "solution": "The selection logic in HAT medium depends on two complementary pathways of nucleotide synthesis and on the distinct properties of the parental cells.\n\n1) Aminopterin in HAT blocks the de novo folate-dependent synthesis of purines and thymidylate by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, so any cell that survives must use the nucleotide salvage pathways provided by hypoxanthine and thymidine in the medium.\n\n2) The purine salvage pathway requires hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) to convert hypoxanthine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) into inosine monophosphate (IMP):\n$$\n\\text{Hypoxanthine} + \\text{PRPP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{HGPRT}} \\text{IMP} + \\text{PP}_{i}.\n$$\nThus, in HAT medium, cells must be HGPRT-positive to synthesize purine nucleotides.\n\n3) The parental cell properties are:\n- Spleen lymphocytes: HGPRT-positive (salvage-capable) but mortal (finite lifespan).\n- Myeloma line: HGPRT-negative (cannot use purine salvage) but immortal (unlimited proliferation).\n\n4) Selection outcomes in HAT:\n- Unfused myeloma cells (HGPRT-negative) die in HAT because de novo synthesis is blocked and they lack salvage.\n- Unfused spleen cells (HGPRT-positive) can initially use salvage but are mortal and do not proliferate long-term; they die out.\n- Only hybridomas, which obtain immortality from the myeloma parent and HGPRT from the spleen parent, survive and proliferate in HAT.\n\n5) The observation is that after several weeks none of the culture wells contain surviving colonies. Given that fusion was successful and spleen cells were viable initially, this implies that the hybridomas did not acquire the immortal growth property. If the myeloma line had lost immortality through mutation, then hybrids would be HGPRT-positive (from spleen) but mortal (from myeloma), so they would not sustain growth and would die off over time, leading to no surviving colonies after weeks.\n\n6) Evaluation of answer choices against the observation:\n- A (myeloma HGPRT-positive): This would allow unfused myeloma cells to survive in HAT via salvage, yielding many surviving colonies, not none; contradicts the observation.\n- B (myeloma secreting immunoglobulins): Affects downstream screening for antigen specificity but does not impair survival in HAT; cannot explain absence of colonies.\n- C (myeloma lost immortality): Hybrids become mortal; unfused myeloma die in HAT; unfused spleen die due to mortality; net result is no surviving colonies after some time; matches the observation.\n- D (myeloma aminopterin-resistant): De novo synthesis would proceed despite aminopterin, allowing unfused myeloma (even if HGPRT-negative) to survive; would produce many colonies; contradicts the observation.\n- E (different species): Cross-species fusion can be problematic, but the prompt stipulates the fusion was successful; moreover, this does not specifically predict zero survival under HAT if true hybrids formed.\n\nTherefore, the most likely intrinsic flaw is loss of immortality in the myeloma line.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2230973"}, {"introduction": "Successfully selecting for hybridomas is only the first part of the process; the ultimate goal is to generate a truly monoclonal population where every cell originates from a single parent. This final practice moves from bulk selection to the critical step of clonal isolation using a technique called limiting dilution. You will apply the Poisson distribution, $P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$, a fundamental statistical tool, to quantify the probability of achieving a monoclonal culture and illustrate how mathematics is essential for optimizing biological procedures [@problem_id:2230985].", "problem": "In the process of generating monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology, a critical step is limiting dilution cloning. This technique aims to isolate a single antibody-producing cell to establish a clonal population. A researcher prepares a suspension of hybridoma cells and distributes it across the wells of a microtiter plate. The number of cells, $k$, that land in any given well can be accurately modeled by a Poisson distribution, $P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$, where $\\lambda$ is the average number of cells per well.\n\nDue to a dilution error, the researcher prepares a cell suspension that, when plated, results in an average of $\\lambda = 0.5$ cells per well. After a suitable incubation period, the researcher observes which wells exhibit cell growth (these are termed \"positive\" wells, meaning they contain at least one cell). A single positive well is then selected at random for subsequent expansion.\n\nCalculate the probability that this randomly selected positive well is polyclonal, meaning it originated from two or more cells. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a randomly selected positive well is polyclonal. This is a conditional probability: the probability that a well contains two or more cells ($k \\ge 2$), given that it contains at least one cell ($k \\ge 1$). We can write this as $P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1)$.\n\nThe average number of cells per well is given as $\\lambda = 0.5$. The probability of a well containing exactly $k$ cells is given by the Poisson distribution:\n$$P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\n\nFirst, let's define the events. Let $A$ be the event that a well is polyclonal ($k \\ge 2$), and let $B$ be the event that a well is positive ($k \\ge 1$). We want to calculate $P(A|B)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nThe event \"$A \\cap B$\" means the well is polyclonal AND positive. If a well has two or more cells, it automatically has at least one cell. Therefore, the event $A \\cap B$ is identical to event $A$. So, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) = \\frac{P(k \\ge 2)}{P(k \\ge 1)}$$\n\nAn alternative and slightly more intuitive way to frame this is to consider the complement event. The complement of a positive well being polyclonal is that it is monoclonal (contains exactly one cell). Therefore:\n$$P(\\text{polyclonal} | \\text{positive}) = 1 - P(\\text{monoclonal} | \\text{positive})$$\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k = 1 | k \\ge 1)$$\n\nLet's calculate $P(k=1 | k \\ge 1)$:\n$$P(k=1 | k \\ge 1) = \\frac{P(k=1 \\cap k \\ge 1)}{P(k \\ge 1)} = \\frac{P(k=1)}{P(k \\ge 1)}$$\n\nWe need to calculate two probabilities: $P(k=1)$ and $P(k \\ge 1)$.\n\nThe probability of a well having exactly one cell ($k=1$) is:\n$$P(k=1) = \\frac{0.5^1 \\exp(-0.5)}{1!} = 0.5 \\exp(-0.5)$$\n\nThe probability of a well being positive ($k \\ge 1$) is the complement of it being empty ($k=0$):\n$$P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=0)$$\nThe probability of a well being empty is:\n$$P(k=0) = \\frac{0.5^0 \\exp(-0.5)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-0.5)}{1} = \\exp(-0.5)$$\nSo, the probability of a well being positive is:\n$$P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-0.5)$$\n\nNow we can calculate the conditional probability of a positive well being monoclonal:\n$$P(k=1 | k \\ge 1) = \\frac{P(k=1)}{P(k \\ge 1)} = \\frac{0.5 \\exp(-0.5)}{1 - \\exp(-0.5)}$$\n\nFinally, the probability that the selected positive well is polyclonal is:\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=1 | k \\ge 1) = 1 - \\frac{0.5 \\exp(-0.5)}{1 - \\exp(-0.5)}$$\nCombining the terms into a single fraction:\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) = \\frac{(1 - \\exp(-0.5)) - 0.5 \\exp(-0.5)}{1 - \\exp(-0.5)} = \\frac{1 - 1.5 \\exp(-0.5)}{1 - \\exp(-0.5)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical value for $\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.6065306597$.\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) \\approx \\frac{1 - 1.5 \\times 0.6065306597}{1 - 0.6065306597}$$\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.9097960}{0.3934693}$$\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) \\approx \\frac{0.0902040}{0.3934693} \\approx 0.229250$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.229$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.229}$$", "id": "2230985"}]}
