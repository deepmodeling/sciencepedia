The state of each protein at the next time step, `t+1`, is determined by the states of other proteins at the current time step, `t`, according to a set of logical rules. This is known as a synchronous update scheme.\n\nConsider a simplified signaling pathway involving an external signal `S` and four proteins: `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, and an inhibitory protein `I1`. The interactions are governed by the following rules:\n- An \"activation\" rule `A -> B` means that `B` will be ON at `t+1` if `A` is ON at `t`.\n- An \"inhibition\" rule `A -| B` means that `B` will be OFF at `t+1` if `A` is ON at `t`, and this inhibition overrides any activating signals.\n\nThe specific network topology is as follows:\n1.  The external signal `S` activates `P1`.\n2.  `P1` activates `P2`.\n3.  `P1` also activates the inhibitor `I1`.\n4.  `P2` activates `P3`.\n5.  `I1` inhibits `P3`.\n\nMore formally, the state of a protein at `t+1` is determined by these Boolean logic rules:\n- `P1(t+1)` is ON if and only if `S(t)` is ON.\n- `P2(t+1)` is ON if and only if `P1(t)` is ON.\n- `I1(t+1)` is ON if and only if `P1(t)` is ON.\n- `P3(t+1)` is ON if and only if `P2(t)` is ON AND `I1(t)` is OFF.\n\nAt time `t=0`, all proteins (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `I1`) are in the OFF state. For all times `t >= 0`, the external signal `S` is permanently held in the ON state. The system will evolve over discrete time steps (`t=1, 2, 3, ...`) and eventually settle into a steady state, where the ON/OFF state of every protein no longer changes.\n\nWhat is the final steady-state configuration of the proteins?
