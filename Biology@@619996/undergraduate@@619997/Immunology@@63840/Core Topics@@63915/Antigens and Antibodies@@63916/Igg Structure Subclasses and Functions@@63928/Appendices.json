A purified sample of IgG molecules is treated with an excess of a reducing agent, Dithiothreitol (DTT). Following this treatment, the sample is analyzed using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), which separates molecules based on their size. The analysis reveals the disappearance of the band corresponding to intact IgG (approximately 150 kDa) and the appearance of two new bands corresponding to smaller polypeptide chains: one at approximately 50 kDa and another at approximately 25 kDa. This indicates that the DTT treatment successfully dissociated the IgG molecule into its constituent heavy and light chains.\n\nWhich of the following specific types of chemical bonds within the IgG molecule was cleaved by the DTT treatment, leading to the separation of the heavy and light chains?\n\nA. Peptide bonds\nB. Hydrogen bonds\nC. Disulfide bonds\nD. Ionic bonds\nE. Glycosidic bonds", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the specific bond cleaved by the reducing agent Dithiothreitol (DTT) that results in the dissociation of an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule into its heavy and light chains.\n\nFirst, let's review the fundamental structure of an IgG molecule. An IgG antibody is a tetrameric protein complex, meaning it is composed of four polypeptide chains. These consist of two identical heavy (H) chains, each with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa, and two identical light (L) chains, each with a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. The four chains are arranged in a characteristic Y-shape.\n\nFor the tetrameric structure to be stable, these four individual polypeptide chains must be covalently linked to one another. The specific type of covalent bond that links separate polypeptide chains in many proteins, including antibodies, is the disulfide bond. A disulfide bond is a covalent bond, also known as a disulfide bridge, formed between the thiol groups (-SH) of two cysteine amino acid residues. The reaction is an oxidation: $R_1\\text{-SH} + R_2\\text{-SH} \\rightarrow R_1\\text{-S-S-}R_2 + 2\\text{H}^{+} + 2e^{-}$.\n\nWithin an IgG molecule, these inter-chain disulfide bonds are found in specific locations:\n1.  Between each heavy chain and its adjacent light chain.\n2.  Between the two heavy chains in a flexible area known as the hinge region.\n\nReducing agents, such as Dithiothreitol (DTT) or $\\beta$-mercaptoethanol, are chemicals that donate electrons and reverse oxidative processes. Their primary function in protein chemistry is to break disulfide bonds by reducing them back to two individual thiol groups. The cleavage of these inter-chain disulfide bonds by DTT eliminates the covalent linkages holding the heavy and light chains together. As a result, the single 150 kDa IgG molecule dissociates into its constituent parts: two heavy chains (50 kDa each) and two light chains (25 kDa each), which is consistent with the experimental observation.\n\nNow let's evaluate the other options:\nA. Peptide bonds are the covalent bonds that link amino acids together in a sequence to form a single polypeptide chain. If DTT cleaved peptide bonds, the heavy and light chains would themselves be degraded into smaller peptide fragments or individual amino acids, not observed in the experiment.\nB. Hydrogen bonds are non-covalent interactions that are crucial for the secondary (e.g., alpha-helices, beta-sheets) and tertiary structure of each polypeptide chain. While they help maintain the overall 3D shape, they are not the strong, covalent links holding the different chains together. They are also not the primary target of reducing agents like DTT.\nD. Ionic bonds (or salt bridges) are non-covalent electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged amino acid side chains. Like hydrogen bonds, they contribute to the folded tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein but are not covalent links between chains and are not specifically cleaved by DTT.\nE. Glycosidic bonds are covalent bonds that link carbohydrate (sugar) moieties to the protein. IgG molecules are glycoproteins, with carbohydrates typically attached to the CH2 domain of the heavy chains. Cleaving these bonds would remove the sugar groups but would not cause the heavy and light polypeptide chains to separate from each other.\n\nTherefore, the only bond type listed that is specifically cleaved by reducing agents and is responsible for holding the heavy and light chains of IgG together is the disulfide bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2235659"}, {"introduction": "Once the structure of IgG is understood, we can explore how it interacts with the rest of the immune system to eliminate pathogens. This problem presents a clinical scenario where a specific mutation in the IgG molecule's Fc region impairs its ability to bind to a key receptor on phagocytes. This exercise challenges you to connect a precise molecular structure to a critical effector function, phagocytosis, illustrating how genetic variations can lead to specific immunodeficiencies [@problem_id:2235642].", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent, severe infections with encapsulated bacteria. Laboratory analysis reveals a point mutation in the gene encoding the heavy chain of their Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. This mutation results in a conformational change in the lower hinge and upper CH2 domain of the IgG Fc region. Functionally, this mutated IgG binds to antigens via its Fab regions with normal affinity. However, it completely fails to bind to the high-affinity Fc-gamma Receptor I (FcγRI, also known as CD64), which is predominantly expressed on macrophages and monocytes. All other aspects of the patient's immune system, including complement proteins, other immunoglobulin isotypes, and other Fc receptors like FcγRII, FcγRIII, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), are presumed to function normally.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, which of the following immunological effector functions would be the most significantly impaired in this patient when they encounter a bacterium they have been previously immunized against?\n\nA. Neutralization of soluble bacterial exotoxins.\nB. Activation of the classical complement pathway via C1q binding.\nC. Transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to a fetus.\nD. Phagocytic clearance of opsonized bacteria by macrophages.\nE. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by Natural Killer (NK) cells.", "solution": "The mutation causes a conformational change in the lower hinge and upper CH2 domain of the IgG Fc region that abrogates binding to Fc-gamma Receptor I (FcγRI, CD64) while preserving normal antigen binding by Fab regions. By stipulation, other Fc receptors (FcγRII/CD32, FcγRIII/CD16, and FcRn) and complement proteins function normally.\n\nTo determine which effector function is most impaired, consider the mechanisms:\n\n1) Neutralization of toxins (Option A) depends on Fab-mediated binding to toxins and does not require Fc receptor engagement. Because Fab affinity is preserved, neutralization remains intact.\n\n2) Classical complement activation (Option B) requires C1q binding to clustered Fc regions on antigen-bound IgG. Although C1q interacts near the CH2 region, the problem specifies only a loss of FcγRI binding and states that other immune components, including complement proteins and other Fc receptor systems, function normally. There is no stated defect in C1q-IgG interaction, and other isotypes are intact; thus this is not the most significantly impaired function.\n\n3) Transplacental antibody transfer (Option C) is mediated by FcRn, which the problem states functions normally. Therefore, this process is preserved.\n\n4) Phagocytic clearance of opsonized bacteria by macrophages (Option D) critically depends on high-affinity FcγRI (CD64) on macrophages and monocytes for binding IgG-opsonized pathogens and triggering phagocytosis and killing. Given the complete failure of the mutated IgG to bind FcγRI, this pathway is specifically and profoundly impaired. This is particularly consequential for encapsulated bacteria, whose clearance relies heavily on opsonization and Fc receptor–mediated phagocytosis.\n\n5) ADCC by NK cells (Option E) is mediated by FcγRIII (CD16) on NK cells. Because FcγRIII function is preserved, ADCC remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the most significantly impaired effector function is macrophage phagocytic clearance of IgG-opsonized bacteria via FcγRI.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2235642"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of structure and function, this final practice delves into the world of antibody engineering and the subtle yet significant differences between IgG subclasses. You will analyze a hypothetical chimeric antibody where the flexible hinge of IgG3 is replaced with the rigid hinge of IgG2. This advanced problem requires you to predict how this specific structural modification impacts a powerful effector function—complement activation—highlighting the sophisticated interplay between molecular flexibility and immunological potency [@problem_id:2235650].", "problem": "A team of immunologists is investigating the structure-function relationship of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses. They focus on human IgG3, which is known for its exceptionally long and flexible hinge region, and human IgG2, which possesses a short and rigid hinge. To probe the role of the hinge, they engineer a chimeric antibody, which we will call `IgG3-H2`. This molecule consists of the complete constant region of a human IgG3 antibody, but its native hinge-coding exon has been replaced with the corresponding exon from a human IgG2 gene. The variable regions of this chimeric antibody are identical to a wild-type IgG3 parent antibody and are highly specific for a single, repeating epitope on the surface of a pathogenic bacterium.\n\nThe team then compares the functional properties of the chimeric `IgG3-H2` molecule to the wild-type IgG3 molecule in a series of in vitro assays. Assuming the engineering and folding of the chimeric antibody are successful, which of the following outcomes is the most likely observation when comparing `IgG3-H2` to its wild-type IgG3 counterpart?\n\nA. The `IgG3-H2` molecule will exhibit a significant reduction in its ability to activate the classical complement pathway and a decreased efficiency in opsonizing the bacterium for phagocytosis.\nB. The `IgG3-H2` molecule will show a complete loss of antigen-binding affinity for the bacterial surface protein because the hinge region is critical for the conformation of the antigen-binding site.\nC. The `IgG3-H2` molecule will demonstrate an enhanced ability to neutralize the bacterium by promoting more effective aggregation (agglutination) due to the increased structural stability conferred by the rigid hinge.\nD. There will be no significant change in effector function, as the CH2 and CH3 domains, which bind to complement and Fc receptors, remain of the IgG3 isotype.\nE. The `IgG3-H2` molecule will display a significantly increased serum half-life but will have lost the ability to cross the placental barrier.", "solution": "First, specify the engineered change: the chimeric antibody IgG3-H2 retains the entire IgG3 constant region (including CH2 and CH3 domains) but replaces the native IgG3 hinge exon with the hinge exon from IgG2. The variable regions are identical to the wild-type IgG3 and thus define the same antigen specificity for a repeating bacterial epitope.\n\nNext, recall the roles of the hinge and constant domains in IgG effector function. The hinge controls Fab arm flexibility and reach, influencing:\n- The ability to engage epitopes at varying distances and orientations (avidity and agglutination).\n- The geometry and spacing of Fc regions in antigen-bound arrays, which is critical for C1q docking and activation of the classical complement pathway.\n- The efficiency of forming higher-order immune complexes and promoting Fc-Fc interactions (e.g., IgG hexamerization on surfaces), which further enhances C1q engagement.\n\nBy contrast, the CH2 and CH3 domains determine intrinsic binding interfaces for complement component C1q and Fc gamma receptors. However, effective complement activation and Fc receptor clustering in the context of an antigen surface also require an appropriate spatial arrangement of Fc regions, which is strongly modulated by the hinge.\n\nCompare hinge properties by subclass:\n- IgG3 has a long, flexible hinge, correlating with the strongest classical complement activation among IgG subclasses and excellent capacity to cross-link repeating epitopes and form large immune complexes.\n- IgG2 has a short, rigid hinge, correlating with relatively poor complement activation and reduced flexibility for cross-linking epitopes.\n\nPredict the effect of swapping in an IgG2 hinge into an IgG3 constant region. Although the CH2 and CH3 domains remain IgG3 (preserving their intrinsic sequence determinants for C1q and Fc gamma receptor binding), the hinge replacement will:\n- Decrease the flexibility and alter the spacing of Fc regions upon antigen binding, impairing IgG hexamerization and optimal C1q docking; thus, classical complement activation is reduced compared to wild-type IgG3.\n- Reduce the efficiency of forming large immune complexes on the bacterial surface, thereby decreasing complement deposition (C3b) and, secondarily, decreasing opsonization for phagocytosis. Even for Fc gamma receptor-mediated uptake, less optimal immune complex geometry can reduce receptor cross-linking.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A aligns with the above: a significant reduction in classical complement activation with decreased opsonization is expected due to the short, rigid IgG2 hinge replacing the IgG3 hinge.\n- Option B is incorrect because antigen-binding affinity is determined by the variable domains; while hinge properties can alter avidity and geometry, they do not abrogate the intrinsic paratope affinity, so complete loss of binding is not expected.\n- Option C is incorrect because increased rigidity typically reduces, not enhances, agglutination of repeating epitopes; IgG3’s flexible hinge is superior for agglutination.\n- Option D is incorrect because, despite CH2/CH3 remaining IgG3, hinge-mediated geometry crucially influences C1q engagement and Fc-dependent functions; thus, effector function is not unchanged.\n- Option E is incorrect because serum half-life and placental transfer are mediated by FcRn interactions primarily at the CH2-CH3 interface; the hinge swap does not produce the stated changes. IgG3’s shorter half-life relates to FcRn-binding determinants, not the hinge, and placental transfer is likewise FcRn-dependent and not abolished by hinge changes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is reduced complement activation and decreased opsonization for phagocytosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2235650"}]}
