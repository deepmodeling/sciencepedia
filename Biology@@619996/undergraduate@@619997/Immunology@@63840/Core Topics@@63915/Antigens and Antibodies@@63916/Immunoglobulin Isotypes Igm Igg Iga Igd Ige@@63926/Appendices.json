To test their knowledge, the student tries to recall the typical relative abundance of the major isotypes in a healthy adult.\n\nWhich one of the following options correctly ranks the immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, and IgE according to their typical serum concentration, from the highest concentration to the lowest concentration?\n\nA.

The generally accepted order of abundance in serum is:\n- IgG is the most abundant serum immunoglobulin.\n- IgA is next most abundant overall in serum, but it is not part of the options asked here.\n- IgM has a lower serum concentration than IgG but higher than IgE.\n- IgE is present at the lowest concentration in serum due to its high affinity for Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils and its typically minimal free serum level in healthy individuals.\n\nRestricting to the isotypes in the question, the typical ranking by serum concentration is:\n$$\\text{IgG} > \\text{IgM} > \\text{IgE}$$\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2238872"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static concentrations, the true power of the humoral immune response lies in its dynamic nature. Following an encounter with a pathogen, the production of different antibody isotypes follows a predictable timeline, which is crucial for diagnostics. This exercise [@problem_id:2238892] asks you to apply this temporal principle to a common clinical scenario, enhancing your ability to distinguish recent infections from established, long-term immunity by identifying the key early-response antibody.", "problem": "A team of epidemiologists is conducting a serological surveillance study to monitor the spread of a novel respiratory virus in a community. Their goal is to differentiate between individuals who have an active or very recent infection and those who were infected in the past and have developed long-term immunity. The diagnostic assay they employ measures the concentration of different immunoglobulin (Ig) classes in patient blood samples. Which of the following immunoglobulin classes would serve as the most reliable and primary biomarker for identifying an acute, first-time infection with this novel pathogen?\n\nA. IgA\n\nB. IgD\n\nC. IgE\n\nD. IgG\n\nE. IgM", "solution": "We are asked to identify the immunoglobulin class that serves as the most reliable and primary biomarker of an acute, first-time infection.\n\nKey immunological principle: During a primary humoral immune response, naive B cells initially produce antibodies of the IgM class before undergoing class-switch recombination to other isotypes such as IgG, IgA, or IgE. This occurs because the default constant region expressed by naive B cells is C_{\\mu}, leading to secretion of IgM. IgM appears early in the course of a first-time (primary) infection, is typically short-lived in serum, and its presence at elevated levels is a hallmark of acute or very recent primary infection.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- IgA: Predominantly associated with mucosal immunity and secretions; while important in mucosal defense, it is not the earliest systemic marker of primary infection.\n- IgD: Functions mainly as a B-cell receptor on naive B cells; it is not typically used as a serum biomarker of acute infection.\n- IgE: Associated with type I hypersensitivity reactions and defense against helminths; not indicative of acute primary viral infection.\n- IgG: Appears later in the primary response after class switching and is the dominant isotype in secondary responses; elevated IgG typically indicates past infection or established immunity rather than acute primary infection.\n- IgM: First antibody isotype produced in a primary response, rises early during acute infection, and is the most reliable primary biomarker for an acute, first-time infection.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is IgM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2238892"}, {"introduction": "Having established the sequence of isotype appearance, we can now delve into the underlying molecular machinery that governs this process. The diversification of antibodies, through class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, is orchestrated by specific enzymes. This final practice uses a thought experiment involving a genetic knockout model [@problem_id:2238893] to test your understanding of the central role of the enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID), providing a deeper, mechanistic comprehension of how antibody responses mature.", "problem": "A team of immunologists is investigating the molecular mechanisms of antibody diversification. They have developed a transgenic mouse line in which the gene for Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) has been completely knocked out. These mice are viable and possess a normal repertoire of naive B lymphocytes.\n\nThe researchers perform an immunization experiment. The AID-knockout mice are first immunized with a T-cell dependent protein antigen, ovalbumin, emulsified in adjuvant. Four weeks later, the same mice receive a secondary, or \"booster,\" immunization with the same ovalbumin antigen. One week after this secondary immunization, serum is collected to analyze the specific antibody response against ovalbumin.\n\nAssuming the initial activation of B cells and T helper cells proceeds normally, which of the following best describes the characteristics of the anti-ovalbumin antibodies expected to be found in the serum of these AID-knockout mice after the secondary immunization?\n\nA. High-affinity IgG\n\nB. Low-affinity IgM\n\nC. High-affinity IgM\n\nD. Low-affinity IgA\n\nE. No antibody production", "solution": "AID (Activation-Induced Deaminase) catalyzes cytidine deamination in immunoglobulin loci, creating U:G mismatches that are essential intermediates for two processes:\n- Class switch recombination (CSR), which changes the constant region and thus the isotype (e.g., from IgM/IgD to IgG, IgA, or IgE).\n- Somatic hypermutation (SHM), which introduces point mutations in variable regions, enabling affinity maturation.\n\nIn AID-knockout mice:\n1. CSR cannot occur; B cells cannot switch from IgM/IgD to other isotypes. Therefore, antigen-specific antibodies remain IgM (and IgD on naive B cells, but secreted antibody is predominantly IgM).\n2. SHM cannot occur; there is no diversification in the variable region after activation, so no affinity maturation takes place. Consequently, antibodies retain their initial, low affinity.\n\nGiven a T-dependent antigen (ovalbumin) and normal initial activation of B and T helper cells, B cells can still differentiate into plasmablasts/plasma cells and secrete antibody. However, in the absence of AID, even after a booster immunization:\n- There will be no isotype switch to IgG, IgA, or IgE.\n- There will be no increase in affinity via SHM.\n\nTherefore, the serum after secondary immunization will contain anti-ovalbumin antibodies that are unswitched and not affinity-matured, i.e., low-affinity IgM.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2238893"}]}
