This practice encourages you to think of an antibody as a composite of well-defined parts by performing a fundamental calculation.

A typical human IgG molecule has a total molecular weight of approximately 150 kiloDaltons (kDa). This structure is composed of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains, each with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa, and two identical light chains, each with a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. The chains are held together by disulfide bonds.\n\nEnzymatic cleavage at a specific site, known as the hinge region, can break the IgG molecule into distinct fragments. One such fragment is the Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab). A single Fab fragment consists of one entire light chain covalently linked to the N-terminal portion of one heavy chain. This heavy chain portion constitutes approximately half of the heavy chain's total mass.\n\nGiven this information, calculate the approximate molecular weight of a single Fab fragment. Express your answer in kiloDaltons (kDa).", "solution": "The goal of the problem is to calculate the molecular weight of a single Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab). We are provided with the molecular weights of the constituent components of an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule.\n\nFirst, let's list the information given in the problem statement:\n- Molecular weight of a single heavy chain, $M_H = 50$ kDa.\n- Molecular weight of a single light chain, $M_L = 25$ kDa.\n- The total molecular weight of an IgG molecule is $M_{IgG} = 150$ kDa. We can verify the consistency of the component weights: $2 \\times M_H + 2 \\times M_L = 2 \\times 50 \\text{ kDa} + 2 \\times 25 \\text{ kDa} = 100 \\text{ kDa} + 50 \\text{ kDa} = 150 \\text{ kDa}$. This matches the given total molecular weight, confirming the data is consistent.\n\nThe problem states that a single Fab fragment is composed of two parts:\n1.  One entire light chain.\n2.  The N-terminal portion of one heavy chain, which has a mass equal to approximately half of the total heavy chain mass.\n\nLet's calculate the mass of the heavy chain portion present in the Fab fragment.\nMass of the heavy chain portion = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times M_H$\nMass of the heavy chain portion = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 \\text{ kDa} = 25 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\nThe total molecular weight of the Fab fragment, $M_{Fab}$, is the sum of the masses of its components.\n$M_{Fab} = (\\text{Mass of one light chain}) + (\\text{Mass of the heavy chain portion})$\n$M_{Fab} = M_L + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times M_H)$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n$M_{Fab} = 25 \\text{ kDa} + 25 \\text{ kDa}$\n$M_{Fab} = 50 \\text{ kDa}$\n\nThus, the approximate molecular weight of a single Fab fragment is 50 kDa.

This exercise focuses on the Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs), the hypervariable loops that form the antigen-binding site. Correctly identifying the total number of CDRs within a single Fab fragment is key to connecting the antibody's overall architecture to its functional specificity [@problem_id:2218654].", "problem": "In the field of immunology, understanding the precise structure of antibodies is crucial for developing therapies and diagnostics. A typical antibody, or immunoglobulin, is a Y-shaped protein composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. The antigen-binding specificity of an antibody is determined by its variable (V) regions, located at the tips of the \"Y\". Within each variable region, both on the heavy chain ($V_H$) and the light chain ($V_L$), are three specific loops of amino acids known as Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs). These CDRs form the surface that directly contacts the antigen.\n\nAn antibody can be proteolytically cleaved into specific parts. One of these parts is the Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragment. A single Fab fragment consists of one entire light chain (containing one variable domain, $V_L$, and one constant domain, $C_L$) paired with the N-terminal portion of one heavy chain (containing one variable domain, $V_H$, and the first constant domain, $C_{H1}$).\n\nBased on this structural information, what is the total number of Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) present in a single Fab fragment?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 6\n\nD. 9\n\nE. 12", "solution": "An antibody consists of two heavy and two light chains.

This problem presents a hypothetical scenario to challenge your understanding of the rules governing immunoglobulin assembly, specifically the principle of light chain isotopic exclusion. Assessing the biological plausibility of a hybrid antibody containing both $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ light chains moves your understanding from static anatomy to the dynamic genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure antibody integrity [@problem_id:2218630].", "problem": "A biomedical research team is working with a human plasma cell line to produce monoclonal antibodies. They report the isolation and characterization of a novel Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule. Their analysis confirms that the molecule is a monomer composed of two identical gamma ($\\gamma$) heavy chains. However, their protein sequencing results indicate an unusual feature: one of the light chains is a kappa ($\\kappa$) type, and the other light chain is a lambda ($\\lambda$) type.\n\nBased on the established principles of immunoglobulin synthesis and assembly within a single B lymphocyte-derived plasma cell, which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment of this finding?\n\nA. The reported structure is biologically implausible. Due to a process called light chain isotopic exclusion, a single plasma cell is committed to synthesizing only one type of light chain (either $\\kappa$ or $\\lambda$), making a hybrid antibody molecule impossible.\n\nB. The reported structure is plausible. The two light chain types are functionally equivalent, and during periods of high antibody production, a cell may co-express both light chain genes to increase the rate of antibody assembly.\n\nC. The reported structure is biologically implausible. The disulfide bonds that link the light chain to the heavy chain are specific; a $\\kappa$ chain uses a different cysteine residue for bonding than a $\\lambda$ chain, preventing them from assembling with the same heavy chain type in a single molecule.\n\nD. The reported structure is plausible. This represents a known phenomenon called \"light chain class switching,\" which is analogous to heavy chain class switching and allows the antibody to adapt its antigen-binding properties.\n\nE. The reported structure is biologically implausible. While heavy chains of the same class (e.g., IgG) are identical, the light chains must also be identical because they are translated from the same single messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that codes for an entire half-antibody (one heavy chain and one light chain).", "solution": "1. In a single B lymphocyte, immunoglobulin genes undergo somatic recombination to produce one functional heavy chain gene and one functional light chain gene. The light chain can derive from either the $\\kappa$ locus or the $\\lambda$ locus, but not both, due to isotypic (allelic) exclusion.\n2. Isotypic exclusion for light chains means that once a productive rearrangement and expression occur at the $\\kappa$ locus, the $\\lambda$ locus is not expressed, and vice versa. Thus, a single plasma cell synthesizes only one light chain type: either $\\kappa$ or $\\lambda$, but not both.\n3. Antibody assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum yields an IgG monomer composed of two identical $\\gamma$ heavy chains and two identical light chains, which must be of the same isotype in a given clonal plasma cell because only one light chain isotype is produced in that cell.\n4. Therefore, a single antibody molecule composed of one $\\kappa$ light chain and one $\\lambda$ light chain, produced by a single plasma cell, contradicts the established principle of light chain isotypic exclusion and is biologically implausible.\n5. Evaluating alternatives:\n   - A correctly states that light chain isotypic exclusion precludes a hybrid $\\kappa/\\lambda$ antibody from a single plasma cell.\n   - B is incorrect; co-expression of both light chain isotypes does not occur under normal physiology because of isotypic exclusion.\n   - C is incorrect; the incompatibility is not due to different disulfide linkage sites between $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ with the same heavy chain. Both light chain types can pair with the same class of heavy chain; the barrier is cellular expression, not bond specificity.\n   - D is incorrect; there is no \"light chain class switching\" analogous to heavy chain class switching.\n   - E is incorrect; heavy and light chains are translated from separate mRNAs and assemble post-translationally; there is no single mRNA encoding an entire half-antibody.\n6. Hence, the most accurate assessment is that the reported structure is biologically implausible due to light chain isotypic exclusion, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2218630"}]}
