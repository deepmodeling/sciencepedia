{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before exploring the intricate cellular mechanisms of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH), we must first grasp its fundamental nature. A pivotal question in an earlier era of immunology was whether this \"delayed\" reaction was mediated by blood-borne antibodies, like many other immune responses, or by living immune cells. This practice revisits the logic of the classic transfer experiments that definitively showed DTH to be a cell-mediated phenomenon, providing a cornerstone for our modern understanding [@problem_id:2284708].", "problem": "An immunologist is conducting an experiment to investigate the mechanisms of a Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, a type of cell-mediated immune response. First, a healthy guinea pig, designated GP-S (Sensitized), is injected with an antigen derived from *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* to induce immunologic memory. Several weeks later, various biological components are isolated from GP-S. A second guinea pig, GP-N (Naive), which has never been exposed to the antigen, is used as a recipient. The goal is to transfer the specific sensitivity to the tuberculin antigen from GP-S to GP-N, such that a subsequent intradermal injection of the antigen into GP-N will cause a characteristic hardened, red lesion at the injection site after 48-72 hours.\n\nWhich of the following components, when isolated from the sensitized guinea pig (GP-S) and injected into the naive guinea pig (GP-N), would be capable of successfully transferring this DTH sensitivity?\n\nA. Serum, which is the cell-free fluid component of blood containing antibodies.\n\nB. A purified population of B-lymphocytes.\n\nC. A purified population of T-lymphocytes.\n\nD. A purified population of neutrophils.\n\nE. A suspension of red blood cells.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the immunologic mechanism being tested. Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) is a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by antigen-specific, memory T lymphocytes (classically Th1 cells). Upon re-exposure to the specific antigen, these T cells recognize antigen presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II, become activated, and secrete cytokines (such as interferon-gamma) that recruit and activate macrophages, producing the characteristic indurated, erythematous lesion 48 to 72 hours after antigen challenge.\n\nStep 2: Determine the transferable component of immunity in DTH. Because DTH is cell-mediated and depends on memory T lymphocytes, passive transfer of this sensitivity requires viable, antigen-specific T cells from the sensitized donor. Humoral components (antibodies in serum) do not mediate DTH and therefore cannot transfer this type of sensitivity.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option based on the mechanism.\n- Option A (Serum): Contains antibodies; effective for transferring humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity but not cell-mediated DTH. Not sufficient.\n- Option B (Purified B-lymphocytes): B cells are responsible for antibody production; they do not mediate DTH. Not sufficient.\n- Option C (Purified T-lymphocytes): These are the effector and memory cells responsible for DTH. This population can transfer antigen-specific DTH sensitivity. Sufficient.\n- Option D (Neutrophils): Innate effector cells; not antigen-specific and not responsible for DTH initiation. Not sufficient.\n- Option E (Red blood cells): Non-immune cells; no role in antigen-specific adaptive responses. Not sufficient.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the correct transferable component. Only the purified T-lymphocyte population from the sensitized animal can transfer DTH sensitivity to a naive recipient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284708"}, {"introduction": "Having established that T-lymphocytes are the essential mediators of DTH, we can now dissect the specific roles of different T-cell subsets. This exercise presents a hypothetical experiment to pinpoint the necessity of CD4+ \"helper\" T-cells in executing the inflammatory response to a contact allergen. By predicting the outcome of depleting these specific cells, you will reinforce your understanding of the cellular cascade that drives the characteristic inflammation of DTH [@problem_id:2284682].", "problem": "An immunologist is studying a classic model of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) using mice. In the experiment, a group of mice is first sensitized by applying a chemical allergen, dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), to the skin on their abdomen. This initial exposure, known as the sensitization phase, elicits a primary immune response but causes no visible skin reaction. Ten days later, the immunologist initiates the challenge phase. Just one hour before applying a small amount of DNFB to the left ear of a previously sensitized mouse, the researcher injects the mouse with a highly specific monoclonal antibody that binds to the Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) surface molecule, leading to the rapid and effective depletion of all CD4+ T cells from circulation and tissues. The right ear is left untreated as a control. The researcher will measure the ear thickness 24 to 48 hours after the challenge to quantify the inflammatory response.\n\nAssuming the mouse was successfully sensitized and the antibody-mediated depletion was complete, which of the following outcomes is expected for the challenged left ear?\n\nA. The left ear will show a significantly reduced or absent swelling response compared to a sensitized control mouse that did not receive the depleting antibody.\n\nB. The left ear will exhibit a rapid and pronounced swelling accompanied by fluid-filled blisters within 30 minutes of the DNFB application.\n\nC. The depletion of CD4+ T cells will have no effect on the ear swelling, as sensitization has already generated a population of memory cells capable of mounting the response.\n\nD. The inflammatory response will be more intense and rapid, as cytotoxic CD8+ T cells will overcompensate for the absence of CD4+ T cells.\n\nE. The ear will develop signs of immune complex deposition, characterized by vasculitis and hemorrhage, due to a switch from a cell-mediated to an antibody-mediated response.", "solution": "The key immunologic mechanism in a classic Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH; type IV hypersensitivity) response is antigen-specific activation of memory CD4^{+} T helper type 1 cells ($T_{H1}$) at the challenge site. Upon re-encounter with the hapten-protein complex presented on MHC class II by local antigen-presenting cells, these $T_{H1}$ cells become reactivated and secrete cytokines such as Interferon-γ and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, which:\n- Upregulate endothelial adhesion molecules to recruit monocytes and other leukocytes,\n- Activate macrophages,\n- Increase vascular permeability and local tissue edema.\n\nThis response characteristically develops over $24$ to $48$ hours, producing measurable swelling and induration at the challenge site. Thus, the effector phase of DTH is mediated primarily by CD4^{+} $T_{H1}$ cells and their cytokines.\n\nIn the described experiment, the mouse was successfully sensitized, establishing hapten-specific memory T cells. However, one hour before challenge, the experimenter depletes all CD4^{+} T cells. Because the effector arm of classic DTH requires CD4^{+} $T_{H1}$ cells at the time of antigen re-exposure, removing these cells immediately prior to challenge abrogates the local cytokine cascade and macrophage recruitment that produce the swelling. Memory that resides in CD4^{+} cells cannot function if those cells are absent at the time of challenge, and other lymphocyte subsets do not typically compensate to generate a classic DTH response.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: depletion of CD4^{+} T cells immediately before challenge will significantly reduce or abolish the characteristic $24$–$48$ hour swelling of DTH.\n- B is incorrect: a rapid response within $30$ minutes with wheal and blistering is typical of type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity, not DTH.\n- C is incorrect: although sensitization generated memory, the effector CD4^{+} $T_{H1}$ cells are required at challenge; their depletion prevents the response.\n- D is incorrect: CD8^{+} T cells do not typically overcompensate to create a more intense and rapid DTH; the classic DTH effector phase depends on CD4^{+} cells.\n- E is incorrect: immune complex-mediated vasculitis is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity and would not be expected from acute CD4^{+} T-cell depletion in this model.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome for the challenged left ear is a significantly reduced or absent swelling response relative to a sensitized control without CD4^{+} depletion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2284682"}, {"introduction": "The principles of DTH extend far beyond basic science, offering powerful insights into the diagnosis and pathology of human disease. This clinical scenario delves into leprosy, a classic example of a disease whose clinical presentation exists on a spectrum dictated by the patient's T-cell response to the bacterium *Mycobacterium leprae*. By correlating the DTH reaction in a skin test with the clinical findings, you can appreciate how the strength and type of cell-mediated immunity directly determine the outcome of an infection [@problem_id:2284729].", "problem": "Two patients, designated Patient X and Patient Y, present with skin lesions and are being evaluated for leprosy, a disease caused by the intracellular bacterium *Mycobacterium leprae*. The clinical and histopathological findings for each patient are summarized below:\n\n- **Patient X**: Presents with a single, well-demarcated, hypopigmented, and anesthetic (loss of sensation) plaque on their back. A skin biopsy from the lesion's edge reveals a well-formed granuloma containing numerous lymphocytes and epithelioid macrophages, but very few acid-fast bacilli are detected.\n- **Patient Y**: Presents with multiple, diffuse, and poorly defined nodules and plaques distributed symmetrically over the face and limbs. Sensation over these lesions is largely intact. A skin biopsy reveals sheets of macrophages filled with a very high number of acid-fast bacilli, but a notable scarcity of lymphocytes.\n\nA diagnostic skin test, known as the lepromin test, is performed on both patients. The test involves an intradermal injection of an antigen preparation containing heat-killed *M. leprae*. The reaction at the injection site is evaluated after 48 to 72 hours for signs of a Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, characterized by induration (firm swelling) and erythema (redness).\n\nBased on the principles of cellular immunology that govern the spectrum of leprosy, which of the following outcomes is the most predictable result of the lepromin test for these two patients?\n\nA. Patient X will develop significant induration and erythema, while Patient Y will show little to no reaction.\n\nB. Patient Y will develop significant induration and erythema, while Patient X will show little to no reaction.\n\nC. Both Patient X and Patient Y will develop significant induration and erythema.\n\nD. Neither Patient X nor Patient Y will show a significant reaction.\n\nE. Both Patient X and Patient Y will develop an immediate wheal-and-flare reaction within 30 minutes, which will fade before the 48-hour reading.", "solution": "Leprosy presents along an immunologic spectrum governed by the host’s cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against intracellular *Mycobacterium leprae*. The lepromin skin test is an in vivo assessment of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH; type IV hypersensitivity) to M. leprae antigens, read at 48 to 72 hours as induration and erythema. A positive DTH requires a robust Th1-type CMI with antigen-specific T cells that release cytokines (notably IFN-γ and IL-2), activate macrophages, and promote granuloma formation. A negative test reflects poor CMI and a Th2-skewed response with ineffective control of intracellular bacilli.\n\nPatient X has a single, well-demarcated, anesthetic hypopigmented plaque with a biopsy showing well-formed granulomas, numerous lymphocytes and epithelioid macrophages, and very few acid-fast bacilli. These findings indicate tuberculoid leprosy (paucibacillary disease) characterized by strong Th1-mediated CMI, macrophage activation, and effective containment of organisms. Therefore, Patient X is expected to mount a positive DTH response on the lepromin test with significant induration and erythema at 48 to 72 hours.\n\nPatient Y has multiple, diffuse, symmetric lesions with largely intact sensation and a biopsy showing sheets of macrophages packed with numerous acid-fast bacilli and few lymphocytes. These findings indicate lepromatous leprosy (multibacillary disease), which reflects weak Th1 CMI and a predominant Th2 humoral response (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) that fails to control intracellular organisms. Consequently, Patient Y is expected to have a negative lepromin test with little to no DTH at 48 to 72 hours.\n\nAn immediate wheal-and-flare within 30 minutes would represent a type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is not the mechanism tested by the lepromin assay. Thus, the most predictable outcome is that Patient X will be positive and Patient Y will be negative on the lepromin test at 48 to 72 hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2284729"}]}
