Before costly and time-consuming lab experiments are run, scientists can screen the entire set of proteins (the proteome) of a pathogen for short amino acid sequences that resemble a known human autoantigen. This exercise simulates this initial bioinformatic screening, allowing you to practice using a simplified scoring matrix to quantify sequence similarity and prioritize the most likely candidates for molecular mimicry.", "problem": "Immunologists are investigating a potential case of molecular mimicry, where an infection with a pathogenic bacterium is suspected of triggering an autoimmune response in a patient. A key human autoantigenic epitope, the part of the self-protein recognized by the immune system, has been identified as the 7-amino-acid peptide with the sequence `S-K-V-F-L-D-A`. The letters represent single-letter codes for amino acids.\n\nTo identify a potential triggering peptide from the bacterium, researchers have searched its proteome and found four candidate peptides of the same length. Your task is to determine which of these bacterial peptides is the most likely culprit by calculating a \"bio-similarity score\" between the human epitope and each bacterial candidate. The peptide with the highest score is considered the most probable cause of the molecular mimicry.\n\nThe bio-similarity score is calculated by summing the scores for each amino acid pair at each position (1 through 7) based on the following rules and amino acid groupings:\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n*   **Identity Match:** An identical amino acid at the same position (e.g., S vs. S) scores +5 points.\n*   **Conservative Substitution:** A non-identical amino acid from the same functional group scores +3 points.\n*   **Semi-Conservative Substitution:** A substitution between an amino acid from the 'Aliphatic' group and one from the 'Aromatic' group scores +1 point.\n*   **Non-Conservative Substitution:** Any other mismatch scores -10 points.\n\n**Amino Acid Functional Groups:**\n*   **Group 1 (Aliphatic):** G, A, V, L, I, P\n*   **Group 2 (Aromatic):** F, Y, W\n*   **Group 3 (Polar, uncharged):** S, T, C, M, N, Q\n*   **Group 4 (Acidic):** D, E\n*   **Group 5 (Basic):** K, R, H\n\n**Candidate Bacterial Peptides:**\nA. `S-K-V-F-Q-D-A`\n\nB. `T-R-I-Y-I-E-V`\n\nC. `S-H-A-Q-P-D-A`\n\nD. `Q-D-M-A-K-S-W`\n\nBased on this scoring system, which of the following bacterial peptides is the most likely candidate for molecular mimicry?", "solution": "The human autoantigenic peptide is S-K-V-F-L-D-A, whose residues belong to the following functional groups: S is Group 3 (polar, uncharged), K is Group 5 (basic), V is Group 1 (aliphatic), F is Group 2 (aromatic), L is Group 1 (aliphatic), D is Group 4 (acidic), and A is Group 1 (aliphatic).

A robust experiment must be able to definitively show that antibodies from a patient bind to both the pathogen's antigen and the body's own self-antigen. This practice challenges you to think like an experimental immunologist, focusing on the critical importance of designing an assay with the proper controls to distinguish true cross-reactivity from non-specific binding or other confounding factors.", "problem": "A clinical immunologist is investigating a case where a patient developed acute neurological symptoms following a severe gastrointestinal infection caused by the bacterium *Enterophilus mimicus*. The leading hypothesis is molecular mimicry, suggesting that antibodies produced against a bacterial protein are cross-reacting with a human protein in the nervous system. To test this, the lab has isolated the suspected bacterial surface protein, `Bac-P70`, and the structurally similar human neuronal protein, `Neuro-P71`. They also have serum samples from the patient (`Serum-PostInfection`) and from a healthy individual with no history of this infection or neurological condition (`Serum-Control`).\n\nThe proposed experimental technique is an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), a plate-based assay designed to detect and quantify substances such as antibodies. In an indirect ELISA, an antigen is immobilized on a surface, and then a primary antibody (from the serum) is added, which binds to the antigen. A secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme and recognizes the primary antibody is then added. Finally, a substrate is added that the enzyme can convert to a detectable signal (e.g., a color change).\n\nWhich of the following experimental setups represents the most complete and direct approach to test the molecular mimicry hypothesis?\n\nA. Coat ELISA plate wells with `Bac-P70`. Test for binding using `Serum-PostInfection`. A positive signal confirms the hypothesis.\n\nB. Coat two sets of ELISA plate wells, one with `Bac-P70` and the other with `Neuro-P71`. Test both sets for binding using `Serum-PostInfection`. A positive signal in both sets confirms the hypothesis.\n\nC. Coat two sets of ELISA plate wells, one with `Bac-P70` and the other with `Neuro-P71`. Test the `Bac-P70` wells with `Serum-PostInfection` and the `Neuro-P71` wells with `Serum-Control`. A positive signal in both tests confirms the hypothesis.\n\nD. Coat four sets of ELISA plate wells.\n    Set 1: `Bac-P70`, test with `Serum-PostInfection`.\n    Set 2: `Neuro-P71`, test with `Serum-PostInfection`.\n    Set 3: `Bac-P70`, test with `Serum-Control`.\n    Set 4: `Neuro-P71`, test with `Serum-Control`.\n    The hypothesis is supported if Sets 1 and 2 are positive, while Sets 3 and 4 are negative or have a significantly lower signal.\n\nE. Mix `Serum-PostInfection` with a high concentration of `Bac-P70` in a tube first. Then, add this mixture to ELISA plate wells coated with `Neuro-P71`. The hypothesis is supported if the signal is significantly reduced compared to a control where the serum was not pre-mixed with `Bac-P70`.", "solution": "Hypothesis to test: antibodies generated after infection with Enterophilus mimicus bind the bacterial antigen Bac-P70 and cross-react with the human neuronal antigen Neuro-P71. The most direct evidence for molecular mimicry requires demonstrating:\n- Specific binding of Serum-PostInfection to Bac-P70 (shows an anti-bacterial response).\n- Cross-reactive binding of Serum-PostInfection to Neuro-P71 (supports molecular mimicry).\n- Absence or significantly lower binding in Serum-Control to both Bac-P70 and Neuro-P71 (establishes specificity and rules out baseline or nonspecific reactivity).\n\nControls needed:\n- Antigen controls: both Bac-P70 and Neuro-P71 coated wells.\n- Serum controls: Serum-PostInfection and Serum-Control tested on both antigens.\n- Readout comparison: higher signal in patient serum vs control, particularly on Neuro-P71, supports cross-reactivity associated with disease.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A tests only Bac-P70 with patient serum; it establishes an anti-bacterial response but cannot establish cross-reactivity to the human protein. Insufficient.\n- B tests both antigens with patient serum; it suggests cross-reactivity if both are positive, but lacks controls with healthy serum to exclude nonspecific or common reactivity. Incomplete.\n- C mismatches sera to antigens and fails to test both sera across both antigens. It cannot distinguish nonspecific binding or background reactivity. Inadequate design.\n- D systematically tests both antigens with both sera, providing positive and negative controls and allowing direct comparison. Molecular mimicry is supported if Serum-PostInfection binds both antigens while Serum-Control is negative or significantly lower on both, especially Neuro-P71.\n- E is a competitive inhibition (blocking) assay showing that Bac-P70 can absorb antibodies that would otherwise bind Neuro-P71, which strongly supports shared epitopes. However, without the comprehensive baseline and control comparisons provided in D, it is not the most complete standalone approach. It is best as a follow-up to D.\n\nTherefore, D is the most complete and direct experimental setup to test the molecular mimicry hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2250568"}, {"introduction": "Molecular mimicry doesn't require a perfect match; even weak cross-reactivity can have significant consequences, particularly in diagnostics.
