This first practice invites you to think like a clinician by exploring how the formation of immune complexes consumes key components of the complement system. Understanding this principle of complement consumption is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring the activity of diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus. [@problem_id:2284541]", "problem": "A patient is evaluated in a rheumatology clinic with a constellation of symptoms including a skin rash, joint pain, and evidence of kidney dysfunction. These clinical findings are highly suggestive of an active systemic Type III hypersensitivity reaction, a condition mediated by the deposition of immune complexes (aggregates of antibodies and antigens) in various tissues. To help confirm this diagnosis and assess the activity of the disease, the physician orders a measurement of serum levels of two specific proteins from the complement system: C3 and C4.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the expected findings for C3 and C4 levels in this patient during an active phase of the disease and the underlying immunological mechanism?\n\nA. C3 and C4 levels are expected to be elevated, as they are acute-phase proteins whose synthesis is increased by the liver during systemic inflammation.\n\nB. C3 and C4 levels are expected to be decreased, as immune complexes are potent activators of the classical complement pathway, leading to the consumption of these components.\n\nC. C3 levels are expected to be decreased, but C4 levels are expected to be normal, because immune complexes primarily activate the alternative complement pathway, which bypasses C4.\n\nD. C3 and C4 levels are expected to be normal, as the primary mechanism for clearing immune complexes involves direct uptake by phagocytes, a process independent of the complement cascade.", "solution": "The clinical triad of rash, arthralgia, and renal involvement strongly suggests an active Type III hypersensitivity reaction driven by deposition of circulating immune complexes composed of antigen bound to IgG or IgM. Such immune complexes efficiently activate the classical complement pathway because the Fc regions of IgG or IgM in immune complexes are recognized by C1q. Binding of C1q to clustered Fc domains activates C1r and C1s, leading to cleavage of C4 to C4a and C4b and of C2 to C2a and C2b. C4b binds to nearby surfaces and associates with C2a to form the classical C3 convertase, denoted $C4b2a$. This convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b, propagating complement activation, opsonization, and inflammation.\n\nDuring an active immune complex–mediated disease, the persistent activation of the classical pathway leads to increased consumption of both C4 (cleaved early by C1s) and C3 (cleaved by $C4b2a$). As a result, serum levels of C3 and C4 decrease, and low C3 and C4 are used clinically as markers of disease activity in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus with active nephritis. Although some complement components can be acute-phase reactants synthesized by the liver, in active Type III hypersensitivity the rate of consumption by ongoing classical pathway activation typically exceeds the rate of synthesis, producing decreased levels.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because, despite hepatic synthesis, consumption during classical pathway activation lowers C3 and C4 in active immune complex disease.\n- Option B is correct because immune complexes activate the classical pathway, consuming C4 via C1s and C3 via the classical C3 convertase $C4b2a$, leading to decreased serum C3 and C4.\n- Option C is incorrect because the mechanistic trigger is classical (not alternative) pathway activation; thus C4 is also consumed and decreased.\n- Option D is incorrect because complement is integral to immune complex solubilization and clearance; it is not a complement-independent process, and complement consumption alters serum levels.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that both C3 and C4 are decreased due to consumption by immune complex–driven activation of the classical complement pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2284541"}, {"introduction": "Not all immune complexes are created equal; some are efficiently cleared by phagocytes, while others become pathogenic culprits lodged in our tissues. This exercise delves into a key biophysical factor—antibody affinity—that governs the nature of these complexes.

A simplified biophysical model posits that the molar ratio of antigen (Synthelin-G) to antibody (IgG), denoted as $R$, within the specific subset of immune complexes that are small enough to be deposited is inversely proportional to the antibody's affinity constant, $K_a$.
