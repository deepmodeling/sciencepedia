This exercise applies classical Mendelian genetics to a scenario involving a well-known risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis, the *HLA-DRB1* shared epitope. By calculating the probability of an offspring inheriting specific risk genotypes like RN, you will practice core genetic concepts and see how they directly inform our understanding of disease predisposition in a family context [@problem_id:2231727].", "problem": "The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system is a group of genes on chromosome 6 that encode proteins crucial for the adaptive immune system. Certain alleles of the *HLA-DRB1* gene, collectively known as the \"shared epitope\" alleles, are a major genetic risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease. For the purposes of this problem, we will categorize all *HLA-DRB1* alleles into two types: the risk-associated shared epitope alleles, denoted by *R*, and all non-risk alleles, denoted by *N*. An individual can therefore have one of three genotypes: RR, RN, or NN. The genes in the HLA complex are tightly linked and are inherited as a block.\n\nConsider a couple planning to have children. The prospective mother's genetic history is as follows: her own mother (the child's maternal grandmother) was homozygous for the risk allele (RR), and her father (the child's maternal grandfather) was homozygous for a non-risk allele (NN). The prospective father's genotype has been determined to be heterozygous (RN).\n\nFurthermore, it is known that in this family, there is a rare genetic interaction where an embryo with the homozygous RR genotype is non-viable and does not survive to birth. Given this information, what is the probability that a living child born to this couple will have the heterozygous RN genotype? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a living child of a specific couple will have the genotype RN, given a lethal RR genotype. We must first determine the genotypes of the parents and then calculate the conditional probability for the offspring.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the mother's genotype.**\nThe mother's parents are the child's maternal grandmother and grandfather.\n- The maternal grandmother's genotype is RR. She can only produce gametes containing the *R* allele.\n- The maternal grandfather's genotype is NN. He can only produce gametes containing the *N* allele.\nTherefore, the mother must have inherited one *R* allele from her mother and one *N* allele from her father. Her genotype is definitively RN.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible gametes from the mother and father.**\nBoth the mother and the father have the heterozygous genotype RN.\n- The mother (RN) can produce gametes with the *R* allele or the *N* allele. The probability for each is 0.5.\n- The father (RN) can also produce gametes with the *R* allele or the *N* allele. The probability for each is 0.5.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the expected genotypic frequencies in the offspring before considering viability.**\nWe can use a Punnett square to determine the probabilities of the offspring's genotypes.\n- Probability of RR genotype = (Prob. of *R* from mother) $\\times$ (Prob. of *R* from father) = $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.\n- Probability of RN genotype = (Prob. of *R* from mother $\\times$ Prob. of *N* from father) + (Prob. of *N* from mother $\\times$ Prob. of *R* from father) = $(0.5 \\times 0.5) + (0.5 \\times 0.5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50$.\n- Probability of NN genotype = (Prob. of *N* from mother) $\\times$ (Prob. of *N* from father) = $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.25 + 0.50 + 0.25 = 1.0$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition of the lethal RR genotype.**\nThe problem states that any embryo with the RR genotype is non-viable. This means we must consider the probabilities only for the set of viable offspring. The possible genotypes for a living child are RN and NN.\n\nThe probability of an embryo being viable is the sum of the probabilities of the non-lethal genotypes:\n$P(\\text{viable}) = P(RN) + P(NN) = 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the conditional probability for a living child.**\nWe are asked for the probability that a living child has the RN genotype. This is a conditional probability: $P(\\text{RN} | \\text{viable})$.\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$:\n$P(\\text{RN} | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(\\text{RN and viable})}{P(\\text{viable})}$\n\nThe event \"genotype is RN and is viable\" is the same as the event \"genotype is RN\", since RN is a viable genotype. Therefore, $P(\\text{RN and viable}) = P(\\text{RN}) = 0.50$.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is:\n$P(\\text{RN} | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{0.50}{0.75} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n**Step 6: Convert the final answer to the required format.**\nThe problem asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6666...$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.667$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.667}$$", "id": "2231727"}, {"introduction": "While inheritance patterns explain risk within a family, epidemiologists use statistical tools to quantify the impact of a genetic variant across an entire population.
