Understanding this outcome is the first step in grasping how the immune system avoids attacking its own healthy, but potentially antigen-displaying, tissues.", "problem": "A naive CD8+ T-cell, which has successfully completed its development in the thymus, circulates through the body. It encounters a skin cell that has been infected with a non-cytopathic virus. As a result of the infection, the skin cell is presenting a specific viral peptide for which the naive T-cell's receptor is specific. This peptide is displayed on the skin cell's Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, being a non-professional antigen-presenting cell, the skin cell does not express the co-stimulatory molecule B7 on its surface.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and direct immunological outcome for this naive T-cell upon this single encounter?\n\nA. The T-cell becomes activated, proliferates, and differentiates into a cytotoxic T lymphocyte capable of killing infected cells.\n\nB. The T-cell enters a state of anergy, rendering it functionally unresponsive to future encounters with the same antigen.\n\nC. The T-cell is completely unaffected by the interaction and continues to circulate in its naive state.\n\nD. The T-cell immediately undergoes apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to incomplete signaling.\n\nE. The T-cell switches its lineage and differentiates into a CD4+ helper T-cell.", "solution": "The activation of a naive CD8+ T-cell requires two signals:\n- Signal 1: Antigen-specific recognition via the T-cell receptor (TCR) engaging peptide presented on MHC class I on the stimulating cell.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulatory signaling, classically via CD28 on the T-cell binding B7 (CD80/CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell.\n\nProfessional antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) provide both signals. In contrast, non-professional cells, such as infected skin keratinocytes, present peptide on MHC class I but typically do not express B7.\n\nIn the described encounter:\n- Signal 1 is present: the naive CD8+ T-cell’s TCR recognizes its specific viral peptide on MHC class I.\n- Signal 2 is absent: the skin cell lacks B7.\n\nAccording to the two-signal model of T-cell activation, Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2 induces a tolerogenic outcome, classically anergy, characterized by functional unresponsiveness upon subsequent antigen encounter, rather than productive activation. This is the most immediate and direct consequence of this single encounter.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\n- A is incorrect because activation, proliferation, and differentiation of a naive CD8+ T-cell require co-stimulation and often additional help (e.g., licensed dendritic cells and CD4 help).\n- C is incorrect because TCR engagement without co-stimulation is not a neutral event; it actively induces unresponsiveness rather than leaving the T-cell unchanged.\n- D is incorrect because immediate apoptosis is not the canonical immediate outcome of Signal 1 without Signal 2; deletion is more associated with activation-induced pathways or repeated tolerogenic stimulation.\n- E is incorrect because lineage commitment to CD4 versus CD8 occurs in the thymus and does not switch in the periphery.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct outcome is induction of anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2271400"}, {"introduction": "To confirm the principles of T-cell anergy, immunologists use controlled in-vitro systems that mimic cellular interactions.

By analyzing the results of a two-stage culture, you will solidify your understanding of anergy not just as a failure to activate, but as a stable and lasting state of unresponsiveness.", "problem": "A researcher is studying the requirements for the activation of naive CD4+ T-lymphocytes (T-cells). The standard model for T-cell activation requires two distinct signals. Signal 1 is delivered through the T-cell Receptor (TCR) complex upon recognizing an antigen. Signal 2 is a co-stimulatory signal, typically provided by the interaction of the CD28 protein on the T-cell with its ligands on an antigen-presenting cell.\n\nIn an in-vitro experiment, the researcher coats the bottom of a cell culture well with a high concentration of antibodies that specifically bind to and cross-link the CD3 component of the TCR complex, thereby effectively delivering Signal 1. They then culture purified naive CD4+ T-cells in this well for 48 hours. No other antibodies or stimulating-cells are added to the culture.\n\nAfter this initial 48-hour period, the researcher collects the T-cells and transfers them to a new well. This new well is coated with both anti-CD3 antibodies (providing Signal 1) and anti-CD28 antibodies (providing Signal 2). The cells are cultured for another 72 hours.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the T-cells after the initial 48-hour culture and their subsequent response in the second culture?\n\nA. After the initial culture, the T-cells will enter a state of anergy. In the second culture, they will fail to proliferate or produce significant amounts of the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\nB. After the initial culture, the T-cells will become fully activated and begin to proliferate. In the second culture, they will continue this robust proliferation and cytokine production.\n\nC. After the initial culture, the T-cells will undergo widespread apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to incomplete signaling. Very few viable cells will be left to respond in the second culture.\n\nD. After the initial culture, the T-cells will remain in a naive, resting state as if they received no signal at all. In the second culture, they will become fully activated and proliferate normally.\n\nE. After the initial culture, the T-cells will differentiate into memory T-cells. In the second culture, they will mount a rapid and powerful secondary response, proliferating more quickly than a naive cell.", "solution": "The standard model of naive CD4+ T-cell activation requires two signals:\n- Signal 1: TCR engagement via CD3 after antigen recognition.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulation, typically via CD28 binding its ligands on antigen-presenting cells.\n\nPrinciple 1: If a naive T cell receives Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2, it enters a state of functional unresponsiveness termed anergy rather than undergoing full activation. Mechanistically, isolated TCR signaling activates pathways such as NFAT without adequate AP-1, inducing an anergy gene program (e.g., upregulation of E3 ligases such as Cbl-b and GRAIL), suppressing IL-2 production and proliferative capacity upon restimulation.\n\nApplication to the first culture: The cells are exposed to anti-CD3 alone for 48 hours. This provides Signal 1 without Signal 2. By Principle 1, naive CD4+ T cells become anergic under these conditions. They do not produce significant IL-2, do not upregulate full activation markers, and do not proliferate. While some cell death can occur due to cytokine deprivation, the hallmark and most specific consequence of isolated Signal 1 in naive T cells is anergy rather than widespread apoptosis.\n\nPrinciple 2: Once anergy is established, subsequent provision of co-stimulation typically does not reverse the anergic state; anergic T cells fail to proliferate and fail to produce IL-2 even when later given both Signal 1 and Signal 2.\n\nApplication to the second culture: After transfer to wells containing both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, anergized cells remain hyporesponsive. They fail to mount robust proliferation and fail to produce significant IL-2 despite the presence of co-stimulation, consistent with the stable anergic program induced during the first culture.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- Full activation and proliferation after the first culture (choice B) requires both signals initially; absent CD28 co-stimulation, this does not occur.\n- Widespread apoptosis (choice C) is not the canonical or most accurate outcome of isolated Signal 1 in naive CD4+ T cells; functional anergy is the classic result.\n- Remaining naive as if no signal occurred (choice D) is incorrect because Signal 1 alone induces a distinct anergic program, not a return to naivety.\n- Differentiation into memory cells (choice E) requires full activation and expansion; it does not occur after incomplete signaling.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the T cells enter anergy after the initial culture and fail to proliferate or produce significant IL-2 upon subsequent exposure to both signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2271449"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a scientific concept means you can not only interpret results but also design the experiments that generate them. This challenge [@problem_id:2271430] puts you in the role of an experimental immunologist tasked with proving that the absence of co-stimulation induces T-cell anergy. Evaluating the proposed experimental plans requires you to carefully consider the operational definition of anergy, including initial conditions, positive controls, and the crucial restimulation step.", "problem": "The activation of a naive T-lymphocyte requires two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 is provided when the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) binds a specific peptide antigen presented on a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the APC surface. Signal 2, a co-stimulatory signal, is typically provided when the CD28 protein on the T-cell surface binds to a B7 family molecule (e.g., CD80 or CD86) on the APC. If a T-cell receives Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2, it does not become activated but instead enters a state of unresponsiveness called anergy. An anergic T-cell is unable to mount a productive response even if it later encounters an APC providing both signals.\n\nA researcher aims to design an in-vitro experiment to demonstrate that the absence of CD28-B7 co-stimulation during initial antigen encounter specifically induces anergy in T-cells. The researcher has the following materials:\n1.  A pure population of naive CD4+ T-cells specific for a known peptide antigen 'X'. These cells express both the specific TCR and CD28.\n2.  A population of professional APCs that express the correct MHC class II molecules and B7 molecules. These APCs can be loaded with peptide X.\n3.  A population of genetically modified \"stimulator cells\" that express the same MHC class II molecules as the APCs and can be loaded with peptide X, but crucially, these cells *do not* express any B7 molecules.\n4.  A reliable assay to measure T-cell activation by quantifying the secretion of the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and corresponding expected outcomes would correctly and most completely demonstrate the induction of T-cell anergy due to the lack of co-stimulation?\n\nA. Co-culture the naive T-cells with the B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is that the T-cells will proliferate and produce high levels of IL-2, as TCR engagement is the primary driver of activation.\n\nB. The experiment is conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, the naive T-cells are co-cultured with the B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. As expected, no significant IL-2 production is observed. In Stage 2, these T-cells are recovered, washed, and then co-cultured with the same B7-deficient stimulator cells again. The expected outcome is that the T-cells will now produce a robust IL-2 response, having been primed in Stage 1.\n\nC. The experiment is conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, two parallel cultures are set up: (i) T-cells with professional APCs loaded with peptide X, and (ii) T-cells with B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is IL-2 production in culture (i) but not in culture (ii). In Stage 2, T-cells from culture (ii) are recovered, washed, and co-cultured with fresh professional APCs loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is that these T-cells will fail to produce significant IL-2.\n\nD. The experiment involves three parallel cultures: (i) T-cells alone, (ii) T-cells with professional APCs loaded with peptide X, and (iii) T-cells with B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is no IL-2 production in culture (i), high IL-2 in culture (ii), and no IL-2 in culture (iii). This difference between (ii) and (iii) is sufficient to prove anergy.\n\nE. The experiment is conducted by co-culturing the naive T-cells with professional APCs loaded with peptide X, but in the presence of a blocking antibody that binds to the TCR. The expected outcome is no IL-2 production. This demonstrates that Signal 1 is necessary, and its absence leads to non-responsiveness, which is equivalent to anergy.", "solution": "First principles:\n- Activation of naive T cells requires two signals: Signal 1 via TCR recognition of peptide-MHC and Signal 2 via co-stimulation (CD28 binding B7). \n- Absence of Signal 2 during initial antigen recognition leads to anergy, defined operationally as a durable state in which the T cell fails to respond (e.g., does not produce IL-2) upon subsequent encounters even when both Signal 1 and Signal 2 are provided.\n- Therefore, to demonstrate anergy specifically due to lack of co-stimulation, an experiment must: (i) expose naive T cells to antigen with Signal 1 but without Signal 2, (ii) show no activation initially, and crucially (iii) show hyporesponsiveness upon restimulation with professional APCs that provide both signals. Appropriate controls must show that naive T cells can respond when co-stimulation is present and that the assay and APCs are functional.\n\nLogical derivation of necessary experimental structure:\n1. Stage 1 exposure condition: Provide Signal 1 without Signal 2 to induce anergy. This is achieved by co-culturing naive antigen-specific T cells with B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. Prediction: minimal or no IL-2 during Stage 1.\n2. Positive control for Stage 1: Parallel culture with professional APCs loaded with peptide X (provide both signals) to verify that naive T cells and the IL-2 assay are functional. Prediction: robust IL-2 in this control.\n3. Stage 2 test for anergy: Recover T cells exposed in Stage 1 to the no co-stimulation condition, wash to remove confounders, then restimulate with fresh professional APCs that provide both signals. Definition of anergy predicts failure to produce IL-2 in this Stage 2 despite full co-stimulation.\n4. Optional but strengthening control: T cells from Stage 1 that did receive co-stimulation should remain responsive upon restimulation, but this is not strictly necessary if Stage 1 already shows the system is functional.\n\nEvaluation of options against the derived criteria:\n- Option A fails because it predicts high IL-2 with Signal 1 only; this contradicts the two-signal requirement and does not test anergy.\n- Option B fails because it predicts that prior exposure to Signal 1 without co-stimulation “primes” T cells to respond upon re-exposure to the same B7-deficient stimulator; this contradicts anergy and does not include a test with full co-stimulation in Stage 2.\n- Option C implements the required two-stage design with appropriate Stage 1 controls and a Stage 2 rechallenge using professional APCs. Expected outcomes match the definition of anergy: IL-2 in the professional APC culture but not in the B7-deficient culture in Stage 1; failure to produce IL-2 upon Stage 2 rechallenge with professional APCs for the T cells previously exposed without co-stimulation.\n- Option D shows only the immediate requirement for co-stimulation (no IL-2 with B7-deficient cells versus high IL-2 with professional APCs) but does not test for durable hyporesponsiveness upon rechallenge; thus it does not demonstrate anergy.\n- Option E tests necessity of Signal 1 by blocking the TCR but does not address the role of co-stimulation nor the durable unresponsive state; non-responsiveness here is not equivalent to anergy.\n\nConclusion: Only Option C both induces anergy by initial Signal 1 without Signal 2 and demonstrates its presence by subsequent failure to respond under full co-stimulatory conditions, with appropriate controls confirming system functionality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2271430"}]}
