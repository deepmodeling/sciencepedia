They are classified into four main subfamilies based on the spacing of their first two conserved N-terminal cysteine (C) residues. One such protein is Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), also known as RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted). What does the 'CC' designation in its name signify about the molecular structure of this protein?\n\nA. The first two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other.\n\nB. The first two cysteine residues are separated by a single amino acid.\n\nC. The first two cysteine residues are separated by three amino acids.\n\nD. The protein lacks one of the first two canonical cysteine residues.\n\nE. The C-terminus of the protein is cyclized.", "solution": "Chemokines are categorized by the spacing between the first two conserved N-terminal cysteine residues. The notation indicates this spacing:\n- $CC$: the first two cysteines are adjacent (no intervening amino acid).\n- $CXC$: the first two cysteines are separated by one amino acid.\n- $CX_{3}C$: the first two cysteines are separated by three amino acids.\n- $C$: one of the two canonical cysteines is missing.\n\nSince CCL5 is a $CC$ chemokine, the designation $CC$ signifies that its first two cysteine residues are adjacent. Therefore:\n- Option A is correct.\n- Option B describes $CXC$.\n- Option C describes $CX_{3}C$.\n- Option D describes the $C$ class.\n- Option E is unrelated to the cysteine spacing convention.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2230530"}, {"introduction": "The potent effects of cytokines necessitate multiple layers of regulation to prevent unwanted inflammation. This practice uses a hypothetical clinical scenario to explore the critical multi-step activation pathway of Interleukin-1 beta ($IL-1\\beta$), a key inflammatory mediator. By analyzing simulated experimental data, you will develop skills in scientific reasoning to deduce the molecular basis of an immunodeficiency, highlighting the importance of post-translational processing in cytokine function. [@problem_id:2230516]", "problem": "A research laboratory is studying a patient with a rare primary immunodeficiency. This patient exhibits a diminished inflammatory response and increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections. To investigate the cellular basis of this condition, macrophages are isolated from the patient and from a healthy control individual. Both sets of cells are stimulated in vitro with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of bacterial cell walls known to induce inflammation.\n\nThe results of the experiment are as follows:\n1.  Macrophages from both the patient and the healthy control show a significant increase in the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for the cytokine Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β).\n2.  Analysis of a cell lysate (the internal contents of the cells) reveals that macrophages from both individuals synthesize the full-length, 31 kDa inactive precursor protein, pro-IL-1β, in comparable amounts.\n3.  Analysis of the cell culture medium (the supernatant outside the cells) shows high concentrations of mature, 17 kDa active IL-1β secreted by the control macrophages, but virtually undetectable levels of mature IL-1β from the patient's macrophages.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following provides the most likely molecular explanation for the patient's immunodeficiency?\n\nA. A defect in the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway that prevents transcription of the IL-1β gene.\n\nB. A mutation in the gene for the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), rendering it unable to bind to its ligand.\n\nC. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding an enzyme responsible for post-translational cleavage of pro-IL-1β.\n\nD. A defect in the general protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes), preventing the translation of IL-1β mRNA.\n\nE. A mutation that impairs the transport of mRNA molecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.", "solution": "We are given three key experimental observations after LPS stimulation of macrophages from a patient and a healthy control:\n1) Both patient and control macrophages show increased IL-1beta mRNA. LPS signals via TLR4 to activate the NF-\\kappa B pathway, which induces transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes including IL-1beta. Because IL-1beta mRNA increases in both, the upstream signaling and transcriptional induction are intact. Therefore, a defect preventing transcription of the IL-1beta gene (option A) is ruled out.\n\n2) Both patient and control macrophages synthesize comparable amounts of the 31 kDa pro-IL-1beta precursor in cell lysates. This shows that mRNA export and translation are intact. Therefore, defects in general protein synthesis (option D) or impaired mRNA nuclear export (option E) are ruled out.\n\n3) In the supernatant, control macrophages secrete high levels of mature, 17 kDa IL-1beta, whereas the patient’s macrophages have virtually undetectable mature IL-1beta. The transition from the 31 kDa pro-IL-1beta to the 17 kDa active cytokine requires post-translational proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1, which is activated within the inflammasome (e.g., NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1). Failure to detect mature IL-1beta in the supernatant, despite normal pro-IL-1beta synthesis, indicates a defect in the processing step rather than in transcription or translation. Thus, the most likely cause is a loss-of-function mutation in the enzyme responsible for cleaving pro-IL-1beta (caspase-1) or a critical component required for its activation, which is best represented by option C.\n\nOption B (mutation in IL-1 receptor) would impair cellular responses to IL-1 but would not prevent the macrophage from processing and secreting IL-1beta; it does not explain the absence of mature IL-1beta in the supernatant.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular explanation is a loss-of-function mutation in the enzyme responsible for post-translational cleavage of pro-IL-1beta.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2230516"}, {"introduction": "Understanding cytokine biology extends beyond identifying pathways; it also involves quantifying them. The strength of a cell's response to a cytokine is not an all-or-nothing event but is finely tuned by the concentration of the cytokine and the number of available cell surface receptors.

The first is a wild-type (WT) line expressing a normal Erythropoietin (EPO) receptor. The second is a mutant line with a homozygous mutation in the gene encoding the EPO receptor. This mutation alters the highly conserved 'WSXWS' motif in the receptor's extracellular domain to 'ASAAA', which severely impairs the receptor's transport to the plasma membrane. Consequently, the density of functional EPO receptors on the surface of the mutant cells is only 4.50% of that on the WT cells. It is known that the mutation does not alter the ligand-binding affinity of the few receptors that do reach the cell surface.\n\nThe binding of EPO to its receptor is a reversible process that reaches equilibrium and can be described by a dissociation constant, $K_d = 150 \\text{ pM}$.
