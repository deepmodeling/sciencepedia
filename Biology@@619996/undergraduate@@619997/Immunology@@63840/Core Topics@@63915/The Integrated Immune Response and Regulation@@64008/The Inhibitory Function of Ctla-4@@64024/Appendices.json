{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice explores the fundamental inhibitory role of CTLA-4 by presenting a scenario where the protein is synthesized correctly but cannot reach its site of action on the cell surface. This thought experiment highlights the critical importance of proper protein trafficking and localization for immune regulation. By predicting the outcome of this specific genetic defect, you will solidify your understanding of CTLA-4 as a negative regulator, or \"brake,\" on T cell activation [@problem_id:2276941].", "problem": "T cell activation is a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response, requiring two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 is initiated when the T-cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell recognizes a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the APC. Signal 2, a crucial co-stimulatory signal, is primarily delivered through the binding of the CD28 protein on the T cell surface to its ligands, B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86), on the APC.\n\nTo prevent autoimmunity and maintain homeostasis, T cell responses are tightly controlled by inhibitory mechanisms. One of the most important regulators is the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). In a resting T cell, CTLA-4 is stored within intracellular vesicles. Following the initial activation of the T cell, these vesicles are mobilized, and CTLA-4 is expressed on the cell surface. On the surface, CTLA-4 competes with CD28 to bind the same B7 ligands on the APC, but it does so with a much higher affinity.\n\nImagine a patient with a specific genetic defect. This defect results in a mutation in the gene encoding the CTLA-4 protein. The mutation does not affect the B7-binding portion of the protein, nor its overall synthesis. However, it completely disrupts the protein's trafficking signal, making it impossible for CTLA-4 to be transported from the intracellular vesicles to the T cell's plasma membrane following activation. Assume all other proteins involved in T cell activation and regulation function normally.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected consequence for this patient's T cells when they encounter an APC presenting a specific antigen?\n\nA. T cells would fail to become activated, as CTLA-4 is an essential positive co-stimulatory molecule required for T cell activation.\n\nB. T cells would exhibit an exaggerated and prolonged state of activation and proliferation.\n\nC. T cell activation would proceed normally and terminate after the usual duration, as CTLA-4's inhibitory function is redundant and can be fully compensated for by other regulatory molecules.\n\nD. T cells would activate initially but would then immediately undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) because CTLA-4 provides a critical survival signal.\n\nE. T cells would become anergic (unresponsive) because the absence of CTLA-4 from the cell surface disrupts the formation of a stable immunological synapse.", "solution": "T cell activation requires two signals delivered by an antigen-presenting cell: Signal 1 through TCR recognition of peptide-MHC and Signal 2 through co-stimulation, primarily CD28 binding to B7-1/B7-2. In a normal response, initial activation induces CTLA-4 expression at the cell surface by mobilizing intracellular vesicles; CTLA-4 then competes with CD28 for B7 with higher affinity and delivers inhibitory signals that reduce IL-2 production, limit proliferation, and help terminate the response.\n\nIn the described mutation, CTLA-4 synthesis and B7-binding domain are intact, but the trafficking signal is disabled, so CTLA-4 cannot reach the plasma membrane after activation. Consequently:\n- The initial activation proceeds normally because Signal 1 (TCR-peptide-MHC) and Signal 2 (CD28-B7) are intact, and CTLA-4 is not required for activation.\n- The normal inhibitory checkpoint provided by CTLA-4 at the cell surface is absent, since CTLA-4 cannot compete with CD28 for B7 nor deliver inhibitory signaling.\n- Without CTLA-4-mediated inhibition, CD28 signaling persists more strongly and for longer, leading to increased IL-2 production, augmented proliferation, and delayed termination of the response.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because CTLA-4 is not a positive co-stimulator; it is inhibitory.\n- Option C is incorrect because CTLA-4 function is not redundant; its loss causes marked hyperactivation (as evidenced by CTLA-4 deficiency phenotypes).\n- Option D is incorrect because CTLA-4 does not provide a critical survival signal; its absence does not trigger immediate apoptosis.\n- Option E is incorrect because anergy results from absent co-stimulation (e.g., lack of CD28-B7), not from absence of CTLA-4; the immunological synapse can still form via TCR and CD28.\n\nThe most accurate consequence is exaggerated and prolonged T cell activation and proliferation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2276941"}, {"introduction": "Building on the general inhibitory function of CTLA-4, this exercise delves into one of its key mechanisms: competition for ligands. The scenario uses a hypothetical genetically engineered Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC) to isolate the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligand. This practice will challenge you to think critically about how molecular-level competition between the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 translates into a cellular-level outcome for T cell activation [@problem_id:2276964].", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the mechanisms of T cell regulation. In a laboratory experiment, they co-culture naive CD4+ T cells with professional Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) in the presence of a specific peptide antigen that the T cells recognize. The T cells express a normal T-cell receptor (TCR), a co-stimulatory receptor called CD28, and can upregulate an inhibitory receptor, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), upon activation.\n\nThe APCs in this experiment have been genetically modified. Their B7 family co-stimulatory molecule, CD80, has been altered such that it can still bind effectively to the T cell's CD28 receptor, but it has completely lost its ability to bind to the T cell's CTLA-4 receptor. For the purposes of this problem, assume that the APCs do not express any other co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory ligands (like CD86) that could interact with CD28 or CTLA-4.\n\nCompared to a control experiment using identical T cells but with wild-type APCs that possess normal CD80, what is the most likely outcome for T cell activation in the experiment with the modified APCs?\n\nA. No T cell activation will occur because the modified CD80 disrupts the immune synapse.\n\nB. T cell activation will be initiated, but the duration of the response will be significantly shorter.\n\nC. T cell activation and subsequent proliferation will be substantially enhanced and prolonged.\n\nD. The T cell activation profile will be identical to that of the control experiment.\n\nE. The T cells will fail to differentiate into effector cells and will become anergic.", "solution": "We analyze T cell activation as the integration of three classes of signals delivered at the immune synapse:\n- Signal 1: antigen-specific TCR engagement by peptide-MHC.\n- Signal 2: co-stimulation via CD28 binding to B7 family ligands (CD80/CD86) on APCs.\n- Inhibitory checkpoint: CTLA-4 upregulated after activation, binding B7 ligands with higher affinity than CD28 to deliver a dominant negative signal and outcompete CD28.\n\nDefine the net activation strength at time $t$ as\n$$\nA(t)=S_{1}(t)+S_{2}(t)-I(t),\n$$\nwhere $S_{1}(t)>0$ requires TCR-peptide-MHC engagement, $S_{2}(t)>0$ requires CD28-B7 interaction, and $I(t) \\ge 0$ arises from CTLA-4 engagement with its ligands on APCs.\n\nControl condition (wild-type APCs): APCs express normal CD80. Early after TCR engagement, $S_{1}(t)$ and $S_{2}(t)$ are present because CD28 binds CD80, initiating activation and proliferation. As activation proceeds, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds CD80 with higher affinity than CD28, generating $I(t)>0$ and competitively reducing CD28 engagement. Thus, in control,\n$$\nA_{\\text{control}}(t)=S_{1}(t)+S_{2}(t)-I_{\\text{control}}(t),\n$$\nwith $I_{\\text{control}}(t)>0$ once CTLA-4 is upregulated. This negative feedback attenuates and helps terminate the response, limiting amplitude and duration.\n\nModified APCs: CD80 retains binding to CD28 (so $S_{2}(t)$ is intact) but completely loses binding to CTLA-4. The problem specifies no other relevant ligands (no CD86), so CTLA-4 has no ligand on these APCs. Therefore,\n$$\nI_{\\text{modified}}(t)=0 \\quad \\text{for all } t.\n$$\nwhile $S_{1}(t)$ and $S_{2}(t)$ are unchanged relative to control because TCR-peptide-MHC and CD28-CD80 interactions are intact.
