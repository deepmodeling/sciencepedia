This practice problem explores the 'two-signal model,' a fundamental principle governing T-cell activation. By analyzing a hypothetical clinical scenario involving a drug that blocks costimulation, you will reinforce your understanding of how T-cells are rendered functionally unresponsive, or anergic, a key mechanism of peripheral tolerance. [@problem_id:2259655]", "problem": "A patient with a severe autoimmune disorder is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new therapeutic agent. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to the CD28 protein found on the surface of T-lymphocytes. This binding physically obstructs the interaction between CD28 on the T-cell and its corresponding B7 family ligands (e.g., CD80, CD86) expressed on the surface of Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). An APC is a specialized cell that processes and presents antigens to T-cells.\n\nDuring the course of treatment, the patient is exposed to a novel pathogen. Consider a single naive T-cell within this patient that has not previously encountered its specific antigen. This T-cell's T-cell Receptor (TCR) successfully recognizes and binds to its cognate peptide-antigen complex presented by an APC derived from this new pathogen.\n\nGiven the mechanism of the therapeutic agent, what is the most likely functional fate of this naive T-cell following this initial encounter with its antigen?\n\nA. Clonal expansion and differentiation into effector T-cells.\n\nB. Induction of a long-lived state of functional unresponsiveness.\n\nC. Immediate induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nD. Differentiation into a memory T-cell.\n\nE. Maturation into a regulatory T-cell that suppresses other immune responses.", "solution": "The activation of a naive T-cell requires two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC). First, the T-cell receptor must recognize and bind a specific peptide presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex on the APC (signal 1). Second, a costimulatory signal must be provided through the interaction of CD28 on the T-cell with B7 family ligands (CD80 or CD86) on the APC (signal 2). Both signals are necessary for full activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into effector cells.\n\nThe therapeutic agent in this scenario is a monoclonal antibody that binds CD28 on T-cells with high affinity, physically preventing its engagement with B7 ligands. Consequently, even though the TCR successfully recognizes its cognate antigen (signal 1 is present), the essential costimulatory signal via CD28 is absent due to the drug’s blockade (signal 2 is missing).\n\nIn naive T-cells, receipt of signal 1 in the absence of signal 2 most commonly induces a state of anergy, defined as long-lived functional unresponsiveness characterized by failure to produce interleukin-2 upon restimulation and impaired proliferative capacity. This is a central tenet of peripheral tolerance and is the canonical outcome of TCR engagement without costimulation in naive T-cells.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Clonal expansion and differentiation into effector T-cells require both signals and therefore will not occur without CD28 costimulation, excluding option A.\n- Immediate programmed cell death can occur under some conditions, but the most typical and primary outcome of signal 1 without signal 2 in naive T-cells is anergy rather than acute apoptosis, making option C less likely.\n- Differentiation into memory T-cells requires successful activation and clonal expansion, which are absent here, excluding option D.\n- Maturation into regulatory T-cells depends on specific cytokine and signaling milieus (e.g., transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-2) and is not the default consequence of absent costimulation; additionally, CD28 signals generally support Treg homeostasis rather than their default induction under costimulatory blockade, making option E inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely functional fate of the naive T-cell after this initial encounter is induction of a long-lived state of functional unresponsiveness (anergy).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2259655"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the passive induction of anergy, peripheral tolerance is actively maintained by specialized cells like regulatory T-cells (Tregs). This exercise delves into the specific molecular machinery Tregs use to suppress immune responses, focusing on the dual role of the CTLA-4 protein. By considering a precisely engineered mutation, you are challenged to dissect how CTLA-4 both outcompetes other signals and physically removes the molecules required for T-cell activation, providing a deeper insight into contact-dependent suppression. [@problem_id:2259687]", "problem": "In an immunological study, a genetically engineered mouse model is created to investigate the specific mechanisms of peripheral T-cell tolerance. These mice have Regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express a mutant form of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Normally, Treg-mediated suppression of Conventional T cells (Tconvs) relies on contact-dependent mechanisms involving CTLA-4. One key mechanism is that the high-affinity CTLA-4 on Tregs outcompetes the lower-affinity CD28 on Tconvs for binding to the costimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs), thereby inhibiting Tconv activation. A second critical mechanism involves the CTLA-4-mediated removal and internalization of CD80/CD86 from the surface of APCs by the Treg, a process known as trans-endocytosis, which depletes the APC of its ability to provide costimulation.\n\nThe specific mutation introduced into the CTLA-4 protein in this mouse model is located in its cytoplasmic tail. This mutation completely prevents the endocytosis (internalization) of the CTLA-4 molecule from the Treg cell surface, but it does not affect its surface expression level or its extracellular domain's ability to bind to CD80 and CD86.\n\nYou perform an in-vitro suppression assay where you co-culture Tconvs, APCs, and either wild-type Tregs or the mutant Tregs. Based on the known functions of CTLA-4, what is the most likely outcome regarding the contact-dependent suppressive capacity of the Tregs expressing the non-internalizing CTLA-4 compared to wild-type Tregs?\n\nA. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is completely abolished.\n\nB. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is significantly enhanced.\n\nC. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is partially reduced.\n\nD. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is unchanged.\n\nE. The mutant Tregs switch from a suppressive to an activating phenotype.", "solution": "We proceed by explicit consideration of the two established, contact-dependent CTLA-4–mediated suppressive mechanisms of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and how the stated mutation affects each mechanism.\n\n1) Mechanism 1: Competitive ligand binding. CTLA-4 on Tregs has higher affinity than CD28 on Conventional T cells (Tconvs) for the APC ligands CD80 and CD86. By binding these ligands, CTLA-4 outcompetes CD28 and thereby reduces costimulatory signaling to Tconvs. In the described mutant, the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 is intact and retains normal binding to CD80/CD86. The mutation does not reduce surface expression levels. Therefore, this competitive binding mechanism remains functional.\n\n2) Mechanism 2: Trans-endocytosis of CD80/CD86 from APCs. CTLA-4 on Tregs can remove CD80/CD86 from APC surfaces via trans-endocytosis, requiring the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail and its endocytic motifs for internalization. The mutation described is in the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail and completely prevents endocytosis. Consequently, the trans-endocytosis mechanism is specifically abolished.\n\n3) Predicted net effect on suppression. Since mechanism 1 (competition for ligands) remains intact while mechanism 2 (ligand removal via trans-endocytosis) is eliminated, the overall contact-dependent suppressive capacity is expected to be reduced relative to wild-type, but not abolished. The mutation does not enhance suppression because it does not increase binding affinity or surface levels beyond wild-type and removes a major suppressive pathway. It does not leave suppression unchanged because a key mechanism is lost. It does not convert Tregs to an activating phenotype because CTLA-4 still competes for ligands and does not deliver costimulatory signals.\n\n4) Mapping to options:\n- A (completely abolished): incorrect, because competitive binding remains.\n- B (significantly enhanced): incorrect, no gain-of-function; one mechanism is lost.\n- C (partially reduced): correct, one mechanism intact, one lost.\n- D (unchanged): incorrect, loss of trans-endocytosis reduces suppression.\n- E (switch to activating): incorrect, CTLA-4 does not mediate activation and competition persists.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a partial reduction in contact-dependent suppressive capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2259687"}, {"introduction": "Immune tolerance is not a static state but a dynamic balance that can be influenced by the surrounding microenvironment. This problem addresses the critical concept of T-cell plasticity, specifically the stability of the regulatory T-cell lineage which depends on the master transcription factor Foxp3. This scenario prompts you to consider the consequences when a suppressor cell loses its identity in an inflammatory setting, highlighting how the guardians of tolerance can themselves be converted into contributors to disease. [@problem_id:2259661]", "problem": "In the context of peripheral immune tolerance, Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in preventing autoimmunity by suppressing the activation and proliferation of self-reactive conventional T cells. The function and lineage stability of these Tregs are critically dependent on the sustained expression of the master transcription factor, Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). However, under certain conditions, particularly within a highly inflammatory microenvironment, a previously committed `$Foxp3^+$` Treg cell can lose its Foxp3 expression. This phenomenon is referred to as Treg instability.\n\nConsidering the principles of T cell plasticity and differentiation, what is the most likely functional fate of such an \"ex-Treg\" cell that has lost Foxp3 expression within an inflammatory site rich in cytokines like Interleukin-6 (IL-6)?\n\nA. The cell undergoes immediate apoptosis due to the loss of its lineage-defining transcription factor.\n\nB. The cell becomes anergic, entering a state of permanent unresponsiveness to antigenic stimulation.\n\nC. The cell redifferentiates into a pro-inflammatory T helper 17 ($T_{H}17$) cell, contributing to tissue inflammation.\n\nD. The cell reverts to a naive T cell state, awaiting a new primary activation signal.\n\nE. The cell becomes a memory Treg, capable of more rapid Foxp3 re-expression upon a secondary encounter with self-antigen.", "solution": "Regulatory T cell lineage identity and suppressive function require sustained expression of the master transcription factor Foxp3. Loss of Foxp3 expression abrogates the transcriptional program that enforces Treg suppressive function and lineage stability.\n\nWithin an inflammatory microenvironment, cytokines such as IL-6 activate STAT3 signaling and antagonize Foxp3 stability, while promoting expression of the Th17-lineage transcription factor ROR$\\gamma$t. Canonical T cell differentiation principles indicate that TGF-β together with IL-6 drives Th17 differentiation, and Foxp3 directly antagonizes ROR$\\gamma$t. Thus, when Foxp3 is lost in the presence of IL-6, the balance shifts toward the Th17 program.\n\nT cell plasticity studies have shown that “ex-Tregs” (former Foxp3-expressing cells) can reprogram into effector phenotypes, particularly Th17-like cells, producing IL-17 and contributing to tissue inflammation. Therefore, the most likely functional fate of a Foxp3-lost Treg in an IL-6-rich inflammatory site is redifferentiation into a pro-inflammatory Th17 cell.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- Immediate apoptosis is not obligatorily triggered by loss of Foxp3; survival can persist under inflammatory cues.\n- Anergy is unlikely because IL-6 and co-stimulation promote effector differentiation rather than unresponsiveness.\n- Reversion to a naive state does not occur after prior activation and differentiation.\n- A “memory Treg” state presupposes maintained or rapidly restorable Foxp3, which is contradicted by the stated Foxp3 loss in an IL-6-rich setting.\n\nHence, the correct choice is redifferentiation to Th17.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2259661"}]}
