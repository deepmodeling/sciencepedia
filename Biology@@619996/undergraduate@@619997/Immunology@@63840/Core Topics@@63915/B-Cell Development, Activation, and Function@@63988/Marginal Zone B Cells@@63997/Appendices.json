IgA\n\nB. IgD\n\nC. IgE\n\nD. IgG\n\nE. IgM", "solution": "The encapsulated bacterium presents a polysaccharide capsule that is a T-independent type 2 antigen, characterized by highly repetitive epitopes that can extensively cross-link B cell receptors. In blood-borne infections, the initial rapid humoral response occurs in the spleen, particularly within the marginal zone, where marginal zone B cells are specialized to respond to such T-independent antigens.\n\nActivation of marginal zone B cells by T-independent antigens occurs without cognate T cell help. Class-switch recombination requires signals provided by T helper cells, specifically CD40–CD40L interactions and cytokines. In the absence of these T cell–derived signals, activated B cells predominantly secrete the default isotype, which is IgM. Furthermore, T-independent responses typically do not involve germinal center formation or extensive somatic hypermutation, reinforcing the predominance of IgM in the primary response.\n\nConsidering the isotypes:\n- IgA is associated with mucosal immunity and usually arises after class switching driven by cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta, which requires T cell help.\n- IgD is primarily membrane-bound on naive B cells and is not a principal secreted isotype in primary responses.\n- IgE production is driven by T helper 2 cytokines, notably interleukin 4, and is associated with allergic and helminth responses, requiring T cell help.\n- IgG generally results from class switching within germinal centers, which is characteristic of T-dependent responses.\n- IgM is the default secreted isotype in T-independent primary responses by marginal zone B cells.\n\nTherefore, the principal class of antibody secreted by marginal zone B cells in this primary T-independent response to a polysaccharide capsule is IgM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2247351"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of the immune system is the intricate collaboration between different cell types.

SIGN-R1 on splenic marginal zone macrophages binds and traps polysaccharide-rich antigens (e.g., bacterial capsular polysaccharides) and presents them to MZ B cells. This macrophage–MZ B collaboration is crucial for initiating rapid T-independent type 2 (TI-2) responses, characterized by early production of low-affinity, mostly IgM antibodies without germinal center reactions.\n\nInfer the immediate functional consequence of blocking this interaction: By preventing efficient antigen trapping and delivery by SIGN-R1 macrophages to MZ B cells, the activation of MZ B cells by polysaccharide antigens is directly impaired. This leads to an attenuated early TI-2 response, specifically diminished rapid production of pathogen-specific IgM within the first 24–48 hours of infection.\n\nPredict implications for host defense against encapsulated bacteria: Encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae) rely on their polysaccharide capsules to evade phagocytosis. Early IgM (and complement fixation via the classical pathway) is crucial to opsonize these organisms in the bloodstream, limiting bacteremia. Impaired early IgM thus increases susceptibility to uncontrolled bacteremia and sepsis.\n\nEvaluate each proposed outcome:\n- I. Severely attenuated production of pathogen-specific IgM within the first 48 hours of infection: True. This is the hallmark deficit of impaired MZ macrophage–MZ B collaboration in TI-2 responses.\n- II. A primary defect in the generation of high-affinity, class-switched IgG antibodies within splenic germinal centers: False. High-affinity class-switched IgG arises from T cell–dependent germinal center responses to protein antigens with follicular dendritic cell antigen display and T follicular helper cell help. The drug does not target these processes and does not globally impair T cell help or follicular dendritic cell function.\n- III. Reduced efficiency in trapping and presenting bacterial capsular polysaccharide antigens to marginal zone B cells: True. This is the direct effect of blocking SIGN-R1-mediated capture and handoff to MZ B cells.\n- IV. A global impairment of T-cell dependent immune responses to the bacterium's protein antigens: False. The drug specifically affects the MZ macrophage–MZ B cell interaction; T cell–dependent pathways remain intact.\n- V. Increased host susceptibility to uncontrolled bacteremia and sepsis: True. Due to impaired early IgM-mediated opsonization of encapsulated bacteria in the bloodstream.\n- VI.

This problem moves beyond theoretical knowledge to the practicalities of experimental design, asking you to think like an immunologist. You are tasked with devising an experiment to definitively separate the functions of Marginal Zone B cells and B-1b cells, two key players in T-cell independent immunity.

Two B cell populations are hypothesized to be the primary contributors: Marginal Zone (MZ) B cells, which reside in the spleen and are poised for rapid activation, and B-1b cells, a subset of B-1 cells known to respond to polysaccharide antigens.\n\nTo definitively determine the relative contributions of these two cell types, the immunologist has access to the following resources:\n1.  Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with a normal immune system.\n2.  $Rag1^{-/-}$ mice, which lack mature B and T lymphocytes due to a defect in V(D)J recombination.\n3.  `Xid` mice, which carry a mutation in the *Btk* gene, leading to a severe deficiency in the B-1b cell population while largely preserving the MZ B cell compartment.\n4.  $Cr2^{-/-}$ mice, which lack the complement receptors CD21/CD35, resulting in a failure to develop a proper splenic marginal zone and a profound lack of MZ B cells, but with an intact B-1b cell population.\n5.  Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technology to isolate highly purified cell populations from donor mice.\n6.  The ability to perform adoptive transfer experiments, intravenously injecting isolated cells into recipient mice.\n\nThe goal is to measure the serum levels of *S. pneumoniae* polysaccharide-specific IgM antibodies 5 days after intravenous infection. Which of the following experimental designs would most definitively parse the individual capacities of MZ B cells and B-1b cells to produce this specific IgM response?\n\nA. Create three groups of $Rag1^{-/-}$ recipient mice. Group 1 receives an adoptive transfer of purified MZ B cells from WT donors. Group 2 receives an adoptive transfer of purified B-1b cells from WT donors. Group 3 receives a sham injection with no cells. Infect all three groups and compare their specific IgM levels.\n\nB.

Adoptively transfer highly purified MZ B cells or highly purified B-1b cells from wild-type donors into $Rag1^{-/-}$ recipients, with a sham control. $Rag1^{-/-}$ mice provide a lymphocyte-null background (no mature B or T cells), so any observed antigen-specific IgM after infection must derive from the transferred subset. Using FACS-purified populations removes contamination by other B cell subsets. The sham group controls for background. Measuring serum polysaccharide-specific IgM at day 5 then directly compares the autonomous capacity of each subset to mount the response. This design most cleanly parses the individual capacities of MZ B cells versus B-1b cells.\n\nB. Compare unmanipulated wild-type, Xid, and $Cr2^{-/-}$ mice. This is confounded: Xid (Btk-deficient) broadly impairs BCR signaling, affects B-1 subsets and can alter functions of other B cells, not only depleting B-1b; $Cr2^{-/-}$ eliminates CD21/CD35, disrupting complement-mediated antigen capture and co-receptor signaling in all B cells and ablates the marginal zone structure, introducing systemic defects beyond mere absence of MZ B cells. Differences in IgM responses cannot be attributed strictly to the intrinsic capacities of MZ versus B-1b cells.\n\nC. Deplete $CD4^+$ T cells in wild-type mice. Because the response is T-independent, this manipulation does not isolate MZ versus B-1b contributions and cannot parse their relative capacities.\n\nD. Transfer total splenocytes from Xid (B-1b-deficient) or $Cr2^{-/-}$ (MZ-deficient) donors into $Rag1^{-/-}$ recipients. This mixes multiple cell types, including T cells, and introduces donor-genotype intrinsic signaling defects (Btk deficiency in Xid; CD21/CD35 deficiency in $Cr2^{-/-}$) that affect B cell activation independent of subset identity. Moreover, B-1b cells are underrepresented in spleen compared to peritoneal cavity, so total splenocyte transfer underestimates B-1b contribution. This is not definitive.\n\nE. Transfer purified follicular B-2 cells into $Rag1^{-/-}$ recipients. This tests a subset not hypothesized to be primary for the T-independent polysaccharide response and does not parse MZ versus B-1b contributions.\n\nTherefore, the design that most definitively parses the individual capacities of MZ B cells and B-1b cells to produce the specific IgM response is the adoptive transfer of each purified subset separately into lymphocyte-deficient $Rag1^{-/-}$ recipients with an appropriate sham control, followed by infection and measurement of antigen-specific IgM at day 5, i.e., option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2247332"}]}
