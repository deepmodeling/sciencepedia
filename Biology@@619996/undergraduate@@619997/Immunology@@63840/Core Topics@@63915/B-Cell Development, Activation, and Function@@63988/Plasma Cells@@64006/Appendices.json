By analyzing the unique expression pattern of the B cell marker CD19 and the plasma cell marker CD138, you will learn the classic signature used to identify mature plasma cells in a laboratory or clinical setting. [@problem_id:2261083]", "problem": "An immunologist is conducting a study on humoral immunity by analyzing a cell sample purified from a patient's bone marrow. The goal is to specifically identify and quantify the population of terminally differentiated, mature plasma cells. The analysis is performed using a technique called flow cytometry, where cells are stained with fluorescently-labeled antibodies that bind to specific surface proteins.\n\nFor this experiment, two antibodies are used:\n1.  An antibody that targets Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19), a protein that plays a critical role in B-lymphocyte development and activation.\n2.  An antibody that targets Cluster of Differentiation 138 (CD138), also known as syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan.\n\nBased on the established expression patterns of these proteins during B-lymphocyte differentiation, how would a mature, long-lived, antibody-secreting plasma cell be characterized in this two-color flow cytometry experiment?\n\nA. High expression of CD19 and high expression of CD138\n\nB. High expression of CD19 and low-to-negative expression of CD138\n\nC. Low-to-negative expression of CD19 and high expression of CD138\n\nD. Low-to-negative expression of both CD19 and CD138\n\nE. Intermediate expression of both CD19 and CD138", "solution": "In B-lymphocyte differentiation, CD19 is a canonical B-lineage marker expressed from early B-cell stages through mature naive and memory B cells. During terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells, CD19 is downregulated. In contrast, CD138 (syndecan-1) is upregulated as cells become plasmablasts and plasma cells, and high CD138 expression is characteristic of mature plasma cells. Long-lived, terminally differentiated plasma cells in the bone marrow therefore display low-to-negative CD19 and high CD138. Evaluating the options, only option C matches the phenotype of mature, long-lived plasma cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2261083"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying plasma cells, it is crucial to understand their functional importance within the immune system. A powerful way to explore this is through a thought experiment: what would happen if the body could not produce these cells? This exercise presents a hypothetical immunodeficiency that precisely blocks the final differentiation step into plasma cells, allowing you to deduce their indispensable role as the primary source of secreted antibodies for humoral immunity. [@problem_id:2261100]", "problem": "A medical student is studying a rare form of immunodeficiency. The patient presents with recurrent bacterial infections. Laboratory analysis reveals a normal count of circulating B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. Further genetic testing identifies a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a critical transcription factor. This transcription factor is exclusively required for the terminal differentiation of an activated B-lymphocyte into a mature, antibody-secreting plasma cell. All preceding steps, including B-cell development in the bone marrow, antigen recognition, B-cell activation, and proliferation within germinal centers, are unimpaired.\n\nBased on this specific molecular defect, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the patient's serum immunoglobulin profile?\n\nA. Markedly increased levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes due to compensatory B-cell proliferation.\n\nB. A selective and complete absence of the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype, while all other isotypes are present at normal levels.\n\nC. A profound reduction in the concentration of all major immunoglobulin isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA, etc.).\n\nD. The complete absence of circulating B-lymphocytes, as they cannot complete their maturation.\n\nE. Normal levels of the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype, but a complete absence of all class-switched isotypes like IgG and IgA.", "solution": "The mutation removes function of a transcription factor that is exclusively required for the terminal differentiation of activated B lymphocytes into antibody-secreting plasma cells (for example, factors such as BLIMP-1/PRDM1 and XBP1 are essential for plasma cell fate and the secretory program). All upstream processes—B-cell development, antigen recognition, activation, proliferation, and germinal center reactions—remain intact.\n\nKey immunologic principle: Serum immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells. Non-plasma B cells (naive or memory) primarily express membrane-bound immunoglobulin as B-cell receptors and do not secrete significant antibody. Therefore, if plasma cell differentiation is blocked, secretion of all isotypes is profoundly reduced, including IgM. Class switching can still occur in germinal centers, but without plasma cell differentiation, neither IgM nor class-switched isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgE) will be produced in normal amounts.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: compensatory proliferation does not replace the absence of plasma cell-driven secretion; increased B-cell numbers do not equate to increased serum immunoglobulins.\n- B is incorrect: the defect is not selective for IgG; secretion of all isotypes requires plasma cells.\n- C is correct: all major isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA, etc.) are profoundly reduced due to absent plasma cell secretion.\n- D is incorrect: B-cell counts are normal per the stem; development and circulation of B cells are intact.\n- E is incorrect: even IgM secretion requires plasma cell differentiation; thus IgM would also be reduced, not normal.\n\nTherefore, the expected serum immunoglobulin profile is a profound reduction across all isotypes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2261100"}, {"introduction": "The collective action of millions of individual plasma cells establishes a protective \"humoral shield\" of antibodies.
