{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Class Switch Recombination (CSR) is not just a theoretical concept; it involves a tangible, physical alteration of the B cell's DNA. This exercise uses a classic molecular biology technique, the Southern blot, to help you visualize the genetic evidence of CSR. By comparing the DNA of an unswitched naive B cell to a switched plasma cell, you can directly infer the fate of the original constant region gene, $C_{\\mu}$, after a B cell commits to producing a different antibody isotype like IgG [@problem_id:2221888].", "id": "2221888", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the molecular changes that occur during B cell maturation. The immunologist isolates genomic DNA from two distinct populations of mouse B-lineage cells:\n1.  A pure population of naive B cells, which have completed V(D)J recombination but have not yet been activated by an antigen. These cells express IgM on their surface.\n2.  A pure population of plasma cells actively secreting Immunoglobulin G (IgG). These cells are terminally differentiated and originated from B cells that underwent Class Switch Recombination (CSR).\n\nThe immunologist digests the DNA from each cell population with the same restriction enzyme. The resulting DNA fragments are separated by size via gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and analyzed using a Southern blot. The probe used for the blot is a small, radioactively-labeled DNA segment that is specifically complementary to the coding sequence of the constant region gene for the mu heavy chain ($C_{\\mu}$).\n\nAssuming the restriction enzyme does not cut within the $C_{\\mu}$ gene itself or the probe sequence, which of the following outcomes is expected on the resulting Southern blot?\n\nA. A single band of the same size and intensity will be observed for both the naive B cell DNA and the IgG-secreting plasma cell DNA.\nB. A single band will be observed for the naive B cell DNA, but no band will be observed for the IgG-secreting plasma cell DNA.\nC. No band will be observed for the naive B cell DNA, but a single band will be observed for the IgG-secreting plasma cell DNA.\nD. A single band will be observed for both samples, but the band for the IgG-secreting plasma cell DNA will correspond to a smaller DNA fragment than the band for the naive B cell DNA.\nE. A single band will be observed for the naive B cell DNA, and multiple bands will be observed for the IgG-secreting plasma cell DNA.\n\n", "solution": "The Southern blot detects genomic DNA fragments that contain sequences complementary to the probe. The probe here is specific for the coding sequence of the mu heavy chain constant region, $C_{\\mu}$. The restriction enzyme is specified not to cut within $C_{\\mu}$ or within the probe sequence, so any fragment that contains $C_{\\mu}$ will transfer intact and be detectable as a single band at a characteristic size determined by the flanking restriction sites.\n\nIn naive B cells:\n- These cells have undergone V(D)J recombination but have not undergone class switch recombination (CSR). Their productive heavy-chain allele uses $C_{\\mu}$, and the $C_{\\mu}$ exons are intact in the genomic locus.\n- Therefore, at least one allele contains $C_{\\mu}$, so the probe will hybridize and yield a single band corresponding to the fragment that contains $C_{\\mu}$.\n\nIn IgG-secreting plasma cells:\n- CSR recombines the switch regions $S_{\\mu}$ and $S_{\\gamma}$ on the expressed heavy-chain allele, deleting the intervening DNA. This deletion physically removes the $C_{\\mu}$ exons from the productive alleleâ€™s genomic DNA.\n- Consequently, on the expressed allele, there is no sequence complementary to the $C_{\\mu}$ probe, and no band from that allele can be detected.\n- While in many cells the nonproductive allele can retain $C_{\\mu}$, the classic analytical expectation for detecting CSR at the population level using a $C_{\\mu}$ probe is loss of the $C_{\\mu}$ band in switched cells, because the allele that underwent CSR lacks $C_{\\mu}$.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect because IgG-switched plasma cells lack $C_{\\mu}$ on the expressed allele, so the same size and intensity band as naive B cells is not expected.\n- B is the expected outcome: naive B cell DNA yields a single $C_{\\mu}$ band; IgG plasma cell DNA, having deleted $C_{\\mu}$ by CSR on the expressed allele, yields no $C_{\\mu}$ band under the standard expectation for detecting CSR by Southern blot.\n- C is impossible because naive B cells must have $C_{\\mu}$ intact.\n- D is incorrect because the switched allele lacks $C_{\\mu}$ entirely; there is no smaller $C_{\\mu}$-containing fragment to detect.\n- E is incorrect because probing for $C_{\\mu}$ does not yield multiple bands in the IgG-switched population under the stated conditions.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is a band in naive B cell DNA and no band in IgG plasma cell DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Building on the understanding that CSR involves the physical deletion of genetic material, this practice explores a critical consequence: its irreversibility. The immunoglobulin heavy chain genes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome, and CSR proceeds by deleting the intervening DNA. This thought experiment challenges you to predict the fate of a B cell that has already switched to a downstream isotype (IgA) when it encounters signals to switch to an upstream one (IgG), reinforcing the directional nature of this process [@problem_id:2221873].", "id": "2221873", "problem": "A researcher isolates a pure clonal population of mature B lymphocytes from a laboratory mouse. Through initial analysis, this B cell clone is confirmed to have already undergone class switch recombination and is exclusively producing Immunoglobulin A (IgA). The researcher then cultures these IgA-producing B cells in a medium containing a high concentration of Interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$), a cytokine known to be a potent inducer for B cells to switch to producing the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) class. Assume the culture conditions are otherwise optimal for B cell survival and proliferation.\n\nAfter several days in this culture, which of the following outcomes is expected for the vast majority of the B cells in the culture?\n\nA. The B cells will cease producing IgA and switch to producing IgG.\nB. The B cells will continue to produce IgA and will not produce IgG.\nC. The B cells will revert to producing their original Immunoglobulin M (IgM).\nD. The B cells will cease all immunoglobulin production and become memory cells.\nE. The B cells will begin to co-express both IgA and IgG on their surface.\n\n", "solution": "We begin by recalling the mechanism of class switch recombination (CSR). CSR is a deletional recombination process between switch regions $S_{X}$ that are located upstream of each constant region gene $C_{X}$ (except $C_{\\delta}$). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) introduces lesions that lead to recombination between a donor switch region (e.g., $S_{\\mu}$ or the switch region of the currently expressed isotype) and an acceptor switch region upstream of a downstream constant gene. The intervening DNA between the recombined switch regions is excised as a circular DNA fragment and is lost. Therefore, CSR is irreversible and directional: once a cell switches to a downstream isotype, it cannot revert to upstream constant regions, and it cannot co-express different heavy-chain isotypes (except the special case of IgM and IgD co-expression via alternative splicing in naive B cells prior to CSR).\n\nThe B cell clone in this problem has already undergone CSR to IgA. In the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, $C_{\\alpha}$ (IgA) is the most 3' or downstream constant region relative to all IgG constant regions (all $C_{\\gamma}$ subclasses lie upstream of $C_{\\alpha}$). Consequently:\n- Switching from IgA to any IgG would require recombination to an upstream $C_{\\gamma}$, which is impossible because the upstream segments were deleted during the prior CSR to IgA.\n- Reversion to IgM (choice C) is also impossible for the same reason: the $C_{\\mu}$ region and intervening DNA have been excised.\n- Co-expression of IgA and IgG (choice E) does not occur after CSR because only one heavy-chain constant region remains in the recombined locus; co-expression by alternative splicing applies only to IgM and IgD before CSR.\n- Ceasing all immunoglobulin production to become memory cells (choice D) is not an effect induced by IFN-$\\gamma$ under otherwise optimal culture conditions for survival and proliferation; moreover, the stem asks for the expected outcome for the vast majority of cells, which would not uniformly undergo such a fate.\n\nAlthough IFN-$\\gamma$ is a potent inducer directing CSR toward IgG in B cells that have not yet switched beyond the relevant $C_{\\gamma}$ regions, it cannot override the irreversibility of CSR in cells already switched to IgA in the mouse. Therefore, despite high IFN-$\\gamma$, these IgA-switched B cells will maintain IgA production and will not produce IgG.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is that the vast majority of the cells continue to produce IgA and do not produce IgG.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "How does a B cell 'choose' which isotype to switch to? This process is tightly regulated and depends on specific DNA sequences known as switch ($S$) regions that precede each constant region gene. This practice presents a hypothetical genetic knockout scenario where a specific switch region, $S_{\\alpha}$, is removed. By analyzing the consequences of this deletion, you will solidify your understanding of how these $S$ regions act as essential targeting signals that direct the recombination machinery to the correct genetic location for a given isotype switch [@problem_id:2221868].", "id": "2221868", "problem": "A researcher is studying the mechanism of Class Switch Recombination (CSR), the process by which B cells change the class of antibody they produce. To do this, they generate a specific knockout mouse line that has a targeted deletion of the switch region ($S\\alpha$) located upstream of the constant heavy chain alpha gene ($C\\alpha$). All other genetic components required for B cell development and function are intact, including the gene for Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) and the switch regions for other immunoglobulin isotypes (e.g., $S\\gamma$ for IgG, $S\\epsilon$ for IgE).\n\nThe knockout mice are challenged with an oral attenuated bacterium, which is known to elicit a strong mucosal immune response. Several days later, B cells are isolated from the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (Peyer's patches). Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the profile of immunoglobulin isotypes that these B cells will be capable of producing?\n\nA. The B cells will produce only IgM and will be unable to switch to any other isotype.\nB. The B cells will be unable to produce IgA, but will retain the ability to produce IgM and to switch to other isotypes like IgG.\nC. The B cells will show a complete failure of antibody production as V(D)J recombination will be inhibited.\nD. The B cells will be able to produce all immunoglobulin isotypes, including IgA, at normal levels.\nE. The B cells will exclusively produce IgA, with a complete absence of IgM and IgG.\n\n", "solution": "1. State the relevant mechanism. Class switch recombination (CSR) replaces the constant heavy chain region downstream of an already V(D)J-recombined variable region. Mechanistically, Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) introduces lesions in switch (S) regions, leading to double-strand breaks that are resolved by recombination between the donor $S\\mu$ and a chosen downstream acceptor switch region (e.g., $S\\gamma$, $S\\alpha$, $S\\epsilon$). The outcome is deletion of the intervening DNA and juxtaposition of the V(D)J exon to a new constant region (e.g., $C\\gamma$, $C\\alpha$, $C\\epsilon$), thereby changing isotype without altering antigen specificity.\n\n2. Identify what is deleted. The knockout specifically deletes the $S\\alpha$ region upstream of $C\\alpha$. All other components, including AID, $S\\gamma$, and $S\\epsilon$, remain intact.\n\n3. Apply the CSR requirement for IgA. To produce IgA, CSR must join $S\\mu$ (or another upstream S region) to $S\\alpha$, which positions the V(D)J exon upstream of $C\\alpha$. In symbolic terms, IgA CSR requires the recombination event $S\\mu \\to S\\alpha$. If $S\\alpha$ is deleted, this recombination cannot occur, so the $C\\alpha$ constant region cannot be expressed via CSR.\n\n4. Assess impact on other isotypes. Because $S\\gamma$ and $S\\epsilon$ are intact, recombination events such as $S\\mu \\to S\\gamma$ (for IgG) and $S\\mu \\to S\\epsilon$ (for IgE) remain possible. Therefore, switching to IgG and IgE is preserved.\n\n5. Assess impact on IgM and V(D)J recombination. IgM production does not require CSR; naive B cells express $C\\mu$ by default, so IgM can be produced. V(D)J recombination occurs at the variable region loci and is independent of switch regions; thus, it is unaffected by deletion of $S\\alpha$.\n\n6. Incorporate the mucosal challenge context. Although an oral attenuated bacterium typically elicits strong IgA responses in mucosal tissues, the absence of $S\\alpha$ specifically prevents switching to IgA despite intact mucosal cues and AID expression. Therefore, the observed isotype profile will lack IgA while retaining IgM and other switched isotypes (e.g., IgG, potentially IgE).\n\n7. Match to the options. The profile is: unable to produce IgA, but able to produce IgM and switch to other isotypes like IgG. This corresponds to option B, while:\n- A is incorrect because CSR to other isotypes remains possible with intact $S\\gamma$ and AID.\n- C is incorrect because V(D)J recombination is not affected by $S\\alpha$ deletion.\n- D is incorrect because IgA production requires $S\\alpha$, which is deleted.\n- E is incorrect and incompatible with the deletion of $S\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}]}
