These molecules are categorized into two main classes, Class I and Class II, which possess distinct structures and functions. An immunology student is tasked with identifying the correct structural model for a functional MHC class II molecule as it would be found on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate structural description of an MHC class II molecule?\n\nA. The molecule consists of two non-covalently associated polypeptide chains: a larger alpha (α) chain and a smaller beta (β) chain. Both chains are transmembrane proteins. The peptide-binding groove is formed by the interaction of the outermost domains of both chains, specifically the α1 and β1 domains.\n\nB. The molecule consists of a single, large, transmembrane alpha (α) chain that is non-covalently associated with a small, non-transmembrane protein called beta-2 microglobulin (β2m). The peptide-binding groove is formed entirely by domains of the alpha chain, specifically the α1 and α2 domains.\n\nC. The molecule is a heterodimer composed of an alpha (α) chain and a beta (β) chain. Only the alpha chain possesses a transmembrane region that anchors the complex to the cell membrane, while the beta chain is entirely extracellular and disulfide-bonded to the alpha chain.\n\nD. The molecule is a tetramer composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. Antigen-binding sites are formed at the N-terminal ends by the combination of one heavy chain and one light chain.", "solution": "We identify the essential structural features of MHC class II molecules from immunology principles:\n- An MHC class II molecule is a heterodimer composed of two non-covalently associated polypeptide chains, denoted $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n- Both the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ chains are transmembrane glycoproteins, each with two extracellular domains (for $\\alpha$: $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$; for $\\beta$: $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$), a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail.\n- The peptide-binding groove of MHC class II is formed by the pairing of the N-terminal domains $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ and is typically open at both ends, accommodating longer peptides.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- Option A states there are two non-covalently associated chains, a larger $\\alpha$ and a smaller $\\beta$, both transmembrane, and that the peptide-binding groove is formed by $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{1}$. This matches the canonical structure of MHC class II.\n- Option B describes a single large transmembrane $\\alpha$ chain with $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin, and a groove formed by $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$. This is the structural description of MHC class I, not class II, so it is incorrect.\n- Option C claims only the $\\alpha$ chain is transmembrane, with the $\\beta$ chain extracellular and disulfide-bonded to $\\alpha$.

This next exercise [@problem_id:2249281] delves into the cellular machinery responsible for the assembly and transport of MHC class II molecules, focusing on the indispensable role of the invariant chain (Ii). By considering a hypothetical scenario where this key chaperone is absent, you will explore the principles of protein stability, Endoplasmic Reticulum quality control, and targeted trafficking.", "problem": "In antigen-presenting cells, the assembly and transport of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules are meticulously regulated. Newly synthesized MHC class II α and β chains assemble in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and associate with a third protein, the invariant chain (Ii). The Ii performs several critical functions: it acts as a molecular chaperone to stabilize the αβ heterodimer, it physically blocks the peptide-binding groove to prevent premature loading of peptides within the ER, and it contains targeting signals that direct the entire complex into the endocytic pathway for eventual loading with peptides derived from extracellular pathogens.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered human B-cell line in which the gene encoding the invariant chain (Ii) has been functionally deleted (a knockout). Based on your understanding of protein folding, cellular quality control, and trafficking, predict the most likely primary fate of the newly synthesized MHC class II αβ heterodimers in these Ii-negative cells.\n\nA. The αβ heterodimers will form but will be structurally unstable, leading to their aggregation, retention within the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and subsequent degradation.\n\nB. The αβ heterodimers will assemble correctly, traffic out of the ER, and become loaded with endogenous peptides derived from proteins within the ER lumen before being expressed on the cell surface.\n\nC. The αβ heterodimers will assemble and traffic successfully through the ER and Golgi apparatus, but will accumulate in the endosomal compartments because they cannot be loaded with peptides.\n\nD. The αβ heterodimers will assemble and be successfully transported to the cell surface as empty, stable molecules, awaiting direct binding of extracellular antigens.\n\nE. The αβ chains will be synthesized but will be completely unable to associate with each other, remaining as individual, unfolded monomers that are immediately degraded.", "solution": "To determine the fate of MHC class II molecules in the absence of the invariant chain (Ii), we must analyze the consequences of losing each of Ii's key functions.\n\n1.  **Normal Functions of the Invariant Chain (Ii):**\n    *   **Chaperone and Stability:** The Ii chain acts as a molecular chaperone. It non-covalently associates with the newly synthesized MHC class II α and β chains in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). This association is crucial for the proper folding and structural stability of the αβ heterodimer. The empty peptide-binding groove of an MHC class II molecule is inherently unstable and conformationally flexible at physiological temperature and pH. Ii stabilizes this structure.\n    *   **Groove Blockade:** A region of the Ii chain, which is later processed into the Class II-associated Invariant chain Peptide (CLIP), sits within the peptide-binding groove. This physically prevents peptides present within the ER (which are typically destined for MHC class I molecules) from binding to the MHC class II groove prematurely.\n    *   **Trafficking:** The cytoplasmic tail of the Ii contains sorting signals (dileucine motifs) that are recognized by the cellular transport machinery. These signals ensure that the MHC class II-Ii complex is sorted from the trans-Golgi network into the endocytic pathway, specifically to late endosomes/lysosomes (often called MIIC compartments), where it encounters peptides derived from endocytosed extracellular antigens.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Ii Knockout:**\n    *   **Loss of Chaperone Function:** Without Ii to stabilize them, the newly formed MHC class II αβ heterodimers are structurally unstable. The empty, \"floppy\" peptide-binding groove makes the entire complex prone to misfolding and aggregation. The quality control system of the ER, which involves chaperones like calnexin and BiP, identifies misfolded or improperly assembled proteins. These aberrant proteins are retained in the ER and targeted for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which typically involves ubiquitination and subsequent destruction by the proteasome. Therefore, very few, if any, MHC class II molecules can successfully exit the ER. This is the primary and most immediate consequence.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. The αβ heterodimers will form but will be structurally unstable, leading to their aggregation, retention within the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and subsequent degradation.** This statement is correct. It accurately describes the consequence of losing the primary chaperone function of the Ii. Experimental evidence confirms that in Ii-deficient cells, MHC class II molecules are largely retained in the ER and degraded.\n    *   **B. The αβ heterodimers will assemble correctly, traffic out of the ER, and become loaded with endogenous peptides derived from proteins within the ER lumen before being expressed on the cell surface.** This is incorrect for two main reasons. First, without Ii, the heterodimers are not stable enough to \"assemble correctly\" and traffic out of the ER. Second, this option neglects the primary stability issue and incorrectly assumes trafficking is normal.\n    *   **C. The αβ heterodimers will assemble and traffic successfully through the ER and Golgi apparatus, but will accumulate in the endosomal compartments because they cannot be loaded with peptides.** This is incorrect. The molecules fail to traffic successfully out of the ER in the first place due to instability. This option incorrectly assumes the initial folding and ER-exit steps are successful.\n    *   **D. The αβ heterodimers will assemble and be successfully transported to the cell surface as empty, stable molecules, awaiting direct binding of extracellular antigens.** This is incorrect. Empty MHC class II molecules are not stable at the cell surface or even within the cell at 37°C. The central premise that they are \"stable\" is false.\n    *   **E. The αβ chains will be synthesized but will be completely unable to associate with each other, remaining as individual, unfolded monomers that are immediately degraded.** This is subtly incorrect. The α and β chains can and do associate to some extent. The problem lies not in the complete failure of association, but in the profound instability of the *resulting dimer*. Option A more accurately describes the fate as instability and aggregation of the *formed* heterodimer.\n\nTherefore, the loss of the chaperone function of Ii is the most critical defect, leading to the instability of the MHC class II heterodimer, its retention in the ER by the quality control machinery, and its eventual degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2249281"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the structure and biogenesis of the MHC class II molecule, we now turn to its ultimate function: the activation of a helper T-cell. This final practice [@problem_id:2249283] explores the functional consequences of a highly specific structural change, testing your understanding of the interplay between the T-cell Receptor (TCR) and the CD4 co-receptor. It demonstrates how precise molecular interactions are essential for translating antigen recognition into a robust immune response.", "problem": "The activation of a naive helper T-cell by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) is a finely tuned process. It fundamentally requires the T-cell Receptor (TCR) to recognize a specific peptide antigen bound to a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule on the APC's surface. In humans, these MHC molecules are known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). This primary recognition event is stabilized by the interaction of the CD4 co-receptor on the T-cell with a non-polymorphic region of the MHC class II molecule. Specifically, transmembrane protein CD4 binds to the β2 domain of the HLA-DR molecule, a common type of human MHC class II. This co-receptor binding is critical for sustaining the T-cell-APC interaction and for recruiting intracellular signaling molecules, such as the kinase Lck, to the TCR complex.\n\nConsider a biomedical research scenario where a cell line of APCs is genetically engineered to express a mutated form of the HLA-DR molecule. This mutation is a single amino acid substitution located in an exposed loop of the β2 domain. Biochemical assays demonstrate two key properties of this mutated HLA-DR:\n1. It binds and presents its target peptide antigen with the same affinity and conformation as the wild-type HLA-DR molecule.\n2. The mutation completely prevents the binding of the CD4 co-receptor, while not affecting any other part of the molecule's structure.\n\nThese engineered APCs, loaded with a high concentration of the specific peptide, are co-cultured with a population of naive helper T-cells whose TCRs are specific for this peptide-HLA-DR complex. Assume that all other conditions are optimal for T-cell activation, including the normal expression and function of co-stimulatory signal molecules (e.g., B7 on the APC and CD28 on the T-cell).\n\nWhich of the following choices most accurately predicts the functional consequence for T-cell activation in this experimental system?\n\nA. T-cell activation will proceed with normal kinetics and magnitude, as the primary recognition of the peptide by the TCR is unaffected.\n\nB. T-cells will fail to be activated and will enter a state of anergy, as the lack of CD4 engagement is functionally equivalent to receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2.\n\nC. T-cell activation will be significantly attenuated, requiring a much higher antigen dose or a TCR with intrinsically higher affinity to achieve a response comparable to that seen with wild-type HLA-DR.\n\nD. The T-cells will immediately undergo activation-induced cell death (apoptosis) due to the incomplete and anomalous signaling from the TCR complex.\n\nE. The interaction will be completely non-productive, with the T-cells failing to recognize or bind to the APCs in any measurable way.", "solution": "T-cell activation of naive $CD4^+$ T cells requires at minimum Signal 1 (TCR engagement of peptide–MHC class II) and Signal 2 (costimulation, e.g., CD28 binding B7). The CD4 co-receptor is not a separate “signal,” but it is essential for efficient Signal 1 by stabilizing TCR–MHC class II interactions and, critically, by recruiting the Src-family kinase Lck to the TCR–CD3 complex to phosphorylate ITAMs and initiate robust downstream signaling.\n\nGiven the engineered HLA-DR:\n- The peptide–MHC class II complex is presented normally, so TCR recognition (Signal 1 ligand) is intact.\n- CD4 binding to the HLA-DR beta2 domain is abolished, specifically removing CD4-mediated stabilization and Lck recruitment.\n- Costimulation via B7–CD28 (Signal 2) is intact and normal.\n\nLogical consequences:\n1. TCR–pMHC binding still occurs because the mutation does not alter the peptide-binding groove or TCR contact residues, so recognition is not abolished.\n2. Loss of CD4 binding diminishes the effective avidity of the T cell–APC interaction and markedly reduces proximal TCR signaling due to impaired Lck delivery to CD3 ITAMs. This raises the activation threshold.\n3. Because Signal 2 is present, the scenario is not equivalent to “Signal 1 without Signal 2,” so classic anergy induction is not expected from missing costimulation.\n4. Naive $CD4^+$ T cells are especially dependent on CD4-mediated signal amplification; therefore, activation will be weaker and require higher antigen density or higher intrinsic TCR affinity to reach the activation threshold comparable to wild-type HLA-DR conditions.\n5. Immediate activation-induced cell death is unlikely, as AICD typically follows repeated or strong activation, not attenuated signaling.\n6. Non-recognition is incorrect because TCR–pMHC recognition persists.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that activation is significantly attenuated and requires higher antigen dose or higher TCR affinity to achieve a response comparable to wild-type HLA-DR, matching option C. Options A, B, D, and E are inconsistent with the outlined signaling biology: A ignores the essential amplification role of CD4; B misattributes the effect to absent costimulation; D predicts apoptosis despite reduced signaling; E contradicts preserved TCR recognition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249283"}]}
