By analyzing why this anucleated cell fails to alert the immune system, you will solidify your understanding of the non-negotiable requirements for MHC class I antigen presentation, namely the machinery for protein synthesis and transport.", "problem": "Imagine a novel, hypothetical virus that has evolved a specialized mechanism allowing it to successfully infect mature, circulating human erythrocytes (red blood cells). Once inside, the virus uses the erythrocyte's residual metabolic machinery to synthesize its own viral proteins. Despite the presence of these foreign viral proteins within the cytoplasm, the infected erythrocyte is incapable of presenting these antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby failing to trigger an immune response via the endogenous pathway.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental and complete cellular reason for this failure in antigen presentation?\n\nA. The viral proteins are immediately bound and denatured by the high concentration of hemoglobin within the erythrocyte, preventing them from being processed into peptides.\n\nB. Mature erythrocytes are not considered professional antigen-presenting cells because they lack the surface expression of MHC class II molecules.\n\nC. Mature erythrocytes lack a nucleus and an endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore cannot synthesize new Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nD. The absence of lysosomes in mature erythrocytes prevents the degradation of viral proteins into antigenic peptides of the correct size for MHC loading.\n\nE. The proteasomes present in erythrocytes are structurally different from those in nucleated cells and are unable to recognize and degrade ubiquitinated viral proteins.", "solution": "I proceed by identifying the cellular requirements for endogenous antigen presentation and then comparing them with the organelle complement of mature erythrocytes, followed by elimination of incorrect alternatives.\n\nPrinciple of the endogenous (MHC class I) pathway:\n- Endogenous proteins in the cytosol are degraded by proteasomes into peptides of appropriate length.\n- These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen by TAP.\n- In the ER, peptides are loaded onto newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains associated with beta-2 microglobulin, with the assistance of chaperones (e.g., calnexin, calreticulin, tapasin).\n- The peptide–MHC class I complexes then traffic via the Golgi to the plasma membrane for presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\n\nRequired cellular components for this pathway:\n- A nucleus to transcribe the genes encoding the MHC class I heavy chain and other required components.\n- Ribosomes and an ER to translate and assemble the MHC class I molecules and to perform peptide loading (which occurs in the ER).\n- Golgi apparatus for trafficking the assembled peptide–MHC complexes to the cell surface.\n\nKey facts about mature erythrocytes:\n- Mature human erythrocytes lack a nucleus, ER, Golgi, and ribosomes; they do not synthesize new proteins.\n- Consequently, they cannot synthesize new MHC class I molecules, nor can they perform ER-dependent peptide loading and trafficking to the cell surface.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A. Incorrect. Hemoglobin does not globally denature all foreign proteins to prevent proteasomal processing; this is not a recognized block in the MHC class I pathway.\n- B. Incorrect. MHC class II pertains to the exogenous pathway; the question concerns failure of the endogenous (MHC class I) presentation to CTLs.\n- C. Correct. The lack of a nucleus prevents transcription of MHC class I components, and the absence of the ER prevents assembly and peptide loading; thus mature erythrocytes cannot synthesize or present MHC class I.\n- D. Incorrect. Lysosomes are not required for endogenous MHC class I processing; proteasomes, not lysosomes, generate the peptides for MHC class I.\n- E. Incorrect and speculative. The fundamental block is not a specialized erythrocyte proteasome but rather the absence of the nucleus and ER needed for MHC class I synthesis and loading.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and complete cellular reason is the absence of the nucleus and ER, which precludes synthesis and ER-dependent assembly/loading of MHC class I molecules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275808"}, {"introduction": "A functional MHC class I molecule is a partnership between two proteins: the heavy $\\alpha$ chain and the light chain, $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m).

Understanding the fate of the unpaired $\\alpha$ chains provides crucial insight into ER-associated degradation (ERAD), the cell's quality control system that ensures only properly assembled proteins proceed through the secretory pathway.", "problem": "The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule is crucial for the adaptive immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate virus-infected or cancerous cells. A functional MHC class I molecule, expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells, is a heterodimer consisting of a polymorphic, transmembrane heavy chain (the $\\alpha$ chain) and a smaller, non-polymorphic light chain called $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). The assembly of this complex begins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\n\nConsider a special line of human cells that has been genetically engineered to be a null mutant for the gene encoding $\\beta_2$m.

Proper folding and exit from the ER depend on formation of the $\\alpha:\\beta_2$m heterodimer and loading of peptide, assisted by ER chaperones (e.g., calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, and tapasin). In cells lacking $\\beta_2$m, newly synthesized MHC class I $\\alpha$ chains cannot form the required heterodimer. As a result, they fail to achieve the native conformation recognized by ER quality control. Initially, these $\\alpha$ chains bind ER chaperones (notably calnexin) in an attempt to fold correctly, but without $\\beta_2$m they remain incompletely folded and cannot proceed to peptide loading or exit the ER. Persistent failure to fold triggers ER-associated degradation (ERAD): the misfolded $\\alpha$ chains are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane to the cytosol, ubiquitinated by ER-resident E3 ligases, and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. Therefore, while transient ER retention by chaperones occurs, the most likely ultimate fate is proteasomal degradation in the cytosol rather than stable accumulation, secretion, or lysosomal degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275839"}, {"introduction": "The interaction between a peptide and an MHC class I molecule is exquisitely specific and forms the molecular basis for T-cell recognition.

The binding of a peptide to an MHC molecule is highly specific and is determined by the peptide's amino acid sequence, particularly at 'anchor' positions.\n\nA team of virologists is developing a vaccine against a newly discovered virus. They have focused on a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele, `HLA-A*02:07`, which is a type of MHC class I molecule prevalent in the target population. Through structural analysis, they have determined the peptide-binding motif for `HLA-A*02:07` as follows:\n\n1.  The peptide must be exactly 9 amino acids long (a nonapeptide).\n2.  The amino acid at position 2 (P2) must be a hydrophobic residue, specifically Leucine (L) or Methionine (M). This is the dominant primary anchor.\n3.  The amino acid at position 9 (P9), the C-terminus, must be a small amino acid, specifically Valine (V) or Alanine (A). This is the secondary anchor.\n4.  Binding affinity is drastically reduced if the residue at the dominant P2 anchor does not match the motif, even if the P9 anchor is a perfect fit. A peptide with a correct P2 anchor but an incorrect P9 anchor is considered a weak binder, but is significantly better than one with an incorrect P2 anchor.\n\nThe researchers have identified four potential nonapeptide epitopes from a key viral structural protein. Which of the following peptides is predicted to be the strongest binder to the `HLA-A*02:07` molecule and therefore the most promising candidate for a peptide-based vaccine?\n\nA. Peptide `NLTKFGPSV`\n\nB. Peptide `SMQDLWNTI`\n\nC. Peptide `GTEYKRSLV`\n\nD. Peptide `KLPQEVIGA`", "solution": "We use the stated motif for HLA-A*02:07:\n- Peptide length must be exactly 9.\n- Dominant anchor at P2 must be L or M.\n- Secondary anchor at P9 must be V or A.\n- A mismatch at P2 drastically reduces affinity; a correct P2 with incorrect P9 yields a weak binder; correct P2 and P9 yields a strong binder.\n\nEvaluate each peptide:\n\nA. NLTKFGPSV\n- Length: 9.\n- P2 = L (matches dominant anchor).\n- P9 = V (matches secondary anchor).\n- Prediction: strong binder (both anchors correct).\n\nB. SMQDLWNTI\n- Length: 9.\n- P2 = M (matches dominant anchor).\n- P9 = I (does not match V or A).\n- Prediction: weak binder (correct P2, incorrect P9), but inferior to peptides with both anchors correct.\n\nC. GTEYKRSLV\n- Length: 9.\n- P2 = T (does not match L or M).\n- P9 = V (matches).\n- Prediction: poor binder due to incorrect dominant P2 anchor, even though P9 fits.\n\nD. KLPQEVIGA\n- Length: 9.\n- P2 = L (matches).\n- P9 = A (matches).\n- Prediction: strong binder (both anchors correct).\n\nBetween A and D, both satisfy the dominant and secondary anchors. In HLA-A2 family molecules, P9=V typically makes stronger hydrophobic contacts in the F pocket than P9=A, leading to tighter binding when all else is equal. Therefore, among the strong binders, A is predicted to be the strongest.\n\nThus, the strongest binder is peptide A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275854"}]}
