This first practice challenges you to apply the foundational rule of peptide-MHC binding: the requirement for specific 'anchor' residues that secure the peptide within the MHC groove. By analyzing a hypothetical vaccine's failure, you will see why understanding an individual's MHC genotype and its corresponding binding motifs is a critical first step in predicting immunogenicity and designing immunotherapies [@problem_id:2250110].", "problem": "A team of immunologists is developing a peptide-based vaccine against a novel intracellular virus. The goal is to stimulate a robust cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in a specific patient. The patient's genotype for the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I loci is known to be heterozygous, expressing only the alleles HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*27:05.\n\nThe binding specificities for these MHC molecules are determined by key \"anchor\" residues within the peptide. For stable binding of a 9-amino-acid peptide, the following motifs are required:\n-   **HLA-A\\*02:01**: The amino acid at position 2 (P2) must be Leucine (L) or Methionine (M), and the amino acid at position 9 (P9) must be Valine (V) or Leucine (L).\n-   **HLA-B\\*27:05**: The amino acid at position 2 (P2) must be Arginine (R).\n\nThe research team synthesizes a 9-amino-acid peptide, `ATFGHYMNL`, derived from a viral protein that is abundantly expressed in infected cells. However, when this peptide is used as a vaccine, the patient fails to mount any detectable CTL response against it.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate explanation for this vaccine failure?\n\nA. The peptide `ATFGHYMNL` lacks the necessary anchor residues to bind stably to either HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-B*27:05.\n\nB. Peptides of 9 amino acids are too short to be effectively loaded onto MHC Class I molecules, which preferentially bind longer peptides.\n\nC. The patient naturally lacks T-cells capable of recognizing this specific peptide-MHC complex due to negative selection in the thymus (a 'hole' in the T-cell repertoire).\n\nD. The peptide is derived from an intracellular pathogen, meaning it will be presented exclusively on MHC Class II molecules, which are recognized by helper T-cells, not CTLs.\n\nE. The peptide binds effectively only to the patient's HLA-A*02:01 allele, and stimulation via a single MHC allele is insufficient to generate a measurable CTL response.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct reason a specific peptide vaccine, `ATFGHYMNL`, failed to elicit a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in a patient with a known Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I genotype (HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*27:05).\n\nThe central principle is MHC restriction: CTLs can only recognize a peptide if it is first presented on the surface of a cell by an MHC molecule. The stability of this peptide-MHC complex is largely determined by the \"anchor residues\" of the peptide fitting into specific pockets within the MHC molecule's binding groove. If the peptide cannot bind to any of the patient's MHC molecules, it cannot be presented to CTLs, and no immune response can be initiated.\n\nWe must analyze the given peptide sequence, `ATFGHYMNL`, and check if it conforms to the binding motifs of the patient's MHC alleles. The single-letter amino acid codes for the peptide are:\nA (Alanine), T (Threonine), F (Phenylalanine), G (Glycine), H (Histidine), Y (Tyrosine), M (Methionine), N (Asparagine), L (Leucine).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze binding to HLA-A\\*02:01.**\nThe binding motif for HLA-A*02:01 requires:\n-   Position 2 (P2): Leucine (L) or Methionine (M).\n-   Position 9 (P9): Valine (V) or Leucine (L).\n\nLet's examine the peptide `ATFGHYMNL`:\n-   The amino acid at P2 is Threonine (T). This does **not** match the required L or M.\n-   The amino acid at P9 is Leucine (L). This **does** match the required V or L.\n\nFor stable binding to MHC Class I, the primary anchor residues are critical. The failure of the P2 residue to match the required motif means the peptide will not bind stably to HLA-A*02:01, despite the P9 anchor being correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze binding to HLA-B\\*27:05.**\nThe binding motif for HLA-B*27:05 requires:\n-   Position 2 (P2): Arginine (R).\n\nLet's examine the peptide `ATFGHYMNL` again:\n-   The amino acid at P2 is Threonine (T). This does **not** match the required Arginine (R).\n\nThe peptide clearly does not possess the correct anchor residue to bind to HLA-B*27:05.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the results and evaluate the options.**\nOur analysis shows that the peptide `ATFGHYMNL` cannot bind stably to either of the patient's expressed MHC Class I alleles due to a mismatch at the critical P2 anchor position for both.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n-   **A. The peptide `ATFGHYMNL` lacks the necessary anchor residues to bind stably to either HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-B*27:05.** This statement is fully supported by our analysis in Steps 1 and 2. This is the direct, primary cause of the failure.\n-   **B. Peptides of 9 amino acids are too short to be effectively loaded onto MHC Class I molecules...** This is factually incorrect. The optimal length for peptides binding to MHC Class I is 8-10 amino acids, so 9 is ideal.\n-   **C. The patient naturally lacks T-cells capable of recognizing this specific peptide-MHC complex...** While this (a \"hole in the repertoire\") is a possible reason for a lack of response in general, it is a secondary issue. The primary failure here is that the peptide-MHC complex cannot even form. The problem asks for the most direct explanation based on the provided data, which points to the binding failure.\n-   **D. The peptide is derived from an intracellular pathogen, meaning it will be presented exclusively on MHC Class II molecules...** This is factually incorrect. The MHC Class I pathway is specialized for presenting peptides from intracellular sources (like viruses and some bacteria) to CTLs. MHC Class II presents peptides from extracellular sources.\n-   **E. The peptide binds effectively only to the patient's HLA-A*02:01 allele...** This is factually incorrect. Our analysis in Step 1 showed that the peptide fails to bind to HLA-A*02:01 due to the incorrect P2 anchor.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate reason for the vaccine's failure is the inability of the chosen peptide to bind to the patient's MHC molecules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2250110"}, {"introduction": "While stable peptide-MHC binding is necessary, it is not sufficient for T-cell activation, as the T-cell receptor (TCR) must also specifically recognize the composite surface created by the peptide and MHC molecule. This exercise [@problem_id:2250085] uses experimental data to distinguish between peptide residues critical for MHC binding (anchors) and those essential for TCR recognition. Solving it demonstrates how a single amino acid change can abolish an immune response without affecting MHC presentation, thereby isolating the two key levels of specificity.", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the response of a specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone to a viral infection. This CTL clone is known to recognize a specific nonapeptide (a peptide of 9 amino acids) derived from a viral protein when it is presented by a particular Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecule on the surface of infected cells.\n\nTo probe the details of this recognition, the immunologist synthesizes a mutant version of the nonapeptide where the amino acid at position 5 is changed from a leucine to an alanine. They then conduct two parallel experiments:\n\n1.  **MHC Binding Assay:** Purified, empty MHC Class I molecules are incubated with either the original viral peptide or the mutant peptide. A biophysical measurement confirms that the mutant peptide binds to the MHC molecule with an affinity identical to that of the original peptide.\n2.  **CTL Activation Assay:** Target cells expressing the correct MHC Class I molecule are loaded with either the original peptide or the mutant peptide and then co-cultured with the CTL clone. The original peptide robustly activates the CTLs, leading to target cell lysis. However, the mutant peptide fails to trigger any CTL activation whatsoever.\n\nGiven these experimental observations, what is the most likely explanation for the CTL clone's failure to recognize the mutant peptide-MHC complex?\n\nA. The single amino acid mutation prevented the mutant peptide from being transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP transporter.\n\nB. The mutation occurred at a primary anchor residue, destabilizing the peptide's interaction with the floor of the MHC binding groove.\n\nC. The T-cell Receptor (TCR) of the CTL clone is specific for the original peptide, and the mutation altered a key TCR contact residue.\n\nD. The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone mutated during the experiment and lost its antigen specificity.\n\nE. The change from leucine to alanine caused the peptide to be presented by an MHC Class II molecule, which cannot be recognized by the CTL clone.", "solution": "We analyze the two experiments using core principles of antigen presentation and T-cell recognition.\n\nFirst, for MHC Class I presentation, peptides bind via primary anchor residues to defined pockets in the MHC binding groove, typically at specific positions (often near the termini, e.g., position 2 and the C-terminal position for many alleles). Residues projecting upward from the middle of the peptide (such as position 5 in a nonapeptide) frequently serve as T-cell receptor (TCR) contact residues. CTL activation requires that the TCR recognize the specific composite surface formed by the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex; thus, a mutation that preserves MHC binding but changes a TCR-exposed side chain can abrogate T-cell recognition.\n\nFrom the MHC binding assay, the mutant peptide binds the MHC Class I molecule with affinity identical to the original peptide. Therefore, the mutation did not disrupt primary anchor interactions with the MHC binding groove. This directly argues against the explanation that an anchor residue was destabilized, eliminating option B. It also indicates that the peptide can be presented by the same MHC Class I molecule, arguing against a switch to MHC Class II presentation, eliminating option E.\n\nFrom the CTL activation assay, target cells loaded with the original peptide are robustly lysed, while those loaded with the mutant peptide are not recognized at all. Because both peptides can be loaded exogenously onto target cells, intracellular peptide processing and transport by TAP are bypassed; thus, the failure to activate CTLs cannot be attributed to TAP transport, eliminating option A. The loss of CTL activation with the mutant peptide, contrasted with robust activation with the original peptide in the same experimental setting, makes it highly unlikely that the CTL clone itself mutated during the experiment, eliminating option D.\n\nThe most parsimonious explanation consistent with identical MHC binding but complete loss of CTL recognition is that the mutation altered a key TCR contact residue, changing the pMHC surface seen by the TCR and preventing recognition. This fits the known role of central residues (such as position 5 in a nonapeptide) as TCR-facing positions. Therefore, option C is the most likely explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2250085"}, {"introduction": "The final layer of specificity in T-cell activation is enforced by co-receptors, which ensure that T-cells interact with the appropriate class of MHC molecule. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2250129] explores a genetically engineered T-cell with a mismatched TCR and co-receptor to reveal their distinct and non-interchangeable roles. This practice will solidify your understanding of why CD4+ T-cells are MHC class II-restricted and CD8+ T-cells are MHC class I-restricted, a central tenet of cellular immunology.", "problem": "An immunologist is studying the rules of T-cell activation. A T-cell clone is genetically engineered to have a T-cell Receptor (TCR) that recognizes a specific peptide bound to a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule. However, the cell is simultaneously engineered to lack the CD4 co-receptor and instead express the CD8 co-receptor.\n\nThese engineered T-cells are mixed with Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) that have processed an antigen and are presenting the specific target peptide on their MHC class II molecules. The APCs are also expressing all other molecules necessary for T-cell co-stimulation (e.g., B7 family molecules).\n\nConsidering the canonical roles of the TCR, MHC molecules, and co-receptors in T-cell activation, what is the most likely outcome of this interaction?\n\nA. The T-cell will be fully activated, as the TCR's recognition of the peptide-MHC complex is the primary determinant of activation.\n\nB. The T-cell will not be activated because the CD8 co-receptor will physically block the TCR from accessing the MHC class II molecule.\n\nC. The T-cell will not be activated because the CD8 co-receptor is unable to bind to the MHC class II molecule, failing to provide the necessary stabilization and signaling contribution for the typically low-affinity TCR-pMHC interaction.\n\nD. The T-cell will be activated by its CD8 co-receptor binding to an unrelated MHC class I molecule on the APC, regardless of what the TCR recognizes.\n\nE. The T-cell will be activated, and it will differentiate into a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte instead of a helper T-cell due to the presence of the CD8 co-receptor.", "solution": "We analyze the requirements for T-cell activation and the specificity of co-receptor interactions:\n\n1. Signal 1 requires TCR recognition of its cognate peptide presented by an MHC molecule on the APC. In this case, the engineered TCR is specific for a peptide presented by MHC class II on the APC. Although this provides antigen specificity, TCR-pMHC interactions are typically of low affinity and require co-receptor participation for efficient signaling.\n\n2. Co-receptors CD4 and CD8 have strict MHC specificity: CD4 binds non-polymorphic regions of MHC class II, whereas CD8 binds non-polymorphic regions of MHC class I. The engineered T cells lack CD4 and instead express CD8. Because the APC presents peptide on MHC class II, CD8 cannot bind to MHC class II. Therefore, the co-receptor cannot stabilize the TCR-pMHC interaction.\n\n3. Beyond adhesion/stabilization, co-receptors are essential for signaling because they recruit the Src family kinase Lck to the TCR-CD3 complex. Lck phosphorylates ITAMs in CD3, initiating the signaling cascade required for activation. Without the appropriate co-receptor engagement (here, CD4 for MHC class II), Lck recruitment is markedly impaired, and signal 1 is insufficient even in the presence of abundant antigen.\n\n4. Signal 2 (costimulation), provided by B7 family molecules binding CD28, cannot substitute for signal 1. Costimulation augments activation but does not overcome the deficiency of inadequate TCR-proximal signaling caused by the absence of the correct co-receptor.\n\n5. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: TCR recognition alone is generally insufficient; co-receptor participation is critical for effective activation.\n- B is incorrect: CD8 does not physically block TCR access to MHC class II; it simply fails to bind MHC class II and thus cannot contribute.\n- C is correct: CD8 cannot bind MHC class II, so there is neither stabilization nor Lck delivery, making activation unlikely despite TCR specificity and costimulation.\n- D is incorrect: CD8 binding to MHC class I on the same APC, if present, would not trigger activation without concurrent TCR engagement with its specific pMHC; co-receptor engagement alone does not activate the T cell.\n- E is incorrect: Differentiation into cytotoxic or helper lineages depends on thymic selection and the context of activation; moreover, activation still requires appropriate co-receptor engagement with the presenting MHC class (here absent).\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is failure of activation due to lack of appropriate co-receptor binding and signaling with MHC class II.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2250129"}]}
