[@problem_id:2249088]", "problem": "A team of immunologists is studying a specialized laboratory cell line that has a homozygous null mutation in the gene encoding for $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). This mutation prevents the synthesis of any functional $\\beta_2$m protein. The gene for the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I heavy chain is, however, completely normal and is actively transcribed and translated. Based on your understanding of MHC class I molecule assembly and trafficking, what would be the most likely fate of the MHC class I heavy chain protein in these cells?\n\nA.

The synthesis of the MHC class I heavy chain is automatically downregulated at the transcriptional level due to the absence of its binding partner, $\\beta_2$m.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fate of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I heavy chain in a cell that cannot produce its essential binding partner, $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). To solve this, we must review the canonical pathway for MHC class I assembly and transport.\n\nStep 1: MHC Class I Structure\nA complete, stable MHC class I molecule consists of three components: a transmembrane heavy chain (also called the $\\alpha$ chain), a smaller, non-covalently associated protein called $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m), and a short peptide (typically 8-10 amino acids long) bound in a groove formed by the heavy chain.\n\nStep 2: The Normal Assembly Pathway in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\nThe assembly process is a highly regulated, multi-step sequence occurring within the ER.\n1.  The MHC class I heavy chain is synthesized on ribosomes and translocated into the lumen of the ER.\n2.  In the ER, the newly synthesized heavy chain is stabilized by a chaperone protein called calnexin, which helps it to fold partially.\n3.  The crucial next step is the binding of $\\beta_2$m to the heavy chain. This binding induces a conformational change in the heavy chain, causing it to be released from calnexin. The heavy chain/$\\beta_2$m heterodimer is now ready to join the peptide-loading complex (PLC).\n4.  The heavy chain/$\\beta_2$m heterodimer associates with the PLC, which includes the chaperones calreticulin and ERp57, and the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP).\n5.  Peptides, generated in the cytoplasm by the proteasome, are transported into the ER by the TAP transporter.\n6.  A peptide with the correct size and anchor residues binds to the peptide-binding groove of the heavy chain. This peptide binding is the final step that confers full structural stability to the entire three-part MHC class I molecule.\n7.  Once a peptide is bound, the now-stable MHC class I molecule is released from the PLC and is free to exit the ER. It transits through the Golgi apparatus and is finally transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ T cells.\n\nStep 3: Consequence of a Null Mutation in the $\\beta_2$m Gene\nIn the scenario described, the cell cannot produce any $\\beta_2$m protein.\n1.  The MHC class I heavy chain is synthesized and enters the ER as normal.\n2.  It associates with the chaperone calnexin.\n3.  However, because there is no $\\beta_2$m available to bind to it, the heavy chain cannot undergo the necessary conformational change to be released from calnexin.\n4.  Without $\\beta_2$m, the heavy chain remains in a partially folded, unstable state. It cannot associate with the PLC and therefore can never bind a peptide.\n5.  Proteins that remain misfolded or incompletely assembled in the ER for an extended period are recognized by the cell's quality control system. This system targets them for a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The misfolded heavy chains are retro-translocated out of the ER into the cytoplasm, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating the Options\nBased on this understanding, we can now evaluate the given choices:\n- A. The MHC class I heavy chain is synthesized, transported to the Golgi apparatus, but then targeted for lysosomal degradation... This is incorrect. The heavy chain is trapped in the ER and does not reach the Golgi. Furthermore, degradation of misfolded ER proteins primarily occurs via the proteasome, not the lysosome.\n- B. The MHC class I heavy chain is successfully transported to the cell surface, but it remains unstable and is rapidly endocytosed and degraded. This is incorrect. Without $\\beta_2$m and a bound peptide, the heavy chain is far too unstable to be transported to the cell surface.\n- C. The MHC class I heavy chain is synthesized but remains trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum, is unable to fold correctly, and is eventually targeted for proteasomal degradation. This statement accurately describes the fate of the heavy chain. It remains in the ER because it cannot associate with $\\beta_2$m, it is considered misfolded, and is degraded by the proteasome as part of the ERAD pathway.\n- D. The MHC class I heavy chain folds correctly and is transported to the cell surface, but without $\\beta_2$m, it is incapable of binding and presenting peptides. This is incorrect. The heavy chain cannot fold correctly or be transported to the cell surface without $\\beta_2$m.\n- E. The synthesis of the MHC class I heavy chain is automatically downregulated at the transcriptional level... This is incorrect. The problem states the gene is actively transcribed and translated. While long-term cellular responses can be complex, the direct molecular consequence of the protein's absence is a post-translational issue, not a transcriptional one.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the fate of the MHC class I heavy chain is that it is retained in the ER and eventually degraded by the proteasome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249088"}, {"introduction": "A stable peptide-MHC complex on the cell surface is necessary but not sufficient for T-cell activation. This next practice examines the crucial interaction with the cytotoxic T lymphocyte's CD8 co-receptor, a key stabilizing event in immune recognition. This scenario will help you understand how different domains of the MHC I heavy chain, like the $\\alpha_3$ domain, have distinct, non-overlapping functions in mediating a successful immune response. [@problem_id:2249098]", "problem": "In an immunology research laboratory, a cell line is engineered to express a specific Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I allele. The researchers observe that these cells can successfully process a specific viral protein, load the resulting peptide onto the MHC class I molecules, and transport the stable peptide-MHC complexes to the cell surface. However, when these cells are co-cultured with Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) whose T-cell receptors are specific for this viral peptide-MHC complex, the target cells are not efficiently killed. Further analysis confirms that the issue stems from a single point mutation in the gene encoding the MHC class I heavy chain, which is located in the region that codes for the $\\alpha_3$ domain.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements provides the most direct and specific molecular explanation for the observed failure of CTL-mediated killing?\n\nA. The mutation prevents the viral peptide from binding to the MHC class I molecule's peptide-binding groove.\nB. The mutation disrupts the binding site for the CD8 co-receptor on the CTL.\nC. The mutation causes the $\\beta_2$-microglobulin subunit to dissociate from the MHC class I heavy chain, leading to an unstable complex on the cell surface.\nD. The mutation inhibits the transport of peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum.\nE. The mutation directly alters the primary binding site for the T-cell receptor on the MHC-peptide complex.", "solution": "MHC class I heavy chain comprises three extracellular domains: $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ form the peptide-binding groove and provide the principal surface for T-cell receptor engagement, while $\\alpha_3$ is an Ig-like domain that serves as the binding site for the CD8 co-receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The complex is stabilized by noncovalent association with $\\beta_2$-microglobulin, and peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP for loading. Effective CTL-mediated killing requires not only TCR recognition of the peptide–MHC complex but also CD8 co-receptor binding to the $\\alpha_3$ domain to enhance avidity and recruit Lck for signaling.\n\nThe observations state that peptide processing, loading, and transport to the cell surface occur and that stable peptide–MHC complexes are present. This rules out defects in peptide binding (which depends on the $\\alpha_1$/$\\alpha_2$ groove), TAP-mediated peptide transport, and gross instability due to $\\beta_2$-microglobulin dissociation. The point mutation is localized to the region encoding the $\\alpha_3$ domain. The most direct and specific consequence of an $\\alpha_3$-domain mutation that preserves peptide loading and surface stability is disruption of CD8 binding. Loss of CD8 engagement would weaken the overall interaction between CTLs and target cells and impair signal transduction necessary for cytotoxic function, explaining inefficient killing despite TCR specificity for the presented peptide–MHC.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is inconsistent with an $\\alpha_3$ mutation and with the observed stable surface peptide–MHC complexes, since peptide binding is mediated by $\\alpha_1$/$\\alpha_2$.\n- Option B matches the known role of the $\\alpha_3$ domain as the CD8 binding site and directly explains the functional deficit.\n- Option C contradicts the observation of stable complexes at the cell surface; $\\beta_2$-microglobulin dissociation would destabilize the complex.\n- Option D is excluded by the successful peptide processing and loading.\n- Option E is unlikely because the primary TCR contact residues lie in the $\\alpha_1$/$\\alpha_2$ domains and the peptide, not $\\alpha_3$.\n\nThus, the most direct and specific molecular explanation is disruption of the CD8 co-receptor binding site on the $\\alpha_3$ domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2249098"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable ability of the immune system to recognize a vast array of pathogens hinges on the polymorphism of the MHC peptide-binding groove.

This chimeric protein is assembled by combining domains from two distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles, each known for its unique peptide binding preferences.\n\nThe structural foundation of the peptide-binding groove, specifically the eight-stranded anti-parallel $\\beta$-sheet that forms its floor, is derived from the allele **HLA-A\\*02:01**. In its native form, HLA-A\\*02:01 preferentially binds 9-mer peptides that have a strong anchor-residue requirement for a large aliphatic amino acid, either **Leucine (L)** or **Methionine (M)**, at position 2 (p2) of the peptide.\n\nConversely, the super-domain forming the walls of the peptide-binding groove, which consists of the two long $\\alpha$-helices, is derived from the allele **HLA-B\\*27:05**.

The chimeric construct would be non-functional or would bind peptides promiscuously, with no discernible preference for specific anchor residues at position 2 or the C-terminus.", "solution": "We identify the structural determinants of MHC class I peptide-binding specificity as arising from discrete pockets in the groove, especially pocket B (accepting the residue at $p2$) and pocket F (accepting the C-terminal residue at $p9$). These pockets are formed by polymorphic residues contributed by both the $\\beta$-sheet floor and the flanking $\\alpha$-helices; however, the floor residues critically shape the base and depth of pockets, while the helices contribute side walls and key interactions that define residue chemistry and size preferences.\n\nBy construction, the chimeric molecule has:\n- The $\\beta$-sheet floor from HLA-A*02:01, which in the native allele specifies a pocket B that strongly prefers a large aliphatic residue at $p2$, namely Leucine (L) or Methionine (M). Retaining the floor from HLA-A*02:01 is expected to preserve this $p2$ anchor preference, because the principal geometry and hydrophobic character of pocket B are set by the floor residues characteristic of HLA-A*02:01.\n- The $\\alpha$-helical walls from HLA-B*27:05, which in the native allele define an F pocket that enforces a positively charged C-terminal anchor, here specified as Arginine (R) at $p9$. Substituting the helices from HLA-B*27:05 is expected to transfer this F-pocket chemistry, thereby favoring an arginine C-terminus.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible combined motif is the $p2$ anchor from HLA-A*02:01 (L/M) together with the C-terminal anchor from HLA-B*27:05 (R). Evaluating the options:\n- A retains the HLA-A*02:01 C-terminal hydrophobic preference, which is inconsistent with adopting the HLA-B*27:05 helices that would shift the F pocket toward a basic preference.\n- B proposes a small residue at $p2$, which contradicts the known HLA-A*02:01 pocket B requirement for a large aliphatic residue.\n- C combines $p2$ L/M with C-terminal R, matching the chimeric domain logic above.\n- D inverts the anchors, assigning the $p2$ Arg characteristic of HLA-B*27:05 to a chimera whose floor (dominating pocket B) derives from HLA-A*02:01; this is inconsistent.\n- E contradicts the stated assumption that the chimera folds into a functional, peptide-presenting conformation.\n\nHence, the correct prediction is $p2$ Leucine or Methionine and $p9$ Arginine, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249099"}]}
