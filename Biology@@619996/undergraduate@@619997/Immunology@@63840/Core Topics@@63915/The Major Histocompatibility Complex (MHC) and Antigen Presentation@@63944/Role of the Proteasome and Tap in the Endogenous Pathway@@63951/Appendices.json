[@problem_id:2266927]", "problem": "A team of immunologists is studying the cellular response to a novel intracellular bacterium. In their experimental model using human macrophages, they observe that infected cells are effectively recognized and destroyed by Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). To better understand the mechanism of antigen presentation, the researchers treat a culture of infected macrophages with a specific chemical agent, Lactacystin, which is known to covalently modify and irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of the proteasome.\n\nAssuming the drug rapidly permeates the cells and takes effect, what is the most immediate and direct consequence of this treatment on the endogenous pathway for presenting bacterial antigens?\n\nA. The synthesis of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum is inhibited.\n\nB. The recognition of infected cells by CTLs is paradoxically enhanced.\n\nC.

The canonical sequence of steps can be summarized as:\n$$\n\\text{Cytosolic proteins} \\xrightarrow[\\text{proteasome}]{\\text{ubiquitin}} \\text{short peptides} \\xrightarrow[\\text{TAP}]{\\text{transport}} \\text{ER} \\xrightarrow[\\text{tapasin, chaperones}]{\\text{MHC I loading}} \\text{Golgi} \\to \\text{cell surface } (p\\text{MHC I}).\n$$\nThe proteasome is the catalytic machinery that cleaves ubiquitin-tagged cytosolic proteins into short peptides of appropriate length for MHC class I binding. Lactacystin covalently and irreversibly inhibits the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Therefore, the most immediate and direct consequence of adding lactacystin is the blockade of proteasomal proteolysis in the cytosol. This prevents the generation of the short peptide fragments required for TAP-dependent transport into the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent MHC class I loading.\n\nBy contrast, the synthesis of MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum is not directly inhibited (eliminating option A). TAP is not the target of lactacystin and is not allosterically inhibited by it (eliminating option C). Recognition by CTLs would be diminished, not enhanced, because fewer peptideâ€“MHC class I complexes reach the surface (eliminating option B). Although reduced peptide availability can secondarily impair export of stable peptide-loaded MHC class I from the endoplasmic reticulum, lactacystin does not directly block the ER-to-Golgi export machinery, nor does it do so regardless of peptide-binding status (eliminating option E). Hence, the immediate, direct effect is the blockade of cytosolic peptide generation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the generation of short peptide fragments from bacterial proteins in the cytosol is blocked.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2266927"}, {"introduction": "Cellular transport against a concentration gradient requires energy, and the immune system is no exception. This practice problem uses a thought experiment involving the depletion of cellular energy, in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate ($ATP$), to investigate its effect on the endogenous pathway.

[@problem_id:2266945]", "problem": "An immunologist is studying the endogenous antigen presentation pathway in a human cell line. These cells are treated with a novel drug, \"Apyrasin,\" which has been shown to rapidly and completely deplete all intracellular stores of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) without immediately causing cell death. The researcher plans to measure the number of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of these cells after a few hours of treatment with Apyrasin.\n\nAssuming the cells had a normal level of surface MHC class I expression before the treatment, which of the following outcomes is the most likely prediction, and for the correct reason?\n\nA. Expression will remain unchanged, because the proteasome, the primary source of antigenic peptides, functions independently of ATP.\n\nB.

Expression will significantly decrease, because the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), which moves peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, requires ATP to function.\n\nD. Expression will significantly decrease, because the process of protein ubiquitination, which targets proteins for degradation into peptides, requires ATP.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of complete intracellular ATP depletion on the surface expression of MHC class I molecules. To do this, we must analyze the key steps of the endogenous antigen presentation pathway and identify which of them are ATP-dependent.\n\nThe endogenous pathway is responsible for presenting peptides derived from intracellular proteins on the cell surface via MHC class I molecules. This allows the immune system, specifically CD8$^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to monitor the health of the cell. The pathway proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Protein Degradation:** Intracellular proteins (e.g., normal self-proteins, viral proteins, or mutated cancer proteins) are targeted for degradation. This often involves tagging them with ubiquitin, a process that is itself ATP-dependent. The tagged proteins are then unfolded and fed into the proteasome, a large protein complex that cleaves them into small peptides.\n\n2.  **Peptide Transport:** The resulting peptides are located in the cytoplasm. To be loaded onto MHC class I molecules, they must be transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This transport is mediated by the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). TAP is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, meaning it actively pumps peptides across the ER membrane, a process that is strictly dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP for energy.\n\n3.  **MHC Class I Assembly and Loading:** Inside the ER, newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains associate with a light chain called beta-2 microglobulin ($\\beta_2m$). This partial complex is held in a stable, peptide-receptive state by chaperone proteins (like calreticulin, calnexin, and tapasin), which physically link it to the TAP transporter. When TAP delivers a peptide of the appropriate length and sequence, it binds to the peptide-binding groove of the MHC class I molecule.\n\n4.  **Trafficking to the Surface:** The binding of a peptide stabilizes the entire MHC class I molecule-peptide complex. Only these stable, triple-component complexes are released from the chaperone machinery and are permitted to exit the ER. They then traffic through the Golgi apparatus and are transported in vesicles to the plasma membrane, where they are expressed on the cell surface. MHC class I molecules that fail to bind a peptide are deemed unstable, retained in the ER, and eventually targeted for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of Apyrasin, which completely depletes intracellular ATP.\n\n-   The critical step is the function of the TAP transporter. As an ABC transporter, TAP's ability to move peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER is absolutely dependent on ATP. Without ATP, TAP becomes inactive.\n-   As a consequence, no new peptides can enter the ER lumen.\n-   Although MHC class I heavy chains and $\\beta_2m$ may still be synthesized (until residual energy and precursors run out) and assemble in the ER, they will be unable to find and bind peptides.\n-   These \"empty\" or unstabilized MHC class I molecules will not be released for transport to the cell surface. Instead, they will be degraded.\n-   MHC class I molecules already on the cell surface have a finite half-life and are continuously being internalized and degraded. The surface pool must be constantly replenished by new molecules from the ER-Golgi pathway.\n-   By cutting off the supply of new, stable MHC class I complexes, the overall number of these molecules on the cell surface will inevitably and significantly decrease over a period of a few hours.\n\nTherefore, the depletion of ATP halts the antigen presentation pathway at the crucial peptide transport step, leading to a sharp decline in surface MHC class I expression.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n-   **A. Unchanged, because the proteasome is ATP-independent.** This is incorrect. While the core catalytic activity of the 20S proteasome is ATP-independent, this statement ignores the critically ATP-dependent TAP transporter step that occurs immediately after peptide generation. Without TAP, the peptides are useless for the MHC class I pathway.\n-   **B. Significantly increased, due to a stress response.** This is incorrect. While some cellular stresses can upregulate MHC class I expression, a complete lack of ATP creates a fundamental mechanical block in the presentation pathway. No amount of \"upregulation signal\" can overcome the physical inability of the TAP transporter to function.\n-   **C. Significantly decreased, because the TAP transporter requires ATP.** This is the correct analysis. The inactivation of the ATP-dependent TAP transporter is the most direct and catastrophic failure point in the pathway caused by ATP depletion, preventing peptide loading and subsequent surface expression of stable MHC class I molecules.\n-   **D. Significantly decreased, because ubiquitination requires ATP.** This statement is also mechanistically true. Ubiquitination, which targets many proteins for proteasomal degradation, is an ATP-dependent process. A lack of ATP would reduce the generation of ubiquitinated proteins, thus reducing the substrate for the proteasome and the overall supply of antigenic peptides. However, option C identifies a more immediate and absolute bottleneck. Even if a pool of peptides existed or were generated by ATP-independent means, they could not be used without a functional TAP transporter. Therefore, the failure of TAP is the most critical reason for the halt in the pathway. Option C is the better and more precise answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2266945"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in biological science is designing experiments that can distinguish between different potential causes for an observation.

By predicting the outcome of a radiolabeling experiment, you will learn how to use the distinct functions of the proteasome and TAP to create a clear experimental signature for each defect. [@problem_id:2266930]", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating two mutant human cell lines, designated Line X and Line Y, derived from a common parent cell line. The parent cell line, when infected with Influenza Virus A, is efficiently lysed by virus-specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). However, both Line X and Line Y, when infected with the same virus, are resistant to lysis by these CTLs. This suggests a defect in the endogenous antigen presentation pathway involving Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules.\n\nThe researcher hypothesizes that the defect in Line X is a non-functional proteasome, while the defect in Line Y is a non-functional Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). To test this hypothesis, an experiment is conducted. All three cell lines (Parent, Line X, and Line Y) are infected with Influenza Virus A. After a suitable incubation period to allow for viral protein synthesis, the cells are pulse-labeled for 15 minutes with a medium containing a radiolabeled amino acid, $^{35}$S-methionine. Following the pulse, the cells are immediately lysed, and the cytosolic fraction is carefully isolated, separating it from the nucleus and membrane-bound organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum. The cytosolic extracts are then run on a specialized high-resolution gel that can separate and resolve small peptides (in the range of 8-10 amino acids) from larger proteins. The amount of radioactivity in the small peptide fraction is quantified.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest support for the researcher's hypothesis regarding the defects in Line X and Line Y, compared to the parent cell line?\n\nA.

Line X shows a significant increase in the amount of radiolabeled small peptides in the cytosol, while Line Y shows a significant decrease.\n\nE. Line X and Line Y show amounts of radiolabeled small peptides in the cytosol that are not significantly different from the parent cell line.", "solution": "The endogenous MHC class I antigen presentation pathway relies on two sequential cytosolic-to-ER steps: (i) generation of short peptides of approximately 8 to 10 amino acids from newly synthesized cytosolic proteins by the proteasome, and (ii) transport of these peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP for loading onto MHC class I. Virus-infected parent cells are lysed by CTLs because viral proteins are processed and presented via this pathway.\n\nIn the experiment, after infection and a brief pulse with radiolabeled methionine, the cytosolic small peptide fraction (8 to 10 amino acids) is quantified. The readout isolates the cytosolic compartment only; thus, it reflects the balance between peptide production by the proteasome and removal from the cytosol, primarily by TAP-mediated transport into the ER, as well as any further cytosolic degradation by peptidases.\n\nPredicted outcomes by line:\n- Parent cell line: Proteasome function and TAP function are intact. Viral proteins synthesized during the pulse are degraded by the proteasome into small peptides, which are then transported by TAP into the ER. Thus, the steady-state level of radiolabeled small peptides in the cytosol is limited by both ongoing production and efficient removal into the ER.\n- Line X (hypothesized non-functional proteasome): Without a functional proteasome, newly synthesized viral proteins are not efficiently cleaved into 8 to 10 amino acid peptides. Consequently, the production term for cytosolic small peptides is markedly reduced. Therefore, the amount of radiolabeled small peptides in the cytosol should show a significant decrease relative to the parent.\n- Line Y (hypothesized non-functional TAP): The proteasome is intact, so production of small peptides proceeds normally. However, transport into the ER is blocked, so a major removal route from the cytosol is eliminated. Over the short pulse and immediate lysis, this should increase the steady-state cytosolic pool of radiolabeled small peptides relative to the parent, despite some ongoing cytosolic peptidase degradation. Thus, the most direct prediction is a significant increase in cytosolic small peptides.\n\nComparing these predictions to the answer choices:\n- A predicts increased small peptides in both lines, which contradicts the expected decrease in Line X due to a non-functional proteasome.\n- B predicts a decrease in Line X (consistent with defective proteasome) and an increase in Line Y (consistent with defective TAP blocking removal), which matches the mechanistic expectations.\n- C predicts decreases in both lines, which contradicts the expected increase in Line Y when non-functional.\n- D predicts an increase in Line X, which contradicts a proteasome defect, and a decrease in Line Y, which contradicts a TAP defect.\n- E predicts no significant differences, which does not provide strong support for the stated hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that most strongly supports the hypothesis is that Line X shows a significant decrease and Line Y shows a significant increase in cytosolic radiolabeled small peptides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2266930"}]}
