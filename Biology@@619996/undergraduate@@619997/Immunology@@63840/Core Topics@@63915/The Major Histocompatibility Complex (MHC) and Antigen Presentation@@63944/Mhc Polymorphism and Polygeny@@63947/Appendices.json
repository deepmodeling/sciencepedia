{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The immense diversity of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) system begins within each individual. The principles of polygeny (having multiple distinct MHC genes) and codominant expression (expressing alleles from both parents) work together to equip your cells with a varied set of molecules for presenting peptides. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2249863] provides a tangible way to grasp this concept by asking you to calculate just how many different MHC class I proteins a single person can express, revealing the breadth of an individual's antigen presentation arsenal.", "problem": "The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a group of genes that code for proteins found on the surfaces of cells that help the adaptive immune system recognize foreign molecules. In humans, this gene complex is referred to as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. MHC class I proteins, which are expressed on almost all nucleated cells, are encoded by three highly polymorphic and polygenic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. The term \"polymorphic\" means that there are many different versions, or alleles, of these genes within the human population. The term \"polygenic\" means that there are several different MHC class I genes.\n\nThe expression of HLA genes is codominant, meaning that the protein products from both inherited alleles (one from each parent) at a given gene locus are expressed simultaneously and equally on the cell surface.\n\nConsider an individual who is heterozygous at each of the three classical MHC class I gene loci. This means for the HLA-A gene, they have two different alleles; for the HLA-B gene, they have two different alleles; and for the HLA-C gene, they also have two different alleles. Calculate the total number of different types of MHC class I proteins this individual can express on the surface of their somatic cells.", "solution": "We use the facts that (i) the classical MHC class I proteins on somatic cells are encoded at three distinct loci, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (polygenic), and (ii) expression is codominant at each locus, so both alleles inherited at a locus are expressed as distinct proteins. Heterozygosity at each locus means there are two distinct alleles at each of the three loci.\n\nLabel the loci by $L=\\{A,B,C\\}$. For each locus $\\ell \\in L$, heterozygosity implies $k_{\\ell}=2$ distinct protein products (e.g., HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 for locus A). Since proteins from different loci are, by definition, distinct types (an HLA-A molecule is distinct from an HLA-B or HLA-C molecule), the total number of different types expressed is the sum over loci rather than a product:\n$$\nT=\\sum_{\\ell \\in L} k_{\\ell}=2+2+2=6.\n$$\nNote that the invariant light chain (beta-2 microglobulin) does not alter the count because it is the same for all MHC class I molecules and does not introduce additional distinct types.\n\nTherefore, the individual expresses six different types of MHC class I proteins on their somatic cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2249863"}, {"introduction": "MHC genes are located close together on a chromosome and are typically inherited as a linked block known as a haplotype. This pattern of inheritance has profound real-world consequences, most critically in the context of organ and bone marrow transplantation compatibility. This classic problem [@problem_id:2249815] challenges you to apply the principles of Mendelian genetics to a clinical scenario, calculating the probability of finding a perfect MHC match between siblings. This will solidify your understanding of haplotype inheritance and its direct impact on medical decisions.", "problem": "The success of an organ transplant is critically dependent on the immunological compatibility between the donor and recipient, primarily governed by a set of genes known as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). In humans, these genes are referred to as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. The MHC genes are located very close to each other on a single chromosome and are typically inherited together as a block, referred to as an MHC haplotype. Each individual inherits one haplotype from their father and one from their mother. For a transplant to have the highest chance of success, the donor and recipient must be a \"perfect match,\" meaning they share the exact same pair of MHC haplotypes.\n\nConsider a family where the parents have four unique MHC haplotypes.

This means a T cell receptor recognizes a particular foreign peptide only when it is presented by a specific MHC allele. In this practice [@problem_id:2249816], you will step into the role of a research immunologist by analyzing experimental data from a cytotoxicity assay.

To determine which Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I molecule is responsible for presenting this viral peptide to the CTL clone, the researcher performs an experiment using a panel of five lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), each with a known and different combination of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles.\n\nAll five cell lines (LCL-1, LCL-2, LCL-3, LCL-4, LCL-5) were infected with the Silent Paramyxovirus. Subsequently, a chromium-51 ($^{51}\\text{Cr}$) release assay was conducted. In this assay, the infected target cells are loaded with $^{51}\\text{Cr}$. These cells are then co-cultured with the `CTL-SPV-9` clone. If the CTL clone recognizes the viral peptide presented by an HLA molecule on the target cell surface, it will induce lysis, causing the release of $^{51}\\text{Cr}$.
