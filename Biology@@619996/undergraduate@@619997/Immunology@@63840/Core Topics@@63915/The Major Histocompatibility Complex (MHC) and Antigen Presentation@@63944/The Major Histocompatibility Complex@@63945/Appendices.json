This first practice explores the MHC class I pathway, the system our cells use to display internal peptides for inspection by the immune system. By examining a hypothetical scenario where a key structural component, $\\beta_2$-microglobulin, is missing in cancer cells, you can deduce the direct impact on immune surveillance and appreciate why proper MHC I assembly is critical for eliminating cellular threats [@problem_id:2278308].", "problem": "A team of oncologists is investigating an aggressive form of lung cancer. They isolate a specific cancer cell line from a patient and find that, due to a somatic mutation, these cells do not express the protein $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). Normal, healthy lung cells from the same patient express $\\beta_2$m as expected. The primary role of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is to identify and eliminate cancerous or virally infected cells by recognizing specific antigenic peptides presented on the cell surface.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence of the loss of $\\beta_2$m expression on the interaction between these specific lung cancer cells and the patient's own CTLs?\n\nA. The lack of $\\beta_2$m will enhance the binding of tumor-associated antigens to the T-cell receptor (TCR) on CTLs, leading to a more robust and effective anti-cancer immune response.\nB. The cancer cells will be unable to present endogenous antigens via Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules, rendering them invisible to recognition and attack by CTLs.\nC. The cancer cells will begin to present endogenous antigens using MHC class II molecules instead, causing them to be targeted by CD4+ helper T cells rather than CD8+ CTLs.\nD. The lack of $\\beta_2$m will cause the CTLs to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) upon encountering the cancer cells, thereby weakening the overall immune system.\nE. The cancer cells will secrete soluble $\\beta_2$m, which will act as a decoy to bind and neutralize CTLs before they can reach the tumor site.", "solution": "The key immunological principles are:\n1) MHC class I molecules are heterodimers composed of a polymorphic heavy (alpha) chain and the invariant light chain $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin. Proper folding, stability, peptide loading, and surface expression of MHC class I require $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin.\n2) CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize endogenous antigenic peptides only when presented in the context of MHC class I on the target cell surface. Productive CTL recognition requires a peptide–MHC class I complex engaging the T-cell receptor (TCR), with CD8 co-receptor binding to MHC class I.\n3) Loss of $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin disrupts assembly and stability of MHC class I, preventing proper surface expression of peptide–MHC class I complexes. Antigen processing via the proteasome and transport via TAP may still occur intracellularly, but without functional MHC class I on the surface, peptides are not presented to CTLs.\n\nLogical steps applied to the scenario:\n- The cancer cell line lacks $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin expression, while the patient’s normal lung cells express it.\n- Without $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin, the cancer cells cannot assemble stable MHC class I molecules on their surface.\n- Consequently, these cancer cells cannot present endogenous tumor-associated peptides in the MHC class I context required for recognition by CD8+ CTLs.\n- Therefore, the direct consequence is that the patient’s CTLs cannot recognize or kill these cancer cells via TCR engagement, rendering the tumor cells effectively invisible to CTL-mediated surveillance.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect: absence of $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin diminishes, not enhances, peptide–MHC class I presentation and TCR engagement.\n- B is correct: loss of MHC class I surface expression due to absence of $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin prevents endogenous antigen presentation to CTLs.\n- C is incorrect: loss of $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin does not switch antigen presentation to MHC class II; epithelial tumor cells generally do not upregulate functional MHC class II in this context, and MHC class II does not require $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin.\n- D is incorrect: encountering target cells lacking MHC class I does not induce CTL apoptosis; rather, it prevents CTL recognition.\n- E is incorrect: secretion of soluble $\\beta_{2}$-microglobulin acting as a decoy is not the relevant or typical mechanism here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the direct consequence for CTL interaction is that the cancer cells are not recognized by CTLs due to loss of MHC class I antigen presentation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278308"}, {"introduction": "While MHC class I molecules survey the cell's interior, MHC class II molecules are specialized to present fragments from the extracellular world. The processing pathway for these molecules is distinct and involves several unique chaperone proteins to ensure the correct peptides are loaded. This exercise focuses on the critical role of the invariant chain (Ii) and challenges you to predict the consequences when its processing is disrupted, thereby clarifying the intricate steps of the exogenous antigen presentation pathway [@problem_id:2278290].", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic immunodeficiency disorder. Molecular analysis reveals a mutation in the gene encoding the invariant chain (Ii). The invariant chain is a protein that non-covalently associates with newly synthesized Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules within the endoplasmic reticulum of Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). In a healthy individual, Ii stabilizes the MHC class II heterodimer and directs its transport from the trans-Golgi network to an endocytic compartment. Within this acidic compartment, Ii is progressively degraded by proteases, leaving a small fragment called CLIP in the peptide-binding groove, which is later exchanged for a peptide derived from an extracellular antigen.\n\nThe specific mutation in this patient prevents the proteolytic cleavage of the invariant chain, but does not affect its initial ability to bind to the MHC class II molecule or guide its transport. Which of the following statements describes the most direct and primary consequence of this specific defect on the patient's APCs?\n\nA. The APCs would be unable to present viral peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\nB. MHC class II molecules would be expressed on the cell surface but would be occupied by fragments of the invariant chain, preventing them from presenting peptides from extracellular pathogens.\nC. The APCs would be unable to internalize and process extracellular pathogens through phagocytosis or endocytosis.\nD. MHC class II molecules would be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and would not be expressed on the cell surface.\nE. MHC class I molecules on the APC surface would be loaded with peptides derived from extracellular proteins.", "solution": "In the normal MHC class II pathway, newly synthesized MHC class II alpha and beta chains in the endoplasmic reticulum associate non-covalently with the invariant chain Ii. Ii stabilizes the heterodimer, occupies the peptide-binding groove to prevent premature peptide loading, and contains sorting signals that direct the complex from the trans-Golgi network to an endocytic compartment. In the acidic endosomal compartment, proteases progressively degrade Ii, leaving the small remnant CLIP in the groove. HLA-DM then catalyzes the exchange of CLIP for higher-affinity peptides derived from extracellular antigens, after which peptide-loaded MHC class II is expressed on the cell surface to present to CD4+ T cells.\n\nIn the described mutation, Ii can still bind MHC class II and direct trafficking to the endocytic compartment, but proteolytic cleavage of Ii is prevented. The direct consequence is that the peptide-binding groove remains occupied by Ii (and cannot be trimmed to CLIP), so HLA-DM cannot facilitate exchange for an antigenic peptide. Thus, MHC class II cannot load peptides from extracellular pathogens. Whether or not the complex fully matures through all compartments, the primary and immediate immunologic defect is persistent occupancy of the MHC class II groove by Ii-derived material, blocking exogenous peptide presentation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes is mediated by MHC class I and does not require Ii; that pathway is not directly affected by this mutation.\n- B is correct because preventing Ii cleavage leads to persistent occupancy of the MHC class II groove by Ii-derived material, functionally preventing loading and presentation of peptides from extracellular pathogens; surface expression, when present, would be blocked by Ii or its fragments.\n- C is incorrect because the mutation does not impair endocytosis or phagocytosis; it specifically impairs peptide loading onto MHC class II.\n- D is incorrect because retention in the endoplasmic reticulum would occur if Ii could not bind or could not guide transport; here, binding and trafficking are intact, so ER retention is not expected.\n- E is incorrect because MHC class I peptide loading is not redirected to extracellular peptides by this lesion; cross-presentation is a separate process and is not induced by failure to cleave Ii.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence is that MHC class II molecules would be on the surface occupied by invariant chain–derived material, preventing presentation of extracellular peptides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278290"}, {"introduction": "The immune system is remarkable for its adaptability, often employing sophisticated exceptions to its own general rules. Having established the distinct endogenous (MHC-I) and exogenous (MHC-II) pathways, this final practice introduces the crucial process of cross-presentation. By analyzing how a dendritic cell can present viral antigens from an external source on its MHC class I molecules, you will synthesize your knowledge and understand how the immune system mounts a comprehensive attack against pathogens [@problem_id:2321888].", "problem": "In the adaptive immune system, the presentation of antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules is crucial for activating T-lymphocytes. A fundamental rule is that MHC class I molecules present endogenous antigens (peptides derived from proteins made within the cell, such as viral proteins in an infected cell or mutated self-proteins) to activate CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Conversely, MHC class II molecules present exogenous antigens (peptides from proteins taken up from outside the cell) to activate CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes.\n\nConsider a scenario where a specialized antigen-presenting cell, a Dendritic Cell (DC), encounters cellular debris from a body cell that has undergone apoptosis due to a viral infection. The DC itself is not infected by the virus. To mount an effective immune response, the DC must be able to activate naive CD8+ T-cells, which requires presenting the viral antigens on its MHC class I molecules. This process, where an exogenous antigen is presented on MHC class I, is known as cross-presentation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the primary molecular pathway of cross-presentation that allows the uninfected DC to accomplish this task?\n\nA. The DC internalizes the apoptotic debris via phagocytosis. Viral proteins are transported from the phagosome into the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome. The resulting peptides are then transported into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) and loaded onto newly synthesized MHC class I molecules.\n\nB. The DC internalizes the apoptotic debris via phagocytosis into a phagolysosome. Inside this compartment, viral proteins are degraded into peptides, which are then loaded onto MHC class II molecules. These peptide-MHC class II complexes are then presented on the cell surface to activate the CD8+ T-cells.\n\nC. Residual active virus particles within the apoptotic debris successfully infect the DC. The virus then replicates within the DC's cytoplasm, producing viral proteins that are processed through the standard endogenous pathway and loaded onto MHC class I molecules.\n\nD. The DC captures intact, pre-formed viral peptide-MHC class I complexes directly from the membrane fragments of the dead, virus-infected cell. These captured complexes are then displayed on the DC's own surface without any internal processing.\n\nE. The DC internalizes the apoptotic debris into a phagosome. Viral proteins within the phagosome are processed into peptides. These peptides are then directly transported from the phagosome to the cell surface, where they bind to empty MHC class I molecules that are already present.", "solution": "The problem asks for the correct mechanism of cross-presentation, a process by which a Dendritic Cell (DC) presents exogenous antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules to activate CD8+ T-cells. We must evaluate each option to determine which one accurately describes this pathway.\n\nThe core challenge is to take an antigen that is *exogenous* to the DC (from another dead cell) and route it into the *endogenous* MHC class I pathway. The standard endogenous pathway involves protein degradation in the cytoplasm by the proteasome, transport of peptides into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), and loading onto MHC class I molecules within the ER.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n**Option A:** This option describes the DC taking up the external material (apoptotic debris) through phagocytosis. It then states that the viral proteins are moved from the phagosome into the cytoplasm. This is the crucial step of retro-translocation. Once in the cytoplasm, these now \"cytosolic\" viral proteins are treated like any other endogenous protein: they are ubiquitinated, degraded by the proteasome, and the resulting peptides are transported by TAP into the ER for loading onto MHC class I molecules. This accurately describes the well-established \"cytosolic pathway\" of cross-presentation. This option is a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\n**Option B:** This option correctly describes the standard MHC class II processing pathway. Exogenous antigens are taken into a phagolysosome, degraded, and loaded onto MHC class II molecules. However, the problem specifies the goal is to activate **CD8+ T-cells**. CD8+ T-cells recognize antigens presented on MHC class I, not MHC class II. MHC class II presentation activates CD4+ helper T-cells. Therefore, this option describes a real immunological process but one that does not lead to the required outcome.\n\n**Option C:** This option suggests the DC becomes productively infected. If this were to happen, the viral proteins would indeed be presented on MHC class I through the standard endogenous pathway. However, this is not \"cross-presentation.\" Cross-presentation is specifically the mechanism for presenting antigens from an external source *without* the DC itself becoming infected. While a DC can get infected, this option does not describe the specific process of cross-presentation as requested.\n\n**Option D:** This option describes a phenomenon sometimes called \"cross-dressing,\" where a cell acquires fully formed peptide-MHC complexes from another cell. While this can occur, it is a distinct process from cross-presentation, which involves the active processing of the antigen *within* the DC. Cross-presentation is about the DC generating the peptide-MHC I complex itself from raw antigenic material. This option bypasses all internal processing and loading steps.\n\n**Option E:** This option suggests that peptides are generated in the phagosome and then bind to MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. MHC class I molecules are not typically loaded with peptides at the cell surface; they are loaded in the ER. Empty or unstably loaded MHC class I molecules that reach the surface are generally not functional for T-cell activation in this manner. The loading process is a carefully regulated intracellular event. This description is biologically incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A provides the most accurate and complete description of the primary cross-presentation pathway. It correctly identifies the key steps: uptake of exogenous material, retro-translocation of antigen into the cytoplasm, processing by the proteasome, and transport into the ER for loading onto MHC class I molecules, thereby bridging the exogenous antigen source with the endogenous presentation machinery.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2321888"}]}
