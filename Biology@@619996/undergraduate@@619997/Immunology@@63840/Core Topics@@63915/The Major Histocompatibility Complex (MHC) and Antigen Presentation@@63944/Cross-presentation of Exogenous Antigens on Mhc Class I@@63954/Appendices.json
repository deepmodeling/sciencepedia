In this model, the gene encoding the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) has been selectively deleted only in dendritic cells (DCs). All other cell types, including epithelial cells, have functional TAP proteins. These mice are subsequently infected with a virus that primarily infects respiratory epithelial cells but does not infect DCs or other professional antigen-presenting cells. Despite the infected epithelial cells being capable of expressing viral antigens on their cell surface, the mice fail to mount an effective cytotoxic immune response and cannot clear the infection.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for this immunological failure?\n\nA. The dendritic cells are unable to process and present viral antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules, leading to a failure in activating helper T cells.\n\nB. The infected epithelial cells cannot be recognized and killed by Natural Killer (NK) cells because the lack of TAP in dendritic cells globally suppresses NK cell activity.\n\nC.

The dendritic cells cannot activate naive CD8+ T cells because they are unable to load peptides from the exogenous viral antigens onto their MHC class I molecules.\n\nE. The lack of TAP in dendritic cells prevents them from migrating to the lymph nodes to interact with T cells.", "solution": "The key experimental manipulation is the selective deletion of TAP in dendritic cells (DCs), while all other cells, including respiratory epithelial cells, retain functional TAP. The virus infects epithelial cells but does not infect DCs or other professional antigen-presenting cells.\n\nFirst, consider antigen processing pathways. For the MHC class I pathway, endogenous (cytosolic) proteins are degraded by the proteasome, peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP, loaded onto MHC class I, and displayed to CD8+ T cells. For the MHC class II pathway, exogenous proteins are processed in endosomal/lysosomal compartments and loaded onto MHC class II via the invariant chain/CLIP and HLA-DM; this pathway is independent of TAP.\n\nInfected epithelial cells have functional TAP and therefore can present their endogenous viral peptides on their own MHC class I molecules. However, naive CD8+ T cells are not effectively primed by non-professional APCs such as epithelial cells because these lack necessary costimulatory molecules and do not traffic to lymph nodes to initiate naive T cell activation. Effective priming of naive CD8+ T cells requires DCs presenting antigen on MHC class I with costimulation in secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nBecause the virus does not infect DCs, DCs would need to acquire viral antigens from infected epithelial cells as exogenous material and present them to CD8+ T cells via cross-presentation. The dominant cross-presentation pathway in DCs involves transfer of exogenous antigens into the cytosol, proteasomal degradation, and TAP-dependent transport of the resulting peptides into the ER for loading onto MHC class I. Deletion of TAP specifically in DCs disrupts this cross-presentation pathway, preventing DCs from loading peptides from exogenous viral antigens onto MHC class I and thereby preventing activation (priming) of naive CD8+ T cells. Without primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the host fails to clear the infection despite epithelial cells displaying viral peptides.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because MHC class II processing is TAP-independent; helper T cell activation via MHC class II would not be directly impaired by TAP loss.\n- B is incorrect because TAP deficiency in DCs does not globally suppress NK cell activity; moreover, infected epithelial cells with intact MHC class I are not NK targets.\n- C is incorrect because epithelial cells have functional TAP and can present endogenous viral peptides on MHC class I.\n- D is correct because DCs lacking TAP cannot cross-present exogenous viral antigens on MHC class I and thus cannot activate naive CD8+ T cells.\n- E is incorrect because TAP does not control DC migration to lymph nodes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that TAP-deficient DCs cannot cross-present exogenous viral antigens on MHC class I to prime naive CD8+ T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2222708"}, {"introduction": "In immunology, distinguishing between superficially similar mechanisms is a key analytical skill. This problem introduces \"cross-dressing,\" a fascinating phenomenon where a dendritic cell acquires a pre-formed peptide-MHC complex from another cell, bypassing its own processing machinery. Your task in this exercise [@problem_id:2222694] is to interpret experimental data from a system using different MHC types to definitively tell true cross-presentation apart from cross-dressing, sharpening your skills in experimental design and analysis.", "problem": "In the field of tumor immunology, a Dendritic Cell (DC) can initiate an adaptive immune response against cancerous cells by presenting tumor-derived antigens on its Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) molecules. This presentation activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. This can occur through two distinct mechanisms. The first is classical **cross-presentation**, where the DC engulfs a tumor cell or its fragments, processes the exogenous tumor proteins through its own cytosolic pathway (involving the proteasome and a transporter protein complex), and loads the resulting peptides onto its newly synthesized MHC I molecules. The second mechanism is **cross-dressing**, a form of trogocytosis where the DC physically acquires pre-formed, intact peptide-MHC I complexes directly from the surface of a live tumor cell.\n\nAn immunologist sets up an in-vitro experiment to distinguish between these two pathways.\n- Dendritic Cells are isolated from a mouse strain that has the MHC haplotype $H\\text{-}2^k$.\n- Tumor cells, which are known to express a specific tumor antigen called 'Pembro-Antigen 1' (PA-1), are isolated from a different mouse strain that has the MHC haplotype $H\\text{-}2^d$.\n\nThe $H\\text{-}2^k$ DCs and $H\\text{-}2^d$ tumor cells are co-cultured, allowing for interaction. Afterwards, the DCs are isolated from the culture and their surface molecules are analyzed. Which of the following hypothetical experimental findings would provide the most direct and unambiguous evidence that cross-dressing is the primary mechanism for the presentation of PA-1 by the DCs?\n\nA. The presentation of PA-1 on the DC surface is completely abrogated when the co-culture is treated with an inhibitor of the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP).\n\nB. Following co-culture, the DCs exhibit a significant upregulation in the surface expression of their native $H\\text{-}2^k$ molecules as well as co-stimulatory molecules like CD80 and CD86.\n\nC. Analysis of the isolated DC population reveals that the PA-1 antigen is detected on their surface in a physical complex exclusively with $H\\text{-}2^k$ MHC molecules.\n\nD. Analysis of the isolated DC population reveals that the PA-1 antigen is detected on their surface in a physical complex exclusively with $H\\text{-}2^d$ MHC molecules.\n\nE. Analysis of the tumor cell population after co-culture shows a significant reduction in the surface density of PA-1/$H\\text{-}2^d$ complexes compared to control tumor cells cultured alone.", "solution": "We begin by defining the mechanistic predictions for each pathway given the MHC haplotypes. In cross-presentation, a dendritic cell (DC) of haplotype $H\\text{-}2^{k}$ engulfs exogenous tumor proteins, processes them via the cytosolic pathway, and loads the resulting peptides onto its own newly synthesized MHC I molecules. This pathway is proteasome and TAP dependent, and the resultant peptide-MHC complexes displayed by the DC must be peptide/$H\\text{-}2^{k}$. The DC cannot present peptide on $H\\text{-}2^{d}$ via this mechanism because it does not encode $H\\text{-}2^{d}$.\n\nIn cross-dressing, the DC acquires intact peptide-MHC I complexes pre-formed on the tumor cell surface. Since the tumor cells are $H\\text{-}2^{d}$, cross-dressing would place peptide/$H\\text{-}2^{d}$ complexes on the DC surface. This transfer bypasses the DC’s proteasome and TAP because the peptide is already loaded onto MHC I on the tumor cell. Therefore, a definitive hallmark of cross-dressing in this setup is the presence of $H\\text{-}2^{d}$ MHC I molecules bearing PA-1 on the surface of $H\\text{-}2^{k}$ DCs.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these predictions:\n\nOption A states that a TAP inhibitor abrogates PA-1 presentation. This indicates a dependence on the DC’s antigen-processing and TAP-mediated loading, which supports cross-presentation and argues against cross-dressing. Thus, this is not evidence for cross-dressing.\n\nOption B observes upregulation of $H\\text{-}2^{k}$ and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), a generic signature of DC maturation/activation. This is consistent with either pathway and is not discriminatory.\n\nOption C finds PA-1 exclusively in complex with $H\\text{-}2^{k}$ on DCs. This is exactly the expected outcome of cross-presentation and does not support cross-dressing.\n\nOption D finds PA-1 exclusively in complex with $H\\text{-}2^{d}$ on the DC surface. Because $H\\text{-}2^{k}$ DCs cannot synthesize $H\\text{-}2^{d}$, the only way they could display PA-1/$H\\text{-}2^{d}$ complexes is by physically acquiring intact peptide-MHC I complexes from the $H\\text{-}2^{d}$ tumor cells, i.e., cross-dressing. This provides direct and unambiguous evidence that cross-dressing is the primary mechanism.\n\nOption E notes a reduction of PA-1/$H\\text{-}2^{d}$ on tumor cells after co-culture. While consistent with transfer, it is not specific for cross-dressing and could be due to shedding, internalization, or degradation without proving that DCs display the acquired complexes.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and unambiguous evidence for cross-dressing is the detection of PA-1 exclusively in complex with $H\\text{-}2^{d}$ on the DC surface, as described in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2222694"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative concepts to quantitative analysis, this exercise simulates a common laboratory scenario to measure the efficiency of cross-presentation.

Bone marrow progenitor cells are cultured under two distinct conditions to generate two populations of Bone Marrow-Derived DCs (BMDCs). Population A is generated using Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), while Population B is generated using Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L).\n\nTo assay cross-presentation, a fixed number of DCs from each population ($1 \\times 10^5$ cells) is incubated with an excess of latex beads coated with the protein ovalbumin (OVA). During this incubation, the DCs phagocytose the beads and process the exogenous OVA, presenting a specific peptide fragment, SIINFEKL, on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nFollowing the antigen processing period, a fixed number of B3Z cells ($2 \\times 10^5$ cells) are added to each well. The B3Z cell line is a T-cell hybridoma whose T-Cell Receptor (TCR) specifically recognizes the SIINFEKL peptide bound to the $H\\text{-}2K^b$ MHC class I molecule. Engagement of the B3Z TCR triggers the expression of a *lacZ* reporter gene, leading to the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase. The activity of this enzyme is then quantified by adding a chromogenic substrate, which results in a color change measured as absorbance. The experiment is conducted in identical volumes and for identical incubation times for both DC populations. The final absorbance readings are $0.543$ for Population A (GM-CSF derived) and $0.918$ for Population B (Flt3L derived).\n\nA separate calibration experiment using synthetic SIINFEKL peptide provides a standard curve relating peptide concentration to T-cell activation.
