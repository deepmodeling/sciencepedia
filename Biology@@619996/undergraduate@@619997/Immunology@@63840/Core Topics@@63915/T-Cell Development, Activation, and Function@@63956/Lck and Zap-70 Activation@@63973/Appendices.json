By analyzing the consequences of this specific mutation, you can solidify your understanding of why ITAM phosphorylation by Lck is the non-negotiable prerequisite for recruiting ZAP-70.", "problem": "In cellular immunology, the activation of a T-lymphocyte is a tightly regulated process initiated by the interaction of its T-cell Receptor (TCR) with a peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell. This engagement triggers a signaling cascade involving several key intracellular molecules. The TCR itself has a very short cytoplasmic tail and relies on associated signaling subunits, collectively known as the CD3 complex. These CD3 subunits contain multiple Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs). A critical early step involves the kinase Lck, which is associated with the T-cell co-receptors (CD4 or CD8). Another crucial kinase in this pathway is ZAP-70.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a line of T-cells is genetically engineered. In these modified T-cells, all tyrosine residues within the ITAMs of their CD3 complexes have been mutated to alanine residues. Alanine is an amino acid that cannot be phosphorylated. Assume all other components of the T-cells are normal.\n\nWhen these modified T-cells encounter their specific pMHC, which of the following statements describes the most immediate and direct consequence for the intracellular signaling cascade?\n\nA. The kinase ZAP-70 will be unable to bind to the ITAMs.\n\nB. The T-cell receptor (TCR) will fail to recognize and bind to the pMHC.\n\nC. The kinase Lck will be unable to associate with the co-receptor (CD4 or CD8).\n\nD. The kinase ZAP-70 will phosphorylate its downstream targets without regulation.\n\nE. The kinase Lck will not be brought into proximity of the CD3 complex.", "solution": "The T-cell receptor complex includes CD3 chains containing ITAMs, each with conserved tyrosine residues. Upon TCR engagement with pMHC, the co-receptor (CD4 or CD8) brings the Src-family kinase Lck into proximity with the CD3 complex. Lck phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within ITAMs, generating phosphotyrosine motifs that serve as docking sites for the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70. ZAP-70 binding to doubly phosphorylated ITAMs is a necessary early step that precedes its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets.\n\nIn the engineered T-cells, all ITAM tyrosines are mutated to alanines. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated, so Lck cannot generate phosphotyrosine motifs on ITAMs. Without phosphorylated ITAMs, ZAP-70 cannot bind via its SH2 domains. Thus, the most immediate and direct consequence is the failure of ZAP-70 to bind to ITAMs.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is correct: without phosphorylated tyrosines on ITAMs, ZAP-70 cannot bind.\n- B is incorrect: TCR recognition of pMHC is mediated by the TCR variable domains and is unaffected by cytoplasmic ITAM mutations.\n- C is incorrect: Lck association with CD4/CD8 is intact and independent of ITAM tyrosines.\n- D is incorrect: ZAP-70 requires ITAM binding and activation; it will not phosphorylate downstream targets without proper recruitment and activation.\n- E is incorrect: Co-receptor engagement still brings Lck into proximity; the defect is in substrate phosphorylation, not in localization.\n\nTherefore, the immediate and direct consequence is that ZAP-70 cannot bind to the ITAMs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2243787"}, {"introduction": "Simply bringing a kinase to its target site is often not enough to activate a signaling pathway; the kinase itself must be switched on. This practice [@problem_id:2243743] builds upon the previous concept by examining a more nuanced scenario where ZAP-70 is successfully recruited to the phosphorylated ITAMs but cannot be activated by Lck. This thought experiment allows you to isolate and appreciate the crucial distinction between protein recruitment and catalytic activation, a common theme in signal transduction.", "problem": "In the intricate process of T-cell activation, a precise sequence of phosphorylation events is initiated following the engagement of the T-cell Receptor (TCR) with its cognate peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC). This cascade begins with the Src-family kinase Lck (Lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) phosphorylating Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) on the CD3 complex associated with the TCR. This phosphorylation creates docking sites for another kinase, ZAP-70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70). Once bound, ZAP-70 is itself phosphorylated and activated by Lck. Activated ZAP-70 then propagates the signal by phosphorylating key downstream adaptor proteins, including LAT (Linker for Activation of T-cells) and SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), which are essential for assembling a larger signaling complex.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in a genetically engineered T-cell line where the ZAP-70 protein has been mutated. This mutated ZAP-70 can still bind with normal affinity to the dually phosphorylated ITAMs on the CD3 complex, but it lacks the critical tyrosine residues that are the targets for phosphorylation by Lck. Assuming all other proteins in the signaling pathway are normal and functional, what is the most direct and immediate consequence of this specific mutation on the T-cell signaling cascade upon TCR engagement?\n\nA. Lck will be unable to phosphorylate the ITAMs of the CD3 complex.\n\nB. The formation of the signalosome complex involving LAT and SLP-76 will be impaired due to their lack of phosphorylation.\n\nC. ZAP-70 will be constitutively active, leading to antigen-independent T-cell activation.\n\nD. The TCR will fail to recognize and bind to the pMHC.\n\nE. ZAP-70 will be unable to translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane to bind to the phosphorylated ITAMs.", "solution": "Upon T-cell Receptor (TCR) engagement with peptide-MHC, the canonical sequence is:\n1) Lck phosphorylates tyrosines within ITAMs on the CD3 complex, generating doubly phosphorylated ITAMs.\n2) ZAP-70 binds these doubly phosphorylated ITAMs via its tandem SH2 domains.\n3) Lck phosphorylates key tyrosine residues on ZAP-70, particularly in its activation loop and regulatory sites, which is required for ZAP-70 catalytic activation.\n4) Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates downstream adaptor proteins, notably LAT and SLP-76, enabling assembly of the LAT signalosome and propagation of downstream pathways (PLC-γ1 activation, calcium flux, Ras-MAPK, NF-κB, and NFAT signaling).\n\nIn the hypothetical mutation, ZAP-70 retains normal binding to doubly phosphorylated ITAMs but lacks the critical tyrosine residues that are the targets of Lck phosphorylation. Therefore:\n- Step 1 remains intact: Lck can still phosphorylate ITAMs on CD3, so ZAP-70 docking sites are generated; thus option A is incorrect.\n- Step 2 remains intact: ZAP-70 can still translocate to and bind phosphorylated ITAMs; thus option E is incorrect.\n- Step 3 fails: ZAP-70 cannot be phosphorylated by Lck on its activation tyrosines, preventing its activation; hence ZAP-70 is not constitutively active, making option C incorrect.\n- Consequently, step 4 fails: inactive ZAP-70 cannot phosphorylate LAT and SLP-76, so they remain unphosphorylated and the LAT/SLP-76-centered signalosome does not assemble properly, impairing downstream signaling; TCR recognition of pMHC is unaffected, so option D is incorrect.\n\nThe most direct and immediate consequence is the failure to phosphorylate LAT and SLP-76, impairing formation of the signalosome complex.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2243743"}, {"introduction": "Understanding signaling pathways on paper is one thing, but how do scientists discover these intricate connections in the lab? This final practice [@problem_id:2243721] puts you in the role of an experimental biologist tasked with identifying the partners that bind to ZAP-70 *only* after it becomes an active kinase. By evaluating different experimental setups, you'll learn the importance of proper controls in molecular biology to distinguish cause from correlation and to precisely map protein interaction networks.", "problem": "The activation of a T-cell following T-cell Receptor (TCR) engagement is a tightly regulated process. A critical signaling cascade involves the protein tyrosine kinases Lck and ZAP-70. Upon TCR stimulation, Lck is activated and phosphorylates the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) within the receptor complex. This creates docking sites for ZAP-70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70), which is recruited to the plasma membrane. Once recruited, ZAP-70 is itself phosphorylated by Lck, an event that fully unleashes ZAP-70's catalytic activity, allowing it to phosphorylate downstream substrates and propagate the signal.\n\nA cell biologist aims to identify the specific set of proteins that form a complex with ZAP-70 *only* after ZAP-70 has been catalytically activated by Lck. The goal is to distinguish these activation-dependent partners from proteins that might bind to ZAP-70 as soon as it is recruited to the ITAMs, but before its full activation. The biologist has access to a T-cell line that naturally lacks both Lck and ZAP-70, as well as plasmids to express wild-type or mutant versions of these proteins tagged with a FLAG epitope for immunoprecipitation. They will use immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the interacting proteins.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs is the most appropriate for achieving this specific goal?\n\nA. Compare two populations of wild-type T-cells. One population is left unstimulated, while the other is stimulated via its TCR. Perform IP for endogenous ZAP-70 in both populations and identify proteins enriched in the stimulated sample by MS.\n\nB. Use the Lck/ZAP-70 deficient T-cell line. In one sample, co-express FLAG-tagged wild-type ZAP-70 and wild-type Lck. In a second sample, co-express a FLAG-tagged mutant ZAP-70 (with non-functional SH2 domains that cannot bind to ITAMs) and wild-type Lck. Stimulate both samples via the TCR. Perform IP with anti-FLAG antibodies and identify proteins present only in the first sample by MS.\n\nC. Use the Lck/ZAP-70 deficient T-cell line. In one sample, co-express FLAG-tagged wild-type ZAP-70 and wild-type Lck. In a second sample, co-express FLAG-tagged wild-type ZAP-70 and a catalytically inactive (\"kinase-dead\") mutant of Lck.

The design must therefore compare ZAP-70 complexes under two conditions that are identical in ZAP-70 expression and TCR engagement but differ specifically in whether Lck can catalytically activate ZAP-70, while immunoprecipitating ZAP-70 to profile its interactors.\n\nKey requirements:\n1) Use a cellular background lacking endogenous Lck and ZAP-70 to avoid confounding by native kinases and receptors, enabling controlled reconstitution.\n2) Express FLAG-tagged ZAP-70 so that the IP specifically captures ZAP-70-containing complexes.\n3) Keep TCR stimulation constant across conditions to ensure comparable recruitment to ITAMs.\n4) Alter only Lck catalytic activity so that differences in ZAP-70 interactors reflect activation-dependent associations, not mere recruitment.\n\nEvaluation of options:\nA. Comparing unstimulated versus stimulated wild-type T cells with endogenous ZAP-70 enriches both recruitment-dependent and activation-dependent interactors in the stimulated condition and cannot isolate activation dependence. Endogenous background adds confounders. Not appropriate.\n\nB. Comparing wild-type ZAP-70 plus wild-type Lck versus a ZAP-70 SH2 mutant (cannot bind ITAMs) plus wild-type Lck removes ZAP-70 recruitment entirely in the mutant condition. Differences would reflect both recruitment and activation and cannot distinguish activation-dependent partners from recruitment-only binders. Not appropriate.\n\nC. Comparing wild-type ZAP-70 plus wild-type Lck versus wild-type ZAP-70 plus kinase-dead Lck under identical TCR stimulation and immunoprecipitating FLAG-ZAP-70 holds ZAP-70 expression and TCR engagement constant while making Lck catalytic activity the defining difference. Proteins enriched with wild-type Lck represent those requiring Lck-mediated catalytic activation of ZAP-70. This directly addresses the stated goal and is the most appropriate design among the options.\n\nD. Omitting TCR stimulation and using constitutively active Lck versus no Lck compares conditions lacking both recruitment and activation to conditions with nonphysiological activation. Differences conflate recruitment and activation and are context-mismatched. Not appropriate.\n\nE. Immunoprecipitating FLAG-Lck rather than FLAG-ZAP-70 profiles Lck complexes, not specifically ZAP-70 complexes, and again confounds recruitment. Not appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the design that best isolates activation-dependent ZAP-70 interactors while controlling for recruitment is to use the Lck/ZAP-70-deficient line, co-express FLAG-tagged wild-type ZAP-70 with either wild-type Lck or kinase-dead Lck, stimulate via the TCR, immunoprecipitate FLAG-ZAP-70, and identify proteins enriched in the wild-type Lck condition by mass spectrometry.\n\nConclusion: Option C is the most appropriate experimental design to achieve the goal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2243721"}]}
