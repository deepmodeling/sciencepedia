This process, however, is not simple digestion; it requires a precisely controlled biochemical environment. This practice problem invites you to explore the critical role of lysosomal acidification in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation pathway, connecting a specific molecular event—the function of a proton pump—to the large-scale outcome of T cell immunity. [@problem_id:2263421]", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent and severe infections caused by extracellular bacteria. Laboratory analysis reveals that the patient's macrophages have a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the V-type H+ ATPase. This protein is a proton pump normally found in the membrane of lysosomes, responsible for maintaining their low internal pH.\n\nWhich of the following immunological functions would be most directly and significantly impaired as a consequence of this specific defect in the patient's macrophages?\n\nA. The ability of the macrophage to recognize and engulf bacteria via phagocytosis.\n\nB. The presentation of antigenic peptides derived from cytosolic viral proteins on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nC. The presentation of antigenic peptides derived from phagocytosed extracellular bacteria on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules.\n\nD. The synthesis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), upon bacterial recognition.\n\nE. The ability of the macrophage to migrate towards chemical signals (chemotaxis) released at the site of infection.", "solution": "The $V$-type $H^{+}$-ATPase in lysosomal and phagolysosomal membranes actively transports $H^{+}$ into the lumen, establishing and maintaining a low intraluminal pH. A loss-of-function mutation in this pump prevents acidification of endosomes, lysosomes, and phagolysosomes.\n\nLow pH is essential for:\n- Activation and optimal function of acid-dependent hydrolases and proteases (e.g., cathepsins) that degrade internalized proteins.\n- Degradation of the invariant chain (Ii) to CLIP in the MHC class II pathway, a process mediated by acid-dependent proteases.\n- Efficient peptide loading onto MHC class II in the late endosome/MIIC compartment, facilitated by HLA-DM in an acidic environment.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant immunological impairment is in the MHC class II antigen processing and presentation pathway for exogenous (phagocytosed) antigens. Without acidification, phagocytosed bacterial proteins are poorly degraded into peptides, Ii is not properly removed, and peptide loading onto MHC class II is inefficient, resulting in diminished presentation to CD4+ T cells.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Recognition and engulfment of bacteria (option A) occur via surface receptors and opsonins and precede acidification; this step is not directly dependent on lysosomal pH.\n- MHC class I presentation of cytosolic viral peptides (option B) uses the proteasome, TAP transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, and loading onto MHC class I independently of lysosomal acidification.\n- Cytokine synthesis and secretion (option D), such as TNF-alpha production after bacterial recognition, are primarily driven by receptor signaling and transcriptional pathways; while certain endosomal TLRs require acidification, the key responses to extracellular bacteria (e.g., via TLR2 and TLR4 at the plasma membrane) and the general cytokine production machinery are not directly dependent on lysosomal acidification.\n- Chemotaxis (option E) depends on cytoskeletal dynamics and chemokine receptor signaling, not on lysosomal pH.\n\nThus, the defect most directly compromises presentation of peptides from phagocytosed extracellular bacteria on MHC class II molecules.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263421"}, {"introduction": "Successfully presenting an antigenic peptide on an MHC molecule is only half the story of T cell activation. To prevent dangerous, uncontrolled immune responses against our own tissues, the activation of a naive T cell is a tightly guarded event that requires a crucial second confirmation signal from the APC. This thought experiment probes the famous \"two-signal model\" of lymphocyte activation. By examining a scenario where the first signal is delivered without the second, you will uncover the elegant mechanism of clonal anergy, a fundamental state of tolerance that maintains immune homeostasis. [@problem_id:2263414]", "problem": "The activation of a naive T lymphocyte is a critical event in initiating an adaptive immune response. This process is governed by a \"two-signal\" model. Signal 1 is provided by the T Cell Receptor (TCR) binding to a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 2 is a costimulatory signal, typically involving the interaction of the CD28-receptor on the T cell with a B7 family molecule (such as CD80 or CD86) on the APC.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving a specialized professional APC, such as a dendritic cell. This APC successfully engulfs, processes, and presents an exogenous peptide antigen on its MHC Class II molecules, providing a perfect Signal 1 to a naive CD4+ T cell that recognizes this specific peptide-MHC complex. However, due to a specific cellular defect, this APC completely fails to upregulate the expression of B7 molecules on its surface. What is the most likely fate of the naive T cell upon this interaction?\n\nA. The T cell will undergo robust clonal expansion and differentiate into an effector helper T cell.\n\nB. The T cell will immediately undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.\n\nC. The T cell will become anergic, entering a state of long-lived functional unresponsiveness.\n\nD. The T cell will differentiate into a memory T cell without first becoming an effector cell.\n\nE. The T cell will switch its specificity and recognize a different antigen.", "solution": "The activation of naive T cells is a tightly regulated process that prevents inappropriate immune responses, such as those directed against self-antigens. The \"two-signal hypothesis\" is central to understanding this regulation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the signals delivered to the T cell.**\nThe problem states that the Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) successfully presents the antigen via its Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule. A naive CD4+ T cell with a corresponding T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognizes this complex. This interaction constitutes **Signal 1**. The problem also explicitly states that due to a defect, the APC fails to upregulate B7 molecules. B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on the APC bind to the CD28 receptor on the T cell to provide **Signal 2**. Therefore, in this scenario, the T cell receives Signal 1 but does not receive Signal 2.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the two-signal model of T cell activation.**\nThe rules of the two-signal model are as follows:\n-   **Signal 1 + Signal 2:** Leads to full T cell activation, proliferation (clonal expansion), and differentiation into effector and memory cells.\n-   **Signal 1 alone (without Signal 2):** Does not lead to activation. Instead, it induces a state of tolerance known as clonal anergy.\n-   **Signal 2 alone (without Signal 1):** Has no effect on the T cell.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the outcome based on the delivered signals.**\nSince the T cell receives Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2, it will not be activated. Instead, it will be driven into a state of **clonal anergy**. An anergic T cell is not deleted (it does not die via apoptosis immediately), but it becomes functionally unresponsive. If this anergic cell later encounters an APC providing both Signal 1 and Signal 2, it will still fail to mount an effective response. This mechanism is a crucial way the immune system maintains peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, as self-reactive T cells might encounter self-antigens on tissue cells that lack costimulatory B7 molecules.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n-   **A. The T cell will undergo robust clonal expansion and differentiate into an effector helper T cell.** This is incorrect. This outcome requires both Signal 1 and Signal 2.\n-   **B. The T cell will immediately undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.** While apoptosis is a mechanism of tolerance, anergy is the classic and primary outcome for a naive T cell receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2. Activation-induced cell death is a different process that typically occurs after a T cell has already been activated.\n-   **C. The T cell will become anergic, entering a state of long-lived functional unresponsiveness.** This is the correct outcome according to the two-signal model for T cell activation.\n-   **D. The T cell will differentiate into a memory T cell without first becoming an effector cell.** This is incorrect. Memory cell formation is a consequence of a successful primary activation (requiring both signals), where a subset of expanded effector cells differentiates into long-lived memory cells.\n-   **E. The T cell will switch its specificity and recognize a different antigen.** This is incorrect. The specificity of the TCR is fixed by V(D)J recombination during T cell development in the thymus and does not change upon antigen encounter in the periphery.\n\nTherefore, the interaction described induces a state of clonal anergy in the naive T cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263414"}, {"introduction": "While we group dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells as \"professional\" APCs, they are not interchangeable; each has a specialized role shaped by its unique biology. This advanced problem challenges you to compare how a B cell and a dendritic cell handle the same viral antigen. You will analyze how their distinct methods of antigen uptake—the B cell's highly specific receptor versus the dendritic cell's indiscriminate sampling—dramatically affect the efficiency and composition of the peptides they ultimately present, revealing the sophisticated division of labor within the immune system. [@problem_id:2263397]", "problem": "An immunologist is studying the adaptive immune response to a novel, complex virus. This virus possesses an outer lipid envelope embedded with various glycoproteins, an underlying protein capsid, and a core containing its genetic material along with several viral enzymes. Two primary types of professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) are being compared:\n\n1.  A naive B lymphocyte with a B-Cell Receptor (BCR) that binds with high affinity to a specific epitope on one of the viral envelope glycoproteins, designated GP-12. Upon binding, the B cell internalizes the entire virus particle through receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n2.  A conventional dendritic cell (DC) that resides in the tissue where the infection is occurring. The DC internalizes the same virus non-specifically through macropinocytosis, engulfing extracellular fluid containing viral particles.\n\nBoth cell types subsequently process the internalized virions within their endo-lysosomal pathways and present the resulting peptides on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules to activate naive CD4+ T helper cells.\n\nAssuming both cells successfully internalize at least one intact virion, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the difference in the peptide repertoire presented on the MHC class II molecules of the B cell versus the DC?\n\nA. The B cell will present a peptide repertoire almost exclusively derived from the GP-12 glycoprotein, as this was the protein recognized by its BCR. The DC will present a broad repertoire of peptides derived from all structural proteins of the virus (glycoproteins, capsid, and core proteins).\n\nB. Due to the high efficiency of antigen capture via its specific BCR, the B cell will present a broad and robust repertoire of peptides derived from all components of the virion, including envelope, capsid, and core proteins. The DC will also present a broad repertoire, but the B cell can achieve this presentation at a much lower ambient concentration of the virus.\n\nC. The DC, being the most potent professional APC, will present a significantly broader and more diverse repertoire of viral peptides than the B cell. The B cell's presentation will be limited because its primary function is antibody production, not broad T cell activation.\n\nD. Both the B cell and the DC will present a virtually identical, broad repertoire of peptides derived from all viral proteins. The initial mechanism of uptake (receptor-mediated vs. macropinocytosis) has no significant impact on the final composition of the presented peptides, as the downstream processing pathways are the same.\n\nE. The B cell will present peptides from the GP-12 glycoprotein, while the DC will present peptides from all external proteins (glycoproteins and capsid). Neither cell type will be able to present peptides from the internal viral core proteins on MHC class II, as this pathway is reserved for exogenous antigens.", "solution": "Both the naive B cell and the conventional dendritic cell (DC) take up intact virions into endo-lysosomal compartments, where exogenous proteins are proteolytically processed and loaded onto MHC class II; thus, in principle, any protein contained within the internalized virion (envelope glycoproteins, capsid proteins, and internal core proteins/enzymes) can yield peptides for MHC class II presentation. The exogenous/endosomal pathway does not exclude internal virion proteins once the particle is internalized and degraded.\n\nAntigen capture mechanisms differ:\n- B cells use high-affinity, specific BCR-mediated endocytosis that selectively concentrates antigens bearing the recognized epitope. When the BCR binds GP-12 on the virion, the entire virion is internalized, so all virion components are available for processing. This leads to a peptide repertoire that can include peptides from GP-12 as well as other proteins physically associated in the same particle (linked recognition), enabling presentation of a broad set of peptides from the captured virion, even at low ambient antigen concentrations.\n- DCs use macropinocytosis here, a non-specific, less concentrated uptake of extracellular material. Given successful internalization of at least one intact virion, DCs will process and present peptides from all virion components as well, yielding a broad repertoire.\n\nTherefore:\n- Statement A is incorrect because B cells do not present “almost exclusively” GP-12 peptides; they can present peptides from multiple viral proteins derived from the internalized virion.\n- Statement B is correct: both B cells and DCs can present a broad repertoire from the entire virion, but BCR-mediated capture allows B cells to achieve effective presentation at much lower antigen concentrations.\n- Statement C is incorrect: DC potency refers to costimulation and priming efficiency, not necessarily a broader peptide repertoire than a B cell that has internalized the same complex antigen.\n- Statement D is incorrect: uptake mechanism affects which antigens are captured and the efficiency of presentation; the repertoires are not guaranteed to be identical.\n- Statement E is incorrect: internal core proteins of an internalized virion are processed in endo-lysosomes and can be presented on MHC class II.\n\nHence, the most accurate prediction is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2263397"}]}
