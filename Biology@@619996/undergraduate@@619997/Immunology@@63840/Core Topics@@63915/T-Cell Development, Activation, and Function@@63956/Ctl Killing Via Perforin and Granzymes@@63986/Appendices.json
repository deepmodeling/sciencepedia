This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario involving non-functional perforin to challenge you to think critically about its essential function as a delivery system for granzymes. By analyzing this specific defect, you can solidify your understanding of why the perforin-granzyme pathway is a crucial two-step process in cellular immunity. [@problem_id:2223227]", "problem": "A patient presents with a rare immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by a genetic mutation that renders the protein perforin completely non-functional. Perforin is a key effector molecule used by cytotoxic immune cells. Researchers isolate Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) from this patient to study their function in vitro. These CTLs are mixed with virus-infected target cells that they are primed to recognize. Upon recognition, the patient's CTLs successfully form an immunological synapse with the target cells and undergo degranulation, releasing their granule contents, including the non-functional perforin and fully functional granzymes, into the narrow space between the two cells.\n\nGranzymes are a class of serine proteases that, once they enter the cytoplasm of a target cell, trigger a molecular cascade that culminates in apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.\n\nConsidering the specific molecular defect in this patient's CTLs, which of the following statements best describes the most likely immediate fate of the virus-infected target cell after the degranulation event?\n\nA. The target cell will undergo apoptosis because the released granzymes are sufficient to initiate the death cascade.\n\nB. The target cell will survive the encounter because granzymes cannot enter the cell to initiate apoptosis.\n\nC. The target cell will immediately lyse due to the direct enzymatic action of granzymes on the external surface of its plasma membrane.\n\nD. The target cell will swell and burst from osmotic shock because the non-functional perforin still binds to and disrupts the membrane's integrity.", "solution": "We analyze the cytotoxic granule-mediated killing pathway used by Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). Upon recognition of a target, CTLs form an immunological synapse and degranulate, releasing perforin and granzymes into the synaptic cleft. The key mechanistic steps are:\n1) Perforin function: Perforin polymerizes in the target cell plasma membrane to form pores. These pores are required for the efficient translocation of granzymes from the synaptic cleft into the target cell cytosol. In addition, granzymes can be endocytosed via receptors, but typically require perforin-mediated disruption of endosomal membranes to access the cytosol.\n2) Granzyme function: Granzymes are serine proteases that induce apoptosis only after they reach the cytosol of the target cell, where they activate caspases and other substrates to trigger the apoptotic cascade.\n\nGiven the patient’s mutation renders perforin completely non-functional, the following consequences ensue:\n- Granzymes released into the synaptic cleft cannot access the target cell cytosol via perforin-formed pores, because such pores do not form.\n- Although granzymes may be internalized into endosomes, the absence of functional perforin prevents endosomal escape into the cytosol, so the apoptotic program is not initiated by the granule pathway.\n- Granzymes do not act on the external surface of the plasma membrane to cause lysis; their apoptotic activity is intracellular.\n- Non-functional perforin will not bind and disrupt membrane integrity in a way that produces osmotic lysis.\n\nTherefore, immediately after degranulation in this specific defect, the most likely fate of the virus-infected target cell is survival, because granzymes cannot enter the cytosol to initiate apoptosis via the granule exocytosis pathway. Alternative death pathways such as FasL-Fas can exist but are not part of the granzyme-perforin mechanism described and are not the focus of the immediate consequence of the degranulation event in this setting.\n\nThus, among the options provided, the correct statement is that the target cell will survive the encounter because granzymes cannot enter the cell to initiate apoptosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2223227"}, {"introduction": "Scientific understanding is built not just on theory, but on measurement, and this practice problem introduces the classic Chromium-51 release assay. This technique is a cornerstone for quantifying the killing activity of CTLs, and by understanding what the release of radioactive ⁵¹Cr indicates, you will learn to connect the abstract concept of pore formation to a concrete, measurable experimental outcome. This exercise will strengthen your ability to interpret foundational data in cellular immunology. [@problem_id:2223224]", "problem": "In an immunology laboratory, a standard cytotoxicity assay is performed to measure the effectiveness of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) in killing virus-infected target cells. The protocol begins by incubating the target cells with a solution of radioactive Sodium Chromate (⁵¹CrO₄). During this incubation, the chromate anion is taken up by the cells and intracellularly reduced, causing the Chromium-51 (⁵¹Cr) to become trapped within the cytoplasm by binding to proteins. After this loading step, the cells are washed to remove any extracellular ⁵¹Cr. Finally, the ⁵¹Cr-loaded target cells are co-cultured with the CTLs. After a specific time, the culture medium (supernatant) is collected, and its radioactivity is measured.\n\nWhat does the measurement of radioactive ⁵¹Cr in the supernatant most directly and immediately indicate about the events occurring to the target cells?\n\nA. Formation of pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, leading to lysis.\n\nB. Activation of the caspase cascade initiating apoptosis within the target cell.\n\nC. Engagement of the Fas ligand (FasL) on the CTL with the Fas receptor on the target cell.\n\nD. Secretion of antiviral cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), by the CTLs.\n\nE. Phagocytosis of the target cells by the CTLs.", "solution": "The assay loads target cells with Chromium-51 that becomes trapped by binding intracellular proteins. After washing, any radioactivity detected in the supernatant must have come from intracellular Chromium-51 that escaped the cell. Therefore, the measured supernatant radioactivity is a direct readout of loss of plasma membrane integrity by the target cells.\n\nCytotoxic T lymphocytes kill through two principal mechanisms: the perforin/granzyme pathway and the FasL–Fas pathway. In the perforin/granzyme pathway, perforin forms pores in the target cell plasma membrane, which both allows granzyme entry and compromises membrane integrity, leading to leakage of cytosolic contents and lysis. This pore formation and consequent membrane damage cause immediate release of intracellular Chromium-51 into the supernatant, which is exactly what the assay detects.\n\nBy contrast, FasL engagement of Fas initiates apoptosis via caspase activation, a process that preserves membrane integrity until late stages; thus, it does not immediately cause release of Chromium-51. Similarly, secretion of cytokines by CTLs does not disrupt target cell membranes, and CTLs do not phagocytose target cells. Hence, the most direct and immediate event indicated by increased Chromium-51 in the supernatant is pore formation in the target cell membrane leading to lysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2223224"}, {"introduction": "A key aspect of immunology is understanding not only how a mechanism works, but also *when* it is deployed by the immune system. This problem challenges you to consider why a powerful CTL is ineffective against certain intracellular pathogens that reside within macrophage phagosomes. Solving this requires you to integrate your knowledge of CTL killing with the fundamental principles of antigen processing and presentation on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I versus MHC Class II molecules, explaining the precise rules of T-cell engagement. [@problem_id:2223223]", "problem": "Certain pathogenic bacteria, such as those from the *Mycobacterium* genus, have evolved mechanisms to survive and replicate within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. The host's adaptive immune system relies on T-lymphocytes to control such intracellular infections. Considering the distinct roles and antigen presentation pathways required to activate different T-cell subsets, what is the primary immunological reason that Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), which are CD8-positive T-cells, are generally ineffective at directly eliminating macrophages infected with these phagosome-resident bacteria?\n\nA. CTLs are biologically incapable of recognizing and killing macrophages, as their primary targets are non-phagocytic cells like virally-infected epithelial cells.\n\nB. The perforin and granzyme molecules that constitute the CTL's cytotoxic payload cannot penetrate the specialized membrane of the phagosome to reach the bacteria.\n\nC. The bacterial antigens are processed as exogenous antigens and primarily presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II molecules, which are not recognized by the T-cell receptors on CTLs.\n\nD. These bacteria produce toxins that specifically degrade the T-cell receptor on the CTL surface, preventing the CTL from binding to any cell.\n\nE. The bacteria actively suppress the synthesis of all MHC molecules in the macrophage, making the macrophage \"invisible\" to all T-cells.", "solution": "- Fundamental principle: CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize peptide antigens presented on MHC Class I molecules. The MHC Class I pathway primarily displays peptides derived from endogenous (cytosolic) proteins that are processed by the proteasome and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP before loading onto MHC Class I. In contrast, CD4-positive T helper cells recognize peptides presented on MHC Class II, which primarily displays peptides derived from exogenous antigens that have been internalized into endosomes/phagosomes and processed by endosomal/lysosomal proteases before loading onto MHC Class II.\n\n- Pathogen localization and antigen routing: Phagosome-resident bacteria such as Mycobacterium remain within the phagosomal compartment of macrophages. Their antigens are therefore largely confined to the endosomal/phagosomal pathway and are processed as exogenous antigens. As a result, the dominant presentation is on MHC Class II molecules, which are recognized by CD4-positive T cells rather than by CTLs.\n\n- Functional consequence: Because CTLs require recognition of peptide-MHC Class I complexes via the CD8 T-cell receptor to initiate cytotoxicity, they are generally not efficiently activated against macrophages harboring phagosome-resident bacteria, whose antigens are not predominantly presented on MHC Class I. Instead, effective control relies on CD4-positive Th1 cells that recognize bacterial peptides on MHC Class II and activate infected macrophages (for example via interferon-gamma) to enhance killing of the intracellular bacteria.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  - A is incorrect: CTLs can kill many cell types, including macrophages, provided they present antigen on MHC Class I.\n  - B is not the primary immunological reason: CTLs deliver perforin/granzyme into the target cell cytosol; the key limitation is antigen presentation to initiate CTL recognition, not phagosomal membrane penetration of the cytotoxic molecules.\n  - C is correct: Bacterial antigens from phagosome-resident pathogens are processed as exogenous antigens and primarily presented on MHC Class II, which CTLs (CD8-positive) do not recognize.\n  - D is incorrect: There is no general mechanism whereby these bacteria specifically degrade T-cell receptors on CTLs.\n  - E is incorrect: These bacteria do not universally suppress all MHC expression; while they can modulate host responses, making the macrophage entirely invisible to all T cells is not the general mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the primary immunological reason is the MHC Class II–restricted presentation of phagosomal bacterial antigens, which are recognized by CD4-positive T cells, not by CD8-positive CTLs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2223223"}]}
