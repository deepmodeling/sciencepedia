The T cell's T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizes and binds with high affinity to a specific peptide antigen presented on the islet cell's Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule. Despite this strong initial recognition signal, the T cell does not become activated and differentiate into a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). Instead, it enters a state of functional unresponsiveness known as anergy.

Interaction between the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its high-affinity receptor on the T cell surface.", "solution": "The activation of a naive CD8+ T cell follows the two-signal model of T cell activation:\n- Signal 1: Antigen-specific recognition via the T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to peptide presented by MHC class I on the target cell.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulatory signaling, classically via CD28 on the T cell binding to B7 family ligands (CD80 or CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell.\n\nThe necessary logical consequences are:\n1. If Signal 1 occurs in the absence of Signal 2, the naive T cell does not activate but instead becomes anergic. This is a mechanism of peripheral tolerance.\n2. Professional antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) express B7 molecules; nonprofessional cells such as pancreatic islet cells typically do not, so they can present antigen (provide Signal 1) without co-stimulation (Signal 2), inducing anergy.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A (TCR–peptide-MHC): This interaction is explicitly present in the stem; its absence would prevent any initial recognition, contradicting the scenario.\n- Option B (CD8–MHC class I): This co-receptor stabilizes TCR–MHC interactions and contributes to signaling but is not the decisive co-stimulatory checkpoint responsible for preventing anergy; moreover, the stem indicates strong recognition, making this less likely to be the missing interaction.\n- Option C (CD28–B7): Absence of this co-stimulatory interaction during Signal 1 is the canonical cause of anergy in naive T cells in peripheral tolerance.\n- Option D (FasL–Fas): This interaction mediates apoptosis (activation-induced cell death or target cell killing) and is not required for initial activation or for preventing anergy.\n- Option E (IL-2–IL-2 receptor): IL-2 production and high-affinity IL-2 receptor expression are downstream consequences of successful activation; their absence results from failed co-stimulation but is not the primary missing interaction that distinguishes activation from anergy.\n\nTherefore, the crucial missing interaction leading to anergy is the co-stimulatory interaction between CD28 on the T cell and B7 (CD80/CD86) on the islet cell.\n\nThere is no mistake in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2225334"}, {"introduction": "Once a naive CD8+ T cell is properly activated by receiving both necessary signals, it undergoes a dramatic transformation.

Effector CTLs downregulate lymph node homing receptors CD62L and CCR7, and upregulate activation/adhesion molecules such as CD44. CD44 is a hyaluronan receptor associated with T cell activation and is commonly used to distinguish naive (CD44 low) from antigen-experienced (CD44 high) T cells.\n- Additional activation markers (e.g., CD69, CD25) may be upregulated transiently, but among the listed options, CD44 is the canonical marker elevated on effector CD8 T cells relative to naive cells.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A. CD44: Upregulated on activated/effector and memory T cells; naive T cells are CD44 low. Therefore, higher on effector CTLs.\n- B. CD62L: High on naive T cells; downregulated on effector CTLs. Therefore, not higher on effectors.\n- C.

Not all become terminal, short-lived effector cells (SLECs); a critical subset is designated as memory precursor effector cells (MPECs), which are essential for establishing long-lasting immunological memory. This fate decision is orchestrated by a complex intracellular network of competing transcription factors. In this final challenge [@problem_id:2225337], you will use a quantitative model based on this transcriptional network to evaluate and compare two potential cancer immunotherapy strategies, providing insight into how manipulating these molecular pathways can enhance durable anti-tumor immunity.", "problem": "In the development of a novel cancer immunotherapy, the primary goal is to enhance the long-term persistence of anti-tumor CD8+ (Cluster of Differentiation 8) T cells. Upon encountering an antigen, naive CD8+ T cells activate and differentiate into two main subtypes: short-lived effector cells (SLECs) and memory precursor effector cells (MPECs). The MPECs are critical for establishing a durable, long-term immune response.\n\nThe differentiation process is governed by a network of transcription factors. A simplified model of this network is proposed, focusing on three key proteins: T-bet, TCF-1 (T-cell factor 1), and Blimp-1 (B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1).\n\nIn this model, T-cell persistence is quantified by the fraction of activated cells that become MPECs, denoted as $f_{MPEC}$. This fraction is assumed to be directly proportional to the intracellular concentration of TCF-1, denoted as $[C]$. The concentration of TCF-1 is, in turn, negatively regulated by Blimp-1, $[B]$, according to the following Hill-type repression function:\n$$ [C] = \\frac{C_{\\max}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right)^n} $$\nThe concentration of Blimp-1 is induced by T-bet, $[T]$, following a power-law relationship:\n$$ [B] = k[T]^\\beta $$\nThe system has the following parameters:\n- Baseline T-bet concentration in a normal activated T-cell, $[T]_0 = 2.0$ arbitrary units (a.u.).\n- Power-law coefficient, $k = 0.5 \\text{ a.u.}^{1-\\beta}$.\n- Power-law exponent, $\\beta = 1.5$.\n- Maximum TCF-1 concentration, $C_{\\max} = 100$ a.u.\n- Blimp-1 half-repression constant, $K_B = 1.0$ a.u.\n- Hill coefficient, $n = 2$.\n\nTwo therapeutic strategies are being considered to enhance T-cell persistence:\n1.  **Strategy 1 (T-bet Overexpression):** A genetic modification that increases the T-bet concentration to $[T]_1 = \\gamma [T]_0$, where the enhancement factor is $\\gamma = 1.5$.\n2.  **Strategy 2 (Blimp-1 Inhibition):** Administration of a drug that inhibits Blimp-1 activity. This is modeled as reducing the effective concentration of Blimp-1 that participates in TCF-1 repression to $[B]_{\\text{eff},2} = \\delta [B]_0$, where $[B]_0$ is the Blimp-1 concentration corresponding to the baseline T-bet level $[T]_0$, and the inhibition factor is $\\delta = 0.6$. Note that in this strategy, the T-bet concentration remains at its baseline level, $[T]_0$.\n\nTo compare the efficacy of these two strategies in promoting persistence, calculate the ratio of the MPEC fraction produced under Strategy 2 to that produced under Strategy 1.
