{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of a developing T cell, or thymocyte, is a trial by fire, governed by two critical selection events in the thymus. This first practice explores the initial and non-negotiable hurdle: positive selection. This exercise is designed to clarify a common point of confusion by distinguishing the fate of a T cell that cannot recognize self-MHC at all from one that recognizes it too strongly, thereby illustrating the fundamental principle of \"death by neglect\" which ensures all mature T cells are useful.", "problem": "During their development in the thymus, immature T cells, called thymocytes, undergo a critical two-step selection process to ensure they can function correctly without causing autoimmune disease. This process hinges on the interaction between the T-cell Receptor (TCR) on the thymocyte and self-peptide antigens presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules by thymic cells.\n\nThe first step, **positive selection**, tests whether a thymocyte's TCR can recognize the body's own MHC molecules. A low to moderate affinity interaction provides a survival signal, allowing the cell to proceed. Cells whose TCRs cannot bind to any self-MHC complexes fail to receive this signal.\n\nThe second step, **negative selection**, tests for self-reactivity. Thymocytes that survive positive selection are checked for how strongly they bind to self-peptide:MHC complexes. Those that bind with high affinity are considered dangerously auto-reactive and are eliminated.\n\nConsider a thymocyte with a newly generated TCR that, due to its unique structure, is completely unable to bind to any self-peptide:MHC complex it encounters in the thymus. Which of the following describes the most likely fate of this particular thymocyte?\n\nA. The cell is eliminated via apoptosis during negative selection because it is non-reactive to self-antigens.\n\nB. The cell fails to be positively selected and is eliminated via apoptosis, a process known as \"death by neglect.\"\n\nC. The cell successfully completes maturation, becomes a naive T cell, and is exported to the periphery.\n\nD. The cell survives and differentiates into a regulatory T cell (Treg) that will later suppress autoimmune reactions.\n\nE. The cell becomes functionally unresponsive, a state known as anergy, and circulates in the periphery without effect.", "solution": "Positive selection occurs first in the thymic cortex and requires that a thymocyte’s TCR engage self-peptide:MHC with low to moderate affinity to receive a survival signal. Without any detectable binding to self-MHC, the thymocyte does not receive this survival signal and undergoes apoptosis, a process termed death by neglect. Negative selection, which occurs later (primarily in the medulla), eliminates thymocytes that bind self-peptide:MHC with high affinity; it cannot apply to a cell that never engages self-MHC in the first place. Regulatory T cell differentiation typically arises from thymocytes with relatively stronger self-reactivity that is below the threshold for deletion, not from cells that fail to recognize self-MHC at all. Anergy is a peripheral tolerance mechanism requiring survival to the periphery and antigen encounter without appropriate co-stimulation, which does not occur for cells that fail positive selection. Therefore, the thymocyte completely unable to bind any self-peptide:MHC fails positive selection and is eliminated by death by neglect.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A: Incorrect—negative selection removes high-affinity self-reactive cells, not non-reactive cells.\n- B: Correct—failure to receive positive selection signals leads to apoptosis (death by neglect).\n- C: Incorrect—maturation requires successful positive selection.\n- D: Incorrect—Treg selection requires some self-reactivity, not absence of recognition.\n- E: Incorrect—anergy is a peripheral state; this cell never exits the thymus.\n\nThus, the most likely fate is death by neglect due to failure of positive selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2253623"}, {"introduction": "Having survived positive selection, a thymocyte must now prove it is not dangerously self-reactive. This evaluation, known as negative selection, strictly follows the rules of MHC restriction. This practice problem uses a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how the origin and processing of a self-antigen determines which class of MHC molecule presents it, and consequently, which specific subset of T cells—CD4+ or CD8+—is made tolerant to it.", "problem": "In the thymus, the process of central tolerance ensures that the immune system does not attack the body's own tissues. A critical part of this process is negative selection, where developing T cells (thymocytes) that bind too strongly to self-antigens are eliminated.\n\nConsider a hypothetical soluble protein, \"Hepato-globulin,\" that is normally found in the bloodstream. Specialized antigen-presenting cells within the thymus are capable of taking up this protein from the circulation and processing it for presentation to developing thymocytes. Due to the specific biochemical pathway by which Hepato-globulin is endocytosed and processed, peptide fragments from this protein can be presented *exclusively* on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules and not on MHC class I molecules.\n\nGiven this specific presentation pathway, which of the following cell populations will be made tolerant to the Hepato-globulin protein through negative selection in the thymus?\n\nA. CD8+ T cells\n\nB. CD4+ T cells\n\nC. All T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+)\n\nD. B cells\n\nE. Natural Killer (NK) cells", "solution": "Negative selection in the thymus eliminates developing T cells whose T cell receptors bind strongly to self-peptides presented on self MHC. Thymocytes become MHC-restricted and lineage committed during positive selection: those recognizing peptides on MHC class I commit to the CD8 lineage, whereas those recognizing peptides on MHC class II commit to the CD4 lineage. Consequently, during negative selection, CD8 thymocytes are tolerized to self-peptides presented on MHC class I, and CD4 thymocytes are tolerized to self-peptides presented on MHC class II.\n\nExogenous soluble proteins taken up by antigen-presenting cells via endocytosis are processed in endosomal/lysosomal compartments and loaded onto MHC class II via the invariant chain–CLIP pathway with peptide exchange mediated by HLA-DM. Endogenous cytosolic proteins are processed by the proteasome and transported via TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I. Although cross-presentation can allow some exogenous antigens to be presented on MHC class I, the problem stipulates that Hepato-globulin is presented exclusively on MHC class II and not on MHC class I.\n\nTherefore, only CD4 lineage thymocytes will encounter Hepato-globulin-derived peptides in the thymus and undergo negative selection if they bind with high affinity. CD8 thymocytes will not see these peptides and thus will not be tolerized to this antigen. B cells develop and undergo central tolerance in the bone marrow, not via thymic negative selection, and NK cell education does not depend on peptide–MHC recognition in this manner.\n\nHence, the cell population made tolerant to Hepato-globulin by thymic negative selection is CD4 T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2253590"}, {"introduction": "Central tolerance is not a simple on-or-off switch; it is a highly quantitative process where the dose of a self-antigen is a critical variable. This final practice moves beyond qualitative rules to a quantitative model of negative selection, demonstrating how the abundance of a self-peptide presented on MHC molecules can dramatically influence the probability of an autoreactive T cell being deleted. By calculating the \"risk amplification factor,\" you will gain a deeper appreciation for how genetic defects that merely reduce, but do not eliminate, self-antigen expression can severely compromise tolerance and elevate the risk of autoimmunity.", "problem": "Central tolerance is a critical immunological process that prevents autoimmunity by eliminating self-reactive T cells in the thymus. A key mechanism is negative selection, where developing T cells (thymocytes) that bind too strongly to self-antigens are induced to undergo apoptosis. This process occurs in the thymic medulla, mediated by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which express a wide array of tissue-specific self-antigens.\n\nThe strength of the signal received by a thymocyte's T-cell receptor (TCR) determines its fate. This signal depends on the avidity of the interaction with self-peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules on mTECs. For a specific high-affinity autoreactive thymocyte population, the probability of it being deleted ($P_{del}$) can be modeled as a function of the number of specific self-pMHC complexes, $N$, that it encounters on an mTEC. This relationship is described by the Hill equation:\n\n$$P_{del}(N) = \\frac{N^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n}$$\n\nHere, $N_{50}$ is the number of pMHC complexes required to achieve a 50% deletion probability, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, representing the cooperativity of the signaling pathway.\n\nConsider a specific self-antigen, \"organ-specific protein A\" (OPA), for which a population of high-affinity autoreactive thymocytes exists. In healthy, wild-type individuals, the number of OPA-derived pMHC complexes encountered by a thymocyte, denoted $N_{WT}$, provides a robust signal for negative selection. Assume the signaling is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of $n=2$, and that the wild-type antigen level is high, such that $N_{WT} = 9 N_{50}$.\n\nNow, consider an individual with a genetic disorder affecting a promoter for the OPA gene. This mutation leads to a drastic reduction in its expression within mTECs, such that the number of presented OPA-pMHC complexes, $N_{mut}$, is only 1% of the wild-type level.\n\nCalculate the \"risk amplification factor,\" defined as the ratio of the probability of an autoreactive thymocyte escaping negative selection in the mutant individual ($P_{esc, mut}$) to the probability of escape in a wild-type individual ($P_{esc, WT}$). The escape probability is given by $P_{esc} = 1 - P_{del}$. Round your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the risk amplification factor, which is the ratio $\\frac{P_{esc, mut}}{P_{esc, WT}}$. The escape probability, $P_{esc}$, is defined as $1 - P_{del}$.\n\nFirst, let's express the escape probability, $P_{esc}(N)$, using the given Hill equation for the deletion probability, $P_{del}(N)$.\n$$P_{esc}(N) = 1 - P_{del}(N) = 1 - \\frac{N^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$P_{esc}(N) = \\frac{(N_{50}^n + N^n) - N^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n} = \\frac{N_{50}^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n}$$\nWe are given the Hill coefficient $n=2$. So, the specific formula for escape probability in this system is:\n$$P_{esc}(N) = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + N^2}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the escape probability for a wild-type individual, $P_{esc, WT}$. We are given that the number of pMHC complexes in this case is $N_{WT} = 9 N_{50}$. Substituting this into our escape probability formula:\n$$P_{esc, WT} = P_{esc}(N_{WT}) = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + N_{WT}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + (9 N_{50})^2}$$\n$$P_{esc, WT} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + 81 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{82 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{1}{82}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the escape probability for the mutant individual, $P_{esc, mut}$. The problem states that the number of pMHC complexes in the mutant, $N_{mut}$, is 1% of the wild-type level.\n$$N_{mut} = 0.01 \\times N_{WT}$$\nSince $N_{WT} = 9 N_{50}$, we can express $N_{mut}$ in terms of $N_{50}$:\n$$N_{mut} = 0.01 \\times (9 N_{50}) = 0.09 N_{50}$$\nNow we substitute this value of $N_{mut}$ into the escape probability formula:\n$$P_{esc, mut} = P_{esc}(N_{mut}) = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + N_{mut}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + (0.09 N_{50})^2}$$\n$$P_{esc, mut} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + 0.0081 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{1.0081 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{1}{1.0081}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the risk amplification factor by taking the ratio of $P_{esc, mut}$ to $P_{esc, WT}$:\n$$\\text{Risk Amplification Factor} = \\frac{P_{esc, mut}}{P_{esc, WT}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1.0081}}{\\frac{1}{82}} = \\frac{82}{1.0081}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\frac{82}{1.0081} \\approx 81.3411368$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to two significant figures.\n$$81.3411368 \\approx 81$$\nThus, the compromised expression of the self-antigen leads to an approximately 81-fold increase in the probability that a corresponding autoreactive T cell will escape negative selection and mature, posing a significant risk for autoimmunity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{81}$$", "id": "2253611"}]}
