This first practice focuses on the hierarchical nature of the T-cell activation cascade by examining the role of the kinase Lck, which acts as a crucial upstream initiator. By considering a scenario where Lck activity is blocked, you can practice tracing signaling pathways and predicting the functional consequences of inhibiting a key entry point into the system [@problem_id:2277767].", "problem": "In a cellular immunology experiment, a population of primary human T-cells is treated with a highly specific, cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor that completely blocks the kinase activity of Lck. Following this pre-treatment, the T-cells are stimulated by co-culturing them with antigen-presenting cells displaying the appropriate peptide-MHC complex, leading to the engagement of the T-cell Receptor (TCR). The TCR complex contains critical signaling components, including the adaptor proteins Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT) and SH2-domain-containing Leukocyte Protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), which must be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues to propagate the activation signal.\n\nGiven this scenario where TCR engagement occurs in the presence of a potent Lck inhibitor, what is the expected phosphorylation status of LAT and SLP-76?\n\nA. Both LAT and SLP-76 would be phosphorylated.\n\nB. LAT would be phosphorylated, but SLP-76 would not be.\n\nC. SLP-76 would be phosphorylated, but LAT would not be.\n\nD. Neither LAT nor SLP-76 would be phosphorylated.\n\nE. Both LAT and SLP-76 would become dephosphorylated below their basal state.", "solution": "The proximal T-cell receptor signaling cascade proceeds in a defined order that depends critically on the kinase activity of Lck. The essential steps are as follows.\n\n1) Upon TCR engagement with peptide-MHC, the Src-family kinase Lck phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 chains. This phosphorylation creates binding sites for the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70.\n\n2) ZAP-70 is recruited to phosphorylated ITAMs and requires phosphorylation by Lck (and subsequent autophosphorylation steps) to become catalytically active.\n\n3) Active ZAP-70 phosphorylates the adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-76 on specific tyrosine residues. Phosphorylated LAT forms a scaffold that recruits Gads and SLP-76, facilitating downstream signaling.\n\nGiven a complete pharmacologic blockade of Lck kinase activity before and during TCR engagement, step 1 fails: ITAMs are not phosphorylated. Consequently, ZAP-70 cannot be effectively recruited and activated (step 2), which prevents the phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 (step 3). Therefore, in the stimulated condition, neither LAT nor SLP-76 becomes phosphorylated.\n\nRegarding basal phosphorylation, option E posits a decrease below basal levels. Basal phosphorylation of these adaptors is maintained by a balance of kinases and phosphatases; removing Lck input prevents stimulus-induced increases but does not imply an active decrease below basal beyond ongoing phosphatase activity. The key experimental expectation under stimulation with Lck fully inhibited is the absence of inducible phosphorylation of both LAT and SLP-76.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that neither LAT nor SLP-76 would be phosphorylated upon TCR engagement when Lck is inhibited.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2277767"}, {"introduction": "Signaling hubs like the adaptor protein LAT orchestrate multiple downstream pathways simultaneously. This exercise delves into the modularity of the LAT scaffold, challenging you to distinguish between the simple recruitment of a signaling protein, like PLCγ1, and its full activation, which requires other components of the signalosome. This thought experiment based on a hypothetical mutant will help you analyze how parallel signaling branches can be interdependent and how disrupting specific protein-protein interactions can have complex effects on cell-wide responses [@problem_id:2277785].", "problem": "A research team is investigating signal transduction pathways in a genetically engineered T-cell line. This cell line expresses a mutant form of the Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT) protein. In this specific mutant, the tyrosine residue at position 132 (Y132), which serves as the docking site for the SH2 domain of Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1), is intact. However, all other key tyrosine residues on LAT, which are normally phosphorylated upon T-cell activation to recruit other adapter proteins like Grb2 and Gads, have been mutated to phenylalanine. Phenylalanine cannot be phosphorylated, effectively ablating these other docking sites. All other signaling components, including the T-Cell Receptor (TCR), ZAP-70, and SLP-76, are present and functional.\n\nUpon stimulation of the TCR in these mutant T-cells, which of the following statements provides the most accurate prediction of the downstream signaling events compared to wild-type T-cells?\n\nA. The cells will exhibit robust calcium flux and full activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, indistinguishable from wild-type cells.\n\nB. PLCγ1 will be recruited to the plasma membrane, but its activation will be severely impaired, leading to attenuated calcium flux and abrogation of the MAPK pathway.\n\nC. The cells will fail to recruit PLCγ1 to the plasma membrane, resulting in a complete absence of calcium flux, while the MAPK pathway proceeds normally.\n\nD. The recruitment of both the Grb2-Sos complex and the Gads-SLP-76 complex to LAT will occur normally, but the activation of PLCγ1 will be specifically blocked.\n\nE. Signaling will be hyperactivated through the PLCγ1 pathway due to the lack of competition from other signaling molecules for binding to LAT.", "solution": "T-cell receptor engagement leads to activation of the Src-family kinases and ZAP-70, which phosphorylates LAT on multiple tyrosine residues. In wild-type cells, distinct LAT phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for different SH2-containing proteins: Y132 (human numbering) recruits PLCγ1 via its SH2 domain, while other key LAT tyrosines recruit the adapter proteins Grb2 (which brings Sos to activate Ras and the MAPK pathway) and Gads (which recruits SLP-76). SLP-76, in turn, scaffolds Tec-family kinases such as Itk that phosphorylate and activate PLCγ1, enabling robust phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium signaling.\n\nIn the engineered mutant described, Y132 is intact, so upon TCR stimulation ZAP-70 can still phosphorylate LAT Y132 and thereby recruit PLCγ1 to the membrane via SH2-pY132 binding. However, because all other key LAT tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanine, LAT cannot be phosphorylated at those positions and thus cannot recruit Grb2 or Gads. Consequently:\n1) The Grb2-Sos complex fails to localize to LAT, preventing efficient Ras activation and thereby abrogating the MAPK cascade relative to wild-type.\n2) The Gads-SLP-76 complex also fails to be recruited to LAT. Although SLP-76 is present, its LAT-dependent microcluster assembly is impaired. This compromises the recruitment and activation of Itk, which is necessary for PLCγ1 phosphorylation on its activation tyrosine and full catalytic activation. Therefore, despite PLCγ1 membrane recruitment via pY132, its activation is severely impaired, leading to attenuated inositol phosphate production and reduced calcium flux compared to wild-type.\n\nThese mechanistic consequences rule out the alternatives: PLCγ1 recruitment is not abolished (contradicting C), Grb2/Gads recruitment is not normal (contradicting D), signaling is not hyperactivated (contradicting E), and neither calcium flux nor MAPK signaling is robust as in wild-type (contradicting A). The most accurate prediction is that PLCγ1 is recruited but poorly activated, calcium signaling is attenuated, and the MAPK pathway is abrogated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2277785"}, {"introduction": "The assembly of the LAT-SLP-76 signalosome is not an instantaneous event but a dynamic process with a clear temporal order. This final practice transitions from a static, qualitative view of the pathway to a quantitative, kinetic analysis, which is central to modern systems biology. By applying a mathematical model to the phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76, you will reinforce your understanding of their activation sequence and gain hands-on experience in using kinetic parameters to analyze the dynamics of signaling events [@problem_id:2277740].", "problem": "In the study of T-cell activation, the formation of a signaling complex, or signalosome, at the plasma membrane is a critical event following T-Cell Receptor (TCR) engagement. Two key scaffold proteins in this process are the Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT) and the SH2-domain-containing Leukocyte Protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76). Following TCR stimulation, LAT is rapidly phosphorylated by the kinase ZAP-70. This phosphorylated LAT (pLAT) then recruits SLP-76, which subsequently becomes phosphorylated itself (pSLP-76). This temporal hierarchy is essential for downstream signal propagation.\n\nAn immunologist is investigating the kinetics of this process. They find that the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of each protein, measured from the moment of TCR stimulation at $t=0$, can be well-approximated by a \"Delayed First-Order Activation Model\".
