{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The activation of a T cell begins with a precise sequence of molecular events triggered by the T-Cell Receptor (TCR). This practice explores the critical role of scaffold proteins, like the Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT), which act as organizing hubs for intracellular signaling. By considering a hypothetical scenario where LAT's function is disrupted, you can develop a deeper understanding of how these initial signals are translated into a coordinated cellular response. [@problem_id:2271131]", "problem": "In a laboratory study of T-cell signaling, a mutant human Jurkat T-cell line is developed. These cells express a functionally altered form of the scaffold protein known as Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT). This mutation specifically prevents the phosphorylation of all tyrosine residues on LAT following T-Cell Receptor (TCR) ligation, even though the upstream kinase, Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), is confirmed to be properly activated. The primary downstream signaling pathways initiated by LAT involve the activation of Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) and the small G-protein Ras.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, which of the following statements most accurately describes the functional consequence for the activation of PLC-gamma and Ras upon TCR stimulation in this mutant cell line?\n\nA. The activation of PLC-gamma is abolished, but Ras activation is unaffected because it is primarily mediated by the Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (Sos), which functions independently of LAT.\n\nB. The activation of Ras is abolished, but PLC-gamma is still weakly activated by the kinase Itk, which can auto-activate in the absence of scaffold proteins.\n\nC. The activation of both PLC-gamma and Ras is severely impaired, as LAT is the essential scaffold for recruiting key components of both pathways to the plasma membrane.\n\nD. The activation of both PLC-gamma and Ras is kinetically delayed but eventually reaches normal peak levels, as other scaffold proteins like SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) can fully compensate for the loss of LAT function.\n\nE. The activation of PLC-gamma proceeds normally, leading to Diacylglycerol (DAG) production, which is sufficient to activate Ras via the GEF RasGRP, thus bypassing the need for LAT phosphorylation.", "solution": "The canonical T-cell receptor signaling cascade proceeds as follows: TCR ligation induces phosphorylation of CD3 ITAMs, recruitment and activation of ZAP-70, and subsequent phosphorylation of LAT on multiple tyrosine residues. Phosphorylated LAT provides SH2 domain docking sites that nucleate two key signaling assemblies relevant here.\n\nFirst, PLC-gamma1 activation requires: (i) recruitment of PLC-gamma1 via its SH2 domains to phosphorylated LAT (notably the LAT tyrosine that directly binds PLC-gamma1), (ii) assembly of the Gads–SLP-76 complex on LAT via Gads SH2 recognition of phosphorylated LAT and constitutive Gads–SLP-76 interaction, and (iii) recruitment/activation of Itk on SLP-76, which phosphorylates and activates PLC-gamma1. If LAT cannot be phosphorylated, none of these LAT-dependent docking interactions occur: PLC-gamma1 cannot bind LAT, Gads–SLP-76 cannot be recruited, and Itk is not productively organized with its substrates. Therefore, PLC-gamma1 activation is severely impaired, leading to failure of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and thus loss of both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol generation.\n\nSecond, Ras activation downstream of the TCR occurs via two LAT-dependent routes: (i) recruitment of Grb2–SOS to phosphorylated LAT (Grb2 SH2 binds LAT phosphotyrosines, bringing SOS to the membrane to activate Ras), and (ii) activation of RasGRP, which requires diacylglycerol produced by PLC-gamma1. In the absence of LAT phosphorylation, Grb2–SOS cannot be recruited to LAT, and the failure of PLC-gamma1 activation prevents diacylglycerol production, thereby impairing RasGRP activation. Consequently, both principal Ras activation mechanisms downstream of the TCR are severely compromised.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because SOS recruitment in T cells is primarily LAT-dependent; without LAT phosphorylation, SOS-mediated Ras activation is impaired.\n- B is incorrect because PLC-gamma1 activation requires LAT-dependent recruitment and SLP-76–Itk assembly; Itk cannot meaningfully compensate in the absence of the LAT scaffold.\n- C is correct: both PLC-gamma and Ras activation are severely impaired because LAT phosphorylation is essential for assembling both signaling complexes at the membrane.\n- D is incorrect because SLP-76 requires LAT via Gads for membrane recruitment; it cannot fully compensate without LAT phosphorylation.\n- E is incorrect because PLC-gamma1 does not proceed normally without LAT phosphorylation; thus diacylglycerol production and RasGRP activation are not preserved.\n\nTherefore, the functional consequence is severe impairment of both PLC-gamma and Ras activation upon TCR stimulation in this mutant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2271131"}, {"introduction": "Once a T cell is activated, it must rapidly multiply to generate a sufficient number of effector cells—a process known as clonal expansion. This critical step is driven by the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which acts as a powerful growth signal. This exercise examines the consequences of blocking the IL-2 signaling pathway, a strategy used in real-world therapeutics, to solidify your understanding of T-cell proliferation. [@problem_id:2271113]", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is developing a new monoclonal antibody therapeutic, \"Anti-lucan,\" designed to treat severe autoimmune diseases. The mechanism of action for Anti-lucan is to bind with high affinity to the alpha chain (CD25) of the high-affinity receptor for Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a critical cytokine in the immune response. This binding completely prevents IL-2 from docking with its receptor. Consider a naive T lymphocyte that becomes properly activated by an antigen-presenting cell, receiving both a primary signal through its T-cell Receptor (TCR) and a co-stimulatory second signal. If this T cell is then exposed to a clinically effective concentration of Anti-lucan, what is the most direct and immediate consequence for this activated T cell?\n\nA. The T cell will be unable to recognize and bind to its specific antigen-MHC complex.\n\nB. The T cell will fail to undergo clonal expansion.\n\nC. The T cell will immediately undergo apoptosis due to a lack of survival signals.\n\nD. The T cell will differentiate into a memory T cell at an accelerated rate.\n\nE. The T cell will switch its cytokine production from IL-2 to Interleukin-4 (IL-4).", "solution": "The biological mechanism to analyze is the sequence of events after naive T cell activation. First, a naive T lymphocyte that receives both signal 1 (TCR engagement with specific antigen presented on MHC) and signal 2 (co-stimulation, such as CD28 binding B7) becomes activated. Upon activation, the T cell rapidly upregulates expression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor, which includes the alpha chain CD25, and secretes IL-2. Autocrine and paracrine IL-2 then binds the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (composed of alpha, beta, and common gamma chains), initiating intracellular signaling through JAK1/JAK3 and STAT5, which drives entry into the cell cycle and robust clonal expansion, along with providing survival signals.\n\nAnti-lucan binds CD25 with high affinity and prevents IL-2 from docking on the high-affinity IL-2 receptor. This directly blocks IL-2–dependent signaling required for proliferation. Because TCR specificity is unaffected, antigen recognition (option A) is preserved. Although IL-2 also contributes to survival, the immediate and most direct effect of preventing IL-2 receptor engagement in an already activated T cell is the failure to undergo clonal expansion (option B). Immediate apoptosis (option C) is not the most direct or immediate consequence upon blocking IL-2; rather, impaired proliferation precedes any potential effects on survival. There is no mechanism by which Anti-lucan accelerates memory differentiation (option D) or drives a cytokine switch to IL-4 (option E).\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is failure of clonal expansion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2271113"}, {"introduction": "After activation and expansion, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells) are equipped to find and destroy infected host cells. Their primary weapon is a sophisticated system involving the pore-forming protein perforin and cell-death-inducing enzymes called granzymes. This problem uses a clinically-inspired scenario of a genetic deficiency to illustrate precisely why perforin is indispensable for this 'kiss of death' and for protecting the body from intracellular pathogens. [@problem_id:2271154]", "problem": "A patient presents with a history of recurrent and severe infections caused by intracellular viruses. A comprehensive immunological workup reveals that the patient has a normal number and distribution of CD8+ T cells, also known as Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). Genetic sequencing, however, identifies a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding perforin, rendering the protein non-functional. The patient's T cells are otherwise capable of recognizing viral antigens presented by infected cells via Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for why this patient is susceptible to severe viral disease despite having a normal count of virus-specific CD8+ T cells?\n\nA. The non-functional perforin prevents the CD8+ T cells from proliferating upon encountering an infected cell, leading to an insufficient number of effector cells at the site of infection.\n\nB. In the absence of functional perforin, the T-cell receptor on the CD8+ T cell cannot bind with high affinity to the viral-peptide-MHC-I complex on the infected cell surface.\n\nC. CD8+ T cells are unable to induce apoptosis in infected target cells because the delivery of cytotoxic enzymes, such as granzymes, into the target cell's cytoplasm is impaired.\n\nD. The lack of perforin causes the CD8+ T cells to be rapidly destroyed by a self-regulatory mechanism before they can reach the infected tissues.\n\nE. The virus-infected cells are able to downregulate their MHC class I expression more effectively in the absence of perforin, thus evading recognition by the CD8+ T cells.", "solution": "We are given that the patient has normal numbers and antigen recognition capacity of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), but a loss-of-function mutation in perforin renders it non-functional. The key to explaining the susceptibility to severe viral infections is to analyze the essential steps of CTL-mediated killing and identify which step requires perforin.\n\nFirst, the fundamental mechanism of CTL cytotoxicity proceeds as follows:\n1. Antigen-specific recognition: The T-cell receptor (TCR) on CD8+ T cells binds to viral peptide presented on MHC class I on infected cells. This process depends on TCR-peptide-MHC-I interactions and co-receptors, not on perforin.\n2. Immune synapse formation and activation: Upon recognition, the CTL polarizes and releases lytic granules toward the target cell. These granules contain perforin and granzymes.\n3. Perforin function: Perforin polymerizes in the target cell membrane to form transmembrane pores. This pore formation enables granzymes, serine proteases such as granzyme B, to enter the target cell cytosol. Alternatively, granzymes may be endocytosed and require perforin-mediated endosomal escape to reach the cytosol.\n4. Granzyme-mediated apoptosis: Once in the cytosol, granzymes activate apoptotic pathways, including caspase activation and mitochondrial pathways, leading to programmed cell death of the infected cell.\n\nGiven a non-functional perforin, step 3 is impaired: the delivery of granzymes into the target cell cytosol is blocked because perforin cannot form the necessary pores or mediate endosomal escape. Consequently, step 4 (apoptosis induction) fails, even though antigen recognition (step 1) and CTL activation are intact. Although CTLs can also induce apoptosis via FasL-Fas interactions, the perforin/granzyme pathway is a principal, rapid mechanism for killing many virus-infected cells; its loss leads to marked susceptibility to intracellular viral infections.\n\nNow, evaluate the options:\n- A: Proliferation of CD8+ T cells depends on TCR signaling and cytokines such as IL-2, not on perforin. A is incorrect.\n- B: TCR affinity for peptide-MHC-I is independent of perforin. B is incorrect.\n- C: Without functional perforin, granzymes cannot access the target cytosol, preventing apoptosis of infected cells. This directly explains the susceptibility. C is correct.\n- D: There is no self-regulatory mechanism that specifically destroys CD8+ T cells due to lack of perforin. D is incorrect.\n- E: Perforin does not regulate MHC class I expression on infected cells. E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that CD8+ T cells cannot induce apoptosis in target cells because granzyme delivery is impaired in the absence of functional perforin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2271154"}]}
