These T-cells are then exposed to a population of specialized Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). These APCs are genetically engineered to lack the genes for both CD80 and CD86 proteins, but they are otherwise fully functional and are presenting the specific peptide antigen bound to their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules.\n\nAfter this initial co-culture period, the T-cells are isolated and rested.

T-cell activation requires two signals: signal 1 is antigen-specific TCR recognition of peptide bound to MHC class II on APCs; signal 2 is costimulation, classically CD28 on T-cells binding CD80/CD86 on APCs. In naive CD4$^+$ T-cells, TCR engagement in the absence of costimulation does not lead to productive activation; instead, it induces peripheral tolerance, most commonly anergy, characterized by a stable hyporesponsive state.\n\n2. In the initial co-culture, APCs lack CD80 and CD86, so although they present the correct peptide-MHC class II complex and deliver signal 1 via the TCR, they cannot deliver signal 2 via CD28. This condition (signal 1 without signal 2) induces anergy in naive CD4$^+$ T-cells. Mechanistically, such incomplete activation upregulates anergy-associated pathways (for example, E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Cbl-b, GRAIL, and Itch) that dampen proximal TCR signaling and impair IL-2 production and proliferative capacity upon subsequent encounters with antigen.\n\n3. After isolation and rest, the anergic state persists intrinsically within the T-cells. Anergic T-cells are defined by failure to proliferate and to produce key cytokines (notably IL-2) upon restimulation, even when appropriate costimulation is subsequently provided.\n\n4. Upon re-exposure to fully competent, unmodified APCs that present the same peptide antigen and express normal CD80/CD86, the previously anergized T-cells encounter both signal 1 and signal 2. However, due to their anergic program, they remain functionally unresponsive: they do not proliferate effectively and do not produce significant cytokines. They do not behave as naive (because intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms now block activation), they do not convert into memory (memory differentiation requires productive activation with costimulation and cytokines), they do not preferentially undergo rapid apoptosis upon re-exposure (activation-induced cell death typically follows prior robust activation, not anergy induction), and they do not become active suppressors secreting high levels of inhibitory cytokines (that would require specific differentiation into regulatory lineages under defined cytokine conditions, which are absent here).\n\n5. Therefore, the best description of the outcome on second exposure is functional unresponsiveness (anergy), with failure to proliferate or produce significant cytokines.\n\nThe correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2252458"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the fate of a single T-cell lacking co-stimulation, we now consider the systemic consequences of this signaling defect.

[@problem_id:2252429]", "problem": "A team of immunologists has created a genetically engineered mouse line that lacks a functional gene for the CD28 protein. The CD28 protein is a crucial receptor normally expressed on the surface of naive T-lymphocytes. For a naive T-cell to become fully activated, it generally requires two distinct signals from a professional Antigen Presenting Cell (APC), such as a dendritic cell. Signal 1 is delivered when the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) on the T-cell binds to a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the APC. Signal 2, also known as costimulation, is delivered when the T-cell's CD28 receptor binds to a B7 family protein (e.g., CD80 or CD86) on the same APC.\n\nAssuming all other components of their immune system are initially normal, which of the following options most accurately predicts the primary immunological consequence for these CD28-deficient mice when they are exposed to a novel pathogenic virus for the first time?\n\nA. The mice will be severely immunocompromised because their T-cells will fail to become activated, preventing an effective adaptive immune response.\n\nB. The mice will suffer from widespread autoimmunity because their T-cells will be uncontrollably activated by self-antigens in the absence of the regulatory CD28 signal.\n\nC. The mice will mount a normal primary immune response to the virus, as TCR engagement (Signal 1) is sufficient to induce full T-cell activation.\n\nD. The mice's B-cells will produce an excessive and non-specific antibody response to compensate for the T-cell defect.\n\nE. The initial T-cell activation will proceed normally, but the mice will be unable to form any long-term immunological memory against the virus.", "solution": "Principle: Naive T-lymphocytes require two signals for full activation. Signal 1 is antigen-specific recognition via T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to peptide presented on major histocompatibility complex on an antigen-presenting cell. Signal 2 is costimulation, most classically delivered when CD28 on the T-cell binds B7 family ligands (CD80 or CD86) on the same antigen-presenting cell. The two-signal model predicts that Signal 1 in the absence of adequate costimulation does not activate naive T-cells; instead, it induces anergy or apoptosis and fails to induce interleukin-2 production, proliferation, survival, and differentiation.\n\nRole of CD28 in activation: CD28 ligation synergizes with TCR signaling to increase transcription and stability of interleukin-2 mRNA, to enhance activation of transcription factors, to upregulate anti-apoptotic molecules, and to support metabolic and cytoskeletal changes needed for clonal expansion. Therefore, CD28 costimulation is critical for initial expansion and differentiation of naive CD4 and CD8 T-cells.\n\nConsequence of CD28 deficiency: In CD28-deficient mice, TCR engagement (Signal 1) occurs normally, but the absence of CD28 abolishes the dominant costimulatory pathway for naive T-cells. Upon first exposure to a novel virus, antigen-specific naive T-cells that receive Signal 1 without costimulation become anergic or undergo deletion and fail to produce interleukin-2 and proliferate. As a result:\n- CD4 T-cell effector differentiation is markedly impaired, leading to reduced help for B cells (poor germinal center formation, impaired class switching and affinity maturation).\n- CD8 T-cell priming is impaired because effective priming often requires CD4 help and robust costimulation.\n- Although alternative costimulatory pathways (e.g., ICOS, OX40, 4-1BB) exist, they are insufficient to compensate for the lack of CD28 in the initial activation of naive T-cells during a primary response.\n- Memory formation requires successful primary activation; thus, memory would also be impaired, but the immediate and primary defect is the failure of initial activation itself.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is correct: Without CD28, naive T-cells fail to become fully activated on first exposure, leading to a severely compromised adaptive response to the novel virus.\n- B is incorrect: Loss of CD28 does not cause uncontrolled activation; rather, it diminishes activation. If anything, residual inhibitory signaling (e.g., via CTLA-4 engaging B7) would further suppress activation.\n- C is incorrect: Signal 1 alone is not sufficient; it induces anergy or deletion rather than full activation in naive T-cells.\n- D is incorrect: B cells generally require T-cell help for robust, specific, class-switched responses to viral antigens; therefore, responses would be reduced, not excessive and non-specific.\n- E is incorrect: The initial activation does not proceed normally; it is markedly impaired from the outset, so the defect precedes memory formation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is severe impairment of T-cell activation and the adaptive immune response on primary exposure to a novel virus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2252429"}, {"introduction": "T-cell activation is more than a simple on-off switch; it is a process of signal integration where the strength and combination of signals matter. This problem presents hypothetical experimental data to explore the relative contributions of TCR signal strength (Signal 1) and CD28 co-stimulation (Signal 2) to the metabolic reprogramming of T-cells. Analyzing these results will help you appreciate how these two signals synergize quantitatively to drive the full effector program, moving your understanding from a qualitative model to a more nuanced, data-driven perspective. [@problem_id:2252468]", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the metabolic requirements for the activation of naive T-cells. The prevailing model states that two signals are required for full activation: Signal 1, delivered through the T-cell Receptor (TCR) engaging with a peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) on an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC), and Signal 2, a co-stimulatory signal delivered primarily through the CD28 receptor on the T-cell engaging with B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on the APC. A key feature of T-cell activation is a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis. The immunologist aims to determine if this metabolic switch is exclusively dependent on CD28 signaling or if a sufficiently strong Signal 1 can independently contribute.\n\nTo test this, the researcher isolates naive CD4+ T-cells from a transgenic mouse. The TCR on these T-cells is specific for a known peptide. The researcher prepares an experiment with four conditions, culturing the T-cells for 24 hours in each:\n\n1.  **Unstimulated:** T-cells are cultured alone.\n2.  **Low-Affinity Signal 1:** T-cells are co-cultured with APCs that have been pre-treated with a blocking antibody against B7 molecules. These APCs are loaded with an altered peptide ligand that has a low affinity for the T-cells' TCR.\n3.  **High-Affinity Signal 1:** T-cells are co-cultured with APCs that have been pre-treated with a blocking antibody against B7 molecules. These APCs are loaded with the original, high-affinity peptide for the T-cells' TCR.\n4.  **Full Activation:** T-cells are co-cultured with APCs (no blocking antibody) loaded with the high-affinity peptide.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the metabolic state of the T-cells is assessed by measuring the Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR), a reliable indicator of lactate production from glycolysis. The results, in arbitrary units of mpH/min (milli-pH units per minute), are as follows:\n\n-   Condition 1 (Unstimulated): 15 mpH/min\n-   Condition 2 (Low-Affinity Signal 1): 18 mpH/min\n-   Condition 3 (High-Affinity Signal 1): 55 mpH/min\n-   Condition 4 (Full Activation): 120 mpH/min\n\nBased on this experimental data, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA. The metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis occurs only in the presence of CD28 co-stimulation, and the strength of the TCR signal has no impact on this process.\n\nB. A strong TCR signal (Signal 1) is sufficient on its own to induce the maximal glycolytic response, making CD28 co-stimulation (Signal 2) redundant for metabolic reprogramming.\n\nC. CD28 co-stimulation is the sole initiator of the metabolic switch, and TCR signaling merely serves to sustain cell viability without directly influencing glycolysis.\n\nD. A high-affinity TCR signal can independently initiate a partial shift to aerobic glycolysis, but CD28 co-stimulation is required to achieve a maximal glycolytic response.\n\nE. Any level of TCR signaling, regardless of affinity, can initiate a partial metabolic shift, which is then fully realized upon receiving CD28 co-stimulation.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to interpret experimental data to understand the relative contributions of T-cell Receptor (TCR) signaling (Signal 1) and CD28 co-stimulation (Signal 2) to the metabolic reprogramming of T-cells, specifically the switch to aerobic glycolysis as measured by the Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR).\n\nLet's analyze the result of each experimental condition step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the baseline and control conditions.**\n-   **Condition 1 (Unstimulated):** The T-cells are cultured alone and show a baseline ECAR of 15 mpH/min. This represents the basal metabolic rate of a naive, resting T-cell.\n-   **Condition 2 (Low-Affinity Signal 1):** T-cells receive a weak Signal 1 (from the low-affinity peptide) but no Signal 2 (due to the B7 blocking antibody). The ECAR is 18 mpH/min. This value is only slightly above the baseline of 15 mpH/min, indicating that a weak TCR signal alone is insufficient to cause a significant metabolic shift to glycolysis.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of a strong Signal 1 in isolation.**\n-   **Condition 3 (High-Affinity Signal 1):** T-cells receive a strong Signal 1 (from the high-affinity peptide) but no Signal 2 (B7 is blocked). The ECAR is 55 mpH/min. This is a substantial increase compared to the unstimulated baseline (15 mpH/min) and the weak signal condition (18 mpH/min). This result directly demonstrates that a strong TCR signal, in the complete absence of CD28 co-stimulation, can independently drive a partial switch to aerobic glycolysis.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of combined Signal 1 and Signal 2.**\n-   **Condition 4 (Full Activation):** T-cells receive both a strong Signal 1 and Signal 2 (no blocking antibody). The ECAR is 120 mpH/min. This is the highest value observed and represents the maximal glycolytic response. The value (120 mpH/min) is significantly greater than the value from strong Signal 1 alone (55 mpH/min). This shows that while a strong Signal 1 can initiate the process, the presence of Signal 2 is required to amplify the response to its maximum potential.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.**\n\n-   **A. The metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis occurs only in the presence of CD28 co-stimulation, and the strength of the TCR signal has no impact on this process.** This is incorrect. Condition 3 (ECAR = 55) clearly shows a metabolic switch occurring without CD28 co-stimulation.\n\n-   **B. A strong TCR signal (Signal 1) is sufficient on its own to induce the maximal glycolytic response, making CD28 co-stimulation (Signal 2) redundant for metabolic reprogramming.** This is incorrect. The ECAR in Condition 4 (120) is more than double that of Condition 3 (55), proving that CD28 co-stimulation is not redundant but essential for the maximal response.\n\n-   **C. CD28 co-stimulation is the sole initiator of the metabolic switch, and TCR signaling merely serves to sustain cell viability without directly influencing glycolysis.** This is incorrect. Condition 3 shows that strong TCR signaling alone can initiate a significant glycolytic shift, refuting the claim that it only sustains viability without influencing glycolysis.\n\n-   **D. A high-affinity TCR signal can independently initiate a partial shift to aerobic glycolysis, but CD28 co-stimulation is required to achieve a maximal glycolytic response.** This statement is fully supported by the data. Condition 3 (ECAR = 55) demonstrates the partial shift induced by a strong TCR signal alone. The comparison between Condition 3 (ECAR = 55) and Condition 4 (ECAR = 120) demonstrates that CD28 co-stimulation is necessary for the maximal response.\n\n-   **E. Any level of TCR signaling, regardless of affinity, can initiate a partial metabolic shift, which is then fully realized upon receiving CD28 co-stimulation.** This is incorrect. Condition 2 (ECAR = 18) shows that a low-affinity TCR signal does not cause a significant metabolic shift, contradicting the \"any level of TCR signaling\" part of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion that synthesizes all the observed data is that a strong TCR signal can initiate a partial metabolic shift, but both strong TCR signaling and CD28 co-stimulation are necessary to achieve the full extent of aerobic glycolysis seen in activated T-cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2252468"}]}
