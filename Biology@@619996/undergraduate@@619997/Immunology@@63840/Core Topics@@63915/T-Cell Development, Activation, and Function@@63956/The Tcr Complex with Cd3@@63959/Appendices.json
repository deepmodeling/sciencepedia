{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding T-cell activation begins with the structure of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex itself. The CD3ζ chain is a critical signaling component, and its signaling potential is directly related to the number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues it contains within its Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs). This foundational exercise ([@problem_id:2279866]) asks you to perform a simple but important calculation to quantify the signaling capacity of a single TCR complex.", "problem": "The T-Cell Receptor (TCR) complex is a multi-protein assembly on the surface of T-lymphocytes responsible for recognizing antigens. Signal transduction following antigen recognition is initiated by accessory molecules, collectively known as CD3. A critical part of these accessory molecules is a signaling motif called the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM).\n\nThe canonical structure of a single ITAM contains exactly two tyrosine (Y) residues that can be phosphorylated by kinases, which is essential for initiating downstream signaling cascades.\n\nThe CD3 complex includes several distinct polypeptide chains. One of the most important for signaling is the CD3 zeta (CD3ζ) chain. In a typical TCR complex, the CD3ζ component is a homodimer, meaning it is composed of two identical CD3ζ chains associated with each other. Each individual CD3ζ polypeptide chain contains exactly three ITAMs in its cytoplasmic domain.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues located within all the ITAMs of a single CD3ζ homodimer.", "solution": "An ITAM contains exactly two phosphorylatable tyrosine residues. Let the number of tyrosines per ITAM be $t=2$.\n\nEach CD3$\\zeta$ polypeptide chain contains exactly three ITAMs. Let the number of ITAMs per chain be $i=3$.\n\nThe CD3$\\zeta$ component is a homodimer, so there are two identical chains. Let the number of chains be $c=2$.\n\nThe total number of ITAMs in the homodimer is\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}}=c \\times i=2 \\times 3=6.\n$$\nEach ITAM has $t=2$ tyrosines, so the total number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues is\n$$\nY_{\\text{total}}=I_{\\text{total}} \\times t=(2 \\times 3) \\times 2=12.\n$$\nTherefore, the CD3$\\zeta$ homodimer contains $12$ phosphorylatable tyrosine residues within all of its ITAMs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2279866"}, {"introduction": "The TCR is not a single protein but an intricate multi-subunit complex that must be perfectly assembled to reach the cell surface. This thought experiment ([@problem_id:2279873]), based on a hypothetical scenario mirroring a real-world immunodeficiency, challenges you to predict the functional consequence of losing a single component of this complex. It highlights the crucial role of cellular quality control mechanisms in ensuring proper immune receptor expression and function.", "problem": "A patient presents with a history of recurrent and severe infections caused by a wide range of pathogens. Genetic sequencing reveals a homozygous null mutation in the gene encoding the CD3γ (Cluster of Differentiation 3 gamma) protein chain. This mutation results in the complete absence of CD3γ protein synthesis. The functional T-cell receptor (TCR) on the surface of T lymphocytes is a multi-subunit protein complex. It consists of the antigen-binding TCRαβ heterodimer, which is non-covalently associated with the invariant signaling subunits: a CD3γε heterodimer, a CD3δε heterodimer, and a ζ-chain homodimer. The assembly of this entire complex occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and only fully assembled complexes are transported to the cell surface.\n\nGiven this specific genetic defect, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected state of the patient's T cell population?\n\nA. T cells will express normal levels of the TCRαβ heterodimer on their surface, but the cells will be unresponsive to antigen because of the missing CD3 signaling component.\n\nB. The TCRαβ heterodimer will fail to assemble correctly, but the remaining CD3 components (δ, ε) and ζ-chains will form a partial complex that is expressed on the T-cell surface.\n\nC. The incomplete TCR complexes will be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum and targeted for degradation, resulting in a profound absence of TCR expression on the T-cell surface.\n\nD. T cells will express a modified TCR complex on their surface where a second CD3δ chain substitutes for the missing CD3γ chain, leading to impaired but not absent T-cell function.\n\nE. The synthesis of other TCR complex components, particularly the TCRα and β chains, will be transcriptionally downregulated to compensate for the missing CD3γ chain.", "solution": "We start from the structural and assembly requirements of the T-cell receptor complex. A functional TCR complex consists of an antigen-binding TCR alpha–beta heterodimer noncovalently associated with three invariant signaling modules: one CD3 gamma–epsilon heterodimer, one CD3 delta–epsilon heterodimer, and a zeta-chain homodimer. The entire complex assembles in the endoplasmic reticulum, and cellular quality control allows only fully assembled complexes to exit the ER for transport to the Golgi and then to the plasma membrane. Incomplete or misassembled complexes are retained in the ER and typically targeted for ER-associated degradation.\n\nGiven a homozygous null mutation in the CD3 gamma chain gene with complete absence of CD3 gamma protein synthesis, the CD3 gamma–epsilon heterodimer cannot form. Without this heterodimer, the TCR alpha–beta heterodimer cannot assemble with the complete set of CD3 signaling subunits required for proper folding, ER exit signals, and stable transport to the cell surface. Although other components (CD3 delta–epsilon and zeta homodimer) may be synthesized, they cannot form a surface-expressible partial complex in the absence of CD3 gamma because ER quality control requires the full complement of CD3 modules for correct assembly and trafficking. Consequently, the incomplete TCR complexes are retained within the ER and targeted for degradation, leading to markedly reduced to absent surface TCR/CD3 expression.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the TCR alpha–beta heterodimer cannot be expressed at normal surface levels without the associated CD3 modules; it fails to exit the ER.\n- Option B is incorrect because partial CD3 subassemblies do not traffic to the surface independently; ER quality control prevents expression of incomplete complexes.\n- Option C is correct because the absence of CD3 gamma prevents complete assembly, resulting in ER retention and degradation and thus a profound absence of TCR on the surface.\n- Option D is incorrect because there is no physiological substitution of CD3 delta for CD3 gamma in the heterodimer; such a compensatory assembly does not occur.\n- Option E is incorrect because transcriptional downregulation of TCR alpha and beta is not the compensatory mechanism; the primary defect is at the level of assembly and trafficking with ER retention and degradation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that incomplete TCR complexes are retained in the ER and degraded, leading to profoundly decreased or absent surface TCR expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2279873"}, {"introduction": "With the TCR complex assembled and its key structural features understood, we now zoom in on the molecular switch that initiates the intracellular signal cascade. The interaction between phosphorylated ITAMs and the kinase ZAP-70 is a cornerstone of T-cell activation, requiring precise molecular recognition. This problem ([@problem_id:2279882]) uses a hypothetical site-directed mutation to test your understanding of the specific structural requirements for this critical protein-protein interaction, which ultimately governs the T-cell's response.", "problem": "T-cell activation is a critical event in the adaptive immune response, initiated by the T-cell Receptor (TCR) recognizing a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on an antigen-presenting cell. The TCR itself has no intrinsic signaling capacity. Instead, it is non-covalently associated with the CD3 complex, which includes the CD3ζ (zeta) homodimer. Each CD3ζ chain contains three intracellular Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs).\n\nThe canonical signaling pathway begins when TCR engagement leads to the activation of the Src-family kinase Lck. Lck then phosphorylates both tyrosine residues within the consensus sequence of the ITAMs (YxxL/I-x$_{6-8}$-YxxL/I). This dual phosphorylation creates a high-affinity docking site for the tandem SH2 domains of a cytosolic kinase, the Zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70). Upon recruitment to the plasma membrane, ZAP-70 is itself phosphorylated and activated by Lck. Activated ZAP-70 then phosphorylates key downstream adaptor proteins, such as the Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT), propagating the signal.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered T-cell line in which the endogenous CD3ζ gene has been replaced with a mutant version. In this mutant protein, the C-terminal tyrosine residue within every ITAM has been substituted with a phenylalanine (F). Phenylalanine is structurally similar to tyrosine but lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for phosphorylation. All other cellular components are wild-type.\n\nThese mutant T cells are stimulated with their cognate peptide-MHC complex. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the proximal T-cell signaling machinery immediately following this stimulation?\n\nA. Lck fails to become catalytically active, preventing any phosphorylation of the CD3ζ chains.\n\nB. The N-terminal tyrosines of the CD3ζ ITAMs become phosphorylated, but ZAP-70 is not efficiently recruited to the TCR complex, leading to a failure in LAT phosphorylation.\n\nC. ZAP-70 binds to the singly-phosphorylated ITAMs with normal affinity but cannot be activated by Lck because the second tyrosine site is absent.\n\nD. The TCR/CD3 complex is recognized as faulty and is rapidly degraded, preventing any possibility of signal initiation.\n\nE. ZAP-70 fails to bind, but the related kinase Syk, normally found in B cells, is recruited as a compensatory mechanism, leading to a modified but functional signal.", "solution": "TCR engagement with peptide-MHC initiates proximal signaling by activating the Src-family kinase Lck via co-receptor interactions. This step does not require intact, doubly phosphorylatable ITAMs on CD3ζ; thus, Lck becomes catalytically active upon stimulation in both wild-type and mutant cells.\n\nIn the wild-type case, active Lck phosphorylates both tyrosines within each ITAM consensus sequence $YxxL/I-x_{6-8}-YxxL/I$, producing doubly phosphorylated ITAMs that create a high-affinity docking site for the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70. Stable membrane recruitment of ZAP-70 via both SH2 domains is required for efficient subsequent phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 by Lck, and for phosphorylation of LAT downstream.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, the C-terminal tyrosine in every ITAM is replaced by phenylalanine, which cannot be phosphorylated. Consequently:\n- Lck activation still occurs upon TCR engagement because it is upstream of ITAM phosphorylation.\n- Lck can phosphorylate only the remaining N-terminal tyrosine in each ITAM; the C-terminal site is absent, so no ITAM can become doubly phosphorylated.\n- ZAP-70’s tandem SH2 domains require two phosphotyrosines in the correct spacing/orientation for high-affinity binding; with only a single phosphotyrosine per ITAM, binding is weak and not efficiently sustained.\n- Without efficient recruitment, ZAP-70 is not effectively activated by Lck at the TCR complex, and LAT is not phosphorylated.\n\nTherefore, the immediate proximal signaling state is that the N-terminal tyrosines are phosphorylated by Lck, but ZAP-70 is not efficiently recruited, leading to failure in LAT phosphorylation. This corresponds to option B. Options A and D are incorrect because Lck activation and complex stability do not depend on intact C-terminal ITAM tyrosines in this immediate timeframe. Option C is incorrect because ZAP-70 does not bind singly phosphorylated ITAMs with normal affinity, and the absence of the second ITAM tyrosine does not prevent Lck from catalyzing ZAP-70 phosphorylation per se; it prevents ZAP-70 recruitment. Option E is not accurate for T cells under these conditions; compensatory Syk recruitment is not a typical immediate mechanism here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2279882"}]}
