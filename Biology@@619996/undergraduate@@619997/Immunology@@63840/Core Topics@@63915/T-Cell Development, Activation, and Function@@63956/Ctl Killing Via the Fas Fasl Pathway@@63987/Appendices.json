One primary mechanism they employ is the induction of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, in the target cell via the extrinsic pathway. This process begins when the Fas ligand (FasL) protein on the surface of the CTL binds to the Fas receptor on the target cell. This binding event triggers the recruitment of an adapter protein and multiple copies of an inactive enzyme precursor, procaspase-8, to the intracellular domain of the Fas receptor, forming a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC). The close proximity of procaspase-8 molecules within the DISC allows them to cleave and activate one another, yielding the active protease, caspase-8. Active caspase-8 then initiates a downstream cascade by activating executioner caspases, which orchestrate the systematic dismantling of the cell.\n\nConsider a specific line of virus-infected cells that possesses a homozygous genetic mutation. This mutation alters the procaspase-8 protein such that it can still be successfully recruited to the DISC upon FasL-Fas receptor binding, but it is completely resistant to proteolytic cleavage.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate outcome for these mutant cells when they are targeted by CTLs attempting to induce apoptosis via the Fas pathway?\n\nA. Apoptosis will be initiated, but at a much slower rate than in cells with wild-type procaspase-8.\n\nB. The CTL will fail to bind to the mutant target cell because the Fas receptor will be non-functional.\n\nC. The formation of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) will be blocked.\n\nD. The signal for apoptosis will be halted, and the executioner caspases will not be activated.\n\nE. The CTL will switch to an alternative killing mechanism, such as the perforin-granzyme pathway, causing the cell to lyse immediately.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the consequence of a mutation that prevents the cleavage of procaspase-8 within the context of CTL-mediated apoptosis via the Fas pathway. Let's analyze the signaling cascade step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initiation of Signaling:** A CTL recognizes a virus-infected target cell. The Fas ligand (FasL) on the CTL binds to the Fas receptor on the surface of the target cell. The problem does not state any mutation in FasL or the Fas receptor, so this initial binding step will occur normally.\n\n2.  **Formation of the DISC:** Upon FasL-Fas binding, the intracellular components are recruited. The problem states that the mutant procaspase-8 \"can still be successfully recruited to the DISC.\" This means the adapter proteins and the mutant procaspase-8 molecules will assemble correctly at the Fas receptor. Therefore, the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) will form.\n\n3.  **Activation of the Initiator Caspase:** The next crucial step in the normal pathway is the auto-activation of procaspase-8 molecules within the DISC. This activation occurs through proteolytic cleavage. However, the problem explicitly states that the mutant procaspase-8 is \"completely resistant to proteolytic cleavage.\"\n\n4.  **Consequence of the Block:** Because procaspase-8 cannot be cleaved, the active enzyme, caspase-8, cannot be generated. Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase in this pathway. Its role is to propagate the death signal by cleaving and activating the downstream \"executioner\" caspases (e.g., caspase-3, -6, -7). Without active caspase-8, this downstream activation cannot happen.\n\n5.  **Final Outcome:** The entire apoptotic signal is arrested at the step of procaspase-8 activation. The signal is received at the cell surface, the initial complex (DISC) is formed, but the signal cannot be transduced to the executioner machinery of the cell. Consequently, the cell will not undergo apoptosis via this pathway.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A. Apoptosis will be initiated, but at a much slower rate than in cells with wild-type procaspase-8.** This is incorrect. Activation is completely blocked, not just slowed down. No active caspase-8 means no initiation of the executioner phase.\n*   **B. The CTL will fail to bind to the mutant target cell because the Fas receptor will be non-functional.** This is incorrect. The mutation is in procaspase-8, which is an intracellular protein. The interaction between the CTL's FasL and the cell's Fas receptor is an extracellular event and is unaffected.\n*   **C. The formation of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) will be blocked.** This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that the mutant procaspase-8 can be recruited to the DISC, meaning the complex does form. The defect is in the function of the complex, not its assembly.\n*   **D. The signal for apoptosis will be halted, and the executioner caspases will not be activated.** This is the correct conclusion. The inability to activate procaspase-8 creates a definitive stop in the signaling cascade, preventing the activation of the downstream executioner caspases that are required for cell death.\n*   **E. The CTL will switch to an alternative killing mechanism, such as the perforin-granzyme pathway, causing the cell to lyse immediately.** While CTLs do possess the perforin-granzyme pathway as an alternative, this option describes the action of the CTL, not the direct outcome *within the target cell* due to the specific mutation in the Fas pathway. The question asks for the consequence of the mutation itself, which is the halting of the Fas-mediated signal. This option is a potential subsequent event, not the immediate outcome of the signaling block.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2309852"}, {"introduction": "The immune system is in a constant evolutionary arms race with pathogens and cancer cells, which often develop strategies to evade destruction. This exercise [@problem_id:2223476] presents a classic immune escape scenario where a tumor cell loses the Fas receptor. By predicting the outcome of its encounter with a Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL), you will explore the vital concept of functional redundancy in the immune system, specifically the independence of the Fas/FasL and perforin/granzyme killing pathways.", "problem": "A line of tumor cells is being studied for its interaction with the immune system. In vitro experiments show that these tumor cells are recognized and targeted by activated Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs are known to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells through two primary, independent mechanisms. The first is a contact-dependent pathway involving the Fas Ligand (FasL) on the CTL surface binding to the Fas receptor on the target cell. The second involves the directed release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes onto the target cell.\n\nThrough a process of mutation and selection, a sub-clone of the tumor cell line emerges that has completely lost the expression of the Fas receptor on its cell surface. An activated CTL, which is fully capable of utilizing both the FasL and the perforin/granzyme pathways, encounters one of these mutated, Fas-deficient tumor cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this specific interaction?\n\nA. The tumor cell will be completely resistant to killing by the CTL because the Fas/FasL interaction is essential for apoptosis induction.\n\nB. The CTL will still be able to induce apoptosis in the tumor cell using the perforin and granzyme pathway.\n\nC. The CTL will become anergic (a state of non-responsiveness) because its FasL cannot engage a target receptor.\n\nD. The CTL will degranulate, releasing perforin and granzymes, but this will be ineffective without the concurrent signaling from the Fas/FasL pathway.\n\nE. The tumor cell, lacking the Fas receptor, will use an alternative mechanism to induce apoptosis in the attacking CTL.", "solution": "We begin by stating the two primary, independent mechanisms by which activated Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) induce apoptosis in target cells: (i) a contact-dependent death receptor pathway in which CTL-expressed Fas Ligand (FasL) binds to Fas (CD95) on the target cell, triggering the extrinsic apoptosis cascade via caspase activation; and (ii) a granule exocytosis pathway in which the CTL releases perforin to form membrane pores and granzymes that enter the target cell to activate caspases and mitochondrial pathways, leading to apoptosis. The key premise is that these mechanisms are independent; the efficacy of the perforin/granzyme pathway does not require concurrent Fas/FasL signaling.\n\nIn the described scenario, the mutated tumor sub-clone has completely lost Fas receptor expression. Consequently, the Fas/FasL pathway is nonfunctional in this interaction because the ligand (FasL) has no receptor to engage. However, the CTL is fully competent for both pathways, and the granule exocytosis pathway remains intact. Perforin can create pores in the target membrane, enabling granzymes to enter and activate apoptotic machinery independently of Fas signaling.\n\nWe evaluate each option:\nA. Incorrect, because Fas/FasL is not essential when the perforin/granzyme pathway is available; CTLs can still induce apoptosis via granzymes delivered through perforin pores.\nB. Correct, because the CTL can utilize the perforin and granzyme pathway to induce apoptosis in the Fas-deficient tumor cell, independent of Fas/FasL.\nC. Incorrect, because CTL anergy is related to deficient antigenic stimulation or costimulation during priming, not to failure of FasL engagement during effector function.\nD. Incorrect, because degranulation-mediated killing is effective without concurrent Fas/FasL signaling; the granule pathway operates independently.\nE. Incorrect, because the tumor’s loss of Fas does not confer a mechanism to kill the CTL; no information supports reverse signaling that would induce CTL apoptosis in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the CTL will still kill the tumor cell via the perforin/granzyme pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2223476"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical scenarios to experimental reality is a cornerstone of scientific training.
