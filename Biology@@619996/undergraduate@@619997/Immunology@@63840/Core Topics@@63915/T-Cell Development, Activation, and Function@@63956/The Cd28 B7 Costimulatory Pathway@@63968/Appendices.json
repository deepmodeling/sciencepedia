By predicting the outcome of an infection in a mouse lacking the costimulatory receptor CD28, you will solidify your understanding of why this second signal is absolutely indispensable for mounting a primary adaptive immune response. [@problem_id:2274251]", "problem": "The activation of a naive T-cell, a critical event for initiating an adaptive immune response, is governed by a \"two-signal\" model. The first signal is delivered when the T-cell Receptor (TCR) on the T-cell surface recognizes a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC). However, this signal alone is insufficient for full activation. A second, costimulatory signal, delivered by the interaction of other pairs of molecules on the T-cell and the APC, is also required.\n\nConsider a laboratory mouse that has been genetically engineered to be a \"knockout\" for the CD28 gene. This means the mouse is unable to produce the CD28 protein, which is normally expressed on the surface of its T-cells and serves as a key costimulatory receptor. This mouse is then infected for the first time with a specific pathogenic virus that it has never encountered before.\n\nBased on your understanding of T-cell activation, which of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence for this mouse's ability to combat the primary viral infection?\n\nA. The mouse will mount a hyper-aggressive and uncontrolled T-cell response, leading to severe immunopathology.\n\nB. The mouse's T-cells will fail to become properly activated, leading to a severely compromised adaptive immune response and an inability to clear the virus.\n\nC.

The mouse will exhibit normal cytotoxic T-cell activity against infected cells, but will be unable to produce virus-specific antibodies.\n\nE. The mouse will successfully clear the initial viral infection but will be unable to form a long-lasting immunological memory.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the immunological outcome in a mouse lacking the CD28 protein when faced with a primary viral infection. This requires understanding the two-signal model of naive T-cell activation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the role of CD28 in T-cell activation.**\nNaive T-cell activation is the process by which a T-cell that has not previously encountered its specific antigen is triggered to proliferate and differentiate into an effector cell. This process requires two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC), such as a dendritic cell that has captured viral antigens.\n*   **Signal 1 (Antigen-specific signal):** This is provided by the binding of the T-cell Receptor (TCR) and its co-receptor (CD4 or CD8) to the peptide-MHC complex on the APC surface. This signal confers specificity to the response.\n*   **Signal 2 (Costimulatory signal):** This is an antigen-independent signal required for full activation. The most critical and well-studied costimulatory interaction for naive T-cells is the binding of the CD28 protein on the T-cell to B7 proteins (B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86) on the APC. APCs upregulate B7 proteins only when they detect signs of infection or inflammation (e.g., through pattern recognition receptors).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the consequence of receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2.**\nA central tenet of immunology is that if a naive T-cell receives Signal 1 (TCR engagement) in the absence of Signal 2 (costimulation), it does not become an activated effector cell. Instead, it enters a state of long-lived functional unresponsiveness known as **anergy**. An anergic T-cell cannot be properly activated even if it later encounters an APC providing both signals. In some cases, receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2 can also lead to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the T-cell. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, as it ensures T-cells are only activated in the context of a genuine infection signaled by the APC.\n\n**Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the CD28 knockout mouse.**\nThe mouse in the problem is a CD28 knockout, meaning its T-cells lack the CD28 protein. When this mouse is infected with a virus, its APCs will process viral antigens and present them on MHC molecules. Naive T-cells specific to these viral antigens will recognize them and receive Signal 1. However, because the T-cells lack CD28, they cannot engage with the B7 proteins on the APCs. Therefore, they will not receive the essential Signal 2.\n\nConsequently, the virus-specific T-cells in this mouse will become anergic or die. They will fail to proliferate and differentiate into effector helper T-cells (which are needed to help B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells) and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (which are needed to kill virus-infected cells). The result is a failure to mount an effective adaptive immune response.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A. The mouse will mount a hyper-aggressive and uncontrolled T-cell response...** This is incorrect. CD28 is a positive, activating signal. Its absence would lead to a lack of response, not a hyper-response. A hyper-response might be seen if a negative regulator (like CTLA-4 or PD-1) were knocked out.\n*   **B. The mouse's T-cells will fail to become properly activated...** This is correct. The lack of Signal 2 (via CD28) prevents T-cell activation and leads to anergy, crippling the adaptive immune response and making it impossible to clear the virus.\n*   **C. The mouse's immune response will be completely normal...** This is incorrect. While some other costimulatory molecules exist, the CD28-B7 pathway is non-redundant and essential for the activation of naive T-cells. Other pathways cannot fully compensate for its absence in a primary response.\n*   **D. The mouse will exhibit normal cytotoxic T-cell activity, but will be unable to produce virus-specific antibodies.** This is incorrect. The activation of both cytotoxic T-cells and the helper T-cells required for antibody production is dependent on the initial activation step that requires CD28. Therefore, both arms of the T-cell response will be deficient.\n*   **E. The mouse will successfully clear the initial viral infection but will be unable to form a long-lasting immunological memory.** This is incorrect. The defect occurs at the very beginning of the adaptive responseâ€”the initial activation. The mouse will not be able to effectively clear the virus in the first place, so the question of memory formation is secondary and also would not occur properly.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a severe failure of the adaptive immune response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2274251"}, {"introduction": "While activation signals are essential, the immune system also relies on powerful inhibitory 'checkpoints' to maintain control and prevent autoimmunity.

The engagement of CD28 provides a positive, activating costimulatory signal essential for T-cell proliferation and function. In contrast, the engagement of CTLA-4, which binds to the same ligands as CD28 but with a much higher affinity, provides a negative, inhibitory signal that downregulates the T-cell response.\n\nTo achieve the therapeutic goal of boosting T-cell-mediated tumor destruction, which of the following strategies represents the most sound immunological approach?\n\nA.

Effective activation of naive T cells requires Signal 1 (TCR recognition of peptide-MHC) and Signal 2 (costimulatory input). CD28 delivers a positive costimulatory signal upon binding to its ligands on APCs (B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86), promoting T-cell proliferation and effector function. CTLA-4 also binds the same ligands but with much higher affinity than CD28 and transmits an inhibitory signal, thereby dampening T-cell activation by outcompeting CD28 for ligand binding and delivering negative regulatory signals.\n\nTo boost antitumor T-cell responses, the rational strategy is to remove inhibitory signals while preserving or enhancing positive costimulation. Blocking CD28 would remove the positive costimulatory signal and inhibit T-cell activation, which is counter to the therapeutic goal. Activating CTLA-4 would increase inhibitory signaling, also counterproductive. Engineering a soluble CTLA-4 protein (CTLA-4-Ig) would sequester B7 ligands and prevent their engagement with CD28, thereby suppressing costimulation; this is an immunosuppressive approach used clinically for autoimmune diseases, not for enhancing antitumor immunity. In contrast, an antagonist antibody that blocks CTLA-4 prevents its inhibitory signaling and reduces its competition with CD28 for B7 ligands, thereby shifting the balance toward activation and proliferation of T cells. This strategy is exemplified by clinically validated immune checkpoint blockade targeting CTLA-4.\n\nTherefore, the most sound immunological approach to enhance T-cell-mediated tumor destruction is to develop an antagonist antibody that blocks CTLA-4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2274238"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative descriptions, this exercise challenges you to quantify the process of T-cell activation.
