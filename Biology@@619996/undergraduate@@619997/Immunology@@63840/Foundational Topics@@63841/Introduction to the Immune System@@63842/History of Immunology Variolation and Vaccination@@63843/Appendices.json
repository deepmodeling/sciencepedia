This exercise places you in the role of an 18th-century public health analyst, tasked with evaluating the practice of variolation. By calculating and comparing case-fatality rates from hypothetical historical data [@problem_id:2233616], you will gain a quantitative understanding of the significant, yet imperfect, protection that variolation offered compared to the devastating toll of a natural infection.", "problem": "In the 18th century, before Edward Jenner's development of the smallpox vaccine, a method known as variolation was used to confer immunity to smallpox. This procedure involved deliberately inoculating a healthy individual with infectious material (pus) taken from a pustule of a person with a mild case of smallpox. While this often resulted in a less severe infection and subsequent immunity, the procedure was not without risk.\n\nConsider the following historical data, representative of the situation in London during the 1720s:\n\n1.  A group of physicians meticulously tracked 897 individuals who chose to undergo variolation. Of this group, 17 died as a direct result of the procedure-induced smallpox infection.\n2.  City-wide public health records from the same era indicate that in a typical population, about 1 in 8 people contracted smallpox naturally during their lifetime. From a sample of 1,350 individuals documented to have contracted smallpox naturally (i.e., not through variolation), 243 died from the disease.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the ratio of the case-fatality rate for naturally acquired smallpox to the case-fatality rate for variolation. Express your answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We are asked for the ratio of the case-fatality rate (CFR) for naturally acquired smallpox to the CFR for variolation. By definition, CFR is the number of deaths among cases divided by the number of cases. The given figure that about 1 in 8 people contracted smallpox naturally during their lifetime is an incidence proportion and is not needed for computing the CFR ratio, since we have direct case and death counts for both groups.\n\nFor naturally acquired smallpox, the CFR is\n$$\n\\text{CFR}_{\\text{natural}}=\\frac{243}{1350}.\n$$\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $27$:\n$$\n\\frac{243}{1350}=\\frac{9}{50}.\n$$\n\nFor variolation, the CFR is\n$$\n\\text{CFR}_{\\text{variolation}}=\\frac{17}{897}.\n$$\n\nThe required ratio is\n$$\nR=\\frac{\\text{CFR}_{\\text{natural}}}{\\text{CFR}_{\\text{variolation}}}=\\frac{\\frac{243}{1350}}{\\frac{17}{897}}=\\frac{243\\cdot 897}{1350\\cdot 17}.\n$$\nUsing the simplification $\\frac{243}{1350}=\\frac{9}{50}$,\n$$\nR=\\frac{9}{50}\\cdot\\frac{897}{17}=\\frac{9\\cdot 897}{50\\cdot 17}=\\frac{8073}{850}.\n$$\nCompute the decimal value and round to three significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{8073}{850}\\approx 9.4976470588\\ \\Rightarrow\\ R\\approx 9.50\\ \\text{(three significant figures)}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.50}$$", "id": "2233616"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the analysis of historical risk, this problem challenges you to think prospectively as a public health official facing an imminent epidemic.

Based on data from similar outbreaks, public health officials estimate that if no preventative measures are taken, any given individual has a 40% probability of contracting the disease. The form of smallpox circulating has a fatality rate of 30% among those who become infected.\n\nAs an alternative to inaction, the town's physicians propose a widespread program of variolation, an early form of inoculation. In this procedure, material from smallpox sores is introduced into a healthy person's body to induce a milder form of the disease and confer immunity. While generally effective, the variolation procedure itself is not without risk and is estimated to be fatal in 2% of cases. Assume the program would be mandatory, and every resident of the town would undergo the procedure.\n\nCalculate the difference in the expected total number of deaths between the scenario where no action is taken and the scenario where universal variolation is implemented.

A team of virologists has managed to partially sequence the genome of the historical vaccinia virus strain within the lymph, which we will call `V_hist`. The origin of early vaccinia strains is a subject of historical debate, with leading candidates being Horsepox virus (HPXV) or Cowpox virus (CPXV). To investigate the origin of `V_hist`, the team sequenced 20 phylogenetically informative Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) sites. For comparison, the corresponding SNP data from modern reference genomes of a Horsepox virus (HPXV), a Cowpox virus (CPXV), and a modern laboratory Vaccinia virus (VACV-Mod) were obtained.\n\nThe resulting SNP data is presented in the table below. The genome is analyzed in two contiguous segments: Segment A (sites S1-S10) and Segment B (sites S11-S20). Due to the age and degradation of the historical sample, the nucleotide could not be determined at some sites for `V_hist`, indicated by 'N'.\n\n| Site | HPXV | CPXV | VACV-Mod | V_hist |\n|:----:|:----:|:----:|:--------:|:------:|\n| S1   | A    | G    | T        | A      |\n| S2   | T    | C    | G        | T      |\n| S3   | G    | A    | C        | G      |\n| S4   | C    | T    | A        | C      |\n| S5   | A    | G    | T        | A      |\n| S6   | G    | C    | A        | N      |\n| S7   | T    | A    | G        | T      |\n| S8   | C    | G    | T        | C      |\n| S9   | A    | C    | G        | A      |\n| S10  | T    | G    | C        | T      |\n| S11  | G    | A    | T        | A      |\n| S12  | T    | C    | G        | C      |\n| S13  | C    | T    | A        | T      |\n| S14  | A    | G    | T        | G      |\n| S15  | G    | A    | C        | A      |\n| S16  | T    | C    | G        | C      |\n| S17  | C    | G    | A        | N      |\n| S18  | A    | T    | G        | T      |\n| S19  | G    | A    | C        | A      |\n| S20  | T    | C    | A        | C      |\n\nTo quantify the genetic relationship between `V_hist` and the candidate viruses, you will use a simple metric called the Pairwise SNP Mismatch Score (PSMS). The PSMS between `V_hist` and a candidate virus is defined as the number of SNP sites at which their nucleotides differ, divided by the total number of sites compared. Sites where `V_hist` has an 'N' are excluded from both the count of mismatches and the total count of sites compared.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided data, which of the following conclusions about the evolutionary history of `V_hist` is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. `V_hist` is a direct descendant of a Horsepox-like virus, and the observed differences are due to random mutations and data degradation.\n\nB. `V_hist` is a direct descendant of a Cowpox-like virus, and the observed differences are due to random mutations and data degradation.\n\nC. `V_hist` is most closely related to the modern laboratory Vaccinia strain (VACV-Mod).\n\nD. The data strongly suggests that `V_hist` is a product of a historical recombination event between a Horsepox-like virus and a Cowpox-like virus.\n\nE. The high number of mismatches and degraded sites ('N') makes it impossible to confidently determine the origin of `V_hist` from the given data.", "solution": "We are given SNPs at sites S1–S20 for HPXV, CPXV, VACV-Mod, and V_hist. The Pairwise SNP Mismatch Score (PSMS) between V_hist and a candidate virus is defined as the number of mismatched SNP sites divided by the total number of sites compared, excluding sites where V_hist is 'N'. Formally, if $n$ is the number of sites where V_{\\text{hist}} is determined and $m_{X}$ is the number of sites at which V_{\\text{hist}} differs from candidate $X$, then the PSMS is\n$$\n\\text{PSMS}(X)=\\frac{m_{X}}{n}.\n$$\nFrom the table, V_hist has 'N' at S6 and S17, so these two sites are excluded. Therefore, the total number of sites compared is\n$$\nn=20-2=18.\n$$\nWe analyze by contiguous genome segments as given.\n\nSegment A (S1–S10, excluding S6): The observed V_hist nucleotides at S1–S5 and S7–S10 exactly match HPXV at each site and differ from both CPXV and VACV-Mod at each site. Hence, within Segment A,\n$$\nm_{\\text{HPXV},A}=0,\\quad m_{\\text{CPXV},A}=9,\\quad m_{\\text{VACV},A}=9.\n$$\n\nSegment B (S11–S20, excluding S17): The observed V_hist nucleotides at S11–S16 and S18–S20 exactly match CPXV at each site and differ from both HPXV and VACV-Mod at each site. Hence, within Segment B,\n$$\nm_{\\text{CPXV},B}=0,\\quad m_{\\text{HPXV},B}=9,\\quad m_{\\text{VACV},B}=9.\n$$\n\nCombining segments, the total mismatches across the 18 compared sites are\n$$\nm_{\\text{HPXV}}=m_{\\text{HPXV},A}+m_{\\text{HPXV},B}=0+9=9,\n$$\n$$\nm_{\\text{CPXV}}=m_{\\text{CPXV},A}+m_{\\text{CPXV},B}=9+0=9,\n$$\n$$\nm_{\\text{VACV}}=m_{\\text{VACV},A}+m_{\\text{VACV},B}=9+9=18.\n$$\nThus the PSMS values are\n$$\n\\text{PSMS}(\\text{HPXV})=\\frac{9}{18}=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad \\text{PSMS}(\\text{CPXV})=\\frac{9}{18}=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad \\text{PSMS}(\\text{VACV-Mod})=\\frac{18}{18}=1.\n$$\n\nInterpretation: V_hist is equally distant from HPXV and CPXV overall but is much more distant from VACV-Mod. Crucially, the mismatches are not randomly distributed: Segment A is entirely HPXV-like (perfect match to HPXV across all informative sites with data), while Segment B is entirely CPXV-like (perfect match to CPXV across all informative sites with data). This contiguous block pattern is a hallmark of recombination, as random mutations and data degradation would not be expected to produce two clean, adjacent segments each matching a different parental lineage across all informative sites. The presence of only two undetermined sites (S6 in Segment A and S17 in Segment B) does not compromise this inference, because the remaining nine sites in each segment provide complete and concordant evidence for the respective parental affinities.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is that V_hist is a mosaic consistent with a historical recombination event between a Horsepox-like virus and a Cowpox-like virus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2233645"}]}
