This foundational exercise introduces flow cytometry, a powerful technique used to distinguish cell populations based on their unique surface markers, known as Cluster of Differentiation (CD) antigens. You will apply the canonical definition of human Natural Killer (NK) cells to select the correct antibody panel, a skill essential for both immunology research and clinical diagnostics [@problem_id:2253289].", "problem": "An immunologist is tasked with analyzing a sample of human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), which primarily consists of lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, Natural Killer cells) and monocytes. The goal is to use flow cytometry to specifically identify the conventional Natural Killer (NK) cell population. The strategy involves using a two-antibody panel: one antibody to a cell surface marker that is absent on NK cells but present on the most abundant lymphocyte type (negative selection), and another antibody to a marker that is characteristically present on NK cells (positive selection).\n\nGiven the following common Cluster of Differentiation (CD) markers and their primary cellular associations:\n- **CD3**: A defining component of the T-cell receptor complex, found on all T cells.\n- **CD4**: A co-receptor found on helper T cells.\n- **CD8**: A co-receptor found on cytotoxic T cells.\n- **CD14**: A marker for monocytes.\n- **CD19**: A marker for B cells.\n- **CD56**: A neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) that serves as a canonical marker for human NK cells.\n\nWhich of the following marker combinations would be most effective for identifying the conventional NK cell population from the PBMC sample?

CD14-positive, CD19-negative (CD14+, CD19-)", "solution": "The task is to identify conventional Natural Killer cells in human PBMCs using a two-antibody flow cytometry panel that applies a negative selection marker absent on NK cells but present on the most abundant lymphocyte type, together with a positive selection marker present on NK cells.\n\nFirst, among lymphocytes in PBMCs, T cells are typically the most abundant. T cells universally express CD3 as part of the T-cell receptor complex. Conventional NK cells do not express CD3. Therefore, using CD3 as a negative selection marker effectively excludes T cells while retaining NK cells and other non-T populations. This satisfies the requirement that the negative selection marker be absent on NK cells but present on the most abundant lymphocyte type.\n\nSecond, a canonical positive marker for human NK cells is CD56 (NCAM). Conventional human NK cells are identified as CD56-positive, with typical subsets defined by CD56 intensity, but the defining characteristic remains CD56 expression. Therefore, using CD56 as the positive selection marker will enrich for NK cells.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A (CD3-positive, CD19-positive) simultaneously selects T cells and B cells and does not isolate NK cells.\n- Option B (CD3-negative, CD56-positive) applies CD3 as a negative gate to remove T cells and CD56 as a positive gate to include NK cells, matching the standard strategy for identifying conventional NK cells.\n- Option C (CD4-positive, CD8-positive) selects a double-positive T-cell phenotype typical of thymocytes or certain activated T cells, not NK cells.\n- Option D (CD3-positive, CD56-positive) includes CD3-positive cells that co-express CD56, which are NKT cells or activated T cells, not conventional NK cells.\n- Option E (CD14-positive, CD19-negative) selects monocytes (CD14-positive) and excludes B cells, not NK cells.\n\nTherefore, the most effective combination to identify conventional NK cells from PBMCs is CD3-negative and CD56-positive, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2253289"}, {"introduction": "Once identified, we can investigate the core function of NK cells: their ability to eliminate target cells. This problem uses a hypothetical clinical scenario—a genetic defect in the perforin protein—to dissect the molecular machinery of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By understanding the distinct but coordinated roles of perforin and granzymes, you will gain crucial insight into how this innate immune process works and the consequences when a key component is missing [@problem_id:2253294].", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the protein perforin. Natural Killer (NK) cells are a critical component of the innate immune system responsible for the surveillance and elimination of virally infected cells and malignant cells. The primary mechanism by which NK cells induce death in a target cell is through the directed release of cytotoxic granules. These granules contain two key types of proteins: perforin and a family of serine proteases known as granzymes.\n\nConsidering the specific genetic defect in this patient, which of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence for the granule-mediated cytotoxic function of their NK cells when they encounter a suitable target cell?\n\nA. The NK cells will be unable to form a stable immunological synapse with the target cell, preventing granule release.\n\nB. The NK cells will be unable to synthesize or package granzymes into their cytotoxic granules.\n\nC. The NK cells will successfully release their granules, but the granzymes will be unable to enter the target cell's cytoplasm to initiate cell death.\n\nD. The NK cells will release granules containing only perforin, which will be sufficient to lyse the target cell through osmotic stress alone.\n\nE. The NK cells will switch to using antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) as their primary killing mechanism.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the direct functional consequence of a perforin deficiency on the primary killing mechanism of Natural Killer (NK) cells. Let's break down the normal process and then analyze the impact of the mutation.\n\n1.  **Normal NK Cell Cytotoxic Function:** The primary pathway for NK cells to kill target cells (like infected or tumor cells) is called granule-mediated cytotoxicity. This process involves several steps:\n    *   **Recognition and Synapse Formation:** The NK cell first recognizes a target cell through a balance of activating and inhibitory signals from its surface receptors. Upon strong activation, it forms a tight connection with the target cell called an immunological synapse. This focuses the subsequent attack.\n    *   **Granule Polarization and Release (Degranulation):** The NK cell reorganizes its cytoskeleton to move its cytotoxic granules towards the immunological synapse. It then releases the contents of these granules into the narrow space between the two cells.\n    *   **Action of Perforin:** Perforin molecules, released from the granules, insert themselves into the membrane of the target cell. There, they polymerize to form transmembrane pores or channels.\n    *   **Action of Granzymes:** Granzymes, which are serine proteases, are co-released with perforin. They enter the target cell's cytoplasm by passing through the pores created by perforin.\n    *   **Induction of Apoptosis:** Once inside the target cell, granzymes (particularly granzyme B) activate a cascade of enzymes called caspases. This activation is the central execution pathway of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, leading to the orderly dismantling and elimination of the target cell.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Patient's Defect:** The patient has a loss-of-function mutation in the perforin gene. This means their NK cells cannot produce functional perforin protein. All other components of the cytotoxic machinery are presumed to be normal.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Consequences:**\n    *   The NK cells can still recognize the target cell and form an immunological synapse. The genetic defect is in an effector protein (perforin), not in the recognition receptors.\n    *   The NK cells can still synthesize and package granzymes into granules, and they can still degranulate (release the granules) upon activation. The defect in perforin does not affect these upstream processes.\n    *   When the NK cells degranulate, they will release their granules containing granzymes but lacking functional perforin.\n    *   **The critical failure point:** Without functional perforin, no pores can be formed in the target cell's membrane.\n    *   Therefore, the granzymes that are released into the synaptic cleft cannot gain entry into the target cell's cytoplasm. They are effectively blocked from reaching their intracellular targets (the caspases).\n    *   As a result, the primary pathway of inducing apoptosis is aborted. The NK cells attempt to kill, but the lethal payload (granzymes) cannot be delivered.\n\n4.  **Assessing the Options:**\n    *   A. This is incorrect. Recognition and synapse formation are mediated by cell surface receptors, which are unaffected by the perforin mutation.\n    *   B. This is incorrect. The mutation is in the perforin gene, not the granzyme genes or genes related to granule biogenesis.\n    *   C. This is the correct description of the outcome. The NK cell can perform all steps up to and including granule release. However, the lack of perforin pores prevents the subsequent entry of granzymes, thereby neutralizing the cytotoxic effect of this pathway.\n    *   D. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the patient's cells cannot produce functional perforin. Second, while extremely high concentrations of perforin can cause some osmotic lysis, the primary physiological role of the amounts released is to facilitate granzyme entry, not to cause lysis directly.\n    *   E. This is incorrect. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a specific mechanism that requires antibodies to be bound to the target cell. While NK cells *can* perform ADCC, the question asks about the direct impact on their *primary*, intrinsic granule-mediated pathway. The defect cripples this primary pathway; it doesn't automatically cause a switch to another one as the primary mode of action in all situations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2253294"}, {"introduction": "The decision for an NK cell to kill is not arbitrary; it is governed by a sophisticated \"balance of signals\" that weighs signs of \"self\" against signs of \"danger.\" This thought experiment moves beyond the simple 'missing-self' hypothesis by exploring how a tumor cell can be killed despite expressing normal levels of MHC class I molecules. This exercise highlights how strong signals from stress-induced ligands can engage activating receptors and override inhibitory signals, providing a more complete and accurate model of NK cell recognition [@problem_id:2253325].", "problem": "In an experimental study, a particular line of human tumor cells is co-cultured with components of the immune system. The researchers observe two key phenomena:\n1. The tumor cells are not effectively killed when exposed to patient-matched, tumor-infiltrating Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs).\n2. The tumor cells are efficiently lysed when exposed to Natural Killer (NK) cells.\n\nFurther analysis of the tumor cell surface reveals that the expression levels of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules are normal and comparable to healthy, non-cancerous cells from the same patient.\n\nGiven this set of observations, which of the following provides the most plausible explanation for the tumor cells' sensitivity to NK-cell-mediated killing?\n\nA. The tumor cells have selectively lost the expression of self-MHC class I molecules, which is not detected by the overall surface level measurement.\n\nB. The NK cells are recognizing a specific tumor-derived peptide antigen presented by the MHC class I molecules on the tumor cell surface.\n\nC. The tumor cells are expressing high levels of stress-induced ligands that engage activating receptors on the NK cells, and the resulting activation signal overrides the inhibitory signal from MHC class I.\n\nD. The killing mechanism is exclusively Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC), where antibodies have coated the tumor cell, targeting it for destruction by NK cells.\n\nE. The tumor cells fail to express co-stimulatory molecules like B7, which is a necessary signal for NK cell activation.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) require recognition of a specific tumor-derived peptide presented by self MHC class I via the T cell receptor; absence or alteration of the relevant peptide or additional tumor-mediated suppressive mechanisms can prevent CTL killing even when MHC class I surface levels are normal.\n- Natural killer (NK) cell effector function follows the balance-of-signals model: inhibitory receptors (such as KIRs) engaged by self MHC class I deliver inhibitory signals, while activating receptors (such as NKG2D, DNAM-1, and natural cytotoxicity receptors) recognize stress-induced ligands (for example, MICA, MICB, ULBPs) and deliver activating signals. NK-mediated lysis occurs if the net activating signal exceeds the inhibitory signal. The “missing-self” paradigm explains killing when MHC class I is downregulated; the “induced-self” paradigm explains killing despite normal MHC class I when stress ligands are high enough to override inhibition.\n\nApplication to observations:\n1. Tumor cells are not killed by patient-matched tumor-infiltrating CTLs despite normal MHC class I surface levels. This is consistent with failure of CTL recognition due to loss or alteration of the specific antigenic peptide, defects in antigen processing for that peptide, or other tumor-induced T cell dysfunction—none of which preclude normal total MHC class I expression.\n2. Tumor cells are efficiently lysed by NK cells while total MHC class I levels are normal. Because self MHC class I would engage inhibitory NK receptors, NK killing in this setting requires an overriding activating signal, most plausibly due to upregulated stress-induced ligands on the tumor.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Selective loss of self-MHC class I expression (allele-specific loss) could reduce inhibitory signaling, but the data state overall MHC class I levels are normal and comparable to healthy cells. While allele-specific loss is theoretically possible, the most direct and broadly consistent explanation for robust NK killing with normal total MHC class I is strong activating-ligand expression, not undetected selective loss.\n- B: NK cells do not recognize specific peptide antigens presented by MHC class I via a TCR; that is a CTL mechanism. This is incorrect for NK biology.\n- C: High expression of stress-induced ligands engaging activating NK receptors provides strong activation that can override inhibition from self MHC class I. This precisely explains NK sensitivity despite normal MHC class I and aligns with the induced-self and balance-of-signals model.\n- D: ADCC requires target-bound antibodies engaging CD16 on NK cells. The scenario does not indicate the presence of tumor-specific antibodies coating the cells; moreover, the key contrast between failed CTL killing and efficient NK killing with normal MHC class I is better explained by stress-ligand-driven activation rather than obligatory ADCC.\n- E: B7 co-stimulation is pertinent to T cell activation (via CD28), not NK cell activation. NK cells use distinct activating and inhibitory receptors; lack of B7 does not explain NK-mediated killing.\n\nConclusion:\nThe most plausible explanation is that tumor cells express high levels of stress-induced ligands that robustly activate NK cells, overriding the inhibitory signals delivered by normal self MHC class I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2253325"}]}
