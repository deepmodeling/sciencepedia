This first exercise [@problem_id:2264476] is a thought experiment that asks us to consider what happens on a host cell surface stripped of its primary membrane-bound protectors. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, we can gain a fundamental appreciation for why proteins like Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF, or CD55) and Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP, or CD46) are essential for preventing autoimmune pathology.", "problem": "The complement system is a critical part of the innate immune response. The alternative pathway of this system is characterized by a constant, low-level activation process known as \"tick-over,\" where C3 protein is spontaneously hydrolyzed in the plasma. This can lead to the deposition of the active fragment C3b onto nearby surfaces. On healthy host cells, membrane-bound regulatory proteins, such as Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF, or CD55) and Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP, or CD46), prevent the complement cascade from causing damage. DAF accelerates the dissociation of the C3 convertase, while MCP acts as a cofactor for an enzyme called Factor I to cleave and inactivate C3b.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic disorder where a patient's cells are completely unable to express any membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins. Due to the normal tick-over process, a single molecule of C3b covalently attaches to the surface of one of this patient's red blood cells and subsequently binds Factor B, which is then cleaved by Factor D to form a functional alternative pathway C3 convertase ($C3bBb$). All plasma-based components of the complement system, including the positive regulator Properdin and the fluid-phase regulator Factor H, are present and functional.\n\nWhat is the most accurate description of the immediate fate and consequence of this single, newly formed $C3bBb$ convertase on the host cell surface?\n\nA. The convertase will be unable to function because Properdin only stabilizes convertases on microbial surfaces.\n\nB. The convertase will be immediately inactivated as its C3b component is cleaved by the plasma enzyme Factor I, which does not require a membrane-bound cofactor.\n\nC. The convertase will be temporarily stabilized by Properdin, leading to a powerful amplification loop that causes the rapid deposition of many more C3b molecules onto the cell surface.\n\nD. The convertase will form but will rapidly and spontaneously dissociate without cleaving any significant number of C3 molecules, rendering the pathway inert on the cell.", "solution": "The alternative pathway relies on continuous \"tick-over\" in which C3 is spontaneously hydrolyzed to yield C3b that can covalently attach to nearby surfaces via its reactive thioester. Once a C3b molecule is deposited on a membrane, it can bind Factor B; Factor D then cleaves Factor B to Bb, generating the alternative pathway C3 convertase, $C3bBb$.\n\nKey regulatory principles relevant to the immediate fate of this convertase are as follows:\n- $C3bBb$ has an intrinsic finite half-life but is functionally active during that interval, cleaving C3 to produce more C3b.\n- Properdin is a positive regulator that stabilizes $C3bBb$, increasing its half-life and thereby enhancing C3 cleavage. Properdin can stabilize convertases formed on host or microbial surfaces; its action is not restricted to microbial surfaces.\n- On healthy host cells, membrane-bound regulators DAF (CD55) and MCP (CD46) limit activation: DAF accelerates dissociation of Bb from $C3bBb$ (decay-accelerating activity), and MCP serves as a cofactor for Factor I to cleave C3b to iC3b, inactivating it for further convertase formation.\n- Factor I requires a cofactor to cleave C3b; these cofactors include membrane proteins (MCP, CR1) and the soluble plasma protein Factor H. Factor I does not act alone on C3b.\n- Factor H, present in plasma, both accelerates decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase and serves as a cofactor for Factor I to cleave C3b. On host cells, Factor H has enhanced binding due to recognition of polyanions such as sialic acids, but its effects must compete with convertase stabilization by Properdin.\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, all membrane-bound complement regulators are absent. Therefore:\n1) A single $C3bBb$ that has formed on the red blood cell is not subject to DAF-mediated decay acceleration nor MCP-dependent Factor I cofactor activity.\n2) Properdin, which is present and functional, can bind and stabilize the nascent $C3bBb$, prolonging its lifetime and increasing the number of C3 molecules it cleaves.\n3) Although Factor H in plasma can bind C3b on host surfaces and promote Factor I cleavage of C3b, it must first promote decay of the convertase or compete with Properdin for binding. In the absence of membrane-bound regulators, the balance of regulation is shifted toward persistence and activity of the convertase sufficient to initiate the alternative pathway amplification loop.\n4) Consequently, during the stabilized lifetime of $C3bBb$, substantial additional C3b will be generated and deposited on the same surface, amplifying opsonization and setting the stage for further complement activation.\n\nEvaluation of choices:\n- A is incorrect because Properdin can stabilize $C3bBb$ on host surfaces and the convertase can function even without Properdin; its function is not restricted to microbial surfaces.\n- B is incorrect because Factor I requires a cofactor; it does not cleave C3b independently. While Factor H can serve as a cofactor, immediate inactivation is unlikely in the face of Properdin-stabilized convertase and absence of membrane-bound regulators.\n- C is correct: Properdin will stabilize the new $C3bBb$, enabling an amplification loop that rapidly deposits more C3b on the cell.\n- D is incorrect because although $C3bBb$ can decay spontaneously, it typically cleaves a significant number of C3 molecules before dissociation, especially when stabilized by Properdin.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the convertase will be temporarily stabilized by Properdin, leading to rapid amplification with deposition of many more C3b molecules on the host cell surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2264476"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of the amplification loop's power, we now move from a qualitative to a quantitative perspective. Real-world pathologies often arise from subtle genetic changes that alter the kinetic balance of protein interactions.

A key enzymatic complex in this pathway is the C3 convertase, $C3bBb$, which is assembled on cell surfaces. This enzyme cleaves complement component C3, leading to a powerful amplification loop. To prevent damage to host cells, the activity of $C3bBb$ is tightly regulated.\n\nThe kinetic behavior of the convertase can be described by a total first-order decay constant, $k_{total}$, which is the sum of the intrinsic decay constant, $k_{int}$, and an effective rate constant representing the contribution from regulators like Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF), $k_{DAF\\_cat}$. Thus, $k_{total} = k_{int} + k_{DAF\\_cat}$. The total number of C3 molecules that a single convertase molecule is expected to cleave over its lifetime is inversely proportional to $k_{total}$. In a wild-type (WT) individual, on a host cell surface with physiological DAF concentration, the DAF-catalyzed contribution is dominant, with $k_{DAF\\_cat, WT}$ being nine times greater than $k_{int, WT}$.\n\nA patient presents with a severe complement-mediated pathology due to a gain-of-function mutation in the gene for Factor B. This mutation results in the formation of a hyper-stabilized $C3bBb$ convertase with the following altered kinetic properties:\n1. The intrinsic decay rate constant of the mutant convertase, $k_{int, MUT}$, is reduced to $20.0\\%$ of the wild-type intrinsic decay rate constant, $k_{int, WT}$.\n2. The mutation alters the convertase conformation, reducing its affinity for DAF. Consequently, the effective rate constant from DAF catalysis for the mutant, $k_{DAF\\_cat, MUT}$, is only $10.0\\%$ of the wild-type value, $k_{DAF\\_cat, WT}$.\n\nAssuming the catalytic turnover rate of the convertase for its substrate C3 is unaffected by the mutation, calculate the factor by which the total C3 cleavage potential of a single mutant convertase on a host cell is increased compared to a wild-type convertase.
