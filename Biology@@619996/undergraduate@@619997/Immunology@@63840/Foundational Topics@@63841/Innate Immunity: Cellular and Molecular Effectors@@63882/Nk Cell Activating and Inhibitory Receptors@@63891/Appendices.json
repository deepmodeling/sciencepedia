Their decision to kill a target cell is governed by a balance of signals received from inhibitory and activating receptors on their surface.\n\nThe signaling logic can be summarized as follows:\n*   **Inhibitory Signal:** NK cell inhibitory receptors bind to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. MHC class I is present on the surface of nearly all healthy, nucleated cells in the body. This binding delivers a potent inhibitory (\"do not kill\") signal.\n*   **Activating Signal:** NK cell activating receptors bind to a family of molecules called \"stress ligands.\" These ligands are generally absent on healthy cells but can be upregulated on cells experiencing stress, such as from viral infection or cancerous transformation. This binding delivers an activating (\"kill\") signal.\n\nAn NK cell will be triggered to kill a target cell if and only if the net signal it receives is activating.\n*   If a strong inhibitory signal from MHC class I binding is present, it will prevent killing, even in the presence of a weak or moderate activating signal.\n*   Killing occurs if a significant activating signal is present in the absence of an inhibitory signal.\n*   Killing can also occur if a very strong activating signal is present that is sufficient to overcome an existing inhibitory signal.\n*   If neither inhibitory nor activating ligands are present on the target cell, the NK cell remains in a neutral, non-cytotoxic state.\n\nGiven this information, in which of the following scenarios is the NK cell most likely to be activated to kill the target cell?\n\nA. The target is a healthy neuron, which expresses normal levels of MHC class I and no stress ligands.\n\nB. The target is a healthy platelet, which is an anucleate cell fragment and therefore expresses neither MHC class I nor stress ligands.\n\nC. The target is a cancerous lymphoma cell that, as a mechanism of immune evasion, has lost all surface expression of MHC class I but expresses a high density of stress ligands.\n\nD. The target is a cell infected with a virus, which has induced the expression of a moderate level of stress ligands while the cell's expression of MHC class I remains normal.", "solution": "Define two nonnegative signal magnitudes received by the NK cell: the inhibitory signal $S_{I}$ (primarily from MHC class I engagement) and the activating signal $S_{A}$ (from stress ligand engagement). The decision rule can be modeled as: killing occurs if and only if the net signal is activating, which we represent as the inequality\n$$\nS_{A}-S_{I}>0.\n$$\nThis captures the stated logic: a strong inhibitory signal (large $S_{I}$) can prevent killing even with weak or moderate $S_{A}$; absence of inhibitory signal ($S_{I}=0$) allows significant $S_{A}$ to trigger killing; and a very large $S_{A}$ can overcome a nonzero $S_{I}$. If both signals are absent ($S_{A}=0$ and $S_{I}=0$), the NK cell remains neutral (no killing).\n\nEvaluate each option:\nA. Healthy neuron with normal MHC class I and no stress ligands: $S_{I}$ is strong (normal MHC class I), $S_{A}\\approx 0$, so $S_{A}-S_{I}<0$; no killing.\nB. Healthy platelet with neither MHC class I nor stress ligands: $S_{I}=0$ and $S_{A}=0$, so $S_{A}-S_{I}=0$; neutral, no killing.\nC. Cancerous lymphoma lacking MHC class I but expressing high-density stress ligands: $S_{I}=0$ and $S_{A}$ is high, so $S_{A}-S_{I}>0$; killing occurs and is most likely.\nD. Virus-infected cell with moderate stress ligands but normal MHC class I: $S_{I}$ present and significant, $S_{A}$ moderate; given that only a very strong $S_{A}$ can overcome $S_{I}$, we have $S_{A}-S_{I}\\leq 0$; no killing.\n\nTherefore, the NK cell is most likely to be activated to kill in scenario C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2254863"}, {"introduction": "While a qualitative understanding of signal balance is essential, real biological systems operate on quantitative principles.

Their decision to kill a target cell is governed by a balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. This process can be modeled by assuming the cell integrates these signals into a net signal, $S_{net}$, which is then compared against an activation threshold, $S_{th}$.\n\nConsider a simplified model where the net signal is the sum of all activating signals minus the sum of all inhibitory signals: $S_{net} = S_{act} - S_{inh}$. The NK cell is activated to kill the target cell if and only if $S_{net} > S_{th}$. The signal strength generated by a specific receptor-ligand interaction (type $i$) is proportional to the densities of the receptor on the NK cell and the ligand on the target cell.

This final practice [@problem_id:2254906] delves into the biochemical heart of the inhibitory pathway by focusing on the crucial role of the phosphatase SHP-1. By considering the effect of a therapeutic drug that inhibits SHP-1, you will explore how manipulating these internal pathways can override the \"don't kill\" signal from MHC class I, unleashing the NK cell's cytotoxic potential against cancer cells.", "problem": "A new immunotherapy strategy is being tested for a specific form of liver cancer. The cancer cells in this disease are characterized by two key features: they maintain a normal surface expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules, but they also anomalously express high levels of ligands that bind to activating receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells. In a typical immune response, the presence of MHC class I would provide a dominant inhibitory signal to NK cells, preventing them from attacking the tumor.\n\nThe new therapeutic agent is a drug that selectively inhibits the function of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1). SHP-1 is a crucial intracellular enzyme recruited by NK cell inhibitory receptors upon their engagement with MHC class I.\n\nConsidering the specific signaling pathway involved, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of administering this SHP-1 inhibitor to a patient with this particular cancer, focusing on the direct interaction between NK cells and the tumor cells?\n\nA.

The drug will cause healthy liver cells to be attacked by NK cells, but it will have no effect on the tumor cells themselves.", "solution": "NK cells integrate signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. Inhibitory receptors such as KIRs or NKG2A recognize MHC class I on target cells and transmit inhibition through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Upon engagement, ITIMs become phosphorylated and recruit SHP-1, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates key intermediates in activating pathways, thereby suppressing cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Activating receptors (for example, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46) signal through adaptor molecules such as DAP10 or DAP12 and tyrosine kinases (for example, Syk, ZAP-70), promoting NK cell activation, degranulation, and target cell killing.\n\nIn the described tumor, cancer cells retain normal MHC class I expression (supporting inhibitory receptor engagement) but also express high levels of ligands for activating receptors (providing strong activating input). Under typical conditions, the inhibitory signal delivered via MHC class I engagement and propagated by SHP-1 dominates, preventing NK cell attack despite the presence of activating ligands.\n\nThe therapeutic agent selectively inhibits SHP-1 function. Although inhibitory receptors still physically bind MHC class I and their ITIMs may be phosphorylated, the critical biochemical effector of inhibition—SHP-1—is inactive. This disrupts the inhibitory signaling cascade downstream of inhibitory receptor engagement, removing the dominant brake on NK cell activation. Consequently, the activating signals generated by engagement of the highly expressed activating ligands can proceed effectively, leading to NK cell activation, degranulation, and destruction of the tumor cells.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because physical receptor-ligand binding without functional intracellular signaling via SHP-1 will not effectively transmit inhibition.\n- Option B is correct because SHP-1 inhibition biochemically abrogates the inhibitory pathway, allowing activating signaling to dominate and resulting in NK-mediated tumor cell killing.\n- Option C is incorrect because anergy is not expected from this scenario; rather, relief of inhibition shifts the balance toward activation.\n- Option D is incorrect because SHP-1 is an inhibitory phosphatase and is not required for activating-receptor signaling; its inhibition would not suppress activation.\n- Option E is incorrect because, in this context, tumor cells with high activating ligands become preferential targets; the question focuses on the direct NK-tumor interaction, predicting enhanced tumor cell destruction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that SHP-1 inhibition will enable NK cells to kill the tumor cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2254906"}]}
