This exercise [@problem_id:2224747] challenges you to apply the fundamental sorting rules that link an antigen's origin to either the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I or MHC class II presentation pathway. Mastering this concept is a cornerstone of understanding how the immune system tailors its response to different pathogens.", "problem": "A dendritic cell, a type of professional antigen-presenting cell, is simultaneously exposed to two distinct pathogenic challenges in a tissue environment. The first challenge is a soluble protein toxin, Antigen X, secreted by an extracellular bacterium. The second challenge is an active infection by an intracellular protozoan parasite, which synthesizes its own proteins within the cytoplasm of the dendritic cell; one such protein is Antigen Y. Dendritic cells process these antigens and present peptide fragments on their surface using Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to activate T-cells.\n\nBased on the canonical pathways for antigen processing and presentation, predict which MHC class of molecules will be predominantly used to present peptides derived from Antigen X and Antigen Y, respectively.\n\nA. Antigen X on MHC class I; Antigen Y on MHC class II.\n\nB. Antigen X on MHC class II; Antigen Y on MHC class I.\n\nC. Both Antigen X and Antigen Y on MHC class I.\n\nD. Both Antigen X and Antigen Y on MHC class II.\n\nE. The presentation pathway for both antigens depends on whether the responding T-cell is a helper or a cytotoxic T-cell, and cannot be determined from the origin of the antigen alone.", "solution": "Step 1: Classify the antigen sources.\n- Antigen X is a soluble protein toxin secreted by an extracellular bacterium. This is an exogenous antigen, acquired from outside the cell by endocytosis or phagocytosis.\n- Antigen Y is synthesized within the cytoplasm of the dendritic cell by an intracellular protozoan parasite. This is an endogenous antigen, produced within the host cell cytosol.\n\nStep 2: Recall the canonical MHC presentation pathways.\n- Exogenous antigens are processed in endosomal/lysosomal compartments and presented on MHC class II molecules. Key features include loading of peptides onto MHC class II in acidified endosomes after removal of the invariant chain/CLIP with the assistance of HLA-DM, leading to presentation to CD4 T cells.\n- Endogenous antigens are processed by the proteasome in the cytosol, peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP, and loaded onto MHC class I molecules for presentation to CD8 T cells.\n\nStep 3: Apply the pathways to the specific antigens.\n- Antigen X (exogenous soluble toxin) will be predominantly processed via the endosomal pathway and presented on MHC class II.\n- Antigen Y (endogenous, synthesized in the cytosol by an intracellular parasite) will be predominantly processed by the proteasome and presented on MHC class I.\n\nStep 4: Address potential exceptions.\n- While dendritic cells can perform cross-presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC class I, the problem asks for the canonical, predominant pathways. Therefore, the standard mapping applies: exogenous to MHC class II and endogenous to MHC class I.\n\nStep 5: Match to the provided options.\n- This corresponds to Antigen X on MHC class II and Antigen Y on MHC class I, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2224747"}, {"introduction": "Capturing and processing antigen is only the first step; a dendritic cell must then travel from the site of infection to a nearby lymph node to meet and activate naive T cells. This journey is a precisely guided migration directed by chemical signals known as chemokines. This scenario [@problem_id:2224735] explores the critical importance of this migration by examining the immunological consequences of a defect in the cell's navigation system, highlighting how cellular geography is essential for a successful immune response.", "problem": "The initiation of a primary adaptive immune response against a new pathogen relies on a coordinated series of events involving dendritic cells (DCs), which are professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). In their immature state, DCs reside in peripheral tissues, such as the skin. Upon encountering a pathogen, they capture its antigens, undergo a maturation process, and then migrate to a draining lymph node. In the lymph node, they present the processed antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to naive T cells, thereby activating them.\n\nA key step in this process is the migration of the mature DC from the periphery to the lymph node. This journey is directed by chemical signals called chemokines. Specifically, upon maturation, DCs significantly upregulate their expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7. This receptor binds to the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, which are produced in high concentrations within the T cell zones of lymph nodes, creating a chemical gradient that guides the migrating DC.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder that results in the complete absence of functional CCR7 protein expression specifically on their dendritic cells. All other cellular functions and cell types, including T cells, are normal. What is the most direct and significant impairment in this patient's ability to mount a primary T cell response to a bacterial infection in their skin?\n\nA. The patient's dendritic cells will be unable to phagocytose bacteria at the site of infection.\n\nB. The patient's dendritic cells will be unable to process bacterial proteins into peptides for loading onto MHC molecules.\n\nC. The patient's mature dendritic cells will be unable to migrate from the skin to the draining lymph nodes.\n\nD. The patient's dendritic cells will fail to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules (like CD80/CD86) upon maturation, leading to T cell anergy.\n\nE. The patient's naive T cells will be unable to enter the lymph nodes from the bloodstream.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the primary consequence of a lack of the chemokine receptor CCR7 on dendritic cells for initiating a T cell response. Let's analyze the sequence of events in a normal immune response and how the specified defect would interfere.\n\n1.  **Antigen Capture and Processing:** Immature dendritic cells (DCs) in peripheral tissues are specialized for antigen uptake (e.g., phagocytosis). Upon capturing an antigen, like a bacterium, they begin a maturation process. This process includes breaking down the pathogen's proteins into small peptides and loading them onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. These functions are intrinsic to the DC and are triggered by pathogen recognition receptors (like Toll-like receptors), not by CCR7. Therefore, a lack of CCR7 would not affect phagocytosis (Option A) or antigen processing and loading (Option B).\n\n2.  **DC Maturation and Co-stimulation:** As the DC matures, it upregulates cell-surface proteins crucial for T cell activation. These include the MHC-peptide complexes and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 (also known as B7-1 and B7-2). The expression of these co-stimulatory molecules is a hallmark of a mature, activated DC and is necessary to provide \"Signal 2\" to the T cell, preventing its anergy or inactivation. This upregulation is also part of the maturation program triggered by pathogen signals and is independent of CCR7 function. A DC lacking CCR7 would still mature and express co-stimulatory molecules upon encountering a pathogen. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Migration to the Lymph Node:** A critical part of the DC maturation program is the upregulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7. The function of CCR7 is to detect the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, which are abundantly produced in the T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs like lymph nodes. This chemokine gradient acts as a homing signal, guiding the mature, antigen-loaded DC from the peripheral tissue (skin) through the lymphatic vessels to the draining lymph node. If a DC lacks functional CCR7, it will not be able to sense this guidance signal. Consequently, it will be \"stuck\" in the periphery and will fail to migrate to the lymph node where naive T cells are located. This directly breaks the chain of events required to start a primary T cell response. This matches Option C.\n\n4.  **T Cell Homing:** The question specifies that the genetic defect affects only the dendritic cells. Naive T cells also use CCR7 to migrate from the bloodstream into the lymph node through high endothelial venules. However, since the patient's T cells are normal, their entry into the lymph node is unaffected. The problem is not T cell entry, but the absence of the antigen-presenting DC within the lymph node for the T cells to interact with. Therefore, Option E is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The direct and most significant consequence of the lack of CCR7 on dendritic cells is their failure to migrate to the lymph node. Without this migration, the DCs cannot present the captured antigen to the naive T cells, and thus the primary T cell response cannot be initiated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2224735"}, {"introduction": "The interaction between a dendritic cell and a T cell is a decisive moment that requires more than just antigen recognition; it involves a crucial safety check to prevent accidental or inappropriate immune activation. This problem [@problem_id:2224758] delves into the famous \"two-signal hypothesis\" of T cell activation. It tests your understanding of what happens when a T cell receives the antigen-specific signal (Signal 1) without the essential co-stimulatory \"go-ahead\" signal (Signal 2) from the DC, a concept that is key to both immunity and self-tolerance.", "problem": "An immunology researcher is investigating the requirements for the activation of naive CD4+ T cells. They prepare an *in vitro* co-culture system containing two cell populations:\n1. A purified population of naive CD4+ T cells isolated from a mouse. These T cells possess a T Cell Receptor (TCR) that is specific for an antigenic peptide \"PepX\".\n2. A population of mature Dendritic Cells (DCs), which are a type of professional Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). The researcher has pre-loaded these DCs with PepX, causing them to present the peptide on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. Mature DCs normally express high levels of co-stimulatory ligands.\n\nIn the experimental condition, the researcher adds a high concentration of a specific monoclonal antibody to the culture. This antibody binds to the CD28 receptor on the surface of the T cells, effectively preventing CD28 from interacting with its natural ligands (B7 molecules) on the DCs.\n\nAfter several days of incubation, what is the most probable fate of the naive CD4+ T cells that recognize the PepX-MHC complex on the DCs in this specific experimental condition?\n\nA. They will undergo robust clonal expansion and differentiate into effector T helper cells that secrete cytokines.\n\nB. They will enter a state of clonal anergy, rendering them unresponsive to future stimulation by the same antigen.\n\nC. They will be unaffected and remain in their quiescent, naive state as if they never encountered the DCs.\n\nD. They will immediately undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) upon receiving the signal from the TCR.\n\nE. They will differentiate into memory T cells, preparing them for a more rapid response in the future.", "solution": "The activation of naive CD4+ T cells follows the two-signal model. Define $S_{1}$ as TCR engagement with peptide–MHC class II and $S_{2}$ as co-stimulation via CD28 binding to B7 (CD80/CD86) on the APC. The rule for activation is that clonal expansion and effector differentiation occur only if both $S_{1}=1$ and $S_{2}=1$. In contrast, if $S_{1}=1$ but $S_{2}=0$, naive T cells enter clonal anergy, a state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness.\n\nIn this experiment: (i) the dendritic cells present PepX on MHC class II, so PepX-specific T cells receive $S_{1}=1$ via TCR–PepX–MHC class II interaction; (ii) although mature dendritic cells express B7, the added monoclonal antibody blocks CD28 on T cells, making the effective co-stimulatory signal $S_{2}=0$. Therefore, the condition is $S_{1}=1$ and $S_{2}=0$, which by the two-signal rule leads to anergy rather than activation.\n\nMechanistically, $S_{1}$ alone induces a transcriptional program dominated by NFAT without adequate AP-1 and NF-\\kappa B support, promoting expression of anergy-associated genes (for example, E3 ubiquitin ligases) and failure to produce interleukin-2, resulting in no proliferation or effector differentiation. Over several days, this stabilizes into clonal anergy, making the T cells unresponsive to future encounters with the same antigen even if co-stimulation is later provided.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- Robust clonal expansion and effector differentiation (option A) requires $S_{2}=1$, which is prevented here.\n- Remaining quiescent (option C) would require $S_{1}=0$, but $S_{1}=1$ occurs due to TCR recognition of PepX–MHC class II.\n- Immediate apoptosis (option D) is not the canonical fate of naive T cells receiving $S_{1}$ without $S_{2}$; the predominant outcome is anergy, with deletion being context-dependent and not immediate.\n- Differentiation into memory T cells (option E) requires prior activation and expansion, which are absent.\n\nTherefore, the most probable fate is clonal anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2224758"}]}
