Its assembly requires $Mg^{2+}$ because factor B must bind to $C3b$ in a $Mg^{2+}$-dependent manner, after which factor D cleaves factor B to generate the convertase. This pathway does not require $Ca^{2+}$ for C3 convertase formation. In contrast, $Ca^{2+}$ is required for the classical and lectin pathways (e.g., stabilization of the C1 complex and MASP complexes), but these are not engaged here since the bacteria activate only the alternative pathway.\n\nEvaluate each buffer:\n- Buffer 1 contains both $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$. Since $Mg^{2+}$ is present, the alternative pathway can form $C3bBb$ and proceed.\n- Buffer 2 contains EGTA, which selectively chelates $Ca^{2+}$ while leaving $Mg^{2+}$ available. Because $Mg^{2+}$ remains, the alternative pathway can still form $C3bBb$ and proceed.\n- Buffer 3 contains EDTA, which chelates both $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$. Removal of $Mg^{2+}$ prevents factor B binding to $C3b$, so $C3bBb$ cannot form and the alternative pathway cannot proceed.\n\nTherefore, complement activation via the alternative pathway will proceed in Buffers 1 and 2 only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Real-world scientific investigation rarely relies on a single piece of evidence. This problem challenges you to act like an immunologist piecing together clues from a laboratory experiment. By synthesizing information about both calcium dependence and the role of a key enzyme, Factor D, you will use a process of logical elimination to identify the primary complement pathway at play [@problem_id:2258452].", "id": "2258452", "problem": "In an immunology research laboratory, a team is studying the susceptibility of a newly engineered line of tumor cells to the human complement system. The experiment involves incubating these tumor cells in a sample of normal human serum, which contains all the necessary components for complement activation. This incubation results in significant complement-mediated lysis of the tumor cells.\n\nTo identify the specific activation pathway responsible, two parallel experiments are conducted with specific inhibitors:\n\n1.  When the experiment is repeated in the presence of Ethylene Glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a chemical that selectively chelates free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) but not magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$), tumor cell lysis is completely inhibited.\n2.  When the experiment is repeated in the presence of a potent and specific inhibitor of Complement Factor D, a key serine protease, the rate and extent of tumor cell lysis are observed to be identical to the control experiment without any inhibitor.\n\nBased on these two observations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the primary complement pathway activating against these tumor cells?\n\nA. The Classical Pathway is solely responsible for the lysis.\nB. The Lectin Pathway is solely responsible for the lysis.\nC. The Alternative Pathway is solely responsible for the lysis.\nD. The responsible pathway is one that is dependent on calcium ions but independent of Factor D.\nE. The Terminal Pathway is responsible, as it directly forms the lytic pore.\n\n", "solution": "We begin by recalling the cation requirements and key enzyme dependencies of the three initiation pathways of complement:\n- Classical pathway: Activation by C1q binding to surface-bound antibody requires the intact C1 complex (C1q, C1r, C1s), whose subunit associations are $Ca^{2+}$-dependent. It does not require Factor D.\n- Lectin pathway: Activation by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins requires MASP proteases in an MBL/MASP complex that is also $Ca^{2+}$-dependent. It does not require Factor D.\n- Alternative pathway: Activation and amplification require $Mg^{2+}$ and are independent of $Ca^{2+}$; critically, formation of the C3 convertase C3bBb absolutely requires Factor D to cleave Factor B when it is bound to C3b.\n\nEGTA is a chelator that selectively binds free $Ca^{2+}$ over $Mg^{2+}$. In buffers where $Mg^{2+}$ is present, EGTA effectively abolishes $Ca^{2+}$-dependent reactions (classical and lectin) while leaving $Mg^{2+}$-dependent reactions (alternative) intact.\n\nInterpretation of the experimental observations:\n1) In the presence of EGTA, tumor cell lysis is completely inhibited. Since EGTA removes $Ca^{2+}$ but not $Mg^{2+}$, this finding indicates that the responsible pathway requires $Ca^{2+}$ and is not the alternative pathway, which could proceed with $Mg^{2+}$ alone.\n2) Inhibition of Factor D has no effect on the rate or extent of lysis compared to control. Since Factor D is essential for the alternative pathway, this observation independently rules out the alternative pathway as the primary mechanism.\n\nCombining (1) and (2): The pathway mediating lysis is $Ca^{2+}$-dependent and Factor D–independent. Both the classical and lectin pathways meet these criteria, and the data do not distinguish between them. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion constrained by the provided inhibitor data is that the responsible pathway is $Ca^{2+}$-dependent and Factor D–independent.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. Options A and B each claim exclusivity (classical only or lectin only), which cannot be inferred from the data. Option C contradicts both observations. Option E is incorrect because the terminal pathway is common to all three and would not specifically explain EGTA sensitivity or Factor D independence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$"}, {"introduction": "The complement system's immense power to destroy pathogens must be carefully regulated to prevent it from attacking our own cells. This delicate balance is often achieved through molecular competition, where regulatory proteins like Factor H compete with activating proteins like Factor B. This practice dives into the quantitative side of this process, challenging you to model how a single mutation can drastically shift this competitive balance. By applying principles of binding affinity ($K_D$), you will calculate the dramatic consequences of failed regulation, providing a clear link between molecular kinetics and the potential for autoimmune disease [@problem_id:2258410].", "id": "2258410", "problem": "The alternative pathway of the complement system is a crucial component of innate immunity, providing rapid defense against pathogens. A key step is the formation of the C3 convertase, C3bBb, on a target surface. This process begins when Factor B binds to a deposited C3b molecule. This C3bB complex is then cleaved by Factor D, forming the active convertase. On host cells, this process is tightly regulated to prevent self-damage. A primary regulator is Factor H, which competes with Factor B for binding to C3b and promotes the inactivation of C3b.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic disorder where an individual expresses a mutant form of Factor B, let's call it $B_{mut}$, instead of the wild-type form, $B_{wt}$. This gain-of-function mutation significantly increases the affinity of Factor B for C3b. To analyze the systemic effect of this mutation, we can model the competitive binding on a host cell surface where C3b has been deposited.
