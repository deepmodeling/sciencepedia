By considering a hypothetical rearrangement of the C4 protein, you will uncover the fundamental principle of why localizing the immune response to a pathogen's surface is essential for its effectiveness.", "problem": "The classical pathway of the complement system is a critical component of adaptive humoral immunity, initiated by antibody binding to a pathogen. This leads to the activation of the C1 complex, whose C1s subunit is a protease. C1s cleaves the complement protein C4 into two fragments: a smaller C4a fragment and a larger C4b fragment. In the normal pathway, C4b contains a highly reactive internal thioester-containing domain (TCD) that, upon cleavage, becomes exposed and allows C4b to covalently attach to the pathogen surface. The surface-bound C4b then serves as a platform for the assembly of the C3 convertase, an enzyme essential for amplifying the complement cascade.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a genetic mutation alters the structure of the C4 protein. In this new protein, the TCD is not located on the part of the molecule that becomes C4b, but is instead located on the part that becomes the C4a fragment upon cleavage by C1s. All other structural features remain unchanged (e.g., the site on the C4b protein fragment that binds the C2 protein is unaffected and remains on C4b).\n\nWhich of the following would be the most direct and critical consequence of this mutation for the classical complement pathway?\n\nA. The C5 convertase would form on the pathogen surface, but it would be catalytically inactive, preventing cleavage of C5.\n\nB. Formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase on the pathogen surface would be prevented because the C4b fragment, which is required for C2 binding, would not be attached to the surface.\n\nC. A functional but soluble C3 convertase would form in the fluid phase, leading to widespread, non-localized C3 cleavage throughout the bloodstream.\n\nD. The Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) would form, but it would insert into the membranes of host cells instead of the pathogen due to mis-targeting.\n\nE. The anaphylatoxin activity of C4a would be significantly enhanced because it is concentrated on the pathogen surface.", "solution": "- Key normal steps and principles:\n  1) In the classical pathway, C1s cleaves C4 into C4a (small, soluble anaphylatoxin) and C4b (large fragment).\n  2) In the normal protein, C4b exposes a thioester-containing domain (TCD) that allows covalent attachment of C4b to the pathogen surface. This covalent attachment is essential for localizing complement activation.\n  3) Surface-bound C4b then binds C2; C1s cleaves C2 to produce C2a (the larger enzymatic fragment) which remains associated with C4b, forming the classical pathway C3 convertase C4b2a on the pathogen surface.\n  4) Localized C3 convertase cleaves C3, depositing C3b on the pathogen, enabling amplification and downstream C5 convertase and MAC formation.\n\n- The mutation’s direct structural-functional consequence:\n  1) The TCD is moved from the fragment that becomes C4b to the fragment that becomes C4a.\n  2) After cleavage by C1s, the fragment with TCD (now C4a) can potentially covalently attach to the pathogen surface, but C4a does not contain the binding site for C2 and cannot assemble a convertase.\n  3) The C4b fragment retains the C2 binding site (unchanged by assumption) but lacks the TCD; therefore, C4b cannot covalently attach to the pathogen surface and remains fluid-phase.\n  4) Since the formation of the classical C3 convertase requires C4b to be positioned at the pathogen surface to bind C2 and form C4b2a locally, the absence of surface-tethered C4b prevents assembly of the surface-localized C3 convertase.\n\n- Direct pathway-level implication:\n  1) Without surface-bound C4b, C2 cannot be recruited at the pathogen surface to form C4b2a there. Thus, formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase on the pathogen surface is prevented.\n  2) Although fluid-phase interactions between soluble C4b and C2 might theoretically yield a soluble convertase, such complexes would be unstable and tightly regulated by complement regulators, and this is not the most direct and critical outcome relative to the core requirement of surface localization for effective complement activation.\n  3) Downstream steps (C5 convertase formation and MAC insertion) depend on prior local C3 activation and C3b deposition; thus they fail secondary to the block in surface C3 convertase formation, not because a formed C5 convertase is catalytically inactive or mis-targeted.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  A) Incorrect. The primary defect occurs earlier: the C3 convertase cannot form on the surface, so a surface C5 convertase would not form at all.\n  B) Correct. The essential surface localization via C4b covalent attachment is lost, preventing assembly of the classical C3 convertase on the pathogen surface.\n  C) Less direct and not the critical outcome. While some fluid-phase activity could occur, the most direct and critical consequence is the failure to assemble the surface C3 convertase.\n  D) Incorrect. There is no specific mechanism here to redirect MAC to host membranes; instead, the pathway stalls upstream due to lack of surface C3 convertase.\n  E) Incorrect. C4a’s anaphylatoxin activity is mediated as a soluble factor; tethering it to surfaces would not enhance and would likely diminish its diffusion-based receptor engagement.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and critical consequence is prevention of surface C3 convertase formation because C4b cannot attach to the pathogen surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2274767"}, {"introduction": "The sequential nature of the classical complement pathway provides a logical framework for diagnosing deficiencies.

This assay measures the ability of serum to lyse antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (red blood cells). A complete and functional classical pathway, from C1 through C9, is required to form the terminal Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) and cause cell lysis.\n\nThe initial assay using only the patient's serum results in a complete absence of erythrocyte lysis, indicating a functional defect somewhere in the classical pathway. To identify the specific deficient component, the laboratory performs a series of mixing studies. In each separate study, the patient's serum is incubated with the antibody-sensitized erythrocytes along with one specific, purified, and functional complement component.

C1\n\nB. C2\n\nC. C3\n\nD. C4", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify a deficient complement component based on the results of a CH50 assay and subsequent mixing studies. To solve this, we must understand the sequence of events in the classical complement pathway and how the mixing studies work to pinpoint a deficiency.\n\nFirst, let's review the activation sequence of the early classical complement pathway, which leads to cell lysis:\n1.  The pathway is initiated when the C1 complex (composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s) binds to antibodies that are attached to an antigen on a target surface (in this case, the sheep erythrocytes).\n2.  Binding activates the C1 complex, which becomes an enzyme.\n3.  Activated C1 cleaves C4 into two fragments, C4a and C4b. C4b covalently attaches to the target surface.\n4.  Activated C1 also cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b. The larger fragment (C2a) binds to the surface-bound C4b.\n5.  The combination of C4b and C2a forms the C4b2a complex, which is the classical pathway C3 convertase. This is a critical enzymatic step.\n6.  The C3 convertase cleaves large amounts of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b molecules coat the cell surface.\n7.  Subsequent steps involving C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 lead to the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which punches a hole in the cell membrane, causing lysis.\n\nThe principle of a mixing study is that if you add the *specific* component that is missing or non-functional in the patient's serum, you will restore the entire pathway's function, and lysis will occur. If adding a component does not cause lysis, it implies that the deficiency lies elsewhere, specifically downstream of the added component.\n\nNow, let's analyze the experimental results step-by-step:\n- **Initial Result (Patient serum alone):** No lysis. This confirms there is a break in the C1-C9 sequence.\n\n- **Study 1 (Addition of purified C1):** No lysis. If the patient were deficient in C1, adding functional C1 would have restored the pathway and caused lysis (assuming C2, C3, C4, etc., are present). Since lysis did not occur, we can conclude that the patient is not deficient in C1, and the defect must be \"downstream\" of C1 (i.e., in C4, C2, C3, or later components).\n\n- **Study 2 (Addition of purified C4):** No lysis. Similar to the C1 study, if the patient were C4 deficient, adding functional C4 would have repaired the pathway. The lack of lysis indicates the patient has functional C4, and the defect is downstream of C4's action.\n\n- **Study 3 (Addition of purified C2):** Normal lysis observed. This is the crucial result. The addition of functional C2 protein successfully restored the entire lytic pathway. This could only happen if all components *before* C2 (C1, C4) and all components *after* C2 (C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) were present and functional in the patient's serum. The only missing piece was C2. Adding it allowed the formation of the C3 convertase (C4b2a), enabling the rest of the cascade to proceed to completion.\n\n- **Study 4 (Addition of purified C3):** No lysis. This result confirms that C3 is not the deficient component. If C3 were deficient, adding it would have restored lysis. The reason no lysis occurs here is that the step *required to activate C3* is blocked. Specifically, the C3 convertase (C4b2a) cannot be formed because of the lack of endogenous C2. Therefore, even with an abundance of added C3, it cannot be cleaved to C3b to continue the pathway.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, the restoration of lysis exclusively upon the addition of purified C2 indicates that the patient is deficient in complement component C2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2274746"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of the complement system is its massive amplification potential, where a single initial event triggers an exponentially growing response.
