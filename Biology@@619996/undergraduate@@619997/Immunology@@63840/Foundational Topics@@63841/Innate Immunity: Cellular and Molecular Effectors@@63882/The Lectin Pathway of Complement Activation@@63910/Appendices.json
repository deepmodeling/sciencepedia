To truly grasp its mechanics, it is essential to understand the specific role of each molecular player. This problem presents a clinical scenario involving a deficiency in MBL-Associated Serine Protease 2 (MASP-2), a critical enzyme that acts early in the pathway. By analyzing the consequences of this specific defect, you can solidify your understanding of the initial proteolytic events that are required to get the cascade started [@problem_id:2278065].", "problem": "A two-year-old child presents with a history of recurrent, severe infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Laboratory analysis of the child's immune system reveals normal levels and binding activity of Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL). However, genetic sequencing confirms a null mutation in the gene encoding MBL-Associated Serine Protease 2 (MASP-2), rendering the enzyme completely non-functional. The classical and alternative complement pathways are presumed to be initially functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence of this specific defect on the complement cascade?\n\nA. The classical pathway C3 convertase, $C4b2a$, will be produced at an accelerated rate to compensate for the lectin pathway deficiency.\n\nB. The formation of the C3 convertase via the lectin pathway is inhibited because $C4$ and $C2$ cannot be proteolytically cleaved.\n\nC. MBL will be unable to undergo the conformational change required for the activation of other associated proteases.\n\nD. The alternative pathway will be completely blocked, as it requires $C3b$ produced by the lectin pathway for its amplification loop.\n\nE. Both $C4$ and $C2$ will be cleaved, but their fragments $C4b$ and $C2a$ will be unable to assemble into a functional enzyme complex on the pathogen surface.", "solution": "The complement system activates through three pathways—classical, lectin, and alternative—that converge on the generation of the C3 convertase. In both the classical and lectin pathways, the C3 convertase formed is $C4b2a$, which cleaves $C3$ to $C3a$ and $C3b$.\n\nIn the lectin pathway, Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) binds to mannose residues on microbial surfaces and associates with MBL-Associated Serine Proteases, primarily MASP-1 and MASP-2. The critical biochemical steps are:\n- MASP-2 cleaves $C4$ to $C4a$ and $C4b$.\n- MASP-2 also cleaves $C2$ to $C2a$ and $C2b$.\n- $C4b$ covalently binds to the pathogen surface and then associates with $C2a$ to form the C3 convertase $C4b2a$.\n\nGiven a null mutation in MASP-2 with normal MBL levels and binding, MBL can still recognize pathogens, but the downstream proteolysis required to generate $C4b$ and $C2a$ cannot occur via the lectin pathway. Therefore, the lectin pathway cannot form its C3 convertase $C4b2a$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the classical pathway does not accelerate to compensate; its activation depends on $C1q$ binding to immune complexes and subsequent $C1r/C1s$ activity, independent of MASP-2.\n- Option B is correct: without MASP-2, $C4$ and $C2$ cannot be cleaved in the lectin pathway, so $C4b2a$ cannot form via this pathway.\n- Option C is incorrect because MBL’s conformational change upon ligand binding is intact; the defect lies in the absent serine protease activity of MASP-2, not in MBL structural activation.\n- Option D is incorrect because the alternative pathway can initiate via spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ (tickover) to $C3(H_{2}O)$ and does not require lectin-derived $C3b$ to exist, although $C3b$ from any pathway can amplify it.\n- Option E is incorrect because in MASP-2 deficiency the primary defect is failure to cleave $C4$ and $C2$ via the lectin pathway; thus, there are not sufficient $C4b$ and $C2a$ fragments to assemble $C4b2a$.\n\nThus, the direct consequence is inhibition of C3 convertase formation via the lectin pathway due to failure to cleave $C4$ and $C2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278065"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just knowing the sequence of activation, a deeper understanding of the complement pathway involves appreciating the specific molecular interactions that drive it forward. This exercise introduces a hypothetical drug, \"Converstatin,\" which acts as a competitive inhibitor. This thought experiment allows us to isolate and examine the crucial assembly step of the C3 convertase, where the protein C2 must bind to C4b. Working through this scenario will clarify how disrupting a single protein-protein interaction can halt the entire cascade, highlighting a potential target for immunomodulatory therapies [@problem_id:2278071].", "problem": "In a research laboratory, a new immunomodulatory drug is being tested. The drug, named \"Converstatin,\" is a small molecule designed to act as a competitive inhibitor. Its specific mechanism of action is to bind to the docking site on the $C4b$ complement component, thereby preventing the binding of the $C2$ complement component. This drug is introduced into an in vitro system containing all necessary components for the activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system upon introduction of a mannose-rich bacterium.\n\nAssuming the drug is present in a sufficient concentration to be effective, which of the following options describes the most immediate and direct consequence of Converstatin on the lectin pathway cascade?\n\nA. The cleavage of the $C5$ complement component will be enhanced, leading to increased inflammation.\n\nB. The Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) will be unable to recognize and bind to mannans on the bacterial surface.\n\nC. The enzymatic complex known as the C3 convertase will fail to form.\n\nD. The MBL-Associated Serine Proteases (MASPs) will be unable to cleave the $C4$ complement component.\n\nE. The formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) will be completely unaffected.", "solution": "The lectin pathway is initiated when mannose-binding lectin (MBL) recognizes and binds to mannose residues on a microbial surface. Upon binding, MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) become activated and cleave $C4$ into $C4a$ and $C4b$. $C4b$ covalently attaches to the microbial surface and serves as a platform to bind $C2$. MASPs then cleave the bound $C2$ to form the $C4b2a$ complex, which is the C3 convertase of the lectin (and classical) pathway. This C3 convertase cleaves $C3$, leading to downstream generation of C5 convertase and ultimately the membrane attack complex (MAC).\n\nConverstatin is described as a competitive inhibitor that binds to the docking site on $C4b$, preventing $C2$ from binding. This action specifically disrupts the step where $C2$ associates with $C4b$ to form $C4b2a$. Therefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is failure to form the C3 convertase ($C4b2a$). Upstream events (MBL recognition and MASP-mediated cleavage of $C4$) still occur because they do not require $C2$ binding to $C4b$. Downstream events ($C5$ cleavage and MAC formation) will be reduced because they depend on prior C3 convertase activity, but these are not the most immediate effect.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because $C5$ cleavage would be decreased, not enhanced, due to impaired C3 convertase formation.\n- B is incorrect because MBL binding to mannans is unaffected; the drug acts at the $C4b$-$C2$ interaction.\n- C is correct because blocking $C2$ docking on $C4b$ prevents formation of the C3 convertase.\n- D is incorrect because MASPs can still cleave $C4$; the blockade occurs after $C4b$ is generated.\n- E is incorrect because MAC formation depends on upstream steps that are impaired; it will not be unaffected.\n\nThus, the most immediate and direct consequence is failure of C3 convertase formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2278071"}, {"introduction": "A key skill for any immunologist is the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, experimental design.

The assay utilizes a microtiter plate whose wells are coated with mannan, a polymer of the sugar mannose, which mimics the surface carbohydrates of certain pathogens. A patient's serum sample is diluted in a special buffer that is designed to prevent activation of the classical and alternative complement pathways, ensuring that any observed activity is due solely to the lectin pathway. The diluted serum is added to the mannan-coated wells and incubated for a period sufficient for complement activation to occur. Afterwards, the wells are washed to remove any unbound serum proteins.\n\nThe objective is to confirm that the *entire* lectin pathway, from the initial recognition step to the formation of the final lytic complex, is functional.
