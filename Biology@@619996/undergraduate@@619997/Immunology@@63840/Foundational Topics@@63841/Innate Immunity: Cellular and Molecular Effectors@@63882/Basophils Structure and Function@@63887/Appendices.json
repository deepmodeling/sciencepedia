Flow cytometry is a powerful technique that uses fluorescently-labeled antibodies to identify cells based on their unique surface proteins, or immunophenotype. This exercise challenges you to think like an experimentalist by selecting the most specific molecular marker to distinguish basophils from other granulocytes, a critical first step for any functional study [@problem_id:2218904].", "id": "2218904", "problem": "An immunologist is designing an experiment to quantify basophils within a sample of human peripheral blood using Flow Cytometry (FCM). The blood sample has been processed to enrich for granulocytes, so it primarily contains neutrophils and a smaller population of basophils. The goal is to use a single fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibody that will specifically bind to the surface of basophils, allowing them to be distinguished from the much more numerous neutrophils.\n\nWhich of the following antibodies, targeting a single surface protein, would be the most effective choice for positively identifying basophils while excluding neutrophils in this FCM experiment?\n\nA.

An antibody against CD66b\n\n", "solution": "We want a single monoclonal antibody that binds a surface protein highly and specifically expressed on basophils but not on neutrophils, enabling positive identification of basophils by flow cytometry within a granulocyte-enriched blood sample. Evaluate each option based on known immunophenotypes:\n\nCD16 (Fc\\gamma RIII) is highly expressed on neutrophils and generally absent or very low on basophils. An anti-CD16 antibody would predominantly label neutrophils and would not serve to positively identify basophils; it would instead be useful for excluding neutrophils.\n\nCD11b (Mac-1 alpha chain) is strongly expressed on neutrophils and monocytes and can be upregulated on basophils upon activation, making it non-specific and unsuitable for selectively identifying basophils over neutrophils.\n\nFc\\epsilon RI (the high-affinity IgE receptor) is constitutively and highly expressed on basophils and mast cells; neutrophils do not express Fc\\epsilon RI. In peripheral blood, mast cells are absent because they are tissue-resident; thus, in a granulocyte-enriched blood sample, anti-Fc\\epsilon RI would selectively and positively identify basophils while excluding neutrophils.\n\nCD3 is a T-cell marker and is not expressed on granulocytes, thus neither basophils nor neutrophils would be labeled; it is irrelevant for distinguishing these granulocyte subsets.\n\nCD66b is a granulocyte glycoprotein highly expressed on neutrophils and is commonly used as a neutrophil marker; basophils are negative. This would mark neutrophils rather than basophils.\n\nTherefore, the most effective single-antibody choice for positively identifying basophils while excluding neutrophils in this context is anti-Fc\\epsilon RI.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Once a basophil is identified, the next step is to understand how it responds to stimuli. Activation is not a simple on/off switch but a tightly regulated cascade of molecular events known as a signaling pathway. This problem presents a hypothetical clinical scenario involving a genetic mutation to test your understanding of the canonical FcεRI pathway, asking you to predict the functional consequences of disrupting a single, critical enzyme, Phospholipase C-gamma ($PLC\\gamma$) [@problem_id:2218932].", "id": "2218932", "problem": "Basophils are granulocytes that play a central role in allergic inflammatory responses. Their activation is initiated when an allergen cross-links Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies bound to their high-affinity receptors, Fc-epsilon Receptor I (FcεRI), on the cell surface. This event triggers a complex intracellular signaling cascade. A critical enzyme in this pathway is Phospholipase C-gamma ($PLC\\gamma$). Following its activation by upstream tyrosine kinases, $PLC\\gamma$ hydrolyzes the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) into two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The release of calcium from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, is a pivotal event that is necessary for basophil degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder resulting in a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding for $PLC\\gamma$. These afunctional $PLC\\gamma$ proteins are expressed but cannot perform their catalytic activity. If basophils isolated from this patient are exposed in vitro to an allergen to which the patient is sensitized, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and immediate consequence of this specific mutation?\n\nA. Markedly enhanced degranulation and histamine release due to the activation of compensatory signaling pathways.\nB. A failure to mobilize calcium from intracellular stores, leading to a profound inhibition of degranulation.\nC. Normal mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, but a failure of degranulation due to a defect in the granule fusion machinery.\nD. A significant increase in the phosphorylation of upstream signaling molecules like the tyrosine kinase Syk, but a normal degranulation response.\nE. Rapid induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the basophils immediately upon allergen stimulation.\n\n", "solution": "Allergen cross-linking of $IgE$ bound to $Fc\\epsilon RI$ initiates a tyrosine kinase cascade (e.g., Lyn and Syk) that leads to phosphorylation of adaptor proteins (e.g., LAT, SLP$-$76), recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of $PLC\\gamma$, and its catalytic activation. The essential catalytic reaction catalyzed by $PLC\\gamma$ is:\n$$\nPIP_{2} \\xrightarrow{PLC\\gamma} IP_{3} + DAG.\n$$\n$IP_{3}$ binds $IP_{3}$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing release of $Ca^{2+}$ from intracellular stores. The resulting cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ rise, together with DAG-mediated activation of $PKC$, is necessary and sufficient to drive basophil degranulation. Store depletion also triggers store-operated $Ca^{2+}$ entry via STIM1$/$Orai1, sustaining the $Ca^{2+}$ signal needed for exocytosis.\n\nIn a complete loss-of-function mutation of $PLC\\gamma$ where the protein is present but catalytically inactive, the hydrolysis of $PIP_{2}$ cannot occur. Therefore:\n- $IP_{3}$ is not produced, so $IP_{3}$ receptors are not engaged and $Ca^{2+}$ cannot be mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- DAG is not produced, so $PKC$ activation is impaired.\n- Without $ER$ $Ca^{2+}$ release, there is no store depletion, so store-operated $Ca^{2+}$ entry is not initiated, further preventing cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ elevation.\n\nThe most direct and immediate consequence of specifically losing $PLC\\gamma$ catalytic activity is a failure to mobilize $Ca^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, resulting in profound inhibition of degranulation. Upstream events such as Syk phosphorylation may still occur, but they cannot compensate for the absence of $IP_{3}$ and DAG production. There is no mechanistic basis for immediate apoptosis upon stimulation, and enhanced degranulation via compensatory pathways is not expected in the acute setting. A defect in the granule fusion machinery is not implicated by the mutation described.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the option describing failure of intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ mobilization with consequent inhibition of degranulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Basophils can be activated by multiple distinct triggers, often utilizing different intracellular machinery. A key task for immunologists is to dissect these pathways to understand their specific contributions and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. This practice places you in the role of a researcher analyzing raw experimental data to quantitatively compare the dependence of two different activation pathways—one triggered by allergen and another by the complement component C5a—on the crucial signaling enzyme Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) [@problem_id:2218931].", "id": "2218931", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating the intracellular signaling pathways activated in human basophils, which are key effector cells in allergic responses. Two distinct stimuli are known to cause basophil degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine: (1) the cross-linking of surface-bound Immunoglobulin E (IgE) by a specific antigen, and (2) the binding of the complement anaphylatoxin C5a to its receptor. The study aims to quantitatively compare the reliance of these two activation pathways on the enzyme Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk).\n\nTo achieve this, purified human basophils are cultured and subjected to different experimental conditions. The resulting degranulation is assessed by measuring the concentration of histamine released into the cell culture supernatant.\n\nFirst, the basal histamine release from unstimulated basophils is measured and found to be 10.0 ng/mL.\n\nNext, a sample of basophils is stimulated with an IgE-crosslinking antigen, which results in a histamine concentration of 115.0 ng/mL. When the experiment is repeated in the presence of a highly specific Syk inhibitor, the same antigen stimulation yields a histamine concentration of 22.4 ng/mL.\n\nFinally, another sample of basophils is stimulated with a saturating concentration of C5a, leading to a histamine concentration of 85.0 ng/mL. When this is repeated in the presence of the same Syk inhibitor, the histamine concentration is measured to be 81.2 ng/mL.\n\nTo compare the two pathways, you must calculate a \"relative Syk dependency ratio\". This ratio is computed by dividing the fractional inhibition of the C5a-mediated response by the fractional inhibition of the IgE-mediated response. For each pathway, the \"fractional inhibition\" is defined as the reduction in stimulus-induced histamine release due to the inhibitor, divided by the total stimulus-induced histamine release observed in the absence of the inhibitor. Note that \"stimulus-induced histamine release\" refers to the increase in histamine concentration above the basal level.\n\nCalculate the value of this relative Syk dependency ratio.
