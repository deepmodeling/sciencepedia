{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Phagocytosis is not always a brute-force process; it is often guided and enhanced by specific \"eat me\" signals. This first practice explores the concept of opsonization, where molecules like antibodies coat a pathogen to make it more 'palatable' to phagocytes. By examining the specific roles of different antibody regions, you will uncover the molecular basis for the dramatic increase in phagocytic efficiency that occurs when pathogens are tagged for destruction [@problem_id:2278975].", "problem": "An immunology laboratory is investigating the mechanisms of phagocytosis using cultured macrophages and a specific strain of bacterium, *Bacterium exempli*. They quantify the efficiency of this process using a \"Phagocytic Index,\" defined as the average number of bacteria ingested per macrophage over a 30-minute incubation period.\n\nIn their first experiment (Control), they mix the macrophages with *B. exempli* and observe a Phagocytic Index of 5. This represents the basal level of phagocytosis.\n\nIn their second experiment (Opsonized), they first coat the *B. exempli* with a specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody that binds to the bacterial surface. When these opsonized bacteria are mixed with the macrophages, the Phagocytic Index is observed to be 100.\n\nFor a third experiment (Modified Opsonin), the researchers plan to use a proteolytic enzyme that specifically cleaves the IgG antibody, completely removing its Fragment, crystallizable (Fc) portion while leaving the two Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab) regions connected and functional. This modified antibody fragment will then be used to coat the bacteria before incubation with the macrophages.\n\nAssuming the enzyme treatment has no other effects, what is the most likely Phagocytic Index that will be observed in this third experiment?\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 50\n\nD. 95\n\nE. 100", "solution": "Let $PI$ denote the Phagocytic Index. The control experiment gives the basal value\n$$PI_{\\text{control}}=5.$$\nOpsonization with intact Immunoglobulin G (IgG) raises the index to\n$$PI_{\\text{IgG}}=100,$$\nbecause macrophage Fc receptors (Fc$\\gamma$ receptors) bind the Fc region of IgG attached to bacteria, which enhances phagocytosis.\n\nIn the third experiment, the IgG is proteolytically cleaved to remove the Fc portion while keeping the two Fab regions connected and functional, yielding an $F(ab')_{2}$-type fragment. This fragment can still bind antigen on the bacterial surface via Fab, but it lacks the Fc region required for engagement of Fc$\\gamma$ receptors on macrophages. Therefore, Fc receptor-mediated opsonization is abolished. Under the stated assumption that there are no other effects, there is no enhancement of phagocytosis beyond the basal level. Hence the expected index returns to baseline:\n$$PI_{\\text{modified}}=PI_{\\text{control}}=5.$$\nAmong the provided options, this corresponds to choice B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278975"}, {"introduction": "Once a phagocyte recognizes its target, it must physically surround and engulf it in a beautiful and complex mechanical process. This exercise focuses on the critical role of the cell's internal scaffolding, the actin cytoskeleton, in driving the extension of pseudopods that form the phagosome. By analyzing the effect of a hypothetical drug that disables this machinery, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how fundamental cellular structures dictate essential immune functions [@problem_id:2279010].", "problem": "A researcher is conducting an in-vitro experiment to study the cellular mechanics of the innate immune system. A sample of human neutrophils is co-cultured with bacteria that have been opsonized with antibodies. To investigate the role of the cytoskeleton, the researcher treats one group of these neutrophils with Cytochalasin D, a mycotoxin known to specifically bind to the barbed end of actin filaments and block both the polymerization and the elongation of actin. The researcher then observes the interaction between the drug-treated neutrophils and the opsonized bacteria under a microscope.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and primary consequence of the Cytochalasin D treatment on the process of phagocytosis?\n\nA. The neutrophils will be unable to extend pseudopods to engulf the bacteria, thus arresting the formation of a phagosome.\n\nB. The neutrophils will be unable to migrate towards the chemical signals released by the bacteria.\n\nC. A phagosome will successfully form around a bacterium, but it will fail to fuse with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.\n\nD. The neutrophils will successfully engulf and destroy the bacteria, but will be unable to present bacterial antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules.\n\nE. The antibodies will be unable to bind to the surface of the bacteria, preventing opsonization.", "solution": "Cytochalasin D specifically binds to the barbed (plus) ends of actin filaments and blocks actin polymerization and elongation. In Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria, engagement of Fc receptors triggers rapid actin polymerization at the cell membrane to form the phagocytic cup. This actin-driven process underlies the extension of pseudopods that wrap around the particle and culminates in closure of the membrane around the target to form a phagosome.\n\nBecause the formation and extension of pseudopods is an actin-dependent process, inhibition of actin polymerization immediately prevents the neutrophil from generating the phagocytic cup and from enclosing the bacterium, thereby arresting phagosome formation at the earliest step. This is the primary and most immediate defect in phagocytosis with Cytochalasin D.\n\nIn contrast, while chemotaxis (cell migration toward chemoattractants) is also actin dependent, the question asks specifically for the primary consequence on the process of phagocytosis observed during interaction with opsonized bacteria; failure of pseudopod extension directly blocks phagocytic cup formation. Fusion of formed phagosomes with lysosomes depends more critically on microtubule-based trafficking rather than actin polymerization, so a selective actin polymerization inhibitor would not primarily cause a phagosomeâ€“lysosome fusion defect. Neutrophils are not major MHC class II antigen-presenting cells, and opsonization is a property of antibodies binding bacterial antigens, independent of neutrophil actin dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary consequence of Cytochalasin D in this context is the inability to extend pseudopods and form a phagosome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2279010"}, {"introduction": "Engulfing a pathogen is only the beginning of the story; the real work of destruction happens deep within the cell. This final practice takes you on the intracellular journey of phagosome maturation, a tightly regulated pathway that transforms a simple vesicle into a potent digestive organelle called a phagolysosome. By investigating how a clever pathogen might strategically disrupt this process by targeting a key regulatory protein like Rab7, you will understand the intricate molecular chess game constantly being played between host and microbe [@problem_id:2278981].", "problem": "A research team is investigating the pathogenesis of a newly discovered intracellular bacterium, *Pathogenix clandestinus*. They observe that this bacterium is readily engulfed by host macrophages but is not killed, instead establishing a replicative niche within the cell. Subsequent biochemical analysis reveals that *P. clandestinus* secretes a potent virulence factor that acts as a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) inhibitor, specifically and exclusively targeting the host's Rab7 GTPase. This inhibition effectively locks Rab7 in its inactive, GDP-bound state.\n\nThe canonical process of phagosome maturation in a macrophage involves several key steps:\n1.  Engulfment of a particle into a nascent phagosome.\n2.  Sequential fusion with early and late endosomes, marked by the presence of Rab5 and then Rab7 on the phagosomal membrane, respectively.\n3.  Fusion of the mature, Rab7-positive late phagosome with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.\n4.  The phagolysosome provides a highly acidic and hydrolytic environment that degrades and kills the pathogen.\n\nGiven that the virulence factor from *P. clandestinus* completely ablates the function of the Rab7 GTPase, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and critical consequence that allows for the bacterium's intracellular survival?\n\nA. The initial engulfment of the bacterium by the macrophage is blocked, preventing the formation of a phagosome.\n\nB. The nascent phagosome fails to fuse with early endosomes, preventing the acquisition of early endosomal markers like Rab5.\n\nC. The late phagosome, though properly formed, is unable to fuse with lysosomes, thus failing to create a microbicidal phagolysosome.\n\nD. The assembly and activation of the NADPH oxidase complex on the phagosome membrane is constitutively activated, leading to cytotoxic damage to the macrophage itself.\n\nE. Lysosomes throughout the cell undergo premature acidification and are unable to fuse with any endocytic vesicle, leading to a general breakdown of cellular autophagy.", "solution": "Rab GTPases function as molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Activation requires a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP. When a bacterial virulence factor inhibits a specific Rab GEF, the corresponding Rab is locked in the inactive GDP-bound state and cannot recruit its downstream effectors.\n\nDuring phagosome maturation, the nascent phagosome first acquires Rab5 and fuses with early endosomes. A Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion then occurs, leading to acquisition of Rab7, which defines the late phagosome. Active, GTP-bound Rab7 is essential for recruiting tethering and fusion machinery, including effectors such as RILP and the HOPS complex, that mediate transport along microtubules and fusion with lysosomes. Fusion with lysosomes forms the phagolysosome, whose acidic and hydrolytic environment is required for pathogen killing.\n\nIn the scenario described, the virulence factor specifically inhibits the Rab7 GEF, thereby locking Rab7 in the GDP-bound inactive state. The direct consequence is that Rab7-dependent steps fail: the late phagosome cannot effectively recruit Rab7 effectors and thus cannot fuse with lysosomes. This prevents phagolysosome formation and the establishment of the microbicidal, acidic compartment necessary to kill the bacteria, allowing intracellular survival.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A is incorrect because initial engulfment is mediated by receptor-triggered actin remodeling and does not require Rab7.\n- B is incorrect because fusion with early endosomes and acquisition of Rab5 are upstream of Rab7 and are not directly blocked by Rab7 inhibition.\n- C is correct because Rab7 activity is required for late phagosome-lysosome fusion; its inhibition abrogates phagolysosome formation, preventing bacterial killing.\n- D is incorrect; Rab7 inhibition does not constitutively activate NADPH oxidase and does not directly cause macrophage cytotoxicity in this manner.\n- E is incorrect; while Rab7 participates in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, the described consequence (premature acidification and global fusion block) is not the direct or specific outcome of Rab7 GEF inhibition, and the critical survival mechanism here is the block of phagosome-lysosome fusion.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and critical consequence enabling intracellular survival is the failure of the Rab7-dependent fusion of late phagosomes with lysosomes, preventing phagolysosome formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2278981"}]}
