By considering a scenario where this brake is genetically absent, you will predict the cascading effects on complement component levels and patient health, reinforcing the concept that a lack of regulation can be as dangerous as the threat the system is designed to fight.", "problem": "The complement system is a crucial component of the innate immune response. Its alternative pathway provides immediate, non-specific defense against pathogens. This pathway is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of the C3 protein, which leads to the formation of a C3 convertase enzyme complex ($C3bBb$). This enzyme cleaves more C3 molecules, creating a powerful amplification loop. To prevent excessive activation and damage to host tissues, this process is tightly regulated. A key regulatory enzyme is Factor I, a plasma serine protease that permanently inactivates the C3b protein, a central component of the C3 convertase.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder resulting in a complete deficiency of functional Factor I. Based on your understanding of the alternative pathway's regulation, what are the most likely clinical and laboratory findings for this patient?\n\nA. Markedly increased plasma C3 levels and a decreased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\nB. Normal plasma C3 levels and an increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\nC. Markedly low plasma C3 levels and an increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\nD. Markedly low plasma C3 levels and a decreased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\nE. Normal plasma C3 levels and normal susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.", "solution": "1) Core mechanism: In the alternative pathway, spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 generates C3b that binds Factor B; Factor D then cleaves Factor B to form the $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$. This enzyme cleaves additional C3, creating a positive feedback amplification loop. Regulation requires permanent inactivation of C3b by Factor I (with cofactors such as Factor H, CR1, and MCP), converting C3b to inactive fragments (for example, iC3b) and thereby terminating further C3 convertase formation.\n\n2) Effect of Factor I deficiency on complement dynamics: In the absence of functional Factor I, C3b cannot be inactivated. Persisting C3b supports continuous formation of C3 convertase ($C3bBb$), which sustains and accelerates cleavage of C3. This leads to uncontrolled activation and consumption of C3. Therefore, plasma C3 levels become markedly low due to ongoing consumption.\n\n3) Consequences for host defense: C3b and its breakdown product iC3b are major opsonins. Markedly reduced effective C3b/iC3b opsonization impairs phagocytosis of pyogenic (encapsulated) bacteria. Clinically, this results in increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\n4) Synthesis of clinical and laboratory findings: The expected laboratory finding is markedly low plasma C3 levels (due to consumption), and the expected clinical finding is increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections (due to impaired opsonization). Among the options provided, this corresponds to option C.\n\n5) Exclusion of other options:\n- A is incorrect because C3 is consumed, not increased, and susceptibility is increased, not decreased.\n- B and E are incorrect because C3 is not normal; it is markedly low.\n- D is incorrect because although C3 is low, susceptibility is not decreased; it is increased.\n\nTherefore, the most likely findings are markedly low plasma C3 levels and increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2273448"}, {"introduction": "While negative regulators like Factor I prevent the complement system from causing self-harm, an effective immune response also requires positive regulators to ensure the cascade is potent enough to clear pathogens. Properdin functions as a crucial stabilizer, or \"accelerator,\" for the alternative pathway's core enzyme. This practice problem [@problem_id:2273435] examines the consequences of a properdin deficiency, challenging you to understand how its absence impairs the pathway's ability to amplify. This helps illustrate the delicate balance required for an efficient and controlled immune reaction.", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare X-linked genetic disorder characterized by the complete inability to produce functional properdin (also known as Factor P). Properdin is a plasma protein involved in the innate immune response. The patient's classical and lectin complement pathways are found to be functionally intact. Considering the known mechanisms of the complement system, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and primary biochemical consequence for the alternative pathway of complement activation in this patient?\n\nA. The C3 convertase of the alternative pathway, C3bBb, will have a severely reduced half-life, preventing effective amplification of the complement cascade.\n\nB. The initial spontaneous hydrolysis of complement component C3 to C3(H₂O), which initiates the pathway, will be completely blocked.\n\nC. The cleavage of Factor B into Ba and Bb by Factor D will be inhibited, preventing the formation of any C3 convertase.\n\nD. The formation of the C5 convertase from the C3 convertase will be directly blocked, even if the C3 convertase itself is stable.\n\nE. Uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway will occur on host cells, as properdin is the primary negative regulator of the cascade.", "solution": "The alternative pathway of complement activation proceeds via continuous low-level spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ in plasma, a process often termed “tickover.” This yields $C3(H_2O)$, which can bind Factor B ($B$). Factor D ($D$) then cleaves $B$ into Ba and Bb, generating the fluid-phase $C3$ convertase $C3(H_2O)Bb$, which cleaves $C3$ to C3a and C3b. Surface-deposited C3b binds $B$, and $D$ cleaves $B$ to form the surface-bound alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$. This $C3$ convertase then amplifies the pathway by generating more C3b, which further propagates convertase formation, and with an additional C3b can form the $C5$ convertase $C3bBbC3b$.\n\nProperdin (Factor P), denoted here as $P$, is a positive regulator of the alternative pathway. It binds to and stabilizes the $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$, markedly increasing its half-life on microbial surfaces. Properdin can also facilitate assembly of the convertase on pathogen surfaces. In the absence of $P$, the $C3bBb$ complex is intrinsically unstable and decays rapidly due to its short natural half-life and the action of regulatory proteins such as Factor H and decay-accelerating factor. Thus, without properdin, the immediate and primary biochemical consequence is a severely reduced stability (half-life) of the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$, which impairs the amplification loop.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A states that the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$ will have a severely reduced half-life, preventing effective amplification. This directly reflects the known role of properdin as a stabilizer of $C3bBb$ and is correct.\n- Option B claims that the initial spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ to $C3(H_2O)$ will be completely blocked. This hydrolysis is an intrinsic property of $C3$ and does not require properdin; therefore, this is incorrect.\n- Option C claims that cleavage of Factor B by $D$ will be inhibited. Factor D cleaves $B$ when $B$ is bound to $C3b$ or $C3(H_2O)$, and this process does not require properdin; therefore, this is incorrect.\n- Option D claims direct blockade of $C5$ convertase formation even if $C3$ convertase is stable. Properdin does not directly block $C5$ convertase formation; rather, its absence destabilizes $C3bBb$, indirectly reducing $C5$ convertase formation. The immediate and primary effect is on $C3bBb$ stability, not a direct block at $C5$ convertase.\n- Option E asserts uncontrolled activation on host cells because properdin is the primary negative regulator. Properdin is a positive regulator; negative regulators include Factor H, Factor I, DAF, and MCP. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\nHence, the most accurate statement is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2273435"}, {"introduction": "Complement regulation becomes even more sophisticated at the interface between the immune system and our own cells. Host cells display a suite of membrane-bound proteins to protect themselves from accidental attack. This final practice [@problem_id:2273446] presents a fascinating scenario that dissects the distinct functions of two such regulators: Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF) and Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP). By analyzing a cell with one regulator but not the other, you will learn how different mechanisms can selectively prevent lysis while still allowing opsonization, revealing the nuanced layers of self-protection.", "problem": "In the study of innate immunity, the complement system provides a critical first line of defense against pathogens. However, host cells must express regulatory proteins to protect themselves from accidental damage by this powerful system. The alternative pathway of complement activation is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, leading to the deposition of C3b molecules on nearby surfaces. This C3b can then form a C3 convertase ($C3bBb$), which amplifies the cascade, and a C5 convertase, which initiates the formation of the lytic Membrane Attack Complex (MAC).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving a human cell line that has been genetically engineered. This cell line expresses high levels of Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF, also known as CD55) on its membrane but has a complete knockout of the gene for Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP, also known as CD46). When this cell line is cultured in human serum (which contains all necessary complement components like C3, Factor B, Factor D, and Factor I), a specific immunological outcome is observed. The cell remains intact and does not undergo immediate lysis, but it becomes heavily targeted for phagocytosis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The high level of DAF prevents the initial deposition of C3b on the cell surface, while the absence of MCP allows the MAC to form in the fluid phase, which then opsonizes the cell.\n\nB. The absence of MCP leads to a failure in forming a stable C3 convertase, thus preventing lysis, but the high level of DAF paradoxically enhances the binding of opsonizing antibodies to the cell.\n\nC. The high level of DAF protects the cell from lysis by dissociating the C3 and C5 convertases, but the absence of MCP prevents the enzymatic inactivation of C3b, leaving it deposited on the cell surface to act as an opsonin.\n\nD. The absence of MCP is the primary factor preventing lysis by inhibiting Factor B binding, while the presence of DAF causes an accumulation of C3b on the cell surface, leading to opsonization.\n\nE. Both DAF and the absence of MCP contribute to uncontrolled C5 convertase activity, leading to the formation of non-lytic MACs that serve as opsonins.", "solution": "First, recall the key steps and regulators of the alternative pathway. Spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 yields C3b that can covalently attach to nearby surfaces. Surface-bound C3b binds Factor B, which, after cleavage by Factor D, forms the C3 convertase $C3bBb$. Addition of another C3b yields the C5 convertase, initiating assembly of the Membrane Attack Complex that can lyse cells.\n\nDecay-Accelerating Factor (DAF, CD55) is a membrane regulator that accelerates the dissociation of both C3 convertases and C5 convertases on the cell surface. Its action protects host cells from complement-mediated lysis by limiting convertase stability and thereby preventing the downstream formation of the Membrane Attack Complex. Importantly, DAF does not prevent the initial covalent deposition of C3b on the surface; rather, it acts on the assembled convertases to dissociate their components.\n\nMembrane Cofactor Protein (MCP, CD46) is a membrane regulator that serves as a cofactor for Factor I–mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b (and C4b), converting C3b to iC3b and further degradation products. This cofactor activity removes the ability of C3b to participate in convertase formation and function, but leaves opsonic fragments (particularly iC3b) that are recognized by phagocyte complement receptors. Without MCP on the cell surface, Factor I cannot efficiently cleave surface-bound C3b on that cell, so C3b persists longer in an active or opsonic form on the membrane.\n\nGiven the engineered cell line expresses high levels of DAF but lacks MCP, the following sequence explains the observation. High DAF expression destabilizes C3 and C5 convertases on the cell surface, limiting amplification and preventing efficient C5 convertase activity and MAC assembly; thus, the cell avoids immediate lysis. However, in the absence of MCP, deposited C3b on the cell surface is not efficiently inactivated by Factor I on that cell, so complement fragments remain deposited and serve as potent opsonins (C3b and, via fluid-phase cofactors such as Factor H, iC3b), promoting recognition and ingestion by phagocytes. Therefore, the cell remains intact yet becomes heavily targeted for phagocytosis.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because DAF does not prevent initial C3b deposition and MAC does not “opsonize” in the fluid phase. B is incorrect because MCP absence does not impair convertase formation and DAF does not enhance antibody opsonization. D is incorrect because MCP absence does not inhibit Factor B binding; MCP is inhibitory via Factor I cofactor activity. E is incorrect because DAF reduces, not increases, C5 convertase activity. The correct and complete explanation is that high DAF protects from lysis by dissociating convertases, while absence of MCP prevents Factor I–mediated inactivation of deposited C3b, leaving opsonins on the surface that drive phagocytosis.
