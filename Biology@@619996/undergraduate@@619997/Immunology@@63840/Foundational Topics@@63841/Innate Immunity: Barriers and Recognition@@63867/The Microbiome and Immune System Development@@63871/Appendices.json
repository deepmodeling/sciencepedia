Specifically, she wants to determine if the induction of Interleukin-22 (IL-22) by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) is dependent on a specific receptor, the Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2 (FFAR2). IL-22 is a crucial cytokine for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. FFAR2 is known to be activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as propionate, which are metabolic byproducts of gut bacteria.\n\nTo test this, the researcher isolates lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs), which contain ILCs, from both wild-type (WT) mice and mice genetically engineered to lack the FFAR2 receptor (*Ffar2* knockout, or KO). For each mouse type, $1.0 \\times 10^5$ LPLs are cultured in a volume of $0.20$ mL. The cultures are either left unstimulated (control) or are stimulated with a solution of propionate.\n\nAfter a 24-hour incubation period, the concentration of IL-22 in the culture supernatant is measured using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The assay's output is an optical density (OD) value, which is proportional to the concentration of IL-22.
