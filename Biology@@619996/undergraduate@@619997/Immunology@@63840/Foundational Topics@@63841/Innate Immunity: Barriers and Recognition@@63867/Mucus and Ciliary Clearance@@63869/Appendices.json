This test measures the function of the cilia in the respiratory epithelium, which are responsible for moving the mucus layer that traps inhaled particles. A small, inert particle of saccharin is placed on the nasal mucosa at the anterior end of the inferior turbinate. The subject is instructed to report as soon as they perceive a sweet taste, which occurs when the mucus carrying the saccharin reaches the taste receptors in the nasopharynx. The time elapsed from placement to tasting, known as the mucociliary transit time (MTT), is measured to be 25.0 minutes. The anatomical path length along the mucosal surface from the placement point to the nasopharynx is estimated to be 60.0 mm.\n\nAssuming the saccharin particle moves with the average velocity of the mucus blanket, calculate this average velocity.
