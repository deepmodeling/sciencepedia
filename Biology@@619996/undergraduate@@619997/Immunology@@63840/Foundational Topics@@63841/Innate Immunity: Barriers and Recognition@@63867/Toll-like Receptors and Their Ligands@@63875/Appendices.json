{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how the innate immune system first detects a pathogen is fundamental to immunology. A key principle is that Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) are strategically positioned in different cellular compartments to survey for microbial invaders. This exercise challenges you to apply this concept of spatial organization by predicting the sequence of TLR engagement as a macrophage encounters, engulfs, and destroys a bacterium [@problem_id:2281449]. Mastering this helps clarify how the location of a receptor dictates the type of molecular pattern it can recognize.", "problem": "A macrophage, a type of phagocytic immune cell, is patrolling tissue when it encounters a pathogenic, motile, Gram-negative bacterium. The macrophage proceeds to bind to, internalize, and ultimately destroy the bacterium within an intracellular compartment. The recognition of pathogens by macrophages is mediated by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), a prominent family of which are the Toll-like Receptors (TLRs). TLRs are categorized into two main groups based on their cellular location: cell-surface TLRs, which survey the extracellular environment, and endosomal TLRs, which survey the contents of intracellular vesicles. These receptors recognize conserved microbial structures known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs).\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the sequence and location of TLR engagement by the macrophage as it processes this specific bacterium?\n\nA. A surface TLR is engaged first, followed by the engagement of an endosomal TLR after the bacterium is internalized and begins to be degraded.\n\nB. Only an endosomal TLR is engaged, as the bacterium must be fully broken down within a phagolysosome before any of its PAMPs can be detected.\n\nC. Only a surface TLR is engaged, as all a bacterium's PAMPs are located on its exterior and are lost upon degradation.\n\nD. TLRs are engaged only after bacterial proteins are processed and presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules.\n\nE. Both a surface TLR and an endosomal TLR are engaged simultaneously the moment the macrophage first contacts the bacterium.", "solution": "Macrophages detect microbes via Pattern Recognition Receptors, prominently Toll-like Receptors that are partitioned by location into cell-surface TLRs (surveying extracellular space) and endosomal TLRs (surveying contents of internalized vesicles). Cell-surface TLRs detect accessible surface-exposed PAMPs on intact microbes, whereas endosomal TLRs detect microbial nucleic acids and other components that become exposed after internalization and degradation within phagosomes and phagolysosomes.\n\nFor a motile, Gram-negative bacterium, key surface-exposed PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide on the outer membrane (recognized by TLR4) and flagellin in the flagellum of motile bacteria (recognized by TLR5). These PAMPs are accessible before phagocytosis, so engagement of surface TLRs occurs at or before binding and uptake. Following phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a phagosome that matures and fuses with lysosomes, allowing degradation. This degradation exposes microbial nucleic acids and other internal components to endosomal TLRs, such as TLR9, which recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs typical of bacterial genomes (and, in humans, TLR7/8 for bacterial RNA can also contribute). Thus, endosomal TLRs are engaged after internalization and degradation.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence and location are initial engagement of surface TLRs upon contact with the intact bacterium, followed by engagement of endosomal TLRs after the bacterium is internalized and begins to be degraded. This matches option A.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because both surface and endosomal TLRs can be engaged at different stages; it is not exclusively one or the other. Option D is incorrect because TLR engagement is an innate recognition event that precedes and helps drive antigen processing and MHC class II presentation. Option E is incorrect because endosomal TLRs require internalization into vesicles and do not engage simultaneously upon first external contact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2281449"}, {"introduction": "Once a TLR binds its ligand, the signal must be relayed inside the cell to orchestrate a response. This process is not monolithic; different TLRs recruit distinct adaptor proteins that trigger pathways tailored to the specific threat. This problem focuses on a critical divergence point in antiviral immunity, where the cell must produce type I interferons [@problem_id:2281472]. By analyzing the activation of the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3), you can deduce which specific adaptor protein, such as Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) or TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), is essential for this particular response.", "problem": "A team of immunologists is investigating the innate immune response to a novel pathogenic RNA virus. They infect a culture of human dendritic cells with the virus. Within hours, they detect a significant increase in the secretion of type I interferons (e.g., IFN-β) into the culture medium. To understand the underlying mechanism, they perform a Western blot analysis on cell lysates. The results show a strong band corresponding to the phosphorylated, active form of Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3), which is known to be a key transcription factor for type I interferon genes. The researchers conclude that the virus is being recognized by a specific endosomal Toll-Like Receptor (TLR), triggering a distinct signaling cascade.\n\nBased on the definitive observation of IRF3 activation, which one of the following intracellular adaptor proteins is essential for initiating this specific antiviral signaling pathway?\n\nA. Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)\n\nB. TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)\n\nC. TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)\n\nD. TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)\n\nE. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4)", "solution": "The observation is that infection with an RNA virus leads to rapid secretion of type I interferons and that Western blot shows phosphorylated IRF3, the active form of a transcription factor crucial for IFN-β transcription. The question specifies recognition by an endosomal Toll-like receptor.\n\nKey innate immune pathways to consider:\n1) Endosomal TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA. TLR3 signals exclusively through the adaptor TRIF (also known as TICAM-1). This pathway activates the kinases TBK1 and IKKε, which phosphorylate IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and induces type I interferon genes such as IFN-β.\n2) Endosomal TLR7 (and TLR8 in humans) recognizes single-stranded RNA. These receptors signal through MyD88, which prominently activates IRF7 (particularly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and also NF-κB and AP-1, but IRF3 activation is not the hallmark of the MyD88-dependent antiviral pathway.\n3) TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA in endosomes and also signals via MyD88, with a similar IRF7-centric type I interferon response in plasmacytoid dendritic cells.\n4) TLR4 can signal via both MyD88 and TRIF; its TRIF-dependent arm (after endocytosis to endosomes) can activate IRF3. However, for viral nucleic acid sensing in endosomes, TLR3 is the prototypical receptor that robustly activates IRF3 via TRIF.\n\nAssessment of the listed adaptors:\n- MyD88 (A): Used by most TLRs except TLR3; associated with NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF7 activation, not specifically IRF3 in antiviral signaling.\n- TRIF (B): Essential adaptor for TLR3 (and the TRIF arm of TLR4) leading to TBK1/IKKε-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3 and type I interferon induction.\n- TRAF6 (C): An E3 ubiquitin ligase downstream of MyD88-dependent signaling, more associated with NF-κB and AP-1 activation; not the defining adaptor initiating IRF3 activation via TLR3.\n- TIRAP (D): Also called Mal; bridges TLR2 and TLR4 to MyD88 at the plasma membrane; not involved in IRF3 activation via the TRIF pathway.\n- IRAK4 (E): A kinase in the MyD88 pathway; not required for TRIF-dependent IRF3 activation.\n\nGiven the definitive evidence of IRF3 activation in an endosomal TLR antiviral context, the essential adaptor is TRIF.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2281472"}, {"introduction": "The journey from a gene to a functional immune receptor is complex and involves many accessory proteins. This final practice problem transitions from core mechanisms to clinical application by presenting a case study rooted in molecular cell biology [@problem_id:2281454]. By examining the role of $UNC93B1$, an essential protein for transporting nucleic acid-sensing TLRs to their correct location, you are challenged to predict a patient's specific disease susceptibility from a single genetic defect. This exercise powerfully illustrates how a breakdown in a fundamental process like protein trafficking can lead to a specific immunodeficiency, connecting molecular pathways directly to human health.", "problem": "A clinical immunologist is investigating a patient presenting with recurrent, severe viral infections, particularly those caused by Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Genetic sequencing reveals a rare homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding UNC93B1.\n\nIn a healthy individual, UNC93B1 is an essential multi-pass transmembrane protein located in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Its primary function is to facilitate the correct trafficking of a specific subset of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) from the ER to endosomal compartments, where they can encounter their respective pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The TLRs dependent on UNC93B1 for this trafficking are TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9.\n\nFor context, the ligands for these key TLRs are:\n- TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).\n- TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA).\n- TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs.\n\nConversely, TLRs located on the cell surface, such as TLR2 (recognizing bacterial lipopeptides) and TLR4 (recognizing bacterial lipopolysaccharide, or LPS), do not require UNC93B1 for their transport to the plasma membrane.\n\nGiven this patient's specific genetic defect, which of the following clinical and immunological phenotypes is most expected?\n\nA. The patient will show impaired responses to both extracellular bacteria and a wide range of viruses, due to a global failure of TLR signaling.\n\nB. The patient will have a selective and profound susceptibility to infections by various DNA and RNA viruses, but will likely mount a normal inflammatory response to most extracellular bacteria.\n\nC. The patient will demonstrate a specific inability to control extracellular bacterial infections, particularly those caused by gram-negative bacteria, while maintaining normal antiviral immunity.\n\nD. The patient will be immunocompromised against all pathogens, as the UNC93B1 mutation prevents the activation of all myeloid cells.\n\nE. The patient will have normal responses to all pathogens, as other trafficking proteins can compensate for the loss of UNC93B1 function.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the immunological consequences of a loss-of-function mutation in the `UNC93B1` gene.\n\nFirst, we must analyze the function of the UNC93B1 protein. The problem states that UNC93B1 is an essential protein for trafficking a specific group of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)—namely TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9—from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to endosomes. These TLRs are known as the endosomal or intracellular TLRs because their function is to detect nucleic acids inside the cell, specifically within endosomal compartments.\n\nA homozygous loss-of-function mutation means the patient produces a non-functional UNC93B1 protein. Without a functional UNC93B1 to act as a chaperone, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 will be synthesized but will fail to traffic from the ER to the endosomes. They will be effectively trapped in the ER, unable to reach their ligands. This results in a complete loss of function for these four specific TLR pathways.\n\nNext, we identify the pathogens that are detected by these non-functional TLRs.\n- TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a PAMP associated with many viral infections.\n- TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), a feature of many RNA viruses.\n- TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA, found in the genomes of bacteria and certain DNA viruses, such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).\nThe problem explicitly mentions the patient suffers from recurrent HSV infections, which is consistent with a defect in the TLR9 pathway. The combined failure of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 means the patient's innate immune system cannot effectively detect and initiate a response against a wide array of both RNA and DNA viruses. This leads to a profound and selective susceptibility to viral infections.\n\nNow, we consider the immune response to other classes of pathogens, like extracellular bacteria. The problem states that cell surface-expressed TLRs, such as TLR2 and TLR4, do not depend on UNC93B1 for their trafficking to the plasma membrane.\n- TLR4 detects lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key component of gram-negative bacteria.\n- TLR2 (in various combinations) detects peptidoglycan and lipopeptides from gram-positive bacteria.\nSince the function of these surface TLRs is intact, the patient's immune system should be able to recognize and mount a normal or near-normal inflammatory response to most common extracellular bacterial infections.\n\nBy synthesizing these findings, we can conclude that the patient's immunodeficiency is not global but highly specific. It is characterized by an impaired ability to fight viral infections due to the failure of endosomal TLR sensing, while the ability to respond to extracellular bacteria via surface TLRs is preserved.\n\nWe now evaluate the options based on this conclusion:\n- **A. The patient will show impaired responses to both extracellular bacteria and a wide range of viruses, due to a global failure of TLR signaling.** This is incorrect. The response to extracellular bacteria mediated by surface TLRs should be normal.\n- **B. The patient will have a selective and profound susceptibility to infections by various DNA and RNA viruses, but will likely mount a normal inflammatory response to most extracellular bacteria.** This is correct. It accurately describes the selective nature of the immunodeficiency caused by the UNC93B1 mutation, affecting endosomal TLRs (viral sensing) but not surface TLRs (bacterial sensing).\n- **C. The patient will demonstrate a specific inability to control extracellular bacterial infections, particularly those caused by gram-negative bacteria, while maintaining normal antiviral immunity.** This is incorrect. It describes the opposite phenotype; antiviral immunity is the primary defect.\n- **D. The patient will be immunocompromised against all pathogens, as the UNC93B1 mutation prevents the activation of all myeloid cells.** This is an overstatement and incorrect. While TLR signaling is important for myeloid cell activation, this specific defect only affects a subset of TLRs and does not cause a total shutdown of myeloid cell function.\n- **E. The patient will have normal responses to all pathogens, as other trafficking proteins can compensate for the loss of UNC93B1 function.** This is incorrect. The problem describes UNC93B1 as essential, and the patient's severe clinical symptoms directly contradict the idea of effective compensation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the patient's phenotype is a selective susceptibility to viral infections with largely intact immunity against extracellular bacteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2281454"}]}
