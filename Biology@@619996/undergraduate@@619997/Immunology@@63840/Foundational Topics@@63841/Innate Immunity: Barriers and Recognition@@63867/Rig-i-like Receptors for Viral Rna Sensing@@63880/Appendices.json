This first practice explores the very foundation of this recognition process by focusing on the RIG-I sensor. Through a hypothetical scenario, you will investigate how a single, critical feature of viral RNA—the 5'-triphosphate group—acts as a \"molecular key\" to unlock the antiviral response, illustrating the remarkable specificity of our cellular defenses.", "problem": "The innate immune system employs a variety of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) to detect invading pathogens. Within the cytoplasm of a cell, a key family of PRRs for sensing viral infections are the RIG-I-like receptors. One such receptor, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), is crucial for initiating an antiviral response. RIG-I functions by specifically recognizing viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). A primary molecular signature, or pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), that allows RIG-I to distinguish viral RNA from the cell's own RNA is the presence of an uncapped 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp) group at the terminus of the RNA molecule. This feature is common on RNAs produced during the replication of many viruses, whereas host messenger RNAs are typically modified with a 5'-cap.\n\nAn immunologist is investigating this pathway. They begin with a short, double-stranded viral RNA molecule known to be a potent activator of the RIG-I signaling cascade, leading to a strong antiviral response. The scientist then creates a modified version of this RNA. The modified RNA has the exact same nucleotide sequence and double-stranded structure as the original, but its 5'-triphosphate group has been biochemically removed, leaving a 5'-monophosphate group in its place.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome when this modified RNA is introduced into the cytoplasm of a host cell, compared to the original unmodified viral RNA?\n\nA. The modified RNA will bind to RIG-I with higher affinity, resulting in a more potent antiviral response.\n\nB. The modification will have no effect, and the modified RNA will be detected by RIG-I with the same efficiency as the original RNA.\n\nC. The detection of the modified RNA by RIG-I will be significantly impaired or entirely abolished, leading to a much weaker or absent antiviral response.\n\nD. The modified RNA will no longer be detected by RIG-I but will instead be primarily detected by a different receptor, such as the endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3).\n\nE. The modification will cause the RNA to be recognized by the host cell's capping enzymes, which will add a 5'-cap and mark it as \"self,\" thus preventing any immune detection.", "solution": "RIG-I is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor that preferentially recognizes short double-stranded RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp) at a blunt end. The 5'-ppp serves as a key pathogen-associated molecular pattern distinguishing many viral RNAs from host RNAs, which are typically 5'-capped or otherwise processed to remove the triphosphate. Binding of RIG-I to 5'-ppp dsRNA promotes its conformational activation, exposure of its caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), and downstream signaling through MAVS, culminating in type I interferon production.\n\nRemoving the 5'-triphosphate to generate a 5'-monophosphate disrupts the specific molecular determinant required for high-affinity recognition by RIG-I. Although RIG-I can bind some RNAs independent of 5'-ppp under certain structural contexts, the potency of activation by short dsRNA is strongly dependent on the 5'-ppp or 5'-pp moiety, and 5'-p substantially reduces or abolishes signaling. Thus, the modified RNA will bind weakly, if at all, and will fail to activate RIG-I efficiently, resulting in a markedly diminished antiviral response.\n\nConsidering alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because removal of the 5'-ppp reduces, not increases, RIG-I affinity and signaling.\n- Option B is incorrect because the 5'-ppp is a critical determinant; removing it changes detection efficacy.\n- Option D is unlikely: TLR3 is localized to endosomes and detects dsRNA within that compartment, not cytosolic RNA delivered directly into the cytoplasm; furthermore, short dsRNA with 5'-p is not preferentially redirected to TLR3 in the cytosol.\n- Option E is incorrect because capping machinery acts primarily co-transcriptionally in the nucleus on RNA polymerase II transcripts; cytosolic double-stranded RNAs are not efficiently capped and 5'-p does not trigger “self” marking by capping enzymes in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that detection by RIG-I will be significantly impaired or abolished, with a much weaker or absent antiviral response.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2265136"}, {"introduction": "Once a sensor like RIG-I binds to viral RNA, how is that detection event communicated to the rest of the cell? This exercise delves into the modular architecture of signaling proteins, where distinct domains perform separate tasks of sensing and signaling. By considering a genetically modified RIG-I protein, you will dissect the crucial role of the CARD domains in transmitting the alarm from the sensor to the downstream machinery, demonstrating that detection without signal transduction is a dead end.", "problem": "In the cellular cytoplasm, the Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) protein acts as a critical sensor for viral RNA, a type of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP). The RIG-I protein is composed of several functional domains. A C-terminal helicase domain is responsible for recognizing and binding to specific viral RNA structures. Two N-terminal Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domains (CARDs) are essential for downstream signal transduction, which occurs through interaction with the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein (MAVS). This signaling cascade ultimately leads to the production of Type I interferons (IFNs), potent antiviral cytokines.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a human cell line is genetically engineered to express a mutant form of RIG-I. This mutant RIG-I protein possesses a fully functional helicase domain but has its two N-terminal CARD domains completely deleted.\n\nUpon infection of this engineered cell line with a typical RNA virus, which of the following outcomes is the most likely and direct consequence of this specific mutation?\n\nA. The cell will be unable to detect the presence of viral RNA in the cytoplasm, allowing the virus to replicate without triggering any part of the RIG-I pathway.\n\nB. The mutant RIG-I will become constitutively active even without viral infection, leading to a constant, low-level production of Type I interferons.\n\nC. The mutant RIG-I will successfully bind to the viral RNA, but the cell will fail to produce Type I interferons because the signal cannot be transmitted to MAVS.\n\nD. The binding of viral RNA will cause the mutant RIG-I to immediately trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) as an alternative defense mechanism.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the cellular response to a viral infection in a cell expressing a mutant RIG-I protein that lacks its CARD domains but has a functional helicase domain. To solve this, we must analyze the step-by-step process of the normal RIG-I signaling pathway and identify the point of failure caused by the mutation.\n\nStep 1: Understand the normal function of RIG-I domains.\nThe RIG-I protein has two main functional parts relevant to this problem:\n1.  The C-terminal helicase domain: This is the \"sensor\" part. It recognizes and binds to viral RNA (specifically, RNA with a 5'-triphosphate group) in the cytoplasm.\n2.  The N-terminal CARD domains: These are the \"signaling\" parts. After the helicase domain binds RNA, the RIG-I protein undergoes a conformational change that exposes the CARD domains. These domains then interact with the corresponding CARD domain on the MAVS adapter protein, which is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein-protein interaction is the crucial first step in passing the \"viral presence\" signal downstream.\n\nStep 2: Trace the normal signaling pathway after RNA binding.\n1.  Viral RNA enters the cytoplasm.\n2.  The RIG-I helicase domain binds to the viral RNA.\n3.  RIG-I changes shape, exposing its CARD domains.\n4.  The RIG-I CARD domains bind to the MAVS CARD domain.\n5.  This interaction causes MAVS to aggregate, forming a signaling platform.\n6.  The MAVS platform recruits and activates kinases (e.g., TBK1).\n7.  These kinases phosphorylate transcription factors (e.g., IRF3).\n8.  Phosphorylated IRF3 moves into the nucleus and activates the transcription of genes for Type I interferons (IFNs).\n9.  The cell secretes IFNs, which signal to neighboring cells to heighten their antiviral defenses.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect of the specified mutation.\nThe mutant RIG-I has a functional helicase domain but lacks the CARD domains.\n-   Because the helicase domain is functional, the mutant RIG-I will still be able to recognize and bind to the viral RNA when the cell is infected. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The cell *does* detect the viral RNA at the protein level.\n-   The CARD domains are the components responsible for transmitting the signal from RIG-I to MAVS. Since these domains are deleted, the mutant RIG-I, even after binding to viral RNA and changing its conformation, has no way to interact with MAVS.\n-   Without the RIG-I-MAVS interaction, the downstream signaling cascade (MAVS aggregation, kinase activation, IRF3 phosphorylation, and IFN gene transcription) cannot be initiated.\n-   Consequently, the cell will fail to produce Type I interferons in response to the viral infection via this pathway. This matches the description in option C.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the other incorrect options.\n-   Option B suggests constitutive activity. This is incorrect. Constitutive activity would imply that the protein is \"on\" all the time, signaling without a stimulus (viral RNA). This usually happens when a regulatory domain is mutated or removed. Here, the *signaling* domain itself (CARDs) is removed. Without the signaling domain, the protein is inert and cannot signal at all, whether a virus is present or not.\n-   Option D suggests an alternative outcome of apoptosis. While viral infections can trigger apoptosis through various mechanisms, the deletion of the CARD domains of RIG-I does not inherently reroute its function to trigger programmed cell death. The primary and direct function of RIG-I's CARD domains is to initiate the IFN-mediated antiviral response, not to control apoptosis in this manner. Loss of this function simply breaks the signaling chain.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and certain consequence of deleting the CARD domains is that the sensor (helicase domain) can still bind its target (viral RNA), but the signal cannot be passed on to the next molecule in the pathway (MAVS). This results in a failure to produce the pathway's end product, Type I interferons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2265109"}, {"introduction": "Viruses are diverse, producing a wide array of RNA structures during replication. To counter this, our cells employ a family of sensors, including both RIG-I and MDA5. This final practice illuminates the elegant architecture of the RLR pathway, where signals from different upstream sensors converge on a single, indispensable adaptor protein. By examining the impact of a non-functional MAVS protein, you will understand its central role as a signaling hub, essential for orchestrating a unified antiviral response regardless of which sensor initially detected the threat.", "problem": "The innate immune system employs intracellular sensors to detect viral infections. A key family of these sensors is the RIG-I-like Receptor (RLR) family, which resides in the cytoplasm of cells. Within this family, two important sensors are:\n1.  Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which primarily recognizes short double-stranded RNA molecules that possess a 5'-triphosphate group, a structure characteristic of many viral genomes and replication intermediates.\n2.  Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), which primarily recognizes long double-stranded RNA molecules, often produced during the replication cycle of other types of viruses.\n\nUpon binding to their respective viral RNA ligands, both RIG-I and MDA5 initiate a signaling cascade that requires their interaction with a specific adaptor protein anchored to the outer membrane of mitochondria. This interaction is the critical first step in a chain of events that leads to the activation of transcription factors, which then enter the nucleus to induce the expression and secretion of type I interferons. These interferons are crucial cytokines that establish an antiviral state in the infected cell and its neighbors.\n\nNow, consider a special cell line that has been genetically engineered such that it expresses a non-functional version of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). This cell line is divided into two separate cultures. One culture is infected with Virus A, which generates short 5'-triphosphate RNA in the cytoplasm. The other culture is infected with Virus B, which generates long double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected immunological outcome?\n\nA. The cells will be unable to produce type I interferons in response to either Virus A or Virus B because MAVS is a common downstream signaling adaptor required by both the RIG-I and MDA5 pathways.\n\nB. The cells will produce type I interferons in response to Virus A but not Virus B, because MAVS is only required for the signaling pathway initiated by MDA5.\n\nC. The cells will produce type I interferons in response to Virus B but not Virus A, because MAVS is only required for the signaling pathway initiated by RIG-I.\n\nD. The cells will be unable to produce type I interferons in response to either virus because the non-functional MAVS protein prevents both RIG-I and MDA5 from binding to their respective viral RNA ligands.\n\nE. The cells will produce a normal amount of type I interferons in response to both viruses, as the RLR pathway can utilize an alternative adaptor protein on the mitochondria to bypass a non-functional MAVS.", "solution": "RIG-I and MDA5 are cytosolic RNA sensors in the RIG-I-like receptor family. RIG-I recognizes short double-stranded RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate, while MDA5 recognizes long double-stranded RNA. Upon binding their respective ligands, both receptors undergo conformational changes that expose their N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), enabling CARD–CARD interactions with the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS (also known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane.\n\nMAVS is the shared and essential adaptor for both RIG-I and MDA5 signaling pathways. MAVS recruits and activates downstream kinases, including TBK1 and IKK$\\epsilon$, which phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7, and also engages the IKK complex to activate NF-$\\kappa$B. The coordinated activation and nuclear translocation of these transcription factors is required to induce transcription of type I interferon genes.\n\nIn a cell line expressing a non-functional MAVS, ligand recognition by RIG-I and MDA5 can still occur in the cytosol, because MAVS acts downstream and is not required for RNA binding. However, the essential adaptor step is blocked, so the downstream signaling cascade to TBK1/IKK$\\epsilon$, IRF3/IRF7, and NF-$\\kappa$B fails. Consequently, type I interferon production via the RLR pathway will be abrogated for both short 5'-triphosphate RNA (Virus A; RIG-I) and long double-stranded RNA (Virus B; MDA5). There is no alternative mitochondrial adaptor that compensates for MAVS in the RLR pathway.\n\nTherefore, the cells will be unable to produce type I interferons in response to either virus, matching option A. Option B and C are incorrect because MAVS is required by both RIG-I and MDA5. Option D is incorrect because MAVS does not mediate ligand binding. Option E is incorrect because there is no alternative adaptor that bypasses MAVS in this pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2265087"}]}
