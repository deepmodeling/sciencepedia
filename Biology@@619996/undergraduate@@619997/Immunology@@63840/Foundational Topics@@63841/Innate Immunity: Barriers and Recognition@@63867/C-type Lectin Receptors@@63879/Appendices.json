This first practice [@problem_id:2220354] sharpens your foundational knowledge by challenging you to match a specific bacterial PAMP to its corresponding receptor on a macrophage, the critical first step in initiating an immune response.", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying a novel bacterium, designated *Marinus glucanophilus*, isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. A key focus of their research is to understand how the host innate immune system might recognize this previously uncharacterized microbe. Through biochemical analysis, they determine that the bacterium's cell wall is exceptionally rich in polysaccharides composed of (1,3)-$\\beta$-glucan linkages. A subsequent, more detailed analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirms a conspicuous absence of terminal mannose residues on the bacterial surface glycoproteins and glycolipids.\n\nAssuming these are the dominant features of the bacterial surface, which of the following C-type Lectin Receptors (CLRs) expressed on the surface of a macrophage would be primarily responsible for the initial recognition of *Marinus glucanophilus*?\n\nA.

Pattern-recognition by macrophage C-type lectin receptors depends on specific carbohydrate ligands.\n\nEvaluate each option based on known ligand specificities:\n- Mannose Receptor (CD206) primarily recognizes terminal mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine residues on glycans. The explicit absence of terminal mannose argues against CD206 as the primary receptor.\n- Dectin-1 (CLEC7A) is a CLR with high specificity for $\\beta$-glucans, especially $\\beta$-1,3-linked glucans commonly found in fungal cell walls. It signals via Syk and the CARD9 pathway upon binding $\\beta$-glucans and is expressed on macrophages, making it the canonical receptor for this ligand class.\n- DC-SIGN (CD209) recognizes high-mannose and fucosylated structures; lack of terminal mannose disfavors its engagement.\n- Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is not a CLR and recognizes lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria; it does not match the carbohydrate specificity described.\n- Mincle (CLEC4E) recognizes certain glycolipids (e.g., trehalose dimycolate) and SAP130 from damaged cells; it is not the primary receptor for $\\beta$-glucans.\n\nGiven the dominance of (1,3)-$\\beta$-glucans and the absence of terminal mannose, the macrophage CLR most directly responsible for initial recognition is Dectin-1 (CLEC7A).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2220354"}, {"introduction": "Effective immune function requires receptors to do more than just bind to a pathogen; they must trigger a cellular action. This is achieved through distinct structural domains that handle recognition and subsequent intracellular signaling or trafficking. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2220306] explores this crucial principle by asking you to predict the functional outcome when a receptor's binding and effector domains are surgically separated, helping to clarify the link between protein structure and cellular function.", "problem": "C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are a class of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) crucial for the innate immune system's ability to recognize fungal and bacterial pathogens. One such CLR is the Mannose Receptor (CD206), which is highly expressed on the surface of macrophages. Structurally, the Mannose Receptor possesses external carbohydrate-recognition domains that specifically bind to mannose and fucose residues commonly found on microbial surfaces, and an intracellular cytoplasmic tail required to connect with the cell's internal machinery.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a macrophage line is genetically engineered. This modification results in the expression of a mutant Mannose Receptor that is properly folded and transported to the cell surface. However, the mutation has completely deleted the receptor's intracellular cytoplasmic tail, while leaving all of its external carbohydrate-recognition domains perfectly intact and functional.\n\nIf this engineered macrophage encounters a bacterium whose surface is rich in mannose-containing glycoproteins, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the change in the macrophage's initial response, specifically concerning the function of the Mannose Receptor?\n\nA. The macrophage will be completely unable to recognize or bind to the bacterium, resulting in no immune response.\n\nB. The macrophage will bind to the bacterium via the Mannose Receptor but will be unable to initiate phagocytosis of the bacterium through this receptor.\n\nC. The macrophage will bind to and phagocytose the bacterium with normal efficiency, but it will be unable to destroy the bacterium in the resulting phagolysosome.\n\nD. The macrophage will bind to and phagocytose the bacterium more efficiently than normal due to the lack of inhibitory signals from the cytoplasmic tail.\n\nE. The macrophage will not bind the bacterium, but it will still be triggered to release a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "solution": "We identify the relevant structural-functional relationships of the Mannose Receptor (CD206). It contains external carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) that mediate specific binding to mannose and fucose residues on microbial surfaces, and a cytoplasmic tail that encodes motifs required for endocytosis/phagocytosis, such as tyrosine-based and di-leucine motifs that recruit adaptor proteins and link to clathrin-mediated internalization and actin-dependent phagocytic machinery.\n\nGiven the engineered macrophage expresses a mutant receptor that is properly folded and trafficked to the cell surface, with all external CRDs intact, ligand recognition and binding to mannose-rich bacterial surfaces will remain intact. Therefore, a complete loss of binding (Option A) is inconsistent with the intact extracellular domains and correct surface expression.\n\nThe deletion of the cytoplasmic tail removes the receptor’s capacity to couple ligand binding to intracellular processes needed for internalization and phagocytosis via this receptor, because the intracellular motifs are necessary to recruit endocytic adaptors and organize cytoskeletal rearrangements. Therefore, the receptor can bind but cannot initiate phagocytosis through its own pathway. This directly supports Option B.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the defect is upstream of phagolysosomal killing; without the cytoplasmic tail, the receptor-mediated internalization step fails, so impaired destruction in the phagolysosome is not the primary consequence of this specific mutation. Option D is incorrect because the cytoplasmic tail of the Mannose Receptor is not primarily inhibitory; it is required for internalization. Option E is incorrect because the Mannose Receptor is not a strong pro-inflammatory signaling receptor like some ITAM-containing CLRs (e.g., dectin-1), and deletion of the tail would not enhance cytokine release; moreover, binding remains intact rather than being lost.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the macrophage will bind via the Mannose Receptor but will be unable to initiate phagocytosis through this receptor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2220306"}, {"introduction": "After a receptor recognizes a pathogen, a cascade of intracellular signals is required to mount a tailored and effective immune defense. When a single link in this signaling chain is broken, it can lead to surprisingly specific vulnerabilities to certain classes of pathogens. By analyzing a clinical vignette [@problem_id:2220324], you will connect a molecular defect in a key signaling adapter to a patient's specific disease susceptibility, illustrating how the integrity of CLR pathways is vital for human health.", "problem": "A 24-year-old patient is admitted to a hospital with a severe, disseminated fungal infection caused by *Candida albicans*. The patient's medical history is notable for recurrent and difficult-to-treat mucocutaneous fungal infections since childhood. However, the patient has successfully recovered from common viral illnesses, such as influenza and varicella (chickenpox), with no unusual complications. Laboratory workup reveals normal counts and functions of B cells and T cells in standard assays. Further genetic testing identifies a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Card9 (Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9), a signaling adaptor protein.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate immunological explanation for this patient's specific susceptibility to fungal, but not viral, pathogens?\n\nA. Card9 is a universal adaptor protein required for signaling from all Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), but its deficiency is only clinically apparent during high-burden fungal infections.\n\nB. The Card9 protein is essential for the function of Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) that detect viral nucleic acids, and its absence dysregulates the immune system, leading to a weakened response specifically against fungi.\n\nC. Card9 is a critical component of the signaling pathway downstream of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) Dectin-1, which recognizes fungal cell wall components, but it is not essential for the primary cytosolic pathways that detect viral infections.\n\nD. The mutation in Card9 impairs the ability of macrophages and neutrophils to perform phagocytosis, a process that is uniquely important for clearing fungi but not for controlling viral replication.\n\nE. Card9 is exclusively expressed in T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and its absence prevents these cells from producing anti-fungal cytokines while leaving other T cell responses, including anti-viral responses, intact.", "solution": "Identify the key clinical-immunological pattern: recurrent mucocutaneous and invasive Candida infections since childhood with otherwise normal control of common viral infections, and normal B and T cell counts/functions in standard assays. Genetic testing shows a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in Card9. The phenotype points to a selective defect in innate antifungal sensing/signaling rather than a broad adaptive immune deficiency or a defect in antiviral sensing.\n\nDefine the role of Card9: Card9 is an adaptor protein predominantly expressed in myeloid lineage cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils). It functions downstream of Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), notably Dectin-1 (CLEC7A), Dectin-2 (CLEC6A), and Mincle, which recognize fungal cell wall components such as beta-glucans and mannans. Upon ligand recognition, CLRs signal via Syk to assemble the Card9–Bcl10–Malt1 complex, leading to activation of NF-$\\kappa$B and MAPK pathways and consequent production of cytokines including IL-1$\\beta$, IL-6, TNF, and IL-23. This cascade promotes neutrophil recruitment and Th17 responses that are critical for antifungal immunity at mucocutaneous barriers and in systemic defense.\n\nContrast with antiviral sensing pathways: Primary antiviral innate immune detection is mediated by endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7/8, TLR9) using adaptors MyD88 or TRIF, and by cytosolic sensors (RIG-I, MDA5) signaling via MAVS, and DNA sensing via cGAS–STING. Card9 is not essential for these antiviral pathways. Therefore, Card9 deficiency selectively compromises antifungal responses while leaving core antiviral innate signaling intact, consistent with preserved clinical control of viral infections.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- Option A is incorrect because Card9 is not a universal adaptor for all PRRs; MyD88 and TRIF serve broader TLR roles, while MAVS and STING serve cytosolic viral pathways.\n- Option B is incorrect because TLR antiviral signaling relies on MyD88/TRIF, not Card9; the explanation misattributes TLR dependence to Card9.\n- Option C is correct: Card9 is critical downstream of Dectin-1 (a CLR) for antifungal recognition/signaling and is not essential for primary antiviral cytosolic detection pathways.\n- Option D is incorrect because Card9 deficiency impairs signaling and cytokine production, not the core machinery of phagocytosis; moreover, phagocytosis is not uniquely required for fungi.\n- Option E is incorrect because Card9 is not exclusively expressed in Th17 cells; it is primarily a myeloid adaptor. While Card9-dependent cytokines promote Th17 responses, its expression and function are not restricted to Th17 cells.\n\nThus, the most accurate explanation is that Card9 is essential for CLR (Dectin-1)-mediated antifungal signaling and dispensable for primary antiviral detection pathways.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2220324"}]}
