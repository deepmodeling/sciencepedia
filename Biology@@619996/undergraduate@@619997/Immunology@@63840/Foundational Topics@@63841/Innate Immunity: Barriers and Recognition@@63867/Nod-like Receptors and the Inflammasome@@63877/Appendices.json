This first practice problem [@problem_id:2255143] presents a clinical scenario involving a gain-of-function mutation in the *NLRP3* gene, a situation that gives rise to a group of autoinflammatory conditions known as Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). By working through this case, you will solidify your understanding of the primary effector function of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its direct link to the production of a key pro-inflammatory cytokine.", "problem": "A two-year-old child presents with recurrent episodes of fever, hives, and joint pain, with no identifiable infectious cause. Genetic testing reveals a mutation in the *NLRP3* gene, leading to a condition known as a Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). The mutation is characterized as a \"gain-of-function\" mutation, meaning the protein product is constitutively active. Intracellularly, the NLRP3 protein is a member of the NOD-like Receptor (NLR) family and is a key component in the formation of a protein complex called the inflammasome. The inflammasome's primary role is to activate a specific protease, which in turn processes a key signaling molecule.\n\nGiven this background, which of the following cytokines would be expected to be found at chronically elevated levels in the patient's serum as a direct consequence of the constitutively active NLRP3 inflammasome?\n\nA. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)\n\nB. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β)\n\nC. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)\n\nD. Interleukin-10 (IL-10)\n\nE. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)", "solution": "The NLRP3 protein is a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor in the NOD-like receptor family that assembles the NLRP3 inflammasome upon activation. A gain-of-function mutation that renders NLRP3 constitutively active leads to continuous inflammasome assembly. The canonical NLRP3 inflammasome recruits the adaptor ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to proximity-induced autoactivation of caspase-1.\n\nThe key effector function of active caspase-1 is proteolytic processing of specific cytokine precursors into their mature, secreted forms, most notably pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18.

Among the listed options, IL-1β is the cytokine whose elevated serum level is a direct consequence of caspase-1–mediated processing driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome. In contrast, TNF-alpha and IL-6 are primarily upregulated via transcriptional programs (for example, NF-κB) rather than direct caspase-1 processing, IFN-γ is produced by Th1 cells and NK cells independent of inflammasome processing, and IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine not directly generated by caspase-1 cleavage.\n\nThus, the expected chronically elevated cytokine as a direct consequence of a constitutively active NLRP3 inflammasome is IL-1β.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255143"}, {"introduction": "The inflammasome is not a single protein but a multi-component machine where each part has a specific job. This exercise [@problem_id:2255144] challenges you to think like a molecular biologist, predicting the functional outcome of removing a key \"bridge\" protein—the adaptor ASC. This thought experiment will clarify how a signal from an activated sensor is transmitted to downstream effector enzymes, demonstrating the modular and sequential logic of inflammasome assembly.", "problem": "The inflammasome is a large intracellular multi-protein complex that plays a critical role in the innate immune system by activating inflammatory processes. Canonical inflammasome activation in a macrophage, which leads to the maturation of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), generally follows a specific sequence. First, a priming signal, such as a Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP), induces the synthesis of inactive precursor proteins, including pro-IL-1β and the sensor protein NLRP3. Second, an activation signal, such as a Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), triggers the oligomerization of NLRP3. This sensor then recruits an adaptor protein, which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1, an inactive protease. This recruitment leads to the activation of caspase-1, which then cleaves pro-IL-1β into its mature, active form for secretion.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered macrophage cell line that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the adaptor protein known as Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). These cells are exposed to appropriate priming and activation signals that would normally trigger robust NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the direct outcome of the ASC mutation on IL-1β processing in these cells?\n\nA. The priming signal fails to induce transcription of the gene for pro-IL-1β, so no precursor is available for processing.\n\nB. Pro-caspase-1 is not recruited to the inflammasome complex and therefore is not activated, preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β.\n\nC. The NLRP3 sensor protein fails to oligomerize in response to the activation signal, halting the assembly of the inflammasome at the initial step.\n\nD. Mature, active IL-1β is correctly produced but accumulates in the cytoplasm because the ASC protein is also required for its secretion.", "solution": "Step 1: Establish the canonical sequence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The process requires two signals. The priming signal (e.g., a PAMP via Toll-like receptors and NF-κB activation) induces transcription and translation of precursor proteins, including pro-IL-1β and the NLRP3 sensor. The activation signal (e.g., a DAMP) causes NLRP3 to oligomerize and recruit an adaptor protein, ASC, which contains a PYD domain to bind NLRP3 and a CARD domain to recruit pro-caspase-1. Proximity-induced autocatalytic activation of caspase-1 follows, which cleaves pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β and cleaves gasdermin D to enable secretion.\n\nStep 2: Define the role of ASC. ASC bridges NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1 through PYD-PYD (with NLRP3) and CARD-CARD (with pro-caspase-1) interactions, forming ASC “specks” that nucleate clustering of pro-caspase-1. This clustering is required for caspase-1 activation and subsequent proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β.\n\nStep 3: Predict the effect of ASC loss-of-function. \n- Priming remains intact because ASC is not required for NF-κB–dependent transcription of pro-IL-1β or NLRP3; thus pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 can still be synthesized.\n- NLRP3 can still sense activation signals and oligomerize; ASC is downstream of this step.\n- Without functional ASC, pro-caspase-1 cannot be efficiently recruited to the complex, preventing its activation.\n- Consequently, pro-IL-1β is not cleaved to mature IL-1β, and gasdermin D is not cleaved, impairing secretion as well.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A is incorrect: Priming and transcription of pro-IL-1β do not require ASC.\n- B is correct: Loss of ASC prevents recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1, thereby preventing cleavage of pro-IL-1β.\n- C is incorrect: NLRP3 oligomerization is upstream of ASC function and can occur without ASC.\n- D is incorrect: Mature IL-1β is not produced in the absence of caspase-1 activation; ASC is not a secretion factor per se, and secretion depends on gasdermin D pores generated by caspase-1 activity, which is absent here.\n\nTherefore, the direct outcome of the ASC mutation is failure to recruit and activate pro-caspase-1, preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255144"}, {"introduction": "During an infection, the innate immune system often deploys multiple surveillance strategies simultaneously. This capstone problem [@problem_id:2255153] places you in the role of an experimental immunologist analyzing hypothetical data from a study on *Listeria monocytogenes* infection. By carefully interpreting results from various genetically modified cells and specific inhibitor treatments, you will learn how to dissect a complex biological response and distinguish the contributions of different inflammasome pathways, such as those initiated by the NLRP3 and AIM2 sensors.", "problem": "A research group is investigating the innate immune response to the intracellular bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes*. They hypothesize that this pathogen triggers multiple inflammasome pathways inside the host cell. The inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that, upon activation, cleaves pro-Interleukin-1 beta (pro-IL-1β) into its mature, secreted form, IL-1β.\n\nTo test their hypothesis, the researchers use bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from four different lines of mice: Wild-Type (WT), mice lacking the sensor protein NLRP3 (NLRP3-/-), mice lacking the sensor protein AIM2 (AIM2-/-), and mice lacking the effector proteases Caspase-1 and Caspase-11 (Casp1/11-/-). All BMDMs are first primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to ensure they express pro-IL-1β.\n\nThe cells are then infected with *L. monocytogenes*. A subset of the experiments is conducted in media containing a high concentration of extracellular potassium chloride (KCl), which is known to prevent the potassium ($K^+$) efflux from the cell that serves as a key activation signal for the NLRP3 inflammasome. After 6 hours of infection, the concentration of mature IL-1β in the cell culture supernatant is measured. The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Cell Line     | Treatment Condition               | IL-1β Concentration (pg/mL) |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| WT            | Uninfected                        | 5                           |\n| WT            | *L. monocytogenes* Infection      | 1000                        |\n| WT            | *L. monocytogenes* + High KCl     | 400                         |\n| NLRP3-/-      | Uninfected                        | 4                           |\n| NLRP3-/-      | *L. monocytogenes* Infection      | 410                         |\n| AIM2-/-       | Uninfected                        | 6                           |\n| AIM2-/-       | *L. monocytogenes* Infection      | 620                         |\n| Casp1/11-/-   | Uninfected                        | 5                           |\n| Casp1/11-/-   | *L. monocytogenes* Infection      | 10                          |\n\nBased on the data provided, which of the following statements represents the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. *L. monocytogenes* exclusively activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, and this activation is entirely dependent on potassium efflux.\n\nB. *L. monocytogenes* exclusively activates the AIM2 inflammasome via a mechanism that is independent of potassium efflux.\n\nC. *L. monocytogenes* activates both the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. The AIM2 pathway is independent of potassium efflux, while the NLRP3 pathway is largely dependent on it.\n\nD. Inflammasome activation by *L. monocytogenes* is independent of Caspase-1/11 but requires both NLRP3 and AIM2 to function co-dependently.\n\nE. High extracellular KCl enhances inflammasome activation in response to *L. monocytogenes* by stabilizing cytosolic pathogen-derived molecules.", "solution": "The biological principle is that secretion of mature IL-1β requires inflammasome activation leading to cleavage of pro-IL-1β by caspase-1 (and caspase-11 contributes to noncanonical activation in mice). The NLRP3 inflammasome is typically activated by signals such as potassium efflux, which is inhibited by high extracellular KCl. The AIM2 inflammasome senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA and is not dependent on potassium efflux.\n\nDefine the total IL-1β measured after infection as the sum of a baseline priming output plus contributions from distinct inflammasome pathways:\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}} \\approx I_{0} + I_{\\text{NLRP3}} + I_{\\text{AIM2}}.\n$$\nUninfected controls across all genotypes are low (approximately 4 to 6 pg/mL), establishing $I_{0}$ as small.\n\nIn WT cells, infection yields $I_{\\text{total}} \\approx 1000$, whereas infection in high KCl yields approximately $400$. Since high KCl blocks potassium efflux, the reduction from approximately $1000$ to approximately $400$ indicates that a substantial $K^+$-efflux–dependent component is being suppressed. This identifies $I_{\\text{NLRP3}}$ as the $K^+$-dependent fraction.\n\nIn NLRP3-/- cells, infection yields approximately $410$, which is very close to the WT high KCl value (approximately $400$). This supports that eliminating NLRP3 genetically or blocking its activation by high KCl produces the same residual IL-1β, attributable to a $K^+$-independent pathway, consistent with AIM2. Thus, $I_{\\text{AIM2}} \\approx 400$.\n\nIn AIM2-/- cells, infection yields approximately $620$, which is reduced relative to WT but higher than the NLRP3-/- residual. This implies a significant NLRP3-dependent contribution remains. Comparing values suggests $I_{\\text{NLRP3}} \\approx 600$ and $I_{\\text{AIM2}} \\approx 400$, consistent with the WT total near $1000$ and the WT high KCl value near $400$ reflecting loss of the NLRP3 component.\n\nIn Casp1/11-/- cells, infection yields approximately $10$, near baseline, demonstrating that maturation and secretion of IL-1β is largely abolished without caspase-1/11. Therefore, inflammasome-dependent IL-1β release requires caspase-1/11 activity.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because high KCl does not abolish IL-1β (approximately $400$ remains), and NLRP3-/- still produces IL-1β, indicating an additional pathway.\n- B is false because AIM2-/- still produces a large amount (approximately $620$), indicating an NLRP3 contribution; furthermore, high KCl suppresses a major fraction, indicating $K^+$-dependence for part of the response.\n- C is supported: both NLRP3 and AIM2 contribute; the NLRP3 arm is largely $K^+$-efflux dependent, while the AIM2 arm is independent of $K^+$ efflux.\n- D is false because Casp1/11-/- nearly abolishes IL-1β, showing dependence on caspase-1/11.\n- E is false because high KCl decreases, not enhances, IL-1β.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion is that both NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes are activated by Listeria monocytogenes; the AIM2 pathway is $K^+$-independent, while the NLRP3 pathway is largely $K^+$-dependent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2255153"}]}
