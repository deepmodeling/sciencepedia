They are single-pass membrane-spanning receptors usually expressed on sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Structurally, a typical TLR consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular signaling domain known as the Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domain. The extracellular domain is responsible for recognizing specific Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), while the intracellular TIR domain is responsible for initiating a signaling cascade by recruiting specific adaptor proteins.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, consider two specific TLRs:\n-   **TLR3**: Recognizes viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and exclusively recruits the adaptor protein TRIF to its TIR domain to initiate signaling.\n-   **TLR4**: Recognizes bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Its TIR domain is capable of recruiting the adaptor protein MyD88.\n\nA research team constructs a synthetic chimeric receptor by fusing the extracellular ligand-binding domain of TLR4 to the intracellular TIR signaling domain of TLR3.

However, the patient's immune system appears to control infections with flagellated Gram-negative bacteria, like *Salmonella enterica*, effectively.\n\nTo probe the patient's innate immune response, macrophages are isolated and cultured. These cells are then exposed to purified molecular components derived from different bacteria. The activation of the macrophages is quantified by measuring their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The experiment yields the following results:\n\n1.  When the patient's macrophages are exposed to purified flagellin, a primary protein component of bacterial flagella, they produce a robust amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, comparable to cells from a healthy control donor.\n2.  When the patient's macrophages are exposed to purified lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, there is a negligible production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, control cells from a healthy donor show a strong response to LTA.\n\nThese observations suggest a genetic defect in a specific Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) recognition receptor.

TLR9", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify a malfunctioning Toll-like Receptor (TLR) based on the differential response of a patient's macrophages to two distinct Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). We must analyze each experimental result to deduce the functionality of the associated signaling pathways.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the response to flagellin. The problem states that the patient's macrophages exhibit a normal, robust response when stimulated with flagellin. Flagellin is the specific PAMP recognized by Toll-like Receptor 5 (TLR5). A normal response indicates that TLR5, as well as its downstream signaling machinery, is intact and functional in the patient's cells. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that TLR5 is not the defective receptor. This eliminates option D.\n\nNext, let's analyze the response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The problem states that the patient's macrophages show a negligible response to LTA, while control cells respond strongly. This indicates a defect in the signaling pathway responsible for recognizing LTA. LTA is a characteristic PAMP found in the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. The primary receptor for LTA is Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2), which often functions as a heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize various bacterial cell wall components. The failure to respond to LTA strongly implicates a loss of function in TLR2. This aligns perfectly with the clinical observation that the patient is particularly susceptible to Gram-positive bacterial infections. Thus, option A is the most likely correct answer.\n\nTo ensure our conclusion is sound, let's evaluate the other options.\n- Option B, TLR3, is an endosomal receptor that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common PAMP associated with viral replication. A defect in TLR3 would not explain the lack of response to LTA, a bacterial component.\n- Option C, TLR4, is the canonical receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. A defect in TLR4 would primarily affect the response to Gram-negative bacteria. The patient's ability to control infections by Gram-negative *Salmonella* suggests that the TLR4 pathway is likely functional. Furthermore, a TLR4 defect would not account for the specific failure to recognize LTA.\n- Option E, TLR9, is another endosomal receptor that recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs found in bacterial and viral DNA. A defect here is unrelated to the cell surface recognition of LTA or flagellin.\n\nIn summary, the normal response to flagellin confirms TLR5 is functional. The absent response to LTA confirms that the TLR2-mediated pathway is non-functional. Therefore, the most likely non-functional receptor in the patient is TLR2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2281194"}, {"introduction": "The signaling capacity of TLRs is not always a simple, linear chain of events, as exemplified by the unique bifurcated pathway of TLR4. This exercise challenges you to decipher experimental results where one branch of the TLR4 pathway is active while the other is silent. Successfully interpreting this data is crucial for understanding how the innate immune system can fine-tune its response by engaging different adaptor proteins to produce distinct functional outcomes [@problem_id:2281250].", "problem": "A clinical immunologist is investigating a patient with a suspected primary immunodeficiency. The patient's macrophages are isolated and stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Laboratory analysis reveals that following LPS stimulation, the macrophages successfully produce and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). However, the same cells show a complete failure to produce type I interferons (e.g., IFN-β).\n\nThe receptor for LPS is Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), which is unique in its ability to initiate two distinct downstream signaling pathways. One pathway, known as the MyD88-dependent pathway, primarily drives the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The second pathway, known as the TRIF-dependent (or MyD88-independent) pathway, is primarily responsible for the production of type I interferons. Based on the experimental observations, which of the following intracellular adaptor proteins is most likely functionally deficient in this patient?\n\nA. MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response 88)\n\nB. MAL (MyD88-adapter-like)\n\nC. TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β)\n\nD. TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule)", "solution": "First, identify the receptor and its bifurcated signaling. LPS engages TLR4, which uniquely signals via two distinct intracellular pathways: a MyD88-dependent pathway driving pro-inflammatory cytokines, and a TRIF-dependent pathway driving type I interferons.\n\nSecond, map pathway outputs to readouts. The MyD88-dependent pathway (requiring MyD88 and the bridging adaptor MAL, also called TIRAP) activates NF-κB and AP-1, resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. The TRIF-dependent pathway (engaged by TRIF with the bridging adaptor TRAM for TLR4) activates IRF3 and IRF7, leading to transcription of type I interferons such as IFN-β.\n\nThird, interpret the experimental observations. The macrophages produce TNF-α and IL-6 normally after LPS, indicating that the MyD88-dependent arm is intact. They fail to produce type I interferons, indicating a defect restricted to the TRIF-dependent arm.\n\nFourth, align adaptor proteins with each pathway. \n- MyD88 and MAL are required for the MyD88-dependent pathway; intact pro-inflammatory cytokine production excludes deficiencies in MyD88 (option A) and MAL (option B).\n- The TRIF-dependent pathway requires TRIF and, specifically for TLR4, the bridging adaptor TRAM to recruit TRIF. A defect in this pathway would be explained by deficiency of TRIF (option C) or TRAM (option D).\n\nFifth, determine the most likely deficient adaptor based on the pathway responsible for type I interferons. The central adaptor that induces type I interferon signaling is TRIF; deficiency of TRIF abolishes the MyD88-independent, interferon-inducing pathway downstream of TLR4 while leaving the MyD88-dependent pathway intact, precisely matching the observed phenotype. Therefore, the most likely functionally deficient adaptor is TRIF.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2281250"}]}
