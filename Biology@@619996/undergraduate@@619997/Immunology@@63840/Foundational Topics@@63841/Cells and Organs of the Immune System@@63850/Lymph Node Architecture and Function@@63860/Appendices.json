For an adaptive immune response to begin, naive T cells circulating in the blood must first gain entry into the lymph node to screen for signs of infection. This exercise [@problem_id:2246252] uses a hypothetical scenario to probe the function of the specialized \"gates\"—the high endothelial venules (HEVs)—and challenges you to predict the immediate consequences if this crucial entry point is blocked.", "problem": "A hypothetical, newly discovered virus exhibits a unique and highly specific tropism. It selectively infects and rapidly destroys the specialized cuboidal endothelial cells that form the High Endothelial Venules (HEVs) within the secondary lymphoid organs of its host, particularly the lymph nodes. Consider a scenario where a patient is infected with this virus, leading to widespread destruction of their HEVs. Shortly thereafter, the patient sustains a minor skin laceration that introduces a common strain of bacteria into the dermal tissue. What would be the most immediate and primary consequence of the viral infection on the patient's ability to initiate a T-cell mediated adaptive immune response against this new bacterial pathogen in the draining lymph node?\n\nA. Antigens derived from the bacteria will be unable to reach the draining lymph node for processing.\nB. Naive T-lymphocytes circulating in the bloodstream will be unable to enter the draining lymph node.\nC. Dendritic cells that have captured bacterial antigens will be unable to migrate from the skin to the draining lymph node.\nD. Activated T-lymphocytes will be unable to exit the lymph node to travel to the site of the bacterial infection.\nE. Memory T-lymphocytes residing within the lymph node will be unable to recognize the bacterial antigens.", "solution": "High endothelial venules (HEVs) are specialized postcapillary venules lined by cuboidal endothelial cells in the paracortex of lymph nodes. Their essential function is to mediate the entry of circulating naive lymphocytes from the blood into the lymph node. This homing depends on L-selectin on naive T cells binding to addressins (such as PNAd and GlyCAM-1) on HEV endothelium and chemokine signaling via CCR7 responding to CCL19 and CCL21, leading to diapedesis into the T-cell zone where dendritic cells present antigen.\n\nIf a virus selectively destroys HEV endothelial cells, the primary and immediate consequence is the loss of the dominant route by which naive T-lymphocytes enter lymph nodes from the bloodstream. Without HEVs, naive T cells cannot efficiently enter the draining lymph node paracortex to encounter antigen-presenting dendritic cells, thereby preventing initiation of a primary T-cell response.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because bacterial antigens and antigen-bearing dendritic cells reach the draining lymph node via afferent lymphatic vessels, independent of HEVs.\n- Option B is correct because destruction of HEVs prevents circulating naive T cells from homing into the lymph node.\n- Option C is incorrect because dendritic cell migration from skin to lymph node occurs through afferent lymphatics guided by CCR7 and is not dependent on HEVs.\n- Option D is incorrect because egress of activated T cells occurs via cortical sinuses into efferent lymphatics and depends on sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, not HEVs.\n- Option E is incorrect because antigen recognition by memory T cells already within the node does not require HEVs; the immediate deficit is the inability to recruit naive T cells.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary consequence is that naive T-lymphocytes circulating in the bloodstream will be unable to enter the draining lymph node.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2246252"}, {"introduction": "While naive T cells enter lymph nodes from the blood, the antigens they screen for arrive from a different direction—the site of infection. This journey is undertaken by dendritic cells (DCs), which act as messengers. This practice [@problem_id:2246263] explores the critical role of chemokine signaling in guiding these antigen-loaded DCs to the correct lymph node compartment, demonstrating that a successful immune response depends on cells not only being present but also being in the right place at the right time.", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial and viral infections. A detailed immunological workup reveals that while the patient's immune cells are present in normal numbers, their function is compromised. Specifically, laboratory tests show that upon capturing an antigen in a peripheral tissue like the skin, the patient's dendritic cells (DCs) mature correctly by processing the antigen and upregulating co-stimulatory molecules like B7 (CD80/86). However, they exhibit a complete failure to upregulate Chemokine (C-C motif) Receptor 7 (CCR7). The patient's naive T cells and all other immune cells show normal expression and function of their respective surface receptors, including CCR7 on naive T cells.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary reason for the failure to initiate an adaptive T cell response in this patient?\n\nA. Naive T cells will be unable to enter the lymph nodes from the bloodstream, as their own CCR7-mediated entry is co-dependent on signals from migrating dendritic cells.\nB. Mature, antigen-loaded dendritic cells will be trapped in the peripheral tissues, preventing them from reaching the T cell zones of draining lymph nodes to activate naive T cells.\nC. Dendritic cells will successfully migrate to the lymph nodes but will be unable to form a stable immunological synapse with T cells because CCR7 is a required co-receptor for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling.\nD. B cells will be prematurely and non-specifically activated in the peripheral tissue by the trapped dendritic cells, leading to an ineffective humoral response that competitively inhibits T cell activation.\nE. The dendritic cells, upon failing to receive a migration signal, will rapidly undergo apoptosis in the peripheral tissue, preventing any possibility of antigen presentation.", "solution": "We identify the key immunologic processes required to initiate a naive T cell response:\n1) Peripheral dendritic cells (DCs) capture antigen, mature by upregulating MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules such as B7 (CD80/86), and acquire migratory capacity by upregulating CCR7.\n2) CCR7 on mature DCs binds the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 produced by lymphatic endothelium and stromal cells in secondary lymphoid organs. This CCR7-CCL19/CCL21 axis directs DC chemotaxis from peripheral tissues into afferent lymphatics and into the T cell zones (paracortex) of draining lymph nodes.\n3) Naive T cells home to lymph nodes from the blood via high endothelial venules using CD62L (L-selectin) and CCR7, which senses the same ligands CCL19 and CCL21 displayed in the T cell zones. This process is intrinsic to naive T cells and does not require co-dependent signals from DCs for entry.\n4) Productive T cell priming requires colocalization in the T cell zone of antigen-bearing DCs and naive T cells, followed by stable immunological synapse formation mediated by TCR-peptide-MHC interactions, adhesion molecules (for example, LFA-1/ICAM-1), and co-stimulation (for example, B7 binding CD28). CCR7 is not a co-receptor for TCR signaling; it is a chemokine receptor governing cell trafficking.\n\nGiven the scenario: the patient’s DCs mature appropriately with antigen processing and B7 upregulation but fail to upregulate CCR7. Therefore:\n- The DCs cannot sense CCL19 and CCL21 gradients and consequently cannot migrate through afferent lymphatics to the draining lymph nodes’ T cell zones. They are effectively retained in peripheral tissues.\n- Naive T cells have normal CCR7 expression and thus can enter lymph nodes via high endothelial venules independently; their entry is not contingent on DC-derived signals.\n- Because antigen-bearing DCs do not reach the T cell zones, naive T cells do not encounter their cognate antigen presented with appropriate co-stimulation, so the adaptive T cell response fails to initiate.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because naive T cell homing to lymph nodes via CCR7 and CD62L is independent of migrating DCs.\n- B is correct because lack of CCR7 on DCs prevents their chemokine-guided migration to T cell zones, blocking T cell priming.\n- C is incorrect because CCR7 is not required for immunological synapse formation; synapse stability depends on TCR-peptide-MHC, adhesion molecules, and co-stimulation.\n- D is incorrect because DCs do not nonspecifically and prematurely activate B cells in peripheral tissues in a manner that would competitively inhibit T cell activation.\n- E is incorrect because failure to upregulate CCR7 does not intrinsically trigger rapid apoptosis; the primary defect is migratory failure, not obligatory cell death.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason for failure to initiate an adaptive T cell response is that mature, antigen-loaded DCs are trapped in peripheral tissues and cannot reach the T cell zones of draining lymph nodes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2246263"}, {"introduction": "After initial activation, the lymph node hosts a remarkable process of antibody refinement within specialized structures called germinal centers. This is where B cells \"evolve\" to produce antibodies with progressively higher affinity for their target. This exercise [@problem_id:2246233] investigates a crucial step in this process: the selection of the best B cells, which depends on their interaction with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Understanding this interaction reveals the quality-control mechanism that forges our most powerful antibody responses.", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic immunodeficiency. Clinical observations show that following an infection or vaccination, the patient can mount an initial antibody response, and lymph node biopsies confirm the formation of morphologically normal germinal centers. However, the patient fails to produce high-affinity antibodies and memory B cells, leading to a poor secondary immune response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. Molecular analysis pinpoints the defect: a mutation in a gene expressed only in Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) that prevents them from trapping and displaying antigen-immune complexes on their surfaces. The processes of B cell proliferation and somatic hypermutation within the germinal center dark zone are found to be unaffected.\n\nGiven this specific cellular defect, what is the most immediate fate of the germinal center B cells (centrocytes) as they migrate into the light zone?\n\nA. The majority of centrocytes will undergo apoptosis due to a failure of positive selection.\nB. The centrocytes will successfully differentiate into plasma cells but will only secrete low-affinity IgM.\nC. The centrocytes will be unable to present antigen to follicular helper T cells, but will still receive sufficient survival signals to differentiate into memory cells.\nD. The centrocytes will revert to a proliferative state in the dark zone, leading to uncontrolled clonal expansion.\nE. The centrocytes will fail to undergo class-switch recombination, trapping them in an IgM-expressing state before they undergo apoptosis.", "solution": "In the normal germinal center reaction, antigen-activated B cells proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation in the dark zone, generating centroblasts that become centrocytes as they migrate to the light zone. In the light zone, positive selection requires that centrocytes:\n1) acquire intact antigen from Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) via their B cell receptor,\n2) internalize and process this antigen,\n3) present derived peptides on MHC class II to follicular helper T cells (Tfh),\n4) receive survival and differentiation signals (notably CD40L-CD40 signaling and cytokines) from Tfh.\n\nThese signals select higher-affinity clones for survival, class-switch recombination, reentry into the dark zone, or differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells. Cells that fail to capture antigen from FDCs cannot present to Tfh and therefore do not receive CD40 and cytokine-mediated survival signals; they undergo apoptosis (death by neglect) in the light zone.\n\nIn the presented case, the mutation confined to FDCs prevents trapping and display of antigen-immune complexes. Although the dark zone processes of proliferation and somatic hypermutation are intact, centrocytes entering the light zone cannot acquire antigen because FDCs fail to present it. Consequently, these B cells cannot present peptide-MHC II to Tfh and cannot receive the essential survival signals needed for positive selection. The most immediate fate of the majority of centrocytes is therefore apoptosis.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is correct: failure of FDC antigen display abrogates positive selection, leading to apoptosis of most centrocytes.\n- B is incorrect: differentiation into plasma cells requires successful positive selection and Tfh help; without antigen acquisition and Tfh signals, differentiation does not proceed.\n- C is incorrect: survival signals from Tfh depend on antigen presentation by B cells; without it, survival signals are not delivered.\n- D is incorrect: reentry into the dark zone requires successful positive selection and Tfh-derived cues; uncontrolled clonal expansion does not occur.\n- E is incorrect as the primary immediate consequence. While class-switch recombination requires CD40 signaling (which would indeed be impaired), the immediate outcome in the light zone under these conditions is apoptosis due to failed positive selection, not persistence in an IgM state prior to differentiation.\n\nThus, the most immediate fate is apoptosis of the centrocytes due to failure of positive selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2246233"}]}
