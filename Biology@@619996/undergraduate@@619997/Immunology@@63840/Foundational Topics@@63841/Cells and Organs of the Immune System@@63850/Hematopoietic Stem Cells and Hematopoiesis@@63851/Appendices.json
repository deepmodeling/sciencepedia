The key functional readouts are: first, short-term reconstitution of all major blood lineages (erythroid, granulocytic/myeloid, and lymphoid), and second, failure to sustain hematopoiesis over several months, with progressive pancytopenia. These observations allow inference of two fundamental properties of the transplanted population: lineage potential and self-renewal capacity.\n\nShort-term multilineage reconstitution indicates that the transplanted cell population is multipotent, capable of generating myeloid/erythroid and lymphoid lineages. Thus, any lineage-restricted progenitor (lymphoid-only or myeloid-only) is incompatible with the early observation of all lineages. Therefore, a Common Lymphoid Progenitor (CLP) or Pre-B cell would not generate erythrocytes or granulocytes, and a Common Myeloid Progenitor (CMP) would not generate lymphocytes; these options do not match the initial tri-lineage reconstitution.\n\nLong-term failure indicates absence of durable self-renewal. By definition, Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) possess both multipotency and long-term self-renewal, and thus would maintain blood formation indefinitely after transplantation. Therefore, HSCs are inconsistent with the observed late decline.\n\nMultipotent Progenitors (MPPs) are downstream of HSCs; they retain multipotency sufficient for short-term tri-lineage reconstitution but lack long-term self-renewal, leading to eventual exhaustion and hematopoietic failure over months. This precisely matches the described pattern.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A. HSC: multipotent with long-term self-renewal; would sustain long-term reconstitution; eliminated.\n- B. MPP: multipotent without durable self-renewal; fits both early tri-lineage reconstitution and late failure; selected.\n- C.

A competitive repopulation assay is performed.\n\nTwo groups of lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1 congenic background) are used. Lethal irradiation ablates the host's native hematopoietic system. The CD45.1 protein serves as a genetic marker.\n\nIn both groups, each recipient mouse is injected with a baseline competitor dose of 200,000 total bone marrow cells from a young (8-week-old), healthy CD45.1+ mouse.\n\n- **Group 1 (Young Donor Test):** Each recipient also receives 200,000 total bone marrow cells from a young (8-week-old) donor mouse expressing the CD45.2 marker.\n- **Group 2 (Aged Donor Test):** Each recipient also receives 200,000 total bone marrow cells from an aged (24-month-old) donor mouse expressing the CD45.2 marker.\n\nAfter 16 weeks, a time point sufficient for long-term HSC engraftment and differentiation, peripheral blood is collected from the recipient mice.

The averaged results are presented below:\n\n| Lineage | % of Cells that are CD45.2+ (from Young Donor) | % of Cells that are CD45.2+ (from Aged Donor) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Total PBMCs | 48.5% | 12.1% |\n| B-cells | 51.0% | 6.5% |\n| T-cells | 49.2% | 7.1% |\n| Myeloid cells | 45.3% | 25.8% |\n\nBased on these data, select all of the following statements that represent a valid conclusion.\n\nA. The experiment indicates that HSCs from the aged donor have a significantly reduced long-term competitive repopulation capacity compared to those from the young donor.\n\nB. The data suggests that aged HSCs demonstrate a lineage bias, preferentially differentiating into myeloid cells at the expense of lymphoid lineages (B- and T-cells).\n\nC. Aged HSCs completely lose their ability to contribute to the lymphoid lineages.\n\nD. The reduced contribution of aged HSCs is solely due to an inability to produce B-cells and T-cells, while their myeloid output remains normal.\n\nE. The equal initial mixture of 200,000 cells from each source proves that the number of functional HSCs in the bone marrow of young and aged mice is identical at the start of the experiment.", "solution": "The goal is to interpret the results of a competitive repopulation assay comparing HSCs from young and aged donors. We must evaluate each statement (A-E) based on the provided data table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the experimental design. A competitive repopulation assay measures the functional ability of a test HSC population (CD45.2+) to reconstitute a hematopoietic system relative to a standard competitor population (CD45.1+). Because the initial mixture of total bone marrow cells was 1:1 (200,000 test cells vs. 200,000 competitor cells), a test population with equal fitness to the competitor should contribute approximately 50% of the cells in the blood after 16 weeks.\n\n**Analysis of Statement A:**\nThis statement claims that aged HSCs have reduced long-term competitive repopulation capacity. We can assess this by looking at the \"Total PBMCs\" row, which reflects the overall contribution of the donor HSCs to the entire blood system. For the young donor, the contribution is 48.5%, which is very close to the expected 50% for an equally fit competitor. This establishes a benchmark. For the aged donor, the contribution is only 12.1%. This value is drastically lower than the 48.5% from the young donor. A reduced overall contribution after 16 weeks (a long-term time point) is the primary indicator of diminished self-renewal and/or repopulation ability of the HSC pool. Therefore, statement A is a valid conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B:**\nThis statement claims that aged HSCs exhibit a myeloid lineage bias. To evaluate this, we must compare the relative contribution to different lineages *within* the population of cells derived from the aged donor. For the young donor, the contributions to B-cells (51.0%), T-cells (49.2%), and Myeloid cells (45.3%) are all balanced and near the 50% mark. This indicates balanced, multi-lineage differentiation. For the aged donor, the contribution to B-cells is 6.5% and to T-cells is 7.1%, while the contribution to Myeloid cells is 25.8%. Although the absolute contribution to all lineages is reduced, the contribution to the myeloid lineage (25.8%) is significantly higher than the contribution to the lymphoid lineages (B-cells and T-cells). This disproportionate output demonstrates a skewing of differentiation potential towards the myeloid lineage at the expense of the lymphoid lineages. Therefore, statement B is a valid conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C:**\nThis statement claims that aged HSCs *completely lose* their ability to contribute to lymphoid lineages. The data shows that the contribution from the aged donor to B-cells is 6.5% and to T-cells is 7.1%. While these values are very low, they are not zero. The term \"completely lose\" is an absolute claim that is contradicted by the data. Therefore, statement C is invalid.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D:**\nThis statement makes two claims: that the reduced contribution is *solely* due to a lymphoid defect, and that myeloid output *remains normal*. Both claims are false. First, the term \"solely\" is incorrect; while the lymphoid defect is severe, the myeloid output is also reduced. The myeloid contribution from the aged donor is 25.8%, which is substantially lower than the \"normal\" benchmark of 45.3% set by the young donor. Thus, myeloid output does not \"remain normal.\" Therefore, statement D is invalid.\n\n**Analysis of Statement E:**\nThis statement claims that the equal starting cell numbers (200,000) prove that the number of functional HSCs was initially identical. This confuses the number of *total bone marrow cells* with the number of *functional HSCs*. HSCs are a very rare population within the bone marrow. The entire point of the competitive repopulation assay is to functionally test the potency and frequency of HSCs *within* the injected cell mixture. The results—a much lower repopulation from the aged marrow—strongly suggest that the initial 200,000 cells from the aged donor contained either fewer functional HSCs or HSCs with inferior self-renewal/differentiation potential compared to the 200,000 cells from the young donor. The premise of the statement is a fundamental misunderstanding of the assay. Therefore, statement E is invalid.\n\nIn summary, only statements A and B are correct interpretations supported by the experimental data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2233342"}]}
