{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our exploration of thymic function, we start with the most fundamental requirement for a developing T-cell: the successful construction of its T-cell Receptor (TCR). This first exercise uses a classic thought experiment involving a genetically engineered mouse to probe the consequences of a failure in this initial step. By determining the precise stage at which development halts, you will gain a clear understanding of the critical role of RAG-mediated gene rearrangement as the entry ticket to the entire T-cell selection process [@problem_id:2280418].", "problem": "In the field of immunology, researchers often use knockout mouse models to study the function of specific genes. Consider a genetically engineered mouse strain that lacks a functional copy of the Recombination-Activating Gene 1 (RAG-1). The RAG-1 enzyme is a critical component of the machinery that mediates the rearrangement of gene segments to form functional antigen receptors. Thymocytes, which are developing T cells, mature in the thymus through several distinct stages defined by the expression of cell surface markers like CD4 and CD8: first a Double-Negative (DN) stage (CD4-CD8-), then a Double-Positive (DP) stage (CD4+CD8+), and finally a Single-Positive (SP) stage (either CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+). The DN stage itself is further subdivided into four stages (DN1 through DN4).\n\nGiven that T cell development is critically dependent on the successful expression of a T-cell Receptor (TCR), at which of the following stages would thymocyte maturation be most profoundly arrested in this RAG-1 deficient mouse?\n\nA. DN1 stage (CD4-CD8-, c-Kit+, CD44+, CD25-)\n\nB. DN3 stage (CD4-CD8-, c-Kit-, CD44-, CD25+)\n\nC. DP stage (CD4+CD8+)\n\nD. SP stage (CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+)", "solution": "RAG-1 is required for V(D)J recombination of antigen receptor genes. In T cell development, the first critical recombination event is TCR beta chain rearrangement, which occurs at the DN3 stage. Successful TCR beta rearrangement allows assembly of the pre-TCR (TCR beta paired with the invariant pre-T alpha chain), delivering the beta-selection signal. This signal drives proliferation, allelic exclusion of the beta chain, downregulation of CD25, progression to DN4, and subsequent transition to the DP stage.\n\nIn the absence of functional RAG-1, TCR beta gene rearrangement cannot occur. Consequently, no pre-TCR is formed, beta-selection fails, and thymocytes undergo developmental arrest and apoptosis at the DN3 stage. Earlier DN stages (DN1 and DN2) precede recombination and can be reached without RAG-1, whereas DP and SP stages require successful passage through beta-selection. Therefore, the most profound arrest is at DN3 (CD4-CD8-, c-Kit-, CD44-, CD25+).\n\nThus, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2280418"}, {"introduction": "Once a thymocyte expresses a functional TCR, it faces its next major test in the thymic cortex: positive selection. This process ensures that T-cells can recognize the body's own Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, a skill essential for their future function. This practice challenges you to diagnose a hypothetical immunodeficiency related to MHC expression, helping you connect the concepts of MHC restriction, positive selection, and the critical decision that determines if a T-cell matures into a CD4+ or a CD8+ lineage [@problem_id:2280440].", "problem": "A clinical immunologist is studying a patient with a rare, congenital immunodeficiency. Genetic analysis reveals a mutation that selectively prevents the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules on the surface of cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). However, the expression of MHC Class II molecules on these cells is unaffected. All other aspects of thymocyte development, including the generation of a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire and the initial co-expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors on immature thymocytes, are normal.\n\nBased on your understanding of T-cell development in the thymus, which of the following outcomes would be the most likely description of the mature, single-positive T-cell population found circulating in this patient's peripheral blood?\n\nA. A complete absence of both mature CD4+ and mature CD8+ T-cells.\n\nB. A severe deficiency of mature CD4+ T-cells, with a normal or elevated population of mature CD8+ T-cells.\n\nC.

An abnormally high number of both mature CD4+ and mature CD8+ T-cells.", "solution": "Principles of thymocyte selection:\n1) Immature thymocytes develop as double-positive cells co-expressing CD4 and CD8. They undergo positive selection in the thymic cortex, where cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) present self-peptides on MHC molecules.\n2) Positive selection requires recognition of self-peptide bound to MHC on cTECs to deliver survival signals; failure leads to death by neglect.\n3) Lineage commitment is determined by the class of MHC recognized during positive selection: recognition of peptide–MHC class I promotes CD8 lineage, whereas recognition of peptide–MHC class II promotes CD4 lineage.\n4) Negative selection (largely in the medulla) eliminates strongly self-reactive thymocytes but does not substitute for positive selection in generating single-positive lineages.\n\nApplying the mutation:\n- The mutation selectively prevents MHC class I expression on cTECs, while MHC class II on cTECs remains intact. All other aspects of thymocyte development are normal.\n- Because positive selection for the CD8 lineage depends on TCR recognition of peptide–MHC class I on cTECs, the absence of MHC class I on cTECs prevents positive selection of CD8 T cells. Double-positive thymocytes that would otherwise become CD8 single-positive cells fail to receive survival signals and die by neglect.\n- Positive selection for the CD4 lineage remains intact because cTECs still express MHC class II, allowing normal selection and maturation of CD4 single-positive T cells.\n- Negative selection in the medulla and other thymic APCs does not rescue the lack of positive selection on cTECs; thus the deficit specifically affects CD8 T cells.\n\nPredicted peripheral T-cell phenotype:\n- Severe deficiency of mature CD8 single-positive T cells.\n- Normal population of mature CD4 single-positive T cells (since MHC class II–mediated positive selection is unaffected).\n\nEvaluation of choices:\n- A is incorrect: both lineages would be absent only if both MHC class I and II on cTECs were absent.\n- B is incorrect: this pattern would occur if MHC class II were absent on cTECs.\n- C is correct: severe deficiency of CD8 T cells with normal CD4 T cells.\n- D and E are incorrect: positive selection impairment reduces, not normalizes or increases, the affected lineage.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a severe deficiency of mature CD8 T cells with a normal population of mature CD4 T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2280440"}, {"introduction": "The journey through the thymus is a dramatic numbers game, characterized by massive proliferation followed by stringent checkpoints that eliminate the vast majority of cells. This final practice provides a quantitative model to illustrate the overall efficiency of thymopoiesis, from the initial pool of progenitors to the small fraction that ultimately graduate as mature T-cells. By calculating the final output, you will develop a powerful appreciation for the immense scale of cellular selection required to forge a competent and self-tolerant T-cell army [@problem_id:2280410].", "problem": "A quantitative model is proposed to estimate the output of mature T-cells from the thymus, starting from a cohort of progenitors. Consider a cohort of $N_0 = 5.00 \\times 10^4$ early thymic progenitors (ETPs) entering the thymus. The development process is modeled in two major stages.\n\n**Stage 1: Pre-TCR Checkpoint and Proliferation**\nThe progenitors progress to the double-negative (DN) stage of development, where they lack expression of the co-receptors CD4 and CD8. The first major checkpoint is β-selection, where successful rearrangement of the T-cell Receptor (TCR) β-chain is assessed. A fraction $S_{\\beta} = 0.33$ of these cells successfully pass this checkpoint. Immediately following successful β-selection, each surviving cell undergoes a fixed number of cell divisions, $k=7$, before differentiating into double-positive (DP) thymocytes, which co-express both CD4 and CD8.\n\n**Stage 2: Positive and Negative Selection**\nThe resulting population of DP thymocytes must now undergo selection based on their fully assembled TCR, which includes a newly rearranged α-chain. The probability that a DP cell successfully expresses a functional TCR α-chain is $S_{\\alpha} = 0.95$. Only cells with a complete TCR can be selected. Of these, a fraction $S_{pos} = 0.040$ have a TCR capable of weak binding to self-Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, thus passing positive selection. Subsequently, of those cells that pass positive selection, a fraction $S_{neg} = 0.45$ survive negative selection, meaning they do not bind too strongly to self-MHC/peptide complexes. Cells that successfully navigate this entire selection process mature into single-positive (SP) T-cells (expressing either CD4 or CD8) and exit the thymus.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the total expected number of mature T-cells that exit the thymus.
