Myeloid cells, a diverse family including monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, are distinguished by unique protein signatures on their surfaces called Cluster of Differentiation (CD) markers. This first exercise challenges you to apply this principle in a common laboratory scenario, using a specific CD marker to purify monocytes, which are crucial phagocytes and precursors to macrophages. [@problem_id:2251801]", "problem": "An immunology researcher is tasked with studying the phagocytic capabilities of monocytes from a human blood sample. To begin the experiment, a highly pure population of monocytes must be isolated from the other cells present in a sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PBMC fraction contains a mixture of cell types, primarily lymphocytes (such as T cells and B cells) and monocytes. The researcher decides to use a technique called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which involves labeling target cells with a specific antibody conjugated to a fluorescent molecule. In this procedure, which is a form of positive selection, only the cells that are successfully labeled by the fluorescent antibody will be collected. The antibodies used in this process recognize specific surface proteins known as Cluster of Differentiation (CD) markers.\n\nTo specifically isolate the monocyte population from the mixed PBMC sample, which one of the following CD markers should be targeted by the fluorescent antibody?\n\nA.

Therefore, the antibody must recognize a surface marker that is specifically and robustly expressed on monocytes.\n\nKnown lineage-specific Cluster of Differentiation markers in human PBMCs include:\n- CD3: a T-cell receptor complex component, expressed on T lymphocytes; not a monocyte marker.\n- CD19: a B-cell marker; not expressed on monocytes.\n- CD14: a co-receptor for lipopolysaccharide, characteristically expressed at high levels on classical monocytes; commonly used to identify and isolate monocytes by positive selection.\n- CD56: an NK cell marker (also known as NCAM); not a monocyte marker.\n- CD34: a stem/progenitor cell marker; not expressed on mature PBMC monocytes.\n\nFor specific isolation of monocytes by positive selection from PBMCs, the appropriate target is CD14.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2251801"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying myeloid cells, it is critical to appreciate the immense scale and dynamic nature of their production and turnover.

Dendritic cells (DCs) exemplify this role, sensing danger signals from pathogens and then migrating to lymph nodes to instruct the adaptive immune system on how to respond. This final practice explores a sophisticated scenario where a DC detects both bacterial and viral signals simultaneously, forcing you to predict how it integrates these inputs to orchestrate a tailored T-cell response. [@problem_id:2251809]", "problem": "A dendritic cell (DC), a key antigen-presenting cell of the myeloid lineage, is situated in a mucosal tissue experiencing a co-infection. It simultaneously detects a bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), via its surface Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), and a viral replication intermediate, cytosolic double-stranded RNA, via its cytosolic Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptor. The DC processes antigens from both pathogens and migrates to a draining lymph node to activate naive T helper (Th) cells.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following simplified rules for T helper cell differentiation:\n1.  Differentiation into Th1 cells, which are critical for clearing intracellular pathogens, is primarily driven by the cytokine Interleukin-12 (IL-12).\n2.  Differentiation into Th17 cells, which are crucial for combating extracellular bacteria and fungi at barrier surfaces, requires the presence of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and is stabilized and expanded by Interleukin-23 (IL-23).\n\nThe concurrent TLR4 and RIG-I signaling within the DC results in a complex transcriptional program that leads to the secretion of a specific cytokine cocktail. This cocktail is capable of inducing a mixed population of both Th1 and Th17 effector cells from the naive T cell pool.\n\nWhich of the following cytokine combinations represents the most plausible secretome from the DC that would orchestrate this specific mixed Th1/Th17 response?\n\nA.

IL-12, IL-10: IL-12 supports Th1, but IL-10 is immunoregulatory and suppresses Th1/Th17; lacks IL-6 and IL-23 for Th17. Not consistent with mixed Th1/Th17.\n  - B. IL-4, IL-5, IL-13: Canonical Th2 cytokines; do not induce Th1 or Th17. Incorrect.\n  - C. IL-12, IL-6, IL-23: Contains IL-12 for Th1 and IL-6 plus IL-23 for Th17 induction and stabilization. Matches the simplified rules and expected DC output under TLR4/RIG-I co-stimulation. Correct.\n  - D. TGF-$\\beta$, IL-10: Favors regulatory/Treg responses and suppression; lacks IL-12 and IL-23. Not compatible with mixed Th1/Th17.\n  - E. IL-6, IL-1, IFN-$\\gamma$: IL-6 and IL-1 can contribute to Th17 in the presence of TGF-$\\beta$ and IL-23, but IL-23 is missing; IFN-$\\gamma$ is typically produced by Th1/NK cells, not a primary DC secreted cytokine for priming. Not the best DC secretome for the specified outcome.\n\n- Conclusion: The only option that simultaneously provides the necessary drivers for both Th1 (IL-12) and Th17 (IL-6, IL-23) differentiation, consistent with DC biology under TLR4 and RIG-I activation, is IL-12, IL-6, IL-23.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2251809"}]}
