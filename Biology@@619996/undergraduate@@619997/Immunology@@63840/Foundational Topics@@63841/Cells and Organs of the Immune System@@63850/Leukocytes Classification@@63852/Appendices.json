A cornerstone technique in immunology, flow cytometry, allows us to do just that by measuring the physical properties of thousands of cells per second. This first practice exercise will test your ability to interpret fundamental flow cytometry data, using forward scatter ($FSC$) as a proxy for cell size and side scatter ($SSC$) for internal complexity to distinguish the three major leukocyte families: lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes [@problem_id:2245112].", "problem": "An immunology research laboratory is analyzing a prepared human peripheral blood sample from which red blood cells have been lysed. The remaining cells, primarily leukocytes, are processed through a flow cytometer. The instrument measures two key parameters for each cell: Forward Scatter Area (FSC-A), which is proportional to the cell's cross-sectional area and thus serves as a proxy for cell size, and Side Scatter Area (SSC-A), which is proportional to the cell's internal complexity factors such as granularity and nuclear lobulation.\n\nThe analysis reveals three distinct, non-overlapping cell populations, which are designated as P_alpha, P_beta, and P_gamma. The centroid coordinates for these populations on the FSC-A vs. SSC-A plot, given in arbitrary units (a.u.), are as follows:\n\n- Population P_alpha: (FSC-A = 220 a.u., SSC-A = 180 a.u.)\n- Population P_beta: (FSC-A = 480 a.u., SSC-A = 410 a.u.)\n- Population P_gamma: (FSC-A = 750 a.u., SSC-A = 820 a.u.)\n\nBased on established knowledge of the relative size and internal complexity of the three major types of leukocytes—lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes—determine the correct identity for each population.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly assigns the cell types to the observed populations?\n\nA. P_alpha = Lymphocytes, P_beta = Monocytes, P_gamma = Granulocytes\nB. P_alpha = Granulocytes, P_beta = Monocytes, P_gamma = Lymphocytes\nC.

Among major leukocyte classes, established relative properties are: lymphocytes are the smallest and least granular (lowest FSC-A and SSC-A), monocytes are larger with intermediate complexity (intermediate FSC-A and SSC-A), and granulocytes are the largest and most granular (highest FSC-A and SSC-A).\n\nThe observed centroids are:\nP_alpha at $(220,180)$, P_beta at $(480,410)$, and P_gamma at $(750,820)$, where the first coordinate is FSC-A and the second is SSC-A. Ordering the FSC-A values gives $220<480<750$, and ordering the SSC-A values gives $180<410<820$. Thus, the populations increase in both size and complexity in the sequence P_alpha, P_beta, P_gamma.\n\nMatching these ordered properties to cell types:\n- P_alpha has the lowest FSC-A and SSC-A, consistent with lymphocytes.\n- P_beta has intermediate FSC-A and SSC-A, consistent with monocytes.\n- P_gamma has the highest FSC-A and SSC-A, consistent with granulocytes.\n\nTherefore, the correct assignment is P_alpha = Lymphocytes, P_beta = Monocytes, P_gamma = Granulocytes, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2245112"}, {"introduction": "Once we can distinguish the major leukocyte families, the next challenge is to isolate a specific, pure population for study. This is often accomplished by targeting unique molecular \"fingerprints\" on the cell surface known as Cluster of Differentiation (CD) markers. This practice problem simulates the design of an experiment to isolate helper T cells—a critical component of the adaptive immune response—using a technique called positive selection, challenging you to select the correct combination of CD markers to *tag* and separate your target cells from the mix [@problem_id:2245159].", "problem": "An immunologist is preparing a sample of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for an experiment on cell signaling. The experimental design requires the specific isolation of the helper T cell population, while excluding other lymphocytes like cytotoxic T cells and B cells, as well as myeloid cells like monocytes. The isolation will be performed using positive selection, where antibodies targeting specific cell surface proteins are used to identify and separate the desired cells. These surface proteins are classified using the Cluster of Differentiation (CD) nomenclature.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of CD markers must both be expressed on the surface of a cell for it to be correctly identified and isolated as a helper T cell?\n\nA.

CD4 and CD14", "solution": "The goal is to isolate helper T cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using positive selection for specific CD markers. Helper T cells are a subset of T lymphocytes defined by two key surface proteins:\n- CD3, which is expressed on all mature T cells and serves as a pan–T-cell marker.\n- CD4, which distinguishes helper T cells from cytotoxic T cells (which express CD8).\n\nEvaluate each option based on known lineage-specific markers:\n- Option A (CD3 and CD8): This combination identifies cytotoxic T cells, not helper T cells.\n- Option B (CD4 and CD8): Co-expression of CD4 and CD8 is characteristic of immature thymocytes; in peripheral blood, such double-positive T cells are rare and not specific for helper T cells.\n- Option C (CD3 and CD4): This combination identifies helper T cells specifically, as they are T lineage cells (CD3) that express the helper subset marker CD4.\n- Option D (CD19 and CD20): Both are B-cell markers and do not identify T cells.\n- Option E (CD4 and CD14): CD14 is a monocyte marker; while some monocytes can express CD4, they lack CD3, and this pair does not specify helper T cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair that must both be expressed to identify helper T cells is CD3 and CD4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2245159"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of leukocyte classification is to understand function: why does our immune system maintain so many different types of cells? This final practice exercise bridges the gap between identification and function by presenting a realistic viral immune evasion scenario. By analyzing how a virus manipulates antigen presentation on infected cells, you will need to determine which leukocyte subset, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte or a Natural Killer (NK) cell, is better equipped to recognize and eliminate the threat, highlighting their distinct and complementary roles in immunity [@problem_id:2245107].", "problem": "A virology research team is studying a novel virus that infects human hepatocytes (liver cells). They discover that a specific viral protein actively disrupts the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum. This disruption prevents endogenous peptides, including viral peptides, from being loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. Consequently, the surface expression of MHC class I on infected hepatocytes is significantly diminished.\n\nGiven this specific viral immune evasion strategy, which of the following immune cell types would be most effective at recognizing and initiating the elimination of these infected hepatocytes, and what is the fundamental reason for its effectiveness?\n\nA. B lymphocytes, because they are activated to produce antibodies that can penetrate the hepatocyte membrane and neutralize the virus.\nB. Helper T lymphocytes (CD4$^+$), because they recognize viral antigens presented by hepatocytes and secrete cytokines to recruit other cells.\nC. Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CD8$^+$ CTLs), because their T-cell receptors are highly specific and can efficiently find the few remaining peptide-MHC I complexes on the cell surface.\nD. Natural Killer (NK) cells, because the reduction of MHC class I expression on the hepatocyte surface removes a key inhibitory signal for NK cell activation.\nE. Dendritic cells, because they are professional antigen-presenting cells specialized in phagocytosing and processing virally infected cells to initiate the adaptive immune response.", "solution": "The viral protein disrupts the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), which is required to shuttle cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I. The absence of TAP-mediated peptide transport prevents proper loading of endogenous peptides onto MHC class I, resulting in unstable MHC class I molecules and a marked reduction of their surface expression on infected hepatocytes. Effector CD8$^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes require recognition of specific peptide-MHC class I complexes via the T-cell receptor to engage and kill target cells; therefore, when MHC class I is markedly reduced, CD8$^+$ T-cell recognition and killing are impaired, not facilitated. By contrast, Natural Killer (NK) cells integrate activating and inhibitory signals, where the presence of self MHC class I provides a dominant inhibitory signal through inhibitory receptors (for example, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). When MHC class I expression is downregulated (“missing self”), this inhibitory input is removed, allowing activating signals to predominate and triggering NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity against the infected hepatocytes.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because B lymphocytes produce antibodies that neutralize extracellular virus; antibodies do not penetrate the hepatocyte cytosol to eliminate intracellular virus, and antibody-mediated effects are not optimized by loss of MHC class I.\n- B is incorrect because helper T cells (CD4$^+$) recognize antigen presented on MHC class II, which hepatocytes do not constitutively express; their main role is cytokine help, not direct killing of such targets.\n- C is incorrect because CD8$^+$ CTLs require peptide-MHC class I for recognition; TAP blockade and reduced MHC class I surface expression hinder rather than enhance CTL recognition.\n- D is correct because reduced MHC class I removes a key inhibitory signal to NK cells, enabling “missing self” recognition and initiation of cytotoxicity.\n- E is incorrect because dendritic cells are critical for antigen presentation and priming of T cells but are not the primary effectors eliminating MHC class I-deficient hepatocytes.\n\nTherefore, the most effective immune cells in this scenario are NK cells, due to the loss of MHC class I-mediated inhibitory signaling, which permits NK activation and killing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2245107"}]}
