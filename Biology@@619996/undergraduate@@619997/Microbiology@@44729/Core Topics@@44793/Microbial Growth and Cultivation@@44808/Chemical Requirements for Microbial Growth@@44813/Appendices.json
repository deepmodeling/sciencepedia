This exercise challenges you to think like a microbial nutritionist, designing the simplest possible growth medium for a hypothetical archaeon with a specific dietary need—an auxotrophy for the amino acid methionine. By considering the elemental composition of each potential ingredient, you will practice the critical skill of formulating a minimal medium that is both effective and efficient, a cornerstone of microbiological research [@problem_id:2058391].", "problem": "A new species of archaeon, *Simplicatus methionivorans*, has been isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Laboratory analysis reveals it is a chemoorganoheterotroph that can utilize fructose as its sole carbon and energy source. Genomic sequencing has confirmed that it is an auxotroph for the amino acid methionine, meaning it lacks the metabolic pathway to synthesize methionine and must obtain it from its environment. The chemical formula for methionine is $C_5H_{11}NO_2S$.\n\nYour task is to design a chemically defined medium for the cultivation of this organism.

The chemically defined medium must supply the primary elemental requirements for growth (Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Sulfur) and the specific methionine requirement. Water and trace minerals are assumed present.\n\nPrinciples:\n- A chemoorganoheterotroph requires an organic carbon source for both carbon and energy; fructose $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ serves this role.\n- The medium must include a phosphorus source; a single phosphate salt such as potassium phosphate (e.g., $KH_{2}PO_{4}$ or $K_{2}HPO_{4}$) provides $P$.\n- The organism is auxotrophic for methionine, so methionine $C_{5}H_{11}NO_{2}S$ must be supplied. Methionine contains both nitrogen and sulfur (one $N$ and one $S$ atom per molecule), so it can serve as the required sources of $N$ and $S$ while also fulfilling the auxotrophic requirement.\n\nEvaluate options for minimal number of compounds while meeting all constraints:\n- A. Fructose, Potassium Phosphate, Ammonium Chloride, Sodium Sulfate: Supplies $C$, $P$, $N$, $S$ but lacks methionine; fails the auxotrophy requirement.\n- B. Fructose, Potassium Phosphate, Methionine: Fructose supplies $C$ and energy; potassium phosphate supplies $P$; methionine $C_{5}H_{11}NO_{2}S$ supplies both $N$ and $S$ and satisfies the methionine auxotrophy. This uses three compounds and covers all required elements plus the specific auxotrophy.\n- C. Fructose, Potassium Phosphate, Ammonium Sulfate, Methionine: Includes redundant $N$ and $S$ sources ($(NH_4)_2SO_4$ and methionine); not the simplest (four compounds).\n- D.

Fructose, Potassium Phosphate, Ammonium Sulfate: Lacks methionine; fails the auxotrophy requirement.\n\nConclusion: The simplest functional medium that satisfies $C$, $N$, $P$, $S$ requirements and the methionine auxotrophy uses three compounds: fructose, potassium phosphate, and methionine.

While an organism may be able to use different forms of an element like sulfur, one form might allow for much faster growth because converting a nutrient from its environmental form to a usable cellular component costs metabolic energy. This practice problem delves into the bioenergetics of nutrient assimilation, allowing you to calculate the precise energy savings, in ATP equivalents, when a bacterium is supplied with a 'pre-processed' nutrient (cysteine) versus an oxidized, energetically 'expensive' one (sulfate) [@problem_id:2058373].", "problem": "A bioengineer is tasked with optimizing a chemically defined minimal medium for the rapid cultivation of a chemotrophic bacterium. The bacterium synthesizes its own L-cysteine for protein synthesis, starting from the precursor amino acid L-serine. The engineer is considering two different sulfur sources, provided at equimolar concentrations: inorganic sulfate ($SO_4^{2-}$) and the amino acid L-cysteine.\n\nTo quantify the bioenergetic advantage of one source over the other, calculate the difference in metabolic energy expenditure for the cell. Assume the following simplified biochemical information:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (Sulfate Assimilation):** When sulfate is the source, the cell must first activate and reduce it to sulfide ($S^{2-}$) before incorporating it into L-cysteine. This process occurs in four key steps:\n    *   **Step A1:** Activation of sulfate by reaction with Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to form Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and pyrophosphate (PPi).\n        $$SO_4^{2-} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{APS} + PPi$$\n    *   **Step A2:** Further phosphorylation of APS with another ATP molecule to form 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS).\n        $$\\text{APS} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{PAPS} + \\text{ADP}$$\n    *   **Step A3:** Reduction of PAPS to sulfite ($SO_3^{2-}$), consuming two molecules of reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH).\n    *   **Step A4:** Further reduction of sulfite to sulfide ($S^{2-}$), consuming three molecules of NADPH.\n    *   Finally, the sulfide is incorporated into O-acetylserine (derived from L-serine) to form L-cysteine. This final incorporation step itself has no net ATP or NADPH cost.\n\n2.  **Pathway B (Direct Incorporation):** When L-cysteine is provided in the medium, the cell can transport it inside and use it directly for protein synthesis, bypassing the entire biosynthetic pathway from L-serine and a sulfur source. Assume the energetic cost of transporting one molecule of L-cysteine into the cell is negligible for this analysis.\n\n3.  **Bioenergetic Equivalencies:**\n    *   The hydrolysis of one molecule of PPi to two molecules of inorganic phosphate is energetically equivalent to the consumption of one molecule of ATP.\n    *   For anabolic reactions in this organism, one molecule of NADPH is considered energetically equivalent to three molecules of ATP.\n\nCalculate the net difference in the total bioenergetic cost (Cost of Pathway A minus Cost of Pathway B) for the cell to have one molecule of L-cysteine available for protein synthesis.
