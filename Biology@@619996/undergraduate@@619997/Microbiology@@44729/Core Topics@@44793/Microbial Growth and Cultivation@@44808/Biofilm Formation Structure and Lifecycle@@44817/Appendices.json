They isolate a mutant strain that exhibits an unusual behavior on a polystyrene surface in a laboratory growth medium. While wild-type *S. aureus* readily forms thick, multi-layered, and robust biofilms, this mutant strain is only able to complete the initial attachment phase, forming a sparse monolayer of cells on the catheter surface. The cells in this monolayer are viable but fail to aggregate into microcolonies or develop the characteristic three-dimensional structure of a mature biofilm.\n\nGiven the distinct stages of biofilm development—(1) initial attachment, (2) irreversible attachment and cell division to form a monolayer, (3) maturation and accumulation into a multi-layered structure via production of an extracellular matrix, and (4) dispersal—which of the following options describes the most likely molecular defect in this mutant strain?\n\nA. A mutation in the gene for a fibronectin-binding protein, preventing the initial adhesion of the bacteria to the host-protein-coated surface.\n\nB.

A loss-of-function mutation in the primary quorum sensing system, leading to a global misregulation of various cellular processes.", "solution": "We map the observed phenotype to the canonical stages of biofilm development. The mutant completes stage (1) initial attachment and reaches stage (2) by forming a sparse monolayer of viable cells, but fails to progress to stage (3) maturation with accumulation into a multi-layered, three-dimensional structure. This specifically implicates a defect in the processes required for intercellular adhesion and extracellular matrix production that drive biofilm maturation.\n\nEvaluate each option against the phenotype:\n\n- Option A (defective fibronectin-binding protein) predicts impaired initial attachment to host-protein-coated surfaces. This contradicts the observation that the mutant achieves initial attachment and forms a monolayer. Therefore, A is inconsistent.\n\n- Option B (non-functional flagella) is not applicable to Staphylococcus aureus, which is non-flagellated and non-motile. Moreover, the mutant already achieves irreversible attachment sufficient for a monolayer, so B cannot explain the failure to form multilayered biofilm.\n\n- Option C (deletion of icaA) directly disrupts the intercellular adhesion pathway central to stage (3) maturation. The icaADBC operon synthesizes Polysaccharide Intercellular Adhesin (PIA, also known as PNAG), which mediates cell-cell adhesion and accumulation into multilayered biofilm. Loss of icaA, encoding a key N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, prevents PIA production, thereby allowing initial attachment but blocking microcolony formation and 3D maturation. This matches the described phenotype precisely.\n\n- Option D (over-expression of dispersal enzymes) would be expected to promote matrix degradation and dispersal. While excessive early expression could antagonize biofilm maturation, it would more likely reduce surface retention rather than leave a stable, sparse monolayer. The phenotype described is more specifically aligned with a failure of matrix synthesis rather than premature dispersal.\n\n- Option E (loss-of-function in quorum sensing) in S. aureus, particularly agr system deficiency, typically enhances biofilm formation by reducing expression of proteases and toxins that promote dispersal. Thus, E predicts increased biofilm accumulation, which is opposite to the observed defect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular defect is a disruption of the ica-dependent PIA synthesis pathway, specifically a deletion in icaA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2055905"}, {"introduction": "Bacteria must make a crucial decision: to swim freely or to attach and settle. This lifestyle switch is often controlled by intracellular signaling molecules like cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). In this thought experiment, you will predict the physical and genetic traits of bacterial strains engineered to have different levels of c-di-GMP, demonstrating its central role in regulating motility versus sessile biofilm formation [@problem_id:2055913].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the regulatory network governing the lifestyle switch in a newly discovered bacterium, *Pseudomonas fictitium*. It is hypothesized that this switch between a free-swimming (planktonic) state and a surface-attached (sessile) biofilm state is controlled by the intracellular concentration of the second messenger Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). In this organism, a key diguanylate cyclase, DgcA, is responsible for synthesizing c-di-GMP, and a key phosphodiesterase, PdeH, is responsible for its degradation.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the researcher constructs three isogenic strains of *P. fictitium*:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):** The standard, unmodified strain with functional `dgcA` and `pdeH` genes.\n2.  **ΔdgcA mutant:** A strain with a complete deletion of the `dgcA` gene, rendering it unable to produce c-di-GMP via this primary pathway.\n3.  **ΔpdeH mutant:** A strain with a complete deletion of the `pdeH` gene, leading to the accumulation of c-di-GMP due to impaired degradation.\n\nThe researcher plans to conduct three experiments to compare the phenotypes of these strains:\n\n*   **Experiment I (Motility):** A motility assay will be performed by inoculating the center of a soft agar plate (0.3% agar) with each strain. The diameter of the circular zone of swimming bacteria will be measured after 24 hours. A larger diameter indicates greater motility.\n*   **Experiment II (Biofilm Formation):** A static biofilm assay will be conducted in a polystyrene microtiter plate. After 48 hours of growth, non-adherent cells will be washed away, and the remaining attached biofilm will be stained with crystal violet. The amount of biofilm will be quantified by measuring the absorbance of the solubilized stain at 550 nm ($A_{550}$). A higher absorbance indicates more biofilm.\n*   **Experiment III (Gene Expression):** The relative transcript levels of two genes will be measured using quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The genes are `flgK`, which encodes a crucial component of the flagellar hook, and `bapA`, which encodes a key surface adhesion protein involved in initiating biofilm formation.\n\nAssuming the c-di-GMP hypothesis is correct, which of the following options most accurately predicts the relative outcomes of these three experiments?\n\n**A.**\n*   Motility Diameter: WT > ΔdgcA > ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔpdeH > ΔdgcA > WT\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔdgcA; High `bapA` in ΔpdeH\n\n**B.**\n*   Motility Diameter: ΔpdeH > WT > ΔdgcA\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔdgcA > WT > ΔpdeH\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔpdeH; High `bapA` in ΔdgcA\n\n**C.**\n*   Motility Diameter: ΔdgcA > WT > ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔpdeH > WT > ΔdgcA\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔdgcA; High `bapA` in ΔpdeH\n\n**D.**\n*   Motility Diameter: ΔdgcA > WT > ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔpdeH > WT > ΔdgcA\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔpdeH; High `bapA` in ΔdgcA\n\n**E.**\n*   Motility Diameter: WT ≈ ΔdgcA ≈ ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): WT ≈ ΔdgcA ≈ ΔpdeH\n*   Gene Expression: Equal `flgK` and `bapA` levels in all strains", "solution": "The core regulatory principle is that intracellular cyclic-di-GMP promotes the sessile biofilm lifestyle and antagonizes the motile planktonic lifestyle. Therefore, increasing cyclic-di-GMP decreases swimming motility and increases biofilm formation, while decreasing cyclic-di-GMP does the opposite. At the gene expression level, cyclic-di-GMP typically represses flagellar gene expression and activates adhesin/biofilm gene expression. For the specific markers here, this implies that $flgK$ (flagellar hook component) expression is inversely related to cyclic-di-GMP, while $bapA$ (adhesion factor) expression is positively related to cyclic-di-GMP.\n\nDefine $[c]$ as the intracellular cyclic-di-GMP concentration. By strain construction:\n- In the $\\Delta dgcA$ mutant, synthesis via the primary cyclase is abolished, so $[c]_{\\Delta dgcA}$ is reduced relative to wild type.\n- In the wild type, both synthesis and degradation are intact, so $[c]_{WT}$ is at an intermediate baseline.\n- In the $\\Delta pdeH$ mutant, degradation is impaired, so $[c]_{\\Delta pdeH}$ is elevated.\n\nThus the ordering of intracellular cyclic-di-GMP is\n$$\n[c]_{\\Delta dgcA} < [c]_{WT} < [c]_{\\Delta pdeH}.\n$$\n\nSwimming motility diameter in soft agar is inversely related to $[c]$. Denoting motility by $M$, this gives the ordering\n$$\nM_{\\Delta dgcA} > M_{WT} > M_{\\Delta pdeH}.\n$$\n\nBiofilm formation, quantified by $A_{550}$ after crystal violet staining, is positively related to $[c]$. Denoting biofilm by $B$, this gives\n$$\nB_{\\Delta pdeH} > B_{WT} > B_{\\Delta dgcA}.\n$$\n\nFor gene expression, let $E_{flgK}$ and $E_{bapA}$ denote relative transcript levels. The inverse relationship for flagellar genes yields\n$$\nE_{flgK,\\ \\Delta dgcA} > E_{flgK,\\ WT} > E_{flgK,\\ \\Delta pdeH},\n$$\nand the positive relationship for adhesion/biofilm genes yields\n$$\nE_{bapA,\\ \\Delta pdeH} > E_{bapA,\\ WT} > E_{bapA,\\ \\Delta dgcA}.\n$$\n\nThese predictions correspond to the option stating: motility $\\Delta dgcA > WT > \\Delta pdeH$, biofilm $\\Delta pdeH > WT > \\Delta dgcA$, and high $flgK$ in $\\Delta dgcA$ with high $bapA$ in $\\Delta pdeH$.
