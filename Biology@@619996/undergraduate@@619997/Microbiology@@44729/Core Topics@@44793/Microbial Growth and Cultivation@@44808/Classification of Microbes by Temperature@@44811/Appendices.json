Hyperthermophile", "solution": "We identify the temperature-growth classification by matching the observed growth profile to standard definitions. The organism grows at refrigeration temperature $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (albeit slowly), has its maximum growth rate at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and shows no growth above $40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. \n\nBy definition, psychrophiles have optimal growth at approximately $15\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ or lower and typically do not have an optimum in the $20$ to $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ range; moreover, many psychrophiles fail to grow at temperatures near or above $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so the observed optimum at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ contradicts a psychrophile classification. Mesophiles have optima in the range $20$ to $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, but most mesophiles do not grow at $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and are not typically implicated in refrigerated food spoilage; thus, the ability to grow at $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and cause spoilage argues against a simple mesophile classification. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles require higher optimum temperatures, typically $>45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $>80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ respectively, which are incompatible with the observed lack of growth above $40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. \n\nPsychrotrophs (psychrotolerant organisms) are defined by their ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures (near $0$ to $7\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), while having an optimum in the mesophilic range, commonly around $20$ to $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and often an upper limit near $35$ to $40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.

The observed profile—growth at $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, maximal growth at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and no growth above $40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$—matches the psychrotroph definition most specifically and accurately.

For temperatures below the optimum ($T < T_{opt}$), the model is given by $\\sqrt{k} = b(T - T_{min})$, where $T_{min}$ is the theoretical minimum temperature for growth and $b$ is a constant.
