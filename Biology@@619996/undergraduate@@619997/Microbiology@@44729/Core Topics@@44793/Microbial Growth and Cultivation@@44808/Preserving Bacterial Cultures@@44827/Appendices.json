Before you can proceed with any experiment, you must perform a critical quality control check to ensure the culture is pure and free from contaminants.

They are provided with a cryovial containing a frozen glycerol stock labeled with the organism's name. The student thaws the vial and inoculates a tube of sterile nutrient broth. After overnight incubation, the broth becomes visibly turbid, indicating successful revival and growth. Before using this liquid culture for their experiment, a critical first step is to perform a simple and rapid verification to assess its purity, ensuring it has not been contaminated by other microorganisms.\n\nWhich of the following procedures is the most appropriate and direct initial test to assess the purity of the revived culture?\n\nA. Perform a coagulase test by mixing a sample of the culture with rabbit plasma.\n\nB. Extract deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the culture and sequence the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene.\n\nC. Prepare a smear from the culture, perform a Gram stain, and observe it under a microscope.\n\nD. Test the culture's antibiotic susceptibility profile using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method on an agar plate.\n\nE. Streak a loopful of the culture onto a Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) plate and incubate it for 24-48 hours.", "solution": "Objective: Select the most appropriate and direct initial test to rapidly assess purity of a revived bacterial culture.\n\nLogical criteria:\n- The test must be simple and rapid.\n- It must directly assess purity, i.e., reveal whether more than one organism or morphology is present.\n- It should precede more time-consuming confirmatory or identification procedures.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A (coagulase test) primarily assesses a phenotypic trait for identification of Staphylococcus aureus. A mixed culture containing S. aureus and contaminants can still yield a positive coagulase result, so it does not directly assess purity and is not the most appropriate initial check.\n- Option B (16S rRNA gene sequencing) is definitive for identification but is not simple or rapid for routine initial purity checks. It may not reliably detect mixed populations without additional methods and is not suitable as a first-line test.\n- Option C (Gram stain from the broth) is simple, rapid, and directly informative about purity. Observation of a single, consistent Gram reaction and morphology (e.g., Gram-positive cocci in clusters for Staphylococcus aureus) supports purity, whereas detection of mixed morphologies or different Gram reactions indicates contamination. This is the most direct and rapid initial check before proceeding.\n- Option D (Kirby-Bauer antibiotic susceptibility) is time-consuming, requires pure culture for valid interpretation, and does not directly assess purity as an initial step.\n- Option E (streak onto MSA) is a standard approach to obtain isolated colonies and assess purity on solid medium, but it requires incubation for 24–48 hours and uses a selective medium that could mask non-staphylococcal contaminants. It is less rapid than a Gram stain and therefore not the most appropriate initial test for quick verification.\n\nConclusion: The most appropriate and direct initial rapid purity assessment is to perform a Gram stain of the culture and examine cell morphology and Gram reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2087286"}, {"introduction": "Cryoprotectants like glycerol are essential for protecting cells from damage during freezing, but their use is a delicate balancing act. This thought experiment explores the critical importance of concentration by examining what happens when a protocol is not followed correctly. By predicting the immediate physiological effect of extreme osmotic shock on *Escherichia coli*, you will gain a deeper understanding of why using precise concentrations is vital for cell survival. [@problem_id:2087305]", "problem": "A student is tasked with preparing a bacterial stock of *Escherichia coli* for long-term storage at -80°C. The standard laboratory protocol involves mixing the liquid bacterial culture with a sterile cryoprotectant solution to achieve a final concentration of 15% (v/v) glycerol before freezing. In a moment of confusion, the student deviates from the protocol. They take 1.0 mL of the dense *E. coli* liquid broth culture and mix it directly with 1.0 mL of pure, sterile glycerol (100%).\n\nBased on fundamental principles of microbiology and cell physiology, what is the most likely and immediate consequence for the majority of the *E. coli* cells in the mixture, even before the freezing process is initiated?\n\nA. The cells will be optimally protected, leading to a very high survival rate upon future thawing.\n\nB. The cells will rapidly lyse (burst) due to the influx of glycerol molecules.\n\nC. The glycerol will have no significant immediate effect, as its cryoprotective properties are only activated during the freezing process.\n\nD. The cells will undergo severe plasmolysis and dehydration due to extreme osmotic shock, leading to cell death.\n\nE. The glycerol will act as a potent nutrient source, causing the cells to enter a phase of rapid, uncontrolled growth.", "solution": "We start from the standard protocol: to cryopreserve cells at $-80^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the culture is mixed with glycerol to a final volume fraction $\\phi_{\\text{target}}=0.15$ (v/v). This concentration is chosen to provide cryoprotection while keeping osmotic stress within survivable limits for the cells before freezing.\n\nIn the deviation, the student mixes $1.0$ mL of culture with $1.0$ mL of pure glycerol. The total volume is $2.0$ mL with $1.0$ mL glycerol, so the resulting glycerol volume fraction is\n$$\n\\phi=\\frac{1.0}{2.0}=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5,\n$$\nwhich is much greater than the intended $0.15$.\n\nTo predict the immediate effect on cells, apply osmosis and water activity principles. Glycerol is a non-electrolyte with van’t Hoff factor $i=1$, so the osmotic pressure of the extracellular solution scales as\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\text{out}}=R T c_{\\text{glycerol}},\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, and $c_{\\text{glycerol}}$ is the molar concentration of glycerol. At $\\phi=0.5$, $c_{\\text{glycerol}}$ is very high, so $\\Pi_{\\text{out}}$ greatly exceeds the cytoplasmic osmotic pressure $\\Pi_{\\text{in}}$. Equivalently, the chemical potential of water is\n$$\n\\mu_{w}=\\mu_{w}^{0}+R T \\ln a_{w},\n$$\nand the external water activity $a_{w}$ is strongly depressed by the high glycerol fraction. Thus, to equalize $\\mu_{w}$ across the membrane, water flows out of the cell rapidly.\n\nThe immediate consequence of $\\Pi_{\\text{out}}\\gg \\Pi_{\\text{in}}$ is rapid efflux of water, leading to shrinkage of the cytoplasm and separation of the cytoplasmic membrane from the cell wall, i.e., plasmolysis. Severe dehydration damages membranes and proteins, causing loss of viability even before freezing. While glycerol can permeate through aquaglyceroporins, the initial hyperosmotic shock at $\\phi=0.5$ and the very low external $a_{w}$ lead to acute plasmolysis and toxicity rather than protection.\n\nWe now exclude the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because $\\phi=0.5$ is far above the protective range; high glycerol is toxic and causes lethal osmotic stress.\n- B is incorrect because bursting (lysis) follows hypotonic shock with water influx; here the medium is hypertonic, causing water efflux and shrinkage.\n- C is incorrect because glycerol’s osmotic effects are immediate at room temperature; cryoprotective action is not confined to freezing.\n- E is incorrect because although glycerol can be a carbon source, at $\\phi=0.5$ the environment is strongly bacteriostatic or lethal; rapid growth will not occur.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and immediate consequence is severe plasmolysis and dehydration due to extreme osmotic shock, leading to cell death.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2087305"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate measure of a preservation protocol's success is how many cells survive the freeze-thaw cycle.
