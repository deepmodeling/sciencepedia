[@problem_id:2092119]", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with identifying an unknown bacterial isolate. Preliminary tests confirm that the bacterium is a Gram-negative rod. To further characterize it, the student inoculates a plate of MacConkey agar, a medium that is both selective for Gram-negative bacteria and differential for lactose fermentation. The medium contains lactose as the sole fermentable carbohydrate and a pH indicator, neutral red. Organisms that ferment lactose produce acidic byproducts, causing the pH to drop and the neutral red indicator to turn the colonies a pink or red color. Organisms that do not ferment lactose utilize peptones in the medium, producing alkaline byproducts, which leaves the colonies colorless or pale.\n\nAfter incubating the plate at 37°C for 24 hours, the student observes well-isolated, translucent, colorless colonies. Based on this result, the student initially concludes the organism is a non-lactose fermenter. However, the lab instructor advises incubating the plate for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours).\n\nAssuming the unknown bacterium is, in fact, a known *slow* lactose fermenter, what is the most probable appearance of the colonies after the full 48-hour incubation period?\n\nA. The colonies will remain colorless and translucent.\n\nB. The colonies will have developed a distinct pink or red color.\n\nC. The colonies will have lysed, leaving clear zones on the agar.\n\nD. The colonies will have developed a metallic green sheen.\n\nE. The colonies will have turned black at their centers.", "solution": "MacConkey agar is selective for Gram-negative bacteria and differential for lactose fermentation using the pH indicator neutral red. The relevant principle is that lactose fermentation produces acidic byproducts that lower pH; neutral red is red/pink under acidic conditions, so lactose-fermenting colonies appear pink or red. Non-lactose fermenters instead catabolize peptones, generating alkaline byproducts that keep colonies colorless or pale.\n\nA slow lactose fermenter may not produce sufficient acid within 24 hours to shift the neutral red indicator, leading to colonies that initially appear colorless and translucent. With extended incubation (total of 48 hours), a slow fermenter completes lactose fermentation to a degree sufficient to acidify the local environment, leading to a color change of colonies to pink or red.\n\nEvaluating options against these principles:\n- A is inconsistent with the stated assumption that the organism is a slow lactose fermenter; such organisms would not remain colorless after adequate time.\n- B matches the expected phenotype of a slow lactose fermenter on MacConkey agar after extended incubation: development of pink or red colonies due to acid production.\n- C describes lysis and clear zones, which are not characteristic outcomes on MacConkey from extended incubation; clear zones are more typical of plaques or hemolysis on other media.\n- D (metallic green sheen) is a hallmark of strong lactose fermentation on EMB agar (e.g., Escherichia coli), not MacConkey.\n- E (black centers) indicates hydrogen sulfide production seen on media such as Hektoen enteric or XLD agar, not on MacConkey.\n\nTherefore, after 48 hours, the most probable appearance is development of distinct pink or red colonies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2092119"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply reading plates, a skilled microbiologist must be able to troubleshoot when results don't match expectations. This practice problem simulates a common lab scenario: a well-characterized organism, *Staphylococcus aureus*, fails to produce the expected reaction on Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA). To solve this puzzle, you must systematically analyze the function of each component of the medium—the selective agent ($NaCl$), the differential substrate (mannitol), and the pH indicator (phenol red)—to pinpoint the source of the error. [@problem_id:2092134]", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with preparing a batch of Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA), a medium used for isolating and differentiating staphylococci. The standard formulation for MSA includes 7.5% Sodium Chloride (NaCl), mannitol as a fermentable carbohydrate, phenol red as a pH indicator, and other nutrients like peptone and beef extract. The final pH of the medium should be approximately 7.4, where phenol red appears pinkish-red.\n\nThe student prepares the medium, autoclaves it, and pours the plates. To validate the batch, a plate is inoculated with a pure culture of *Staphylococcus aureus*. This bacterium is known to be halotolerant (it can grow in high salt concentrations) and is a confirmed mannitol fermenter, a process that produces acidic byproducts. After 24 hours of incubation, the student observes robust colony growth, but the agar surrounding the colonies remains the original pinkish-red color, showing no evidence of the expected yellow halo that indicates acid production.\n\nAssuming the bacterial culture is viable and behaving as expected, which of the following represents the most plausible error in the preparation of this batch of MSA that could account for these observations?\n\nA. The concentration of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) was mistakenly made at 1.5% instead of the standard 7.5%.\n\nB. The phenol red indicator was added, but the mannitol was accidentally omitted from the medium.\n\nC. The beef extract, a key source of general nutrients, was accidentally omitted from the medium.\n\nD. The initial pH of the medium was incorrectly adjusted to 6.0 before it was autoclaved and poured.\n\nE. The plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber instead of a standard aerobic incubator.", "solution": "The medium to be prepared is Mannitol Salt Agar, which is both selective and differential. Selectivity arises from a high NaCl concentration of 7.5%, which permits halotolerant organisms such as Staphylococcus species to grow while inhibiting many others. Differentiation arises from the presence of mannitol as a fermentable carbohydrate and phenol red as a pH indicator: fermentation of mannitol by appropriate organisms (for example, Staphylococcus aureus) produces acidic end products that lower the local $pH$, causing phenol red to turn yellow in the vicinity of colonies. At approximately neutral to alkaline $pH$ (for example, $pH \\approx 7.4$), phenol red appears pinkish-red.\n\nGiven a confirmed mannitol-fermenting Staphylococcus aureus inoculated on the test plate, the expected observation is robust growth due to halotolerance and a yellow halo due to acid production from mannitol fermentation. The actual observation is robust growth with the agar remaining pinkish-red, indicating no detectable acidification around colonies.\n\nEvaluate each potential error against the observations:\n- Option A (NaCl at 1.5% instead of 7.5%): Lowering NaCl reduces selectivity but does not prevent growth of Staphylococcus aureus or its ability to ferment mannitol. If mannitol and phenol red are present, a yellow color change should still occur with fermentation. This does not explain robust growth without yellow halos.\n- Option B (mannitol omitted): Without mannitol, the differential substrate is absent, so even a confirmed mannitol fermenter cannot produce acid from mannitol. Cells can still grow using peptone and beef extract, often producing alkaline byproducts (for example, ammonia from amino acid deamination), tending to maintain or increase $pH$, keeping phenol red pinkish-red. This exactly matches robust growth with no yellow halo.\n- Option C (beef extract omitted): Omitting a major nutrient source would be expected to impair growth. This contradicts the observation of robust growth.\n- Option D ($pH$ adjusted to 6.0 initially): Phenol red is yellow under acidic conditions; at $pH=6.0$ the plates would begin yellow, not pinkish-red. This contradicts the observed initial pinkish-red color.\n- Option E (anaerobic incubation): Staphylococcus aureus is a facultative anaerobe and can ferment mannitol anaerobically; acid production and the indicator’s color change would still be expected. This does not explain the absence of yellow halos.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible error is omission of mannitol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2092134"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of understanding microbial metabolism is not just identifying bacteria, but designing conditions to select for them from a complex environmental sample. This enrichment culture problem challenges you to act as a microbial ecologist, creating a highly specific liquid medium and environment. By synthesizing multiple metabolic requirements—including energy source, electron donor, oxygen tolerance, and nutrient needs—you will learn to design a protocol that favors a unique phototrophic bacterium while suppressing all others.

The target organism has the following metabolic profile:\n1.  It is a phototroph, using light as its primary energy source.\n2.  It performs anoxygenic photosynthesis, meaning it does not produce oxygen. It requires a reduced inorganic compound other than water as an electron donor.\n3.  It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning oxygen is toxic to it.\n4.  It is incapable of diazotrophy, meaning it cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen ($N_2$) and requires a pre-existing source of fixed nitrogen (e.g., ammonia).\n\nTo isolate this bacterium, the microbiologist plans to use an enrichment culture technique. This involves preparing a liquid medium and providing specific incubation conditions that will selectively favor the growth of the target organism while inhibiting the growth of other microbes present in the sediment, such as chemoheterotrophs, oxygenic phototrophs (e.g., cyanobacteria), and nitrogen-fixing organisms.\n\nThe starting point is a basal mineral salts broth that contains essential trace elements and a phosphate buffer to maintain a stable pH. The task is to choose the correct set of supplements to add to this basal medium and the appropriate physical conditions for incubation.\n\nBelow are five proposed strategies.

It lacks a reduced inorganic electron donor and a fixed nitrogen source, so it will not reliably support the target organism and may limit growth.\n- Option B adds $NaHCO_3$, $Na_2S$, and $NH_4Cl$ but incubates aerobically under light. Aerobic conditions contradict obligate anaerobiosis and will inhibit or kill the target.\n- Option C adds $NaHCO_3$ (inorganic carbon), $Na_2S$ (reduced inorganic electron donor), and $NH_4Cl$ (fixed nitrogen), and incubates anaerobically under continuous illumination, exactly matching all physiological requirements. These conditions also suppress competitors: absence of organic carbon disfavours chemoheterotrophs; anaerobiosis disfavors oxygenic phototrophs like cyanobacteria; lack of $N_2$ fixation advantage is neutralized by providing $NH_4Cl$.\n- Option D provides organic carbon sources (glucose, yeast extract) and darkness under anaerobiosis, which would enrich anaerobic chemoheterotrophs, not phototrophs.\n- Option E adds $NaHCO_3$ and $NH_4Cl$ under aerobic light but omits a reduced inorganic electron donor and imposes oxygen, which is incompatible with obligate anaerobiosis and would favour oxygenic phototrophs.\n\nTherefore, the strategy that most effectively enriches the target bacterium is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2092122"}]}
