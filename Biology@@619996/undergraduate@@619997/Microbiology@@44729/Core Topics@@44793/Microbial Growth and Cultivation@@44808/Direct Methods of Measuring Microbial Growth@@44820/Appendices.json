To perform a viable plate count, the microbiologist will use a serial dilution method. Each step in the series will be a 1:100 dilution (e.g., 1 mL of culture into 99 mL of sterile diluent). After the dilutions are prepared, a volume of 0.1 mL from one of the dilution tubes will be spread onto an agar plate.

Results from plates outside this range are generally considered unreliable for calculating the original concentration of microorganisms. Although both Plate B and Plate C fall outside this ideal range, one is considered particularly unreliable due to the disproportionate effect of random sampling error.\n\nWhich plate count is considered most unreliable for this specific statistical reason, and why?\n\nA. Plate B, because the high density of colonies makes it physically difficult to count each one accurately without a specialized automated counter.\n\nB. Plate C, because with a small total number of colonies, random fluctuations in the distribution of cells in the aliquot have a large relative effect, leading to high statistical sampling error.\n\nC. Plate B, because severe competition for nutrients at such a high colony density can inhibit the growth of some viable bacteria, leading to an underestimation of the true count.\n\nD.
