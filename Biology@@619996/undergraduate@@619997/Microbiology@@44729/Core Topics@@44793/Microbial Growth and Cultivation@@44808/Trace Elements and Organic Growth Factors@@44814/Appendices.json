This practice guides you through the classic experimental logic for distinguishing a self-sufficient prototroph from an auxotroph, which requires a specific nutrient it cannot synthesize. By interpreting growth patterns on precisely formulated media, you will learn to pinpoint a specific metabolic deficiency, a fundamental skill in both microbial genetics and physiology [@problem_id:2101656].", "problem": "A microbiology researcher is studying a strain of *Escherichia coli* that was isolated after exposure to a mutagen. This strain is referred to as the \"mutant strain\", while the original, unmutated strain is the \"wild-type\" (WT). The researcher hypothesizes that the mutant is an auxotroph, specifically that it has lost the ability to synthesize the amino acid proline.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, an experiment is conducted using three different types of sterile growth media prepared in petri dishes:\n1.  **Nutrient Agar:** A complex, undefined medium rich in various amino acids, vitamins, and other growth factors.\n2.  **Minimal Medium (MM) Agar:** A chemically defined medium containing only glucose as a carbon source, along with essential inorganic salts (e.g., ammonium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate) required for growth by a prototroph.\n3.  **Minimal Medium + Proline (MM+Pro) Agar:** This is the minimal medium described above, but supplemented with a sterile solution of the amino acid L-proline.\n\nBoth the WT and the mutant strains were streaked onto a separate section of each of the three plates. The plates were then incubated for 48 hours at 37°C. The following results were observed:\n\n*   **On the Nutrient Agar plate:** Abundant growth was observed for both the WT and mutant strains.\n*   **On the MM Agar plate:** Abundant growth was observed for the WT strain, but no visible growth was observed for the mutant strain.\n*   **On the MM+Pro Agar plate:** Abundant growth was observed for both the WT and mutant strains.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements is the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. The mutant strain is an auxotroph for proline.\n\nB. The wild-type strain is an auxotroph for proline.\n\nC. The mutant strain is unable to utilize glucose as a carbon source.\n\nD. Both the wild-type and the mutant strains are prototrophs.\n\nE. Proline is toxic to the wild-type strain.\n\nF. A component of the minimal medium is inhibitory to the mutant strain.", "solution": "The problem requires us to interpret the results of a classic microbiology experiment designed to identify an auxotrophic mutant. We must analyze the growth patterns of the wild-type (WT) and mutant strains on different media to determine the metabolic capabilities of the mutant.\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms. A prototroph is an organism (like the WT strain) that can synthesize all of its required cellular components from a simple carbon source and inorganic salts. An auxotroph is a mutant organism that has lost the ability to synthesize a specific essential compound (a growth factor, such as an amino acid) and must obtain it from the environment.\n\nLet's analyze the results from each plate step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Nutrient Agar Result**: \"Abundant growth was observed for both the WT and mutant strains.\"\n    Nutrient agar is a complex medium that provides all necessary growth factors, including all 20 standard amino acids. The fact that both strains grew well on this medium serves as a positive control. It confirms that both the WT and mutant strains are viable (i.e., alive and capable of reproduction) under the given incubation conditions. This observation rules out any general defect in the mutant strain that would prevent its growth on any medium.\n\n2.  **Minimal Medium (MM) Agar Result**: \"Abundant growth was observed for the WT strain, but no visible growth was observed for the mutant strain.\"\n    Minimal medium contains only the bare necessities for a prototroph. The growth of the WT strain on MM confirms that it is a prototroph, as expected. It can synthesize all its necessary amino acids, including proline, from the glucose and salts provided. The failure of the mutant strain to grow on MM indicates that it is an auxotroph. It is unable to synthesize at least one essential compound that is absent from this medium.\n\n3.  **Minimal Medium + Proline (MM+Pro) Agar Result**: \"Abundant growth was observed for both the WT and mutant strains.\"\n    This plate is the most informative for identifying the specific nutritional requirement of the mutant. The medium is identical to the MM agar, with the sole addition of proline. The fact that the mutant strain, which could not grow on MM, *can* now grow on MM+Pro demonstrates that its growth was specifically limited by the absence of proline. This is called \"rescuing\" the auxotroph. The addition of proline corrected the metabolic deficiency.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each multiple-choice option based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A. The mutant strain is an auxotroph for proline.** This statement is fully supported by the evidence. The mutant fails to grow on a medium lacking proline (MM) but grows perfectly when proline is supplied (MM+Pro), while being otherwise viable (grows on Nutrient Agar). This is the definition of a proline auxotroph.\n\n*   **B. The wild-type strain is an auxotroph for proline.** This is incorrect. The WT strain grew on MM, which lacks proline, proving it can synthesize its own proline and is therefore a prototroph.\n\n*   **C. The mutant strain is unable to utilize glucose as a carbon source.** This is incorrect. The mutant strain grew on the MM+Pro plate. The only carbon source in this medium is glucose. Therefore, the mutant must be able to utilize glucose.\n\n*   **D. Both the wild-type and the mutant strains are prototrophs.** This is incorrect. The mutant strain's failure to grow on MM proves it is not a prototroph.\n\n*   **E. Proline is toxic to the wild-type strain.** This is incorrect. The WT strain showed abundant growth on the MM+Pro plate, demonstrating that proline is not toxic to it.\n\n*   **F. A component of the minimal medium is inhibitory to the mutant strain.** This is incorrect. The MM+Pro medium contains all the same components as the MM medium, plus proline. If a component of MM were inhibitory, the mutant would not have grown on MM+Pro either. Since it did grow on MM+Pro, no component of the MM can be considered inhibitory.\n\nBased on the systematic evaluation of all results and options, the only conclusion that is consistent with all the data is that the mutant strain is an auxotroph for proline.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2101656"}, {"introduction": "Microbes rarely live in isolation; their nutritional needs often drive complex community interactions. This exercise explores the fascinating phenomenon of syntrophy, or cross-feeding, where one organism provides an essential nutrient for another. You must apply your understanding of auxotrophy to determine the correct experimental conditions, demonstrating how media choice is a critical factor in revealing these intricate ecological relationships [@problem_id:2101647].", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with designing an experiment to demonstrate the phenomenon of syntrophy, also known as cross-feeding. The experiment involves two different mutant strains of *Escherichia coli*.\n- Strain X is an auxotroph that requires the amino acid histidine for growth ($\\text{His}^-$) but can produce the amino acid proline ($\\text{Pro}^+$).\n- Strain Y is an auxotroph that requires proline for growth ($\\text{Pro}^-$) but can produce histidine ($\\text{His}^+$).\n\nThe student plans to streak the two strains in parallel lines close to each other on a solid agar plate. Growth in the area between the two streaks would be evidence of cross-feeding, where each strain provides the essential amino acid the other lacks.\n\nThe student must choose between a minimal medium and a complex medium for the experiment. A **minimal medium** is a defined culture medium containing only the essential nutrients (like a carbon source and inorganic salts) required for the growth of a wild-type organism. A **complex medium** is an undefined medium containing a rich supply of nutrients, including pre-formed amino acids and vitamins, often from sources like yeast extract.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific reason for why one type of medium is required over the other to successfully observe cross-feeding in this scenario?\n\nA. A complex medium is required because it contains essential cofactors that activate the transport proteins responsible for secreting and uptaking amino acids between the cells.\n\nB. A minimal medium is required because the high concentration of various amino acids in a complex medium would allow both strains to grow independently anywhere on the plate, masking the localized growth that indicates syntrophy.\n\nC. A complex medium is required because the rapid growth it supports is necessary to generate a sufficient concentration of secreted amino acids for cross-feeding to occur in a timely manner.\n\nD. A minimal medium is required because components in the yeast extract of a complex medium are often inhibitory to the growth of auxotrophic bacterial strains.\n\nE. A minimal medium is required because its low nutrient content forces the cells into a stationary phase, which is the only phase where amino acid secretion occurs.", "solution": "Goal: Detect syntrophy (cross-feeding) between two auxotrophic strains by observing localized growth between parallel streaks only where each strain supplies the amino acid the other lacks.\n\nPremises:\n- Strain X is $\\text{His}^- \\text{Pro}^+$; strain Y is $\\text{Pro}^- \\text{His}^+$. Each strain lacks the ability to synthesize one essential amino acid, so without that amino acid supplied, it cannot grow.\n- Minimal medium contains no pre-formed amino acids; complex medium contains a rich supply of pre-formed amino acids (e.g., histidine and proline) from sources like yeast extract.\n\nLogical consequences:\n1. On minimal medium:\n   - Neither $\\text{His}^-$ nor $\\text{Pro}^-$ can grow independently because their required amino acids are absent from the medium.\n   - Growth can only occur if one strain acquires its missing amino acid from the other, i.e., through localized secretion and diffusion across the narrow gap between streaks.\n   - Therefore, growth should be restricted to the region between the streaks, providing a clear spatial signature of cross-feeding.\n\n2. On complex medium:\n   - The medium already contains pre-formed histidine and proline.\n   - Each auxotroph can grow independently anywhere on the plate because its missing amino acid is supplied by the medium.\n   - This independent, widespread growth eliminates the need for and masks any localized cross-feeding, removing the diagnostic spatial pattern.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: Transport and secretion of amino acids do not require undefined cofactors uniquely present in complex media; such processes occur in defined media as well.\n- B is correct: Minimal medium is required because complex medium provides the missing amino acids broadly, allowing independent growth and obscuring the localized growth pattern indicative of syntrophy.\n- C is incorrect: Rapid growth from complex media is not required for cross-feeding; it undermines the assay by abolishing spatial dependence.\n- D is incorrect: Yeast extract is not generally inhibitory to auxotrophs; it typically supports their growth.\n- E is incorrect: Amino acid secretion is not restricted to stationary phase, and forcing stationary phase is not necessary nor desirable for demonstrating cross-feeding.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate scientific reason is that minimal medium is required to prevent independent growth supplied by exogenous amino acids and thereby reveal localized, interdependent growth between the streaks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2101647"}, {"introduction": "Bacterial growth depends not only on organic compounds but also on minute quantities of inorganic trace elements that are vital for enzyme function. This problem presents a common experimental puzzle where a seemingly complete medium fails to support growth, challenging you to investigate the unseen factors at play. By diagnosing the effect of a chemical agent on nutrient availability, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the essential role of metal ions as enzymatic cofactors [@problem_id:2101688].", "problem": "A microbiologist is cultivating a strain of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in a chemically defined minimal medium. This medium contains glucose as the sole carbon source, ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source, a phosphate buffer system, and other essential inorganic salts. Trace amounts of metal ions, necessary for bacterial growth, are assumed to be present as contaminants in the chemical reagents and the deionized water used to prepare the medium.\n\nIn an experiment, the microbiologist prepares two batches of this medium. To the second batch, they add a small concentration of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a compound known to be non-toxic to the bacteria at this concentration. Both media are inoculated with an identical number of *P. aeruginosa* cells and incubated under optimal conditions. After 24 hours, the first batch shows significant turbidity, indicating robust bacterial growth, while the second batch containing EDTA remains almost completely clear, showing a profound inhibition of growth.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for the observed growth inhibition in the presence of EDTA?\n\nA. EDTA directly intercalates into the bacterial DNA, preventing transcription and replication.\n\nB. EDTA acts as a competitive inhibitor for the enzyme hexokinase, blocking the first step of glycolysis.\n\nC. EDTA sequesters essential metal ions, making them unavailable for use as enzymatic cofactors.\n\nD. EDTA disrupts the bacterial outer membrane by binding to ribosomes, halting protein synthesis.\n\nE. EDTA significantly increases the osmolarity of the medium, causing the bacterial cells to undergo plasmolysis.", "solution": "We identify EDTA as a hexadentate chelating agent that forms highly stable complexes with divalent and trivalent metal ions commonly required by bacteria as enzymatic cofactors, such as $Mg^{2+}$, $Ca^{2+}$, $Fe^{2+}$, $Fe^{3+}$, $Mn^{2+}$, $Zn^{2+}$, and $Cu^{2+}$. The general complexation equilibrium can be represented as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EDTA}^{4-} + \\mathrm{M}^{n+} \\rightleftharpoons [\\mathrm{M}\\text{-}\\mathrm{EDTA}]^{(n-4)-}\n$$\nThe large formation (stability) constants for these complexes drive the equilibrium to the right, thereby decreasing the free (bioavailable) concentration of the metal ion, denoted by $[M^{n+}]$.\n\nIn a chemically defined minimal medium where no explicit trace metal supplement is added, bacteria rely on trace metal contaminants present in reagents and water. These trace metals serve as essential cofactors for numerous metalloenzymes involved in fundamental processes, including but not limited to:\n- $Mg^{2+}$ for polymerases and kinases (nucleic acid synthesis and central metabolism),\n- Fe for components of the electron transport chain and various oxidoreductases,\n- Mn, Zn, and others for enzymes such as superoxide dismutases and dehydrogenases.\n\nWhen EDTA is added, it sequesters these trace metals into inert chelate complexes, effectively reducing the free ion activities required for enzyme function. As a result, key metabolic and biosynthetic pathways cannot proceed, preventing growth, which explains the absence of turbidity in the EDTA-containing batch.\n\nEvaluating alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because EDTA is not a planar aromatic molecule and does not intercalate into DNA; its known action is metal chelation.\n- Option B is incorrect because EDTA is not a structural analog of glucose and does not act as a competitive inhibitor of kinases; moreover, bacteria typically utilize glucokinase, and EDTA’s mechanism is unrelated to competitive inhibition at glycolytic enzymes.\n- Option D is incorrect because EDTA does not bind ribosomes; although it can chelate $Mg^{2+}/Ca^{2+}$ that stabilize the Gram-negative outer membrane, its primary effect here is not direct ribosomal inhibition. The profound growth inhibition in this minimal, unsupplemented medium is best explained by chelation of essential trace metals.\n- Option E is incorrect because at the small concentration used (non-toxic by assumption), EDTA does not raise osmolarity sufficiently to cause plasmolysis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and primary explanation is that EDTA sequesters essential metal ions, making them unavailable as enzymatic cofactors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2101688"}]}
