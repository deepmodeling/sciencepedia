This first practice presents a classic scenario: a newly isolated bacterium thrives on a nutrient-rich complex medium but fails to grow on a minimal defined medium. By analyzing the composition of each, you will learn to deduce the general nutritional requirements of an organism and diagnose it as \"fastidious.\" [@problem_id:2060981]", "problem": "A microbiologist isolates a novel bacterium, tentatively named *Bacillus novellus*, from a soil sample. To characterize its nutritional requirements, the microbiologist attempts to grow it on two different solid agar plates at 30Â°C.\n\n*   **Medium 1 (Complex Medium):** Tryptic Soy Agar, which contains tryptone (an enzymatic digest of casein protein), soytone (an enzymatic digest of soybean meal), sodium chloride, and agar.\n*   **Medium 2 (Chemically Defined Medium):** A minimal salts medium containing glucose as the sole carbon and energy source, ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source, potassium phosphate buffer, a standard solution of trace mineral salts (including magnesium, iron, and calcium), and agar.\n\nAfter 48 hours of incubation, vigorous growth of *Bacillus novellus* is observed on Medium 1, but there is a complete absence of growth on Medium 2. This observation suggests that *Bacillus novellus* is a fastidious organism.\n\nBased on the compositions of the two media, which of the following is the most likely reason for the failure of *Bacillus novellus* to grow on the chemically defined medium?\n\nA. The use of an incorrect incubation temperature.\n\nB. The lack of a suitable solidifying agent.\n\nC. The absence of one or more essential organic growth factors.\n\nD. The presence of a toxic concentration of glucose.\n\nE. The absence of an alternative inorganic energy source.", "solution": "We are told that the bacterium grows vigorously on a complex medium (Tryptic Soy Agar) but fails to grow on a chemically defined minimal medium that provides glucose as the sole carbon and energy source, ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source, phosphate buffer, trace minerals, and agar. Complex media supply a mixture of preformed organic molecules such as amino acids, peptides, vitamins, nucleotides, and other growth factors derived from enzymatic digests of proteins and plant materials. In contrast, a chemically defined minimal medium requires the organism to synthesize all cellular building blocks de novo from simple inorganic nitrogen (ammonium), a single organic carbon and energy source (glucose), and inorganic salts and trace elements.\n\nIf an organism grows on a complex medium but not on a defined minimal medium, this indicates it is unable to synthesize one or more essential organic compounds required for growth (for example, certain amino acids, vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, or other cofactors), and thus depends on their presence in the medium. This phenotype is consistent with fastidiousness or auxotrophy for specific growth factors that are provided by the complex medium but absent from the minimal medium.\n\nWe exclude the other options as follows:\n- Incorrect incubation temperature cannot explain the difference because the organism grows at the same temperature on the complex medium; therefore, the temperature is suitable.\n- The lack of a suitable solidifying agent is not applicable because agar is present in both media.\n- Toxic concentration of glucose is unlikely; standard minimal media use non-toxic glucose levels, and if glucose were toxic, growth would typically also be impaired on complex media that can contain utilizable carbohydrates or would show at least some inhibition pattern rather than a strict absence only on minimal medium.\n- The absence of an alternative inorganic energy source is irrelevant for an organism that grows on a complex, organic-rich medium; growth there indicates organotrophy rather than a requirement for chemolithotrophic energy sources. Glucose is an adequate energy and carbon source for heterotrophs.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for failure to grow on the chemically defined medium is the absence of one or more essential organic growth factors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2060981"}, {"introduction": "Once a general nutritional requirement is suspected, the next step in scientific inquiry is to test a specific hypothesis. This practice challenges you to think like a research scientist by designing a definitive experiment to determine if a bacterium is an auxotroph for a particular amino acid. Critically evaluating the proposed methods will reinforce the unique power of chemically defined media and the indispensable role of controls in isolating variables and drawing valid conclusions. [@problem_id:2060956]", "problem": "A research team is investigating a newly discovered bacterium, designated strain BA-2024, for its potential in bioremediation. The team hypothesizes that this strain is an auxotroph for the amino acid tryptophan, meaning it cannot synthesize tryptophan on its own and requires it from the environment for growth. To test this hypothesis, they must choose an appropriate culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following experimental approaches and justifications is the most scientifically sound method to determine if strain BA-2024 is a tryptophan auxotroph?\n\nA. Use a complex medium, such as nutrient broth. If the bacterium grows, it confirms it is a tryptophan auxotroph, because complex media are rich in a wide variety of nutrients, including amino acids.\n\nB. Use a chemically defined medium that contains all necessary nutrients for a typical bacterium, including tryptophan. If the bacterium grows, it confirms it is a tryptophan auxotroph, as growth demonstrates its ability to utilize tryptophan from the medium.\n\nC. Use a chemically defined medium that contains all necessary nutrients for a typical bacterium, but specifically lacks tryptophan. If the bacterium fails to grow, it confirms it is a tryptophan auxotroph because the absence of the required nutrient prevents growth.\n\nD. Use two parallel cultures. One culture will use a chemically defined medium lacking tryptophan, and the other will use the same chemically defined medium supplemented with tryptophan. Comparing the growth in both is necessary.\n\nE. Use a differential medium containing a pH indicator. If the bacterium is a tryptophan auxotroph, it will be unable to metabolize other components, leading to a specific color change that confirms the diagnosis.", "solution": "An auxotroph for tryptophan is defined operationally as a bacterium that fails to grow when tryptophan is absent and grows when tryptophan is supplied, with all other nutritional and environmental variables held constant. The scientifically sound way to test this requires:\n1) A chemically defined medium so that the presence or absence of tryptophan is the only difference between conditions.\n2) A controlled comparison of two parallel cultures: one lacking tryptophan (test condition) and one supplemented with tryptophan (positive control for growth/viability).\nPredicted outcomes under this design:\n- If the strain is a prototroph for tryptophan, it will grow in both the tryptophan-lacking and tryptophan-supplemented media.\n- If the strain is a tryptophan auxotroph, it will grow only in the tryptophan-supplemented medium and fail to grow in the tryptophan-lacking medium.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is invalid because complex media contain many undefined components; growth cannot diagnose auxotrophy and the specific requirement cannot be isolated.\n- B is insufficient because growth in a defined medium that includes tryptophan does not demonstrate requirement; it only shows the strain can grow under those conditions. A minus-tryptophan control is necessary.\n- C is insufficient because failure to grow in a tryptophan-lacking medium alone is non-diagnostic; many other factors could limit growth. A supplemented control is required to verify viability and isolate the variable.\n- D is correct because it uses a chemically defined medium and controls all variables except the presence of tryptophan, allowing a definitive inference about auxotrophy.\n- E is irrelevant; differential media and pH indicators are not designed to determine amino acid auxotrophy.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound approach is to perform two parallel cultures in chemically defined media differing only by the presence or absence of tryptophan and compare growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2060956"}, {"introduction": "The choice of culture medium influences more than just whether a microbe can grow; it profoundly affects the dynamics of the growth process itself. This exercise explores the physiological adaptation required when a bacterium shifts from a nutrient-replete environment to a nutritionally sparse one. By predicting the effect of this shift on the lag phase of the growth curve, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the cellular resources and time needed to activate essential biosynthetic pathways. [@problem_id:2060954]", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the metabolic adaptability of *Escherichia coli*. The experiment involves two types of sterile liquid media:\n\n1.  **Complex Medium (CM):** A nutrient-rich broth containing tryptone and yeast extract. This medium provides all 20 amino acids, vitamins, and other growth factors, meaning the bacteria do not need to synthesize these complex molecules themselves.\n2.  **Minimal Medium (MM):** A chemically defined medium containing only glucose as a carbon and energy source, along with essential inorganic salts (e.g., ammonium chloride, sodium phosphate). For growth in this medium, *E. coli* must synthesize all of its own amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins from glucose.\n\nThe experiment begins with a healthy, exponentially growing culture of *E. coli* in the Complex Medium (CM). Two identical small aliquots of this culture are then transferred into two new flasks:\n\n*   **Flask A:** The aliquot is transferred into fresh, pre-warmed Complex Medium (CM).\n*   **Flask B:** The aliquot is transferred into fresh, pre-warmed Minimal Medium (MM).\n\nThe growth in both flasks is monitored. The \"lag phase\" of a bacterial growth curve is the initial period where there is little to no increase in cell number as the bacteria adapt to the new environment.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the experiment regarding the duration of the lag phases in Flask A and Flask B?\n\nA. The lag phase in Flask A will be significantly longer than in Flask B because the high nutrient concentration in CM requires a longer period for the cells to adjust their osmotic balance.\n\nB. The lag phase in Flask B will be significantly longer than in Flask A because the cells must synthesize a wide range of enzymes for biosynthetic pathways that were not needed in the original complex medium.\n\nC. The lag phases in both flasks will be of approximately equal, and very short, duration, as the cells were transferred from an active, healthy culture.\n\nD. The lag phase in Flask B will be shorter than in Flask A because the simpler composition of the minimal medium allows for faster initiation of cell division.\n\nE. There will be no lag phase in Flask A, but there will be a normal lag phase in Flask B. The absence of a lag phase in Flask A is due to the cells entering a state of immediate stationary phase upon transfer.", "solution": "The lag phase reflects the time required for cells to adjust gene expression, enzyme pools, and transport/assimilation systems to the new environment before resuming balanced exponential growth. When an exponentially growing culture from a complex medium (CM) is transferred to fresh CM (Flask A), the nutrient composition and metabolic demands remain essentially the same as before transfer. The cells already possess active uptake systems for peptides, amino acids, vitamins, and other growth factors provided in CM, and their anabolic pathways for amino acid, nucleotide, and vitamin synthesis are largely repressed because these end products are supplied exogenously. Consequently, there is minimal need for de novo induction of broad biosynthetic networks; only minor adjustments to growth rate and cell cycle synchronization are required. Therefore, the lag phase in Flask A is expected to be very short.\n\nIn contrast, when cells are transferred from CM to a minimal medium (MM) with glucose as the sole carbon and energy source (Flask B), they must shift from relying on exogenous complex nutrients to synthesizing all amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins de novo. This shift requires extensive transcriptional reprogramming and derepression/activation of multiple biosynthetic operons (for example, amino acid biosynthesis operons such as trp, his, leu, ilv, met; nucleotide biosynthesis pathways; cofactor and vitamin biosynthesis), synthesis of the corresponding enzymes, establishment of adequate intracellular pools of metabolic intermediates and cofactors, and optimization of central carbon flux from glucose through glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle to feed these anabolic pathways. Building these enzyme pools and metabolite/cofactor levels takes time and cellular resources before balanced growth can resume. Thus, the lag phase in Flask B will be significantly longer than in Flask A.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because osmotic adjustment is not the dominant factor here, and CM does not inherently impose a longer osmotic adjustment than MM. C is incorrect because equivalently short lag phases are not expected; Flask B requires extensive metabolic reprogramming. D is incorrect because a simpler chemical composition of MM does not equate to simpler cellular demands; it imposes greater biosynthetic burden and thus longer lag. E is incorrect because transferring to fresh CM does not cause immediate stationary phase; rather, it supports immediate or near-immediate exponential growth with minimal lag.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that Flask B has a significantly longer lag phase than Flask A due to the need to synthesize and induce a wide range of biosynthetic enzymes absent in CM-grown cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2060954"}]}
