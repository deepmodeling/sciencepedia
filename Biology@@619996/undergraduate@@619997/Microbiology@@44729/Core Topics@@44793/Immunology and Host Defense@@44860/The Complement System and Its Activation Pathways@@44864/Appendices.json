By analyzing this case, you can deduce which pathway remains functional when a crucial protein, C4, is absent, thereby clarifying the essential, non-overlapping components of the system.", "problem": "The complement system is a critical component of the innate immune system, consisting of a cascade of plasma proteins that can be activated to eliminate pathogens. Activation typically leads to the formation of a C3 convertase, an enzyme that cleaves the central complement protein C3 into C3a (an inflammatory mediator) and C3b (a potent opsonin that tags pathogens for phagocytosis). C3b deposition is a key amplification step for all complement pathways.\n\nThere are three primary pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder resulting in a complete deficiency of complement component C4. Despite this deficiency, the patient's immune system can still mount a partial complement response to a bacterial infection, as evidenced by the successful deposition of C3b onto bacterial surfaces, albeit at a reduced rate compared to a healthy individual.\n\nGiven this clinical scenario, which of the following complement activation pathways remains functional to generate the C3 convertase responsible for this C3b deposition?\n\nA. The Classical Pathway\n\nB. The Lectin Pathway\n\nC. The Alternative Pathway\n\nD. The Terminal Pathway", "solution": "Key principle: All complement activation pathways converge on the generation of a C3 convertase that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The composition and upstream requirements of the C3 convertase differ by pathway.\n\nFor the classical pathway, immune complex-bound C1q activates C1r and C1s, which cleave C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase:\n$$\\text{C4} \\xrightarrow{\\text{C1s}} \\text{C4b}, \\quad \\text{C2} \\xrightarrow{\\text{C1s}} \\text{C2a}, \\quad \\text{C4b} + \\text{C2a} \\to \\text{C4b2a}.$$\nThus, the classical pathway requires C4 to generate its C3 convertase $\\text{C4b2a}$.\n\nFor the lectin pathway, mannose-binding lectin with MASP-2 mimics the classical pathway by cleaving C4 and C2 to the same C3 convertase:\n$$\\text{C4} \\xrightarrow{\\text{MASP-2}} \\text{C4b}, \\quad \\text{C2} \\xrightarrow{\\text{MASP-2}} \\text{C2a}, \\quad \\text{C4b} + \\text{C2a} \\to \\text{C4b2a}.$$\nThus, the lectin pathway also requires C4 to generate its C3 convertase $\\text{C4b2a}$.\n\nFor the alternative pathway, spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 initiates a C4-independent route:\n$$\\text{C3} \\to \\text{C3(H_2O)}, \\quad \\text{C3(H_2O)} + \\text{B} \\xrightarrow{\\text{D}} \\text{C3(H_2O)Bb}},$$\nwhich cleaves C3 to deposit C3b, allowing assembly of the surface C3 convertase:\n$$\\text{C3b} + \\text{B} \\xrightarrow{\\text{D}} \\text{C3bBb},$$\nstabilized by properdin.

The alternative pathway remains functional and can still generate the C3 convertase $\\text{C3bBb}$, producing C3b deposition, albeit at a reduced rate due to reliance on tickover and absence of amplification from the classical or lectin pathways. The terminal pathway is downstream of C5 cleavage and does not generate a C3 convertase.\n\nTherefore, the pathway that remains functional to generate the C3 convertase responsible for the observed C3b deposition is the alternative pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2096915"}, {"introduction": "Scientists frequently use specific inhibitors as molecular tools to dissect complex biological processes. This practice problem [@problem_id:2096901] simulates a classic laboratory experiment designed to determine which complement pathway is active against a pathogen. By understanding the differential ion requirements for each pathway—specifically the dependence of the classical and lectin pathways on calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) versus the alternative pathway's reliance on magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$)—you can learn to interpret experimental data to pinpoint the primary activation mechanism.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the host immune response to a newly discovered, unencapsulated Gram-negative bacterium. The researcher aims to determine which of the complement system pathways is primarily responsible for its destruction. An in-vitro experiment is designed using non-immune human serum, which is known to contain all necessary components for the classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways.\n\nThe experiment consists of two conditions:\n\n- **Condition A:** A suspension of the bacterium is incubated at 37°C in normal human serum.\n- **Condition B:** A suspension of the bacterium is incubated at 37°C in normal human serum that has been treated with ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). EGTA is a chelating agent with a very high affinity for calcium ions (Ca²⁺) but a significantly lower affinity for magnesium ions (Mg²⁺). The concentration of EGTA used is sufficient to sequester all free Ca²⁺ while leaving the concentration of free Mg²⁺ largely unaffected.\n\nAfter a standard incubation period, the viability of the bacteria in both conditions is measured. The results show that significant bacterial lysis occurs in Condition A. A similar, statistically indistinguishable level of bacterial lysis is also observed in Condition B.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following is the most likely conclusion regarding the primary mechanism of complement-mediated lysis of this bacterium?\n\nA. The classical pathway is the primary initiator of complement activation.\n\nB. The lectin pathway is the primary initiator of complement activation.\n\nC. The alternative pathway is the primary initiator of complement activation.\n\nD. Both the classical and alternative pathways are essential and contribute equally to lysis.\n\nE. Complement activation is not the cause of lysis; other bactericidal components in the serum are responsible.", "solution": "The experiment compares bacterial lysis in two sera: normal and EGTA-treated. EGTA selectively chelates $ \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} $ with high affinity while leaving $ \\mathrm{Mg^{2+}} $ largely available. The complement pathways have distinct ion requirements:\n- Classical pathway: Initiated by C1q binding to antibody on the microbe; the C1r/C1s serine proteases require $ \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} $ to assemble and function. Therefore, removal of $ \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} $ by EGTA abolishes classical pathway activity.\n- Lectin pathway: Initiated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins with MASP-1/2; these complexes similarly require $ \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} $ for carbohydrate recognition and complex stability. Thus EGTA also abolishes lectin pathway activity.\n- Alternative pathway: Initiated by spontaneous C3 hydrolysis and amplified on microbial surfaces; factor B binding to C3b and subsequent activation by factor D require $ \\mathrm{Mg^{2+}} $, not $ \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} $. EGTA, which spares $ \\mathrm{Mg^{2+}} $, does not inhibit the alternative pathway.\n\nCondition A (normal serum) allows all three pathways. Condition B (EGTA-treated serum) functionally disables the classical and lectin pathways while leaving the alternative pathway intact. The observation that lysis in Condition B is indistinguishable from Condition A implies that the pathways dependent on $ \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} $ (classical and lectin) are not required for the observed lysis; the alternative pathway alone suffices.\n\nAn unencapsulated Gram-negative bacterium presents surface structures (for example, lipooligosaccharide or lipopolysaccharide without protective capsule) that efficiently support alternative pathway C3 convertase formation and membrane attack complex deposition, making the alternative pathway a plausible primary mechanism. The use of non-immune serum further minimizes classical pathway initiation via specific antibodies.\n\nTherefore, the primary initiator of complement activation in this experiment is the alternative pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2096901"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of the complement system requires moving from pathway diagrams to the molecular mechanisms that drive activation and amplification. This problem [@problem_id:2096939] invites you to think like a molecular immunologist, exploring how a single amino acid change in the critical C3 protein has profound functional consequences. Predicting the outcome of this molecular modification will solidify your grasp of the C3 thioester bond's essential role in covalently tagging surfaces and amplifying the alternative pathway's response.", "problem": "In an immunology research laboratory, scientists are investigating the molecular basis of the complement system. They use site-directed mutagenesis to create a mutant version of human complement component 3 (C3). In this mutant C3 protein, a critical cysteine residue located within the thioester domain is replaced by a serine residue. The purified mutant C3 protein is then introduced into a serum-based in-vitro system that is specifically designed to assess the functionality of the alternative pathway of complement activation. Based on your understanding of the complement cascade, predict the most direct and significant functional consequence of this specific mutation on the initiation and amplification of the alternative pathway.\n\nA. The alternative pathway will be constitutively and uncontrollably activated because the mutant C3 is more susceptible to spontaneous hydrolysis.\n\nB. The mutation will have no effect on the alternative pathway, as the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b by convertases is not directly affected.\n\nC. The alternative pathway will fail to amplify efficiently on activating surfaces, as the C3b fragment will be unable to form stable covalent bonds with them.\n\nD. The mutant C3 will cause a shift in activation from the alternative pathway to the classical pathway, leading to antibody-independent C1q binding.\n\nE. The mutant C3b, once formed, will be unable to bind Factor B, directly preventing the assembly of the C3 convertase enzyme.", "solution": "The alternative pathway relies on the reactive thioester in the thioester-containing domain (TED) of C3. In native C3, an internal thioester is formed between a cysteine and a glutamine side chain. Upon activation and cleavage to C3b, this thioester becomes exposed and can undergo nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl or amine groups on nearby surfaces, producing a covalent amide or ester linkage. This covalent attachment of C3b to activating surfaces is essential for:\n1) stable surface deposition of C3b (opsonization), and\n2) assembly of the surface-bound C3 convertase, C3bBb, which drives amplification by generating more C3b.\n\nReplacing the critical cysteine in the TED with serine removes the ability to form a true thioester. At best, an oxyester-like intermediate could form, which is far less electrophilic and is rapidly hydrolyzed by water, yielding a hydrolyzed, nonreactive form that cannot react efficiently with surface nucleophiles. The direct functional consequence is that C3b produced from this mutant C3 will be unable to form stable covalent bonds with activating surfaces.\n\nWithout covalent deposition, any C3b formed remains in the fluid phase and is rapidly inactivated by regulators such as Factor H and Factor I, preventing the stable recruitment of Factor B and the formation of the surface-bound C3 convertase. As a result, the initiation on surfaces and especially the amplification loop of the alternative pathway fails.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because although the oxyester would be more labile to hydrolysis, this does not cause constitutive, uncontrolled activation; rather, it prevents effective surface deposition, and fluid-phase species are controlled by inhibitors.\n- B is incorrect because even if cleavage to C3a and C3b occurs, the critical function is the covalent binding of C3b to surfaces, which is impaired by the mutation.\n- C is correct: the pathway will fail to amplify efficiently on activating surfaces because C3b cannot form stable covalent bonds via the thioester.\n- D is incorrect because this mutation does not promote classical pathway initiation; C1q binding depends on immune complexes, not on C3 thioester integrity.\n- E is incorrect because the primary effect is not loss of Factor B binding per se; the Factor B binding site resides outside the thioester, and the main deficit is loss of covalent surface anchoring required for effective convertase assembly.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant consequence is the failure of efficient amplification due to loss of covalent attachment of C3b to activating surfaces.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2096939"}]}
