This exercise challenges you to explain why lysozyme is highly effective against some bacteria but not others, grounding your reasoning in the fundamental architectural differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls [@problem_id:2066532]. Mastering this concept is key to understanding the specificities of host-pathogen interactions.", "problem": "A researcher is conducting an experiment to investigate the antimicrobial properties of lysozyme, a key enzyme in the innate immune system found in secretions like tears and saliva. Two different bacterial species are used: *Staphylococcus aureus*, a Gram-positive bacterium, and *Escherichia coli*, a Gram-negative bacterium. The researcher incubates separate, standardized cultures of each bacterium with an identical concentration of purified lysozyme under optimal conditions for enzymatic activity. After the incubation period, microscopic analysis reveals widespread cell lysis and death in the *S. aureus* culture, while the *E. coli* culture appears largely unaffected.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate structural explanation for this differential susceptibility to lysozyme?\n\nA. The outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacterium acts as a physical barrier, preventing lysozyme from reaching its target, the peptidoglycan layer.\n\nB. The peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria is significantly thicker, and this greater volume of target material makes it inherently more vulnerable to complete degradation by lysozyme.\n\nC. Gram-negative bacteria lack the teichoic and lipoteichoic acids that are required for lysozyme to bind to the cell wall.\n\nD. The periplasmic space in Gram-negative bacteria contains specific enzymes that neutralize and degrade lysozyme before it can act on the cell wall.", "solution": "Lysozyme acts by hydrolyzing the $\\beta\\text{-}1,4$ glycosidic bond between $N$-acetylmuramic acid and $N$-acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycan, weakening the cell wall and causing osmotic lysis. Therefore, susceptibility depends on lysozymeâ€™s ability to access the peptidoglycan layer.\n\nGram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus possess a thick, exposed peptidoglycan layer and lack an outer membrane. This makes their peptidoglycan readily accessible to lysozyme, explaining the observed lysis.\n\nGram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli have a thin peptidoglycan layer located in the periplasm, which is shielded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide and porins. This outer membrane functions as a permeability barrier that restricts the entry of many proteins, including lysozyme, thereby preventing lysozyme from reaching its peptidoglycan target under standard conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is correct: it identifies the outer membrane as the physical barrier that blocks lysozyme from accessing peptidoglycan.\n- Option B is incorrect: while Gram-positive peptidoglycan is thicker, susceptibility is due to accessibility, not simply the quantity of substrate.\n- Option C is incorrect: lysozyme acts on the glycan backbone and does not require teichoic or lipoteichoic acids for binding.\n- Option D is not the most accurate structural explanation: although some Gram-negative bacteria have periplasmic lysozyme inhibitors, this is not a general structural property nor the primary reason for resistance; moreover, these inhibitors often inhibit rather than degrade lysozyme.\n\nThus, the most accurate structural explanation is the outer membrane barrier in Gram-negative bacteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066532"}, {"introduction": "Physical and chemical barriers often function as an integrated system, and the failure of one component can compromise the entire defense.

This problem models the resulting impact on the chemical defenses within the airway's static mucus layer.\n\nConsider two scenarios: a healthy individual and a PCD patient. In both, epithelial cells secrete the antimicrobial enzyme lysozyme into the mucus layer at a constant volumetric flux $J_S$ (amount per unit volume per unit time).\n\n1.  **Healthy Individual**: The mucociliary escalator functions normally, clearing mucus and its contents. This clearance process is modeled as a first-order decay with a rate constant $k_{clear}$. For this scenario, assume the bacterial load is negligible, and thus, bacterially-mediated degradation of lysozyme is insignificant.\n\n2.  **PCD Patient**: The mucociliary escalator is non-functional ($k_{clear} = 0$), leading to a static mucus layer. Consequently, a stable, non-replicating bacterial population with a constant concentration $[B]$ is established. These bacteria produce proteases that degrade lysozyme. This degradation process is modeled as a first-order reaction with respect to the lysozyme concentration, $[L]$. The effective first-order rate constant for this degradation is proportional to the bacterial concentration, given by $k_{b} [B]$, where $k_{b}$ is a second-order rate constant.\n\nAssuming both systems have reached a steady state, determine the ratio of the steady-state lysozyme concentration in the PCD patient, $[L]_{PCD, ss}$, to that in the healthy individual, $[L]_{Healthy, ss}$.
