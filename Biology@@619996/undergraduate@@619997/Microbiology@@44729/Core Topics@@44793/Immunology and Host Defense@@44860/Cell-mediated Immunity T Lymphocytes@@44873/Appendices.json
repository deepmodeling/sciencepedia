{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This exercise delves into the fundamental process of T cell development within the thymus, known as thymic selection. By considering a hypothetical patient with Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome, you'll explore the critical role of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules in the positive selection and maturation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [@problem_id:2057903]. Understanding this principle is a key to appreciating how the immune system builds a functional T cell army capable of recognizing and eliminating virally infected cells.", "problem": "A pediatric immunologist is evaluating a young patient presenting with recurrent and severe viral infections, particularly from viruses like influenza and cytomegalovirus. Laboratory analysis reveals a rare genetic disorder known as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type 1. This condition is caused by a mutation that completely prevents the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of all cells, while the expression of MHC class II molecules remains normal. Based on your understanding of T lymphocyte development in the thymus, which of the following immune cell populations would be expected to be almost entirely absent and non-functional in this patient?\n\nA. CD4+ Helper T cells\n\nB. B lymphocytes\n\nC. CD8+ Cytotoxic T cells\n\nD. Natural Killer (NK) cells\n\nE. Dendritic cells", "solution": "The key immunologic principle is thymic selection of T lymphocytes. Immature thymocytes enter the cortex as double-negative cells, progress to double-positive cells expressing both CD4 and CD8, and then undergo positive selection on cortical thymic epithelial cells. Positive selection requires that the T cell receptor recognize self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or MHC class II with appropriate, low-to-moderate affinity; recognition of self-peptide on MHC class I commits the cell to the CD8 lineage, whereas recognition on MHC class II commits the cell to the CD4 lineage. Cells that fail to recognize self-peptide on MHC at all die by neglect.\n\nIn Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type 1, there is a complete absence of MHC class I expression on all cells. In the thymic cortex, this means that double-positive thymocytes cannot receive survival signals through their T cell receptor that would arise from recognizing peptide bound to MHC class I. Consequently, there is no positive selection into the CD8 lineage, and double-positive thymocytes with potential CD8 specificity undergo apoptosis by neglect. Therefore, mature CD8^{+} cytotoxic T lymphocytes are almost entirely absent and non-functional.\n\nBy contrast, MHC class II expression is normal, so positive selection into the CD4 lineage proceeds, and CD4^{+} helper T cells develop normally. B lymphocytes develop in the bone marrow independently of thymic MHC-mediated selection and thus are present; while some functional antiviral responses are impaired due to the absence of CD8^{+} T cells, B cell numbers are not absent. Natural killer cells do not require MHC class I for development in the same way as T cells; although their education involves interactions with self MHC class I and their activity is modulated by the presence or absence of MHC class I on target cells, they are not absent in MHC class I deficiency and may be relatively more active due to the missing-self phenomenon. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells whose development does not depend on thymic selection, and they remain present even if they cannot express MHC class I; they still express MHC class II normally.\n\nTherefore, the immune cell population expected to be almost entirely absent and non-functional in this patient is CD8^{+} cytotoxic T cells.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA. CD4^{+} Helper T cells: develop normally because MHC class II is intact.\nB. B lymphocytes: present; development is independent of thymic MHC class I.\nC. CD8^{+} Cytotoxic T cells: absent due to failed positive selection without MHC class I.\nD. Natural Killer cells: not absent; may show altered function but are present.\nE. Dendritic cells: present; development independent of thymic selection.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2057903"}, {"introduction": "Once a T cell matures, its primary job is to recognize foreign invaders. This problem simulates the action of a modern subunit vaccine to illustrate how the adaptive immune system is first alerted to an external threat [@problem_id:2057886]. You will trace the path of an exogenous antigen as it is taken up by professional antigen-presenting cells and displayed on MHC class II molecules, a process that specifically activates the crucial CD4+ T helper cells that orchestrate the overall immune response.", "problem": "A biotechnology research group is developing a subunit vaccine against a newly discovered infectious agent. The vaccine is composed of a purified peptide that is derived from a protein essential for the pathogen's life cycle. The vaccine is administered with an adjuvant that promotes its uptake by professional Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells. In the subsequent processing within the APCs, this exogenous peptide is loaded exclusively onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules for display on the cell surface.\n\nFollowing the migration of these APCs to the draining lymph nodes, which of the following lymphocyte populations will be *primarily* activated by recognizing this peptide-MHC complex, thereby initiating the specific adaptive immune response?\n\nA. CD4+ T helper cells\n\nB. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)\n\nC. B lymphocytes\n\nD. Natural Killer (NK) cells\n\nE. Mast cells", "solution": "The vaccine provides a purified exogenous peptide delivered with an adjuvant that enhances uptake by professional Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells. By definition, exogenous antigens taken up into the endosomal-lysosomal pathway are processed and loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex class II molecules. This loading occurs in acidified endosomal compartments after removal of the invariant chain and CLIP, facilitated by HLA-DM, yielding peptide–MHC class II complexes transported to the APC surface.\n\nUpon migration to draining lymph nodes, naive T cells survey antigen-bearing dendritic cells. The T cell receptor specificity and co-receptor usage determine which lymphocyte subset is activated by a given MHC class. Peptide–MHC class II complexes are specifically recognized by T cell receptors on CD4 T cells with the CD4 co-receptor binding to nonpolymorphic regions of MHC class II. With appropriate co-stimulation provided by activated dendritic cells (e.g., B7–CD28), naive CD4 T cells become activated and differentiate into helper subsets, initiating and orchestrating the adaptive immune response, including providing help to B cells and licensing other effector functions.\n\nBy contrast, CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize peptides presented on MHC class I, which typically display endogenous antigens synthesized within the cytosol. Although cross-presentation can allow some exogenous antigens to be presented on MHC class I, the problem states the peptide is loaded exclusively onto MHC class II, excluding cross-presentation in this scenario. B lymphocytes recognize native antigen via the B cell receptor rather than peptide–MHC complexes on APCs as the primary activation signal; they subsequently require T cell help. Natural Killer cells are activated by changes in self MHC class I expression and stress ligands, not by peptide–MHC recognition. Mast cells are innate effector cells involved in immediate hypersensitivity and are not primarily activated in lymph nodes by peptide–MHC presentation.\n\nTherefore, the lymphocyte population primarily activated by peptide–MHC class II on APCs is CD4 T helper cells, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2057886"}, {"introduction": "Activating a T cell unleashes a powerful inflammatory response, so the body has built-in safety mechanisms to prevent accidental or autoimmune reactions. This practice problem examines the 'two-signal hypothesis,' a cornerstone of immunology, by exploring a scenario where the T cell receptor receives its antigen signal (Signal 1) without the necessary co-stimulatory signal (Signal 2) [@problem_id:2057842]. Solving this will reveal the important concept of T cell anergy, a state of unresponsiveness that serves as a critical tolerance checkpoint.", "problem": "A researcher is investigating a rare genetic disorder that affects the adaptive immune system. Patients with this disorder exhibit a specific mutation that prevents their T lymphocytes from synthesizing and expressing the CD28 surface protein. All other cellular functions and surface proteins, including the T Cell Receptor (TCR), are normal.\n\nTo study the functional consequence of this defect, the researcher isolates naive T cells from a patient and co-cultures them with professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). These APCs have been pulsed with a specific peptide antigen and are confirmed to be expressing both the appropriate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules presenting the antigen and the co-stimulatory B7 proteins (CD80/CD86). The TCR on the patient's T cells is known to recognize the specific antigen-MHC complex presented by the APCs.\n\nWhat is the most likely immunological outcome for the patient's T cells in this experimental setup?\n\nA. The T cells will undergo full activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation because their TCR successfully recognizes the antigen-MHC complex.\n\nB. The T cells will enter a state of anergy, rendering them functionally unresponsive to subsequent encounters with the antigen.\n\nC. The T cells will immediately undergo apoptosis because the incomplete signaling is interpreted as a \"death\" signal.\n\nD. The T cells will differentiate into memory T cells without undergoing a primary activation, preparing them for a future infection.\n\nE. The T cells will be unaffected and remain in a naive state, as if they had never encountered the APC.", "solution": "T lymphocyte activation requires at least two signals:\n- Signal 1: Antigen-specific recognition via the T Cell Receptor (TCR) engaging peptide presented on MHC of an APC.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulation, classically mediated by CD28 on the T cell binding B7 proteins (CD80/CD86) on the APC.\n\nIn the described setup, the APCs present the correct peptide-MHC complex and express B7, so Signal 1 is available and the co-stimulatory ligands are present. However, the patient’s T cells lack CD28, so they cannot receive Signal 2 despite B7 expression on the APCs.\n\nThe established immunologic principle is that naive T cells that receive Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2 do not undergo full activation; instead, they enter a state of anergy, becoming functionally unresponsive to subsequent antigen encounters. This outcome is distinct from:\n- Full activation with clonal expansion and differentiation (which requires both signals),\n- Immediate apoptosis (which is not the canonical immediate outcome of Signal 1 without Signal 2 in naive T cells; deletion can occur in some contexts but the classic consequence is anergy),\n- Differentiation into memory T cells without primary activation (which does not occur),\n- Remaining naive and unaffected (they do receive Signal 1, which induces tolerance/anergy rather than leaving them unchanged).\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2057842"}]}
