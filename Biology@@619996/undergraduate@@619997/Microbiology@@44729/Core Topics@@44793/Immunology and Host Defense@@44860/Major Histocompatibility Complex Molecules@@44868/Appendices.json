This first exercise explores the critical role of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules in orchestrating the adaptive immune response. By examining a hypothetical scenario based on Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type II, you will deduce the primary immunological failure that occurs when professional antigen-presenting cells cannot express MHC class II, thereby solidifying your understanding of its connection to $CD4^+$ helper T cells [@problem_id:2076598].", "problem": "Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type II is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a failure to transcribe genes encoding Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. Patients with this condition have functionally normal T cells and B cells, but their professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, cannot express MHC class II on their surfaces. Given this specific molecular defect, which of the following represents the most direct and primary failure of the adaptive immune response in these patients?\n\nA. The inability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill virus-infected cells.\n\nB. The failure to activate $CD4^+$ helper T lymphocytes in response to extracellular pathogens.\n\nC. The inability of B cells to act as antigen-presenting cells.\n\nD. The failure of phagocytes to engulf and destroy pathogens.\n\nE. A complete absence of B cell development in the bone marrow.", "solution": "1) State the key immunologic principle: MHC class II molecules are required to present exogenous (extracellular) peptide antigens to $CD4^{+}$ T lymphocytes. Activation of naive $CD4^{+}$ T cells requires at minimum signal 1, which is TCR recognition of peptide bound to MHC class II on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, along with appropriate costimulation.\n\n2) Identify the molecular defect in Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type II: there is a failure to transcribe genes encoding MHC class II molecules (commonly due to defects in transactivators such as CIITA or RFX complex components). Consequently, professional APCs cannot express MHC class II on their surfaces.\n\n3) Deduce the primary functional consequence: without MHC class II on APCs, naive $CD4^{+}$ T cells cannot receive signal 1 via TCR recognition of peptide–MHC class II. Therefore, the most direct and primary failure is the activation of $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes in response to extracellular antigens.\n\n4) Evaluate alternatives:\n- Option A: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize peptides presented by MHC class I, not MHC class II; thus their basic ability to kill virus-infected cells is not the primary defect.\n- Option C: While B cells are APCs that normally require MHC class II to present antigen to $CD4^{+}$ T cells, the most direct and overarching primary failure is the activation of $CD4^{+}$ T cells themselves; impaired B cell antigen presentation is a consequence within the same pathway rather than the principal immunologic failure.\n- Option D: Phagocytosis is an innate function of phagocytes and does not require MHC class II expression; engulfment and killing are not primarily impaired by the transcriptional absence of MHC class II.\n- Option E: B cell development in the bone marrow is not dependent on MHC class II expression; there is no complete absence of B cell development due to this defect.\n\n5) Conclusion: The primary failure is the inability to activate $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes in response to extracellular pathogens.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2076598"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus to the other major antigen presentation pathway. This practice problem delves into the MHC class I system, which is essential for alerting the immune system to intracellular threats like viruses. You will analyze a case involving a partial defect in the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) complex, a key component for loading peptides onto MHC class I molecules. This will challenge you to think about how quantitative, not just qualitative, changes in molecular function can impact an individual's susceptibility to specific pathogens [@problem_id:2076610].", "problem": "The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules are critical for the adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens. In a normal cell, proteins synthesized within the cytoplasm (e.g., viral proteins) are degraded into small peptides. These peptides are then transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by a protein complex called the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). The TAP complex is a heterodimer composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. Inside the endoplasmic reticulum, these peptides bind to MHC class I molecules, which are then trafficked to the cell surface for presentation to $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).\n\nConsider an individual who is heterozygous for a defective allele of the `TAP2` gene. This means they possess one functional `TAP2` allele and one non-functional `TAP2` allele. As a result, their cells produce a reduced quantity of functional TAP complexes, leading to less efficient transport of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum compared to an individual with two functional alleles.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following outcomes is the most likely immunological consequence for this individual?\n\nA. Increased susceptibility to viral infections.\n\nB. Increased susceptibility to infections by extracellular bacteria.\n\nC. A specific inability to activate $CD4^+$ helper T cells.\n\nD. Normal immune function, as the single functional allele provides sufficient compensation.\n\nE. An overactive inflammatory response leading to chronic autoimmunity.", "solution": "Logical steps:\n1) State the pathway and requirement for MHC class I antigen presentation: Endogenous proteins in the cytosol are degraded by the proteasome into peptides. Peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP complex (heterodimer of TAP1 and TAP2). In the ER, peptides bind to MHC class I heavy chain associated with beta-2 microglobulin, stabilizing the complex. Properly loaded MHC class I complexes traffic to the cell surface to present peptides to $CD8^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, enabling recognition and killing of infected cells.\n\n2) Link TAP function to MHC class I surface expression and $CD8^{+}$ T cell responses: Efficient peptide transport by TAP is necessary for stable peptide loading onto MHC class I. Reduced TAP function leads to fewer peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules, decreased stability and surface expression of MHC class I, and impaired activation and effector function of $CD8^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\n\n3) Apply the heterozygous TAP2 defect given in the stem: The problem explicitly stipulates that one non-functional and one functional TAP2 allele results in reduced quantity of functional TAP complexes and less efficient peptide transport. Therefore, there will be a partial reduction in MHC class I peptide loading and surface expression, causing a relative impairment of $CD8^{+}$ T cell–mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens.\n\n4) Infer the immunological consequence most directly affected: Impaired MHC class I presentation and $CD8^{+}$ cytotoxic T cell responses primarily compromise defense against intracellular pathogens, especially viruses, which rely on cell-mediated cytotoxicity for clearance.\n\n5) Exclude incorrect options:\n- B (extracellular bacteria): Primarily handled by humoral immunity and $CD4^{+}$ T cell help via MHC class II; not the principal deficit in reduced TAP function.\n- C ($CD4^{+}$ helper T cells): Activation depends on MHC class II, invariant chain, CLIP, and HLA-DM, not TAP; thus not specifically impaired by TAP2 heterozygosity.\n- D (normal immune function): The stem states there is reduced TAP function and less efficient peptide transport; thus not fully normal.\n- E (overactive inflammation/autoimmunity): A TAP2 reduction would not be expected to cause an overactive inflammatory response; the predicted defect is diminished $CD8^{+}$ responses, not autoimmunity.\n\nConclusion: The most likely consequence is increased susceptibility to viral infections.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2076610"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the distinct functions of the MHC class I and class II pathways, this final problem serves as a powerful synthesis. It presents a comparative scenario between two types of Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome, one affecting the MHC class I pathway and the other affecting the MHC class II pathway. By predicting the resulting T-cell populations in each case, you will connect your knowledge of antigen presentation directly to the fundamental process of T-cell development and positive selection in the thymus, revealing how these molecular pathways shape the entire T-cell repertoire [@problem_id:2076641].", "problem": "Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS) is a group of rare, inherited immunodeficiency disorders characterized by a failure of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to be expressed on the cell surface. Consider two distinct types of this syndrome:\n\n- **Patient A** has BLS Type I. This condition arises from a loss-of-function mutation in genes encoding the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) complex. The TAP complex is responsible for transporting cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- **Patient B** has BLS Type II. This condition is caused by mutations in genes for transcription factors, such as the Class II Transactivator (CIITA), which are essential for the expression of all MHC Class II genes.\n\nAssuming both patients have survived infancy, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of their mature, circulating T-lymphocyte populations as observed in a peripheral blood sample, when compared to a healthy individual?\n\nA.

Their assembly and stable surface expression require peptide loading in the endoplasmic reticulum, which depends on the TAP complex. MHC class I expression is necessary for positive selection of CD8^{+} T cells in the thymus. If MHC class I is absent or markedly reduced, positive selection of CD8^{+} thymocytes fails, leading to a severe deficiency of CD8^{+} T cells in the periphery, while CD4^{+} T cells can remain near normal if MHC class II is intact.\n\nPrinciple 2: MHC class II molecules present peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Expression of MHC class II requires transcriptional activation by factors such as CIITA and the RFX complex. MHC class II expression on thymic epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells is necessary for positive selection and peripheral maintenance of CD4^{+} T cells. If MHC class II is absent, positive selection of CD4^{+} thymocytes fails, causing a severe deficiency of CD4^{+} T cells in the periphery, while CD8^{+} T cells can remain near normal if MHC class I is intact.\n\nApplication to Patient A (BLS Type I, TAP deficiency):\n- Defect: Loss of TAP function impairs peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- Consequence: MHC class I molecules are not properly peptide-loaded, become unstable, and have markedly reduced surface expression.\n- Thymic selection effect: Positive selection of CD8^{+} thymocytes fails due to lack of MHC class I, causing a severe deficiency of CD8^{+} T cells.\n- CD4^{+} T cells: MHC class II pathway is intact; positive selection proceeds, so CD4^{+} T-cell numbers are near normal relative to a healthy individual.\n\nApplication to Patient B (BLS Type II, CIITA or related transcription factor deficiency):\n- Defect: Loss of CIITA-dependent transcription prevents expression of all MHC class II genes.\n- Consequence: Absence of MHC class II on thymic epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells.\n- Thymic selection effect: Positive selection of CD4^{+} thymocytes fails, causing a severe deficiency of CD4^{+} T cells.\n- CD8^{+} T cells: MHC class I pathway is intact; positive selection proceeds, so CD8^{+} T-cell numbers are near normal relative to a healthy individual.\n\nComparison with options:\n- Option A states Patient A is severely deficient in CD8^{+} with near-normal CD4^{+}, and Patient B is severely deficient in CD4^{+} with near-normal CD8^{+}. This matches the mechanistic predictions above.\n- Options B, C, D, and E contradict one or both of the established consequences of the specific MHC pathway deficits on thymic positive selection.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2076641"}]}
