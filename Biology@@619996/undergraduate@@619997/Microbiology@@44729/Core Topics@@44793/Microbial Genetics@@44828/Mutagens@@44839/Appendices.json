This exercise introduces replica plating, a classic and ingenious technique for screening large bacterial populations to isolate mutants with specific nutritional deficiencies, known as auxotrophs. By working through the logic of this method, you will grasp a fundamental screening tool that underpins much of microbial genetics.

The wild-type strain is a prototroph, meaning it can synthesize all its required amino acids, including arginine. The culture is first treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a chemical mutagen known to induce point mutations. After the treatment, the diluted bacterial suspension is spread onto a \"master plate\" containing a complete medium, which provides all essential nutrients including amino acids, vitamins, and nucleotides. Individual colonies are allowed to grow on this master plate.\n\nThe researcher then uses the replica plating technique to transfer colonies from the master plate to two new plates:\n- **Plate A:** A minimal medium plate, which contains only a basic carbon source and inorganic salts necessary for a prototroph to grow.\n- **Plate B:** A minimal medium plate that has been supplemented with only the amino acid arginine.\n\nThe growth patterns of four distinct colonies (labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4) from the master plate are observed on the two replica plates.

The experimental setup uses replica plating to distinguish nutritional requirements: growth on minimal medium indicates prototrophy for all required metabolites; lack of growth on minimal medium but growth on minimal medium supplemented with arginine indicates an arginine auxotroph; lack of growth on both plates indicates a requirement for something not provided on either minimal medium or minimal medium plus arginine (for example, another amino acid, a vitamin, or a general growth defect); growth on minimal medium but not on minimal medium plus arginine is inconsistent with a simple nutritional requirement and most likely reflects a technical artifact or unrelated inhibition, and in any case is not consistent with arginine auxotrophy.\n\nApplying these principles to the observations:\n- Colony 1 grows on both minimal medium (Plate A) and minimal medium plus arginine (Plate B), consistent with a prototroph, not an arginine auxotroph.\n- Colony 2 fails to grow on minimal medium (Plate A) but grows on minimal medium plus arginine (Plate B), which is the diagnostic pattern for an arginine auxotroph.\n- Colony 3 fails to grow on both plates, indicating a requirement not satisfied by the arginine supplement or a general defect; this is not specifically an arginine auxotroph.\n- Colony 4 grows on minimal medium but not on minimal medium plus arginine, which does not match arginine auxotrophy and likely reflects an anomaly unrelated to arginine requirement.\n\nTherefore, the desired arginine auxotroph is Colony 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2081852"}, {"introduction": "Once a mutant is isolated, the next challenge is to determine the type of DNA change that caused its unique phenotype. This problem demonstrates a powerful strategy called reversion analysis, which uses mutagens with known, distinct mechanisms as diagnostic tools. You will analyze how an auxotrophic mutant responds to a base analog versus an intercalating agent, allowing you to deduce the molecular nature of the original mutation. [@problem_id:2081880]", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the nature of mutations in an *Escherichia coli* strain. The investigation begins with a wild-type strain, known as a prototroph, which is capable of synthesizing all its required amino acids and can grow on a minimal medium. The microbiologist isolates a mutant derivative of this strain that is an auxotroph for the amino acid arginine. This auxotrophic strain, designated $arg^-$, fails to grow on the minimal medium unless it is supplemented with arginine.\n\nTo characterize the genetic basis of this $arg^-$ phenotype, the microbiologist conducts a reversion experiment. The goal is to see if the $arg^-$ strain can be mutated back to a prototrophic ($arg^+$) state. A large population of $arg^-$ cells is plated onto two different types of agar plates. Both types of plates contain minimal medium, which lacks arginine, meaning only revertant $arg^+$ cells can form colonies.\n\n- **Plate 1** contains the chemical mutagen 2-aminopurine, which is known to act as a base analog.\n- **Plate 2** contains the chemical mutagen proflavin, which is known to act as an intercalating agent.\n\nAfter incubation, a high frequency of $arg^+$ revertant colonies is observed on Plate 1. In contrast, Plate 2 shows a very low frequency of colonies, comparable to the spontaneous reversion rate observed on a control plate with no mutagen.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what was the most probable type of base-pair change that caused the original $arg^-$ mutation?\n\nA. A transition mutation.\n\nB. A frameshift mutation.\n\nC. A transversion mutation.\n\nD. A large deletion of the gene.\n\nE. An inversion of a segment of the gene.", "solution": "The experimental design uses selection on minimal medium to allow growth only of revertant $arg^{+}$ cells. The two mutagens applied have distinct, well-characterized mutational spectra:\n\n1. 2-aminopurine is a base analog that substitutes for adenine and can mispair; it predominantly induces transition mutations by causing $A\\!:\\!T \\leftrightarrow G\\!:\\!C$ changes through tautomerization-dependent mispairing. Thus, if the original $arg^{-}$ lesion is a base-pair substitution that can be corrected by a transition, exposure to 2-aminopurine during selection will substantially elevate the frequency of true revertants (or intragenic suppressors that restore function via a compatible transition).\n\n2. Proflavin is an intercalating agent that inserts between base pairs and primarily induces single-base insertions or deletions, i.e., frameshift mutations, especially within homopolymeric runs. Consequently, proflavin strongly elevates the reversion frequency only if the original mutation is itself a frameshift that can be compensated by an opposite frameshift nearby, restoring the reading frame.\n\nThe observations are: a high frequency of $arg^{+}$ revertant colonies on the 2-aminopurine plate, but only a low, near-spontaneous frequency on the proflavin plate. This pattern indicates that the mutation is readily reverted by transitions but not by frameshift events. Therefore, the original $arg^{-}$ change was most probably a base-pair substitution of the transition type.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the data: a frameshift mutation would show elevated reversion with proflavin; a transversion would not be efficiently reverted by 2-aminopurine, which does not predominantly induce transversions; large deletions or inversions would very rarely revert to wild type at high frequency under any mutagen and would not be specifically favored by 2-aminopurine.\n\nHence, the most probable original base-pair change is a transition mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2081880"}, {"introduction": "In a real biological system, cells are often exposed to multiple stressors that can damage DNA.
