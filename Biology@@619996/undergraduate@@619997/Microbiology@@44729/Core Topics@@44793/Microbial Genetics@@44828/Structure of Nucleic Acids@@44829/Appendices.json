This exercise simulates a common scenario in microbiology where raw chemical data is used to make a critical deduction about an organism's genetic material. By analyzing the base composition of a sample from a novel microbe, you can apply Chargaff's rules to determine whether a nucleic acid is single-stranded or double-stranded, a key first step in genomic characterization [@problem_id:2095137].", "problem": "A research team studying extremophiles has isolated a novel, unclassified microbe from a highly acidic, geothermal spring. To characterize this organism, they extracted its genetic material and performed a quantitative analysis of its nitrogenous base composition. The results revealed the following molar percentages of the bases:\n\n*   Adenine (A): 27.2%\n*   Guanine (G): 21.0%\n*   Cytosine (C): 33.1%\n*   Thymine (T): 18.7%\n*   Uracil (U): 0.0%\n\nBased on this base composition data, what is the most likely nature of the genetic material of this microbe?\n\nA. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)\n\nB. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)\n\nC. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)\n\nD. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)\n\nE. A mosaic molecule composed of separate single-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA molecules", "solution": "By Watson-Crick base pairing and Chargaff’s rules, a double-stranded nucleic acid must satisfy the complementarity equalities across the entire molecule. Specifically:\n- For double-stranded DNA, base pairing enforces $A=T$ and $G=C$.\n- For double-stranded RNA, base pairing enforces $A=U$ and $G=C$.\n\nFrom the given composition, uracil is absent and thymine is present, i.e., $U=0$ and $T>0$. This is inconsistent with RNA (whether single- or double-stranded), because RNA contains uracil and lacks thymine; thus options C and D are excluded. A mosaic of separate single-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA (option E) would require the presence of uracil from the RNA component; the observation $U=0$ contradicts that possibility, so E is excluded.\n\nTo test double-stranded DNA (option A), we check Chargaff’s equalities. The data indicate $A \\neq T$ and $G \\neq C$, which violates $A=T$ and $G=C$ expected for double-stranded DNA. Therefore, A is excluded.\n\nA single-stranded DNA genome is not constrained by base-pairing complementarity across two strands; hence there is no requirement that $A=T$ or $G=C$. The presence of thymine and absence of uracil are fully consistent with DNA, and the unequal base proportions are characteristic of a single-stranded genome. Therefore, the most likely nature of the genetic material is single-stranded DNA.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2095137"}, {"introduction": "The DNA double helix is defined by two key principles: the specific pairing of complementary bases and the antiparallel alignment of the two strands. This practice provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to apply these rules, a skill essential for understanding DNA replication, repair, and many biotechnological applications like PCR. Given a single DNA strand from a bacteriophage, you will construct its complementary partner, reinforcing the fundamental geometry of genetic information [@problem_id:2095153].", "problem": "Researchers at a microbiology lab are studying a newly discovered bacteriophage, tentatively named *Bacillus phage Gamma-7*, which infects *Bacillus subtilis*.

Guanine-Cytosine ($G-C$) pairs are held by three hydrogen bonds, while Adenine-Thymine ($A-T$) pairs are held by two, making $G-C$ rich regions more thermally stable. This exercise bridges the gap between the abstract concept of base pairing and the tangible physical properties of DNA by tasking you with calculating the total number of hydrogen bonds holding a short DNA fragment together [@problem_id:2095132].", "problem": "A microbiologist is analyzing a short DNA fragment isolated from the genome of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*.

The total number of hydrogen bonds is the sum of the bonds from all the Adenine-Thymine (A-T) pairs and all the Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pairs.\n\nThe formula for the total number of hydrogen bonds is:\nTotal H-bonds = (Number of G-C pairs $\\times$ 3) + (Number of A-T pairs $\\times$ 2)\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to determine the number of G-C pairs and A-T pairs in the double-stranded DNA fragment. We are given the sequence of a single strand: 5'-AGCTTGACGTAT-3'. The fragment is 12 bases long, so it consists of 12 base pairs.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of G-C pairs. In a double helix, a G on one strand pairs with a C on the opposite strand, and a C on one strand pairs with a G. Therefore, the total number of G-C pairs is equal to the sum of all guanine and cytosine bases on one of the strands.\nLet's count the number of G and C bases in the given sequence: 5'-A**GCT**T**G**A**CG**TAT-3'.\n-   Number of Guanine (G) bases = 3\n-   Number of Cytosine (C) bases = 2\nThe total number of G-C base pairs is the sum of these counts:\nNumber of G-C pairs = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nNext, let's find the number of A-T pairs. Similarly, an A on one strand pairs with a T on the opposite strand, and a T on one strand pairs with an A. The total number of A-T pairs is equal to the sum of all adenine and thymine bases on a single strand.\nLet's count the number of A and T bases in the given sequence: 5'-**A**GC**TT**G**A**CG**TAT**-3'.\n-   Number of Adenine (A) bases = 4\n-   Number of Thymine (T) bases = 3\nThe total number of A-T base pairs is the sum of these counts:\nNumber of A-T pairs = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nAs a verification, the total number of base pairs is the sum of G-C pairs and A-T pairs: 5 + 7 = 12, which matches the length of the sequence.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the formula for the total number of hydrogen bonds:\nTotal H-bonds = (5 $\\times$ 3) + (7 $\\times$ 2)\nTotal H-bonds = 15 + 14\nTotal H-bonds = 29.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the DNA fragment is 29.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{29}$$", "id": "2095132"}]}
