The goal is to determine the frequency at which a kanamycin resistance gene ($kan^R$) is transferred from a donor strain to a recipient strain.\n\nThe donor strain is $kan^R$ (kanamycin-resistant) and $str^S$ (streptomycin-sensitive). The recipient strain is $kan^S$ (kanamycin-sensitive) and $str^R$ (streptomycin-resistant).\n\nThe experiment proceeds in two main parts:\n\n1.  **Quantification of Recipient Cells**: To determine the concentration of the recipient bacterial culture, the student performs a serial dilution. A 100 µL volume from the 10⁻⁶ dilution tube is spread onto a non-selective agar plate. After incubation, 145 colonies are counted. These colonies are referred to as Colony-Forming Units (CFU).\n\n2.  **Transduction and Selection**: The student mixes 0.75 mL of the undiluted recipient culture with 0.25 mL of the P1 phage lysate that was prepared on the donor strain. After a brief incubation period to allow for phage infection, the entire 1.00 mL mixture is plated onto a selective agar plate containing both kanamycin and streptomycin. Kanamycin selects for cells that have received the $kan^R$ gene, while streptomycin eliminates any surviving donor cells. Following incubation of this selective plate, 219 colonies are counted.\n\nCalculate the frequency of transduction, which is the ratio of the number of transduced cells to the total number of recipient cells initially present in the transduction mixture.

This practice [@problem_id:2071213] combines the power of cotransduction mapping to determine relative gene order with the precision of deletion mapping to locate a specific point mutation. By analyzing which combinations of donor and recipient DNA can or cannot recombine to produce a wild-type gene, you will engage in the logical deduction that is central to fine-structure genetic analysis.", "problem": "Researchers in a synthetic biology lab are working to optimize the production of a novel therapeutic peptide in *Escherichia coli*. The synthesis of this peptide is dependent on a single gene, *pepA*. They have isolated a mutant strain, designated *pepA1*, which carries a single point mutation rendering the *pepA* gene non-functional. To engineer a fix, they must first precisely locate this mutation. They perform two types of generalized transduction experiments using Bacteriophage P1.\n\n**Experiment 1: Cotransduction Mapping**\nTo determine the arrangement of genes neighboring *pepA*, a P1 lysate was prepared from a wild-type donor strain with the genotype $metB^+ pepA^+ thrC^+ argH^+$. This lysate was used to transduce a recipient strain that is auxotrophic for all four markers ($metB^- pepA^- thrC^- argH^-$). Transductants were selected for the $metB^+$ marker, and then screened for the unselected markers *pepA*, *thrC*, and *argH*. The cotransduction frequencies were recorded as follows:\n- *metB* and *pepA*: 90%\n- *metB* and *thrC*: 45%\n- *metB* and *argH*: 2%\n\n**Experiment 2: Deletion Mapping**\nTo pinpoint the location of the *pepA1* point mutation within the *pepA* gene, the gene was conceptually divided into three contiguous, non-overlapping segments of equal size: *pepA_L* (the \"left\" segment, closest to the *metB* gene), *pepA_M* (the middle segment), and *pepA_R* (the \"right\" segment, closest to the *thrC* gene).\n\nA P1 lysate was prepared from the *pepA1* mutant strain. This lysate was then used to transduce four different recipient strains. Each recipient strain carried a different, well-characterized deletion affecting the *pepA* gene region. The researchers scored whether wild-type ($pepA^+$) recombinants could be formed in each cross. The deletions and results are summarized below:\n\n| Recipient Deletion Strain | Description of Deleted Region | Formation of $pepA^+$ Recombinants |\n| :---: | :--- | :---: |\n| Δ1 | The entire *pepA_L* segment. | Yes |\n| Δ2 | The entire *pepA_R* segment. | Yes |\n| Δ3 | The entire *pepA_L* and *pepA_M* segments. | No |\n| Δ4 | The entire *pepA_M* and *pepA_R* segments. | No |\n\nBased on the combined results of both experiments, in which segment of the *pepA* gene is the *pepA1* mutation located?\n\nA. *pepA_L*\n\nB. *pepA_M*\n\nC. *pepA_R*\n\nD. The data from the two experiments are contradictory.\n\nE. The mutation is located outside of the *pepA* gene.", "solution": "Principle for Experiment 1 (P1 cotransduction mapping): With generalized transduction by P1, the cotransduction frequency between two markers decreases monotonically with the physical distance between them because P1 packages a limited DNA length. Thus, higher cotransduction implies closer proximity. Let $f_{\\text{cot}}(X,Y)$ denote the cotransduction frequency and $d(X,Y)$ the map distance. Then $f_{\\text{cot}}(X,Y)$ is inversely related to $d(X,Y)$.\n\nGiven $f_{\\text{cot}}(\\text{metB},\\text{pepA})=0.90$, $f_{\\text{cot}}(\\text{metB},\\text{thrC})=0.45$, and $f_{\\text{cot}}(\\text{metB},\\text{argH})=0.02$, we infer\n$$\nd(\\text{metB},\\text{pepA})<d(\\text{metB},\\text{thrC})\\ll d(\\text{metB},\\text{argH}).\n$$\nTherefore, *pepA* lies very close to *metB*, and *thrC* is farther from *metB* than *pepA*. This is consistent with the stated orientation that within *pepA*, the segment *pepA_L* is the side closest to *metB* and *pepA_R* is the side closest to *thrC*.\n\nPrinciple for Experiment 2 (deletion mapping with a donor carrying a point mutation): Let the position of the point mutation *pepA1* within *pepA* be $x$, and let the three non-overlapping gene segments be $L$, $M$, and $R$ (corresponding to *pepA_L*, *pepA_M*, *pepA_R*). In a transduction using donor DNA that carries the point mutation, a $pepA^{+}$ recombinant can be formed only if the deleted region in the recipient does not include the mutation site $x$. Formally, if a recipient deletion removes a set $D\\subseteq\\{L,M,R\\}$, then:\n- If $x\\in D$, any recombinant that restores the deletion with donor DNA will import the mutant base at $x$, yielding no $pepA^{+}$ recombinants.\n- If $x\\notin D$, recombination can restore the deleted region from donor DNA while leaving the site $x$ in the recipient-derived (wild-type) portion, allowing $pepA^{+}$ recombinants.\n\nApply this to the four deletions:\n- $\\Delta 1$ deletes $L$ and yields Yes. Therefore $x\\notin L$.\n- $\\Delta 2$ deletes $R$ and yields Yes. Therefore $x\\notin R$.\n- $\\Delta 3$ deletes $L\\cup M$ and yields No. Therefore $x\\in L\\cup M$.\n- $\\Delta 4$ deletes $M\\cup R$ and yields No. Therefore $x\\in M\\cup R$.\n\nCombine the constraints:\nFrom $x\\notin L$ and $x\\in L\\cup M$, it follows that $x\\in M$.\nFrom $x\\notin R$ and $x\\in M\\cup R$, it follows that $x\\in M$.\nBoth pairs consistently locate the mutation in $M$.\n\nConclusion: The point mutation *pepA1* resides in the middle segment, *pepA_M*, which is consistent with the cotransduction-based orientation relative to *metB* and *thrC*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2071213"}]}
