One of the most critical moments in chemical transformation is the heat shock, which creates a thermal imbalance to help drive DNA into the cell. This practice [@problem_id:2071578] challenges you to predict the outcome of an experiment where this step is forgotten, forcing you to consider the physical principles that govern DNA uptake.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is performing a chemical transformation to introduce a plasmid into a laboratory strain of *Escherichia coli*. The plasmid carries a gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, while the *E. coli* strain is initially susceptible to ampicillin.\n\nThe student follows a standard protocol. First, the *E. coli* cells are made chemically competent by suspending them in a cold solution of calcium chloride ($\\text{CaCl}_2$) and incubating them on ice. Then, the plasmid DNA is added to the competent cells.\n\nThe protocol then calls for a \"heat shock\" step. The student prepares two identical tubes of the cell/plasmid mixture:\n- **Tube C (Control):** This tube is subjected to the standard heat shock procedure. It is moved from the ice bath to a 42°C water bath for 45 seconds, and then immediately placed back on ice.\n- **Tube E (Experimental):** The student forgets to perform the heat shock step for this tube. It remains on ice for the entire duration that Tube C is being processed.\n\nFollowing these steps, both tubes undergo a short recovery incubation in a nutrient broth without antibiotics. Finally, an equal volume of culture from each tube is spread onto separate sterile petri dishes containing Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with ampicillin. The plates are incubated overnight at 37°C.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected result on the plate corresponding to Tube E, when compared to the plate for Tube C?\n\nA. The number of colonies will be significantly greater than on the control plate.\nB. The number of colonies will be close to zero.\nC. The number of colonies will be approximately the same as on the control plate.\nD. A continuous lawn of bacterial growth will cover the plate.", "solution": "Let the number of viable cells plated from each tube be $N_{0}$. Let $\\eta$ denote the transformation efficiency, defined as the fraction of cells that successfully take up and express the plasmid-encoded ampicillin resistance gene after the protocol. On plates containing ampicillin, only transformed cells form colonies; non-transformed cells are killed by the antibiotic. Therefore, the expected colony count on each plate is proportional to the number of transformed cells:\n$$\nN_{\\text{colonies}} = N_{0}\\,\\eta.\n$$\nUnder chemical transformation, the heat shock step at approximately $42\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ transiently increases membrane permeability and drives DNA uptake due to a thermal and ionic imbalance across the membrane. Thus:\n- For Tube C (proper heat shock), $\\eta_{C} > 0$, yielding a nonzero number of colonies.\n- For Tube E (no heat shock), the plasmid remains largely outside the cells; $\\eta_{E} \\approx 0$, so\n$$\nN_{\\text{colonies,E}} = N_{0}\\,\\eta_{E} \\approx 0.\n$$\nBecause only cells that acquired the plasmid can grow on ampicillin plates, the absence of heat shock leads to an expected colony count close to zero. A larger number than the control (option A) would require $\\eta_{E} > \\eta_{C}$, which contradicts the role of heat shock. Approximately the same number (option C) would require $\\eta_{E} \\approx \\eta_{C}$, also inconsistent. A lawn (option D) would require widespread growth of non-transformed cells, which is prevented by ampicillin selection. Therefore, the expected outcome for Tube E is that the number of colonies will be close to zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2071578"}, {"introduction": "Successfully getting a plasmid into a bacterium is only half the battle. This new genetic information must be transcribed and translated into a functional protein for the cell to exhibit a new trait, such as antibiotic resistance. This exercise [@problem_id:2071615] explores the crucial 'recovery' period after heat shock, highlighting the fundamental delay between acquiring a gene and expressing its phenotype.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is performing an artificial transformation experiment to introduce a plasmid, named pAMP, into a strain of *Escherichia coli* that is naturally sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The pAMP plasmid carries the *ampR* gene, which confers resistance to ampicillin. The standard protocol involves making the *E. coli* cells chemically competent, mixing them with the pAMP plasmid, and performing a heat shock to facilitate plasmid uptake. Following the heat shock, the protocol specifies adding a nutrient-rich, antibiotic-free liquid broth and incubating the cells for one hour at 37°C before plating them on agar plates containing ampicillin.\n\nIn a rush to finish the experiment, the researcher skips the one-hour incubation in nutrient broth. Instead, immediately after the heat shock step, they plate the bacterial suspension directly onto the ampicillin-containing agar plates. The next day, the researcher observes that virtually no bacterial colonies have grown on the plates, even though a control plate (with no ampicillin) shows robust growth from the same procedure. Assuming the plasmid DNA was viable and the cells were made competent correctly, what is the most probable scientific explanation for the failure of the experiment on the selective media?\n\nA. The heat shock procedure damages the *E. coli* outer membrane, and without the recovery period, the cells cannot attach to the agar surface.\nB. The ampicillin in the agar plates cannot be effective without first being activated by components secreted by the bacteria during the recovery phase.\nC. The process of taking up the plasmid DNA is reversible, and most cells expelled the plasmid before they could be plated.\nD. The bacteria required the recovery period to transcribe the *ampR* gene and translate it into the resistance protein before being exposed to ampicillin.\nE. The nutrient broth contains essential cofactors that must bind to the plasmid's *ampR* gene for it to function correctly.", "solution": "The standard chemical transformation workflow has two mechanistic components that are crucial for successful selection:\n1) DNA uptake: The heat shock transiently increases membrane permeability so plasmid DNA can enter the cytoplasm. This happens during or immediately after the heat shock.\n2) Expression of selectable marker: The resistance gene on the plasmid (here, the *ampR* gene, encoding a beta-lactamase) must be transcribed and translated to produce sufficient functional enzyme. Beta-lactamase acts in the periplasm/extracellular milieu to inactivate ampicillin. This expression and accumulation require time in a nonselective, nutrient-rich medium so that the cells can recover from stress and produce enough resistance protein before encountering the antibiotic.\n\nWhen the recovery step is skipped and cells are plated directly on ampicillin, even cells that have taken up the plasmid lack sufficient beta-lactamase at the moment of exposure and are killed by ampicillin, leading to few or no colonies. The robust growth on the nonselective control plate is consistent with viable cells that do not need resistance to survive; thus, the competent state and general viability are intact.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: attachment to agar is not the limiting factor; cells readily form colonies on nonselective plates, as observed.\n- B is incorrect: ampicillin is an active beta-lactam and does not require bacterial secretions for activation.\n- C is incorrect: plasmid uptake is not generally reversible in the manner suggested; loss of plasmid immediately after heat shock is not the principal cause of failure.\n- D is correct: the recovery period is required for transcription and translation of the *ampR* gene and accumulation of functional beta-lactamase prior to antibiotic exposure.\n- E is incorrect: no special cofactors from the broth are required to bind the gene; expression machinery is cellular, and the broth simply provides time and nutrients for recovery and gene expression.\n\nTherefore, the most probable scientific explanation is that the bacteria needed the recovery period to express the ampicillin resistance gene before exposure to the antibiotic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2071615"}, {"introduction": "For a genetic modification to be meaningful, it must be stable and heritable. In the context of plasmids, this stability is not guaranteed; it depends on specific DNA sequences that interact with the host cell's machinery. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2071598] investigates the fate of a plasmid lacking a vital component—the origin of replication—forcing an examination of how extrachromosomal DNA is maintained and propagated during cell division.", "problem": "In a molecular biology experiment, a student attempts to clone a gene into *Escherichia coli*. The student successfully ligates their gene of interest into a circular piece of double-stranded DNA. However, they mistakenly use a DNA fragment that lacks a bacterial origin of replication (*ori*). The student then proceeds to introduce this circular DNA into a population of competent *E. coli* cells through transformation. Initial tests confirm that a single bacterial cell has successfully taken up one copy of this engineered, circular DNA molecule. This transformed bacterium is then placed in a rich growth medium and allowed to undergo binary fission for many generations.\n\nAssuming the circular DNA is not degraded and does not integrate into the host chromosome, which of the following statements best describes the fate of this circular DNA within the bacterial population after a large number of cell divisions?\n\nA. The circular DNA will be replicated along with the chromosome and passed on to all daughter cells, resulting in a stable population where every cell contains the DNA.\nB. The circular DNA will be actively secreted from the cells, leading to its complete removal from the entire bacterial culture.\nC. The original circular DNA molecule will be passed to only one of the two daughter cells at each division, leading to its rapid dilution from the growing population.\nD. The circular DNA will trigger a host defense mechanism that causes the immediate death of any cell that contains it.\nE. The circular DNA will spontaneously mutate to generate a functional origin of replication, allowing it to propagate throughout the population.", "solution": "Key biological principle: maintenance of an extrachromosomal DNA molecule in bacteria requires a functional origin of replication (ori) to recruit the host replication machinery and a partitioning mechanism for stable inheritance. A circular double-stranded DNA lacking a bacterial ori will not replicate autonomously in Escherichia coli. If it does not integrate into the chromosome and is not degraded, its copy number remains one, and it segregates stochastically at cell division.\n\nLogical consequences:\n1) Absence of ori implies no autonomous replication. Therefore, the number of copies of the circular DNA in the entire culture remains constant at one, provided it is never degraded or integrated.\n2) During binary fission, with only a single DNA molecule present and no replication, at most one daughter can inherit the molecule. Thus, at each division, exactly one daughter cell carries the molecule and the other does not, assuming perfect retention in one daughter as per the problem’s constraints.\n3) Let $N(n)$ be the total number of cells after $n$ generations and $C(n)$ be the number of cells carrying the DNA. Starting from a single transformed cell:\n- Total cells: $N(n) = 2^{n}$.\n- DNA copies: still $1$, so $C(n) = 1$ if the molecule is retained in exactly one lineage.\n- Fraction of cells with the DNA: $f(n) = \\frac{C(n)}{N(n)} = \\frac{1}{2^{n}} \\to 0$ as $n$ becomes large.\nThis represents rapid dilution of the DNA-containing cells in the expanding population.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is false because replication requires a functional ori; in its absence, the DNA will not be replicated or stably inherited by all daughter cells.\n- B is false because there is no general mechanism for active secretion of such DNA from cells into the medium that would purge it from the culture.\n- C is correct: with no replication and no integration, only one daughter can inherit the single DNA molecule per division, so the fraction of DNA-containing cells decreases as $2^{-n}$ over generations.\n- D is false: while host defenses can degrade foreign DNA, the problem explicitly states the DNA is not degraded and does not cause immediate cell death.\n- E is not the best description: although mutations occur, the spontaneous acquisition of a fully functional ori that supports propagation is extraordinarily unlikely and cannot account for the typical fate of the DNA in the population.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that the DNA is inherited by only one daughter per division and is rapidly diluted from the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2071598"}]}
