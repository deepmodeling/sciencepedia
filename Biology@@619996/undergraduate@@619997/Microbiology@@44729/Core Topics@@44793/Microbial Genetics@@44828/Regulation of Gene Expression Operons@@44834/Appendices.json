[@problem_id:2090992]", "problem": "A newly discovered bacterium, *Pseudomonas saccharophila*, is capable of metabolizing the complex sugar galacturonate. The genes required for this metabolic pathway are organized into an inducible operon, termed the *galu* operon. This operon is under negative control. A regulatory gene, *galuR*, located elsewhere on the chromosome, produces a repressor protein that is active in its default state. In the absence of galacturonate, this repressor protein binds to a specific DNA sequence called the operator, which is located between the promoter and the structural genes (*galuA*, *galuB*, *galuC*), thereby blocking transcription. The presence of galacturonate (or one of its metabolites) serves as an inducer, which binds to the repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents it from binding to the operator.\n\nA research team creates a mutant strain of *P. saccharophila* in which the entire operator DNA sequence of the *galu* operon has been precisely deleted, leaving the promoter and the structural genes intact. Which of the following statements best describes the expression of the structural genes *galuA*, *galuB*, and *galuC* in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The structural genes will be expressed continuously, regardless of the presence or absence of galacturonate.\n\nB. The structural genes will never be expressed, regardless of the presence or absence of galacturonate.\n\nC. The expression of the structural genes will still be inducible by galacturonate, but the maximum level of expression will be significantly lower than in the wild-type strain.\n\nD. The expression of the structural genes will be repressible by galacturonate, meaning they are expressed only in its absence.\n\nE. The expression of the structural genes will remain unchanged from the wild-type, being expressed only in the presence of galacturonate.", "solution": "- The *galu* operon is under negative control: the regulatory gene *galuR* encodes a repressor that is active by default and binds the operator to block RNA polymerase progression from promoter to structural genes, thereby preventing transcription in the absence of inducer. This is the standard mechanism where an inducer (galacturonate or a metabolite) binds the repressor, alters its conformation, and prevents operator binding, allowing transcription (inducible expression).\n\n- The operator is a *cis*-acting DNA sequence located between the promoter and the structural genes. Its presence is required for the repressor to exert its inhibitory effect. The repressor protein is *trans*-acting and requires the operator site to bind and block transcription.\n\n- In the mutant described, the operator DNA sequence is precisely deleted while the promoter and structural genes remain intact. Therefore:\n  1) The repressor (from *galuR*) has no binding site and cannot bind DNA at the operon.\n  2) RNA polymerase can access the promoter and transcribe the structural genes without obstruction.\n  3) Because the repression mechanism is eliminated, expression no longer depends on the presence of galacturonate; the inducer cannot further increase expression beyond the promoter’s intrinsic activity because repression is already absent.\n\n- Consequently, expression of *galuA*, *galuB*, and *galuC* becomes constitutive (continuous) and is independent of the inducer. This mirrors the classic operator-constitutive (Oc) phenotype known from the *lac* operon.\n\n- Evaluating options:\n  A. Constitutive expression regardless of inducer — correct.\n  B. Never expressed — incorrect; promoter is intact and repression is impossible.\n  C. Still inducible but with lower maximum — incorrect; no repression remains to be relieved.\n  D. Repressible by galacturonate — incorrect; reverses logic of negative inducible control.\n  E. Unchanged from wild-type (only in presence of inducer) — incorrect; repression cannot occur in the mutant.\n\nTherefore, the best description is constitutive expression regardless of galacturonate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090992"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression is often fine-tuned by multiple layers of regulation. The famous *lac* operon is a classic example, employing both a repressor that acts as a 'brake' and an activator that functions as an 'accelerator'. This exercise challenges you to analyze the system when the activator's binding site is deleted, helping you distinguish between the low, basal level of transcription and the fully activated state. [@problem_id:2090924]", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic example of gene regulation. The expression of its structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*), which are involved in lactose metabolism, is controlled by two primary mechanisms. The first is negative control via the LacI repressor protein, which binds to the operator region to block transcription in the absence of lactose. When lactose is present, its isomer allolactose binds to the LacI repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator. The second mechanism is positive control via the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). In the absence of glucose, cellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) are high. The cAMP-CAP complex binds to a specific DNA sequence called the CAP binding site, located just upstream of the promoter. This binding event significantly enhances the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, leading to a high level of transcription.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a genetic deletion completely removing the CAP binding site from the *lac* operon's regulatory region. All other components of the operon and its regulatory proteins (including the promoter, operator, and the genes for LacI and CAP) are fully functional.\n\nIf this mutant strain is cultured in a growth medium that contains an abundance of lactose but is completely devoid of glucose, which of the following statements best describes the resulting level of transcription of the *lac* operon's structural genes?\n\nA. The operon will be fully induced and transcribed at the maximum possible rate.\n\nB. The operon will be completely silent, with no transcription occurring.\n\nC. The operon will be transcribed at a very low, basal level.\n\nD. The operon will become constitutively active, meaning it is transcribed at a high rate regardless of the presence of lactose or glucose.", "solution": "The *lac* operon is regulated by two mechanisms:\n- Negative control by LacI: in the absence of lactose, LacI binds the operator and blocks RNA polymerase; in the presence of lactose, allolactose binds LacI, preventing operator binding and lifting repression.\n- Positive control by the cAMP-CAP complex: in the absence of glucose, cAMP levels are high and cAMP-CAP binds the CAP site upstream of the promoter, increasing RNA polymerase recruitment and driving high transcription.\n\nIn the mutant described, the CAP binding site is deleted, while the promoter, operator, LacI, and CAP are intact and functional.\n\nUnder the given conditions (abundant lactose, no glucose):\n1. Lactose present implies allolactose binds LacI, so LacI cannot bind the operator. Therefore, negative repression is relieved and the operator is accessible to RNA polymerase.\n2. No glucose implies high cAMP and active CAP; however, the CAP binding site is absent, so the cAMP-CAP complex cannot bind DNA to stimulate transcription.\n\nWithout CAP-mediated activation, RNA polymerase must rely on the intrinsic (weak) *lac* promoter. Because repression is lifted but positive activation cannot occur, transcription proceeds only at the low, basal level characteristic of the unactivated promoter.\n\nTherefore, the operon is not fully induced (ruling out A), not completely silent because repression is relieved (ruling out B), and not constitutively high because positive activation is impossible and transcription still depends on lactose to relieve repression (ruling out D).

The following mutant alleles are also known:\n- *I*⁻: Produces a non-functional repressor that cannot bind to the operator.\n- *O*ᶜ (constitutive operator): A mutant operator sequence to which even a functional repressor cannot bind.\n- *Z*⁻: Produces a non-functional $\\beta$-galactosidase enzyme.\n\nThe microbiologist constructs a partial diploid (merozygote) strain of *E. coli* with the following genotype, where the first part represents the bacterial chromosome and the second part is carried on an F' plasmid:\n\n$I^+ O^c Z^- / F' I^- O^+ Z^+$\n\nAssume that the inducer, when present, functions by binding to the repressor protein and preventing it from binding to the operator.

The key principle is to distinguish between *cis*-acting elements (like the operator, *O*), which only affect genes on the same DNA molecule, and *trans*-acting factors (like the repressor protein product of the *I* gene), which can diffuse through the cytoplasm and act on any DNA molecule in the cell.\n\nThe genotype of the merozygote is $I^+ O^c Z^- / F' I^- O^+ Z^+$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gene products and their properties.**\n- The chromosome has an $I^+$ allele. This allele is transcribed and translated to produce a functional repressor protein. This protein is a *trans*-acting factor, meaning it can travel throughout the cell.\n- The F' plasmid has an $I^-$ allele, which produces a non-functional repressor protein.\n- The cell will therefore contain a mixture of functional and non-functional repressor proteins. However, the presence of the functional repressor from the $I^+$ allele is dominant. It is capable of binding to any wild-type operator (*O*⁺) in the cell.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expression from the bacterial chromosome ($I^+ O^c Z^-$).**\n- This DNA molecule has a constitutive operator allele, $O^c$. By definition, the functional repressor protein (produced by the $I^+$ allele) cannot bind to the $O^c$ operator.\n- Because the repressor cannot bind, transcription from this DNA strand is always \"on,\" regardless of the presence or absence of an inducer.\n- The structural gene for $\\beta$-galactosidase on this chromosome is $Z^-$. This allele produces a non-functional version of the enzyme.\n- **Conclusion for the chromosome:** A non-functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced constitutively (i.e., in both the presence and absence of the inducer). This strand can never be the source of a functional enzyme.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expression from the F' plasmid ($I^- O^+ Z^+$).**\n- This DNA molecule has a wild-type operator, $O^+$. This operator can be bound by the functional repressor protein that is present in the cell (produced by the chromosomal $I^+$ allele).\n- This plasmid has the $Z^+$ allele, which codes for functional $\\beta$-galactosidase. Therefore, the production of functional enzyme in the cell depends entirely on the transcriptional regulation of this plasmid.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the two conditions for the entire cell.**\n\n**Condition 1: Absence of an inducer.**\n- In the absence of an inducer, the functional repressor protein (from the chromosome's $I^+$ allele) is active.\n- This repressor will bind to the wild-type operator, $O^+$, located on the F' plasmid.\n- This binding blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the downstream structural genes, including the $Z^+$ gene.\n- As a result, no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is synthesized from the F' plasmid.\n- Since the chromosome only produces a non-functional ($Z^-$) protein, the net result for the cell is that **no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced.**\n\n**Condition 2: Presence of an inducer.**\n- In the presence of an inducer, the inducer molecules bind to the functional repressor protein.\n- This binding causes a conformational change in the repressor, inactivating it and preventing it from binding to the operator DNA.\n- Consequently, the repressor cannot bind to the $O^+$ operator on the F' plasmid.\n- With the operator site free, RNA polymerase can transcribe the $Z^+$ gene.\n- This leads to the translation and production of **functional $\\beta$-galactosidase.**\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n- In the absence of an inducer, no functional enzyme is made.\n- In the presence of an inducer, a functional enzyme is made.\n- Therefore, functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is synthesized only in the presence of an inducer.
