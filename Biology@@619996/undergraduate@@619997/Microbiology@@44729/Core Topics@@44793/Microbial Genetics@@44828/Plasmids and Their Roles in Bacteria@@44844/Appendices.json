This exercise challenges you to interpret a common sight in the lab: multiple bands arising from a single, pure plasmid sample run on an agarose gel. By understanding how a plasmid's three-dimensional shape, or conformation, dictates its speed through the gel matrix, you will learn to identify the supercoiled, nicked, and linear forms, a crucial skill for assessing the integrity of your DNA.

To verify the integrity of the plasmid DNA after an extraction procedure, the researcher loads a sample from the pure plasmid preparation into a well of an agarose gel and performs electrophoresis. After the run, the gel is stained with a DNA-binding fluorescent dye and visualized. Three distinct bands of DNA are observed in the lane corresponding to the plasmid sample. These bands represent three different physical conformations (topoisomers) of the same plasmid molecule that arise naturally during the purification and handling process.\n\nThe bands are designated by their migration distance from the loading well:\n-   **Band 1:** The band that traveled the farthest through the gel (i.e., the fastest migrating band).\n-   **Band 2:** The band with an intermediate migration distance.\n-   **Band 3:** The band that traveled the shortest distance through the gel (i.e., the slowest migrating band).\n\nThe three primary conformations of a plasmid are known as **supercoiled**, **linear**, and **nicked** (also called open-circular).\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the plasmid conformation corresponding to each of the three observed bands?\n\nA.
