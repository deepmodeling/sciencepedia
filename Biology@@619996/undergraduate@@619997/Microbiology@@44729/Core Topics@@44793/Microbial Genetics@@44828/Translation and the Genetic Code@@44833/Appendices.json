This exercise challenges you to apply the fundamental rules of RNA base pairing and antiparallelism to determine the sequence of an initiator tRNA's anticodon. Mastering this core concept is essential for understanding how the genetic blueprint is faithfully translated into functional protein [@problem_id:2102413].", "problem": "In a microbiology lab, a student is studying the mechanism of protein synthesis initiation in the prokaryote *Escherichia coli*. The student knows that translation begins when the ribosome assembles on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule and the first transfer RNA (tRNA) binds to the start codon. In prokaryotes, this initial tRNA carries a modified amino acid, N-formylmethionine. Given that the primary start codon on the mRNA is composed of the nucleotides Adenine, Uracil, and Guanine, what is the sequence of the corresponding anticodon on the initiator tRNA?\n\nThe sequence should be written in the standard 5' to 3' direction.\n\nA. 5'-AUG-3'\n\nB. 5'-GUA-3'\n\nC. 5'-UAC-3'\n\nD. 5'-CAU-3'\n\nE. 5'-CAT-3'", "solution": "The process of translating the genetic code from messenger RNA (mRNA) into a protein involves the interaction between codons on the mRNA and anticodons on transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.\n\nFirst, we must identify the sequence of the start codon on the mRNA. The problem states that the primary start codon is composed of Adenine, Uracil, and Guanine. The standard start codon in virtually all organisms, including *E. coli*, is 5'-AUG-3'. This codon specifies the amino acid methionine. In prokaryotic initiation, it specifically codes for N-formylmethionine.\n\nNext, we determine the sequence of the anticodon on the tRNA that recognizes this codon. The codon on the mRNA and the anticodon on the tRNA bind to each other through complementary base pairing. The rules for base pairing in RNA are:\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U).\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).\n\nThe two strands (codon and anticodon) also align in an antiparallel fashion. This means that the 5' end of one strand aligns with the 3' end of the other.\n\nLet's write down the mRNA codon and determine its complementary, antiparallel anticodon:\n\nmRNA codon: 5' - A U G - 3'\n\nTo find the anticodon sequence, we pair each base and reverse the directionality:\n- The base complementary to A (at the 5' end of the codon) is U. This U will be at the 3' end of the anticodon.\n- The base complementary to U (in the middle of the codon) is A. This A will be in the middle of the anticodon.\n- The base complementary to G (at the 3' end of the codon) is C. This C will be at the 5' end of the anticodon.\n\nSo, the anticodon sequence, when aligned with the codon, is:\n\nmRNA codon:   5' - A U G - 3'\ntRNA anticodon: 3' - U A C - 5'\n\nThe question asks for the anticodon sequence to be written in the standard 5' to 3' direction. To do this, we read the sequence 3'-UAC-5' from the 5' end to the 3' end. This gives us the sequence 5'-CAU-3'.\n\nNow we compare this result with the given options:\nA. 5'-AUG-3' is the codon itself, not the anticodon.\nB. 5'-GUA-3' is the reverse of the codon, not the complement.\nC. 5'-UAC-3' is the complementary sequence but ignores the antiparallel nature of the strands. This would be a parallel alignment, which is incorrect.\nD. 5'-CAU-3' is the correct complementary and antiparallel sequence, written in the standard 5' to 3' direction.\nE. 5'-CAT-3' incorrectly uses Thymine (T) instead of Uracil (U). Thymine is found in DNA, not RNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct anticodon sequence is 5'-CAU-3'.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2102413"}, {"introduction": "Building proteins is one of the most energy-intensive processes a cell undertakes. This problem asks you to move beyond the sequence of events and calculate the total metabolic cost, in terms of high-energy phosphate bonds from $ATP$ and $GTP$, required to synthesize a polypeptide of a given length [@problem_id:2102410]. By accounting for each step from amino acid activation to termination, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for the bioenergetics of translation.", "problem": "A bioengineering firm is designing a bacterial expression system to produce a novel therapeutic protein. To assess the metabolic load on the host bacterium, you are tasked with calculating the total energy expenditure, in terms of high-energy phosphate bonds, required to synthesize a single molecule of this protein, which consists of 150 amino acids.\n\nThe synthesis process involves several steps with distinct energy requirements, provided below. For this calculation, a \"high-energy phosphate bond\" refers to a bond whose cleavage releases a significant amount of free energy, such as those in the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP or GTP to GDP.\n\nThe energy costs are as follows:\n1.  **Amino Acid Activation:** Each amino acid must be attached to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). This process consumes one Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecule, which is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). The subsequent, rapid hydrolysis of PPi into two inorganic phosphate molecules means this step is energetically equivalent to the cleavage of two high-energy phosphate bonds per amino acid.\n2.  **Initiation:** The formation of the translation initiation complex, which positions the first aminoacyl-tRNA at the start codon, requires the hydrolysis of one Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) molecule to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n3.  **Elongation:** For each subsequent amino acid incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain, two GTP molecules are hydrolyzed: one for the delivery of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site, and one for the translocation of the ribosome along the messenger RNA (mRNA).\n4.  **Termination:** The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds that are cleaved to synthesize one complete 150-amino-acid protein molecule, from the initial activation of all required amino acids to the final termination step.", "solution": "Let $n$ denote the number of amino acids in the protein. The total number of high-energy phosphate bonds cleaved is the sum of the costs from amino acid activation, initiation, elongation, and termination.\n\nAmino acid activation: Each amino acid is charged to its tRNA using ATP to AMP with subsequent pyrophosphate hydrolysis, which is energetically equivalent to two high-energy phosphate bond cleavages per amino acid. Thus,\n$$\nC_{\\text{act}} = 2n.\n$$\n\nInitiation: Formation of the initiation complex requires one GTP hydrolysis:\n$$\nC_{\\text{init}} = 1.\n$$\n\nElongation: Each peptide bond addition after the first requires two GTP hydrolyses (one for aminoacyl-tRNA delivery to the A-site and one for ribosomal translocation).

A partial messenger RNA (mRNA) codon table is provided below:\n- GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG all code for Alanine (Ala)\n- GAU, GAC both code for Aspartic acid (Asp)\n- GAA, GAG both code for Glutamic acid (Glu)\n\nFor classifying the base change, recall that Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are purines, while Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) are pyrimidines.

Missense mutation and a transition", "solution": "Interpret the given strands correctly: the non-template (coding) DNA strand has the same sequence as the mRNA except that DNA uses T where RNA uses U. Therefore, the original coding DNA codon `5'-GCA-3'` corresponds to the mRNA codon `5'-GCA-3'`, which, from the table, encodes Alanine (Ala). After mutation, the coding DNA codon is `5'-GAA-3'`, corresponding to the mRNA codon `5'-GAA-3'`, which encodes Glutamic acid (Glu).\n\nThus, the amino acid changes from Ala to Glu, so the mutation is a missense mutation (not silent, not nonsense).\n\nNext, classify the base change. Compare positions:\n- Position $1$: G to G (no change).\n- Position $2$: C to A (change).\n- Position $3$: A to A (no change).\n\nAt the changed position, the base changes from Cytosine (C, a pyrimidine) to Adenine (A, a purine). A pyrimidine-to-purine substitution is a transversion.\n\nTherefore, the mutation is a missense mutation and a transversion.
