{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in understanding the impact of a mobile genetic element is to correctly classify it based on its structure. This exercise provides a scenario where you act as a molecular detective, using sequence information to identify a specific type of transposon. Recognizing the architectural features of elements like the one described in this problem, which often carry antibiotic resistance genes, is a fundamental skill for tracking the spread of resistance in microbial populations [@problem_id:2102735].", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is investigating the spread of antibiotic resistance in a clinical isolate of *Escherichia coli*. They successfully isolate a plasmid and perform full-genome sequencing on it. The analysis of the sequence reveals a specific mobile genetic element. This element consists of a gene conferring tetracycline resistance, denoted as $tet^R$. This $tet^R$ gene is situated between two identical copies of an Insertion Sequence (IS) element known as IS1. Each IS1 element is a complete, functional unit containing the gene for the enzyme transposase. The entire structure, including both IS1 elements and the intervening $tet^R$ gene, appears to be capable of moving as a single unit from the plasmid to the bacterial chromosome.\n\nBased on this precise structural description, how would you classify this mobile genetic element?\n\nA. Composite Transposon\n\nB. Non-composite (Simple) Transposon\n\nC. Insertion Sequence (IS)\n\nD. Integron\n\nE. Retrotransposon", "solution": "The problem asks for the classification of a specific mobile genetic element found on a plasmid in *Escherichia coli*. Let's break down the given structure and compare it to the definitions of the options provided.\n\nThe key features described are:\n1.  A central gene, $tet^R$, which confers antibiotic resistance. This gene is not essential for the mobility of the element itself; it is a \"passenger\" gene.\n2.  This central gene is flanked on both sides by two identical copies of an Insertion Sequence (IS) element, specifically IS1.\n3.  Each IS1 element is described as a complete unit containing the gene for transposase, the enzyme that catalyzes the movement of the element.\n4.  The entire unit (IS1 -- $tet^R$ -- IS1) moves together.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Composite Transposon**: A composite transposon is defined as a mobile DNA element that consists of a central region carrying one or more genes (often for antibiotic resistance or other accessory functions) located between two separate Insertion Sequence (IS) elements. The IS elements supply the transposase activity, which can act on the ends of the entire transposon to move the whole unit. The described structure (an antibiotic resistance gene flanked by two identical IS elements) perfectly matches this definition.\n\nB. **Non-composite (Simple) Transposon**: A non-composite transposon also carries accessory genes like antibiotic resistance genes, but it is structurally different. It is not flanked by two autonomous IS elements. Instead, it is a single, unified element flanked by short inverted repeat (IR) sequences. It encodes its own transposase and other transposition-related proteins within the element itself, between the IRs. The described structure has two complete IS elements, not just short IRs, so this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Insertion Sequence (IS)**: An Insertion Sequence is the simplest form of a transposable element. It typically only contains the gene(s) necessary for its own transposition, such as the transposase gene, flanked by short inverted repeats. The element described in the problem is more complex because it carries an additional passenger gene ($tet^R$). Therefore, while the element *contains* IS elements, the entire structure is not just an IS element.\n\nD. **Integron**: An integron is a genetic system that captures and expresses mobile gene cassettes. It has a specific structure consisting of an integrase gene ($intI$) and a primary recombination site ($attI$). It captures gene cassettes (which are typically promoterless genes with a downstream recombination site, $attC$). This mechanism and structure, based on site-specific recombination, are fundamentally different from the transposase-driven movement of a segment flanked by IS elements.\n\nE. **Retrotransposon**: A retrotransposon is a type of transposable element that moves via a \"copy-and-paste\" mechanism involving an RNA intermediate. The element's DNA is first transcribed into RNA, and then reverse transcriptase (an enzyme encoded by the retrotransposon itself) synthesizes a DNA copy of the RNA, which is then inserted into a new location in the genome. The element described is a DNA element in a bacterium and its structure (IS elements with a DNA gene) is characteristic of a DNA transposon, not a retrotransposon.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mobile genetic element with a central resistance gene flanked by two IS elements is correctly classified as a composite transposon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2102735"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the molecular choreography of transposition is crucial for predicting its genetic consequences. This problem presents a thought experiment that challenges you to trace the outcome of a replicative transposition event where a key step has been disabled by a mutation. By analyzing what happens when the normal resolution of the transposition intermediate fails, you will develop a deeper understanding of the entire mechanistic pathway and its intricate connection to other cellular processes like conjugation [@problem_id:2102745].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying genetic exchange in *Escherichia coli*. The donor strain is F+ and contains a replicative transposon, designated `Tn_rep`, located on its chromosome. This transposon encodes a functional transposase for mobility and a resolvase for processing the transposition intermediate. However, the specific allele of the transposon being studied, `Tn_rep_mut`, has a critical point mutation in its internal resolution site (*res*), rendering the site non-functional for the resolvase enzyme. The recipient strain is F- and lacks the `Tn_rep` transposon.\n\nThe two strains are mixed. In a donor cell, just prior to conjugation, a single replicative transposition event is initiated, moving a copy of `Tn_rep_mut` from the chromosome to the F plasmid. Immediately after this transposition process completes, that specific donor cell successfully forms a conjugation bridge with a recipient cell and initiates DNA transfer.\n\nAssuming that the transfer of genetic material is not lethal to the recipient and that the transferred DNA does not undergo homologous recombination with the recipient's chromosome, which of the following statements best describes the most likely stable outcome for the recipient cell long after conjugation is complete?\n\nA. The recipient cell remains F-, and the transferred DNA is degraded without being integrated or replicated.\n\nB. The recipient cell receives and stably maintains a single, large circular replicon containing the entire donor chromosome fused to the F plasmid.\n\nC. The recipient cell becomes F+ after receiving a normal-sized F plasmid that now carries a copy of `Tn_rep_mut`.\n\nD. The recipient cell's chromosome integrates the F plasmid, causing the cell to become a stable Hfr (High-frequency recombination) strain.\n\nE. The recipient cell receives a copy of the F plasmid and a separate, linear fragment of the donor's chromosome, both of which are degraded.", "solution": "Replicative transposition by Tn3-like elements proceeds via the following mechanistic steps: the transposase catalyzes strand transfer to a target replicon, generating a cointegrate in which donor and target replicons are covalently fused and are flanked at the two junctions by duplicated copies of the transposon. Site-specific resolution of this cointegrate back into two separate circular replicons, each carrying one copy of the transposon, requires the transposon-encoded resolvase acting at its cognate internal resolution site (res). If the res site is non-functional, site-specific resolution cannot occur, and the immediate product of replicative transposition is a stable cointegrate unless it is resolved later by host-mediated homologous recombination between the duplicated transposon copies.\n\nIn the scenario described, a single replicative transposition event with the mutant element Tn_rep_mut (defective res) occurs from the donor chromosome into the F plasmid just prior to conjugation. Because the res site is non-functional, the transposition completes at the cointegrate stage, yielding a single large circular replicon that contains the entire donor chromosome fused to the F plasmid and bracketed by two copies of Tn_rep_mut. Thus, at the moment conjugation begins, the donor effectively behaves as an Hfr-like cell with the F region integrated into the chromosome (as part of the cointegrate).\n\nConjugation initiates at the F origin of transfer (oriT) embedded within this integrated F region. DNA transfer proceeds as a single-stranded, linear molecule starting in F sequences and continuing into adjacent donor chromosomal sequences. For the recipient to acquire an autonomous, circular F plasmid, the transfer would have to traverse an entire circle back to oriT to regenerate a complete F circle; in an Hfr-like context, this would require transfer of essentially the entire fused circle (i.e., the whole chromosome-length path), which is highly unlikely within typical mating durations. Therefore, the incoming DNA in the recipient is a linear fragment consisting of a segment of F followed by chromosomal DNA.\n\nThe problem further stipulates that the transferred DNA does not undergo homologous recombination with the recipient chromosome. Consequently, the linear DNA entering the recipient cannot integrate into the chromosome. It also cannot stably replicate as a plasmid because it does not constitute a complete circular replicon with a functional plasmid origin in circular form. Such non-integrated, incomplete linear DNA is ultimately degraded by the recipient. As a result, the recipient does not acquire a functional F plasmid and remains F-.\n\nEliminating the options:\n- B would require full-circle transfer and stable autonomous maintenance of the entire cointegrate, which is not the most likely outcome.\n- C would require prior site-specific resolution to produce a free, normal-sized F plasmid with Tn_rep_mut, which cannot occur due to the non-functional res site and the immediate timing of conjugation.\n- D requires homologous recombination to integrate incoming DNA into the recipient’s chromosome, explicitly disallowed.\n- E incorrectly posits receipt of a separate, autonomous F plasmid plus a separate chromosomal fragment; in Hfr-like transfer, the DNA enters as a single linear fragment and does not yield an autonomous F plasmid in the recipient.\n\nTherefore, the most likely stable outcome is degradation of the transferred DNA with the recipient remaining F-.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2102745"}, {"introduction": "Transposons do not operate in isolation; their activity is often tightly controlled by the host cell. This practice takes you into the world of experimental molecular genetics, where you will analyze data from a reporter gene assay to investigate the regulation of a transposon. By calculating the induction ratio from the provided data, you will quantitatively test the hypothesis that transposon mobility can be switched on by the host's DNA damage response, illustrating a powerful method for studying gene regulation [@problem_id:2102771].", "problem": "A molecular microbiologist has discovered a new insertion sequence, designated `IS_gamma`, within the genome of a pathogenic bacterium. They hypothesize that the mobility of this element, driven by its transposase gene `tnpG`, is transcriptionally upregulated during periods of host cell stress. Specifically, they suspect that the promoter of `tnpG` is controlled by the host's SOS response system, a global regulatory network activated by DNA damage.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, an experiment is designed using a reporter gene system in a laboratory strain of *Escherichia coli* known to have a functional SOS response. A transcriptional fusion is created by cloning the promoter region of the `tnpG` gene, denoted `P_tnpG`, upstream of a promoterless gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This `P_tnpG-gfp` fusion is carried on a plasmid named `pTNP_REP`.\n\nAs a control, a second plasmid, `pNULL_REP`, is used. It is identical to `pTNP_REP` but lacks the `P_tnpG` promoter, containing only the promoterless `gfp` gene. This control is used to measure any background fluorescence inherent to the cells and the measurement system.\n\nTwo cultures of the *E. coli* strain are prepared. One is transformed with `pTNP_REP` and the other with `pNULL_REP`. The `pTNP_REP` culture is grown to mid-logarithmic phase and then divided into two subcultures.\n-   **Uninduced Subculture**: This subculture is grown under standard conditions.\n-   **Induced Subculture**: This subculture is treated with a sub-lethal concentration of mitomycin C, a DNA cross-linking agent known to robustly activate the SOS response.\n\nAfter a 2-hour incubation period, samples from all cultures are analyzed. Fluorescence intensity is measured and normalized to cell density, which is determined by the Optical Density (OD) at 600 nm. The results are reported in Relative Fluorescence Units per OD unit (RFU/OD).\n\nThe following data were obtained:\n-   Culture with `pNULL_REP` (Background): 25.1 RFU/OD\n-   Uninduced subculture with `pTNP_REP`: 115.4 RFU/OD\n-   Induced subculture with `pTNP_REP`: 2142.8 RFU/OD\n\nCalculate the SOS induction ratio for the `tnpG` promoter.
