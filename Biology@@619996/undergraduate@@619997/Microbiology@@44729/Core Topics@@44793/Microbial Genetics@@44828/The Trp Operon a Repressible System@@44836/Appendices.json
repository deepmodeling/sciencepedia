This first practice invites you to explore a hypothetical scenario where the *trpR* gene, responsible for producing the repressor protein, is non-functional. By predicting the outcome, you will solidify your understanding of the repressor's fundamental role as the primary negative regulator of the *trp* operon [@problem_id:2100875].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by a repressible system known as the *trp* operon. This operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and five structural genes (*trpE*, *trpD*, *trpC*, *trpB*, *trpA*) that code for the enzymes required to synthesize tryptophan. The regulatory gene *trpR*, located at a different site on the bacterial chromosome, produces a repressor protein.\n\nUnder normal conditions in a wild-type cell, this repressor protein is synthesized in an inactive form. When intracellular levels of tryptophan are high, tryptophan molecules act as a co-repressor, binding to the repressor protein. This binding activates the repressor, enabling it to bind to the operator region of the *trp* operon, which in turn blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. Conversely, when tryptophan levels are low, the repressor remains inactive, cannot bind the operator, and the structural genes are transcribed.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has sustained a mutation in the *trpR* gene. This mutation renders the resulting repressor protein completely non-functional, meaning it is unable to bind to the operator sequence under any circumstances, regardless of the presence or absence of tryptophan.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the expression of the structural genes of the *trp* operon in this mutant strain when it is grown in two different environments: one medium completely lacking tryptophan and another medium rich in tryptophan?\n\nA. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed in the medium lacking tryptophan, but not in the medium rich in tryptophan.\n\nB. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will not be transcribed in either medium.\n\nC. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed in both the medium lacking tryptophan and the medium rich in tryptophan.\n\nD. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will not be transcribed in the medium lacking tryptophan, but will be transcribed in the medium rich in tryptophan.", "solution": "We consider the repressible regulation of the *trp* operon. Let $R$ denote the repressor encoded by *trpR*, $W$ denote tryptophan (the co-repressor), and $O$ denote the operator. In the wild type, $R$ is synthesized in an inactive form; binding of $W$ produces the active complex $R \\cdot W$ that can bind $O$ and block RNA polymerase. Symbolically:\n- Low $[W]$: $R$ inactive, no $R \\cdot W$ formation, $R$ cannot bind $O$, transcription proceeds.\n- High $[W]$: $R \\cdot W$ forms, $R \\cdot W$ binds $O$, transcription is repressed.\n\nIn the mutant strain, the *trpR* gene carries a loss-of-function mutation such that the repressor protein is completely non-functional and cannot bind $O$ under any condition. This implies:\n- For any $[W]$, neither $R$ nor any hypothetical $R \\cdot W$ can bind $O$.\n- Therefore, $O$ remains unoccupied by repressor, so RNA polymerase is not blocked at the operator.\n\nConsequently, the structural genes are transcribed constitutively in both environments:\n- In medium lacking tryptophan: no repression possible, transcription occurs.\n- In medium rich in tryptophan: despite high $[W]$, the non-functional repressor cannot bind $O$, so transcription still occurs.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the structural genes are transcribed in both conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2100875"}, {"introduction": "Having established the effect of a non-functional repressor, we now examine the opposite extreme. This thought experiment presents a mutant \"super-repressor\" that is constitutively active, binding to the operator regardless of tryptophan's presence. This exercise challenges you to move beyond a simple on/off model and consider the severe consequences of a regulatory switch that is permanently stuck in the \"off\" position, revealing the importance of the repressor's ability to change shape [@problem_id:2100817].", "problem": "In a typical *Escherichia coli* cell, the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon, a classic example of a repressible system. The operon includes structural genes (*trpE*, *trpD*, *trpC*, *trpB*, *trpA*) that code for enzymes involved in the tryptophan synthesis pathway. Upstream of these genes is a regulatory region containing a promoter and an operator. A separate regulatory gene, *trpR*, codes for a repressor protein. In its native state, this repressor protein is inactive. It only becomes active and binds to the operator sequence when it forms a complex with its corepressor, tryptophan. This binding blocks transcription of the structural genes.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has a specific mutation in its *trpR* gene. This mutation results in the production of a \"super-repressor\" protein. This altered repressor protein has a conformational shape that allows it to bind strongly to the *trp* operator sequence at all times, irrespective of the presence or absence of tryptophan in the cell.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting phenotype of this mutant strain?\n\nA. The structural genes of the *trp* operon would be permanently repressed, preventing the synthesis of tryptophan and making the cell dependent on an external supply of this amino acid for growth.\n\nB. The structural genes of the *trp* operon would be constitutively expressed, leading to the overproduction of tryptophan even when it is abundant in the environment.\n\nC. The expression of the *trp* operon would become inducible by glucose, similar to the mechanism of catabolite repression in the *lac* operon.\n\nD. The cell would synthesize tryptophan normally when the amino acid is absent but would be unable to stop synthesis when tryptophan is externally supplied.\n\nE. The *trpR* gene itself would be over-expressed, but the structural genes would function normally, responding correctly to tryptophan levels.", "solution": "The wild-type *trp* operon is a repressible system in which the repressor protein encoded by *trpR* is inactive in the absence of tryptophan and becomes active only when bound to tryptophan (the corepressor). The active repressor–tryptophan complex binds the operator, blocking RNA polymerase access and repressing transcription of the structural genes *trpE*, *trpD*, *trpC*, *trpB*, and *trpA*. Therefore:\n- When intracellular tryptophan is low, the repressor is unbound by tryptophan and remains inactive, fails to bind the operator, and transcription proceeds to synthesize tryptophan.\n- When intracellular tryptophan is high, tryptophan binds the repressor, activating it to bind the operator and repress transcription.\n\nIn the mutant strain described, the *trpR* gene encodes a super-repressor that binds the operator strongly irrespective of the presence or absence of tryptophan. This eliminates the requirement for the corepressor for DNA binding and thus fixes the operator in the repressor-bound state. As a result, RNA polymerase is blocked from transcribing the structural genes at all times.\n\nFrom this, it follows that the structural genes are permanently repressed, preventing endogenous tryptophan synthesis. Consequently, the cell becomes auxotrophic for tryptophan and requires an external supply to grow. This matches option A.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Option B is incorrect because constitutive expression would require an inability of the repressor to bind the operator, which is the opposite of a super-repressor.\n- Option C is incorrect because glucose-induced regulation (catabolite repression) pertains to the *lac* operon via CAP–cAMP and does not apply to the *trp* operon in this manner.\n- Option D is incorrect because the mutant cannot synthesize tryptophan when it is absent; repression is constitutive, not the inability to stop synthesis.\n- Option E is incorrect because the defect lies in altered repressor activity, not mere overexpression, and the structural genes would not respond normally; they would be repressed irrespective of tryptophan levels.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is permanent repression and tryptophan dependence for growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2100817"}, {"introduction": "Gene regulation can be elegantly dissected using partial diploids, which allow biologists to test how different genetic components interact within the same cell. This final practice moves into a more complex, quantitative scenario involving a merodiploid *E. coli* with two different versions of the *trp* operon. Solving this problem requires you to distinguish between *cis*-acting elements, like the operator, and *trans*-acting factors, like the repressor protein, and to integrate their effects to predict a final, measurable outcome [@problem_id:2100823].", "problem": "An *Escherichia coli* cell's synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon, a classic example of a repressible system. The operon consists of a promoter (*P*), an operator (*O*), and a set of structural genes (*Z*) that code for the necessary enzymes. Transcription is controlled by a repressor protein, encoded by the *trpR* gene, which is located elsewhere on the chromosome. In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor is inactive, and the operon is transcribed. When tryptophan is present, it acts as a corepressor, binding to the repressor and activating it. The active repressor-tryptophan complex then binds to the operator, blocking transcription.\n\nConsider a wild-type strain where all components are functional (*trpR*^+ *O*^+ *Z*^+). In a medium completely lacking tryptophan, the enzymes are synthesized at a maximum rate, which we define as $R_{max}$. When this wild-type strain is grown in a medium with a high concentration of tryptophan, the operon is strongly repressed, and the enzyme synthesis rate drops to a basal level of $R_{basal} = 0.01 R_{max}$.\n\nNow, consider a special strain of *E. coli* that is a partial diploid (merodiploid). Its genotype is as follows:\n- **Chromosome:** *trpR*^+ *P*^+ *O*^c *Z*^+\n- **Plasmid (F' factor):** *P*^+ *O*^+ *Z*^+\n\nThe *O*^c mutation is an operator-constitutive mutation; it alters the operator sequence such that the active repressor-tryptophan complex cannot bind to it. An operon with an *O*^c mutation is thus expressed constitutively at the maximum rate $R_{max}$, regardless of the tryptophan concentration. The *trpR* gene on the chromosome is wild-type and produces a functional repressor protein that can diffuse throughout the cell. Both sets of structural genes, *Z*^+, on the chromosome and the plasmid are wild-type.\n\nIf this partial diploid strain is grown in a medium containing a high concentration of tryptophan, what is the total rate of synthesis of the tryptophan-synthesizing enzymes, expressed as a multiple of $R_{max}$? Provide your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total rate of synthesis of enzymes from the *trp* operon in a specific partial diploid *E. coli* strain grown in a high-tryptophan medium. We need to analyze the expression from both the chromosomal and plasmid-borne operons and sum their contributions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the state of the regulatory components in the cell. The cell is grown in a medium with high tryptophan concentration. The chromosome carries a wild-type repressor gene, *trpR*^+. This gene is transcribed and translated to produce the TrpR repressor protein. Since tryptophan is abundant in the cell, it will act as a corepressor, binding to the inactive TrpR protein and converting it into its active conformation. Therefore, the cytoplasm is filled with active repressor-tryptophan complexes. This repressor protein is a *trans*-acting factor, meaning it can diffuse throughout the cell and interact with any accessible operator sequence.\n\nNext, we evaluate the expression from the chromosomal operon. The genotype of the chromosome is *trpR*^+ *P*^+ *O*^c *Z*^+. The critical element is the operator-constitutive mutation, *O*^c. By definition, the active repressor-tryptophan complex cannot bind to this mutated operator. As a result, transcription from the chromosomal operon is not blocked, even in the presence of the active repressor. The expression is constitutive. The problem states that an operon with an *O*^c mutation is expressed at the maximum rate, $R_{max}$.\nSo, the rate of enzyme synthesis from the chromosome is:\n$$R_{\\text{chromosome}} = R_{max}$$\nThe *O*^c mutation is *cis*-dominant, meaning it affects only the expression of the structural genes (*Z*^+) located on the same DNA molecule (the chromosome).\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression from the plasmid-borne operon. The genotype of the plasmid is *P*^+ *O*^+ *Z*^+. This operon has a wild-type operator, *O*^+. The active repressor-tryptophan complexes, produced from the chromosomal *trpR*^+ gene, are present in the cytoplasm and can bind to this wild-type operator on the plasmid. This binding blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes on the plasmid. This is an example where the *trans*-acting repressor, made from the chromosomal gene, regulates the plasmid-borne operon. The expression from this operon is therefore repressed. According to the problem, the repressed rate of synthesis for a wild-type operon is the basal level, $R_{basal}$.\nSo, the rate of enzyme synthesis from the plasmid is:\n$$R_{\\text{plasmid}} = R_{basal} = 0.01 R_{max}$$\n\nThe total rate of synthesis of the tryptophan enzymes in the partial diploid cell is the sum of the rates from the chromosome and the plasmid.\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{chromosome}} + R_{\\text{plasmid}}$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{max} + 0.01 R_{max}$$\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = (1 + 0.01) R_{max}$$\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = 1.01 R_{max}$$\n\nThe question asks for the total rate expressed as a multiple of $R_{max}$. The calculated multiple is 1.01. This value is already given to three significant figures as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.01}$$", "id": "2100823"}]}
