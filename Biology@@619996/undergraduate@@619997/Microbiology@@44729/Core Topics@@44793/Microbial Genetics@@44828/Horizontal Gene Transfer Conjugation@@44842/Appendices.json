This exercise focuses on what happens when the transfer process is stopped before completion, a common scenario in experiments. Understanding the genetic status of the recipient cell is the first step in appreciating why Hfr crosses are a powerful tool for genetic analysis, but not for spreading the F factor itself. [@problem_id:2070936]", "problem": "In a microbiology experiment, a strain of *Escherichia coli* known as a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) cell is used. This strain has its fertility factor (F factor) integrated into its main bacterial chromosome. These Hfr cells are mixed with a large population of F- cells, which lack the F factor and cannot initiate conjugation. The two cell types are incubated together under conditions that allow conjugation to occur. However, after a relatively short period of time—much less than the approximately 100 minutes required for the complete transfer of the *E. coli* chromosome—the culture is placed in a blender and agitated at high speed. This mechanical disruption is known to break the conjugation bridges between the cells, thereby interrupting the transfer of genetic material.\n\nFollowing this interruption, the cells that were originally F- are isolated from the mixture. Which of the following statements best describes the most probable genetic state of the majority of these isolated recipient cells?\n\nA. The F- cells have converted to F+ cells.\n\nB. The F- cells have converted to Hfr cells.\n\nC. The F- cells remain F- but are now considered recombinant.\n\nD. The F- cells are completely unchanged, as the genetic transfer was unsuccessful.\n\nE. The F- cells have been lysed by the Hfr cells.", "solution": "An Hfr cell has the F factor integrated into its chromosome, so conjugation initiates at the origin of transfer within the integrated F factor and proceeds as a linear, single-stranded DNA transfer from donor to recipient through the conjugation bridge. In Hfr crosses, the transfer sequence begins with a portion of the integrated F factor and then proceeds into adjacent chromosomal genes. Because the F sequence is integrated and circularization of a complete F element in the recipient would require transfer of essentially the entire donor chromosome, conversion of the recipient to F+ (or Hfr) requires completion of transfer, which is highly unlikely when mating is interrupted early.\n\nIn the described experiment, mechanical agitation interrupts conjugation well before completion, so recipients virtually never receive the entire F element. Therefore, the recipients do not become F+ and do not become Hfr. However, before the bridge is broken, the donor typically transfers some chromosomal genes proximal to the origin. These incoming donor segments can undergo RecA-mediated homologous recombination with the recipient’s chromosome, replacing recipient alleles with donor alleles and generating a stable recombinant genotype. Because the F element is incomplete in the recipient, the cell remains F- despite having incorporated donor chromosomal DNA.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely because Hfr donors rarely convert recipients to F+; full F transfer is not achieved with early interruption.\n- B is even less likely; becoming Hfr would require full F transfer and appropriate integration.\n- C matches the hallmark of Hfr crosses: recipients remain F- but become recombinant by homologous recombination of transferred donor chromosomal DNA.\n- D is less accurate because gene transfer commonly begins before interruption, allowing recombination in many recipients.\n- E is incorrect because conjugation does not lyse recipient cells.\n\nTherefore, the most probable genetic state of the majority of isolated recipient cells is that they remain F- but are recombinant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070936"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of linear gene transfer, we can use conjugation as a powerful tool to map the bacterial chromosome. The classic interrupted mating experiment treats time as a direct measure of genetic distance from the origin of transfer. This practice challenges you to synthesize data from two different Hfr strains to construct a coherent gene map, demonstrating a foundational technique in microbial genetics. [@problem_id:2070993]", "problem": "A research team is investigating the genetics of *Aromaticivorax catabolicum*, a novel bacterium capable of breaking down industrial aromatic pollutants. To construct a genetic map of its chromosome, they have created two different High-frequency recombination (Hfr) strains, designated Hfr-1 and Hfr-2. Each Hfr strain was separately mixed with an F- recipient strain that is unable to synthesize tryptophan (`trpC-`), arginine (`argG-`), or pyrimidines (`pyrB-`), and cannot utilize maltose (`malT-`) or degrade a specific pollutant (`petA-`).\n\nInterrupted mating experiments were performed for each cross (Hfr-1 x F- and Hfr-2 x F-). The cultures were blended at various time points to stop conjugation, and the cells were plated on selective media to determine the time at which each gene first entered the recipient cells. The time of first appearance (in minutes) for prototrophic recombinants for each gene is recorded below.\n\n**Data from Hfr-1 x F- cross:**\n- `argG`: 40 min\n- `malT`: 60 min\n- `petA`: 10 min\n- `pyrB`: 85 min\n- `trpC`: 25 min\n\n**Data from Hfr-2 x F- cross:**\n- `argG`: 10 min\n- `malT`: 90 min\n- `petA`: 40 min\n- `pyrB`: 65 min\n- `trpC`: 25 min\n\nThe bacterial chromosome is known to be circular. Based on these two sets of data, determine the correct linear sequence of these five genes on the chromosome, starting with the `petA` gene and proceeding in the direction that leads next to the `trpC` gene.\n\nA. `petA` - `trpC` - `argG` - `malT` - `pyrB`\n\nB. `petA` - `pyrB` - `malT` - `argG` - `trpC`\n\nC. `petA` - `pyrB` - `malT` - `trpC` - `argG`\n\nD. `petA` - `trpC` - `pyrB` - `malT` - `argG`\n\nE. `petA` - `argG` - `trpC` - `malT` - `pyrB`", "solution": "Principle: In interrupted mating with Hfr donors, the order in which donor genes first appear in recombinants reflects their linear order on the chromosome downstream of the Hfr origin in the direction of transfer. Earlier entry time implies closer proximity to the origin along the transfer direction. Different Hfr strains have different origins and/or orientations; comparing two Hfr orders allows reconstruction of the circular gene map and hence a consistent linear order.\n\nFrom the Hfr-1 cross, ascending times of first appearance give the transfer order:\n- $10$ min: $petA$\n- $25$ min: $trpC$\n- $40$ min: $argG$\n- $60$ min: $malT$\n- $85$ min: $pyrB$\nThus, along the Hfr-1 transfer direction, the gene order is $petA \\rightarrow trpC \\rightarrow argG \\rightarrow malT \\rightarrow pyrB$. The interval differences support this order: $petA \\rightarrow trpC$ is $15$ min, $trpC \\rightarrow argG$ is $15$ min, $argG \\rightarrow malT$ is $20$ min, and $malT \\rightarrow pyrB$ is $25$ min.\n\nFrom the Hfr-2 cross, ascending times of first appearance give:\n- $10$ min: $argG$\n- $25$ min: $trpC$\n- $40$ min: $petA$\n- $65$ min: $pyrB$\n- $90$ min: $malT$\nThus, along the Hfr-2 transfer direction, the gene order is $argG \\rightarrow trpC \\rightarrow petA \\rightarrow pyrB \\rightarrow malT$. Interval differences again are consistent for shared segments: $argG \\rightarrow trpC$ is $15$ min and $trpC \\rightarrow petA$ is $15$ min, matching the corresponding segments in Hfr-1 but in reverse orientation around a circular chromosome.\n\nReconciling both orders on a circular map: Hfr-1 indicates $petA \\rightarrow trpC \\rightarrow argG \\rightarrow malT \\rightarrow pyrB$ in its transfer direction. Hfr-2 starts near $argG$ and transfers in the opposite direction, yielding $argG \\rightarrow trpC \\rightarrow petA \\rightarrow pyrB \\rightarrow malT$, which is the reverse traversal of the same circle from $argG$. Therefore, the consistent circular arrangement is $petA - trpC - argG - malT - pyrB$ (and back to $petA$). The problem asks for the linear sequence starting with $petA$ and proceeding in the direction that leads next to $trpC$, which is precisely $petA - trpC - argG - malT - pyrB$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2070993"}, {"introduction": "We've seen how genes are transferred and how their entry times can be used for mapping, but what determines the ultimate fate of this new DNA in the recipient cell? This final practice delves into the molecular mechanics of how a transferred DNA fragment becomes a permanent part of the recipient's genome. By considering a cell lacking the crucial RecA protein, you will discover why homologous recombination is the non-negotiable final step for creating a stable recombinant. [@problem_id:2070963]", "problem": "In an experimental study of bacterial genetics, a microbiologist prepares two strains of *Escherichia coli*.\n\nThe donor strain is a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) strain. Its chromosome contains a copy of the F-factor integrated near the beginning of the *leu* operon. This strain is prototrophic for leucine (genotype `leu+`) and is sensitive to the antibiotic streptomycin (genotype `str-s`).\n\nThe recipient strain is an F- strain. This strain is auxotrophic for leucine, meaning it cannot synthesize its own and requires it for growth (genotype `leu-`). It is resistant to streptomycin (genotype `str-r`). Critically, this recipient strain also possesses a null mutation in the `recA` gene (genotype `recA-`), rendering the RecA protein non-functional.\n\nThe two strains are mixed in a nutrient broth and incubated for a sufficient period to allow for the transfer of the `leu+` gene from the Hfr donors to the F- recipients. After incubation, the mixture is plated on a minimal agar medium that contains streptomycin but lacks leucine.\n\nBased on the known functions of the genes involved, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed after incubating the plate?\n\nA. The `leu+` gene fragment will be degraded by cellular nucleases because it cannot be integrated into the chromosome, and therefore no colonies will grow on the selective plate.\n\nB. The `leu+` gene will be successfully integrated into the recipient's chromosome via homologous recombination, resulting in the growth of a high number of `leu+ str-r` recombinant colonies.\n\nC. The transferred `leu+` gene fragment will self-circularize to form a small plasmid that possesses its own origin of replication, leading to the growth of `leu+ str-r` colonies.\n\nD. The recipient cells will be converted into Hfr strains that are also `leu+`, leading to the growth of numerous colonies on the selective plate.\n\nE. The recipient cells will remain `leu-` but will become diploid for the `leu` locus, with the transferred `leu+` gene coexisting stably alongside the chromosomal `leu-` gene as an unintegrated linear fragment.", "solution": "Define donor genotype: Hfr leu+ str-s with F integrated near the leu operon. Define recipient genotype: F- leu- str-r recA-. In Hfr conjugation, transfer initiates at oriT within the integrated F and proceeds as a linear single-stranded fragment of donor chromosomal DNA into the recipient. After entry, the DNA is made double-stranded and must undergo homologous recombination with the recipient chromosome to be stably maintained and expressed.\n\nState the central requirement: Integration of a linear donor chromosomal fragment into the recipient chromosome requires RecA-mediated homologous recombination. RecA promotes strand invasion and exchange between homologous sequences. In a recA- recipient, homologous recombination is effectively abolished; consequently, incoming linear donor DNA cannot integrate.\n\nState the fate of non-integrated linear DNA: Donor linear DNA lacking an origin of replication cannot replicate autonomously. In the cytoplasm of the recipient, linear DNA that does not recombine is targeted and degraded by cellular nucleases. Therefore, without integration, the leu+ allele will not be maintained or expressed.\n\nApply selection logic: The selective plate contains streptomycin and lacks leucine. Donor cells (str-s) are killed by streptomycin and cannot contribute colonies. Recipient cells (str-r) survive the antibiotic but are leu-. Growth on minimal medium lacking leucine requires acquisition and expression of leu+. Because recA- blocks recombination-dependent integration of leu+, recipients will remain leu- and thus cannot grow on leucine-free medium.\n\nEvaluate alternatives:\n- B is false because RecA is required for homologous recombination; recA- prevents successful integration and hence prevents leu+ conversion.\n- C is false because the transferred Hfr chromosomal fragment lacks an origin of replication and cannot self-circularize into a replicon that propagates as a plasmid in the absence of an appropriate ori.\n- D is false because conversion to Hfr requires transfer and integration of the F sequence; full transfer of F from Hfr is rare due to conjugation bridge breakage, and selection conditions kill donors; moreover, leu+ expression still requires integration blocked by recA-.\n- E is false because stable maintenance of an unintegrated linear donor fragment does not occur; without integration or an origin, it is degraded and cannot create a stable merodiploid state. Stable partial diploidy (merozygotes) typically arises via F' plasmids (sexduction), not Hfr chromosomal transfer, and still would not be stably maintained as a linear fragment.\n\nConclusion: The most likely outcome under these conditions is degradation of the transferred leu+ fragment with no colony growth on the selective plate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2070963"}]}
