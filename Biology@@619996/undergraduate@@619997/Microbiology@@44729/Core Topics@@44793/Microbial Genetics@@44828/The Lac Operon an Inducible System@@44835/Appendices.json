{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding gene function often involves working backward from an observable phenotype to the underlying genetic cause. This practice challenges you to act as a molecular detective, using experimental data to diagnose a malfunction in the *lac* operon's metabolic pathway. By analyzing why a mutant *E. coli* strain behaves differently under specific conditions, you will sharpen your ability to distinguish between the roles of lactose transport, governed by the `lacY` gene, and lactose breakdown, mediated by the `lacZ` gene [@problem_id:2099265].", "problem": "A microbiologist isolates a mutant strain of *Escherichia coli* that exhibits an unusual phenotype related to lactose metabolism. When this mutant strain is grown on a minimal medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source, no growth is observed. However, a subsequent experiment is performed where the bacterial cells are first treated with a chemical agent that renders the cell membrane permeable to small molecules like lactose. When lactose and the appropriate reagents for a colorimetric assay are added to these permeabilized cells, the activity of the enzyme β-galactosidase is readily detected, indicating that the cells are capable of metabolizing lactose once it is inside the cytoplasm.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which of the following components of the lac operon is most likely defective in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The `lacZ` gene, which codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase.\n\nB. The `lacY` gene, which codes for the protein lactose permease.\n\nC. The `lacI` gene, which codes for the lac repressor protein.\n\nD. The `lacP` site, which is the promoter region for the operon.\n\nE. The `lacO` site, which is the operator region where the repressor binds.", "solution": "We analyze lactose utilization in the lac operon by enumerating the necessary steps and the role of each component:\n1) For growth on lactose as sole carbon source, cells must import lactose across the membrane and then cleave it to glucose and galactose. Import is mediated by lactose permease (product of the lacY gene), and cleavage is mediated by beta-galactosidase (product of the lacZ gene). Transcription of lacZ and lacY from the promoter lacP is regulated by the lac repressor (product of lacI) binding to the operator lacO in the absence of inducer.\n2) Observation: The mutant shows no growth on minimal medium with lactose. This implies an inability to use lactose as a carbon source. Potential causes include: loss of lactose import (defect in lacY), loss of lactose hydrolysis (defect in lacZ), or a transcriptional defect preventing expression of these enzymes (defect in lacP, lacO with repressor binding, or a superrepressor lacI^{s}).\n3) Critical observation: After permeabilizing the membrane to allow small molecules like lactose to enter the cytoplasm, the addition of lactose and colorimetric reagents reveals readily detectable beta-galactosidase activity. This demonstrates that:\n   - The beta-galactosidase enzyme is present and functional, so a defect in lacZ (option A) is inconsistent.\n   - The operon must be expressed at least to the extent that beta-galactosidase protein is produced, making a nonfunctional promoter lacP (option D) or an operator defect that locks the operon off (option E in that sense) inconsistent with the observed enzyme activity. A lacI defect (option C) typically causes constitutive expression rather than a failure to grow on lactose; moreover, the key barrier removed by permeabilization is transport, not repression.\n4) The rescue of detectable beta-galactosidase activity specifically upon membrane permeabilization indicates that the block lies at lactose entry into the cell. This is the function of lactose permease encoded by lacY.\n5) Therefore, the most likely defective component in this mutant is the lacY gene encoding lactose permease.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2099265"}, {"introduction": "The classic experiments that elucidated the *lac* operon's function relied on creating partial diploid *E. coli*, which carry a second copy of the operon on a plasmid. This exercise places you in the role of a geneticist, predicting the phenotype of such a merodiploid cell. This practice is crucial for understanding the fundamental difference between *cis*-acting DNA sequences, like the operator (`lacO`), and *trans*-acting protein factors, like the repressor encoded by the `lacI` gene [@problem_id:2099264].", "problem": "In a microbiology laboratory, a student is studying gene regulation in *Escherichia coli*. The focus of the experiment is the lactose (lac) operon, a classic example of an inducible system for gene expression. The key components of this operon are:\n- The regulator gene, `lacI`, which codes for a repressor protein. The wild-type allele $I^+$ produces a functional repressor, while the mutant allele $I^-$ produces a non-functional one.\n- The operator, `lacO`, a DNA sequence that acts as a binding site for the repressor protein. The wild-type allele is $O^+$.\n- The structural gene `lacZ`, which codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase. The wild-type allele $Z^+$ produces a functional enzyme that can break down lactose, while the mutant allele $Z^-$ produces a non-functional version.\n\nThe student creates a partial diploid (merodiploid) strain of *E. coli* using an F' plasmid. This strain has one copy of the lac operon genes on its chromosome and another copy on the F' plasmid. The genotype of this specific strain is represented as `$I^+ O^+ Z^- / F' I^- O^+ Z^+$`, where the genes to the left of the slash are on the chromosome and the genes to the right are on the F' plasmid.\n\nRecall that the repressor protein (`lacI` product) is a trans-acting factor, meaning it can diffuse within the cell and act on any applicable DNA sequence. In contrast, the operator (`lacO`) is a cis-acting element, affecting only the genes located on the same DNA molecule.\n\nBased on this genetic makeup, predict the phenotype of this partial diploid cell. Will the cell be capable of inducible synthesis of functional β-galactosidase?\n\nA. Yes, the synthesis of functional β-galactosidase is inducible.\n\nB. No, the synthesis of functional β-galactosidase is constitutive (it occurs regardless of the presence of an inducer).\n\nC. No, the synthesis of functional β-galactosidase is permanently repressed (it never occurs, even with an inducer).\n\nD. The phenotype is a mix of constitutive and repressed states, so it is not strictly inducible.", "solution": "Let the chromosomal genotype be $I^{+}\\,O^{+}\\,Z^{-}$ and the F-prime plasmid genotype be $I^{-}\\,O^{+}\\,Z^{+}$. The `lacI` gene product (lac repressor) is a trans-acting protein; therefore any functional repressor made from $I^{+}$ can diffuse and act on operators on both the chromosome and the plasmid. The operator site is a cis-acting DNA element; thus each $O^{+}$ can be bound by functional repressor and can be relieved by inducer only for genes on the same DNA molecule. The `lacZ` gene encodes beta-galactosidase; only $Z^{+}$ yields functional enzyme, whereas $Z^{-}$ does not.\n\nBecause $I^{+}$ produces a functional repressor and $I^{-}$ produces a nonfunctional one, the presence of $I^{+}$ ensures that functional repressor is present in the cell (trans-dominant). Both operators are $O^{+}$, so in the absence of inducer, the functional repressor binds each $O^{+}$ and blocks transcription from both operons. Consequently, with no inducer, neither the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ operon nor the plasmid $Z^{+}$ operon will be transcribed, and no beta-galactosidase activity will be detected.\n\nIn the presence of inducer, the inducer binds the functional repressor and prevents its binding to $O^{+}$, thereby allowing transcription from both operons. Transcription of the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ operon yields no functional enzyme, but transcription of the plasmid $Z^{+}$ operon produces functional beta-galactosidase. Thus, functional enzyme is synthesized only when inducer is present.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is inducible synthesis of functional beta-galactosidase, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2099264"}, {"introduction": "The elegant regulation of the *lac* operon involves both a brake (negative control by the LacI repressor) and an accelerator (positive control by the CAP-cAMP complex). This problem presents a fascinating double-mutant scenario that disables both mechanisms, providing a unique window into the operon's core functionality. By predicting the transcriptional outcome in a cell with an unresponsive operator ($O^c$) and an inability to produce cAMP ($cyaA^-$), you will solidify your understanding of how these two layers of control work together and what happens when they are stripped away [@problem_id:2099335].", "problem": "The *lac* operon in *Escherichia coli* is a classic model system for understanding gene regulation. Its expression is governed by two key mechanisms: negative control and positive control.\n\nNegative control is mediated by the LacI repressor protein, the product of the `lacI` gene. In the absence of an inducer (like allolactose, derived from lactose), the LacI repressor binds to a specific DNA sequence called the operator (O), physically blocking transcription of the structural genes (`lacZ`, `lacY`, `lacA`).\n\nPositive control, also known as catabolite repression, is mediated by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). For CAP to function, it must bind to a small signaling molecule, cyclic AMP (cAMP). The enzyme adenylate cyclase, encoded by the `cyaA` gene, synthesizes cAMP. The CAP-cAMP complex binds to a site near the promoter, dramatically increasing the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter and thus enhancing transcription.\n\nConsider a special double-mutant strain of *E. coli*. This strain has two genetic modifications:\n1.  An operator-constitutive mutation, denoted as $O^c$, which alters the DNA sequence of the operator site such that the LacI repressor protein can no longer recognize or bind to it.\n2.  A complete deletion of the adenylate cyclase gene, denoted as $cyaA^-$, which renders the cell incapable of producing cAMP.\n\nThis double-mutant strain is cultured in a minimal medium where lactose is provided as the sole carbon source. Which of the following statements best describes the level of transcription of the *lac* operon's structural genes under these conditions?\n\nA. There will be no transcription because the cell cannot produce cyclic AMP (cAMP).\n\nB. Transcription will occur at a high, constitutive level because the operator is mutated.\n\nC. Transcription will occur at a very low, basal level.\n\nD. There will be no transcription because lactose cannot be converted to the true inducer, allolactose, without the products of the operon being expressed first.\n\nE. Transcription will be actively repressed by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) in the absence of its ligand.", "solution": "We analyze the two regulatory layers of the lac operon and the effects of the specified mutations on each.\n\nFirst, negative control via the LacI repressor and operator. In the wild type, LacI binds the operator to block RNA polymerase when no inducer is present. The $O^{c}$ mutation alters the operator so that LacI cannot bind. Therefore, negative control is completely abolished, and the operon is no longer subject to repression by LacI, regardless of the presence or absence of inducer (allolactose). Consequently, the need for lactose to be converted to allolactose to relieve repression is rendered irrelevant by $O^{c}$.\n\nSecond, positive control via CAP-cAMP. In the wild type, adenylate cyclase (product of $cyaA$) produces cAMP, which binds CAP; the CAP-cAMP complex increases RNA polymerase affinity for the promoter, yielding high transcription. In the $cyaA^{-}$ background, cAMP is not produced, so CAP cannot form the CAP-cAMP complex. Therefore, the promoter lacks positive activation, and RNA polymerase binds weakly, allowing only basal transcription from the promoter.\n\nCombining the two effects: $O^{c}$ ensures that the operon is not blocked by the repressor, so transcription is not shut off by negative control. However, $cyaA^{-}$ prevents positive activation by CAP, so high-level transcription cannot occur. What remains is the weak, intrinsic promoter activity that supports very low, basal transcription.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because absence of cAMP does not eliminate transcription entirely; basal transcription remains.\n- B is incorrect because high, constitutive expression requires CAP-cAMP-mediated activation, which is absent in $cyaA^{-}$.\n- C is correct because the operon will be transcribed at a very low, basal level without repression (due to $O^{c}$) but also without activation (due to $cyaA^{-}$).\n- D is incorrect because $O^{c}$ obviates the need for allolactose to relieve repression.\n- E is incorrect because CAP without cAMP does not act as an active repressor; it simply fails to activate.\n\nTherefore, the best description is very low, basal transcription.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2099335"}]}
