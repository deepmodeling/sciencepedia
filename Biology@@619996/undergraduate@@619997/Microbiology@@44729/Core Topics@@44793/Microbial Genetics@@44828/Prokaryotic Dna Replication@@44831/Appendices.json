This practice guides you through creating a simplified biophysical model to estimate the total time required for an *E. coli* cell to replicate its chromosome.

This exercise is a powerful example of how we can use quantitative reasoning to connect the actions of individual proteins to a complete biological process.", "problem": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) replicates its circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) chromosome bidirectionally from the origin of chromosomal replication (*oriC*), creating two replication forks that traverse the genome in opposite directions until they meet in the terminus region. At each fork, the replicative helicase unwinds the parental duplex ahead of the replisome, and the leading and lagging strands are synthesized by the replicative polymerase. On the lagging strand, primase periodically initiates Okazaki fragments, and each priming event imposes a transient helicase pause via helicase–primase coupling.\n\nAssume the following well-supported features and parameters of the prokaryotic replication machinery:\n- Two forks initiate synchronously at oriC and progress symmetrically around the chromosome; the minimal completion time is set by fork progression and geometry.\n- Fork advancement is limited by the helicase when polymerase is not rate-limiting.\n- The helicase advances at an instantaneous unwinding speed of $v_h$ when not paused.\n- Okazaki fragments have a mean contour length of $\\ell_O$ along the template. After the fork advances by $\\ell_O$, primase initiates the next fragment, imposing a helicase pause of fixed duration $\\tau_p$. During each pause, no net fork advance occurs.\n- Ignore topological, termination trap, and re-initiation effects, and neglect any additional initiation overhead once firing has occurred.\n\nUsing first principles of bidirectional replication geometry and average-velocity definitions, derive the effective fork advance speed from these assumptions and compute the minimal time to complete replication of an E. coli chromosome of length $L$ given:\n- $L = 4.6 \\times 10^6$,\n- $v_h = 800$,\n- $\\ell_O = 1500$,\n- $\\tau_p = 0.15$,\nwhere $L$ and $\\ell_O$ are measured in nucleotides, $v_h$ is in nucleotides per second per fork, and $\\tau_p$ is in seconds.

It is scientifically grounded in the accepted model of prokaryotic DNA replication, presenting a standard biophysical simplification. The parameters provided are within plausible biological ranges for *Escherichia coli*. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and constraints provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimal time to complete replication. This time is determined by the effective speed of the replication forks. The motion of each fork is not continuous; it is a sequence of advancement and pausing events.\n\nFirst, we must derive the effective fork advance speed, which we shall denote $v_{eff}$. This is the average speed over one complete cycle of motion. A single cycle consists of two distinct phases:\n$1$. The helicase advances by a distance equal to the mean contour length of an Okazaki fragment, $\\ell_O$, at its instantaneous speed, $v_h$.\n$2$. The helicase then pauses for a fixed duration, $\\tau_p$, during which primase initiates the next fragment.\n\nThe time taken for the first phase, the movement phase, is $t_{move}$. This is calculated as distance divided by speed:\n$$t_{move} = \\frac{\\ell_O}{v_h}$$\nThe time for the second phase, the pause phase, is given directly as $t_{pause} = \\tau_p$.\n\nThe total time for one complete cycle, $T_{cycle}$, is the sum of the times for these two phases:\n$$T_{cycle} = t_{move} + t_{pause} = \\frac{\\ell_O}{v_h} + \\tau_p$$\nDuring one complete cycle, the net distance advanced by the fork is $\\ell_O$. The effective speed, $v_{eff}$, is the total distance advanced divided by the total time elapsed for one cycle.\n$$v_{eff} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{\\ell_O}{T_{cycle}} = \\frac{\\ell_O}{\\frac{\\ell_O}{v_h} + \\tau_p}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the contributions of the intrinsic speed and the pausing:\n$$v_{eff} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{v_h} + \\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O}}$$\nThis expression correctly represents the effective speed of a single replication fork.\n\nNext, we consider the geometry of bidirectional replication. The chromosome is circular with a total length of $L$. Replication initiates at a single origin, oriC, and proceeds bidirectionally. This means two replication forks are established, moving in opposite directions around the circular chromosome. They will meet in the terminus region, which is diametrically opposite to the origin. Therefore, each fork must traverse a distance equal to half the chromosome length. Let this distance be $D$.\n$$D = \\frac{L}{2}$$\nThe total time for replication, $T_{rep}$, is the time required for a fork to travel the distance $D$ at the effective speed $v_{eff}$.\n$$T_{rep} = \\frac{D}{v_{eff}} = \\frac{L/2}{v_{eff}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{eff}$ into this equation, we obtain the final formula for the total replication time:\n$$T_{rep} = \\frac{L}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{v_{eff}} \\right) = \\frac{L}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{v_h} + \\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe parameters are:\n- $L = 4.6 \\times 10^{6}$ nucleotides\n- $v_h = 800$ nucleotides/second\n- $\\ell_O = 1500$ nucleotides\n- $\\tau_p = 0.15$ seconds\n\nWe first compute the term in the parentheses, which represents the total time required to advance by one nucleotide (the \"slowness\"):\n$$\\frac{1}{v_h} + \\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O} = \\frac{1}{800} \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}} + \\frac{0.15 \\text{ s}}{1500 \\text{ nt}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{v_h} = 0.00125 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O} = 0.0001 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}}$$\nSumming these values gives:\n$$0.00125 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}} + 0.0001 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}} = 0.00135 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}}$$\nNow, we calculate the total replication time, $T_{rep}$, in seconds:\n$$T_{rep} = \\frac{4.6 \\times 10^{6}}{2} \\times 0.00135 \\text{ s}$$\n$$T_{rep} = (2.3 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (1.35 \\times 10^{-3}) \\text{ s}$$\n$$T_{rep} = 2.3 \\times 1.35 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ s}$$\n$$T_{rep} = 3.105 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ s} = 3105 \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in minutes. To convert from seconds to minutes, we divide by $60$:\n$$T_{rep} [\\text{min}] = \\frac{3105}{60} \\text{ min} = 51.75 \\text{ min}$$\nFinally, the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The number $51.75$ has four significant figures.
