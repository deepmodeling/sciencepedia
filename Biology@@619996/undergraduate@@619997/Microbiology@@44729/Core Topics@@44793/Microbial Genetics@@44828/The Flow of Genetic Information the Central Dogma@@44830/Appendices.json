This process relies on a precise reading of the genetic code, including signals that specify where to start and stop translation.

By working through this scenario, you'll practice converting a DNA sequence into its corresponding protein product and see firsthand how a small genetic change can have a dramatic functional consequence.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying a gene in a bacterium that encodes a structural protein. The wild-type version of this protein is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 350 amino acids. A mutant strain is discovered which produces a stable, but non-functional, version of the protein that is only 99 amino acids long. Genetic sequencing of the mutant reveals that this phenotype is the result of a single base-pair substitution.\n\nThe sequence of the DNA **coding strand** for codons 98, 99, and 100 in the *wild-type* gene is given as:\n5'- GCT CTC TGC -3'\n\nFor reference, here is a partial list of mRNA codons and the amino acids they specify:\n- Stop codons: $\\text{UAA}$, $\\text{UAG}$, $\\text{UGA}$\n- Cysteine (Cys): $\\text{UGC}$\n- Arginine (Arg): $\\text{CGC}$\n- Tryptophan (Trp): $\\text{UGG}$\n- Serine (Ser): $\\text{UCC}$\n- Tyrosine (Tyr): $\\text{UAC}$\n\nGiven that translation in the mutant strain terminates after the 99th amino acid has been incorporated into the polypeptide, which of the following single-base substitutions in the wild-type DNA sequence for codon 100 could account for this observation?\n\nA. The T at the first position of codon 100 is replaced by C.\n\nB. The G at the second position of codon 100 is replaced by A.\n\nC. The C at the third position of codon 100 is replaced by A.\n\nD.

The G at the second position of codon 100 is replaced by C.", "solution": "The DNA coding strand has the same sequence as the mRNA except that thymine (T) in DNA corresponds to uracil (U) in mRNA. Therefore, the wild-type codon 100 on the DNA coding strand is TGC, which corresponds to the mRNA codon $\\text{UGC}$. From the codon table provided, $\\text{UGC}$ encodes cysteine, consistent with the wild-type protein.\n\nIn the mutant strain, translation terminates after the 99th amino acid, which means that codon 100 in the mRNA must be a stop codon. The stop codons in mRNA are $\\text{UAA}$, $\\text{UAG}$, and $\\text{UGA}$. Therefore, the corresponding sequences on the DNA coding strand that would yield stop codons in the mRNA are TAA, TAG, and TGA, respectively.\n\nWe consider each proposed single-base substitution in the DNA coding strand for codon 100 (originally TGC) and determine the resulting mRNA codon and its meaning:\n\n- Option A: First position T replaced by C gives CGC on DNA, which yields $\\text{CGC}$ in mRNA and encodes arginine. Not a stop.\n- Option B: Second position G replaced by A gives TAC on DNA, which yields $\\text{UAC}$ in mRNA and encodes tyrosine. Not a stop.\n- Option C: Third position C replaced by A gives TGA on DNA, which yields $\\text{UGA}$ in mRNA, a stop codon. This would terminate translation at codon 100, producing a 99-amino-acid polypeptide.\n- Option D: Third position C replaced by G gives TGG on DNA, which yields $\\text{UGG}$ in mRNA and encodes tryptophan. Not a stop.\n- Option E: Second position G replaced by C gives TCC on DNA, which yields $\\text{UCC}$ in mRNA and encodes serine. Not a stop.\n\nOnly Option C changes TGC to TGA on the DNA coding strand, producing $\\text{UGA}$ in the mRNA, which is a stop codon and explains termination after incorporation of the 99th amino acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2098342"}, {"introduction": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is a two-step process: the ribosome must read the mRNA codon correctly, and the transfer RNA (tRNA) it pairs with must carry the corresponding amino acid. This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario where the second step fails due to a faulty aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase [@problem_id:2098345]. This thought experiment will challenge you to understand that the ribosome trusts the tRNA to bring the right cargo, revealing the crucial role of synthetases in ensuring the central dogma operates accurately.", "problem": "In a particular strain of *E. coli*, the gene encoding the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase has undergone a mutation.

Prokaryotes often use compact regulatory circuits called operons to manage gene expression in response to environmental cues.

Solving this will deepen your understanding of how bacteria efficiently manage their metabolic resources through negative feedback at the genetic level.", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is studying gene regulation in a laboratory strain of *Escherichia coli*. They are investigating the tryptophan (trp) operon, a classic example of a repressible operon. In its wild-type form, this operon contains a regulatory gene (`trpR`) that codes for a repressor protein, a promoter region for RNA polymerase binding, an operator region (`trpO`) that acts as a binding site for the active repressor, and a set of structural genes (`trpE`, `trpD`, `trpC`, `trpB`, `trpA`) that encode the enzymes for tryptophan biosynthesis. The repressor protein, on its own, is inactive. It only becomes active and capable of binding to the operator when it forms a complex with its corepressor, tryptophan.\n\nThe researchers successfully create a mutant strain with a specific genetic modification: a complete deletion of the operator region (`trpO`), while all other parts of the operon, including the `trpR` gene and the promoter, remain intact and functional. They then grow this mutant strain in two different liquid media: one lacking tryptophan and one containing a high concentration of tryptophan.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expression of the structural genes (`trpE-A`) in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The structural genes will only be expressed when the cells are grown in the medium lacking tryptophan.\n\nB. The structural genes will be expressed continuously, regardless of the tryptophan concentration in the medium.\n\nC. The structural genes will never be expressed, regardless of the tryptophan concentration in the medium.\n\nD. The structural genes will only be expressed when the cells are grown in the medium containing a high concentration of tryptophan.\n\nE. The expression of the structural genes will be random and unpredictable due to the instability of the operon.", "solution": "The wild-type trp operon is repressible. The regulatory gene $trpR$ encodes an aporepressor $R$ that is inactive alone. When intracellular tryptophan $T$ is abundant, $R$ binds $T$ to form the active corepressor complex $R\\cdot T$, which binds the operator $O$ and blocks transcription from the promoter $P$. Thus, in the wild type:\n- Low $T$: $R$ inactive, no $R\\cdot T$ binding to $O$, RNA polymerase binds $P$ and transcribes $trpE\\text{–}trpA$.\n- High $T$: $R\\cdot T$ binds $O$, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing $trpE\\text{–}trpA$.\n\nIn the mutant described, the operator $trpO$ is completely deleted, while $trpR$ and $P$ are intact and functional. Repression requires the physical binding of the active $R\\cdot T$ complex to $O$. With $O$ absent, this necessary binding site does not exist, so repression cannot occur under any tryptophan condition. Since $P$ is intact, RNA polymerase can initiate transcription of the structural genes continuously.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether $T$ is low (no $R\\cdot T$) or high (abundant $R\\cdot T$), the absence of $O$ prevents repression, and the structural genes $trpE\\text{–}trpA$ are expressed constitutively. This rules out expression only in low tryptophan (A), never expressed (C), expression only in high tryptophan (D), and randomness (E). The correct description is continuous expression independent of tryptophan concentration (B).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2098314"}]}
