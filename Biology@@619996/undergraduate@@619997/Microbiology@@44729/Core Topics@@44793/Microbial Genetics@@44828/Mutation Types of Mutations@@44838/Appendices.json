This problem places you in the role of a microbial geneticist using reversion analysis—a classic technique to probe the molecular nature of an unknown mutation. By observing how different chemical mutagens, each with a specific mode of action, affect the rate at which a mutant reverts to wild-type, you can infer the type of the original genetic change [@problem_id:2082102]. This practice demonstrates how logic and knowledge of mutagenic mechanisms can be powerful tools for discovery.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a mutant strain of *Salmonella enterica* that is auxotrophic for the amino acid tryptophan (Trp-), meaning it cannot grow unless tryptophan is supplied in the culture medium. Genetic analysis has previously confirmed that this auxotrophy is the result of a single point mutation within the *trpA* gene, which codes for a subunit of the enzyme tryptophan synthase.\n\nTo further characterize the molecular nature of this original mutation, the researcher performs a reversion analysis. Two separate liquid cultures of the Trp- strain are treated with different chemical mutagens, and then plated on a minimal medium that lacks tryptophan. Only bacteria that have reverted to the wild-type (Trp+) phenotype will be able to form colonies on this medium.\n\nThe mutagens used are:\n1.  **2-aminopurine (2-AP):** A base analog of adenine. During DNA replication, it is readily incorporated in place of adenine and pairs with thymine. However, it can undergo a tautomeric shift that allows it to mispair with cytosine. Its primary mutagenic effect is to induce A:T ↔ G:C transitions.\n2.  **Proflavine:** An intercalating agent. This flat molecule inserts itself between adjacent stacked base pairs in a DNA double helix. This can cause DNA polymerase to either insert an extra base or skip a base during replication, leading to single base-pair insertions or deletions (frameshift mutations).\n\nAfter incubation, the researcher observes that the plates corresponding to the 2-AP-treated culture show a high frequency of Trp+ revertant colonies. In contrast, the plates for the proflavine-treated culture show no Trp+ revertant colonies above the spontaneous background reversion rate.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements most accurately describes the original point mutation in the *trpA* gene?\n\nA. The deletion of a single nucleotide base pair.\nB. The substitution of an adenine-thymine base pair with a cytosine-guanine base pair.\nC. The substitution of an adenine-thymine base pair with a thymine-adenine base pair.\nD. The insertion of a single nucleotide base pair.\nE. Both B and C are equally likely possibilities.", "solution": "We are given that the Trp− phenotype arises from a single point mutation in the trpA gene. Reversion analysis shows that treatment with 2-aminopurine (2-AP) produces a high frequency of Trp+ revertants, whereas treatment with proflavine does not increase revertants above spontaneous background.\n\nRelevant mutagenic mechanisms:\n- 2-AP is a base analog that induces transitions between A:T and G:C by mispairing (A-like base that can pair with T or, via tautomeric shift, with C). Therefore, 2-AP primarily causes transitions of the form A:T ↔ G:C.\n- Proflavine intercalates in DNA and causes single base-pair insertions or deletions (frameshifts), not base substitutions.\n\nLogical deductions:\n1. A high reversion rate upon 2-AP treatment indicates that the reversion event required to restore Trp+ is a transition between A:T and G:C, because 2-AP specifically increases the frequency of such transitions. Thus, the original mutation is best classified as a transition between these base pairs rather than a frameshift or a transversion.\n2. The lack of increased revertants with proflavine argues against the original mutation being a frameshift (insertion or deletion), since proflavine would be expected to increase frameshift-mediated true reversions or compensatory frameshift suppressors restoring reading frame.\n3. Among the provided options, A and D describe frameshifts and are inconsistent with the observed lack of reversion increase with proflavine. Option C describes a transversion (A:T to T:A), which is not the primary outcome of 2-AP and so would not be expected to yield a high reversion frequency with 2-AP. Option E claiming B and C are equally likely contradicts the specificity of 2-AP for transitions.\n4. Therefore, the original mutation is most consistent with a transition involving A:T and G:C. Although the experiment does not determine the direction (A:T to G:C or G:C to A:T), the only option that reflects a transition is B: substitution of an adenine-thymine base pair with a cytosine-guanine base pair.\n\nConclusion:\nThe original point mutation is best described as a transition between A:T and G:C; among the choices, B is the most accurate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2082102"}, {"introduction": "Not all mutations are simple loss-of-function; some have more complex and dominant effects.

Genetic analysis reveals it is a heterozygote, carrying one wild-type VS allele and one mutant VS allele.
