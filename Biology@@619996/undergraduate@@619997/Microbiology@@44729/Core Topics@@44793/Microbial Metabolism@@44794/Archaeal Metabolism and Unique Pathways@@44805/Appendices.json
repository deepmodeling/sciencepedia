By performing a simple accounting of ATP investment and payoff, you can directly quantify how these distinct metabolic designs impact the net energy an organism gains from a single molecule of glucose through substrate-level phosphorylation [@problem_id:2054142].", "problem": "Two different prokaryotic organisms are cultured under identical anaerobic conditions with glucose as the sole carbon and energy source. One is a bacterium, and the other is an archaeon, each utilizing a distinct pathway for glucose glycolysis. Your task is to determine the net yield of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from a single molecule of glucose for each organism, considering only substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\n**Organism 1: The Bacterium**\nThis bacterium catabolizes glucose using the standard Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. This pathway can be summarized in two major phases:\n1.  An initial investment phase where 2 molecules of ATP are consumed to activate one molecule of glucose.\n2.  A subsequent payoff phase where the intermediate products are converted to pyruvate, generating a total of 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (reduced form, $\\text{NADH}$).\n\n**Organism 2: The Archaeon**\nThis archaeon uses a variant known as the semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The steps are as follows:\n1.  One molecule of glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, an activation step which consumes one molecule of ATP.\n2.  Glucose-6-phosphate is then oxidized and cleaved to yield one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This process also generates one molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (reduced form, $\\text{NADPH}$). No ATP is produced or consumed in this cleavage step.\n3.  The single molecule of G3P is subsequently metabolized through a sequence of reactions identical to the payoff phase of the EMP pathway. This conversion of one G3P molecule to pyruvate yields 2 molecules of ATP and 1 molecule of $\\text{NADH}$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you should not consider any ATP generated from the re-oxidation of $\\text{NADH}$ or $\\text{NADPH}$ via an electron transport chain.

The researcher cultures the archaeon in a medium where the sole source of carbon is isotopically labeled bicarbonate, $\\text{H}^{13}\\text{CO}_3^-$.\n\nThe first part of the 3-HP/4-HB cycle involves the conversion of one molecule of acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) into one molecule of succinyl-CoA through the net incorporation of two molecules of bicarbonate. The key transformations for this process can be summarized as:\n1.  **First Carboxylation:** An acetyl-CoA molecule is carboxylated using one molecule of bicarbonate, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase.\n2.  **Reduction & Conversion:** The product of the first step undergoes a series of reductions and transformations, ultimately yielding propionyl-CoA.\n3.  **Second Carboxylation:** The resulting propionyl-CoA is carboxylated using a second molecule of bicarbonate, catalyzed by propionyl-CoA carboxylase, to form methylmalonyl-CoA.\n4.  **Rearrangement:** The carbon skeleton of methylmalonyl-CoA is rearranged by a mutase enzyme to form succinyl-CoA.\n\nAssume the cycle starts with unlabeled acetyl-CoA and proceeds for a single, complete turnover to the point of succinyl-CoA formation.

Let the first incorporated bicarbonate carbon be $B_{1}$ and the second be $B_{2}$.\n\nStep 1 (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase): Carboxylation of acetyl-CoA yields malonyl-CoA by adding $B_{1}$ to the acetyl methyl.

Denoting methylmalonyl-CoA carbons as $M_{1}$ (thioester carbonyl), $M_{2}$ (alpha carbon), $M_{3}$ (methyl substituent), and $M_{4}$ (carboxylate substituent), the mapping is\n$$M_{1}=P_{1}=B_{1},\\quad M_{2}=P_{2}=A_{2},\\quad M_{3}=P_{3}=A_{1},\\quad M_{4}=B_{2}\\,.$$\n\nStep 4 (Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase): The 1,2-rearrangement converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA by migration of the acyl (CoA-thioester) group from $M_{2}$ to $M_{3}$, linearizing the skeleton.
