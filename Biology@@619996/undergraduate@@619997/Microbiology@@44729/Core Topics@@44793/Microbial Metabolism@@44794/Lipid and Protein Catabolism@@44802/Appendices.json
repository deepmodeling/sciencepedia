Your task is to identify the essential \"entry-point\" pathways required to begin this process, distinguishing these initial degradative steps from the central metabolic pathways they ultimately feed. This is a crucial first step in understanding the logic of catabolism.", "problem": "A microbiologist isolates a novel bacterium, named *Oleoproteicus vorax*, from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent site. Laboratory analysis reveals that this organism is capable of growing in a minimal medium where the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy is a single type of lipoprotein. A lipoprotein is a complex biochemical assembly whose primary components are proteins and lipids. For *O. vorax* to utilize this lipoprotein for its metabolic needs, it must initiate catabolism of both the protein and lipid constituents.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of catabolic processes must be active in *O. vorax* to break down the lipoprotein into smaller molecules that can enter central metabolism?\n\nA. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle\n\nB. Proteolysis and Beta-oxidation\n\nC. De-novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis\n\nD. Fermentation and denitrification\n\nE. Amylolysis and deamination", "solution": "A lipoprotein is composed of two macromolecular components: a protein (a polypeptide made of amino acids linked by peptide bonds) and a lipid moiety (commonly containing fatty acids esterified to glycerol or as part of phospholipids). To utilize a lipoprotein as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy, the organism must first depolymerize these macromolecules into smaller units and then funnel those units into central metabolism.\n\nFor the protein component, the essential initial catabolic process is proteolysis, which hydrolyzes peptide bonds to yield free amino acids and small peptides. These amino acids can then be further catabolized, typically by deamination or transamination, to produce keto acids that enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle or other central metabolic pathways.\n\nFor the lipid component, the fatty acid chains must be catabolized via beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation sequentially shortens fatty acids, generating acetyl-CoA (and reduced cofactors) that feed directly into the Krebs cycle for further oxidation and energy capture. The glycerol backbone can be converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and enter glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathways, but the indispensable fatty acid catabolic pathway is beta-oxidation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because glycolysis degrades glucose, not proteins or fatty acids; while the Krebs cycle is central, it is not itself the initial macromolecule breakdown required here.\nB is correct because proteolysis is required for protein breakdown, and beta-oxidation is required for fatty acid breakdown—together enabling full catabolism of a lipoprotein.\nC is incorrect because de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis are anabolic, not catabolic, processes.\nD is incorrect because fermentation and denitrification are modes of energy metabolism and terminal electron acceptance, not the primary macromolecule-depolymerizing steps.\nE is incorrect because amylolysis pertains to starch breakdown (irrelevant), and although deamination occurs after proteolysis, it does not substitute for the initial breakdown of protein nor address lipid catabolism.\n\nTherefore, the necessary pair is proteolysis and beta-oxidation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2075659"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of protein breakdown, this practice explores the remarkable precision of metabolic enzymes.
