The bacterium is known to synthesize the amino acid L-cysteine starting from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate. To trace the flow of carbon atoms, the microbiologist provides the bacteria with a specially prepared 3-phosphoglycerate molecule where the carboxyl carbon (C-1) is labeled with the radioactive isotope $^{14}$C. The structure of 3-phosphoglycerate can be represented as (C-3)$H_2(OPO_3^{2-})$-(C-2)$H(OH)$-(C-1)$COO^-$. After a period of incubation, the newly synthesized L-cysteine molecules are isolated and analyzed for the location of the $^{14}$C label. The structure of L-cysteine is ($\\beta$-carbon)$H_2(SH)$-$(\\alpha$-carbon)$H(NH_3^+)$-(carboxyl-carbon)$COO^-$.\n\nAssuming the standard biosynthetic pathway where 3-phosphoglycerate is first converted to L-serine, which then serves as the direct carbon skeleton for L-cysteine, in which position of the L-cysteine molecule would the $^{14}$C label be found?\n\nA. The carboxyl carbon\n\nB. The alpha-carbon (the carbon bonded to the amino group)\n\nC. The beta-carbon (the carbon bonded to the sulfhydryl group)\n\nD. The label is lost as $CO_2$ in a decarboxylation step.\n\nE. The label is equally distributed among all three carbon atoms due to intramolecular rearrangement.", "solution": "We track carbon positions through the canonical pathway 3-phosphoglycerate $\\to$ 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate $\\to$ 3-phosphoserine $\\to$ L-serine $\\to$ O-acetylserine $\\to$ L-cysteine, noting at each step whether the carbon skeleton is rearranged, whether any decarboxylation occurs, and which carbon bears the labeled $^{14}C$.\n\n1) Start with 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), with carbons labeled as $C_{1}$ (carboxylate), $C_{2}$ (middle), and $C_{3}$ (phosphorylated carbon). The labeled atom is $^{14}C$ at $C_{1}$.\n\n2) Oxidation of 3PG to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (via phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase) converts the $C_{2}$ alcohol to a keto group but does not change the carbon skeleton or the positions of $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$. Therefore the mapping remains\n$$\nC_{1}\\to C_{1},\\quad C_{2}\\to C_{2},\\quad C_{3}\\to C_{3}.\n$$\n\n3) Transamination to 3-phosphoserine (via phosphoserine aminotransferase) replaces the keto at $C_{2}$ with an amino group, creating the future $\\alpha$-carbon, again with no change in the carbon skeleton. The mapping is unchanged:\n$$\nC_{1}\\to C_{1},\\quad C_{2}\\to C_{2},\\quad C_{3}\\to C_{3}.\n$$\n\n4) Dephosphorylation to L-serine (via phosphoserine phosphatase) removes the phosphate from $C_{3}$ to yield a hydroxymethyl group. Carbon positions in serine correspond directly to those in 3PG:\n$$\n\\text{Ser carboxyl carbon} = C_{1},\\quad \\text{Ser }\\alpha\\text{-carbon} = C_{2},\\quad \\text{Ser }\\beta\\text{-carbon} = C_{3}.\n$$\nThus, the $^{14}C$ label at 3PG $C_{1}$ becomes the carboxyl carbon of serine.\n\n5) Conversion of serine to cysteine proceeds via O-acetylserine (serine acetyltransferase) followed by substitution with sulfide (O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase). These steps modify the side-chain hydroxyl at the serine $\\beta$-carbon ($C_{3}$) into a sulfhydryl, but they do not alter the three-carbon backbone or remove the carboxyl group. Therefore, the carbon mapping from serine to cysteine is:\n$$\n\\text{Cys carboxyl carbon} = \\text{Ser carboxyl carbon} = C_{1},\\quad\n\\text{Cys }\\alpha\\text{-carbon} = \\text{Ser }\\alpha\\text{-carbon} = C_{2},\\quad\n\\text{Cys }\\beta\\text{-carbon} = \\text{Ser }\\beta\\text{-carbon} = C_{3}.\n$$\n\n6) There is no decarboxylation step in this pathway, so the labeled $^{14}C$ is not lost as $CO_2$. There is also no intramolecular rearrangement that would scramble the carbons among positions.\n\nConclusion: The $^{14}C$ initially at 3PG $C_{1}$ ends up at the carboxyl carbon of L-cysteine.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2074624"}, {"introduction": "Just as carbon flows from central metabolism into biosynthetic products, so too does nitrogen. This exercise extends the principle of isotopic tracing to the flow of nitrogen, demonstrating how a few key molecules act as universal donors for constructing complex structures like nucleotides.
