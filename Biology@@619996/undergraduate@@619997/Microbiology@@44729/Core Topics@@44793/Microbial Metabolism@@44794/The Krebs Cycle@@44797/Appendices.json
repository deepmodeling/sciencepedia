{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding metabolic pathways like the Krebs cycle requires more than just memorizing a sequence of reactions; it demands a precise knowledge of how atoms are rearranged. Isotopic labeling is a powerful experimental technique that allows scientists to trace the journey of specific atoms through complex biochemical transformations. This practice problem [@problem_id:1781299] challenges you to apply this thinking by tracking a labeled carbon atom from pyruvate, sharpening your understanding of the distinction between the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction and the cycle itself.", "problem": "In a metabolic tracer experiment, a culture of eukaryotic cells is supplied with glucose that has been processed by glycolysis to produce pyruvate. This pyruvate is isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}$C) exclusively at its carboxyl carbon atom. The labeled pyruvate is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix where it is converted to acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle).\n\nAssuming the cycle proceeds for one full turn, which of the following statements correctly describes the fate of the $^{14}$C label with respect to the carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) molecules produced?\n\nA. The first molecule of $CO_2$ released *during the Krebs cycle* is radioactive.\n\nB. The labeled carbon atom is released as $CO_2$ *before* the Krebs cycle begins.\n\nC. The second molecule of $CO_2$ released *during the Krebs cycle* is radioactive, but the first is not.\n\nD. Both molecules of $CO_2$ released *during the Krebs cycle* are radioactive.\n\nE. No radioactive $CO_2$ is produced at any stage, from pyruvate oxidation through the first turn of the Krebs cycle.", "solution": "Identify the labeled carbon in pyruvate. Pyruvate has three carbons: the carboxyl carbon ($C_1$), the keto carbon ($C_2$), and the methyl carbon ($C_3$). By hypothesis, only $C_1$ is labeled with $^{14}\\text{C}$.\n\nState the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, before entry into the Krebs cycle):\n$$\n\\text{Pyruvate}(C_1^{14},C_2,C_3) + \\text{CoA-SH} + \\text{NAD}^+ \\to \\text{acetyl-CoA}(C_2,C_3) + {}^{14}\\text{CO}_2 + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+\n$$\nPrinciple: This reaction removes the carboxyl carbon ($C_1$) of pyruvate as carbon dioxide. Therefore, the labeled carbon is released as ${}^{14}\\text{CO}_2$ at this stage, which is prior to the Krebs cycle.\n\nTrack the remaining carbons into the Krebs cycle. The two carbons of acetyl-CoA derive from pyruvate $C_2$ (which becomes the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group) and pyruvate $C_3$ (which becomes the methyl carbon of the acetyl group). These two carbons condense with oxaloacetate to form citrate:\n$$\n\\text{Oxaloacetate}(4\\ \\text{C}) + \\text{acetyl-CoA}(2\\ \\text{C}) \\to \\text{Citrate}(6\\ \\text{C}) + \\text{CoA-SH}\n$$\nPrinciple: In the first turn of the Krebs cycle, the two decarboxylation steps (at isocitrate dehydrogenase and at $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) release carbons that originated from oxaloacetate, not from the incoming acetyl group. Consequently, even if the label had entered as part of acetyl-CoA, it would not have been released during the first cycle turn. However, in this case the labeled carbon never enters the cycle at all, because it is lost as ${}^{14}\\text{CO}_2$ during pyruvate oxidation.\n\nConclusion with respect to the options:\n- The labeled carbon is released as ${}^{14}\\text{CO}_2$ before the Krebs cycle begins, so B is correct.\n- Neither the first nor the second $CO_2$ produced during the Krebs cycle is radioactive in the first turn, so A, C, and D are incorrect.\n- Because ${}^{14}\\text{CO}_2$ is produced during pyruvate oxidation, E is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1781299"}, {"introduction": "While tracking carbon atoms reveals the material flow through the Krebs cycle, its central bioenergetic role is to harvest high-energy electrons. These electrons, captured by carriers like $NAD^+$ and FAD, are the currency that will ultimately power ATP synthesis. This exercise [@problem_id:2099066] provides fundamental practice in quantifying the cycle's energetic yield from a single acetyl-CoA molecule, connecting the pathway's chemical steps to its ultimate purpose.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the central metabolism of a newly discovered chemoorganoheterotrophic bacterium, *Acidovorax syntheticus*. This organism is being studied for its potential in bioremediation due to its ability to completely oxidize organic acetyl groups. The primary pathway for this oxidation is the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, commonly known as the Krebs cycle. This cycle begins when a two-carbon acetyl group, delivered by acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), condenses with a four-carbon molecule of oxaloacetate. In the subsequent series of enzymatic reactions, the acetyl group is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide, and high-energy electrons are captured by the primary electron carriers, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ($\\text{NAD}^+$) and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD).\n\nAssuming the TCA cycle in *Acidovorax syntheticus* operates identically to the canonical pathway found in textbooks, determine the total number of electrons harvested by both $\\text{NAD}^+$ and FAD combined during one complete turn of the cycle, starting from the entry of a single acetyl-CoA molecule.", "solution": "The canonical tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidizes the two-carbon acetyl group from one acetyl-CoA completely to carbon dioxide while reducing the electron carriers $\\text{NAD}^+$ and FAD. During one complete turn starting from one acetyl-CoA, the standard stoichiometry of the cycle yields three NADH and one $\\text{FADH}_2$.\n\nEach reduction of $\\text{NAD}^+$ to NADH corresponds to the acceptance of two electrons, and each reduction of FAD to $\\text{FADH}_2$ also corresponds to the acceptance of two electrons.
