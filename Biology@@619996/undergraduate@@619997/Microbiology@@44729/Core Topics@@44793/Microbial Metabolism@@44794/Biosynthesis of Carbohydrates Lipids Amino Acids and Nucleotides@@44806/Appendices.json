This first practice problem explores the critical pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis by examining a hypothetical mutant. By predicting the growth requirements of a bacterium lacking the enzyme Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, you will gain insight into how scientists identify essential, rate-limiting steps in metabolic pathways and the logic behind nutritional rescue experiments [@problem_id:2056812].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a mutant strain of a bacterium that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC). ACC is the enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. The researcher prepares two types of liquid culture media to study the growth requirements of this mutant:\n\n1.  Minimal Medium (MM): A defined medium containing glucose as the sole carbon and energy source, along with all necessary inorganic salts for growth.\n2.  Supplemented Medium (SM): This medium consists of the Minimal Medium (MM) with the addition of a sterile mixture of various long-chain fatty acids.\n\nBoth the wild-type bacterium and the ACC mutant strain are inoculated into separate flasks containing MM and SM. The flasks are then incubated at the bacterium's optimal growth temperature with aeration. Which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed after an appropriate incubation period?\n\nA. Both the wild-type and the mutant strains will grow in MM, but the mutant will grow to a higher cell density in SM.\n\nB. The mutant strain will be unable to grow in either MM or SM because the intracellular accumulation of unutilized acetyl-CoA is lethal.\n\nC. The mutant strain will grow successfully in MM but will be inhibited and fail to grow in SM.\n\nD. The wild-type strain will grow in both MM and SM, but the mutant strain will fail to grow in MM and will only grow in SM.\n\nE. Both the wild-type and the mutant strains will fail to grow in MM because glucose catabolism is dependent on a functional ACC enzyme.", "solution": "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis, converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA:\n$$\\text{acetyl-CoA} + \\text{HCO}_{3}^{-} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{malonyl-CoA} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}.$$\nMalonyl-CoA is the essential two-carbon donor used by fatty acid synthase to elongate acyl chains; thus, without ACC activity, de novo fatty acid synthesis is blocked at the first step. Fatty acids are indispensable precursors for phospholipid biosynthesis, which is required to build and maintain the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, a complete loss-of-function ACC mutant cannot synthesize membrane fatty acids de novo.\n\nIn Minimal Medium (MM), glucose is the sole carbon and energy source with inorganic salts. Although glucose catabolism via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle does not require ACC, the mutant will be unable to grow because it cannot synthesize the fatty acids required for membrane biogenesis in the absence of exogenous fatty acids. In contrast, the wild-type strain possesses functional ACC, produces malonyl-CoA, and therefore synthesizes fatty acids de novo; it will grow in MM.\n\nIn Supplemented Medium (SM), MM is supplemented with a mixture of long-chain fatty acids. Many bacteria can import and activate exogenous fatty acids (for example, via acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP synthetases) and incorporate them into phospholipids through the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase pathway. Supplying long-chain fatty acids therefore bypasses the need for de novo synthesis from malonyl-CoA, rescuing the growth defect of the ACC mutant. The wild-type also grows in SM, either synthesizing fatty acids de novo or incorporating exogenous ones.\n\nRejecting alternatives:\n- The claim that intracellular acetyl-CoA accumulation is lethal is unwarranted: acetyl-CoA can be metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle or diverted to other pathways, so option B is incorrect.\n- ACC is not required for glucose catabolism, so option E is incorrect.\n- The mutant cannot grow in MM without fatty acids (contradicting A and C), but will grow when provided with exogenous long-chain fatty acids (supporting D).\n\nThus, the most likely observation is that the wild-type grows in both media, while the ACC mutant fails in MM and grows only in SM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2056812"}, {"introduction": "Biosynthetic pathways are often not linear, but are branched networks producing multiple essential compounds from a common precursor. This exercise challenges you to act as a metabolic detective, using a series of nutritional supplementation results to pinpoint a specific enzymatic defect within the multi-branched shikimate pathway. Solving this puzzle demonstrates how auxotrophic mutants are powerful tools for dissecting the intricate architecture of metabolism [@problem_id:2056764].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying amino acid biosynthesis in *Escherichia coli*. A mutant strain is isolated that cannot grow on a glucose minimal medium, which is a medium containing only glucose as a carbon and energy source, along with essential salts. The wild-type strain, from which the mutant was derived, grows readily on this medium. The researcher conducts a series of supplementation experiments to identify the metabolic defect. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  Growth on minimal medium supplemented with phenylalanine: No growth.\n2.  Growth on minimal medium supplemented with tyrosine: No growth.\n3.  Growth on minimal medium supplemented with tryptophan: No growth.\n4.  Growth on minimal medium supplemented with all three aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan): Growth is restored to wild-type levels.\n5.

Chorismate mutase\n\nB. Anthranilate synthase\n\nC. Prephenate dehydratase\n\nD. 3-Dehydroquinate synthase\n\nE. Tryptophan synthase", "solution": "We interpret the growth phenotypes using the logic of the shikimate pathway that produces the three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan from central carbon metabolism.\n\n1) Observation analysis:\n- No growth with phenylalanine alone, tyrosine alone, or tryptophan alone implies the mutant is deficient in all three aromatic amino acids, not just one branch. Therefore, the block must be upstream of the branch point that separates synthesis of phenylalanine/tyrosine from tryptophan, i.e., upstream of chorismate.\n- Growth restored with all three aromatic amino acids indicates that supplying all three end products bypasses the blocked biosynthetic route.\n- Growth restored with shikimate indicates the block lies upstream of shikimate in the shikimate pathway, because exogenous shikimate can be taken up and converted downstream to chorismate and then to the three aromatic amino acids.\n\n2) Pathway position:\n- The shikimate pathway proceeds from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate to 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP), then to 3-dehydroquinate (by 3-dehydroquinate synthase), then to 3-dehydroshikimate, shikimate, shikimate-3-phosphate, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate, and chorismate. Chorismate is the branch point: to tryptophan via anthranilate synthase and to phenylalanine/tyrosine via chorismate mutase to prephenate (with prephenate dehydratase leading to phenylalanine and prephenate dehydrogenase to tyrosine).\n\n3) Evaluate options against the observations:\n- A. Chorismate mutase: A defect would block phenylalanine and tyrosine only, leaving tryptophan synthesis intact. Shikimate supplementation would not overcome a block after chorismate. This contradicts the rescue by shikimate.\n- B. Anthranilate synthase: A defect would block tryptophan only. Tryptophan supplementation alone should rescue, which is not observed; shikimate would not help.\n- C. Prephenate dehydratase: A defect would block phenylalanine only. Phenylalanine supplementation alone should rescue, which is not observed; shikimate would not help.\n- D. 3-Dehydroquinate synthase: A defect upstream of shikimate would block production of all three aromatic amino acids. Supplying any single aromatic amino acid would be insufficient, but supplying all three would rescue. Exogenous shikimate would bypass the block and restore growth. This matches all observations.\n- E. Tryptophan synthase: A defect would block tryptophan only. Tryptophan supplementation alone should rescue, which is not observed; shikimate would not help.\n\n4) Conclusion:\nOnly a defect in 3-dehydroquinate synthase explains both the need for all three aromatic amino acids and the rescue by shikimate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2056764"}, {"introduction": "Successful biosynthesis is not just about producing the right molecules, but also about preventing the accumulation of incorrect or harmful ones. This final problem shifts our focus from production to quality control within the nucleotide precursor pool, a concept vital for maintaining genetic integrity. By analyzing the consequences of a non-functional dUTPase enzyme, you will uncover the direct and dramatic link between nucleotide metabolism and the mechanisms of DNA damage and repair [@problem_id:2056748].", "problem": "In the biosynthesis of nucleotides, the enzyme dUTPase plays a crucial role by catalyzing the hydrolysis of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) into deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) and pyrophosphate. This reaction is vital for maintaining a low intracellular concentration of dUTP. Consider a mutant bacterial strain in which the gene encoding for dUTPase is defective, resulting in a non-functional enzyme. This mutant strain is cultured in a nutrient-rich medium that supports rapid growth and DNA replication. Assuming all other cellular machinery, including DNA polymerases and repair enzymes like Uracil-DNA Glycosylase, are fully functional, what is the most direct and significant consequence for the integrity of the bacterium's newly synthesized DNA?\n\nA. A significant increase in the rate of C to T transition mutations in the genetic code.\n\nB. The formation of stable RNA-DNA hybrid structures throughout the newly replicated chromosome.\n\nC. Widespread fragmentation and breakage of the newly synthesized DNA strands.\n\nD. A complete and immediate halt to all DNA replication activity due to a lack of thymine precursors.\n\nE. The irreversible cross-linking of the two strands of the DNA double helix.", "solution": "The physiological role of dUTPase is to hydrolyze dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, thereby lowering intracellular dUTP and supplying dUMP for thymidylate synthesis:\n$$\\mathrm{dUTP} + \\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\xrightarrow{\\text{dUTPase}} \\mathrm{dUMP} + \\mathrm{PP_{i}}.$$\nIn a dUTPase-defective mutant, the catalytic flux of this reaction is reduced to near zero, so the steady-state concentration $[\\mathrm{dUTP}]$ increases. DNA polymerases cannot perfectly discriminate between dUTP and dTTP; therefore, the probability that uracil is incorporated opposite adenine during replication increases with $[\\mathrm{dUTP}]$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{dUTP}]}{[\\mathrm{dUTP}] + [\\mathrm{dTTP}]},$$\nso an increase in $[\\mathrm{dUTP}]$ leads to a corresponding increase in $p_{\\mathrm{U}}$.\n\nUracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), assumed fully functional, recognizes uracil in DNA and initiates base excision repair:\n$$\\text{DNA}-\\mathrm{U} \\xrightarrow{\\text{UDG}} \\text{DNA AP-site} \\xrightarrow{\\text{AP endonuclease}} \\text{single-strand nick}.$$\nWhen uracil incorporation is frequent, the density of AP sites and nicks becomes high along newly synthesized DNA. Closely spaced nicks on opposite strands convert to double-strand breaks during replication or processing. If the lesion density is $\\lambda$ per unit length, the probability of two opposing lesions within a short window scales approximately with $\\lambda^{2}$, making double-strand breaks and chromosomal fragmentation a direct consequence of elevated uracil incorporation plus active repair.\n\nThis mechanism yields widespread fragmentation and breakage of newly synthesized DNA strands. Alternative options are not the most direct or significant consequence here:\n- C to T transitions (A) arise from cytosine deamination and persistence of uracil opposite guanine; with active UDG and uracil being inserted opposite adenine, the immediate outcome is repair-mediated nicking rather than point mutations.\n- RNA-DNA hybrids (B) are unrelated to dUTP pools.\n- An immediate halt to replication (D) does not occur; dTTP can still be formed via other routes, and replication proceeds until damage accumulates.\n- Cross-linking (E) is not produced by elevated dUTP or its repair.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant effect is chromosomal fragmentation due to excessive uracil incorporation followed by base excision repair–mediated strand breaks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2056748"}]}
