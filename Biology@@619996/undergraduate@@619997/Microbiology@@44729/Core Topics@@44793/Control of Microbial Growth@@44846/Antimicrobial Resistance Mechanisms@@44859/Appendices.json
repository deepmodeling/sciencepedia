The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) provides this critical metric, defining the lowest drug concentration that prevents bacterial growth. By comparing the MIC for a wild-type bacterium to a mutant strain lacking a specific resistance gene, we can precisely measure that gene's contribution to survival. This first exercise [@problem_id:2053138] will guide you through this fundamental calculation for one of the most common resistance strategies: efflux pumps.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the role of an efflux pump in conferring antibiotic resistance in a bacterial strain. Efflux pumps are membrane proteins that actively transport antimicrobial agents out of the cell, thereby lowering the intracellular drug concentration and allowing the bacterium to survive at higher external concentrations of the drug.\n\nThe researcher works with a wild-type (WT) strain of the bacterium and a mutant strain in which the primary gene for the efflux pump has been deleted. To quantify the effect of the pump, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of a specific antibiotic is determined for both strains. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial drug that prevents the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n- The MIC for the wild-type (WT) strain is 128.0 µg/mL.\n- The MIC for the mutant strain lacking the efflux pump gene is 2.0 µg/mL.\n\nThe fold-change in resistance is calculated as the ratio of the higher MIC value to the lower MIC value. This ratio indicates how many times more resistant one strain is compared to another.\n\nCalculate the fold-change in resistance conferred by the presence of the active efflux pump in the wild-type strain compared to the mutant strain. Present your answer as a single numerical value.", "solution": "Define $M_{\\text{WT}}$ as the MIC of the wild-type strain and $M_{\\text{mut}}$ as the MIC of the mutant strain lacking the efflux pump.

This is particularly true for 'prodrugs,' which are harmless compounds that must be converted into their toxic form by a bacterial enzyme. In this problem [@problem_id:2053136], you will explore how a loss-of-function mutation in such an activating enzyme can confer resistance, applying principles of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to determine the dramatic consequence on the drug's MIC.", "problem": "A novel prodrug, \"Nitro-X,\" is being tested against a pathogenic bacterium, *Pseudomonas critici*. The drug is inert until it is converted into its active, bactericidal form, \"Active-X,\" by an intracellular bacterial enzyme called nitroreductase B (NfsB). The rate of formation of Active-X from Nitro-X by the NfsB enzyme is dependent on the intracellular concentration of the prodrug, $[Nitro-X]_{intra}$, and is characterized by a maximum velocity $V_{max}$ and a Michaelis constant $K_M$. Once formed, Active-X is naturally degraded or removed from the cell via a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{deg}$.\n\nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the prodrug is defined as the minimum external concentration, $[Nitro-X]_{ext}$, required to achieve a critical intracellular steady-state concentration of the active form, $[Active-X]_{crit}$, which is necessary to halt bacterial growth.\n\nFor this system, you can make the following assumptions:\n1. The intracellular prodrug concentration rapidly equilibrates with the external medium, such that $[Nitro-X]_{intra} = [Nitro-X]_{ext}$.\n2. A steady-state intracellular concentration of Active-X is quickly established, where its rate of formation by NfsB equals its rate of removal.\n\nA wild-type (WT) strain of *P. critici* is susceptible to the prodrug. The relevant parameters for the WT strain are:\n- Michaelis constant for NfsB: $K_M = 40.0 \\text{ µM}$\n- Maximum potential active drug concentration: $C_{max, WT} = \\frac{V_{max, WT}}{k_{deg}} = 85.0 \\text{ µM}$\n- Critical concentration for growth inhibition: $[Active-X]_{crit} = 1.50 \\text{ µM}$\n\nA resistant (R) strain is isolated. Analysis reveals that this strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene for NfsB. The mutation does not affect the substrate binding affinity ($K_M$ is unchanged), but it severely impairs the enzyme's catalytic turnover. The catalytic activity of the mutant NfsB enzyme is only 4.00% of the wild-type enzyme's activity. All other cellular processes, including drug uptake and removal ($k_{deg}$), remain unchanged.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the MIC for the resistant strain to the MIC for the wild-type strain, $\\frac{MIC_R}{MIC_{WT}}$.

The microbiologist then performs two additional experiments using metabolic inhibitors:\n1.  The addition of Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a proton ionophore that dissipates the proton gradient across the cell membrane, results in a rapid and significant increase in intracellular fluorescence.\n2.  The addition of sodium azide, an inhibitor of the respiratory electron transport chain, has no discernible effect on the intracellular fluorescence levels over the experimental time course.\n\nThese results suggest that the efflux pump is a proton-drug antiporter, coupling the efflux of one molecule of the antibiotic to the influx of one or more protons.
