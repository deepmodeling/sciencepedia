This practice problem introduces a classic experimental design that cleverly uses different types of mRNA to distinguish between these two possibilities. By analyzing the results, you can learn how biochemists deduce an antibiotic's primary stage of action, providing a foundational skill in mechanistic investigation [@problem_id:2077734].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a newly discovered antibiotic, \"Novamycin,\" isolated from a soil bacterium. To determine its mechanism of action, the microbiologist uses a bacterial cell-free translation system. This system contains all the necessary components for protein synthesis: ribosomes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, initiation factors (IFs), elongation factors (EFs), and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The experiment is designed to measure the incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid, ³H-phenylalanine, into polypeptides.\n\nTwo different types of messenger RNA (mRNA) are used in parallel experiments:\n1.  **Natural mRNA:** A standard bacterial mRNA containing a proper Shine-Dalgarno sequence and an AUG start codon, followed by a coding sequence rich in phenylalanine codons.\n2.  **Circular poly(U) mRNA:** A synthetic, circular mRNA consisting only of uracil nucleotides. This mRNA lacks a start codon and can only be translated efficiently when the magnesium ion concentration ([Mg²⁺]) is raised to a high level, which forces ribosomes to bind and begin translation without the standard initiation sequence or initiation factors.\n\nThe following observations are made:\n\n*   **Experiment 1:** In the presence of the natural mRNA and a normal [Mg²⁺], the addition of Novamycin almost completely prevents the incorporation of ³H-phenylalanine into protein.\n*   **Experiment 2:** In the presence of the circular poly(U) mRNA and a high [Mg²⁺], robust incorporation of ³H-phenylalanine is observed. When Novamycin is added to this system, there is no significant change in the level of ³H-phenylalanine incorporation compared to the control without the antibiotic.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely mechanism of action for Novamycin?\n\nA. It interferes with the formation of the 70S initiation complex.\n\nB. It blocks the peptidyl transferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit.\n\nC. It prevents the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA.\n\nD. It induces misreading of the mRNA codons, leading to incorrect amino acid incorporation.\n\nE. It inhibits the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site.", "solution": "The experimental system measures translation by tracking incorporation of ³H-phenylalanine. With natural mRNA under normal [Mg²⁺], bacterial translation proceeds via canonical initiation: the 30S subunit, with IF1, $IF2 \\cdot GTP$, and IF3, pairs the Shine–Dalgarno sequence with 16S rRNA, recruits initiator $f\\text{Met-tRNA}^{f\\text{Met}}$ to the P-site to form the 30S initiation complex, then the 50S subunit joins to form the 70S initiation complex and elongation begins. This can be summarized as\n$$\n30\\mathrm{S} + \\text{IFs} + \\text{mRNA} + f\\text{Met-tRNA}^{f\\text{Met}} + \\text{GTP} \\rightarrow \\text{30S IC}, \\quad \\text{30S IC} + 50\\mathrm{S} \\rightarrow \\text{70S IC} \\rightarrow \\text{elongation}.\n$$\nIn Experiment 1, Novamycin almost completely prevents ³H-phenylalanine incorporation with natural mRNA, indicating that an early step required for canonical initiation is blocked, preventing entry into elongation.\n\nThe circular poly(U) mRNA encodes only UUU codons, which specify phenylalanine, and under high [Mg²⁺] ribosomes can bind and initiate translation without the standard initiation signals or initiation factors. This “factor-independent” initiation bypasses the need for the canonical 70S initiation complex assembly pathway. In Experiment 2, robust ³H-phenylalanine incorporation occurs with poly(U) at high [Mg²⁺] and is unaffected by Novamycin, demonstrating that the antibiotic’s target is not required under these forced initiation conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- If Novamycin blocked peptidyl transferase activity (option B), prevented translocation (option C), or inhibited aminoacyl-tRNA A-site binding (option E), elongation would be impaired in both systems, including the poly(U) high [Mg²⁺] condition; this contradicts Experiment 2.\n- If it induced misreading (option D), incorporation would not be abolished with natural mRNA and would likely still alter incorporation with poly(U); this does not fit the strong inhibition in Experiment 1 and the lack of effect in Experiment 2.\n- Interference with formation of the 70S initiation complex (option A) explains both observations: it abolishes translation with natural mRNA under normal initiation, but is bypassed when initiation is forced by high [Mg²⁺] on circular poly(U), leaving elongation intact.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism is interference with formation of the 70S initiation complex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2077734"}, {"introduction": "Once an antibiotic is identified as an elongation inhibitor, the next challenge is to uncover its specific mechanism. This exercise explores a common and easily understood mode of action: the physical blockage of a critical site on the ribosome. By examining a hypothetical scenario where an antibiotic prevents transfer RNA (tRNA) from entering the ribosomal A-site, you will learn to connect this specific action to a major class of real-world antibiotics [@problem_id:2077726].", "problem": "In a drug discovery program, a novel compound, designated EX-401, is being evaluated for its antibacterial properties. Laboratory experiments are conducted using an in vitro bacterial protein synthesis system. The system includes bacterial ribosomes, messenger RNA (mRNA) for a specific test protein, all necessary initiation and elongation factors, and a pool of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which are tRNA molecules charged with their corresponding amino acids.\n\nThe experiment reveals the following sequence of events in the presence of EX-401:\n1. The 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits correctly assemble on the mRNA strand.\n2. The initiator tRNA successfully binds to the start codon at the ribosomal P-site, forming the initiation complex.\n3. However, no subsequent elongation occurs. Further biochemical analysis demonstrates that EX-401 binds with high affinity to a component of the ribosome, physically obstructing the A-site. This blockage prevents any charged tRNA from docking and pairing with the next codon on the mRNA.\n\nBased on this specific mechanism of action, which of the following established antibiotic classes does EX-401 most closely mimic, and which ribosomal subunit is its primary target?\n\nA. Macrolide; targets the 50S subunit.\n\nB. Aminoglycoside; targets the 30S subunit.\n\nC. Tetracycline; targets the 30S subunit.\n\nD. Chloramphenicol; targets the 50S subunit.\n\nE. Quinolone; targets DNA gyrase.", "solution": "We start from the experimental observations:\n1. The 30S and 50S subunits assemble correctly on mRNA, and the initiator tRNA binds at the P-site to form a proper initiation complex. Therefore, drugs that prevent initiation complex formation are unlikely.\n2. No elongation occurs because a compound binds to the ribosome and physically obstructs the A-site, preventing any aminoacyl-tRNA from entering and pairing with the next codon.\n\nNow map these features to known antibiotic mechanisms:\n- Aminoglycosides bind the 30S subunit but characteristically cause misreading of mRNA and can interfere with initiation complex formation. Since the initiation complex forms correctly here, this is less consistent.\n- Tetracyclines bind the 30S subunit and specifically prevent the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site, thereby blocking elongation at the stage of A-site entry. This matches the described A-site obstruction with initiation intact.\n- Macrolides bind the 50S subunit and block translocation along the mRNA; they do not primarily prevent A-site entry of aminoacyl-tRNA.\n- Chloramphenicol binds the 50S subunit and inhibits peptidyl transferase activity, blocking peptide bond formation; A-site entry can still occur.\n- Quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase and do not target the ribosome.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism described—A-site blockade preventing aminoacyl-tRNA docking after a normal initiation complex forms—most closely matches tetracyclines targeting the 30S subunit.\n\nHence, the correct choice is tetracycline; targets the 30S subunit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2077726"}, {"introduction": "The effects of an antibiotic are not always a simple \"on/off\" switch and can be surprisingly complex. This advanced problem challenges you to think about how a single antibiotic can have different effects at different concentrations—a crucial concept in both microbiology and pharmacology. You will develop a model to explain how binding to a single ribosomal site could cause translational errors at low concentrations but completely halt protein synthesis at high concentrations, deepening your understanding of molecular interactions [@problem_id:2077788].", "problem": "A newly discovered antibiotic, named \"Concentramycin,\" is found to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. Biochemical studies reveal that its sole molecular target is the 30S ribosomal subunit. Further investigation of its mechanism reveals a peculiar concentration-dependent dual action.\nAt low, sub-lethal concentrations, bacteria treated with Concentramycin continue to synthesize full-length proteins, but these proteins are non-functional and rapidly degraded due to significant misfolding. This effect is traced to a high rate of incorrect amino acid incorporation, suggesting the antibiotic causes codon misreading.\nAt high, bactericidal concentrations, protein synthesis is completely arrested. Ribosome profiling experiments show an accumulation of ribosomes stalled with a peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site and a deacylated tRNA in the P-site, indicating a failure of the translocation step that normally moves the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site.\n\nBased on this evidence, which of the following provides the most plausible and parsimonious explanation for the dual mechanism of Concentramycin?\n\nA. Concentramycin has two distinct binding sites on the 30S subunit: a high-affinity site that distorts the E-site to cause premature tRNA release, and a low-affinity site that sterically hinders the binding of Elongation Factor G (EF-G), thus blocking translocation.\n\nB. At low concentrations, Concentramycin binds directly to the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) as it enters the ribosome, causing slippage and misreading. At high concentrations, it binds to the 16S rRNA at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence binding site, preventing the formation of new initiation complexes.\n\nC. Concentramycin binds to a single site within the decoding center of the 30S subunit. At low concentrations (stochastic binding), it induces a minor, transient conformational change that reduces the fidelity of codon-anticodon pairing in the A-site. At high concentrations (saturating binding), it locks the subunit in a rigid conformation that is incompatible with the large-scale structural rearrangements required for translocation.\n\nD. At low concentrations, Concentramycin binds to protein S12 of the 30S subunit, accelerating the rate of peptide bond formation but reducing proofreading. At high concentrations, it crosses into the 50S subunit and allosterically inhibits the peptidyl transferase center, preventing any further elongation.\n\nE. Concentramycin is an enzyme that, at a low rate, methylates specific bases in the 16S rRNA, leading to misreading. At high concentrations, the antibiotic's substrate (the ribosome) becomes saturated, and the excess antibiotic molecules aggregate on the ribosome surface, physically obstructing the A-site.", "solution": "We are told that Concentramycin’s sole molecular target is the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Two distinct, concentration-dependent phenotypes are observed:\n\n1) At low, sub-lethal concentrations, full-length proteins are synthesized but are misfolded and non-functional due to a high rate of incorrect amino acid incorporation. This directly indicates a decrease in translational fidelity via codon misreading in the A-site of the decoding center of the 30S subunit. This phenomenon is well established for agents that bind within the decoding center of 16S rRNA and stabilize near-cognate tRNA interactions, thereby lowering the energetic discrimination that normally enforces correct codon-anticodon pairing and proofreading.\n\n2) At high, bactericidal concentrations, protein synthesis is fully arrested. Ribosome profiling shows accumulation of ribosomes with peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site and deacylated tRNA in the P-site. This configuration is characteristic of a block in the translocation step that normally follows peptide bond formation. Translocation requires large-scale conformational changes of the ribosome, including intersubunit rotation and 30S head swivel, coordinated with EF-G and GTP hydrolysis. If the 30S subunit is locked in a rigid conformation, translocation cannot proceed, resulting in the observed pre-translocation state.\n\nGiven these observations, the most parsimonious model is that the antibiotic binds a single site within the decoding center of the 30S subunit and that its occupancy and the degree of conformational stabilization it induces are concentration-dependent. At low concentrations (stochastic, partial occupancy), the antibiotic perturbs the conformational equilibria only modestly, decreasing fidelity (codon misreading) without halting elongation. At high concentrations (saturating occupancy), the same binding site enforces a rigid conformation that is incompatible with the dynamic rearrangements necessary for EF-G–mediated translocation, thereby arresting translation with peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site and deacylated tRNA in the P-site.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\n- Option A posits two distinct binding sites on the 30S subunit, involving E-site distortion and EF-G steric hindrance. The misreading phenotype is not explained by E-site distortion, and proposing two sites is less parsimonious than a single-site mechanism. Moreover, the observed pre-translocation state is more naturally explained by inhibited conformational dynamics rather than direct EF-G steric block.\n- Option B invokes direct binding to mRNA and, at high concentrations, blocking initiation via the Shine-Dalgarno site. This contradicts the stated sole target being the 30S subunit itself and does not match the profiling data that specifically indicate a translocation stall during elongation, not an initiation block.\n- Option D requires crossing into the 50S subunit and inhibiting the peptidyl transferase center, contradicting the premise that the sole target is the 30S. Inhibition of the peptidyl transferase center would block peptide bond formation, which would not yield the specific pre-translocation A-site peptidyl/P-site deacylated tRNA configuration observed.\n- Option E proposes that the antibiotic is an enzyme that methylates 16S rRNA, which is implausible for a small-molecule antibiotic and would produce largely concentration-independent, covalent effects; aggregation-based obstruction at high concentrations is non-specific and not parsimonious.\n\nTherefore, a single-site binding within the decoding center producing a dose-dependent continuum from fidelity defects to conformational locking that prevents translocation best fits all the evidence and is the most parsimonious explanation.
