This practice challenges you to apply this principle by selecting an appropriate membrane filter to separate bacteriophages from bacteria, a common task in virology research.

This exercise presents a classic experiment to visually demonstrate the germicidal efficacy of UV-C light, which works by inducing DNA damage in microorganisms. By predicting the growth pattern of bacteria on a partially shielded agar plate, you will develop a strong conceptual understanding of how UV sterilization functions and recognize the importance of direct exposure for this method to be effective [@problem_id:2085359].", "problem": "An undergraduate microbiology student is conducting an experiment to demonstrate a physical method of microbial control. The student first prepares a nutrient agar plate and creates a confluent \"lawn\" by evenly spreading a liquid culture of *Serratia marcescens*, a bacterium known for producing a red pigment at room temperature. Immediately after inoculation, the student places a sterile, standard glass petri dish lid so that it completely covers exactly one half of the agar surface, leaving the other half exposed to the air. The entire plate, with the half-lid in place, is then positioned under a germicidal lamp that emits Ultraviolet (UV) C radiation (wavelength of 254 nm) for 15 minutes. After exposure, the half-lid is removed, the main plate lid is replaced, and the plate is incubated for 48 hours at room temperature.\n\nAssuming the experimental procedure is performed correctly, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the pattern of bacterial growth on the agar surface after incubation?\n\nA. A uniform lawn of red-pigmented bacteria will cover the entire surface of the agar plate.\nB. No bacterial growth will be visible anywhere on the agar plate.\nC. Bacterial growth will be visible only on the half of the plate that was left uncovered during the UV exposure.\nD. Bacterial growth will be visible only on the half of the plate that was covered by the glass lid during the UV exposure.\nE. A lawn of bacteria will cover the entire plate, but the colonies on the half exposed to UV light will be white instead of red, while the covered half will show red colonies.", "solution": "1. Identify the germicidal agent and its mechanism: The plate is exposed to UV-C radiation with wavelength $\\lambda = 254\\ \\text{nm}$. UV-C at this wavelength is strongly germicidal because it induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in DNA, especially thymine dimers, which block replication and transcription and thereby kill cells or prevent colony formation.\n\n2. Define exposure dose and lethality conceptually: Let the incident UV-C intensity on the exposed agar surface be $I_{0}$ and the exposure time be $t$. The dose on the uncovered half is $D_{\\text{uncovered}} = I_{0} t$. Let $D_{\\text{lethal}}$ denote the approximate dose required to prevent visible growth. For typical germicidal lamps and bacterial lawns, a prolonged exposure satisfies $D_{\\text{uncovered}} \\ge D_{\\text{lethal}}$, leading to no visible growth on the exposed surface.\n\n3. Consider the optical properties of the cover: A standard glass petri dish lid is effectively opaque to UV-C at $\\lambda = 254\\ \\text{nm}$ due to strong absorption by glass. Denote the transmitted intensity through glass as $I_{\\text{glass}}$. For UV-C, $I_{\\text{glass}} \\approx 0$ relative to $I_{0}$, so the shielded dose is $D_{\\text{covered}} = I_{\\text{glass}} t \\ll D_{\\text{lethal}}$.\n\n4. Predict growth pattern from dose relations:\n   - Uncovered half: $D_{\\text{uncovered}} \\ge D_{\\text{lethal}} \\Rightarrow$ cells are killed or unable to form visible colonies, so no growth appears.\n   - Covered half: $D_{\\text{covered}} \\ll D_{\\text{lethal}} \\Rightarrow$ cells are not lethally irradiated and will grow into a confluent lawn.\n\n5. Pigmentation expectation: Serratia marcescens produces a red pigment at room temperature under normal growth. On the covered half where growth occurs, colonies will therefore be red. On the uncovered half, absence of surviving cells implies no colonies and thus no pigmentation. While UV can induce rare mutations that might alter pigment, the dominant and most accurate outcome under germicidal dosing is absence of growth on the uncovered side rather than a pigmented change in surviving colonies.\n\n6. Conclusion: Bacterial growth will be visible only on the half of the plate that was covered by the glass lid during UV exposure, consistent with a physical shielding demonstration of UV-C microbial control.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2085359"}, {"introduction": "In the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, achieving a high degree of sterility is not just a goal but a regulatory requirement.

Based on this, a preliminary dose can be calculated to achieve the desired reduction from the initial bioburden to the target SAL.
