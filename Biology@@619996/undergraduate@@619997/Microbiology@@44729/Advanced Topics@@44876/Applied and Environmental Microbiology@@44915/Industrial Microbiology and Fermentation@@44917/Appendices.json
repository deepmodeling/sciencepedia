The strategy involves generating mutants through Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and screening for overproducers. The wild-type (WT) strain of *B. subtilis* serves as the baseline for comparison.\n\nTo quantify enzyme production on a solid medium, a \"Productivity Index\" (PI) is defined as the ratio of the diameter of the clear halo of digested starch to the diameter of the bacterial colony itself. Through extensive characterization, the average Productivity Index for the wild-type strain is determined to be $PI_{WT} = 2.40$.\n\nFollowing UV-induced mutagenesis of a WT culture, the surviving cells are plated on starch-agar plates. After incubation, the plates are flooded with an iodine solution, which stains undigested starch dark blue, revealing clear halos around amylase-producing colonies. One mutant colony, designated M-1, appears particularly promising. Precise measurement reveals that the M-1 colony has a diameter of $d_{mut} = 3.20$ mm and is surrounded by a clear halo with a diameter of $D_{mut} = 24.8$ mm.\n\nBased on these measurements, calculate the fold improvement in the Productivity Index for the M-1 mutant strain relative to the wild-type strain.

This foam poses a risk of blocking the exhaust gas filter, leading to pressure buildup and potential contamination.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the production team decides to add a sterile, food-grade, silicone-based antifoam agent. The stock solution of this antifoam agent has a concentration of 25% (v/v).

This exercise [@problem_id:2074099] casts you as a \"microbial detective\" analyzing real-time process data, such as pH drift, to deduce the nature of a contaminant. This practice hones your ability to connect observable process parameters to the underlying metabolic activities of different microorganisms, a critical skill for any industrial microbiologist.", "problem": "A biotechnology company is running a large-scale fed-batch fermentation to produce the antibiotic erythromycin using the filamentous bacterium *Saccharopolyspora erythraea*. The process is conducted under strictly aerobic conditions in a complex sterile medium containing glucose as the primary carbon source and peptones and soy meal as the primary nitrogen sources. The culture pH is typically maintained at a constant optimum of 7.0. Midway through a production run, operators notice two simultaneous, undesirable trends: first, the rate of erythromycin synthesis has decreased dramatically, and second, the pH of the culture has begun a steady, unexpected rise, drifting towards 8.5 despite the control system's efforts. The dissolved oxygen concentration remains stable, indicating the aeration system is functioning correctly. Analysis confirms the presence of a single, fast-growing microbial contaminant.\n\nGiven these observations, which of the following is the most plausible identity of the contaminant?\n\nA. A wild yeast species that rapidly ferments glucose to ethanol.\n\nB. A strain of *Lactobacillus* that performs homolactic fermentation.\n\nC. A bacteriophage that specifically infects *Saccharopolyspora erythraea*.\n\nD. A fast-growing, non-spore-forming Gram-negative bacterium with strong proteolytic and deaminating activity.\n\nE. An acetic acid bacterium, such as *Acetobacter aceti*.", "solution": "We begin from the observations: the culture is strictly aerobic and normally maintained at pH 7.0, but midway through production the pH begins to rise steadily toward 8.5 while dissolved oxygen remains stable. Erythromycin synthesis falls dramatically, and there is a single, fast-growing microbial contaminant detected. The key diagnostic feature here is the unexpected alkaline drift under aerobic conditions.\n\nAn alkaline drift in a protein-rich medium (peptones and soy meal as primary nitrogen sources) is classically associated with microbial proteolysis followed by oxidative deamination of amino acids, which liberates ammonia. The general stoichiometry of deamination can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{R-CH(NH_{2})-COOH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{R-CO-COOH} + \\text{NH}_{3}.\n$$\nThe released ammonia undergoes base formation in water:\n$$\n\\text{NH}_{3} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{NH}_{4}^{+} + \\text{OH}^{-},\n$$\nwhich increases $[\\text{OH}^{-}]$ and thereby raises pH. Under aerobic conditions, the corresponding keto acids are further oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, while ammonia remains the principal alkaline species driving the pH upward. Thus, a contaminant with strong proteolytic and deaminating activity, thriving aerobically in a complex medium, best explains the steady rise in pH.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these constraints.\n\nOption A (wild yeast fermenting glucose to ethanol): In strictly aerobic, well-aerated conditions with stable dissolved oxygen, yeast typically prefers respiration over fermentation. Even if fermentation occurred, the principal products are ethanol and carbon dioxide:\n$$\n\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_{6} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{OH} + 2\\,\\text{CO}_{2},\n$$\nwhich do not drive alkalinization; yeast contamination more often causes neutral to mildly acidic shifts due to organic acids and does not explain a sustained rise toward pH 8.5.\n\nOption B (homolactic Lactobacillus): Homolactic fermentation produces lactic acid,\n$$\n\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_{6} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH(OH)COOH},\n$$\nwhich acidifies the medium, i.e., causes a pH drop, the opposite of the observed rise.\n\nOption C (bacteriophage of Saccharopolyspora): A phage could reduce erythromycin productivity by lysing or inhibiting the producer, but it would not present as a fast-growing microbial contaminant and does not directly cause alkalinization of the medium. The observed stable dissolved oxygen and rising pH specifically implicate metabolic activity of a living contaminant generating basic nitrogen species, which a phage cannot do.\n\nOption E (acetic acid bacterium such as Acetobacter aceti): These oxidize ethanol to acetic acid under aerobic conditions,\n$$\n\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{OH} + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COOH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},\n$$\nacidifying the medium rather than alkalinizing it. This contradicts the observed pH rise.\n\nOption D (fast-growing, non-spore-forming Gram-negative bacterium with strong proteolytic and deaminating activity): Such organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus-like deaminators) grow rapidly under aerobic conditions, secrete proteases to hydrolyze peptones and soy proteins to amino acids, and perform oxidative deamination, releasing $\\text{NH}_{3}$. The equilibria\n$$\n\\text{NH}_{3} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{NH}_{4}^{+} + \\text{OH}^{-}\n$$\ndrive the pH upwards, explaining the drift toward 8.5 despite control. Additionally, their rapid growth and nutrient scavenging readily depress secondary metabolism (erythromycin synthesis) in the producer strain through competition and alteration of medium composition. Dissolved oxygen remaining stable is consistent with robust aerobic metabolism in a well-aerated system, not with oxygen limitation or fermentative overgrowth.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the aerobic conditions, the alkaline pH drift, the medium composition, and the observed reduction in antibiotic production is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2074099"}]}
