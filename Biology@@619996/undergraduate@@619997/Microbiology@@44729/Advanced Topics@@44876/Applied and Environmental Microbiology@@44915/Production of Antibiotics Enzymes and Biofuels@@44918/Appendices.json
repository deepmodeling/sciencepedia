When a bacterial colony secretes proteases, the casein in the surrounding area is hydrolyzed, resulting in a transparent halo, or \"zone of clearing,\" around the colony.\n\nTo compare the efficiency of protease secretion among different isolates, a metric called the Proteolytic Index (PI) is calculated. The PI is defined as the ratio of the diameter of the zone of clearing to the diameter of the bacterial colony. A higher PI suggests a greater ability to produce and secrete active proteases, normalized for the colony's growth.\n\nAfter a 48-hour incubation period, a technician measures the colony and clearing zone diameters for four promising isolates. The measurements are as follows:\n\n*   **Isolate A:** Colony diameter = 4.0 mm; Zone of clearing diameter = 14.8 mm\n*   **Isolate B:** Colony diameter = 7.0 mm; Zone of clearing diameter = 21.0 mm\n*   **Isolate C:** Colony diameter = 3.0 mm; Zone of clearing diameter = 12.9 mm\n*   **Isolate D:** Colony diameter = 9.0 mm; Zone of clearing diameter = 26.1 mm\n\nBased on the Proteolytic Index, which isolate is the most potent producer of extracellular proteases and should be prioritized for further development?\n\nA.
