This exercise provides a practical application of standard laboratory techniques to quantify this phenomenon.

The student collects two soil samples. The first sample (Rhizosphere soil, R) is collected from soil adhering directly to the plant's root system. The second sample (Bulk soil, S) is collected from the same field but at a distance of 2 meters from any plant.\n\nFor each sample, a standard dilution-to-extinction plating procedure is followed to estimate the population density of aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria. Specifically, a 1.00-gram sample of soil is suspended in 99.0 mL of a sterile phosphate buffer, creating the initial suspension. From this suspension, a serial 1-in-10 dilution series is prepared. Finally, a 0.100 mL aliquot from the $10^{-5}$ dilution tube of each series is spread-plated onto a nutrient-rich agar medium.\n\nAfter incubation, the student counts the number of visible microbial colonies on each plate. The plate corresponding to the rhizosphere soil sample has 162 colonies. The plate corresponding to the bulk soil sample has 31 colonies.\n\nCalculate the rhizosphere (R) to bulk soil (S) ratio, which is the ratio of the microbial population density in the rhizosphere soil to that in the bulk soil.

A $10^{-5}$ serial dilution from this suspension yields a tube in which each milliliter corresponds to $10^{-2} \\times 10^{-5} = 10^{-7}$ grams of original soil.

By contrast, AM fungi penetrate the cell walls of cortical cells and form intracellular arbuscules and often vesicles; AM fungi (Glomeromycota) typically have aseptate, coenocytic hyphae and produce large multinucleate spores.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- Option A describes intracellular arbuscules within cortical cells, which is diagnostic for AM, not EM. Therefore, A is not conclusive for EM.\n- Option B describes a Hartig net that grows between cortical cells without entering them, which is the hallmark of EM. Therefore, B is conclusive for EM.\n- Option C describes large, multinucleate spores in the soil, characteristic of AM fungi. Therefore, C indicates AM, not EM.\n- Option D describes hyphae lacking septa; aseptate hyphae are characteristic of AM fungi. EM fungi, largely Basidiomycota or Ascomycota, typically have septate hyphae. Therefore, D indicates AM, not EM.\n- Option E describes vesicles formed within cortical cells, another AM feature (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae).

By determining the point at which a less-cooperative \"cheater\" strain ($R_C$) outcompetes an efficient nitrogen-fixing strain ($R_E$), you will gain a deeper appreciation for how ecological context shapes the evolution of cooperation [@problem_id:2093169].", "problem": "The mutualistic symbiosis between leguminous plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia is a cornerstone of many terrestrial ecosystems. However, this relationship can be destabilized by \"cheater\" rhizobial strains that absorb carbon-rich nutrients from the plant without providing a proportional amount of fixed nitrogen in return. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition, a form of pollution from industrial and agricultural activities, can alter the ecological dynamics that normally suppress these cheater strains.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the reproductive success of two rhizobial strains coinhabiting a legume host: an \"efficient\" strain ($R_E$) and a \"cheater\" strain ($R_C$). The reproductive success of an individual bacterium is modeled as a fitness value, $m$, given by the net carbon it assimilates. This net carbon is the total carbon acquired from the plant minus the metabolic carbon cost expended on nitrogen fixation.\n\nThe plant allocates carbon to its rhizobial partners via two pathways:\n1.  A non-selective basal carbon supply, $C_{basal}$, which is distributed evenly among all $N_T$ individual rhizobia in the root nodules.\n2.  A selective reward, where carbon is provided to a strain in direct proportion to the nitrogen it fixes.\n\nThe specifics of the model are as follows:\n- The efficient strain $R_E$ fixes nitrogen at a rate of $\\phi_E$ per bacterium.\n- The cheater strain $R_C$ fixes nitrogen at a lower rate of $\\phi_C$ per bacterium, where $\\phi_C < \\phi_E$.\n- The metabolic carbon cost for fixing nitrogen is directly proportional to the amount of nitrogen fixed, with a proportionality constant $\\delta$. Thus, the cost for a bacterium from strain $i$ is $\\delta \\phi_i$.\n- The plant's selective reward rate, $R$, which is the amount of carbon provided per unit of fixed nitrogen, diminishes as the availability of external nitrogen, $N_{ext}$, increases. This relationship is described by the equation $R(N_{ext}) = R_0 \\exp(-N_{ext}/\\lambda)$, where $R_0$ is the maximum reward rate in the absence of external nitrogen, and $\\lambda$ is a characteristic constant representing the sensitivity of the plant's reward strategy to external nitrogen.\n\nDetermine the critical level of external nitrogen deposition, $N_{crit}$, at which the cheater strain's reproductive fitness equals that of the efficient strain.
