This exercise delves into the quantitative aspects of thermal processing, a cornerstone of food preservation. You will apply a heat penetration model to calculate how a change in a food's physical properties, like viscosity, necessitates a change in processing time to ensure commercial sterility, demonstrating the critical link between food formulation and food safety engineering [@problem_id:2067369].", "problem": "An artisanal food company is developing a new \"extra-thick\" tomato and basil sauce.
