The process involves a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) where the four standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are supplemented with a small amount of four different fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). Each ddNTP is tagged with a unique dye that emits light at a specific wavelength upon laser excitation. The correspondence is as follows:\n\n-   ddATP is labeled with a green dye.\n-   ddTTP is labeled with a red dye.\n-   ddGTP is labeled with a yellow dye.\n-   ddCTP is labeled with a blue dye.\n\nAfter the reaction, the resulting DNA fragments are separated by size via capillary electrophoresis. A detector records the fluorescence signals as the fragments pass by, ordered from smallest to largest. The output from the automated sequencer is a text-based list of detected fluorescence peaks, ordered by elution time (earliest first). Below are the entries for the first eight detected signals.\n\n-   **Signal 1:** Time = 20.1 min, Dye = Mixed, Relative Intensity = 980, Automated Call = N\n-   **Signal 2:** Time = 22.3 min, Dye = Yellow, Relative Intensity = 875, Automated Call = G\n-   **Signal 3:** Time = 23.4 min, Dye = Blue, Relative Intensity = 850, Automated Call = C\n-   **Signal 4:** Time = 24.5 min, Dye = Red, Relative Intensity = 860, Automated Call = T\n-   **Signal 5:** Time = 24.7 min, Dye = Green, Relative Intensity = 55, Automated Call = A\n-   **Signal 6:** Time = 25.6 min, Dye = Yellow, Relative Intensity = 810, Automated Call = G\n-   **Signal 7:** Time = 26.7 min, Dye = Blue, Relative Intensity = 790, Automated Call = C\n-   **Signal 8:** Time = 27.8 min, Dye = Red, Relative Intensity = 845, Automated Call = T\n\nBased on the raw signal data and your understanding of Sanger sequencing principles and common artifacts, determine the correct sequence of the first five bases of the newly synthesized DNA strand, read in the 5' to 3' direction. Present your answer as a continuous string of five capital letters (e.g., ATGCC).", "solution": "In Sanger dideoxy sequencing, incorporation of a fluorescently labeled ddNTP terminates DNA synthesis at a specific base. The resulting fragments differ by one nucleotide in length and are separated by capillary electrophoresis; shorter fragments elute earlier. The detector records fluorescence, and the dye color identifies the terminating base. Thus, reading the ordered peaks from earliest to latest gives the newly synthesized strand sequence in the 5' to 3' direction, one base per peak.\n\nThe dye-to-base mapping provided is:\n- Green: A (ddATP)\n- Red: T (ddTTP)\n- Yellow: G (ddGTP)\n- Blue: C (ddCTP)\n\nCommon artifacts must be accounted for:\n- A “Mixed” dye peak, especially very early and called as N, typically represents a dye blob or primer-associated artifact and should be excluded from the base call.\n- A very low-intensity peak, especially one that is narrowly spaced from a neighboring strong peak, often represents noise or spectral pull-up rather than a true base incorporation. Here, typical real peaks have relative intensities around 790–875, while the suspicious peak is only 55.\n\nProcess the signals in order of elution (earliest to latest), excluding artifacts:\n- Signal 1 (Mixed, N, very early, intensity 980): mixed dye blob artifact → exclude.\n- Signal 2 (Yellow, G, 875): valid first base → G.\n- Signal 3 (Blue, C, 850): valid second base → C.\n- Signal 4 (Red, T, 860): valid third base → T.\n- Signal 5 (Green, A, 55): intensity is far below neighboring peaks and occurs only 0.2 min after the prior strong peak, consistent with noise/pull-up → exclude as artifact.\n- Signal 6 (Yellow, G, 810): valid next base → G.\n- Signal 7 (Blue, C, 790): valid next base → C.\n- Signal 8 (Red, T, 845): next valid base, not needed for the first five positions.\n\nTherefore, the first five bases of the newly synthesized DNA strand, read 5' to 3', are taken from Signals 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7:\nG, C, T, G, C.\n\nHence, the correct five-base sequence is GCTGC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{GCTGC}$$", "id": "2062747"}, {"introduction": "Modern DNA sequencers generate vast numbers of short sequence fragments, or 'reads,' which are like individual sentences from a long, shredded book.

Determine the correct and complete sequence of the assembled DNA contig.", "solution": "We seek the shortest common superstring by aligning reads using maximal suffix-prefix overlaps, since all reads are from the same strand.\n\nFirst, find clear overlaps:\n- Read A ends with GGGGCT, and read E begins with GGGGCT, so A overlaps E on the length-$6$ suffix/prefix GGGGCT. This merges to A followed by E with the overlap collapsed: A + E gives ACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCG.\n- Read E ends with AAATTGCG, and read B begins with AAATTGCG, so E overlaps B on the length-$8$ suffix/prefix AAATTGCG. Extending the previous merge, A + E + B gives ACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG.\n- Read D ends with ACGTACGT, and read A begins with ACGTACGT, so D overlaps A on the length-$8$ suffix/prefix ACGTACGT. Thus D + (A + E + B) gives GATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG.\n- Read C ends with GATTACA, and read D begins with GATTACA, so C overlaps D on the length-$7$ suffix/prefix GATTACA. Prepending C yields the full assembly: C + D + A + E + B equals GATTACAGATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG.\n\nVerification by length accounting: the total of individual lengths is $14 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 15 = 71$, and the overlaps contribute $7 + 8 + 6 + 8 = 29$, so the assembled contig length is $71 - 29 = 42$, matching the length of GATTACAGATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG. Each read appears as a contiguous substring of this contig:\n- C at the start,\n- D starting at the second GATTACA,\n- A across the ACGTACGT to GGGGCT junction,\n- E across the GGGGCT to AAATTGCG junction,\n- B at the end starting from AAATTGCG.\n\nTherefore, the correctly assembled DNA contig is GATTACAGATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{GATTACAGATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG}$$", "id": "2062768"}, {"introduction": "Assembling a complete genome often involves more than just piecing reads together; it requires interpreting the results in a biological context.
