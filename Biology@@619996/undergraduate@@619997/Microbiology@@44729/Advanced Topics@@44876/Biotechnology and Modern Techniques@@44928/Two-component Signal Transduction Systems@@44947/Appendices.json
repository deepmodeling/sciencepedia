A canonical TCST system consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator.\n\nConsider a hypothetical bacterium, *Bacillus exemplaris*, which utilizes a TCST system to manage phosphate acquisition. This system is composed of the sensor kinase `Phos` and the response regulator `PhoR`. Under conditions of low environmental phosphate, the `Phos` protein autophosphorylates and subsequently transfers the phosphate group to `PhoR`. The resulting phosphorylated `PhoR` then acts as a transcriptional activator, binding to specific DNA sequences to induce the expression of a set of genes required for high-affinity phosphate scavenging. In contrast, under high phosphate conditions, `Phos` is inactive, `PhoR` remains unphosphorylated, and the scavenging genes are not expressed.\n\nA microbiologist creates a mutant strain of *B. exemplaris* in which the gene encoding the sensor kinase, `phos`, has been completely deleted from the chromosome. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected phenotype of this `phos` deletion mutant when compared to the wild-type strain?\n\nA. The phosphate-scavenging genes will be constitutively expressed at a high level, regardless of the external phosphate concentration, leading to wasteful energy expenditure in high-phosphate environments.\n\nB. The mutant will grow normally in high-phosphate medium but will fail to induce the expression of phosphate-scavenging genes in low-phosphate medium, leading to severe growth impairment or cessation under phosphate-limiting conditions.\n\nC. The mutant will exhibit a phenotype identical to the wild-type strain, as the response regulator `PhoR` will be able to sense phosphate levels directly.\n\nD. The mutant will grow normally in low-phosphate medium but will experience toxicity and growth arrest in high-phosphate medium due to the misregulation of phosphate homeostasis.", "solution": "In a canonical two-component system, the sensor histidine kinase (denote it $S$) autophosphorylates under the appropriate input signal and transfers the phosphoryl group to the response regulator (denote it $R$). Symbolically, under low phosphate conditions the reactions are:\n$$\nS + \\mathrm{ATP} \\rightarrow S_{\\mathrm{P}} + \\mathrm{ADP}, \\quad S_{\\mathrm{P}} + R \\rightarrow S + R_{\\mathrm{P}}.\n$$\nThe phosphorylated response regulator $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ acts as a transcriptional activator for the phosphate-scavenging genes. Let $E$ denote the expression level of these genes. Then $E$ is an increasing function of $[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]$, which we can denote as $E = f([R_{\\mathrm{P}}])$ with $f'(x) > 0$.\n\nAt the level of reaction kinetics, production and loss of $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ can be summarized as:\n$$\n\\frac{d[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]}{dt} = k_{t}[S_{\\mathrm{P}}][R] - k_{d}[R_{\\mathrm{P}}],\n$$\nwhere $k_{t}$ is the phosphotransfer rate constant and $k_{d}$ is the effective dephosphorylation rate constant (including any intrinsic autodephosphorylation or phosphatase activity). At steady state,\n$$\n[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{t}}{k_{d}}[S_{\\mathrm{P}}][R].\n$$\nThus, in the wild type under low phosphate, $[S_{\\mathrm{P}}] > 0$ yields $[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} > 0$ and therefore $E$ is high; under high phosphate, the problem states that $S$ is inactive, so $[S_{\\mathrm{P}}] = 0$ and hence $[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0$, giving low $E$.\n\nIn the phos deletion mutant, the sensor kinase is absent: $[S] = 0$ implies $[S_{\\mathrm{P}}] = 0$ in all environments. Substituting into the steady-state expression gives\n$$\n[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E = f(0) \\text{ (basal/low) }\n$$\nindependent of external phosphate. Therefore, the phosphate-scavenging regulon cannot be induced in low phosphate, but the mutant behaves like wild type in high phosphate where the scavenging system is not required.\n\nConsequences for growth follow directly from the regulatory logic. In high-phosphate medium, cells do not require the high-affinity scavenging genes, so the mutant grows normally. In low-phosphate medium, failure to induce these genes prevents efficient phosphate acquisition, leading to severe growth impairment or cessation. This matches option B and contradicts the alternatives: A would require constitutive $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ without the kinase, C incorrectly assumes the response regulator senses phosphate directly, and D reverses the expected growth pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2102908"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic phosphotransfer model, this problem delves into a common regulatory refinement: the requirement for response regulator dimerization. Many response regulators must form a dimer after being phosphorylated to effectively bind DNA and regulate gene expression.

A canonical TCS consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR).\n\nConsider a model TCS system in the bacterium *Aromaticum mutagenes* that regulates the breakdown of an aromatic compound, 'X'. The system consists of the sensor kinase XylS and the response regulator XylR. The expression of the *xylE* gene, which encodes a critical catabolic enzyme, is controlled by this system.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  In the presence of compound X, XylS autophosphorylates.\n2.  XylS then transfers the phosphoryl group to the response regulator XylR, forming XylR-P.\n3.  For XylR-P to function, it must first form a homodimer, (XylR-P)₂.\n4.  This (XylR-P)₂ dimer is the sole species capable of binding to a specific operator sequence in the promoter of the *xylE* gene.\n5.  Binding of the (XylR-P)₂ dimer to the operator acts as a transcriptional activator, leading to a high level of *xylE* transcription. In the absence of the (XylR-P)₂ dimer, the *xylE* gene is transcribed at a constant, low basal level, regardless of the presence or absence of compound X.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant strain of *A. mutagenes* with a single amino acid substitution in the *xylR* gene. The resulting mutant protein, XylR*, has the following properties: it can still be phosphorylated by XylS to form XylR*-P, but the substitution lies within the dimerization interface. Consequently, XylR* is completely unable to form a dimer, irrespective of its phosphorylation state. Monomeric XylR-P and XylR*-P have zero affinity for the *xylE* operator sequence.\n\nA culture of this mutant strain is shifted from a medium lacking compound X to a medium containing a high concentration of compound X. Which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the transcriptional response of the *xylE* gene in this mutant strain immediately following the shift?\n\nA. The transcription of *xylE* will be constitutively high, even in the absence of compound X.\n\nB. The transcription of *xylE* will be strongly induced to the same high level as observed in wild-type cells.\n\nC. The transcription of *xylE* will remain at the low basal level.\n\nD.

Consequences in the mutant upon shifting to medium with high $X$:\n- Although $XylS$ will phosphorylate $XylR^{*}$ to $XylR^{*}\\text{-}P$, no dimer can form, so the concentration of the required DNA-binding dimer is\n$$\n[D] \\;=\\; \\big[(XylR^{*}\\text{-}P)_{2}\\big] \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\n- Therefore, promoter occupancy by the activator is\n$$\n\\theta \\;=\\; \\frac{0}{K_{d} + 0} \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nand the transcriptional output remains\n$$\nT \\;=\\; T_{\\text{basal}}.\n$$\n\n6.

A typical TCS consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR). Upon sensing a specific environmental stimulus, the SK undergoes autophosphorylation on a conserved histidine residue, using the gamma-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This phosphoryl group is then transferred to a conserved aspartate residue on the receiver domain of its cognate RR.\n\nAn experiment is designed to characterize a novel TCS pair, SK_x and RR_x, *in vitro*. Purified SK_x and RR_x are incubated together in a reaction buffer. To monitor the phosphorylation events, radiolabeled ATP in the form of $[\\gamma-^{32}P]ATP$ is added to initiate the reaction. The mixture is sampled at various time points, and the proteins are separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel is then analyzed by autoradiography to detect the presence of the radioactive $^{32}P$ isotope.\n\nThe results are unambiguous: A strong radioactive band appears at the molecular weight corresponding to SK_x, indicating successful autophosphorylation (SK_x~P formation). However, even after extended incubation, no radioactive signal is ever detected at the molecular weight corresponding to RR_x.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following provides the most specific and likely molecular explanation for the failure to produce phosphorylated RR_x (RR_x~P)?\n\nA. The SK_x protein used in the assay is a truncated version lacking its N-terminal signal-sensing domain.\n\nB.

Truncation of the N-terminal sensing domain. The sensing domain controls input specificity and regulation but does not form the catalytic core. In vitro, kinase fragments lacking the N-terminal sensor frequently retain autokinase and phosphotransfer activity. Since SK autophosphorylation is robust, loss of the sensor domain is not a specific explanation for the lack of RR labeling.\n- B. Mutation in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of RR. This output-domain defect does not disrupt the N-terminal receiver domain that accepts the phosphoryl group. Such a mutant RR typically still becomes phosphorylated. This does not explain the absence of RR$\\sim$P signal.\n- C. Use of $[\\alpha\\text{-}^{32}\\text{P}]\\text{ATP}$ instead of $[\\gamma\\text{-}^{32}\\text{P}]\\text{ATP}$. If $[\\alpha\\text{-}^{32}\\text{P}]\\text{ATP}$ were used, SK autophosphorylation on histidine would not incorporate the radiolabel (the $\\alpha$-phosphate is not transferred), so SK would not appear radioactive. The data show a strong SK band, which rules out this explanation.\n- D. Mutation of the conserved receiver aspartate to a nonphosphorylatable residue (e.g., Asp to Ala). This specifically abolishes the formation of the aspartyl phosphate intermediate:\n$$\\text{SK}\\sim\\text{P} + \\text{RR}(\\text{Ala}) \\not\\rightarrow \\text{RR}\\sim\\text{P},$$\nwhile leaving SK autophosphorylation intact.
