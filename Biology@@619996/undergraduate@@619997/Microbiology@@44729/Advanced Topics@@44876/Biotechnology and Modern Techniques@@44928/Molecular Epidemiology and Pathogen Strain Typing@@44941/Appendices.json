Four environmental and clinical isolates of *Bacillus anthracis* have been collected for molecular typing to determine if they originate from a common source. The team uses a method called Multi-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA), which differentiates bacterial strains by counting the number of times a short DNA sequence is repeated at several specific locations (loci) in the genome. Two isolates are considered genetically identical by this method if they have the exact same number of tandem repeats at all of the loci analyzed.\n\nThe analysis was performed on three highly variable loci: Locus 1, Locus 2, and Locus 3.

According to the problem statement, two samples are considered identical if they have the same number of repeats at all three loci tested. We can represent the MLVA profile of each sample as an ordered triplet of numbers (Locus 1 repeats, Locus 2 repeats, Locus 3 repeats).\n\nFirst, let's write down the MLVA profile for each sample based on the provided data.\n\nFor Sample A, the number of repeats are 8 at Locus 1, 15 at Locus 2, and 9 at Locus 3.\nThe MLVA profile for Sample A is (8, 15, 9).\n\nFor Sample B, the number of repeats are 8 at Locus 1, 16 at Locus 2, and 9 at Locus 3.\nThe MLVA profile for Sample B is (8, 16, 9).\n\nFor Sample C, the number of repeats are 7 at Locus 1, 15 at Locus 2, and 9 at Locus 3.\nThe MLVA profile for Sample C is (7, 15, 9).\n\nFor Sample D, the number of repeats are 8 at Locus 1, 15 at Locus 2, and 9 at Locus 3.\nThe MLVA profile for Sample D is (8, 15, 9).\n\nNext, we compare these profiles to find an exact match.\n-   Compare Sample A (8, 15, 9) with Sample B (8, 16, 9). They differ at Locus 2 (15 vs. 16). They are not identical.\n-   Compare Sample A (8, 15, 9) with Sample C (7, 15, 9). They differ at Locus 1 (8 vs. 7). They are not identical.\n-   Compare Sample A (8, 15, 9) with Sample D (8, 15, 9). The number of repeats matches for all three loci: 8 for Locus 1, 15 for Locus 2, and 9 for Locus 3. Therefore, Samples A and D are identical.\n\nLet's complete the comparisons for clarity.\n-   Compare Sample B (8, 16, 9) with Sample C (7, 15, 9).

This exercise introduces core genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST), which accounts for this microevolution by measuring genetic distance as the number of differing alleles.

They have collected isolates of *Listeria monocytogenes* from two patients (P1, P2), a suspected food product (F1), and an environmental swab from the food processing plant (E1). Additionally, they are using a well-characterized reference strain (REF) from a previous, unrelated outbreak for comparison.\n\nTo determine if these isolates are from the same source, the laboratory performs core genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST). This technique compares the DNA sequences of 1701 core genes shared among all *L. monocytogenes* isolates. The genetic relatedness is measured by the number of alleles (gene variants) that differ between any two isolates. The established epidemiological cutoff for *L. monocytogenes* is that isolates differing by 7 or fewer alleles are considered to be highly related and likely belong to the same outbreak cluster.\n\nThe pairwise allelic differences from the cgMLST analysis are as follows:\n- P1 and P2 differ by 2 alleles.\n- P1 and F1 differ by 4 alleles.\n- P1 and E1 differ by 5 alleles.\n- P2 and F1 differ by 6 alleles.\n- P2 and E1 differ by 7 alleles.\n- F1 and E1 differ by 1 allele.\n- P1 and REF differ by 58 alleles.\n- F1 and REF differ by 61 alleles.\n\nBased on this data and the established cutoff, which of the following groups of isolates constitutes the single, complete outbreak cluster?\n\nA.

This final practice challenges you to interpret the structure of such a tree, a fundamental skill in genomic epidemiology.

To determine if the cases are linked, stool samples are collected from six symptomatic patients (Patients 1 through 6). The *C. difficile* bacteria isolated from each patient undergo whole-genome sequencing. A phylogenetic tree is then constructed based on the core genome differences to visualize the genetic relatedness of the bacterial strains.\n\nThe analysis reveals the following: The strains isolated from Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all grouped together in a tight cluster on the phylogenetic tree. The branches connecting these five isolates to each other and to their most recent common ancestor are extremely short. In contrast, the strain isolated from Patient 6 is located on a very long branch that connects to the rest of the tree much deeper in the past, making it a clear outlier from the main cluster.\n\nBased on this molecular epidemiology data, what is the most likely conclusion regarding the infection in Patient 6?\n\nA.

The infection in Patient 6 represents a sporadic case that is epidemiologically unrelated to the outbreak affecting the other five patients.\n\nE. The strain from Patient 6 recently acquired a large number of antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer, causing it to appear genetically distant.", "solution": "Principle: In a core-genome phylogeny, genetic relatedness is reflected by branch lengths and topology. Short terminal branches and a recent, shallow most recent common ancestor (MRCA) indicate recent transmission or a tight outbreak cluster. A long branch connecting deep in the tree indicates many core single-nucleotide differences and a lineage that diverged further in the past, implying epidemiologic unrelatedness to a recent cluster.\n\nObservations: Patients 1–5 form a tight cluster with extremely short branches among themselves and to their MRCA, consistent with a recent, linked transmission cluster within the ward. Patient 6 lies on a very long branch that connects to the rest of the tree much deeper in the past, marking it as a clear outlier from that cluster.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A (index case): The index case for this cluster would be near the MRCA of the clustered isolates with a short path to them, not on a long, deep branch. The described topology argues against Patient 6 being the source of the ward cluster.\n- B (hypermutator): A hypermutator acquired from the same source would typically appear as an unusually long terminal branch but still nest within the cluster’s recent MRCA. The description specifies that Patient 6 connects to the tree much deeper in the past, indicating older divergence, not simply accelerated mutation after a recent common source.\n- C (super-spreader): Increased transmissibility is an epidemiologic property that does not explain deep phylogenetic divergence; it would not produce a long, deep branch distinct from a recent cluster.\n- D (sporadic, unrelated): A long branch connecting deep in the tree signifies substantial core-genome divergence and a distant MRCA relative to the outbreak cluster, consistent with an unrelated, sporadic case.\n- E (recent HGT of resistance genes): The tree is based on core genome differences. Horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants predominantly affects accessory genome content and would not create the observed deep divergence in a core-genome phylogeny.\n\nConclusion: The phylogenetic pattern most strongly supports that Patient 6’s infection is unrelated to the ward outbreak affecting Patients 1–5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2081204"}]}
