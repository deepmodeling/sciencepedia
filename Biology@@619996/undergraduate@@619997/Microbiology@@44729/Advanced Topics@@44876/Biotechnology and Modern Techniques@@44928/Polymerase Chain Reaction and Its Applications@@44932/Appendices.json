The goal is to amplify the entire coding sequence of the `xtrA` gene using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique.\n\nBased on the sequenced genome, the forward primer is designed to bind to the template DNA strand such that its 5' end aligns with base pair position 345,112. This primer is 21 nucleotides long. The reverse primer is designed to bind to the complementary strand, and its 5' end corresponds to base pair position 346,934 on the original template strand.

If the forward primer 5' end aligns at coordinate $x$ and the reverse primer 5' end corresponds to coordinate $y$ on the original template strand, then the amplified product spans from $x$ through $y$ inclusive. The length in base pairs is therefore the inclusive interval length:\n$$L = y - x + 1.$$\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Forward primer 5' end at position $x = 345112$.\n- Reverse primer 5' end corresponds to position $y = 346934$.\n\nThus,\n$$L = 346934 - 345112 + 1 = 1823$$.\n\nNote that the individual primer lengths (21 nt and 23 nt) do not alter this calculation because the 5' end coordinates already mark the outer boundaries of the amplicon; the amplicon includes the full primer sequences at both ends, and its size is fully determined by the distance between these 5' ends on the reference coordinate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1823}$$", "id": "2086795"}, {"introduction": "PCR is not just a tool for making copies of DNA; its exponential nature allows for the precise measurement of the starting amount of a target sequence, a technique known as quantitative PCR (qPCR).

A related, non-pathogenic laboratory strain of the same species contains a homologous but non-functional pseudogene, `vrtA-psi`.

Principle: DNA polymerase requires a correctly base-paired 3' terminal nucleotide to extend; a 3' mismatch strongly suppresses amplification.\n\n1) Identify the SNP position in the sense strand.\n- From the given sequences, the two sense strands are identical except for the bolded base:\n  - `vrtA`: ...GCGT A GTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCA...\n  - `vrtA-psi`: ...GCGT C GTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCA...\n- Thus, at the SNP position, the sense base is A in `vrtA` and C in `vrtA-psi`. The 20 bases immediately downstream of the SNP in `vrtA` are:\n  - Sense segment starting at the SNP in `vrtA`: AGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT\n\n2) Forward primer analysis.\n- All options A–E use the same forward primer 5'-AATGCATTACGATCGATTCG-3'. This sequence occurs identically in both `vrtA` and `vrtA-psi`, so it does not confer specificity. Specificity must therefore come from the reverse primer.\n\n3) Reverse primer design logic for specificity.\n- A reverse primer anneals to the antisense strand; its reverse complement (RC) must match the sense strand.\n- To discriminate at the SNP, the reverse primer’s 3' base must be complementary to the sense base at the SNP:\n  - For `vrtA` (sense base A), the reverse primer’s 3' base must be T.\n  - For `vrtA-psi` (sense base C), the reverse primer’s 3' base must be G.\n- Moreover, to place the SNP at the reverse primer’s 3' end, the RC of the reverse primer must equal the 20-base sense segment that begins at the SNP (for the listed 20-mer primers).\n\n4) Evaluate each reverse primer by computing its reverse complement and comparing to the `vrtA` sense segment AGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n\n- Option C reverse: 5'-ACTAGCATGCTCGATCGACT-3'\n  - RC computation: reverse the sequence and complement, yielding RC = AGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n  - This RC exactly matches the `vrtA` sense segment starting at the SNP.\n  - The reverse primer’s 3' base is T, complementary to A at the SNP in `vrtA`, ensuring perfect 3' pairing in `vrtA` and a 3' mismatch in `vrtA-psi` (which has C).\n\n- Option D reverse: 5'-ACTAGCATGCTCGATCGACG-3'\n  - Only differs from C at the 3' base, which is G.\n  - RC starts with C, i.e., RC = CGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n  - That RC matches the `vrtA-psi` sense segment starting at the SNP (C...), not `vrtA`. Hence D would preferentially amplify the pseudogene.\n\n- Option B reverse: 5'-ACTAGCATGCTCGATCGACA-3'\n  - 3' base is A; RC starts with T, i.e., RC = TGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n  - This does not match either sense sequence at the SNP (which are A or C), causing a 3' mismatch in both and thus poor amplification of either.\n\n- Option E reverse: 5'-GCTACGATCGTCGATGCGTA-3'\n  - Its RC is TACGCATCGACGATCGTAGC, which does not align as the sense segment starting at the SNP. Moreover, its 3' base is A (not T), so it does not provide the correct 3' complement to the `vrtA` SNP base.\n\n- Option A reverse: 5'-TGCTAGCTACGACTAGCATG-3'\n  - Its RC is CATGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCA, which aligns downstream and does not place the SNP at the 3' end; thus it cannot exploit the SNP for specificity.\n\n5) Conclusion.\n- Only option C positions the SNP at the reverse primer’s 3' end with a perfect match to `vrtA` (3' T pairing with sense A) and a terminal mismatch to `vrtA-psi` (3' T vs sense C), thereby selectively amplifying `vrtA` and failing to amplify `vrtA-psi`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2086832"}]}
