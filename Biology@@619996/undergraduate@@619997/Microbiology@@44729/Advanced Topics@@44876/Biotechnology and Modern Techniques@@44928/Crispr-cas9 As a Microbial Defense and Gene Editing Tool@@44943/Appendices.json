This exercise explores the core principle of this targeting mechanism, focusing on how a single component can be easily redesigned to redirect the entire molecular machinery [@problem_id:2060713]. Understanding this concept is the first step toward designing your own gene editing experiments.", "problem": "The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is a powerful gene-editing tool derived from a bacterial adaptive immune system. The system operates using two primary components: the Cas9 protein, which acts as a molecular \"scissors\" (an endonuclease) to cut double-stranded DNA, and a guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA is a synthetic RNA molecule composed of two key regions: a \"scaffold\" region that binds to the Cas9 protein to form a functional complex, and a \"spacer\" region of approximately 20 nucleotides that is complementary to a specific DNA sequence, thereby directing the Cas9 protein to that target site. For the Cas9 protein from *Streptococcus pyogenes* to cut the DNA, the target DNA sequence must be immediately followed by a specific short sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nA microbiologist has successfully designed a CRISPR-Cas9 system to disrupt Gene A in a culture of *Escherichia coli*. The system is working effectively. The researcher now wishes to use the same fundamental approach to disrupt a different gene, Gene B, which has a completely unrelated DNA sequence. Which of the following components must the researcher redesign to redirect the CRISPR-Cas9 system to target Gene B?\n\nA. The entire Cas9 protein to recognize Gene B.\n\nB. The spacer region of the guide RNA.\n\nC. The scaffold region of the guide RNA.\n\nD. The Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence.\n\nE. The promoter that controls the expression of the Cas9 protein.", "solution": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes achieves target specificity through Watson-Crick base pairing between the spacer region of the guide RNA and the complementary protospacer sequence in the DNA. The Cas9 protein binds the guide RNA via the scaffold region, forming the active ribonucleoprotein complex, and it recognizes a short PAM sequence in the DNA (for SpCas9, typically NGG) through protein-DNA interaction. DNA cleavage occurs only when both conditions are met: the presence of a correct PAM adjacent to the protospacer and successful base pairing between the spacer and the DNA target.\n\nTo retarget the system from Gene A to Gene B while keeping the same Cas9 protein, the researcher must change the sequence that determines base-pairing specificity. This is exclusively encoded by the spacer region of the guide RNA. The scaffold region should remain unchanged because it is responsible for binding Cas9, not for target recognition. The PAM sequence is a property of the genomic DNA at the target site and is recognized by Cas9; it is not redesigned in the guide RNA and cannot be altered in the genome without additional editing. The Cas9 protein itself determines the PAM requirement and cleavage activity; it does not need redesign for a new target as long as a suitable PAM exists near the new site. The promoter controlling Cas9 expression affects expression level, not target specificity.\n\nTherefore, to redirect targeting to Gene B, the researcher must redesign the spacer region of the guide RNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2060713"}, {"introduction": "While the guide RNA provides exquisite specificity, mismatches between the gRNA and an off-target DNA sequence can sometimes be tolerated, leading to unintended edits.

The model links the probability of DNA cleavage to the thermodynamic stability of the complex formed between the Guide RNA (gRNA) and the target DNA strand.\n\nThe system consists of a gRNA with a 20-nucleotide spacer sequence. The binding region on the target DNA is divided into two parts:\n1.  The **seed region**: The 10 nucleotides on the target DNA immediately adjacent to the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). This region is critical for binding initiation and stabilization.\n2.  The **distal region**: The remaining 10 nucleotides of the target sequence, further away from the PAM.\n\nThe model assumes the total binding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of contributions from all 20 potential base pairings. The energy contributions are as follows:\n-   A perfect match between the gRNA and DNA contributes $\\Delta G_{\\text{match}} = -7.2 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n-   A mismatch in the seed region incurs a destabilization penalty, effectively contributing $\\Delta G_{\\text{mismatch, seed}} = +16.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n-   A mismatch in the distal region incurs a smaller penalty, contributing $\\Delta G_{\\text{mismatch, distal}} = +4.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nThe probability of successful cleavage, $P_{\\text{cleave}}$, is related to the binding energy by the following logistic function, which models the transition to a catalytically active state:\n$$ P_{\\text{cleave}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{threshold}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{threshold}} = -115.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ is the threshold free energy for efficient cleavage, the ideal gas constant is $R = 8.314 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}^{-1}$, and the temperature is $T = 298 \\text{ K}$.\n\nConsider two different potential off-target DNA sequences:\n-   **Target A**: Has 2 mismatches in the seed region and 0 mismatches in the distal region.\n-   **Target B**: Has 0 mismatches in the seed region and 4 mismatches in the distal region.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the cleavage efficiency for Target A to that for Target B, which is $\\frac{P_{\\text{cleave, A}}}{P_{\\text{cleave, B}}}$.
