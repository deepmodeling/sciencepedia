In many cases, we must use a 'screen' to visually distinguish mutants from the wild type. This problem [@problem_id:2072731] explores a classic screening method using an indicator plate to find bacteria that have lost the ability to produce an extracellular enzyme. By observing the reaction between iodine and starch, you'll learn to deduce the underlying genotype from a visible phenotype.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the function of the enzyme alpha-amylase in the bacterium *Bacillus subtilis*. Alpha-amylase is an extracellular enzyme that hydrolyzes starch into smaller sugar molecules. To find strains that have lost the ability to produce this enzyme, the researcher first exposes a culture of wild-type *B. subtilis* to a mutagenic agent. Subsequently, the treated bacterial population is spread onto a solid agar plate where the growth medium contains starch as well as other essential nutrients.\n\nAfter incubation for 24 hours, distinct bacterial colonies are visible. The researcher then floods the surface of the plate with an iodine solution. Two different visual outcomes, referred to as Phenotype 1 and Phenotype 2, are observed among the colonies:\n\n- **Phenotype 1:** Colonies that are each surrounded by a distinct, clear, colorless halo against a dark purplish-blue background agar.\n- **Phenotype 2:** Colonies where the dark purplish-blue color of the agar extends directly to the edge of the colony, with no clear halo present.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to isolate the amylase-deficient mutants. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the mutant phenotype and the underlying principle of this screening method?\n\nA. Phenotype 1 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. The clear halo is a zone where the cells have lysed due to their inability to metabolize the starch, releasing cellular contents that repel the iodine.\n\nB. Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. These mutants secrete a modified protein that binds iodine more strongly than starch, creating a dark appearance immediately adjacent to the colony.\n\nC. Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. Iodine stains the starch in the agar a dark color; the absence of a clear halo indicates that the starch surrounding the colony was not hydrolyzed because the cells failed to secrete active amylase.\n\nD. Phenotype 1 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. The wild-type cells consume the starch so efficiently that it is depleted locally, preventing the dark staining reaction with iodine that is seen around the mutant colonies.\n\nE. Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. This procedure is a positive selection, as the iodine solution is toxic to the wild-type cells, leaving only the living mutant colonies for isolation.", "solution": "Alpha-amylase is an extracellular enzyme that hydrolyzes starch into smaller sugars. Iodine forms a dark purplish-blue complex with intact starch but does not stain areas where starch has been hydrolyzed.\n\nWhen colonies secrete active alpha-amylase, they digest the starch in the agar surrounding the colony during incubation. Upon flooding with iodine, the region lacking intact starch does not form the dark complex and appears as a clear, colorless halo around the colony. Therefore, a clear halo indicates amylase activity (wild type).\n\nConversely, if a colony fails to secrete active alpha-amylase (amylase-deficient mutant), the starch in the agar remains intact up to the colony edge. After iodine is added, the agar stains dark right up to the colony margin with no clear halo. Therefore, absence of a clear halo indicates loss of amylase activity.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: the clear halo reflects starch hydrolysis, not cell lysis or iodine repulsion.\n- B is incorrect: iodine complexes with intact starch, not with a modified secreted protein.\n- C is correct: Phenotype 2 (no halo) indicates retained starch due to lack of amylase secretion; thus these are the mutants, and the principle is iodine staining of intact starch.\n- D is incorrect: it misidentifies the mutant; wild-type produces the clear halo.\n- E is incorrect: this is a screen, not a positive selection; iodine is an indicator, not a toxic agent in this context.\n\nTherefore, Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants, based on iodine staining of intact starch, and the method is a screening assay for loss of extracellular enzyme activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2072731"}, {"introduction": "What if the mutants we seek are defined by what they *cannot* do, such as failing to grow in the presence of an antibiotic they were once resistant to? This requires a technique called negative selection, masterfully accomplished by replica plating. This practice [@problem_id:2072680] demonstrates how to use this ingenious method to screen thousands of colonies simultaneously, making it possible to find rare 'loss-of-function' mutants by identifying the colonies that are absent on a selective replica plate.", "problem": "A microbiologist is working with a strain of *Escherichia coli* that possesses a plasmid conferring resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline. To study the stability of this plasmid, the researcher exposes a large population of these bacteria to a chemical mutagen, hoping to induce mutations that cause a loss of tetracycline resistance. After the mutagenesis procedure, the bacterial culture is diluted and spread onto a master plate containing a complete nutrient agar without any antibiotics. Numerous individual colonies grow on this master plate, each arising from a single bacterium. The researcher's goal is to efficiently identify which of these colonies are composed of bacteria that have become sensitive to tetracycline. Given the master plate with a dense pattern of colonies, which of the following procedures is the most appropriate and direct next step to achieve this goal?\n\nA. Flood the master plate with a solution of tetracycline and identify the colonies that lyse.\n\nB. Use a sterile velvet pad to transfer the colony pattern to a new plate containing complete nutrient agar supplemented with tetracycline.\n\nC. Use a sterile inoculating loop to individually pick each colony from the master plate and streak it onto a new plate containing tetracycline.\n\nD. Use a sterile velvet pad to transfer the colony pattern to a new plate containing a minimal medium that lacks essential amino acids.\n\nE. Re-incubate the master plate at a higher temperature to select for tetracycline-sensitive mutants.", "solution": "The goal of the experiment is to identify mutants that have lost a specific function, in this case, resistance to tetracycline. This type of screening requires negative selection, a method used to find mutants that cannot grow under a particular selective condition. The colonies on the master plate represent the entire mutagenized population, including the rare, desired tetracycline-sensitive mutants. The key is to test these colonies for sensitivity without killing the original stock on the master plate.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nOption A is incorrect. Flooding the master plate with tetracycline is a form of positive selection *against* the desired mutants. This action would kill the tetracycline-sensitive bacteria on the master plate, making it impossible to isolate and culture them later. The master plate must be preserved as the source of live cells.\n\nOption B describes the core principle of replica plating for negative selection. A sterile velvet pad is gently pressed onto the master plate, picking up cells from each colony. This pad is then pressed onto a new, \"replica\" plate. The colony pattern is thus transferred. By making the replica plate with agar containing tetracycline, we apply the selective pressure. The original tetracycline-resistant bacteria will grow on this replica plate, but the desired tetracycline-sensitive mutants will fail to grow. By comparing the replica plate to the master plate, the researcher can identify the \"missing\" colonies on the replica plate. The corresponding colonies on the master plate, which are still alive, are the desired sensitive mutants and can then be picked for further study. This is the correct, high-throughput method for this purpose.\n\nOption C is technically functional but highly impractical and inefficient. Individually picking hundreds or thousands of colonies is extremely laborious and time-consuming. Replica plating was developed specifically to overcome this limitation by allowing the simultaneous screening of many colonies. Therefore, this is not the *most appropriate* method.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it describes a method for identifying auxotrophic mutants. A minimal medium lacks specific nutrients (like amino acids or vitamins). A replica plate with minimal medium would be used to find mutants that have lost the ability to synthesize those nutrients. This is not relevant to identifying antibiotic sensitivity.\n\nOption E is incorrect. While temperature can be a selective pressure for certain types of mutations (e.g., temperature-sensitive mutations), there is no information in the problem statement to suggest that tetracycline sensitivity is linked to temperature tolerance. This is not a standard or direct method for selecting for antibiotic sensitivity.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and direct method is to use replica plating to transfer the colonies to a selective medium containing tetracycline, which facilitates a negative selection screen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2072680"}]}
