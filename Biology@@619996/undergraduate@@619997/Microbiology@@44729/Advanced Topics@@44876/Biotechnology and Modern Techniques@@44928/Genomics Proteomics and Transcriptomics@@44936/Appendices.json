You will apply the principle of GC skew, a subtle but powerful asymmetry in nucleotide distribution, to transform sequence data into a functional map of the genome.", "problem": "A bioinformatician is studying the genome of a newly discovered bacterium, *Bacillus computatis*. The bacterium has a single, circular chromosome with a total length of 4,000,000 base pairs (bp). To predict the locations of the origin and terminus of replication, a Guanine-Cytosine (GC) skew analysis is performed. The cumulative GC skew is calculated by starting at base pair 1 and sequentially summing the value of $(G - C) / (G + C)$ for each subsequent base pair around the entire chromosome.\n\nThe cumulative skew values (in arbitrary units) were recorded at the end of 20 consecutive segments, each 200,000 bp in length. The data are provided below:\n\n- Segment 1 (Ends at 200,000 bp): -4100\n- Segment 2 (Ends at 400,000 bp): -3500\n- Segment 3 (Ends at 600,000 bp): -2800\n- Segment 4 (Ends at 800,000 bp): -2000\n- Segment 5 (Ends at 1,000,000 bp): -1100\n- Segment 6 (Ends at 1,200,000 bp): +200\n- Segment 7 (Ends at 1,400,000 bp): +1800\n- Segment 8 (Ends at 1,600,000 bp): +4000\n- Segment 9 (Ends at 1,800,000 bp): +3500\n- Segment 10 (Ends at 2,000,000 bp): +2800\n- Segment 11 (Ends at 2,200,000 bp): +1900\n- Segment 12 (Ends at 2,400,000 bp): +1000\n- Segment 13 (Ends at 2,600,000 bp): 0\n- Segment 14 (Ends at 2,800,000 bp): -1200\n- Segment 15 (Ends at 3,000,000 bp): -2500\n- Segment 16 (Ends at 3,200,000 bp): -3700\n- Segment 17 (Ends at 3,400,000 bp): -4600\n- Segment 18 (Ends at 3,600,000 bp): -5000\n- Segment 19 (Ends at 3,800,000 bp): -4800\n- Segment 20 (Ends at 4,000,000 bp): -4500\n\nBased on this data, identify the most likely base pair positions for the origin of replication and the terminus of replication.

Denote $x_{k}=kL$ and $S_{k}=S(x_{k})$ for $k=1,\\dots,20$.\n\nThe biological principle used for locating replication landmarks from cumulative GC skew is:\n- Along the leading strand, GC skew is typically positive, so $S(n)$ increases with $n$.\n- Along the lagging strand, GC skew is typically negative, so $S(n)$ decreases with $n$.\n- Consequently, the cumulative GC skew exhibits a minimum at the origin of replication (where the slope switches from decreasing to increasing) and a maximum at the terminus of replication (where the slope switches from increasing to decreasing).\n\nTo identify these extrema from the discrete samples $\\{S_{k}\\}$, compute successive differences $\\Delta S_{k}=S_{k}-S_{k-1}$ (with the understanding that a change in sign of $\\Delta S_{k}$ across an index indicates a local extremum at $x_{k-1}$ or $x_{k}$).
