This first practice exercise guides you through the interpretation of a classic positive result. By comparing the number of revertant colonies on the test plate to the control, you will apply the core principle of the Ames test to determine if a substance is mutagenic, while also considering the role of metabolic activation provided by the S9 extract [@problem_id:2096119].", "problem": "A biotechnology company is evaluating the potential mutagenicity of a new industrial solvent, designated \"Solvent Z,\" using the Ames test.

Thus:\n- Only revertants ($his^{+}$) form visible colonies on minimal medium without histidine.\n- The control plate measures spontaneous reversion, giving a baseline colony number.\n- The test plate includes the compound under evaluation and often an S9 mix to allow metabolic activation; an increase in revertant colonies indicates mutagenicity of the compound or its metabolites.\n\nDefine the observed colony counts:\n$$N_{c} = 28 \\quad \\text{(control, spontaneous revertants)}$$\n$$N_{t} = 217 \\quad \\text{(test with Solvent Z + S9)}$$\nMutagenicity is inferred when $N_{t} \\gg N_{c}$ by a substantial margin.

Sometimes, a chemical may have multiple effects on bacteria. This exercise presents a common scenario where a chemical is toxic, creating a \"zone of inhibition\" where no bacteria can grow. Learning to distinguish between toxicity (an antimicrobial effect) and mutagenicity (a genetic effect) is a critical skill for accurately interpreting the results of an Ames test and avoiding false conclusions [@problem_id:2096083].", "problem": "A microbiology student is conducting an Ames test to evaluate the mutagenic potential of a newly synthesized chemical, \"Compound Z\". The student uses a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is an auxotroph for the amino acid histidine ($his^{-}$), meaning it cannot produce its own histidine and requires an external source to grow.\n\nThe experimental procedure involves the following steps:\n1. A culture of the $his^{-}$ *Salmonella typhimurium* is mixed with a small amount of rat liver extract. This extract contains metabolic enzymes that can convert some non-mutagenic compounds into active mutagens, mimicking metabolic processes in mammals.\n2. The mixture is then spread evenly onto the surface of a minimal glucose-salts agar plate. The agar medium is designed to be deficient in histidine, but it contains a trace amount, just enough to support a few rounds of cell division.\n3. A sterile paper disk saturated with a concentrated solution of Compound Z is placed in the center of the agar plate.\n4. The plate is incubated for 48 hours at 37°C.\n\nAfter incubation, the student observes a distinct, bacteria-free \"zone of inhibition\" immediately surrounding the disk where Compound Z was applied. Beyond this clear zone, a sparse background lawn of bacterial growth is visible across the rest of the plate.\n\nBased on this specific observation of a clear zone of inhibition, what is the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn about Compound Z at the concentration tested?\n\nA. Compound Z is a potent mutagen.\n\nB. Compound Z is toxic or antimicrobial to the *Salmonella* strain.\n\nC. The $his^{-}$ strain of *Salmonella* spontaneously reverted to a $his^{+}$ phenotype in the presence of the compound.\n\nD. The rat liver extract successfully metabolized Compound Z into a non-toxic, non-mutagenic substance.\n\nE. The trace amount of histidine in the medium was insufficient to support any bacterial growth near the disk.", "solution": "Goal: Determine what the observation of a clear zone of inhibition around the disk implies about Compound Z at the concentration tested in an Ames test setup.\n\nPrinciple of the Ames test:\n- The test uses a $his^{-}$ auxotrophic strain that cannot grow on minimal medium once the trace histidine is exhausted. The plate contains a trace amount of histidine sufficient for a few cell divisions to allow potential mutations to occur.\n- A mutagen increases the frequency of reversion to $his^{+}$, enabling revertant colonies to grow after the trace histidine is depleted. The diagnostic readout for mutagenicity is an increased number of $his^{+}$ revertant colonies, often concentrated in regions where the mutagen concentration is high enough to induce mutations but not high enough to be lethal.\n\nDisk diffusion and concentration gradient:\n- When a chemical is placed on a disk, it diffuses radially into the agar, creating a concentration profile $c(r)$ that decreases with distance $r$ from the disk.\n- If the chemical is toxic (antimicrobial) to the test strain, there exists a radius $r_{0}$ such that for $0 \\leq r  r_{0}$, $c(r) > \\text{MIC}$ (minimum inhibitory concentration), causing no growth; for $r > r_{0}$, $c(r)  \\text{MIC}$, allowing growth. This produces a clear “zone of inhibition” around the disk.\n\nInterpretation of the observed pattern:\n- The observation is a distinct, bacteria-free zone immediately around the disk and a sparse background lawn beyond it. This is the classic signature of toxicity/antimicrobial activity at or above the MIC near the disk: $c(r) > \\text{MIC}$ yields inhibition close to the disk, and $c(r)  \\text{MIC}$ yields growth farther away.\n- In contrast, evidence of mutagenicity would be an elevated number of $his^{+}$ revertant colonies, not a cleared zone. Often, mutagens produce a ring of revertant colonies at distances where $c(r)$ is mutagenic but not lethal. A clear zone indicates that in the high-concentration region, cells cannot survive to yield any colonies, including revertants.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A. Compound Z is a potent mutagen. This is not supported by a clear zone; mutagenicity would present as increased revertant colonies, not growth inhibition.\n- B. Compound Z is toxic or antimicrobial to the Salmonella strain. This directly matches the zone of inhibition and the disk diffusion logic $c(r) > \\text{MIC}$ near the disk.\n- C. The $his^{-}$ strain spontaneously reverted to $his^{+}$ in the presence of the compound. Spontaneous reversion occurs at low frequency and would not cause a clear inhibition zone; moreover, the noted feature is absence of growth, not increased revertants.\n- D. The rat liver extract metabolized Compound Z into a non-toxic, non-mutagenic substance. The observed inhibition contradicts “non-toxic”; one cannot conclude non-mutagenicity or non-toxicity from a clear zone.\n- E. The trace histidine was insufficient to support growth near the disk. The histidine concentration in the agar is uniform; the spatially restricted absence of growth is due to the compound’s concentration gradient, not localized histidine depletion.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate conclusion consistent with the described observation is that Compound Z is toxic or antimicrobial to the Salmonella strain at the tested concentration near the disk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2096083"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond interpreting results, this practice delves into the clever genetic design of the Ames test itself. Why are specific types of mutations used in the tester strains? This thought experiment challenges you to consider what would happen if a tester strain had a large gene deletion instead of a point mutation. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the molecular mechanism of reversion and understand how the test is tailored to detect specific classes of mutagens [@problem_id:2096105].", "problem": "The Ames test is a widely used method to assess the mutagenic potential of chemical compounds. The standard procedure utilizes a set of tester strains of *Salmonella typhimurium* that are auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine, meaning they cannot synthesize it on their own. These strains carry specific point mutations or frameshift mutations in the *his* operon, the set of genes required for histidine biosynthesis. When these bacteria are plated on a medium containing the suspected mutagen but lacking histidine, only those bacteria that undergo a reversion mutation (a second mutation that restores the function of the *his* operon) will be able to grow and form colonies. The mutagenicity of the compound is considered proportional to the number of revertant colonies observed compared to a control plate without the mutagen.\n\nA student proposes to create a new tester strain for the Ames test. Instead of using a strain with a point mutation, this new strain has a large genomic deletion that removes the entirety of the *hisD* gene, a critical component of the *his* operon. The student argues that this strain is still a histidine auxotroph and should therefore be suitable for the test.\n\nIf this new strain with the large deletion in the *his* operon were used to test a known, potent chemical mutagen that typically causes base-pair substitutions, what would be the most likely outcome?\n\nA. The test would show a dramatically increased number of revertant colonies compared to a standard Ames test strain, indicating ultra-high sensitivity.\n\nB. The test would yield a false negative result, showing no significant increase in revertant colonies above the spontaneous background rate.\n\nC. The test result would be indistinguishable from that of a standard Ames test using a strain with a point mutation, as both strains are histidine auxotrophs.\n\nD. The strain would be unable to grow at all, even on the control plate, due to the severity of the genetic deletion.\n\nE. The test would only be positive for a specific class of mutagens that can insert entire genes, but not for the base-substitution mutagen being tested.", "solution": "The Ames test detects mutagens by selecting for reversion events that restore a functional allele of a histidine biosynthesis gene. The key mechanistic requirement is that the mutational spectrum induced by the tested compound can generate the specific genetic change needed to recover function.\n\nDefine two relevant genotypes:\n1) A point-mutation tester strain: let its defective allele be $his^{*}$, where $his^{*}$ differs from the wild-type $his^{+}$ by a single base alteration (or a single-base frameshift). A base-pair substitution mutagen increases the rate of base changes. Therefore, the required reversion event $his^{*}\\to his^{+}$ is a single-nucleotide event that the mutagen specifically promotes. If $r_{\\text{bs}}(M)$ denotes the rate of base substitutions under mutagen $M$, then the expected revertant count satisfies $N_{\\text{rev}}(M) \\propto r_{\\text{bs}}(M)$ and thus $N_{\\text{rev}}(M) \\gg N_{\\text{rev}}(\\text{control})$ for a potent base-substitution mutagen.\n\n2) The proposed deletion tester strain: let its defective allele be $his\\Delta$, where a large deletion removes the entirety of the *hisD* gene. This allele is missing $k$ contiguous base pairs, with $k$ on the order of the full gene length. Restoration of function now requires an event that replaces the missing sequence, i.e., an insertion or recombination that supplies at least $k$ bases in the correct order and context. A base-pair substitution mutagen elevates single-base changes but does not create or supply the missing $k$-bp segment. Formally, if the event required is $E_{\\text{restore}}=$ “precise insertion/replacement of $k$ missing bases,” then for a base-substitution mutagen $M$,\n$$\np(E_{\\text{restore}}\\mid M)\\approx p(E_{\\text{restore}}\\mid \\text{spont})\\;,\n$$\nbecause $M$ does not increase the probability of inserting an entire gene-length segment. Consequently, the expected number of revertants under $M$ versus control satisfies\n$$\nN_{\\text{rev}}(M)\\approx N_{\\text{rev}}(\\text{control})\\approx 0\\;,\n$$\nup to extremely rare recombination or transposition events that occur at spontaneous background frequencies and are not specifically promoted by base substitutions.\n\nTherefore, when testing a known, potent base-pair substitution mutagen on the deletion strain, there will be no significant increase in revertant colonies relative to the control plate lacking mutagen. This constitutes a false negative in the context of detecting base-substitution mutagenicity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the strain is viable; it can grow on rich media and, in the assay, would grow only if a revertant arises. The absence of colonies on minimal medium without histidine reflects the lack of revertants, not inviability per se. Option C is incorrect because the mutational target is fundamentally different: point mutants can revert via single-base changes, whereas deletions cannot. Option A is incorrect because sensitivity is reduced, not increased. Option E’s premise is not applicable to the Ames test’s typical mutagen classes; insertion of entire genes is not the mechanism by which base-substitution mutagens act, and such events are not what the Ames test is designed to assay.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a false negative result with no significant increase over background.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2096105"}]}
