This practice guides you through the logic of a classic experiment that provided the first key evidence for a secreted signaling molecule. By predicting the outcome of transferring cell-free liquid from a dense, \"communicating\" population to a sparse, \"listening\" one, you can deduce the fundamental principle of quorum sensing. [@problem_id:2090448]", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating cell-to-cell communication in the marine bacterium *Vibrio fischeri*. This bacterium is known for its ability to produce light, a phenomenon called bioluminescence. The production of light is regulated by a process known as quorum sensing, where the bacteria synthesize and secrete a small signaling molecule called an autoinducer. The genes responsible for light production, collectively known as the *lux* operon, are only expressed when the extracellular concentration of this autoinducer reaches a critical threshold.\n\nThe microbiologist prepares two liquid cultures of *Vibrio fischeri*:\n- **Culture H:** A high-density culture that has been growing for a long time. The bacteria in this culture are visibly glowing, indicating that the *lux* operon is active.\n- **Culture L:** A low-density culture that has just been inoculated. The bacteria in this culture are not glowing.\n\nThe microbiologist then performs an experiment. Culture H is centrifuged to pellet the bacterial cells, and the resulting cell-free liquid (supernatant) is carefully collected and passed through a filter that removes any remaining bacteria. A sample of this sterile, cell-free supernatant from Culture H is then added to Culture L.\n\nAssuming no other factors are limiting, what is the most likely immediate effect on the bacteria in Culture L?\n\nA. The bacteria in Culture L will begin to bioluminesce.\n\nB. The bacteria in Culture L will continue to show no bioluminescence.\n\nC. The addition of the supernatant will be toxic, causing the bacteria in Culture L to die.\n\nD. The bacteria in Culture L will begin to bioluminesce, but only after the population grows to a high density.\n\nE. The expression of the *lux* operon in Culture L will be actively inhibited.", "solution": "Quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri uses an autoinducer (an acyl-homoserine lactone) synthesized by LuxI that diffuses across membranes and accumulates extracellularly. When the extracellular concentration reaches a threshold, LuxR binds the autoinducer to form an active complex that activates the lux operon, leading to luciferase production and bioluminescence.\n\nDefine $[AI]$ as the autoinducer concentration and $C_{\\mathrm{th}}$ as the threshold required to activate the lux operon. In Culture H, visible light implies\n$$\n[AI]_{\\mathrm{H}} \\ge C_{\\mathrm{th}}.\n$$\nCentrifugation and filtration remove cells but do not remove the small autoinducer molecules, so the sterile supernatant retains $[AI]_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\n\nLet the initial low-density Culture L have $[AI]_{\\mathrm{L,init}} \\approx 0$ (subthreshold). After adding a volume $V_{s}$ of H supernatant (with $[AI]_{\\mathrm{H}}$) to a volume $V_{L}$ of Culture L, the new extracellular concentration in L is\n$$\n[AI]_{\\mathrm{L,new}}=\\frac{V_{s}[AI]_{\\mathrm{H}}+V_{L}[AI]_{\\mathrm{L,init}}}{V_{s}+V_{L}} \\approx \\frac{V_{s}[AI]_{\\mathrm{H}}}{V_{s}+V_{L}}.\n$$\nBecause $[AI]_{\\mathrm{H}} \\ge C_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and the problem states no other limiting factors (implying sufficient $V_{s}$ and stability of the autoinducer), the most likely outcome is\n$$\n[AI]_{\\mathrm{L,new}} \\ge C_{\\mathrm{th}}.\n$$\nThis immediately enables LuxR to bind autoinducer, forming the active LuxR–AI complex that activates the lux operon, causing bioluminescence without waiting for a population increase. Therefore, Culture L will begin to bioluminesce promptly after addition. Options B, D, and E are inconsistent with quorum-sensing activation by exogenous autoinducer, and toxicity (C) is not expected from sterile supernatant of the same species under the given assumption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090448"}, {"introduction": "Once the existence of a chemical signal is established, the next logical step is to identify the molecular machinery responsible for its production. This practice employs a common and powerful strategy in molecular genetics: analyzing a mutant strain that has a non-functional version of a specific gene. By observing the behavior of a bacterium that cannot synthesize its own autoinducer, you will clarify the essential role of the synthase enzyme in initiating the entire quorum sensing cascade. [@problem_id:2090444]", "problem": "Quorum Sensing (QS) is a system of stimulus and response correlated to population density that many bacteria use to coordinate gene expression. The marine bacterium *Vibrio fischeri* uses a well-studied QS system to control bioluminescence. At high cell densities, each bacterium produces and secretes a small signaling molecule, an Acyl-Homoserine Lactone (AHL), which serves as an autoinducer. The synthesis of this AHL molecule is catalyzed by the enzyme LuxI. When the extracellular concentration of AHL reaches a critical threshold, it diffuses back into the cells and binds to the transcriptional regulator protein, LuxR. The AHL-LuxR complex then activates the transcription of the *lux* operon, which contains the genes for the luciferase enzyme and other components necessary for light production.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *Vibrio fischeri* that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the *luxI* gene, rendering the LuxI enzyme completely non-functional. Assume that all other genes, including *luxR* and the entire *lux* operon, are wild-type and fully functional. A pure culture of this *luxI* mutant strain is grown in a suitable liquid medium until it reaches a very high cell density, a condition that would cause a wild-type culture to be strongly bioluminescent.\n\nWhich one of the following phenotypes will this high-density culture of the *luxI* mutant strain exhibit?\n\nA. The culture will not produce light.\n\nB. The culture will produce light, but at a much lower intensity compared to the wild-type.\n\nC. The culture will produce light, but only after a significantly longer incubation period at high density.\n\nD. The culture will produce light constitutively, even at low cell densities.\n\nE. The cells in the culture will be unable to grow and divide to reach a high density.", "solution": "Quorum sensing in wild-type Vibrio fischeri relies on LuxI-catalyzed synthesis of the autoinducer AHL, which accumulates extracellularly and, upon reaching a threshold, binds LuxR to form an AHL–LuxR complex that activates the lux operon, leading to luciferase expression and light production.\n\nLet $[A](t)$ denote the extracellular AHL concentration and $N$ the cell density. In a well-mixed culture, a minimal phenomenological mass-balance for AHL is\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = \\alpha N - k [A],\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the per-cell AHL production rate (catalyzed by LuxI) and $k$ represents effective loss by degradation/dilution. For the *luxI* loss-of-function mutant, LuxI is non-functional, so $\\alpha = 0$, leading to:\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k[A].\n$$\nWith no exogenous AHL added and starting from $[A](0)=0$, the solution satisfies $[A](t)=0$ for all $t$. More generally, the steady state satisfies:\n$$\n0 = -k[A] \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad [A]=0.\n$$\nThus, even at very high $N$, the production term remains zero and $[A]$ cannot accumulate.\n\nLuxR activation depends on AHL binding. For a simple one-to-one binding model, the fractional occupancy of LuxR by AHL is $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_{d} + [A]},\n$$\nwith $K_{d}$ the dissociation constant. With $[A]=0$, we obtain\n$$\n\\theta = 0,\n$$\nso LuxR remains unliganded, and the AHL–LuxR complex does not form. Therefore, there is no activation of the *lux* operon and no induction of luciferase expression; the culture remains dark.\n\nEvaluating the answer choices:\n- A: The culture will not produce light. This matches the conclusion above.\n- B and C: These require some AHL synthesis or accumulation over time; however, with $\\alpha=0$, no amount of time or density rescues AHL levels in a pure culture.\n- D: Constitutive light at low density would require LuxR activation without AHL or constitutive *lux* expression, which is not the case here.\n- E: Growth to high density is unrelated to LuxI-mediated AHL synthesis; QS is not essential for viability in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotype is no light production.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090444"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a biological pathway is the foundation for learning how to control it, a principle at the heart of modern medicine and biotechnology.

The key components of this system are:\n1.  **LuxI-like synthase**: An enzyme that synthesizes an autoinducer molecule, an Acyl-Homoserine Lactone (AHL).\n2.  **LuxR-like receptor**: An intracellular protein that acts as a transcriptional regulator.\n\nThe system functions as follows: at a high population density, the concentration of the AHL autoinducer increases, allowing it to diffuse into the cells and bind to the LuxR-like receptor. The resulting AHL-receptor complex undergoes a conformational change that activates it. This activated complex then binds to a specific promoter region on the bacterial chromosome, thereby inducing the transcription of genes responsible for pigment production.\n\nA bioengineer synthesizes a novel molecule, named Quorum Blocker-7 (QB-7), which is a structural analog of the natural AHL autoinducer. Experimental characterization reveals two key properties of QB-7:\n1.  It reversibly binds to the same site on the LuxR-like receptor as the natural AHL, but with a significantly higher affinity.\n2.  The binding of QB-7 to the LuxR-like receptor does not induce the necessary conformational change for the receptor to become a transcriptionally active complex.\n\nA culture of *Chromobacterium novum* is grown to a high cell density, a condition under which it would normally produce a deep purple pigment.
