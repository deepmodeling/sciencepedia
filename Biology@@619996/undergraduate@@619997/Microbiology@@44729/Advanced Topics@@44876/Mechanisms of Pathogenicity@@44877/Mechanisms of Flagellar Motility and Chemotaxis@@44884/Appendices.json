{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding bacterial motility begins with the 'run-and-tumble' model, a simple yet effective strategy for exploring an environment. This behavior is directly governed by the rotational direction of the flagella. This first practice problem [@problem_id:2078304] challenges you to predict the movement of a hypothetical mutant, helping to solidify the distinct roles of counter-clockwise and clockwise rotation in generating forward \"runs\" versus reorienting \"tumbles.\"", "problem": "In many motile bacteria, such as *Escherichia coli*, movement is achieved through the rotation of flagella distributed over the cell surface, a configuration known as peritrichous flagellation. The cell's movement pattern, often described as a \"random walk,\" is composed of two distinct modes. The first mode is a \"run,\" where the flagella rotate in a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction. This synchronized rotation causes the individual flagella to form a cohesive bundle that acts as a propeller, driving the cell forward in a relatively straight line. The second mode is a \"tumble,\" where the direction of flagellar rotation reverses to clockwise (CW). This change causes the flagellar bundle to fly apart, and the uncoordinated motion of the individual flagella causes the cell to stop and randomly reorient itself in space. By alternating between runs and tumbles, the bacterium can explore its environment.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of such a bacterium. This strain has a genetic defect in its flagellar motor switch complex, which results in the flagella being permanently locked in a state of counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation. They are unable to switch to a clockwise (CW) rotation.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected motility pattern of this mutant bacterium?\n\nA. The bacterium will be completely non-motile, as the inability to switch rotational direction prevents any form of propulsion.\n\nB. The bacterium will be stuck in a state of continuous tumbling, randomly spinning in place without making significant forward progress.\n\nC. The bacterium will exhibit a pattern of long, smooth \"runs\" but will be unable to execute \"tumbles\" to change its direction.\n\nD. The bacterium will move in a normal \"run-and-tumble\" pattern, indistinguishable from a wild-type cell.\n\nE. The bacterium will only be able to swim in reverse, as the flagellar bundle will form improperly.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires a fundamental understanding of bacterial motility through flagellar rotation. We must analyze the consequence of the mutant's specific limitation.\n\nFirst, let's review the two standard modes of movement in a wild-type peritrichous bacterium.\n1.  **Run:** This is a phase of directional movement. It is caused by the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of all flagella. This specific rotation direction allows the individual flagellar filaments to come together and form a single, rotating bundle that functions like a ship's propeller, pushing the bacterium forward.\n2.  **Tumble:** This is a phase of reorientation. It is caused by a switch in the motor to clockwise (CW) rotation. The CW rotation disrupts the flagellar bundle, causing the filaments to fly apart and rotate independently. This creates a chaotic, uncoordinated force that stops the cell's forward motion and causes it to reorient randomly.\n\nThe problem states that the mutant bacterium has its flagella locked in the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotational state. This means the bacterium can perform the action associated with CCW rotation but cannot perform the action associated with CW rotation.\n\nBased on our review, CCW rotation is the direct cause of the \"run\" phase. The flagella will form a bundle and propel the cell forward. Therefore, the bacterium is fully capable of motility and will be able to \"run.\"\n\nHowever, the \"tumble\" phase is entirely dependent on the ability to switch to CW rotation. Since the mutant is incapable of CW rotation, its flagellar bundle can never be made to fly apart. Consequently, the bacterium can never \"tumble\" and reorient itself.\n\nCombining these two points, the mutant bacterium will be stuck in a permanent \"run\" mode. It will swim forward continuously in long, smooth paths. While minor directional changes might occur due to Brownian motion or collisions, the bacterium lacks the intrinsic biological mechanism to purposefully stop and change its direction.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\nA. The bacterium will be completely non-motile. This is incorrect. The CCW rotation still generates propulsive force, so the bacterium will be motile.\nB. The bacterium will be stuck in a state of continuous tumbling. This is incorrect. Tumbling is caused by CW rotation, which the mutant cannot perform.\nC. The bacterium will exhibit a pattern of long, smooth \"runs\" but will be unable to execute \"tumbles\" to change its direction. This accurately describes the consequence of being locked in the CCW \"run\" mode.\nD. The bacterium will move in a normal \"run-and-tumble\" pattern. This is incorrect. The inability to tumble makes its movement pattern fundamentally different from a wild-type cell.\nE. The bacterium will only be able to swim in reverse. This is incorrect. For peritrichous bacteria like *E. coli*, CCW rotation of the bundled flagella results in forward, not reverse, motion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078304"}, {"introduction": "Having established the link between flagellar rotation and movement, we now delve into the mechanics of the motor itself. The flagellar motor is a marvel of nano-engineering, but it still obeys fundamental laws of physics. This exercise [@problem_id:2078340] asks you to consider the consequences of a mechanical failure in the motor's stationary component, or stator, applying principles like Newton's third law to understand how torque is generated and translated into functional rotation relative to the cell body.", "problem": "The bacterial flagellum is a remarkable nanomachine that enables motility. Its rotary motor is embedded in the cell envelope and is powered by the flow of ions, typically protons, across the cytoplasmic membrane. This ion flow is driven by the cell's Proton Motive Force (PMF). The motor consists of a rotating part (the rotor, including the MS-ring and C-ring) and a stationary part (the stator). In many bacteria, such as *Escherichia coli*, the stator is composed of protein complexes made of MotA and MotB. The MotA proteins assemble to form a transmembrane channel for protons, while the MotB protein serves to anchor the entire MotA/MotB stator complex to the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, holding it stationary relative to the cell body.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of *E. coli* that possesses a specific mutation in the gene encoding the MotB protein. This mutated MotB protein is still able to properly fold and form a complex with MotA proteins. However, the mutation has completely eliminated its ability to bind to the peptidoglycan. Assuming all other components of the flagellar motor assemble correctly, what is the most immediate and direct consequence of this specific mutation on flagellar function?\n\nA. The flagellum will rotate exclusively in a clockwise direction, causing the cell to tumble continuously.\n\nB. The flagellar motor will fail to generate any torque, as the flow of protons through the stator will be completely blocked.\n\nC. The entire stator complex will rotate along with the rotor, resulting in no net rotation of the flagellum relative to the cell body.\n\nD. The assembly of the entire flagellum will be halted at the stage of stator installation, preventing the formation of a complete motor.\n\nE. The motor will spin at a much higher speed than the wild-type motor but will be unable to switch its direction of rotation.", "solution": "The MotA/MotB stator converts the proton motive force into mechanical torque on the rotor by exerting a torque due to ion flow. By Newton’s third law, if the rotor experiences a torque $\\tau$ from stator-rotor interactions, the stator experiences a reaction torque $-\\tau$. In the wild type, MotB binds peptidoglycan, so the peptidoglycan provides an external counter-torque that anchors the stator, allowing the rotor to spin relative to the cell body. Symbolically, for the stator in the wild type, $-\\tau+\\tau_{\\text{wall}}=0$, so the stator remains stationary relative to the cell, while the rotor experiences a net torque $\\tau$ and rotates.\n\nWith the MotB mutation eliminating peptidoglycan binding, the stator no longer has an external anchoring torque ($\\tau_{\\text{wall}}=0$). Consider the combined rotor-stator system about the motor axis. The only torques present are internal interaction torques between rotor and stator, which sum to zero by Newton’s third law. Thus, the net external torque on the rotor-stator system is zero, and the total angular momentum is conserved. Starting from rest, the internal torque driven by proton flow produces equal and opposite angular momenta in rotor and stator such that\n$$\nI_{r}\\omega_{r}+I_{s}\\omega_{s}=0,\n$$\nwhere $I_{r}$ and $I_{s}$ are the moments of inertia of the rotor and stator, respectively, and $\\omega_{r}$ and $\\omega_{s}$ are their angular velocities relative to the cell body. Because the stator is not anchored, it counter-rotates rather than remaining stationary, so there is no fixed reference frame for the motor to do work on the rotor relative to the cell. In the limiting case of negligible external drag on the stator, the stator co-rotates such that there is effectively no net rotation of the flagellum relative to the cell body despite proton flow. Therefore, proton conduction is not blocked, but torque cannot be transmitted to spin the flagellum relative to the cell, matching the description that the stator rotates along with the rotor and yielding no net rotation of the flagellum relative to the cell body.\n\nHence, the most immediate and direct consequence is that the stator complex fails to remain stationary and co-rotates with the rotor, abolishing effective torque on the flagellum relative to the cell body, which corresponds to option C (and rules out B, since proton flow is not blocked; A and E concern directionality or speed, not anchoring; D is excluded by the premise that assembly proceeds).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078340"}, {"introduction": "Bacteria do not switch between running and tumbling at random; their decisions are controlled by a sophisticated intracellular signaling pathway that responds to environmental cues. To understand how a cell 'decides' to change direction, we must examine the molecular components that process information. This final problem [@problem_id:2078275] introduces the core of this pathway by exploring a mutant that lacks the central sensor kinase, CheA, illuminating its critical role in regulating the switch between running and tumbling.", "problem": "In peritrichously flagellated bacteria such as *Escherichia coli*, movement is characterized by an alternation between two distinct behaviors: a \"run\" and a \"tumble\". A run is a period of smooth, directed swimming caused by the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of the flagellar filaments, which allows them to form a cohesive bundle that propels the cell forward. A tumble is a brief, erratic reorientation caused by the clockwise (CW) rotation of the flagella, which causes the bundle to fly apart.\n\nThis switching is controlled by an intracellular signaling pathway. In the absence of a chemical attractant, a sensor kinase protein, CheA, undergoes autophosphorylation. This phosphorylated CheA then transfers its phosphate group to a response regulator protein, CheY. The phosphorylated form of CheY, denoted as CheY-P, is the species that interacts with the flagellar motor's switch complex. The binding of CheY-P to the motor induces a switch from the motor's default CCW rotation to CW rotation, thereby causing a tumble.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has undergone a complete gene deletion for the *cheA* gene, resulting in a total absence of the CheA protein. Which of the following options best describes the resulting motility phenotype of this mutant bacterium?\n\nA. The bacterium will be constantly tumbling.\n\nB. The bacterium will be non-motile (unable to move at all).\n\nC. The bacterium will exhibit constant, smooth running with no tumbling.\n\nD. The bacterium will be motile but will show a reversed chemotactic response, moving away from attractants and towards repellents.\n\nE. The bacterium will alternate between runs and tumbles, but the frequency of tumbling will be significantly higher than in a wild-type cell.", "solution": "We use the known chemotaxis signaling logic in peritrichously flagellated bacteria: the default flagellar motor state is counter-clockwise (CCW), which produces a run, and binding of phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) to the motor increases clockwise (CW) bias, producing tumbles.\n\nDeletion of the *cheA* gene implies the total absence of the CheA protein, so set $[\\text{CheA}]=0$.\n\nCheA autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer steps are\n$$\\text{CheA} \\to \\text{CheA-P}, \\quad \\text{CheA-P} + \\text{CheY} \\to \\text{CheA} + \\text{CheY-P}.$$\nWith $[\\text{CheA}]=0$, production of CheA-P is zero:\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{CheA-P}]}{dt} = k_{a}[\\text{CheA}] - \\cdots = 0,$$\nso $[\\text{CheA-P}]=0$ at all times. Consequently, the CheY phosphorylation flux is zero.\n$$v_{\\text{Y,phos}} = k_{t}[\\text{CheA-P}][\\text{CheY}] = 0.$$\nCheY-P is continuously dephosphorylated (e.g., by CheZ and intrinsic hydrolysis):\n$$\\text{CheY-P} \\to \\text{CheY}, \\quad v_{\\text{Y,dephos}} = k_{z}[\\text{CheY-P}].$$\nAt steady state, setting production equal to loss gives\n$$0 - k_{z}[\\text{CheY-P}] = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [\\text{CheY-P}]=0.$$\n\nMotor CW bias is an increasing function of $[\\text{CheY-P}]$, say\n$$P_{\\text{CW}} = f([\\text{CheY-P}]), \\quad \\frac{df}{d[\\text{CheY-P}]}>0,$$\nso with $[\\text{CheY-P}]\\approx 0$, we have $P_{\\text{CW}}\\approx 0$; the motor remains in its default CCW state, producing smooth runs without tumbles.\n\nTherefore, the *cheA* deletion mutant is motile but exhibits constant, smooth running with no tumbling, which corresponds to option C. Options A and E require elevated $[\\text{CheY-P}]$, which cannot occur without CheA; option B is incorrect because the flagellar motors still rotate CCW in the absence of CheY-P; option D requires signal processing and CheY-P modulation that are abolished without CheA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078275"}]}
