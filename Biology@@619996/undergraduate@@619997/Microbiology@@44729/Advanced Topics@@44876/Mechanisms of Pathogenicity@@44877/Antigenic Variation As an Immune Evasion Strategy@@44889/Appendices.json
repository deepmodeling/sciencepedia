By analyzing the arrangement of expression sites and silent gene cassettes, you will learn to distinguish between different strategies like gene conversion, phase variation, and promoter inversion.", "problem": "A microbiologist discovers a new pathogenic bacterium, *Variabilibacter commutans*, which is known for its ability to cause recurrent infections by evading the host's adaptive immune response. Genomic analysis reveals that the bacterium has a single expression locus, designated `ompE`, which codes for a major outer membrane protein that is the primary target of host antibodies. Located downstream from `ompE` on the chromosome are approximately 80 different, promoter-less, and transcriptionally silent gene cassettes, collectively named `ompS`. Each `ompS` cassette contains a unique sequence encoding a functionally equivalent but antigenically distinct version of the outer membrane protein. The bacterium is observed to rapidly change the antigenic identity of the protein expressed from the `ompE` locus.\n\nBased on this genomic organization, which of the following is the most likely DNA-level mechanism responsible for this antigenic variation?\n\nA. Slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication within a region of short tandem repeats in the `ompE` gene, causing a frameshift that results in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nB. A mobile genetic element known as a transposon, containing a promoter, randomly inserting itself upstream of one of the 80 silent `ompS` cassettes, thereby activating its transcription.\n\nC. A site-specific recombinase that inverts a DNA segment containing a promoter, causing it to alternately face either the `ompE` locus or a single adjacent `ompS` cassette.\n\nD. A non-reciprocal recombination event where a copy of one of the silent `ompS` cassettes is transferred to the `ompE` locus, replacing the sequence previously present at that site.\n\nE. A specialized bacteriophage that packages a random `ompS` cassette and injects it into a new recipient bacterium, a process known as generalized transduction.", "solution": "The key observations are: there is a single expression locus (ompE) that is the target of host antibodies; downstream there are approximately 80 promoter-less, transcriptionally silent cassettes (ompS), each encoding a functionally equivalent but antigenically distinct version of the same outer membrane protein; and the bacterium rapidly changes the antigenic identity of the protein expressed from the ompE locus. A mechanism that best explains this architecture and behavior is one in which silent cassettes serve as donors of sequence information that can be moved into the single expression site without altering their own silent status. This is the classic arrangement for antigenic variation by gene conversion: non-reciprocal homologous recombination copies sequence from a silent donor cassette into the expressed locus, thereby replacing the variable region at ompE while leaving the donor intact. This allows repeated, rapid switches among many antigenic variants using a single promoter-driven expression site, exactly as observed in systems such as Neisseria pilE/pilS and Borrelia vlsE.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA describes slipped-strand mispairing in short tandem repeats causing frameshifts. That mechanism leads to phase variation (on/off states or length variation) and often produces truncated, non-functional products, not the repeated exchange among many antigenically distinct, yet functional, variants encoded in multiple silent cassettes. It does not match the presence of many silent, promoter-less cassettes nor the maintenance of function.\nB posits a transposon with a promoter inserting upstream of a silent cassette to activate it. This would drive expression at the cassette’s own locus, not at the single ompE expression site, and would rely on random insertion events that are not a controlled, rapid, and repeatable means to cycle among approximately 80 variants. It also does not explain why the silent cassettes are promoter-less yet the expression consistently occurs from ompE.\nC invokes promoter inversion to alternately face ompE or a single adjacent ompS. Promoter inversion typically toggles between two states and at most switches between a small number of targets, not among approximately 80 distinct cassettes. The described genomic organization does not support a single invertible promoter selectively addressing many downstream cassettes.\nD describes a non-reciprocal recombination (gene conversion) that copies a silent cassette into the ompE locus, replacing the previously expressed sequence. This precisely matches the presence of many promoter-less silent cassettes and a single expression locus, and it explains rapid, repeated antigenic switching while preserving functional equivalence and diversity.\nE describes phage-mediated transduction, which is a population-level horizontal transfer mechanism and does not account for rapid, within-lineage antigenic switching at a single expression locus. Furthermore, the wording conflates specialized and generalized transduction and is inconsistent with the observed within-genome cassette architecture.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism is non-reciprocal recombination (gene conversion) from a silent cassette into the expression locus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2052541"}, {"introduction": "The decision of a single bacterium to switch its antigenic state is a microscopic event, but the collective behavior of a population can be predicted with mathematical models.

In this practice, you will use given switching rates to calculate the equilibrium proportion of non-motile cells in a bacterial population, providing a quantitative look at how these stochastic events create a stable population structure [@problem_id:2052503].", "problem": "*Campylobacter jejuni* is a common foodborne pathogen that uses a single polar flagellum for motility, a key factor in its ability to colonize the intestinal tract. To evade the host's adaptive immune system, which can produce antibodies targeting the flagellar protein (flagellin), *C. jejuni* employs a strategy called phase variation. This mechanism allows the bacterium to randomly switch the expression of its primary flagellin gene, *flaA*, on or off. When *flaA* is expressed, the bacterium is motile and antigenic (Fla+).

This final exercise presents a thought experiment comparing a pathogen with a fixed, programmed sequence of antigen expression to one that switches randomly from a large repertoire [@problem_id:2052556]. By contrasting these two hypothetical scenarios, you will develop a deeper understanding of how the underlying molecular strategy shapes the clinical presentation of a disease and the likelihood of developing long-lasting immunity.", "problem": "Consider two hypothetical bacterial pathogens that have evolved different strategies of antigenic variation to evade the host immune system.\n\nPathogen A, *Variabilis ordinatus*, possesses a set of 12 distinct genes for its major surface antigen. Upon infection, it always expresses antigen gene #1. The host immune system mounts a response, clearing most of the bacteria. However, a small fraction of the surviving population synchronously switches to expressing antigen gene #2. This process repeats in a fixed, ordered sequence (1 → 2 → 3 → ... → 12 → 1). This entire sequence, or \"program,\" is identical in every infected individual.\n\nPathogen B, *Fortuita mutabilis*, possesses a large repertoire of over 100 distinct antigen genes. Upon infection, it expresses one of these antigens at random. When the host mounts an immune response against the dominant antigen, surviving bacteria switch to expressing another randomly chosen antigen from the entire repertoire. There is no fixed order, and the sequence of expressed antigens is stochastic and unique to each infection.\n\nBased on these mechanisms, which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the clinical and epidemiological features of the diseases caused by these two pathogens?\n\nA. *F. mutabilis* is more likely to cause explosive, widespread epidemics with clear waves of infection and recovery, while *V. ordinatus* is more suited for causing chronic, endemic disease that persists at a low level in the population.\n\nB. An individual who has recovered from a complete 12-stage infection with *V. ordinatus* would likely be immune to reinfection. In contrast, achieving complete, long-lasting immunity to *F. mutabilis* through natural infection is highly improbable.\n\nC. Infections by both pathogens would be clinically identical, presenting as a single, acute illness that is quickly resolved by the adaptive immune system, as the initial antigen is always cleared.\n\nD. A vaccine targeting only antigen #1 of *V. ordinatus* would be sufficient to prevent the disease it causes, as it would block the infection at the first step.\n\nE. The genetic mechanism of *V. ordinatus* is inherently more complex than that of *F. mutabilis* because it requires a regulatory system to enforce the sequence, resulting in a more severe and rapidly progressing disease.", "solution": "We analyze how each pathogen’s antigenic variation strategy shapes within-host immunity, reinfection potential, and population-level transmission.\n\nFirst, define the mechanisms. For *Variabilis ordinatus* (Pathogen A), the expressed antigen follows a fixed, ordered program $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to \\cdots \\to 12 \\to 1$, identical across hosts. The host adaptive immune system mounts specific responses against each antigen it encounters, generating immunological memory to that antigen. Because the sequence is deterministic and finite, a single infection that progresses through all $12$ antigens exposes the host to the complete antigen set. By the principle of immunological memory, subsequent exposure to any of these $12$ antigens triggers a rapid, high-affinity secondary response, preventing significant pathogen expansion under the same program. Therefore, after a complete $12$-stage infection, the host is likely to possess effective immunity to reinfection by the same pathogen running the same program, as any reintroduced bacteria begin at antigen $1$ and are neutralized quickly, and any switch to antigens $2$ through $12$ would also be covered by prior memory.\n\nIn contrast, *Fortuita mutabilis* (Pathogen B) expresses antigen variants by random choice from a large repertoire exceeding $100$, with switching after immune pressure to another randomly chosen antigen from the entire repertoire. Key principles apply: the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific, and immunological memory is specific to previously encountered antigens. Since there is no fixed order and the repertoire is large, any single infection exposes the host to a small, stochastic subset of the total antigen pool. The probability that a host encounters the entire repertoire through natural infections is low, and the sequence of exposure varies across individuals. Consequently, the development of complete, durable immunity to all circulating variants via natural infection is highly improbable. At the population level, herd immunity is fragmented because different hosts accumulate memory to different, partial subsets of variants.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\nA. Claims *F. mutabilis* is more likely to cause explosive epidemics with clear waves and that *V. ordinatus* is better suited to chronic, low-level endemism. This contradicts the mechanistic expectations. The random, large-repertoire strategy of *F. mutabilis* supports ongoing, diffuse transmission with immune escape and reinfections, favoring endemic persistence rather than synchronized epidemic waves. Conversely, the finite, deterministic program in *V. ordinatus* allows individuals and populations to accumulate comprehensive immunity to the full set, which would limit long-term transmission rather than favor chronic endemicity. Hence A is incorrect.\n\nB. States that recovery from a complete $12$-stage infection with *V. ordinatus* likely confers immunity to reinfection, while complete, long-lasting immunity to *F. mutabilis* is highly improbable. This follows directly from the principles above: finite deterministic set with complete exposure yields broad memory for *V. ordinatus*, whereas a large, randomly sampled repertoire resists complete immune coverage through natural infection for *F. mutabilis*. Hence B is correct.\n\nC. Claims both infections present as a single, acute illness quickly resolved because the initial antigen is always cleared. This ignores antigenic switching that enables persistence and relapsing courses. Hence C is incorrect.\n\nD. Claims a vaccine targeting only antigen $1$ of *V. ordinatus* would be sufficient to prevent disease. Because the pathogen can switch to antigens $2$ through $12$, targeting a single antigen would not ensure prevention once switching occurs; sterilizing immunity against only the first antigen would not block subsequent variants. Hence D is incorrect.\n\nE. Asserts that *V. ordinatus*’s mechanism is inherently more complex and therefore results in a more severe and rapidly progressing disease. Mechanistic regulatory complexity does not imply greater clinical severity or speed of progression; moreover, large-repertoire random systems may be genetically complex through recombination and gene conversion. The causal link claimed is unfounded. Hence E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate comparison is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2052556"}]}
