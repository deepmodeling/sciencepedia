The student takes two cultures of bacteria, one known to be Gram-positive and the other Gram-negative. Both cultures are suspended in an isotonic sucrose solution. The student then adds lysozyme, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the $\\beta(1-4)$ glycosidic bonds in peptidoglycan, to both suspensions. After incubation, the Gram-positive bacteria are converted into protoplasts, and the Gram-negative bacteria are converted into spheroplasts.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly distinguishes the resulting protoplast from the spheroplast?\n\nA. Both the protoplast and the spheroplast are completely devoid of a plasma membrane.\n\nB. The protoplast has its plasma membrane and a thin, residual layer of peptidoglycan, while the spheroplast has only its plasma membrane.\n\nC. The spheroplast retains the outer membrane and the plasma membrane, whereas the protoplast retains only the plasma membrane.\n\nD. Protoplasts are derived from Gram-negative bacteria, while spheroplasts are derived from Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nE.

In an isotonic sucrose solution, osmotic lysis is prevented, allowing cell wall-deficient forms to persist.\n\nGram-positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan layer and lack an outer membrane. When lysozyme removes this peptidoglycan, the resulting entity retains only the cytoplasmic (plasma) membrane and intracellular contents; this structure is called a protoplast.\n\nGram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer located in the periplasm between the inner (plasma) membrane and an outer membrane. Lysozyme hydrolyzes the peptidoglycan, but the outer membrane is not removed by lysozyme alone. Thus, the resulting structure retains the outer membrane and the plasma membrane, often with little to no peptidoglycan; this is called a spheroplast.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because both forms retain the plasma membrane; loss of the plasma membrane would be lethal and is not the definition of either structure.\n- B is false because the protoplast lacks peptidoglycan, while the spheroplast retains the outer membrane; the statement reverses the features.\n- C is correct: the spheroplast retains both outer and plasma membranes, whereas the protoplast retains only the plasma membrane.\n- D is false: protoplasts typically derive from Gram-positive bacteria; spheroplasts from Gram-negative.\n- E is false: both are osmotically fragile and would lyse in a hypotonic solution; isotonic sucrose is used to prevent lysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct distinguishing statement is that the spheroplast retains the outer membrane and the plasma membrane, whereas the protoplast retains only the plasma membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078883"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the cell wall, many pathogenic bacteria and yeasts possess a polysaccharide capsule that serves as a critical virulence factor, protecting the microbe from the host's immune system.

However, bacteria can sometimes evade these drugs through a remarkable phenotypic adaptation rather than genetic resistance. This exercise explores the clinical implications of L-forms—bacteria that have lost their cell wall—and challenges you to explain a case of treatment relapse, connecting the fundamental mechanism of antibiotic action to real-world medical outcomes. [@problem_id:2078878]", "problem": "A 45-year-old patient presents with a severe, recurrent skin abscess. A culture of the abscess fluid identifies the causative agent as a strain of *Staphylococcus aureus* that is sensitive to penicillin in laboratory tests. The patient is prescribed a standard course of penicillin. During the treatment, the abscess shows significant improvement. However, two weeks after the antibiotic course is completed, the abscess reappears in the same location. A microbiologist hypothesizes that during the initial treatment, the bacteria converted into cell wall-deficient variants, known as L-forms, which persisted within the host tissues.\n\nAssuming the microbiologist's hypothesis is correct, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the failure of the penicillin treatment and the subsequent relapse of the infection?\n\nA. The L-forms lack a peptidoglycan cell wall, the specific molecular target of penicillin, allowing them to persist in the osmotically stable environment of host tissues.\n\nB. The L-forms are metabolically dormant, endospore-like structures that are inherently resistant to all classes of antibiotics.\n\nC. The L-forms developed high-efficiency efflux pumps that actively transport penicillin out of the cell before it can reach its target.\n\nD. The L-forms are able to rapidly secrete beta-lactamase enzymes, which degrade the penicillin in the surrounding tissue.\n\nE. The bacteria underwent a stable genetic mutation in the genes for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which was induced by the initial antibiotic exposure.", "solution": "We identify the antibiotic mechanism: penicillin, a beta-lactam, binds penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and inhibits transpeptidation during peptidoglycan synthesis, thereby weakening or preventing formation of the bacterial cell wall. Its bactericidal action requires actively growing bacteria synthesizing peptidoglycan; the drug’s specific target is the peptidoglycan cell wall.\n\nWe define L-forms: cell wall-deficient variants that arise when peptidoglycan synthesis is disrupted. These forms are phenotypic variants lacking the rigid peptidoglycan layer; they can persist in osmotically protected environments, such as host tissues, where osmotic lysis is less likely. They are not endospores, and they remain metabolically active and can replicate, though they are fragile outside isotonic conditions.\n\nWe connect mechanism to clinical course: during penicillin therapy, bacteria synthesizing cell wall are killed, but any bacteria converted to L-forms lack the peptidoglycan target, rendering beta-lactams ineffective. These L-forms can persist in host tissues during therapy. After the antibiotic is discontinued, L-forms can revert to walled forms, resume peptidoglycan synthesis, and reestablish infection, explaining the relapse.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- Option A accurately states that L-forms lack the peptidoglycan cell wall targeted by penicillin and can persist in osmotically stable host tissues, explaining survival during therapy and relapse afterwards.\n- Option B is incorrect because L-forms are not endospores and are not inherently resistant to all antibiotics; they are specifically refractory to agents targeting the cell wall, while other classes (e.g., protein or nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors) may remain active.\n- Option C is not a defining feature of L-forms; development of high-efficiency efflux pumps is a separate resistance mechanism and is not the central explanation for beta-lactam failure when the drug’s target is absent.\n- Option D contradicts the initial sensitivity profile and is unnecessary to explain survival of L-forms; beta-lactamase production is a common resistance mechanism but not the reason L-forms lack susceptibility to beta-lactams.\n- Option E is incorrect because penicillin does not induce stable mutations; L-form formation is a reversible, non-genetic phenotypic state. Moreover, the relapse mechanism is better explained by reversion from L-forms than by an induced stable PBP mutation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2078878"}]}
