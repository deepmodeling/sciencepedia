They hypothesize that fimbriae, which are hair-like appendages on the bacterial surface, are crucial for the bacterium's ability to attach to host tissues. To test this hypothesis, they conduct an in-vitro adherence assay using two strains: a wild-type (WT) strain that naturally produces fimbriae, and a genetically engineered mutant (MUT) strain in which the gene cluster responsible for fimbriae synthesis has been deleted.\n\nIn the experiment, monolayers of human epithelial cells were cultured in petri dishes. Each dish was inoculated with a bacterial suspension containing an initial concentration of $2.0 \\times 10^7$ bacteria. After a one-hour incubation period, the non-adherent bacteria were washed away. The remaining bacteria, which had successfully attached to the epithelial cells, were then lysed and quantified.

Genetic analysis reveals that this strain carries a specific plasmid, designated `pVir98`, which is not found in non-pathogenic, commensal strains of *S. aureus*. The `pVir98` plasmid is found to harbor three distinct genes critical to the bacterium's behavior:\n1.  **`exfB`**: Encodes Exfoliative Toxin B, a protease that specifically cleaves desmoglein-1, a protein essential for cell-cell adhesion in the upper layers of the epidermis.\n2.  **`fnbA`**: Encodes Fibronectin-Binding Protein A, an adhesin that allows the bacterium to bind strongly to fibronectin in the host's extracellular matrix and on mucosal surfaces.\n3.  **`blaZ`**: Encodes a beta-lactamase enzyme that inactivates penicillin-class antibiotics.\n\nThe microbiologist successfully \"cures\" the pathogenic strain of its plasmid, creating an isogenic strain `S. aureus (pVir98-)` that is identical to the original wild-type strain `S. aureus (pVir98+)` except for the absence of the `pVir98` plasmid.\n\nBased on the functions of the genes lost, which of the following is the most likely multifaceted consequence for the cured `S. aureus (pVir98-)` strain compared to the wild-type strain?\n\nA. The cured strain will be unable to grow in standard laboratory media but will show enhanced biofilm formation on plastic surfaces.\n\nB. The cured strain will be completely avirulent, unable to survive in a host, but will retain its resistance to penicillin.\n\nC. The cured strain will primarily be affected in its ability to be treated, becoming highly susceptible to all antibiotics, but its ability to cause skin blistering will remain unchanged.\n\nD. The cured strain will show significantly reduced ability to colonize wound sites and will no longer cause the characteristic epidermal peeling, but it will remain capable of causing a less severe, more localized infection.\n\nE. The cured strain will exhibit a faster growth rate due to the reduced metabolic load of the plasmid, making it even more invasive and difficult to treat with penicillin.", "solution": "We are told the wild-type strain carries plasmid pVir98 encoding three functions:\n- exfB: Exfoliative toxin B, a protease that cleaves desmoglein-1 in the superficial epidermis, causing epidermal splitting and peeling characteristic of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and bullous impetigo.\n- fnbA: Fibronectin-binding protein A, an adhesin that promotes tight binding to host fibronectin in extracellular matrix and on mucosal surfaces, enhancing colonization and invasion of wound sites.\n- blaZ: Beta-lactamase that hydrolyzes penicillin-class antibiotics, conferring penicillin resistance.\n\nCuring the plasmid removes these three gene products. The direct, multifaceted consequences are:\n1. Loss of exfoliative toxin B activity leads to loss of desmoglein-1 cleavage, so the strain will no longer cause the characteristic epidermal peeling or blistering phenotypes driven by exfoliative toxins.\n2. Loss of fibronectin-binding adhesin reduces the bacterium’s ability to adhere to fibronectin-rich tissues, decreasing colonization efficiency of wound sites and mucosal surfaces and likely reducing invasiveness. However, S. aureus retains numerous chromosomally encoded adhesins and virulence factors, so it can still cause infection, albeit less efficiently and often more localized and less severe.\n3. Loss of blaZ eliminates plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase, increasing susceptibility to penicillin-class antibiotics. This does not imply susceptibility to all antibiotics, only loss of the specific beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.\n\nEvaluate the answer choices:\n- A is incorrect because curing a virulence plasmid does not prevent growth in standard laboratory media; growth is governed by core metabolic genes on the chromosome. Loss of fnbA would not enhance, and may reduce, biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces.\n- B is incorrect because the strain will not be completely avirulent and unable to survive in a host; S. aureus has many other virulence factors. It also will not retain penicillin resistance after losing blaZ.\n- C is incorrect because saying it becomes highly susceptible to all antibiotics is overstated, and claiming skin blistering remains unchanged contradicts the loss of exfoliative toxin B.\n- D is consistent with the combined effects: reduced colonization of wound sites due to loss of fnbA, loss of epidermal peeling due to loss of exfB, and residual capacity to cause less severe, localized infections via other chromosomal virulence factors.\n- E is incorrect because while plasmid curing may slightly reduce metabolic burden, it would not make the strain more invasive; moreover, loss of blaZ would make it easier, not harder, to treat with penicillin.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate multifaceted consequence is described in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2084237"}, {"introduction": "The battle between pathogen and host can extend to the cellular level, with some of the most successful intracellular pathogens acting as master manipulators of the host's internal machinery.

It secretes a multi-functional effector protein, the Warburg-Inducing Factor (WIF), which orchestrates a profound reprogramming of host cell metabolism. Your task is to quantify the strategic advantage this confers to the pathogen.\n\n**Metabolic and Cellular Parameters:**\n\n*   **Standard ATP Yields:** In an uninhibited cell, the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose yields a specific amount of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). For your calculations, assume the following standard yields:\n    *   Glycolysis (glucose to 2 pyruvate): 2 net ATP and 2 NADH.\n    *   Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (pyruvate to acetyl-CoA): 1 NADH.\n    *   Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle (per acetyl-CoA): 1 GTP (energetically equivalent to 1 ATP), 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2.\n    *   Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS): 2.5 ATP per NADH and 1.5 ATP per FADH2. The malate-aspartate shuttle is active, so cytosolic NADH yields the same as mitochondrial NADH.\n\n*   **Infected State Model:** When a macrophage is infected with *M. perfidia* expressing WIF, the following changes occur:\n    1.  The cell's glucose uptake rate is stabilized at $1.80 \\times 10^3$ femtomoles per cell per hour.\n    2.  The WIF effector forces 90.0% of the pyruvate generated from glycolysis to be converted into lactate. The remaining 10.0% enters the mitochondria for further processing. Conversion of pyruvate to lactate consumes one NADH molecule.\n    3.  The WIF effector partially inhibits Complex I of the electron transport chain, reducing the ATP yield of each NADH molecule processed via OXPHOS to 1.5 ATP. The ATP yield from FADH2 remains unaffected at 1.5 ATP.\n    4.  For its own anabolism, *M. perfidia* siphons off 40.0% of the alpha-ketoglutarate produced within the host's TCA cycle.\n    5.  The pathogen co-opts 70.0% of the host cell's total net ATP production for its own replicative and metabolic needs.
