To assess the role of fomite transmission, a simple intervention study is conducted over a one-week period. The dormitory is divided into two identical wings, each housing a distinct population of students.\n\nIn the \"Control Wing,\" which houses 200 students, no special cleaning protocols are introduced beyond the standard daily custodial service.\n\nIn the \"Intervention Wing,\" which also houses 200 students, all common-area doorknobs are disinfected by a dedicated team on an hourly basis, from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily.\n\nAt the end of the one-week study period, data on new cases of Norovirus-G gastroenteritis is collected. In the Control Wing, 45 students developed the illness. In the Intervention Wing, 12 students developed the illness.\n\nAssuming the doorknob disinfection is the only significant difference in exposure between the two wings, calculate the relative risk of developing the illness for students in the Control Wing compared to those in the Intervention Wing.

The population consists of two strains: one carrying a specific antibiotic-resistance plasmid ($B_P$) and one that is plasmid-free and thus susceptible ($B_S$). The environment is free of antibiotics. The plasmid confers a fitness cost to its host bacteria, reducing their replication rate. Conversely, the plasmid can be transferred from a $B_P$ bacterium to a $B_S$ bacterium via conjugation. Plasmids can also be lost during cell division (segregational loss).\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of plasmid-carrying bacteria ($B_P$) in the total population.
