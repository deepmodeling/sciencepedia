They are studying a bacterial strain, *Implantibacillus adhaerens*, which is known for its highly hydrophobic cell surface. The team wants to quantify the difference in the bacterium's non-specific adherence to two materials submerged in a physiological buffer solution: a standard titanium alloy implant surface and the same surface modified with a hydrophilic polymer coating designed to repel bacteria.\n\nThe thermodynamic favorability of a bacterium's (b) adhesion to a substratum (s) while immersed in a liquid (l) can be described by the change in the Gibbs free energy of adhesion per unit area, $\\Delta G_{adh}$. This is given by the thermodynamic equation of state:\n$$ \\Delta G_{adh} = \\gamma_{bs} - \\gamma_{bl} - \\gamma_{sl} $$\nwhere $\\gamma_{xy}$ represents the interfacial free energy between phases x and y.

Here, the substratum 's' is 'titanium'.\n$$ \\Delta G_{adh,titanium} = \\gamma_{b,titanium} - \\gamma_{bl} - \\gamma_{titanium,l} $$\n\nNext, we write the specific expression for the adhesion to the hydrophilic coated surface ($\\Delta G_{adh,coat}$). Here, the substratum 's' is 'coat'.\n$$ \\Delta G_{adh,coat} = \\gamma_{b,coat} - \\gamma_{bl} - \\gamma_{coat,l} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the difference: $\\Delta G_{adh,titanium} - \\Delta G_{adh,coat}$.
