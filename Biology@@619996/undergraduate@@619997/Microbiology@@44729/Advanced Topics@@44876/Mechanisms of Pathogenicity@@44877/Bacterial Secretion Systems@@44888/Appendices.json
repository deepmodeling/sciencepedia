{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Bacterial proteins destined for export must first cross the inner membrane, and they typically use one of two major pathways: the Sec or the Tat system. This fundamental choice is not arbitrary; it depends critically on whether the protein must be exported unfolded (Sec) or folded (Tat). This exercise [@problem_id:2055689] explores the strict substrate requirements of these pathways by challenging you to predict the consequences of deliberately mis-targeting a protein, a classic thought experiment that reveals the 'rules' of protein translocation.", "problem": "An essential extracellular enzyme, \"Catalysin,\" produced by a species of bacterium, is known to fold into its stable, catalytically active tertiary structure immediately following translation in the cytoplasm. The native gene for Catalysin encodes an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the folded protein to the Twin-arginine Translocation (Tat) pathway for export across the cytoplasmic membrane.\n\nA research group creates a mutant strain of this bacterium by genetically modifying the gene for Catalysin. They precisely replace the DNA sequence encoding the native N-terminal Tat signal peptide with a DNA sequence that encodes a canonical N-terminal signal peptide for the General Secretory (Sec) pathway. The amino acid sequence of the mature Catalysin protein remains unaltered.\n\nAssuming the engineered Sec signal peptide is fully functional and recognized by the Sec machinery, which of the following outcomes is the most probable fate for the Catalysin protein synthesized in this mutant strain?\n\nA. Catalysin will be successfully unfolded by the Sec machinery and secreted into the periplasm, where it will refold into its active conformation.\nB. Catalysin will accumulate in the cytoplasm, as its folded structure will prevent its passage through the Sec translocon channel, potentially jamming the channel.\nC. The Sec signal peptide will be ignored, and the folded Catalysin protein will be secreted by the Tat pathway, which recognizes the protein's folded state as the primary targeting signal.\nD. The synthesis of Catalysin will be terminated prematurely during translation because the ribosome will stall upon encountering the non-native signal sequence.\nE. Catalysin will be secreted into the periplasm in a folded state through the Sec pathway, as the SecA motor protein will generate sufficient force to push the folded protein through the channel.", "solution": "We identify the two relevant export pathways and their substrate requirements:\n- The Tat pathway exports fully folded proteins. Targeting is specified by an N-terminal twin-arginine signal peptide. The translocase accommodates folded substrates and uses the proton motive force.\n- The Sec pathway exports polypeptides in an unfolded state through the SecYEG channel. Targeting is specified by an N-terminal Sec signal peptide. Substrates must be maintained in an unfolded conformation by factors such as SecB or SRP-mediated co-translational targeting. The SecA ATPase can push segments of an unfolded chain but does not function as a general unfoldase for stable globular domains. The Sec translocon pore is too narrow for folded domains.\n\nGiven:\n- Catalysin normally folds rapidly in the cytoplasm into its active conformation and is exported via Tat owing to its native Tat signal peptide.\n- The engineered mutant replaces the Tat signal peptide with a canonical Sec signal peptide; the mature Catalysin sequence is unchanged.\n- The Sec signal peptide is assumed fully functional and recognized by Sec machinery.\n\nLogical consequences:\n1) Removal of the Tat signal peptide abrogates Tat targeting; the Tat system does not recognize the folded state alone but requires the twin-arginine signal peptide. Hence Tat export will not occur, contradicting option C.\n2) With a Sec signal peptide, the protein is directed to the Sec pathway. However, the Sec system requires the substrate to be kept unfolded. Catalysin, by description, folds rapidly and stably in the cytoplasm. Without evolved features that allow Sec substrates to remain unfolded (e.g., appropriate SecB interaction motifs or SRP-dependent co-translational engagement tuned to prevent folding), Catalysin is likely to fold before or during attempted targeting.\n3) Once folded, the protein cannot be threaded through the narrow SecYEG pore, and SecA does not provide unfoldase activity capable of translocating a pre-folded globular enzyme. Therefore, Sec will not successfully translocate the folded Catalysin; this rules out option A (Sec machinery will unfold and secrete) and option E (SecA will push folded protein through).\n4) The presence of a functional Sec signal peptide will not cause ribosome stalling and premature termination; bacterial ribosomes routinely translate proteins with Sec signals. Hence option D is not supported.\n5) The most probable outcome is that Catalysin accumulates in the cytoplasm in a folded state. If it engages the Sec translocon while folded, it risks jamming the channel, a known consequence of mismatched substrate conformation for Sec.\n\nTherefore, the most probable fate is cytoplasmic accumulation with potential Sec translocon jamming, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2055689"}, {"introduction": "Secretion is often a multi-step journey. For many important proteins, such as toxins and enzymes, clearing the inner membrane is only the first step. This problem [@problem_id:2055692] focuses on the Type II Secretion System (T2SS), a molecular machine that pushes folded proteins from the periplasm to the outside world. By simulating a mutation in a key component of the T2SS outer membrane pore, this practice tests your ability to use pathway logic to pinpoint where a process will fail and where the substrate will accumulate.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the Type II Secretion System (T2SS) in the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*. This complex molecular machine is responsible for exporting fully folded proteins from the periplasm across the outer membrane to the extracellular environment. One of the primary proteins exported by this system is the Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB). In a wild-type bacterium, the CTB monomer is first translocated into the periplasm via the general secretory (Sec) pathway. In the periplasm, it folds and subsequently assembles with four other identical subunits to form a stable pentameric ring. This fully assembled, folded pentamer is then recognized by the T2SS and actively pushed through a large pore in the outer membrane.\n\nThis outer membrane pore, known as the secretin, is a multimeric complex constructed from multiple copies of the protein GspD. The microbiologist engineers a mutant strain of *V. cholerae* that carries a specific point mutation in the `gspD` gene. This mutation does not affect the synthesis of the GspD protein or its correct insertion into the outer membrane. However, it completely prevents the individual GspD protein monomers from assembling into the functional, ring-shaped secretin pore. All other cellular machinery, including the Sec pathway for inner membrane transport and all other components of the T2SS (such as the inner membrane platform and pseudopilus), are confirmed to be fully functional.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, where would the mature, assembled CTB pentamers be expected to predominantly accumulate in this mutant strain of *V. cholerae*?\n\nA. Evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and the periplasm.\nB. In the extracellular medium, as secretion would be unaffected.\nC. In the periplasm.\nD. In the cytoplasm, as unfolded monomers.\nE. Tightly bound to the non-assembled GspD monomers in the outer membrane.", "solution": "- In wild-type cells, CTB monomers are synthesized in the cytoplasm, translocated across the inner membrane into the periplasm by the Sec pathway, fold in the periplasm, assemble into pentamers, and are then secreted across the outer membrane by the T2SS through the GspD secretin pore.\n- In the mutant described, the Sec pathway and all T2SS components except the secretin pore remain functional. The specific mutation prevents GspD monomers from assembling into the multimeric secretin, so no functional outer membrane pore exists.\n- Consequently, CTB monomers will still be translocated into the periplasm and assemble into mature pentamers there (since folding and assembly occur in the periplasm), but the absence of the secretin pore blocks the final step of secretion across the outer membrane.\n- Therefore, the mature CTB pentamers will accumulate in the compartment immediately upstream of the blocked step, namely the periplasm.\n\nElimination of options:\n- A is incorrect because Sec transport is intact, so CTB leaves the cytoplasm and does not distribute evenly between cytoplasm and periplasm.\n- B is incorrect because secretion across the outer membrane requires the secretin pore, which is absent.\n- D is incorrect because monomers are translocated and fold/assemble in the periplasm, not retained unfolded in the cytoplasm.\n- E is unlikely because non-assembled GspD monomers do not form a functional substrate-binding translocation site; substrate recognition and passage require the assembled secretin complex.\n\nThus, CTB pentamers will predominantly accumulate in the periplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2055692"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists discover which proteins are secreted by a particular system?

The T2SS is a two-step process: first, proteins are translocated into the periplasm via the general secretory (Sec) or twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, and then a large multi-protein complex, the T2SS machinery, pushes them across the outer membrane into the extracellular environment.\n\nTo identify the proteins secreted by this system, the researcher constructs a mutant strain. This mutant strain has a specific deletion of the *gspD* gene, which encodes the outer membrane pore component (the secretin) of the T2SS. In this *ΔgspD* mutant, proteins destined for T2SS-mediated secretion are expected to be successfully transported into the periplasm but will be trapped there, unable to exit the cell.\n\nBoth the wild-type (WT) and the *ΔgspD* mutant strains were grown under identical conditions in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. The cultures were then fractionated to isolate proteins from two locations: the periplasm and the cell-free extracellular medium.

In a strain with a deletion of the secretin gene $gspD$, T2SS-mediated export across the outer membrane is blocked. Therefore, true T2SS substrates will show two characteristic changes when comparing wild-type (WT) to $\\Delta gspD$: they will accumulate in the periplasm of $\\Delta gspD$ relative to WT, and they will be reduced or absent in the extracellular medium of $\\Delta gspD$ relative to WT.\n\nApplying this logic protein-by-protein:\n\nLipA: In WT, extracellular medium is High while periplasm is Low, indicating efficient secretion. In $\\Delta gspD$, periplasm becomes High and extracellular medium becomes Not Detected. This matches the expected pattern for a T2SS substrate that requires GspD for export. Thus, LipA is a T2SS substrate.\n\nChitB: In WT, extracellular medium is High and periplasm is Low, indicating secretion. In $\\Delta gspD$, periplasm is High and extracellular medium is Not Detected. This again matches the T2SS substrate pattern. Thus, ChitB is a T2SS substrate.\n\nPhoC: In WT, periplasm is High and extracellular medium is Low. In $\\Delta gspD$, periplasm remains High and extracellular medium remains Low. There is no shift to periplasmic accumulation nor a loss from the extracellular fraction that would indicate dependence on T2SS. PhoC is not a T2SS substrate.\n\nSodD: In WT, periplasm is High and extracellular medium is Not Detected; in $\\Delta gspD$, the same pattern persists. This indicates a periplasmic protein not secreted by T2SS. SodD is not a T2SS substrate.\n\nHlyE: In WT, extracellular medium is High and periplasm is Not Detected. In $\\Delta gspD$, extracellular medium remains High and periplasm remains Not Detected. Persistent extracellular presence despite loss of GspD indicates secretion by a pathway independent of T2SS (e.g., another secretion system). HlyE is not a T2SS substrate.\n\nTherefore, the proteins that fit the T2SS substrate pattern are LipA and ChitB, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2055693"}]}
