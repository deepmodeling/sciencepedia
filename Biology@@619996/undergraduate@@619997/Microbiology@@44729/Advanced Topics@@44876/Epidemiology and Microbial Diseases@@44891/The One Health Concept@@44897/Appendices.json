A virus's ability to infect a new species often hinges on how well its surface proteins can bind to receptors on the host's cells. This exercise [@problem_id:2099782] explores how computational biology helps us predict this binding affinity, measured by the Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$), to assess zoonotic risk before a spillover event even occurs. By interpreting these energy values, you can identify which species might serve as dangerous intermediate or amplifying hosts.", "problem": "A novel paramyxovirus, designated Chiroptera Paramyxovirus-Tau (CPV-T), has been isolated from a population of fruit bats (*Pteropus alecto*). To assess its zoonotic potential under the One Health framework, a computational study was conducted. The study modeled the interaction between the viral Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein, which is responsible for host cell attachment, and its target receptor, the Ephrin-B2 protein. Using molecular docking simulations, the Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$) was calculated for the CPV-T HN protein with the Ephrin-B2 receptor orthologs from four species: the natural host (*Pteropus alecto*), and three potential spillover hosts: pigs (*Sus scrofa*), horses (*Equus caballus*), and humans (*Homo sapiens*). A more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ value indicates a stronger and more stable binding interaction, which is a critical prerequisite for successful cell entry and infection.\n\nThe calculated binding energies are as follows:\n-   **Bat** (*Pteropus alecto*): $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = -16.2$ kcal/mol\n-   **Pig** (*Sus scrofa*): $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = -15.8$ kcal/mol\n-   **Horse** (*Equus caballus*): $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = -10.5$ kcal/mol\n-   **Human** (*Homo sapiens*): $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = -12.1$ kcal/mol\n\nBased on these binding affinity predictions, which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment of the zoonotic risk posed by CPV-T?\n\nA. The virus poses an immediate and high risk for direct transmission from bats to humans, as the binding affinity is strong.\n\nB. The virus is highly species-specific to bats, and the binding affinities for all other tested species are too weak to support infection, indicating a negligible zoonotic risk.\n\nC. The primary zoonotic risk pathway involves pigs, which show a binding affinity nearly as high as the natural host, suggesting they could act as highly susceptible intermediate or amplifying hosts, thereby increasing the threat to human populations.\n\nD. The virus poses the greatest risk to the equine industry, as the binding affinity to the horse receptor is the most favorable among the potential spillover hosts.\n\nE. The binding affinities for pigs, horses, and humans are all comparable, suggesting the virus is a generalist with an equal and high probability of infecting all three species.", "solution": "Principle: For binding interactions, a more negative Gibbs free energy of binding indicates stronger affinity. Formally, stronger binding corresponds to more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$, and the affinity ratio between two interactions at the same temperature follows from $\\Delta G = -RT \\ln K_{\\text{assoc}}$, which implies\n$$\n\\frac{K_{\\text{assoc,2}}}{K_{\\text{assoc,1}}}=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{2}-\\Delta G_{1}}{RT}\\right).\n$$\nThus, small differences in $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ yield modest changes in affinity, whereas differences of several kilocalories per mole imply large changes.\n\nGiven values:\n- Bat: $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}=-16.2$ kcal/mol\n- Pig: $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}=-15.8$ kcal/mol\n- Human: $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}=-12.1$ kcal/mol\n- Horse: $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}=-10.5$ kcal/mol\n\nOrdering by strength (most negative to least negative) is\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{bat}}<\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{pig}}<\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{human}}<\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{horse}}.\n$$\nThe pig is very close to the bat, with a difference of $0.4$ kcal/mol, indicating an affinity nearly comparable to the natural host. In contrast, the human and horse interactions are substantially weaker than pig, with differences of $3.7$ and $5.3$ kcal/mol relative to pig, respectively; by the exponential relation above, such multi–kilocalorie differences imply much lower affinity.\n\nEvaluate statements:\n- A is not supported: although human binding is negative, it is markedly weaker than pig and bat, and docking alone does not justify an “immediate and high” direct bat-to-human risk.\n- B is false: pig binding is only slightly weaker than bat, contradicting species specificity to bats.\n- C is supported: pigs show binding nearly as strong as the bat, consistent with a plausible intermediate or amplifying host pathway that could elevate spillover risk to humans.\n- D is false: horses have the least favorable binding among the spillover hosts.\n- E is false: the affinities are not comparable; pig is much stronger than human and horse.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that pigs represent the primary zoonotic risk pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2099782"}, {"introduction": "When a zoonotic outbreak occurs, a critical question for public health and veterinary officials is: where did it come from? Genomic epidemiology provides powerful tools to reconstruct transmission pathways by treating the pathogen's genome as a molecular clock. As a pathogen jumps between hosts, its genetic sequence accumulates small changes (SNPs), allowing us to trace its history. This practice [@problem_id:2099778] puts you in the role of a molecular detective, using genetic distance data and a Phylogenetic Consistency Index ($PCI$) to trace a hypervirulent pathogen from its environmental source to animal and human populations.", "problem": "In the context of the One Health initiative, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, genomic epidemiology is a critical tool for tracing zoonotic disease outbreaks. An investigation is underway into a concurrent outbreak of a hypervirulent strain of *Clostridioides difficile* affecting human patients in several hospitals and pig populations at regional swine farms. The primary hypothesis is that the pathogen was introduced into the swine population via contaminated animal feed from one of three international suppliers (Supplier A, Supplier B, or Supplier C) and subsequently transmitted to humans.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, shotgun metagenomics was used to reconstruct pathogen gene sequences from the three feed sources, and whole-genome sequencing was performed on isolates from the affected swine (S) and human (H) populations. The average genetic distance, $d(X, Y)$, between any two populations $X$ and $Y$ is quantified by the mean number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per kilobase across a consistent panel of core virulence genes.\n\nA key assumption of the transmission model $F_i \\to S \\to H$ (where $F_i$ is a feed supplier) is that genetic divergence is additive along the transmission path. The most plausible source is therefore the one whose genetic distances best fit the relationship $d(F_i, H) \\approx d(F_i, S) + d(S, H)$. To quantify this, investigators have defined a Phylogenetic Consistency Index (PCI) for each supplier $F_i$:\n$$PCI(F_i) = \\frac{1000}{1 + (d(F_i, H) - (d(F_i, S) + d(S, H)))^2}$$\nA higher PCI value indicates a more consistent phylogenetic link and a more probable source.\n\nGiven the following genetic distance data, identify the most probable source supplier by calculating its PCI.\n\n| Pair of Populations | Genetic Distance $d(X, Y)$ (SNPs/kb) |\n|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------:|\n| Swine (S) - Human (H) | 12.3                                 |\n| Supplier A - Swine (S)  | 8.1                                  |\n| Supplier B - Swine (S)  | 15.2                                 |\n| Supplier C - Swine (S)  | 6.4                                  |\n| Supplier A - Human (H)  | 20.8                                 |\n| Supplier B - Human (H)  | 29.1                                 |\n| Supplier C - Human (H)  | 25.0                                 |\n\nCalculate the PCI for the most probable source supplier.
