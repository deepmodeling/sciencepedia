{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental task in any outbreak investigation is to measure the immediate impact of an exposure on a defined population. The attack rate is a crucial metric for this purpose, representing the proportion of at-risk individuals who develop an illness following a common exposure. This exercise provides a classic scenario to practice calculating this essential value, which serves as a cornerstone of field epidemiology [@problem_id:2101972].", "problem": "A large community potluck was held to celebrate the beginning of summer. A total of 140 people attended the event. Within 48 hours following the potluck, the local public health department received numerous reports of illness. An investigation determined that 49 of the attendees had developed symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. For the purpose of this analysis, all attendees are considered to have been part of the population at risk.\n\nCalculate the overall attack rate for this outbreak. The attack rate in epidemiology measures the proportion of an exposed population that develops a disease. Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The attack rate is defined as the proportion of the population at risk that develops the disease. Using the standard epidemiological formula:\n$$\n\\text{Attack rate} = \\frac{\\text{number of new cases}}{\\text{population at risk}}\n$$\nHere, the number of new cases is $49$ and the population at risk is $140$, so:\n$$\n\\text{Attack rate} = \\frac{49}{140}\n$$\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by $7$:\n$$\n\\frac{49}{140} = \\frac{7}{20}\n$$\nConvert to a decimal:\n$$\n\\frac{7}{20} = 0.35\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $0.35$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.35}$$", "id": "2101972"}, {"introduction": "Epidemiologists must distinguish between the total burden of a disease at a single moment and the rate at which new cases are appearing. This problem will help you master the key difference between point prevalence, a snapshot of existing cases, and cumulative incidence, a measure of new disease risk over time [@problem_id:2101941]. Understanding how to calculate and interpret both metrics is critical for monitoring chronic conditions and tracking the dynamic progression of an epidemic.", "problem": "An epidemiological study is conducted on a stable population of 500 researchers at a remote Arctic research station to track a non-lethal, chronic fungal skin infection caused by *Psychrotropha dermis*. On January 1st (Day 1), a station-wide screening finds that 25 researchers have the active infection. Over the next 365 days, medical records show that 10 researchers who were infection-free on Day 1 develop new cases of the infection. During this same year-long period, a new topical treatment becomes available, and 5 of the original 25 patients are successfully cured, and 2 of the 10 new patients are also cured. Assume the total population of the station remains constant at 500, with no deaths or personnel changes.\n\nCalculate the following three metrics:\n1. The point prevalence of the infection on Day 1.\n2. The cumulative incidence of the infection over the 365-day period.\n3.

Among the household contacts of the 200 index cases, a total of 155 individuals were vaccinated and an additional 45 had confirmed prior immunity from a recent infection.\n\nOver the follow-up period, new symptomatic cases were recorded among the household contacts. A case is classified as a 'secondary case' if their symptom onset occurred more than 24 hours but no more than 7 days after the symptom onset of their household's index case. Cases with symptom onset within 24 hours of the index case are considered co-primary cases. In total, 132 new symptomatic cases were detected among all household contacts during the study.
