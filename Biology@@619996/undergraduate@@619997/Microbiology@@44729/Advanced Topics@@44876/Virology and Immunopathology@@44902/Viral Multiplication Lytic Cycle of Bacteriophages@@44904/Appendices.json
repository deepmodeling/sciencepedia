This exercise provides a hands-on way to understand how virologists quantify this fundamental parameter.

The experiment begins with a well-mixed liquid culture of *E. coli* in a flask with a volume of $50.0$ mL. The initial concentration of bacteria is $C_B = 3.0 \\times 10^8$ cells/mL, a quantity considered vast enough that host availability is not a limiting factor for the duration of the experiment.\n\nAt time $t=0$, a stock of T-Prime phage is introduced into the culture, resulting in an initial phage concentration of $P_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^4$ plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL.\n\nThe following has been determined about the T-Prime lytic cycle:\n- The time from phage infection to host cell lysis, known as the latent period, is exactly $T_L = 30$ minutes.\n- At the beginning of each infectious cycle, it is observed that $90\\%$ of the available phages successfully adsorb to and infect a unique host cell nearly instantaneously. The remaining $10\\%$ fail to infect.\n- The experiment is run for a total time of $t_{total} = 60$ minutes. At this point, the reaction is stopped, and the final concentration of free phage particles in the culture is measured to be $P_{final} = 1.825201 \\times 10^8$ PFU/mL.\n\nAssuming that all infected cells from a given generation of infection lyse simultaneously at the end of their latent period, calculate the average burst size, $B$, for the T-Prime phage. The burst size is defined as the number of new phage particles released from a single infected bacterium.\n\nProvide your answer as an integer.", "solution": "The culture is well mixed with host in great excess, so every phage that adsorbs finds a unique host, and adsorption at the start of a cycle is instantaneous. Let $p=0.9$ be the adsorption fraction per cycle and $q=0.1$ the non-adsorbing fraction. Let $P_{0}$ be the initial free phage concentration per mL and $B$ the burst size.\n\nAt $t=0$, the first adsorption event occurs:\n$$\nI_{1}=pP_{0},\\quad F_{0}=qP_{0},\n$$\nwhere $I_{1}$ is the number of cells infected in cycle 1 and $F_{0}$ is the free phage remaining after adsorption.\n\nAfter one latent period ($t=30$ minutes), the $I_{1}$ infected cells lyse, releasing $B I_{1}$ phages.

This conceptual problem explores the critical link between host physiology and the success of the lytic cycle. By considering an infection in metabolically dormant, stationary-phase bacteria [@problem_id:2104685], you will develop a deeper appreciation for why a healthy, active host is essential for producing new phage progeny.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the infection dynamics of the strictly lytic bacteriophage T4 on its host, *Escherichia coli*. The T4 bacteriophage relies on the host cell's machinery and resources to replicate. The lytic cycle is characterized by the injection of phage genetic material, followed by the synthesis of phage components, assembly of new virions, and finally lysis (rupture) of the host cell to release the progeny.\n\nThe experiment compares two populations of *E. coli*:\n1.  A culture in the exponential (logarithmic) growth phase, characterized by rapid cell division and high metabolic activity.\n2.  A culture in the late stationary phase, where cell growth has ceased due to nutrient depletion. Cells in this phase have a significantly reduced metabolic rate and possess very limited intracellular pools of biosynthetic precursors, such as amino acids, nucleotides, and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nA high multiplicity of infection is used for both cultures, ensuring that nearly all bacterial cells are infected by at least one T4 phage. Based on your understanding of the bacteriophage lytic cycle and bacterial physiology, what is the most likely outcome for the *E. coli* cells in the stationary-phase culture after the T4 phages have injected their genetic material?\n\nA. The phage will complete the lytic cycle, but at a much slower rate and with a significantly smaller burst size compared to the exponential-phase culture.\n\nB. The phage will fail to productively infect the cells because changes in the stationary-phase cell envelope prevent the initial attachment or injection of genetic material.\n\nC. The phage, unable to replicate lytically, will integrate its genome into the host chromosome and enter a lysogenic state, becoming a dormant prophage.\n\nD. The lytic cycle will be arrested after the injection of the phage genome; synthesis of new phage components will not occur, resulting in a non-productive infection where the host cell does not lyse.\n\nE. The injection of foreign DNA into the metabolically stressed stationary-phase cells will cause immediate structural failure of the cell envelope, leading to premature lysis without the production of any new virions.", "solution": "We identify the key constraints of the scenario and evaluate the options using established principles of bacteriophage biology and bacterial physiology.\n\nFirst, with a high multiplicity of infection, adsorption and genome injection will occur in nearly all cells. Thus, the primary bottleneck will not be reaching the cytoplasm but what happens after the phage genome enters the cell.\n\nSecond, T4 is a strictly lytic bacteriophage. It does not possess a lysogenic program and does not integrate as a prophage. Therefore, any option that invokes lysogeny is inconsistent with T4 biology. This eliminates option C.\n\nThird, we consider the possibility that stationary-phase cell envelope changes prevent attachment or injection. While stationary-phase cells can alter envelope composition and receptor availability, such changes are not absolute. With high multiplicity of infection and the known ability of T4 to bind to its receptors on many E. coli strains even outside exponential growth, complete prevention of attachment/injection is unlikely to be the dominant outcome. Therefore, option B is less likely than intracellular arrest.\n\nFourth, the lytic cycle after injection requires:\n- Transcription of early phage genes by host RNA polymerase (often modified by phage factors) and translation by host ribosomes, which demands ATP and GTP.\n- Phage DNA replication, which requires dNTP pools and energy.\n- Translation of structural proteins and assembly, requiring amino acids and ATP/GTP.\n- Expression of lysis functions (e.g., endolysins/hydrolases), which also requires transcription and translation.\n\nIn late stationary-phase cells, intracellular pools of ATP, amino acids, and nucleotides are severely limited. The stringent response suppresses ribosomal RNA synthesis and global translation, and overall metabolic flux is greatly reduced. Even though T4 encodes factors to redirect host machinery and can degrade host DNA to liberate nucleotides, the strong energy and precursor limitations in late stationary phase impede transcription, translation, and DNA replication to the extent that productive phage synthesis does not occur. Without synthesis of lysis proteins, programmed lysis will not proceed.\n\nFifth, we consider whether a slower, reduced-yield lytic cycle could still occur. In mildly nutrient-limited or slow-growth conditions, some phages do complete infection with longer latent periods and smaller burst sizes. However, the problem specifies late stationary phase with “very limited” pools of precursors and ATP, indicating a regime where macromolecular synthesis is largely arrested. Under such conditions, T4 infections are commonly non-productive until nutrients are restored. Thus, option A is less consistent with the described metabolic state.\n\nSixth, we examine whether injection itself could cause immediate structural failure (lysis from without). True lysis from without typically requires extremely high numbers of adsorbed phages causing mechanical damage or overwhelming cell wall–degrading activities, and it is not a general consequence of genome injection per se. The problem statement does not indicate such an extreme condition, and immediate lysis without virion production is not the expected outcome for T4 solely due to injection into metabolically stressed cells. Thus, option E is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the lytic cycle arrests after genome injection due to insufficient energy and precursors for transcription, translation, and replication, with no production of new virions and no lysis. This corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2104685"}, {"introduction": "The lytic cycle culminates in a dramatic final step: the destruction of the host cell to release new virions. This success hinges on specific molecular machinery, such as enzymes that target the cell wall. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2104650] challenges you to predict the outcome when a phage's lytic enzyme has no target in a specialized host, linking a specific molecular mechanism to the macroscopic observation of plaque formation and reinforcing the concept of biological specificity.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a newly isolated bacteriophage, designated Phage P1, which is known to be strictly lytic. Detailed analysis reveals that its life cycle culminates in the production of an endolysin, an enzyme whose sole function is to hydrolyze the peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall, thereby inducing host cell lysis and releasing progeny virions. The receptor for Phage P1 is a protein located on the host's cell membrane.\n\nFor an experiment, the microbiologist uses a stable L-form strain of *Bacillus subtilis*. This strain completely lacks a peptidoglycan cell wall but retains a functional cell membrane and all the necessary intracellular machinery for viral replication. The L-form bacteria are capable of growing in a suitable osmotic-stabilized medium.\n\nThe microbiologist performs a standard soft-agar overlay plaque assay. A sample of Phage P1 is mixed with the L-form *B. subtilis* culture and plated. For comparison, a control plate is also prepared using wild-type *B. subtilis*, which has a normal peptidoglycan cell wall. After appropriate incubation, the control plate shows large, clear plaques.\n\nBased on the properties of Phage P1 and the L-form host, which of the following outcomes is expected for the experimental plate with the L-form bacteria?\n\nA. Large, clear plaques and a high resulting phage titer, similar to the control.\n\nB. Small, turbid plaques and a low but measurable phage titer.\n\nC. No visible plaques and a measured phage titer of effectively zero Plaque-Forming Units (PFU)/mL.\n\nD. The L-form bacteria will be entirely resistant to infection, resulting in a confluent lawn of bacteria with no plaques.\n\nE. The phage will enter a lysogenic cycle, leading to the formation of turbid plaques as some bacteria survive.", "solution": "The phage described, Phage P1, is strictly lytic and relies on an endolysin whose sole function is to hydrolyze peptidoglycan to trigger host cell lysis and release of progeny virions. In a typical lytic cycle in Gram-positive bacteria, holins form lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane to allow endolysin to access and degrade the peptidoglycan; the resulting loss of cell wall integrity produces osmotic lysis and releases mature phage particles, permitting plaque formation in a soft-agar overlay.\n\nIn the experimental condition, the host is a stable L-form of Bacillus subtilis that lacks peptidoglycan but retains a functional cell membrane and intracellular replication machinery. Because the receptor for Phage P1 is a protein on the cell membrane, adsorption and genome injection should proceed, and intracellular replication and assembly can, in principle, occur. However, the programmed lysis mechanism is specifically dependent on endolysin activity on peptidoglycan. In L-forms, there is no peptidoglycan substrate for endolysin; thus, the canonical endolysin-mediated lysis step cannot proceed. Although holins can depolarize the membrane, their pores are not expected to suffice for efficient release of large virions, and without peptidoglycan hydrolysis there is no effective lytic rupture of the cell to liberate progeny.\n\nPlaque formation in a soft-agar overlay requires cycles of infection, lysis, and diffusion of progeny to neighboring cells. If progeny are not released, no secondary infections occur and no visible plaques form. Furthermore, because plaque-forming units are defined by the ability to produce plaques on the lawn, the measured phage titer under these conditions would be effectively zero PFU per mL, even if intracellular replication occurred without release.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is incorrect because efficient lysis and release are not possible without peptidoglycan.\n- B is incorrect because partial lysis sufficient to form plaques is not expected when the lysis enzyme has no substrate.\n- D is incorrect because the bacteria are not resistant to infection; adsorption and injection can occur via the membrane receptor, but release fails.\n- E is incorrect because the phage is strictly lytic and does not undergo lysogeny.\n\nThe expected outcome is no visible plaques with an effectively zero PFU per mL titer.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2104650"}]}
