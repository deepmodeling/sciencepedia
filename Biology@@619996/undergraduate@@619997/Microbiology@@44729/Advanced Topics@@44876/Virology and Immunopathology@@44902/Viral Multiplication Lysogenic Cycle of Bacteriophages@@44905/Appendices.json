This first practice challenges you to work like a microbiologist, analyzing the outcome of an experiment to deduce the hidden state of a bacterial culture. By connecting an external stimulus like UV light to a dramatic, population-wide event like synchronized lysis, you will reinforce your understanding of prophage induction and the bacterial SOS response [@problem_id:2104481].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying a specific strain of *Escherichia coli*. The bacterial culture grows normally in a nutrient-rich medium, doubling at a predictable rate. For an experiment, the culture is briefly exposed to an intense pulse of ultraviolet (UV) light, a known DNA-damaging agent. Shortly after this exposure, a massive and synchronized lysis of the bacterial cells is observed throughout the culture, releasing a high concentration of bacteriophage particles into the medium.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the state of the *E. coli* cells *before* their exposure to the UV light?\n\nA. The cells were actively infected with a bacteriophage undergoing the lytic cycle.\nB. The cells were lysogenic, carrying a dormant prophage within their genome.\nC. The cells were undergoing transformation by absorbing DNA from their environment.\nD. The cells were hosts for a phage that was exclusively capable of generalized transduction.\nE. The cells were experiencing plasmid curing due to the stress of the experimental conditions.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biological principles governing bacteriophage lifecycles and bacterial responses to DNA damage:\n\n1. Temperate bacteriophages can exist in two states in bacterial hosts:\n   - Lytic cycle: The phage replicates, commandeers host machinery, and lyses the cell relatively soon after infection, releasing progeny phage.\n   - Lysogenic cycle: The phage genome is integrated into the bacterial chromosome (as a prophage) or maintained in a stable dormant form, with expression repressed by phage-encoded repressors. The host grows and divides, carrying the prophage.\n\n2. Induction of a prophage occurs when DNA damage activates the bacterial SOS response. UV light is a classic DNA-damaging agent that activates RecA, which promotes autocleavage of phage repressors (e.g., the cI repressor of phage lambda). Loss of repression switches the prophage from lysogeny to the lytic program, leading to phage replication and subsequent host cell lysis.\n\n3. A synchronized, massive lysis shortly after UV exposure across a culture implies that many cells simultaneously transitioned into the lytic cycle due to a common trigger (UV-induced DNA damage). This pattern is characteristic of prophage induction in lysogenic populations, not of ongoing lytic infections. In an actively lytic infection without an external synchronizing event, lysis would be staggered over time rather than synchronized, and would not specifically require UV exposure for timing.\n\n4. Evaluating the options:\n   - A (actively lytic): Inconsistent with the need for UV exposure to precipitate synchronized lysis; lysis would already be occurring and not necessarily synchronized across the population.\n   - B (lysogenic with a dormant prophage): Consistent with UV-induced SOS activation, repressor inactivation, prophage induction, and synchronized lysis with release of high phage titers.\n   - C (transformation): Uptake of environmental DNA does not explain massive phage release.\n   - D (exclusively capable of generalized transduction): Generalized transduction relates to packaging errors during lytic growth and does not explain UV-triggered synchronized induction; moreover, “exclusively capable” is not a defining pre-exposure state and is orthogonal to the observation.\n   - E (plasmid curing): Not causally linked to sudden high-level phage release and synchronized lysis.\n\nTherefore, the pre-exposure state most consistent with the observations is lysogeny with a dormant prophage that is inducible by UV-mediated DNA damage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2104481"}, {"introduction": "Having established the concept of induction, we now probe the molecular machinery that governs it. This exercise presents a genetic puzzle involving a specific mutation that renders the prophage 'uninducible.' By predicting the fate of this special lysogen, you will explore the critical role of the $cI$ repressor and its interaction with the host's $RecA$ protein, revealing the precise nature of the molecular switch that controls the phage's decision to remain dormant or enter the lytic cycle [@problem_id:2104506].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying a strain of *Escherichia coli* that is lysogenic for a mutant bacteriophage, designated `λ cI(Ind-)`. In a normal lysogenic state, a repressor protein, cI, is produced by the integrated viral genome (the prophage) to suppress the phage's lytic cycle genes, thereby maintaining latency. The host bacterium's SOS response, a global response to DNA damage, is typically initiated by the protein RecA. In its activated form (RecA*), RecA mediates the cleavage of the cI repressor, leading to prophage induction and entry into the lytic cycle. The specific mutation in `λ cI(Ind-)` renders its cI repressor protein completely resistant to cleavage by the host's RecA* protein, although the repressor still functions perfectly to maintain the lysogenic state under normal conditions.\n\nThe microbiologist subjects a liquid culture of these `E. coli(λ cI(Ind-))` lysogens to a high dose of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a potent inducer of the SOS response. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome for the bacterial culture?\n\nA. The bacteria will activate their SOS response, but the prophage will fail to be induced into the lytic cycle. The host cells will eventually die from the extensive DNA damage, without producing new phage particles.\nB. The prophage will be induced immediately upon activation of the SOS response, leading to the rapid synthesis of new phage particles and lysis of the bacterial population.\nC. The mutation in the cI protein will confer a survival advantage, as the uninducible prophage will protect the host cell from the detrimental effects of the UV-induced SOS response.\nD. The mutation in the phage's cI repressor will interfere with the host's cellular machinery, completely preventing the activation of the RecA protein and the initiation of the SOS response.\nE. The cI repressor will successfully prevent lytic cycle gene expression, but the prophage will still be excised from the host chromosome and will persist as a dormant, non-replicating plasmid within the cell.", "solution": "Principle of lysogeny and induction in bacteriophage lambda: In a lysogen, the phage-encoded cI repressor binds operator sites to repress early lytic promoters (notably $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$), maintaining the prophage in the integrated, quiescent state. Upon host DNA damage, the SOS response activates RecA to its coprotease form (RecA*). RecA* stimulates autocleavage of cI, reducing functional repressor levels, derepressing $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$, and initiating expression of lytic genes including those required for excision (integrase and excisionase) and lytic development (e.g., Q). This yields prophage induction, excision from the chromosome, phage DNA replication, assembly, and host lysis.\n\nDefinition of the mutation: In the mutant phage $\\lambda$ cI(Ind-), the cI protein is fully functional for repression under normal conditions but is resistant to RecA*-mediated cleavage. Therefore, even when RecA is activated by SOS, cI remains uncleaved and continues to repress $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$.\n\nEffect of UV on the host: A high UV dose causes extensive DNA damage, robustly activating the SOS response. RecA is activated to RecA*, enabling SOS functions such as error-prone repair and cleavage of other repressors (e.g., LexA). However, due to the cI(Ind-) mutation, RecA* cannot cleave cI; thus, cI levels remain sufficient to repress lytic promoters.\n\nConsequences for the prophage: Because cI repression persists, early lytic transcription remains off, so excision genes (including excisionase, xis) and lytic regulators (such as Q) are not expressed. Therefore, the prophage is not induced, does not excise, and does not enter lytic replication or produce phage particles.\n\nConsequences for the host cells: The host SOS response proceeds independently of the phage cI mutation. At a high UV dose, DNA damage may exceed repair capacity, leading to replication failure and cell death. Since the prophage was not induced, death occurs without phage production.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Correct. SOS is activated; prophage fails to induce due to non-cleavable cI; cells die from damage without producing phage.\n- B: Incorrect. Induction requires cI cleavage, which cannot occur with cI(Ind-).\n- C: Incorrect. The mutation does not protect against SOS damage; it removes the phage’s ability to exit via lysis and does not mitigate host DNA damage.\n- D: Incorrect. The phage cI mutation does not block host RecA activation or SOS initiation.\n- E: Incorrect. Excision requires derepression of lytic promoters and expression of xis; with cI repression intact, excision does not occur, and lambda does not persist as a dormant plasmid under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate outcome is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2104506"}, {"introduction": "The lysogenic cycle is not just a survival strategy for phages; it is a major driver of bacterial evolution through a process called specialized transduction.
