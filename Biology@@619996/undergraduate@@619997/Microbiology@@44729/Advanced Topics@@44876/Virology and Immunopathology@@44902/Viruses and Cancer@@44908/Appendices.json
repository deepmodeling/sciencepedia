{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Some viruses can cause cancer by inserting their genetic material directly into our genome, sometimes with dramatic consequences. This practice explores a mechanism called \"insertional mutagenesis,\" where powerful viral gene promoters, known as Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs), accidentally activate a dormant host proto-oncogene. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario involving the `$myc$` gene, you will gain insight into how a retroviral integration can hotwire a cell's growth circuitry, leading to uncontrolled proliferation [@problem_id:2105338].", "problem": "Retroviruses are a class of viruses that replicate through a ribonucleic acid (RNA) intermediate, using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to produce a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy of their genome. This DNA copy, known as a provirus, can then integrate into the host cell's chromosome. This integration is mediated by sequences at the ends of the provirus called Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs). Crucially, these LTRs contain powerful promoter and enhancer sequences that normally drive the transcription of the viral genes.\n\nA molecular biologist is studying a patient's B-cell lymphoma. Upon sequencing the genome of the cancerous cells, she discovers that a complete retroviral provirus has integrated into a chromosome. The integration site is located approximately 1,200 base pairs upstream (in the 5' direction) of the transcriptional start site for the `$myc$` proto-oncogene. The `$myc$` gene encodes a transcription factor that is a key positive regulator of cell division and growth.\n\nBased on the known mechanisms of retroviral-induced oncogenesis, which of the following is the most likely and immediate consequence of this specific integration event on the `$myc$` gene in these lymphoma cells?\n\nA. The expression of `$myc$` will be silenced due to methylation spreading from the integrated provirus.\n\nB. A fusion protein will be produced, consisting of a viral protein segment and a portion of the Myc protein.\n\nC. The expression level of the `$myc$` gene will not be significantly altered, as the provirus did not integrate into its coding sequence.\n\nD. The transcription of the `$myc$` gene will be constitutively activated to a high level, independent of the cell's normal regulatory signals.\n\nE. The `$myc$` gene will be deleted from the genome as an error during the viral integration process.", "solution": "We analyze the biological mechanism of retroviral insertional mutagenesis. A complete retroviral provirus contains Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) at both ends. Each LTR comprises strong promoter and enhancer elements (largely in the U3 region) that can act in cis to drive transcription. When a provirus integrates near a host gene, two primary activation mechanisms are possible:\n- Enhancer insertion: LTR enhancer elements act over kilobase distances to increase transcription from the host gene’s native promoter, independent of normal regulatory controls, and typically independent of orientation.\n- Promoter insertion: If the LTR is upstream and in a permissive orientation, the LTR promoter can initiate transcription into the downstream cellular gene.\n\nGiven that the provirus is integrated approximately 1,200 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site of the $myc$ proto-oncogene, this distance is well within the effective range for enhancer action and compatible with promoter insertion. This scenario is a classic mechanism for retroviral oncogenesis, exemplified by avian leukosis virus activation of $c$-$myc$, leading to constitutively elevated $myc$ transcription. Because Myc is a transcription factor that positively regulates cell growth and division, constitutive activation drives oncogenic proliferation.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- Option D best matches the known mechanism: LTR promoter/enhancer elements cause constitutive, high-level transcription of $myc$ that is uncoupled from the cell’s normal regulatory signals.\n- Option A is unlikely as an immediate consequence; while proviruses can be epigenetically silenced over time, LTRs are initially strong transcriptional drivers, and methylation spreading to silence a nearby proto-oncogene is not the canonical, immediate outcome leading to lymphoma.\n- Option B requires integration within the coding region to generate a chimeric open reading frame; the integration is upstream of the transcriptional start site, so a viral-host fusion protein is not expected.\n- Option C is incorrect because insertional activation does not require disruption of the coding sequence; enhancer or promoter insertion upstream can markedly increase expression.\n- Option E is not a typical outcome of integrase-mediated integration; integrase inserts the provirus into the genome without wholesale deletion of the target gene.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and immediate consequence is constitutive activation of $myc$ transcription due to LTR-driven enhancer/promoter effects.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2105338"}, {"introduction": "Viral oncogenesis is not always about mutating the host's DNA. This exercise challenges you to think beyond genetic mutations and consider how viruses can operate at the protein level. By reconciling the presence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) with a perfectly normal, wild-type `$TP53$` tumor suppressor gene, you will uncover the sophisticated strategy of protein-level sabotage, where the viral oncoprotein E6 targets the p53 protein for destruction [@problem_id:2105292].", "problem": "A pathologist is analyzing a biopsy sample from a cervical tumor. Molecular analysis confirms the integration of DNA from Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16), a high-risk virus strongly associated with cervical cancer. To further characterize the tumor, the pathologist sequences the patient's *TP53* gene, which encodes the crucial tumor suppressor protein p53. Surprisingly, the sequencing results show that the *TP53* gene is wild-type, meaning it contains no mutations. This presents an apparent contradiction, as the oncogenic activity of HPV-16 is known to involve the disruption of the p53 pathway.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for how HPV-16 is contributing to cancer in this patient, despite the presence of a wild-type *TP53* gene?\n\nA. The HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein targets the p53 protein for degradation, thus eliminating its function at the protein level.\n\nB. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein binds to and mutates the *TP53* gene, leading to the production of a non-functional p53 protein.\n\nC. The presence of HPV-16 DNA is merely incidental; the cancer must have been caused by mutations in other tumor suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma (*RB1*) gene.\n\nD. The HPV-16 virus integrates into the promoter region of the *TP53* gene, blocking its transcription, which is why the protein is absent but the gene's coding sequence appears normal.\n\nE. The wild-type *TP53* gene is producing a stable p53 protein, but the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein binds directly to the DNA-binding domain of p53, preventing it from activating its target genes.", "solution": "The key observation is that the patient’s TP53 gene is wild-type, yet the tumor exhibits HPV-16 integration, a hallmark of HPV-driven carcinogenesis. High-risk HPV-16 promotes oncogenesis primarily through the actions of its E6 and E7 oncoproteins at the protein level rather than by mutating host tumor suppressor genes.\n\nThe relevant molecular mechanisms are:\n- HPV-16 E6 binds p53 and recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E6-AP/UBE3A), promoting ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of p53. This leads to loss of p53 function despite an intact TP53 coding sequence. Thus, p53 pathway inactivation occurs post-translationally.\n- HPV-16 E7 binds the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), releasing E2F transcription factors and driving cell cycle progression. E7 does not mutate TP53.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A accurately states that E6 targets p53 for degradation, eliminating its function at the protein level despite a wild-type gene. This is the canonical mechanism in HPV-driven cancers.\n- Option B is incorrect: E7 does not mutate TP53, and HPV oncoproteins act at the protein level, not by introducing host gene mutations.\n- Option C is incorrect: the presence of HPV-16 is not incidental; HPV-16 E6/E7 are causally implicated, and TP53 need not be mutated when E6 degrades p53.\n- Option D is inaccurate as a general explanation: HPV integration sites are variable, and the hallmark effect is upregulation of E6/E7 due to disruption of viral E2, not consistent integration into the TP53 promoter. Moreover, TP53 coding sequence being normal does not imply promoter blockade, and the primary mechanism is protein degradation rather than transcriptional silencing of TP53.\n- Option E is less accurate: while E6 can interfere with p53-mediated transactivation via effects on cofactors, the defining and most accurate mechanism is ubiquitin-mediated degradation; furthermore, stating the p53 protein is stable contradicts E6’s principal activity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate molecular explanation is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2105292"}, {"introduction": "Once a virus initiates transformation, is its presence still required to maintain the cancerous state? This practice moves from understanding mechanisms to experimental design, introducing the critical concepts of \"hit-and-run\" oncogenesis versus \"oncogene addiction.\" By working through a thought experiment involving a temperature-sensitive viral oncoprotein, you'll learn how scientists can prove that a cancer cell is dependent on a viral protein for its survival, a principle that forms the basis for many targeted therapies [@problem_id:2105324].", "problem": "A virologist is studying a newly discovered DNA virus, designated \"Novavirus,\" for its oncogenic potential. They have successfully created a stable fibroblast cell line, NV-F-C1, which is transformed by the virus. These cells have lost contact inhibition and grow in multilayered clusters known as foci. The transformation is mediated by a single viral protein, Onco-N.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism of transformation, the virologist engineers a special strain of Novavirus that expresses a temperature-sensitive (ts) version of the oncoprotein, called Onco-N-ts. This mutant protein is fully functional at a permissive temperature of 32.0 °C but denatures and becomes inactive at a non-permissive temperature of 39.0 °C.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where NV-F-C1 cells containing the Onco-N-ts gene are plated and cultured at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C. After a week, a stable average number of foci has formed on the plates. At this point, half of the culture plates are shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 39.0 °C, while the other half (the control group) are maintained at 32.0 °C. Both sets are incubated for another 48 hours.\n\nThere are two prevailing hypotheses for the viral oncogenesis mechanism:\n1.  **Hit-and-Run**: The viral oncoprotein is only required to initiate transformation, causing permanent genetic or epigenetic changes. After this \"hit,\" the continued presence of the functional oncoprotein is not necessary to maintain the cancerous state.\n2.  **Oncogene Addiction**: The transformed cells are continuously dependent on the viral oncoprotein's activity to maintain their cancerous phenotype.\n\nFor the specific cell line and reversion conditions of this experiment, it is known that if the cells are experiencing oncogene addiction, the inactivation of the oncoprotein leads to the disappearance of 95% of the established foci within the 48-hour incubation period at the non-permissive temperature.\n\nIf the Novavirus operates via an oncogene addiction mechanism, calculate the expected ratio of the final average number of foci per plate at the non-permissive temperature to that at the permissive temperature. Express your answer as a decimal value.", "solution": "Define $N_{0}$ as the average number of established foci per plate at the moment of the temperature shift, after the initial week at the permissive temperature. By the problem statement, this number is stable at that time.\n\nFor the control plates maintained at the permissive temperature, the oncoprotein remains functional. Given the stability noted at the end of the first week, we take the final average number of foci after the additional $48$ hours to remain $N_{0}$:\n$$\nN_{\\text{perm}}=N_{0}.\n$$\n\nFor the plates shifted to the non-permissive temperature under the oncogene addiction mechanism, the inactivation of the oncoprotein for $48$ hours causes disappearance of $0.95$ of the established foci, so a fraction $1-0.95=0.05$ remains. Therefore, the final average number of foci on these plates is\n$$\nN_{\\text{non-perm}}=(1-0.95)N_{0}=0.05\\,N_{0}.\n$$\n\nThe requested ratio of the final average number of foci per plate at the non-permissive temperature to that at the permissive temperature is\n$$\nR=\\frac{N_{\\text{non-perm}}}{N_{\\text{perm}}}=\\frac{0.05\\,N_{0}}{N_{0}}=0.05.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05}$$", "id": "2105324"}]}
