To classify this virus, they conducted a series of experiments. The key findings are as follows:\n\n1.  The genetic material extracted from purified, intact viral particles is a single-stranded polymer. This material is readily degraded by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) but remains unaffected by ribonuclease (RNase).\n2.  Upon infection of the host archaeon, the first nucleic acid synthesis event detected is the conversion of the viral genome into a double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (dsDNA) molecule.\n3.  Treatment of the infected host cells with a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the host's own DNA-dependent DNA polymerase completely prevents the formation of the dsDNA intermediate.\n4.  This dsDNA intermediate then serves as the template for the synthesis of all viral messenger RNA (mRNA) by the host cell's transcriptional machinery.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which Baltimore classification group would this new virus be assigned to?\n\nA.

Class VII", "solution": "Identify the nature of the genome: The nucleic acid is single-stranded and degraded by DNase but not by RNase, which defines it as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Therefore, the virion contains ssDNA rather than RNA or double-stranded DNA.\n\nDetermine the first replication step: The first detected nucleic acid synthesis event is the conversion of the ssDNA genome into a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) intermediate. This is characteristic of ssDNA viruses that form a dsDNA replicative form.\n\nAssess polymerase dependence: The formation of the dsDNA intermediate is blocked by an inhibitor of the host DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, indicating that the virus relies on the host’s DNA-dependent DNA polymerase to synthesize the complementary DNA strand from the ssDNA genome. This excludes viruses that encode and bring their own polymerases for the first step (such as RNA viruses that require RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase).\n\nmRNA synthesis strategy: The dsDNA intermediate serves as the template for all viral mRNA using the host transcription machinery, consistent with host RNA polymerase operating on dsDNA to produce viral mRNAs.\n\nClass exclusions:\n- Class I (dsDNA): Inconsistent because the virion would contain dsDNA, not ssDNA.\n- Class III (dsRNA): Inconsistent due to RNase sensitivity and requirement for a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n- Class IV and Class V (ssRNA positive/negative): Inconsistent because the genome would be RNA and RNase sensitive; early steps would involve RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity.\n- Class VI (ssRNA-RT): Inconsistent because the genome is RNA and reverse transcription is performed by a viral reverse transcriptase, not host DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.\n- Class VII (dsDNA-RT): Inconsistent because the virion genome is dsDNA.\n\nThe observations uniquely fit Class II (ssDNA viruses) that convert ssDNA to dsDNA using host DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and then use host transcription machinery to make mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2096633"}, {"introduction": "This practice problem solidifies the concept of genomic \"sense\" or \"polarity,\" which is central to the Baltimore system, especially for RNA viruses. The key observation is a viral genome that functions directly as messenger RNA ($mRNA$) upon entering the host cell.

Their initial analysis reveals that the virus's genetic material consists of a single-stranded Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule. Through a series of experiments, they meticulously track the first few steps of the viral replication cycle after the genome enters the host cell's cytoplasm. They make two key observations:\n\n1.  Immediately upon entry, the viral RNA genome is recognized and translated by the host cell's ribosomes, leading to the production of a large viral polyprotein.\n2.  This polyprotein is then cleaved into several functional proteins. One of these proteins is an enzyme that uses the original viral RNA genome as a template to synthesize a new, full-length RNA strand that is complementary to the original genome.\n\nThe Baltimore classification system categorizes viruses into seven classes based on their type of genome and their strategy for synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA).

This implies the genome itself functions as mRNA. A genome that is immediately translatable by host ribosomes must be positive-sense single-stranded RNA, because only a $(+)$ sense RNA has the same polarity as host mRNA. This excludes:\n- Class I (dsDNA), because DNA is not directly translated.\n- Class III (dsRNA), because double-stranded RNA is not directly translated and requires a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to produce mRNAs.\n- Class V ($(-)$ssRNA), because negative-sense RNA cannot be directly translated and must be transcribed by a packaged RdRp into $(+)$ sense mRNAs before translation.\n- Class VI ($(+)ssRNA$-RT, retroviruses), because although the genome is $(+)$ sense RNA, their defining replication step is reverse transcription to DNA by reverse transcriptase, not immediate cytoplasmic translation of the incoming genomic RNA to a polyprotein as the primary replication strategy.\n\nSecond observation: One of the proteins produced is an enzyme that uses the original viral RNA genome as a template to synthesize a new, full-length complementary RNA strand. This is the hallmark of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizing the $(-)$ sense complementary strand from a $(+)$ sense genomic RNA, forming a replicative intermediate. This is characteristic of $(+)$ssRNA viruses (Baltimore Class IV), which translate their genome to produce RdRp, then use RdRp to synthesize a $(-)$ sense template to replicate the genome.\n\nCombining both observations, the virus is a $(+)$ssRNA virus in Baltimore Class IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2096654"}, {"introduction": "This final problem explores one of the more complex viral life cycles, blurring the lines between conventional DNA and RNA viruses.
