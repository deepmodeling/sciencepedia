This exercise introduces flow cytometry, a powerful technique used to count different lymphocyte populations based on unique surface markers like CD3 (T cells), CD19 (B cells), and CD16/56 (NK cells). By interpreting this cellular \"census\" in the context of a patient's clinical history, you can identify profound defects in lymphocyte development, as seen in Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) [@problem_id:2072988].", "problem": "An 8-month-old male infant is brought to a pediatric immunologist due to a history of recurrent severe infections since the age of 3 months, including persistent oral candidiasis (thrush), multiple episodes of otitis media, and a recent diagnosis of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia. His family history is significant for a maternal uncle who died in infancy from an unknown infection. Suspecting a primary immunodeficiency, the physician orders a complete blood count, which reveals lymphopenia (abnormally low number of lymphocytes). To further characterize the lymphocyte populations, a sample of the infant's peripheral blood is analyzed by flow cytometry using fluorescent antibodies against specific cell surface markers. The results, expressed as a percentage of total lymphocytes, are summarized below, along with typical reference ranges for this age group.\n\n**Patient's Flow Cytometry Results:**\n-   $CD3^+$ cells: 2%\n-   $CD19^+$ cells: 97%\n-   $CD16^+/56^+$ cells: < 1%\n\n**Reference Ranges (age-matched):**\n-   $CD3^+$ (T cells): 60 – 80%\n-   $CD19^+$ (B cells): 10 – 25%\n-   $CD16^+/56^+$ (Natural Killer [NK] cells): 5 – 15%\n\nBased on this immunophenotyping data, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this infant?\n\nA.

X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)", "solution": "The key clinical features are early-onset severe and opportunistic infections (persistent thrush and *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia) beginning around 3 months of age, which coincides with waning maternal IgG, lymphopenia on complete blood count, and an X-linked pattern suggested by a maternal uncle who died in infancy. These features point to a severe T cell immunodeficiency, often X-linked.\n\nInterpretation of flow cytometry:\n- $CD3^+$ (T cells) are markedly reduced: the patient has 2%, compared to a reference range of 60-80%.\n- $CD19^+$ (B cells) are relatively increased in proportion: the patient has 97%, compared to a reference range of 10-25%. Given overall lymphopenia, the absolute B cell count may still be low, but the preserved relative proportion indicates presence of B cells.\n- $CD16^+/56^+$ (Natural Killer [NK] cells) are nearly absent: the patient has <1%, compared to a reference range of 5-15%.\n\nThus, the immunophenotype is $T^-B^+NK^-$.\n\nMatch to diagnoses:\n- X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton, option A) typically shows normal T cells with absent B cells ($T^+B^-NK^+$), which does not match.\n- DiGeorge syndrome (option B) features thymic aplasia with absent or reduced T cells but normal NK cells and normal numbers of B cells ($T^-B^+NK^+$); the NK cell absence here does not match.\n- SCID due to ADA deficiency (option C) causes accumulation of toxic metabolites affecting all lymphocyte lineages, typically $T^-B^-NK^-$; preserved B cell presence here does not match.\n- X-linked SCID due to IL2RG (common gamma chain) deficiency (option D) leads to defective signaling through cytokine receptors using the common gamma chain (e.g., IL-7 for T cell development and IL-15 for NK development), producing a $T^-B^+NK^-$ phenotype. This precisely matches the patient’s immunophenotype and the X-linked family history, and explains the severe opportunistic infections.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is X-linked SCID.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2072988"}, {"introduction": "While having the correct number of immune cells is crucial, it's equally important that they function correctly. This practice shifts our focus from counting cells to measuring their activity, specifically the \"oxidative burst\" of neutrophils, which is essential for killing certain bacteria and fungi. You will analyze data from a Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test, a quantitative functional assay that measures this process and is the gold standard for diagnosing Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) [@problem_id:2072970].", "problem": "A 7-year-old male patient is evaluated for recurrent infections. His medical history is significant for multiple skin abscesses and a bout of pneumonia caused by *Aspergillus fumigatus*. His family history reveals that a maternal uncle had similar issues. Suspecting an inherited immunodeficiency, the clinical immunologist orders a functional assay for the patient's neutrophils.\n\nThe assay used is the Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 test. In this test, neutrophils are incubated with DHR, a non-fluorescent compound. The cells are then split into two samples: one is left resting (unstimulated), and the other is activated with a potent chemical stimulant that triggers the \"oxidative burst\". During a normal oxidative burst, the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme complex generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). These ROS oxidize DHR into rhodamine 123, a highly fluorescent green molecule. The fluorescence of thousands of individual cells is measured using flow cytometry, and the result is reported as the geometric Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI). A failure of the oxidative burst is the hallmark of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n\nThe results from the laboratory for both the patient and a healthy age-matched control are as follows:\n- **Healthy Control**:\n  - Resting (unstimulated) MFI: $12.5$\n  - Stimulated MFI: $1562.5$\n- **Patient**:\n  - Resting (unstimulated) MFI: $11.8$\n  - Stimulated MFI: $14.1$\n\nTo quantify the neutrophil response, a \"Stimulation Index\" (SI) is calculated, which is defined as the ratio of the MFI of the stimulated sample to the MFI of the resting sample.\n\nCalculate the Stimulation Index for the patient. Report your answer as a dimensionless quantity rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The objective is to calculate the Stimulation Index (SI) for the patient based on the provided experimental data.\n\nThe problem statement defines the Stimulation Index as the ratio of the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of the stimulated neutrophils to the MFI of the resting (unstimulated) neutrophils. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{SI} = \\frac{\\text{MFI}_{\\text{stimulated}}}{\\text{MFI}_{\\text{resting}}} $$\n\nThis index measures the fold-increase in fluorescence upon stimulation, which directly reflects the capacity of the neutrophils to produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) via the oxidative burst.\n\nThe problem provides MFI data for both a healthy control and the patient. We are asked to calculate the SI specifically for the patient. Therefore, we must use the data from the \"Patient\" category. The data for the healthy control is provided for context and comparison but is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe patient's data is:\n- Resting (unstimulated) MFI = $11.8$\n- Stimulated MFI = $14.1$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula for the Stimulation Index:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{patient}} = \\frac{14.1}{11.8} $$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{patient}} \\approx 1.194915254... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Let's examine the calculated value, $1.194915254...$.\nThe first three significant figures are 1, 1, and 9. The fourth digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down, which means we keep the third significant digit as it is.\n\nThus, the rounded Stimulation Index for the patient is $1.19$.\n\nFor context, the healthy control's SI would be $\\frac{1562.5}{12.5} = 125$. The patient's extremely low SI of $1.19$ indicates a profound defect in the oxidative burst, which is characteristic of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.19}$$", "id": "2072970"}, {"introduction": "Some of the most intricate immunodeficiencies arise not from the absence of cells, but from failed communication between them. This final practice presents a complex diagnostic challenge that requires synthesizing multiple pieces of evidence: serum immunoglobulin levels, lymphocyte counts, and a specific molecular marker on T-cells. Your task is to connect these disparate data points to uncover a defect in the T-cell and B-cell collaboration required for antibody class switching, a hallmark of conditions like Hyper-IgM Syndrome [@problem_id:2072956].", "problem": "A 7-year-old male presents to a pediatric immunology clinic with a history of recurrent, severe sinopulmonary infections since infancy, including multiple episodes of pneumonia caused by encapsulated bacteria like *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*. He has also experienced an episode of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP), an opportunistic fungal infection.

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)", "solution": "We start by identifying the key clinical and laboratory features that guide immunodeficiency diagnosis. The patient has recurrent, severe sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*, indicating a humoral immunity defect due to impaired opsonizing antibodies, especially IgG. Additionally, the patient has had *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia, an opportunistic infection that suggests a defect in T cell help for B cells and macrophage activation rather than a pure B cell deficiency.\n\nLaboratory data show severely decreased IgG, markedly decreased IgA, and elevated IgM. Circulating B cell percentage is within the normal range, and circulating T cell percentage is also within the normal range. Critically, flow cytometry shows absent CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression on activated T cells.\n\nClass-switch recombination in B cells requires interaction between CD40 on B cells and CD40L on activated T helper cells. When CD40L is absent, B cells cannot receive the necessary signal to undergo class switching from IgM to other isotypes, leading to the characteristic pattern of immunoglobulins: low IgG and IgA with normal or elevated IgM. This defect also impairs germinal center formation and T cell-dependent macrophage activation, predisposing to opportunistic infections such as *Pneumocystis jirovecii*.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Common Variable Immunodeficiency is characterized by low IgG with low IgA and/or IgM, impaired vaccine responses, and typically normal CD40L expression; IgM is not typically elevated, and opportunistic infections like *Pneumocystis jirovecii* are less characteristic. The absent CD40L and elevated IgM exclude this.\n- X-linked Agammaglobulinemia features absent or profoundly reduced B cells due to BTK deficiency, with low levels of all immunoglobulins. The presence of a normal percentage of B cells and elevated IgM makes this unlikely.\n- DiGeorge Syndrome involves thymic aplasia leading to T cell deficiency, hypocalcemia, and conotruncal cardiac anomalies; T cell numbers would be decreased, which is not seen here, and CD40L expression would not be specifically absent due to a T helper cell activation molecule deficiency.\n- X-linked Hyper-IgM Syndrome results from CD40L deficiency on T helper cells, causing defective class switching with low IgG and IgA and elevated or normal IgM, normal B cell numbers, and susceptibility to both encapsulated bacteria and opportunistic infections including *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The absent CD40L on activated T cells is diagnostic.\n- Severe Combined Immunodeficiency involves severe defects in both T and B cell immunity, with markedly decreased T cells and often decreased B and NK cells, leading to early severe infections. Normal T cell percentage and normal B cell percentage do not fit SCID.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis, consistent with the immunoglobulin pattern, normal B cell numbers, opportunistic infection history, and absent CD40L on activated T cells, is X-linked Hyper-IgM Syndrome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2072956"}]}
