{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Mastering the conventions of binomial nomenclature is a foundational skill for any biologist. These rules, established by the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP), ensure that every species has a unique, universally recognized name, preventing ambiguity in scientific communication. This first practice exercise [@problem_id:2080882] challenges you to identify the core formatting errors in a given microbial name, honing your attention to detail and reinforcing the essential rules of capitalization and style.", "problem": "In a microbiology lab report, a student identifies a bacterial species and writes its name as *staphylococcus Aureus*. According to the formal rules of binomial nomenclature used in scientific writing, which of the following statements correctly identifies the primary formatting errors present in the student's notation?\n\nA. The entire scientific name should be underlined instead of italicized.\n\nB. The genus name should be capitalized, and the species epithet should be an abbreviation.\n\nC. The genus name is correctly formatted, but the species epithet should be lowercase.\n\nD. The genus name should be capitalized, and the species epithet should be lowercase.\n\nE. Both the genus name and the species epithet should be lowercase.", "solution": "In formal binomial nomenclature, the following rules apply to formatting:\n- The scientific name consists of the genus name followed by the species epithet.\n- The genus name is capitalized; the species epithet is lowercase.\n- Both genus and species are italicized when typed; when handwritten, each part is underlined separately.\n- The species epithet is never abbreviated; the genus may be abbreviated after the first full mention.\n\nThe student wrote the name as italicized \"*staphylococcus Aureus*\". Comparing this to the rules:\n- The genus name appears in lowercase (\"staphylococcus\") when it must be capitalized (\"Staphylococcus\").\n- The species epithet appears with an initial capital letter (\"Aureus\") when it must be lowercase (\"aureus\").\n- Italicization is correct in typed text, so underlining is not required, and there is no rule that the species epithet should be abbreviated.\n\nTherefore, the primary formatting errors are that the genus should be capitalized and the species epithet should be lowercase, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2080882"}, {"introduction": "Once you have correctly written a full scientific name, the next step is learning how to refer to it efficiently in your writing.

Coli* incorrectly capitalizes the species epithet; it must be lowercase.\n- Option D: *E. coli* has the correct capitalization, abbreviation, and italics; this matches the standard convention.\n- Option E: *Esch. coli* uses a nonstandard genus abbreviation; the correct abbreviation is a single initial with a period.\n\nTherefore, the correct form on second mention is *E. coli*, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2080892"}, {"introduction": "Microbial taxonomy extends far beyond just the rules of naming; it involves the fundamental question of how we define a 'species' or 'genus'. In the modern genomic era, this is no longer based solely on physical traits but on quantitative genetic data. This problem [@problem_id:2080919] introduces you to Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), a key computational tool used by scientists to delineate taxonomic boundaries. By analyzing a dataset of pairwise genome comparisons, you will apply the established ANI thresholds (an identity of 95.0% for species, and 76.0% for genus) to classify a group of novel strains, engaging directly with the methods at the forefront of microbial systematics.", "problem": "A research team studying extremophiles at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent has isolated five novel strains of archaea, labeled A, B, C, D, and E. To assign them to a preliminary taxonomic classification, the team performed whole-genome sequencing and calculated the pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) for all strains. The results are provided in the table below, with each value representing the ANI percentage between the strain in the corresponding row and column.\n\n| Strain | A | B | C | D | E |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| **A** | 100 | 97.2 | 78.1 | 77.9 | 72.3 |\n| **B** | 97.2 | 100 | 78.3 | 78.0 | 72.5 |\n| **C** | 78.1 | 78.3 | 100 | 96.5 | 73.8 |\n| **D** | 77.9 | 78.0 | 96.5 | 100 | 74.0 |\n| **E** | 72.3 | 72.5 | 73.8 | 74.0 | 100 |\n\nModern microbial taxonomy uses the following standard operational thresholds based on ANI for delineation:\n1. Two strains are considered to belong to the same species if their pairwise ANI value is 95.0% or greater.\n2. Strains belonging to different species are considered to be within the same genus if their pairwise ANI value is 76.0% or greater.\n\nBased on the provided data and these taxonomic rules, determine the total number of distinct species and the total number of distinct genera represented by these five strains. Your final answer should be a row matrix with two entries, representing the number of distinct species and the number of distinct genera, in that order.", "solution": "We are given pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values. The species threshold is an ANI value of 95.0% or greater, and the genus threshold for strains of different species is an ANI value of 76.0% or greater.\n\nStep 1 (species delineation): By the rule, two strains are in the same species if and only if their pairwise ANI is at least 95.0%. We examine all pairs:\n- Between A and B: 97.2% is $\\geq$ 95.0%, so A and B are the same species.\n- Between C and D: 96.5% is $\\geq$ 95.0%, so C and D are the same species.\n- All other inter-pair values are below 95.0%: A with C, D, E have 78.1%, 77.9%, 72.3%; B with C, D, E have 78.3%, 78.0%, 72.5%; C with E is 73.8%; D with E is 74.0%. Hence no further species merges occur.\nTherefore, the species clusters are $\\{A,B\\}$, $\\{C,D\\}$, and $\\{E\\}$. Thus, the total number of distinct species is 3.\n\nStep 2 (genus delineation): A standard operational way to apply the genus threshold is to find groups of strains linked by a pairwise ANI of at least 76.0%.\n- Within $\\{A,B\\}$ and within $\\{C,D\\}$, the ANI values (97.2% and 96.5%) are already above 76.0%.\n- Between the two species clusters $\\{A,B\\}$ and $\\{C,D\\}$, all cross-pairs satisfy the genus threshold: A–C is 78.1%, A–D is 77.9%, B–C is 78.3%, and B–D is 78.0%. All of these are $\\geq$ 76.0%. Hence $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ all belong to the same genus.\n- Strain E has ANI values with all others strictly below 76.0%: A–E is 72.3%, B–E is 72.5%, C–E is 73.8%, D–E is 74.0%. Therefore, E belongs to its own separate genus.\nThus, there are 2 genera: one containing $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ and one containing $\\{E\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct species is 3 and the total number of distinct genera is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2080919"}]}
