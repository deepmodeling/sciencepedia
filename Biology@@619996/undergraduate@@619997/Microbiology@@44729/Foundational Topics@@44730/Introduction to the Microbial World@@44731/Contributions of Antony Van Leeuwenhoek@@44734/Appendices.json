Lacking a standardized measurement scale, Leeuwenhoek often estimated the size of these microorganisms by comparing them to familiar objects.\n\nIn one of his letters, he described observing a certain type of animalcule in a water sample and noted that its length was \"100 times smaller than a large louse.\" For the purpose of this historical estimation problem, assume that a \"large louse\" has a length of 2.5 millimeters (mm).\n\nBased on Leeuwenhoek's comparative description, calculate the estimated length of one of these animalcules.

His meticulously detailed letters to the Royal Society provided the world's first descriptions of bacteria, protozoa, and yeast. This practice challenges you to act as a historical microbiologist, interpreting Leeuwenhoek's own vivid descriptions of morphology and motility to identify the organisms he observed. It is a fundamental exercise in the art of scientific observation and classification that lies at the heart of microbiology.

Consider the following four descriptions of microscopic entities he observed in different samples:\n\n(i) In a water sample, he saw motile organisms described as being relatively large, with a longish oval shape. He noted their \"nimble motion,\" which involved turning themselves around and moving both forwards and backwards in a complex manner.\n\n(ii) From scrapings of his own teeth, he observed what he called an \"unbelievably great company of living animalcules, a-moving more nimbly than any I had ever seen.\" He described them as \"wretchedly small\" and noted they had varied forms; some were oblong and propelled themselves forward, while others looked like a \"bent wire.\"\n\n(iii) In a sample of blood, he described particles that appeared as uniform, flat globules of an oval shape when viewed individually. He was particularly struck by their pliability, noting that \"these globules are so pliant that they will suffer a change of shape\" when crowding each other.\n\n(iv) While examining fermenting beer, he noted a \"very great number of small particles.\" He described these as consisting of \"six, seven, or eight clear globules, all huddled up together into one,\" giving the appearance of clusters of tiny spheres.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly matches each description with the organism or cell type observed?\n\nA.

Such size and motility patterns are characteristic of protozoa (e.g., ciliates like Paramecium or flagellates), which are larger than bacteria and display agile, reversible movements. Therefore, (i) corresponds to protozoa.\n\n(ii) The dental scrapings show an “unbelievably great company” of “wretchedly small” forms, some oblong and self-propelled, others like a “bent wire.” Dental plaque is rich in diverse bacteria: cocci, rods, and particularly spirochetes that appear as twisted or “bent wire” forms. Thus, (ii) corresponds to bacteria.\n\n(iii) The blood sample shows uniform, flat globules of oval shape, notable for their pliability and ability to change shape when crowded. These are classic features of erythrocytes (red blood cells), which are deformable and appear as flattened discs (oval in many animals). Hence, (iii) corresponds to red blood cells.\n\n(iv) The fermenting beer contains very many small particles described as clusters of six to eight clear globules huddled together. Fermentation is driven by yeast, and budding yeast cells are often seen as clustered, spherical or ovoid “globules.” Therefore, (iv) corresponds to yeast.\n\nCollecting these identifications gives: (i) Protozoa, (ii) Bacteria, (iii) Red Blood Cells, (iv) Yeast, which matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2060432"}, {"introduction": "Observing movement is one thing; proving it is a sign of life is another. Leeuwenhoek's claims of living \"animalcules\" were revolutionary and naturally met with skepticism. Could the motion he saw be a mere physical phenomenon, like dust jiggling in water? This thought experiment places you at the frontier of 17th-century science, tasking you with designing a decisive control experiment. Your goal is to devise a method, using only the tools available to Leeuwenhoek, to prove that the motion of his animalcules was biological motility, not a random physical process like Brownian motion. [@problem_id:2060429]", "problem": "Antony van Leeuwenhoek, using his simple single-lens microscopes in the late 17th century, was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms, which he termed \"animalcules.\" He meticulously documented their diverse shapes and, most notably, their vigorous and often directed movement. A contemporary skeptic, however, might have argued that this motion was not a sign of life, but merely the random, jiggling movement of tiny, inanimate dust particles suspended in a fluid—a phenomenon we now understand as Brownian motion.\n\nImagine you are advising Leeuwenhoek. He wants to design a simple, decisive experiment to counter this specific skepticism. Using only the materials and understanding plausibly available to a scientist in the late 17th or early 18th century, which of the following proposed experiments would provide the most direct and compelling evidence that the observed motion is a result of biological activity (motility) and not a purely physical process?\n\nA. Observe the sample over several days to see if the number of animalcules increases, demonstrating reproduction.\n\nB. Gently heat the water sample to a near-boiling temperature and then re-observe the animalcules after it cools.\n\nC. Compare the movement of the animalcules with the movement of similarly-sized, non-living particles, such as finely crushed brick dust or inorganic salts, in a separate water sample.\n\nD. Add a small drop of a known nutrient, like a meat broth, to the water sample and observe if the movement becomes more active or directed.\n\nE. Vigorously shake the water sample to see if the motion of the animalcules is temporarily disrupted before resuming its original pattern.", "solution": "Goal: Discriminate between two hypotheses about the observed motion.\n- H0 (physical): The motion is Brownian—the random thermal jiggling of inanimate particles suspended in a fluid.\n- H1 (biological): The motion is active motility generated by living organisms.\n\nKey discriminating principle: Active motility requires viability and intact biological machinery; Brownian motion does not. Therefore, any intervention that reliably abolishes biological function while leaving the inanimate-particle behavior intact (aside from reversible physical changes) gives a decisive test.\n\nPrediction under H0: For inanimate particles, the random motion arises from thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions, and persists as long as the fluid is liquid. Its magnitude depends on temperature and viscosity. In modern terms, the mean-square displacement satisfies $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle = 2 D t$, with diffusion coefficient $D$ scaling as $D \\propto \\frac{T}{\\eta r}$, where $T$ is temperature, $\\eta$ is viscosity, and $r$ is particle size. After heating and then cooling back to the original temperature, the Brownian motion reappears with the same characteristic scale.\n\nPrediction under H1: For living “animalcules,” swimming requires intact membranes, proteins, and metabolic function. High temperatures near boiling irreversibly denature proteins and compromise membranes, abolishing motility. After cooling, nonliving particles may still exhibit slight random jiggling characteristic of Brownian motion, but directed, purposeful swimming will not resume.\n\nEvaluate each proposed experiment against these predictions:\n\nA. Observe over days for increase in number. While reproduction would strongly indicate that the entities are alive, it does not directly answer whether the observed motion at a given moment is active motility rather than Brownian motion. A skeptic could concede that they are living yet still argue the motion seen is merely random jiggling. This is evidence for life, not a direct mechanistic test of the motion.\n\nB. Gently heat to near boiling, then cool and re-observe. This provides a within-sample, immediate perturbation that selectively abolishes biological motility (by heat-killing) while leaving inanimate Brownian motion fundamentally intact (once cooled back to the original temperature; any transient viscosity changes are reversed). Therefore, if the previously vigorous, directed motion ceases permanently after heating, while only faint random jiggling remains, it directly supports H1 and rejects H0 for the observed motion, with minimal confounding.\n\nC. Compare with crushed brick dust or salts in a separate sample. Although a useful control in spirit, using a separate sample introduces confounds (differences in fluid, temperature, convection, particle shape/size). Moreover, a skeptic could claim that any observed difference stems from particle shape or density rather than “life.” A same-slide mixture would be stronger, but as stated (separate sample) this is less decisive than B.\n\nD. Add a nutrient like meat broth and look for increased activity. An increase in apparent motion could be due to changes in viscosity, osmolarity, or induced convective flows upon mixing, not necessarily metabolism; the effect is ambiguous and not as discriminating as B.\n\nE. Vigorously shake the sample and observe resumption. Both Brownian motion and active motility will “resume” after mechanical disturbance; this does not discriminate.\n\nConclusion: Option B gives the most direct and compelling evidence available to Leeuwenhoek with plausible materials and understanding. It implements a decisive viability test within the same specimen: if motion vanishes irreversibly after lethal heating and only weak, random jiggling remains upon cooling, the prior vigorous, directed movements are attributable to biological motility, not a purely physical process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2060429"}]}
