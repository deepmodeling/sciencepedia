Louis Pasteur's ingenious swan-neck flask experiment provided definitive evidence that life arises from pre-existing life, refuting the long-held belief that organisms could arise from non-living matter. This exercise [@problem_id:2070718] challenges you to think like an experimentalist by troubleshooting a replication of this famous experiment, reinforcing your understanding of sterile technique and the crucial role of experimental controls in science.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with replicating Louis Pasteur's famous swan-neck flask experiment to demonstrate that microorganisms in the air are responsible for contaminating sterile broths. The student prepares a nutrient-rich broth, places it in a flask with a long, S-shaped neck, and boils the broth vigorously to sterilize it, leaving the end of the neck open to the atmosphere. For two weeks, the flask is left undisturbed on a lab bench, and the broth remains perfectly clear, indicating no microbial growth. The student then carefully moves the flask to a different location in the lab for long-term observation. Three days after being moved, the student observes that the broth has become turbid, a clear sign of microbial contamination.\n\nAssuming the initial sterilization process was successful and the flask remained intact, what is the most likely procedural error or event that led to the contamination?\n\nA. The broth was not nutritionally complete, causing latent, invisible microbes to become visible only after a change in conditions.\n\nB. A sudden drop in air pressure in the laboratory forced outside contaminants past the S-shaped bend and into the broth.\n\nC. The flask was inadvertently tilted while being moved, causing the sterile broth to wash back into the first curve of the neck and then flow back into the main flask.\n\nD. The ambient light in the new location was brighter, providing the necessary energy for photosynthetic microorganisms to grow.\n\nE. The broth, after two weeks, chemically degraded and spontaneously generated the microorganisms observed.", "solution": "We begin by stating the relevant biological principles from Pasteur’s swan-neck flask experiment:\n- Sterilization by boiling eliminates viable microorganisms present in the broth at the time of heating.\n- The S-shaped neck allows air exchange but traps airborne particles carrying microorganisms in the bends due to gravity and deposition; thus, air alone entering the flask does not contaminate the broth unless particulates are conveyed into the liquid.\n- Microbial growth in a previously sterile medium requires inoculation by viable cells; absent inoculation, no growth occurs, and there is no spontaneous generation.\n\nLogical sequence based on the observations:\n1. The broth was boiled vigorously and left with the swan-neck open. The broth remained clear for two weeks. By the sterility principle, this indicates that no microbes entered the broth during that period, consistent with the swan-neck trapping dust-borne microbes in the bend while allowing sterile air to pass.\n2. The flask was then moved to a different location. The most plausible event during movement is a tilt that allowed the sterile broth to flow into the first curve of the neck where dust and microbes had been trapped, and then drain back into the main flask. This would transfer viable microorganisms from the neck into the broth, thereby inoculating it.\n3. Three days after being moved, the broth turned turbid. This delay is consistent with microbial growth dynamics: after inoculation, cells undergo lag and exponential phases before turbidity becomes visible.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect: nutritional incompleteness would suppress growth rather than cause delayed visibility; moreover, no new inoculum arises merely from changing locations.\n- Option B is unlikely: ordinary laboratory air pressure variations are insufficient to propel particulate-laden air past the condensate trap of the S-bend into the broth, and the design specifically mitigates such flow of particulates.\n- Option D is incorrect: brighter light cannot produce microbes de novo; photosynthetic growth still requires an inoculum, which the sterile broth lacked prior to movement.\n- Option E is false by the refutation of spontaneous generation demonstrated by Pasteur; chemical degradation does not generate organisms.\n\nTherefore, the most likely procedural event leading to contamination is tilting the flask such that broth washed into the neck, contacted trapped microbes, and then flowed back, inoculating the broth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070718"}, {"introduction": "After Pasteur, Robert Koch established a revolutionary framework for proving that a specific microbe causes a specific disease. These four criteria, known as Koch's postulates, became the gold standard in medical microbiology for decades. However, the practical application of these postulates revealed their limitations, as this problem [@problem_id:2070693] illustrates. By analyzing the cascading failure that results from an inability to culture a suspected pathogen, you will appreciate how this historical challenge spurred the development of the molecular and genetic techniques that define modern microbiology.", "problem": "A 19th-century microbiologist, Dr. Alistair Finch, is investigating a debilitating illness characterized by distinctive skin lesions. Using a state-of-the-art light microscope, he consistently observes a unique, helical-shaped bacterium (a spirochete) in tissue samples from every single afflicted patient. Conversely, samples from healthy individuals show no signs of this bacterium. Dr. Finch is confident he has found the causative agent. However, he encounters a major obstacle: despite his best efforts using a wide array of sterilized nutrient broths and solid media derived from potatoes, gelatin, and beef extract, the spirochete obstinately refuses to grow in his laboratory. This inability to cultivate the organism prevents him from definitively proving its role in the disease according to the scientific standards of his day.\n\nFor reference, the four postulates proposed by his contemporary, Robert Koch, are:\n1.  The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.\n2.  The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.\n3.  The cultured microorganism should cause the same disease when introduced into a healthy, susceptible experimental host.\n4.  The microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.\n\nGiven Dr. Finch's specific predicament—the complete failure to cultivate the spirochete in the lab—which of Koch's postulates are rendered impossible for him to satisfy?\n\nA. Postulate 1 only\n\nB. Postulate 2 only\n\nC. Postulates 2, 3, and 4\n\nD. Postulates 3 and 4 only\n\nE. All four postulates", "solution": "We analyze each of Koch’s four postulates in light of the specific constraint that the spirochete cannot be cultivated in the laboratory on available media.\n\n- Postulate 1 states: The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms. By the problem statement, Dr. Finch consistently observes the spirochete in all diseased patients and not in healthy individuals. Therefore, Postulate 1 is satisfied.\n\n- Postulate 2 states: The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture. The inability to cultivate the spirochete in any nutrient broth or solid medium directly prevents growth in pure culture. Therefore, Postulate 2 cannot be satisfied.\n\n- Postulate 3 states: The cultured microorganism should cause the same disease when introduced into a healthy, susceptible experimental host. The wording requires a cultured microorganism. Since culture is not possible, Dr. Finch cannot obtain a cultured inoculum, making Postulate 3 impossible to fulfill.\n\n- Postulate 4 states: The microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent. This step presupposes successful experimental infection (from Postulate 3) and, in Koch’s framework, re-isolation and identification via culture-based methods. Because Postulate 3 cannot be carried out and culture is not possible, Postulate 4 also cannot be satisfied.\n\nThus, the failure to cultivate the organism renders Postulates 2, 3, and 4 impossible to fulfill, while Postulate 1 remains satisfied.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070693"}, {"introduction": "The microbial world is not just a rogues' gallery of pathogens; it is a vast, untapped reservoir of metabolic diversity. Martinus Beijerinck shifted the focus of microbiology with his powerful enrichment culture technique, which allows scientists to isolate microorganisms with specific, desirable traits from a complex environment. This practice [@problem_id:2070714] lets you apply Beijerinck's principle to a contemporary challenge, showing how foundational concepts are essential tools in modern biotechnology and environmental science.", "problem": "A microbiologist is attempting to isolate a novel soil bacterium capable of breaking down and metabolizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common and persistent plastic polymer. The researcher plans to use an enrichment culture technique, a principle pioneered by Martinus Beijerinck. This technique involves creating a specific liquid growth medium and environmental conditions that selectively favor the growth of microorganisms with a desired metabolic capability from a mixed population, while inhibiting the growth of others.\n\nThe soil sample is inoculated into a liquid medium that contains a standard buffer to maintain pH, a nitrogen source (ammonium chloride), a phosphorus source (potassium phosphate), and various essential trace minerals. The crucial part of the design is the choice of the primary carbon source, which provides the energy and organic building blocks for the bacterium.\n\nGiven the goal of isolating a PET-degrading bacterium, which of the following media compositions represents the most effective application of the enrichment culture principle?\n\nA. A rich, complex medium containing yeast extract and tryptone, with no added PET.\n\nB. The minimal medium described above, supplemented with both glucose and finely powdered PET.\n\nC. The minimal medium described above, with finely powdered PET as the sole source of carbon.\n\nD. The minimal medium described above, with no added carbon source whatsoever.\n\nE. The minimal medium described above, with glucose as the sole source of carbon.", "solution": "The enrichment culture principle, as articulated by Beijerinck, is to impose a selective environment in which only organisms possessing the desired metabolic capability can grow, while organisms lacking it are inhibited by the absence of alternative resources. For the target trait “PET degradation,” the selective pressure must be that PET is the only utilizable carbon and energy source provided.\n\nGrowth requires a metabolizable carbon source. For a given organism, growth rate on a substrate can be expressed conceptually by a function such as $\\mu(S)$ with $\\mu(0)=0$ and $\\mu(S)>0$ only if the organism can utilize the substrate at concentration $S>0$. If PET is the only carbon source present:\n- For non-PET-degraders, the effective substrate for growth is absent, thus $\\mu_{\\text{non-PET}}=0$, so they cannot increase in abundance.\n- For PET-degraders, $\\mu_{\\text{PET}}>0$ when PET is available, so they grow and become enriched.\n\nIntroducing an alternative, easily metabolizable carbon source (e.g., glucose, yeast extract components) allows general heterotrophs to grow with $\\mu>0$ regardless of PET-degrading ability, defeating selection. In addition, many catabolic pathways, including plastic-degrading enzymes such as PETase and MHETase, can be subject to catabolite repression; the presence of a preferred carbon source can suppress expression of the PET-degrading machinery, further impairing the intended enrichment.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A (rich medium, no PET): Provides abundant alternative carbon and no PET. Many fast-growing heterotrophs will grow ($\\mu>0$), PET-degraders are neither selected nor induced. This does not enrich for PET degradation.\n- Option B (minimal medium with glucose and PET): Glucose permits growth of non-PET-degraders ($\\mu>0$) and likely outcompetes PET-degraders; glucose can also cause catabolite repression of PET-degrading enzymes, reducing PET utilization. This weakens or eliminates selection for PET degradation.\n- Option C (minimal medium with finely powdered PET as the sole carbon source): Only organisms able to utilize PET will have $\\mu>0$. Finely powdered PET increases surface area, improving accessibility and degradation rates. This is the correct application of enrichment culture to select PET-degraders.\n- Option D (no carbon source): With no carbon, $\\mu=0$ for all organisms, so nothing grows and no enrichment occurs.\n- Option E (glucose only): Selects for glucose-utilizing heterotrophs, not PET-degraders.\n\nTherefore, the most effective application of the enrichment culture principle is to use the minimal medium with finely powdered PET as the sole carbon source.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070714"}]}
