This exercise challenges you to apply the most basic principles of the three-domain system by identifying the cellular features common to all prokaryotes.

Using remote microscopy and biochemical analysis, they have characterized a unicellular life form. Their observations are as follows:\n\n1.  The cell lacks a membrane-bound nucleus; its genetic material consists of a single circular chromosome located in a cytoplasmic region known as the nucleoid.\n2.  The cell does not possess any membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, or an endoplasmic reticulum.\n3.  The ribosomes present in the cell have a sedimentation coefficient of $70\\text{S}$ and are found freely suspended in the cytoplasm.\n\nBased strictly on this set of observations, which of the following domains of life could this organism be classified into?

Plantae", "solution": "We analyze each observation against defining cellular features of the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, then determine which domains are consistent.\n\n1. The absence of a membrane-bound nucleus and the presence of a single circular chromosome localized to a nucleoid region are core characteristics of prokaryotes. Both Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotic and share these features. Eukarya are excluded because they possess a membrane-bound nucleus and typically linear chromosomes.\n\n2. The lack of membrane-bound organelles (mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum) is characteristic of prokaryotes. Both Bacteria and Archaea lack these organelles. Eukarya, including the kingdom Plantae, possess such organelles; thus Eukarya and Plantae are excluded by this criterion.\n\n3. The presence of $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes freely suspended in the cytoplasm is a hallmark of prokaryotes. Bacteria and Archaea have $70\\text{S}$ cytoplasmic ribosomes. In contrast, eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes are $80\\text{S}$; while eukaryotes do contain $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes, they are confined within mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are absent here. Therefore, this observation further excludes Eukarya (and by extension Plantae).\n\nCombining these three independent prokaryotic indicators, the organism must belong to a prokaryotic domain. Both Bacteria and Archaea fit all the given observations, and no distinguishing features between them (such as peptidoglycan cell wall composition, ether- versus ester-linked membrane lipids, or distinctive transcription/translation machinery) are provided.

This practice moves beyond general cell structure to the specific biochemical and genetic markers that define these two distinct evolutionary lineages.

Initial light microscopy suggests it is a simple organism, possibly a yeast or a protist. To determine its classification within the three-domain system, the student performs a series of advanced analyses. The results are summarized below:\n\n1.  **Microscopy:** Transmission electron microscopy reveals the absence of a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles like mitochondria or chloroplasts.\n2.  **Biochemistry:** The organism possesses a cell wall. However, treatment with lysozyme, an enzyme that specifically cleaves the $\\beta$-(1,4)-glycosidic linkages in peptidoglycan, fails to cause cell lysis.\n3.  **Lipid Analysis:** Chemical analysis of the cell membrane indicates that the hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids are attached to the glycerol backbone via ether linkages, not ester linkages.\n4.  **Genetics:** The organism's chromosome is circular. Analysis reveals the presence of proteins, structurally similar to eukaryotic histones, that are involved in compacting the genetic material.\n5.  **Ribosome Analysis:** The ribosomes isolated from the cytoplasm have a sedimentation coefficient of $70\\text{S}$.\n\nBased on this complete set of observations, what is the most accurate classification for this microbe?\n\nA. A member of the Domain Bacteria.\n\nB. A member of the Domain Archaea.\n\nC. A member of the Kingdom Fungi (Domain Eukarya).\n\nD. A protist (Domain Eukarya).\n\nE. A previously unknown type of virus.", "solution": "We begin by interpreting each observation in terms of the three-domain system.\n\nFrom transmission electron microscopy showing the absence of a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, the organism is a prokaryote. Therefore, it is not a eukaryote, which excludes both fungi and protists. It is also not a virus because viruses are acellular, lack ribosomes and cell walls of the described type, and do not show the cellular features reported here.\n\nThe organism possesses a cell wall, but lysozyme treatment fails to cause lysis. Lysozyme specifically cleaves the $\\beta$-(1,4)-glycosidic linkage between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid in peptidoglycan. Resistance to lysozyme therefore indicates that the wall is not typical bacterial peptidoglycan. This is consistent with archaeal cell walls, which may contain pseudomurein with $\\beta$-(1,3) linkages and different sugar composition, or proteinaceous S-layers, both of which are not substrates for lysozyme.\n\nThe lipid analysis shows ether linkages between hydrocarbon chains and glycerol. This is a hallmark of archaeal membranes, which have ether-linked isoprenoid chains, whereas bacteria and eukaryotes typically have ester-linked fatty acids.\n\nThe genetics show a circular chromosome, which is consistent with both Bacteria and Archaea, but the presence of proteins structurally similar to eukaryotic histones used to compact DNA is characteristic of Archaea and not typical of Bacteria.\n\nThe ribosome sedimentation coefficient is $70\\text{S}$, which is characteristic of prokaryotic cytosolic ribosomes (both Bacteria and Archaea), whereas eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes are $80\\text{S}$.\n\nIntegrating all findings: prokaryotic cell structure, lysozyme-resistant cell wall, ether-linked membrane lipids, histone-like DNA-packaging proteins, and $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes uniquely and jointly support classification within Domain Archaea. The high-salinity origin further aligns with many halophilic archaea.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate classification is Domain Archaea.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2101181"}, {"introduction": "The story of microbial evolution is not always a simple branching tree; a process called horizontal gene transfer (HGT) allows organisms to share genetic material across domain boundaries. This practice explores a fascinating and realistic scenario where an organism possesses a mosaic of features, with a core bacterial lineage but key adaptive genes from an archaeal source. This exercise will deepen your understanding of how HGT shapes microbial adaptation and complicates straightforward classification, reflecting a key concept in modern genomics [@problem_id:2101164].", "problem": "A microbiologist isolates a novel microorganism from a hydrothermal vent environment where water temperatures consistently exceed 85 °C. An initial analysis reveals the following characteristics: the cell wall contains peptidoglycan, and the cell membrane is composed of fatty acids linked to glycerol by ester bonds. Based on these features, the organism is preliminarily classified within the domain Bacteria.\n\nFurther genomic analysis is conducted. The complete genome is sequenced, and researchers are particularly interested in the genes responsible for the organism's thermotolerance. They identify genes for a heat-stable DNA polymerase and a set of chaperone proteins. A search using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) reveals that the nucleotide sequences of these specific genes show over 95% identity with homologous genes from thermophilic organisms in the domain Archaea, such as *Sulfolobus solfataricus*. In contrast, the highest identity found for these genes when compared to any other known bacterial species is less than 60%. However, the analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the vast majority of other housekeeping genes firmly places the organism within the bacterial domain.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most scientifically sound explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The three-domain system of classification is incorrect, and this organism demonstrates that Bacteria and Archaea represent a single, continuous evolutionary lineage.\n\nB. The initial classification was wrong; the presence of peptidoglycan and ester-linked lipids must be an anomaly, and the organism is, in fact, an archaeon.\n\nC. The high sequence identity is a result of convergent evolution, where selective pressures in the hot environment independently drove the bacterial and archaeal genes to evolve nearly identical sequences.\n\nD. The bacterium likely acquired the genes for thermotolerance from an archaeal donor through horizontal gene transfer.\n\nE. The heat-stable proteins in the bacterium are non-functional artifacts of the genome and do not contribute to its survival, making their origin irrelevant to its phenotype.", "solution": "We analyze the evidence in a stepwise manner, comparing domain-level traits, phylogenetic markers, and gene-specific similarity, and then evaluate each proposed explanation against established biological principles.\n\nFirst, domain-level cell biology: the organism has a cell wall with peptidoglycan and a membrane with fatty acids linked to glycerol by ester bonds. These are canonical bacterial features. In contrast, Archaea typically have ether-linked isoprenoid lipids and lack peptidoglycan, instead having pseudopeptidoglycan or S-layers. Thus, the observed cell envelope chemistry supports a bacterial classification.\n\nSecond, phylogenetic placement by conserved markers: analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the vast majority of housekeeping genes places the organism within Bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene is a standard phylogenetic marker for deep lineage assignment, and housekeeping genes reinforce this placement. Therefore, the organism’s core genome aligns with Bacteria.\n\nThird, gene-specific similarity for thermotolerance genes: the heat-stable DNA polymerase and chaperone genes show about 0.95 nucleotide identity to archaeal homologs from thermophiles such as Sulfolobus, while the highest identity to any bacterial homologs is less than 0.60. This pattern is highly asymmetric and gene-specific, affecting thermotolerance-related genes but not core phylogenetic markers.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA. Reject. Mosaic genomes due to gene flow do not invalidate the three-domain system; core phylogenetic markers (16S rRNA, housekeeping genes) still group the organism with Bacteria. Domain-level classification is based on the evolutionary history of core genes and cellular traits, both of which point to Bacteria.\n\nB. Reject. The biochemical traits (peptidoglycan, ester-linked fatty acids) and core genes are bacterial. Calling them anomalies contradicts multiple independent lines of evidence. There is no need to overturn the consistent bacterial signatures.\n\nC. Reject. Convergent evolution rarely produces near-identical nucleotide sequences across whole genes. Convergence typically operates at the protein functional level and yields similarity in specific amino acids or motifs, not about 0.95 identity at the nucleotide level, especially across synonymous sites and noncoding regions where selection is weaker. Achieving roughly 0.95 nucleotide identity independently is exceedingly unlikely.\n\nD. Accept. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an archaeal donor provides a parsimonious explanation: in high-temperature environments where Bacteria and Archaea co-occur, gene exchange can transfer adaptive functions such as thermotolerance. The specificity of the archaeal-like signal to thermotolerance genes, contrasted with bacterial identity of 16S rRNA and housekeeping genes, is exactly the signature expected from HGT.\n\nE. Reject. The organism inhabits high-temperature environments, and the identified genes encode known thermotolerance functions (heat-stable DNA polymerase and chaperones). These are unlikely to be nonfunctional artifacts; they plausibly contribute to survival. Moreover, even if they were nonfunctional, that would not explain the approximately 0.95 identity to archaeal genes.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound explanation is that the bacterium acquired the thermotolerance genes from an archaeal donor via horizontal gene transfer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2101164"}]}
