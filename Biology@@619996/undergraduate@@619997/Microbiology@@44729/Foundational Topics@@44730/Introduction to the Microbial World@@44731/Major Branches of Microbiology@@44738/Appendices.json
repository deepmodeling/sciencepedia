This bacterium uses a cell-density-dependent communication system called Quorum Sensing (QS) to coordinate gene expression, leading to the formation of resilient biofilms on surfaces. The team has synthesized a novel Quorum Sensing Inhibitor (QSI), designated XA-22, which is soluble in Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO).\n\nTo test the efficacy of XA-22, a classic biofilm quantification assay was performed using a 96-well Microtiter Plate (MTP). Wells were prepared under different conditions, inoculated with *P. aeruginosa* (except for the negative control), and incubated to allow for biofilm formation. After incubation, the plates were washed to remove non-adherent bacteria, and the remaining biofilm was stained with crystal violet. The dye was then solubilized, and the amount of biofilm was quantified by measuring the Optical Density (OD) at a wavelength of 595 nm. A higher OD value corresponds to a greater amount of biofilm.\n\nThe following average OD readings were obtained:\n- **Negative Control:** Sterile growth medium alone. This measures background staining of the plastic. OD = 0.082.\n- **Vehicle Control:** *P. aeruginosa* in growth medium with DMSO added at the same volume used for the test compound. This serves as the reference for 100% biofilm formation. OD = 1.457.\n- **Test Condition:** *P. aeruginosa* in growth medium with 75 µM of XA-22 dissolved in DMSO. OD = 0.425.\n\nBased on this experimental data, calculate the percentage of biofilm inhibition achieved by 75 µM of XA-22.
