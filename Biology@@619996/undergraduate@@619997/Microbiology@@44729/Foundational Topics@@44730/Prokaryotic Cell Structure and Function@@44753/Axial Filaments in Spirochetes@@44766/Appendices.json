This scenario presents a spirochete with a hypothetical mutation that makes its outer sheath rigid, challenging you to consider why the flexibility of the cell body is just as crucial as the rotation of the axial filaments. Understanding this relationship reveals that spirochete propulsion is a sophisticated, whole-cell phenomenon. [@problem_id:2055357]", "problem": "Spirochetes are a phylum of bacteria characterized by their long, helical shape and a unique mechanism of motility. Their structure consists of a central protoplasmic cylinder, which is also helical, surrounded by a cell membrane and a peptidoglycan cell wall. Within the periplasmic space, located between the protoplasmic cylinder and an outer sheath, are specialized flagella known as axial filaments or endoflagella. These filaments are anchored at each pole of the cell and extend towards the opposite end. The rotation of these axial filaments within the periplasm generates torque. In a normal, wild-type spirochete, the flexibility of the protoplasmic cylinder and outer sheath allows this torque to cause the entire cell to twist, resulting in a corkscrew-like motion that propels the bacterium forward, especially through viscous environments.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of a spirochete. This strain possesses a mutation that leads to excessive cross-linking of proteins within its outer sheath, making the sheath significantly more rigid and resistant to bending and twisting. The axial filaments, including their motor proteins and power source, are entirely unaffected by the mutation and function normally.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the motility of this mutant spirochete compared to its wild-type counterpart?\n\nA. The cell will exhibit faster forward motion because the rigid sheath acts as a more efficient propeller.\n\nB. The cell will rotate about its long axis but will show little to no forward (translational) movement.\n\nC. The cell's motility will be unaffected, as the axial filaments are still functioning normally.\n\nD. The cell will move in a straight line instead of a corkscrew path, but at the same speed.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of a rigid outer sheath on the motility of a spirochete, given that its internal axial filaments function correctly.\n\nFirst, let's establish the normal mechanism of spirochete motility. The key components are the helical protoplasmic cylinder, the axial filaments (endoflagella) located in the periplasm, and the outer sheath. The axial filaments are anchored at the ends of the cell and rotate. This rotation generates a torque.\n\nThe crucial feature for spirochete propulsion is the flexibility of the entire cell body, particularly the protoplasmic cylinder and the outer sheath. When the internal axial filaments rotate in one direction, they exert a torque on the flexible, helical cell cylinder. By Newton's third law, the cell cylinder and outer sheath are compelled to rotate in the opposite direction. Because the cell is a flexible helix, this counter-rotation does not just spin the cell in place like a rigid rod. Instead, it causes the entire cell to twist and undulate, propagating a wave along its length. This corkscrew-like motion is what efficiently propels the spirochete through its environment.\n\nNow, let's consider the mutant described in the problem. The mutation causes the outer sheath to become significantly more rigid. The axial filaments still rotate normally, meaning they continue to generate torque.\n\nWhen these functional axial filaments rotate inside the now-rigid outer sheath, they still exert a torque on the cell body. However, because the outer sheath (and thus the entire cell structure) is now rigid and resistant to twisting and bending, it can no longer deform into the characteristic corkscrew wave. Instead of flexing, the now-rigid helical cell will behave more like a solid object. The torque from the internal flagella will cause the entire rigid cell body to rotate about its long axis in the opposite direction.\n\nThis rotation about its long axis, without the concurrent flexing and undulation, does not produce effective translational propulsion. The cell will essentially spin in place, much like a typical bacterium with a flagellum whose hook protein is broken, causing the filament to be rigid. Therefore, forward movement will be severely impaired or eliminated entirely.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\nA. The cell will exhibit faster forward motion because the rigid sheath acts as a more efficient propeller. This is incorrect. The propulsive force comes from the corkscrew deformation, not from the sheath acting as a stiff paddle. A lack of flexibility prevents this deformation.\n\nB. The cell will rotate about its long axis but will show little to no forward (translational) movement. This aligns perfectly with our reasoning. The torque from the endoflagella causes the rigid cell to spin without the undulations necessary for propulsion.\n\nC. The cell's motility will be unaffected, as the axial filaments are still functioning normally. This is incorrect because it ignores the critical role of the cell body's flexibility. Motility is a coordinated effort between the motor (axial filaments) and the body (sheath and cylinder).\n\nD. The cell will move in a straight line instead of a corkscrew path, but at the same speed. This is incorrect. The corkscrew path is a consequence of the propulsion mechanism itself. Eliminating the ability to flex and twist eliminates the primary mode of propulsion, so the cell will not move forward at the same speed, if at all.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2055357"}, {"introduction": "Effective movement is not just about propulsion, but also about control and direction. This final practice advances from the 'how' of motion to the 'why' of navigation, a process known as chemotaxis. By analyzing a mutant that can only move forward, you will explore the fundamental strategy bacteria use to reorient themselves and purposefully seek out favorable environments. [@problem_id:2055412]", "problem": "Spirochetes are a phylum of distinctive Gram-negative bacteria, known for their long, spiral-shaped cells. Their motility is driven by a unique structure called an axial filament, or endoflagellum. Unlike the external flagella of other bacteria, the axial filaments of spirochetes are located in the periplasmic space, anchored at each pole of the cell and running lengthwise between the inner plasma membrane and the flexible outer sheath. The rotation of these internal filaments causes the entire flexible cell to twist, resulting in a corkscrew-like motion that is highly effective for moving through viscous media like mud or host tissues.\n\nIn a typical wild-type spirochete, the direction of movement is controlled by switching the rotational direction of the axial filaments. A counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation produces smooth forward locomotion, while a clockwise (CW) rotation causes the cell to flex and change its orientation, a behavior analogous to the \"tumble\" of a bacterium like *E. coli*.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of a pathogenic spirochete that has a defect in its flagellar motor switch. This mutation makes it impossible for the axial filaments to reverse their direction of spin; they are permanently locked into the counter-clockwise rotation that produces forward movement. Which of the following is the most direct and significant consequence of this mutation for the bacterium?\n\nA. The bacterium would be completely non-motile and unable to move.\n\nB. The bacterium could move forward, but would be unable to perform chemotaxis to navigate towards nutrients or away from repellents.\n\nC. The bacterium would be trapped in a constant state of flexing and tumbling, unable to achieve any directed forward movement.\n\nD. The bacterium's outer sheath would quickly rupture due to the continuous, unidirectional torque from the axial filaments.\n\nE. The bacterium would lose its characteristic spiral shape and become a straight rod.", "solution": "The question asks to identify the most significant consequence for a spirochete whose axial filaments can only rotate in one direction, the direction that causes forward motion. To solve this, we must analyze the role of bidirectional flagellar rotation in bacterial motility and behavior.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Wild-Type Spirochete Motility**\nNormal bacterial motility, particularly for the purpose of navigating chemical gradients (chemotaxis), is based on a \"run-and-tumble\" mechanism.\n*   **The \"Run\":** A period of smooth, directional movement. In spirochetes, this is achieved by the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of the axial filaments, which drives the cell forward in a corkscrew-like motion.\n*   **The \"Tumble\" (or \"Flex\"):** A period of reorientation. By reversing the flagellar rotation to clockwise (CW), the spirochete's regular corkscrew motion is disrupted. The cell ceases its forward progress and undergoes a flexing or writhing motion. This randomizes its orientation. When it resumes the \"run,\" it will be heading in a new direction.\n\n**Step 2: Connect Motility to Chemotaxis**\nChemotaxis is the directed movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus. Bacteria achieve this by modulating the frequency of their \"tumbles.\"\n*   When moving towards a chemical attractant (or away from a repellent), the bacterium suppresses its tumbling frequency, leading to longer, uninterrupted runs in the favorable direction.\n*   If the bacterium senses it is moving away from the attractant, it increases its tumbling frequency, allowing it to reorient more often until it finds a better path.\nCrucially, this entire system depends on the ability to switch between the \"run\" state and the \"tumble\" state.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mutant's Condition**\nThe problem states that the mutant spirochete has its axial filaments locked in the CCW rotation. Based on the description, this is the rotation that produces the \"run\" phase (smooth forward locomotion). The mutation has eliminated the ability to perform the CW rotation, which is responsible for the \"tumble\" or \"flex\" phase.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Consequence**\nWithout the ability to perform the \"tumble\" or \"flex,\" the mutant spirochete loses its mechanism for reorientation. It can still execute a \"run\" and therefore move forward. However, it cannot willfully change its direction. If it starts moving in a random direction, it will continue in that direction indefinitely. It cannot respond to a chemical gradient because it lacks the ability to reorient and seek a better path. This inability to modulate its direction in response to chemical cues means it cannot perform chemotaxis.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A. The bacterium would be completely non-motile and unable to move.** This is incorrect. The axial filaments are still rotating, which will produce motion. The problem is one of control, not of a complete lack of movement.\n*   **B. The bacterium could move forward, but would be unable to perform chemotaxis to navigate towards nutrients or away from repellents.** This is correct. The mutant can \"run\" but cannot \"tumble/flex.\" The loss of the reorientation mechanism makes chemotaxis impossible. This is a highly significant consequence for survival.\n*   **C. The bacterium would be trapped in a constant state of flexing and tumbling, unable to achieve any directed forward movement.** This is incorrect. The flexing/tumbling state is caused by the CW rotation, which this mutant is incapable of performing. The mutant is locked in the forward \"run\" state.\n*   **D. The bacterium's outer sheath would quickly rupture due to the continuous, unidirectional torque from the axial filaments.** This is unlikely. The cell is structurally adapted to withstand the forces of normal rotation. Continuous rotation in one direction is not inherently more stressful than the back-and-forth switching of a wild-type cell. The primary consequence is behavioral, not structural.\n*   **E. The bacterium would lose its characteristic spiral shape and become a straight rod.** This is incorrect. The spiral shape is a fundamental aspect of the cell's peptidoglycan structure and cytoskeleton. The motility apparatus (axial filaments) does not determine the basic morphology of the cell.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant consequence is the loss of chemotactic ability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2055412"}]}
