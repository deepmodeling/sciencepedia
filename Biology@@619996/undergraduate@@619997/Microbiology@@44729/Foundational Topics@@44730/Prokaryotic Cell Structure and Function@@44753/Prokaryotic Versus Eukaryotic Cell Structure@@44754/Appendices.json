{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most fundamental differences between cell types lies in their external boundaries. This exercise challenges you to connect the absence of a peptidoglycan cell wall in a prokaryote to two key observable characteristics: its physical shape and its response to antibiotics like penicillin. By solving this, you will reinforce your understanding of why the cell wall is a cornerstone of bacterial identity and a prime target for antimicrobial drugs [@problem_id:2090168].", "problem": "A microbiologist isolates a novel pathogenic microorganism from a patient with an atypical respiratory infection. Microscopic examination reveals that the organism is a prokaryote but lacks a consistent, defined shape, appearing pleomorphic. Laboratory tests show that the organism is completely unaffected by high concentrations of penicillin, an antibiotic known to inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Based on these observations, which of the following is the most likely structural characteristic of this pathogen?\n\nA. The organism lacks a peptidoglycan cell wall.\nB. The organism possesses a Gram-negative type outer membrane.\nC. The organism possesses a thick, Gram-positive type peptidoglycan layer.\nD. The organism lacks functional ribosomes.\nE. The organism is surrounded by a thick polysaccharide capsule.", "solution": "Penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting transpeptidase enzymes that catalyze cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall. Therefore, organisms that lack peptidoglycan have no target for penicillin and are intrinsically resistant, even at high concentrations. Additionally, the rigid cell wall normally maintains a consistent cellular morphology; absence of a cell wall leads to pleomorphism due to loss of structural rigidity. A well-known example is Mycoplasma species, which are prokaryotes that lack a peptidoglycan cell wall, are intrinsically resistant to beta-lactams, and cause atypical respiratory infections.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A directly explains both penicillin insensitivity and pleomorphic morphology by absence of peptidoglycan.\n- B implies a Gram-negative envelope that still contains a peptidoglycan layer and does not inherently confer complete insensitivity to penicillin.\n- C implies a thick peptidoglycan layer, which would typically increase susceptibility to penicillin.\n- D is incompatible with life for a prokaryote, as ribosomes are essential for protein synthesis.\n- E does not account for intrinsic beta-lactam resistance or pleomorphism, as a capsule is independent of peptidoglycan synthesis.\n\nThus, the most likely structural characteristic is the lack of a peptidoglycan cell wall.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090168"}, {"introduction": "Eukaryotic cells are masters of organization, packaging key metabolic processes into separate organelles, a feature largely absent in prokaryotes. This practice puts you in the role of a biochemist, asking you to interpret classic experimental data from cell fractionation to determine the location of the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle. Your analysis of where a radioactive tracer, $^{14}\\text{C}$, accumulates will reveal a fundamental distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic metabolic architecture [@problem_id:2090207].", "problem": "A microbiologist discovers a novel, motile, unicellular organism in a soil sample. To begin its classification, a biochemical experiment is designed to determine the subcellular location of its central metabolic pathways. The organism is cultured in a defined liquid medium where glucose is the sole carbon source. The glucose provided is uniformly labeled with the radioactive isotope Carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$).\n\nAfter a sufficient incubation period to allow for active metabolism, the cells are harvested and gently lysed to release their internal contents while minimizing damage to organelles. The resulting cell lysate is then subjected to a differential centrifugation protocol, which separates components based on size and density, yielding four distinct fractions:\n\n- **Fraction P1 (low-speed pellet):** Predominantly contains any unbroken cells, nuclei, and major cytoskeletal elements.\n- **Fraction P2 (medium-speed pellet):** Enriched in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lysosomes, if present.\n- **Fraction P3 (high-speed pellet):** Enriched in microsomes (fragments of endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane) and ribosomes.\n- **Fraction S3 (final supernatant):** Represents the soluble cytosolic fraction of the cell.\n\nThe specific radioactivity of citrate, a key intermediate of the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), is then measured in each fraction. The experimental results reveal that over 95% of the total recovered radioactive citrate is located in Fraction S3.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely classification of this organism and the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The organism is a eukaryote, as the TCA cycle enzymes must be located in soluble form within the mitochondrial matrix, which was evidently ruptured.\nB. The organism is a prokaryote, as the enzymes of the TCA cycle are located in the cytoplasm, which corresponds to the soluble cytosolic fraction.\nC. The organism is a eukaryote, as the data indicates that glycolysis and the TCA cycle both occur in the cytosol.\nD. The organism is a prokaryote, as the TCA cycle enzymes are bound to the plasma membrane, which fragments into soluble components during lysis.\nE. The results are inconclusive, as the high concentration of a metabolic intermediate in the cytosol provides no clear information about the organism's fundamental cell structure.", "solution": "The experiment tracks the fate of uniformly Carbon-14 labeled glucose across subcellular fractions after gentle lysis and differential centrifugation. Uniform labeling ensures that any actively used pathway incorporating glucose carbons will yield labeled intermediates, such as citrate from the TCA cycle.\n\nDifferential centrifugation yields the following operational compartments:\n- P1: unbroken cells and large structures (e.g., nuclei and cytoskeleton).\n- P2: mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes (if present).\n- P3: microsomes (ER and plasma membrane fragments) and ribosomes.\n- S3: soluble cytosol.\n\nIn a eukaryote, the TCA cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix. Under gentle lysis designed to preserve organelle integrity, matrix contents such as citrate should remain within intact mitochondria and therefore co-sediment into P2. Thus, if the organism were a typical eukaryote with intact mitochondria, the labeled citrate would be expected predominantly in P2, not in S3.\n\nThe observation that more than 0.95 of the total recovered radioactive citrate is found in S3 indicates that the citrate is present in the soluble cytosolic fraction rather than within intact organelles. The most parsimonious explanation is that the organism lacks mitochondria, placing the TCA cycle in the cytoplasm, which is characteristic of prokaryotes. While one could propose widespread mitochondrial rupture to explain cytosolic citrate in a eukaryote, this contradicts the gentle lysis condition whose purpose is to minimize organelle disruption and would be an unnecessary assumption when a simpler explanation (absence of mitochondria) fits the data.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is not supported because it requires assuming extensive mitochondrial rupture; gentle lysis aims to avoid this, and classification should not rely on that assumption when a simpler, standard localization pattern explains the data.\n- B is correct because in prokaryotes the TCA cycle enzymes reside in the cytoplasm, so citrate would be in S3.\n- C is incorrect because in eukaryotes the TCA cycle does not occur in the cytosol.\n- D is incorrect because TCA enzymes in prokaryotes are generally soluble cytosolic enzymes, not plasma membrane-bound.\n- E is incorrect because the dominant presence of citrate in S3 is informative about the absence of mitochondria and thus supports a prokaryotic classification.\n\nTherefore, the data most strongly support that the organism is a prokaryote with cytosolic TCA cycle enzymes, matching option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2090207"}, {"introduction": "The divergence between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is profound, extending to the very way they process genetic information from DNA to protein. This problem explores the process of RNA splicing, a crucial editing step that is a hallmark of eukaryotic gene expression. By predicting the effect of a hypothetical drug that inhibits this machinery, you'll grasp why the presence of introns and spliceosomes represents a critical divide between the domains of life and offers a powerful target for selective therapies [@problem_id:2090170].", "problem": "A new antibiotic compound, \"Intronasiv,\" is being investigated for its mechanism of action. Laboratory analysis demonstrates that it functions by binding irreversibly to key spliceosomal proteins, thereby completely blocking the assembly of the spliceosome on primary RNA transcripts. To assess its potential as a selective therapeutic agent, a researcher prepares two separate liquid cultures, one of the bacterium *Escherichia coli* and one of the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Both cultures are in the exponential growth phase. The researcher then adds a sufficient concentration of Intronasiv to both cultures to ensure complete inhibition of all spliceosomal activity. Assume the compound readily enters both cell types and has no other off-target effects.\n\nBased on your understanding of prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecular biology, which of the following outcomes most accurately predicts the immediate effect of the compound on protein synthesis in the two cultures?\n\nA. Protein synthesis will halt almost immediately in both the *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiae* cultures.\nB. Protein synthesis in the *E. coli* culture will cease, while protein synthesis in the *S. cerevisiae* culture will continue, but produce larger, non-functional proteins.\nC. Protein synthesis in the *E. coli* culture will be largely unaffected, while the production of the vast majority of proteins in the *S. cerevisiae* culture will be halted.\nD. Protein synthesis in the *S. cerevisiae* culture will be largely unaffected, while protein synthesis in the *E. coli* culture will be halted.\nE. Both cultures will continue to synthesize proteins, but at a significantly reduced rate due to metabolic stress.", "solution": "The compound is specified to irreversibly block assembly of the spliceosome by binding spliceosomal proteins. The spliceosome is a eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein complex that recognizes splice sites on pre-mRNA and catalyzes intron removal to produce mature mRNA. Mature, properly processed mRNA is generally required for nuclear export, stability, and efficient translation in eukaryotes. Therefore, blocking spliceosome assembly prevents splicing of pre-mRNA, leading to failure of maturation and nuclear export for intron-containing transcripts; these pre-mRNAs are typically retained and degraded, so translation from these transcripts will not occur.\n\nEscherichia coli is a prokaryote and lacks a spliceosome. Prokaryotic genes generally do not contain introns, and transcription and translation are coupled in the cytoplasm. Thus, a compound that specifically inhibits the spliceosome will have no primary target in E. coli, so protein synthesis in E. coli will be largely unaffected under the stated assumption of no off-target effects.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a eukaryote that uses the spliceosome to process intron-containing pre-mRNAs. Inhibition of spliceosome assembly will prevent splicing, thereby blocking production of mature mRNA from intron-containing genes and halting translation of those gene products. While some yeast genes are intronless and could still be translated from existing mature mRNAs, many essential and highly expressed genes (notably numerous ribosomal protein genes) require splicing; blocking splicing thus halts production of a large fraction of proteins and severely impairs overall protein synthesis. Existing cytoplasmic mature mRNAs may transiently support some translation, but the immediate mechanistic effect of the drug is to stop new production of mature mRNA for intron-containing genes, leading to a rapid and profound inhibition of protein synthesis in the yeast culture.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because E. coli lacks a spliceosome, so its protein synthesis would not halt due to spliceosome inhibition.\n- B is incorrect because E. coli should be unaffected, and unspliced pre-mRNAs in yeast are not typically translated into larger proteins; they are retained and degraded rather than exported for translation.\n- C is correct: protein synthesis in E. coli is largely unaffected, whereas production of the vast majority of proteins in S. cerevisiae (those requiring splicing-dependent mRNAs) is halted.\n- D is the inverse of the correct pattern and is incorrect.\n- E is incorrect because the described effect is not a nonspecific metabolic stress but a specific block of splicing, which would not reduce E. coli translation but would severely impair yeast protein synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that E. coli protein synthesis is largely unaffected, while yeast protein synthesis is halted for the majority of proteins that require splicing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2090170"}]}
