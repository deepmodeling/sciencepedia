The student prepares two separate test tubes.\n\n- **Tube A**: Contains a uniform suspension of *Mycobacterium smegmatis* in a standard aqueous buffer, appearing uniformly turbid.\n- **Tube B**: Contains a uniform suspension of *Staphylococcus aureus* in the same aqueous buffer, also appearing uniformly turbid.\n\nTo each tube, an equal volume of hexadecane, a non-polar hydrocarbon solvent that is immiscible with and less dense than the aqueous buffer, is added. The hexadecane forms a clear layer on top of the bacterial suspension in each tube. Both tubes are then sealed and vortexed vigorously for one minute to create an emulsion, forcing the interaction between the bacterial cells and the two solvent phases. Finally, the tubes are left to stand undisturbed on a rack for 30 minutes, allowing the hexadecane and aqueous buffer to completely separate back into two distinct layers.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the expected appearance of the two tubes after the phases have separated?\n\nA. In both tubes, the bacteria remain fully suspended in the lower aqueous phase, and the upper hexadecane layer is clear.\nB. In Tube A (*Mycobacterium*), the bacteria have partitioned into the upper hexadecane layer, making it turbid, while the lower aqueous phase has become clear. In Tube B (*Staphylococcus*), the bacteria remain in the lower aqueous phase, which stays turbid.\nC.

In both tubes, the bacteria form a thick, aggregated layer at the interface between the upper hexadecane and lower aqueous phases, with both phases appearing clear.\n\n", "solution": "1) Physical setup and properties:\n- Two immiscible liquids are present after separation: an upper hexadecane layer (non-polar, less dense) and a lower aqueous buffer (polar, more dense). This is determined by relative density and immiscibility principles from physical chemistry.\n- Upon vortexing, an emulsion forces bacteria to contact both phases. After standing, phases separate and bacteria partition according to their surface hydrophobicity.\n\n2) Biological surface chemistry principle:\n- Mycobacterium smegmatis has a cell envelope rich in mycolic acids and complex lipids, conferring high surface hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic particles preferentially associate with non-polar solvents due to favorable hydrophobic interactions and minimization of interfacial free energy at the aqueous interface.\n- Staphylococcus aureus, although Gram-positive with a thick peptidoglycan layer and surface proteins, is comparatively less hydrophobic than mycobacteria and remains more compatible with the polar aqueous phase.\n\n3) Partitioning prediction based on hydrophobicity:\n- For a hydrophobic cell surface, the thermodynamically favored state is association with the non-polar solvent, so cells transfer into the hexadecane layer after mixing and remain there after phase separation, rendering the hexadecane turbid and the aqueous phase clear.\n- For a relatively hydrophilic cell surface, the favored state is retention in the aqueous phase, leaving the aqueous phase turbid and the hexadecane clear.\n\n4) Tube-specific outcomes:\n- Tube A (Mycobacterium smegmatis): Cells partition into hexadecane, making the upper layer turbid; the lower aqueous phase becomes clear.\n- Tube B (Staphylococcus aureus): Cells remain in the aqueous phase, leaving the lower layer turbid; the upper hexadecane remains clear.\n\n5) Match to options:\n- This outcome corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "The structural integrity of the mycolic acid layer is directly responsible for two of the most critical phenotypes of mycobacteria: acid-fastness in diagnostics and intrinsic antibiotic resistance. This practice presents a scenario where mycolic acid transport is defective, challenging you to deduce the consequences [@problem_id:2082345]. Successfully analyzing this mutant's phenotype will solidify your understanding of the direct link between the cell wall's molecular architecture and its function in pathogenesis and clinical identification.", "id": "2082345", "problem": "A research team is investigating a mutant strain of *Mycobacterium smegmatis*, a non-pathogenic relative of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. This mutant has a specific genetic defect in a protein essential for transporting mycolic acids from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the cell envelope, where they are attached to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex. When characterized, the mutant strain exhibits two distinct phenotypes compared to the wild-type: (1) it can be readily decolorized by acid-alcohol in the Ziehl-Neelsen staining procedure, and (2) it shows significantly increased susceptibility to the antibiotic rifampicin, a drug which must enter the cell to inhibit its target, RNA polymerase.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for the simultaneous loss of acid-fastness and increased drug susceptibility in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The mycolic acids that fail to be transported accumulate in the cytoplasm, exerting a toxic effect that disrupts both the cell membrane's integrity and the binding of the stain.\nB. The mutation prevents the proper formation of the outer, waxy mycolate layer, which is the structure responsible for both retaining the primary dye during acid-fast staining and creating a low-permeability barrier that impedes drug entry.\nC. The transport defect triggers a stress response that shuts down the synthesis of peptidoglycan, the primary structural component responsible for retaining stains and resisting drug influx.\nD. Rifampicin's primary mechanism of action involves binding to the mycolic acid transporter; therefore, a defective transporter binds the drug more tightly, increasing its efficacy.\nE. The absence of mycolic acids on the cell surface alters the overall electrical charge of the cell, which repels the basic fuchsine dye used in staining and attracts the rifampicin molecules.\n\n", "solution": "The mutant is defined by a defect in a protein required to transport mycolic acids from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the cell envelope, where they are normally covalently attached to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex. In wild-type mycobacteria, these very long-chain mycolic acids constitute the outer, waxy mycomembrane that overlays the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan and confers two key properties: retention of the primary dye during acid-fast staining and formation of a low-permeability diffusion barrier to many hydrophobic drugs.\n\nFirst, consider acid-fast staining. The Ziehl-Neelsen procedure uses carbol fuchsin as the primary dye, which penetrates the lipid-rich wall (often aided by heat) and is retained due to strong interactions with the abundant mycolic acids. The subsequent acid-alcohol decolorizer removes dye from organisms lacking this waxy layer. Therefore, loss or improper assembly of the mycolic acid outer layer leads directly to easy decolorization by acid-alcohol, i.e., loss of acid-fastness.\n\nSecond, consider rifampicin susceptibility. Rifampicin must traverse the envelope to reach and inhibit its intracellular target, RNA polymerase. The mycolate-rich outer layer normally acts as a hydrophobic, low-permeability barrier that significantly impedes antibiotic entry. If mycolic acids fail to be transported and attached, the outer mycolate layer is not properly formed, the permeability barrier is weakened, and rifampicin can enter more readily, increasing susceptibility.\n\nThese two phenotypes—loss of acid-fastness and increased drug susceptibility—thus share the same direct structural cause: failure to form the outer mycolate layer. This is exactly captured by option B.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons. Option A incorrectly attributes both phenotypes to cytoplasmic toxicity and membrane disruption; acid-fastness depends on the mycolate-rich cell envelope rather than the cytoplasmic membrane, and increased drug susceptibility is most parsimoniously explained by loss of the permeability barrier. Option C misassigns the key structural determinant: peptidoglycan is not the primary structure responsible for acid-fast dye retention or for the low-permeability properties characteristic of mycobacteria. Option D is false because rifampicin’s mechanism is inhibition of RNA polymerase, not binding to a mycolic acid transporter. Option E incorrectly emphasizes surface charge effects; acid-fast staining is dominated by the hydrophobic mycolate interactions, and rifampicin entry is governed by permeability of the mycolate layer rather than electrostatic attraction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that the mutation prevents proper formation of the outer mycolate layer, accounting for both observed phenotypes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its role as a chemical barrier, the mycomembrane provides crucial mechanical strength to the bacterium.
