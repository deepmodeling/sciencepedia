The flagellar filament, a marvel of biological engineering, is assembled from thousands of individual protein subunits. This first practice provides a quantitative perspective on this process, challenging you to calculate the number of flagellin proteins required to construct a full-length filament [@problem_id:2066741]. By performing this calculation, you'll gain a tangible sense of the scale of molecular self-assembly and the investment a cell makes in creating its motility apparatus.", "problem": "The bacterium *Helicobacter pylori* utilizes several flagella to navigate the viscous environment of the human stomach. A researcher isolates one of these flagellar filaments for analysis and measures its total length, $L$, to be 15 micrometers and its diameter to be 20 nanometers. The filament is a helical polymer constructed from a single protein subunit called flagellin. Structural studies have determined that each flagellin subunit adds approximately $l = 5$ nanometers to the growing length of the filament.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of flagellin subunits required to assemble the full length of a single 15-micrometer filament. Provide your answer as a single integer.", "solution": "The number of subunits is the total filament length divided by the length added per subunit. Let $N$ be the number of subunits, $L$ the total length, and $l$ the length per subunit. Then\n$$\nN = \\frac{L}{l}.\n$$\nConvert the total length to consistent units. Since $1$ micrometer equals $10^3$ nanometers, a length of $15$ micrometers is\n$$\nL = 15 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ nm}.\n$$\nGiven $l = 5 \\text{ nm}$, compute\n$$\nN = \\frac{15 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ nm}}{5 \\text{ nm}} = 3 \\times 10^{3} = 3000.\n$$\nThe diameter is not needed for this calculation.

The specific geometry of the filament is not accidental; it is fundamental to its ability to act as a propeller. This next exercise is a thought experiment designed to isolate and understand this principle by imagining a filament that is perfectly straight and rigid [@problem_id:2066716]. By predicting the outcome, you will explore the essential link between structure and function in generating locomotive thrust at the microscopic level.", "problem": "A team of bioengineers is studying bacterial motility. They perform a genetic experiment on a species of motile bacteria, altering the gene that codes for the flagellin protein. The new, engineered flagellin subunits polymerize to form a flagellar filament that is perfectly straight and rigid, like a solid needle, instead of its normal semi-rigid helical structure. The flagellar motor within the basal body remains fully functional, capable of rotating this modified filament at the same speed as a normal one.\n\nAssuming the assembly of the rest of the flagellar apparatus (basal body, hook, etc.) is unaffected, what is the most likely consequence of this modification on the bacterium's motility?\n\nA. The bacterium will become effectively non-motile, capable only of spinning or wobbling in place without significant directional movement.\n\nB. The bacterium's swimming speed will increase because the rigid filament generates more powerful thrust than a flexible one.\n\nC.

Motility will be normal for bacteria with a single polar flagellum (monotrichous), but it will be lost for bacteria with multiple flagella (peritrichous).", "solution": "The problem asks for the consequence of replacing a bacterium's normal helical flagellar filament with a straight, rigid rod, while the motor remains functional. To solve this, we must understand the fundamental mechanism of flagellar propulsion.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Normal Flagellar Propulsion**\nBacterial motility is achieved by the rotation of the flagellar filament, which acts as a propeller. The filament is not a random, flexible string; it is a semi-rigid, helical (corkscrew-shaped) structure. The basal body acts as a rotary motor, embedded in the cell membrane. This motor imparts a rotation to the filament via the hook, a flexible universal joint. When the helical filament rotates, it pushes against the surrounding fluid medium, much like a screw turning in wood or a boat's propeller pushing against water. This interaction generates an axial thrust along the filament's axis, propelling the cell body forward (a \"run\") or pulling it backward.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Modified Flagellum**\nIn the modified bacterium, the helical filament is replaced by a perfectly straight, rigid rod. The motor still rotates this rod.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Principles of Fluid Dynamics**\nWe must consider how a rotating straight rod interacts with a fluid. A smooth, symmetric cylinder or rod rotating about its long axis will primarily just stir the fluid around it. Due to its axial symmetry, it does not create a differential pressure along its length and therefore fails to generate any significant net axial thrust. The forces exerted on the fluid are perpendicular to the axis of rotation, creating a vortex or shear in the fluid, but there is no net force component that would push or pull the cell body in a directional manner.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Consequences and the Options**\n\n*   **Consequence for Motility:** Since the rotating rigid rod cannot generate thrust, the bacterium cannot be propelled through the medium. The rotation of the rod will cause a counter-rotation in the cell body due to conservation of angular momentum. The net result is that the entire bacterium will simply spin or wobble in place, tethered by the ineffective flagellum. It is rendered effectively non-motile.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option A:** \"The bacterium will become effectively non-motile, capable only of spinning or wobbling in place without significant directional movement.\" This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The lack of thrust generation prevents propulsion.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option B:** \"The bacterium's swimming speed will increase because the rigid filament generates more powerful thrust than a flexible one.\" This is incorrect. The helical shape, not rigidity alone, is what is critical for generating thrust. A rigid rod is an extremely inefficient propeller.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option C:** \"The bacterium will only be able to move backward (\"reverse\" motility) but will be unable to move forward.\" This is incorrect. A rotating rod is equally ineffective at generating thrust in either direction. The physics of the interaction does not support unidirectional motion.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option D:** \"The bacterium will be trapped in a permanent \"running\" state, unable to perform the \"tumbles\" necessary to change direction.\" This is incorrect. The bacterium cannot perform a \"run\" in the first place because it cannot generate forward thrust. Therefore, it is not \"trapped\" in this state.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option E:** \"Motility will be normal for bacteria with a single polar flagellum (monotrichous), but it will be lost for bacteria with multiple flagella (peritrichous).\" This is incorrect. The principle of propulsion failure applies regardless of the number or arrangement of flagella. A single rotating rod is just as ineffective as multiple rotating rods. The fundamental physics of the filament-fluid interaction is the same in both cases.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe helical shape of the flagellar filament is essential for its function as a propeller. Replacing it with a straight, rigid rod eliminates the mechanism for generating axial thrust. Consequently, the bacterium loses its ability for directional movement and is rendered non-motile.

We connect a molecular defect to a macroscopic observation in this final practice, which mirrors a common experimental approach in microbiology. You will be asked to predict the growth patterns of a bacterium with a non-functional flagellin gene, linking a specific genotype to its observable phenotype in a laboratory setting [@problem_id:2066765]. This task reinforces the importance of flagella for swarming motility, a key behavior for many bacterial species.", "problem": "An experimental microbiologist is studying a motile strain of a bacterium, *Proteus mobilis*, which possesses peritrichous flagella. The gene responsible for producing the flagellin protein subunit, which polymerizes to form the flagellar filament, is designated *fliC*. The wild-type strain (WT) is known to exhibit a characteristic behavior called \"swarming motility\" on appropriate media.\n\nThe researcher creates a mutant strain (MUT) from the wild-type by introducing a frameshift mutation early in the *fliC* gene sequence. This mutation results in a truncated, completely non-functional flagellin protein.\n\nTo observe the phenotypic differences, identical small inocula of both the WT and MUT strains are placed at the center of two different types of sterile nutrient agar plates:\n1.  **Plate 1**: A standard solid nutrient agar plate (1.5% agar concentration).\n2.  **Plate 2**: A semi-solid nutrient agar \"swarm\" plate (0.3% agar concentration).\n\nBoth plates are incubated under optimal growth conditions for 24 hours. Assuming both strains have identical metabolic rates and viability in the provided nutrient medium, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the macroscopic growth patterns observed on the plates?\n\nA. On Plate 1, both strains will form small, discrete colonies at the inoculation site. On Plate 2, the WT strain will form a large, diffuse zone of growth covering much of the plate, while the MUT strain will form a small, discrete colony at the inoculation site.\n\nB. On Plate 2, both the WT and MUT strains will form large, diffuse zones of growth, as the semi-solid medium allows for passive spreading.\n\nC. Neither strain will grow on Plate 2, as the semi-solid medium is toxic to *Proteus mobilis*. The MUT strain will also fail to grow on Plate 1 due to the non-functional flagella being lethal.\n\nD. On both plates, the WT and MUT strains will form identical, small, discrete colonies at the inoculation site because motility is not a factor in colony formation.\n\nE. On Plate 2, the WT strain will form a large, diffuse zone of growth. The MUT strain will also spread, but to a lesser extent, because it can still perform the \"tumbling\" motion even without functional filaments.", "solution": "The gene $fliC$ encodes flagellin, the protein subunit that polymerizes to form the flagellar filament. In peritrichous bacteria, intact filaments are essential for both propulsion and the run-tumble behavior that underlies motility and swarming. A frameshift mutation early in $fliC$ causing a truncated, non-functional flagellin prevents assembly of filaments; without filaments, the basal body and motor cannot transmit torque to the environment, so directed motility and tumbling are abolished. The resulting phenotype is non-motile (aflagellate).\n\nAssuming identical metabolic rates and viability, differences in macroscopic growth will be determined by motility and the mechanical properties of the agar.\n\nConsider Plate 1 (1.5% agar). This standard solid medium presents a high gel strength that restricts bacterial movement. Even motile strains do not spread appreciably through such a firm matrix; instead, they form small, discrete colonies at the inoculation site as growth proceeds radially by cell division rather than directed migration. Therefore, both WT (motile) and MUT (non-motile) produce small, discrete colonies at the inoculation site on Plate 1.\n\nConsider Plate 2 (0.3% agar). This semi-solid medium permits movement of motile cells through the matrix and supports swarming or swimming, producing large, diffuse zones of growth as cells actively migrate away from the inoculation point. The WT, with functional flagella, will spread extensively, often yielding a large, diffuse zone (potentially with concentric rings). The MUT lacks functional filaments and thus cannot propel itself or perform tumbling; passive spreading sufficient to mimic swarming does not occur under these conditions. Consequently, the MUT remains near the inoculation site, forming a small, discrete colony.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A correctly states that both strains form small, discrete colonies on Plate 1; on Plate 2, the WT forms a large, diffuse zone, and the MUT remains a small colony.\n- B is incorrect because semi-solid media do not cause passive spreading sufficient to create diffuse zones for non-motile cells; active motility is required.\n- C is incorrect because semi-solid media are not toxic per se, and a $fliC$ loss-of-function is not lethal; it affects motility, not viability.\n- D is incorrect because motility is a key factor on semi-solid media, producing different macroscopic patterns.\n- E is incorrect because tumbling requires functional flagellar filaments; without filaments, neither runs nor tumbles occur, so the MUT cannot spread.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066765"}]}
