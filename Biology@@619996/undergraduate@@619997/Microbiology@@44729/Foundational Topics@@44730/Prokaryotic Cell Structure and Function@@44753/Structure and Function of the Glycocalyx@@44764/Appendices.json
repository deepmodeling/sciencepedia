This exercise utilizes the classic pathogen *Streptococcus pneumoniae* to illustrate how a well-formed capsule can be the deciding factor between a harmless bacterium and one that causes severe illness. By analyzing this scenario [@problem_id:2094298], you will apply your knowledge of bacterial structure to predict the outcome of an infection, a core skill in medical microbiology.", "problem": "A pathogenic strain of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is known to cause severe pneumonia in a mammalian host. This virulence is partly attributed to its ability to produce a thick, well-organized extracellular polysaccharide layer called a capsule, which is a type of glycocalyx. A research team creates a mutant variant of this strain by deleting the genes essential for capsule synthesis. Both the original, wild-type (encapsulated) strain and the new mutant (non-encapsulated) strain are cultured under identical optimal conditions and then introduced, in separate experiments, into healthy, immunocompetent mammalian hosts.\n\nBased on the established functions of the bacterial glycocalyx in pathogenesis, what is the most likely outcome regarding the ability of these two strains to cause disease in the hosts?\n\nA. The wild-type strain will successfully establish an infection and cause disease, whereas the mutant strain will be unable to cause disease because it will be rapidly eliminated by the host's phagocytic immune cells.\n\nB. Both the wild-type and the mutant strains will be equally effective at causing disease, as the capsule's primary function is to prevent dehydration, which is not a significant factor within the host's body.\n\nC. The mutant strain will be more virulent than the wild-type strain because the absence of the thick capsule will allow it to adhere more tightly to host tissues.\n\nD. Both strains will be unable to cause disease, as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* relies solely on producing a toxin called pneumolysin for its virulence, a process unaffected by the presence of a capsule.\n\nE. The wild-type strain will be less virulent than the mutant strain because the capsule acts as a barrier, preventing the bacterium from absorbing essential nutrients from the host environment.", "solution": "Principle: In Streptococcus pneumoniae, the extracellular polysaccharide capsule (a form of glycocalyx) is a major virulence factor. It confers antiphagocytic properties by impeding complement deposition (notably reducing effective C3b opsonization) and masking surface antigens, thereby preventing efficient recognition and ingestion by neutrophils and macrophages. In immunocompetent hosts, nonencapsulated (rough) strains are rapidly opsonized and cleared, whereas encapsulated (smooth) strains resist phagocytosis and establish infection. This is classically demonstrated by the smooth versus rough phenotype in the Griffith transformation experiments and is consistent with clinical observations, including increased susceptibility in asplenic hosts due to impaired clearance of encapsulated organisms.\n\nApplication to the scenario: Both strains were cultured under identical optimal conditions, so differences in in vivo outcome are due to the presence or absence of the capsule, not growth defects. In healthy, immunocompetent hosts, the wild-type encapsulated strain retains antiphagocytic protection and will establish infection and cause disease. The mutant lacking the capsule will be efficiently opsonized by complement and antibodies and eliminated by phagocytic cells (e.g., alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, splenic macrophages), preventing disease.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Correct. Encapsulated wild-type causes disease; nonencapsulated mutant is rapidly cleared and avirulent.\n- B: Incorrect. While capsules can reduce desiccation, their principal role in S. pneumoniae virulence is antiphagocytic; the mutant would not be equally effective.\n- C: Incorrect. Loss of the capsule does not increase virulence via improved adhesion; instead, it removes antiphagocytic protection and reduces virulence.\n- D: Incorrect. Pneumolysin contributes to virulence, but S. pneumoniae does not rely solely on it; the capsule is critical for pathogenicity.\n- E: Incorrect. The capsule does not significantly block nutrient uptake in a way that reduces virulence of the encapsulated strain; rather, it enhances survival in the host.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2094298"}, {"introduction": "Moving from function to dynamics, we now investigate how the glycocalyx behaves in different bacterial lifestyles.

The stability of the glycocalyx is crucial for bacterial survival and pathogenesis. To quantify this, a pulse-chase experiment is performed.\n\nTwo identical cultures of *P. aeruginosa* are grown to a steady state, one as a planktonic suspension and the other as a biofilm on a solid surface.

After the pulse, the bacteria are thoroughly washed and transferred to a \"chase\" medium containing an excess of non-radioactive glucose. The moment the chase begins is defined as time $t=0$.\n\nThe amount of radioactivity incorporated into the cell-associated glycocalyx is measured at the beginning of the chase ($t=0$) and after a specific time interval. The data, measured in Counts Per Minute (CPM), a unit of radioactivity, are as follows:\n\nFor the planktonic culture:\n- Radioactivity at $t=0$: $C_{planktonic}(0) = 8.50 \\times 10^{5}$ CPM\n- Radioactivity at $t=4.00$ hours: $C_{planktonic}(4.00) = 2.10 \\times 10^{5}$ CPM\n\nFor the biofilm culture:\n- Radioactivity at $t=0$: $C_{biofilm}(0) = 9.20 \\times 10^{5}$ CPM\n- Radioactivity at $t=4.00$ hours: $C_{biofilm}(4.00) = 7.50 \\times 10^{5}$ CPM\n\nAssuming the shedding of the labeled glycocalyx material from the cell surface into the medium is a process that follows first-order kinetics, calculate the ratio of the shedding rate constant for the biofilm population to that of the planktonic population, $\\frac{k_{biofilm}}{k_{planktonic}}$.\n\nProvide your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "First-order shedding of labeled glycocalyx implies that the cell-associated radioactivity decays exponentially with time according to\n$$\nC(t) = C(0)\\,\\exp(-k\\,t),\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order shedding rate constant.

This capsule provides excellent protection against amoebic predators in its natural soil environment, but producing it is metabolically expensive.

The culture is then propagated in a predator-free, nutrient-rich chemostat for $g = 1000$ generations, which maintains a constant total population size. The metabolic burden of the capsule imposes a relative fitness cost of $s = 0.015$ on Cap+ cells compared to Cap- cells.
