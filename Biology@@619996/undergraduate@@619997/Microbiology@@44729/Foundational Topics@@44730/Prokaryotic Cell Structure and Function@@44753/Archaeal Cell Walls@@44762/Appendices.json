This first practice challenges you to leverage a key biochemical difference between the cell walls of Bacteria and Archaea to solve a practical identification problem. By considering the specific molecular structure of bacterial peptidoglycan versus archaeal pseudomurein, you can devise a method for selective cell lysis, a technique fundamental to microbial research [@problem_id:2053899].", "problem": "A researcher in a geomicrobiology lab has isolated two distinct prokaryotic organisms from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Both organisms appear as cocci under a microscope and initial staining suggests both possess a thick cell wall, analogous to a Gram-positive classification. The researcher knows from genetic sequencing that one culture is a bacterium and the other is an archaeon, but the labels have been mixed up.\n\nThe immediate goal is to perform a differential lysis to selectively harvest intracellular contents from the bacterial cells while leaving the archaeal cells intact. This will serve to correctly identify the cultures. Assuming one organism has a typical bacterial peptidoglycan wall and the other has a typical archaeal pseudomurein wall, which of the following single treatments would be most effective for this purpose?\n\nA. Incubation with lysozyme.\n\nB. Incubation with penicillin.\n\nC. Incubation with proteinase K.\n\nD. Incubation with lysostaphin.", "solution": "Goal: selectively lyse the bacterium (true peptidoglycan) while leaving the archaeon (pseudomurein) intact using a single treatment.\n\nFirst, identify structural and enzymatic specificities relevant to each option.\n1) Bacterial peptidoglycan is composed of repeating N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) units linked by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds, with peptide cross-links formed during cell wall synthesis by transpeptidases.\n2) Archaeal pseudomurein lacks NAM and instead contains N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid (NAT) linked to NAG by beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds, and its peptide cross-linking chemistry differs from that of bacteria. Consequently, several antibacterial enzymes and antibiotics targeting peptidoglycan are ineffective against pseudomurein.\n\nEvaluate each option mechanistically with respect to these features.\nA) Lysozyme specifically hydrolyzes the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond between NAM and NAG in bacterial peptidoglycan. Because archaeal pseudomurein uses NAT and beta-1,3 linkages, lysozyme does not recognize nor cleave it. Therefore, incubation with lysozyme will selectively lyse the bacterium while leaving the archaeon intact, achieving the desired differential lysis.\nB) Penicillin inhibits transpeptidase enzymes that form peptidoglycan cross-links during active cell wall synthesis. This is largely ineffective against archaea, which lack peptidoglycan and the target enzyme. Moreover, penicillin acts on growing cells and does not directly lyse already formed walls in a rapid, single-step treatment. It is less reliable for immediate selective lysis.\nC) Proteinase K is a broad-spectrum protease that degrades proteins nonspecifically. It does not specifically target bacterial peptidoglycan polysaccharide backbones and may damage proteins from both organisms without providing the desired selective lysis based on wall chemistry.\nD) Lysostaphin cleaves pentaglycine cross-bridges characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan. Its activity is highly specific and would not reliably lyse a generic bacterium unless it possesses the appropriate pentaglycine bridges. It also does not target archaeal pseudomurein. Given the unknown bacterial genus, this is not a broadly effective single treatment.\n\nConclusion: Only lysozyme exploits a universal chemical difference between bacterial peptidoglycan (beta-1,4 NAM-NAG) and archaeal pseudomurein (beta-1,3 NAT-NAG), yielding selective lysis of bacteria while sparing archaea.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2053899"}, {"introduction": "Many archaea, particularly those in extreme environments, lack peptidoglycan or pseudomurein altogether, instead relying on a crystalline protein shell called the S-layer as their cell wall. This exercise uses a hypothetical mutant to explore the S-layer's critical structural role. You will predict the consequences of its absence, thereby reinforcing your understanding of how a cell wall functions to protect against physical stresses like osmotic pressure [@problem_id:2053921].", "problem": "An archaeal species, *Methanopyrus kandleri*, is known to thrive in extreme environments and possesses a cell envelope consisting of a plasma membrane and an outermost Surface-layer (S-layer) composed of a crystalline lattice of proteins. It does not have a pseudomurein or peptidoglycan layer. A microbiologist generates a mutant strain of *M. kandleri* in which a genetic mutation completely prevents the synthesis of the proteins necessary for forming the S-layer. Both the wild-type (non-mutant) and the mutant strains are initially cultured in an isotonic medium that matches the cell's internal solute concentration.

The mutant lacks this S-layer and thus has only a plasma membrane.\n\nInitially, in an isotonic medium, the osmotic pressures inside and outside are equal, so there is no net water flux:\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\text{in}}=\\Pi_{\\text{out}}, \\quad \\Pi=i C R T.\n$$\nUpon transfer to a hypotonic medium, the external solute concentration decreases, so\n$$\nC_{\\text{out}}<C_{\\text{in}} \\implies \\Pi_{\\text{out}}<\\Pi_{\\text{in}},\n$$\nwhich drives water into the cell by osmosis. The influx of water increases internal hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure) until resisted by the cell envelope. In the wild type, the S-layer provides the necessary tensile strength to maintain cell shape and prevent rupture under increased turgor.\n\nIn the mutant, lacking the S-layer, the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand the elevated turgor pressure, leading to membrane overstretching, loss of defined shape, and osmotic lysis. Therefore, the most immediate and likely consequence for the mutant in hypotonic medium, relative to the wild type, is loss of shape and lysis.\n\nEliminations:\n- A is incorrect because plasmolysis occurs in hypertonic conditions (water exits the cell), not hypotonic.\n- B is not the immediate osmotic consequence; aggregation is not the primary effect of hypotonic shock.\n- D is incorrect; complete dormancy is not an immediate response to hypo-osmotic stress.\n- E is incorrect; removal of the S-layer does not accelerate division, and hypotonic stress is deleterious.\n\nThus, the correct choice is loss of shape and lysis due to inability to withstand internal turgor pressure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2053921"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of the S-layer's function, this final, more advanced practice delves into its biogenesis and absolute necessity for survival in extreme conditions. This scenario presents a specific genetic mutation affecting protein export and asks you to trace the resulting cascade of events from the molecular level to the organism's ultimate fate. This problem encourages a systems-level approach, connecting genetics, cell biology, and microbial ecology to understand how life endures at its limits [@problem_id:2053945].", "problem": "*Sulfolobus acidocaldarius* is a species of crenarchaea that thrives in terrestrial volcanic springs, characterized by high temperatures (around 80Â°C) and extreme acidity (pH 2-3). Its cell envelope is remarkably simple, consisting of a cytoplasmic membrane surrounded by a single, highly ordered, paracrystalline protein shell known as a Surface-layer (S-layer). This S-layer, composed of the protein SlaA, is the sole structural component of its cell wall, providing protection and maintaining cell shape. SlaA monomers are synthesized in the cytoplasm and directed to the general secretory (Sec) protein export pathway by a specific N-terminal signal peptide.\n\nImagine a strain of *Sulfolobus acidocaldarius* that acquires a mutation in the gene encoding SlaA. This mutation specifically alters the N-terminal signal peptide, rendering it completely unrecognizable by the Sec pathway's recognition components (like SecA and the SecYEG translocon). The rest of the SlaA protein sequence remains unchanged. The mutant cell continues to live in its native hot, acidic environment.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately and comprehensively describes the resulting cascade of events and the ultimate fate of this mutant cell?\n\nA. The cell will successfully export the SlaA monomers using the alternative Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, resulting in a slightly less organized but functional S-layer, allowing the cell to survive with reduced fitness.\n\nB. The un-exported SlaA monomers will accumulate in the cytoplasm, triggering a heat shock response and the overproduction of chaperone proteins. These chaperones will correctly fold the SlaA monomers, which then self-assemble into a stable, intracellular paracrystalline structure, leaving the cell surface exposed but viable.\n\nC. The SlaA monomers, failing to be exported, will accumulate in the cytoplasm. The absence of S-layer assembly on the exterior will leave the cytoplasmic membrane as the sole barrier against the environment. The cell will lose its defined shape and lyse due to the combined effects of thermal stress, extreme external pH, and mechanical fragility.\n\nD. The cell, detecting the failure to build its S-layer, will activate dormant genes for the synthesis of pseudomurein, constructing an alternative cell wall that allows it to survive in the extreme environment.\n\nE. The SlaA monomers will accumulate in the cytoplasm where they will be recognized as misfolded and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. The complete absence of SlaA will cause the cell to become osmotically sensitive and immediately lyse, as it can no longer counteract the turgor pressure from its cytoplasm.", "solution": "We identify the normal pathway and the effect of the mutation. In Sulfolobus, the S-layer protein SlaA is synthesized in the cytoplasm and directed to the Sec-dependent export pathway by its N-terminal signal peptide. Core principle: Sec-mediated export requires an appropriate N-terminal signal peptide for recognition and translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane; if the signal peptide is not recognized, the protein remains in the cytoplasm and is not exported.\n\nGiven mutation: The N-terminal signal peptide is altered so it is completely unrecognizable by Sec recognition components. Therefore, SlaA is not exported and accumulates in the cytoplasm.\n\nWe eliminate alternative export and compensatory possibilities. The Tat pathway requires a specific twin-arginine motif in the signal peptide and typically transports fully folded, often cofactor-containing proteins. A Sec-type S-layer substrate lacking a Tat-type signal peptide will not be rerouted to Tat. Thus, statement A is incorrect: there is no general fallback from Sec to Tat for a protein whose signal peptide is incompatible with Tat, and SlaA is not known to use Tat.\n\nWe assess intracellular fate of unexported SlaA. Accumulation of export-incompetent proteins can induce stress responses (e.g., chaperone upregulation), but proper folding in the cytosol does not solve the topological problem: SlaA must be outside the membrane to assemble the S-layer. Self-assembly of a paracrystalline lattice inside the cytosol would not replace the external protective layer and would likely be deleterious. Therefore, statement B is not viable as a survival strategy.\n\nWe evaluate the structural and environmental consequences of lacking the S-layer. In Sulfolobus, the S-layer is the sole cell wall component and provides mechanical support, shape, and protection in hot, highly acidic environments. Without SlaA export, no S-layer forms on the exterior. The cytoplasmic membrane, even though composed of archaeal tetraether lipids that are thermally and acid-stable, lacks rigid structural reinforcement. Under high temperature, extreme external acidity, and mechanical stress, such cells lose their defined shape and become fragile, leading to lysis. This cascade matches statement C: cytosolic accumulation of SlaA, failure of S-layer assembly, membrane left as the only barrier, loss of shape, and lysis under environmental stress.\n\nWe exclude proposed genetic compensation. Sulfolobus does not possess dormant pseudomurein biosynthesis genes; pseudomurein is characteristic of some methanogenic archaea, not crenarchaea like Sulfolobus. Thus, statement D is incorrect.\n\nWe assess proteolysis and timing of lysis. Archaea do have proteasomes and cytosolic quality control, so some mislocalized SlaA may be degraded. However, recognition as misfolded is not guaranteed solely by export failure, and âimmediateâ osmotic lysis as stated in E is overstated and mechanistically incomplete. The primary lethal mechanism in this context is the lack of the S-layerâs structural protection in an extreme environment, with resultant mechanical fragility and envelope failure; while osmotic sensitivity may increase, the comprehensive description in C better captures the combined thermal, acidic, and mechanical stresses and the loss of defined shape that precede lysis. Therefore, E is less accurate and less comprehensive than C.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate and comprehensive description is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2053945"}]}
