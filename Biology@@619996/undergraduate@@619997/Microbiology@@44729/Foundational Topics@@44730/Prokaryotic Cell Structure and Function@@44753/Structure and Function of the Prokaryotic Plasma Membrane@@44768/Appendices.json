This fluidity is crucial for many cellular processes, but how can we quantify it? This exercise [@problem_id:2094561] introduces you to a powerful biophysical technique, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), and challenges you to apply a physical model of diffusion to predict how a large membrane protein moves in comparison to a small lipid molecule. By working through this calculation, you will gain a more concrete understanding of just how \"fluid\" the membrane truly is.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the fluidity of the plasma membrane in a spherical bacterium. The study utilizes a technique called Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). In this method, specific molecules in the membrane are first tagged with a fluorescent marker. A small, circular region of the cell surface is then exposed to a high-intensity laser beam, which irreversibly bleaches the fluorescent markers in that spot. The rate at which fluorescence returns to the bleached spot, due to the lateral movement of unbleached molecules from surrounding areas, is monitored.\n\nThe lateral diffusion coefficient, $D$, of the fluorescently tagged molecules can be determined from the characteristic half-recovery time, $\\tau$ (the time it takes for the fluorescence intensity in the center of the spot to reach half of its final recovery value), and the radius of the bleached spot, $w$. The relationship is given by the approximation:\n$$D = \\frac{w^2}{4 \\tau}$$\nFurthermore, for particles moving within the two-dimensional plane of the membrane, a simplified physical model relates the diffusion coefficient $D$ to the particle's effective hydrodynamic radius, $a$. This model states that the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to this radius:\n$$D = \\frac{C}{a}$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that depends on the properties of the membrane (like viscosity) and the temperature, but not on the particle itself.\n\nThe microbiologist performs two experiments on the bacterium using a laser that creates a bleached spot of radius $w = 0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n1.  In the first experiment, a fluorescent lipid analog with an effective hydrodynamic radius of $a_L = 0.50$ nm is used. The measured half-recovery time is $\\tau_L = 0.50$ s.\n2.  In the second experiment, a specific integral membrane protein is tagged. This protein and its associated complex have a combined effective hydrodynamic radius of $a_P = 5.0$ nm.\n\nAssuming the constant $C$ is the same in both experiments, calculate the expected half-recovery time, $\\tau_P$, for the integral membrane protein. Express your final answer in seconds, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We use two relationships:\n\n1) The FRAP approximation for a circular bleached spot of radius $w$ gives the diffusion coefficient $D$ in terms of the half-recovery time $\\tau$:\n$$\nD=\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\tau}.\n$$\n\n2) The two-dimensional hydrodynamic model relates $D$ to the effective hydrodynamic radius $a$ via\n$$\nD=\\frac{C}{a},\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant independent of the particle.\n\nFor the lipid (subscript $L$), both relations must hold:\n$$\nD_{L}=\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\tau_{L}}=\\frac{C}{a_{L}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C=D_{L}a_{L}=\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\tau_{L}}\\,a_{L}.\n$$\n\nFor the protein (subscript $P$), using the same constant $C$:\n$$\nD_{P}=\\frac{C}{a_{P}}=\\frac{1}{a_{P}}\\left(\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\tau_{L}}\\,a_{L}\\right)=\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\tau_{L}}\\frac{a_{L}}{a_{P}}.\n$$\nApplying the FRAP relation for the protein gives\n$$\n\\tau_{P}=\\frac{w^{2}}{4D_{P}}=\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\left(\\frac{w^{2}}{4\\tau_{L}}\\frac{a_{L}}{a_{P}}\\right)}=\\tau_{L}\\frac{a_{P}}{a_{L}}.\n$$\n\nThus the half-recovery time scales linearly with the hydrodynamic radius.

One of the most critical functions is transport—acting as selective gatekeepers that control what enters and leaves the cell. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2094538] presents a classic scenario in microbial genetics, asking you to predict the fate of an *E. coli* cell that is missing a single, crucial transport protein. It's a powerful illustration of the principle that access to a nutrient is just as important as the ability to metabolize it.", "problem": "An experimental strain of *Escherichia coli* is engineered with a frameshift mutation in its *lacY* gene. This mutation results in the production of a truncated, non-functional protein. For context, the *lac* operon in *E. coli* contains a set of genes essential for lactose metabolism: *lacZ*, which encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase that hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose; and *lacY*, which encodes the lactose permease protein, a symporter embedded in the plasma membrane responsible for transporting lactose into the cell. All other genes and regulatory elements in this engineered strain, including the *lacZ* gene, are fully functional.\n\nThis mutant strain is inoculated into a minimal liquid medium where the sole source of carbon and energy provided is lactose. A control culture of wild-type *E. coli* is grown under identical conditions. Based on your understanding of bacterial metabolism and membrane transport, predict the most likely outcome for the mutant strain.\n\nA. The mutant will grow at a rate comparable to the wild-type strain because its *lacZ* gene is functional, allowing it to produce the necessary enzyme to break down lactose.\n\nB. The mutant will fail to grow because lactose cannot be efficiently transported into the cell, rendering the intracellular β-galactosidase enzyme useless due to lack of substrate.\n\nC. The mutant will grow, but at a significantly slower rate than the wild-type strain, because a small amount of lactose will be able to passively diffuse across the plasma membrane.\n\nD. The mutant will quickly die and lyse as the high external concentration of lactose will create an extreme osmotic pressure difference that the cell cannot withstand.", "solution": "1) State the biological roles required for lactose utilization. In the lac operon, lacY encodes lactose permease, a proton symporter that imports extracellular lactose across the cytoplasmic membrane using the proton motive force, and lacZ encodes β-galactosidase, a cytosolic enzyme that hydrolyzes intracellular lactose to glucose and galactose. Therefore, successful growth on lactose as the sole carbon and energy source requires: (i) transport of lactose into the cytosol by LacY and (ii) intracellular catabolism of lactose by LacZ.\n\n2) Identify the effect of the mutation. A frameshift in lacY producing a truncated, non-functional protein eliminates lactose permease activity. Hence, active transport of lactose across the inner membrane is abolished.\n\n3) Evaluate alternative routes of lactose entry. Lactose is a hydrophilic disaccharide and does not appreciably cross the lipid bilayer by simple diffusion. In Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, general porins in the outer membrane may permit diffusion through the outer membrane, but the cytoplasmic (inner) membrane remains the major permeability barrier. Without LacY or an alternative specific transporter (which is not present for lactose in E. coli), cytosolic entry is negligible. Thus, intracellular lactose remains insufficient to support metabolism.\n\n4) Consequence for metabolism and growth. Although lacZ is intact and can produce β-galactosidase, the enzyme acts only on intracellular substrate. With lactose not entering the cytosol at physiologically meaningful rates, β-galactosidase has no accessible substrate, so lactose cannot be catabolized to yield energy or carbon skeletons. Therefore, in a minimal medium where lactose is the sole carbon and energy source, the mutant cannot sustain growth.\n\n5) Exclude alternative outcomes. \n- Comparable growth to wild type is impossible without lactose uptake (reject A).\n- Significantly slower growth due to passive diffusion is not supported because passive permeation of lactose across the inner membrane is effectively negligible and cannot support measurable growth (reject C).\n- Rapid death and lysis from osmotic shock due to external lactose is unlikely under standard minimal media conditions; E. coli maintains osmotic balance and the presence of external lactose does not inherently create lethal osmotic stress (reject D).\n\n6) Conclusion. The mutant will fail to grow because lactose cannot be efficiently transported into the cell, rendering intracellular β-galactosidase functionally irrelevant due to lack of substrate.

The bacterium is cultured in a liquid medium under aerobic conditions with a constant supply of oxygen, glucose, and lactose.

The ability to concentrate lactose depends on the PMF providing free energy to drive lactose accumulation against its gradient. With no PMF, the symporter cannot perform active uptake and transport collapses (it may equilibrate or even mediate net efflux depending on gradients).\n\nA protonophore inserts into the membrane and allows protons to diffuse freely down their electrochemical gradient.
