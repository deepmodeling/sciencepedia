This first exercise zooms in on the core of translation—the elongation cycle—to calculate the baseline energy currency, in the form of GTP, required to add a single amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain. By breaking down the cycle into its key GTP-dependent steps, you will quantify the fundamental 'price' of protein synthesis [@problem_id:2089883].", "problem": "In prokaryotic cells, the synthesis of a polypeptide chain on a 70S ribosome is an energy-intensive process critical for life. During the elongation phase of translation, which follows initiation and precedes termination, the ribosome moves along an mRNA template, sequentially adding amino acids to the growing polypeptide. This cycle involves three key events for each amino acid incorporated:\n\n1.  The delivery of a charged aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, a process facilitated by an elongation factor that is a GTPase.\n2.  The formation of a peptide bond, catalyzed by the peptidyl transferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit.\n3.  The translocation of the ribosome one codon downstream along the mRNA, a movement driven by a second, distinct GTPase elongation factor.\n\nAssume that the correct aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered and incorporated without any proofreading-related rejection events. Based on this standard model of the elongation cycle, determine the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds from Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) that are hydrolyzed for each single amino acid correctly added to the growing polypeptide chain.", "solution": "The elongation cycle in prokaryotic translation consists of three key events per amino acid added, and we count only high-energy phosphate bond hydrolyses from GTP as specified.\n\nFirst, delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site is mediated by EF-Tu, a GTPase. Correct codon-anticodon recognition triggers EF-Tu to hydrolyze one GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate, thereby consuming one high-energy phosphate bond. Thus this step contributes $1$ GTP hydrolysis.\n\nSecond, peptide bond formation is catalyzed by the peptidyl transferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit. This step does not consume GTP; the energy is derived from the high-energy ester bond of the aminoacyl-tRNA. Thus this step contributes $0$ GTP hydrolyses.\n\nThird, translocation of the ribosome by one codon is driven by EF-G, a distinct GTPase, which hydrolyzes one GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate. Thus this step contributes $1$ GTP hydrolysis.\n\nAssuming no proofreading-related rejections, the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds from GTP hydrolyzed per amino acid added is\n$$\nN_{\\text{GTP}}=1+0+1=2.\n$$\n\nThis count explicitly excludes ATP usage by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and any additional GTP costs during initiation or termination, as the question restricts to elongation and correct incorporations only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2089883"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of the basic elongation cost, this practice introduces a layer of biological reality: the need for accuracy. Cells invest additional energy in 'proofreading' to ensure the correct amino acids are incorporated, a process vital for producing functional proteins. This problem challenges you to calculate the total average energetic cost of synthesizing an entire polypeptide, incorporating the costs of initiation, termination, and this crucial kinetic proofreading mechanism [@problem_id:2089937].", "problem": "A microbiologist is modeling the energetic requirements for protein synthesis in a prokaryotic system. The synthesis of a polypeptide chain involves several stages, each with an associated cost in terms of GTP hydrolysis. The process is defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The assembly of the ribosomal subunits on the mRNA transcript, along with the initiator tRNA, requires the hydrolysis of one molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n2.  **Elongation Cycle (for each subsequent amino acid):**\n    a.  **Aminoacyl-tRNA Delivery:** An elongation factor delivers the correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site. This step is powered by the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n    b.  **Translocation:** The ribosome advances one codon along the mRNA, a process that requires the hydrolysis of another GTP molecule.\n3.  **Termination:** The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of one final GTP molecule.\n4.  **Kinetic Proofreading:** To ensure high fidelity, the ribosome possesses a proofreading mechanism. For the specific polypeptide being modeled, it is observed that for every 50 correct aminoacyl-tRNAs that are successfully incorporated into the growing chain, one incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the A-site and subsequently rejected. This rejection process still consumes the energy from the delivery step, meaning one molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed for each rejected aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the total average number of GTP molecules that are hydrolyzed to synthesize a single polypeptide that is exactly 100 amino acids long. Note that the energy required to charge tRNA molecules with their respective amino acids (which involves ATP hydrolysis) should not be included in your calculation.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of GTP molecules hydrolyzed to synthesize a polypeptide of 100 amino acids. We must break down the process into its constituent parts and sum the GTP costs for each. The length of the polypeptide is $N = 100$ amino acids.\n\n**Step 1: GTP cost of Initiation**\nThe problem states that initiation requires the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n$GTP_{\\text{initiation}} = 1$\n\n**Step 2: GTP cost of Elongation**\nA polypeptide of $N=100$ amino acids consists of one initial amino acid brought in during initiation and $N-1 = 99$ amino acids added during the elongation phase. This means there are 99 elongation cycles.\n\nEach elongation cycle has two steps that consume GTP:\n1.  **Aminoacyl-tRNA Delivery:** 1 GTP per cycle.\n2.  **Translocation:** 1 GTP per cycle.\n\nSo, the standard cost for each elongation cycle is 2 GTP.\nFor 99 cycles, the standard elongation cost is:\n$GTP_{\\text{elongation\\_std}} = (N-1) \\times (1_{\\text{delivery}} + 1_{\\text{translocation}}) = 99 \\times 2 = 198$\n\n**Step 3: GTP cost of Termination**\nThe problem specifies that termination requires the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n$GTP_{\\text{termination}} = 1$\n\n**Step 4: GTP cost of Kinetic Proofreading**\nThe proofreading mechanism introduces an additional cost. An incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA is rejected for every 50 correct ones incorporated. The number of amino acids incorporated during elongation is $N-1 = 99$.\n\nThe rate of rejection is 1 rejection per 50 correct incorporations.
