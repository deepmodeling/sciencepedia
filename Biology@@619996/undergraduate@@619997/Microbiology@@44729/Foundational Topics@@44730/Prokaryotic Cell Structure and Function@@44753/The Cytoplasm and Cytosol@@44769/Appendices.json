This fundamental separation makes understanding osmosis critical for appreciating how bacteria survive fluctuating environmental conditions. This first practice explores the direct physical consequence of osmotic stress by challenging you to predict what happens when a bacterium is moved into a high-salt, or hypertonic, environment, a classic phenomenon known as plasmolysis [@problem_id:2097252].", "problem": "A culture of a typical walled bacterium, such as *Escherichia coli*, is initially thriving in a laboratory medium that is isotonic with its cytoplasm, containing 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl). An experiment is conducted where a sample of these bacteria is rapidly centrifuged and then immediately resuspended in a new sterile solution containing 10% NaCl. Assume the cell wall is rigid and fully permeable to water and ions, while the plasma membrane is selectively permeable, allowing water to pass freely but blocking the passage of Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ ions.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and primary consequence for the bacterial cell's plasma membrane and the cytoplasm it encloses?\n\nA. The cell will rapidly take in water, causing it to swell and ultimately undergo lysis, bursting the cell wall.\n\nB. The plasma membrane will shrink and pull away from the interior of the cell wall as water exits the cytoplasm.\n\nC. No significant change will occur to the cytoplasm or plasma membrane, as the rigid cell wall protects the cell from osmotic stress.\n\nD. The cell wall will collapse inward under the external pressure, crushing the plasma membrane and cytoplasm.\n\nE. The cell will actively pump Na$^{+}$ ions into the cytoplasm to equalize the concentration gradient, causing the cytoplasm to expand against the cell wall.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of moving a walled bacterium from an isotonic solution to a hypertonic solution. The key principle governing this process is osmosis.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial state.**\nThe bacterium is initially in an isotonic solution (0.85% NaCl). This means the concentration of solutes inside the bacterium's cytoplasm is equal to the concentration of solutes in the external medium. Consequently, the water potential inside the cell is equal to the water potential outside the cell. There is no net movement of water across the plasma membrane, and the cell is in a state of equilibrium.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the new environment.**\nThe bacterium is transferred to a 10% NaCl solution. This solution has a much higher solute concentration than the bacterium's cytoplasm (which was isotonic with 0.85% NaCl). A solution with a higher solute concentration is defined as hypertonic relative to the cell. A higher solute concentration corresponds to a lower water potential. Therefore, the external environment now has a significantly lower water potential than the cytoplasm.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the principle of osmosis.**\nOsmosis is the net movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher water potential (lower solute concentration) to an area of lower water potential (higher solute concentration). In this scenario, the plasma membrane is the selectively permeable barrier. Since the water potential is higher inside the cell than outside, water will move out of the cytoplasm and into the external 10% NaCl solution.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the cellular consequence of water loss.**\nThe net efflux of water from the cytoplasm will cause the cytoplasm to lose volume and shrink. The plasma membrane, which is flexible, encloses the cytoplasm. As the cytoplasm shrinks, the plasma membrane will pull away from the rigid cell wall that surrounds it. This process is called **plasmolysis**. The cell wall itself is a rigid structure and does not collapse or shrink; it maintains the overall shape of the bacterium.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A. The cell will ... undergo lysis.** Lysis (bursting) occurs when a cell takes in too much water. This happens in a *hypotonic* environment (lower external solute concentration), not a hypertonic one. This option is incorrect.\n- **B. The plasma membrane will shrink and pull away from the interior of the cell wall...** This accurately describes plasmolysis, the direct result of water loss from the cytoplasm in a hypertonic environment. This option is correct.\n- **C. No significant change will occur... as the rigid cell wall protects the cell.** The cell wall provides structural support but is permeable to water. It cannot prevent the osmotic movement of water across the plasma membrane. This option is incorrect.\n- **D. The cell wall will collapse inward...** The bacterial cell wall is designed to be rigid to resist internal turgor pressure; it does not collapse under external osmotic pressure. The volume change occurs within the plasma membrane. This option is incorrect.\n- **E. The cell will actively pump Na$^{+}$ ions into the cytoplasm...** Actively pumping ions *into* the cell would further lower the internal water potential, exacerbating water loss. To counteract the hypertonic environment, a cell would need to pump solutes *out*, but this process is neither immediate nor powerful enough to counteract such a drastic change from 0.85% to 10% NaCl and prevent water loss. This option describes the opposite of a compensatory response and is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the immediate and primary consequence is plasmolysis, where the plasma membrane and cytoplasm shrink away from the cell wall.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2097252"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its physical properties, the cytosol is the primary stage for cellular metabolism, powered by the energy currency of ATP.

The proper folding and activity of this antibody fragment depend on the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. However, the bacterial cytoplasm is a strongly reducing environment, which prevents disulfide bond formation. This reducing state is primarily maintained by the glutathione system. In this system, reduced glutathione (GSH) is the abundant form, while the oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), is kept at very low levels.\n\nThe cytoplasmic ratio of GSH to GSSG is determined by a dynamic steady state. GSSG is constantly being produced from GSH by various cellular oxidative processes at a constant rate, $R_{ox}$. In parallel, GSSG is enzymatically reduced back to GSH by the NADPH-dependent enzyme glutathione reductase (Gor). The rate of this reduction, $V_{red}$, can be modeled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to GSSG, assuming NADPH is saturating:\n$$V_{red} = \\frac{V_{max} [\\text{GSSG}]}{K_m + [\\text{GSSG}]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum enzyme velocity and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant for GSSG.\n\nIn the wild-type *E. coli* strain, the system is in a steady state where the rate of GSSG production equals its rate of reduction.

In this mutant, the expression of the *gor* gene is partially silenced, resulting in a reduction of the maximum velocity of glutathione reductase, $V_{max}$, by 80% compared to the wild-type.
