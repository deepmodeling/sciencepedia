The second species is a rod-shaped bacterium (a bacillus) with a uniform length of $l_b = 4.5 \\ \\mu m$. The microbiologist observes that under specific conditions, the bacteria form a single, straight, filamentous chain that stretches exactly across the full diameter of the microscope's field of view. The width of this field of view is $W = 210 \\ \\mu m$. The chain consists of a perfectly repeating pattern of one bacillus followed by two cocci, arranged end-to-end.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:2068705] explores the crucial role of the cell wall in maintaining prokaryotic morphology against the cell's internal turgor pressure. By predicting the effect of penicillin, a well-known inhibitor of cell wall synthesis, you will connect a molecular mechanism of antibiotic action to a dramatic and observable change in cell shape.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying a culture of a bacterium characterized by its bacillus (rod-like) morphology. The structural integrity and defined shape of this bacterium are maintained by its cell wall, which is primarily composed of a polymer called peptidoglycan. This rigid layer counteracts the cell's high internal osmotic pressure. The culture is actively growing in an osmotically supportive, isotonic medium.\n\nTo investigate the function of the cell wall, the researcher introduces a sublethal concentration of penicillin to the medium. Penicillin is an antibiotic known to specifically inhibit the enzymes that catalyze the final cross-linking step in peptidoglycan synthesis, thereby preventing the formation of new, functional cell wall material.\n\nAssuming the cells continue their metabolic activity and attempt to grow, what is the most likely and immediate morphological change that would be observed in the population of these bacteria?\n\nA. The cells will become spherical.\n\nB. The cells will adopt a curved or spiral shape.\n\nC. The cells will shrink in size but retain their rod shape.\n\nD. The cells will form long, undivided filaments.\n\nE. The cells will be entirely unaffected due to the isotonic medium.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the morphological change in a rod-shaped bacterium when its cell wall synthesis is inhibited by penicillin in an isotonic medium.\n\n1.  **Initial State and Function of the Cell Wall:** The bacterium is a bacillus, meaning it has a rod shape. This shape is not the default state of a membrane-bound sac but is actively maintained by a rigid external structure, the peptidoglycan cell wall. The cell wall's primary role is to provide mechanical strength to resist the high turgor pressure exerted by the cytoplasm, which has a higher solute concentration than the environment. This resistance prevents the cell from swelling and bursting (osmotic lysis) and dictates its specific shape.\n\n2.  **Action of Penicillin:** Penicillin inhibits the transpeptidase enzymes that create cross-links between peptidoglycan chains. This action is most effective on actively growing and dividing cells, as they are continuously synthesizing and remodeling their cell walls. By blocking the formation of these cross-links, penicillin compromises the integrity of the newly synthesized portions of the cell wall, creating weak spots.\n\n3.  **Effect of a Weakened Cell Wall:** In the absence of a fully rigid and restraining cell wall, the internal turgor pressure will act on the flexible plasma membrane underneath. Even in an isotonic medium, the internal solute concentration of a healthy bacterium is high, generating significant outward pressure. This pressure will cause the cell to swell at the weak points in its peptidoglycan-sacculus.\n\n4.  **Resulting Morphology:** A membrane-bound vesicle under uniform internal pressure, without external constraints, will naturally assume the shape that minimizes surface area for a given volume, which is a sphere. Therefore, as the rod-shaped structure of the cell wall fails, the bacterium will lose its elongated shape and swell into a spherical form. These resulting wall-deficient spherical cells are known as spheroplasts.\n\n5.  **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A. The cells will become spherical.** This is the correct outcome. The loss of the shape-defining cell wall allows the internal turgor pressure to force the cell into a spherical geometry.\n    *   **B. The cells will adopt a curved or spiral shape.** This is incorrect. Like a rod, a spiral shape is a complex morphology that requires a specific, intact cell wall biosynthetic machinery, which is precisely what penicillin is disrupting.\n    *   **C. The cells will shrink in size but retain their rod shape.** This is incorrect. The inhibition of the cell wall would lead to swelling due to internal pressure, not shrinking.\n    *   **D. The cells will form long, undivided filaments.** Filamentation occurs when cell division (septation) is blocked, but cell elongation continues. While some antibiotics can cause this, the primary and most direct effect of weakening the entire cell wall's structural integrity is a loss of the basic rod shape itself, leading to sphere formation.\n    *   **E. The cells will be entirely unaffected due to the isotonic medium.** This is incorrect. The isotonic medium prevents immediate osmotic lysis (bursting), which would occur in a hypotonic medium (like water). However, it does not negate the internal turgor pressure or the structural failure of the cell wall. The presence of penicillin will still cause a morphological change, which is observable precisely because the medium is osmotically supportive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2068705"}, {"introduction": "The morphology of a bacterial population is not static; it is the result of dynamic processes of growth and division. This final exercise [@problem_id:2068659] delves into the intricate molecular machinery that controls cell division. By considering a scenario where a key regulatory protein, MinC, is overexpressed, you will explore how disrupting the precise control of cytokinesis can lead to profound changes in cellular morphology, linking the genetics of the cell to its physical appearance.", "problem": "In a microbiology research project, a strain of the rod-shaped bacterium *Escherichia coli* is being studied to understand the mechanisms of cell division. The division process in this bacterium is critically dependent on the formation of a contractile ring, known as the Z-ring, at the cell's midpoint. This ring is composed of polymerized FtsZ protein. The spatial regulation of Z-ring formation is managed by the Min protein system. A key component of this system is the MinC protein, which acts as a direct inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization, preventing the Z-ring from forming at the cell poles.\n\nA genetic engineering experiment is performed on this bacterium. A plasmid containing the gene for MinC (*minC*) is introduced, placing the gene under the control of a very strong, constitutive promoter. This modification leads to significant and continuous overexpression of the MinC protein, resulting in a cellular concentration of MinC far exceeding normal physiological levels. The engineered cells are then grown in a nutrient-rich liquid medium that supports normal cellular growth and elongation.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the predominant cellular morphology that would be observed in a sample from the liquid culture after several generations of growth?\n\nA. The cells will become long, non-septated filaments.\n\nB. The cells will form large, amorphous aggregates, but individual cells within the aggregates will maintain their normal rod shape and size.\n\nC. The cells will divide asymmetrically at the cell poles, producing a high frequency of small, anucleate \"minicells\".\n\nD. The cells will lose their rod shape and become spherical (coccoid).\n\nE. The cells will be unable to replicate their DNA and will cease to grow.", "solution": "1. State the essential biological mechanism: In rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, cytokinesis requires polymerization of the tubulin homolog FtsZ into a contractile Z-ring at midcell. Septation depends on successful Z-ring formation and subsequent recruitment of divisome components. The Min system (MinC, MinD, MinE) spatially regulates Z-ring placement by creating a time-averaged gradient of the FtsZ inhibitor MinC that is highest at the poles and lowest at midcell, thereby allowing FtsZ polymerization only at midcell while preventing polar Z-rings.\n2. Identify the specific molecular function of the perturbed factor: MinC directly inhibits FtsZ polymerization. Its inhibitory effect is concentration-dependent; higher MinC concentrations reduce the probability that FtsZ will nucleate and stabilize protofilaments necessary for Z-ring assembly.\n3. Apply the engineered perturbation: Placing minC under a very strong constitutive promoter causes high, persistent overexpression of MinC, yielding a cellular MinC concentration that far exceeds normal physiological levels. This abolishes the normal MinC spatial gradient’s permissive low at midcell, because the absolute concentration is elevated throughout the cytoplasm.\n4. Deduce the consequence for Z-ring formation: With uniformly high MinC, the inhibitory concentration threshold that prevents FtsZ polymerization is exceeded at all positions along the cell. Therefore, FtsZ fails to polymerize into a Z-ring anywhere, including at midcell. Without a Z-ring, the divisome cannot assemble, and septation is blocked.\n5. State the consequence for cell growth and morphology under the given growth conditions: The problem specifies growth in nutrient-rich medium that supports normal cellular growth and elongation. Cell wall elongation machinery and DNA replication are not directly dependent on Z-ring formation; thus, cells continue to grow and elongate and can replicate DNA, but cannot constrict or divide. The morphological outcome is filamentation: cells become long, non-septated filaments due to continued elongation without division.\n6. Exclude alternative options by mechanism:\n- Option B (aggregates with normal rods) is not expected from MinC overexpression; MinC affects division, not adhesiveness or aggregation per se.\n- Option C (polar divisions yielding minicells) is characteristic of loss-of-function of the Min system (e.g., minCDE mutants) that permits polar Z-rings. Overexpression of MinC produces the opposite effect: global inhibition of Z-ring formation, not mislocalized polar rings.\n- Option D (loss of rod shape to coccoid) is associated with defects in the Rod complex (e.g., MreB) or peptidoglycan synthesis, not MinC levels.\n- Option E (inability to replicate DNA and growth arrest) does not follow from MinC overexpression; DNA replication and elongation proceed in the absence of septation.\n7. Therefore, the predominant cellular morphology after several generations is long, non-septated filaments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2068659"}]}
