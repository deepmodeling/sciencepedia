{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The beautiful and diverse arrangements of prokaryotic cells are not accidental; they are a direct consequence of the planes in which cells divide and whether they remain attached post-division. This first practice explores one of the most classic examples of this principle. By considering a spherical bacterium (coccus) that divides along multiple, random axes, you will deduce the formation of the characteristic grape-like clusters, a key feature used in microbial identification.", "problem": "A microbiologist is characterizing a novel bacterial species isolated from a geothermal vent. Through light microscopy, the individual cells are observed to be spherical in shape (cocci). The researcher then uses time-lapse microscopy to observe the process of binary fission and subsequent colony formation. It is noted that after each cell division, the daughter cells tend to remain attached to one another. Critically, the plane of cell division for successive generations appears to be irregular and occurs along multiple, random axes.\n\nBased on this observed pattern of cell division, which of the following cellular arrangements is this bacterial species most likely to form?\n\nA. Streptococci\n\nB. Diplococci\n\nC. Tetrads\n\nD. Staphylococci\n\nE. Sarcinae", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the cellular arrangement of a spherical bacterium (coccus) based on its pattern of cell division. The key information provided is that the division occurs in multiple, random planes, and the daughter cells remain attached. We must evaluate the given options to determine which arrangement corresponds to this specific division pattern.\n\nFirst, let's define the cellular arrangements listed as options, which are characteristic of cocci:\n\n- **Diplococci:** This arrangement consists of pairs of cocci. It is formed when a coccus divides along a single plane and the two daughter cells remain attached.\n\n- **Streptococci:** This arrangement consists of chains of cocci, resembling a string of beads. It is formed when cocci repeatedly divide along a single, parallel plane and all daughter cells remain attached in a line.\n\n- **Tetrads:** This arrangement consists of flat, square groups of four cocci. It is formed when a coccus undergoes two successive divisions in two planes that are perpendicular to each other, and all four cells remain attached.\n\n- **Sarcinae:** This arrangement consists of cubical packets of eight, sixteen, or more cells. It is formed when a coccus undergoes successive divisions in three planes that are perpendicular to each other, forming a cube-like structure.\n\n- **Staphylococci:** This arrangement consists of irregular, grape-like clusters of cocci. It is formed when cocci divide in multiple, random planes, leading to an unorganized cluster of cells.\n\nThe problem states that the newly discovered coccus divides along \"multiple, random axes.\" This pattern of division directly matches the description for the formation of a staphylococci arrangement. The divisions are not restricted to a single plane (ruling out Streptococci and Diplococci) nor are they ordered in two or three perpendicular planes (ruling out Tetrads and Sarcinae). The randomness of the division planes naturally leads to the formation of irregular, three-dimensional clusters, which are characteristic of the staphylococci arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cellular arrangement to be formed is staphylococci.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2089086"}, {"introduction": "While cocci can form varied arrangements based on their division planes, a cell's fundamental shape imposes critical constraints. This exercise moves from spherical cells to rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli) to explore this limitation. You are presented with a hypothetical scenario involving a genetic mutation in *Bacillus subtilis* that prevents daughter cells from separating, challenging you to predict the resulting morphology and explain why certain arrangements, possible for cocci, are physically impossible for bacilli.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying cell division in *Bacillus subtilis*, a rod-shaped bacterium. The wild-type strain normally exists as single cells or occasional short chains. The researcher creates a mutant strain by knocking out a gene, designated *sepX*, which is essential for the final step of cleaving the septum that separates daughter cells after binary fission. As a result, in the mutant strain, cells remain attached to each other after division.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the resulting cellular arrangement in the *sepX* mutant and provides the correct underlying reason why this bacterium cannot form a sarcina-like packet?\n\nA. Staphylococcus, because division planes are random, leading to a grape-like cluster.\n\nB. Sarcina, because the blockage of separation forces the cells to stack into a cubical packet.\n\nC. Streptobacillus, because cell division is restricted to a single plane.\n\nD. Palisades, because the cells snap apart and then lie side-by-side due to post-fission motility.\n\nE. Tetrad, because division occurs in two perpendicular planes, but the mutation prevents formation of a larger packet.", "solution": "Bacillus subtilis is a rod-shaped bacterium (a bacillus). In bacilli, the cytokinetic ring and septum form in a single plane perpendicular to the long axis, so binary fission proceeds in one consistent plane. If the septal cleavage step is disabled (as in the sepX knockout), daughter cells do not separate after division. When division continues in the same single plane and cells remain attached, the result is a chain of rods aligned end-to-end, i.e., a streptobacillus arrangement.\n\nA sarcina-like packet requires divisions in three mutually perpendicular planes, which is a characteristic of certain cocci. Simply preventing separation does not change the intrinsic control of division planes. Because B. subtilis divides in only one plane and is rod-shaped, it cannot generate the cubical packets of sarcina; instead, it forms chains. Therefore, the correct identification is streptobacillus due to single-plane division, which also explains why a sarcina-like packet cannot form.\n\nOptions A, B, D, and E are inconsistent: A and B assume random or multi-plane divisions typical of cocci; D presupposes snapping separation (contradicted by the mutation preventing separation); E assumes two perpendicular planes (tetrads) found in some cocci, not in bacilli.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2089088"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond descriptive biology, this final challenge delves into the predictive power of synthetic biology and mathematical modeling. The principles governing cell division can be abstracted into quantitative models, allowing us to not only understand but also engineer cellular behavior. In this advanced problem, you will work with a model of competing protein systems that regulate division plane placement, calculating the precise conditions needed to force a colony to grow into a predetermined spiral pattern, a task that beautifully merges microbiology with physics and engineering principles.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a circuit to control the morphology of a colony of genetically engineered coccoid bacteria. These bacteria are modified to first elongate into a short rod before dividing precisely at their midpoint. The daughter cells remain attached, and their growth is constrained to a two-dimensional plane. The orientation of the new division plane relative to the previous one determines the colony's macroscopic shape.\n\nThe orientation is determined by the competition between two engineered FtsZ-ring positioning systems. The FtsZ ring, which determines the division plane, forms at the circumferential position $\\phi$ that maximizes a total potential, $P_{total}(\\phi)$. The angle $\\phi$ is measured in the plane of growth relative to the axis of the previous cell division.\n\n1.  **System 1 (Static Reference)**: This system is based on a protein, `RefA`, which marks the poles created by the previous division. It provides a static \"memory\" that encourages the cell to divide parallel to the last division, thus promoting chain formation. The potential associated with this system is given by $P_1(\\phi) = C_1 \\cos(2\\phi)$, where $C_1$ is a positive constant representing its strength.\n\n2.  **System 2 (Dynamic Rotator)**: This system uses a protein complex, `RotB`, which forms a focus that actively translocates around the cell's equator at a constant angular speed, $\\Omega$. This rotation starts at $\\phi=0$ at the moment of the cell's birth (time $t=0$). The `RotB` complex promotes FtsZ ring formation at its current location. Its potential is given by $P_2(\\phi, t) = C_2 \\cos(2(\\phi - \\Omega t))$, where $C_2$ is a positive constant representing its strength.\n\nThe bacterium has a fixed cell cycle period of $T_d$. The decision on where to place the new FtsZ ring is made, and division occurs, at time $t=T_d$. The total potential that is maximized is $P_{total}(\\phi) = P_1(\\phi) + P_2(\\phi, T_d)$.\n\nThe goal is to force the bacteria to grow into a stable spiral pattern, where each successive division plane is rotated by a constant angle of $\\theta_s = \\frac{\\pi}{5}$ radians with respect to the previous one. The engineers have tuned the `RotB` system such that the total rotational phase lag per cell cycle is $\\Omega T_d = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians.\n\nTo achieve the desired spiral morphology, what must be the value of the dimensionless ratio of the dynamic system strength to the static system strength, $r = \\frac{C_2}{C_1}$?\n\nRound your final answer to four significant figures.
