This first practice problem explores the critical link between structure and function by examining a bacteriophage's primary point of contact with its host. By considering a defect in the phage's tail fibers, you will apply your knowledge of the lytic infection cycle to pinpoint exactly where the process breaks down, reinforcing the concept that viral attachment is a highly specific and essential first step. [@problem_id:2104956]", "problem": "A research team is investigating a lytic bacteriophage that infects a specific strain of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. They introduce a targeted mutation into the phage's genome that specifically knocks out the gene encoding for the proteins that form the tail fibers. Electron microscopy reveals that the mutant phages are produced successfully within host cells and appear structurally normal, with fully formed capsids containing the viral genome and properly assembled tail sheaths, but they completely lack tail fibers. When these mature, but defective, phage particles are harvested and introduced into a fresh, susceptible bacterial culture, which of the following stages of the infection cycle is the *first* to be inhibited?\n\nA. Synthesis of viral nucleic acid and proteins\n\nB. Lysis of the host cell\n\nC. Assembly of new virions\n\nD. Adsorption to the host cell\n\nE. Penetration of the viral genome into the host cell", "solution": "The lytic bacteriophage infection cycle proceeds in the following ordered stages: adsorption (attachment to specific receptors on the bacterial surface), penetration (injection of the viral genome through the cell envelope), synthesis (transcription/translation and replication of viral components), assembly (packaging of genomes into capsids and addition of structural components), and lysis (release of progeny virions through host cell rupture).\n\nTail fibers in many bacteriophages, including those infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mediate specific recognition and binding to receptors on the bacterial surface. This adsorption step is a prerequisite for subsequent penetration of the genome. Without functional tail fibers, the phage cannot bind to the host cell, and therefore cannot initiate penetration. Consequently, none of the downstream intracellular stages (synthesis, assembly, lysis) can occur in the newly exposed host culture.\n\nIn the mutant described, electron microscopy shows that virions are produced and structurally assembled but lack tail fibers. When these defective particles are introduced into a fresh, susceptible culture, the first step that fails is adsorption to the host cell because the necessary receptor-binding apparatus is missing. Penetration, synthesis, assembly, and lysis are all downstream and thus secondarily prevented, but the earliest inhibited stage is adsorption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2104956"}, {"introduction": "Viral assembly is not a spontaneous event but a carefully orchestrated process guided by the virus's own genetic blueprint. This exercise delves into the sophisticated strategy of polyprotein processing, a common mechanism used by RNA viruses to generate multiple proteins from a single lengthy transcript. By analyzing the consequences of a non-functional viral protease, you will see why the precise cleavage of a precursor polyprotein is an absolute requirement for the formation of a stable viral capsid. [@problem_id:2104921]", "problem": "A virology research team is studying a newly discovered non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid and a positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) genome, which they have named \"Leto virus\". The entire viral genome is translated by the host ribosome into a single, large precursor polyprotein of 250 kDa. Embedded within this polyprotein is a viral protease domain, designated 'LP' (Leto Protease), which is responsible for its own excision and the subsequent cleavage of the polyprotein into all the individual mature viral proteins, including the three distinct capsid structural subunits: CS1, CS2, and CS3. The assembly of the icosahedral capsid is dependent on the precise interaction and arrangement of these individual CS1, CS2, and CS3 subunits.\n\nThe researchers introduce a targeted mutation into the viral genome that changes a critical amino acid in the catalytic triad of the LP domain, rendering the protease completely non-functional. The mutation does not affect the transcription or translation of the full-length polyprotein.\n\nBased on your understanding of viral morphogenesis, what is the most likely outcome observed in a host cell infected with this protease-deficient mutant of Leto virus?\n\nA. Structurally normal, fully-assembled virions will be produced, but they will be non-infectious because a host cell protease, while successfully cleaving the polyprotein, does so at incorrect locations.\n\nB. Aberrant, empty capsids will be formed from the spontaneous assembly of the uncleaved 250 kDa polyprotein, but these structures will be unable to package the viral genome.\n\nC. The individual capsid subunits (CS1, CS2, and CS3) will still be produced due to ribosomal frameshifting, leading to the assembly of infectious virions, but at a much lower yield.\n\nD. The uncleaved polyprotein will accumulate within the host cell's cytoplasm, leading to the formation of large, amorphous protein aggregates, as ordered capsid assembly cannot occur without the individual subunits.\n\nE. Fully assembled, infectious virions will form within the cytoplasm, but they will be trapped inside the host cell because the LP protease is also required for cell lysis.", "solution": "Given a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, the incoming genome functions directly as mRNA, and the host ribosome translates it into a single polyprotein. The problem states that all mature viral proteins, including the capsid subunits CS1, CS2, and CS3, are generated exclusively by proteolytic cleavage of this polyprotein by the viral protease LP embedded within it. This is analogous to well-characterized non-enveloped icosahedral (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses), where precise, virus-encoded protease activity is essential for both nonstructural and structural protein maturation.\n\nThe introduced mutation in the catalytic triad of LP renders the protease completely non-functional. Consequently, the polyprotein cannot undergo cis or trans cleavage by LP. Without these cleavages: (i) the structural proteins CS1, CS2, and CS3 are not liberated as individual subunits, so the stoichiometric and conformational prerequisites for icosahedral assembly are not met; (ii) the nonstructural proteins (including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other replication factors) also remain uncleaved and nonfunctional, further preventing genome replication and coordinated morphogenesis. Host cell proteases generally do not replicate the highly specific cleavage pattern of the viral protease and thus do not substitute for LP. Ribosomal frameshifting does not solve this, because the genome is described as a single ORF that relies on post-translational proteolysis to generate all individual proteins; frameshifting would not selectively yield the discrete capsid proteins in the required stoichiometry and is not a described mechanism for such viruses. Because icosahedral assembly requires individually folded CS1, CS2, and CS3 with precise interactions, an intact 250 kDa polyprotein containing both structural and nonstructural domains will not spontaneously assemble into capsids.\n\nTherefore, in the infected cell, the uncleaved polyprotein accumulates. Misfolding and the absence of productive assembly pathways favor aggregation into amorphous protein aggregates rather than ordered capsid formation. This rules out the production of normal or even aberrant capsids and makes cell lysis-dependent release irrelevant, as no virions form.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: host proteases do not correctly process the viral polyprotein to yield normal virions.\n- B is incorrect: the uncleaved polyprotein will not spontaneously assemble into empty capsids.\n- C is incorrect: ribosomal frameshifting is not a viable mechanism here to generate CS1â€“CS3 in lieu of proteolytic processing.\n- D is correct: uncleaved polyprotein accumulation and amorphous aggregates form because ordered capsid assembly requires individually processed subunits.\n- E is incorrect: virions do not assemble at all without proteolytic processing, making any release defect moot.\n\nThus, the most likely observed outcome is accumulation of the uncleaved polyprotein in amorphous aggregates within the cytoplasm, with failure of capsid assembly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2104921"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its genetic and biochemical complexity, a virion is also a physical object subject to fundamental spatial constraints.
