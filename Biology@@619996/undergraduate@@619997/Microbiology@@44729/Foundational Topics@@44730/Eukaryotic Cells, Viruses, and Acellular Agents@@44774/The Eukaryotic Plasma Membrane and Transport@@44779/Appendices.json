The yeast is cultured in a medium rich in the amino acid alanine. The intracellular concentration of alanine is found to be consistently lower than the external concentration in the medium. Further investigation reveals a specific integral membrane protein is responsible for bringing alanine into the cell. Experimental analysis confirms two key facts about this transport process:\n1. The transport of alanine does not require the direct hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n2. The movement of alanine is not coupled to the concurrent transport of any other substance, such as protons (H+) or sodium ions (Na+).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following best describes this transport system?\n\nA.

One such transporter is Cdr1p, an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter. The functional unit of Cdr1p is a homodimer (Cdr1p-Cdr1p), which actively pumps a specific antifungal drug out of the cell, preventing the intracellular concentration from reaching a toxic level.\n\nLet's model the system with the following assumptions:\n1.  The rate of drug influx into the cell is a passive process, proportional to the external drug concentration, $C_{out}$. The influx rate is given by $R_{in} = P \\cdot C_{out}$, where $P$ is an effective permeability constant.\n2.  The rate of drug efflux mediated by the Cdr1p dimers follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, given by $R_{out} = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot C_{in}}{K_m + C_{in}}$, where $C_{in}$ is the free intracellular drug concentration, $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant for the drug, and $V_{max}$ is the maximum efflux rate.\n3.  The cell cannot survive if the free intracellular drug concentration $C_{in}$ exceeds a critical toxic threshold, $C_{toxic}$. The maximum tolerable external concentration, $C_{out,max}$, is the concentration that results in $C_{in} = C_{toxic}$ at steady state.\n4.  In a wild-type (WT/WT) strain, both alleles for the `CDR1` gene are functional, leading to a total maximum efflux rate of $V_{max,WT}$.\n\nNow, consider a heterozygous strain (WT/mut) where one allele has a point mutation in its ATPase domain. This mutant protein, `mut-Cdr1p`, is expressed at the same level as the wild-type protein, `WT-Cdr1p`. The proteins randomly assemble into dimers. A `mut-Cdr1p`-`mut-Cdr1p` homodimer is completely non-functional. A `WT-Cdr1p`-`mut-Cdr1p` heterodimer is partially functional due to a dominant-negative effect; its maximum transport rate is a fraction, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5}$, of a fully functional `WT-Cdr1p`-`WT-Cdr1p` homodimer.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the maximum tolerable external drug concentration for the heterozygous strain to that of the wild-type strain, $\\frac{C_{out,max,het}}{C_{out,max,WT}}$.
