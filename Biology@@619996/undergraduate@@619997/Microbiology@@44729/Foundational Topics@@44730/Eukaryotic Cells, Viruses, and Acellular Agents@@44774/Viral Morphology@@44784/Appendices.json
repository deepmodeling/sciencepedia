This theory introduces the triangulation number, $T$, a key parameter that defines the size and complexity of the capsid. This exercise [@problem_id:2104210] provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to apply the fundamental formula linking the total number of protein subunits in a capsid to its specific triangulation number, reinforcing a cornerstone concept of virology.", "problem": "In a molecular virology laboratory, a newly discovered virus is being characterized. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reveals that the virus possesses a perfectly icosahedral capsid. According to the principles of quasi-equivalence described by the Caspar-Klug theory, such capsids are constructed from protein subunits arranged into pentamers and hexamers. The specific geometry and size of any icosahedral capsid can be described by an integer called the triangulation number, denoted by $T$. Biochemical analysis of the purified viral particles determines that the complete capsid is composed of exactly 180 identical protein subunits.\n\nCalculate the triangulation number, $T$, for this newly discovered virus.", "solution": "The problem asks for the triangulation number, $T$, of an icosahedral virus capsid that is composed of a known total number of protein subunits, $N$.\n\nAccording to the Caspar-Klug theory of viral capsid architecture, the total number of subunits, $N$, required to form a closed icosahedral shell with a triangulation number $T$ is given by the formula:\n$$N = 60T$$\n\nThis formula arises from the geometric constraints of building a 'quasi-equivalent' icosahedral lattice. An icosahedron has 12 vertices, each with five-fold rotational symmetry. In a viral capsid, these 12 vertices are always occupied by pentamers (a cluster of 5 protein subunits). This accounts for $12 \\times 5 = 60$ subunits. These 60 subunits are sufficient to form the simplest icosahedral capsid, which has a triangulation number $T=1$.\n\nTo construct larger and more complex capsids with $T > 1$, hexamers (clusters of 6 protein subunits) are inserted systematically onto the faces of the underlying icosahedron. The number of hexamers required for a capsid of a given triangulation number $T$ is $10(T-1)$.\n\nWe can verify the primary formula, $N=60T$, by summing the subunits from both pentamers and hexamers:\n$$N = (\\text{Number of pentamers} \\times 5) + (\\text{Number of hexamers} \\times 6)$$\nSince the number of pentamers is always 12 and the number of hexamers is $10(T-1)$:\n$$N = (12 \\times 5) + (10(T-1) \\times 6)$$\n$$N = 60 + 60(T-1)$$\n$$N = 60 + 60T - 60$$\n$$N = 60T$$\nThis confirms the direct relationship between the total number of subunits and the triangulation number.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the total number of protein subunits is $N = 180$. We can use the derived formula to solve for $T$:\n$$180 = 60T$$\nTo find $T$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$T = \\frac{180}{60}$$\n$$T = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the triangulation number for the virus is 3. A $T=3$ capsid is composed of 12 pentamers and $10(3-1) = 20$ hexamers. The total subunit count is $(12 \\times 5) + (20 \\times 6) = 60 + 120 = 180$, which is consistent with the information provided in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2104210"}, {"introduction": "While mathematical principles define the possible geometries of a viral capsid, the biological assembly process is often more complex, requiring helper proteins to ensure fidelity. Internal scaffolding proteins act as crucial temporary frameworks, guiding the major capsid proteins to form a correctly shaped procapsid. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2104247] challenges you to deduce the morphological consequences of losing this guidance, illustrating how critical regulated assembly pathways are for producing viable virions.", "problem": "A virologist is studying a newly discovered bacteriophage, designated Phage-Σ1 (Sigma-1), which infects *Escherichia coli*. This phage possesses a complex morphology, consisting of an icosahedral head and a contractile tail. The assembly of the phage head requires the formation of an initial protein shell called a procapsid. This process is critically dependent on a non-structural protein known as the internal scaffolding protein, which acts as a temporary framework to guide the correct polymerization of the major capsid protein subunits.\n\nThe virologist creates a mutant strain of Phage-Σ1 through genetic engineering. This mutation results in a complete deletion of the gene encoding the internal scaffolding protein. The mutant phage is then used to infect a culture of susceptible *E. coli*. After allowing sufficient time for phage replication and subsequent cell lysis, the resulting lysate is collected and analyzed using electron microscopy to observe the morphological structures produced.\n\nBased on the known function of internal scaffolding proteins in the assembly of icosahedral viral capsids, which of the following outcomes would be the most predominantly observed feature in the lysate from the mutant phage infection?\n\nA. Normal, infectious Phage-Σ1 virions, but with the total count being significantly lower than in a wild-type infection.\n\nB. Only free-floating viral genomes and individually unassembled capsid and tail protein subunits.\n\nC. A large number of aberrant, non-functional head-related structures, such as elongated protein tubes (polyheads) and smaller-than-normal, misshapen capsids.\n\nD. Perfectly formed but empty procapsids that are incapable of packaging the viral genome, alongside normally assembled tail structures.\n\nE. A chaotic mixture of both helical and icosahedral capsid structures, indicating a loss of morphological specificity.", "solution": "1) State the biological principle: Internal scaffolding proteins are non-structural assembly factors that transiently template the correct curvature, size, and quasi-equivalent geometry of icosahedral procapsids. They promote proper polymerization and prevent off-pathway self-assembly of the major capsid protein.\n\n2) Predict the consequence of deleting the scaffolding gene: Without the internal scaffolding protein, the major capsid protein can still self-assemble, but it lacks the geometric guidance needed to form correctly sized and shaped procapsids. This typically leads to off-pathway products, including elongated tubular structures (polyheads), spirals, and small or misshapen shells, rather than properly formed procapsids.\n\n3) Evaluate each option against the expected phenotype:\n- A: Normal infectious virions at lower yield is inconsistent; the absence of scaffolding prevents correct capsid assembly, so infectious particles are not produced simply at reduced numbers; instead, misassembly predominates.\n- B: Only free genomes and unassembled subunits is unlikely; capsid proteins have intrinsic assembly propensity and, without scaffolding, tend to misassemble rather than remain entirely unassembled.\n- C: A large number of aberrant, non-functional head-related structures (e.g., polyheads and small/misshapen capsids) matches the known phenotype of scaffolding-deficient icosahedral capsid assembly, where coat protein polymerizes incorrectly.\n- D: Perfectly formed but empty procapsids require scaffolding; in its absence, properly formed procapsids are not produced. The empty-but-perfect procapsid phenotype is characteristic of defects in DNA packaging machinery, not scaffolding deletion.\n- E: A mixture of helical and icosahedral capsids indicating a loss of symmetry specificity is not typical; coat proteins remain constrained by their intrinsic interaction geometry. While tubular polyheads may appear, this reflects aberrant head-related assemblies rather than true helical capsid morphogenesis of a distinct symmetry class.\n\n4) Conclusion: The predominant observed feature is the accumulation of aberrant head-related assemblies (polyheads, misshapen/smaller capsids), consistent with loss of scaffolding-mediated templating.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2104247"}, {"introduction": "Bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental observation is a central task in modern virology. Techniques like cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allow us to visualize viruses in 3D, but interpreting this complex data requires a sophisticated understanding of both biology and computational methods. This problem [@problem_id:2104250] places you in the role of a structural biologist, tasking you with designing a robust method to determine a fundamental but elusive property—the absolute handedness of a helical nucleocapsid—from real-world tomographic data.", "problem": "An investigator is studying a newly discovered pleomorphic enveloped virus, named \"Serpensvirus flexilis\". This virus contains a single, long, and highly flexible helical nucleocapsid. The goal of the research is to build a high-resolution structural model of this nucleocapsid, and a critical first step is to determine its absolute chirality (i.e., whether it is a left-handed or right-handed helix).\n\nTo this end, the investigator has prepared purified virions and collected three-dimensional (3D) image data using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). In this technique, a sample is flash-frozen in a vitrified, near-native state. The frozen sample is then placed in a transmission electron microscope and tilted incrementally, with a 2D projection image being recorded at each tilt angle. These 2D projections are then computationally combined to reconstruct a 3D volume, or tomogram, showing the internal structure of each virion.\n\nThe resulting tomograms clearly show the flexible, rope-like nucleocapsid winding and bending within the viral envelope. However, the raw data is noisy, and the continuous curvature of the nucleocapsid makes a direct visual determination of its handedness unreliable.\n\nWhich of the following computational strategies represents the most robust and unambiguous method to determine the absolute chirality of the *Serpensvirus flexilis* nucleocapsid using the 3D tomogram data?\n\nA. Create a maximum intensity projection of the 3D tomogram onto a 2D plane and analyze the resulting 2D image. The handedness can be determined from the crossing patterns of the projected helix.\n\nB. Trace the 3D path of the nucleocapsid's central axis, model it as a space curve, and calculate its torsion using the Frenet-Serret formulas. The sign of the torsion will directly reveal the chirality.\n\nC. Trace the 3D path of the nucleocapsid, extract a series of overlapping 3D subtomograms centered along this path, computationally align all subtomograms to a common straight axis, and average them. The chirality is then determined from the resulting high-resolution, straightened 3D density map.\n\nD. Analyze a single 2D slice from the center of the 3D tomogram that cuts perpendicularly through a segment of the nucleocapsid. The arrangement of densities in this cross-section will reveal the helical handedness.\n\nE. Calculate the 3D Fourier transform of the entire tomogram containing one virion. The handedness can be determined by assigning indices to the layer lines in the resulting 3D power spectrum.\n\nF. Measure the helical pitch (the distance for one full turn) and the diameter of the nucleocapsid at multiple points along its length. The ratio of pitch to diameter determines the handedness.", "solution": "The task is to determine the absolute chirality (left- or right-handedness) of a flexible helical nucleocapsid using 3D cryo-ET tomograms. Absolute chirality is a property of the full 3D density and cannot be robustly inferred from 2D data or from quantities that are invariant under mirror inversion. Therefore, any method that reduces the 3D information to 2D, discards phase information, or uses geometric scalars that do not encode handedness will be ambiguous.\n\nOption A is not robust because a maximum intensity projection collapses the 3D tomogram into a 2D image, destroying depth cues. A left-handed and a right-handed helix related by mirror inversion produce indistinguishable 2D projection crossing patterns. Thus, 2D projections do not provide unambiguous absolute chirality.\n\nOption B proposes computing torsion from a traced 3D centerline using Frenet-Serret formulas. For a canonical helix parameterized as $r(t) = (a \\cos t, a \\sin t, bt)$, the curvature and torsion are\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{a}{a^{2} + b^{2}}, \\quad \\tau = \\frac{b}{a^{2} + b^{2}}.\n$$\nWhile the sign of $b$ correlates with handedness in a fixed right-handed coordinate system and fixed curve orientation, in practice both the ambient coordinate system handedness and the tracing direction are arbitrary in tomographic reconstructions, and reversing the parameter direction changes the sign of $\\tau$. Moreover, for a flexible, bending filament, local torsion varies and is noisy. Consequently, the sign of torsion is not an unambiguous or robust indicator of absolute chirality in this context.\n\nOption C uses a fully 3D, alignment-and-averaging strategy tailored to flexible filaments. By tracing the 3D path, extracting overlapping 3D subtomograms along the filament, aligning them to a common straight axis (i.e., computationally straightening or unbending the filament), and averaging, one produces a high signal-to-noise 3D density that preserves the absolute hand inherited from the tomogram. Because cryo-ET reconstructs a 3D volume with known tilt geometry, the absolute handedness is defined in the tomogram, and consistent 3D alignment and averaging enhance chiral features rather than destroy them. This is a standard, robust approach in subtomogram averaging of flexible helical assemblies and directly reveals handedness in the resulting straightened 3D map.\n\nOption D relies on a single 2D slice perpendicular to the filament. A cross-section provides radial density information but is mirror-symmetric and identical for left- and right-handed helices; therefore, it cannot determine handedness.\n\nOption E proposes determining handedness from the 3D power spectrum (magnitude of the Fourier transform). The power spectrum discards phase information and is invariant under inversion, so it cannot encode chirality. Furthermore, flexibility and the missing wedge in tomography smear layer lines, making indexing alone insufficient even aside from the fundamental phase-loss ambiguity.\n\nOption F uses pitch and diameter. These geometric magnitudes are identical for left- and right-handed helices with the same parameters, so their ratio does not encode chirality.\n\nTherefore, the only robust and unambiguous method among the options that leverages the full 3D information, preserves absolute hand, and improves signal-to-noise to reveal chirality is the subtomogram extraction, alignment, straightening, and averaging approach described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2104250"}]}
