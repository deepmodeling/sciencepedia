{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The elegant, rhythmic beating of cilia and flagella is not a passive process but an active one, driven by molecular machines that consume energy. This first practice invites you to explore the fundamental link between chemical energy and mechanical motion within the axoneme. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the 'engine' of the cilium, the dynein motor protein, is specifically prevented from using its fuel source, ATP, you can build your intuition about how this intricate system functions at its most basic level [@problem_id:2064484].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the motility of a eukaryotic, single-celled organism that navigates its aquatic environment using cilia. The researcher exposes a sample of these organisms to a newly synthesized compound called \"motilin-inhibitor X\". This compound is known to be a highly specific inhibitor that binds to the motor protein dynein, located within the ciliary axoneme. The binding of motilin-inhibitor X specifically blocks the ability of dynein to hydrolyze Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). After a sufficient incubation period for the compound to take effect, the researcher observes the organisms under a microscope.\n\nAssuming the compound has no other effects on the cell, which of the following is the most likely observation regarding the organism's cilia?\n\nA. The cilia will be shed from the cell surface as the connection to the basal bodies is severed.\n\nB. The cilia will continue to beat, but their movement will be erratic and uncoordinated, leading to random tumbling of the organism.\n\nC. The cilia will beat with a much higher frequency, causing the organism to move faster.\n\nD. The cilia will become rigid and cease all movement, while remaining attached to the cell.\n\nE. The microtubule structure of the cilia will completely disassemble, leading to their disappearance.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the cellular machinery responsible for ciliary beating. Eukaryotic cilia contain an axoneme with a \"9+2\" arrangement of microtubules. Axonemal dynein arms attached to the A-tubule of one doublet walk along the B-tubule of the adjacent doublet. This activity is a mechanochemical cycle that requires ATP hydrolysis; dynein uses the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to undergo conformational changes that generate force.\n\nStep 2: State the principle linking ATP hydrolysis to motion. Dynein’s power stroke depends on ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release. Without the ability to hydrolyze ATP, dynein cannot produce sliding forces between microtubule doublets. In intact cilia, nexin links and radial spokes constrain sliding and convert it into bending; thus, dynein-driven sliding is essential for ciliary beating.\n\nStep 3: Infer the effect of inhibiting dynein ATPase. The compound specifically blocks dynein’s ATP hydrolysis, so dynein cannot generate force. Therefore, there is no sliding between microtubule doublets and no bending. The axoneme remains structurally intact because the inhibition is functional, not structural.\n\nStep 4: Determine structural consequences. The basal body anchoring and the microtubule polymer integrity do not depend on dynein’s ATPase activity. Thus:\n- The cilia are not shed because basal body connections are unaffected.\n- The microtubules do not disassemble; tubulin dynamics and axonemal architecture are not directly disrupted by dynein ATPase inhibition.\n- There is no erratic or faster beating; rather, beating ceases because force generation is abolished.\n\nStep 5: Synthesize the most likely observation. With dynein immobilized in a non-force-generating state, the cilia remain attached and become rigid/immotile, consistent with classic phenotypes seen in dynein-arm defects (e.g., primary ciliary dyskinesia).\n\nStep 6: Eliminate incorrect options.\n- A is incorrect: shedding requires disruption of basal body anchoring, not dynein ATPase inhibition.\n- B is incorrect: erratic motion requires impaired coordination, but here there is no force generation, so no beating occurs.\n- C is incorrect: higher frequency requires enhanced ATP turnover, not inhibited ATP hydrolysis.\n- E is incorrect: complete disassembly would require destabilization of microtubules, not dynein inhibition.\n- D is correct: the cilia become rigid and cease movement, while remaining attached.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2064484"}, {"introduction": "Having established that ATP hydrolysis powers dynein motors, a new question arises: how are the actions of thousands of these motors coordinated to produce a coherent, wave-like bend instead of a chaotic tug-of-war? This practice delves into the structural basis of this coordination by focusing on the conserved \"9+2\" architecture of the axoneme. By analyzing a thought experiment involving a sperm flagellum that hypothetically lacks the central pair of microtubules, you will uncover the critical regulatory role this central apparatus plays in converting microtubule sliding into productive motility [@problem_id:2064449].", "problem": "The motility of eukaryotic cells like sperm is powered by the flagellum, a complex molecular machine. The core of the flagellum, known as the axoneme, typically exhibits a \"9+2\" arrangement of microtubules, consisting of nine outer microtubule doublets arranged in a circle around a central pair of single microtubules. Motor proteins called dynein arms, attached to the outer doublets, use Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to generate force, causing the doublets to slide past one another. This sliding is converted into the characteristic bending or wave-like motion of the flagellum by the action of radial spokes that connect the outer doublets to the central pair.\n\nImagine a hypothetical genetic condition where a male's sperm cells are formed with flagella that have a \"9+0\" axoneme structure. In this structure, the nine outer microtubule doublets and the associated dynein arms are present and functional, but the central pair of microtubules is completely absent. All other components, including the radial spokes, are synthesized but have no central structure to attach to.\n\nBased on this structural defect, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the motility of these \"9+0\" sperm cells?\n\nA. The flagella will rotate in a corkscrew-like manner, similar to prokaryotic flagella.\n\nB. The flagella will beat with a normal wave-like pattern, but with significantly reduced force and speed.\n\nC. The flagella will be immotile because the sliding of outer doublets cannot be converted into a coordinated bending motion.\n\nD. The flagella will function normally, as motility is generated solely by the dynein arms acting on the outer doublets.", "solution": "The eukaryotic flagellar beat arises from dynein-driven sliding between outer microtubule doublets that is converted into bending through constraints and regulation provided by axonemal structures. In a canonical \"9+2\" axoneme, two key features enable a coordinated, propagating bend:\n1) Mechanical constraints (e.g., nexin links and geometric coupling) that limit unrestricted sliding so that sliding produces curvature.\n2) Regulatory asymmetry governed by the central pair and radial spokes, which modulate dynein activity around the circumference to generate a planar or helical bending waveform rather than symmetric isometric tug-of-war.\n\nIn the hypothetical \"9+0\" sperm described, dynein arms on the nine outer doublets remain present and can hydrolyze ATP to generate sliding forces, but the central pair is absent. Although radial spokes are synthesized, they have no central pair to interact with and therefore cannot provide the central pair–radial spoke regulatory coupling that normally biases dynein activation to one side at a time. Without this regulatory asymmetry, opposing dynein teams around the circumference tend to engage simultaneously, producing balanced, antagonistic sliding forces that are resisted by cross-linking constraints. This yields little to no net bending and prevents the emergence of a coordinated wave.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect: eukaryotic flagella do not employ a rotary motor like prokaryotic flagella, and the absence of the central pair does not convert eukaryotic flagella into corkscrew rotors.\n- Option B is incorrect: the normal wave-like pattern specifically requires central pair–radial spoke regulation; its absence does not merely reduce force or speed but disrupts waveform generation.\n- Option D is incorrect: dynein arms alone are insufficient for organized motility; central pair–radial spoke interactions are essential for coordinated bending.\n\nThe most accurate prediction is that these \"9+0\" sperm will be immotile because dynein-driven sliding cannot be converted into a coordinated bending motion without central pair–radial spoke coupling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2064449"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of cilia and flagella is built upon decades of ingenious experiments designed to take apart these complex machines and study their components. This final practice situates you at the research bench, tasking you with interpreting the results of a classic molecular genetics experiment. By analyzing how chimeric, or hybrid, dynein proteins behave in a mutant organism, you will learn how scientists can precisely map a functional defect to a specific domain of a protein, a powerful technique for understanding structure-function relationships in molecular motors [@problem_id:2064459].", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the function of dynein motor proteins, which are essential for the beating motion of eukaryotic flagella. They are using the model organism *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*. A particular mutant strain, designated `oda1`, completely lacks a specific outer arm dynein heavy chain protein, which we will call DHC-$\\alpha$. This renders the `oda1` strain's flagella completely paralyzed.\n\nThe researchers have identified a homologous dynein heavy chain, DHC-$\\beta$, from a related but non-motile species of algae. Structurally, dynein heavy chains consist of a large, globular \"motor head\" domain that hydrolyzes Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to generate force, and an extended, fibrous \"stalk\" domain which contains the site that binds to microtubules. When the gene for this foreign DHC-$\\beta$ is expressed in the `oda1` mutant, the paralyzed phenotype is not rescued; the flagella remain immobile. The reason for DHC-$\\beta$'s non-functionality is unknown.\n\nTo locate the defect, the team constructs two chimeric (hybrid) dynein genes. These genes are then expressed individually in the `oda1` null mutant background. The chimeras are composed as follows:\n- **Chimera A:** The motor head from the non-functional DHC-$\\beta$ is fused to the stalk from the functional DHC-$\\alpha$.\n- **Chimera B:** The motor head from the functional DHC-$\\alpha$ is fused to the stalk from the non-functional DHC-$\\beta$.\n\nUpon expressing these chimeras in the `oda1` mutant, the team observes the following results regarding flagellar motility:\n- `oda1` cells expressing Chimera A remain paralyzed.\n- `oda1` cells expressing Chimera B display fully restored, wild-type flagellar beating.\n\nBased on this experimental evidence, where is the functional defect in the DHC-$\\beta$ protein located?\n\nA. The defect is in the motor head domain.\n\nB. The defect is in the stalk domain.\n\nC. The defect is present in both the motor head and the stalk domains.\n\nD. The DHC-$\\beta$ protein is likely functional, but its domains are incompatible with the other dynein components present in *Chlamydomonas*.\n\nE. The experiment is inconclusive and cannot distinguish between a motor head or a stalk defect.", "solution": "We begin by defining the domains and their functional roles. The dynein heavy chain consists of a motor head domain that hydrolyzes ATP to generate force and a stalk domain that binds to microtubules. The wild-type DHC-$\\alpha$ is functional in the *Chlamydomonas* axoneme, whereas the foreign DHC-$\\beta$ does not rescue motility when expressed in the `oda1` null mutant, indicating that at least one of its domains (motor head or stalk) is non-functional or incompatible in this context.\n\nThe experimental design uses two chimeras:\n- Chimera A: motor head from DHC-$\\beta$ fused to stalk from DHC-$\\alpha$.\n- Chimera B: motor head from DHC-$\\alpha$ fused to stalk from DHC-$\\beta$.\n\nObservation 1: Chimera B restores wild-type motility. The motor head in Chimera B is from DHC-$\\alpha$ and is known to be functional. Restoration of motility requires that the stalk domain in this chimera binds microtubules properly and supports force transmission. Therefore, the DHC-$\\beta$ stalk in the *Chlamydomonas* environment is functional and compatible with the rest of the dynein complex and axonemal architecture. This rules out a defect in the DHC-$\\beta$ stalk domain.\n\nObservation 2: Chimera A fails to restore motility and cells remain paralyzed. In this chimera, the stalk is from DHC-$\\alpha$ and is known to be functional and compatible. Therefore, the failure must arise from the DHC-$\\beta$ motor head domain, since the stalk cannot account for the paralysis.\n\nCombining these two observations yields the inference: the DHC-$\\beta$ stalk is functional (from Chimera B), while the DHC-$\\beta$ motor head is defective or incompatible in a manner that abrogates function (from Chimera A). This excludes the possibilities that both domains are defective, that the result is inconclusive, or that the entire protein is merely incompatible, because the DHC-$\\beta$ stalk functions properly when paired with a functional motor head in the same cellular context.\n\nTherefore, the functional defect in DHC-$\\beta$ is localized to the motor head domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2064459"}]}
