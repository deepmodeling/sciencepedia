This problem-solving exercise simulates a classic laboratory approach where simple yet powerful biochemical treatments are used to deconstruct a virus's basic architecture. By analyzing how specific enzymes and organic solvents affect viral infectivity, you can deduce whether a virus has a DNA or RNA genome and whether it is enveloped or non-enveloped. [@problem_id:2068455]", "problem": "A virologist is working to characterize two novel viral isolates, designated Isolate V-1 and Isolate V-2, recovered from an environmental sample. To determine their basic structural and genomic properties, the virologist subjects purified stocks of each virus to three different treatments. After each treatment, the infectivity of the viral preparation is tested on a susceptible host cell line. The treatments and their results are summarized below:\n\n1.  **Treatment with deoxyribonuclease (DNAse):** This enzyme specifically degrades DNA molecules.\n    *   Isolate V-1: All infectivity is lost.\n    *   Isolate V-2: Infectivity remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Treatment with ribonuclease (RNAse):** This enzyme specifically degrades RNA molecules.\n    *   Isolate V-1: Infectivity remains unchanged.\n    *   Isolate V-2: All infectivity is lost.\n\n3.  **Treatment with ether:** This organic solvent disrupts lipid membranes.\n    *   Isolate V-1: Infectivity remains unchanged.\n    *   Isolate V-2: All infectivity is lost.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the two viral isolates?\n\nA. Isolate V-1 is an enveloped DNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is a non-enveloped RNA virus.\n\nB. Isolate V-1 is a non-enveloped DNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is an enveloped RNA virus.\n\nC. Isolate V-1 is an enveloped RNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is a non-enveloped DNA virus.\n\nD. Isolate V-1 is a non-enveloped RNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is an enveloped DNA virus.\n\nE. Both Isolate V-1 and Isolate V-2 are enveloped viruses.\n\nF. Both Isolate V-1 and Isolate V-2 are non-enveloped viruses.", "solution": "We use three fundamental principles. First, deoxyribonuclease specifically degrades DNA and does not affect RNA; ribonuclease specifically degrades RNA and does not affect DNA. Loss of infectivity after treatment with a nuclease indicates that the viral genome required for initiating infection is of the corresponding nucleic acid type. Second, intact virions can be variably susceptible to nucleases depending on whether their genomes are accessible; in the classical diagnostic setup of this problem, selective loss of infectivity with DNAse versus RNAse is used to infer whether the viral genome is DNA or RNA. Third, ether disrupts lipid bilayers; enveloped viruses require an intact lipid envelope for infectivity and are ether sensitive, whereas non-enveloped viruses lack a lipid membrane and are ether resistant.\n\nApply these to Isolate V-1. DNAse treatment causes complete loss of infectivity, while RNAse has no effect. By the nuclease specificity principle, this pattern indicates a DNA genome. Ether treatment does not reduce infectivity, indicating resistance to lipid disruption, which characterizes non-enveloped viruses. Therefore, Isolate V-1 is a non-enveloped DNA virus.\n\nApply these to Isolate V-2. DNAse has no effect, whereas RNAse abolishes infectivity, indicating an RNA genome. Ether eliminates infectivity, which implies dependence on a lipid envelope and thus an enveloped virion. Therefore, Isolate V-2 is an enveloped RNA virus.\n\nComparing to the options, this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2068455"}, {"introduction": "Once a virus's basic structure is known, the next crucial question is how it replicates. A key piece of this puzzle lies in how the virus initiates the production of its own proteins using the host cell's machinery. This thought experiment guides you through a critical deduction based on a single, powerful observation: the viral genome can serve directly as messenger RNA (mRNA). Understanding this capability allows you to classify the virus's replication strategy and predict the essential enzymes it must encode. [@problem_id:2068469]", "problem": "A virologist is studying a newly discovered infectious agent that targets eukaryotic cells. Initial biochemical analysis reveals a critical characteristic of the viral life cycle: upon entry into the host cell's cytoplasm, the viral genomic material can be immediately translated into viral proteins by the host cell's ribosomes without any prior enzymatic modification or replication of the genome. All necessary genetic material for the virus is composed of Ribonucleic acid (RNA); it does not contain any Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\nBased on this single observation, which of the following statements is the most accurate conclusion about the virus's genome and its replication strategy?\n\nA. The genome consists of positive-sense single-stranded RNA, and it must encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nB. The genome consists of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, and the virion must contain a pre-packaged RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nC. The genome consists of double-stranded RNA, and it must encode a reverse transcriptase to integrate into the host genome.\n\nD. The genome consists of positive-sense single-stranded RNA, and the virus can rely entirely on the host cell's polymerases for its complete replication cycle.\n\nE. The genome consists of single-stranded RNA, and the virion must contain a pre-packaged reverse transcriptase.", "solution": "We are told that, upon entry into the host cell cytoplasm, the viral genome can be immediately translated by host ribosomes without any prior enzymatic modification or replication. In eukaryotic cells, ribosomes translate messenger RNA that is already in the correct orientation and form. Therefore, the only viral genome type that can serve directly as mRNA upon entry is positive-sense single-stranded RNA. Hence, the genome must be positive-sense single-stranded RNA.\n\nNext, consider the replication strategy. To produce progeny genomes from an RNA template, the virus must synthesize a complementary negative-sense RNA and then use that as a template to generate new positive-sense genomes. This requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Host eukaryotic cells do not possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for cytoplasmic RNA genome replication. Therefore, the virus cannot rely entirely on host polymerases for replication and must encode its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For positive-sense RNA viruses, this polymerase does not need to be packaged in the virion because the incoming genome can be translated immediately to produce it.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A states positive-sense single-stranded RNA and that it must encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This matches the reasoning above.\n- B states negative-sense single-stranded RNA with a pre-packaged RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. While negative-sense RNA viruses indeed must carry a polymerase and cannot be directly translated, this contradicts the observation of immediate translation.\n- C states double-stranded RNA with reverse transcriptase for integration. Double-stranded RNA viruses replicate via an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and do not require reverse transcription or integration; moreover, dsRNA cannot be directly translated upon entry.\n- D states positive-sense single-stranded RNA and reliance entirely on host polymerases. This is incorrect because host cells lack RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; the virus must encode it.\n- E states single-stranded RNA with a pre-packaged reverse transcriptase. That describes retroviruses, which require a DNA intermediate and reverse transcription; this contradicts both the immediate translation observation and the stipulation that the virus relies solely on RNA as its genetic material without a DNA stage in the viral genetic material.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the genome is positive-sense single-stranded RNA and it must encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2068469"}, {"introduction": "Virologists use plaque assays as a powerful visual tool to study the effects of a viral infection on a population of host cells. The physical characteristics of a plaque, such as its size and clarity, provide a window into the virus's life cycle and its efficiency at killing and spreading. This practice challenges you to think like a viral geneticist, connecting an observable change in plaque morphology to a specific mutation in the viral genome, thereby linking genotype to phenotype. [@problem_id:2068424]", "problem": "A virologist is studying a novel lytic DNA virus, named \"Cytocidavirus,\" which forms large, clear plaques on a monolayer of human epithelial cells in culture. A plaque is a visible zone of cell death caused by viral infection and lysis. Through chemical mutagenesis, a mutant strain of the virus, designated M-1, is isolated. When compared to the wild-type (WT) virus under identical conditions, the M-1 mutant is observed to form plaques that are both significantly smaller and turbid (cloudy). The turbidity indicates the presence of a substantial population of viable host cells within the plaque area.\n\nThe Cytocidavirus genome encodes several key proteins, including:\n- `PolV`: The primary viral DNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome.\n- `CapF`: The major structural protein that forms the viral capsid.\n- `LytA`: A late-expression protein that degrades the host cell membrane to facilitate virion release.\n- `RegS`: A regulatory protein that, in the wild-type virus, represses a set of genes required for establishing a latent (non-lytic) state, thereby committing the virus to the lytic cycle.\n\nAssuming a single mutation is responsible for the new phenotype, which of the following genetic changes in the M-1 mutant most plausibly explains the formation of small, turbid plaques?\n\nA. A missense mutation in `PolV` that quadruples its processivity (the number of nucleotides added per association event) but also increases its error rate.\n\nB. A mutation in `CapF` that causes it to misfold at the physiological temperature of the cell culture, preventing the assembly of stable virions.\n\nC. A gain-of-function mutation in `LytA` that causes it to be expressed earlier in the replication cycle.\n\nD. A mutation in the promoter for the `CapF` gene, leading to a ten-fold increase in the transcription of its messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nE. A loss-of-function mutation in `RegS` that renders the protein unable to bind to its target DNA sequence.", "solution": "We analyze how plaque size and clarity relate to viral life cycle traits.\n\nPrinciples:\n- Plaque size reflects the rate of spread, which depends on replication speed, burst size, timing of lysis, and stability of virions. Faster replication and larger burst sizes tend to produce larger plaques; premature lysis or inefficient assembly tends to reduce plaque size.\n- Plaque clarity reflects the fraction of infected cells that undergo lysis. Clear plaques indicate nearly all infected cells lyse. Turbid plaques indicate many infected cells survive, classically due to establishment of a latent (temperate) state in a subset of infections.\n\nGiven WT makes large, clear plaques (efficient lytic cycle), while M-1 makes small, turbid plaques (slower spread plus many viable cells within plaques), the most plausible single mutation is one that allows or increases entry into a latent, non-lytic state, thereby reducing lytic killing and propagation.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A. A more processive but more error-prone polymerase could alter fitness. Increased processivity should speed replication, but higher error rate could generate defective genomes, potentially decreasing effective yield. However, this does not explain turbidity arising from viable infected cells; it would still be a lytic cycle when infection succeeds, producing clear (albeit smaller) plaques. Not the best match for turbid plaques.\n- B. Misfolded capsid at physiological temperature would block assembly, preventing spread beyond initially infected cells. This would yield no plaques or, at most, pinpoint foci, not characteristic small turbid plaques, and would not explain survival of many infected cells within the plaque area. Not consistent.\n- C. Early expression of the lysis protein would cause premature lysis, reducing burst size and slowing spread, leading to smaller plaques, but would still lyse infected cells, producing clear plaques, not turbid ones. Inconsistent with turbidity.\n- D. Upregulated capsid expression would tend to increase assembly efficiency and yield, favoring larger plaques and maintained clarity. Opposite of the observation.\n- E. Loss-of-function in RegS removes repression of latent-state genes, allowing establishment of a latent (non-lytic) state in a subset of infections. This reduces the fraction of cells undergoing lysis, producing turbid plaques, and decreases the effective reproductive number per cycle (fewer lytic events), slowing spread and yielding smaller plaques. This precisely matches small, turbid plaques.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible single mutation is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2068424"}]}
