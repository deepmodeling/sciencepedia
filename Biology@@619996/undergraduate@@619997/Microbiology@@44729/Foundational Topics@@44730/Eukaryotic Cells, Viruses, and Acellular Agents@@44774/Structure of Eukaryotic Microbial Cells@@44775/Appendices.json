This thought experiment challenges you to consider the critical role of this structure by applying the principles of osmosis. By predicting the fate of a yeast cell stripped of its wall and placed in pure water, you will gain a concrete understanding of why this barrier is essential for survival in hypotonic environments [@problem_id:2094783].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the properties of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. In an experiment, a sample of yeast cells is treated with a combination of enzymes that completely and specifically digest the chitin, glucans, and mannoproteins that form their rigid cell walls, leaving the plasma membrane intact. These resulting structures, known as protoplasts, are then immediately transferred from an isotonic buffer solution into a beaker containing pure, distilled water. Assuming the plasma membrane remains perfectly semi-permeable (allowing water to pass but not solutes), which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of these yeast protoplasts?\n\nA. The protoplasts will shrivel as essential solutes leak out through the destabilized plasma membrane.\n\nB. The protoplasts will rapidly swell with water and ultimately burst.\n\nC. The protoplasts will remain unchanged in size and shape, as the plasma membrane actively regulates internal water volume.\n\nD. The protoplasts will begin to actively pump water out of the cytoplasm to counteract the influx, consuming cellular energy.\n\nE. The protoplasts will quickly synthesize a new cell wall, preventing any significant change in volume.", "solution": "We model the protoplast as a compartment bounded by a perfectly semi-permeable plasma membrane that allows water to pass but not solutes. Let the intracellular solute concentration be $C_{\\text{in}} > 0$ and the extracellular solute concentration in distilled water be $C_{\\text{out}} = 0$. The van 't Hoff relation gives the osmotic pressure for an ideal dilute solution as\n$$\n\\Pi = i R T C,\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Therefore, the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane immediately after transfer to distilled water is\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\text{in}} - \\Pi_{\\text{out}} = i R T \\left(C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{out}}\\right) = i R T C_{\\text{in}} > 0.\n$$\nBecause the membrane is semi-permeable to water, water will move in the direction that reduces the difference in water chemical potential, equivalently down the water potential gradient. In terms of pressures, water influx continues until the hydrostatic pressure difference $\\Delta P$ across the membrane balances the osmotic pressure difference, i.e.,\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\Delta \\Pi.\n$$\nIn a cell lacking a rigid wall, the only mechanical resistance is the membrane tension. For a roughly spherical protoplast, the mechanical balance between membrane tension $\\gamma$ and the transmembrane hydrostatic pressure is given by the Laplace relation\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\gamma}{r},\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the cell radius. To halt osmotic influx without a wall, the membrane would need to sustain a tension $\\gamma = \\frac{r}{2} \\Delta \\Pi$. However, biological lipid bilayers have a finite critical tension $\\gamma_{c}$ beyond which they rupture. For typical intracellular solute concentrations (so that $i R T C_{\\text{in}}$ is substantial), the required $\\Delta P$ to balance $\\Delta \\Pi$ exceeds what a naked plasma membrane can support before failure, so the membrane will stretch only slightly, the volume will rapidly increase, and the bilayer will rupture (osmotic lysis) before a stable mechanical equilibrium is achieved.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the membrane is specified to remain intact and semi-permeable to water only, so essential solutes do not immediately leak out.\n- C is incorrect because the plasma membrane does not actively regulate water volume; water flux is passive under the given conditions.\n- D is incorrect because cells do not possess active pumps that expel water directly; while they can pump ions, immediate compensation in pure water is not feasible and would not prevent the rapid influx.\n- E is incorrect because new cell wall synthesis is not immediate, and the osmotic imbalance would cause lysis before protective structures could be reassembled.\n\nTherefore, the immediate fate is rapid swelling with water and bursting due to osmotic lysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2094783"}, {"introduction": "While textbooks often depict organelles as static entities, the internal landscape of a cell is in constant flux. The mitochondrial network, for instance, is continuously reshaped by a balance between division (fission) and merging (fusion). This practice problem explores the consequences of disrupting this balance, offering a deeper insight into how cells actively manage the architecture and function of their internal compartments [@problem_id:2094757].", "problem": "In the eukaryotic microorganism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast), the mitochondrion is not a static organelle but exists as a dynamic, tubular network. The overall morphology of this network is governed by a delicate balance between two opposing processes: mitochondrial fission, which divides mitochondria into smaller units, and mitochondrial fusion, which joins them into larger structures.\n\nThe process of mitochondrial fission is critically dependent on a protein named Dnm1. Dnm1 is a dynamin-related Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) that assembles into rings around the mitochondrial outer membrane, constricting it and ultimately leading to scission.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of yeast in which the gene encoding the Dnm1 protein has been deleted, resulting in a complete loss of its function. In this mutant, the cellular machinery responsible for mitochondrial fusion remains fully operational.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following descriptions best characterizes the expected steady-state morphology of the mitochondrial network in this Dnm1-deficient yeast cell?\n\nA. Numerous small, punctate, and fragmented mitochondria distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nB. A highly elongated and interconnected, net-like reticulum.\n\nC. A normal wild-type morphology, consisting of several discrete, tubular mitochondria.\n\nD. A complete absence of mitochondria, as they cannot be properly formed or maintained.\n\nE. A single, large, spherical mitochondrion located adjacent to the nucleus.", "solution": "1) Principle: Mitochondrial morphology at steady state reflects a balance between opposing processes, fusion and fission. Denote the effective fusion rate by $k_{\\text{fus}}$ and the effective fission rate by $k_{\\text{fis}}$. A wild-type steady state satisfies $k_{\\text{fus}} \\approx k_{\\text{fis}}$, yielding several discrete, tubular mitochondria.\n\n2) Mechanism: Dnm1 is essential for mitochondrial fission in yeast. Deletion of the Dnm1 gene eliminates Dnm1 function, which functionally sets $k_{\\text{fis}} \\to 0$ while leaving $k_{\\text{fus}}$ unchanged and fully active.\n\n3) Consequence: With $k_{\\text{fis}} \\approx 0$ and $k_{\\text{fus}} > 0$, the balance is shifted entirely toward fusion. Therefore, individual mitochondrial units will tend to merge into larger, elongated, and interconnected structures, increasing average length and connectivity of the network.\n\n4) Option evaluation:\n- A (numerous small, punctate, fragmented): requires elevated fission and/or impaired fusion; inconsistent with $k_{\\text{fis}} \\to 0$ and intact fusion.\n- B (highly elongated, interconnected reticulum): matches the predicted fusion-dominant morphology.\n- C (normal wild-type morphology): would require $k_{\\text{fus}} \\approx k_{\\text{fis}}$, not true here.\n- D (absence of mitochondria): mitochondria can still be maintained without fission; false.\n- E (single large spherical mitochondrion): loss of fission favors elongation and interconnection rather than a single spherical organelle; false.\n\nTherefore, the best description is a highly elongated and interconnected, net-like reticulum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2094757"}, {"introduction": "A cell's function relies on a sophisticated system for sorting and delivering thousands of proteins to their correct locations.

The Vacuole", "solution": "The relevant cell biology principles for protein localization in eukaryotic cells are:\n- Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and require an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (presequence) to be recognized by cytosolic receptors and the TOM/TIM translocase complexes for import into the mitochondrion.\n- In the absence of a targeting signal, the default localization for a stable, soluble protein synthesized on free ribosomes is the cytosol.\n- Nuclear import requires a nuclear localization signal (NLS) recognized by importins; endoplasmic reticulum targeting requires an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by the signal recognition particle, leading to co-translational translocation into the ER; secretion requires ER entry followed by transit through the Golgi; vacuolar (lysosomal) localization in yeast generally requires ER entry and specific vacuolar targeting information.\n\nLogical steps:\n1. The wild-type MitoEnzyme-X normally localizes to the mitochondrial matrix due to an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that directs post-translational import via TOM/TIM. This requires the presence of the targeting signal.\n2. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the gene segment encoding the mitochondrial targeting sequence removes the necessary targeting information for mitochondrial import.\n3. The modified protein is synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and is stable and correctly folded, and the problem states there are no other targeting signals present.\n4. Without an NLS, the protein will not be imported into the nucleus.\n5. Without an ER signal peptide, the protein will not enter the ER; therefore it cannot be secreted nor routed to the vacuole, both of which require ER entry.\n6. Therefore, by the default pathway, the protein will remain in and accumulate in the cytosol.\n\nConclusion: The modified MitoEnzyme-X will predominantly accumulate in the cytoplasm (cytosol).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2094775"}]}
