The procedure involves first gently lysing the yeast cells. Subsequently, two subcellular fractions are isolated using differential centrifugation: one fraction is highly enriched for nuclei, and the other is highly enriched for mitochondria. The total DNA is then carefully purified from each of these two fractions, a process designed to minimize fragmentation and preserve the natural topology of the DNA molecules.\n\nAn equal amount of DNA from the nuclear fraction (Sample N) and the mitochondrial fraction (Sample M) is loaded into separate wells of an agarose gel. Electrophoresis is then carried out, and the gel is stained to visualize the DNA.\n\nBased on the fundamental structural differences between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotes, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected result seen on the stained gel?\n\nA. The lane containing Sample N will show a single band that has migrated significantly farther down the gel than the single band from Sample M.\n\nB. Both lanes for Sample N and Sample M will show a continuous smear of DNA from the top to the bottom of the gel, rendering them indistinguishable.\n\nC. The lane containing Sample M will display a pattern of multiple, distinct bands, whereas the lane containing Sample N will show one very bright, high-molecular-weight band that has barely migrated from the loading well.\n\nD.

Both lanes will show a pattern of multiple bands, but the bands in the lane for Sample M will be located much farther down the gel than the bands in the lane for Sample N.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the relevant structural differences between the DNA sources.\n- In eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nuclear DNA is organized into multiple linear chromosomes with very high molecular weights (megabase scale). When purified gently to preserve integrity, these long linear molecules remain largely intact.\n- Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in yeast is typically circular and present in many copies per cell. Critically, intact circular DNA exists in multiple topological forms: covalently closed supercoiled circles, relaxed (nicked) open circles, linearized circles, and higher-order concatenated or dimeric species.\n\nStep 2: State the physical principle governing agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA.\n- Agarose gel electrophoresis separates DNA based on size and conformation under an applied electric field. For linear DNA, mobility decreases with increasing length, approximately following a log-linear dependence over a workable size range; extremely large linear DNA (megabase-sized chromosomes) typically fails to enter the gel and remains near the well as a high-molecular-weight mass.\n- For circular DNA, mobility depends on both size and topology. At the same molecular weight, supercoiled DNA migrates faster (appears lower in the gel) than linear DNA, while nicked (relaxed) circular DNA migrates more slowly (appears higher in the gel). Consequently, intact circular DNA often appears as multiple discrete bands corresponding to different topological forms.\n\nStep 3: Predict the pattern for the nuclear fraction (Sample N).\n- Because the nuclear DNA consists of intact, extremely large linear chromosomes and the preparation minimizes fragmentation, the bulk of the DNA will barely enter the gel, forming a very bright, high-molecular-weight band that remains at or just below the loading well, rather than resolving into discrete bands on a standard agarose gel.\n- A distinct ladder of chromosome-sized bands would require pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, not a standard agarose gel.\n\nStep 4: Predict the pattern for the mitochondrial fraction (Sample M).\n- The mtDNA is circular and exists in multiple topological forms. Under conditions that preserve native topology, these forms resolve into multiple distinct bands: a fast-migrating supercoiled band, a slower-migrating nicked/relaxed circular band, and potentially linear and higher-order species. Therefore, Sample M will display multiple discrete bands rather than a single band or a smear.\n\nStep 5: Match predictions to the provided options.\n- Option C states that Sample M shows multiple distinct bands (consistent with mtDNA topoisomers), and Sample N shows one very bright, high-molecular-weight band that has barely migrated from the loading well (consistent with intact nuclear chromosomes on a standard gel). This aligns with the physical principles and structural differences described above.\n- Other options are inconsistent: A reverses expected mobilities; B predicts indistinguishable smears despite preserved topology; D incorrectly predicts a single sharp mtDNA band and a nuclear chromosome ladder (the latter requires pulsed-field conditions); E incorrectly predicts multiple bands for the nuclear fraction on a standard gel and places mtDNA bands uniformly farther down without acknowledging topological heterogeneity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2064716"}, {"introduction": "Mitochondria are often called the \"powerhouses of the cell,\" but their biogenesis is a cooperative effort between two distinct genetic systems. This problem delves into the assembly of a vital respiratory enzyme, Cytochrome c Oxidase, whose components originate from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. By considering the specific actions of two different protein synthesis inhibitors, you will explore the elegant experimental logic used to confirm the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and appreciate their intricate dependence on the rest of the cell [@problem_id:2064729].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the biogenesis of components of the electron transport chain in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The focus of the study is Complex IV, also known as Cytochrome c Oxidase, a large multi-subunit enzyme complex embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is essential for aerobic respiration. It is known that for a single, fully functional Cytochrome c Oxidase complex to be assembled, protein subunits encoded by genes from two distinct genomes are required: the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome.\n\nTo dissect the synthesis pathways, the researcher employs two well-characterized protein synthesis inhibitors:\n1.  **Chloramphenicol**: An antibiotic that specifically binds to the large subunit of $70S$ ribosomes, inhibiting peptide bond formation.\n2.  **Cycloheximide**: A fungicide that specifically interferes with the translocation step during protein synthesis on $80S$ ribosomes.\n\nThe 'S' in $70S$ and $80S$ refers to the Svedberg unit, a non-additive measure of a particle's sedimentation rate under centrifugation.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to completely prevent the *de novo* assembly of any new, fully functional Cytochrome c Oxidase complexes in a growing yeast culture. Which of the following experimental strategies would achieve this objective?\n\nA. Treat the yeast culture with Chloramphenicol only.\n\nB. Treat the yeast culture with Cycloheximide only.\n\nC. Treat the yeast culture with both Chloramphenicol and Cycloheximide.\n\nD. Apply neither inhibitor, but grow the yeast in an anaerobic environment.\n\nE. Treat the yeast culture with both inhibitors, but also supplement the media with purified Cytochrome c Oxidase.", "solution": "We identify the biological requirements for de novo assembly of a fully functional Cytochrome c Oxidase (Complex IV) in yeast. Complex IV is composed of subunits encoded by two genomes: mitochondrial DNA encodes core subunits synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes (which are of the bacterial type and are inhibited by chloramphenicol), and nuclear DNA encodes multiple accessory subunits synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes (which are eukaryotic $80S$ and are inhibited by cycloheximide). A fully functional complex requires the presence and correct assembly of both mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits; if either set is missing, complete assembly cannot occur.\n\nLinking inhibitors to their targets:\n- Chloramphenicol specifically inhibits translation on $70S$-type ribosomes by binding the large subunit and blocking peptidyl transfer. In eukaryotic cells, this primarily inhibits mitochondrial translation, thereby preventing synthesis of mitochondrial-encoded subunits such as Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3, which are essential for Complex IV function.\n- Cycloheximide specifically inhibits $80S$ cytosolic ribosomes by blocking translocation, thereby preventing synthesis of nuclear-encoded subunits required for Complex IV assembly and stability.\n\nTo guarantee complete prevention of de novo assembly of any new, fully functional Complex IV, both sources of subunits must be unavailable. If only one translation system is inhibited, in principle preexisting pools of the other class of subunits could still support some assembly. Therefore, the strategy that ensures no new mitochondrial-encoded subunits and no new nuclear-encoded subunits are produced is to treat with both inhibitors simultaneously.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (Chloramphenicol only): Blocks mitochondrial translation; nuclear-encoded subunits could still be synthesized and, depending on preexisting mitochondrial subunit pools, limited assembly might still occur. Not guaranteed to completely prevent assembly under all conditions.\n- B (Cycloheximide only): Blocks cytosolic translation; mitochondrial-encoded subunits could still be synthesized and, with preexisting nuclear-encoded subunits, some assembly might still occur. Not guaranteed to completely prevent assembly.\n- C (Both inhibitors): Blocks both mitochondrial and cytosolic translation, ensuring that neither class of required subunits can be newly synthesized; this is the definitive way to completely prevent de novo assembly of any new, fully functional complexes.\n- D (Anaerobic growth): May reduce expression or activity but does not directly inhibit protein synthesis; does not guarantee prevention of assembly.\n- E (Both inhibitors plus exogenous purified Complex IV): Exogenous enzyme will not integrate into the inner mitochondrial membrane via simple supplementation and does not alter the inhibitory effect on de novo assembly; however, the supplementation is irrelevant. The essential aspect is the use of both inhibitors, which is the same decisive feature as in option C. The standard, parsimonious correct choice is the dual-inhibition strategy itself.\n\nThus, the strategy that unambiguously and directly achieves the objective is to treat with both chloramphenicol and cycloheximide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2064729"}, {"introduction": "Organelles are not static structures; they are dynamic entities that constantly fuse and divide, a process critical for their maintenance and function.

The central hypothesis is that mitochondrial fusion allows for the functional complementation and subsequent repair of damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by pooling resources from different mitochondria within the same cell.\n\nTo test this, an experiment is designed using two haploid yeast strains of opposite mating types ('a' and 'alpha'):\n1.  A wild-type (WT) strain, which has a fully functional mitochondrial fusion-fission machinery.\n2.  A mutant strain, `fzo1Δ`, which lacks the Fzo1 protein, a key GTPase required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion, rendering it incapable of mitochondrial fusion.\n\nFor each strain (WT and `fzo1Δ`), two distinct populations are prepared:\n-   **Population A:** Treated with a hypothetical mutagen that induces a high frequency of non-functional mutations specifically in the `COX2` gene of the mtDNA.\n-   **Population B:** Treated with a different mutagen that induces a high frequency of non-functional mutations specifically in the `ATP6` gene of the mtDNA.\n\nBoth `COX2` and `ATP6` are essential for cellular respiration. A cell can only grow on a non-fermentable carbon source like glycerol if it possesses at least one functional copy of both genes within its mitochondrial network.\n\nTwo separate mating experiments are performed:\n1.  **WT Cross:** Haploid WT cells from Population A (mating type 'a') are mixed with haploid WT cells from Population B (mating type 'alpha').\n2.  **`fzo1Δ` Cross:** Haploid `fzo1Δ` cells from Population A (mating type 'a') are mixed with haploid `fzo1Δ` cells from Population B (mating type 'alpha').\n\nAfter mating, diploid cells are formed, which now contain mitochondria from both parent cells in a common cytoplasm. These diploid cells are then plated on a selective medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. Only diploid cells that have successfully restored respiratory function (i.e., have functional `COX2` and `ATP6` products) can form colonies.\n\nThe following data were collected:\n-   For the **WT Cross**, plating a total of $N_{\\text{total, WT}} = 5.20 \\times 10^5$ diploid cells resulted in $N_{\\text{repaired, WT}} = 8463$ respiratory-competent colonies.\n-   For the **`fzo1Δ` Cross**, plating a total of $N_{\\text{total, mut}} = 4.95 \\times 10^5$ diploid cells resulted in $N_{\\text{repaired, mut}} = 152$ respiratory-competent colonies.\n\nThe frequency of respiratory recovery for a given cross is defined as the number of respiratory-competent colonies divided by the total number of diploid cells plated. Let $f_{\\text{WT}}$ be this frequency for the WT cross and $f_{\\text{mut}}$ for the `fzo1Δ` cross.\n\nTo quantify the contribution of mitochondrial fusion to the repair process, calculate the **Fusion-Dependent Repair Index (FDRI)**, defined as:\n$$ \\text{FDRI} = \\frac{f_{\\text{WT}} - f_{\\text{mut}}}{f_{\\text{WT}}} $$\nThis index represents the fraction of the observed recovery in wild-type cells that is attributable to the Fzo1-mediated fusion process.\n\nCalculate the value of the FDRI.
