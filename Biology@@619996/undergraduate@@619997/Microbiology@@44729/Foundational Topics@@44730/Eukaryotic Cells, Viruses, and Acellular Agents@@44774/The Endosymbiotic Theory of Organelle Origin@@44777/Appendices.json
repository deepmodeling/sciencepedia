This drug is known to be a highly specific inhibitor of the peptidyl transferase center of 70S ribosomes, effectively halting protein synthesis by these ribosomes. The drug can freely pass through the plasma membrane and the double membranes of organelles, but it cannot cross the nuclear envelope. Consider an *in vitro* experiment where two separate cultures of healthy, metabolically active cells are treated with a sufficient concentration of Ribostatin-70: one culture contains typical mammalian somatic cells (animal cells) and the other contains photosynthetic leaf mesophyll cells (plant cells).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary, differential effects of Ribostatin-70 on these two cell types?\n\nA. Neither cell type will be affected, as both are eukaryotic and primarily utilize 80S ribosomes for protein synthesis.\n\nB. Protein synthesis in the cytoplasm will be halted in both cell types, but the plant cell will be more resilient due to its ability to photosynthesize.\n\nC. Only the plant cell will be affected, leading to a shutdown of photosynthesis due to the inhibition of chloroplast function.\n\nD. In the animal cell, mitochondrial protein synthesis will be inhibited. In the plant cell, protein synthesis within both mitochondria and chloroplasts will be inhibited.\n\nE. The animal cell's energy production will be halted, while the plant cell will be unaffected as it can rely entirely on photosynthesis, a process localized in the cytoplasm.", "solution": "The drug Ribostatin-70 is specified to be a highly specific inhibitor of the peptidyl transferase center of 70S ribosomes. The peptidyl transferase center resides in the large rRNA of the ribosome and catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation. Therefore, inhibiting it will block protein synthesis only in ribosomes of the 70S type.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells:\n1) Cytosolic ribosomes are 80S, not 70S. Thus, cytoplasmic protein synthesis will not be directly inhibited by a 70S-specific drug.\n2) Mitochondria contain bacterial-type 70S ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondrial protein synthesis will be inhibited.\n3) In plant cells, chloroplasts also contain 70S ribosomes. Therefore, chloroplast protein synthesis will be inhibited in addition to mitochondrial protein synthesis.\n\nMembrane permeability considerations given in the problem:\n- The drug can cross the plasma membrane and the double membranes of organelles, so it will reach mitochondria and, in plant cells, chloroplasts. Hence, it can access mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes.\n- The drug cannot cross the nuclear envelope, but this does not affect the conclusion because translation does not occur in the nucleus. The nuclear restriction does not protect mitochondria or chloroplasts.\n\nConsequences by cell type:\n- Animal (mammalian somatic) cell: Only mitochondria possess 70S ribosomes. Thus, mitochondrial translation will be inhibited, impairing synthesis of mitochondrially encoded components of the oxidative phosphorylation system.\n- Plant (photosynthetic mesophyll) cell: Both mitochondria and chloroplasts possess 70S ribosomes. Thus, translation will be inhibited in both organelles, impairing mitochondrial function and chloroplast function (including photosynthetic complexes with chloroplast-encoded subunits).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. Although cytosolic ribosomes are 80S, organelles have 70S ribosomes that will be inhibited.\n- B: Incorrect. Cytoplasmic translation will not be halted by a 70S-specific inhibitor, and plant resilience via photosynthesis is undermined because chloroplast translation is inhibited.\n- C: Incorrect. The animal cell is also affected via mitochondrial 70S ribosomes; additionally, in plants the effect is not limited to photosynthesis alone since mitochondria are also affected.\n- D: Correct. Animal cells lose mitochondrial protein synthesis; plant cells lose both mitochondrial and chloroplast protein synthesis.\n- E: Incorrect. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, not in the cytoplasm, and plant cells are affected at both mitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that mitochondrial translation is inhibited in animal cells, and both mitochondrial and chloroplast translation are inhibited in plant cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1781078"}, {"introduction": "The integration of an endosymbiont triggered a massive and ongoing genomic dialogue between the organelle and its host. This practice challenges you to reconstruct the evolutionary steps involved in Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT), the process by which genes are moved from organelles to the nucleus [@problem_id:1781068]. By correctly sequencing the necessary events, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the complex co-evolution that has shaped modern eukaryotic genomes and organellar function.", "problem": "The process by which genes are transferred from an organellar genome (mitochondrion or chloroplast) to the nuclear genome of the host cell is known as Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT). In many photosynthetic eukaryotes, such as spinach, a fascinating division of labor exists: the large subunit of the crucial photosynthetic enzyme RuBisCO is encoded by a gene in the chloroplast DNA, while the small subunit is encoded by a gene in the nuclear DNA. Evolutionary studies strongly indicate that the gene for the small subunit also originated within the ancestral cyanobacterium that became the chloroplast and was subsequently transferred to the host nucleus.\n\nConsider the complete evolutionary pathway for the small subunit gene of RuBisCO. From the list of potential events below, select all options that represent necessary steps for the successful transfer of this gene from the ancestral chloroplast genome to the host cell's nuclear genome, resulting in the modern-day arrangement where a functional version of the gene resides only in the nucleus and its protein product functions within the chloroplast.\n\nA.

The nuclear-encoded protein product being directly channeled from the nucleus to the chloroplast, bypassing the cytoplasm.\n\nH. A single, massive fusion event between the entire chloroplast and the nucleus, allowing for the direct exchange of all necessary genes.", "solution": "The process of Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT) is a complex, multi-step evolutionary pathway. For a gene to move from a chloroplast to the nucleus and remain functional, several key events must occur. We will analyze each option to determine if it is a necessary part of this process.\n\n**Analysis of Necessary Events:**\n\n1.  **A. Physical transfer of a DNA fragment containing the gene from the chloroplast to the nucleus.** This is the fundamental first step. Genetic material cannot be transferred without a physical mechanism. The prevailing hypothesis is that organelles occasionally lyse (break open), releasing their DNA into the cytoplasm. These DNA fragments can then be incidentally imported into the nucleus, which has machinery for taking up macromolecules. Therefore, this event is necessary.\n\n2.  **B. Stable integration of the gene copy into a nuclear chromosome.** A free-floating piece of DNA in the nucleus is not a stable, heritable gene. For the gene to be passed down to subsequent generations of the host cell and to be reliably expressed, it must be integrated into the host's own genome. This typically occurs through non-homologous end-joining or other DNA repair mechanisms that incorporate the foreign DNA into a chromosome. Therefore, this event is necessary.\n\n3.  **C. Acquisition of eukaryotic regulatory elements, such as a promoter and polyadenylation signals, by the newly integrated nuclear gene.** The gene originated in a prokaryotic-like endosymbiont (an ancestor to modern cyanobacteria). Its original promoter is designed to be recognized by bacterial/chloroplast RNA polymerase. The host nucleus uses a different set of transcription factors and RNA polymerases (specifically, RNA Polymerase II for protein-coding genes). For the gene to be transcribed in the nucleus, it must acquire, through mutation and recombination, a eukaryotic promoter recognized by the host's machinery. Similarly, it needs sequences like a polyadenylation signal for proper mRNA processing in a eukaryote. Therefore, this event is necessary.\n\n4.  **E. Evolution of a transit peptide sequence on the protein, enabling its import into the chloroplast after translation in the cytoplasm.** Once the gene is successfully transcribed and translated using the host's machinery in the cytoplasm, a new problem arises: the protein product (the RuBisCO small subunit) is needed inside the chloroplast. The protein must be given a new \"address label\" in the form of an N-terminal amino acid sequence called a transit peptide. This peptide is recognized by protein import machinery on the chloroplast envelope, which then transports the protein across the membranes and into the stroma, where it can assemble with the large subunit. Therefore, this event is necessary.\n\n5.  **D. Deletion or functional inactivation of the original gene within the chloroplast genome.** As long as the original, functional gene exists in the chloroplast, the newly transferred nuclear copy is redundant. However, once the nuclear copy is functional and its product is successfully targeted back to the chloroplast, the selective pressure to maintain the original chloroplast gene is lost. This original gene is now free to accumulate mutations without consequence, eventually becoming a non-functional pseudogene or being deleted from the chloroplast genome entirely. This final step makes the nuclear copy essential and completes the transfer. Therefore, this event is necessary.\n\n**Analysis of Incorrect Events:**\n\n6.  **F. Transfer of the gene's original prokaryotic promoter along with the gene to drive its expression from the new nuclear location.** This is incorrect. As explained in point 3, prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters are recognized by different transcription machinery. A prokaryotic promoter would be non-functional in the eukaryotic nucleus. The gene must acquire a new, eukaryotic promoter.\n\n7.  **G. The nuclear-encoded protein product being directly channeled from the nucleus to the chloroplast, bypassing the cytoplasm.** This is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of eukaryotic cell biology. Protein synthesis (translation) occurs on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There is no known direct pathway for proteins to travel from the nucleoplasm to the chloroplast stroma. The standard pathway is synthesis in the cytoplasm followed by post-translational import into the organelle.\n\n8.  **H. A single, massive fusion event between the entire chloroplast and the nucleus, allowing for the direct exchange of all necessary genes.** This is not the accepted model for EGT. The evidence points to a continuous, stochastic process where DNA is released from lysed organelles over long evolutionary timescales, with rare successful integration and activation events being selected for. A massive fusion event is not supported by cellular or genomic evidence.\n\nIn summary, the necessary steps for a complete and successful transfer are the physical transfer of DNA, its integration into a chromosome, its activation via acquisition of new regulatory elements, the targeting of its protein product back to the organelle, and the eventual loss of the original organellar copy.\n\nThe correct options are A, B, C, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCDE}$$", "id": "1781068"}, {"introduction": "Given the extensive transfer of genes to the nucleus, the persistence of tiny organellar genomes is a major evolutionary puzzle.

To test this hypothesis, a synthetic biology experiment was conducted using the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.\n\nTwo strains were engineered:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):** A standard strain with a fully functional mitochondrial genome, including the gene `COX2` which codes for a crucial subunit of the Cytochrome c oxidase complex (Complex IV).\n2.  **Allo-relegated (AR):** A modified strain in which the `COX2` gene has been moved from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus. The nuclear `COX2` gene is engineered to produce a protein product that is successfully imported back into the mitochondrion and assembled into a functional Complex IV.\n\nTo quantify the fitness consequences of this genetic relocation, a competition experiment was performed. A mixed culture was started with an equal number of WT and AR cells (i.e., an initial ratio of AR cells to WT cells of 1:1). This co-culture was then propagated for 50 generations under two different environmental conditions:\n\n*   **Condition A (Stable):** The culture was grown in a chemostat with constant, high aeration (normoxia). At the end of 50 generations, the ratio of AR cells to WT cells was measured to be 0.490.\n*   **Condition B (Dynamic):** The culture was grown in a chemostat where the environment cycled between 1 hour of hypoxia (low oxygen) and 1 hour of normoxia, creating dynamic redox stress. At the end of 50 generations, the ratio of AR cells to WT cells was measured to be 0.115.\n\nThe fitness cost, also known as the selection coefficient ($s$), of the AR strain relative to the WT strain is defined as $s = 1 - w_{AR/WT}$, where $w_{AR/WT}$ is the relative fitness of the AR strain. The relative fitness can be determined from the change in population ratios over a known number of generations.\n\nCalculate the *additional* fractional fitness cost incurred by the AR strain that is specifically attributable to the dynamic environmental conditions, as compared to the stable conditions.
