This problem [@problem_id:2088119] explores the crucial, hands-on trade-off between resolution and contrast that occurs when adjusting the condenser's aperture diaphragm. Understanding this relationship is key to optimizing the microscope for viewing different types of specimens, from highly stained bacteria to unstained living cells.", "problem": "An undergraduate student in a microbiology lab is using a standard bright-field light microscope to examine a heat-fixed and stained slide of *Bacillus subtilis*. The student has correctly focused on the specimen using the 100x oil immersion objective. Seeking to enhance the visual clarity of the bacterial cells, the student fully closes the condenser's aperture diaphragm. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequences of this action on the perceived image?\n\nA. The resolution increases, and the contrast increases.\n\nB. The resolution increases, and the contrast decreases.\n\nC. The resolution decreases, and the contrast increases.\n\nD. The resolution decreases, and the contrast decreases.\n\nE. Both resolution and contrast remain unchanged, but the depth of field decreases.", "solution": "The condenser aperture diaphragm controls the illumination cone angle at the specimen and thereby the illumination numerical aperture. Denote the refractive index of the medium as $n$, the half-angle of the objective’s collection cone as $\\alpha$, and the half-angle of the condenser’s illumination cone as $\\beta$. Then\n$$\nNA_{\\mathrm{obj}} = n \\sin \\alpha, \\qquad NA_{\\mathrm{cond}} = n \\sin \\beta.\n$$\nClosing the condenser aperture reduces $\\beta$, so $NA_{\\mathrm{cond}}$ decreases.\n\nResolution improves with increasing effective numerical aperture and worsens when it decreases. For incoherent (well-filled) illumination at optimal settings, the Rayleigh criterion gives a lateral resolution\n$$\nd = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{NA_{\\mathrm{obj}}},\n$$\nprovided the illumination adequately fills the objective aperture. If the condenser aperture is closed too far, illumination becomes underfilled and more coherent; in this regime Abbe’s imaging condition indicates that the highest resolvable spatial frequency scales with $(NA_{\\mathrm{obj}} + NA_{\\mathrm{cond}})/\\lambda$, giving\n$$\nd \\propto \\frac{\\lambda}{NA_{\\mathrm{obj}} + NA_{\\mathrm{cond}}}.\n$$\nIn both descriptions, decreasing $NA_{\\mathrm{cond}}$ from an optimal setting increases $d$ (worsens resolution), either by failing to fill the objective aperture (limiting the effective numerical aperture) or by reducing $NA_{\\mathrm{obj}} + NA_{\\mathrm{cond}}$ in the coherent limit.\n\nContrast in bright-field imaging is influenced by the condenser aperture because it acts as an angular and spatial frequency filter. Closing the diaphragm reduces the range of illumination angles and high spatial frequencies reaching the image, suppressing stray high-angle light and glare. This low-pass filtering increases image contrast of the stained specimen, though at the cost of brightness and resolution. It also increases depth of field, but the options here only ask about resolution and contrast.\n\nTherefore, fully closing the condenser aperture primarily decreases resolution and increases contrast.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2088119"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply observing specimens, a key function of microscopy is to measure them accurately. This exercise [@problem_id:2088109] simulates the essential laboratory procedure of calibrating an ocular micrometer to determine the actual size of a microscopic organism. This practice solidifies your understanding of magnification and provides a tangible skill for quantitative analysis in microbiology.", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with determining the average size of a specific strain of yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, grown in a lab culture. The student uses a standard compound light microscope equipped with a 10x eyepiece that contains an ocular micrometer. The ocular micrometer is a small ruler inside the eyepiece with markings from 0 to 100 in arbitrary \"ocular units\". The microscope has several objective lenses, including a 40x \"high-dry\" objective and a 100x \"oil immersion\" objective.\n\nTo calibrate the ocular micrometer, the student places a stage micrometer on the microscope stage. The stage micrometer is a slide with a precisely known scale etched on it, where the smallest divisions are 10.0 micrometers (µm) apart.\n\nFirst, the student performs the calibration using the 40x objective. By looking through the eyepiece, they align the ocular micrometer scale with the stage micrometer scale and observe that 35.0 divisions on the ocular micrometer correspond exactly to 10.0 divisions on the stage micrometer.\n\nNext, to obtain a more detailed view for measurement, the student removes the stage micrometer, prepares a wet mount of the yeast culture, and switches to the 100x oil immersion objective. After focusing, the student measures the diameter of several individual yeast cells. The average diameter for a representative sample of cells is found to be 4.2 ocular units.\n\nBased on these procedures and measurements, calculate the average diameter of these yeast cells.
