All reduced coenzymes generated are re-oxidized by the electron transport chain to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nThe key metabolic yields for the pathways involved are as follows:\n\n1.  **Entner-Doudoroff (ED) Pathway**: The catabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate via this pathway has a net yield of 1 molecule of ATP, 1 molecule of the reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH), and 1 molecule of the reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH).\n2.  **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex**: The conversion of one molecule of pyruvate to one molecule of acetyl-CoA yields 1 molecule of NADH.\n3.  **Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle**: The complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA yields 1 molecule of ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation, possibly as a Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) equivalent), 3 molecules of NADH, and 1 molecule of the reduced Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FADH$_2$).\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that the single molecule of NADPH produced during the ED pathway is functionally equivalent to a molecule of NADH and enters the electron transport chain with the same energy yield.
