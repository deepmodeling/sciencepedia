Downstream intermediates such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate would decrease, not accumulate. Although prolonged accumulation of F6P can secondarily lead to increases in G6P (via the reversible isomerase) and potentially affect glucose levels via feedback on transport and phosphorylation, the first significant rise occurs in F6P, the immediate precursor at the inhibited step.\n\nTherefore, the first metabolic intermediate to significantly accumulate is fructose-6-phosphate.\n\nThus the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "The primary goal of catabolism is to generate energy in the form of ATP, and oxidative phosphorylation is the most efficient process for this in aerobic organisms.
