{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The development of an organism requires precise spatial control. In *Drosophila*, the terminal signaling system is activated only at the poles of the embryo. This first practice problem investigates the a critical mechanism for this spatial restriction: the localized production of the signaling molecule (ligand). By analyzing the effect of a mutation in the *torso-like* gene, you'll explore how maternal cells surrounding the egg dictate the initial pattern of the embryo, a key example of maternal effect and cell-cell communication in development [@problem_id:1728002].", "id": "1728002", "problem": "In *Drosophila melanogaster*, the development of the non-segmented structures at the extreme anterior (the acron) and posterior (the telson) ends of the embryo is controlled by the terminal group of maternal effect genes. The central component of this system is the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the *torso* gene. The *torso* messenger RNA (mRNA) is deposited by the mother into the oocyte and is translated to produce Torso protein, which becomes uniformly distributed in the egg's cell membrane. The activation of this receptor, however, is spatially restricted to the poles of the embryo. This localized activation depends on a ligand produced by the surrounding somatic follicle cells, but only the follicle cells positioned at the anterior and posterior poles of the oocyte can produce the active ligand. The gene *torso-like* (*tsl*) is expressed in these polar follicle cells and is essential for the production or processing of the Torso ligand. Note that *torso-like* is a maternal effect gene, meaning the phenotype of the embryo is determined by the genotype of the mother.\n\nAn experiment is conducted with a strain of *Drosophila* carrying a recessive, loss-of-function mutation in the *torso-like* gene. A female fly that is homozygous for this mutation is mated with a wild-type male. Considering the mechanism described, what will be the phenotype of the resulting larval cuticle from an embryo produced by this mother?\n\nA. The larva will lack the acron and telson, but the segmented thoracic and abdominal regions will be normal.\nB. The larva will develop two telsons, one at each end, and will lack an acron and thoracic segments.\nC. The larva will be phenotypically wild-type, showing no defects.\nD. The larva will lack the centrally located thoracic and abdominal segments, but the acron and telson will be larger than normal.\nE. The larva will lack a telson but possess a normal acron and segmented body.\n\n", "solution": "The key principles are maternal effect inheritance and the terminal patterning mechanism. Maternal effect genes determine embryonic phenotype based on the mother’s genotype, regardless of the embryo’s own zygotic genotype. In the Drosophila terminal system, Torso receptor protein is provided uniformly in the embryonic membrane from maternally supplied torso mRNA, but its activation is spatially restricted to the anterior and posterior poles because only the polar follicle cells process and provide the active ligand. The gene torso-like (tsl) is required in these polar follicle cells for production or processing of the Torso ligand; without functional tsl in the mother’s follicle cells, no active ligand is generated at either pole, and thus Torso is not activated anywhere.\n\nGiven a mother homozygous for a recessive loss-of-function mutation in tsl, all embryos she produces will lack Torso pathway activation at both ends. Because Torso signaling specifies terminal structures (acron anteriorly and telson posteriorly) and does not pattern the central segmented trunk (which is patterned by other maternal and zygotic segmentation genes), the consequence is loss of both terminal structures while the thoracic and abdominal segments form normally.\n\nTherefore, the larval cuticle will lack the acron and telson, with otherwise normal segmented thoracic and abdominal regions, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "Once a signal is received at the cell surface, it must be transmitted through a series of intracellular messengers to effect a change in gene expression. This exercise uses the powerful genetic technique of epistasis analysis to decipher the order of events within the terminal signaling cascade. By predicting the outcome of combining a gain-of-function mutation in the *torso* receptor with a loss-of-function mutation in the downstream kinase *D-raf*, you can logically deduce the linear hierarchy of the pathway, a fundamental skill for any geneticist or cell biologist [@problem_id:1728037].", "id": "1728037", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis is a multi-step process. A specific genetic system, known as the terminal system, is responsible for specifying the structures at the very ends of the embryo: the acron at the anterior pole and the telson at the posterior pole. The proper function of this system relies on a signal transduction pathway.\n\nConsider two key genes in this pathway:\n1.  The gene *torso* encodes a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) that is uniformly distributed on the surface of the embryo's plasma membrane. In a wild-type embryo, it is activated only at the poles by a localized ligand, initiating the signaling cascade that specifies terminal structures.\n2.  The gene *D-raf* encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which functions as a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAPKKK). This kinase is an essential downstream component in the intracellular signaling cascade initiated by the activated *torso* receptor.\n\nExperiments have characterized the phenotypes of individual mutations in these genes:\n-   Embryos from mothers homozygous for a gain-of-function allele, *torso<sup>GOF</sup>*, possess a Torso receptor that is constitutively active, meaning it signals constantly, even in the absence of a ligand. The resulting embryonic phenotype is a \"terminalization\" of the body plan, where the central segmented region fails to form and is replaced by expanded acron and telson-like structures.\n-   Embryos from mothers homozygous for a null, loss-of-function allele, *D-raf<sup>LOF</sup>*, lack any functional D-raf protein. The resulting embryonic phenotype is a failure to form any terminal structures, leading to a larva that lacks both an acron and a telson.\n\nAn investigator creates a double-mutant fly strain. What is the expected phenotype of an embryo derived from a mother who is homozygous for both the *torso<sup>GOF</sup>* allele and the *D-raf<sup>LOF</sup>* allele?\n\nA. The embryo will lack both the acron and the telson, displaying the same phenotype as a *D-raf<sup>LOF</sup>* single mutant.\nB. The embryo will exhibit an expansion of terminal structures, displaying the same phenotype as a *torso<sup>GOF</sup>* single mutant.\nC. The embryo will develop a normal wild-type body plan, as the two mutations cancel each other out.\nD. The embryo will display a completely novel and more severe phenotype than either single mutant, such as a complete arrest of development prior to gastrulation.\nE. The embryo will develop two telsons, one at the anterior and one at the posterior end, but will lack an acron.\n\n", "solution": "We interpret the terminal system as a linear signal transduction pathway in which the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase activates an intracellular cascade that requires D-raf (a MAPKKK) to transmit the signal to downstream effectors that specify terminal fates. The key logical principle is that activation at the receptor level must be propagated through essential downstream components; if a required downstream kinase is absent, the signal cannot elicit terminal fate specification.\n\nDefine a qualitative pathway output variable $O$ representing terminal pathway activity that induces terminal structures. Let $R$ denote receptor activity state and $D$ denote the presence of functional D-raf. Because the receptor’s signal must pass through D-raf, the effective output satisfies the logical conjunction\n$$\nO = R \\land D,\n$$\nmeaning that $O=1$ (terminal signaling on) only if both $R=1$ (receptor signaling active) and $D=1$ (functional D-raf present).\n\nFor a $torso^{GOF}$ mother, $R=1$ everywhere due to constitutive receptor activity. For a $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$ mother, $D=0$ everywhere due to absence of functional kinase. In the double mutant mother $torso^{GOF};D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$, we have $R=1$ and $D=0$, hence\n$$\nO = 1 \\land 0 = 0.\n$$\nThus, despite constitutive Torso activation, the absence of D-raf abolishes pathway output, preventing specification of terminal structures. In epistasis terms, the downstream loss-of-function in $D\\text{-}raf$ is epistatic to the upstream gain-of-function in $torso$, so the double-mutant phenotype matches the $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$ phenotype: embryos lack both acron and telson.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotype corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "Signaling pathways often create gradients of activity, which are then interpreted by cells to create distinct patterns of gene expression. This problem shifts our focus from qualitative genetics to the quantitative principles of pattern formation. Using a simple mathematical model of the activated MAPK gradient, you will determine how changing the steepness of this gradient affects the size of the expression domains for the target genes *tailless* and *huckebein*.
