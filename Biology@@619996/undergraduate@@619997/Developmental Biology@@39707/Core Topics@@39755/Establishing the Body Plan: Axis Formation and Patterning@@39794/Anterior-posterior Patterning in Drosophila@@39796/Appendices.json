This first practice uses a simplified mathematical model to explore how the initial morphogen gradient of Bicoid protein provides quantitative positional information. By modeling the effect of reducing the initial amount of *bicoid* a mother provides to her egg, you will predict how this alters the positioning of downstream gene expression domains, offering a concrete look at the link between gene dosage and spatial patterning. [@problem_id:1671095]", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis is established by a gradient of the Bicoid (Bcd) protein, a maternally supplied morphogen. The *bicoid* messenger RNA (mRNA) is localized at the anterior tip of the egg. Following fertilization, this mRNA is translated, and the Bcd protein diffuses through the syncytial cytoplasm, forming a concentration gradient. This gradient can be modeled by the equation:\n\n$$C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$$\n\nHere, $C(x)$ is the concentration of Bcd protein at a fractional distance $x$ from the anterior pole (where $x=0$ corresponds to the anterior tip and $x=L$ to the posterior tip of the embryo). $C_0$ is the concentration at the anterior pole, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length constant of the exponential decay.\n\nThe position of expression domains for downstream target genes, such as the gap genes, is determined by the local concentration of Bcd. For a given target gene, its expression boundary is established at a position where the Bcd concentration drops to a specific regulatory threshold, $C_{th}$.\n\nConsider a scenario comparing a wild-type embryo to a mutant embryo from a mother that is heterozygous for a null mutation in the *bicoid* gene ($\\textit{bcd}^{-}/\\textit{bcd}^{+}$). This maternal genotype results in the deposition of only half the normal amount of *bicoid* mRNA into the oocyte. Consequently, the peak concentration of Bcd protein at the anterior pole in the mutant embryo, $C_{0,mut}$, is exactly half that of the wild-type embryo, $C_{0,wt}$. Assume that the decay constant $\\lambda$ and the threshold concentration $C_{th}$ for a particular gene are the same in both wild-type and mutant embryos.\n\nHow does the position of the gene expression boundary, defined by the threshold $C_{th}$, shift in the mutant embryo relative to the wild-type embryo?\n\nA. The boundary will shift towards the anterior pole by an amount $\\lambda \\ln(2)$.\n\nB. The boundary will shift towards the posterior pole by an amount $\\lambda \\ln(2)$.\n\nC. The boundary will shift towards the anterior pole by an amount $2\\lambda$.\n\nD. The boundary will shift towards the posterior pole by an amount $\\lambda/2$.\n\nE. The position of the boundary will not change; instead, the level of gene expression within the domain will be halved.", "solution": "The problem asks for the shift in the position of a gene expression boundary in a *Drosophila* embryo with a reduced dose of the *bicoid* gene. The position of this boundary is determined by a specific concentration threshold of the Bicoid (Bcd) protein.\n\nFirst, let's state the governing equation for the Bcd concentration gradient:\n$$C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the concentration at position $x$, $C_0$ is the peak concentration at the anterior pole ($x=0$), and $\\lambda$ is the decay length constant.\n\nA specific gene expression boundary is formed at the position $x$ where the Bcd concentration equals a fixed threshold value, $C_{th}$. This threshold is an intrinsic property of the gene's regulatory elements and does not change between the wild-type and mutant embryos.\n\nFor the wild-type (wt) embryo, the anterior concentration is $C_{0,wt}$. Let the boundary position be $x_{wt}$. The condition for the boundary is:\n$$C_{th} = C_{0,wt} \\exp(-x_{wt}/\\lambda)$$\n\nFor the mutant (mut) embryo, the anterior concentration is half that of the wild-type, so $C_{0,mut} = C_{0,wt}/2$. Let the new boundary position be $x_{mut}$. The condition for the boundary remains at the same threshold $C_{th}$:\n$$C_{th} = C_{0,mut} \\exp(-x_{mut}/\\lambda) = \\frac{C_{0,wt}}{2} \\exp(-x_{mut}/\\lambda)$$\n\nSince $C_{th}$ is the same for both equations, we can set the right-hand sides equal to each other:\n$$C_{0,wt} \\exp(-x_{wt}/\\lambda) = \\frac{C_{0,wt}}{2} \\exp(-x_{mut}/\\lambda)$$\n\nWe can cancel the $C_{0,wt}$ term from both sides, as it is non-zero:\n$$\\exp(-x_{wt}/\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-x_{mut}/\\lambda)$$\n\nTo solve for the relationship between $x_{wt}$ and $x_{mut}$, we can rearrange the equation by dividing both sides by $\\exp(-x_{mut}/\\lambda)$:\n$$\\frac{\\exp(-x_{wt}/\\lambda)}{\\exp(-x_{mut}/\\lambda)} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nUsing the exponent rule $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$, we get:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{wt}}{\\lambda} - \\left(-\\frac{x_{mut}}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{x_{mut} - x_{wt}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nTo solve for the positions, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{x_{mut} - x_{wt}}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{x_{mut} - x_{wt}}{\\lambda} = -\\ln(2)$$\n\nThe shift in position is defined as $\\Delta x = x_{mut} - x_{wt}$. Solving for this shift:\n$$\\Delta x = -\\lambda \\ln(2)$$\n\nThe result $\\Delta x = -\\lambda \\ln(2)$ tells us two things:\n1.  The sign of the shift is negative. Since $x$ measures the distance from the anterior pole, a negative $\\Delta x$ means that $x_{mut} < x_{wt}$, so the boundary has moved closer to the anterior pole.\n2.  The magnitude of the shift is $|\\Delta x| = |-\\lambda \\ln(2)| = \\lambda \\ln(2)$, since both $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(2)$ are positive constants.\n\nTherefore, the boundary shifts towards the anterior pole by an amount equal to $\\lambda \\ln(2)$.

These genes often act as repressors, carving the embryo into distinct domains by inhibiting each other's expression. This exercise focuses on a classic repressive interaction to illustrate how sharp boundaries are formed, asking you to predict the outcome of removing one key repressor from the system.

Stated principle: removal of a repressor that specifies a boundary leads to derepression (expanded expression) into the domain normally occupied by the repressor.\n\n2) In a kni loss-of-function mutant, the KNIRPS protein is absent, so its transcriptional repression on Kr is removed specifically in the posterior regions where kni is normally expressed.\n\n3) Other inputs that set the anterior boundary of Kr (e.g., repression by anterior factors such as giant or the dependence on graded activators) are unaffected by the loss of kni; hence the anterior boundary of the Kr stripe should remain largely unchanged.\n\n4) Therefore, the predicted net effect is a posterior expansion (derepression) of the Kr stripe into the region normally repressed by kni, rather than disappearance, anterior shift, splitting, or no change.\n\nConclusion: The Kr stripe expands posteriorly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1671030"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate control of gene expression lies in the DNA sequences known as enhancers, which act as computational modules that integrate information from various activators and repressors. This final practice moves from analysis to synthesis, challenging you to design a synthetic enhancer from first principles. By combining binding sites for different key transcription factors, your goal is to recreate a specific expression pattern, demonstrating a deep understanding of the combinatorial logic that underpins embryonic development. [@problem_id:1671097]", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the principles of transcriptional regulation during anterior-posterior axis formation in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. They aim to build a synthetic enhancer to drive the expression of a reporter gene in a very specific pattern: a single, sharply-defined stripe located in the anterior of the embryo, corresponding to the region that will form parasegment 4.\n\nFor this experiment, the researcher is restricted to using only cis-regulatory binding sites for three transcription factors: Bicoid (Bcd), Hunchback (Hb), and Krüppel (Kr). The spatial distribution and function of these factors in the early embryo can be summarized by the following simplified rules:\n\n1.  **Bicoid (Bcd):** An activator. Its protein forms a concentration gradient, with the highest concentration at the anterior pole, decreasing towards the posterior. Its presence is required to activate the synthetic enhancer.\n2.  **Hunchback (Hb):** A dual-function transcription factor. It is expressed in a broad domain covering the anterior half of the embryo. At moderate concentrations, it functions as an activator. However, at the very high concentrations found in the anterior-most tip of the embryo, it functions as a repressor.\n3.  **Krüppel (Kr):** A repressor. Its protein is expressed in a band in the central region of the embryo, posterior to the primary Hb domain. The anterior boundary of the Kr domain abuts the posterior boundary of the parasegment 4 primordium.\n4.  **Regulatory Logic:** For the reporter gene to be expressed, at least one type of activator site on the enhancer must be bound. If a repressor binds to its corresponding site on the enhancer, it will completely override any activators and shut down expression.\n\nGiven these constraints and rules, which of the following enhancer designs is most likely to produce a single, sharp stripe of reporter gene expression corresponding to parasegment 4?\n\nA. A set of binding sites that are strongly activated by Bcd and a set of binding sites that are strongly activated by Hb.\n\nB.

A set of binding sites that are activated by Bcd, a set of binding sites that are repressed by high concentrations of Hb, and a set of binding sites that are repressed by Kr.\n\nD. A set of binding sites that are repressed by Bcd and a set of binding sites that are activated by Kr.\n\nE. A set of binding sites that are weakly activated by Bcd and a set of binding sites that are weakly activated by Hb.", "solution": "We interpret the spatial logic and regulatory rules as follows:\n- Expression requires activator binding; any bound repressor fully silences the enhancer.\n- Bcd is an anterior activator with a graded profile, highest at the anterior.\n- Hb is present broadly in the anterior; it activates at moderate levels but behaves as a repressor at the extreme anterior where its concentration is very high.\n- Kr is a repressor expressed in a central band; its anterior edge coincides with the posterior edge of the parasegment 4 region.\n\nTo achieve a single, sharp stripe in the anterior corresponding to parasegment 4, the enhancer must:\n- Include activation by an anterior activator to confine expression to the anterior (Bcd sites fulfill this).\n- Exclude expression at the extreme anterior tip where Hb is too high (therefore, include repression by high Hb).\n- Exclude expression in the central region where Kr is present (therefore, include Kr repression).\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A: Only activations by Bcd and Hb. Without explicit repression inputs, expression would be broadly anterior. Although Hb is dual-function in vivo, this option does not include Kr repression to prevent central expression; hence it will not yield a single sharp stripe at parasegment 4.\n- B: Only repression by Kr and high Hb, but no activator sites. By the stated regulatory logic, no expression occurs anywhere. Invalid.\n- C: Activation by Bcd, repression by high Hb, and repression by Kr. This yields expression where Bcd is present, Hb is not excessively high (avoiding the anterior-most tip), and Kr is absent (avoiding the central band). This combination defines a single, sharp stripe in the correct anterior position corresponding to parasegment 4.\n- D: Repressed by Bcd and activated by Kr contradicts the stated roles (Bcd is an activator, Kr a repressor). Invalid patterning for the target stripe.\n- E: Weak activations by Bcd and Hb without repressors again produces a broad anterior domain, lacking the sharp anterior and posterior boundaries required for a single stripe.\n\nTherefore, the design that matches all necessary constraints is the one that combines Bcd activation with repression by high Hb and repression by Kr.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1671097"}]}
