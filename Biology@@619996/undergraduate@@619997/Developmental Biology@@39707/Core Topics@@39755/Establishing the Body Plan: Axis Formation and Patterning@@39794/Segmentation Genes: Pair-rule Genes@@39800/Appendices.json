This practice provides a direct demonstration of how sharp expression boundaries are carved out of broader domains during development.", "problem": "In the early *Drosophila melanogaster* embryo, the anteroposterior axis is patterned by a hierarchy of segmentation genes. The gap genes are among the first to be expressed, and they regulate the expression of the pair-rule genes, which are expressed in a pattern of seven stripes.\n\nConsider the regulation of the second stripe of the pair-rule gene *even-skipped* (*eve*). A specific enhancer element drives the expression of *eve* stripe 2. The activity of this enhancer is controlled by transcription factors encoded by maternal effect and gap genes. For this problem, we will use a simplified model of this regulation along the anteroposterior axis, measured in percent egg length (% EL), where 0% is the anterior pole and 100% is the posterior pole.\n\nThe rules for the expression of *eve* stripe 2 are as follows:\n1.  A set of ubiquitous maternal and gap gene products acts as activators. Their combined effect is to create an activating potential in the anterior half of the embryo, specifically in the region from 0% to 60% EL.\n2.  The gap gene *giant* (*gt*) encodes a repressor protein. It is expressed in two domains: an anterior domain from 0% to 30% EL and a posterior domain from 70% to 85% EL.\n3.  The gap gene *Krüppel* (*Kr*) encodes another repressor protein. In a wild-type embryo, it is expressed in a central domain from 40% to 60% EL.\n4.  The *eve* stripe 2 enhancer is active, and thus the stripe is expressed, **only** in regions where the activating potential is present **and** both the Giant and Krüppel repressors are absent.\n\nBased on this model, predict the expression pattern of *eve* stripe 2 in a homozygous mutant embryo that completely lacks a functional *Krüppel* gene product (*Kr*-null mutant).\n\nA. The *eve* stripe 2 will not be expressed at all.\n\nB. The *eve* stripe 2 will be expressed in a narrow band from 30% to 40% EL.\n\nC. The *eve* stripe 2 will be expressed in a broad band from 30% to 60% EL.\n\nD. The *eve* stripe 2 will be expressed in a broad band from 0% to 60% EL.\n\nE. The *eve* stripe 2 will be expressed in two separate stripes, one from 30% to 40% EL and another from 60% to 70% EL.", "solution": "Let $x$ denote position along the anteroposterior axis scaled so that $x=0$ is the anterior pole and $x=1$ is the posterior pole.\n\nBy the problem’s rules:\n- Activating potential is present for $x \\in [0,0.6]$. Denote this set by $A=[0,0.6]$.\n- Giant is present for $x \\in [0,0.3] \\cup [0.7,0.85]$. Denote this set by $G=[0,0.3] \\cup [0.7,0.85]$.\n- In the wild type, Kr is present for $x \\in [0.4,0.6]$, but in the *Kr*-null mutant, Kr is absent everywhere. Denote the Kr domain in the mutant by $K=\\varnothing$.\n\nThe regulatory rule states: the enhancer is active only where activation is present and both repressors are absent. In set notation, the expression domain $E$ is\n$$\nE \\;=\\; A \\cap G^{c} \\cap K^{c} \\;=\\; A \\setminus (G \\cup K).\n$$\nIn the *Kr*-null mutant, $K=\\varnothing$, hence $G \\cup K = G$, so\n$$\nE \\;=\\; A \\setminus G \\;=\\; [0,0.6] \\setminus \\big([0,0.3] \\cup [0.7,0.85]\\big).\n$$\nSince $[0.7,0.85] \\cap [0,0.6]=\\varnothing$, this simplifies to\n$$\nE \\;=\\; [0,0.6] \\setminus [0,0.3] \\;=\\; [0.3,0.6].\n$$\n\nInterpretation: with Kr absent, the anterior boundary is set by the anterior Giant boundary at $x=0.3$, and the posterior boundary is set by the limit of the activating region at $x=0.6$.

Within the pair-rule system itself, primary genes regulate secondary genes, often through repression, to create intricate, interlocking patterns. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1714008] explores this hierarchical relationship by asking you to predict the fate of the secondary pair-rule gene *fushi tarazu* when its primary repressor, *hairy*, is ubiquitously expressed, highlighting the power of negative regulation in generating complexity.", "problem": "In the early embryonic development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a hierarchical cascade of gene expression establishes the segmented body plan. After maternal-effect and gap genes define broad regions along the anterior-posterior axis, pair-rule genes are expressed in a pattern of seven transverse stripes. These genes are crucial for the formation of parasegments.\n\nPair-rule genes can be classified as primary or secondary. The expression of primary pair-rule genes, such as *hairy* (*h*), is controlled by the gap genes. The expression of secondary pair-rule genes, such as *fushi tarazu* (*ftz*), is regulated by the primary pair-rule genes.\n\nIn a wild-type embryo, the protein product of the *hairy* gene acts as a transcriptional repressor for the *ftz* gene. This repression is a key part of the mechanism that creates the alternating stripe patterns of these two genes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a genetically modified *Drosophila* embryo is created. In this embryo, due to an engineered construct, the *hairy* gene is expressed at a high level ubiquitously (uniformly) across the entire blastoderm, starting at the time when pair-rule genes would normally be activated. Assuming all other developmental processes and gene products are initially normal, what would be the resulting expression pattern of the *fushi tarazu* (*ftz*) gene in this embryo?\n\nA. *ftz* will be expressed uniformly throughout the embryo.\n\nB. *ftz* will be expressed in its normal pattern of seven stripes.\n\nC. *ftz* will be expressed in fourteen stripes, double the normal number.\n\nD. *ftz* expression will be completely absent throughout the embryo.\n\nE. *ftz* will be expressed only in the regions where *hairy* is normally expressed.", "solution": "The developmental hierarchy in early Drosophila segmentation proceeds from maternal-effect and gap genes to primary pair-rule genes (such as hairy) and then to secondary pair-rule genes (such as fushi tarazu, ftz). In the wild type, the protein product of the hairy gene functions as a transcriptional repressor of ftz by binding to its regulatory elements, creating a pattern where ftz stripes appear in domains where hairy is absent or low, and ftz is repressed where hairy is present.\n\nGiven the hypothetical condition that hairy is expressed at a high level ubiquitously across the blastoderm at the onset of pair-rule gene activation, the repressor (Hairy protein) would be present everywhere that ftz could otherwise be expressed. Since repression by hairy is a direct regulatory input controlling ftz expression, ubiquitous high-level hairy would block transcription of ftz throughout the embryo. Other normal activators or regulatory inputs for ftz cannot override a uniformly applied strong repression. Therefore, there would be no spatial domain permissive for ftz expression.\n\nThis rules out:\n- Uniform ftz expression (A), because repression is global.\n- The normal seven stripes (B), because the alternating pattern requires regions lacking hairy, which are absent here.\n- Fourteen stripes (C), because this would require additional alternating regulatory logic, not compatible with uniform repression.\n- Expression where hairy is normally expressed (E), because even in wild type, hairy domains correlate with ftz repression, and here hairy is everywhere.\n\nTherefore, ftz expression would be completely absent throughout the embryo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1714008"}, {"introduction": "Transcription factors are often modular proteins with distinct domains for DNA binding and for regulatory activity, a principle that allows for functional flexibility and evolution. This concept can be explored through genetic engineering, as illustrated in this problem [@problem_id:1713965]. By conceptually swapping a repressor domain for an activator domain on the Even-skipped protein, you can deduce how this functional switch rewires a specific genetic circuit, offering deep insight into the molecular logic that underpins gene expression.", "problem": "In the early *Drosophila melanogaster* embryo, the process of segmentation is governed by a hierarchical cascade of gene expression. Among the key players are the pair-rule genes, which are expressed in characteristic stripe patterns. The Even-skipped (Eve) protein is a transcription factor encoded by a pair-rule gene, and it is expressed in seven transverse stripes. The *runt* gene, also a pair-rule gene, is a direct regulatory target of the Eve protein. In wild-type embryos, the Eve protein functions as a transcriptional repressor of *runt* in the regions where their expression patterns would otherwise overlap, helping to sharpen stripe boundaries.\n\nImagine a genetic engineering experiment where the endogenous *eve* gene is modified. The new gene produces a mutant protein, which we will call Eve*, that is expressed in the exact same seven-stripe pattern as the wild-type protein. However, in the Eve* protein, the domain responsible for transcriptional repression has been precisely replaced by a potent transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain of the protein remains unchanged.\n\nBased on this scenario, what is the most likely outcome for the expression pattern of the *runt* gene in these mutant embryos?\n\nA. The expression of *runt* will be completely eliminated from the entire embryo.\n\nB. The expression of *runt* will become uniform and ubiquitous throughout the embryo, losing its striped pattern.\n\nC. The *runt* gene will now be strongly expressed specifically within the seven stripes where the Eve* protein is present.\n\nD. The expression pattern of *runt* will be completely unaffected, as its regulation is robust to changes in a single input.\n\nE. The seven stripes of Eve* expression will themselves destabilize and collapse into a single broad domain.\n\nF. The *runt* gene will now be expressed in fourteen narrow stripes instead of its usual pattern.", "solution": "We begin from the stated wild-type regulatory relationship: Eve is a transcription factor that directly represses the transcription of the *runt* gene in regions where their expression domains would otherwise overlap. This repression sharpens the boundaries of *runt* stripes by preventing *runt* expression specifically in the Eve stripes.\n\nIn the engineered scenario, the endogenous *eve* coding sequence is modified such that:\n- The DNA-binding domain remains unchanged. Therefore, Eve* recognizes and binds the same cis-regulatory DNA sequences (Eve-binding sites) in the *runt* enhancers as the wild-type Eve protein.\n- The repression domain is replaced by a potent transcriptional activation domain. Therefore, once bound to its target sites, Eve* will recruit coactivators and/or the transcriptional machinery to increase transcription rather than recruit corepressors to inhibit it.\n- The spatial and temporal expression pattern of Eve* (seven stripes) is identical to that of wild-type Eve. Hence, the positional information and the set of cells in which Eve* acts are unchanged.\n\nGiven that *runt* is a direct target of Eve in the overlapping regions and that the only functional change is a switch from repression to activation while leaving DNA binding and spatial expression unchanged, the regulatory effect on *runt* at Eve-binding sites is expected to invert. Specifically:\n- In cells within Eve stripes, where wild-type Eve would bind and repress *runt*, Eve* will bind the same sites and activate *runt* expression.\n- Outside Eve stripes, there is no Eve* binding; thus Eve*-mediated activation is absent. Other regulatory inputs to *runt* (from gap and other pair-rule genes) may still shape its pattern, but the most prominent and direct change will be ectopic activation specifically in the Eve* stripes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that *runt* becomes strongly expressed within the seven Eve* stripes, corresponding to option C.\n\nThis reasoning rules out the alternatives:\n- A is unlikely because the effector domain is now activating, not repressing; elimination requires stronger global repression or enhancer failure.\n- B is unlikely because activation is restricted to Eve* stripes by the unchanged Eve* expression pattern and binding specificity.\n- D is unlikely because *runt* is a direct target of Eve; flipping the effector domain should not leave the pattern unaffected.\n- E is inconsistent with the premise that Eve* expression pattern is unchanged; the coding change does not feed back to destabilize its own striped pattern given the described setup.\n- F has no mechanistic basis from merely inverting the effect at Eve-binding sites; doubling to fourteen stripes reflects a later regulatory layer and is not predicted by this specific manipulation.\n\nHence, the predicted expression pattern change matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1713965"}]}
