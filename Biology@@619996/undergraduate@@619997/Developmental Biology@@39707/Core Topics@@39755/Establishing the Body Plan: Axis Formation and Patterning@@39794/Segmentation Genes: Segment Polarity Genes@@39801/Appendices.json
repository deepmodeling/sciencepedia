{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of genetic analysis is the ability to order genes within a biological pathway. Epistasis analysis is a powerful logical tool that allows us to do just that. By examining the phenotype of an organism that is mutant for two different genes, we can deduce which gene's function is required downstream of the other. This exercise challenges you to apply epistasis logic to the crucial Hedgehog signaling pathway to map the flow of information from the cell surface to the nucleus [@problem_id:1714258].", "id": "1714258", "problem": "In the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the establishment of the body plan along the anterior-posterior axis is a hierarchical process. Segment polarity genes are responsible for refining the pattern within each of the 14 parasegments, defining distinct anterior and posterior compartments. A key signaling pathway controlling this process is the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway.\n\nConsider the following components of the Hh pathway in the ventral embryonic epidermis:\n- **Hedgehog (Hh)**: A secreted protein produced by cells in the posterior compartment of a parasegment.\n- **Patched (Ptc)**: The transmembrane receptor for Hh, expressed in anterior compartment cells. In the absence of Hh, Ptc actively represses the activity of Smoothened.\n- **Smoothened (Smo)**: A transmembrane protein that is kept inactive by Ptc. When Hh binds to Ptc, this repression is relieved, and Smo becomes active.\n- **Fused (Fu)**: An intracellular serine/threonine kinase. Active Smo triggers a signaling cascade that requires the activity of Fu to transmit the signal downstream.\n- **Cubitus interruptus (Ci)**: A transcription factor. In the absence of Hh signaling (when the pathway is \"off\"), Ci is processed into a repressor form that prevents the transcription of target genes. When the Hh pathway is \"on\" (initiated by active Smo and transmitted via Fu), Ci is stabilized in its full-length activator form, leading to the transcription of target genes like `wingless` and `ptc` itself. Activation of this pathway leads to the formation of structures called denticles, while its inactivation results in smooth, \"naked\" cuticle.\n\nLoss-of-function mutations in these genes have distinct phenotypes:\n- A `patched` (`ptc`) mutant, lacking a functional Ptc protein, exhibits a \"lawn of denticles\" phenotype, where all cells in the segment form denticles.\n- A `fused` (`fu`) mutant, lacking a functional Fu kinase, exhibits a \"naked\" cuticle phenotype, where no cells in the segment form denticles.\n\nBased on this information, predict the cuticle phenotype of a double mutant embryo that has loss-of-function mutations in both the `fused` gene and the `patched` gene.\n\nA. A wild-type cuticle pattern with alternating bands of denticles and naked cuticle.\nB. A \"lawn of denticles,\" identical to the `patched` single mutant phenotype.\nC. A \"naked\" cuticle, identical to the `fused` single mutant phenotype.\nD. A random mosaic of \"naked\" patches and \"lawn of denticles\" patches.\nE. Lethality before cuticle formation, resulting in no observable cuticle pattern.\n\n", "solution": "We analyze pathway logic and mutant phenotypes using epistasis in a linear signaling cascade.\n\n1) Wild-type signaling logic:\n- In the absence of Hh, Ptc represses Smo. Repressed Smo fails to activate the downstream cascade, Fu activity is not engaged, and Ci is processed into a repressor form. This keeps target genes off, yielding naked cuticle.\n- In the presence of Hh, Hh binds Ptc and relieves repression of Smo. Active Smo requires Fu kinase activity to transmit the signal. With Fu active downstream, Ci is stabilized in its full-length activator form, turning on target genes such as wingless and ptc, producing denticles.\n\n2) Single-mutant phenotypes:\n- ptc loss of function: Ptc cannot repress Smo, so Smo becomes constitutively active even without Hh. Provided downstream components function, Fu transmits the signal, Ci remains an activator, and all cells express target genes, producing a lawn of denticles.\n- fu loss of function: Even if Smo is active, the signal cannot be transmitted without Fu. Ci is not maintained in its activator form and is processed to a repressor, so target genes remain off, producing naked cuticle.\n\n3) Double mutant ptc;fu prediction:\n- Removing Ptc would derepress Smo, tending to activate signaling. However, without Fu, the downstream transmission of the Smo signal fails. Consequently, Ci is not stabilized as an activator and is processed into a repressor, keeping target genes off.\n- Therefore, the fu loss-of-function is epistatic to ptc loss-of-function in this pathway, and the phenotype matches the fu single mutant: naked cuticle.\n\nThus, the double mutant exhibits a naked cuticle identical to the fused single mutant phenotype.\n\nThe correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the components of a pathway, we can begin to probe its role in patterning tissues. A classic experiment in developmental biology involves expressing a gene in an abnormal time or placeâ€”a technique called misexpression or ectopic expression. This practice explores what happens when a key signaling molecule, Hedgehog, is supplied everywhere in the embryo instead of in its usual narrow stripe. By working through the consequences, you will deepen your understanding of how short-range cell-to-cell communication translates into the large-scale patterning of cell fates, such as the formation of the larval cuticle [@problem_id:1714233].", "id": "1714233", "problem": "In the embryonic development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the process of segmentation establishes the repeating body plan. This process is governed by a hierarchy of genes. After broader regions are defined by gap and pair-rule genes, the segment polarity gene network refines and maintains the boundaries of 14 distinct units called parasegments.\n\nWithin each parasegment, a crucial cell-to-cell signaling feedback loop involving the proteins Wingless (Wg) and Hedgehog (Hh) establishes cell fates. In the wild-type embryo's epidermis, cells in the anterior compartment of each parasegment express the gene *engrailed* (*en*) and consequently the gene *hedgehog* (*hh*). Hh protein is secreted and acts as a short-range signal. It is received by the adjacent anterior row of cells, which belong to the next parasegment. This signal induces these cells to express the gene *wingless* (*wg*). The secreted Wg protein, in turn, signals back to the *en*/*hh* expressing cells, maintaining their unique identity.\n\nThis signaling interaction directly determines the final pattern of the larval cuticle. In the abdominal segments, the Wg signal promotes the development of smooth, naked cuticle. In contrast, the cells which express *en* and *hh* and are not exposed to high levels of Wg signaling differentiate to form a characteristic band of sharp, backwards-pointing bristles called a denticle belt.\n\nConsider a genetic experiment where a modified embryo is engineered to have ubiquitous, uniform expression of the *hedgehog* gene in all epidermal cells, starting from the cellular blastoderm stage. Based on the signaling logic described, what is the most likely phenotype of the resulting larval abdominal cuticle?\n\nA. The normal alternating pattern of smooth cuticle and denticle belts is formed, but the segment boundaries are lost, resulting in one continuous pattern.\nB. The larva will be covered almost entirely in denticle belts, with a near-complete loss of the smooth cuticle regions.\nC. The larva will have a cuticle that is entirely smooth and naked, with a complete absence of denticle belts.\nD. The cuticle pattern will be a random, disorganized mix of smooth cuticle patches and denticle-producing cells, lacking any segmentation.\nE. The larva will develop a wild-type cuticle pattern, as the patterning information from the earlier-acting pair-rule genes is sufficient to override the abnormal *hedgehog* expression.\n\n", "solution": "We use the established segment polarity gene network logic governing Drosophila parasegments.\n\n1) Wild-type signaling logic:\n- Posterior cells of each parasegment express engrailed (en), which activates hedgehog (hh). Hh protein is secreted and acts at short range on the immediately adjacent anterior cells of the next parasegment.\n- Reception of Hh converts the transcriptional effector Ci into its activator form and prevents repressor formation, thereby inducing wingless (wg) expression in that adjacent anterior row.\n- Secreted Wg signals back to the en/hh-expressing posterior cells to maintain en/hh expression. Thus, stable adjacent stripes of en/hh and wg are maintained.\n- Fate outcomes: high Wg signaling promotes smooth, naked cuticle; en/hh-expressing cells that are not exposed to high Wg differentiate into denticle belts.\n\n2) Perturbation: ubiquitous, uniform hh expression from the cellular blastoderm stage in all epidermal cells.\n- If hh is expressed everywhere, then every epidermal cell both secretes and receives Hh. This globally prevents Ci repression and promotes Ci activation across the epidermis.\n- As a consequence, wg is induced and maintained broadly, because the normal requirement of localized Hh from en cells is satisfied everywhere. The feedback from Wg further stabilizes this widespread signaling state.\n- Since Wg is the instructive signal for naked cuticle and suppresses the denticle fate, widespread or uniformly high Wg signaling across the epidermis eliminates the condition required for denticle belt formation (namely, en/hh cells not exposed to high Wg).\n\n3) Phenotypic prediction:\n- With Wg signaling effectively high throughout the epidermis, the larval abdominal cuticle differentiates as smooth and naked nearly everywhere, with a complete absence of denticle belts.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is an entirely smooth cuticle, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Development is a dynamic process unfolding over time, and a critical question for any developmental gene is *when* its function is required. This problem introduces a sophisticated experimental tool, the temperature-sensitive allele, which allows researchers to turn a gene's function on or off at will. Here, you will combine the biological logic of this tool with a quantitative model of protein decay. This exercise will challenge you to determine the temporal window during which the Wingless signaling pathway must be active to maintain cell fate, bridging the gap between qualitative genetic concepts and quantitative biological analysis [@problem_id:1714300].", "id": "1714300", "problem": "In *Drosophila melanogaster*, the establishment of parasegment boundaries relies on a complex gene regulatory network. The expression of the segment polarity gene *engrailed* (en) in a cell is maintained by a signal from the adjacent cell, which secretes the Wingless (Wg) protein. The intracellular protein Dishevelled (Dsh) is a critical component for transducing the Wg signal. To investigate the temporal requirement of this signaling pathway, a researcher uses a temperature-sensitive allele, *dsh<sup>ts1</sup>*. At the permissive temperature ($T_{p} = 18^\\circ\\text{C}$), the Dsh protein is functional, while at the restrictive temperature ($T_{r} = 29^\\circ\\text{C}$), it rapidly misfolds and becomes non-functional.\n\nEmbryos homozygous for *dsh<sup>ts1</sup>* are cultured at the permissive temperature, allowing for the normal establishment of *engrailed* expression stripes. At 3.5 hours after egg laying, when the Engrailed (En) protein concentration has reached a steady state, $C_0$, the entire culture is shifted to the restrictive temperature. This time point is designated as $t=0$. Upon the shift, the Wg signaling pathway is immediately blocked, and no new En protein is synthesized. The existing En protein concentration, $C(t)$, begins to decay according to first-order kinetics: $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where $k$ is the degradation rate constant.\n\nExperimental measurements using immunofluorescence show that at $t = 1.25$ hours after the temperature shift, the En protein concentration in the target cells has dropped to 55.0% of its initial value, $C_0$. For a cell to maintain its proper posterior compartment identity, the En concentration must remain above a critical maintenance threshold, which is determined to be 35.0% of the initial concentration, $C_0$.\n\nCalculate the total duration of the temporal window, starting from the temperature shift at $t=0$, during which the En protein concentration remains above this critical maintenance threshold.
