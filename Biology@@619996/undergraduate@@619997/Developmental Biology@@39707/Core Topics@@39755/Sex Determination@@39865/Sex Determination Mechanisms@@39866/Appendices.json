{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental question in developmental biology is whether an organism's sex is predetermined by its genes or sculpted by its environment. This exercise challenges you to act as an experimental biologist, analyzing hypothetical data to distinguish between Genotypic Sex Determination (GSD) and Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination (TSD). By interpreting the sex ratios of turtle hatchlings incubated at different temperatures, you will practice the critical skill of drawing robust conclusions from experimental results [@problem_id:1714546].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the sex determination mechanism of a newly discovered species of freshwater turtle, *Glyptemys novus*. The biologist suspects the species might exhibit Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination (TSD), a process in which the ambient temperature during a critical period of embryonic development determines the sex of the offspring. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted.\n\nA total of 300 freshly laid eggs were collected from various nests to ensure genetic diversity. The eggs were randomly divided into three equal groups (100 eggs each). Each group was incubated at a specific, constant temperature under otherwise identical humidity and gas exchange conditions. After the incubation period, all viable hatchlings were raised until their sex could be reliably identified. The results are summarized below:\n\n*   **Group 1:** Incubated at 25.0 °C, resulted in 98 males and 2 females.\n*   **Group 2:** Incubated at 29.5 °C, resulted in 49 males and 51 females.\n*   **Group 3:** Incubated at 33.0 °C, resulted in 4 males and 96 females.\n\nThere are three common patterns of TSD observed in reptiles:\n*   **Pattern Ia:** Males are produced at cooler incubation temperatures, and females are produced at warmer temperatures.\n*   **Pattern Ib:** Females are produced at cooler incubation temperatures, and males are produced at warmer temperatures.\n*   **Pattern II:** One sex (e.g., females) is produced at both low and high extreme temperatures, while the other sex (e.g., males) is produced at intermediate temperatures.\n\nBased on the experimental data, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate for *Glyptemys novus*?\n\nA. The species exhibits Genotypic Sex Determination (GSD), and the observed variation is due to random chance.\n\nB. The species exhibits TSD Pattern Ia.\n\nC. The species exhibits TSD Pattern Ib.\n\nD. The species exhibits TSD Pattern II.\n\nE. The experimental results are inconclusive and do not provide sufficient evidence to distinguish between GSD and TSD.", "solution": "First, state the defining expectations for each mechanism. Under genotypic sex determination (GSD), sex is determined by genetic factors and is independent of incubation temperature; thus, across treatments with differing temperatures but otherwise identical conditions, the sex ratio should not vary systematically with temperature. Under temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), sex ratios change as a function of incubation temperature. Specifically, Pattern Ia predicts predominantly males at cooler temperatures and predominantly females at warmer temperatures; Pattern Ib predicts the reverse; Pattern II predicts the same sex at both low and high temperatures with the opposite sex predominating at intermediate temperatures.\n\nNext, extract the observed sex ratios at each incubation temperature. At low temperature, 25.0 C, the outcome was 98 males and 2 females, i.e., a male proportion of $\\frac{98}{100}$ and a female proportion of $\\frac{2}{100}$, indicating a strong male bias at low temperature. At the intermediate temperature, 29.5 C, the outcome was 49 males and 51 females, i.e., approximately a balanced sex ratio, with male proportion $\\frac{49}{100}$ and female proportion $\\frac{51}{100}$. At the high temperature, 33.0 C, the outcome was 4 males and 96 females, i.e., a strong female bias, with male proportion $\\frac{4}{100}$ and female proportion $\\frac{96}{100}$.\n\nCompare these observations to the TSD patterns. The pattern of strong male bias at the low temperature, near-parity at the intermediate temperature, and strong female bias at the high temperature is precisely the qualitative signature of TSD Pattern Ia (males at cooler temperatures, females at warmer temperatures). This directly contradicts Pattern Ib (which would require females at cooler temperatures and males at warmer temperatures) and Pattern II (which would require the same sex at both the low and high extremes with the opposite sex at the intermediate temperature). The data show opposite sexes at the two extremes and approximate balance in the middle, which is incompatible with Pattern II.\n\nFinally, evaluate whether GSD with random variation could explain the data. Under GSD, the sex ratio should be independent of temperature; thus, across the three groups of size $100$ each, one would not expect a systematic monotonic shift from predominantly males to predominantly females as temperature increases. The observed pattern—extreme male bias at low temperature, near $1:1$ at the intermediate temperature, and extreme female bias at high temperature—is a strong, directional association with temperature that is not plausibly attributed to random sampling variation under a temperature-independent mechanism. Therefore, the data provide sufficient evidence to reject the GSD-with-chance-variation explanation and to support TSD Pattern Ia.\n\nThus, the most appropriate conclusion is that the species exhibits TSD Pattern Ia.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714546"}, {"introduction": "Genetic sex determination often involves a hierarchical cascade controlled by a \"master switch\" gene. This thought experiment explores the intricate logic of such a system in *Drosophila melanogaster*, focusing on the *Sex-lethal* ($Sxl$) gene. You will predict the developmental outcome of a null mutation in this master regulator, which requires considering its distinct, crucial roles in both somatic sex differentiation and dosage compensation, revealing how a single genetic failure can have complex and even lethal consequences [@problem_id:1714513].", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, sex is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (the X:A ratio). An X:A ratio of 1.0 (found in XX diploid flies) directs the developing organism towards a female fate, while an X:A ratio of 0.5 (found in XY diploid flies) directs it towards a male fate.\n\nThis ratio is interpreted by a master regulatory gene called *Sex-lethal* (*Sxl*). The Sxl gene acts as a binary switch:\n- In individuals with an X:A ratio of 1.0, the Sxl gene is activated and produces a functional Sxl protein.\n- In individuals with an X:A ratio of 0.5, the Sxl gene is inactive and produces no functional protein.\n\nThe functional Sxl protein has two critical and independent roles in XX flies:\n1.  **Somatic Sex Determination**: It acts as a splicing factor that initiates a cascade of gene regulation, ultimately leading to the expression of female-specific differentiation genes and the repression of male-specific ones. In the absence of functional Sxl protein, a default pathway splices downstream transcripts in a manner that leads to male differentiation.\n2.  **Dosage Compensation**: It prevents the expression of a key component of the Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex. The MSL complex is responsible for hyper-transcribing the single X chromosome in males to ensure its gene products are expressed at levels equivalent to the two X chromosomes in females. In the absence of Sxl protein, the MSL complex will form and hyper-transcribe any X chromosomes present.\n\nConsider a null mutation in the *Sex-lethal* gene, denoted $Sxl^-$, which renders the gene completely incapable of producing a functional protein, regardless of the X:A ratio. A researcher sets up a cross that produces a zygote that is chromosomally female (XX) and homozygous for this null mutation (genotype $Sxl^-/Sxl^-$).\n\nWhat is the expected developmental outcome for this individual?\n\nA. Viable and develops as a phenotypically normal, fertile female.\n\nB. Viable and develops as a phenotypically normal, but sterile male.\n\nC. Viable and develops as an intersex individual with mixed male and female characteristics.\n\nD. Non-viable; the zygote will not survive to adulthood.\n\nE. Viable and develops as a phenotypically normal, but sterile female.", "solution": "We start by formalizing the inputs given:\n- Chromosomal constitution is $XX$, so the primary signal is $X:A=1.0$.\n- Genotype at the $Sxl$ locus is $Sxl^-/Sxl^-$, defined as a null mutation that yields no functional Sxl protein in any context.\n\nPrinciple 1 (Signal interpretation): In wild type, $X:A=1.0$ activates the early promoter of $Sxl$, producing functional Sxl protein; $X:A=0.5$ does not. Here, despite $X:A=1.0$, the $Sxl^{-}$ null mutation imposes $S=0$, where $S$ denotes functional Sxl protein. Thus, the master switch is effectively OFF.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Somatic sex determination arm): Sxl acts as an RNA splicing factor that enforces the female-specific splicing cascade. If $S=0$, the default splicing pathway operates, which is male-promoting. Therefore, with $S=0$ in an $XX$ individual, the somatic fate defaults toward male differentiation.\n\nPrinciple 3 (Dosage compensation arm): In $XX$ wild-type females, Sxl prevents expression of a key MSL component, thereby blocking MSL complex formation. In the absence of Sxl ($S=0$), MSL complex formation proceeds. The MSL complex hyper-transcribes X-linked genes. In $XY$ males, this normalizes the single X to match autosomal balance; however, in an $XX$ individual with $S=0$, MSL will hyper-transcribe both X chromosomes. Let $H$ denote the MSL-mediated hyper-transcription factor applied per X chromosome; in an $XX$ individual with MSL active, the combined X-linked output scales as $2H$, which exceeds the balanced female level. This creates a severe X-to-autosome expression imbalance.\n\nConsequence: The dosage compensation misregulation in an $XX$ embryo with $S=0$ is lethal, irrespective of the somatic sex differentiation outcome, because global X-linked overexpression disrupts viability. Therefore, although the somatic splicing program would default to male, the organism will not survive to express an adult phenotype.\n\nConclusion: An $XX$; $Sxl^-/Sxl^-$ individual is non-viable due to inappropriate activation of the MSL complex and consequent lethal X-linked hyper-transcription.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1714513"}, {"introduction": "Making a developmental decision is one thing; maintaining it is another. This practice delves into the molecular mechanisms that stabilize cell fate, moving beyond the initial trigger of sex determination to the feedback loops that lock in the decision. By considering the effect of inhibiting a key signaling pathway in mammalian gonadogenesis, you will explore how positive feedback, exemplified by the $FGF9/SOX9$ loop, ensures the robust and irreversible development of the testis [@problem_id:1714552].", "problem": "In mammalian development, the bipotential gonad differentiates into either a testis or an ovary. In XY individuals, the transient expression of the *SRY* gene on the Y chromosome initiates testis development by inducing the expression of the transcription factor SOX9 in somatic precursor cells, committing them to the Sertoli cell lineage. The newly differentiated Sertoli cells then begin to secrete Fibroblast Growth Factor 9 (FGF9). This secreted FGF9 acts in an autocrine manner, binding to its receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2), on the Sertoli cells themselves. This binding establishes a powerful positive feedback loop that maintains high levels of *Sox9* expression, long after the initial SRY signal has faded. This FGF9/SOX9 loop is critical for continued Sertoli cell proliferation and for actively repressing the alternative ovarian development pathway, which is driven by signals like Wnt4.\n\nConsider a genetically male (XY) mouse embryo that is developing normally. At the stage of gonad differentiation, a potent and specific systemic inhibitor of the FGF9/FGFR2 signaling pathway is administered. This inhibitor completely blocks the binding of FGF9 to FGFR2 throughout the embryo. Based on your understanding of the molecular control of gonadogenesis, what is the most likely outcome for the development of the gonads in this XY embryo?\n\nA. The testes will be fully formed but will be significantly smaller than normal due to a failure of Sertoli cell proliferation.\n\nB. The gonads will fail to develop as testes and will instead differentiate into ovaries, resulting in a complete sex-reversal phenotype.\n\nC. The gonads will fail to differentiate entirely, leading to gonadal agenesis (the complete absence of gonadal tissue).\n\nD. The gonads will develop as ovotestes, containing disorganized patches of both testicular and ovarian tissue.\n\nE. The testes will develop normally, as the initial testis-determining signal from the SRY gene is sufficient to complete the process.", "solution": "In a normal XY gonad, the initial testis-determining event is a transient pulse of *SRY* expression that induces *Sox9* expression in somatic precursor cells, committing them to the Sertoli lineage. Newly formed Sertoli cells secrete FGF9, which binds FGFR2 on Sertoli cells to establish an autocrine positive feedback loop that maintains high *Sox9* expression after the SRY signal has faded. Sustained *Sox9* expression is necessary for continued Sertoli proliferation and for repression of the ovarian pathway driven by signals such as Wnt4.\n\nIf a potent, specific, systemic inhibitor completely blocks FGF9 binding to FGFR2 at the stage of gonad differentiation, the autocrine FGF9/FGFR2 positive feedback loop cannot be established or maintained. Consequently, after the brief SRY signal wanes, *Sox9* expression cannot be sustained, Sertoli cell identity is not stabilized, and their proliferation is curtailed. Critically, without maintained SOX9 activity, the repression of the ovarian pathway fails, allowing Wnt4-driven ovarian differentiation to proceed.\n\nGiven the complete and systemic nature of the blockade, the most likely outcome is a failure of testis differentiation with a shift to the ovarian developmental program, i.e., a male-to-female sex reversal with the formation of ovaries rather than testes. This is more consistent with complete sex reversal than with merely smaller testes, agenesis, or mixed ovotestes under the stipulated complete inhibition of FGF9/FGFR2 signaling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714552"}]}
