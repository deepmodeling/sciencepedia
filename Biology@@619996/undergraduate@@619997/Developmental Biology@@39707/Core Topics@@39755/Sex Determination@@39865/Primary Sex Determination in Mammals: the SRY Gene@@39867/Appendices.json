This developmental decision is genetically controlled. In individuals with a Y chromosome, a gene called the Sex-determining Region on the Y chromosome (*SRY*) is typically expressed. The protein product of this gene is a transcription factor, a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of other genes. In the absence of a functional SRY protein, the default developmental pathway for the bipotential gonad is to form an ovary.\n\nConsider a human individual with a 46,XY karyotype. This individual carries a specific point mutation in the *SRY* gene. The mutation does not affect the production or stability of the SRY protein, but it alters the protein's DNA-binding domain, making it completely unable to bind to its target DNA sequences.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most likely developmental fate of this individual's bipotential gonads?\n\nA. The gonads will develop into testes.\n\nB. The gonads will develop into ovaries.\n\nC. The gonads will develop into ovotestes, which are gonads containing both testicular and ovarian tissue.\n\nD. The gonads will fail to develop and will atrophy, remaining as undifferentiated tissue.", "solution": "Primary sex determination in mammals depends on whether the bipotential gonad receives a functional testis-determining signal. In individuals with a Y chromosome, the critical initiating factor is the SRY transcription factor, which must bind specific DNA sequences to activate downstream testis-promoting genes.\n\nSRY function requires its DNA-binding (HMG box) domain to engage target enhancers and promoters to upregulate key effectors such as *SOX9*, which then reinforces the testis pathway (including *FGF9* signaling and anti-Mullerian hormone expression) and suppresses the ovarian pathway (e.g., *WNT4*, *RSPO1*, *FOXL2*).\n\nIn the scenario described, the SRY protein is produced and stable but is completely unable to bind DNA due to a mutation in its DNA-binding domain. This constitutes a loss of SRY transcriptional function. Therefore, the SRY-dependent testis-determining cascade cannot be initiated. In the absence of functional SRY activity, the bipotential gonad follows the default pathway, which is ovarian development.\n\nConsidering the options:\n- A is incorrect because testes formation requires functional SRY-driven transcriptional activation.\n- C is unlikely because ovotestes typically arise from mosaicism or partial/variable pathway activation, not from a complete loss of SRY DNA-binding.\n- D is incorrect because the gonads do not atrophy by default; they differentiate along the ovarian pathway without SRY.\n\nThus, the gonads will develop into ovaries.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1709849"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to a practical application, this exercise places you in the role of a clinical geneticist. You will interpret the results from a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay, a core technique in molecular biology, to diagnose a patient's genetic sex. This problem sharpens your ability to analyze experimental data and illustrates how careful primer design can distinguish between a typical XY male and an individual with an *SRY* gene translocation [@problem_id:1709846].", "problem": "A clinical genetics laboratory receives DNA samples from three individuals—Patient 1, Patient 2, and Patient 3—to determine their genetic sex. In mammals, sex is typically determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome, specifically the Sex-determining Region on Y (*SRY*) gene. However, rare chromosomal abnormalities can lead to a mismatch between karyotype and phenotype.\n\nTo investigate, a researcher performs a multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on each DNA sample. The reaction uses two distinct pairs of primers:\n1.  ***SRY* primers**: These primers are designed to amplify a 200 base pair (bp) fragment of the *SRY* gene.\n2.  **Y-MARK primers**: These primers target a stable genetic marker, `Y-MARK`, located on a region of the Y chromosome that is not typically transferred during the type of translocation event that moves the *SRY* gene. This amplification produces a 500 bp fragment.\n\nA third primer pair for a ubiquitous autosomal gene was also included as a positive control, and it successfully produced the expected band in all three reactions, confirming the integrity of the DNA and the PCR process. The PCR products were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, yielding the following results for the two target gene fragments:\n\n*   **Patient 1**: A single DNA band was observed at 200 bp.\n*   **Patient 2**: No DNA bands were observed at either 200 bp or 500 bp.\n*   **Patient 3**: Two DNA bands were observed, one at 200 bp and one at 500 bp.\n\nBased on these results, identify the most likely genetic condition for each patient from the following possibilities:\n*   **Condition F**: XX Female\n*   **Condition M**: XY Male\n*   **Condition T**: XX Male (due to translocation of the *SRY* gene)\n\nWhich of the following options correctly matches each patient to their condition?\n\nA.

The positive autosomal control in all samples confirms DNA quality and PCR success, so absence of a specific target band reflects true absence of that target sequence rather than technical failure.\n\nInterpretation by patient:\n- Patient 1 shows only the 200 bp *SRY* band and lacks the 500 bp `Y-MARK` band. This pattern indicates presence of *SRY* without the stable Y chromosomal marker. Given that `Y-MARK` is not transferred in the common *SRY* translocation event, this most strongly supports an XX individual with *SRY* translocated (XX male), which corresponds to Condition T.\n- Patient 2 shows no *SRY* band (200 bp) and no `Y-MARK` band (500 bp), while the autosomal control was positive. This indicates absence of Y chromosomal material, consistent with an XX female, which corresponds to Condition F.\n- Patient 3 shows both the 200 bp *SRY* band and the 500 bp `Y-MARK` band, indicating presence of *SRY* and broader Y chromosomal material, consistent with a typical XY male, which corresponds to Condition M.\n\nMatching to options, the correct assignment is Patient 1: Condition T, Patient 2: Condition F, Patient 3: Condition M, which is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1709846"}, {"introduction": "Biological development often involves complex interactions between different cell populations. This problem presents a case of genetic mosaicism, where an individual has both $46,XX$ and $46,XY$ cells, challenging the simple binary view of sex determination. By predicting the gonadal fate, you will explore how local cell-to-cell signaling and competing developmental pathways can lead to a mixed phenotype, such as an ovotestis, within a single organ [@problem_id:1709805].", "problem": "In mammalian development, the embryonic gonads are initially bipotential, meaning they have the potential to develop into either testes or ovaries. The primary switch that determines this fate is a single gene located on the Y chromosome, the Sex-determining Region on the Y chromosome (*SRY*) gene. The *SRY* gene encodes a transcription factor that, when expressed in a subset of somatic cells within the bipotential gonad, directs them to differentiate into Sertoli cells. These Sertoli cells then act as organizing centers, secreting signaling molecules that induce the differentiation of other cell types to form a testis and actively repress the female developmental pathway. In the absence of a functional *SRY* gene (as in 46,XX individuals), the equivalent somatic cells in the bipotential gonad differentiate into granulosa cells. Granulosa cells, in turn, orchestrate the development of an ovary.\n\nConsider a rare clinical case where, due to a mitotic error in the early embryo, an individual is a genetic mosaic. Their body is composed of a mixed population of cells, with approximately half being 46,XX (genetically female) and the other half being 46,XY (genetically male). Assume this mosaicism is evenly distributed throughout the body, including the bipotential gonads.\n\nBased on these fundamental principles of primary sex determination, what is the most likely developmental outcome for the gonads of this individual?\n\nA. The gonads will develop into structurally normal testes, because the presence of any SRY-expressing cells is sufficient to trigger full testicular development throughout the entire gonad.\n\nB. The gonads will develop into structurally normal ovaries, because the 46,XX cells will actively suppress the action of the 46,XY cells, causing the gonad to follow the default ovarian pathway.\n\nC. The individual will develop one testis and one ovary, as the 46,XX and 46,XY cell lineages will segregate completely into the left and right gonadal ridges, respectively.\n\nD. The gonads will fail to develop and will remain as undifferentiated streaks of tissue, because the conflicting developmental signals from the 46,XX and 46,XY cells will lead to widespread cellular apoptosis and developmental arrest.\n\nE. The gonads will develop into ovotestes, containing both testicular tubules (derived from 46,XY cell regions) and ovarian follicles (derived from 46,XX cell regions) within the same organ.", "solution": "The bipotential gonad contains progenitor supporting cells that, under the influence of *SRY* expression, differentiate into Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells are organizer cells that initiate the testis pathway by activating a *SOX9*-dependent program and secreting paracrine signals such as anti-Müllerian hormone and factors like *FGF9* and *DHH*, which locally recruit additional testicular lineages and repress the ovarian pathway. In the absence of *SRY*, equivalent progenitors differentiate into granulosa cells, which, through factors associated with the *WNT4*, *RSPO1*, and *FOXL2* pathway, promote ovarian follicle formation and repress testis differentiation. These organizing effects are primarily local and paracrine, not uniformly global across the entire gonad.\n\nIn a mosaic individual with an even mix of 46,XX and 46,XY cells throughout the gonadal ridges, some supporting-cell progenitors will be 46,XY and express *SRY* to become Sertoli cells, while neighboring 46,XX progenitors will not express *SRY* and will tend toward granulosa fate. Because Sertoli cells act as local organizers, they will induce testicular cord formation in domains enriched for *SRY*-expressing 46,XY cells. Conversely, regions enriched for 46,XX cells lacking *SRY* will differentiate into ovarian tissue with granulosa cells and follicles. The antagonistic pathways (*SOX9*/*FGF9* versus *WNT4*/*RSPO1*/*FOXL2*) create a mosaic, domain-limited outcome rather than a uniform conversion of the entire organ.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because the presence of some *SRY*-expressing cells does not globally convert the entire gonad; their effects are local and opposed by ovarian pathway signals in XX regions.\n- Option B is incorrect because the ovarian pathway is default only in the absence of *SRY*; *SRY*-positive regions will still drive local testis differentiation.\n- Option C is unlikely because early even mosaicism would not systematically segregate cell lineages into left versus right ridges; both ridges would be mosaic.\n- Option D is incorrect because conflicting signals do not typically cause global apoptosis and streak gonads; instead, each lineage establishes its local program.\n- Option E is the expected outcome: ovotestes with intermingled or regionalized testicular cords (from 46,XY/*SRY*-positive domains) and ovarian follicles (from 46,XX domains) within the same gonad.\n\nThus, the most likely developmental outcome is ovotestes within each gonad.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1709805"}]}
