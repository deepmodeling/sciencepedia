The number of Barr bodies follows a simple rule: it is one less than the total number of X chromosomes ($N_X - 1$).

By calculating the average number of Barr bodies in a tissue sample, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how dosage compensation manifests across a mixed cell population.", "problem": "In human somatic cells, a mechanism called X-chromosome inactivation ensures dosage compensation between males (XY) and females (XX). This process involves the condensation of all but one X chromosome into a compact, transcriptionally inert structure known as a Barr body. Consequently, the number of Barr bodies visible within a cell's nucleus is one less than the total number of its X chromosomes.\n\nA geneticist is analyzing a tissue sample from a patient with a rare mosaic condition involving sex chromosome aneuploidy.

The non-coding RNA produced by *XIST* is the master signal that initiates silencing on the chromosome from which it is transcribed. This exercise [@problem_id:1484351] presents a fascinating case of non-random, or skewed, inactivation due to a chromosomal mutation, forcing you to think critically about the molecular requirements for a chromosome to be silenced.", "problem": "In human females, dosage compensation for X-linked genes is achieved by the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in somatic cells, a process that forms a visible Barr body. This inactivation is initiated by a region on the X chromosome called the X-Inactivation Center (XIC), which contains the *XIST* (X-inactive specific transcript) gene. The *XIST* gene produces a non-coding RNA that coats the chromosome from which it is transcribed, leading to its condensation and silencing.\n\nConsider a female individual with a rare chromosomal constitution. Her karyotype is found to be $46,X,r(X)$, meaning she has one normal X chromosome and one ring X chromosome, denoted $r(X)$. Detailed genetic analysis reveals that the ring X chromosome, $r(X)$, has a deletion that completely removes the *XIST* gene locus, while the normal X chromosome is structurally and genetically intact. Assuming that survival of the cell requires proper dosage compensation (i.e., the inactivation of one X chromosome), which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of X-inactivation in this individual's somatic cells?\n\nA. The normal X chromosome will be preferentially inactivated in all somatic cells.\n\nB. The ring X chromosome, $r(X)$, will be preferentially inactivated in all somatic cells because it is abnormal.\n\nC. Inactivation will be random, with some cells inactivating the normal X and other cells inactivating the ring X.\n\nD. Neither X chromosome will be inactivated, resulting in cells with a double dose of most X-linked genes.\n\nE. Both X chromosomes will be partially inactivated to compensate for the abnormal chromosome structure.", "solution": "Principle of X-chromosome inactivation: In mammalian females, dosage compensation is achieved by inactivating one X chromosome per somatic cell. Initiation requires the X-Inactivation Center (XIC), which includes the gene *XIST*. *XIST* produces a non-coding RNA that acts in cis to coat the chromosome from which it is transcribed, initiating its condensation and silencing. The chromosome that expresses *XIST* becomes the inactive X (Barr body). A chromosome lacking a functional *XIST* locus cannot initiate its own inactivation.\n\nGiven karyotype $46,X,r(X)$ with one normal X and one ring X, and the ring X has a deletion completely removing the *XIST* locus:\n1. The $r(X)$ cannot express *XIST*, so it cannot be inactivated in cis. Therefore, it is not a viable candidate for the inactive X.\n2. The cellular counting mechanism still requires that one X be inactivated for proper dosage compensation. With two X chromosomes present, the system will initiate inactivation on a chromosome capable of doing so.\n3. The only chromosome capable of inactivation is the normal X, which retains an intact XIC and *XIST*. Thus, the normal X will express *XIST*, be coated by its RNA, and become the inactive X (Barr body).\n4. This choice occurs early in development and is clonally propagated, so somatic cells will show skewed inactivation, with the normal X preferentially inactivated in essentially all cells.\n\nEliminating the options:\n- B is incorrect because $r(X)$ lacks *XIST* and cannot be inactivated despite being structurally abnormal.\n- C is incorrect because random choice requires both X chromosomes to be competent for inactivation; here only the normal X is competent.\n- D is incorrect because the counting mechanism enforces inactivation of one X, and the normal X can fulfill this.\n- E is incorrect because X-inactivation is not partial on both chromosomes; it is an all-or-none cis process requiring *XIST* on the inactivated chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the normal X will be preferentially inactivated in all somatic cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1484351"}, {"introduction": "X-chromosome inactivation creates a fascinating biological phenomenon known as genetic mosaicism, where different cell populations express different X-linked alleles within the same individual.
