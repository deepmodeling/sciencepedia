[@problem_id:1715085]", "problem": "In vertebrate limb development, the identity of digits along the anterior-posterior axis (analogous to the thumb-to-pinky axis in humans) is specified by a secreted signaling molecule. A small region of tissue at the posterior margin of the developing limb bud, known as the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA), is the source of this signal. The current model posits that this signal functions as a morphogen, where different concentrations specify distinct digit identities. In the developing chick wing, the normal digit pattern, ordered from anterior to posterior, is 2-3-4. This pattern is thought to arise from a concentration gradient of the morphogen: a high concentration specifies digit 4 (posterior-most), an intermediate concentration specifies digit 3, and a low or absent concentration specifies digit 2 (anterior-most).\n\nAn experiment is designed to test the hypothesis that the protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a sufficient signal for this patterning process. A small, inert bead is soaked in a high concentration of purified, recombinant Shh protein. This bead is then surgically implanted into the anterior margin of an early chick wing bud, a region that normally gives rise to digit 2 and is distant from the endogenous ZPA. The embryo is then incubated, allowing the limb to develop.\n\nAssuming that Shh is indeed the morphogen responsible for posterior digit identity and that the implanted bead successfully establishes a stable, ectopic source of Shh, what is the predicted pattern of digits in the resulting wing, when viewed from anterior to posterior?\n\nA. 2-3-4\n\nB. 4-4-4\n\nC. 2-2-2\n\nD. 4-3-2-3-4\n\nE. 4-3-2", "solution": "Assume the anterior-posterior axis is parameterized by a coordinate $x \\in [0,L]$, with $x=0$ at the anterior margin and $x=L$ at the posterior margin. Let $c(x)$ denote the local concentration of the morphogen. The morphogen model posits threshold-based fate specification:\n- There exist thresholds $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ with $T_{4} > T_{3} > 0$ such that:\n  - If $c(x) \\geq T_{4}$, the posterior-most identity (digit $4$) is specified.\n  - If $T_{3} \\leq c(x) < T_{4}$, an intermediate identity (digit $3$) is specified.\n  - If $c(x) < T_{3}$, the anterior identity (digit $2$) is specified.\n\nIn the normal wing bud, the ZPA at the posterior margin is a localized source at $x=L$, establishing a posterior-to-anterior decreasing profile. A standard steady-state diffusion-decay model for a localized source yields a monotonic decreasing function of the distance from the source; for concreteness, one may write\n$$\nc_{P}(x) = A_{P} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{L - x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $A_{P} > 0$ characterizes source strength and $\\lambda > 0$ is an effective length scale.

This scenario explores a \"loss-of-function\" scenario where a key component of the Shh pathway, the Patched1 receptor, is mutated to be permanently suppressive. Predicting the limb's fate in this case reveals the 'default' developmental program and underscores the necessity of a functional pathway to receive and respond to morphogen instructions. [@problem_id:1715098]", "problem": "In vertebrate limb development, the anterior-posterior (thumb-to-pinky) axis is established by a gradient of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is secreted from a region of cells at the posterior margin of the limb bud called the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA). The Shh signal is interpreted by target cells through a specific signaling pathway. In the absence of Shh, the transmembrane receptor Patched1 (Ptc1) actively inhibits another transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo). This inhibition leads to the proteolytic processing of the Gli transcription factor into a repressor form (GliR), which blocks the expression of genes required for posterior limb structures. When Shh binds to Ptc1, the inhibition on Smo is relieved. Active Smo then prevents the processing of Gli into its repressor form, allowing the full-length activator form (GliA) to promote the expression of posterior-identity genes. High concentrations of Shh specify the most posterior digits (e.g., digit 5, the pinky), while lower concentrations specify more intermediate digits (e.g., digit 3, the middle finger).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a genetic mutation occurs in the gene encoding the Ptc1 receptor.

The relevant logic is:\n- In the absence of Shh: Ptc1 inhibits Smo, leading to processing of Gli into a repressor form (GliR). GliR blocks posterior-identity gene expression, favoring anterior identities.\n- In the presence of Shh: Shh binds Ptc1 and relieves its inhibition on Smo. Active Smo prevents Gli processing into GliR, allowing full-length Gli activator (GliA) to promote posterior-identity gene expression. High Shh specifies more posterior digits.\n\nStep 2: In the hypothetical mutation, Ptc1 constitutively inhibits Smo regardless of Shh binding. Therefore:\n- Smo remains inactive throughout the limb bud even in the presence of Shh.\n- Gli is constitutively processed into GliR, preventing the formation of GliA.\n- Posterior-identity genes fail to be expressed because the pathway remains off, independent of Shh concentrations.\n\nStep 3: Predicted patterning consequence:\n- With posterior signaling blocked, posterior fates cannot be specified. The limb becomes anteriorized, losing posterior digits. This yields a hand lacking posterior digits (such as digits $4$ and $5$), potentially leaving only one or two anterior-like digits.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options:\n- A (extra posterior-like digits) requires ectopic/constitutive Shh pathway activation (e.g., loss of Ptc1 function or constitutively active Smo), the opposite of constitutive inhibition; thus incorrect.\n- B (loss of proximal bones) refers to proximodistal patterning controlled primarily by AER/FGF signaling, not directly by Shh; thus incorrect.\n- C (loss of posterior digits, anteriorization) matches the predicted outcome of constitutive Smo inhibition; thus correct.\n- D (mirror-image duplication) typically results from ectopic anterior Shh/ZPA activity, i.e., increased posteriorizing signal, not its suppression; thus incorrect.\n- E (normal development due to high Shh overcoming inhibition) contradicts the mutation’s definition; if Ptc1 inhibition is constitutive and Shh-insensitive, Shh cannot rescue; thus incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is the loss of posterior digits with anteriorization of the limb pattern, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1715098"}, {"introduction": "To complete our exploration of the signaling pathway, we now consider the logical opposite: a \"gain-of-function\" mutation.

Shh is secreted from a posterior organizing center called the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA). The Shh signal is transduced through a pathway involving two key transmembrane proteins: Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo). In the absence of Shh, Ptc inhibits Smo. When Shh binds to Ptc, this inhibition is relieved, allowing Smo to become active and initiate a downstream cascade that leads to the expression of posterior-identity genes.

Mechanistically, Patched (Ptc) inhibits Smoothened (Smo) in the absence of Shh; when Shh binds Ptc, this inhibition is relieved, Smo becomes active, and the downstream cascade (via Gli transcription factors) induces posterior-identity gene expression. A higher effective Shh signal specifies more posterior digit identities.\n\nIn the engineered mouse, Smo is constitutively active in all limb bud mesenchyme cells. By definition, constitutively active Smo is in the functional “on” state regardless of Shh or Ptc, so:\n1) The need for Shh ligand to relieve Ptc inhibition is bypassed in every cell.\n2) The Shh pathway readout becomes uniformly active across the entire anterior-posterior axis.\n3) This uniform activation eliminates the normal Shh gradient and causes all competent mesenchymal cells to interpret a “high Shh” state.\n\nConsequences for patterning follow directly:\n- Loss of gradient means loss of differential A-P identities; instead, posteriorization occurs throughout the limb field.\n- Shh/Smo activity also promotes mesenchymal proliferation and digit formation, so pathway hyperactivation typically increases digit number (polydactyly).\n- With uniformly high pathway activation, specified identities skew to the most posterior fate. Thus, extra digits tend to take on posterior (digit V-like) characteristics.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is unlikely because Shh pathway activation promotes growth and patterning rather than causing limb absence, which more commonly follows severe loss of Shh-FGF signaling.\n- B (mirror-image duplications) typically results from establishing a second, localized posterior organizer in the anterior, creating two opposing gradients. Uniform Smo activation does not create opposing gradients; thus mirror-image patterns are not the most likely outcome.\n- C is incompatible with the strong pathway activation that disrupts normal gradients.\n- E (reversal) would require inversion of the gradient, not uniform activation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is polydactyly with posteriorized digit identities, i.e., digits displaying characteristics of digit V.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1715065"}]}
