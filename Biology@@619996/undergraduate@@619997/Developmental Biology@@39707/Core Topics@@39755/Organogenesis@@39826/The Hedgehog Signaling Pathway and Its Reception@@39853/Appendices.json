This practice uses the powerful genetic concept of epistasis to determine the relationship between the key receptors, Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo). By predicting the outcome in a cell lacking both proteins, you can deduce which component's function is required for the other to act, thereby ordering the core events of Hedgehog signal reception.", "problem": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a fundamental mechanism in animal development, controlling cell fate and proliferation. The core reception mechanism on the surface of a target cell involves two key transmembrane proteins: Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo).\n\nIn the absence of the Hh signaling ligand, Ptc functions to actively inhibit the activity of Smo. This keeps the downstream intracellular signaling cascade in an \"off\" state, and Hh target genes are not transcribed.\n\nWhen the Hh ligand binds to its receptor, Ptc, the Ptc protein is internalized and degraded. This binding event relieves the inhibition that Ptc exerts on Smo. Consequently, Smo becomes active and initiates the downstream cascade, leading to the transcription of Hh target genes, turning the pathway \"on\".\n\nA researcher is investigating this pathway in a cell line and has created a double mutant cell. This special cell line possesses two distinct null mutations: one is a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Ptc, and the other is a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Smo.\n\nBased on the described mechanism, predict the activity level of the Hh target gene transcription in this double mutant cell, regardless of whether the Hh ligand is present or absent.\n\nA. The pathway will be constitutively active (always on).\n\nB. The pathway will be constitutively inactive (always off).\n\nC. The pathway will function normally, responding to the presence or absence of the Hedgehog ligand.\n\nD. The pathway's activity will be intermediate, somewhere between the fully active and fully inactive states.", "solution": "We formalize the core logic of the Hedgehog reception mechanism using Boolean variables:\n- Let $P$ denote the presence of functional Patched protein (Ptc).\n- Let $M$ denote the presence of functional Smoothened protein (Smo).\n- Let $H$ denote the presence of Hedgehog ligand.\n- Let $S$ denote the activity state of Smo.\n- Let $T$ denote the transcriptional output of Hh target genes.\n\nMechanistic rules given:\n1) Ptc inhibits Smo when Ptc is functional and unbound by Hh. Binding of Hh to Ptc leads to Ptc internalization/degradation, relieving inhibition of Smo.\n2) Active Smo is necessary to initiate the downstream cascade that drives Hh target gene transcription.\n\nEncode inhibition by an effective inhibitor variable $I$:\n$$I = P \\land \\neg H.$$\nThus, when $P=1$ and $H=0$, inhibition is on; if either $P=0$ or $H=1$, inhibition is off.\n\nSmo activity requires two conditions: the presence of Smo protein and the absence of Ptc-mediated inhibition. Therefore,\n$$S = M \\land \\neg I = M \\land \\neg(P \\land \\neg H).$$\n\nTranscription requires active Smo; we model this as:\n$$T = S.$$\n\nAnalyze genotypes:\n- Wild type benchmark: $P=1$, $M=1$. Then $S = 1 \\land \\neg(1 \\land \\neg H) = \\neg(\\neg H) = H$, hence $T=H$ (off without Hh, on with Hh), consistent with the described pathway.\n- Ptc loss-of-function single mutant: $P=0$, $M=1$. Then $I=0$, so $S = 1 \\land 1 = 1$, hence $T=1$ (constitutively active).\n- Smo loss-of-function single mutant: $P=1$, $M=0$.

The pathway is constitutively off, independent of $H$.\n\nThus the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1722694"}, {"introduction": "Building on the hierarchical relationship between Ptc and Smo, this exercise explores the crucial role of negative regulation in controlling the pathway's activity. You will analyze a hypothetical genetic mosaic where a clone of cells lacks the Ptc receptor, which functions as the pathway's primary inhibitor. This thought experiment demonstrates the cell-autonomous consequences of removing the \"brakes\" from a signaling system and reinforces why the Hedgehog pathway's default state is kept actively off.", "problem": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a fundamental regulator of cell fate and patterning during animal development. The core reception mechanism involves two transmembrane proteins: Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo). In the absence of the Hh signaling molecule, the Ptc receptor actively inhibits the activity of Smo, keeping the pathway in an \"off\" state where downstream target genes are not transcribed. When Hh binds to Ptc, this inhibition is relieved, allowing Smo to become active and initiate a signaling cascade that results in the transcription of Hh target genes.\n\nImagine a scenario in a developing embryo where a small clone of cells possesses a homozygous, loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Ptc protein. These cells are thus incapable of producing any functional Ptc. This mutant clone is completely surrounded by wild-type cells that produce and secrete the Hh signaling molecule.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of Hh target gene expression exclusively *within the cells of this mutant clone*?\n\nA. Hh target genes will be expressed at a high, constant level, regardless of the presence of Hh ligand from surrounding cells.\n\nB. Hh target genes will not be expressed at all, because the cell's primary receptor for the Hh ligand is non-functional.\n\nC. Hh target genes will be expressed in a regulated manner, directly responding to the concentration of Hh ligand secreted by the neighboring wild-type cells.\n\nD. The cells will undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) due to the inability to properly process external signals.\n\nE. Hh target genes will be expressed at a low basal level, but cannot be further activated, as the pathway is now insensitive to Hh ligand.", "solution": "We first recall the core regulatory logic of the Hedgehog pathway. In the absence of ligand, Patched (Ptc) actively inhibits Smoothened (Smo), which prevents activation of the downstream signaling cascade and keeps target genes off. When Hedgehog (Hh) binds to Ptc, this binding relieves Ptc’s inhibition of Smo, allowing Smo to signal and induce transcription of Hh target genes. Thus, Ptc functions as a negative regulator of Smo.\n\nConsider the effect of a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in Ptc within a clone of cells. Because Ptc’s normal role is to inhibit Smo, the complete absence of functional Ptc removes this inhibition regardless of extracellular Hh concentration. Therefore, Smo becomes constitutively active in these mutant cells. Constitutive Smo activity leads to continuous activation of the downstream transcriptional program of Hh target genes, independent of ligand presence.\n\nThe fact that the mutant clone is surrounded by wild-type cells that secrete Hh does not change the intrinsic, cell-autonomous outcome within the Ptc-null cells: they cannot inhibit Smo via Ptc, so they do not require Hh to relieve inhibition. While the absence of Ptc in the clone may alter Hh distribution for neighboring wild-type cells (a non-cell-autonomous effect), the question explicitly asks about target gene expression within the mutant clone. Within the clone, Smo is active constitutively and Hh target genes are expressed at a high, constant level, independent of ligand.\n\nAmong the options:\n- A states constitutive, high-level expression regardless of ligand, which matches the logic above.\n- B is incorrect because loss of Ptc removes inhibition and does not block signaling; Smo can signal without Ptc when not inhibited.\n- C is incorrect because Ptc-null cells do not require ligand to activate signaling and thus do not respond proportionally to extracellular Hh.\n- D is unrelated to the canonical consequence of Ptc loss in this pathway.\n- E is incorrect because the expected state is not low basal but high constitutive activation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1722712"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between molecular mechanisms and complex biological form, demonstrating how the Hedgehog pathway patterns the developing limb. By considering a genetically engineered mouse expressing a unique variant of the Gli3 transcription factor, you are challenged to predict a macroscopic anatomical phenotype. This exercise illuminates the sophisticated logic by which a gradient of Shh signaling is interpreted through the dual activator and repressor functions of Gli proteins to generate precise anatomical structures.", "problem": "In vertebrate limb development, the anterior-posterior axis is patterned by a gradient of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) morphogen, which is secreted from a posterior organizing center called the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA). The cellular response to the Shh gradient is primarily mediated by the Gli family of transcription factors, particularly Gli3. In the absence of Shh signaling (e.g., in the anterior-most region of the limb bud), the full-length Gli3 protein is proteolytically cleaved into a shorter form, Gli3-Repressor (Gli3R), which actively represses the transcription of Shh target genes. In the presence of high concentrations of Shh (e.g., in the posterior region), this cleavage is inhibited, and a full-length activator form, Gli3-Activator (Gli3A), promotes the expression of target genes, leading to the formation of posterior structures.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetically engineered mouse model in which the endogenous Gli3 gene has been replaced with a gene that exclusively expresses a specific splice variant, let's call it `Gli3ΔN`. This `Gli3ΔN` protein is missing its entire N-terminal domain, which contains the proteolytic cleavage sites necessary to form Gli3R, but it retains its complete C-terminal activation domain. Assume this `Gli3ΔN` protein is stable and can enter the nucleus.\n\nBased on your understanding of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, what is the most likely phenotype that will be observed in the digit pattern of the forelimbs in homozygous `Gli3ΔN` embryos?\n\nA. The limb develops a normal digit pattern.\n\nB. The limb fails to develop any digits.\n\nC. The limb develops with a mirror-image duplication of the most anterior digits.\n\nD. The limb develops digits that all possess a posterior identity.\n\nE. The limb develops only the two most posterior digits, with a complete loss of anterior and intermediate digits.", "solution": "We begin from the core principles of Hedgehog signaling in limb development:\n- In the absence of Shh, full-length Gli3 is proteolytically processed to a repressor form, Gli3R, which represses Shh target genes. This processing establishes a high Gli3R state in the anterior limb bud, promoting anterior identities by suppressing posterior gene programs.\n- In the presence of Shh, the proteolytic cleavage of Gli3 is inhibited, allowing full-length Gli3 to act as a transcriptional activator (Gli3A), thereby promoting Shh target gene expression and posterior identities. The posterior limb bud thus has low Gli3R and relatively higher activator activity.\n\nTherefore, a normal anterior-posterior pattern depends on a graded balance: high Gli3R and low activator anteriorly versus low Gli3R and higher activator posteriorly.\n\nNow consider the engineered allele: the endogenous Gli3 is replaced by a splice variant, Gli3ΔN, that lacks the entire N-terminal domain containing the proteolytic cleavage sites required for generating Gli3R, while retaining the complete C-terminal activation domain. We are told Gli3ΔN is stable and nuclear. The direct mechanistic consequences are:\n1. Loss of the ability to generate Gli3R anywhere in the limb bud, because the necessary N-terminal cleavage sites are absent.\n2. Preservation of the C-terminal activation domain allows the protein to function as a transcriptional activator. Because the variant lacks the cleavage domain, it should not be converted to a repressor even in the absence of Shh, making activator function available independently of Shh-dependent inhibition of processing.\n\nFrom these two points, the net effect across the entire limb bud is a collapse of the normal anterior Gli3R field and a relative gain of activator function even in regions that are normally repressor-dominated. This removes the repression of Shh target genes in the anterior and shifts the transcriptional balance toward posterior gene expression throughout the limb bud.\n\nThe predicted developmental outcome is posteriorization of digit identities across the limb, because:\n- Gli3R is the principal determinant of anterior identity; its absence eliminates repression of posterior programs anteriorly.\n- Constitutive or widespread activator activity from Gli3ΔN further enforces posterior gene expression.\n\nEvaluating the options in light of these mechanisms:\n- A (normal digit pattern) is incompatible with the loss of Gli3R and gain of activator, which disrupts the anterior-posterior balance.\n- B (no digits) is inconsistent with Hedgehog pathway activation; loss of digits is more consistent with severe loss of Shh signaling, not constitutive activator bias.\n- C (mirror-image duplication of the most anterior digits) is opposite to the expected posteriorization; mirror-image duplications are typically associated with ectopic posterior organizer activity leading to duplicated posterior elements, not anterior duplications.\n- D (all digits possess a posterior identity) matches the predicted global posteriorization resulting from the absence of Gli3R and the presence of activator function across the limb.\n- E (only the two most posterior digits form) is characteristic of severe Shh loss-of-function (anteriorization), the opposite of the current manipulation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is that all digits adopt posterior identity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1722654"}]}
