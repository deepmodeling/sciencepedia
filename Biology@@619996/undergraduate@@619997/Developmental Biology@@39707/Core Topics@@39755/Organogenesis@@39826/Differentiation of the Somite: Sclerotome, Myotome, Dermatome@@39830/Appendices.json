{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how a single cell in an embryo embarks on a specific developmental path is a central question in developmental biology. This practice places you in the role of a laboratory scientist designing a crucial experiment to test the function of a signaling molecule. By considering how to induce cartilage differentiation from unspecified somite cells in a simplified culture dish, you will explore the powerful, instructive nature of molecules like Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in determining cell fate [@problem_id:1680397].", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, a researcher is investigating the molecular signals that govern somite patterning in a chick embryo. Somites are transient blocks of mesoderm that give rise to the vertebrae, ribs, skeletal muscles, and dermis. A newly formed somite is an epithelial ball of cells which subsequently differentiates into distinct compartments based on signals from neighboring tissues. The researcher carefully dissects out the ventromedial portion of several newly formed somites. These cells represent the presumptive sclerotome, the population of cells fated to form the cartilage of the axial skeleton. The isolated cells are placed in a neutral culture medium that supports cell viability but does not contain any specific differentiation factors.\n\nTo test a hypothesis about sclerotome induction, the researcher plans to add a single, purified signaling molecule to the culture medium. The goal is to promote the differentiation of these presumptive sclerotome cells into chondrocytes, which are cartilage-producing cells.\n\nWhich one of the following signaling molecules, when added to the culture medium, would be the most effective at inducing the differentiation of these isolated presumptive sclerotome cells into cartilage?\n\nA) BMP4 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)\n\nB) Wnt1 (Wingless-related integration site 1)\n\nC) Sonic hedgehog (Shh)\n\nD) Noggin\n\nE) FGF8 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 8)", "solution": "We start from the established embryological principle that ventromedial somite cells (presumptive sclerotome) are induced by signals from the adjacent notochord and floor plate of the neural tube. The key instructive signal in this context is Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which diffuses from the notochord and floor plate to the ventromedial somite.\n\nMechanistically, Shh signaling in ventromedial somite cells induces a sclerotome fate characterized by activation of transcription factors such as Pax1 and subsequent chondrogenic regulators including Sox9. This sequence initiates the differentiation program toward chondrocytes that form the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc components. In experimental settings, Shh is sufficient to induce sclerotome markers and chondrogenesis in somitic mesoderm cultured in neutral conditions, making it the most effective single purified factor for this goal.\n\nIn contrast, BMP4, primarily from lateral plate mesoderm, promotes lateral and dorsal fates and supports dermomyotome formation; in the somite context, BMP signaling tends to antagonize sclerotome induction. Wnt1 from the dorsal neural tube promotes dermomyotome and myotome and inhibits ventral sclerotome differentiation. Noggin is a BMP antagonist produced by the notochord, which permits sclerotome induction by blocking BMP, but alone it is not an instructive inducer of the chondrogenic program; without a positive inductive cue such as Shh, Noggin in a neutral medium would not drive robust chondrogenesis. FGF8 participates in segmentation and maintains progenitor states; it is not the principal inducer of sclerotome-derived chondrogenesis.\n\nTherefore, adding Shh directly provides the necessary and sufficient instructive signal to drive presumptive sclerotome cells toward chondrocyte differentiation in vitro, making Sonic hedgehog the most effective choice among the options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1680397"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of instructive signals, this exercise explores the critical importance of signal distribution, or gradients. In development, it's often not just the presence of a signal but its precise concentration that tells a cell what to become. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario—a \"thought experiment\"—where the normal gradient of the Shh signal is lost, forcing you to predict the consequences for tissue patterning and reinforcing the principle that spatial information is key to building complex structures [@problem_id:1680426].", "problem": "In vertebrate development, blocks of paraxial mesoderm called somites progressively differentiate along the dorsoventral axis to form distinct tissues. The ventromedial portion of the somite is induced to form the sclerotome, which gives rise to the axial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs). The remaining dorsal portion, the dermomyotome, further differentiates into the myotome (skeletal muscle) and the dermatome (dermis of the back). This patterning is orchestrated by signaling gradients from surrounding tissues.\n\nNormally, the notochord and floor plate of the neural tube, located ventrally to the somite, secrete Sonic hedgehog (Shh), creating a high concentration of Shh ventrally that decreases dorsally. Conversely, the dorsal neural tube and surface ectoderm secrete proteins from the Wnt family and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family, respectively, establishing high concentrations of these signals dorsally. The sclerotome is specified by high Shh concentrations, which induce the expression of the transcription factor Pax1. The myotome requires a combination of Wnt signals and intermediate-to-low Shh signals. The dermatome is specified primarily by dorsal signals in a low-Shh environment.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mouse model where a mutation causes the notochord and floor plate to hyper-secrete Shh, and the extracellular matrix has a reduced ability to bind and sequester it. The net effect is that the normal ventral-to-dorsal gradient of Shh is eliminated. Instead, all cells throughout the entire somite, from the most ventral to the most dorsal aspect, experience a uniformly high concentration of Shh, equivalent to that normally found only in the ventromedial region. The Wnt and BMP signaling gradients from the dorsal tissues remain intact.\n\nBased on these signaling interactions, what is the most likely fate of the cells in the dorsal region of the somite that would normally form the dermomyotome?\n\nA. The cells will differentiate into sclerotome tissue.\n\nB. The cells will differentiate into myotome tissue.\n\nC. The cells will differentiate into dermatome tissue.\n\nD. The cells will fail to differentiate and undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nE. The cells will form a disorganized, mixed tissue containing both myotome and sclerotome cell types.", "solution": "Identify the normal signaling-to-fate rules given:\n- High Shh from notochord/floor plate specifies sclerotome by inducing Pax1.\n- Myotome requires Wnt signals together with intermediate-to-low Shh.\n- Dermatome requires dorsal Wnt/BMP signals in a low-Shh environment.\n\nFormalize the fate conditions in terms of Shh level $S$ and dorsal signals $D$ (Wnt/BMP):\n- If $S$ is high $\\Rightarrow$ Pax1 induced $\\Rightarrow$ sclerotome.\n- If $D$ is present and $S$ is intermediate-to-low $\\Rightarrow$ myotome.\n- If $D$ is present and $S$ is low $\\Rightarrow$ dermatome.\n\nApply the mutant condition: Shh becomes spatially uniform at a high level throughout the somite, i.e., for all positions $x$ within the somite, $S(x)=S_{\\text{high}}$. The dorsal Wnt/BMP gradients remain intact, so $D$ is still high dorsally.\n\nEvaluate dorsal dermomyotome fate under $S(x)=S_{\\text{high}}$ and dorsal $D$:\n- The condition for sclerotome (high $S$) is satisfied; Pax1 is induced in dorsal cells.\n- The condition for myotome (Wnt with intermediate-to-low $S$) is not satisfied because $S$ is high.\n- The condition for dermatome (dorsal signals with low $S$) is not satisfied because $S$ is high.\n\nTherefore, dorsal dermomyotome cells are ventralized and adopt sclerotome identity. Apoptosis is not predicted by the provided rules, and a disorganized mixture is unlikely given the dominant instructive effect of uniformly high Shh inducing Pax1 and sclerotome fate throughout.\n\nHence, the most likely fate of dorsal somite cells is sclerotome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1680426"}, {"introduction": "Once cells are assigned a fate, their journey is far from over; they must migrate and organize to form functional tissues and organs. This practice focuses on this morphogenetic process, connecting the specified sclerotome cells to their final anatomical destinations. By tracing the paths of different sclerotome populations, you will learn how distinct parts of a single vertebra, such as the neural arch and the vertebral body, arise from coordinated cell movements, linking the cellular level to gross anatomy [@problem_id:1680469].", "problem": "In vertebrate development, the paraxial mesoderm segments into blocks of tissue called somites. Each somite subsequently differentiates into three primary components: the sclerotome, the myotome, and the dermatome. The cells of the sclerotome are fated to form the axial skeleton, which includes the vertebrae and ribs. To do this, sclerotome cells lose their epithelial character and migrate as mesenchymal cells to surround the central nervous system and the notochord. This migration occurs in distinct streams. One major population of sclerotome cells migrates dorsally, positioning themselves around the neural tube. A second major population migrates ventrally, to surround the notochord.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately identifies the primary skeletal structures formed by the dorsally-migrating and ventrally-migrating sclerotome cell populations, respectively?\n\nA. Dorsal migration forms the ribs; ventral migration forms the vertebral body.\n\nB. Dorsal migration forms the neural arch of the vertebra; ventral migration forms the vertebral body (centrum).\n\nC. Dorsal migration forms the vertebral body (centrum); ventral migration forms the neural arch of the vertebra.\n\nD. Dorsal migration forms the epaxial muscles of the back; ventral migration forms the sternum.\n\nE. Dorsal migration forms the anulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc; ventral migration forms the nucleus pulposus.", "solution": "We start from the developmental principle that somites differentiate into sclerotome, myotome, and dermatome. The sclerotome gives rise to the axial skeleton, including vertebrae and ribs. During resegmentation and morphogenesis of the vertebrae, sclerotome cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migrate in distinct streams.\n\nKey anatomic mapping of migration to skeletal derivatives:\n- Dorsally migrating sclerotome cells move around the neural tube and form the neural arch of the vertebra, which includes structures such as the pedicles, laminae, spinous processes, and transverse processes.\n- Ventrally migrating sclerotome cells move around the notochord and contribute to the vertebral body (centrum) and the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc; the nucleus pulposus derives from the notochord itself, not from sclerotome.\n\nUsing these principles, we evaluate the options:\n- Option A: Dorsal migration forming ribs is inaccurate; ribs develop from costal processes of thoracic vertebrae derived from sclerotome but are not the primary product of the dorsal stream around the neural tube. Ventrally forming the vertebral body is correct, but the dorsal assignment is incorrect.\n- Option B: Dorsal migration forms the neural arch; ventral migration forms the vertebral body (centrum). This matches the established mapping and is correct.\n- Option C: This reverses the correct mapping and is incorrect.\n- Option D: Epaxial muscles arise from the myotome, not the sclerotome; the sternum arises from somatic lateral plate mesoderm, not sclerotome. Incorrect.\n- Option E: The annulus fibrosus is sclerotome-derived but from the ventral pathway around the notochord, not the dorsal pathway; the nucleus pulposus is not sclerotome-derived but from the notochord. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the accurate identification is that dorsally migrating sclerotome forms the neural arch, and ventrally migrating sclerotome forms the vertebral body (centrum).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1680469"}]}
