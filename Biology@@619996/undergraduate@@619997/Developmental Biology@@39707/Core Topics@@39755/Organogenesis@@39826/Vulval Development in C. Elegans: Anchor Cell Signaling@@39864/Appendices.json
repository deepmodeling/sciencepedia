This is where conditional mutations, like temperature-sensitive alleles, become invaluable tools for geneticists. This practice problem [@problem_id:1731989] asks you to analyze a hypothetical scenario involving a temperature-sensitive mutation in the *mpk-1* gene, which encodes a key MAP Kinase. By connecting the observed phenotype at different temperatures to the molecular behavior of the protein, you can solidify your understanding of how a single component's integrity is critical for the entire signaling cascade and for proper cell fate specification.", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the development of the vulva is a classic model for understanding intercellular signaling. The process is initiated by a single cell, the Anchor Cell (AC), which secretes an inductive signal, a protein of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family. This signal is received by neighboring Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs), which transduce the signal internally through a Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Proper activation of this cascade is essential for the VPCs to adopt primary ($1^\\circ$) and secondary ($2^\\circ$) vulval fates. If this signaling is absent or blocked, the VPCs adopt a default tertiary ($3^\\circ$) fate, becoming part of the skin, which results in a \"Vulvaless\" phenotype where no vulva is formed.\n\nAn investigator is studying a *C. elegans* strain that has a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the *mpk-1* gene, which encodes the central MAPK protein of this pathway. When the worms are raised at a permissive temperature of 15°C, they develop a normal vulva. However, when raised at a restrictive temperature of 25°C, they are all Vulvaless.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for this temperature-dependent observation?\n\nA. At 25°C, the Anchor Cell is unstable and cannot produce the EGF inductive signal, while at 15°C, it functions normally.\n\nB. At 25°C, the mutant MPK-1 protein is hyperactive, causing the VPCs to adopt the $3^\\circ$ fate through negative feedback.\n\nC. At 25°C, the transcription of the *mpk-1* gene is inhibited, so no MPK-1 protein is produced in the VPCs.\n\nD. At 25°C, the mutant MPK-1 protein is misfolded and non-functional, preventing the VPCs from responding to the inductive signal and causing them to adopt the default $3^\\circ$ fate.\n\nE. At 25°C, the VPCs fail to migrate to the correct position and are therefore too far from the Anchor Cell to receive the inductive signal.", "solution": "The phenotype described is classic for a temperature-sensitive loss-of-function allele in a signaling pathway component. A temperature-sensitive mutation typically yields a protein that folds into a functional conformation at a permissive temperature and becomes unstable or misfolded at a restrictive temperature. The gene in question, *mpk-1*, encodes the MAPK ortholog that is essential in the Ras/MAPK cascade downstream of the Anchor Cell’s EGF signal. In the VPCs, MAPK activity is required to transduce the inductive cue and specify $1^\\circ$ and $2^\\circ$ vulval fates; without MAPK function, VPCs default to the $3^\\circ$ fate, producing a Vulvaless phenotype.\n\nAt $15^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (permissive), the mutant MPK-1 protein retains proper folding and function, allowing normal signaling and vulval development. At $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (restrictive), the mutant protein becomes misfolded and non-functional, blocking the cascade even though the inductive EGF signal is present, so VPCs adopt the default $3^\\circ$ fate and no vulva forms. This directly corresponds to choice D.\n\nWhy the other options are not correct:\n- A incorrectly attributes the defect to the Anchor Cell’s ability to produce EGF. The mutation is in *mpk-1* (MAPK) and thus specifically affects the response to signal in VPCs, not production of the signal by the Anchor Cell.\n- B proposes hyperactivity of MPK-1 at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which would be expected to increase induction and could cause a Multivulva phenotype, not a Vulvaless phenotype. The observed phenotype is consistent with loss, not gain, of function.\n- C suggests transcriptional inhibition of *mpk-1* at high temperature. Temperature-sensitive alleles classically affect protein folding/stability or activity, not gene transcription, and the allele is described as a point mutation in the coding gene, not a regulatory change.\n- E invokes VPC migration failure; however, VPCs do not rely on large-scale migration to receive the AC signal for vulval induction. The core defect here is in signal transduction within VPCs due to loss of MPK-1 function, not spatial positioning relative to the AC.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that at the restrictive temperature the mutant MAPK protein is misfolded and non-functional, preventing VPCs from transducing the EGF signal and causing default $3^\\circ$ fates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1731989"}, {"introduction": "Once scientists identify multiple genes involved in a biological process, the next critical step is to determine the order in which they function. This thought experiment introduces you to epistasis analysis, a powerful genetic method used to build signaling pathways. By predicting the phenotype of a double mutant carrying mutations in both the Ras homolog (*let-60*) and the MAP Kinase gene (*mpk-1*), you will use genetic logic to determine which component acts upstream of the other [@problem_id:1731994].", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the development of the vulva is a classic model for understanding intercellular signaling. Six Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs) on the ventral side of the hermaphrodite can adopt one of three fates. The primary ($1^\\circ$) and secondary ($2^\\circ$) fates contribute to the formation of the vulva, while the tertiary ($3^\\circ$) fate results in the cell becoming part of the surrounding skin (hypodermis). A normal vulva requires a specific combination of $1^\\circ$ and $2^\\circ$ cell fates. If all VPCs adopt the $3^\\circ$ fate, no vulva is formed, a phenotype known as **Vulvaless (Vul)**. If too many VPCs adopt $1^\\circ$ or $2^\\circ$ fates, multiple pseudo-vulvas are formed, a phenotype called **Multivulva (Muv)**.\n\nThis fate decision is controlled by a signal transduction pathway. Two key proteins in this pathway are LET-60, a Ras GTPase, and MPK-1, a Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase. In the wild-type pathway, the activation of LET-60 is a necessary preceding step for the activation of MPK-1, which in turn promotes the $1^\\circ$ and $2^\\circ$ vulval fates.\n\nExperiments have characterized the phenotypes of single mutations:\n1.  A gain-of-function mutation in the *let-60* gene produces a constitutively active LET-60 protein that is always signaling, regardless of upstream cues. Worms with this mutation exhibit the Muv phenotype.\n2.  A loss-of-function mutation in the *mpk-1* gene produces a non-functional MPK-1 protein. Worms with this mutation exhibit the Vul phenotype.\n\nConsider a geneticist who creates a double-mutant worm that possesses both the constitutively active *let-60* allele and the non-functional *mpk-1* allele.

Excess pathway output yields the Muv phenotype, while absent output yields the Vul phenotype.\n\nFor the single mutants:\n- Constitutively active *let-60(gf)* sets LET-60 to an active state independent of upstream cues, which in a wild-type downstream context drives MPK-1 activation and produces Muv.\n- Loss-of-function *mpk-1(lf)* sets MPK-1=0 (nonfunctional), abolishing pathway output and producing Vul.\n\nFor the double mutant *let-60(gf); mpk-1(lf)*, the upstream component LET-60 is active, but the downstream effector MPK-1 is nonfunctional. Since the output that specifies $1^\\circ/2^\\circ$ fates requires MPK-1 activity, the absence of functional MPK-1 blocks signaling to the fate decision regardless of LET-60 status:\n$$MPK\\text{-}1=0 \\implies \\text{no activation of }1^\\circ/2^\\circ\\text{ fates} \\implies \\text{Vul}.$$\nThus the downstream loss-of-function is epistatic to the upstream gain-of-function, and the double mutant exhibits the Vul phenotype.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1731994"}, {"introduction": "Cellular decisions are often the result of integrating multiple different signals, not just following a single linear command. This final practice moves beyond a simple cascade to explore the interplay between the primary inductive pathway (mediated by the LET-23 receptor) and the lateral signaling pathway (mediated by the LIN-12 receptor). By dissecting the outcome in a double mutant [@problem_id:1731996], you will need to determine which pathway's output is dominant, revealing the hierarchical logic that governs the final pattern of vulval cell fates.", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the development of the vulva provides a classic model for studying cell fate specification through intercellular signaling. Vulval formation is initiated by an inductive signal from a single gonadal cell, the anchor cell, to an equivalence group of six underlying epidermal cells known as Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs), labeled P3.p through P8.p.\n\nIn a wild-type animal, the anchor cell secretes an Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) homolog, the LIN-3 protein. The VPC closest to the anchor cell, P6.p, receives the highest concentration of LIN-3. This ligand binds to the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase on the P6.p cell surface, inducing it to adopt a primary ($1^\\circ$) cell fate. The newly specified $1^\\circ$ cell then produces a different signal that activates the LIN-12 receptor (a Notch family homolog) on its immediate neighbors, P5.p and P7.p. This lateral signaling cascade induces them to adopt a secondary ($2^\\circ$) cell fate. The three remaining VPCs (P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p) receive insufficient signaling and adopt their default tertiary ($3^\\circ$) fate, becoming part of the hypodermis. The progeny of the cells with $1^\\circ$ and $2^\\circ$ fates together form a single, functional vulva.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of *C. elegans* that is a double mutant. This strain carries two specific mutations affecting all VPCs:\n1.  A loss-of-function mutation in the *let-23* gene, resulting in a completely non-functional LET-23 receptor protein. A single *let-23* loss-of-function mutant is known to be Vulvaless (no vulva forms).\n2.  A gain-of-function mutation in the *lin-12* gene, resulting in a constitutively active LIN-12 receptor protein that signals continuously, even in the absence of a ligand. A single *lin-12* gain-of-function mutant is known to have a Multivulva phenotype (multiple vulval structures form).\n\nBased on your understanding of these signaling pathways, predict the vulval phenotype of this double mutant worm.\n\nA. Wild-type (a single, normal vulva is formed)\n\nB. Vulvaless (no vulva is formed)\n\nC. Multivulva (multiple vulva-like structures are formed)\n\nD.

A single, abnormal vulva formed only from $2^\\circ$ fate cells", "solution": "- The inductive pathway: The anchor cell secretes LIN-3 (EGF homolog), which binds LET-23 (RTK) on VPCs. High LET-23 activation in the nearest VPC (normally P6.p) specifies primary ($1^\\circ$) fate. The $1^\\circ$ cell produces a lateral signal that activates LIN-12 (Notch) in neighboring VPCs, specifying secondary ($2^\\circ$) fate. Cells without sufficient signaling adopt tertiary ($3^\\circ$) fate. In a *let-23* loss-of-function, no VPC can receive RTK signaling, so no $1^\\circ$ fate forms and no lateral signaling occurs; all VPCs default to $3^\\circ$, yielding a Vulvaless phenotype.\n\n- The lateral pathway: LIN-12 activation is sufficient to specify $2^\\circ$ fate in VPCs. In a *lin-12* gain-of-function, LIN-12 is constitutively active in VPCs, causing them to adopt $2^\\circ$ fate even without ligand from a $1^\\circ$ neighbor; as stated, this yields a Multivulva phenotype.\n\n- Double mutant logic:\n  1. *let-23* loss-of-function eliminates RTK-mediated $1^\\circ$ induction everywhere; no $1^\\circ$ cell forms and no endogenous lateral signal is produced.\n  2. *lin-12* gain-of-function constitutively activates Notch in all VPCs, bypassing the need for lateral ligand from a $1^\\circ$ cell and directly imposing $2^\\circ$ fate.\n  3. Therefore, despite the absence of RTK signaling, widespread constitutive LIN-12 activity specifies $2^\\circ$ fate across multiple (indeed all) VPCs.\n\n- Phenotypic prediction and exclusion of alternatives:\n  - Not wild-type, because RTK induction is absent and LIN-12 is misactivated.\n  - Not Vulvaless, because *lin-12(gf)* drives $2^\\circ$ fate without RTK or ligand.\n  - Not lethal, as these mutations restricted to VPCs affect vulval patterning, not viability.\n  - Not a single, abnormal vulva formed only from $2^\\circ$ cells, because *lin-12(gf)* acts in all VPCs, producing multiple $2^\\circ$ fates and thus multiple vulva-like structures.\n  - Thus, the phenotype matches Multivulva.\n\nConclusion: In the double mutant, constitutive LIN-12 activity is epistatic to *let-23* loss for the specification of $2^\\circ$ fate, producing multiple vulva-like structures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1731996"}]}
