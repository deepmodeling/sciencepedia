{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "For an axon to navigate its complex environment, its leading edge, the growth cone, must be highly motile. This motility is not random; it is powered by the constant and dynamic remodeling of an internal protein scaffold. This exercise [@problem_id:1672395] explores the fundamental role of the actin cytoskeleton, the engine driving the growth cone's exploratory protrusions. By predicting the consequences of pharmacologically halting actin polymerization, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how this dynamic instability is essential for forward movement.", "problem": "In an in vitro experiment, a neuron from the dorsal root ganglion is cultured on a laminin-coated substrate, allowing it to extend an axon tipped with a motile growth cone. The growth cone is actively exploring its environment, characterized by dynamic, sheet-like extensions called lamellipodia and thin, finger-like protrusions called filopodia. A researcher introduces a novel synthetic drug, \"Inhibactin,\" to the culture medium. This drug is highly specific and functions solely by binding to actin monomers, preventing them from being added to the plus end of existing actin filaments. Assuming the drug quickly permeates the cell, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most immediate consequence for the growth cone's structure and behavior?\n\nA. The growth cone will lose its ability to transport mitochondria and vesicles to the leading edge, but its overall shape and motility will remain unchanged.\n\nB. The growth cone will become rigid, freezing its lamellipodia and filopodia in their exact positions at the moment of drug application.\n\nC. The central core of the growth cone, which is rich in microtubules, will rapidly depolymerize, causing the axon shaft to retract.\n\nD. The lamellipodia and filopodia will collapse, and the growth cone will cease its forward exploratory movement.", "solution": "The lamellipodia and filopodia of a growth cone are actin-based protrusions that require continuous actin polymerization at the barbed (plus) ends to push the membrane forward. The fundamental kinetic description of actin dynamics at a filament end is\n$$\nv_{+} = a\\left(k_{on}^{+}[G] - k_{off}^{+}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v_{-} = a\\left(k_{off}^{-} - k_{on}^{-}[G]\\right),\n$$\nwhere $v_{+}$ is the barbed-end elongation velocity, $v_{-}$ is the pointed-end shrinkage velocity (taken positive when the filament shortens from that end), $a$ is the monomer axial increment per subunit added, $k_{on}^{\\pm}$ and $k_{off}^{\\pm}$ are the on/off rate constants at the plus and minus ends, and $[G]$ is the concentration of free actin monomer. In steady protrusion, lamellipodial advance requires $v_{+}$ to exceed the retrograde flow velocity $v_{retro}$:\n$$\nv_{prot} = v_{+} - v_{retro} > 0.\n$$\nThe drug Inhibactin binds actin monomers and prevents their addition specifically at the plus end. Functionally, this sets the effective plus-end addition term to zero, so $k_{on}^{+}[G] \\to 0$ at the barbed end. Immediately after drug application,\n$$\nv_{+} \\to a\\left(0 - k_{off}^{+}\\right) = -a\\,k_{off}^{+} < 0,\n$$\nso the barbed end shortens. The pointed end typically continues to depolymerize under physiological conditions, with\n$$\nv_{-} = a\\left(k_{off}^{-} - k_{on}^{-}[G]\\right) > 0,\n$$\nand the net filament length change is\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = v_{+} - v_{-} < 0.\n$$\nThus, F-actin networks in lamellipodia and bundles in filopodia rapidly lose length and integrity. Because membrane protrusion requires $v_{prot} = v_{+} - v_{retro}$ and $v_{+}$ becomes negative, $v_{prot}$ becomes negative, leading to retraction rather than protrusion. Consequently, the lamellipodia and filopodia collapse and exploratory forward movement ceases.\n\nThis effect is immediate and primary because it follows directly from blocking plus-end actin addition, which is the rate-limiting step for protrusion. In contrast:\n- Option A is incorrect because anterograde transport of mitochondria and vesicles primarily depends on microtubules and motor proteins; actin inhibition does not primarily abolish their transport, and the growth cone shape would not remain unchanged.\n- Option B is incorrect because inhibiting polymerization does not rigidify or freeze structures; continuous turnover is required to maintain them, and without plus-end addition, they collapse due to ongoing depolymerization and retrograde flow.\n- Option C is incorrect because Inhibactin targets actin monomers; microtubules (in the central domain) are not the primary target and do not rapidly depolymerize as a direct and immediate effect.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most immediate consequence is collapse of lamellipodia and filopodia with cessation of forward exploratory movement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1672395"}, {"introduction": "While the cytoskeleton provides the power for movement, the growth cone relies on external chemical signals for its sense of direction. This problem [@problem_id:1672405] delves into one of the most well-studied chemoattraction systems, the Netrin-DCC pathway, which guides developing axons toward their targets. By analyzing a scenario where this critical guidance receptor is blocked, you will reason through the fundamental logic of how a growth cone \"reads\" a chemical map and translates it into directed growth.", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate spinal cord, commissural neurons extend their axons towards the ventral midline. This directed growth is guided by a gradient of a secreted protein, Netrin, which is produced by cells in the floor plate at the ventral midline. The growth cones of commissural axons express the receptor protein Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC), which binds to Netrin. This binding event initiates an intracellular signaling cascade that results in chemoattraction, causing the axon to grow up the concentration gradient towards the Netrin source.\n\nConsider an *in vitro* experiment where a small piece of tissue containing commissural neurons is cultured in a dish. A separate cluster of cells engineered to secrete Netrin is placed at a distance from the neural tissue, establishing a stable concentration gradient. A specific function-blocking antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the DCC receptor, preventing Netrin from binding, is then added to the culture medium.\n\nBased on your understanding of axon guidance mechanisms, which of the following outcomes best describes the general pattern of axon outgrowth from the commissural neurons in the presence of the DCC-blocking antibody?\n\nA. The axons will grow in a highly directed manner toward the Netrin-secreting cell cluster.\n\nB. The axons will be strongly repelled and grow directly away from the Netrin-secreting cell cluster.\n\nC. The axons will still grow, but their direction of outgrowth will be random and undirected with respect to the Netrin source.\n\nD. The commissural neurons will be unable to extend axons and will rapidly undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nE. The axons will extend and then immediately retract upon entering the Netrin gradient.", "solution": "The key principle of commissural axon guidance is that Netrin secreted from the ventral midline acts as a chemoattractant through the receptor DCC on growth cones. Ligand binding to DCC initiates intracellular signaling that biases cytoskeletal dynamics to turn and extend up the Netrin concentration gradient, producing directed growth toward the source.\n\nIn the described in vitro assay, a stable Netrin gradient is provided by a secreting cell cluster. Addition of a function-blocking antibody against the extracellular domain of DCC prevents Netrin from binding DCC and thereby prevents initiation of the DCC-dependent chemoattractive signaling cascade. Thus, the directional bias toward the Netrin source is specifically abolished.\n\nBlocking DCC does not, in general, abolish the intrinsic capacity of neurons to extend axons, because basal neurite extension relies on intracellular cytoskeletal machinery and substrate adhesion cues that are not contingent on DCC-Netrin binding. Therefore, axons can still grow but will lack Netrin-dependent directional guidance. Strong repulsion away from the source would require repulsive Netrin signaling, typically mediated by UNC5 family receptors, which is not implicated here; moreover, the question asks for the general pattern for commissural neurons, which primarily rely on DCC-mediated attraction before midline crossing. Immediate retraction upon entering the gradient is not expected when the attractive pathway is blocked; nor does DCC blockade cause rapid apoptosis of these neurons in standard culture conditions.\n\nTherefore, in the presence of the DCC-blocking antibody, axons will extend but display random, undirected growth with respect to the Netrin source.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because DCC blockade abolishes Netrin-mediated attraction.\n- B is incorrect because repulsion is not expected without repulsive Netrin signaling pathways engaged.\n- C is correct because growth continues but lacks directional bias toward Netrin.\n- D is incorrect because axon extension and survival do not require DCC-Netrin binding under these conditions.\n- E is incorrect because blockade of attraction does not cause immediate retraction in the gradient.\n\nThus, the best description is random, undirected outgrowth relative to the Netrin source.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1672405"}, {"introduction": "Effective navigation requires avoiding obstacles as much as seeking targets, meaning repulsive cues are just as critical as attractive ones. This practice [@problem_id:1672337] puts you in the role of a researcher interpreting data from a \"growth cone collapse assay,\" a cornerstone technique for identifying such repulsive signals. You will learn to analyze experimental results not only to identify a repulsive molecule but also to place it within a downstream signaling pathway, revealing how scientists dissect these complex molecular interactions.", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is investigating the molecular mechanisms of axon guidance in the peripheral nervous system. The researcher cultures dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on a substrate and allows them to extend axons. The goal is to identify novel repulsive guidance cues. To do this, they perform a series of growth cone collapse assays using three purified molecules of interest: Molecule A, Molecule B, and Molecule C. Molecule C is a known intracellular kinase. The experiment consists of four conditions, and the percentage of growth cones exhibiting a collapsed morphology (defined as a loss of lamellipodia and filopodia) is quantified after a 30-minute incubation.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Control Condition:** Neurons are incubated in the standard culture medium. Result: 11% of growth cones are collapsed.\n2.  **Molecule A Condition:** The culture medium is supplemented with Molecule A. Result: 87% of growth cones are collapsed.\n3.  **Molecule B Condition:** The culture medium is supplemented with Molecule B. Result: 13% of growth cones are collapsed.\n4.  **Inhibitor Condition:** The culture medium is supplemented with both Molecule A and a specific pharmacological inhibitor of Molecule C's kinase activity. Result: 15% of growth cones are collapsed.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. Molecule C is the cell-surface receptor for the repulsive cue Molecule A.\n\nB. Molecule B is an attractive guidance cue for DRG neurons.\n\nC. Both Molecule A and Molecule B are repulsive guidance cues, but Molecule A is more potent.\n\nD. Molecule A is a repulsive guidance cue whose downstream signaling pathway requires the kinase activity of Molecule C.\n\nE. The high level of collapse in the presence of Molecule A is a toxic artifact, and Molecule A is not a true guidance cue.", "solution": "We interpret growth cone collapse assays based on the principle that repulsive guidance cues increase the fraction of growth cones exhibiting collapsed morphology, whereas attractive cues tend to stabilize or promote protrusive structures and thus reduce collapse relative to baseline. The baseline (control) collapse fraction provides the reference level for spontaneous collapse in culture.\n\nFirst, establish the baseline: in the control condition the collapse fraction is $0.11$. This represents the spontaneous collapse without added cues.\n\nSecond, evaluate Molecule A: with Molecule A, the collapse fraction increases to $0.87$, which is a large elevation relative to $0.11$. By the operational definition of the assay, this strong increase is consistent with Molecule A acting as a repulsive guidance cue.\n\nThird, evaluate Molecule B: with Molecule B, the collapse fraction is $0.13$, which is approximately equal to the control value $0.11$. This indicates that Molecule B does not produce a significant repulsive effect. It also does not show evidence of being attractive in this assay, because an attractive cue would be expected to reduce collapse below baseline rather than remain at baseline levels.\n\nFourth, test pathway dependence using the inhibitor of Molecule C’s kinase activity: when Molecule A is applied together with the specific inhibitor of Molecule C kinase activity, the collapse fraction is $0.15$, which is close to the control $0.11$ and dramatically reduced from $0.87$. The most direct interpretation is that the repulsive effect of Molecule A requires the kinase activity of Molecule C; inhibiting Molecule C prevents A-induced collapse. This pattern indicates pathway specificity rather than nonspecific toxicity: were Molecule A merely toxic, a specific kinase inhibitor of Molecule C would not be expected to rescue the phenotype to near-baseline levels.\n\nFifth, assess each statement:\n- Statement A is not supported: Molecule C is stated to be an intracellular kinase, not a cell-surface receptor; the data indicate a requirement for its kinase activity downstream, not that it is the receptor for Molecule A.\n- Statement B is not supported: Molecule B does not reduce collapse below baseline; it appears inert in this assay rather than attractive.\n- Statement C is false: Molecule B does not increase collapse above baseline, so it is not repulsive.\n- Statement D matches the observed rescue: Molecule A is repulsive, and its effect depends on Molecule C’s kinase activity.\n- Statement E is inconsistent with the inhibitor rescue: specific blockade of Molecule C reversing the effect argues against a nonspecific toxic artifact.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Molecule A is a repulsive guidance cue whose downstream signaling requires the kinase activity of Molecule C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1672337"}]}
