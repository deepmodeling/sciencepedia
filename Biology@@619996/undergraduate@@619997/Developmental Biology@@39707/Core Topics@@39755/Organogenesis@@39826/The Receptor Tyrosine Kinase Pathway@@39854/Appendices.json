By considering a mutant receptor that completely lacks this domain, you can explore why this component is indispensable for initiating a cellular response.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, researchers are investigating a signal transduction pathway crucial for embryonic cell proliferation. This pathway is initiated by a specific growth factor that binds to a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). The standard activation mechanism involves the growth factor binding to the extracellular domain of two separate RTK monomers, inducing them to form a dimer. This dimerization brings their intracellular kinase domains into close proximity, leading to their activation via trans-autophosphorylation, which subsequently triggers a downstream signaling cascade promoting cell division.\n\nTo probe this mechanism, the researchers engineer a stable cell line that expresses a mutant form of this RTK. This mutant receptor is identical to the wild-type version in its transmembrane and intracellular kinase domains, but it completely lacks the extracellular ligand-binding domain. These engineered cells are cultured in a serum-free medium devoid of any growth factors, ensuring a quiescent basal state. The experiment consists of adding a high concentration of the specific growth factor to the culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately predicts the state of the downstream signaling cascade in the engineered cells immediately following the addition of the growth factor?\n\nA. The pathway will become constitutively active at a high level, irrespective of the growth factor's presence.\n\nB. The pathway will be strongly activated, but only upon the addition of the growth factor.\n\nC. The pathway will remain at its basal, inactive level, showing no response to the growth factor.\n\nD. The pathway will be actively repressed, resulting in a signaling level lower than the initial basal state.\n\nE. The pathway will be weakly activated upon growth factor addition, reaching approximately half the level seen in wild-type cells.", "solution": "The canonical activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) requires ligand-induced dimerization of two monomeric receptors via their extracellular ligand-binding domains, followed by juxtaposition of the intracellular kinase domains and trans-autophosphorylation. Symbolically, for wild-type receptor $R$ and ligand $L$, the ligand-driven dimerization can be represented as:\n$$L + 2R \\to R\\text{-}L\\text{-}R \\to R_{2}^{\\ast},$$\nwhere $R_{2}^{\\ast}$ denotes the active, phosphorylated dimer. The essential prerequisite is formation of a ligand-receptor complex via the extracellular domain with finite affinity (finite $K_{D}$), enabling the dimerization step.\n\nIn the engineered cells, the receptor $R^{\\Delta ECD}$ lacks the extracellular ligand-binding domain, while the transmembrane and kinase domains are intact. The absence of the extracellular domain implies:\n$$L + R^{\\Delta ECD} \\not\\rightleftharpoons \\text{complex}, \\quad \\text{effectively } K_{D} \\to \\infty,$$\nso ligand binding cannot occur, and therefore ligand-induced dimerization cannot be driven:\n$$L + 2R^{\\Delta ECD} \\not\\to (R^{\\Delta ECD})_{2} \\text{ via ligand}.$$\nWithout ligand-induced dimerization, the intracellular kinase domains are not brought into the correct configuration to undergo trans-autophosphorylation, so no activation signal is generated downstream.\n\nThe problem additionally specifies that cells are maintained in serum-free medium to ensure a quiescent basal state prior to ligand addition, indicating that the mutant receptor is not constitutively active under these conditions. Immediately after adding ligand, because $R^{\\Delta ECD}$ cannot bind the ligand, the number of activated dimers remains at its basal value (approximately zero relative to wild-type ligand response), and the downstream signaling cascade remains at its basal, inactive level.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the pathway shows no response to the growth factor in these engineered cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1726077"}, {"introduction": "Receptor Tyrosine Kinases are excellent examples of modular proteins, where different parts, or domains, perform distinct jobs. This practice problem [@problem_id:1726060] leverages this modularity through a classic \"domain swap\" thought experiment, creating a chimeric receptor from two different RTKs. This allows us to dissect the flow of information and determine whether the identity of the ligand or the nature of the intracellular kinase domain dictates the cell's ultimate fate.", "problem": "In a developmental biology experiment, researchers are investigating the modular nature of cell surface receptors. They focus on two distinct Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathways: the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) pathway and the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. In a standard RTK, the extracellular domain is responsible for binding a specific ligand, and the intracellular domain possesses tyrosine kinase activity that, upon ligand binding, initiates a specific downstream signaling cascade.\n\nThe researchers use a line of cultured progenitor cells that are known to rely on the FGF signaling pathway for their differentiation. These cells possess all the necessary downstream intracellular proteins for the FGF pathway but lack the components for the EGF pathway. To test the functional independence of receptor domains, they genetically engineer these cells to express a chimeric receptor. This engineered receptor consists of the complete extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human EGF receptor fused to the complete transmembrane and intracellular domains of the human FGF receptor. The cells' native FGF receptors are not expressed.\n\nThe modified cells are cultured in a serum-free medium. What outcome is expected when Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is added to the culture medium?\n\nA. The cells will not show any response because they lack the intracellular machinery for the EGF signaling pathway.\n\nB. The cells will undergo differentiation by activating the FGF signaling pathway.\n\nC. The cells will not show any response because EGF cannot bind to a receptor that has an FGF intracellular domain.\n\nD. The cells will undergo an apoptotic response due to conflicting signals from the chimeric receptor.\n\nE. The cells will activate the EGF signaling pathway, but no differentiation will occur.", "solution": "The key principle is the modular organization of receptor tyrosine kinases: the extracellular domain dictates ligand specificity (which ligand can bind), while the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain dictates the downstream signaling cascade by providing specific phosphotyrosine motifs that recruit pathway-specific adaptor and effector proteins. Thus, ligand recognition and signal specification are separable functions of different receptor domains.\n\nGiven cells that possess the downstream intracellular machinery for FGF signaling but lack the machinery for EGF signaling, and given that their native FGFRs are not expressed, the experiment introduces a chimeric RTK in which:\n- The extracellular domain is from the EGF receptor and therefore specifically binds EGF.\n- The transmembrane and intracellular domains are from the FGF receptor and therefore, upon activation, present FGFR-typical phosphotyrosine motifs and catalytic activity to initiate FGF-specific downstream signaling.\n\nWhen EGF is added in serum-free medium, the following steps occur:\n1. EGF binds the extracellular EGFR ligand-binding domain of the chimeric receptor with specificity determined solely by this domain.\n2. Ligand binding promotes receptor dimerization and activation, leading to trans-autophosphorylation within the intracellular FGFR kinase domains.\n3. The phosphorylated intracellular domain provides FGFR-typical docking sites that recruit FGF pathway adaptors and effectors (for example, FRS2 and associated complexes), initiating the canonical FGF signaling cascade (including Ras-MAPK and related branches characteristic of FGFR signaling).\n4. Because the cells possess the FGF downstream machinery required for differentiation, activation of this pathway results in the expected FGF-driven differentiation response.\n5. The absence of native FGFRs does not prevent signaling, because the chimeric receptor itself supplies the necessary FGFR intracellular domain and its phosphorylation sites. The lack of EGF pathway components is irrelevant, because the intracellular domain is not EGFR-derived and will not attempt to recruit EGF-specific intracellular machinery.\n\nTherefore, EGF acts as the activating ligand that, through the chimeric receptor, triggers FGF-type intracellular signaling, leading to differentiation. This matches option B and rules out:\n- A, because signaling is specified by the intracellular FGFR domain, not by EGF machinery.\n- C, because ligand binding is determined by the extracellular domain, which is EGFR-derived and binds EGF.\n- D, because there is no basis for conflicting signals; only one intracellular specification (FGFR) is present.\n- E, because the EGF pathway is not activated; the FGFR intracellular domain is, and differentiation occurs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1726060"}, {"introduction": "Once an RTK is activated at the cell surface, the signal must be physically transmitted to downstream targets inside the cell. This signal relay is mediated by adaptor proteins that possess specific domains for protein-protein interactions, as demonstrated in this problem [@problem_id:2334985]. By examining a mutant form of the adaptor protein Grb2 with a defective Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, you will gain insight into the molecular mechanism that ensures the signal is passed from the activated receptor to the next component in the cascade.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying a signal transduction pathway initiated by a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). To visualize a key step in this pathway, they engineer a cell line to express a modified version of the adaptor protein Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). This modified Grb2 is fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), allowing its location to be tracked via fluorescence microscopy.\n\nThe engineered cells express a mutant form of Grb2-GFP where the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain has been rendered non-functional, preventing it from binding to its usual targets. The rest of the Grb2 protein, including its Src Homology 3 (SH3) domains, and all other proteins in the cell (including the RTK) are normal (wild-type).\n\nThe biologist observes the cells under the microscope, adds a saturating concentration of the appropriate growth factor to the culture medium, and continues to observe the cells. Which of the following outcomes correctly describes the localization of the mutant Grb2-GFP protein?\n\nA. Before adding the growth factor, Grb2-GFP is diffuse in the cytoplasm. After adding the growth factor, it rapidly translocates and concentrates at the plasma membrane.\n\nB. Before adding the growth factor, Grb2-GFP is already concentrated at the plasma membrane and its location does not change after adding the growth factor.\n\nC. Before adding the growth factor, Grb2-GFP is diffuse in the cytoplasm, and it remains diffuse in the cytoplasm after the growth factor is added.\n\nD. Before adding the growth factor, Grb2-GFP is localized within the nucleus. After adding the growth factor, it moves to the plasma membrane.\n\nE. Before adding the growth factor, Grb2-GFP is diffuse in the cytoplasm. After adding the growth factor, it is degraded by the proteasome.", "solution": "To determine the localization of the mutant Grb2-GFP, we must analyze the sequence of events in a typical Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling pathway and understand the specific role of the Grb2 protein and its domains.\n\nFirst, let's consider the state of the cell before stimulation. In an unstimulated cell, the RTKs are present as inactive monomers in the plasma membrane. The adaptor protein Grb2 is a cytosolic protein. In the absence of an activating signal, there are no specific docking sites for Grb2 at the plasma membrane. Therefore, before the addition of the growth factor, both wild-type Grb2 and the mutant Grb2-GFP would be expected to be diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nNext, let's consider the events after the addition of the growth factor.\n1.  **RTK Activation**: The binding of the growth factor to the extracellular domain of the RTK induces the receptors to dimerize (pair up).\n2.  **Autophosphorylation**: This dimerization brings the intracellular kinase domains of the two receptors into close proximity, allowing them to phosphorylate each other on specific tyrosine residues. This process is called trans-autophosphorylation.\n3.  **Creation of Docking Sites**: The newly created phosphotyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the activated RTK serve as high-affinity binding sites, or docking sites, for various downstream signaling proteins.\n4.  **Recruitment of Grb2**: One such protein is Grb2. A wild-type Grb2 protein contains a single Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain. The function of an SH2 domain is to specifically recognize and bind to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs. This interaction is what recruits Grb2 from the cytoplasm to the activated receptor complex at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.\n\nNow, we must consider the specific mutation in this problem. The Grb2-GFP protein has a non-functional SH2 domain. Although the addition of the growth factor leads to the normal activation and autophosphorylation of the RTK, creating the necessary phosphotyrosine docking sites at the plasma membrane, the mutant Grb2-GFP molecule is unable to recognize or bind to these sites. The very component required for its recruitment to the membrane, the SH2 domain, is defective.\n\nConsequently, despite the presence of an upstream activation signal, the mutant Grb2-GFP cannot be recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. It will remain in its initial state: diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n-   **A** describes the behavior of a wild-type Grb2 protein, which would be successfully recruited to the membrane. This is incorrect for the mutant.\n-   **B** describes a situation where the pathway is constitutively active, causing Grb2 to be at the membrane even without the growth factor. The problem states the RTK is wild-type and requires the growth factor for activation, so this is incorrect.\n-   **C** correctly states that the protein is initially diffuse in the cytoplasm and remains diffuse after stimulation because its non-functional SH2 domain prevents it from binding to the activated RTKs at the plasma membrane. This matches our conclusion.\n-   **D** is incorrect as Grb2 is a cytosolic protein, not a primarily nuclear one in this context.\n-   **E** suggests degradation. While protein misfolding can lead to degradation, a non-functional binding domain does not inherently trigger proteasomal degradation upon pathway activation. This is an unrelated process.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the Grb2-GFP will remain diffuse in the cytoplasm both before and after stimulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334985"}]}
