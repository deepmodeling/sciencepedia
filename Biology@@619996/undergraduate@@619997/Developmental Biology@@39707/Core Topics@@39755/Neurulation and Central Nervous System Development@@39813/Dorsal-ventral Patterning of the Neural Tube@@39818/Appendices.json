A ventral-to-dorsal gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a morphogen secreted by the floor plate and the underlying notochord, specifies ventral neuronal fates, such as motor neurons. Conversely, a dorsal-to-ventral gradient of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), secreted by the roof plate and overlying ectoderm, specifies dorsal neuronal fates, like sensory interneurons. A developmental biologist is studying a new mouse line with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in a single, unknown gene. Embryos from this line exhibit a profound defect in the developing spinal cord: ventral cell types, including motor neurons, fail to differentiate, while dorsal cell types expand to occupy the entire ventral half of the neural tube.\n\nGiven this phenotype, which of the following genes is the most likely candidate for the loss-of-function mutation?\n\nA.

Noggin", "solution": "The dorsal-ventral patterning of the vertebrate neural tube is governed by opposing morphogen gradients:\n- Sonic hedgehog (Shh), secreted by the notochord and floor plate, forms a ventral-to-dorsal gradient that specifies ventral neural identities, including motor neurons.\n- Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), secreted by the roof plate and ectoderm, form a dorsal-to-ventral gradient that specifies dorsal neural identities.\n\nGiven the observed phenotype—loss of ventral cell types (including motor neurons) and expansion of dorsal cell types into ventral territory—the underlying defect must correspond to a loss of ventralizing activity or a gain of dorsalizing activity.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. Sonic hedgehog (Shh): A loss-of-function mutation in Shh abolishes the ventralizing signal, preventing specification of ventral progenitors and motor neurons. In the absence of Shh, dorsal identities expand ventrally. This matches the phenotype exactly and is the canonical outcome of Shh pathway loss in the neural tube.\n- B. Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4): Loss of a dorsalizing cue would reduce dorsal fates and allow ventral fates to expand dorsally, the opposite of the observed phenotype. Therefore, this is inconsistent.\n- C. Patched (Ptc): Patched is the Shh receptor and a negative regulator of Smoothened. Loss-of-function in Patched leads to constitutive activation of the Shh pathway, producing ectopic ventralization and expansion of ventral fates, the opposite of the observed phenotype. Therefore, this is inconsistent.\n- D. Noggin: Noggin antagonizes BMP signaling. Loss of Noggin would increase BMP signaling, which can dorsalize tissue. However, Noggin loss typically causes broad and severe defects in neural induction and patterning rather than a selective neural tube dorsalization phenotype; moreover, the most direct and well-established cause of the neural tube phenotype described—loss of ventral fates with dorsal expansion—is Shh pathway loss. Among the provided choices, Shh loss most precisely and specifically matches the described neural tube phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most likely candidate is a loss-of-function mutation in Shh.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1681773"}, {"introduction": "A signal is only as good as the machinery that interprets it. This next problem homes in on the intracellular components of the Shh pathway, specifically the receptor Patched-1 ($Ptch1$), which actively represses signaling in the absence of Shh. By considering a scenario where this repression is lost, you will explore the concept of constitutive pathway activation and its dramatic effects on cell fate determination [@problem_id:1681769].", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate nervous system, the neural tube is patterned along its dorsal-ventral axis by opposing gradients of signaling molecules. The ventral region is organized by a morphogen called Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is secreted from a structure called the floor plate at the ventral midline. The concentration of Shh protein experienced by a neural progenitor cell determines its fate.\n\nThe Shh signaling pathway involves several key components. In the absence of the Shh ligand, the transmembrane receptor Patched-1 (Ptch1) actively represses another transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo). When Shh binds to Ptch1, this repression is relieved, allowing Smo to become active. Active Smo initiates an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately controls the expression of a set of transcription factors that define different ventral progenitor domains.\n\nNormally, this graded Shh signal establishes distinct domains in the ventral neural tube, each characterized by a unique transcription factor code:\n- **High Shh concentration** (near the floor plate) induces the **p3 progenitor domain**, characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Nkx2.2.\n- **Intermediate Shh concentration** induces the **motor neuron progenitor (pMN) domain**, characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Olig2.\n- **Low or zero Shh concentration** allows for the expression of transcription factors like Pax6, which defines more dorsal progenitor domains.\nThese transcription factors have cross-repressive relationships; for instance, Nkx2.2 expression represses Olig2 expression, and Olig2 expression represses Pax6 expression, creating sharp boundaries between domains.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mouse embryo that possesses a homozygous null mutation in the *Ptch1* gene. This mutation results in a complete absence of functional Ptch1 protein. Based on the signaling logic described, which of the following outcomes would you predict for the ventral progenitor domains in the neural tube of this mutant embryo?\n\nA. All ventral progenitor cells will express Nkx2.2, and the pMN (Olig2-positive) and more dorsal (Pax6-positive) domains will be absent.\n\nB. All ventral progenitor cells will express Pax6, and the p3 (Nkx2.2-positive) and pMN (Olig2-positive) domains will be absent.\n\nC. All ventral progenitor cells will express Olig2, expanding the pMN domain at the expense of the p3 and more dorsal domains.\n\nD. The normal graded pattern of p3, pMN, and more dorsal domains will form, as Shh is still produced by the floor plate.\n\nE. The entire neural tube will adopt a floor plate fate, and no other progenitor domains will form anywhere along the dorsal-ventral axis.", "solution": "We begin from the core logic of Hedgehog signaling in the neural tube. In the absence of ligand, Ptch1 represses Smo activity; upon Shh binding to Ptch1, this repression is relieved and Smo becomes active. Active Smo drives the intracellular cascade that culminates in transcriptional responses interpreted as positional identities: high effective Shh pathway activity induces the p3 domain (Nkx2.2), intermediate induces the pMN domain (Olig2), and low activity allows Pax6 expression in more dorsal fates. Cross-repression among these transcription factors sharpens boundaries, with Nkx2.2 repressing Olig2 and Olig2 repressing Pax6.\n\nIn a Ptch1 homozygous null embryo, there is a complete absence of Ptch1 function. Without Ptch1, the basal repression of Smo is lost, so Smo is constitutively active irrespective of Shh ligand presence. Therefore, every cell that would normally require Shh to relieve Ptch1 repression now experiences continuous Hedgehog pathway activation. Functionally, this mimics at least a high, uniform level of pathway activity across regions that normally experience a gradient.\n\nGiven the threshold logic, uniform high Hedgehog pathway activity drives the highest-threshold fate: Nkx2.2 expression and p3 identity. Because Nkx2.2 cross-represses Olig2, the pMN domain is eliminated, and because Olig2 normally represses Pax6, the loss of Olig2 does not rescue Pax6; moreover, high Hedgehog signaling directly or indirectly suppresses Pax6. Consequently, Nkx2.2 expands broadly at the expense of Olig2 and Pax6 domains.\n\nEvaluating the options: \n- A matches the prediction of uniform high Hedgehog pathway output, with Nkx2.2 expansion and loss of Olig2 and Pax6 domains. \n- B corresponds to absent Hedgehog signaling (e.g., Smo loss), which is the opposite of Ptch1 loss. \n- C would require a uniform intermediate level of signaling, but in Ptch1 null, Smo is maximally derepressed, favoring Nkx2.2, and Nkx2.2 represses Olig2.\n- D is incorrect because the intracellular readout no longer reflects the extracellular Shh gradient when Smo is constitutively active.\n- E is too extreme; floor plate fate requires additional context beyond simply high Hedgehog signaling, and a global conversion to floor plate across the entire neural tube is not the expected outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that all ventral progenitors express Nkx2.2 with loss of Olig2 and Pax6 domains.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1681769"}, {"introduction": "How does a smooth concentration gradient create sharp, distinct boundaries between cell types? This practice explores the crucial role of the downstream gene regulatory network that refines the initial Shh signal. By hypothetically removing the mutual repression between key transcription factors, you will deduce why these interactions are essential for converting a gentle slope of information into a precise, organized pattern of progenitor domains [@problem_id:1681760].", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate spinal cord, the precise identity of different neuronal subtypes is established along the dorsal-ventral axis. This process, known as dorsal-ventral patterning, is orchestrated by opposing gradients of signaling molecules. The ventral floor plate secretes Sonic hedgehog (Shh), creating a high-to-low ventral-to-dorsal gradient, while the dorsal roof plate secretes Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs).\n\nThese gradients control the expression of specific classes of homeodomain transcription factors in progenitor cells. For example, high concentrations of Shh found ventrally activate the expression of Class II transcription factors, such as Nkx2.2, while simultaneously repressing Class I transcription factors, such as Pax6. Consequently, in a wild-type embryo, Pax6 is expressed in a more dorsal domain (the pMN domain) relative to Nkx2.2, which is expressed in the most ventral progenitor domain (the p3 domain). A key feature of this system is that the sharp boundary between these adjacent domains is maintained by mutual transcriptional repression: Pax6 protein represses the *Nkx2.2* gene, and Nkx2.2 protein represses the *Pax6* gene.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant embryo where the specific protein domains responsible for this mutual repression between Pax6 and Nkx2.2 are rendered non-functional, but all other functions of these proteins and the Shh signaling pathway remain intact. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting expression pattern of Pax6 and Nkx2.2 in the ventral neural tube of this mutant?\n\nA. The expression domains of Pax6 and Nkx2.2 will expand and partially overlap, creating a new domain of progenitor cells co-expressing both transcription factors.\n\nB. Both Pax6 and Nkx2.2 expression will be completely lost throughout the neural tube because their expression is mutually dependent.\n\nC. The Pax6 expression domain will expand ventrally to occupy the entire ventral neural tube, and Nkx2.2 expression will be eliminated.\n\nD. The Nkx2.2 expression domain will expand dorsally to occupy the entire ventral neural tube, and Pax6 expression will be eliminated.\n\nE. The expression patterns will remain unchanged, as the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradient is the primary and sole determinant of their respective domains.\n\nF. The Pax6 domain and the Nkx2.2 domain will completely switch their positions along the dorsal-ventral axis.", "solution": "We analyze the dorsal-ventral patterning logic as a gene regulatory network driven by a monotonic ventral-to-dorsal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradient. Let $x$ denote position along the dorsal-ventral axis and let $S(x)$ denote the Shh concentration, with $S$ high ventrally and low dorsally. Let $P(x)$ and $N(x)$ denote Pax6 and Nkx2.2 expression levels, respectively.\n\nPrinciple 1 (Shh control of class I vs class II transcription factors): Shh represses class I factors (e.g., Pax6) and activates class II factors (e.g., Nkx2.2). Thus, in isolation of cross-repression,\n- $P(x)$ is a decreasing function of $S(x)$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S} \\lt 0$.\n- $N(x)$ is an increasing function of $S(x)$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial S} \\gt 0$.\n\nA minimal steady-state description without cross-repression can be written as\n$$\nP(x)=g_{P}\\big(S_{P}^{\\ast}-S(x)\\big), \\quad N(x)=g_{N}\\big(S(x)-S_{N}^{\\ast}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $g_{P}$ and $g_{N}$ are monotone increasing response functions (for example Hill functions) and $S_{P}^{\\ast}$ and $S_{N}^{\\ast}$ are effective response thresholds for Pax6 repression and Nkx2.2 activation, respectively. Because Shh is high ventrally and low dorsally, there are three positional regimes:\n- Ventral-most, where $S(x)\\gg S_{P}^{\\ast}$ and $S(x)\\gg S_{N}^{\\ast}$: $P(x)$ is strongly repressed and $N(x)$ is strongly activated.\n- Dorsal-most, where $S(x)\\ll S_{P}^{\\ast}$ and $S(x)\\ll S_{N}^{\\ast}$: $P(x)$ is activated and $N(x)$ is not activated.\n- Intermediate region, where $S_{N}^{\\ast} \\lt S(x) \\lt S_{P}^{\\ast}$ (provided the thresholds are ordered as empirically observed for adjacent p3/pMN domains): both $g_{P}$ and $g_{N}$ can be positive, yielding co-expression.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Role of mutual repression in wild type): In wild type, Pax6 protein represses the Nkx2.2 gene and Nkx2.2 protein represses the Pax6 gene. This mutual repression creates a bistable switch that sharpens the boundary: in the region of potential overlap (intermediate $S$), the network resolves to one of two exclusive states, $P$ high and $N$ low, or $N$ high and $P$ low, establishing a sharp border between pMN and p3 domains.\n\nMutant condition in the problem: The specific protein domains mediating Pax6↔Nkx2.2 mutual repression are non-functional, while all other functions (including Shh signaling and the intrinsic Shh regulation of class I/II factors) remain intact. Therefore, the bistable cross-repression switch is removed, and the system reduces to independent monotonic responses to $S(x)$ as in the equations above.\n\nLogical consequences:\n- Because Shh still represses Pax6 at very high $S$, Pax6 will not occupy the entire ventral neural tube; thus options asserting complete ventral takeover by Pax6 are incorrect.\n- Because Shh still requires a threshold to activate Nkx2.2, Nkx2.2 will not extend into the most dorsal neural tube; thus options asserting complete ventral occupation exclusively by Nkx2.2 are incorrect.\n- Without mutual repression, the intermediate region where $S_{N}^{\\ast} \\lt S(x) \\lt S_{P}^{\\ast}$ will lack the winner-take-all resolution, so Pax6 and Nkx2.2 will be co-expressed over a broadened, overlapping domain. This directly follows from $P(x) \\gt 0$ and $N(x) \\gt 0$ holding simultaneously in that $S$ interval.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the domains expand and partially overlap, creating a region of progenitors co-expressing Pax6 and Nkx2.2, consistent with option A. Options B, C, D, E, and F contradict either the retained Shh regulation (which prevents complete loss or complete takeover) or the known function of mutual repression in sharpening rather than establishing the primary positional information.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1681760"}]}
