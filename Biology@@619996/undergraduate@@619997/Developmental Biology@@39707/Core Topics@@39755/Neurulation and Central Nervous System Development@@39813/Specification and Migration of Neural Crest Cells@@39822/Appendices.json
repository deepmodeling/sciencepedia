{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The identity of a cell in a developing embryo is often determined by its position, which it \"senses\" through gradients of signaling molecules. This exercise explores this fundamental principle by focusing on the role of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) in specifying neural crest cells at the neural plate border. By considering a hypothetical scenario where this signal is experimentally blocked, you can practice applying the model of developmental patterning to predict changes in cell fate [@problem_id:1715800].", "problem": "In a developing vertebrate embryo, the formation of neural crest cells occurs at the neural plate border, the interface between the neural plate (the future central nervous system) and the non-neural ectoderm (the future epidermis). This process, known as specification, is governed by a precise combination of signaling molecules. A critical signal is the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), which forms a gradient across this region. An intermediate level of BMP signaling, in conjunction with other factors, is required to induce neural crest identity.\n\nAn experiment is designed to probe the role of BMP in this process. A specific, membrane-permeable small molecule inhibitor that irreversibly binds to and deactivates the intracellular domain of BMP receptors is applied to a developing frog embryo. The application is carefully timed and localized to affect only the cells at the neural plate border just as they are about to be specified. This ensures that BMP signaling is completely and constitutively abolished in these target cells.\n\nBased on the established model of neural crest induction, what is the most likely fate of these treated cells at the neural plate border?\n\nA. The cells will fail to become neural crest and will instead be incorporated into the expanding neural plate, expressing neural plate-specific genes.\n\nB. The cells will differentiate into non-neural ectoderm (epidermis) as this is the default fate for ectodermal tissue.\n\nC. The cells will correctly specify as neural crest cells but will be unable to undergo the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition required for migration.\n\nD. The cells will undergo a massive and uncontrolled proliferation, leading to a disorganized overproduction of neural crest-like cells.\n\nE. The cells will undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) due to the lack of critical survival signals provided by the BMP pathway.", "solution": "The established model of ectodermal patterning in vertebrate embryos posits a BMP signaling gradient that partitions fates as follows: high BMP signaling promotes non-neural ectoderm (epidermis), low BMP signaling promotes neural plate (central nervous system), and an intermediate level of BMP, in conjunction with other signals such as Wnt and FGF, specifies neural crest identity at the neural plate border. Thus, neural crest induction requires an intermediate BMP input together with permissive/inductive cues.\n\nIn the experiment, a membrane-permeable, irreversible inhibitor that deactivates the intracellular domain of BMP receptors is applied specifically to neural plate border cells at the moment of specification, producing complete and constitutive loss of BMP signaling in those cells. This effectively converts the BMP level sensed by these cells from intermediate (the normal border condition) to functionally zero (i.e., a “low BMP” condition).\n\nGiven this manipulation, the treated cells cannot reach the intermediate BMP signaling regime required for neural crest specification. Instead, they are shifted into the low-BMP fate domain, which is neural plate identity. Consistent with the “default model” of neural induction in amphibians, inhibition of BMP signaling causes ectoderm to adopt neural character, not epidermal character. Therefore, these cells would fail to express border-specifier and neural crest-specifier genes (e.g., Msx, Pax3/7, Zic, Snail2, FoxD3, Sox10) and would instead express neural plate markers (e.g., Sox2, Sox3), integrating into the expanding neural plate.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is consistent with the low-BMP shift and the requirement of intermediate BMP for neural crest specification.\n- B is incorrect because epidermal differentiation requires BMP activity; BMP inhibition does not default to epidermis.\n- C is incorrect because the cells would not correctly specify as neural crest in the absence of BMP signaling; the defect would occur at specification, not solely at EMT.\n- D is unsupported; BMP pathway inhibition does not cause uncontrolled proliferation or supernumerary neural crest formation.\n- E is unlikely; BMP is not the critical survival signal at this stage, and experimental BMP blockade classically neuralizes ectoderm rather than inducing apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate is incorporation into the neural plate with neural plate-specific gene expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1715800"}, {"introduction": "Once a cell's fate is specified, it must often undergo dramatic changes in shape and behavior to fulfill its function. This practice examines the critical first step of neural crest migration: the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), where cells detach from their neighbors to become mobile. You will explore how the internal cytoskeletal machinery, controlled by signaling proteins like RhoA, governs this transition, providing insight into the mechanics of cell delamination [@problem_id:1715792].", "problem": "In vertebrate development, Neural Crest Cells (NCCs) are a migratory stem cell population that originates at the border of the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm. To begin their extensive migration throughout the embryo, these cells must first undergo an Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). This process involves the loss of tight cell-cell adhesions and the acquisition of a migratory phenotype, allowing them to delaminate from the dorsal neural tube, which is an epithelial sheet. The dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to this transition. In the pre-migratory NCCs within the epithelial layer, high activity of the small GTPase, RhoA, is known to promote actomyosin contractility, which maintains strong cell-cell junctions and the overall integrity of the epithelial sheet.\n\nConsider a developmental biology experiment where a chemical inhibitor that specifically and effectively blocks the activation of RhoA is applied to a developing chick embryo just as the neural crest is specified. Based on the described role of RhoA, what is the most likely direct effect on the initiation of NCC migration?\n\nA. The initiation of NCC migration will be accelerated, with cells delaminating prematurely.\n\nB. The initiation of NCC migration will be completely blocked, and the cells will fail to delaminate.\n\nC. The NCCs will fail to be specified and will instead differentiate into neural tube cells.\n\nD. The NCCs will delaminate on schedule but will migrate randomly instead of following their normal paths.\n\nE. The NCCs will undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) due to cytoskeletal collapse.", "solution": "Given: Pre-migratory neural crest cells (NCCs) reside in an epithelial sheet where high RhoA activity promotes actomyosin contractility that stabilizes cell-cell junctions and maintains epithelial integrity.\n\nPrinciple 1: RhoA, when active (RhoA-GTP), signals through downstream effectors such as ROCK to increase myosin light chain phosphorylation, which elevates actomyosin contractility at the cortex, thereby strengthening adherens and tight junctions and resisting cell shape changes that facilitate delamination.\n\nPrinciple 2: Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) requires the loss of strong intercellular adhesions and a reduction in epithelial contractility at junctions, facilitating junctional disassembly and delamination.\n\nIntervention: A specific inhibitor that blocks activation of RhoA is applied at the time of NCC specification.\n\nImmediate mechanistic consequence: Inhibition of RhoA activation reduces RhoA-GTP levels. This decreases ROCK activity, lowers myosin light chain phosphorylation, reduces cortical actomyosin contractility at junctions, and destabilizes adherens/tight junction complexes.\n\nDirect effect on EMT initiation: Reduced junctional contractility and adhesion lowers the barrier to junctional disassembly, thereby facilitating or accelerating EMT and delamination from the dorsal neural tube relative to normal timing.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A predicts accelerated initiation with premature delamination, which matches the expected consequence of diminished RhoA-mediated maintenance of epithelial integrity.\n- B (complete block of initiation) contradicts the role of RhoA in maintaining, not dismantling, junctions.\n- C (failure of specification) is unrelated to the described role of RhoA in junctional mechanics rather than lineage specification.\n- D (normal timing but random migration) concerns guidance cues and polarity pathways rather than the initiation step governed by junctional mechanics.\n- E (apoptosis) is not the most direct expected outcome of RhoA inhibition in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely direct effect is accelerated initiation with premature delamination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1715792"}, {"introduction": "Migration is not a random walk; cells follow precise paths guided by molecular \"road signs\". This problem delves into the guidance mechanisms that orchestrate the segmented pattern of the peripheral nervous system, formed by migrating neural crest cells. By analyzing a scenario where a key repulsive signal is lost, you will learn how the balance between attractive and repulsive cues is essential for creating organized biological structures [@problem_id:1715823].", "problem": "The formation of the peripheral nervous system relies on the precise migration of Neural Crest Cells (NCCs), a multipotent, migratory cell population that delaminates from the dorsal neural tube in the developing embryo. These cells migrate ventrally to form various structures, including the Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG), which are clusters of sensory neurons arranged in a segmented pattern along the anteroposterior axis.\n\nThis segmentation is achieved through a combination of attractive and repulsive guidance cues provided by the somites, which are transient blocks of mesoderm flanking the neural tube. In a wild-type embryo, each somite is functionally divided into an anterior and a posterior half.\n1.  **Contact-Inhibition**: The posterior half of each somite expresses the transmembrane ligand Ephrin-B1. NCCs express the corresponding receptor, EphB. The binding of Ephrin-B1 to EphB triggers a strong repulsive signal, preventing NCCs from entering the posterior-half territory.\n2.  **Chemotaxis**: A long-range, diffusible chemoattractant, which we will call Growth Factor X (GFX), is secreted from a ventral target region. This provides a general attractive signal that guides NCCs to migrate in a ventral direction.\n\nAs a result, NCCs migrate in discrete streams through the permissive anterior halves of the somites, leading to the formation of segmented DRGs.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mouse model, EphB-null, in which the gene for the EphB receptor is non-functional. In these mutant embryos, the chemotactic system involving GFX remains entirely intact and functional.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following morphologies would most likely describe the arrangement of the DRGs in this EphB-null mutant embryo?\n\nA. The DRGs form in their correct segmented pattern, but each ganglion is significantly smaller than in wild-type embryos.\n\nB. No DRGs form, as the NCCs fail to migrate away from the neural tube.\n\nC. Instead of discrete, segmented ganglia, the NCCs form a continuous, unsegmented ganglionic mass along the migratory pathway.\n\nD. The DRGs form as segmented ganglia, but they are located exclusively in the posterior halves of the somites instead of the anterior halves.\n\nE. The DRGs are duplicated, with one small ganglion forming in the anterior half and another in the posterior half of each somite.", "solution": "We identify the key guidance mechanisms and predict their consequences when one is removed.\n\n1. In wild-type embryos, the posterior half of each somite expresses Ephrin-B1, and NCCs express the EphB receptor. Binding of Ephrin-B1 to EphB generates a repulsive signal that renders the posterior half non-permissive for NCC entry. In parallel, a ventral source secretes a diffusible chemoattractant, GFX, which provides a long-range attractive cue biasing NCCs to move ventrally. The combination of posterior-half repulsion and ventral chemotaxis funnels NCCs into the anterior halves of somites, producing discrete, segmented migratory streams and, consequently, segmented DRGs aligned along the anteroposterior axis.\n\n2. In the EphB-null mutant, the EphB receptor is non-functional in NCCs. Therefore, NCCs cannot transduce the repulsive signal upon encountering Ephrin-B1 in the posterior halves. Functionally, this removes the posterior-half exclusion. The chemotactic system via GFX remains intact, so NCCs still receive a ventral attractant cue.\n\n3. With the repulsive segmentation cue absent while ventral chemotaxis persists, NCCs will still migrate ventrally but are no longer constrained to anterior halves. The absence of a periodic, segmental repulsive barrier allows NCC streams that would have been separated by posterior-half territories to merge and spread across both anterior and posterior halves. This abolishes the segmental gating that generates discrete streams, leading to loss of segmentation.\n\n4. Therefore, instead of forming discrete, segmentally arranged DRGs, the NCCs will aggregate into a continuous, unsegmented chain or mass along the migratory pathway, reflecting the intact ventral attraction without the alternating permissive/non-permissive somite environment.\n\n5. Evaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely because removing repulsion broadens streams and disrupts segmentation rather than producing correctly segmented but smaller ganglia.\n- B is incorrect because ventral chemotaxis remains, so NCCs still migrate away from the neural tube.\n- C matches the prediction: a continuous, unsegmented ganglionic mass forms.\n- D would require preferential attraction to posterior halves; loss of repulsion alone does not invert the pattern to exclusive posterior occupancy.\n- E would require maintenance of somite-level segmentation with both halves permissive yet still split into two discrete ganglia per somite, which contradicts the loss of the segmental gating mechanism; the expected outcome is desegmentation, not duplication.\n\nHence, the most likely morphology is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1715823"}]}
