We will start with a disruption at the molecular level—a non-functional signaling receptor—and predict the consequences for cell behavior and, ultimately, the large-scale shape of an embryonic tissue. This problem highlights the crucial role of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway in orchestrating the cellular movements that drive convergent extension [@problem_id:1677076].", "problem": "During vertebrate gastrulation, the axial mesoderm, a crucial tissue that will give rise to the notochord and prechordal plate, undergoes a dramatic change in shape. This process, known as convergent extension, involves the tissue narrowing along its mediolateral (side-to-side) axis and elongating along its anterior-posterior (head-to-tail) axis. The cellular mechanism driving this morphogenesis is mediolateral cell intercalation, where cells change their neighbors to move from the lateral edges towards the midline, thereby lengthening the tissue. This coordinated cell movement is critically dependent on the non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, which establishes a shared axis of polarity across the cells of the tissue.\n\nA key molecular component of this pathway is the *Frizzled* gene, which encodes a transmembrane receptor essential for receiving the extracellular signals that initiate PCP signaling. Consider a developmental biology experiment in which a vertebrate embryo is engineered to have a complete loss-of-function mutation in the *Frizzled* gene, specifically within all cells of the prospective axial mesoderm. Based on your understanding of the relationship between molecular pathways, cellular behaviors, and tissue morphogenesis, which of the following outcomes would most accurately describe the final shape of the axial mesoderm in this mutant embryo compared to a normal, wild-type embryo?\n\nA. The tissue will be shorter along the anterior-posterior axis and wider along the mediolateral axis.\n\nB. The tissue will be longer along the anterior-posterior axis and narrower along the mediolateral axis.\n\nC. The tissue will have a normal overall length and width, but it will be positioned incorrectly within the embryo.\n\nD. The tissue will fail to form entirely because the mesodermal cells will undergo widespread programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nE. The tissue will form with the correct dimensions, but its constituent cells will be disorganized and fail to form a cohesive structure.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the morphological outcome of disrupting a key gene, *Frizzled*, involved in the process of convergent extension of the axial mesoderm.\n\n1.  **Normal Process: Convergent Extension:** In a wild-type embryo, the axial mesoderm undergoes convergent extension. This means the tissue converges (narrows) in the mediolateral dimension and extends (lengthens) in the anterior-posterior dimension. The final structure is long and thin, forming the primary body axis.\n\n2.  **Cellular Basis: Mediolateral Intercalation:** The engine of convergent extension is mediolateral cell intercalation. Cells within the mesoderm become polarized, extend protrusions preferentially along the mediolateral axis, and actively pull themselves between their neighbors. This collective, directed rearrangement of cells causes the tissue as a whole to narrow and elongate.\n\n3.  **Molecular Control: The PCP Pathway:** The coordination of this complex cellular dance is orchestrated by the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This pathway allows cells to sense directionality within the plane of the tissue, ensuring that their intercalary movements are aligned and productive. For mediolateral intercalation, the PCP pathway establishes a mediolateral polarity in the cells.\n\n4.  **Role of *Frizzled*:** The *Frizzled* gene encodes a transmembrane receptor. Receptors are the first step in a signaling pathway; they receive the external signal (in this case, likely a Wnt ligand) and transmit it into the cell. Therefore, *Frizzled* is essential for initiating the entire PCP signaling cascade.\n\n5.  **Effect of *Frizzled* Loss-of-Function:** If the *Frizzled* protein is non-functional, the cells of the axial mesoderm cannot receive the polarizing signal. The PCP pathway cannot be activated. Consequently, the cells lose their ability to establish a common axis of polarity.\n\n6.  **Consequence at the Cellular Level:** Without polarity information from the PCP pathway, the cells' movements and protrusive activities become random rather than being directed along the mediolateral axis. While the cells may still be motile, they cannot effectively and coherently intercalate with their neighbors.\n\n7.  **Consequence at the Tissue Level:** Since mediolateral cell intercalation is the mechanism that drives convergent extension, the failure of intercalation means the failure of convergent extension. The tissue will not be able to effectively narrow (converge) or lengthen (extend).\n\n8.  **Final Prediction:** The axial mesoderm will fail to elongate along the anterior-posterior axis and fail to narrow along the mediolateral axis. Therefore, compared to a normal, wild-type embryo that forms a long and narrow axial structure, the mutant embryo will have an axial mesoderm that is abnormally short and wide.\n\n9.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. The tissue will be shorter along the anterior-posterior axis and wider along the mediolateral axis.** This perfectly matches our prediction. The failure of extension leads to a shorter tissue, and the failure of convergence leads to a wider tissue.\n    *   **B. The tissue will be longer along the anterior-posterior axis and narrower along the mediolateral axis.** This describes an exaggerated or enhanced convergent extension, which is the opposite of the expected outcome.\n    *   **C. The tissue will have a normal overall length and width, but it will be positioned incorrectly within the embryo.** This misidentifies the function of PCP in this context. While other pathways guide tissue positioning, PCP's primary role here is to shape the tissue itself.\n    *   **D. The tissue will fail to form entirely because the mesodermal cells will undergo widespread programmed cell death (apoptosis).** While severe developmental defects can trigger apoptosis, the primary role of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway is in morphogenesis and cell movement, not cell survival. Disrupting it typically leads to shape defects, not cell death.\n    *   **E. The tissue will form with the correct dimensions, but its constituent cells will be disorganized and fail to form a cohesive structure.** This is partially correct in that cells will be disorganized, but it incorrectly states the overall tissue dimensions will be normal. The disorganization of cell movements is precisely why the tissue-level dimensions will be incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1677076"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of signaling pathways, we now turn to the physical machinery that executes their commands. This practice problem explores the role of the molecular motor Non-muscle Myosin II, the engine that generates contractile forces within cells. By considering the effects of a drug that specifically inhibits this motor, you will explore how active force generation drives the cell junction remodeling essential for tissue elongation [@problem_id:1677122].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying tissue morphogenesis using the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. The focus is on germ-band extension, a key developmental process where the tissue layer that will form the future body plan dramatically elongates along the Anterior-Posterior (A-P) axis while simultaneously narrowing along the Dorsal-Ventral (D-V) axis. This process is known to be driven by convergent extension, which is achieved through a precise pattern of cell intercalation.\n\nTo probe the molecular machinery involved, the biologist treats an early-stage *Drosophila* embryo with a highly specific drug called blebbistatin. This drug acts as a global inhibitor of the motor protein Non-muscle Myosin II (NMII), preventing it from generating contractile forces. The embryo is treated just before the onset of germ-band extension.\n\nBased on the established role of NMII in the mechanics of cell intercalation, which of the following outcomes is the most likely observation for the germ-band tissue in the treated embryo compared to an untreated control?\n\nA. The germ-band will extend even faster and further along the A-P axis due to reduced cellular friction.\n\nB. The germ-band will fail to extend along the A-P axis and may even retract, while the overall tissue integrity is maintained.\n\nC. The germ-band will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), leading to the complete disintegration of the tissue.\n\nD. The germ-band will extend along the D-V axis instead of the A-P axis, reversing the normal direction of elongation.\n\nE. The cells within the germ-band will lose all adhesion and dissociate from one another, causing the tissue to fall apart.", "solution": "- Known mechanism: Germ-band extension in Drosophila arises from convergent extension driven by polarized cell intercalation. Junctional remodeling proceeds through sequences of T1 transitions in which junctions oriented along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis shrink due to anisotropic contractile forces, followed by neighbor exchange and expansion of new junctions along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. The force-generating element responsible for junctional shrinkage is Non-muscle Myosin II (NMII), which generates cortical tension via actomyosin contractility at adherens junctions.\n\n- Drug action: Blebbistatin is a specific inhibitor of NMII motor activity that blocks actin-activated ATPase cycling, thereby preventing myosin from generating contractile forces. While it reduces active tension, it does not directly disrupt cadherin-mediated adhesion or necessarily cause immediate cell death.\n\n- Predicted mechanical consequence: Without NMII-generated tension, D-V-oriented junctions cannot undergo productive shrinkage. Consequently, the T1-to-T3 transitions required for intercalation are blocked or severely impaired. The polarized anisotropy of junctional tension is lost, abolishing the tissue-scale convergent extension that normally elongates the tissue along the A-P axis and narrows along the D-V axis.\n\n- Expected tissue-level outcome: Because the driving forces for extension are absent, the germ-band will fail to extend along the A-P axis. Additionally, preexisting tensions and boundary conditions can cause passive relaxation or slight retraction of previously strained configurations. However, because adhesion complexes (such as E-cadherin) and the general epithelial architecture remain present, overall epithelial integrity is typically maintained under acute NMII inhibition.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  - A is incorrect: Reducing active contractility does not reduce a frictional bottleneck; it removes the very forces required for junctional remodeling and extension.\n  - B is correct: Loss of NMII contractility prevents extension and can lead to failure or retraction, while tissue integrity is preserved due to intact adhesion and epithelial structure.\n  - C is incorrect: Global apoptosis is not the expected immediate consequence of NMII inhibition; tissues generally remain viable over the experimental timescale.\n  - D is incorrect: Directional reversal requires reorientation of anisotropic forces; inhibiting NMII abolishes them rather than inverting them.\n  - E is incorrect: Blebbistatin does not directly disrupt cadherin-based adhesion; cells do not simply dissociate, and the epithelium remains coherent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1677122"}, {"introduction": "Developmental biology is increasingly a quantitative science, and this problem introduces a powerful biophysical concept: anisotropic tension. We will use a hypothetical scenario based on laser ablation—a real laboratory technique—to understand how scientists can measure and quantify the directional forces that shape living tissues. This exercise bridges the gap between qualitative biological descriptions and a quantitative, predictive understanding of morphogenesis, asking you to relate the tension anisotropy factor $\\alpha$ to the recoil velocities of cell junctions [@problem_id:1677084].", "problem": "During vertebrate embryogenesis, the notochord elongates along the Anteroposterior (AP) axis while narrowing along the Mediolateral (ML) axis. This process, known as convergent extension, is driven by the collective, coordinated rearrangement of cells, a phenomenon called cell intercalation. At the molecular level, this rearrangement is powered by the contractile activity of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which generates tension at cell-cell junctions. Experimental evidence suggests that this tension is anisotropic: junctions oriented along the ML axis (i.e., perpendicular to the direction of tissue elongation) are under significantly higher tension than junctions oriented along the AP axis (i.e., parallel to the direction of tissue elongation).\n\nConsider a simplified model of this process. We define $T_{AP}$ as the tension on an AP-oriented junction and $T_{ML}$ as the tension on an ML-oriented junction. The tension on AP-oriented junctions is considered to be a baseline tissue tension, $T_0$. The tension on ML-oriented junctions is higher due to active cellular contraction and is given by $T_{ML} = \\alpha T_0$, where $\\alpha > 1$ is a dimensionless factor representing the degree of tension anisotropy.\n\nA researcher uses a high-powered laser to perform an ablation experiment, severing a single junction and observing the immediate recoil of the cell vertices at its ends. For the purpose of this problem, assume that the initial recoil velocity, $v$, of the vertices is directly proportional to the tension, $T$, that existed in the junction just before it was cut.\n\nLet $v_{ML}$ be the initial recoil velocity after ablating an ML-oriented junction and $v_{AP}$ be the initial recoil velocity after ablating an AP-oriented junction. Determine the theoretical ratio $\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}}$ in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the initial recoil velocity of a mediolaterally (ML) oriented junction to that of an anteroposteriorly (AP) oriented junction, $\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}}$.\n\nThe central piece of information provided is that the initial recoil velocity, $v$, is directly proportional to the pre-existing tension, $T$, in the junction. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n$$v = k T$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant depends on the viscoelastic properties of the cell cortex and cytoplasm, but we can assume it is the same for all junctions within the tissue.\n\nWe can write this relationship for both types of junctions: the ML-oriented junction and the AP-oriented junction.\n\nFor the ML-oriented junction, the recoil velocity is $v_{ML}$ and the tension is $T_{ML}$. Therefore:\n$$v_{ML} = k T_{ML}$$\n\nFor the AP-oriented junction, the recoil velocity is $v_{AP}$ and the tension is $T_{AP}$. Therefore:\n$$v_{AP} = k T_{AP}$$\n\nNow, we can form the ratio $\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}}$ by dividing the first equation by the second:\n$$\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}} = \\frac{k T_{ML}}{k T_{AP}}$$\n\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}} = \\frac{T_{ML}}{T_{AP}}$$\n\nThe problem provides expressions for the tension in each type of junction based on a baseline tension $T_0$ and an anisotropy factor $\\alpha$. These are:\n$$T_{ML} = \\alpha T_0$$\n$$T_{AP} = T_0$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into our ratio equation gives:\n$$\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}} = \\frac{\\alpha T_0}{T_0}$$\n\nThe baseline tension $T_0$ also cancels from the numerator and the denominator, leaving us with the final expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{v_{ML}}{v_{AP}} = \\alpha$$\n\nThus, the ratio of the recoil velocities is equal to the tension anisotropy factor $\\alpha$. This result highlights how laser ablation experiments can be used to quantitatively probe the anisotropic mechanical forces that drive tissue morphogenesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\alpha}$$", "id": "1677084"}]}
