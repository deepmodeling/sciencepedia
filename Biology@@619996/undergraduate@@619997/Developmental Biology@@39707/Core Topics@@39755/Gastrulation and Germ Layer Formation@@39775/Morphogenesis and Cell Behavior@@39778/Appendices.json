{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The formation of tissues and organs begins with the fundamental ability of cells to join together and form coherent structures. Epithelial sheets, which line our organs and form our skin, are a prime example, relying on powerful cell-cell adhesion molecules to maintain their integrity. This first practice problem challenges you to think like an experimentalist by predicting the large-scale consequences of disrupting a single, critical adhesion molecule, E-cadherin [@problem_id:1701963]. Understanding this link between a molecular component and tissue-level morphology is a cornerstone of developmental biology.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, a research team is studying a culture of polarized epithelial cells. These cells have formed a confluent, two-dimensional monolayer on a culture dish, exhibiting the characteristic \"cobblestone\" morphology where cells are tightly packed in a polygonal array. To investigate the role of cell-cell adhesion, the researchers add a highly specific inhibitor to the culture medium. This inhibitor is known to selectively and completely disrupt the function of the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, which is a principal component of adherens junctions.\n\nAssuming the cells remain viable, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary morphological and behavioral changes that would be observed in the cell sheet after a sufficient period of incubation with the E-cadherin inhibitor?\n\nA. The cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) uniformly across the sheet, leading to its complete disintegration due to the loss of survival signals from cell-cell contacts.\n\nB. The cells lose their tight, polygonal packing, detach from their neighbors, and acquire a more rounded or elongated, migratory phenotype, leading to the dissolution of the contiguous sheet.\n\nC. The cells lose their apical-basal polarity, with proteins normally restricted to the apical surface becoming redistributed, but the cells remain physically attached to each other, maintaining the sheet's integrity.\n\nD. The cells enter a state of rapid, uncontrolled proliferation, causing the monolayer to thicken into a disorganized, multilayered mass due to the loss of contact inhibition.\n\nE. The cells are stimulated to secrete large quantities of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to a significant increase in the stiffness and thickness of the underlying substrate.", "solution": "E-cadherin is the core transmembrane adhesion molecule of epithelial adherens junctions. Its extracellular domain mediates calcium-dependent homophilic binding between adjacent cells, and its intracellular domain binds catenins that link to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby providing mechanical cohesion and stabilizing epithelial architecture and polarity. In a confluent, polarized epithelial monolayer with a cobblestone morphology, adherens junctions are essential for maintaining tight, polygonal packing and the integrity of the contiguous sheet.\n\nA selective, complete inhibition of E-cadherin function specifically disrupts adherens junctions. The primary and most immediate morphological consequence is loss of cell-cell adhesion, leading to cells detaching from neighbors, breaking the contiguous sheet. Freed from junctional constraints, epithelial cells often adopt a rounded or elongated morphology and exhibit increased motility, resembling a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, even if full EMT signaling is not engaged. Thus, the expected dominant observation is dissolution of the cohesive monolayer with cells becoming migratory.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely: uniform apoptosis is not the primary consequence of losing E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; anoikis classically follows loss of cell-matrix (integrin) adhesion rather than loss of cadherin-mediated contacts, and the prompt specifies that cells remain viable.\n- C is inconsistent: while adherens junctions contribute to establishing and maintaining polarity, complete loss of E-cadherin principally compromises adhesion; maintaining sheet integrity despite total E-cadherin inhibition is unlikely.\n- D is not the primary outcome: loss of contact inhibition and increased proliferation can occur in some contexts after E-cadherin loss, but the immediate, dominant morphological change is detachment and sheet dissolution rather than thickening into multilayers.\n- E lacks a direct mechanistic link: acute E-cadherin inhibition does not directly trigger large-scale extracellular matrix secretion and substrate stiffening as the primary effect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is loss of tight packing, neighbor detachment, acquisition of rounded or elongated migratory phenotypes, and dissolution of the contiguous sheet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1701963"}, {"introduction": "Morphogenesis is not just about static structures; it is a highly dynamic process involving orchestrated cell movement. This problem presents a hypothetical, but logically constructed, signaling pathway that governs the migration of primordial germ cells—a classic example of long-range cell guidance. You are tasked with diagnosing a failure in this system, where cells correctly navigate to their target but fail to stop [@problem_id:1701930]. This exercise hones your ability to use deductive reasoning to pinpoint defects in complex biological circuits, a crucial skill for interpreting experimental results in genetics and cell biology.", "problem": "In the embryonic development of a model vertebrate, the migration of Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) from their site of specification to the nascent gonads is a critical process. This migration is guided by a complex interplay of signaling molecules. Researchers have identified a simplified core pathway governing this process. A chemoattractant, Somatic-Derived Factor 12 (SDF12), is secreted by the developing gonad. PGCs express a surface receptor, R-Motility (RMot), which binds SDF12. This binding activates a cell-intrinsic kinase, Pro-Migratory Kinase (PMK), which in turn phosphorylates a key cytoskeletal regulatory protein called MIG-1. The phosphorylated form of MIG-1, denoted as MIG-1-P, promotes cell motility.\n\nTo ensure the PGCs stop upon arrival, the gonad also secretes a Gonadal Stop Factor (GSF). PGCs express a different surface receptor, R-Arrest (RArr), that binds GSF. GSF-RArr binding activates a cell-intrinsic phosphatase, Stop-Migration Phosphatase (SMP). Activated SMP dephosphorylates MIG-1-P, converting it back to its inactive, non-phosphorylated state (MIG-1), thereby ceasing migration.\n\nIn a genetically engineered strain, experimenters observe that PGCs successfully navigate to the surface of the developing gonad, but instead of colonizing it, they fail to arrest their movement and continue migrating, ultimately dispersing ectopically throughout the posterior of the embryo.\n\nWhich of the following single genetic mutations within the PGCs is the most plausible cause of this specific phenotype?\n\nA. A nonsense mutation leading to a truncated, non-functional PMK protein.\n\nB. A deletion mutation in the gene encoding the RMot receptor, rendering it non-functional.\n\nC. A missense mutation in the gene encoding MIG-1 that alters the target amino acid for phosphorylation, such that PMK can no longer phosphorylate it.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the RArr receptor.\n\nE. A gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding SMP that makes the phosphatase constitutively active, regardless of GSF binding.", "solution": "The pathway described has two arms: a pro-migratory arm and a stop/arrest arm. In the pro-migratory arm, SDF12 produced by the gonad binds the PGC receptor RMot, which activates the kinase PMK. PMK phosphorylates the cytoskeletal regulator MIG-1 to produce MIG-1-P, and MIG-1-P drives motility. In the stop arm, GSF produced by the gonad binds the PGC receptor RArr, which activates the phosphatase SMP. SMP dephosphorylates MIG-1-P back to MIG-1, reducing motility and causing arrest.\n\nThe observed phenotype is that PGCs successfully navigate to the surface of the developing gonad but fail to arrest and continue migrating ectopically. Successful navigation to the gonad requires that the pro-migratory SDF12→RMot→PMK→MIG-1 phosphorylation pathway be functional at least to the extent necessary for migration, whereas failure to arrest specifically implicates a defect in the GSF→RArr→SMP dephosphorylation pathway.\n\nEvaluate each option against these requirements:\n\nA. A nonsense mutation in PMK would prevent phosphorylation of MIG-1, reducing or abolishing motility. This would impair migration toward the gonad rather than allow successful arrival followed by failure to arrest, so it does not match the phenotype.\n\nB. A deletion in RMot would block SDF12 sensing and upstream activation of PMK, again impairing migration and preventing arrival at the gonad, which contradicts the observation.\n\nC. A missense mutation in MIG-1 that prevents its phosphorylation by PMK would similarly prevent formation of MIG-1-P and motility, impairing migration to the gonad; this does not fit the observed successful navigation.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in RArr would prevent sensing of GSF and thus fail to activate SMP. Without SMP activation, MIG-1 would remain phosphorylated as MIG-1-P, sustaining motility even at the gonad and causing continued migration and ectopic dispersal. This directly explains the observed failure to arrest despite intact initial migration.\n\nE. A gain-of-function mutation rendering SMP constitutively active would continuously dephosphorylate MIG-1-P, suppressing motility broadly and likely preventing efficient migration to the gonad, the opposite of the observed initial success.\n\nTherefore, the mutation most consistent with the phenotype is a loss-of-function in the GSF receptor RArr, which selectively disrupts the stop signal while preserving the pro-migratory pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1701930"}, {"introduction": "In a real embryo, cells rarely follow a single, simple instruction. Instead, they integrate a multitude of signals from their environment to decide where to go. This final problem moves our understanding of cell guidance into a quantitative and more realistic realm, where cells must navigate a landscape defined by two competing cues: a chemical gradient (chemotaxis) and a mechanical stiffness gradient (durotaxis). By calculating the final trajectory, you will practice translating biological principles into a mathematical model, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of modern morphogenesis research [@problem_id:1701927].", "problem": "A bioengineering research group is studying the coordinated migration of fibroblast cells, a process crucial for wound healing. The cells are seeded onto a specially fabricated two-dimensional hydrogel substrate in the $xy$-plane.
