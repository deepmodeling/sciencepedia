{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how an embryo establishes its body plan begins with identifying the source of the initial patterning signals. This exercise challenges you to think like a classical embryologist by considering the consequences of surgically removing a key signaling center, the posterior marginal zone (PMZ), before gastrulation begins [@problem_id:1725635]. By predicting the outcome, you will practice applying the fundamental principle of embryonic induction and appreciate the critical role this specific tissue plays in initiating primitive streak formation.", "problem": "In the early development of the chick embryo, just prior to gastrulation, a specific region at the posterior edge of the blastoderm is critical for establishing the primary body axis. This region is known as the posterior marginal zone (PMZ). An experiment is conducted where a blastoderm is taken at a stage before the primitive streak has appeared. The entire PMZ, along with the adjacent specialized cell group called Koller's sickle, is surgically excised. The remaining portion of the blastoderm is then placed in a suitable culture medium to allow for further development. Assuming the explant survives the procedure, which of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence of this experimental manipulation?\n\nA. The embryo develops normally, as the remaining epiblast cells are plastic enough to regulate and form a new organizing center.\n\nB. A primitive streak forms, but its location is random along the circumference of the remaining blastoderm.\n\nC. Two primitive streaks form on opposite sides of the explant, leading to the development of conjoined twins.\n\nD. No primitive streak forms, and as a consequence, gastrulation does not occur.\n\nE. The epiblast differentiates directly into neural tissue, skipping the gastrulation stage entirely.", "solution": "The posterior marginal zone (PMZ) and Koller's sickle constitute the primary signaling center that specifies where and whether the primitive streak will form in the chick blastoderm. Experimental embryology in the chick has shown:\n- Sufficiency: Grafts of PMZ tissue or localized misexpression of posterior determinants such as Vg1 in non-posterior marginal regions can induce an ectopic primitive streak, demonstrating that PMZ provides instructive signals to initiate streak formation.\n- Necessity: Ablation of the PMZ (especially together with Koller's sickle) removes the primary source of signals such as Nodal-related and Wnt ligands that induce and position the primitive streak in the adjacent epiblast. When these posterior determinants are removed, the remaining epiblast generally fails to initiate a primitive streak.\n\nGiven that the manipulation removes both the PMZ and Koller's sickle before the primitive streak appears, the explant lacks the organizer-equivalent signals required to start gastrulation. The residual epiblast does not randomly initiate a streak in the absence of those posterior signals, and although the chick epiblast exhibits some regulative capacity, it is insufficient to recreate an organizer de novo under these conditions. Therefore, the most likely outcome is failure to form a primitive streak, and consequently, no gastrulation occurs.\n\nThis rules out:\n- A, because complete regulation to form a new organizing center after removal of PMZ and Koller's sickle is not expected in the chick at this stage.\n- B, because streak positioning depends on PMZ-derived signals; random initiation is not observed when these signals are absent.\n- C, because duplication requires ectopic induction rather than removal of the primary inducer.\n- E, because neural induction requires organizer signals typically arising after streak initiation; direct neuralization without gastrulation is not the expected outcome in this system.\n\nThus, the most likely consequence is no primitive streak and no gastrulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1725635"}, {"introduction": "Once the primitive streak is formed, a cascade of specific genes directs the complex cell movements and fate decisions of gastrulation. This problem focuses on one of the most important of these genes, *Brachyury (T)*, a master regulator of mesoderm development [@problem_id:1725684]. By predicting the developmental defects in a mouse embryo lacking this gene, you will sharpen your ability to connect a specific molecular function to its large-scale consequence on embryonic morphology, a core skill in developmental genetics.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying gastrulation in a mouse model. They generate a line of mice that are homozygous for a null mutation in the gene *Brachyury (T)*, which encodes a crucial T-box transcription factor. Based on the known function of this gene, which of the following options most accurately describes the primary developmental defect observed in these mutant embryos during gastrulation and subsequent organogenesis?\n\nA. The primitive streak fails to form on the surface of the epiblast.\n\nB. The neural tube forms but fails to close properly, resulting in anencephaly.\n\nC. Mesodermal cells that ingress through the primitive streak fail to migrate and differentiate correctly, leading to a severe truncation of the posterior body axis.\n\nD. The definitive endoderm fails to form, resulting in a complete absence of the primordial gut tube.\n\nE. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst fails to differentiate into epiblast and hypoblast layers.", "solution": "Brachyury (T) encodes a T-box transcription factor that is expressed in the primitive streak and nascent mesoderm during gastrulation and is essential for mesoderm formation, particularly axial and paraxial mesoderm, and for proper notochord development. In mouse null mutants, the primitive streak does form, epiblast cells ingress, but mesodermal cells exhibit defective migration and differentiation, especially affecting posterior mesoderm. The canonical phenotype is a severe truncation of the posterior body axis (often tail-less), reflecting failure in posterior mesoderm development and notochord formation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the primitive streak forms in Brachyury mutants; genes such as Wnt3 and Nodal are primarily required for primitive streak initiation.\n- B is incorrect because Brachyury is not a primary regulator of neural tube closure; neural tube defects like anencephaly are not the defining phenotype of T-null mutants.\n- C is correct: mesodermal cells that ingress fail to migrate and differentiate properly, leading to posterior truncation of the body axis.\n- D is incorrect because definitive endoderm formation depends more on factors such as Sox17 and Foxa2; T is not the key determinant for definitive endoderm specification.\n- E is incorrect because inner cell mass lineage segregation (epiblast and hypoblast) occurs before T expression and is governed by other regulators.\n\nTherefore, the primary developmental defect in T-null embryos is failure of proper mesodermal migration/differentiation with resulting posterior truncation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1725684"}, {"introduction": "A central question in developmental biology is when a cell becomes irreversibly committed to its fate. This advanced practice invites you to analyze a hypothetical but classic experimental design—a heterotopic transplantation—to probe the plasticity of cells that have just passed through the primitive streak [@problem_id:1725644]. Interpreting the results will test your understanding of cell fate, positional information, and experimental logic, pushing you to think critically about how developmental potential is progressively restricted.", "problem": "An developmental biologist is investigating the concept of cell fate plasticity during gastrulation in the chick embryo. Specifically, the researcher wants to determine if mesodermal cells, immediately after ingressing through the primitive streak, are irreversibly committed to a specific fate or if they remain plastic and can be re-specified by a new signaling environment.\n\nTo test this, the researcher designs a heterotopic transplantation experiment. Cells from the posterior region of the primitive streak of a Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 4 donor embryo are chosen. These cells, upon ingressing, are normally fated to form lateral plate mesoderm. The cells are genetically labeled with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) for tracking. These GFP-labeled presumptive lateral plate mesoderm cells are then transplanted into the mid-streak region of an unlabeled, wild-type HH stage 4 host embryo. The cells in this host region are fated to ingress and contribute to the paraxial mesoderm, which later segments to form somites.\n\nThe host embryo, now containing the transplanted GFP-positive cells, is cultured for 48 hours, by which time somitogenesis has occurred. The embryo is then fixed and analyzed using immunohistochemistry to determine the location and differentiation state of the transplanted GFP-positive cells.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence that the fate of newly ingressed mesodermal cells is plastic and determined by their local positional cues?\n\nA. The GFP-positive cells are found fully and exclusively integrated into the segmented somites along the host's body axis. Furthermore, these cells express the transcription factor Pax3, a key marker for somitic mesoderm.\n\nB. The GFP-positive cells are found primarily in the lateral regions of the embryo, correctly forming lateral plate mesoderm, and are absent from the somites. They express markers characteristic of lateral plate mesoderm, such as FoxF1.\n\nC. The GFP-positive cells fail to integrate into any host tissues and are found undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death) near the site of transplantation.\n\nD. The GFP-positive cells form an ectopic, unorganized cluster near the neural tube. They co-express low levels of both Pax3 and FoxF1, but do not contribute to either the somites or the lateral plate in an organized fashion.\n\nE. The GFP-positive cells migrate to the original transplantation site in the mid-streak and remain there as a mass of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, failing to contribute to any definitive mesodermal structures.", "solution": "We first identify the biological question: whether newly ingressed mesodermal cells at HH stage 4 are irreversibly committed to their original fate (cell-autonomous specification) or remain plastic and can be re-specified by local positional cues (non-cell-autonomous, environment-dependent specification).\n\nWe next formalize the experimental logic of a heterotopic transplantation assay. The donor cells are posterior streak, presumptive lateral plate mesoderm, genetically labeled with GFP, transplanted into the mid-streak region of a host that normally gives rise to paraxial mesoderm and somitic derivatives. If fate is plastic and governed by local cues, donor cells should adopt the host region’s fate (paraxial mesoderm), both in position and in differentiation. If fate is already fixed, donor cells should retain lateral plate identity regardless of environment. Additional interpretations include integration failure or apoptosis, which do not directly test fate plasticity.\n\nThe strongest evidence for plasticity must include:\n- Correct integration into the host’s target tissue corresponding to the new positional context (somites, along the paraxial axis).\n- Acquisition of molecular identity of the host fate (expression of a paraxial mesoderm/somitic marker, such as Pax3).\n- Exclusive and organized contribution consistent with normal morphogenesis (segmented somites), indicating full respecification rather than partial or ambiguous differentiation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these criteria:\n\n- Option A: GFP-positive donor cells are fully and exclusively integrated into segmented somites and express Pax3. This demonstrates both positional incorporation into the paraxial compartment and molecular respecification to somitic identity. Exclusive integration into somites and expression of a definitive somitic marker strongly indicate that the local environment re-specified the fate of these cells, providing direct evidence of plasticity directed by positional cues. This matches the prediction for a plastic, environment-dependent fate.\n\n- Option B: Donor cells contribute to lateral plate mesoderm and express FoxF1, avoiding somites. This indicates maintenance of original fate despite the new environment, arguing against plasticity and in favor of early commitment.\n\n- Option C: Donor cells undergo apoptosis near the transplantation site. This outcome is non-informative for fate plasticity, as cell death could reflect technical issues, incompatibility, or stress rather than fate restriction or respecification.\n\n- Option D: Donor cells form an ectopic, unorganized cluster near the neural tube, co-expressing low levels of both Pax3 and FoxF1 without organized contribution. This suggests mis-specification or mixed identity and failure to respond coherently to positional cues; it is not evidence for proper, cue-driven respecification.\n\n- Option E: Donor cells remain as undifferentiated mesenchyme at the transplant site. This indicates failure to integrate or differentiate and does not support plasticity.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence that newly ingressed mesodermal cells are plastic and determined by local positional cues is provided by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1725644"}]}
