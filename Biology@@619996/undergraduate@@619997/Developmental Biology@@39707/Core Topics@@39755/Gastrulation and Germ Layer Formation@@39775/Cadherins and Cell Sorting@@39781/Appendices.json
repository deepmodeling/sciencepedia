Mastering this concept is key to interpreting many experimental techniques in cell biology and provides the essential biochemical basis for how cadherins operate.", "problem": "An in-vitro experiment is conducted to study the properties of cell-cell adhesion. A researcher cultures a population of keratinocytes, a type of epithelial cell, on a petri dish. After several days, the cells form a confluent monolayer, creating a well-organized, continuous epithelial sheet held together by strong cell-cell junctions. The primary adhesion molecules responsible for this structure are E-cadherins, which are part of the cadherin superfamily of transmembrane proteins. The researcher then adds a solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chemical that is a strong chelating agent for divalent cations like calcium ($Ca^{2+}$), to the culture medium.\n\nBased on the known principles of cell adhesion, what is the most likely and immediate consequence of treating the epithelial sheet with EDTA?\n\nA. The cells will rapidly undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to the toxic effects of EDTA.\n\nB. The cells will lose their adhesions to one another, causing the epithelial sheet to dissociate into individual, rounded cells.\n\nC. The cells will reinforce their junctions with the dish substrate via integrin proteins, causing the sheet to flatten and spread more aggressively.\n\nD. The cells will stop communicating through gap junctions, but the overall structural integrity of the sheet will remain unchanged.\n\nE. The cells will be stimulated to proliferate, breaking the monolayer and starting to form a multilayered, disorganized tissue.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the key adhesion mechanism in an epithelial monolayer of keratinocytes: adherens junctions and desmosomes mediated by cadherins, particularly E-cadherin at adherens junctions and desmogleins/desmocollins (also cadherins) at desmosomes. A fundamental biochemical principle is that cadherins are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules: their extracellular domains bind $Ca^{2+}$, which stabilizes a rigid conformation required for homophilic cadherin-cadherin binding between adjacent cells. Removal of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ causes cadherin ectodomains to become flexible and lose adhesive function, rapidly disrupting cell-cell junctions.\n\nEDTA is a strong chelator of divalent cations, including $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$. Adding EDTA to the culture medium sequesters free $Ca^{2+}$, sharply lowering the effective extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration. By the calcium-dependence principle above, this immediately destabilizes cadherin-mediated adhesions (both adherens junctions and desmosomes), causing the epithelial sheet to lose cohesion. The typical immediate morphological consequence is that cells detach from one another and round up as cortical tension dominates in the absence of junctional constraints.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A is incorrect because EDTA at experimental concentrations is not directly cytotoxic in the short term; apoptosis is not the immediate effect, whereas loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion is rapid.\n- Option B matches the expected immediate outcome: chelation of $Ca^{2+}$ disrupts cadherin function, leading to loss of cell-cell adhesion and dissociation into individual, rounded cells.\n- Option C is incorrect because integrin-mediated cell-substrate adhesion also depends on divalent cations (notably $Mg^{2+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$). EDTA would weaken, not reinforce, integrin-mediated attachment; moreover, the dominant immediate effect observed is loss of cell-cell adhesion, not enhanced spreading.\n- Option D is incorrect because gap junctions (connexins) are not the primary determinants of tissue mechanical integrity; while $Ca^{2+}$ modulates gap junction gating, the structural integrity of the sheet depends on cadherins, which will be compromised by EDTA.\n- Option E is incorrect because proliferation is not an immediate consequence of EDTA treatment and typically requires specific mitogenic signaling; disruption of adhesion does not acutely stimulate proliferation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and immediate consequence is loss of cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion and dissociation of the epithelial sheet into individual cells, as in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1673907"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic function of cadherins, we now explore how differences in adhesive strength between cell populations lead to the formation of organized structures.

This problem [@problem_id:1673945] introduces a biophysical model that defines tissue surface tension ($\\Lambda$) as the result of a competition between cell-cell adhesion energy and the cell's own cortical tension ($\\sigma$). By calculating the effective surface tension for two engineered cell types, you will discover how this interplay can produce non-intuitive sorting outcomes and appreciate the predictive power of quantitative models in developmental biology.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, researchers are investigating the principles of cell sorting by creating synthetic tissues from two distinct, engineered cell lines. The sorting behavior of these cells is governed by the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH), which posits that cell aggregates behave like immiscible fluids, rearranging to minimize their total interfacial free energy. The effective surface tension of a uniform cell aggregate, denoted by $\\Lambda$, is determined by a balance between the cell's active cortical tension, $\\sigma$, generated by the actomyosin cortex, and the cell-cell adhesion energy mediated by cadherins.\n\nA simplified model for the aggregate surface tension is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\sigma - \\alpha E^{2} $$\nwhere $E$ is the surface concentration of E-cadherin, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant that quantifies how effectively cadherin-mediated adhesion reduces the overall tension.\n\nThe two engineered cell lines have the following properties:\n- **Cell Type 1**: These cells have been treated with a drug that completely incapacitates their actin motor-cortex, reducing their active cortical tension to a near-zero residual value of $\\sigma_1 = 0.5$ mN/m. However, they have been genetically engineered to express a very high surface concentration of E-cadherin, $E_1 = 10.0$ arbitrary units (a.u.).\n- **Cell Type 2**: These cells possess a highly active actomyosin cortex, resulting in a large cortical tension of $\\sigma_2 = 9.0$ mN/m. They express a moderate surface concentration of E-cadherin, $E_2 = 5.0$ a.u.\n\nFor both cell types, grown under identical conditions, the adhesion constant is $\\alpha = 0.10 \\text{ mN}/(\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2)$.\n\nA large number of cells from both Type 1 and Type 2 are disaggregated and then randomly mixed together in a suspension.

The Type 2 cells will form a cohesive spherical core that is completely engulfed by the Type 1 cells.\n\nC. The two cell types will remain randomly intermixed and will not exhibit any sorting behavior.\n\nD. The two cell types will partially sort, forming two distinct, adjacent hemispheres.\n\nE. The cells will arrange themselves into a stable checkerboard pattern.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the cell sorting outcome based on the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH). The central principle of DITH is that in a mixture of two cell populations, the population that forms an aggregate with the higher overall surface tension will behave like a liquid with higher surface tension. To minimize the total energy of the system, this population will minimize its surface area by forming a sphere and sorting to the interior of the aggregate, while the population with the lower aggregate surface tension will spread to surround it.\n\nThe aggregate surface tension, $\\Lambda$, for each cell type is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\sigma - \\alpha E^{2} $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the cortical tension, $E$ is the E-cadherin concentration, and $\\alpha$ is a constant.\n\nWe need to calculate the aggregate surface tension for both Cell Type 1 ($\\Lambda_1$) and Cell Type 2 ($\\Lambda_2$).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the aggregate surface tension for Cell Type 1 ($\\Lambda_1$).**\nThe parameters for Cell Type 1 are:\n- Cortical tension, $\\sigma_1 = 0.5$ mN/m\n- E-cadherin concentration, $E_1 = 10.0$ a.u.\n- Adhesion constant, $\\alpha = 0.10 \\text{ mN}/(\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2)$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = \\sigma_1 - \\alpha E_1^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = 0.5 \\, \\text{mN/m} - \\left(0.10 \\, \\frac{\\text{mN}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2}\\right) \\times (10.0 \\, \\text{a.u.})^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = 0.5 - 0.10 \\times 100 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = 0.5 - 10.0 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = -9.5 \\, \\text{mN/m} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the aggregate surface tension for Cell Type 2 ($\\Lambda_2$).**\nThe parameters for Cell Type 2 are:\n- Cortical tension, $\\sigma_2 = 9.0$ mN/m\n- E-cadherin concentration, $E_2 = 5.0$ a.u.\n- Adhesion constant, $\\alpha = 0.10 \\text{ mN}/(\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2)$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = \\sigma_2 - \\alpha E_2^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 9.0 \\, \\text{mN/m} - \\left(0.10 \\, \\frac{\\text{mN}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2}\\right) \\times (5.0 \\, \\text{a.u.})^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 9.0 - 0.10 \\times 25 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 9.0 - 2.5 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 6.5 \\, \\text{mN/m} $$\n\n**Step 3: Compare the aggregate surface tensions and predict the sorting outcome.**\nWe have calculated the two aggregate surface tensions:\n- $\\Lambda_1 = -9.5$ mN/m\n- $\\Lambda_2 = 6.5$ mN/m\n\nComparing these values, we see that $\\Lambda_2 > \\Lambda_1$.\n\nAccording to the sorting rule of DITH, the cell population with the higher aggregate surface tension will sort internally to minimize its free energy. In this case, Cell Type 2 has the higher surface tension ($\\Lambda_2 = 6.5$ mN/m). Therefore, the Type 2 cells will form a cohesive spherical core. The Cell Type 1 population, having the lower surface tension ($\\Lambda_1 = -9.5$ mN/m), will envelop or engulf the core of Type 2 cells.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to the description in option B. The high cortical tension of Type 2 cells dominates over their moderate adhesion, resulting in a high positive surface tension. Conversely, for Type 1 cells, the extremely high adhesion dominates over the near-zero cortical tension, resulting in a large negative surface tension, making them highly \"wettable\" and thus the engulfing phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1673945"}]}
