[@problem_id:1721056]", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, a researcher isolates the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) from a mouse blastocyst. The ICM at this stage is composed of two distinct populations of precursor cells: those that will form the epiblast and those that will form the primitive endoderm (also known as the hypoblast). The researcher then treats the ICM with a solution that breaks all cell-to-cell connections, resulting in a suspension of individual, disaggregated precursor cells. These cells are subsequently pelleted by centrifugation and cultured under conditions that promote re-aggregation. Assuming the cells remain viable and retain their intrinsic properties, what is the most likely structural organization that the re-aggregated cell mass will adopt over time?\n\nA. The cells will re-aggregate into a chaotic, random mixture of epiblast and primitive endoderm precursors, with no discernible organization.\n\nB. The cells will fail to re-associate and will undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nC.

The primitive endoderm precursors will form an outer epithelial layer that completely envelops a solid inner core of epiblast precursors.\n\nE.

The Inner Cell Mass (ICM) contains two lineages at this stage: epiblast precursors and primitive endoderm (hypoblast) precursors. In vivo, the primitive endoderm forms an epithelial monolayer on the surface of the ICM facing the blastocoel, whereas the epiblast forms a compact inner mass.\n\nWe next consider the experimental manipulation: complete dissociation of cell-to-cell contacts followed by re-aggregation under conditions that preserve cell viability and intrinsic lineage properties. Under these circumstances, classical principles of cell sorting apply, notably:\n- Differential adhesion/tissue surface tension hypothesis: mixed populations of cells rearrange to minimize interfacial free energy, such that more cohesive cell types occupy internal positions, and less cohesive or epithelializing cell types adopt peripheral positions.\n- Epithelialization and apico-basal polarity: primitive endoderm precursors are intrinsically competent to form an epithelium and to deposit basement membrane components, favoring localization at a surface where an epithelial layer can form.\n- Lineage-specific adhesion molecule expression and polarity cues drive reproducible sorting rather than a random mixture.\n\nApplying these principles, upon re-aggregation the cells will not remain in a random mixture, nor will they fail to re-associate if viability and intrinsic properties are preserved. Instead, primitive endoderm precursors will epithelialize and resolve to the periphery of the aggregate, forming a continuous outer layer, while the epiblast precursors will form a solid inner core. This organization reproduces the in vivo topology and is consistent with observations from embryoid body formation in vitro, where primitive endoderm derivatives form the outer layer around an inner epiblast-like core.\n\nTherefore, the most likely structural organization is an outer epithelial layer of primitive endoderm precursors enveloping a solid inner core of epiblast precursors, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1721056"}, {"introduction": "The cell sorting behavior we just explored depends on cells first acquiring distinct identities. This practice delves into the crucial molecular dialogue between cells that establishes the primitive endoderm fate, a process driven by the Fibroblast Growth Factor ($FGF$) signaling pathway. By analyzing a hypothetical experiment using a specific chemical inhibitor, you will test your understanding of how this signaling cascade resolves the initial \"salt-and-pepper\" pattern of cell fates into two separate lineages. [@problem_id:1721058]", "problem": "In the early mammalian embryo, the cells of the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) must segregate into two distinct lineages: the epiblast, which gives rise to the fetus proper, and the primitive endoderm (also known as the hypoblast), which contributes to extraembryonic tissues like the yolk sac. This cell fate decision is governed by a dynamic signaling network.\n\nInitially, all cells within the ICM co-express two key transcription factors, NANOG and GATA6. NANOG specifies the epiblast fate, while GATA6 specifies the primitive endoderm fate. These two factors are mutually repressive; high levels of one tend to suppress the expression of the other. The resolution of this bistable state is coordinated by intercellular signaling. Cells that happen to develop higher levels of NANOG begin to secrete a signaling protein called Fibroblast Growth Factor 4 (FGF4). This secreted FGF4 then binds to receptors on adjacent cells, triggering an intracellular signaling cascade. This cascade prominently involves the activation of Mitogen-activated protein kinase Kinase (MEK), which in turn activates its downstream target, Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK). The activation of the MEK-ERK pathway strongly promotes the expression and stabilization of the GATA6 protein.\n\nConsider an experiment where a batch of mouse blastocysts is cultured in a specialized medium. This medium is supplemented with a potent and highly specific small-molecule inhibitor that completely blocks the kinase activity of MEK. Based on your understanding of the signaling pathway described, what would be the predicted composition of the Inner Cell Mass in these embryos?\n\nA. All ICM cells will differentiate into primitive endoderm.\n\nB. All ICM cells will differentiate into epiblast.\n\nC. The ICM will show a normal ratio and \"salt-and-pepper\" spatial distribution of epiblast and primitive endoderm cells.\n\nD. The ICM will fail to form, and all cells will differentiate into trophectoderm.\n\nE. All ICM cells will remain in an undifferentiated state, continuing to co-express high levels of both NANOG and GATA6 indefinitely.", "solution": "The decision between epiblast and primitive endoderm within the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) is governed by a mutual repression circuit between NANOG (epiblast-promoting) and GATA6 (primitive endoderm-promoting), coupled to intercellular signaling via FGF4. Cells with higher NANOG secrete FGF4, which activates the FGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in neighboring cells. Activated ERK promotes the expression and stabilization of GATA6, thereby biasing those cells toward primitive endoderm. Thus, functional MEK-ERK signaling is required to stabilize and expand the GATA6-positive primitive endoderm lineage.\n\nIntroducing a potent, highly specific MEK inhibitor that completely blocks MEK kinase activity abolishes downstream ERK activation in response to FGF4. Consequently, the FGF4 signal cannot promote or stabilize GATA6. In the mutual repression circuit, without ERK-driven support for GATA6, GATA6 levels decline and NANOG prevails. This pushes ICM cells toward the NANOG-high epiblast fate.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- A is inconsistent because GATA6 upregulation requires MEK-ERK activity, which is blocked.\n- C requires intact FGF4-MEK-ERK signaling to generate the salt-and-pepper pattern; this is absent.\n- D concerns trophectoderm, which is specified by position and Hippo signaling; MEK inhibition does not convert ICM to trophectoderm.\n- E is unlikely because the mutual repression network resolves toward NANOG dominance when ERK-mediated GATA6 stabilization is absent; co-expression is not indefinitely maintained.\n\nTherefore, all ICM cells adopt the epiblast fate under complete MEK inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1721058"}, {"introduction": "We have seen how signaling creates cell identity and how this leads to physical sorting. This final practice bridges these concepts by placing you in the role of a modern geneticist, tasked with discovering the specific genes responsible for cell sorting. You will analyze data from a simulated CRISPR-based genetic screen, a powerful technique used to identify key molecular players, and learn how to interpret experimental results to pinpoint a candidate gene required for proper tissue organization. [@problem_id:1721042]", "problem": "In the early stages of mammalian development, the inner cell mass of the blastocyst segregates into two distinct lineages: the epiblast (Epi) and the primitive endoderm (PrE). This sorting process is crucial for establishing the body plan and is thought to be driven by differential heterotypic adhesion between the two cell types. To identify the cell surface proteins that mediate this process, a research team performs a genome-wide screen using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology.\n\nThe experiment begins with a large population of mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs) that can differentiate into both Epi and PrE lineages. These cells are transduced with a pooled library of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), where each sgRNA is designed to knock out a specific gene encoding a cell surface protein. After inducing differentiation, the mixed population of cells is allowed to aggregate. Two phenomenologically distinct types of aggregates are observed: \"Sorted\" aggregates, where Epi and PrE cells have successfully segregated into their respective layers, and \"Unsorted\" aggregates, where the two cell types remain intermingled.\n\nThe researchers then isolate these two populations and perform Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to determine the abundance of each sgRNA. The raw read counts are also determined for the initial sgRNA library (Input). The underlying hypothesis is that if a gene is required for sorting, its knockout will cause cells to be in the \"Unsorted\" state. Therefore, the corresponding sgRNA should be enriched in the \"Unsorted\" population and depleted in the \"Sorted\" population relative to its initial abundance.\n\nTo quantify this effect, a \"Hit Score\" is defined for each gene. First, the frequency, $f$, of a specific sgRNA in a sample is calculated as its read count divided by the total read count for that sample. The Log2 Fold Change (LFC) for an sgRNA in a given experimental sample (either \"Sorted\" or \"Unsorted\") is then calculated relative to the Input library:\n$$LFC_{\\text{Sample}} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{f_{\\text{Sample}}}{f_{\\text{Input}}}\\right)$$\nThe final Hit Score for a gene is the difference between the LFC of the \"Unsorted\" population and the LFC of the \"Sorted\" population:\n$$HitScore = LFC_{\\text{Unsorted}} - LFC_{\\text{Sorted}}$$\nA large positive Hit Score indicates a gene whose disruption impairs cell sorting, making it a strong candidate for being involved in the process.\n\nGiven the following NGS read count data for four candidate genes, identify the most promising candidate for a protein required for proper Epi/PrE sorting.\n\n| sgRNA Target | Input Reads | Sorted Population Reads | Unsorted Population Reads |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Gene A       | 105         | 74                      | 42                        |\n| Gene B       | 105         | 21                      | 525                       |\n| Gene C       | 105         | 95                      | 116                       |\n| Gene D       | 105         | 179                     | 26                        |\n| Total Reads  | 1,050,000   | 2,100,000               | 2,625,000                 |\n\nWhich of the following genes is the top candidate?\n\nA.
