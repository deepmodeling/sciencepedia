The approximately $\\pm 1$ cleavage-cycle shifts produced by halving or doubling template DNA per nucleus (by changing ploidy) and by halving or doubling cytoplasmic volume are the quantitative signature of a threshold that depends on total template DNA per unit cytoplasm; these observations support causality of the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio for MBT timing.**\nThe core relationship is $p \\cdot 2^{C_{MBT}} / V_{C, \\text{exp}} = \\text{constant}$. Taking a base-2 logarithm gives $\\log_2(p) + C_{MBT} - \\log_2(V_{C, \\text{exp}}) = \\text{constant'}$. A change in $p$ or $V_{C, \\text{exp}}$ by a factor of $2$ results in a change in $\\log_2(p)$ or $\\log_2(V_{C, \\text{exp}})$ by $\\pm 1$. To maintain the equality, $C_{MBT}$ must shift by $\\mp 1$ or $\\pm 1$, respectively. For instance, doubling ploidy ($p \\to 2p$) requires $C_{MBT}$ to decrease by $1$. Halving volume ($V_{C, \\text{exp}} \\to V_{C, \\text{exp}}/2$) also requires $C_{MBT}$ to decrease by $1$. This perfectly explains the observed $\\pm 1$ cycle shifts. By independently manipulating the numerator (total DNA, via ploidy) and the denominator (cytoplasmic volume) of the N/C ratio and observing the predicted compensatory shifts in MBT timing, the experiment provides strong evidence for causality, distinguishing it from mere correlation. The statement correctly identifies both the quantitative signature and the logical support for causality.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. A pure clock model in which MBT occurs at a fixed absolute time after fertilization remains viable because the time to MBT is approximately the same across ploidies and volumes.**\nA pure clock model predicts that MBT timing is independent of ploidy and volume. The problem gives the cycle period $T=15\\,\\mathrm{min}$.

These differences, far from being negligible, are the precise predictions of the N/C ratio model. Therefore, a pure clock model is directly falsified by the data.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. A nuclear-number model in which MBT is triggered when the absolute number of nuclei reaches a fixed value is consistent with the data, because nuclear number, not DNA content, determines MBT.**\nA nuclear-number model predicts that $N(C_{MBT}) = 2^{C_{MBT}}$ is constant at MBT. We calculate this value for the ploidy series:\n*   Haploid ($C=13$): $N = 2^{13}$.\n*   Diploid ($C=12$): $N = 2^{12}$.\n*   Tetraploid ($C=11$): $N = 2^{11}$.\nThe number of nuclei at MBT is clearly not constant, varying by a factor of 4 across conditions. The model is therefore inconsistent with the data and is falsified.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. The equality of total DNA at MBT across ploidies, namely $1\\cdot 2^{13}=2\\cdot 2^{12}=4\\cdot 2^{11}$, follows from the observed cycle shifts and strongly supports a template-titration mechanism for MBT.**\nThe \"template-titration mechanism\" is the molecular interpretation of the N/C ratio hypothesis, where accumulating DNA templates titrate a finite maternal supply of a repressor. In the ploidy series, the cytoplasmic volume is constant, implying a constant amount of total maternal repressor. This model predicts that MBT should occur when the total amount of DNA reaches a constant threshold. The total number of haploid genome equivalents at MBT across the ploidy series is proportional to $p \\cdot 2^{C_{MBT}}$.\n*   Haploid: $1 \\cdot 2^{13} = 8192$.\n*   Diploid: $2 \\cdot 2^{12} = 2 \\cdot 4096 = 8192$.\n*   Tetraploid: $4 \\cdot 2^{11} = 4 \\cdot 2048 = 8192$.\nThe equality holds. This calculation follows directly from the observed cycle shifts. The constancy of the total DNA amount at MBT (for a constant cytoplasmic volume) is a direct prediction of, and therefore strong support for, the template-titration mechanism.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**E. Because histone protein dosage scales with ploidy, the earlier MBT in tetraploids contradicts any model in which maternal histone titration controls MBT, thereby ruling out histone titration as a causal mechanism.**\nA maternal histone titration model is another example of a template-titration mechanism. In this model, MBT is triggered when the accumulating DNA has exhausted the maternal stockpile of histones. This implies that MBT occurs when the total amount of DNA, $D_{total} = p \\cdot 2^C \\cdot D_0$, reaches a threshold determined by the initial histone supply. For the ploidy series (with constant egg volume and thus constant maternal histone supply), this model predicts $p \\cdot 2^{C_{MBT}} = \\text{constant}$. This is precisely what the data show. The earlier MBT in tetraploids (cycle $11$) compared to diploids (cycle $12$) is a direct prediction of this model, as tetraploids accumulate total DNA faster. The statement claims this observation contradicts the histone titration model, when in fact it supports it. The reasoning in the statement is fundamentally flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2681660"}]}
