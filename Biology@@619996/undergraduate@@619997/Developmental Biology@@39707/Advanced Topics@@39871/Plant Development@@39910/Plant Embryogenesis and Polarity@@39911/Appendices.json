This communication is partly mediated by mobile transcription factors that move through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this process. The suspensor acts as a large reservoir, maintaining a constant concentration, $C_S$, of a specific transcription factor. This factor moves into the adjacent spherical proembryo, which has a constant volume $V$. The net flux of the factor into the proembryo is proportional to the concentration difference between the suspensor and the proembryo, described by the relation $F = \\alpha (C_S - C)$, where $C$ is the factor's concentration inside the proembryo and $\\alpha$ is a transport coefficient representing the total permeability of the plasmodesmata (with units of volume per time). Simultaneously, the transcription factor is subject to first-order degradation within the proembryo, with a rate constant $k$.\n\nA mutation is discovered that significantly enhances plasmodesmatal connectivity, causing the transport coefficient to increase by a factor of $\\gamma > 1$.
