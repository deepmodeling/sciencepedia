This model posits that the identity of organs in the four concentric whorls of a flower is determined by the combinatorial expression of three classes of homeotic genes (A, B, and C). The rules are as follows:\n- Whorl 1 (outermost): Class A genes alone specify sepals.\n- Whorl 2: Class A and Class B genes together specify petals.\n- Whorl 3: Class B and Class C genes together specify stamens.\n- Whorl 4 (innermost): Class C genes alone specify carpels.\nFurthermore, Class A and Class C activities are mutually antagonistic.\n\nIn *Arabidopsis*, the Class B function is provided by a heterodimer of two proteins: APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI). Both proteins are required for the dimer to be functional.\n\nConsider a novel, dominant mutation discovered in the *APETALA3* gene, which we will call *AP3**. A geneticist determines that the mutant AP3* protein is produced and is stable, but it is functionally inactive.

The mutant *AP3** protein in the genotype *AP3/AP3** is stated to be stable and to bind PI normally, but to be functionally inactive. Therefore, *AP3** forms *AP3**–PI heterodimers that are nonfunctional. Because *AP3** competes effectively with wild-type AP3 for PI, it acts as a dominant-negative, sequestering PI into inactive complexes and thereby reducing functional AP3–PI dimers below the level required for $B$ function.

You will analyze a genetic mosaic experiment to distinguish between two competing hypotheses about how gene expression domains are established, a classic problem concerning cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous gene action ([@problem_id:1687157]). Successfully navigating this thought experiment demonstrates a sophisticated grasp of experimental design in developmental genetics.", "problem": "In the study of flower development in the model organism *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the ABC model provides a framework for understanding how homeotic genes specify the identity of floral organs in four concentric whorls. The model posits three classes of gene function: A-class genes (e.g., *APETALA1*, or *AP1*) specify sepals in whorl 1; A- and B-class genes together specify petals in whorl 2; B- and C-class genes together specify stamens in whorl 3; and C-class genes (e.g., *AGAMOUS*, or *AG*) specify carpels in whorl 4. A key feature of this model is the mutual antagonism between A-class and C-class genes: A-function represses C-gene expression in the outer two whorls, and C-function represses A-gene expression in the inner two whorls.\n\nA researcher proposes a specific hypothesis regarding the mechanism of this repression: the boundary between the A and C domains is sharpened by a non-cell-autonomous repressor. Specifically, the hypothesis states that the *AG* gene product does not directly repress *AP1*, but instead induces the production of a mobile signaling molecule that diffuses from the C-domain into adjacent cells to repress *AP1* transcription.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, you are provided with an experimental system. You have *Arabidopsis* plants that are homozygous for a transcriptional reporter construct, *pAP1::GFP*. In these plants, the promoter of the *AP1* gene drives the expression of a stable Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Using an inducible recombination system, you can generate small, clonal patches of homozygous *ag/ag* mutant tissue within an otherwise wild-type (*AG/AG*) plant.\n\nConsider an experiment where you successfully induce several small *ag/ag* mutant clones, each located entirely within the developing fourth whorl (the carpel primordium). Assuming the researcher's non-cell-autonomous repression hypothesis is correct, which of the following outcomes describes the expected pattern of GFP expression in and around these fourth-whorl clones?\n\nA. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) only within the cells of the *ag/ag* clone. The surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* tissue will show no GFP expression.\n\nB. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will not be expressed (GFP OFF) within the cells of the *ag/ag* clone, and it will also be OFF in the surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* tissue.\n\nC. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) in both the cells of the *ag/ag* clone and in a small halo of surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* tissue.\n\nD. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) in the wild-type *AG/AG* tissue immediately surrounding the clone, but will not be expressed (GFP OFF) within the clone itself.\n\nE. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) throughout the entire fourth whorl, irrespective of the presence or genotype of the clone.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of a genetic mosaic experiment designed to test the hypothesis that the repression of the A-class gene *AP1* by the C-class gene *AG* is non-cell-autonomous.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the baseline state and the reporter.**\nThe experiment is conducted in plants carrying a *pAP1::GFP* reporter. This means that GFP fluorescence directly indicates transcriptional activity of the *AP1* gene. The experiment focuses on the fourth whorl, which in a wild-type flower is the C-domain. According to the ABC model, C-function (*AG*) represses A-function (*AP1*) in the fourth whorl. Therefore, in a normal wild-type fourth whorl, *AG* is ON, *AP1* is OFF, and consequently, there is no GFP expression.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the competing models: cell-autonomous vs. non-cell-autonomous repression.**\n*   **Cell-autonomous repression (the null hypothesis):** In this model, the machinery that represses *AP1* must be present *within* the same cell. A cell must express *AG* itself to repress its own *AP1* transcription. If a cell loses *AG* function (becomes *ag/ag*), it would lose the ability to repress *AP1*, and *AP1* expression would be de-repressed.\n*   **Non-cell-autonomous repression (the hypothesis to be tested):** In this model, *AG*-expressing cells produce a mobile signal (a repressor molecule) that travels to nearby cells to repress *AP1*. This means a cell does not need to express *AG* itself to have its *AP1* gene repressed, as long as it receives the signal from a neighbor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the experimental setup.**\nThe experiment creates small clones of *ag/ag* mutant cells within the fourth whorl. These clones are \"islands\" of tissue lacking C-function, surrounded by a \"sea\" of wild-type *AG/AG* tissue that has normal C-function.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome based on the non-cell-autonomous hypothesis.**\nWe assume the hypothesis is correct.\n*   **Consider the wild-type *AG/AG* cells surrounding the clone:** These cells express *AG*. According to the hypothesis, they produce the mobile repressor signal. They also repress their own *AP1* promoter. Thus, *pAP1::GFP* is OFF in these cells.\n*   **Consider the *ag/ag* mutant cells within the clone:** These cells lack the *AG* gene product. Therefore, they cannot produce the mobile repressor signal themselves.\n*   **Consider the interaction:** The mobile repressor signal, produced by the surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* cells, diffuses into the adjacent *ag/ag* mutant clone.\n*   **Effect on the clone:** The *ag/ag* cells, despite lacking their own *AG* function, now receive the extrinsic repressor signal from their neighbors. This signal acts on the *AP1* promoter within the *ag/ag* cells, causing its repression.\n*   **Final observation:** As a result, the *AP1* promoter remains OFF, and no GFP is produced, *both* in the surrounding wild-type tissue *and* within the *ag/ag* mutant clone. The phenotype of the mutant cells is \"rescued\" by the surrounding wild-type cells.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the multiple-choice options.**\n*   **A. GFP ON only within the clone:** This is the expected outcome for a *cell-autonomous* repression mechanism, where the loss of *AG* within a cell directly leads to the de-repression of *AP1* in that same cell. This contradicts the non-cell-autonomous hypothesis.\n*   **B. GFP OFF within the clone and in the surrounding tissue:** This matches our prediction. The repressor signal from the surrounding tissue enters the clone and keeps *AP1* turned off. The surrounding tissue has its own *AG* to keep *AP1* off. Therefore, no GFP is visible anywhere in or around the clone.\n*   **C. GFP ON in the clone and a surrounding halo:** This would suggest a non-cell-autonomous *activator* of *AP1* is being released from the mutant clone, which is inconsistent with any part of the model.\n*   **D. GFP ON in surrounding tissue, OFF in the clone:** This is illogical. The surrounding tissue is wild-type for the C-domain and should be repressing *AP1*, not expressing it.\n*   **E. GFP ON throughout the entire whorl:** This would imply that a small clone has a massive, long-range effect, which is highly unlikely and not predicted by the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction based on the non-cell-autonomous repressor hypothesis is that the *pAP1::GFP* reporter remains unexpressed (GFP OFF) everywhere in the fourth whorl, including within the *ag/ag* mutant clone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1687157"}]}
