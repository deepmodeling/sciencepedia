{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental skill in developmental biology is connecting a specific genetic change to its observable consequences in the whole organism. This first exercise challenges you to do just that, using the well-known plant hormone ethylene. By considering the crucial roles of ethylene in major developmental programs like fruit ripening and leaf senescence, you can deduce the likely phenotype of a mutant plant that can no longer perceive the hormone's signal [@problem_id:1708382]. This helps connect molecular-level changes to whole-plant physiology.", "problem": "A team of plant biologists is investigating a novel mutant variety of tomato, *Solanum lycopersicum*. This particular mutant possesses a loss-of-function mutation in all genes encoding for ethylene receptors. This mutation results in receptor proteins that are unable to bind to the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, effectively rendering the plant insensitive to its presence. Assuming the mutant plants are otherwise healthy and grown under standard agricultural conditions alongside wild-type (non-mutant) tomato plants, which of the following set of phenotypes would most likely be observed in the mutant variety compared to the wild-type?\n\nA. The fruits will fail to ripen or show severely delayed ripening, and senescent leaves will remain attached to the plant for an extended period.\n\nB. The fruits will ripen much faster and more uniformly, and the plant will undergo premature leaf shedding.\n\nC. The fruits will ripen normally, but the plant will retain its leaves for much longer, showing delayed leaf abscission.\n\nD. The fruits will fail to ripen, but the plant will exhibit accelerated shedding of its leaves.\n\nE. Both fruit ripening and leaf shedding will occur normally, but the plant's stems will be significantly thicker and shorter.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physiological roles of ethylene and the consequences of ethylene insensitivity, then map these expectations onto the options.\n\nFirst principle: In climacteric fruits like tomato, ethylene is both necessary and sufficient to trigger and coordinate the ripening program. Experimental observations in tomato demonstrate that exogenous ethylene accelerates ripening, while blocking ethylene synthesis, perception, or downstream signaling abolishes or severely delays ripening. Therefore, any condition that renders tissues insensitive to ethylene will result in failure or strong delay of fruit ripening.\n\nSecond principle: Ethylene promotes organ senescence and abscission (shedding), including leaf abscission, typically acting in concert with changing auxin transport/signals at the abscission zone. When ethylene signaling is blocked or tissues are insensitive to ethylene, leaf abscission is reduced or delayed, and senescent leaves tend to remain attached longer than in wild type.\n\nThird principle: Ethylene signaling mechanics clarify why loss of perception yields insensitivity. Ethylene is perceived by a family of receptors (e.g., ETR/ERS types). In the absence of ethylene, these receptors actively repress ethylene responses via CTR1 kinase, keeping downstream responses off. When ethylene binds, receptor activity is inactivated, CTR1 repression is relieved, and ethylene responses are turned on. If receptor proteins cannot bind ethylene and the plant is functionally insensitive (as stated), the repression remains in place and ethylene responses fail to initiate, phenocopying an ethylene-deprived state. Empirically, tomato mutants defective in ethylene perception (e.g., Never-ripe) show delayed or blocked ripening and reduced abscission.\n\nApplying these principles to the options:\n- Option A predicts failure or severe delay of fruit ripening and prolonged leaf attachment. This matches the expected outcomes of ethylene insensitivity in tomato: impaired climacteric ripening and delayed abscission.\n- Option B predicts faster ripening and premature leaf shedding, which are hallmarks of ethylene hypersensitivity or ethylene overproduction, the opposite of insensitivity.\n- Option C predicts normal ripening but delayed leaf abscission, which is inconsistent because ethylene insensitivity would impair both processes.\n- Option D predicts failed ripening but accelerated leaf shedding, which is internally inconsistent with ethylene biology because both ripening and abscission are promoted by ethylene; insensitivity would not accelerate abscission.\n- Option E predicts normal ripening and abscission but thicker, shorter stems. Ethylene promotes the classic triple response leading to reduced elongation and radial swelling in etiolated seedlings; ethylene insensitivity tends to reduce these responses (often leading to longer, not shorter, stems). Moreover, E ignores the major ethylene-controlled processes in question (ripening and abscission), making it inconsistent.\n\nNote on wording: Although the prompt describes the alleles as loss-of-function and unable to bind ethylene while also stating the plants are ethylene-insensitive, the key functional outcome specified (insensitivity to ethylene) determines the phenotypic predictions above. Under that specified outcome, Option A is the consistent choice.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype set most likely observed is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708382"}, {"introduction": "Biological processes are rarely governed by single genes; instead, they operate as intricate pathways. A powerful genetic method to decipher these pathways is epistasis analysis, which involves studying the interactions between two different mutations. This practice asks you to predict the phenotype of a double mutant to determine the functional order of genes in a linear pathway controlling organ boundary formation [@problem_id:1708392]. Mastering this logic is key to building models of genetic regulation from experimental data.", "problem": "In plant development, the formation of sharp boundaries that separate the shoot apical meristem from newly forming lateral organs (like leaves or flowers) is critical for establishing the plant's overall architecture. This process is controlled by a precise interplay of hormones and gene regulation.\n\nConsider a model system where this boundary formation is governed by the following linear pathway:\n1.  A specific PIN-FORMED (PIN) protein, which we will call PIN-alpha, a transmembrane protein that functions as an auxin hormone efflux carrier. PIN-alpha is localized in such a way that it actively pumps auxin out of the cells at the presumptive boundary, creating a zone with a local minimum of auxin concentration.\n2.  A key boundary-specifying gene, a transcription factor from the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) family, which we will call CUC-omega. The promoter of the *CUC-omega* gene contains elements that cause its transcription to be strongly repressed by high concentrations of auxin.\n\nTherefore, the function of PIN-alpha is to create an auxin-depleted zone that, in turn, permits the expression of CUC-omega. The CUC-omega protein then activates downstream genes that arrest cell division and establish a non-proliferative boundary. Laboratory studies have shown that loss-of-function mutations in either the gene for *PIN-alpha* (denoted *pin-alpha*) or the gene for *CUC-omega* (denoted *cuc-omega*) lead to a very similar phenotype: the boundary fails to form, resulting in the fusion of the base of lateral organs to the main stem.\n\nBased on this genetic model, predict the most likely phenotype of a double mutant plant that has loss-of-function mutations in both genes (*pin-alpha cuc-omega*).\n\nA. A phenotype identical to that of the *cuc-omega* single mutant.\n\nB. A wild-type phenotype, because the two mutations are in the same pathway and their effects cancel each other out.\n\nC. A completely novel phenotype not seen in either single mutant, such as the formation of extra stems.\n\nD. A significantly more severe fusion phenotype than that of either single mutant, indicating a synergistic interaction.\n\nE. A partial rescue of the fusion phenotype, resulting in organs that are less fused than in either single mutant.", "solution": "We formalize the regulatory relationships as follows.\n\nLet $A$ denote the auxin concentration at the presumptive boundary and let $A_{th}$ be the threshold above which auxin represses transcription of the boundary gene. Let $p \\in \\{0,1\\}$ represent the functional status of PIN-alpha, where $p=1$ denotes a functional PIN-alpha that reduces $A$ below $A_{th}$, and $p=0$ denotes loss of function, resulting in $A \\ge A_{th}$. Let $c \\in \\{0,1\\}$ represent the functional status of the CUC-omega gene product, where $c=1$ denotes a functional protein and $c=0$ denotes loss of function.\n\nAuxin repression of CUC-omega transcription can be expressed by a gating function $f(A)$ defined by\n$$\nf(A) = \\begin{cases}\n1, & A < A_{th},\\\\\n0, & A \\ge A_{th}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe effective CUC-omega activity available to drive boundary formation is then\n$$\nE = c \\cdot f(A).\n$$\nBoundary formation requires CUC-omega activity, so we define boundary outcome $B$ as\n$$\nB = \\begin{cases}\n1, & E = 1,\\\\\n0, & E = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate genotypes:\n- Wild type: $p=1$ implies $A < A_{th}$, so $f(A)=1$. With $c=1$, we have $E=1 \\cdot 1=1$, hence $B=1$ (boundary forms).\n- pin-alpha single mutant: $p=0$ implies $A \\ge A_{th}$, so $f(A)=0$. With $c=1$, we have $E=1 \\cdot 0=0$, hence $B=0$ (boundary fails; fusion).\n- cuc-omega single mutant: $p=1$ implies $A < A_{th}$ and $f(A)=1$, but $c=0$ gives $E=0 \\cdot 1=0$, hence $B=0$ (boundary fails; fusion).\n- pin-alpha cuc-omega double mutant: $p=0$ implies $A \\ge A_{th}$ and $f(A)=0$, and $c=0$ gives $E=0 \\cdot 0=0$, hence $B=0$ (boundary fails; fusion).\n\nBecause boundary formation is strictly dependent on CUC-omega activity, loss of the downstream effector $c=0$ is epistatic to the upstream regulator $p$ in this linear pathway. Therefore, the double mutant phenotype is predicted to be identical to the cuc-omega single mutant (failure to form the boundary, resulting in fusion), matching option A rather than a rescue, a novel phenotype, or synergistic worsening.\n\nThus, the most likely phenotype of the pin-alpha cuc-omega double mutant is identical to that of the cuc-omega single mutant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708392"}, {"introduction": "Plant development often involves complex communication between different organs, such as roots and shoots. Distinguishing between a locally-controlled process and one regulated by a long-distance systemic signal is a common challenge for researchers. This final, advanced exercise puts you in the role of an experimental biologist, tasking you with interpreting a grafting experiment designed to resolve this very question for nitrate-dependent root growth [@problem_id:1708390]. This practice hones your ability to design and analyze experiments that test competing biological hypotheses.", "problem": "The architecture of a plant's root system is highly plastic and adapts to the availability of soil nutrients. For instance, in many plant species, high concentrations of nitrate in the soil are known to suppress the emergence of lateral roots from the primary root. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon.\n\nThe **Local-Autonomy Hypothesis** posits that root cells perceive the high external nitrate concentration and, in response, locally synthesize and accumulate cytokinin, a plant hormone known to inhibit lateral root emergence. In this model, the suppression is a root-autonomous process.\n\nThe **Systemic-Signal Hypothesis** proposes a long-distance communication route. In this model, the root perceives high nitrate and sends a signal (often called the \"nitrate-starvation signal\" is suppressed) to the shoot. The shoot, in response, synthesizes cytokinin and transports it downwards via the phloem to the root system, where it inhibits lateral root emergence.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, a series of grafting experiments is conducted using wild-type (WT) plants and a quadruple mutant, `ipt1,3,5,7`, which is severely deficient in the biosynthesis of cytokinin. For the purpose of this problem, assume the `ipt1,3,5,7` mutation primarily abolishes cytokinin production in the shoot, while cytokinin production in the root, although also reduced, is less critical for the systemic response.\n\nFour types of grafted plants are constructed (Scion / Rootstock): WT/WT, `ipt1,3,5,7`/`ipt1,3,5,7`, WT/`ipt1,3,5,7`, and `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT. All four types of grafts are grown on a growth medium containing a uniformly high concentration of nitrate. Let \"high density of emerged lateral roots\" describe a phenotype where suppression is absent, and \"low density of emerged lateral roots\" describe a phenotype where suppression is active.\n\nAssuming the **Systemic-Signal Hypothesis** is correct, which of the following outcomes would be observed for the lateral root emergence phenotypes of the two chimeric grafts?\n\nA. The `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT graft will exhibit a high density of emerged lateral roots, while the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` graft will exhibit a low density.\n\nB. The `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT graft will exhibit a low density of emerged lateral roots, while the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` graft will exhibit a high density.\n\nC. Both the `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT and the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` grafts will exhibit a high density of emerged lateral roots.\n\nD. Both the `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT and the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` grafts will exhibit a low density of emerged lateral roots.\n\nE. The experiment is inconclusive, as the lateral root phenotype would depend on auxin transport efficiency, which is not defined for the mutant.", "solution": "We are comparing two mechanistic hypotheses for nitrate-induced suppression of lateral root emergence: a local-autonomous model versus a systemic-signal model. The grafting experiment is designed to test whether shoot-derived cytokinin is required for suppression under uniformly high external nitrate.\n\nGiven the Systemic-Signal Hypothesis:\n- The root senses high nitrate and sends a signal to the shoot.\n- The shoot synthesizes cytokinin in response and transports it via the phloem to the root system.\n- Suppression of lateral root emergence in high nitrate thus depends critically on the shoot’s ability to produce cytokinin; local cytokinin production in the root is less critical for the systemic response (as stated).\n\nGenotypes and expectations for chimeric grafts:\n\n1) For the ipt1,3,5,7/WT graft (mutant scion on wild-type rootstock):\n- The scion (shoot) is deficient in cytokinin biosynthesis due to the ipt1,3,5,7 mutation, which primarily abolishes cytokinin production in the shoot.\n- Under high nitrate, the rootstock (WT) will send the signal to the shoot, but the mutant shoot cannot produce sufficient cytokinin.\n- Consequently, little to no cytokinin is transported back to the roots.\n- Without shoot-derived cytokinin, suppression fails, leading to a high density of emerged lateral roots.\n\n2) For the WT/ipt1,3,5,7 graft (wild-type scion on mutant rootstock):\n- The scion (shoot) is wild-type and capable of cytokinin biosynthesis.\n- Under high nitrate, the rootstock (ipt1,3,5,7) will send the signal to the shoot; the WT shoot produces cytokinin and delivers it to the roots via the phloem.\n- Root-local cytokinin production is less critical; the imported shoot-derived cytokinin is sufficient to suppress lateral root emergence.\n- Therefore, suppression is active, leading to a low density of emerged lateral roots.\n\nThese outcomes map directly onto option A: ipt1,3,5,7/WT shows high density, and WT/ipt1,3,5,7 shows low density. All other options contradict the central systemic prediction that the shoot genotype controls the presence of the inhibitory cytokinin signal under high nitrate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708390"}]}
