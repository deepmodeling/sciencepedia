{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The beautiful spiral patterns of leaves on a plant stem, known as phyllotaxy, are a classic example of mathematical order in biology. These arrangements are not random; they can be precisely described by a constant angle between successive leaves, the divergence angle. This exercise gives you hands-on practice in calculating this fundamental parameter from a set of simulated observations, connecting a simple geometric measurement to the complex developmental process of organ placement at the shoot apex [@problem_id:1697593].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the phyllotaxy of a genetically engineered strain of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The plant's leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. To quantify this pattern, the biologist identifies a leaf, which is labeled as leaf #0. Following the spiral of leaves up the stem, it is observed that the spiral makes exactly 5 complete rotations before a leaf is found directly above, and in the same vertical line as, leaf #0. This vertically aligned leaf is the 13th leaf to appear after leaf #0 in the developmental sequence (i.e., it is leaf #13). Assuming the angle between any two successive leaves is constant, calculate this angle, known as the divergence angle. Express your final answer in degrees, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let the constant divergence angle between successive leaves be $\\theta$ (measured in degrees). The angular position of leaf $n$ relative to leaf $0$ is $n\\theta$ modulo a full turn. For a leaf to lie directly above leaf $0$, its angular displacement must equal an integer number of full turns, i.e., an integer multiple of $360^{\\circ}$.\n\nGiven that the leaf directly above leaf $0$ is leaf $13$ and that exactly $5$ full rotations occur before this alignment, we have the condition\n$$\n13\\theta = 5 \\times 360^{\\circ}.\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta$ gives\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{5 \\times 360^{\\circ}}{13} = \\frac{1800^{\\circ}}{13}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1800}{13} \\approx 138.461538\\ldots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields\n$$\n\\theta \\approx 138.5.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{138.5}$$", "id": "1697593"}, {"introduction": "While phyllotaxy describes the *what* of leaf arrangement, developmental biologists are keen to understand the *how*. A central player in this process is the plant hormone auxin. This practice presents a thought experiment where you will predict the outcome of chemically blocking auxin transport, a common technique to probe developmental mechanisms [@problem_id:1697582]. Your task is to apply your knowledge of auxin's role in organogenesis to deduce the resulting phenotype at the shoot apex, sharpening your ability to link molecular processes to visible anatomical changes.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the mechanisms of phyllotaxy, the ordered arrangement of leaves around a plant stem. The researcher grows a batch of wild-type seedlings of a model plant species under controlled conditions. This species normally exhibits a spiral phyllotactic pattern. After the seedlings have developed a few true leaves, a lanolin paste containing a potent auxin transport inhibitor is continuously applied to the shoot apex of each plant. The shoot apex contains the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM), the population of stem cells responsible for generating all above-ground organs, a process known as organogenesis. The experiment is observed for several weeks.\n\nAssuming the inhibitor is effective and precisely targeted, which of the following descriptions represents the most likely phenotype that will be observed at the shoot apex of the treated seedlings?\n\nA. New leaves are initiated, but their arrangement is chaotic and non-periodic, completely losing the regular spiral pattern.\n\nB. The shoot apical meristem continues to grow but fails to initiate any new leaf primordia, resulting in an elongated, naked stem apex, a phenotype often called \"pin-formed\".\n\nC. The shoot apical meristem immediately converts into a terminal flower, ceasing all vegetative growth.\n\nD. New leaves are initiated at a faster rate than in untreated plants, but they are significantly smaller and malformed.\n\nE. The rate of leaf initiation remains unchanged, but the internodes (the stem segments between leaves) fail to elongate, resulting in a highly compressed, bushy phenotype.", "solution": "Key principle: Leaf primordia at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) are initiated where local maxima of auxin concentration form in the peripheral zone. These maxima arise from polar auxin transport mediated by PIN-family auxin efflux carriers. The spatial self-organization of auxin maxima and depletion zones underlies periodic organ initiation and spiral phyllotaxis.\n\nIf a potent auxin transport inhibitor (such as NPA or TIBA) is continuously and precisely applied to the SAM, it blocks polar auxin transport by inhibiting PIN-mediated efflux and recycling. This prevents the formation of the auxin maxima required to specify founder cells for new primordia.\n\nConsequent prediction: Without auxin maxima, organogenesis at the SAM fails. However, the SAM remains indeterminate and mitotically active, continuing to produce stem tissue without initiating new lateral organs. Morphologically, this yields an elongated, naked stem apex lacking newly formed primordia, commonly termed a \"pin-formed\" phenotype. This phenotype is characteristic both of pin1 mutants and of wild-type plants treated with auxin transport inhibitors targeted to the apex.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is unlikely: a complete or strong block of polar auxin transport abolishes maxima rather than producing chaotic, non-periodic initiation; the typical outcome is failure to initiate, not random positioning.\n- B matches the expected outcome: continued meristem growth with a failure to initiate new leaf primordia, producing a pin-formed apex.\n- C is incorrect: conversion to a terminal flower involves meristem identity and flowering-time pathways, not simply auxin transport inhibition at the SAM.\n- D contradicts mechanism: inhibiting auxin transport would not speed up initiation; it suppresses primordium formation.\n- E is inconsistent: maintaining the normal rate of leaf initiation requires intact auxin maxima; moreover, the phenotype described pertains more to altered internode elongation, which is not the primary effect of apex-targeted auxin transport inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is the pin-formed apex described in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1697582"}, {"introduction": "Once a leaf primordium is initiated, it must undergo morphogenesis to acquire its characteristic flat shape. This is achieved by establishing three fundamental developmental axes that guide its growth. In this problem, you will act as a geneticist, analyzing a mutant plant that fails to form flat leaves [@problem_id:1697564]. By observing the abnormal leaf shape, you can deduce which of the major axes—proximal-distal, medial-lateral, or adaxial-abaxial—is compromised, thereby practicing a core skill in developmental genetics: inferring gene function from phenotype.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying a novel recessive mutant in the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The wild-type (normal) plants produce leaves that are flat, planar structures with morphologically distinct upper and lower surfaces. In contrast, the homozygous recessive mutants exhibit a striking phenotype where their leaves fail to flatten and instead grow into radially symmetric, trumpet-shaped structures. From this observation, the biologist seeks to identify the fundamental developmental axis that is primarily disrupted in these mutants.\n\nThe principal axes that pattern a developing leaf are:\n- The Proximal-Distal (P-D) axis, which runs from the leaf's base to its tip.\n- The Medial-Lateral (M-L) axis, which runs from the central midvein to the leaf's outer margin.\n- The Adaxial-Abaxial (Ad-Ab) axis, which establishes the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces of the leaf.\n\nWhich of the following developmental axes is most likely compromised in the trumpet-leaf mutant?\n\nA. Proximal-Distal (P-D) axis\n\nB. Adaxial-Abaxial (Ad-Ab) axis\n\nC. Medial-Lateral (M-L) axis\n\nD. Apical-Basal axis of the whole plant\n\nE. Radial-Tangential axis of the stem", "solution": "The key observation is that wild-type leaves are dorsoventrally polarized, with distinct upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces, which is essential for lamina outgrowth into a flat, planar structure. In contrast, the mutant produces radially symmetric, trumpet-shaped leaves, indicating a loss of dorsoventral (adaxial-abaxial) polarity and consequent failure to form a flattened lamina.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. In leaf development, three principal axes pattern the organ: proximal-distal (base to tip), medial-lateral (midvein to margin), and adaxial-abaxial (upper versus lower surfaces).\n2. Proper adaxial-abaxial patterning is necessary for lamina expansion; juxtaposition of adaxial and abaxial domains drives blade outgrowth. When this axis is disrupted, leaves fail to develop a planar blade and instead become radialized structures (e.g., needle-, tube-, or trumpet-like), reflecting loss of distinct upper and lower identities.\n3. The described phenotype—radially symmetric, trumpet-shaped leaves—matches classic outcomes of adaxial-abaxial polarity defects (e.g., in mutants affecting HD-ZIP III, KANADI, or other polarity determinants), where dorsoventral identity is lost and the organ becomes cylindrical or trumpet-like.\n4. Disruption of the proximal-distal axis would primarily affect formation of base versus tip, often leading to truncations or abnormal elongation, not radialization. Disruption of the medial-lateral axis would primarily affect leaf width or margin formation, not conversion to a radial tube. The apical-basal axis of the whole plant and the radial-tangential axis of the stem are not the primary axes that specify leaf dorsoventral polarity and would not specifically produce radialized leaf organs.\n5. Therefore, the fundamental axis primarily compromised is the adaxial-abaxial axis.\n\nNo inconsistencies or mistakes are detected in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1697564"}]}
