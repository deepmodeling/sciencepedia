{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The discovery of homeotic genes, such as the *Hox* gene family, revealed how a small number of master regulators orchestrate an organism's body plan. This practice problem explores the dramatic consequences of misexpressing one of these genes, a phenomenon known as a homeotic transformation. By predicting the outcome of a hypothetical mutation [@problem_id:1487558], you will apply the core principle that these genes confer a specific \"identity\" to developmental modules, a concept fundamental to understanding a vast range of evolutionary changes.", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of insect, *Coleoptera imaginarium*, the body plan is segmented along an anterior-posterior axis into a head, a three-segment thorax (T1, T2, T3), and an abdomen. The development of each segment's unique structures is controlled by a family of homeotic genes.\n\nOne of these genes, which we will call *Mesothorax-identity* (*Mti*), is normally expressed exclusively in the second thoracic segment (T2). The function of the *Mti* gene is to direct the development of the primary pair of wings and a pair of walking legs characteristic of the T2 segment. The head contains a segment which, under normal development, gives rise to a pair of sensory antennae.\n\nA geneticist discovers a dominant, gain-of-function mutation in the regulatory region of the *Mti* gene. This mutation causes the *Mti* gene to be ectopically expressed in the developing head segment that normally forms antennae, in addition to its normal expression in the T2 segment. Assuming the resulting organism is viable and develops to the adult stage, what is the most likely morphological outcome of this mutation?\n\nA. The insect will develop an additional, non-functional head where the T2 segment should be.\n\nB. The T2 segment will fail to develop legs and wings, as the gene product is diluted by being expressed in two locations.\n\nC. The insect will be born without antennae, as the ectopic gene expression is lethal to the cells of the antennal imaginal disc.\n\nD. The insect will develop a pair of legs on its head in place of the normal antennae.\n\nE. The insect will develop a second pair of wings on its head.", "solution": "Homeotic genes specify segment identity along the anterior-posterior axis; when such a gene is ectopically expressed (gain-of-function in a novel domain), it can homeotically transform the affected segment toward the identity normally specified by that gene. The given gene, Mti, is normally expressed in T2 and directs the development of T2-specific structures: the primary pair of wings and a pair of walking legs. The mutation causes Mti to be expressed ectopically in the head segment that normally forms antennae, without removing its normal expression in T2.\n\nBy the principle of homeotic transformation, ectopic Mti in the antennal segment will impose T2 identity programs onto the antennal primordium. In insects, the antennal appendage is developmentally homologous to a leg primordium; ectopic expression of a T2 identity gene in the antennal disc is known to convert antennae into legs, as classically observed for Antennapedia misexpression. There is no reason to expect loss of function in T2 due to “dilution,” since regulatory gain-of-function in the head does not necessarily reduce transcription in T2. Ectopic expression is not inherently lethal to the antennal disc; rather, it redirects fate. Although T2 identity includes wings, wings originate from a dorsal thoracic wing field that is absent from the head; wing development requires additional regional selector inputs and imaginal disc context that the head does not provide. Therefore, the realistic transformation is legs in place of antennae, not a second pair of wings or an extra head.\n\nThus, the most likely morphological outcome is the development of a pair of legs on the head in place of normal antennae.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1487558"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of genes specifying segment identity, this exercise examines how large-scale evolutionary changes in body plans can occur. We will contrast a hypothetical ancient arthropod with uniform segments to a more recent descendant with specialized body regions [@problem_id:1686111]. This thought experiment challenges you to connect the evolution of morphology, known as tagmosis, to changes in the spatial regulation of developmental genes, illustrating a key evo-devo mechanism where evolution acts by tinkering with the deployment of an ancient genetic toolkit.", "problem": "An evolutionary developmental biologist is studying the body plans of two hypothetical arthropod fossils. The first, *Pansoma uniformis*, is an ancient species with a long body composed of numerous, nearly identical segments, each bearing a similar pair of simple, unspecialized appendages. This body plan is known as homonomous segmentation. The second, *Articulus novellus*, is a more recent, descendant species that exhibits clear body regionalization, or tagmosis. *A. novellus* has a distinct head with specialized feeding mouthparts, a thorax with robust walking legs, and an abdomen with smaller, paddle-like swimmerets.\n\nIt is established from genetic remnants that both species possess a similar core set of homeotic genes (commonly known as *Hox* genes), which are crucial for determining the identity of segments along the anterior-posterior axis. Based on the principles of evolutionary developmental biology, which of the following statements most accurately describes the likely difference in *Hox* gene expression that accounts for the morphological evolution from *P. uniformis* to *A. novellus*?\n\nA. *A. novellus* likely evolved a greater number of *Hox* genes in its genome compared to *P. uniformis*, with each new gene specifying a new body region.\n\nB. The expression domains of individual *Hox* genes in *A. novellus* are likely more restricted and sharply defined, creating distinct molecular addresses for the head, thorax, and abdomen, whereas in *P. uniformis*, these domains were broader and more overlapping.\n\nC. The *Hox* genes in *P. uniformis* were expressed in a complex, modular pattern, which was simplified in *A. novellus* to produce its more streamlined form.\n\nD. The primary difference is in the *Hox* protein function; the proteins in *A. novellus* evolved new biochemical activities, while their spatial expression patterns remained largely the same as in *P. uniformis*.\n\nE. *Hox* gene expression was likely suppressed in all but the rearmost segments of *A. novellus*, with the anterior specialized segments developing through a *Hox*-independent pathway.", "solution": "We identify the key evo-devo principle: segment identity along the anterior-posterior axis in arthropods is specified by spatially and temporally regulated expression of Hox genes. Morphological diversification such as tagmosis typically arises from changes in the spatial domains (boundaries and levels) and combinatorial patterns of Hox expression and in the cis-regulatory elements of their downstream targets, rather than from changes in Hox gene number or protein biochemical function.\n\nGiven that both species possess a similar core Hox set, large differences in gene number are unlikely to be responsible. Homonomous segmentation in Pansoma uniformis suggests broad, overlapping Hox domains that do not set sharply distinct regional identities, producing many similar segments with unspecialized appendages. In contrast, the distinct head, thorax, and abdomen in Articulus novellus imply sharpened and more restricted Hox expression domains and shifts in anterior/posterior boundaries, yielding clearer combinatorial Hox codes that specify regional morphologies (e.g., specialized mouthparts, walking legs, swimmerets).\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A: Proposes increased Hox gene number in A. novellus. This contradicts the premise of a similar core Hox set and runs counter to the common evo-devo pattern where morphological change arises without expanding Hox gene number.\n- B: Proposes more restricted and sharply defined Hox domains in A. novellus establishing distinct molecular addresses for tagmata, versus broader, overlapping domains in P. uniformis. This matches known mechanisms driving tagmosis via boundary shifts and refined combinatorial codes.\n- C: Claims P. uniformis had complex modular Hox patterns simplified in A. novellus. This reverses expectations; homonomy correlates with less differentiated Hox patterning, while tagmosis reflects more refined, modular expression.\n- D: Attributes change primarily to Hox protein biochemical function with unchanged spatial patterns. Hox proteins are highly conserved; differences usually arise from expression domain shifts and changes in downstream cis-regulatory logic rather than new protein activities.\n- E: Suggests Hox suppression in all but rearmost segments. This is inconsistent with the requirement of Hox inputs for thoracic and abdominal identities; only the extreme anterior region is typically Hox-free.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the evolution of tagmosis in A. novellus is best explained by more restricted and sharply defined Hox expression domains that create distinct regional identities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1686111"}, {"introduction": "Phenotypes are not always rigidly determined by genes; they can also be shaped by the environment through phenotypic plasticity. This problem introduces a quantitative model to explore how a discrete developmental outcome, such as having wings or not, can arise from a continuous underlying trait that is sensitive to environmental conditions [@problem_id:1926730].

This process is mediated by an internal signaling molecule, which we'll call \"Alatogen\". A larva will develop into a winged (alate) adult if and only if the peak concentration of Alatogen, denoted by $C$, exceeds a critical threshold, $T$.\n\nScientific investigation reveals that the peak Alatogen concentration in a larva is a direct linear function of its body mass, $m$, at a specific critical developmental point.
