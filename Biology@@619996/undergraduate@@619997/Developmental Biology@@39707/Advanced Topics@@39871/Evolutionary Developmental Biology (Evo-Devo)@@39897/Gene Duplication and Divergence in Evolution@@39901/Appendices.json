{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the evolutionary history of a gene family begins with building its phylogenetic tree, which acts as a map of its past. This map, however, contains different kinds of branching points: those representing the split of species (speciation) and those representing the duplication of a gene within a single lineage. This exercise teaches the fundamental skill of distinguishing between these events by using sequence similarity as a proxy for evolutionary time. By analyzing the classic example of the globin gene family, you will practice applying the core definitions of orthologs and paralogs to deduce the correct evolutionary timeline [@problem_id:1931124].", "problem": "Molecular phylogenetic analysis is performed on the globin gene family in humans and chimpanzees. The analysis reveals that the nucleotide sequence of the human alpha-globin gene is significantly more similar to the sequence of the chimpanzee alpha-globin gene than it is to the sequence of the human beta-globin gene. Genes that arise from a speciation event are called orthologs, while genes that arise from a gene duplication event within a single genome are called paralogs.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary scenarios provides the most accurate explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The human and chimpanzee lineages first diverged from a common ancestor. Subsequently, an ancestral globin gene underwent independent duplication events in each of the two lineages, giving rise to distinct alpha- and beta-globin genes in both humans and chimpanzees.\n\nB. A gene duplication event occurred in a common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, creating an ancestral alpha-globin gene and an ancestral beta-globin gene. Later, a speciation event separated the human and chimpanzee lineages, and the two pre-existing genes were inherited and evolved separately in each new lineage.\n\nC. The alpha-globin gene in the chimpanzee lineage and the beta-globin gene in the human lineage evolved independently from different ancestral genes to perform similar oxygen-transport functions, a process known as convergent evolution.\n\nD. Following the speciation event that separated humans and chimpanzees, the alpha-globin gene was transferred from the chimpanzee lineage to the human lineage via a horizontal gene transfer event, replacing the original human alpha-globin gene.\n\nE. The beta-globin gene in humans has accumulated mutations at a much faster rate than the alpha-globin gene, causing it to appear more divergent, even though the duplication that created it occurred after the human-chimpanzee speciation.", "solution": "We are given that the human alpha-globin gene is significantly more similar to the chimpanzee alpha-globin gene than it is to the human beta-globin gene, along with the definitions that orthologs arise by speciation and paralogs arise by gene duplication within a genome. The key molecular evolutionary principle to apply is the molecular clock: for homologous sequences evolving at approximately constant substitution rates, the expected sequence divergence is proportional to the time since their last common ancestral gene.\n\nLet $D(x,y)$ denote the expected pairwise sequence divergence between genes $x$ and $y$. Under a simple clock, for two lineages with per-site substitution rate $\\mu$, the expected divergence satisfies\n$$\nD(x,y) = 2 \\mu t,\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the time since their most recent common ancestral gene. More generally, if rates differ between gene lineages, we can write\n$$\nD(x,y) = (\\mu_{x} + \\mu_{y}) t,\n$$\nbut the qualitative conclusion remains that, all else equal, shorter divergence times yield lower $D$ (greater similarity).\n\nThe observation states\n$$\nD(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}) < D(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\beta_{\\text{human}}).\n$$\nThis inequality indicates that the time since divergence of the two alpha-globin orthologs across species is less than the time since divergence of the alpha- and beta-globin paralogs within human:\n$$\nt\\big(\\alpha_{\\text{human}} \\text{ vs } \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}\\big) < t\\big(\\alpha_{\\text{human}} \\text{ vs } \\beta_{\\text{human}}\\big),\n$$\nassuming comparable rates across these globin genes.\n\nThis time-ordering is exactly what occurs if a gene duplication producing ancestral alpha- and beta-globin occurred before the human–chimpanzee speciation. Let $t_{D}$ denote the time of duplication and $t_{S}$ the time of speciation, measured backward from the present. If the duplication precedes speciation, then $t_{D} > t_{S}$, which implies\n$$\nD(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}) \\propto t_{S} < t_{D} \\propto D(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\beta_{\\text{human}}),\n$$\nmatching the observation. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNow evaluate the alternatives:\n\n- A: Speciation first, then independent duplications in each lineage. In this case, within human, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ would have diverged only since the human-specific duplication time $t_{D,\\text{human}}$, which is more recent than $t_{S}$, so we would expect\n$$\nD(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\beta_{\\text{human}}) \\propto t_{D,\\text{human}} < t_{S} \\propto D(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}),\n$$\npredicting higher similarity within human than across species—the opposite of what is observed. Hence A is inconsistent with the data under a clock.\n\n- C: Convergent evolution implies similar function but does not explain extensive sequence similarity across the entire gene typical of shared ancestry, and it does not account for the clear orthology between alpha-globin genes in human and chimpanzee inferred from the pattern.\n\n- D: Horizontal gene transfer of a nuclear gene between mammalian lineages is exceedingly unlikely and unnecessary to explain the observed ortholog-paralog similarity pattern.\n\n- E: Claiming a much faster mutation rate in human beta-globin while also asserting the duplication occurred after speciation implies $t_{D} < t_{S}$. That would typically predict lower within-human divergence unless rate acceleration is extreme and contrived; moreover, if the duplication were post-speciation, the presence of beta-globin in both species would require independent events. This is not the most accurate or parsimonious explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and parsimonious explanation is that a duplication occurred in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees to produce ancestral alpha- and beta-globin genes, followed by a speciation event, with subsequent independent evolution of each orthologous pair in the two lineages.

One common outcome is subfunctionalization, where the duplicates divide the ancestral gene's original jobs between them. This thought experiment walks you through a clear, step-by-step example of how this process unfolds through the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. You will see how simple, degenerative mutations in regulatory regions can lead to a stable outcome where both gene copies are preserved, each specializing in a subset of the original function [@problem_id:1689735].", "problem": "In an ancestral vertebrate species, a single master regulatory gene, known as `Regulator-X`, plays a crucial role in embryonic development. The `Regulator-X` gene contains two distinct cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in its non-coding region. The first, `CRE_A`, drives gene expression in the developing neural tube. The second, `CRE_B`, drives expression in the developing limb buds. Thus, the single `Regulator-X` gene is expressed in both of these tissues.\n\nA whole-genome duplication event occurred in the lineage leading to a modern descendant species. This event copied the entire `Regulator-X` gene locus, creating two identical paralogous genes, which we will call `Regulator-X_alpha` and `Regulator-X_beta`. Initially, both paralogs retained both `CRE_A` and `CRE_B` and were expressed in both the neural tube and limb buds.\n\nOver millions of years of evolution, random mutations accumulated in both paralogs. In the `Regulator-X_alpha` gene, a mutation occurred that inactivated `CRE_A` without affecting `CRE_B`. Conversely, in the `Regulator-X_beta` gene, a different mutation inactivated `CRE_B` without affecting `CRE_A`. As a result, in the modern species, `Regulator-X_alpha` is expressed only in the limb buds, and `Regulator-X_beta` is expressed only in the neural tube. Both genes remain essential for the organism's survival.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the evolutionary process that led to the divergence of the `Regulator-X_alpha` and `Regulator-X_beta` genes?\n\nA.

Both genes remain essential because together they reconstitute the full ancestral expression pattern; neither copy alone covers both tissues.\n\nThis evolutionary pattern is most accurately described as subfunctionalization, specifically the duplication-degeneration-complementation model, in which each paralog retains a complementary subset of the ancestral gene’s functions due to degenerative mutations in regulatory elements.\n\nRuling out alternatives:\n- Neofunctionalization would require a novel function not present in the ancestor; here, no new function arises, only partitioning of existing functions.\n- Orthologous speciation concerns divergence of genes across species, not paralogs within a species.\n- Nonfunctionalization would render one copy a pseudogene; here, both copies are functional and essential.\n- Gene conservation would mean both paralogs retain all ancestral functions; this is contradicted by the complementary losses observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is subfunctionalization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1689735"}, {"introduction": "While dividing old functions is a common fate for duplicated genes, the most exciting outcome is arguably the evolution of a completely new one—neofunctionalization.

A developmental biologist is studying the long-term consequences of this event on gene function.

This duplication event created two paralogous copies of the gene, now known as `DevCore-A` and `DevCore-B`.\n\nTo investigate the selective pressures that have acted on these paralogs since their divergence, the researcher sequences both genes and calculates the rate of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site ($K_a$) and the rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ($K_s$).
