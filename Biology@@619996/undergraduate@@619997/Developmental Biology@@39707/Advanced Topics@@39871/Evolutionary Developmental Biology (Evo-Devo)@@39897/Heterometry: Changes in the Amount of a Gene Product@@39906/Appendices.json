This process is sensitive to the number of functional ribosomes within developing cells. The gene encoding Ribosomal Protein L24 (Rpl24) is critical for ribosome assembly. A heterozygous null mutation in this gene ($Rpl24^{+/-}$) results in the production of only 50% of the normal amount of Rpl24 protein compared to a wild-type ($Rpl24^{+/+}$) individual.\n\nConsider two distinct cell populations crucial for skeletal development, each with its own requirements for viability and differentiation:\n1.  **Craniofacial Chondrocytes**: These cells form the cartilage of the jaw. For normal development, they must maintain a protein synthesis rate, $R$, at or above a critical threshold, $T_{\\text{chondro}}$.
