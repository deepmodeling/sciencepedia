{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our exploration begins with a foundational thought experiment that shaped our understanding of insect development. By considering the surgical removal of the corpora allata, the glands that produce Juvenile Hormone ($JH$), you can deduce its primary function in governing the molting process. This practice challenges you to predict the developmental consequences of eliminating this key signal, revealing its crucial role in maintaining the juvenile state and preventing premature metamorphosis [@problem_id:1694037].", "problem": "In holometabolous insects, such as moths and butterflies, the transition from a juvenile larva to a reproductive adult is a tightly regulated process called metamorphosis. This development is primarily orchestrated by two hormones. The first, ecdysone, is released periodically and triggers the act of molting (shedding the exoskeleton). The second, Juvenile Hormone (JH), is produced by a pair of glands called the corpora allata. The concentration of JH in the insect's hemolymph (blood) determines the outcome of a molt. When JH levels are high, a molt results in a larger larva. When JH levels fall, an ecdysone-triggered molt leads to pupation, and a subsequent molt in the complete absence of JH leads to the emergence of the adult.\n\nImagine a developmental biologist conducts a classic experiment on a second-instar larva of a moth species that normally has five larval instars before pupating. The biologist carefully performs microsurgery to remove the corpora allata from this young larva, ensuring the larva survives the procedure. Based on the established principles of insect hormonal control, what is the most likely developmental fate of this second-instar larva?\n\nA. It will undergo a premature molt into a small pupa, which will then develop into a miniature adult.\n\nB. It will be unable to molt again and will remain trapped in the second-instar state until it dies.\n\nC. It will molt into a third-instar larva, but then die because it cannot produce essential hormones for later life stages.\n\nD. It will continue to grow and molt into a giant larva, far exceeding the size of a normal fifth-instar larva, but will never pupate.\n\nE. It will immediately transform into an adult form, completely skipping the pupal stage.", "solution": "The control of metamorphosis in holometabolous insects depends on two endocrine signals:\n1) Pulses of ecdysone from the prothoracic glands initiate molts.\n2) The titer of Juvenile Hormone (JH), supplied by the corpora allata, determines the nature of the molt:\n- High JH during an ecdysone pulse yields a larva-to-larva molt (another instar).\n- Reduced JH during an ecdysone pulse yields a larva-to-pupa molt (pupation).\n- Absence of JH during an ecdysone pulse at the pupal stage yields a pupa-to-adult molt.\n\nMicrosurgical removal of the corpora allata (allatectomy) in a larva eliminates the source of JH, so the hemolymph JH level falls to effectively zero. Ecdysone pulses will still occur because their production is not dependent on the corpora allata. Given the developmental program of holometabola, a larval epidermis without JH does not skip directly to the adult form; instead, at the next ecdysone pulse it differentiates into a pupa (precocious pupation). Because the animal is only a second-instar larva at the time of allatectomy, it has not accumulated the mass typical of a final-instar larva; therefore, the resulting pupa will be small. At the subsequent ecdysone pulse, still in the continued absence of JH (no corpora allata), the pupa will undergo the pupal-to-adult molt, producing a miniature adult.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is consistent with the endocrine logic and classic experiments: removal of JH leads to precocious pupation and then a small adult.\n- B is incorrect because molting is initiated by ecdysone, not JH; removing JH does not prevent molting.\n- C is incorrect because, without JH, the next molt will not produce another larval instar; it will produce a pupa.\n- D is incorrect because continual larval growth with repeated larval molts requires sustained high JH; removal of the corpora allata does the opposite.\n- E is incorrect because holometabolous larvae do not molt directly to adults; the pupal stage intervenes, and the absence of JH specifically permits the pupal-to-adult molt after pupation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate is a premature molt into a small pupa, followed by development into a miniature adult.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1694037"}, {"introduction": "Scientific knowledge is built upon well-designed experiments, and this practice shifts our focus from simply knowing what hormones do to understanding how we can prove it. You will evaluate several proposed experiments to determine which one provides the most direct and valid test for the necessity of the prothoracic gland, the source of the molting hormone ecdysone. Successfully navigating this problem requires not just biological knowledge, but also a sharp eye for experimental logic, including the critical role of controls [@problem_id:1694065].", "problem": "An entomologist is studying the hormonal control of development in a newly discovered moth species, *Lepidoptera hypothetica*. This insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, with a life cycle consisting of egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. The larval stage involves several instars, with the transition from one larval instar to the next being termed a \"larval-larval molt\". The entomologist wishes to design an experiment to test the specific hypothesis that the prothoracic gland is necessary for a larval-larval molt to occur. The experiments will be performed on third-instar larvae that are midway through their feeding period, a time when they are receptive to hormonal signals but not yet committed to pupation.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and corresponding predicted outcomes provides the most direct and valid test of this hypothesis?\n\nA. The prothoracic gland is surgically removed (a procedure called extirpation) from a group of larvae. The predicted outcome is that the larvae will undergo a premature molt into miniature pupae, as the gland that maintains the larval state has been removed.\n\nB. An active prothoracic gland from a molting donor larva is transplanted into the abdomen of a host larva that has had its own prothoracic gland removed. The predicted outcome is that the host larva will molt normally into the next larval instar, demonstrating the gland's function.\n\nC. The prothoracic gland is extirpated from one group of larvae (experimental group). A second group of larvae undergoes a sham operation where an incision is made, but the gland is left intact (control group). The predicted outcome is that the experimental larvae will fail to initiate the next molt, while the control larvae will molt normally into the next larval instar.\n\nD. The corpora allata, glands known to produce Juvenile Hormone (JH), are extirpated from a group of larvae. The predicted outcome is that the larvae will fail to molt into the next instar because a critical molting hormone is now absent.\n\nE. The prothoracic gland is extirpated from a group of larvae, and these larvae are then continuously injected with a high concentration of Juvenile Hormone (JH). The predicted outcome is that the larvae will successfully undergo a larval-larval molt, as JH is the primary hormone that triggers molting.", "solution": "The biological hypothesis is that the prothoracic gland is necessary for a larval-larval molt in third-instar larvae. In holometabolous insects, molting is triggered by ecdysteroids (commonly ecdysone) synthesized by the prothoracic gland under the control of prothoracicotropic hormone. Juvenile Hormone (JH), produced by the corpora allata, does not trigger molting; instead, it determines the nature of the molt: in the presence of JH, an ecdysteroid pulse yields a larval-larval molt; in the absence of JH, an ecdysteroid pulse yields a metamorphic molt (larva to pupa or pupa to adult). Therefore, a valid test of necessity for the prothoracic gland must remove its function and show that molting fails, with appropriate controls for surgical effects.\n\nEvaluate each option against this mechanism and the requirement to test necessity directly:\n- Option A removes the prothoracic gland but predicts premature pupation. This prediction is incorrect: removing the prothoracic gland eliminates ecdysteroid production, thereby preventing the initiation of any molt. Moreover, the assertion that the prothoracic gland maintains the larval state is false; JH maintains the larval state.\n- Option B performs extirpation and then rescues with a transplanted active gland. While this can demonstrate sufficiency of the gland (and rescue after loss), it is less direct for testing necessity and lacks explicit sham controls to account for surgical effects. It is not the most direct and valid test of necessity compared to a controlled extirpation versus sham.\n- Option C extirpates the prothoracic gland in an experimental group and performs a sham operation in a control group, predicting that experimental larvae fail to initiate the next molt while controls molt normally. This directly tests necessity with an appropriate control, aligning with the established role of the prothoracic gland in producing ecdysteroids that initiate molting.\n- Option D removes the corpora allata and predicts failure to molt. This is incorrect: without JH, the next ecdysteroid pulse still triggers a molt, but it becomes a metamorphic (larva-to-pupa) molt rather than a larval-larval molt.\n- Option E removes the prothoracic gland and injects JH, predicting a successful larval-larval molt. This is incorrect because JH does not initiate molting; ecdysteroids do. Without the prothoracic gland, there is no ecdysteroid pulse, so no molt occurs, regardless of JH levels.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and valid experimental design and predicted outcome that tests the necessity of the prothoracic gland for a larval-larval molt is the controlled extirpation versus sham in Option C, with failure to molt in the experimental group and normal larval-larval molt in the control group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1694065"}, {"introduction": "In our final practice, you will step into the role of a research scientist faced with a complex biological puzzle. This advanced problem presents data from a series of hypothetical genetic and parabiosis experiments designed to unravel how an insect decides when to pupate. Your task is to synthesize these diverse findings into a single, coherent regulatory model, demonstrating how organisms integrate multiple signals—from the brain, fat body, and endocrine glands—to orchestrate major life-history transitions [@problem_id:1694075].", "problem": "In developmental biology, a central question is how an organism coordinates growth with maturation. In insects, the transition from larva to pupa is a critical developmental checkpoint. A research team is investigating a hypothetical regulatory network in a model insect, *Insecta speculativa*, that controls the onset of pupation. They propose that this network involves signals from the brain, the fat body (a metabolic and endocrine organ), and the prothoracic gland (PG), which produces the molting hormone ecdysone. To test their models, they perform a series of experiments.\n\nThe \"critical weight\" is defined as the minimum larval mass at which a larva, if starved, will still successfully pupate. Before reaching this weight, a starved larva will die without pupating. The team uses advanced genetic tools, including a system for tissue-specific gene silencing via RNA interference (RNAi), and classical surgical techniques like parabiosis (surgically joining two individuals to create a shared circulatory system).\n\nBelow are the results from their key experiments:\n\n1.  **Parabiosis I:** A small, \"pre-critical weight\" larva is joined in parabiosis with a large, \"post-critical weight\" larva. Both larvae are continuously fed. **Result:** Both individuals pupate prematurely, synchronized with each other.\n\n2.  **Parabiosis II:** A small, \"pre-critical weight\" larva is joined in parabiosis with a large, \"post-critical weight\" larva whose brain has been surgically removed (decapitated). **Result:** Neither larva pupates, and the pre-critical weight larva eventually dies of starvation-like symptoms despite the shared circulation with the well-fed partner.\n\n3.  **Genetic Manipulation I:** The researchers identify a candidate gene, *fatinhibin*, which encodes a small peptide secreted from the fat body. They use RNAi to specifically silence *fatinhibin* expression only in the fat body throughout development. **Result:** These larvae initiate pupation at a significantly smaller size and weight, well below the normal critical weight.\n\n4.  **Genetic Manipulation II:** The brain of *Insecta speculativa* secretes Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), which is known to have a receptor on the prothoracic gland. The researchers use RNAi to specifically silence the *PTTH receptor* gene only in the prothoracic gland. **Result:** The larvae grow to an exceptionally large size, far exceeding the normal mass for pupation, but fail to pupate and eventually die.\n\n5.  **Genetic Manipulation III:** The researchers repeat the experiment from (3), silencing *fatinhibin* in the fat body. However, this time they also silence the *PTTH receptor* in the prothoracic gland of the same animals. **Result:** The larvae do not pupate prematurely. Instead, like the larvae in experiment (4), they grow very large and fail to pupate.\n\nBased on the collective evidence from these five experiments, which of the following models provides the most complete and accurate explanation for the control of pupation in *Insecta speculativa*?\n\nA. The fat body produces Fatinhibin, which tonically suppresses ecdysone synthesis in the prothoracic gland. After the larva reaches critical weight, the brain releases PTTH, which acts on the prothoracic gland to overcome the Fatinhibin-mediated suppression.\n\nB. The attainment of critical weight triggers the fat body to cease its production of Fatinhibin. The absence of this inhibitor is the primary signal that allows the prothoracic gland to begin ecdysone synthesis. The role of brain-derived PTTH is to stimulate the fat body to stop producing Fatinhibin.\n\nC. The prothoracic gland is stimulated to produce ecdysone by a nutritional signal directly from the fat body. Fatinhibin is an independent inhibitor produced by the brain that prevents premature pupation, and PTTH is a hormone that neutralizes Fatinhibin in the circulatory system.\n\nD. PTTH from the brain is the primary and sole activator of the prothoracic gland. Fatinhibin from the fat body acts to inhibit the release of PTTH from the brain, and this inhibition is relieved once the larva reaches critical weight.\n\nE. The fat body produces Fatinhibin, which acts as a growth-promoting factor. The brain releases PTTH after critical weight is reached, which binds to Fatinhibin in circulation, inactivating it and thereby allowing the prothoracic gland to initiate pupation.", "solution": "We define the following elements and their putative actions based on the experiments: a brain-derived activator (PTTH) that signals to the prothoracic gland (PG) via its receptor to stimulate ecdysone production and pupation, and a fat body-derived peptide (Fatinhibin) that inhibits premature pupation. We infer the direction and site of action by testing consistency of each model with the five experimental outcomes.\n\nFirst, necessary conditions deduced from experiments:\n- From Parabiosis I, a pre-critical larva joined to a post-critical larva with an intact brain shows that both pupate prematurely and synchronously. This requires a circulating pro-pupation signal that can act on both individuals and is sufficient to override the pre-critical larva’s normal block. The known such factor is PTTH, which circulates and acts on the PG. The synchronization is best explained by a shared PTTH pulse. This also implies that any inhibitory signal from the pre-critical larva cannot prevent pupation when adequate PTTH is present.\n- From Parabiosis II, pairing a pre-critical larva with a decapitated post-critical larva yields no pupation in either, and the pre-critical larva dies with starvation-like symptoms despite shared circulation. This shows a brain-derived factor is necessary for pupation; absence of the brain deprives the parabionts of the essential activator. The fat body state alone (even from a post-critical partner) is not sufficient to trigger pupation.\n- From Genetic Manipulation I, silencing fatinhibin in the fat body causes precocious pupation at smaller size, establishing that Fatinhibin normally functions as an inhibitor of pupation; its removal advances the transition.\n- From Genetic Manipulation II, silencing the PTTH receptor in the PG blocks pupation and allows continued overgrowth, establishing that PTTH signaling to the PG is necessary and acts directly at the PG to trigger ecdysone production and pupation.\n- From Genetic Manipulation III, the double manipulation (fatinhibin silencing in fat body and PTTH receptor silencing in PG) gives the same phenotype as PTTH receptor silencing alone. This epistasis shows that PTTH signaling at the PG is indispensable even when the inhibitory brake from the fat body is removed; therefore, Fatinhibin cannot substitute for PTTH loss, and PTTH signaling acts downstream or is the obligate gate at the PG.\n\nNow, evaluate each model:\n\n- Model B predicts that the primary switch is cessation of Fatinhibin from the fat body and that PTTH acts on the fat body. This is contradicted by Genetic Manipulation II, where silencing the PTTH receptor only in the PG (not in fat body) blocks pupation; if PTTH acted primarily on fat body, this manipulation should not prevent pupation. Also, Parabiosis II shows that absence of brain prevents pupation even when the partner is post-critical, inconsistent with fat body disinhibition being sufficient. Therefore, B is invalid.\n\n- Model C assigns Fatinhibin to the brain and PTTH to neutralize it in circulation, with PG driven by fat body nutrition. This is directly contradicted by Genetic Manipulation I, which silenced fatinhibin in the fat body (not brain) and caused early pupation. Therefore, C is invalid.\n\n- Model E claims Fatinhibin is growth-promoting and that PTTH binds and inactivates it, enabling pupation. This contradicts Genetic Manipulation I (loss of Fatinhibin causes earlier pupation, indicating it is inhibitory rather than growth-promoting) and Genetic Manipulation III (removing Fatinhibin does not rescue loss of PTTH receptor). Therefore, E is invalid.\n\n- Model D asserts that PTTH is the sole activator and Fatinhibin inhibits PTTH release from the brain, relieved at critical weight. This can explain Genetic Manipulation I (removing Fatinhibin permits earlier PTTH release) and Genetic Manipulation II and III (PTTH receptor at PG is required). Parabiosis II also fits because no brain means no PTTH. However, Parabiosis I imposes a stricter constraint: the small partner’s circulating Fatinhibin (secreted peptide) would enter the large partner via shared circulation. If Fatinhibin’s primary target is the brain to suppress PTTH release, then the small larva’s high Fatinhibin would be expected to suppress the large brain as well, potentially delaying pupation rather than causing synchronized precocious pupation. To reconcile this, one must add an extra assumption that the large brain becomes insensitive to Fatinhibin after critical weight, which is not stated in D. Without this added assumption, D is less parsimonious with Parabiosis I.\n\n- Model A posits that Fatinhibin tonically inhibits the PG and PTTH from the brain, after critical weight, acts on the PG to overcome this inhibition. This directly matches Genetic Manipulations II and III, which demonstrate that PTTH signaling at the PG is necessary and epistatic to the fat body signal. Genetic Manipulation I is consistent because removing the tonic inhibition allows even low or earlier PTTH activity to trigger pupation at smaller size. Parabiosis I is naturally explained: the PTTH from the large partner floods the shared circulation and overcomes PG inhibition in both larvae, producing synchronized precocious pupation; the presence of inhibitor from the small partner does not prevent pupation because PTTH overrides it. Parabiosis II fits because without a brain in the large partner there is insufficient PTTH in the shared circulation; hence, tonic inhibition remains unopposed and neither pupates.\n\nTherefore, all five experiments are most parsimoniously and completely explained by Model A: a fat body-derived tonic inhibitor at the PG, and a brain-derived PTTH that, once adequate systemic state is attained, activates the PG to overcome this inhibition and trigger pupation. The epistasis in the double knockdown (PTTH receptor loss dominating over fatinhibin loss) strongly supports PTTH action at the PG as the indispensable trigger, consistent with A and requiring fewer auxiliary assumptions than D about inter-individual inhibition of brain PTTH release in parabiosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1694075"}]}
