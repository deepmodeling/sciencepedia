{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To build a complex structure like a wing, developing tissues must first establish a coordinate system. This practice explores a fundamental principle of this process: the division of the wing imaginal disc into anterior and posterior \"compartments\". By considering the consequences of removing the key posterior selector gene, *engrailed*, you will reason through the chain of molecular events that link this initial pattern to the overall growth of the adult structure [@problem_id:1694326]. This exercise highlights how a single genetic change can disrupt an entire developmental signaling center.", "problem": "In holometabolous insects like the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, many adult structures, such as wings, legs, and eyes, develop from larval tissues called imaginal discs. The wing imaginal disc, a flattened epithelial sac, is patterned during larval stages to give rise to the adult wing. One of the earliest and most crucial patterning events is the division of the disc into two compartments: the Anterior (A) compartment and the Posterior (P) compartment. This division establishes a lineage boundary that cells do not cross.\n\nThe identity of the posterior compartment is specified by the continuous expression of the selector gene *engrailed* (*en*). In a wild-type disc, cells in the posterior compartment express *en*, while cells in the anterior compartment do not. The boundary between the *en*-expressing and non-expressing cells is essential for creating a signaling center that organizes the growth and patterning of the entire wing. Cells in the posterior compartment secrete the signaling molecule Hedgehog, which acts on adjacent anterior cells to induce the expression of another signaling molecule, Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Dpp then diffuses away from this boundary, forming a concentration gradient that orchestrates wing development.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic experiment where a temperature-sensitive null mutation of the *engrailed* gene is activated, causing the complete loss of *engrailed* function in all cells of the wing imaginal disc throughout its development. Based on your understanding of developmental patterning, what would be the most likely phenotype of the adult wing that develops from this genetically altered disc?\n\nA. A wing of normal size and pattern.\n\nB. A wing of normal size, but composed of a mirror-image duplication of the anterior half.\n\nC. A wing of normal size, but composed entirely of posterior structures.\n\nD. The wing will be severely undersized or completely absent.\n\nE. A wing of normal size, but with a mixture of anterior and posterior tissues randomly distributed.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the normal roles of compartmentalization and engrailed. In the wing imaginal disc, the posterior compartment is defined by continuous expression of the selector gene engrailed. Posterior cells expressing engrailed produce Hedgehog, which signals to adjacent anterior cells to induce Decapentaplegic. The Dpp stripe at the anterior-posterior boundary establishes a morphogen gradient that controls both patterning and, critically, proliferation and growth of the wing.\n\nStep 2: Predict the molecular consequences of complete loss of engrailed in all cells. If engrailed function is absent everywhere, no cells adopt posterior identity. Consequently, Hedgehog is not produced anywhere in the disc, because Hedgehog expression in the wing requires engrailed in posterior cells.\n\nStep 3: Infer consequences for Dpp induction and gradient formation. Without Hedgehog emanating from posterior cells, the adjacent anterior cells at the would-be boundary are not induced to express Dpp. Therefore, there is no central Dpp stripe and no Dpp gradient.\n\nStep 4: Connect loss of Dpp signaling to growth and patterning. Dpp is essential for promoting cell proliferation and for patterning along the anterior-posterior axis. Loss of Dpp signaling leads to severe growth defects of the wing pouch and failure to pattern the wing blade.\n\nStep 5: Translate to organismal phenotype and evaluate options. With no engrailed, no Hedgehog, and no Dpp, the organizer is abolished, leading to profound reduction in wing growth; the wing would be severely reduced or absent. This rules out a normal-sized wing of any pattern. Mirror-image duplications or all-posterior transformations require ectopic organizer activity or ectopic engrailed, which are not present here. Random mixing does not restore organizer function or growth to normal size.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is severe undersizing or complete absence of the wing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1694326"}, {"introduction": "Just as the wing has a front and a back, it also has a top (dorsal) and a bottom (ventral) surface, each with unique features. This patterning is governed by a different set of selector genes operating along the dorsal-ventral axis. This problem focuses on the gene *apterous*, which is essential for defining the dorsal compartment [@problem_id:1694337]. Applying the same logic of gene function as in the previous exercise, you will predict the direct consequences of its loss, reinforcing your understanding of how compartment-specific gene expression builds a patterned organ.", "problem": "In holometabolous insects such as *Drosophila melanogaster*, many adult structures develop from larval tissues called imaginal discs. The wing imaginal disc, for example, is a flattened epithelial sac that is patterned during larval stages to form the adult wing. This patterning occurs along several axes, including the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis which distinguishes the top from the bottom surface of the wing. The gene *apterous* (*ap*) is a key selector gene involved in this process. Consider a scenario where a newly induced, homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the *apterous* gene is present in a fly. Which of the following developmental outcomes would be the most direct and primary consequence of this mutation?\n\nA. The complete failure of the entire wing blade to form.\n\nB. The loss of structures specific to the dorsal surface of the wing.\n\nC. The loss of structures specific to the ventral surface of the wing.\n\nD. The specific malformation of the anterior-posterior boundary.\n\nE. The transformation of the wing into a leg-like appendage.", "solution": "We identify the relevant developmental axis and selector gene function. In the wing imaginal disc, the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis is patterned by compartment-specific selector genes. The gene apterous (ap) is expressed specifically in the dorsal compartment and functions as a dorsal selector gene. Its primary, cell-autonomous role is to specify dorsal cell fate. In addition, ap regulates signals that form and maintain the D-V boundary: it induces expression of dorsal-specific ligands (e.g., Serrate) and modulates Fringe, leading to Notch activation at the D-V boundary and subsequent Wingless expression at the wing margin.\n\nWe analyze the direct consequence of a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in apterous. Without ap function, cells that would normally become dorsal fail to adopt dorsal identity and instead take on ventral-like characteristics. The most immediate and primary outcome is therefore the loss of dorsal fate and, correspondingly, dorsal-specific structures. While secondary consequences can include defects in D-V boundary formation and wing margin signaling (e.g., Wingless at the margin), the key direct effect is the loss of dorsal identity.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A. Complete failure of the entire wing blade is too severe and not the primary direct effect of ap loss; wing tissue can still form but with dorsal identity missing and boundary defects.\n- B. Loss of structures specific to the dorsal surface aligns directly with ap’s dorsal selector role and is the most immediate consequence.\n- C. Loss of ventral structures is the opposite of the expected phenotype from ap loss.\n- D. Malformation of the anterior-posterior boundary implicates a different axis governed by genes like engrailed and hedgehog; this is not the primary consequence of ap loss.\n- E. Transformation into a leg-like appendage represents a homeotic transformation involving Hox genes (e.g., Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax), not ap.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence is the loss of dorsal-specific structures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1694337"}, {"introduction": "Development is a process that unfolds in both space and time. A gene's function may be required not just in a specific location but also at a specific developmental stage. This practice introduces a powerful experimental tool—the temperature-sensitive mutation—to probe the temporal requirements of the *Distal-less* gene during leg development [@problem_id:1694300]. By analyzing this hypothetical experiment, you will learn to think about development as a dynamic sequence of events, where the \"when\" is just as important as the \"where\".", "problem": "In holometabolous insects like *Drosophila melanogaster*, many adult structures, such as legs, wings, and eyes, develop from larval tissues called imaginal discs. These are small sacs of epithelial cells that are set aside during embryonic development and proliferate throughout the larval stages. During metamorphosis, these discs evert and differentiate to form the adult structures.\n\nThe development of the proximal-distal axis of the leg (from the body wall outwards to the tip) is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors. The gene *Distal-less* (*Dll*) plays a crucial role in this process. Its expression in the central region of the developing leg imaginal disc is necessary for the specification and formation of the most distal structures of the adult leg, namely the tarsal segments and the terminal claw.\n\nA research group has isolated a strain of *Drosophila* with a temperature-sensitive (*ts*) mutation in the *Dll* gene.\n- At the permissive temperature of 18°C, the Dll protein folds correctly and is fully functional, leading to normal leg development.\n- At the restrictive temperature of 29°C, the Dll protein misfolds and is non-functional.\n\nThe development of the leg disc can be broadly divided into two key periods:\n1.  **Early Larval Period (1st and 2nd instars):** The leg disc is small, and the expression of *Dll* is initiated to establish the central domain of cells that will give rise to distal structures.\n2.  **Late Larval Period (3rd instar):** The disc undergoes massive cell proliferation. The continued function of Dll is required during this stage to maintain the identity of the central domain and guide the development of the final distal structures.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following experimental outcomes is the most likely to be correct?\n\nA. Larvae shifted from the permissive temperature to the restrictive temperature at the beginning of the 3rd instar will develop into adult flies with completely normal legs.\n\nB. Larvae reared exclusively at the restrictive temperature (29°C) throughout their development will develop into adult flies whose legs are only missing the tarsal segments and claw.\n\nC. Larvae shifted from the restrictive temperature to the permissive temperature after the 1st instar will be fully rescued and develop into adult flies with completely normal legs.\n\nD. Larvae reared at the permissive temperature until the beginning of the 3rd instar and then shifted to the restrictive temperature will develop into adult flies with legs that are present but lack their distal structures (tarsal segments and claw).\n\nE. Larvae reared exclusively at the permissive temperature (18°C) throughout their development will develop into adult flies that completely lack legs.", "solution": "A temperature-sensitive mutation produces a conditional loss-of-function: at the permissive temperature the protein is functional, and at the restrictive temperature it is non-functional. The gene in question, Distal-less (Dll), is required in two distinct developmental windows of the leg imaginal disc:\n- Early larval period (1st and 2nd instars): Dll function is required to initiate and establish the central domain that will form distal structures.\n- Late larval period (3rd instar): Dll function is required to maintain the identity of that central domain and guide the formation of the final distal structures (tarsal segments and the terminal claw).\n\nFrom these premises, evaluate each option by matching the timing of Dll function with the required developmental window.\n\nFor option A, shifting from permissive to restrictive at the beginning of the 3rd instar removes Dll function precisely during the late larval period when continued Dll activity is required to maintain distal identity. Therefore, distal structures should be lost; completely normal legs are not expected. Hence A is incorrect.\n\nFor option B, rearing exclusively at the restrictive temperature eliminates Dll function throughout both early and late windows. Without early Dll, the central distal domain is not established, and without late Dll, there is no maintenance of distal identity. The expected outcome is the absence of distal structures. However, the statement says the legs are only missing the tarsal segments and claw. Given that Dll function is absent from the very start, failure to establish the central domain can cause a more severe distal truncation than a late-only loss, and the phenotype need not be restricted to “only” the tarsal segments and claw. Thus the claim of “only” those parts missing is not reliably supported; B is not the most justified choice.\n\nFor option C, shifting from restrictive to permissive after the 1st instar means Dll was absent during at least part of the early establishment window. Because early Dll activity is needed to establish the central domain, the absence during 1st instar risks incomplete or incorrect establishment that is not guaranteed to be fully rescued by later restoration. Therefore, a claim of complete rescue to normal legs is not supported; C is unlikely to be correct.\n\nFor option D, rearing at permissive until the beginning of the 3rd instar allows early Dll function to establish the central domain. Shifting to restrictive at the start of 3rd instar then removes the continued Dll function needed for maintenance and final differentiation of distal structures. The predicted outcome is legs that form but lack their distal structures (tarsal segments and claw). This matches the described role of Dll across the two windows and is therefore the most likely correct outcome.\n\nFor option E, constant permissive temperature preserves Dll function throughout development, so legs should be normal, not absent; E is incorrect.\n\nThus, the most likely correct outcome is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1694300"}]}
