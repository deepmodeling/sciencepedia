{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental question in metamorphosis is what keeps a larva in its juvenile state through multiple growth stages. This exercise tackles that question by focusing on the role of Juvenile Hormone (JH). By exploring a thought experiment based on the surgical removal of the corpora allata, the glands that produce JH, we can deduce its primary function as a crucial \"status quo\" signal that maintains the larval form during growth. [@problem_id:1708741]", "problem": "In holometabolous insects, such as moths and butterflies, post-embryonic development is controlled by two primary hormones. Ecdysone, secreted by the prothoracic gland, triggers molting (ecdysis). Juvenile Hormone (JH), secreted by a pair of glands called the corpora allata, determines the outcome of the molt. When JH levels are high, a molt results in a larger larval instar. When JH levels fall below a critical threshold, a molt leads to pupation, and a subsequent molt in the complete absence of JH leads to the emergence of the adult.\n\nConsider a species of moth that normally undergoes five larval instars before pupating. A group of researchers performs a delicate surgery on a healthy, well-fed second-instar larva, completely removing its corpora allata. This procedure is known as allatectomy. Assuming the larva survives the surgery and continues to have access to sufficient food, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the subsequent life history of this manipulated insect?\n\nA. It will molt prematurely into a miniature pupa, which will then molt into a miniature adult.\n\nB. It will die almost immediately, as Juvenile Hormone is required for basic metabolic functions.\n\nC. It will continue to grow and molt through the third, fourth, and fifth larval instars, but will then be unable to pupate and will die as a giant larva.\n\nD. It will molt directly from a larva into a miniature adult, completely skipping the pupal stage.\n\nE. It will become permanently arrested as a second-instar larva, unable to initiate any further molts.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the developmental fate of a second-instar larva after its corpora allata are surgically removed. To solve this, we must understand the specific roles of the two key hormones involved in insect metamorphosis: ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone (JH).\n\nStep 1: Analyze the function of each hormone.\n- **Ecdysone**: This hormone is often called the \"molting hormone.\" Its release in pulses from the prothoracic gland triggers the process of ecdysis, or molting, where the insect sheds its old cuticle and grows a new one. The presence of ecdysone is necessary for any molt to occur.\n- **Juvenile Hormone (JH)**: This hormone's primary role is to determine the *character* of the molt initiated by ecdysone. Its name is descriptive: it promotes the retention of juvenile, or larval, characteristics.\n    - When JH levels in the hemolymph (insect blood) are high, an ecdysone-induced molt results in another larval instar (a larva-to-larva molt).\n    - When JH levels drop significantly, an ecdysone-induced molt triggers metamorphosis, leading to the formation of a pupa (a larva-to-pupa molt).\n    - When a molt occurs in the complete absence of JH, it results in the formation of the adult (a pupa-to-adult molt).\n\nStep 2: Determine the effect of removing the corpora allata.\nThe corpora allata are the sole glands responsible for producing and secreting JH. Surgically removing them (allatectomy) will cause the concentration of JH in the larva's hemolymph to plummet to nearly zero.\n\nStep 3: Predict the outcome of the next molt.\nThe larva is in its second instar. Under normal conditions, it would continue to produce high levels of JH and molt into a third-instar larva, then a fourth, and so on. However, in our experimental larva, the JH source has been removed. The prothoracic gland is unaffected, so it will continue to produce ecdysone at the appropriate time to trigger the next molt. When this pulse of ecdysone occurs in the now JH-deficient larva, the developmental program will interpret the signal as \"time to metamorphose.\" Instead of molting into a third-instar larva, the second-instar larva will undergo a precocious (premature) pupation. Because the larva has only grown to the size of a second instar, the resulting pupa will be a miniature version of a normal pupa.\n\nStep 4: Predict the outcome of a subsequent molt.\nThe insect is now a miniature pupa. The corpora allata are still absent, so JH levels remain at zero. The developmental cycle will continue, and another pulse of ecdysone will trigger the next molt. A molt that occurs in the complete absence of JH results in the formation of an adult. Therefore, the miniature pupa will molt into a miniature adult. This adult will be correctly formed but much smaller than usual and likely sterile or non-viable due to its accelerated and incomplete growth phase.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this prediction.\n- **A. It will molt prematurely into a miniature pupa, which will then molt into a miniature adult.** This matches our prediction perfectly. The lack of JH induces premature metamorphosis.\n- **B. It will die almost immediately, as Juvenile Hormone is required for basic metabolic functions.** This is incorrect. While JH has some metabolic roles, its primary function is developmental. Its absence does not cause immediate death but rather alters the developmental pathway.\n- **C. It will continue to grow and molt through the third, fourth, and fifth larval instars, but will then be unable to pupate and will die as a giant larva.** This describes the opposite scenario: what would happen if JH levels were artificially kept high, preventing the drop in JH concentration needed for pupation.\n- **D. It will molt directly from a larva into a miniature adult, completely skipping the pupal stage.** This is incorrect for holometabolous insects like moths. The pupal stage is a necessary developmental period during which the larval body is completely reorganized into the adult form. This transformation cannot be skipped.\n- **E. It will become permanently arrested as a second-instar larva, unable to initiate any further molts.** This is incorrect. The inability to molt would imply a lack of ecdysone. The surgery removed the corpora allata (source of JH), not the prothoracic gland (source of ecdysone).\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the allatectomized larva will molt into a miniature pupa and then a miniature adult.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708741"}, {"introduction": "While Juvenile Hormone determines the *outcome* of a molt, what provides the actual trigger for the molt to begin? This practice explores the function of ecdysone, the molting hormone, by simulating the removal of its source, the prothoracic glands. Analyzing the consequences of an ecdysone-deficient environment helps clarify its role as the indispensable \"go\" signal that initiates the entire molting process, whether it leads to another larva or a pupa. [@problem_id:1708718]", "problem": "In holometabolous insects, the transition between life stages is orchestrated by a precise interplay of hormones. The primary hormones involved are ecdysone, a steroid hormone secreted by the prothoracic glands, and Juvenile Hormone (JH), secreted by the corpora allata. Ecdysone is responsible for initiating the process of molting (ecdysis). The presence or absence of JH at the time of the ecdysone surge determines the outcome of the molt. A high titer of JH results in a molt to another larval instar, whereas a low or absent titer of JH allows for metamorphosis into a pupa or adult.\n\nConsider a final-instar caterpillar of a lepidopteran species. After it has ceased feeding, it enters a \"wandering stage\" in preparation for pupation, a time when its endogenous JH levels have naturally fallen to a very low level. An experiment is conducted where the prothoracic glands of this caterpillar are surgically removed (a procedure known as prothoracicectomy) immediately after it enters this wandering stage.\n\nAssuming the surgery is successful and the caterpillar survives the procedure itself, which of the following outcomes is the most likely developmental fate for this caterpillar?\n\nA. The caterpillar will immediately molt into a small, reproductively sterile adult, bypassing the pupal stage entirely.\n\nB. The caterpillar will successfully form a chrysalis (pupa), but will remain in a state of permanent pupal diapause, unable to develop into an adult.\n\nC. The caterpillar will molt into a supernumerary larval instar, becoming a \"giant\" larva that continues to wander.\n\nD. The caterpillar will remain as a larva and will be unable to initiate pupation, eventually dying without further molting or development.\n\nE. The caterpillar will initiate pupation, but the process will be defective, resulting in a creature that is a mosaic of larval and pupal tissues.", "solution": "Let $E(t)$ denote the circulating ecdysone titer and $JH(t)$ denote the Juvenile Hormone titer as functions of time $t$. Let $E_{th}$ be the threshold ecdysone level required to initiate a molt, and let $JH_{crit}$ be the maximal JH compatible with metamorphosis.\n\nFundamental endocrine control in holometabolous insects can be summarized as:\n- A molt requires an ecdysone surge, i.e., existence of some $t$ such that $E(t) \\ge E_{th}$.\n- The fate of the molt depends on $JH(t)$ at the time of the ecdysone surge:\n  - If $JH(t)$ is high (i.e., $JH(t) \\gg JH_{crit}$), the molt is larva-to-larva.\n  - If $JH(t)$ is low or absent (i.e., $JH(t) \\le JH_{crit}$), the molt is metamorphic (larva-to-pupa in a final instar).\n\nIn a final-instar caterpillar entering the wandering stage, endogenous JH has already fallen to a very low level, so $JH(t) \\approx 0$ (more precisely $JH(t) \\le JH_{crit}$). Under normal physiology, the brain via PTTH stimulates the prothoracic glands to secrete ecdysone, producing an $E(t)$ surge with $E(t) \\ge E_{th}$, which, in the context $JH(t) \\approx 0$, commits the animal to pupation.\n\nProthoracicectomy removes the source of ecdysone. Let $t_{0}$ be the time of surgery. Since the prothoracic glands synthesize ecdysone, their removal imposes\n$$\nE(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge t_{0}.\n$$\nGiven that a molt requires $E(t) \\ge E_{th}$ at some time, we have\n$$\nE(t) = 0 < E_{th} \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge t_{0},\n$$\nso no molt of any kind (larval or metamorphic) can be initiated. The low $JH(t)$ is irrelevant in the absence of an ecdysone surge; without ecdysone, pupation cannot begin, a larval molt cannot occur, and development arrests in the larval state.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is excluded because an adult molt requires an ecdysone surge, which is absent.\n- Option B is excluded because forming a chrysalis requires ecdysone; without it, a pupa cannot form, let alone remain in diapause.\n- Option C is excluded because a supernumerary larval molt requires an ecdysone surge in the presence of high $JH$, but here $E(t)=0$ and $JH(t)\\approx 0$.\n- Option E is excluded because initiating pupation (even defectively) still requires an ecdysone surge.\n\nThe only consistent outcome is developmental arrest as a larva with failure to initiate pupation, leading eventually to death without further molting.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1708718"}, {"introduction": "Metamorphosis involves systemic hormonal signals, but development ultimately happens at the tissue level. This practice shifts focus to the imaginal discs, groups of cells determined in the larva to form specific adult structures. Using a classic transplantation experiment, you will investigate how a disc fragment behaves when cultured in different hormonal environments. This reveals the powerful interplay between a tissue's intrinsic developmental program and the extrinsic hormonal cues that trigger its final differentiation. [@problem_id:1708700]", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate the developmental potential and hormonal regulation of imaginal discs in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. An imaginal leg disc, which is a small epithelial sac of cells determined to form a leg during metamorphosis, is surgically removed from a late third-instar larva. This larval stage is the final one before the onset of pupation.\n\nThe dissected leg disc is carefully cut into four small fragments. Each fragment is then individually transplanted into the abdominal cavity of a separate adult female fly. These adult flies serve as living culture environments and are maintained for several weeks. During this period, the transplanted fragments are observed to increase significantly in size.\n\nFollowing this culture period, each of the four now-enlarged tissue masses is recovered from its host. Each tissue mass is then transplanted into the abdomen of a new, different late third-instar larva (one tissue mass per larva). These four recipient larvae are subsequently allowed to proceed through their natural life cycle, undergoing metamorphosis into pupae and then eclosing as adult flies.\n\nAssuming all surgical procedures are successful and the transplanted tissues remain viable, which of the following outcomes would be predominantly observed upon examining the abdominal cavities of the four final adult flies that developed from the recipient larvae?\n\nA. The abdominal cavities are empty, as the disc fragments were unable to develop outside their original larval context.\n\nB. Four amorphous, tumor-like masses of undifferentiated cells are found, one in each abdomen.\n\nC. Four sets of partial leg structures are found, with each set corresponding to the specific portion of the original disc from which the fragment was cut.\n\nD. Four complete and well-patterned legs are found, one supernumerary leg within the abdomen of each of the four flies.\n\nE. A single, complete leg is found in the abdomen of one of the four flies, while the other three contain no differentiated structures.", "solution": "We begin by stating key developmental principles about Drosophila imaginal discs. Imaginal discs are groups of epithelial cells that are determined for a specific adult fate (such as leg) during larval life. Determination means their fate is fixed (leg-forming), but they are undifferentiated until metamorphic cues trigger differentiation. Importantly, imaginal discs exhibit regulative growth and patterning: even small fragments can regenerate the missing parts of the disc via intercalary regeneration to reestablish a complete, correctly patterned field corresponding to the original structure.\n\nNext, we consider hormonal control. Metamorphic differentiation of imaginal discs requires pulses of ecdysteroids (notably ecdysone), which occur at the larval-to-pupal transition and during pupation. In contrast, the hemolymph environment of an adult host supports growth and survival of imaginal disc cells but does not provide the metamorphic ecdysteroid pulses needed to induce differentiation.\n\nNow we apply these principles to the experiment. The leg imaginal disc is cut into four fragments. Each fragment is transplanted into an adult abdomen and maintained. In the adult host, each fragment grows substantially (mitotic proliferation) but does not differentiate, because the required ecdysone pulses are absent in this context. During this growth period, each fragment also undergoes regulative patterning, restoring the missing positional values through intercalary regeneration, thereby reconstructing a complete leg-disc pattern within each mass of tissue.\n\nEach enlarged tissue mass is then transplanted into a late third-instar larva that proceeds to pupation. During the larva-to-pupa transition and pupal development, the endogenous ecdysteroid pulses occur. These hormonal cues are sufficient to trigger the determined leg-disc tissues to undergo metamorphic differentiation into the adult leg structures, even at an ectopic location (the abdominal cavity). Because imaginal discs are largely autonomous with respect to pattern and identity once determined, they will form their specified structure at the site where they reside, irrespective of position in the body.\n\nTherefore, for each of the four recipients, the transplanted, regenerated leg disc will differentiate into a complete, well-patterned leg inside the abdomen. Consequently, the expected predominant outcome is that each of the four final adult flies contains an ectopic but complete leg in the abdomen.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: the fragments are viable, grow in adults, and later differentiate after exposure to pupal hormones.\n- B is incorrect: under pupal ecdysteroid pulses, imaginal disc tissue differentiates into proper structures rather than remaining undifferentiated.\n- C is incorrect: due to regulative growth and intercalary regeneration, fragments reconstruct complete discs; they do not remain as partial patterns corresponding only to the piece excised.\n- D is correct: each fragment yields a complete leg, producing four supernumerary legs, one per recipient fly.\n- E is incorrect: given viability and regulation, all four are expected to form complete legs, not just one.\n\nThus, the experimentally supported outcome is four complete legs, one in each abdomen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1708700"}]}
