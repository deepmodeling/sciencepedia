This exercise explores a classic technique using morpholinos for transient gene knockdown, a powerful tool in developmental biology. To ensure the observed phenotype is truly due to the loss of the targeted gene and not an unintended \"off-target\" effect, a rescue experiment is essential. This problem challenges you to think like an experimentalist by calculating the precise amount of a specially designed rescue mRNA needed to restore the gene's function, providing a quantitative look at the logic behind loss-of-function studies and their critical controls [@problem_id:1712388].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the role of the gene *Pax6*, a master regulator of eye development, in *Xenopus* embryos. To do this, they employ a reverse genetics approach using a translation-blocking morpholino (MO), which is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to bind to the 5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR) of the endogenous *Pax6* messenger RNA (mRNA) and prevent its translation.\n\nInjection of this *Pax6*-MO into a single-cell embryo is observed to reduce the total synthesis rate of Pax6 protein within the targeted embryonic tissues to a fraction $f_{kd} = 0.10$ (i.e., 10%) of the normal wild-type rate. This knockdown results in embryos with significantly reduced eye structures.\n\nTo verify that this phenotype is specifically caused by the loss of Pax6 protein and not by off-target effects of the MO, the biologist performs a rescue experiment. They create a synthetic \"rescue\" mRNA, denoted *Pax6-R*, which codes for the exact same Pax6 protein but possesses a modified 5' UTR that prevents the *Pax6*-MO from binding. Due to this modification and codon optimization, each molecule of *Pax6-R* mRNA is translated with a higher efficiency; its translation rate per molecule is a factor of $k=4.0$ times greater than that of a single endogenous *Pax6* mRNA molecule.\n\nThe biologist's goal is to co-inject the *Pax6*-MO and the *Pax6-R* mRNA to restore the total Pax6 protein synthesis rate to a level that is a fraction $f_{rescue} = 0.85$ (i.e., 85%) of the original wild-type rate.\n\nAssuming that in a wild-type cell, there are $N_{endo}$ molecules of endogenous *Pax6* mRNA, determine the number of *Pax6-R* mRNA molecules, $N_{rescue}$, that must be injected into a single cell to achieve the desired rescue.

These WT mice have an average adult body weight of 30.0 g. A complete loss of function, observed in homozygous null mutants (`gfe-/gfe-`), results in 0% GFE protein activity and a severely reduced average adult body weight of 12.0 g.\n\nTo investigate the effects of partial gene function, the researcher uses Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology to create a novel hypomorphic allele, `gfe-h`. An individual `gfe-h` allele is found to contribute only 40% of the functional activity that a single wild-type (`+`) allele would normally provide.\n\nAssume that the final adult body weight is directly and linearly proportional to the total percentage of functional GFE protein activity.
