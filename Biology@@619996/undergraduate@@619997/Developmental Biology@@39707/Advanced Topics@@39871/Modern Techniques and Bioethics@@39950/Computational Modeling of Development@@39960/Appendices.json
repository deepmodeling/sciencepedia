The simulation models cell sorting behavior by iteratively adjusting cell boundaries to minimize the total interfacial energy of the system. This energy is governed by the adhesion strength between neighboring cells. The simulation defines a specific energy penalty, $J$, for each type of cell-cell contact. A lower $J$ value corresponds to a stronger, more energetically favorable adhesion.\n\nThe specific energy parameters for this system are set according to the following relationship:\n$$J_{AA} < J_{BB} < J_{AB}$$\nwhere $J_{AA}$ is the energy penalty for a contact between two type A cells, $J_{BB}$ is for a contact between two type B cells, and $J_{AB}$ is for a contact between a type A and a type B cell.\n\nAssuming the system is allowed to run until it reaches a stable, minimum-energy equilibrium state, which of the following descriptions accurately portrays the final spatial arrangement of the cells?\n\nA.

A lower $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ corresponds to stronger adhesion and therefore a more energetically favorable contact. The system evolves to minimize the total interfacial energy, so the equilibrium configuration is determined by how to arrange cells to reduce high-penalty contacts and, subject to that, to arrange domains so that the more cohesive tissue adopts the position that further lowers the total boundary energy.\n\nGiven\n$$\nJ_{AA} < J_{BB} < J_{AB},\n$$\nwe have the following implications:\n1. Because $J_{AB}$ is the largest, heterotypic A–B contacts carry the highest energy cost. Therefore, energy minimization drives a reduction of the total A–B interfacial area. This implies demixing (cell sorting), not maintenance of a random mixture; hence option C is incompatible with minimizing $J_{AB}$-weighted interfaces. Likewise, a checkerboard-like alternation (option E) would maximize the number of A–B contacts and is therefore energetically unfavorable when $J_{AB}$ is largest.\n\n2. Among homotypic contacts, $J_{AA} < J_{BB}$ means A–A adhesion is stronger (more favorable) than B–B. In the differential adhesion framework, each cell type behaves as a cohesive fluid with an effective tissue cohesivity (or surface tension analog) that increases with the strength of homotypic adhesion. Thus type A is more cohesive than type B.\n\n3. When two cohesivities differ and heterotypic contacts are unfavorable, the minimal-energy arrangement after demixing places the more cohesive tissue inside, fully surrounded by the less cohesive tissue. This configuration minimizes total interfacial energy by:\n   - Eliminating unnecessary A–B contacts (demixing);\n   - Positioning the more cohesive aggregate (type A) as an internal core so that the system avoids exposing the less cohesive tissue to high-energy configurations and achieves the liquid-like equilibrium mandated by the differential adhesion hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium arrangement is that type A forms a central cohesive mass that is engulfed by type B, which matches option A. Options B and D do not match the ordering $J_{AA} < J_{BB}$: if B were more cohesive, B would be inside, but here A is more cohesive; and two adjacent aggregates (D) do not capture the known engulfment outcome when cohesivities differ and heterotypic contacts are disfavored.\n\nHence the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1676839"}, {"introduction": "Building on the qualitative principles of the DAH, we now move to a quantitative analysis.

This advanced problem demonstrates how computational models can be used not just for analysis, but for uncovering the design principles that evolution may have favored.", "problem": "In the study of developmental biology, the self-organization of cells into distinct tissues is a fundamental process. Computational models, such as the Cellular Potts Model, are often used to explore the physical principles governing these phenomena. A key principle is the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH), which posits that tissue sorting is driven by differences in adhesion energies between cell types, leading to a configuration that minimizes the total surface energy of the system.\n\nConsider a simplified 2D model of germ layer sorting involving three cell types: Endoderm (N), Mesoderm (M), and Ectoderm (E), all suspended in an external Medium (D). The desired final configuration is the canonical arrangement: a central core of endoderm, surrounded by a layer of mesoderm, which is itself enclosed by an outer layer of ectoderm.\n\nThe interaction between any two components (cells or medium), $i$ and $j$, is described by an adhesion energy per unit contact length, $J_{ij}$. The effective surface tension, $\\gamma_{ij}$, between two large populations of cells $i$ and $j$ is approximated by the relation:\n$$ \\gamma_{ij} = J_{ij} - \\frac{1}{2}(J_{ii} + J_{jj}) $$\nFor the canonical sorting to occur, two sets of conditions based on the DAH must be met:\n1.  **Layering Hierarchy**: The surface tensions with the medium must be ordered to drive the layering. Specifically, $0 < \\gamma_{ED} < \\gamma_{MD} < \\gamma_{ND}$. This ensures ectoderm is the most external layer, followed by mesoderm, and then endoderm internally.\n2.  **Tissue Immiscibility**: The layers must remain distinct and not intermix. This requires the interfacial tension between any two different cell types to be positive: $\\gamma_{EM} > 0$, $\\gamma_{EN} > 0$, and $\\gamma_{MN} > 0$.\n\nTo make the problem tractable, we introduce a simplified biophysical model with the following assumptions and constraints:\n- All homotypic (like-like) cell adhesions are strong, with energies $J_{EE} = J_{MM} = J_{NN} = -J_0$, where $J_0 = 30$ is a dimensionless energy constant. The medium has no self-adhesion, so $J_{DD} = 0$.\n- A cell's adhesion properties are determined by a single fundamental parameter, its \"unsociability\" $u_i \\ge 0$. The heterotypic adhesion energies are given by a simple additive rule: $J_{ij} = u_i + u_j$ for $i \\neq j$ and $i, j \\in \\{E, M, N\\}$. The cell-medium adhesion is $J_{iD} = u_i$, which corresponds to setting $u_D = 0$.\n- The cell types operate under a shared metabolic budget that constrains the total production of these unsociability factors: $u_E + u_M + u_N = C$, where the total budget constant $C = 15$.\n\nThe speed and robustness of the sorting process are critically dependent on the separation between the surface tension values in the hierarchy. To ensure the most efficient and unambiguous sorting, the system must evolve to maximize the \"bottleneck\" in this hierarchy. Therefore, the objective is to maximize the minimum sorting-driving potential, defined as $\\Delta_{\\min} = \\min(\\gamma_{MD} - \\gamma_{ED}, \\gamma_{ND} - \\gamma_{MD})$.\n\nDetermine the specific numerical values for the unsociability parameters $(u_E, u_M, u_N)$ that maximize $\\Delta_{\\min}$ while satisfying all DAH conditions and the metabolic budget constraint.", "solution": "We are given the adhesion energies\n- Homotypic: $J_{EE} = J_{MM} = J_{NN} = -J_{0}$, $J_{DD} = 0$.\n- Heterotypic cell-cell: $J_{ij} = u_{i} + u_{j}$ for $i \\neq j \\in \\{E,M,N\\}$.\n- Cell-medium: $J_{iD} = u_{i}$ with $u_{D} = 0$.\nThe surface tension between $i$ and $j$ is\n$$\n\\gamma_{ij} = J_{ij} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(J_{ii} + J_{jj}\\right).\n$$\n\nFirst, compute the cell-medium surface tensions.
