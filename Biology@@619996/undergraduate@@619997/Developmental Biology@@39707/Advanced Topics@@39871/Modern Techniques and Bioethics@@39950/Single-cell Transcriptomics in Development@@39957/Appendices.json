The resulting high-dimensional data is visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a dimensionality reduction method. In the resulting UMAP plot, each point represents a single cell, and cells with similar overall gene expression patterns are positioned close to one another, often forming distinct clusters that correspond to different cell types or states.\n\nThe biologist wants to identify the population of cells that are part of the myocyte (developing muscle cell) lineage. It is well-established that the gene `MyoD` is a primary marker for this lineage, meaning it is expressed at a high level in myocyte precursors and at very low-to-no levels in other cell types. To pinpoint these cells, the biologist generates a \"feature plot.\" This plot is the same UMAP visualization, but now each cell is colored according to its expression level of the `MyoD` gene. The color scale is set such that low expression is colored grey and high expression is colored bright red.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following descriptions most accurately represents the expected appearance of the `MyoD` feature plot, allowing the biologist to successfully identify the myocyte lineage?\n\nA. A specific, localized group of cells that are clustered together on the UMAP plot will be colored bright red, while the vast majority of other cells on the plot will be colored grey.\n\nB. Cells scattered randomly throughout the entire UMAP plot will be colored bright red, with no discernible pattern or grouping.\n\nC. A specific, localized group of cells that are clustered together on the UMAP plot will be colored grey, while most other cells on the plot will be colored bright red.\n\nD. All cells located on the far-right side of the UMAP plot will be colored bright red, regardless of their clustering.\n\nE. The plot will be divided into two large, contiguous regions of roughly equal size, one colored entirely bright red and the other entirely grey.", "solution": "We interpret the problem using established principles of scRNA-seq visualization and marker-based lineage identification:\n\n1. UMAP arranges cells such that those with similar global gene expression profiles cluster near each other. Distinct cell types or lineages typically form localized clusters in the UMAP embedding.\n\n2. A feature plot overlays the expression of a single gene onto the UMAP by coloring each point (cell) according to the expression level of that gene. If a gene is a specific lineage marker, high expression should coincide with the cluster(s) corresponding to that lineage, while non-lineage cells should show low-to-no expression.\n\n3. The gene `MyoD` is a primary marker for the myocyte lineage, meaning it is expected to be expressed at high levels in myocyte precursors and at very low levels in other cell types.\n\n4. Therefore, the expected `MyoD` feature plot should show:\n   - A specific, localized cluster (or closely related cluster(s)) corresponding to myocyte precursors colored bright red (high expression).\n   - The vast majority of other cells colored grey (low or no expression), reflecting the specificity of the marker.\n\n5. Evaluate the options:\n   - A: Matches the expectation for a specific lineage marker—localized bright red cluster with others grey. This allows clear identification of the myocyte lineage.\n   - B: Random scattered red cells suggest no coherent lineage-specific expression pattern; inconsistent with a well-established specific marker.\n   - C: Inverts the expected pattern; would imply `MyoD` is low in the myocyte cluster and high elsewhere, contradicting its role as a specific myogenic marker.\n   - D: Coloring all cells on one side bright red irrespective of clustering suggests a spatial artifact unrelated to expression-based clustering, not expected for a biologically meaningful marker plot.\n   - E: Two large contiguous halves of red and grey imply a global batch effect or a broadly expressed gene, not a lineage-specific marker.\n\n6.

While a feature plot gives a spatial overview, a different tool is needed to rigorously compare the distribution of a gene's expression levels. This problem [@problem_id:1714774] asks you to think critically about data visualization, challenging you to choose the most effective plot to evaluate a hypothesis about the shape and modality of expression within different cell populations.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is using single-cell Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) sequencing to study the differentiation of a progenitor cell population into distinct cell fates. The analysis has grouped the cells into three clusters based on their overall gene expression profiles: a progenitor cluster (Cluster P), and two differentiated daughter clusters (Cluster A and Cluster B). The clusters can be visualized on a 2D map generated by the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm.\n\nThe biologist is investigating a transcription factor, `Gene Z`, which is hypothesized to control the decision to differentiate into either lineage A or B. A preliminary analysis shows that `Gene Z` is expressed in both Cluster A and Cluster B, but not in the progenitors (Cluster P). The biologist formulates a new, more specific hypothesis: within Cluster A, the expression of `Gene Z` is bimodal, meaning there is a subpopulation of cells with low expression and a distinct subpopulation with very high expression. In contrast, they suspect that in Cluster B, the expression of `Gene Z` is unimodal and distributed more uniformly around a moderate expression level.\n\nWhich of the following data visualization methods is the most direct and effective for evaluating this specific hypothesis about the *shape of the expression distribution* of `Gene Z` within and between the differentiated clusters?\n\nA. A UMAP plot where each cell is colored according to its cluster identity (P, A, or B).\n\nB. A bar chart displaying the average expression level of `Gene Z` for each of the three clusters.\n\nC. A violin plot of `Gene Z` expression, with separate violins generated for each of the three clusters (P, A, and B).\n\nD. A feature plot, which is the UMAP plot where each cell is colored by its individual expression level of `Gene Z`.\n\nE. A heatmap showing the expression of the 100 most variable genes (including `Gene Z`) across all cells, with the cells grouped and ordered by their cluster identity.", "solution": "The hypothesis concerns the modality and overall shape of the distribution of `Gene Z` expression within each cluster: bimodal in Cluster A, unimodal and moderate in Cluster B, and absent in Cluster P. The most direct visualization must display the full distribution of expression values per cluster, allowing detection of multiple modes.\n\nOption A (UMAP colored by cluster identity) only shows cluster assignments and provides no information about `Gene Z` expression distributions.\n\nOption B (bar chart of average expression per cluster) collapses each cluster’s expression into a single mean, which cannot reveal modality or distribution shape; distributions with different modality can share the same mean.\n\nOption C (violin plot per cluster) displays the full probability density of expression values for each cluster, making it possible to directly observe bimodality (two density peaks) in Cluster A and unimodality in Cluster B, while also showing absence or near-zero expression in Cluster P. This directly addresses the shape of the expression distribution.\n\nOption D (feature plot on UMAP colored by expression) shows spatial variation of expression over the embedding but does not directly summarize the distribution within each cluster; perceived density is confounded by the manifold geometry and cell density on the map, making assessment of modality indirect and potentially misleading.\n\nOption E (heatmap of 100 most variable genes) provides per-cell expression values but is not optimized for evaluating the shape of a single gene’s distribution; ordering and scaling choices obscure modality and make it less direct and effective than a distribution plot.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective method for evaluating the shape (modality) of `Gene Z` expression within and between clusters is the violin plot per cluster.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1714774"}, {"introduction": "Developmental processes involve a hierarchy of cell states, and broad cell clusters identified in an initial analysis can often hide significant biological diversity.

This refined analysis successfully partitions the cells into three distinct, smaller populations, which are labeled Sub-cluster 1, Sub-cluster 2, and Sub-cluster 3.\n\nTo determine the identity of these sub-clusters, the average normalized expression level for a panel of key lineage-specific genes is calculated for each sub-cluster.
