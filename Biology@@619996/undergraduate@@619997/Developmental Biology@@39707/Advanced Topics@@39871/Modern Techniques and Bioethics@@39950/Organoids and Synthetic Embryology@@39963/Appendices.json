{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of creating an organoid begins with a crucial first step: directed differentiation. To build a specific organ-like structure, we must first guide pluripotent stem cells to become the correct precursor cells—in this case, definitive endoderm for intestinal organoids. This exercise [@problem_id:1704582] challenges you to think like a developmental biologist, predicting the outcome when a fundamental signaling pathway is intentionally blocked, and revealing the concept of 'default' cellular fates.", "problem": "A research team is working on generating human intestinal organoids from Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs), which are cells capable of differentiating into any of the three primary germ layers. The initial and most critical stage of their protocol is the directed differentiation of PSCs into definitive endoderm, the embryonic tissue from which the intestine originates. The standard procedure for this step involves treating the PSC culture with a high concentration of the growth factor Activin A. Activin A mimics the function of the embryonic signaling molecule Nodal, and its signaling pathway is known to be absolutely essential for specifying the endodermal fate.\n\nIn a variant of the standard experiment, a potent and specific small-molecule inhibitor is added to the culture medium simultaneously with the high concentration of Activin A. This inhibitor is known to completely block the Nodal/Activin A signaling pathway by preventing signal transduction immediately downstream of the cell surface receptor. The problem states that in the absence of specific signals directing them toward endoderm or mesoderm, PSCs in this type of culture medium will follow a \"default\" differentiation path toward the neuroectoderm lineage.\n\nBased on these principles of developmental signaling, what is the most likely cellular composition of the culture after 48 hours of treatment with both Activin A and the Nodal pathway inhibitor?\n\nA. The culture will be predominantly composed of mesodermal cells, characterized by the expression of the marker gene *Brachyury (T)*, because the signaling levels are disrupted but not eliminated.\n\nB. The culture will consist almost entirely of undifferentiated PSCs, expressing pluripotency markers like *OCT4*, as the primary differentiation cue was nullified.\n\nC. The cells will successfully differentiate into definitive endoderm, characterized by markers like *SOX17* and *FOXA2*, as the high concentration of Activin A is sufficient to overcome the inhibitor's effect.\n\nD. The culture will fail to form endoderm and will instead be composed mainly of cells expressing neuroectoderm markers, such as *SOX1* and *PAX6*.", "solution": "The key developmental signaling principle is that high Nodal/Activin signaling is necessary and sufficient to drive PSCs into definitive endoderm via SMAD2/3-mediated transcriptional programs (including induction of endoderm markers such as *SOX17* and *FOXA2*). The problem specifies that a potent and specific inhibitor is added that completely blocks Nodal/Activin signaling immediately downstream of the receptor. Therefore, despite the presence of high concentrations of Activin A, intracellular signal transduction through the Nodal/Activin pathway is effectively eliminated.\n\nGiven that definitive endoderm requires active Nodal/Activin signaling, complete pathway blockade prevents endoderm specification and the induction of endodermal markers. Mesodermal differentiation generally depends on intermediate levels or combinations of TGF-β family and other signals (e.g., BMP/WNT context), which are also not available here due to the explicit complete blockade of the Nodal/Activin branch. The problem further states that, in the absence of specific cues directing endoderm or mesoderm, PSCs in this culture medium follow a default differentiation trajectory toward neuroectoderm. Therefore, with Nodal/Activin signaling disabled and no compensatory mesendoderm cues, the culture will proceed along the default neuroectoderm pathway and express markers such as *SOX1* and *PAX6*.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because mesoderm requires appropriate signaling, and the pathway is stated to be completely blocked, not partially “disrupted.”\n- B is incorrect because the default trajectory in this context is differentiation to neuroectoderm, not maintenance of pluripotency; absence of Nodal/Activin does not itself enforce pluripotency without pluripotency-maintaining signals.\n- C is incorrect because a downstream block cannot be overcome by ligand abundance; no signal transduction occurs.\n- D is correct because, with endodermal signaling absent, the culture differentiates by default to neuroectoderm, expressing *SOX1* and *PAX6*.\n\nThus, the most likely cellular composition after 48 hours is predominantly neuroectodermal cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1704582"}, {"introduction": "Once the correct progenitor cells are generated, the next challenge is to orchestrate their assembly into a complex, three-dimensional structure—a process called morphogenesis. In lung development, this involves intricate branching, guided by a delicate dialogue between opposing signaling molecules like FGF10 and SHH. This problem [@problem_id:1704584] presents a classic troubleshooting scenario where an experiment has gone wrong, asking you to diagnose the molecular culprit behind a failure in branching morphogenesis.", "problem": "A developmental biology research group is attempting to generate lung organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. The protocol involves differentiating the stem cells into foregut spheroids and then embedding them in a matrix and culturing them in a specialized \"Lung Differentiation Medium\" (LDM) to induce branching morphogenesis. The canonical model for lung branching involves a critical interplay between Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10), secreted by the surrounding mesenchymal cells, and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), secreted by the epithelial cells of the lung bud. FGF10 promotes the outgrowth of the lung bud tips, while SHH from the epithelium inhibits *FGF10* expression in the mesenchyme adjacent to the stalk of the bud, thereby restricting growth to the tips and facilitating branching.\n\nThe LDM used in the experiment contains the following key small molecules and growth factors:\n- Retinoic Acid (RA)\n- Noggin\n- FGF10\n- CHIR99021 (a Wnt pathway activator)\n- Cyclopamine\n\nAfter 10 days of culture, the researchers observe that while the spheroids have grown significantly, they have formed large, simple, hollow cystic structures composed of lung epithelial cells. However, they have completely failed to undergo the expected branching morphogenesis. Based on your understanding of lung developmental signaling, which component in the LDM is the most likely culprit responsible for this specific aberrant phenotype?\n\nA. Noggin\n\nB. FGF10\n\nC. Cyclopamine\n\nD. Retinoic Acid (RA)\n\nE. CHIR99021", "solution": "We are asked to identify which component in the Lung Differentiation Medium most likely causes robust epithelial growth into large, simple hollow cysts without branching. The canonical mechanism of lung branching relies on the spatially restricted action of FGF10 and the negative feedback from SHH:\n- Mesenchymal FGF10 promotes outgrowth and maintains a distal, proliferative bud tip state.\n- Epithelial SHH represses *FGF10* expression in the mesenchyme adjacent to the stalk, restricting FGF10 activity to the tips. This spatial restriction is essential for repetitive tip bifurcation and branching.\n\nIf SHH signaling is inhibited, the negative feedback on mesenchymal *FGF10* expression is lost, leading to ectopic or expanded FGF10 signaling around the bud rather than being confined to tips. This removes the spatial restriction necessary for branch patterning and instead produces distended, cystic outgrowths with failed branching—phenotypes characteristic of SHH pathway loss-of-function or pharmacologic Smoothened inhibition.\n\nAmong the listed components:\n- Cyclopamine is a Smoothened inhibitor that blocks Hedgehog signaling. Its presence would abrogate SHH-mediated repression of *FGF10*, leading to the observed cystic, non-branching phenotype.\n- FGF10 is necessary for growth and tip maintenance; while excessive or spatially uniform FGF10 can bias toward cystic expansion, in the canonical model the specific failure of branching due to loss of SHH-mediated restriction is most directly explained by Hedgehog pathway inhibition rather than the mere presence of FGF10.\n- Retinoic Acid can modulate proximodistal patterning and *FGF10* expression levels, but excess RA typically reduces outgrowth and branching rather than causing large cysts.\n- Noggin (BMP inhibition) is generally permissive for branching in this context rather than causing a loss of branching with cyst formation.\n- CHIR99021 (Wnt activation) promotes distal progenitor identity and proliferation but does not specifically abolish SHH’s spatially restrictive role in FGF10 signaling required for branching.\n\nTherefore, the component most likely responsible for the cystic, non-branching phenotype is cyclopamine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1704584"}, {"introduction": "The final, critical phase of any organoid experiment is validation: confirming that the resulting structure accurately mimics the architecture of the target organ. A powerful technique for this is immunofluorescence, which uses antibodies to 'paint' specific cell types in their native positions. This practice [@problem_id:1704611] puts you in the role of an analyst, tasking you with interpreting staining patterns from markers like **BRN3A** and **CRX** to determine if a retinal organoid has successfully self-organized into its characteristic layers.", "problem": "A student in a developmental biology lab is culturing retinal organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. The goal is to model the early stages of retinal development in vitro. After 60 days in culture, the student fixes, sections, and performs immunofluorescence staining on an organoid to assess its cellular composition and organization. The student uses a panel of antibodies against specific proteins known to be markers for different retinal cell types.\n\nThe standard developmental profile for cell types and their marker proteins is as follows:\n- **Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs):** These are the first neurons to differentiate and form the innermost layer of the neural retina (closest to the optic nerve in vivo, or the lumen/core of the organoid). They are identified by the marker **BRN3A**.\n- **Photoreceptor Precursors:** These cells give rise to rods and cones and form the Outer Nuclear Layer, which is located externally to the RGC layer. They are identified by the marker **CRX**.\n- **Müller Glia:** These are the principal glial cells of the retina, providing structural support. They are identified by the marker **SOX9**.\n- **Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE):** This is a single layer of pigmented cells that lies adjacent to the neural retina, forming its outermost boundary. It is identified by the marker **RPE65**.\n\nUpon imaging the stained organoid section, the student observes the following distinct patterns:\n1.  A strong, localized signal for **BRN3A** in a well-defined layer at the innermost surface of the organoid, facing its central lumen.\n2.  A strong, localized signal for **CRX** in a thick layer situated externally to the BRN3A-positive layer.\n3.  A signal for **SOX9** from cells interspersed within the other layers, consistent with glial cell distribution.\n4.  A distinct, single-cell-thick layer positive for **RPE65** forming the absolute outermost boundary of the entire organoid structure.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion about the state of the retinal organoid?\n\nA. The organoid has failed to properly differentiate, as the presence of CRX-positive cells indicates it is composed only of precursors.\n\nB. The organoid shows inverted lamination, with photoreceptors located where ganglion cells should be, indicating a major structural defect.\n\nC.

The observed strong, localized BRN3A signal at the innermost surface facing the lumen matches the correct position for RGCs. This supports proper inner layer specification rather than inversion.\n2. The observed strong CRX signal in a thick layer external to the BRN3A-positive layer matches the expected outer nuclear positioning of photoreceptor precursors. This contradicts inversion or random mixing.\n3.
