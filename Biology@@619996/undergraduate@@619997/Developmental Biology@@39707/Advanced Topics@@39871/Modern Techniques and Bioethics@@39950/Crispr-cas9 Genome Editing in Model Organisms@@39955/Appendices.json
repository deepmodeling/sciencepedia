After performing a CRISPR-Cas9 edit designed to disrupt a gene, the essential next step is to confirm that the intended mutation has occurred. This exercise [@problem_id:1677944] simulates a standard laboratory workflow, challenging you to predict the results of a genotyping assay and connecting the molecular event of a CRISPR-induced indel to the tangible data from PCR and gel electrophoresis.", "problem": "A developmental biologist aims to create a knockout of a novel gene, designated *neuro-pattern-1* (*np1*), in the model organism *Xenopus laevis* (the African clawed frog). The function of *np1* in neural tube formation is unknown. To achieve the knockout, the researcher utilizes the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. This system is designed to introduce a double-strand break in a critical exon of the *np1* gene. The cell's native repair mechanism, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), is expected to repair this break, but in an error-prone manner that often creates small insertions or deletions (indels). These indels can cause a frameshift mutation, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n\nTo screen for successful gene editing, the researcher collects genomic DNA from tadpoles that developed from the injected embryos. A Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is then performed. The primers for this PCR are designed to bind to the genomic DNA on either side of the CRISPR-Cas9 target site. For a wild-type (unmutated) *np1* allele, this PCR is known to produce a DNA fragment of exactly 300 base pairs (bp). The resulting PCR products are analyzed using high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a technique that can resolve differences in DNA fragment size of just a few base pairs.\n\nThe researcher is specifically looking for heterozygous mutant tadpoles, which possess one wild-type *np1* allele and one mutated *np1* allele containing a small indel. Which of the following results on the electrophoresis gel would be the definitive evidence for a heterozygous *np1* mutant?\n\nA. A single, clear band at the 300 bp position.\n\nB. A complete absence of any bands in the lane.\n\nC. A single, clear band located at a position slightly different from 300 bp (e.g., 295 bp or 305 bp).\n\nD. Two distinct bands: one at the 300 bp position and a second band at a position slightly different from 300 bp.\n\nE. A \"smear\" of DNA across a wide range of sizes with no distinct bands.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the expected result on an electrophoresis gel for a tadpole that is heterozygous for a CRISPR-induced mutation in the *np1* gene.\n\nStep 1: Understand the genetic makeup of a heterozygous mutant.\nA heterozygous individual has two different versions (alleles) of a particular gene at a specific locus on its homologous chromosomes. In this scenario, the tadpole has inherited one unmodified, wild-type *np1* allele and one *np1* allele that has been successfully mutated by the CRISPR-Cas9 system.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the mutation on the DNA sequence.\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system with NHEJ repair creates indels, which are small insertions or deletions of base pairs. This means the mutated *np1* allele will have a slightly different length compared to the wild-type allele at the targeted region. For example, a 5 bp deletion would make the region 5 bp shorter, while a 2 bp insertion would make it 2 bp longer.\n\nStep 3: Determine the outcome of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).\nThe PCR primers are designed to flank the targeted site. This means they will amplify the segment of DNA containing the potential indel.\n- When the PCR primers anneal to the wild-type chromosome, they will amplify the wild-type allele, producing a DNA fragment of exactly 300 bp, as stated in the problem.\n- When the PCR primers anneal to the mutated chromosome, they will amplify the mutated allele. Because this allele has an indel, the resulting DNA fragment will be slightly shorter or longer than 300 bp. For instance, a 5 bp deletion would yield a 295 bp fragment, and a 2 bp insertion would yield a 302 bp fragment.\nSince the genomic DNA from the heterozygous tadpole contains both alleles, the PCR will simultaneously amplify both versions. The final PCR product will be a mixture of 300 bp fragments and fragments of a slightly different size.\n\nStep 4: Predict the result of gel electrophoresis.\nGel electrophoresis is a technique that separates molecules, like DNA fragments, based on their size. Smaller fragments travel faster and further through the gel matrix than larger fragments.\n- The 300 bp fragments from the wild-type allele will migrate to a specific position in the gel, forming a distinct band.\n- The slightly smaller or larger fragments from the mutated allele will migrate to a slightly different position, forming a second distinct band very close to the first one. A smaller fragment (deletion) will form a band that has migrated further than the 300 bp band, while a larger fragment (insertion) will form a band that has migrated less far.\nTherefore, the electrophoresis gel for a heterozygous mutant will show two distinct bands.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. A single, clear band at the 300 bp position indicates that only 300 bp fragments are present. This would be the result for a homozygous wild-type individual that was not successfully mutated.\n- B. A complete absence of any bands would suggest that the PCR failed for technical reasons (e.g., bad primers, no DNA template). It is not an indicator of a specific genotype.\n- C. A single, clear band located at a position slightly different from 300 bp would indicate that only mutated alleles are present. This would be the result for a homozygous mutant individual, where both alleles carry an indel of the same (or very similar) size.\n- D. Two distinct bands, one at 300 bp and another slightly shifted, correctly represents the presence of both the 300 bp wild-type PCR product and the slightly different-sized mutant PCR product. This is the definitive signature of a heterozygous individual.\n- E. A \"smear\" of DNA typically indicates non-specific amplification or DNA degradation and does not represent a clean genotyping result.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1677944"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply disrupting genes, the precision of CRISPR-Cas9 can be harnessed to insert new genetic sequences, such as fluorescent tags, into specific locations in the genome. This powerful \"knock-in\" approach relies on the cell's Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) pathway, which requires a custom-designed DNA donor template. This practice [@problem_id:1677880] asks you to think like a molecular engineer, determining the correct linear arrangement of the components needed to create a functional fusion protein for visualizing protein localization.", "problem": "A developmental biologist aims to visualize the subcellular localization of a protein, encoded by a gene named *Phantasia* (*PNT*), in a living zebrafish embryo. To achieve this, the researcher plans to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to insert the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) at the 3' end of the *PNT* gene's coding region. This will create a PNT-GFP fusion protein, where the GFP tag is attached to the C-terminus of the PNT protein.\n\nThe strategy involves guiding the Cas9 nuclease to create a double-strand break in the DNA immediately before the *PNT* gene's native stop codon. Following the cut, the cell's Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) pathway will be utilized to integrate a custom-designed donor DNA template into the genome.\n\nThe donor DNA template must be constructed from several key elements:\n- **Left Homology Arm (LHA):** A sequence of DNA identical to the genomic region immediately upstream of the intended insertion site.\n- **Right Homology Arm (RHA):** A sequence of DNA identical to the genomic region immediately downstream of the intended insertion site.\n- **GFP Coding Sequence (GFP-CDS):** The DNA sequence that codes for the GFP protein.\n- **Linker Sequence:** A short DNA sequence that codes for a flexible peptide linker to ensure both the PNT protein and the GFP tag can fold correctly.\n- **Stop Codon:** A new translational termination codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\nAssuming the Cas9 nuclease successfully cuts exactly at the boundary between the last coding codon of *PNT* and its original stop codon, which of the following describes the correct linear arrangement of elements in an HDR donor template that will produce a functional C-terminal PNT-GFP fusion protein?\n\nA.

RHA (matches 3' UTR region after original stop codon) - Linker Sequence - GFP-CDS - Stop Codon - LHA (matches end of *PNT* coding region)", "solution": "The goal is to create a functional C-terminal fusion protein PNT-GFP by inserting the GFP coding sequence in-frame immediately before the native stop codon of *PNT*, using HDR after a Cas9-induced double-strand break at the boundary between the final coding codon and the original stop codon.\n\nPrinciple 1: HDR requires homology arms flanking the insertion payload. Therefore, the Left Homology Arm (LHA) must match the genomic sequence immediately upstream of the cut site (i.e., the end of the *PNT* coding region), and the Right Homology Arm (RHA) must match the sequence immediately downstream of the cut site (i.e., the 3' UTR region following the original stop codon). This ensures precise integration at the intended site.\n\nPrinciple 2: To produce a C-terminal fusion, translation must proceed from the *PNT* coding sequence into the inserted tag without interruption. Thus, the inserted payload must be in-frame and ordered such that the *PNT* coding sequence is followed by an optional flexible linker, then the GFP coding sequence, and finally a translational stop codon. The linker helps both domains fold correctly but does not affect translation logic.\n\nPrinciple 3: If the donor replaces the sequence at the cut site via HDR, the original stop codon will be displaced by the inserted payload and will not remain in the mRNA. Therefore, a new stop codon must be included after GFP to terminate translation properly. Omitting a stop codon would lead to translation into the 3' UTR until the next in-frame stop codon, which is undesirable and potentially deleterious.\n\nApplying these principles to the options:\n- Option A places LHA, then linker, then GFP coding sequence, then a new stop codon, then RHA that matches the 3' UTR. This preserves the reading frame, appends GFP at the C-terminus, and properly terminates translation. This is correct.\n- Option B places a stop codon immediately after LHA, which would terminate translation before GFP, preventing the fusion. This is incorrect.\n- Option C omits a stop codon in the payload. Since HDR replaces the original stop codon region, this would lack a proper termination signal. This is incorrect.\n- Option D uses homology arms at the 5' side and beginning of the coding region, which does not target the correct insertion site for a C-terminal fusion. This is incorrect.\n- Option E reverses the homology arms, which is incompatible with HDR directionality and genomic context. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct linear arrangement is LHA - Linker - GFP-CDS - Stop Codon - RHA, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1677880"}, {"introduction": "The biological impact of a gene edit depends critically on the molecular nature of the resulting mutation—not all mutations are created equal. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1677893] explores how different editing outcomes, a frameshift-inducing null mutation versus a specific in-frame deletion, can lead to dramatically different phenotypes. Successfully analyzing this scenario requires a deeper understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships, including the crucial concepts of haplosufficiency and dominant-negative protein interference.", "problem": "A developmental biology research group is investigating the function of a novel gene, *Connectin* (*CNN*), in a vertebrate model system. The Connectin protein is a structural component of cell-cell junctions, and it must form stable homodimers to function correctly. This dimerization is mediated by a specific N-terminal domain. Genetic knockout studies have confirmed that a complete loss of Connectin function leads to severe defects in tissue integrity and is embryonically lethal.\n\nThe researchers use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to disrupt the *CNN* gene in a large population of totipotent embryonic stem cells. The guide RNA is designed to target the exon encoding the critical dimerization domain. After the editing procedure, the cells are cultured to form embryoid bodies, and the resulting genomic DNA from the entire population is analyzed by deep sequencing. Two separate experiments, using different editing conditions, produce the following distinct outcomes:\n\n**Scenario A:** The editing process was highly active. The sequencing analysis reveals that 80% of all *CNN* alleles in the cell population have been mutated. Among these mutated alleles, 95% carry the exact same 12-base-pair in-frame deletion, removing four amino acids from the core of the dimerization domain. The remaining 5% of mutated alleles consist of a diverse set of small frameshift-causing insertions or deletions (indels).\n\n**Scenario B:** The editing process was less efficient. The sequencing analysis shows that only 25% of all *CNN* alleles in the population have been mutated. In this case, 100% of the mutations are unique small indels (insertions or deletions not divisible by three) that cause frameshifts upstream of the dimerization domain. These frameshift mutations are all confirmed to be null alleles, producing no functional protein.\n\nIt is known that the *CNN* gene is not haploinsufficient, meaning that a cell with one wild-type allele and one null allele produces enough functional Connectin to form normal cell-cell junctions. Based on this information, which scenario is more likely to cause a catastrophic failure in tissue integrity and a more severe overall phenotype in the resulting embryoid bodies?\n\nA. Scenario A, because the overall frequency of mutated alleles (80%) is much higher than in Scenario B (25%).\n\nB. Scenario B, because frameshift mutations are fundamentally more destructive to protein structure than in-frame deletions.\n\nC. The phenotypic severity will be approximately equal, as the higher mutation frequency in Scenario A is balanced by the more damaging nature of the null mutations in Scenario B.\n\nD. Scenario A, because the specific in-frame deletion is likely to produce a mutant protein that actively interferes with the function of the normal protein produced by the wild-type allele.\n\nE. Scenario B, because the high diversity of different null mutations overwhelms the cellular repair and quality control mechanisms more than a single, uniform mutation.", "solution": "We are asked to compare the expected phenotypic severity in two CRISPR editing scenarios for a homodimeric structural protein, Connectin (CNN). The key biological principles are:\n- CNN must form homodimers to function. For multimeric proteins, mutants that can still assemble but render the complex nonfunctional often act as dominant negative (DN) alleles.\n- The *CNN* gene is not haploinsufficient: one wild-type (WT) allele and one null allele is sufficient for normal function.\n- Frameshift mutations upstream that cause null alleles typically produce no stable protein (e.g., via nonsense-mediated decay), so they do not poison complexes; instead, the phenotype depends on zygosity and haploinsufficiency.\n- A specific in-frame deletion within the core of a dimerization domain is likely to produce a stable mutant protein with impaired function that can still interact with WT subunits, a classic setup for dominant-negative interference.\n\nTo make the comparison explicit, assume independent editing of the two alleles per cell and define per-allele categories:\n- $w$: WT allele,\n- $m$: the specific in-frame deletion that likely yields a dominant-negative monomer,\n- $f$: a null allele (frameshift).\n\nScenario A provides per-allele probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{mutated})=0.80,\\quad P(m \\mid \\text{mutated})=0.95,\\quad P(f \\mid \\text{mutated})=0.05.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nw=0.20,\\quad m=0.80 \\times 0.95=0.76,\\quad f=0.80 \\times 0.05=0.04.\n$$\nAssuming independence, the cell-level genotype frequencies are:\n$$\nP(ww)=w^{2}=0.04,\\quad P(wm)=2wm=0.304,\\quad P(wf)=2wf=0.016,\n$$\n$$\nP(mm)=m^{2}=0.5776,\\quad P(mf)=2mf=0.0608,\\quad P(ff)=f^{2}=0.0016,\n$$\nwhich sum to $(w+m+f)^{2}=1$. The functional consequences are:\n- $ww$ are normal.\n- $wf$ are normal because CNN is haplosufficient; null produces no mutant protein to interfere.\n- Any genotype containing $m$ ($wm$, $mm$, $mf$) is expected to be severely compromised by dominant-negative interference. For $wm$ cells, if each allele expresses equally, the WT monomer fraction is $p=0.5$ and the functional homodimer fraction scales as $p^{2}=0.25$, while heterodimers $2pq=0.5$ and mutant homodimers $q^{2}=0.25$ are nonfunctional; this strongly reduces functional complex formation. For $mm$ or $mf$, there is no WT allele, so no functional dimers. Therefore, an estimated $0.9424$ of cells ($wm+mm+mf$) are functionally compromised in Scenario A.\n\nScenario B provides per-allele probabilities:\n$$\nw=0.75,\\quad f=0.25,\\quad m=0.\n$$\nThus genotype frequencies are:\n$$\nP(ww)=0.5625,\\quad P(wf)=0.375,\\quad P(ff)=0.0625.\n$$\nBecause $wf$ are normal (haplosufficient) and frameshifts yield null products that do not poison WT complexes, only $ff$ cells ($0.0625$) are defective. Moreover, in $wf$ cells the monomer pool is entirely WT (no dominant-negative monomer), so the fraction of functional dimers is effectively $1$ with respect to composition, and the total amount is sufficient by the haplosufficiency criterion.\n\nTherefore, Scenario A is expected to be far more severe: a high fraction of cells will express a specific in-frame mutant that dominantly interferes with WT through poisoned dimerization, leading to widespread failure of CNN function. Scenario B primarily yields heterozygous null cells that remain functional, with only a small fraction of homozygous null cells defective.\n\nThis directly matches option D: the specific in-frame deletion in the dimerization core is likely to produce a dominant-negative protein that actively interferes with the normal protein, making Scenario A more catastrophic despite the general destructiveness of frameshifts per allele.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1677893"}]}
