This fundamental practice [@problem_id:1715345] will guide you through the process of using canonical marker genes to annotate spatial domains, a critical first step in interpreting any spatial genomics experiment.", "problem": "A developmental biology research team is studying gastrulation in a vertebrate embryo using a technique called spatial transcriptomics. This method allows them to measure the expression levels of all genes at thousands of distinct locations within a tissue slice of the embryo. After collecting the data, a computational algorithm identifies three large, spatially distinct clusters of cells, which they hypothesize correspond to the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\n\nTo test this hypothesis and assign a definitive identity to each cluster, the team needs to check for the expression of well-known \"marker genes.\" A marker gene is a gene that is known from previous studies to be highly and specifically expressed in a particular cell type or tissue during a specific developmental stage. Their goal is to find the cluster representing the ectoderm. They examine the spatial expression patterns of several genes.\n\nWhich of the following genes would serve as the most specific and reliable marker for identifying the ectoderm cluster at the gastrula stage?\n\nA. *Actb* (Beta-actin)\n\nB. *T* (Brachyury)\n\nC. *MyoD* (Myogenic differentiation 1)\n\nD. *Sox2* (SRY-box transcription factor 2)\n\nE. *Gata4* (GATA binding protein 4)", "solution": "Goal: Identify the most specific and reliable marker gene for ectoderm at the gastrula stage using the criterion that a marker gene is highly and specifically expressed in the target tissue at the relevant developmental stage.\n\nEvaluate each option against specificity and stage-appropriateness:\n\n- Option A: Actb (Beta-actin) encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is ubiquitously expressed in essentially all cell types as a housekeeping gene. It lacks tissue specificity and therefore cannot distinguish ectoderm from mesoderm or endoderm. Hence, not a suitable ectoderm marker.\n\n- Option B: T (Brachyury) is a classic marker of mesoderm, especially the primitive streak and nascent mesoderm during gastrulation. Its expression is largely restricted to mesodermal progenitors and not ectoderm. Thus, it marks the mesoderm cluster, not ectoderm.\n\n- Option C: MyoD (Myogenic differentiation 1) is a master regulator for skeletal muscle lineage commitment, typically expressed later in paraxial mesoderm derivatives (somites) rather than early during gastrulation, and is not an ectoderm marker. It is neither specific to ectoderm nor appropriately expressed at the gastrula stage for broad ectoderm identification.\n\n- Option D: Sox2 (SRY-box transcription factor 2) is expressed in the epiblast and becomes specifically enriched in neural ectoderm during gastrulation and neurulation. At the gastrula stage, Sox2 is widely used as a neural ectoderm marker due to its high and relatively specific expression in the neural plate territory compared with mesoderm and endoderm. Among the listed options, it provides the most specific and reliable identification of ectodermal identity in a spatial transcriptomic dataset at this stage.\n\n- Option E: Gata4 (GATA binding protein 4) is associated with endoderm and mesendoderm lineages (including visceral endoderm and early cardiac mesoderm). It is not specific to ectoderm and therefore marks non-ectodermal clusters.\n\nConclusion: Among the given choices, Sox2 is the most specific and reliable marker for identifying the ectoderm cluster at the gastrula stage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1715345"}, {"introduction": "Once a specific tissue or cell population has been identified on a spatial map, the next step is often discovery. We can ask: what is the unique molecular signature of this region? The standard computational approach to answer this is Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis, which statistically identifies genes enriched in our region of interest compared to all others. This exercise [@problem_id:1715361] simulates this core task, challenging you to select the appropriate analytical method for discovering novel marker genes from a list of common bioinformatics procedures.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is using a spatial transcriptomics platform to map gene expression in a developing mouse embryo. After data acquisition and initial quality control, the analysis pipeline groups the thousands of spatial measurement spots into distinct clusters based on their gene expression profiles. By correlating these clusters with an adjacent tissue histology stain, the biologist confidently identifies one cluster, let's call it 'Cluster M', that corresponds precisely to the metanephric mesenchyme, the progenitor tissue of the kidney.\n\nThe next major objective is to discover the \"marker genes\" for this tissue—that is, the genes whose expression is significantly higher in Cluster M compared to all other clusters combined.\n\nWhich of the following computational methods is the most direct and appropriate next step to achieve this specific goal?\n\nA. Perform a Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis comparing the gene expression in Cluster M against all other clusters.\n\nB. Calculate a new Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the expression data from all spots to find the components that best explain the variance.\n\nC. Select the 100 genes with the highest average expression within Cluster M and perform a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on this list.\n\nD. Construct a gene co-expression network to identify modules of genes whose expression levels are correlated across the entire tissue slice.\n\nE. Apply a trajectory inference algorithm to order all spots along a developmental pseudotime to model the process of kidney differentiation.", "solution": "Goal clarification: The biologist wants marker genes for the metanephric mesenchyme, defined as genes whose expression is significantly higher in Cluster M than in all other clusters combined. This is a supervised, group-comparison problem: for each gene, test whether its expression is greater in Group 1 (Cluster M) than in Group 2 (all other spots).\n\nMapping the goal to a computational task: The standard and most direct approach is differential gene expression (DGE) analysis between predefined groups. This entails, for each gene, computing a test statistic comparing Cluster M versus the rest, estimating an effect size (e.g., log fold-change), and controlling for multiple testing to obtain statistically significant genes with positive effect size in Cluster M. In single-cell or spatial transcriptomics, commonly used tests include Wilcoxon rank-sum, likelihood-ratio tests from generalized linear models (e.g., negative binomial), or model-based methods that account for count distributions and covariates. The output is exactly the list of marker genes enriched in Cluster M.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A (DGE comparing Cluster M vs all other clusters) directly implements the required supervised contrast and yields significance, effect sizes, and multiple-testing control, matching the marker gene definition.\n- Option B (PCA) is unsupervised dimensionality reduction to capture global variance, not designed to identify genes specifically overexpressed in Cluster M, and does not provide per-gene differential statistics against the rest.\n- Option C (top 100 by average expression in Cluster M followed by GO) does not ensure specificity to Cluster M, lacks statistical comparison to other clusters, and GO enrichment is an annotation step after, not a method to discover markers with significance.\n- Option D (co-expression network) finds correlated modules across the tissue, not genes specifically upregulated in Cluster M relative to others.\n- Option E (trajectory inference) orders spots along pseudotime; it addresses dynamic processes rather than identifying static cluster-specific markers and is unnecessary for the stated goal.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and appropriate next step is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1715361"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying regions, spatial transcriptomics provides quantitative data that allows us to model developmental processes. Many key events in embryogenesis are orchestrated by morphogen gradients—signals that spread from a source and pattern surrounding tissues in a concentration-dependent manner. In this problem [@problem_id:1715313], you will learn how to fit a mathematical model of exponential decay to spatial expression data, a powerful technique to quantify a biological gradient and extract a key biophysical parameter, the characteristic decay length $\\lambda$.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying dorsoventral patterning in the neural tube of a chick embryo, a process controlled by signaling gradients. A key signaling molecule, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (Bmp4), is secreted from a planar source at the roof plate (the most dorsal part of the neural tube) and diffuses ventrally, forming a concentration gradient. A simple, widely-used model based on source-diffusion-degradation dynamics suggests that the steady-state concentration of Bmp4, denoted $C(x)$, follows an exponential decay as a function of the distance $x$ from the source. The model is given by the equation:\n$$C(x) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $x$ is the distance in micrometers ($\\mu m$) measured ventrally from the roof plate, $A$ is the effective concentration at the source, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length of the gradient. Background expression of Bmp4 is considered negligible.\n\nUsing spatial transcriptomics, the biologist measures the Bmp4 transcript levels, which are assumed to be directly proportional to the Bmp4 protein concentration, at several positions along the dorsal-ventral axis. The following data points were obtained, where expression is quantified in normalized transcript counts (NTC):\n\n- At $x = 50.0 \\, \\mu m$, Expression = $150.0$ NTC\n- At $x = 100.0 \\, \\mu m$, Expression = $95.0$ NTC\n- At $x = 150.0 \\, \\mu m$, Expression = $55.2$ NTC\n- At $x = 200.0 \\, \\mu m$, Expression = $33.5$ NTC\n- At $x = 250.0 \\, \\mu m$, Expression = $20.3$ NTC\n\nTo quantify the gradient, you must determine the best-fit value for the characteristic decay length, $\\lambda$.
