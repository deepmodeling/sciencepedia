Consider a simplified one-dimensional system of two identical, adjacent biological cells, Cell 1 and Cell 2. The state of each cell is determined by the concentrations of two signaling molecules: an \"activator\" and an \"inhibitor\". The system follows these rules:\n\n1.  The activator promotes its own production (auto-activation) and also promotes the production of the inhibitor.\n2.  The inhibitor suppresses the production of the activator.\n3.  The activator diffuses very slowly between adjacent cells.\n4.  The inhibitor diffuses very rapidly between adjacent cells.\n\nInitially, both cells are in a stable state with identical low concentrations of both the activator and the inhibitor. A random fluctuation then causes the concentration of the activator to rise significantly in Cell 1. The system is then allowed to evolve to a new, stable patterned state.\n\nBased on the rules of this activator-inhibitor model, which of the following statements best describes the concentrations of the activator and inhibitor in Cell 2 in this new stable state?\n\nA. The activator concentration is high, and the inhibitor concentration is high.\n\nB. The activator concentration is high, and the inhibitor concentration is low.\n\nC.

By $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a}0$, this raises $g(a_{1},h_{1})$ and hence increases $h_{1}$ above $h^{*}$. Because $D_{h}$ is large, the inhibitor rapidly diffuses, driving $h_{2}$ upward and toward $h_{1}$, so both cells experience elevated inhibitor relative to $h^{*}$, with small spatial gradients.\n\nThe elevated $h_{2}$ suppresses $a_{2}$ via $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h}0$. Meanwhile, because $D_{a}\\ll D_{h}$, the activator diffuses slowly and does not substantially raise $a_{2}$; in addition, Cell 1 maintains high $a_{1}$ by auto-activation, further stabilizing the asymmetry. Consequently, in the new steady patterned state, Cell 2 has a low activator level (below $a^{*}$ due to inhibition) and a high inhibitor level (sustained by rapid diffusion from Cell 1 and any residual local production).\n\nTherefore, in Cell 2 the activator is low and the inhibitor is high, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1711136"}, {"introduction": "Once a pattern is established, a key question is what determines its physical characteristics, such as the size and spacing of animal spots.

This final exercise [@problem_id:1711142] delves into the subtler dynamics of pattern selection, asking you to consider how the biochemical reaction rates, distinct from diffusion, can tip the balance and cause a system to generate stripes instead of spots.", "problem": "A developmental biologist models the formation of pigmentation patterns on the skin of a hypothetical marine organism using a classic activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system. The model involves two chemical morphogens: an activator $A$, which promotes pigment production, and an inhibitor $I$, which suppresses it. The activator promotes its own production and also stimulates the production of the inhibitor. The inhibitor, in turn, suppresses the activator.\n\nThe system's behavior is governed by several key parameters:\n- $D_A$: The diffusion coefficient of the activator.\n- $D_I$: The diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor.\n- $\\gamma$: A parameter representing the production rate of the inhibitor in response to the activator's presence.\n- $\\delta$: A parameter representing the baseline decay rate of the activator.\n\nFor a specific set of \"reference\" parameters, the model correctly predicts a stable pattern of isolated, circular dark spots on a light background. A crucial condition for this pattern formation is that the inhibitor diffuses much faster than the activator, i.e., $D_I \\gg D_A$.\n\nThe biologist wishes to understand how a different subspecies, which exhibits a stable pattern of parallel stripes, might arise from the same underlying mechanism. Assuming the stripe pattern results from a single modification to the reference parameter set, which of the following changes is the most likely cause for the transition from a spot pattern to a stripe pattern?\n\nA. A significant increase in the inhibitor diffusion rate, $D_I$.\n\nB. A significant decrease in the activator diffusion rate, $D_A$.\n\nC. A significant decrease in the inhibitor production rate, $\\gamma$.\n\nD. Setting the activator and inhibitor diffusion rates to be equal, $D_A = D_I$.\n\nE. A significant increase in the activator's baseline decay rate, $\\delta$.", "solution": "We model the activator-inhibitor system by the standard reaction-diffusion equations\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} = f(A,I) + D_{A} \\nabla^{2} A, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} = g(A,I) + D_{I} \\nabla^{2} I,\n$$\nwhere $f$ encodes autocatalysis of $A$ with inhibition by $I$ and decay at baseline rate $\\delta$, and $g$ encodes production of $I$ stimulated by $A$ at strength $\\gamma$ with its own decay. Let $(A^{*},I^{*})$ be the spatially uniform steady state, and define the Jacobian at this state as\n$$\nJ=\\begin{pmatrix} f_{A}  f_{I} \\\\ g_{A}  g_{I} \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere subscripts denote partial derivatives evaluated at $(A^{*},I^{*})$. For an activator-inhibitor system, the signs at the steady state typically satisfy $f_{A}0$ (autocatalysis of $A$), $f_{I}0$ (inhibition of $A$ by $I$), $g_{A}0$ (production of $I$ by $A$), and $g_{I}0$ (self-decay of $I$).\n\nLinearizing about $(A^{*},I^{*})$ and seeking normal modes with wavenumber $k$ yields the dispersion relation with characteristic polynomial\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} - \\tau(k)\\lambda + \\Delta(k)=0,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\tau(k)=\\operatorname{tr}J - k^{2}(D_{A}+D_{I}), \\quad \\Delta(k)=\\det J - k^{2}(f_{A}D_{I}+g_{I}D_{A}) + k^{4} D_{A}D_{I}.\n$$\nThe Turing instability requires that the homogeneous steady state be stable without diffusion and unstable for some $k0$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}J0, \\quad \\det J0,\n$$\nand there exists $k0$ such that $\\max \\Re \\lambda(k)0$, which is ensured when\n$$\nf_{A}D_{I}+g_{I}D_{A}  0, \\quad \\left(f_{A}D_{I}+g_{I}D_{A}\\right)^{2} - 4 D_{A}D_{I}\\det J  0.\n$$\nBecause $f_{A}0$ and $g_{I}0$, these conditions are typically satisfied when $D_{I} \\gg D_{A}$, matching the stated reference condition for spot formation.\n\nTo understand a transition from spots (isolated peaks, often hexagonally packed) to stripes (labyrinthine patterns), we invoke known pattern selection in activator-inhibitor systems such as the Gierer-Meinhardt and Schnakenberg models. For fixed kinetics, increasing the diffusion ratio $D_{I}/D_{A}$ tends to favor isolated spot patterns, whereas decreasing the effective strength or range of inhibition relative to activation tends to favor extended, stripe-like patterns. Nonlinear selection (beyond linear instability) determines whether the primary pattern near onset is hexagons (spots) or stripes; however, a robust qualitative rule is:\n- Increasing the relative inhibitory spread or strength promotes spots.\n- Decreasing the relative inhibitory spread or strength promotes stripes or labyrinths.\n\nWe now assess each proposed single-parameter change against these principles:\n\nOption A: A significant increase in $D_{I}$ increases the diffusion ratio $D_{I}/D_{A}$. This strengthens the relative range of inhibition and pushes the system further into the regime favoring isolated spots rather than stripes. Thus A is unlikely to yield stripes.\n\nOption B: A significant decrease in $D_{A}$ also increases $D_{I}/D_{A}$. This again strengthens the relative range of inhibition, favoring spot patterns rather than stripes. Thus B is unlikely to yield stripes.\n\nOption C: A significant decrease in $\\gamma$ reduces the production rate of the inhibitor in response to the activator. In the Jacobian, this primarily reduces $g_{A}$ and the magnitude of $g_{I}$’s effective impact via the steady-state shift, weakening inhibition relative to activation. Nonlinearly, weaker inhibition allows activator domains to broaden and connect, causing a transition from isolated peaks (spots) to extended structures (stripes or labyrinths). This is a standard route to stripe formation in activator-inhibitor systems.\n\nOption D: Setting $D_{A}=D_{I}$ removes the necessary differential diffusion. With $f_{A}0$ and $g_{I}0$, the Turing conditions generally fail when $D_{A}=D_{I}$, eliminating diffusion-driven pattern formation rather than producing stripes. Thus D is not plausible.\n\nOption E: A significant increase in $\\delta$ increases the baseline decay of the activator, reducing $f_{A}$ effectively and suppressing activation. This tends to weaken or eliminate patterns or shift from stripes to spots by breaking extended activator domains, not the reverse. Thus E is not plausible for producing stripes.\n\nTherefore, among the listed single-parameter changes, decreasing the inhibitor production rate $\\gamma$ is the most likely to transform spots into stripes within the same activator-inhibitor mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1711142"}]}
