In a typical screen for recessive mutations, one must wait for the F3 generation to see a phenotype. This practice problem challenges you to interpret a situation where a defect appears immediately in the F1 generation, forcing us to consider dominant modes of inheritance like haploinsufficiency, a state where a single functional copy of a gene is not enough to produce a wild-type phenotype. [@problem_id:1687944]", "problem": "A developmental biologist is conducting a large-scale forward genetic screen in zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) to identify genes essential for proper heart formation. To do this, adult males of the P0 generation are treated with a chemical mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), which induces random point mutations in their germ cells. These mutagenized males are then crossed with wild-type females. The resulting embryos of the first filial (F1) generation are carefully examined for developmental defects.\n\nIn one specific cross, the researcher observes that approximately half of the F1 embryos display a severe heart defect known as *cardia bifida*, where two separate, small hearts form instead of a single fused one. The other half of the F1 embryos from the same cross appear completely normal. Based on this observation in the F1 generation, which of the following is the most likely conclusion about the nature of the induced mutation and the gene it affects?\n\nA. The mutation is autosomal recessive.\n\nB. The affected gene is subject to genomic imprinting, and the paternal allele is silenced.\n\nC. The mutation is a maternal-effect mutation.\n\nD. The affected gene exhibits haploinsufficiency.\n\nE. The mutation demonstrates incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.", "solution": "We model the effect of ENU as inducing random point mutations in the germline of P0 males. These males are crossed to wild-type females. In such a cross, any single induced mutation that has entered the spermatogonial stem cell lineage will be transmitted to half of the sperm. Let the relevant autosomal locus be denoted by $G$, with wild-type allele $G^{+}$ and a newly induced mutant allele $G^{m}$.\n\nAssume the sire’s germline is effectively heterozygous $G^{m}/G^{+}$ for the mutation at this locus, while the dam is wild-type $G^{+}/G^{+}$. The Mendelian segregation in the cross\n$$\nG^{m}/G^{+} \\;\\times\\; G^{+}/G^{+}\n$$\nyields the F1 genotypic distribution\n$$\nP(G^{m}/G^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(G^{+}/G^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nWe now consider how different genetic mechanisms map genotype to phenotype:\n\n1) Autosomal recessive (option A): A recessive loss-of-function requires $G^{m}/G^{m}$ for the phenotype. In the above cross, $G^{m}/G^{m}$ does not occur, so\n$$\nP(\\text{affected}) = 0,\n$$\nwhich contradicts the observation of approximately half affected F1. Therefore A is not consistent.\n\n2) Genomic imprinting with paternal allele silenced (option B): If the paternal allele is silenced, only the maternal allele is expressed. Since the mother is $G^{+}/G^{+}$, all embryos express the wild-type allele, so\n$$\nP(\\text{affected}) = 0,\n$$\ncontradicting the observation. Thus B is not consistent. (Note: a scenario with maternal allele silenced and paternal expressed could produce half affected, but that is not what option B states.)\n\n3) Maternal-effect mutation (option C): In maternal-effect genetics, the embryo’s phenotype is determined by the mother’s genotype. The mother here is wild-type, so all embryos would be normal:\n$$\nP(\\text{affected}) = 0,\n$$\ncontradicting the observation. Thus C is not consistent.\n\n4) Haploinsufficiency (option D): A haploinsufficient gene shows a phenotype in heterozygotes, i.e., $G^{m}/G^{+}$ is affected because one functional copy is insufficient. Given the segregation above,\n$$\nP(\\text{affected}) = P(G^{m}/G^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nwhich matches the observation that approximately half of the F1 embryos are affected. This is the simplest and most parsimonious explanation for a one-locus mutation showing a dominant loss-of-function effect in F1.\n\n5) Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (option E): While incomplete penetrance could, in principle, yield fewer than the expected fraction, the observation of approximately half embryos showing a severe, consistent phenotype and the other half completely normal aligns directly with a fully penetrant heterozygous effect. Without independent evidence of reduced penetrance or variable severity, E is not the most likely conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the observed one-to-one ratio of affected to unaffected F1 from a cross of a mutagenized male to a wild-type female is best explained by a dominant loss-of-function due to haploinsufficiency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1687944"}, {"introduction": "A successful genetic screen often yields a treasure trove of mutants, many of which may look identical. Before you can study the underlying genes, you face a critical sorting problem: have you found multiple mutations in one gene, or single mutations in many different genes? The complementation test is the elegant and essential genetic tool designed to answer exactly this question by grouping mutations into distinct genes, or \"complementation groups.\" [@problem_id:1687907]", "problem": "A developmental biologist conducting a forward genetic screen in *Drosophila melanogaster* isolates two independent, true-breeding mutant strains that both exhibit a completely wingless phenotype. Let's call these strains `mutant-1` and `mutant-2`. Both mutations are known to be recessive to the wild-type allele that confers normal wings.

To determine whether the mutations are allelic (in the same gene) or in different genes required for the same pathway, the classical approach is a complementation test: cross the two homozygous recessive mutant strains and inspect the F1 phenotype.\n\nLet wing formation require functional products of two genes, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. Denote wild-type alleles by $G_{i}$ and recessive loss-of-function alleles by $g_{i}$.\n\nCase 1 (mutations in different genes; complementation expected):\nTake mutant-1 to be $g_{1}/g_{1};\\,G_{2}/G_{2}$ and mutant-2 to be $G_{1}/G_{1};\\,g_{2}/g_{2}$.\nCrossing these gives F1:\n$$\n\\text{F1: } G_{1}/g_{1};\\,G_{2}/g_{2}.\n$$\nEach gene has at least one functional allele ($G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$), so the F1 produces functional products for both genes, yielding normal wings. This is complementation, indicating the mutations are in different genes.\n\nCase 2 (mutations are alleles of the same gene; no complementation):\nLet both mutations affect $G_{1}$ but be independent alleles. Write mutant-1 as $g_{1}^{(1)}/g_{1}^{(1)}$ and mutant-2 as $g_{1}^{(2)}/g_{1}^{(2)}$. Crossing these yields:\n$$\n\\text{F1: } g_{1}^{(1)}/g_{1}^{(2)}.\n$$\nThere is no wild-type allele $G_{1}$ present. Given both are recessive loss-of-function alleles of the same gene, the F1 lacks functional $G_{1}$ product and remains wingless. This is non-complementation, indicating both mutations are alleles of the same gene.\n\nTherefore, the correct experimental design is to cross mutant-1 with mutant-2 and score the F1 phenotype; interpretation is:\n- F1 normal wings implies mutations are in different genes.\n- F1 wingless implies mutations are alleles of the same gene.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A matches the complementation test and its correct interpretation.\n- B is incorrect: crossing a recessive mutant to wild type will generally yield normal F1 regardless of whether the two mutants affect the same or different genes; it does not compare mutant-1 to mutant-2.\n- C reverses the interpretation and is therefore incorrect.\n- D is unnecessary; F2 analysis is not required to determine allelism for recessive mutations; the F1 suffices.\n- E is uninformative: true-breeding recessive lines will self-cross to 100 percent mutant by definition and does not address allelism.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1687907"}, {"introduction": "Identifying genes is only the beginning; the ultimate goal is to understand how they work together to orchestrate development. When mutations in two different genes affect the same process, we can perform an epistasis analysis to infer their functional relationship.

Individuals homozygous for a recessive loss-of-function allele in this gene ($ano/ano$) are viable but are born completely without eyes.\n\nTo understand the genetic pathway, the biologist performs further experiments. They introduce a mutation in a second, newly discovered gene, called *blindspot* (`bli`), into the $ano/ano$ background, creating a double mutant line with the genotype $ano/ano ; bli/bli$.

The double mutant $ano/ano ; bli/bli$ also lacks eyes.\n\nThe classical operational definition of epistasis in double-mutant analysis is that, in a double mutant between two recessive loss-of-function alleles, the phenotype that is observed is said to be epistatic; the gene whose single-mutant phenotype matches the double-mutant phenotype is considered epistatic to the other. Strictly, assigning epistasis requires knowledge of both single-mutant phenotypes so that one can determine which phenotype the double mutant matches.\n\nHere, the only single-mutant phenotype we know is $ano/ano$, which lacks eyes. The double mutant matches this phenotype. This observation is consistent with, and commonly interpreted as, gene *ano* being epistatic to gene *bli*, because the *ano* mutation’s phenotype is the one that is manifest in the double mutant, i.e., any effect of the *bli* mutation (whatever it may be) is masked in the presence of the *ano* mutation. Although we cannot exclude possibilities such as $bli/bli$ alone having the same phenotype as $ano/ano$, the only choice that accords with the observed double-mutant equaling the *ano* phenotype is that *ano* is epistatic to *bli*.\n\nThe other options are not supported:\n- It is not justified to claim *bli* is epistatic to *ano* (A), because the double-mutant phenotype does not provide evidence that the double matches the unknown *bli* single-mutant phenotype.\n- Genetic redundancy (C) is contradicted by the fact that the *ano* single mutant already shows a complete loss of eyes; redundancy would typically yield no phenotype in either single mutant but a phenotype in the double.\n- We cannot conclude they must function in the same linear pathway (D); parallel pathways or independent requirements could also yield the same double-mutant outcome.\n- It is not required that the $bli/bli$ single mutant phenotype be identical to $ano/ano$ (E); it could be wild type, partially affected, or identical, and the current data do not resolve this.\n\nTherefore, among the provided statements, the most accurate and certain conclusion supported by the single known single-mutant phenotype and the double-mutant outcome is that gene *ano* is epistatic to gene *bli*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1687941"}]}
