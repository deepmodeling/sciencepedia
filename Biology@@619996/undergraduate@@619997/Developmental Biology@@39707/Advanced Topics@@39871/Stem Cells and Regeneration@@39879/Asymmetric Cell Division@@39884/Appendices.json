Asymmetric cell division is the key to maintaining this equilibrium, or homeostasis. This first exercise [@problem_id:1672107] asks you to explore the most fundamental consequence of deviating from this pattern, helping you build an intuitive understanding of how simple changes in division mode can lead to stem cell pool expansion or depletion.", "problem": "In many adult tissues, a population of stem cells is responsible for tissue maintenance and repair. A fundamental behavior of these cells is their mode of division. A stem cell can undergo an asymmetric division, where it produces one daughter cell identical to itself (a stem cell) and one daughter cell that will proceed along a differentiation pathway. This process maintains the stem cell pool at a constant size, a state known as homeostasis.\n\nAlternatively, a stem cell can undergo a symmetric division, where both daughter cells adopt the same fateâ€”either both become stem cells or both commit to differentiation.\n\nConsider a single adult stem cell in a tissue niche that normally divides asymmetrically. Suppose that due to a transient signaling error, this single stem cell undergoes one, and only one, symmetric division. What are the two distinct and possible outcomes for the change in the total number of stem cells within that niche immediately following this single event?\n\nSelect the option that correctly describes these two alternative outcomes.\n\nA. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche increases by one. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche remains the same.\n\nB. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche remains the same. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by one.\n\nC. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche increases by one. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by one.\n\nD. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche increases by two. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by two.\n\nE. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by one. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by two.", "solution": "Let the initial number of stem cells in the niche be $N$. Under normal asymmetric division, a stem cell produces one stem cell and one differentiating cell, so the stem cell count remains $N$.\n\nWith a single symmetric division event, there are two distinct possibilities:\n\n1. Symmetric self-renewal: the one stem cell produces two stem cells. The new stem cell count is $N+1$, a change of $+1$.\n\n2. Symmetric differentiation: the one stem cell produces two differentiating cells (no stem cells). The new stem cell count is $N-1$, a change of $-1$.\n\nTherefore, the two possible immediate outcomes for the total number of stem cells are an increase by one or a decrease by one, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1672107"}, {"introduction": "How does a cell 'know' which way to divide to produce different daughters? Often, the answer lies in its interaction with the surrounding environment. This practice problem [@problem_id:1672114] explores a common mechanism where external cues from a 'niche' and the geometric orientation of the mitotic spindle work together to control cell fate, illustrating a classic case of extrinsic regulation.", "problem": "In a developing tissue, a population of stem cells is maintained by its physical contact with a specialized 'niche' cell. This contact provides a localized signal to the stem cell. In response to this signal, a set of cell fate determinants, which we will call 'Stem Factors', accumulate on the inner side of the stem cell's plasma membrane specifically at the point of contact with the niche.\n\nDuring a normal, asymmetric division, the stem cell orients its mitotic spindle perpendicular to the niche-contact surface. The cell then divides along a cleavage plane that is perpendicular to the spindle's main axis. This process results in one daughter cell that remains in contact with the niche and inherits all the Stem Factors (becoming a new stem cell), while the other daughter cell is displaced from the niche and inherits no Stem Factors (and subsequently differentiates).\n\nNow, consider a scenario where a specific mutation causes the dividing stem cell to orient its mitotic spindle *parallel* to the niche-contact surface. Assuming the cell division process completes and the cleavage plane still forms perpendicular to the spindle's main axis, what is the most probable outcome for the two daughter cells?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will fail to receive the niche signal and will differentiate.\n\nB. Both daughter cells will inherit Stem Factors and niche contact, and both will become stem cells.\n\nC. One daughter cell will become a stem cell, and the other will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nD. The division will be identical to the normal outcome, with one stem cell and one differentiating cell.\n\nE. Both daughter cells will be pushed out of the niche, and a new stem cell will be recruited from elsewhere.", "solution": "Define the niche-contact surface as a plane $S$ and the spindle main axis as a vector $\\vec{s}$. The cleavage plane $P$ is always perpendicular to the spindle axis, so $P \\perp \\vec{s}$.\n\nNormal division:\n1. Given $\\vec{s} \\perp S$, it follows that $P \\parallel S$.\n2. The Stem Factors are localized to the inner membrane at the niche-contact region on $S$.\n3. With $P \\parallel S$, the cleavage plane separates the cell into a daughter adjacent to $S$ and a daughter displaced away from $S$.\n4. Consequently, the daughter adjacent to $S$ inherits the entire polarized cortical domain containing the Stem Factors and maintains niche contact, becoming a stem cell; the displaced daughter inherits none and differentiates.\n\nMutant division (spindle parallel to $S$):\n1. Given $\\vec{s} \\parallel S$, it follows that $P \\perp S$.\n2. With $P \\perp S$, the cleavage plane intersects the niche-contact surface $S$ and partitions the cortical domain at $S$.\n3. Therefore, each daughter cell inherits a portion of the niche-contacting membrane and, with it, a portion of the localized Stem Factors.\n4. Because both daughters retain contact with the niche and both inherit Stem Factors, both daughters receive the self-renewal signal.\n5. The most probable outcome is a symmetric division yielding two stem cells.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that both daughter cells will inherit Stem Factors and niche contact and both will become stem cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1672114"}, {"introduction": "Asymmetric division is not just for creating different cell types; it may also be a clever strategy for cells to manage aging by offloading damage.

You will use a quantitative model to analyze hypothetical experimental data, learning how to distinguish active biological processes from passive physical distribution.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the mechanism of cellular rejuvenation in a line of mammalian Neural Stem Cells (NSCs). These NSCs undergo asymmetric cell division, producing one larger, self-renewing stem cell and one smaller daughter cell that is committed to differentiation. The central hypothesis is that the self-renewing stem cell maintains its \"youth\" by actively segregating damaged protein aggregates into the differentiating daughter cell.\n\nTo test this, the researcher uses a strain of NSCs where a protein prone to aggregation is tagged with a fluorescent marker. The total fluorescence intensity within a cell is directly proportional to the amount of aggregated protein. The volume of the self-renewing stem cell ($V_m$) is consistently observed to be 1.80 times the volume of the differentiating daughter cell ($V_d$).\n\nThe researcher posits a null hypothesis of passive segregation, where in the absence of any active transport, the aggregates would distribute uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, and thus the amount of aggregate in each cell post-division would be proportional to its volume.\n\nTo quantify the degree of active transport, the researcher defines a metric called the Active Segregation Efficiency, $\\eta$, as:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{S_{\\text{obs}} - S_{\\text{passive}}}{1 - S_{\\text{passive}}} $$\nHere, $S_{\\text{obs}}$ is the observed fraction of the parent cell's total aggregates that is found in the differentiating daughter cell after division, and $S_{\\text{passive}}$ is the theoretical fraction that would be found in the differentiating daughter cell under the passive segregation hypothesis.\n\nIn a control experiment, the researcher measures the observed fraction of aggregates segregated into the differentiating daughter cell to be $F_{\\text{control}} = 0.750$.\nIn a second experiment, the cells are treated with a drug that inhibits cytoskeletal transport. Under these conditions, the measured fraction is reduced to $F_{\\text{drug}} = 0.425$.\n\nAssuming the drug treatment affects only the active transport component of segregation, calculate the absolute reduction in Active Segregation Efficiency ($\\Delta\\eta = \\eta_{\\text{control}} - \\eta_{\\text{drug}}$) caused by the inhibitor.
