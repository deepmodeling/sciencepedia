The mechanical response of the tissue to an external tensile force is primarily determined by the properties of the cell-cell junctions connecting these cells.\n\nIn a wild-type (WT) tissue, the stiffness of each cell-cell junction is modeled as the sum of two parallel components:\n1. A strong, active linkage involving the actomyosin cytoskeleton anchored to adherens junctions, contributing an effective stiffness $k_{strong}$.\n2. A weaker, passive background adhesion between the cell membranes, contributing an effective stiffness $k_{weak}$.\n\nA specific mutation is introduced, resulting in a mutant (MUT) tissue. This mutation disrupts a key protein responsible for linking the cytoskeleton to the adherens junctions. Consequently, the strong linkage is lost, and the stiffness of each cell-cell junction in the MUT tissue is determined solely by the passive background adhesion.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a strip of WT tissue with an initial, relaxed length of $L_0$ is subjected to a constant tensile force $F$.
