The organism's body axis is defined from an anterior pole (0% position) to a posterior pole (100% position).\n\nThe expression of a segmentation gene, let's call it `Gene B`, is controlled by two transcription factors: an activator, `Protein A`, and a repressor, `Protein R`.\n\n1.  `Protein A` is the product of `Gene A`. It is required to activate the transcription of `Gene B`. In a wild-type embryo, the concentration of `Protein A` is sufficient to activate `Gene B` in the region spanning from the anterior pole (0%) to the 60% position along the axis.\n2.  `Protein R` is the product of `Gene R`. It acts to repress the transcription of `Gene B`. In a wild-type embryo, `Protein R` is present and active throughout the posterior half, in the region from the 50% position to the 100% position.\n\nAssuming that repression by `Protein R` is dominant over activation by `Protein A` (i.e., `Gene B` cannot be expressed if `Protein R` is present, regardless of the `Protein A` concentration), consider a mutant embryo in which `Gene R` has a null mutation, resulting in a complete absence of functional `Protein R`.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting expression domain of `Gene B` in this `Gene R` null mutant embryo?\n\nA. The expression of `Gene B` is completely eliminated throughout the embryo.\n\nB. The expression domain of `Gene B` shifts to the posterior, now occupying the region from 60% to 100%.\n\nC. The expression domain of `Gene B` expands, now covering the region from 0% to 60%.\n\nD. The expression domain of `Gene B` is unchanged compared to the wild-type, remaining in the anterior half.\n\nE. The expression domain of `Gene B` shrinks, occupying a smaller region near the anterior pole from 0% to 25%.", "solution": "To determine the change in the expression domain of `Gene B`, we must first establish its expression pattern in the wild-type embryo and then compare it to the pattern in the `Gene R` null mutant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze `Gene B` expression in the wild-type embryo.**\n\nThe expression of `Gene B` requires two conditions to be met simultaneously:\n1.  The presence of the activator, `Protein A`, at a sufficient concentration.\n2.  The absence of the repressor, `Protein R`.\n\nLet's define the spatial domains for these conditions based on the problem statement:\n-   The \"activation domain\" where `Protein A` is at a sufficient concentration is the region from 0% to 60% of the body axis.\n-   The \"repression domain\" where `Protein R` is present is the region from 50% to 100%. Therefore, the region where the repressor is absent is the complementary domain, from 0% to 50%.\n\nThe expression of `Gene B` occurs only in the region where the activation domain and the non-repression domain overlap. We find the intersection of these two spatial domains:\nExpression Domain (Wild-Type) = (Activation Domain) $\\cap$ (Non-Repression Domain)\nExpression Domain (Wild-Type) = [0%, 60%] $\\cap$ [0%, 50%]\n\nThe intersection of the interval [0%, 60%] and [0%, 50%] is the interval [0%, 50%].\nThus, in a wild-type embryo, `Gene B` is expressed in the region from the anterior pole (0%) to the 50% position.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze `Gene B` expression in the `Gene R` null mutant embryo.**\n\nIn the null mutant, `Gene R` is non-functional, meaning no `Protein R` is produced. The repression is therefore completely removed.\nThe conditions for `Gene B` expression are now simplified:\n1.  The presence of the activator, `Protein A`, at a sufficient concentration.\n2.  The absence of the repressor, `Protein R`. This condition is now met everywhere in the embryo (from 0% to 100%) since `Protein R` is absent.\n\nThe expression of `Gene B` in the mutant is now solely determined by the presence of its activator, `Protein A`.\n-   The \"activation domain\" is unchanged: [0%, 60%].\n-   The \"non-repression domain\" is now the entire embryo: [0%, 100%].\n\nWe find the intersection of these new domains:\nExpression Domain (Mutant) = (Activation Domain) $\\cap$ (New Non-Repression Domain)\nExpression Domain (Mutant) = [0%, 60%] $\\cap$ [0%, 100%]\n\nThe intersection of the interval [0%, 60%] and [0%, 100%] is the interval [0%, 60%].\nThus, in the `Gene R` null mutant, `Gene B` is expressed in the region from the anterior pole (0%) to the 60% position.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the wild-type and mutant expression domains.**\n\n-   Wild-Type `Gene B` expression domain: [0%, 50%]\n-   Mutant `Gene B` expression domain: [0%, 60%]\n\nBy comparing the two, we see that the expression domain in the mutant has expanded posteriorly from the 50% boundary to the 60% boundary.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n\n-   A. The expression of `Gene B` is completely eliminated throughout the embryo. (Incorrect. Expression is expanded.)\n-   B. The expression domain of `Gene B` shifts to the posterior, now occupying the region from 60% to 100%. (Incorrect. The domain starts at 0% and is limited by the activator.)\n-   C. The expression domain of `Gene B` expands, now covering the region from 0% to 60%. (Correct. This matches our derivation.)\n-   D. The expression domain of `Gene B` is unchanged compared to the wild-type, remaining in the anterior half. (Incorrect. The removal of the repressor has an effect.)\n-   E. The expression domain of `Gene B` shrinks, occupying a smaller region near the anterior pole from 0% to 25%. (Incorrect. It expands.)\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the expression domain of `Gene B` expands to cover the region from 0% to 60%.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1689902"}, {"introduction": "Gene regulation often involves intricate circuits where genes control one another's activity. This exercise introduces a common and powerful network motif known as a \"double-negative gate\" or \"disinhibition,\" where one repressive action cancels another. Working through this problem [@problem_id:1689891] will help you understand how a chain of negative interactions can paradoxically result in activation, a non-intuitive but critical feature of many biological switches.", "problem": "In the developmental program of a hypothetical marine invertebrate, *Ficticia biolucens*, the formation of light-producing organs on its tentacles is a critical step. The light is generated by an enzyme encoded by the gene *LuxA*. The expression of *LuxA* is tightly regulated by a simple genetic circuit. A gene named *Umbra* encodes a transcriptional repressor protein, UMBRA, which binds to a specific silencer region upstream of the *LuxA* gene, thereby preventing its transcription. In the same tentacle cells, a microRNA (miRNA), designated as `mir-99`, is also expressed. This `mir-99` specifically recognizes and binds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of the *Umbra* gene, which leads to the degradation of the *Umbra* mRNA. In wild-type individuals, the tentacles are brightly bioluminescent.\n\nImagine a group of geneticists creates a mutant line of *Ficticia biolucens* in which the gene encoding `mir-99` is precisely and completely deleted, with no other changes to the organism's genome. Based on the described regulatory network, what is the most likely consequence for the expression of the *LuxA* gene and the resulting phenotype in these `mir-99` knockout mutants?\n\nA. The expression of the *LuxA* gene will be significantly decreased, resulting in little to no bioluminescence in the tentacles.\n\nB. The expression of the *LuxA* gene will be significantly increased, resulting in hyper-bioluminescent tentacles.\n\nC. The expression of the *LuxA* gene will be unaffected because the UMBRA protein is not the primary regulator of bioluminescence.\n\nD. The deletion of `mir-99` will cause the *Umbra* gene to be silenced, leading to increased *LuxA* expression.", "solution": "1. In the described circuit, UMBRA is a transcriptional repressor that binds a silencer upstream of the LuxA gene, thereby preventing LuxA transcription. By standard gene regulation principles, increased levels of a repressor protein reduce transcription of its target gene.\n\n2. The miRNA mir-99 binds Umbra mRNA and promotes its degradation. By the established mechanism of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, this decreases UMBRA protein levels.\n\n3. In wild type, mir-99 lowers UMBRA, which relieves repression on LuxA, allowing LuxA expression and bright bioluminescence.\n\n4. In a mir-99 knockout, Umbra mRNA is no longer targeted for degradation, so Umbra mRNA levels increase, leading to increased UMBRA protein.\n\n5. Increased UMBRA binding at the LuxA silencer increases repression of LuxA transcription, decreasing LuxA mRNA and protein (the bioluminescent enzyme), thus reducing bioluminescence.\n\n6. Therefore, the expected outcome is decreased LuxA expression and little to no bioluminescence, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1689891"}, {"introduction": "The journey from gene to function does not end with transcription; control can be exerted at multiple steps to fine-tune developmental outcomes. This problem [@problem_id:1689905] shifts the focus to post-transcriptional regulation, a crucial layer for refining protein expression patterns. You will investigate how a microRNA can intercept a messenger RNA molecule after it is made, preventing it from becoming a protein and thereby sculpting the final functional landscape of the embryo.", "problem": "In the early embryonic development of a hypothetical marine invertebrate, the specification of the central nervous system depends on the precise spatial expression of the gene *Neurogenin* (*Ngn*). The regulation of *Ngn* transcription is controlled by two main factors: a transcription factor protein called Activator-Y (ActY) and a repressive microRNA called miR-12.\n\nThe regulatory logic is as follows:\n1.  The transcription of the *Ngn* gene is initiated only in the presence of the activator protein ActY.\n2.  The translation of *Ngn* messenger RNA (mRNA) into Ngn protein is completely blocked if the microRNA miR-12 is present in the cell, as it targets the *Ngn* mRNA for degradation.\n\nSpatial analysis of the embryo reveals the following distribution of these regulatory molecules:\n- The protein ActY is found to be uniformly distributed throughout all cells of the entire embryo, from the anterior to the posterior pole.\n- The gene for miR-12 is transcribed exclusively in the cells that constitute the posterior half of the embryo. The resulting miR-12 molecules are stable and remain within the posterior half.\n\nAssuming Ngn protein is required for neural development, in which region of the embryo will neural tissues begin to form? Select the most accurate prediction from the options below.\n\nA. Neural tissues will form only in the posterior half of the embryo.\n\nB. Neural tissues will form throughout the entire embryo.\n\nC. Neural tissues will form only in the anterior half of the embryo.\n\nD. Neural tissues will not form anywhere in the embryo.\n\nE. Neural tissues will form in a narrow band at the boundary between the anterior and posterior halves.", "solution": "- By rule 1, transcription of the gene occurs only if the activator protein ActY is present. Given that ActY is uniformly present in all cells from anterior to posterior, this implies that $Ngn$ transcription occurs in all cells across the entire embryo.\n\n- By rule 2, the presence of miR-12 blocks translation of $Ngn$ mRNA into Ngn protein by targeting the mRNA for degradation. Since miR-12 is produced exclusively in, and remains confined to, the posterior half, translation in the posterior half is completely blocked. Therefore, although $Ngn$ mRNA may be transcribed in the posterior half, it does not yield Ngn protein there.\n\n- In the anterior half, miR-12 is absent. Thus, $Ngn$ mRNA that is transcribed (due to ActY being present) can be translated, yielding Ngn protein in the anterior half.\n\n- Because Ngn protein is required for neural development, neural tissues will form only where Ngn protein is present. Therefore, neural tissues will form only in the anterior half of the embryo.\n\n- The alternatives are excluded as follows: posterior-only (A) is incorrect because translation is blocked there; throughout (B) is incorrect due to posterior repression by miR-12; none (D) is incorrect because the anterior has no miR-12 and ActY permits transcription and translation; boundary-only (E) is not supported because miR-12 is confined to the posterior half, so the entire anterior half lacks repression and permits Ngn protein production.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1689905"}]}
