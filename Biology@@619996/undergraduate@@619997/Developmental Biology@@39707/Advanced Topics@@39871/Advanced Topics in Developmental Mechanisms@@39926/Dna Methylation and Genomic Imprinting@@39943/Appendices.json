They hypothesize that *IPN* is subject to genomic imprinting. To test this, they use bisulfite sequencing to quantify the methylation status of a specific CpG island within the promoter region of the *IPN* gene.\n\nThe team provides you with the following definitions and data:\n- A Differentially Methylated Region (DMR) is a genomic region that shows different methylation patterns between the paternal and maternal alleles.\n- A germline DMR (gDMR) is a region where this differential methylation is established in the gametes (sperm or oocytes) and is robustly maintained after fertilization, escaping the global wave of demethylation that occurs in the preimplantation embryo.\n- A somatic DMR (sDMR) is a region where differential methylation is established *de novo* during embryonic development in somatic lineages and is not inherited from the gametes.\n\nHere is the methylation data for the CpG island in the *IPN* promoter:\n- Methylation in mature oocytes: 98%\n- Methylation in mature sperm: 4%\n- Methylation in the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts derived from these gametes: 51%\n\nBased on the provided definitions and data, which of the following statements correctly classifies the *IPN* promoter region?\n\nA.

It is a germline DMR because the differential methylation established in the sperm and oocyte is maintained through early development, resulting in an intermediate methylation level in the diploid blastocyst cells.\n\nD. It is neither a gDMR nor an sDMR because a methylation level of 51% indicates a failure in the demethylation process rather than a controlled imprinting mechanism.\n\nE.

In diploid ICM cells, each cell carries one maternal allele and one paternal allele. If the maternal allele remains methylated at approximately $0.98$ and the paternal allele remains unmethylated at approximately $0.04$, then the expected bulk methylation measured across both alleles is the average:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ICM,\\,expected}}=\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{oocyte}}+M_{\\mathrm{sperm}}}{2}=\\frac{0.98+0.04}{2}=0.51,\n$$\nwhich matches the observed $0.51$. This intermediate value arises from allele-specific maintenance (one methylated, one unmethylated allele), not from a novel pattern.\n\n2) Under the sDMR model, the differential methylation would be established de novo in somatic lineages and not inherited from the gametes. However, the data already demonstrate strong differential methylation in the gametes themselves ($0.98$ versus $0.04$), directly supporting a germline origin rather than a de novo somatic establishment.\n\n3) Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because $0.51$ is exactly the expected average from maintained parental marks, not a novel somatic pattern.\n- B is incorrect because gDMRs are defined by escaping erasure; they are not erased and re-established to an average. Moreover, an “average” re-establishment would imply similar methylation on both alleles, not allele-specific maintenance.\n- C is correct because the differential methylation established in gametes is maintained in early development, yielding an intermediate average in diploid ICM cells due to one methylated and one unmethylated allele.\n- D is incorrect because $0.51$ reflects controlled allele-specific maintenance (imprinting), not a failure of demethylation.\n- E is incorrect because the pattern is inherited from gametes (germline) and the blastocyst ICM is part of preimplantation development; the defining feature here is germline inheritance, not somatic de novo establishment.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is a germline DMR, as stated in C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1680977"}, {"introduction": "When imprinting goes awry, it can cause severe developmental disorders, not through changes in the DNA sequence, but through \"epimutations\"—spontaneous errors in the epigenetic pattern.

This monoallelic expression is often regulated by differential DNA methylation at specific genomic loci known as Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs). In a healthy individual, an ICR typically exhibits approximately 50% methylation, as one parental chromosome is methylated while the other is not. Deviations from this pattern, known as epimutations, can lead to severe developmental disorders.\n\nA research team is investigating the genetic basis of a novel, multi-system developmental disorder in a patient (proband). They suspect a *de novo* epimutation at an ICR. To test this, they perform Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) on the proband and both of their unaffected parents (mother and father). The team focuses their analysis on two specific genomic loci:\n\n1.  **Candidate Locus 1:** A known ICR on chromosome 7, suspected to be involved in the disorder.\n2.  **Candidate Locus 2:** A control region, the promoter of a housekeeping gene, which is expected to be constitutively unmethylated across all individuals.\n\nFor each locus in each individual, the sequencing data provides the number of methylated cytosine reads ($m$) and unmethylated cytosine reads ($u$).\n\nThe raw read counts are as follows:\n- **For Locus 1 (ICR):**\n    - Mother: $m_M = 510$, $u_M = 490$\n    - Father: $m_F = 482$, $u_F = 518$\n    - Proband: $m_P = 825$, $u_P = 175$\n- **For Locus 2 (Control Promoter):**\n    - Mother: $m_M = 5$, $u_M = 995$\n    - Father: $m_F = 8$, $u_F = 992$\n    - Proband: $m_P = 7$, $u_P = 993$\n\nTo quantify the evidence for a *de novo* epimutation, the researchers define a metric called the Proband-Parental Methylation Divergence (PPMD). The PPMD is calculated for a given locus using a chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) statistic based on the null hypothesis that the proband's methylation pattern is drawn from the same distribution as their parents.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three steps:\nA.
