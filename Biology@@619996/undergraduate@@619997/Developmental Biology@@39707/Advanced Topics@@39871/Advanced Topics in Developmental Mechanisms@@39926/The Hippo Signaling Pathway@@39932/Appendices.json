The Hippo pathway elegantly illustrates this with key negative regulators like the kinase LATS1 acting as a brake, and key positive effectors like the co-activator YAP acting as an accelerator for growth. This exercise challenges you to predict the consequences of removing either the brake or the accelerator, a foundational thought experiment for understanding the logic of this critical pathway [@problem_id:1722895].", "problem": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of organ size in animals. In its active state, it acts to suppress tissue growth. A core component of this pathway is the kinase Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase 1 (LATS1). When active, LATS1 phosphorylates a transcriptional co-activator known as Yes-associated protein (YAP). This phosphorylation causes YAP to be retained in the cytoplasm and subsequently degraded, preventing it from entering the nucleus. In the absence of LATS1-mediated phosphorylation, YAP translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to TEAD family transcription factors to promote the expression of genes that drive cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis.\n\nConsider two independent experiments conducted in mice, where a tissue-specific gene knockout is induced only in liver cells (hepatocytes) after the liver has reached its normal adult size.\n\n*   **Experiment A:** A conditional knockout of the *LATS1* gene.\n*   **Experiment B:** A conditional knockout of the *YAP* gene.\n\nAssuming the mice are observed for several weeks after the knockout is induced, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the resulting change in liver size for each experiment, relative to a normal, wild-type mouse?\n\nA.

In both Experiment A and Experiment B, liver size will remain unchanged.", "solution": "The Hippo pathway restrains organ growth when active. A core step is phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1, which causes YAP cytoplasmic retention and degradation, preventing YAP from acting in the nucleus with TEAD to drive pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene expression.\n\nFor Experiment A (conditional knockout of LATS1 in adult hepatocytes), removing LATS1 eliminates YAP phosphorylation. Without this inhibitory phosphorylation, YAP is not efficiently retained in the cytoplasm or targeted for degradation. Consequently, more YAP translocates to the nucleus, where it binds TEAD and increases transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. The net effect is increased tissue growth, so liver size increases relative to wild-type.\n\nFor Experiment B (conditional knockout of YAP in adult hepatocytes), removing YAP eliminates the key transcriptional co-activator required for TEAD-mediated expression of growth-promoting and survival genes. Even with normal upstream signaling, without YAP, the pro-growth output is diminished. This reduces hepatocyte proliferation and reduces inhibition of apoptosis, leading to a net loss of liver mass over time. The net effect is decreased tissue size, so liver size decreases relative to wild-type.\n\nTherefore, Experiment A yields increased liver size and Experiment B yields decreased liver size, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1722895"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a pathway's components is the first step; the next is seeing how they operate in a living system. This practice moves from genetic hypotheticals to the dynamic process of tissue regeneration, a context where the Hippo pathway must be precisely controlled. By predicting the phosphorylation status of YAP in a regenerating liver, you will connect the molecular state of the pathway to a vital physiological response, as measured by a common laboratory technique [@problem_id:1722929].", "problem": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a fundamental regulator of organ size and tissue homeostasis. A key component of this pathway is a kinase cascade involving the LATS kinases, which, when active, suppresses cell growth. The primary downstream target of this kinase cascade is the transcriptional co-activator known as Yes-associated protein (YAP). Phosphorylation of YAP by LATS kinases leads to its sequestration in the cytoplasm, preventing it from entering the nucleus and promoting the expression of pro-proliferative genes.\n\nA researcher is studying liver regeneration in a mouse model. One group of mice (Quiescent) is left untreated and serves as a control, representing a normal, non-proliferating liver. A second group of mice (Regenerating) undergoes a partial hepatectomy, a procedure that removes part of the liver and induces a strong proliferative response to restore the lost tissue mass. After 48 hours, liver tissue is collected from both groups and analyzed by Western blot to quantify the amount of YAP that is phosphorylated (p-YAP).\n\nBased on the described mechanism of the Hippo pathway, what is the most likely outcome when comparing the amount of p-YAP in the Regenerating liver tissue to the Quiescent liver tissue?\n\nA. The amount of p-YAP in the Regenerating liver will be significantly lower than in the Quiescent liver.\n\nB. The amount of p-YAP in the Regenerating liver will be significantly higher than in the Quiescent liver.\n\nC. The amount of p-YAP will not change between the two conditions, but the total amount of YAP protein will decrease in the Regenerating liver.\n\nD. Both p-YAP and total YAP will be completely absent in the Regenerating liver due to degradation.\n\nE. The amount of p-YAP will be identical to the total amount of YAP in the Regenerating liver.", "solution": "The Hippo signaling pathway restrains cell proliferation by activating a kinase cascade culminating in LATS kinase activity. Active LATS phosphorylates YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is sequestered in the cytoplasm and cannot enter the nucleus to co-activate transcription of pro-proliferative genes.\n\nIn a quiescent liver, tissue homeostasis is maintained; thus Hippo signaling is relatively active, leading to higher LATS activity and a higher fraction of YAP being phosphorylated. Consequently, the basal state should show relatively elevated p-YAP.\n\nPartial hepatectomy triggers liver regeneration, which requires induction of proliferation. To permit proliferation, the Hippo pathway is downregulated so that YAP can enter the nucleus and drive expression of growth-related genes. Mechanistically, this downregulation corresponds to reduced LATS activity, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of YAP and increased levels of dephosphorylated YAP that translocates to the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, when comparing Western blot signals for p-YAP between Regenerating and Quiescent liver, the Regenerating liver should exhibit a lower amount of p-YAP than the Quiescent liver.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the predicted decrease in p-YAP during regeneration.\n- B contradicts the requirement of reduced YAP phosphorylation for nuclear entry and proliferation.\n- C lacks support; regeneration typically involves increased active (dephosphorylated) YAP rather than decreased total YAP.\n- D is incompatible with the need for YAP-driven transcription during regeneration.\n- E is incorrect because only a fraction of total YAP is phosphorylated, and regeneration favors the dephosphorylated pool.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a significant decrease in p-YAP in the Regenerating liver relative to the Quiescent liver.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1722929"}, {"introduction": "A key skill for any biologist is designing experiments to place a newly discovered gene into a known signaling pathway.

A core component of this pathway is the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP). When the pathway is \"ON,\" a kinase cascade involving MST1/2 and LATS1/2 leads to the phosphorylation of YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is retained in the cytoplasm and is inactive. When the pathway is \"OFF,\" the kinase cascade is inhibited, YAP remains unphosphorylated, translocates to the nucleus, and promotes the transcription of genes that drive cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, leading to tissue growth.\n\nA research team has identified a novel oncogene they call Hyperplasia-Associated Factor (HAF). Expression of HAF in cultured epithelial cells leads to a dramatic increase in proliferation, characteristic of YAP activation. The team wants to determine the mechanism of HAF action. Two primary hypotheses are proposed:\n1.  HAF inhibits the Hippo kinase cascade at or upstream of the LATS1/2 kinases.\n2.  HAF promotes YAP activity through a mechanism that is independent of, or downstream from, the LATS1/2 kinases.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the researchers perform an experiment where they measure the ratio of phosphorylated YAP to total YAP ($R_{YAP} = \\frac{[\\text{p-YAP}]}{[\\text{t-YAP}]}$) as a direct readout of YAP inactivation. A lower ratio indicates higher YAP activity. They obtain the following data from three conditions:\n- **Control cells:** $R_{YAP, Control} = 0.85$\n- **HAF-expressing cells:** $R_{YAP, HAF} = 0.15$\n- **HAF-expressing cells that also express a LATS1-Constitutively Active (LATS1-CA) mutant:** This mutant kinase is always active and its function is not dependent on upstream signals. In this condition, the ratio is $R_{YAP, HAF+LATS1-CA} = 0.22$.\n\nTo quantify the result of their intervention, they define a \"Rescue Efficiency\" metric, $\\eta_{rescue}$, which measures how effectively the LATS1-CA mutant can restore YAP phosphorylation in the presence of HAF. The metric is defined as:\n$$\n\\eta_{rescue} = \\frac{R_{YAP, HAF+LATS1-CA} - R_{YAP, HAF}}{R_{YAP, Control} - R_{YAP, HAF}}\n$$\nBased on the provided data, calculate the value of the Rescue Efficiency, $\\eta_{rescue}$.
