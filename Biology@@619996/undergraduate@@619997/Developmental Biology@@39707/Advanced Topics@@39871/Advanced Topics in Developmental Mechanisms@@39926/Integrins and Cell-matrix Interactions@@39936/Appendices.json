By considering the outcome of introducing a soluble RGD peptide, you will develop a deeper understanding of receptor-ligand binding dynamics and their direct impact on cell attachment [@problem_id:1695865].", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying the attachment of fibroblast cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). The experimental setup consists of a plastic culture dish coated with the protein fibronectin. Fibroblasts are known to adhere to fibronectin via cell-surface receptors called integrins, which specifically recognize and bind to a short amino acid sequence, Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD), within the fibronectin protein.\n\nAfter allowing the fibroblasts to attach firmly to the fibronectin-coated dish for several hours, the biologist adds a high concentration of a small, soluble synthetic peptide, whose sole amino acid sequence is RGD, to the culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most direct and immediate consequence of adding the soluble RGD peptide to the culture?\n\nA. The fibroblasts will detach from the surface of the dish.\n\nB. The attachment of the fibroblasts to the dish will be strengthened.\n\nC. There will be no change in the attachment of the fibroblasts.\n\nD. The fibroblasts will undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nE. The fibroblasts will begin to proliferate more rapidly.", "solution": "We identify the molecular interaction: fibroblasts adhere to fibronectin primarily via integrins that recognize the RGD motif. Let $R$ denote integrin receptors on the cell surface, $L$ denote immobilized fibronectin RGD sites on the dish, and $I$ denote the added soluble RGD peptide. The integrin-ligand binding follows mass-action equilibria with dissociation constants\n$$\nK_{dL} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}, \\quad K_{dI} = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]}.\n$$\n\nWhen a high concentration $[I]$ of soluble RGD is added, $I$ competes with $L$ for the same binding site on $R$ (competitive inhibition). The fractional occupancy of receptors by the surface ligand $L$ in the presence of competitor $I$ is given by the standard competitive binding expression\n$$\n\\theta_{L} = \\frac{[L]/K_{dL}}{1 + [L]/K_{dL} + [I]/K_{dI}}.\n$$\nBecause $[I]$ is added at high concentration, the term $[I]/K_{dI}$ dominates the denominator, so\n$$\n\\theta_{L} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as} \\quad [I] \\to \\text{large},\n$$\nwhich means most integrins become occupied by soluble RGD ($RI$) rather than bound to the surface ligand ($RL$). This directly reduces integrin-fibronectin bonds that mediate adhesion.\n\nAs integrin-surface bonds dissociate and are not replaced by new $RL$ complexes due to competition by $I$, focal adhesion complexes disassemble and cell-substrate traction is lost. The most direct and immediate cellular consequence is weakening of adhesion leading to cell detachment from the dish.\n\nAlternative options are less immediate or incorrect: strengthened attachment is contradicted by competitive displacement; no change is unlikely under high $[I]$ since $\\theta_{L}$ decreases; apoptosis (anoikis) can occur secondarily after detachment but is not the most immediate effect; proliferation changes are not a direct immediate consequence of acute integrin blockade by soluble RGD.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate outcome is detachment of fibroblasts from the surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1695865"}, {"introduction": "Focal adhesions are more than simple molecular anchors; they are complex, dynamic hubs that link the extracellular world to the cell's internal architecture. This exercise investigates the critical relationship between integrin-mediated adhesions and the intracellular actin cytoskeleton [@problem_id:1695793]. Understanding what happens when this internal framework is disrupted reveals why cell adhesion is an active, mechanically-dependent process.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying how fibroblasts adhere to a fibronectin-coated surface. These cells form robust structures known as focal adhesions, which are large, dynamic protein complexes that mechanically link the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. The key transmembrane proteins that mediate this connection are called integrins. The stability and maturation of these focal adhesions are known to be dependent on mechanical forces generated by the cell.\n\nThe biologist treats a culture of these fibroblasts with cytochalasin D, a potent mycotoxin that specifically binds to the barbed, fast-growing end of actin filaments, thereby preventing their polymerization and leading to the eventual depolymerization of the entire actin cytoskeleton. Assuming the drug quickly and effectively disrupts the actin network, what is the most likely immediate consequence for the pre-existing, mature focal adhesions in these cells?\n\nA. The focal adhesions will enlarge and strengthen to compensate for the cytoskeletal instability.\n\nB. The focal adhesions will remain structurally unchanged, as their connection to the extracellular matrix is independent of the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nC. The focal adhesions will disassemble and disappear.\n\nD. The cell will rapidly synthesize new proteins to repair the focal adhesions independently of the actin network.\n\nE. The integrin proteins will be endocytosed, but the rest of the focal adhesion protein complex will remain attached to the cell membrane.", "solution": "Focal adhesions are mechanosensitive integrin-based complexes that require coupling to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and sustained actomyosin-generated tension for their stability and maturation. Integrins connect extracellular matrix ligands to intracellular adaptor proteins (such as talin, vinculin, paxillin) that bind F-actin; the application of intracellular contractile force promotes integrin clustering, conformational activation, and recruitment of additional adhesion proteins, stabilizing mature focal adhesions. Thus, both the structural linkage to F-actin and the mechanical tension transmitted through that linkage are necessary to maintain mature adhesions.\n\nCytochalasin D binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments, blocking further polymerization and promoting net depolymerization of F-actin. The rapid loss of filamentous actin disrupts stress fibers and eliminates the mechanical tension they exert on focal adhesions, and it also removes the physical scaffold to which focal adhesion proteins anchor. In the absence of both the actin linkage and force, adhesion proteins such as talin and vinculin dissociate, integrin activation and clustering decrease, and the mature focal adhesions break down.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence of effective cytochalasin D treatment is the disassembly and disappearance of pre-existing mature focal adhesions, not their strengthening, persistence, or repair independent of actin. While integrins can undergo endocytosis during turnover, the focal adhesion complex does not remain attached at the membrane independently once the actin linkage is lost.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1695793"}, {"introduction": "The ability of cells to migrate is essential for development, wound healing, and immune responses, but it presents a paradox: how can a cell move forward if it is firmly anchored to its substrate? This practice explores the delicate balance between adhesion and detachment required for efficient cell migration [@problem_id:1695846]. By examining a scenario where integrin adhesion is locked in a \"strong\" state, you will uncover why the dynamic regulation of integrin affinity is crucial for motility.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, researchers are investigating the role of integrin dynamics in cell motility. They are working with a line of fibroblasts that normally migrate on surfaces coated with an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein called fibronectin. These fibroblasts express $\\alpha_5\\beta_1$ integrins, which mediate adhesion to fibronectin by switching between a low-affinity (inactive) state and a high-affinity (active) state.\n\nTo study the importance of this switch, the researchers genetically engineer the fibroblasts to express a mutated form of the $\\alpha_5\\beta_1$ integrin. This mutation forces the integrin to be permanently locked in its high-affinity conformation, causing it to bind very strongly and persistently to fibronectin.\n\nBoth the original, wild-type fibroblasts and the engineered, mutant fibroblasts are plated on identical culture dishes coated with fibronectin. Their behavior is then monitored.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most direct and predictable consequence of this mutation for the engineered cells when compared to the wild-type cells?\n\nA. The engineered cells will migrate significantly faster across the surface because their enhanced adhesion provides superior traction for movement.\n\nB. The engineered cells will be unable to spread out on the surface and will form large, multi-cellular aggregates that detach from the fibronectin coating.\n\nC. The engineered cells will adhere tightly and spread on the fibronectin, but their ability to migrate will be severely inhibited.\n\nD. The engineered cells will lose their internal cytoskeletal structure, specifically actin stress fibers, due to a negative feedback mechanism caused by constant adhesion signaling.\n\nE. The engineered cells will migrate at a normal rate but will be unable to respond to directional cues, resulting in random, non-persistent movement.", "solution": "Cell migration on an extracellular matrix requires a cyclical balance between adhesion formation at the leading edge and adhesion disassembly at the trailing edge. Integrins such as $\\alpha_{5}\\beta_{1}$ switch between low- and high-affinity states to permit this cycle. The effective migration speed $v$ depends biphasically on adhesion strength $A$, with $v=v(A)$ maximal at an intermediate $A=A^{*}$ and reduced when $A$ is too low (insufficient traction) or too high (excessive attachment inhibiting detachment).\n\nLocking $\\alpha_{5}\\beta_{1}$ in a high-affinity conformation increases adhesion strength and adhesion lifetime, promoting focal adhesion maturation and strong, stable binding to fibronectin. This increases cell spreading and traction but impairs adhesion turnover, particularly detachment at the rear, thereby reducing net translocation. Symbolically, if the mutation raises $A$ to $A>A^{*}$, then $v(A)$ decreases relative to wild type:\n$$A_{\\text{mut}} > A^{*} \\implies v_{\\text{mut}} < v_{\\text{WT}}.$$\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because while traction increases, excessive adhesion impedes detachment, reducing migration speed due to the biphasic $v(A)$ relationship.\n- B is incorrect because high-affinity integrins promote adhesion to the substrate and spreading; detachment from fibronectin and aggregate formation are not expected.\n- C is correct: engineered cells will adhere tightly and spread on fibronectin, but motility will be severely inhibited due to reduced adhesion turnover.\n- D is incorrect because sustained integrin signaling typically enhances, not abolishes, actin stress fibers via RhoA-ROCK signaling.\n- E is incorrect because the principal effect is reduced migration speed, not specifically a loss of directional sensing with normal speed.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and predictable consequence is tight adhesion and spreading with severely inhibited migration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1695846"}]}
