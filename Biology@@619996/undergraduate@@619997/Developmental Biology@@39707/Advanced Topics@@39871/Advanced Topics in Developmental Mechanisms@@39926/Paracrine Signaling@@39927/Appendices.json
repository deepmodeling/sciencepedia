This exercise [@problem_id:1706576] presents a classic scenario where a specific developmental defect, a 'ventralized' embryo, must be traced to the failure of a specific paracrine signaling event. By analyzing the receptor involved, you will practice connecting the key players of a major signaling family to its well-established role in establishing the primary body axes.", "problem": "In a developmental biology experiment, researchers introduce an inactivating mutation into the gene encoding the Frizzled protein in an amphibian embryo. Frizzled is a well-characterized seven-transmembrane domain receptor. They observe that the resulting embryos fail to form dorsal structures, such as the notochord and neural tube, leading to a phenotype often described as 'ventralized'. This experimental outcome indicates a disruption in a critical paracrine signaling pathway required for establishing the dorsal-ventral body axis. Which of the following signaling pathways is most likely disrupted by the inactivation of the Frizzled receptor?\n\nA. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway\n\nB. Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-$\\beta$) superfamily signaling pathway\n\nC. Wnt signaling pathway\n\nD. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling pathway\n\nE. Notch signaling pathway", "solution": "The problem states that Frizzled is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor and that its inactivation causes a ventralized phenotype with loss of dorsal structures (e.g., notochord, neural tube) in an amphibian embryo. The key steps to identify the disrupted pathway are:\n\n1. Identify the ligand-receptor pairing for Frizzled. Frizzled proteins are the canonical receptors for Wnt ligands. In the Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binds Frizzled along with co-receptors such as LRP5/6, leading to stabilization and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in the canonical pathway.\n\n2. Connect pathway function to embryonic dorsal-ventral axis. In amphibians (e.g., Xenopus), canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling on the future dorsal side is essential for organizer formation and specification of dorsal structures. Loss of Wnt signaling leads to failure of dorsal organizer induction and a ventralized phenotype. Therefore, inactivation of Frizzled would disrupt Wnt signaling and produce the observed phenotype.\n\n3. Exclude alternative pathways based on receptor type and developmental roles:\n- Hedgehog signaling uses Patched and Smoothened, not Frizzled, as receptors.\n- Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-$\\beta$) superfamily (including BMPs, Nodal) signals through serine/threonine kinase receptors, not Frizzled; while BMP signaling promotes ventral fates, the receptor type in the prompt is mismatched.\n- Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathways use single-pass transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g., FGF, EGF), not seven-transmembrane Frizzled receptors.\n- Notch signaling uses a single-pass transmembrane receptor with juxtacrine ligands (Delta/Jagged), not a seven-transmembrane receptor.\n\nBecause Frizzled specifically mediates Wnt signaling and Wnt is critical for dorsal axis formation, the most likely disrupted pathway is the Wnt signaling pathway.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1706576"}, {"introduction": "Genetic engineering provides powerful tools to dissect signaling pathways, often in ways that reveal a deeper mechanistic understanding than simple knockout mutations. This problem [@problem_id:1706591] explores the concept of a 'dominant-negative' mutation, a sophisticated tool for inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways like the FGF pathway. To solve this, you must think critically about the process of receptor dimerization and activation, and predict the organismal consequences when this process is sabotaged by a non-functional partner.", "problem": "In many developmental processes, tissues are patterned by signaling molecules called morphogens. One crucial family of such molecules is the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family. In a simplified model of vertebrate limb development, a specific FGF is secreted from a specialized group of cells and diffuses into an adjacent field of precursor cells. These precursor cells have FGF receptors on their surface. The binding of FGF to its receptor is necessary to stimulate the proliferation of these precursor cells, leading to the outgrowth of the limb.\n\nA team of developmental biologists has engineered a line of precursor cells that express a modified, non-functional FGF receptor alongside the normal, wild-type FGF receptor. This modified receptor has a normal extracellular domain that can bind to the FGF ligand with the same affinity as the wild-type receptor. However, its intracellular domain has been mutated so that it completely lacks kinase activity and cannot initiate any downstream signal. It has also been observed that these modified receptors can form dimers with wild-type receptors upon ligand binding.\n\nIf these engineered precursor cells are used to constitute the limb bud mesenchyme in an experimental embryo, what is the most likely outcome for limb development, assuming the FGF signal is the primary driver of cell proliferation?\n\nA. The limb will grow significantly larger and faster than normal because the modified receptors enhance the signaling capacity of the wild-type receptors.\n\nB. Limb development will proceed normally, as the wild-type receptors are still present and can function independently to mediate the FGF signal.\n\nC. The limb bud will fail to grow out, or its growth will be severely stunted, because the FGF signaling pathway is effectively blocked.\n\nD. The precursor cells will immediately change their developmental fate and differentiate into cartilage, bypassing the proliferation stage entirely.", "solution": "FGF receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases. The core activation mechanism is:\n- Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization.\n- The juxtaposed intracellular kinase domains perform trans-autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues.\n- These phosphotyrosines create docking sites for adaptor proteins, initiating downstream pathways (for example, the MAPK cascade) that drive cell proliferation.\n\nConsider the engineered context:\n- The modified receptor has normal ligand-binding affinity and dimerizes with wild-type receptors upon ligand binding.\n- Its kinase domain is inactive; it cannot phosphorylate itself or its partner.\n- In a cell coexpressing wild-type and kinase-dead receptors, ligand-induced dimers can be wild-type/wild-type, wild-type/mutant, or mutant/mutant.\n\nFunctional consequences:\n- Mutant/mutant dimers are completely nonfunctional, as neither protomer can phosphorylate.\n- Wild-type/mutant heterodimers are effectively nonfunctional or severely compromised. Trans-autophosphorylation typically requires reciprocal kinase activity to fully activate both activation loops and to generate phosphorylation sites on both cytoplasmic tails. With one kinase dead, the heterodimer cannot complete the necessary reciprocal phosphorylation, leaving critical sites unphosphorylated and preventing effective recruitment of downstream effectors. This is the classic dominant-negative effect for many receptor tyrosine kinases.\n- Because the mutant receptor binds ligand and sequesters wild-type receptors into heterodimers, the fraction of productive wild-type/wild-type dimers is greatly reduced. When expression of the mutant is comparable to wild-type, most ligand-bound complexes will be nonfunctional, causing a substantial drop in signaling output.\n\nPhysiological outcome when FGF is the primary driver of proliferation:\n- The dominant-negative blockade of FGF signaling diminishes or abolishes the proliferative signal in limb bud mesenchyme.\n- Therefore, limb outgrowth will fail or be severely stunted rather than enhanced or normal.\n- Immediate fate conversion to cartilage is not the expected direct consequence of acutely blocking FGF-driven proliferation in this context.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is severe impairment of limb outgrowth due to effective blockade of FGF signaling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1706591"}, {"introduction": "Not all signaling pathways follow a simple on/off switch where a ligand binding directly activates a receptor. This thought-provoking problem [@problem_id:1706523] presents a paradoxical result from a mutation in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, forcing you to move beyond simplistic models. By reasoning through this pathway's unique 'inhibition of an inhibitor' regulatory scheme, you will develop a more nuanced understanding of signal transduction and enhance your skills in interpreting counterintuitive experimental data.", "problem": "In developmental biology, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is crucial for orchestrating cell fate and tissue patterning. The core of this pathway involves two key transmembrane proteins located in the primary cilium: Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo). The regulatory logic is as follows:\n\n1.  In the absence of the secreted Hh ligand, the Ptc receptor actively inhibits the activity of the Smo protein. This maintains the pathway in an \"OFF\" state.\n2.  When the Hh ligand binds to Ptc, it inhibits Ptc's activity. This relieves the Ptc-mediated inhibition of Smo, allowing Smo to become active and initiate a downstream signaling cascade, turning the pathway \"ON\".\n\nA researcher performing a genetic screen discovers a novel point mutation in the gene encoding the Ptc receptor. Functional assays reveal that this mutation completely prevents the Ptc protein from binding the Hh ligand. However, cells expressing this mutant Ptc exhibit maximal and continuous activation of the downstream signaling pathway, even when no Hh ligand is present in the culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following statements provide a plausible molecular explanation for this paradoxical observation? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The mutation is a gain-of-function mutation that causes the Ptc protein to actively stimulate Smo, a reversal of its normal function.\n\nB. The mutation causes the Ptc protein to misfold, rendering it unable to carry out its primary function of inhibiting Smo.\n\nC. The mutation causes the Ptc protein to bind permanently to the Hh ligand, trapping it in a complex that cannot inhibit Smo.\n\nD. The mutation disrupts a signal sequence required for the Ptc protein's transport to the primary cilium, preventing it from reaching Smo to perform its inhibitory role.\n\nE. The mutation results in an unstable Ptc protein that is rapidly targeted for proteasomal degradation, effectively removing it from the cell.\n\nF. The mutant Ptc protein has gained the ability to bind and sequester a different, unknown inhibitory protein that normally helps keep Smo inactive.", "solution": "We begin from the canonical regulatory logic of Hedgehog signaling in vertebrate cells: in the absence of Hedgehog (Hh), Patched (Ptc) inhibits Smoothened (Smo), keeping the pathway OFF. When Hh binds Ptc, Ptc’s inhibitory activity is relieved, Smo becomes active, and the pathway turns ON.\n\nThe observed mutant Ptc cannot bind Hh, yet the pathway is constitutively ON without Hh. If the only defect were the inability to bind Hh, then Ptc would be expected to continue inhibiting Smo and the pathway should remain OFF. Therefore, the constitutive ON state implies that, in addition to (or instead of) losing Hh-binding, Ptc no longer performs its inhibitory role on Smo in the cell context. This can be achieved by loss of function due to misfolding, mislocalization, or degradation, any of which would effectively remove Ptc’s inhibitory activity. Alternatively, a highly speculative gain-of-function that removes inhibition by another mechanism could, in principle, activate Smo; however, such mechanisms must be evaluated for plausibility and consistency with the stated assay that Ptc cannot bind Hh.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Gain-of-function causing Ptc to actively stimulate Smo. This posits a neomorphic reversal of Ptc’s function. Mechanistically, Ptc normally acts as a transporter-like inhibitor of Smo activity by regulating sterol distribution; a point mutation converting Ptc into an active stimulator of Smo is highly implausible and is not required to explain the data. The observation of lost Hh binding does not support this specific new stimulatory activity. This is not a plausible, parsimonious explanation.\n\nB. Misfolding renders Ptc unable to inhibit Smo. This directly abolishes Ptc’s inhibitory function, leaving Smo uninhibited and thus constitutively active without Hh. This is a plausible and standard loss-of-function mechanism consistent with constitutive pathway activation despite absent Hh binding.\n\nC. Permanent binding to Hh that cannot inhibit Smo. This directly contradicts the assay result that the mutant Ptc cannot bind Hh at all. Therefore, this explanation is not plausible.\n\nD. Disruption of the ciliary targeting sequence prevents Ptc from reaching the primary cilium. Ptc must localize to the primary cilium to inhibit Smo; failure to localize prevents inhibition, allowing Smo to be active constitutively. This is a plausible loss-of-function mechanism consistent with the observation.\n\nE. Instability and proteasomal degradation of Ptc. Rapid degradation effectively removes Ptc from the cell, functionally equivalent to a Ptc null, which is known to cause constitutive Smo activation independent of Hh. This is a plausible explanation.\n\nF. Gain-of-function sequestration of a different inhibitory protein of Smo. This would relieve inhibition of Smo if such an inhibitor exists and is required, but this proposal is speculative and not part of the canonical mechanism by which Ptc controls Smo. Moreover, no evidence is provided for an auxiliary inhibitor that Ptc could sequester, and invoking a novel interaction is unnecessary to explain the phenotype. Relative to straightforward loss-of-function explanations, this is not a plausible, evidence-based explanation.\n\nTherefore, the plausible explanations are loss-of-function mechanisms that abolish Ptc’s inhibitory effect on Smo: B, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "1706523"}]}
