This process often begins with localized changes in cell shape, such as apical constriction. This first practice explores how the geometric arrangement of these constricting cells—whether in a line or a circle—directly dictates the initial large-scale shape of the tissue, leading to either a groove or a pit, respectively. Mastering this fundamental concept is the first step toward understanding more complex morphogenetic events [@problem_id:1730626].", "problem": "Imagine a simplified biological system consisting of a large, flat, two-dimensional sheet of epithelial cells. These cells are tightly connected to their neighbors, forming a continuous, flexible layer. Within these cells, a process called apical constriction can be triggered. Apical constriction involves the contraction of the top (apical) surface of a cell, forcing it to change shape from a cuboid or columnar form into a wedge, with the narrow end at the top surface. The bottom (basal) side of the cell layer remains unchanged in width.\n\nNow, consider two distinct experiments performed on identical epithelial sheets:\n\n**Experiment 1:** Apical constriction is simultaneously initiated in all cells lying along a single, straight line that extends across the sheet.\n\n**Experiment 2:** Apical constriction is simultaneously initiated in all cells located within a small, circular patch at the center of the sheet.\n\nAssuming the sheet is free to bend out of its initial plane and that the connections between cells are strong enough to prevent tearing, which of the following options best describes the primary, large-scale morphological change observed in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, respectively?\n\nA. Experiment 1 forms a long, linear groove or furrow; Experiment 2 forms a small, cup-shaped pit or invagination.\n\nB. Experiment 1 forms a small, cup-shaped pit or invagination; Experiment 2 forms a long, linear groove or furrow.\n\nC. Experiment 1 causes the sheet to roll up into a complete tube; Experiment 2 causes the formation of a dome-shaped outpocketing (evagination).\n\nD. Experiment 1 results in random, disorganized wrinkling along the line; Experiment 2 results in the sheet forming a saddle shape.\n\nE. Experiment 1 causes the sheet to fold back on itself to form a sharp crease; Experiment 2 causes the constricting patch of cells to detach from the sheet.", "solution": "We model the epithelial sheet as a thin elastic plate or shell of uniform thickness $h$ with apical and basal faces mechanically coupled so that in-plane strains that differ through the thickness produce bending. Apical constriction imposes an active in-plane contractile strain on the apical surface while the basal surface is constrained to maintain its original width, producing a through-thickness strain gradient.\n\nLet the apical face in the constricting region undergo an areal (isotropic in-plane) contractile strain of magnitude $\\Delta \\epsilon>0$ relative to the basal face, which we take as the reference. Classical plate/shell mechanics dictates that a through-thickness strain mismatch induces a spontaneous curvature toward the contracting side. Denoting the principal curvatures by $\\kappa_{1}$ and $\\kappa_{2}$, the induced curvature magnitude scales as\n$$\n\\kappa_{0} \\propto \\frac{\\Delta \\epsilon}{h},\n$$\nwith the proportionality factor set by the elastic moduli and Poisson ratio. The sign of curvature points toward the apical side because the apical surface is shorter than the basal surface. Thus, regions of apical constriction generate an inward bending (invagination) toward the apical side.\n\nThe geometry of the constricting region determines the symmetry and therefore the large-scale shape:\n1) Experiment 1: Apical constriction along a single straight line across the sheet imposes translational symmetry along that line and localizes the strain mismatch within a narrow band. The curvature is therefore concentrated in the cross-section perpendicular to the line, with one principal curvature nonzero across the band and the other (along the line) approximately zero. This produces a trough-like deformation: a long, linear furrow or groove directed toward the apical side. Mathematically, if $\\kappa_{\\perp}\\approx \\kappa_{0}$ across the band and $\\kappa_{\\parallel}\\approx 0$ along the line, the mean curvature $H=(\\kappa_{\\perp}+\\kappa_{\\parallel})/2$ is nonzero only in the transverse direction, generating a groove rather than a pit or tube. Rolling into a closed tube would require additional forces bringing the edges together; the primary, immediate outcome is a furrow.\n\n2) Experiment 2: Apical constriction within a small circular patch imposes rotational symmetry about the patch center. The induced curvature is approximately equal in all in-plane directions within the patch, so $\\kappa_{1}\\approx \\kappa_{2}\\approx \\kappa_{0}>0$ (toward the apical side), producing an axisymmetric invagination. The resulting shape is a cup-shaped pit centered on the constricting patch. Formation of a dome-shaped evagination would require expansion rather than contraction at the apical side, which is opposite to apical constriction.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- Reversing the outcomes (option B) contradicts the symmetry arguments above.\n- Complete tube formation (option C) requires additional morphogenetic movements and closure; the primary response is a furrow for the line and a pit for the patch.\n- Random wrinkling (option D) is unlikely because the imposed strain is uniform along the activating region and cell connections prevent buckling disorder; the symmetry enforces ordered bending.\n- Detachment or sharp crease (option E) contradicts the assumption of strong intercellular adhesion preventing tearing and the finite bending stiffness that smooths curvature.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that the line of constriction produces a long, linear groove (furrow), and the circular patch produces a cup-shaped pit (invagination).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1730626"}, {"introduction": "Beyond localized cell constriction, differential growth, where one part of a tissue grows faster than its surroundings, is another powerful engine for creating folds. This process, however, is not random; it involves a physical trade-off between the energy required to bend the tissue and the energy required to stretch it. This exercise provides a quantitative model to explore this balance, allowing you to calculate the characteristic wavelength of the resulting ruffles by finding the configuration that minimizes the total energy of the system [@problem_id:1730607].", "problem": "In developmental biology, the complex folded shapes of tissues, such as the brain or the lining of the gut, can arise from simple rules of differential growth. Consider a simplified model of this process: a flat, circular epithelial tissue is cultured in a laboratory. The central part of the tissue, a disk of radius $R_0$, is prevented from growing. However, a growth factor is applied to a thin annular region at the edge, causing it to proliferate.\n\nThis differential growth induces compressive stress, forcing the growing edge to buckle out of the plane into a series of ruffles to accommodate the extra length.
