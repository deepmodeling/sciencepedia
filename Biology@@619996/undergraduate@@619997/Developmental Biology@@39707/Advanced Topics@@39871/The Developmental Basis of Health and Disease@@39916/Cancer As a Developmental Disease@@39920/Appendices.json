This balance is often lost in cancer, leading to uncontrolled proliferation. This exercise models the dramatic difference in growth potential between a normal tissue stem cell undergoing asymmetric division and a cancer stem cell that has switched to symmetric division, a key tenet of the Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) theory. By calculating the resulting cell populations, you will gain a concrete understanding of how this single change at the cellular level can drive explosive tumor growth [@problem_id:1674407].", "problem": "In normal tissue homeostasis, a tissue stem cell typically undergoes asymmetric division to maintain the stem cell pool while also producing cells destined for differentiation. In contrast, a key characteristic of many cancers is the dysregulation of this process in Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs).\n\nConsider two simplified models of cell population expansion over a period spanning 15 cell division cycles, both starting from a single initial cell.\n\n**Model A (Healthy Tissue):** A single tissue stem cell undergoes 15 cycles. In each cycle, it divides asymmetrically to produce one new stem cell (renewing itself) and one transit-amplifying cell. Each transit-amplifying cell subsequently undergoes its own fixed program of exactly 3 divisions, ultimately producing a small clone of terminally differentiated cells before it stops dividing. Assume we are measuring the total number of cells after all 15 transit-amplifying cell cohorts have completed their full division programs.\n\n**Model B (Tumor Growth):** A single CSC undergoes 15 cycles. Due to a mutation, it exclusively undergoes symmetric division, where each division produces two new CSCs identical to the parent.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total number of cells in Model B to the total number of cells in Model A.

In developing epithelia, the orientation of the mitotic spindle is a critical mechanism for controlling whether a division is symmetric or asymmetric, thus determining cell fate. This practice examines how a subtle, persistent bias in spindle orientation can disrupt the delicate balance between progenitor self-renewal and differentiation, leading to hyperplasia, an early stage of cancer. You will calculate the population doubling time to quantify the rate of this uncontrolled expansion, linking a specific subcellular event to a tissue-level pathology [@problem_id:1674379].", "problem": "In a simplified model of a healthy stratified epithelium, a basal layer of progenitor cells maintains tissue homeostasis. Progenitor cells divide at an average rate of $R$. Each division can have one of three outcomes depending on the orientation of the mitotic spindle and subsequent signaling. A spindle oriented perpendicular to the basal lamina leads to an asymmetric division, producing one progenitor and one differentiating cell. A spindle oriented parallel to the basal lamina leads to a symmetric division. Symmetric divisions can be either proliferative, producing two progenitors, or differentiative, producing two differentiating cells.\n\nIn a healthy, stable tissue, the proportion of divisions that are symmetric is $\\alpha_{H} = 0.24$, and these are perfectly balanced, with half being proliferative and half being differentiative. The average division rate for a progenitor cell is $R = 0.40$ divisions per day.\n\nA mutation occurs in a gene controlling spindle orientation. This mutation increases the proportion of symmetric divisions to $\\alpha_{M} = 0.55$. Concurrently, the mutation disrupts a signaling pathway, causing a bias in the outcome of these symmetric divisions: now, a fraction $\\beta = 0.75$ of all symmetric divisions are proliferative, with the remainder being differentiative. This imbalance leads to the uncontrolled expansion of the progenitor cell layer, a hallmark of early-stage hyperplasia.\n\nAssuming the progenitor population grows exponentially following the onset of these changes, calculate the doubling time of the progenitor cell population. Express your answer in days, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $n(t)$ be the progenitor population. Each progenitor divides at rate $R$, and each division changes the progenitor count by an amount that depends on the division type.
