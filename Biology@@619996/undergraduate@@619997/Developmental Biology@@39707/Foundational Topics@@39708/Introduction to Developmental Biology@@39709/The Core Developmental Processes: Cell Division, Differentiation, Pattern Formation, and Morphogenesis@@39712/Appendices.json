The morphogen then diffuses into the tissue and is simultaneously degraded everywhere with a constant first-order rate constant, $k$.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of the morphogen, $C(x)$, at a distance $x$ from the source is described by the equation:\n$$ C(x) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the morphogen.\n\nThe expression of a particular gene, Gene X, is activated in cells where the morphogen concentration exceeds a specific threshold, $C_{\\text{th}}$.

A signaling molecule, the morphogen $M$, is continuously produced by a localized source at position $x=0$. The morphogen diffuses along the line for $x \\geq 0$ and degrades. At steady state, the concentration profile of the morphogen is described by the equation:\n$$M(x) = \\frac{P_M \\lambda}{D_M} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $P_M$ is the production rate of the morphogen at the source, $D_M$ is its diffusion coefficient, and $\\lambda$ is its characteristic decay length.\n\nCells along the line differentiate into a specialized cell type, let's call it type D, wherever the local morphogen concentration $M(x)$ exceeds a critical threshold $K_M$.
