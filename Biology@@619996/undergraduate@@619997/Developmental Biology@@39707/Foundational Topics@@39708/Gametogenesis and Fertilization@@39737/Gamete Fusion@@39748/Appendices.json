A key molecular player in this process is the oocyte membrane receptor Juno, which is essential for sperm binding.

This critical event can be modeled using principles from biophysics, specifically the Canham-Helfrich theory for lipid bilayers. Consider a simplified model for the formation of a stable, open fusion pore connecting the sperm's inner acrosomal membrane and the oocyte's microvillar membrane.\n\nInitially, the two planar membranes are parallel. The formation of the pore is modeled as a transition to a final state consisting of a single, continuous membrane structure.
