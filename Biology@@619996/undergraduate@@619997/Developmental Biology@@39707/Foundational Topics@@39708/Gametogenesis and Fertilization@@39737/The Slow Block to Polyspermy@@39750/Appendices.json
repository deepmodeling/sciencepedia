The \"slow block\" to polyspermy involves the cortical granule reaction, where an influx of calcium ions into the egg cytoplasm triggers the exocytosis of thousands of cortical granules located just beneath the plasma membrane. The contents of these granules are released into the space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline envelope, a glycoprotein layer surrounding the egg. These contents include proteases that sever the proteins tethering the vitelline envelope to the cell membrane, and mucopolysaccharides that are osmotically active, drawing in water to physically elevate the envelope. This entire process transforms the vitelline envelope into the hardened, impenetrable fertilization envelope.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving a sea urchin egg that possesses a specific genetic mutation. This mutation causes its cortical granules to be completely deficient in all types of peroxidase enzymes, while all other components (such as proteases, mucopolysaccharides, and hyalin) are present and fully functional. If this mutant egg is successfully fertilized by a single sperm, which of the following properties related to the formation of the fertilization envelope would be most directly and significantly compromised?\n\nA. The elevation of the envelope away from the egg's plasma membrane.\n\nB. The initial fusion of the cortical granules with the egg's plasma membrane.\n\nC.

The cleavage and removal of sperm-binding receptors from the envelope's surface.", "solution": "We identify the normal roles of cortical granule components in the sea urchin slow block to polyspermy after a rise in intracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). The $Ca^{2+}$-triggered cortical granule exocytosis releases several factors into the perivitelline space.\n\n1) Proteases: These enzymes cleave proteins that tether the vitelline envelope to the plasma membrane and also remove sperm-binding receptors from the envelope. Therefore, their primary effects correspond to envelope detachment and receptor removal, addressing options A (indirectly via detachment) and E (directly via receptor cleavage).\n\n2) Mucopolysaccharides: These are osmotically active molecules that draw water into the perivitelline space, generating the hydrostatic force that elevates the envelope into the fertilization envelope. This directly supports option A.\n\n3) Peroxidases (e.g., ovoperoxidase): These catalyze oxidative cross-linking (e.g., dityrosine and other covalent cross-links) of proteins within the vitelline envelope using oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. This enzymatic cross-linking produces the mechanical hardening and structural reinforcement characteristic of the fertilization envelope. This function directly corresponds to option C.\n\n4) Hyalin: This component forms the hyaline layer beneath the fertilization envelope, providing a substrate that supports blastomeres during early cleavage. This corresponds to option D.\n\n5) The initial fusion of cortical granules with the plasma membrane (option B) is driven by the $Ca^{2+}$-dependent exocytotic machinery and does not require peroxidase activity; it depends on membrane fusion proteins and the exocytosis process itself.\n\nGiven the mutation that specifically eliminates peroxidase enzymes while leaving proteases, mucopolysaccharides, and hyalin intact, the following consequences arise:\n\n- Envelope elevation (A) remains functional due to mucopolysaccharides.\n- Cortical granule fusion (B) remains functional because exocytosis is intact and independent of peroxidases.\n- Enzymatic hardening and reinforcement (C) is directly compromised because cross-linking catalyzed by peroxidases is absent.\n- Hyaline layer formation (D) remains functional because hyalin is present and deposited normally.\n- Receptor removal (E) remains functional due to preserved protease activity.\n\nTherefore, the property most directly and significantly compromised is the enzymatic hardening and structural reinforcement of the envelope.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1726666"}, {"introduction": "Building on the role of individual components, this exercise examines the consequence of a complete system failure. This thought experiment asks you to predict the outcome when cortical granules are functionally empty, lacking all their enzymatic cargo. This challenges you to appreciate the indispensable nature of the slow block as a whole for preventing polyspermy and ensuring the viability of the zygote.[@problem_id:1726646]", "problem": "In many animal species, the fusion of a sperm with an oocyte triggers a series of events to prevent polyspermy, the lethal condition of fertilization by more than one sperm. One crucial mechanism is the slow block to polyspermy, also known as the cortical reaction. This process involves the exocytosis of cortical granules, which are specialized vesicles located in the cortex (the region just beneath the plasma membrane) of the unfertilized oocyte. The contents of these granules modify the oocyte's extracellular matrix to create a permanent barrier to subsequent sperm.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation in a species of sea urchin. This mutation affects a key gene responsible for packaging enzymes, such as proteases and peroxidases, into the cortical granules during oogenesis. As a result, the oocytes produced by mutant females have cortical granules that are structurally present but are functionally empty, lacking their enzymatic cargo.\n\nIf an oocyte from one of these mutant females is exposed to a normal concentration of sperm, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to occur?\n\nA. The first sperm will be unable to fuse with the oocyte plasma membrane because the cortical granules are defective.\n\nB. The oocyte will undergo a normal fertilization event, forming a viable zygote and a permanent fertilization envelope.\n\nC. The oocyte will be fertilized by a single sperm, but will fail to complete meiosis and initiate cell division.\n\nD. The oocyte's plasma membrane will fail to depolarize, leading to the immediate fusion of multiple sperm simultaneously.\n\nE. The oocyte will be successfully fertilized by the first sperm, but will then be fertilized by additional sperm, leading to a polyspermic and non-viable zygote.", "solution": "The biological sequence of events at fertilization includes two mechanistically distinct blocks to polyspermy:\n1. A fast block that depends on a rapid depolarization of the oocyte plasma membrane immediately after the first sperm fuses. This block is mediated by ion fluxes across the oocyte membrane and is independent of cortical granule content.\n2. A slow block (cortical reaction) triggered by a fertilization-induced increase in cytosolic calcium that causes exocytosis of cortical granules. The released enzymes (notably proteases and peroxidases) modify the vitelline layer/extracellular matrix, including cleavage of sperm-binding receptors and oxidative crosslinking to elevate and harden the fertilization envelope, thereby creating a permanent barrier to additional sperm.\n\nIn the described mutation, cortical granules are structurally present but lack their enzymatic cargo (proteases, peroxidases). The implications follow step-by-step:\n- The initial fusion of the first sperm does not require functional cortical granule enzymes; thus, the first sperm can bind and fuse normally. Therefore, there is no basis to block the first sperm (contradicting option A).\n- The fast block depends on membrane depolarization, which is not impaired by cortical granule enzyme deficiency; thus, depolarization should occur normally (contradicting option D).\n- The slow block requires the enzymatic activities released from cortical granules. Empty granules cannot cleave sperm receptors or crosslink and elevate the vitelline layer to form a hardened fertilization envelope. Therefore, the permanent barrier to additional sperm is not established, and the fertilization envelope does not properly form (contradicting option B).\n- The completion of meiosis and initiation of development depend primarily on the calcium wave and downstream activation pathways, not specifically on the presence of cortical granule enzymes; hence there is no direct reason to predict failure of meiosis or cell cycle entry solely from the absence of these enzymes (contradicting option C).\n- With a normal initial fertilization and an intact but transient fast block, once the membrane repolarizes, additional sperm present in the environment can fuse due to the failed slow block. This leads to polyspermy, which produces a non-viable zygote due to aberrant chromosomal complements and defective early mitoses.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is successful fertilization by the first sperm followed by additional sperm entry, resulting in a polyspermic, non-viable zygote.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1726646"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem integrates cell biology with developmental mechanics to highlight the importance of spatial organization. By considering a defect in the cytoskeletal machinery that distributes cortical granules, this exercise demonstrates that the *location* of these vesicles is as crucial as their *contents*. You will explore how the non-uniform release of granular contents leads to the formation of an incomplete and ineffective barrier.[@problem_id:1726667]", "problem": "In many animal species, a critical post-fertilization process known as the slow block to polyspermy prevents the entry of multiple sperm. This is mediated by the cortical reaction, where a wave of intracellular calcium triggers the exocytosis of vesicles called cortical granules, located just beneath the oocyte's plasma membrane. The contents of these granules modify the overlying vitelline layer, causing it to lift away from the plasma membrane and harden into a protective fertilization envelope. A key protein, Actin-Associated Linker for Granule Transport (AAL-GT), is essential for anchoring cortical granules uniformly across the sub-membranous actin cortex during oogenesis.\n\nConsider a mutant oocyte from a sea urchin species that has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding AAL-GT. As a result of this cytoskeletal defect, all cortical granules fail to distribute and become clustered in a dense patch exclusively at the animal pole of the oocyte. This oocyte is then successfully fertilized by a single sperm at its vegetal pole. Assuming the calcium wave propagates normally from the point of sperm entry to the opposite pole, which of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting structure of the vitelline layer/fertilization envelope?\n\nA. A complete but structurally weak fertilization envelope forms around the entire oocyte, being significantly thinner and more fragile than in a wild-type oocyte.\n\nB. A hardened, elevated cap-like structure forms exclusively at the animal pole, while the vitelline layer over the rest of the oocyte remains unchanged and attached to the plasma membrane.\n\nC. No part of the vitelline layer lifts or hardens, as the calcium wave initiated at the vegetal pole dissipates before it can reach the distant cluster of cortical granules at the animal pole.\n\nD. A complete but asymmetrical fertilization envelope forms, which is thickest and most elevated at the animal pole and gradually becomes thinner and less elevated towards the vegetal pole.\n\nE. The entire vitelline layer lifts away from the plasma membrane uniformly, but fails to harden into a stable envelope, resulting in a swollen and fragile membrane.", "solution": "The slow block to polyspermy in sea urchins is mediated by the cortical reaction: a sperm-induced intracellular calcium wave triggers exocytosis of cortical granules that are uniformly arrayed beneath the oocyte plasma membrane in wild type. Granule contents locally modify the overlying vitelline layer by enzymatic cleavage of receptor proteins and cross-linking/hardening of its matrix, and osmotically active polysaccharides elevate it to form a continuous fertilization envelope. Uniform granule distribution is therefore required for a uniform, continuous elevation and hardening across the entire surface, because the modifications and swelling are locally supplied by granules at each cortical site.\n\nIn the mutant, all cortical granules are clustered only at the animal pole. Fertilization occurs at the vegetal pole, but the problem states that the calcium wave propagates normally from the vegetal to the animal pole. Exocytosis of cortical granules is calcium-triggered; thus, exocytosis can occur only where granules are present. Consequently:\n1) At the animal pole, where the granules are clustered, the arriving calcium wave will trigger a burst of exocytosis. The released enzymes and polysaccharides will locally modify the vitelline layer, elevating and hardening it. This will produce a raised, hardened cap-like fertilization envelope over the animal pole region.\n2) Over the remainder of the oocyte (most of the surface), there are no cortical granules to exocytose upon calcium elevation. Without local supplies of enzymes and osmolytes, the vitelline layer cannot lift or harden and remains attached to the plasma membrane.\n\nPotential alternative outcomes are inconsistent with these mechanisms: a complete but weak envelope (option A) would still require widespread granule release, which is absent; an asymmetrical but continuous envelope (option D) would require sufficient diffusion of granule contents over nearly the entire oocyte surface before envelope sealing, which is not supported by the locally acting nature and timing of cortical reactions; no envelope anywhere due to calcium dissipation (option C) contradicts the stated normal propagation; uniform lifting without hardening (option E) still requires widespread osmolyte release from granules, which is absent.\n\nTherefore, only the animal pole region forms a hardened elevated structure, while the rest remains unchanged and attached.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1726667"}]}
