{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The concept of species-specific fertilization is often described by the \"lock-and-key\" model, where proteins on the sperm surface act as a key that must fit a specific lock on the egg's surface. This exercise challenges you to think like an experimental biologist by testing this very model. By considering a scenario where the egg's 'lock'—the bindin receptor—is blocked by a specific antibody, you can practice predicting the outcome of an experiment and solidify your understanding of this critical molecular interaction [@problem_id:1715537].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the mechanisms of species-specific fertilization in the purple sea urchin, *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*. The interaction between the protein bindin, located on the sperm's acrosomal process, and a specific receptor on the egg's vitelline envelope is hypothesized to be essential for sperm-egg fusion. To test this, the biologist prepares two batches of eggs harvested from a single female *S. purpuratus*.\n\n- **Batch A (Control):** Eggs are placed in a standard solution of filtered seawater.\n- **Batch B (Experimental):** Eggs are placed in an identical solution of filtered seawater but are also pre-incubated with a high concentration of a purified monoclonal antibody. This antibody is known to bind specifically and with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the bindin receptor on the *S. purpuratus* egg, effectively blocking the site where sperm bindin would normally attach.\n\nAfter the pre-incubation period, sperm collected from a male *S. purpuratus* are added in equal concentrations to both Batch A and Batch B. The biologist then observes the samples to assess whether fertilization has occurred, which is identified by the formation of a fertilization envelope around the egg.\n\nBased on the established model of sea urchin fertilization, predict the most likely outcome of this In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) experiment.\n\nA. Fertilization occurs in both Batch A and Batch B, as the antibody is not able to penetrate the egg's jelly coat.\n\nB. Fertilization occurs in Batch A, but fails to occur in Batch B.\n\nC. Fertilization fails in both Batch A and Batch B, indicating the experimental conditions were generally unsuitable for fertilization.\n\nD. Fertilization occurs in both Batch A and Batch B, but the eggs in Batch B exhibit a high rate of polyspermy (fertilization by more than one sperm).\n\nE. Fertilization fails in Batch A, but occurs successfully in Batch B.", "solution": "The established mechanism of sea urchin fertilization proceeds through the following causal sequence: egg jelly polysaccharides induce the sperm acrosome reaction; bindin becomes exposed on the sperm acrosomal process; bindin mediates species-specific adhesion by binding to its cognate receptor on the egg’s vitelline envelope; stable adhesion enables membrane fusion; fusion triggers an intracellular calcium increase that initiates the cortical reaction, producing a fertilization envelope.\n\nGiven this, the bindin–receptor interaction is essential for the adhesion and fusion steps. Blocking the receptor’s extracellular domain with a high-affinity monoclonal antibody prevents bindin from engaging its binding site, thereby inhibiting adhesion and subsequent fusion. Without fusion, the calcium wave and cortical granule exocytosis do not occur, so a fertilization envelope does not form.\n\nApplying this to the experiment:\n- Batch A (Control): The bindin receptor is unblocked. Sperm undergo the acrosome reaction, bind via bindin to the receptor, fuse with the egg, trigger calcium release, and initiate the cortical reaction. A fertilization envelope forms, indicating successful fertilization.\n- Batch B (Experimental): The antibody occupies the extracellular bindin receptor site on the vitelline envelope, sterically and competitively blocking bindin binding. Sperm may still undergo the acrosome reaction upon encountering egg jelly, but cannot adhere productively to the vitelline envelope via bindin–receptor interaction. Consequently, membrane fusion fails, no calcium wave is triggered, no cortical reaction occurs, and no fertilization envelope forms.\n\nTherefore, fertilization occurs in Batch A but fails in Batch B. Option A is incorrect because the antibody targets an extracellular epitope on the vitelline envelope and does not need to penetrate the egg; its access is ensured by pre-incubation. Option D is inconsistent with receptor blockade, which reduces, not increases, fertilization. Options C and E contradict the known requirement for bindin–receptor interaction and the control conditions that support normal fertilization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1715537"}, {"introduction": "While the lock-and-key model provides a powerful qualitative picture, science often demands quantification: just how specific is the interaction?

A nonsynonymous substitution is a nucleotide mutation that alters the amino acid sequence of a protein, while a synonymous substitution does not. The ratio $\\omega = dN/dS$ is a measure of the selective pressure on a protein-coding gene.
