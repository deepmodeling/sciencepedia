Consider the following key events that occur within the oocyte's cytoplasm after it has been successfully penetrated by a single sperm cell:\n\n1.  Syngamy\n2.  Pronuclear migration\n3.  Completion of meiosis II by the oocyte\n4.  Formation of the paternal pronucleus\n\nWhich of the following options represents the correct chronological sequence of these four events?\n\nA. 3, 4, 2, 1\n\nB. 4, 3, 2, 1\n\nC. 2, 3, 4, 1\n\nD. 3, 2, 4, 1\n\nE. 1, 2, 3, 4", "solution": "After sperm entry, the secondary oocyte is arrested at metaphase of meiosis II. The calcium oscillations triggered by sperm penetration reactivate the oocyte cell cycle, so the first event is completion of meiosis II by the oocyte; this produces the second polar body and the haploid maternal pronucleus. Next, the sperm nucleus decondenses in the ooplasm, exchanging protamines for histones and assembling a nuclear envelope; this yields the paternal pronucleus. Once both pronuclei have formed, they migrate toward each other along microtubules organized by the sperm aster; this is pronuclear migration. Finally, the pronuclear envelopes break down and the parental genomes come together on a common mitotic spindle; this fusion of the genetic material is syngamy. Therefore, the correct chronological sequence is 3, then 4, then 2, then 1, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1688205"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the timeline of fertilization, we now add a quantitative layer to our understanding by tracking the genetic material itself. This practice asks you to calculate the total number of chromatids present in the zygote at a critical checkpoint just before the first cell division [@problem_id:1688143]. This calculation is crucial for connecting the concepts of fertilization with the mechanics of the cell cycle and the precise duplication of the genome.", "problem": "In human reproduction, fertilization involves the fusion of a sperm and an egg to form a zygote. Following fertilization, the genetic material from the sperm and the egg decondenses to form two separate nuclei within the single cell, known as the paternal pronucleus and the maternal pronucleus, respectively. Each of these pronuclei is haploid. Before the first mitotic division, or cleavage, the zygote enters the S phase of the cell cycle, during which DNA replication occurs independently within both pronuclei. The process in which the pronuclei migrate towards each other, their envelopes break down, and their chromosomes align on a single metaphase plate is called syngamy.\n\nAssuming a normal human gamete contains a haploid number of 23 chromosomes ($n=23$), calculate the total number of chromatids present within the zygote *after* DNA replication has completed in both pronuclei but *before* syngamy occurs.", "solution": "A normal human gamete is haploid with $n=23$ chromosomes. After fertilization, there are two haploid pronuclei (one paternal, one maternal), each with $n$ chromosomes. During S phase, each chromosome replicates to form two sister chromatids, so the number of chromatids per pronucleus becomes:\n$$2n.$$\nBecause there are two pronuclei within the zygote before syngamy, the total number of chromatids in the zygote is:\n$$2 \\times (2n) = 4n.$$\nSubstituting $n=23$ gives:\n$$4n = 4 \\times 23 = 92.$$\nTherefore, the zygote contains $92$ chromatids after DNA replication in both pronuclei but before syngamy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{92}$$", "id": "1688143"}, {"introduction": "True mastery of a biological process comes from understanding not only how it works, but also what happens when it goes awry. This final practice presents a hypothetical experimental scenario where a key step—DNA replication in the male pronucleus—is blocked [@problem_id:1688186]. By predicting the genetic outcome for the daughter cells, you will engage in critical thinking that deepens your grasp of mitotic principles and the safeguards ensuring proper chromosome segregation.", "problem": "In human developmental biology, the states of a cell's genome are often described by its chromosome number and DNA content. Let $n$ represent the number of chromosomes in a single set (for humans, $n=23$), and let $C$ represent the quantity of DNA in that set. Therefore, a normal haploid human gamete (sperm or egg) is designated as (1n, 1C), and a normal diploid somatic cell in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is (2n, 2C).\n\nConsider a scenario involving in-vitro fertilization. A human oocyte is fertilized by a single sperm, forming a zygote containing a paternal pronucleus and a maternal pronucleus. Immediately after formation, an experimental drug that selectively inhibits DNA replication is applied, but due to a technical error, it only affects the paternal pronucleus. Consequently, the maternal pronucleus undergoes the S-phase (synthesis phase) normally, while the paternal pronucleus is prevented from doing so. The zygote then proceeds to its first mitotic cleavage, dividing into two daughter cells called blastomeres.\n\nAssuming that the mitotic spindle forms and functions correctly to segregate the chromosomes, what are the resulting chromosome numbers and DNA contents of the two blastomeres?\n\nA. Both blastomeres are (2n, 2C).\n\nB. One blastomere is (2n, 2C) and the other is (1n, 1C).\n\nC. Both blastomeres are (1.5n, 1.5C).\n\nD. One blastomere is (1n, 2C) and the other is (1n, 1C).\n\nE. One blastomere is (2n, 3C) and the other contains no genetic material.", "solution": "Define $n$ as the number of chromosomes in a haploid set and $C$ as the DNA content of that set. Immediately after fertilization and before S-phase, the maternal pronucleus is $(1n,1C)$ and the paternal pronucleus is $(1n,1C)$.\n\nThe drug inhibits DNA replication only in the paternal pronucleus. Therefore, during S-phase:\n- Maternal pronucleus undergoes replication: replication doubles DNA content but does not change chromosome number, so it becomes $(1n,2C)$.\n- Paternal pronucleus does not replicate: it remains $(1n,1C)$.\n\nAt the first mitotic division, apply the principles of mitosis:\n- For a replicated set $(1n,2C)$, sister chromatids separate to opposite poles, producing equal contributions of $(1n,1C)$ to each daughter:\n$$\\text{maternal}: (1n,2C) \\xrightarrow{\\text{mitosis}} (1n,1C) + (1n,1C).$$\n- For an unreplicated set $(1n,1C)$, there are no sister chromatids to separate. Each chromosome has a single chromatid that can attach to one pole; under the stated assumption that the spindle forms and functions to segregate chromosomes, the paternal set cannot be split into equal halves and is delivered en bloc to one pole, yielding:\n$$\\text{paternal}: (1n,1C) \\xrightarrow{\\text{mitosis}} (1n,1C) + (0n,0C).$$\n\nSum maternal and paternal contributions per daughter cell by\n$$(n_{\\text{total}}, C_{\\text{total}}) = (n_{\\text{maternal}}+n_{\\text{paternal}},\\, C_{\\text{maternal}}+C_{\\text{paternal}}).$$\nThus:\n- One blastomere receives maternal $(1n,1C)$ plus paternal $(1n,1C)$, giving $(2n,2C)$.\n- The other blastomere receives maternal $(1n,1C)$ plus paternal $(0n,0C)$, giving $(1n,1C)$.\n\nThese outcomes correspond to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1688186"}]}
