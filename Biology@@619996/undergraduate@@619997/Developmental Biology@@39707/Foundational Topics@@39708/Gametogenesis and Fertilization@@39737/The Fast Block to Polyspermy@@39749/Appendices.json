This first practice problem[@problem_id:1721621] invites you to consider the direct genetic consequences of failure, exploring what happens at the chromosomal level when more than one sperm fertilizes an egg. By working through this thought experiment, you'll solidify your understanding of ploidy and appreciate the fundamental reason why polyspermy must be prevented.", "problem": "In developmental biology, fertilization is a critical process where a haploid sperm fuses with a haploid egg to form a diploid zygote. In many marine invertebrates like the sea urchin, mechanisms exist to prevent polyspermy, the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm. The \"fast block to polyspermy\" is a rapid electrical depolarization of the egg's plasma membrane that occurs upon fusion with the first sperm.\n\nConsider a sea urchin species where a mature ovum, having completed Meiosis I and arrested in metaphase of Meiosis II, is haploid (n) with respect to its chromosome number. A normal sperm cell is also haploid (n).\n\nAn experiment is designed to investigate the effects of polyspermy. A mature ovum is placed in a medium that disables the fast block, allowing for the simultaneous fusion and entry of two separate sperm cells. The entry of the sperm triggers the completion of Meiosis II, which involves the separation of sister chromatids and the extrusion of the second polar body.\n\nAssuming that both sperm nuclei successfully decondense and contribute their genetic material to form a single zygote nucleus, what is the resulting ploidy of this zygote nucleus?\n\nPloidy refers to the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell. A cell with one set is called haploid (n), and a cell with two sets is called diploid (2n).\n\nA. Haploid (n)\n\nB. Diploid (2n)\n\nC. Triploid (3n)\n\nD. Tetraploid (4n)\n\nE. Aneuploid (a chromosome number that is not an exact multiple of the haploid set)", "solution": "Ploidy counts complete chromosome sets. A secondary oocyte arrested in metaphase of Meiosis II is haploid with respect to chromosome sets: it contains $n$ chromosomes, each with two sister chromatids, so its ploidy is $n$ even though the DNA content is duplicated. Upon sperm entry, Meiosis II completes: sister chromatids separate and the second polar body is extruded. The female pronucleus that remains in the egg is therefore haploid, contributing $n$.\n\nIn the experiment, the fast block is disabled and two sperm, each haploid, enter and both pronuclei decondense and contribute to the same zygote nucleus. Each sperm contributes $n$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chromosome sets in the resulting zygote nucleus is the sum of one maternal haploid set and two paternal haploid sets:\n$$\nn_{\\text{zygote}} \\;=\\; n_{\\text{maternal}} \\;+\\; n_{\\text{paternal(1)}} \\;+\\; n_{\\text{paternal(2)}} \\;=\\; n + n + n \\;=\\; 3n.\n$$\nA zygote with $3n$ sets is triploid, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1721621"}, {"introduction": "Nature's strategy to prevent polyspermy is a one-two punch: a rapid but temporary electrical barrier followed by a slower, permanent mechanical one. To truly grasp how this system works, it is essential to distinguish the roles and timing of the fast and slow blocks. This exercise[@problem_id:1721581] presents a hypothetical scenario with a drug that selectively interferes with the fast block, challenging you to predict the egg's fate. By analyzing this situation, you will clarify the specific function and transient nature of the electrical block in the crucial moments after fertilization.", "problem": "In sea urchins, the prevention of polyspermy (fertilization by more than one sperm) is a critical two-step process. The first step is the \"fast block,\" a rapid, transient electrical event. Upon fusion of the first sperm, the egg's plasma membrane potential changes from a resting potential of approximately -70 millivolts (mV) to a depolarized state of about +20 mV. Sperm can only fuse with a negatively charged membrane. This is followed by the \"slow block,\" a permanent mechanical barrier formed by the cortical reaction, which is typically completed within a minute after fertilization.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where sea urchin eggs are placed in a sperm-rich solution. A single sperm successfully fertilizes an egg, triggering the normal fast block depolarization to +20 mV. Precisely 10 seconds after this initial fertilization, an experimental drug called \"Repolarin\" is added to the medium. Repolarin is a fast-acting ion channel agonist that instantly and completely restores the egg's membrane potential to its original resting state of -70 mV. The slow block has not yet been established at this time.\n\nGiven this scenario, what is the most likely fate of this egg?\n\nA. The egg will become polyspermic.\n\nB. The egg will develop normally into a larva.\n\nC. The egg will lyse (burst) due to the drug's effect on ion channels.\n\nD. The fertilization process will be reversed, and the first sperm nucleus will be ejected.\n\nE. The egg will enter a state of developmental arrest without further sperm entry.", "solution": "The key principles are that the fast block to polyspermy is a rapid membrane depolarization that prevents additional sperm fusion because sperm can only fuse with a negatively charged plasma membrane, and that the slow block, established by the cortical reaction, creates a permanent mechanical barrier but requires up to about one minute to complete.\n\nLet $V_{m}$ denote the egg plasma membrane potential. Initially, before fertilization, $V_{m}=-70 \\text{ mV}$, which is negative and permissive for sperm fusion. Upon fusion of the first sperm at time $t=0$, the fast block depolarizes the membrane to $V_{m}=+20 \\text{ mV}$. Since sperm can only fuse when the membrane is negatively charged, this depolarized state prevents any additional sperm from fusing during the fast block. The slow block (mechanical barrier) has not yet formed at this early time.\n\nAt $t=10 \\text{ s}$, Repolarin is added and is specified to instantly and completely restore $V_{m}$ to its resting value, so $V_{m}$ is returned to $-70 \\text{ mV}$. At this moment, the slow block has still not been established, so there is no mechanical barrier. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for additional sperm fusion—namely, a negative membrane potential in the absence of the slow block—is met. Because the egg is in a sperm-rich solution, the probability of additional sperm contacting and fusing with the now-negative membrane before the slow block can be established is high.\n\nThus, after Repolarin reverses the fast block while the slow block is still absent, additional sperm are likely to fuse, resulting in polyspermy. Polyspermy leads to abnormal development, but the immediate fate in this scenario is that the egg becomes polyspermic, not normal development, lysis, reversal of the initial fertilization, or developmental arrest without further sperm entry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1721581"}, {"introduction": "The depolarization of the egg membrane from a negative resting potential to a positive one seems like an abstract concept, but it is a physical process driven by the movement of ions.
