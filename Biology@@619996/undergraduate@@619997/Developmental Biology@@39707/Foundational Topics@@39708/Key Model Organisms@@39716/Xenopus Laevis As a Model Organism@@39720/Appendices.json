The researcher takes a normally fertilized embryo that has developed to the 8-cell stage. At this stage, the embryo consists of four smaller blastomeres (cells) in the pigmented animal hemisphere and four larger, yolky blastomeres in the vegetal hemisphere. A single blastomere in the animal hemisphere is microinjected with a non-toxic, heritable lineage tracer dye that will be passed on to all of its descendants. The embryo is then cultured in standard conditions and allowed to develop through gastrulation. Assuming normal development proceeds, the descendants of the labeled cell will predominantly contribute to which of the primary germ layers?\n\nA. The mesoderm, which gives rise to connective tissue, muscle, and the circulatory system.\n\nB. The endoderm, which forms the lining of the digestive tract and associated organs.\n\nC. A mixture of all three primary germ layers, as the blastomere is fully pluripotent.\n\nD. The ectoderm, which differentiates into the skin and the nervous system.\n\nE.

Therefore, its descendants will primarily populate ectodermal tissues.\n- Eliminating alternatives:\n  - Mesoderm (A) arises mainly from marginal zone cells, not from purely animal hemisphere blastomeres.\n  - Endoderm (B) arises from vegetal hemisphere blastomeres.\n  - A mixture of all three layers (C) is inconsistent with the established fate restriction at this stage in Xenopus; although the embryo is regulative, animal blastomeres are biased to ectoderm under normal conditions.\n  - Primordial germ cells (E) in Xenopus are associated with localized germ plasm in vegetal regions, not the animal hemisphere.\n- Therefore, the labeled animal hemisphere blastomere will predominantly contribute to ectoderm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1732523"}, {"introduction": "The establishment of the primary body axes—dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior—is one of the most critical events in early development. This process relies on key signaling centers that orchestrate the fates of surrounding cells through a process called induction. This exercise [@problem_id:1732542], based on a classic embryological experiment, explores the consequences of disrupting the master signaling center responsible for establishing the body axis, forcing you to identify the indispensable Spemann-Mangold organizer.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted on a fertilized egg of the African clawed frog, *Xenopus laevis*. Immediately following fertilization, the vegetal hemisphere of the egg is exposed to a brief pulse of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This treatment is known to disrupt the cytoskeleton-dependent process of cortical rotation. After the treatment, the embryo is allowed to develop. Observation at the tadpole stage reveals a severely abnormal phenotype: the embryo is composed almost entirely of ventral tissues (like epidermis and blood islands) and completely lacks dorsal structures, including a brain, spinal cord, notochord, and somites. This \"ventralized\" phenotype is most directly caused by the failure to establish which one of the following key signaling centers during the blastula and gastrula stages?\n\nA. The Animal Cap\n\nB. The Spemann-Mangold Organizer\n\nC. The Notochord\n\nD. The Neural Crest\n\nE. The Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA)", "solution": "We analyze the causal chain from the treatment to the phenotype using established principles of early amphibian embryogenesis.\n\n1. Immediately after fertilization, cortical rotation occurs in Xenopus eggs. This is a microtubule-dependent movement of the egg cortex relative to the inner cytoplasm that transports dorsal determinants from the vegetal pole toward the future dorsal side. UV irradiation of the vegetal hemisphere right after fertilization disrupts microtubules and blocks cortical rotation. Therefore, dorsal determinants fail to be relocated.\n\n2. The relocation of dorsal determinants normally stabilizes dorsal nuclear $\\beta$-catenin and establishes the dorsal vegetal signaling center known as the Nieuwkoop center. The Nieuwkoop center induces the overlying marginal zone to form the Spemann-Mangold organizer (the dorsal organizer) at the blastula/gastrula transition.\n\n3. The organizer is the key signaling center that patterns dorsal structures during gastrulation by secreting antagonists of BMP and Wnt signaling and by giving rise to axial mesoderm (including the prechordal plate and notochord). If the organizer fails to form, BMP signaling remains unopposed, leading to a global shift toward ventral fates.\n\n4. The observed phenotype—an embryo composed almost entirely of ventral tissues (epidermis and blood islands) with complete absence of dorsal structures (brain, spinal cord, notochord, somites)—is the classic ventralized outcome of blocked cortical rotation and failure to establish the organizer.\n\n5. Evaluating the options:\n- A. The animal cap is a region of prospective ectoderm, not a signaling center that establishes dorsoventral polarity.\n- B. The Spemann-Mangold organizer is the dorsal signaling center induced by the Nieuwkoop center; its absence directly causes ventralization and loss of dorsal structures.\n- C. The notochord is a dorsal derivative induced and patterned by the organizer; its absence is a consequence, not the primary failed signaling center.\n- D. The neural crest forms later at the neural plate border and depends on earlier dorsal induction; again, absence is downstream.\n- E. The ZPA is a limb bud signaling center active much later in development and is irrelevant to early dorsoventral axis formation in Xenopus embryos.\n\nTherefore, the ventralized phenotype is most directly caused by failure to establish the Spemann-Mangold organizer during blastula/gastrula stages.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1732542"}, {"introduction": "While removing developmental signals is informative, so is artificially activating them in a \"gain-of-function\" experiment. This problem [@problem_id:1732565] explores the consequences of treating an embryo with lithium chloride, a chemical that constitutively activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This provides a crucial molecular link between a specific signaling molecule, $\\beta$-catenin, and the specification of the dorsal axis, complementing the loss-of-function scenario in the previous problem.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, an experiment is conducted using embryos of the African clawed frog, *Xenopus laevis*. A batch of embryos is allowed to develop normally to the 32-cell stage. At this point, the embryos are briefly placed in a solution containing a low concentration of lithium chloride (LiCl). After this treatment, the embryos are returned to a normal culture medium and observed.\n\nLithium chloride is known to be a specific inhibitor of the enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3). This enzyme plays a crucial role in degrading a key signaling protein, thereby acting as a negative regulator of a major developmental pathway. In a normal embryo, this signaling protein accumulates only on the future dorsal side, where it specifies the location of the primary embryonic organizer.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following choices most accurately predicts the resulting phenotype of the treated embryos and identifies the signaling pathway that is constitutively activated by the LiCl treatment?\n\nA. A severely ventralized phenotype, characterized by an excess of ventral tissues like blood and a lack of dorsal structures like the brain and notochord, due to misregulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway.\n\nB. A hyper-dorsalized phenotype, often resulting in an embryo with a duplicated dorsal axis (e.g., two heads), due to constitutive activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.\n\nC. A failure of mesoderm induction, resulting in an embryo composed primarily of ectoderm and endoderm, due to inhibition of the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway.\n\nD. A severely caudalized phenotype, where anterior structures like the head and eyes are absent, due to over-activation of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.\n\nE. A complete arrest of cell division shortly after treatment, as GSK-3 is essential for progressing through the cell cycle.", "solution": "Identify the molecular target and pathway: Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a specific inhibitor of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3). In the canonical Wnt pathway, GSK-3 is part of the destruction complex (with Axin, APC, and CK1) that phosphorylates $\\beta$-catenin, marking it for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Thus, GSK-3 acts as a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling by promoting the degradation of $\\beta$-catenin.\n\nRelate to normal embryonic patterning: In Xenopus embryos, a dorsal enrichment of stabilized $\\beta$-catenin occurs due to localized inhibition of GSK-3 activity on the future dorsal side, leading to activation of Wnt target genes via TCF/LEF transcription factors. This dorsal accumulation specifies the Nieuwkoop center and induces the Spemann organizer, establishing the dorsal axis.\n\nPredict the effect of LiCl treatment: Inhibiting GSK-3 with LiCl globally prevents phosphorylation and degradation of $\\beta$-catenin. Consequently, $\\beta$-catenin accumulates throughout the embryo, constitutively activating canonical Wnt signaling in regions where it is normally low or absent. This mimics and expands dorsal patterning signals across the embryo.\n\nInfer the phenotype: Global stabilization of $\\beta$-catenin leads to hyper-dorsalization, often producing embryos with duplicated or expanded dorsal structures (e.g., two heads or radial dorsalization), a classic outcome of ectopic canonical Wnt activation in Xenopus.\n\nEvaluate alternatives:\n- Option A (ventralization via BMP) is inconsistent: BMP signaling promotes ventral fates, whereas LiCl activates Wnt by inhibiting GSK-3, leading to dorsalization, not ventralization.\n- Option C (FGF pathway inhibition and mesoderm failure) does not follow from GSK-3 inhibition; LiCl does not specifically block FGF signaling and often enhances dorsal mesoderm.\n- Option D (retinoic acid over-activation and caudalization) is unrelated to GSK-3 inhibition and $\\beta$-catenin stabilization.\n- Option E (cell cycle arrest) is not observed in this context; embryos continue dividing and developing with altered patterning, not arrested proliferation.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is a hyper-dorsalized phenotype due to constitutive activation of the canonical Wnt pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1732565"}]}
