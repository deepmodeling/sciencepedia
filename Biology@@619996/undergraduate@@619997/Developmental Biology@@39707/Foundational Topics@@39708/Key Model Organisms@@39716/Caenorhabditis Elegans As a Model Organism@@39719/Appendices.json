{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of classical genetics is the ability to infer gene function from an observable phenotype. In *C. elegans* research, a systematic nomenclature has developed over decades, linking specific mutant characteristics to classes of genes. This exercise challenges you to think like a geneticist, using the classic \"uncoordinated\" or `unc` phenotype to deduce which biological system is most likely impaired, a fundamental skill for interpreting genetic screens [@problem_id:1674169].", "problem": "In a genetic screen using the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*, a researcher isolates a new mutant strain. The worms in this strain are viable and have a normal gross morphology, but they exhibit a distinct behavioral phenotype: their movement is jerky and irregular, a characteristic broadly described as \"uncoordinated.\" In *C. elegans* genetics, genes identified by this phenotype are typically given the designation *unc*. Based on this observation, which of the following functional classes of genes is most likely to be affected in this mutant?\n\nA. Genes essential for early embryonic axis formation, which determine the head-tail and dorsal-ventral orientation.\n\nB. Genes that regulate the timing of cell lineage progression, often called heterochronic genes.\n\nC. Genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis or structural integrity of the worm's outer cuticle.\n\nD. Genes whose products are components of the neuromuscular system, such as proteins in neurons or muscle cells.", "solution": "1) The observed phenotype is viable animals with normal gross morphology but with jerky, irregular movement broadly described as \"uncoordinated,\" which in Caenorhabditis elegans genetics corresponds to the classical \"Unc\" phenotype and the gene designation unc.\n\n2) In C. elegans, mutations in genes essential for early embryonic axis formation typically cause severe developmental defects and often embryonic or early larval lethality, not viable adults with isolated movement defects. Therefore, option A is unlikely.\n\n3) Heterochronic genes regulate the timing of cell lineage and stage-specific developmental events (e.g., precocious or retarded cell fates, altered alae formation). Their primary readouts are temporal patterning defects rather than isolated locomotion abnormalities. Therefore, option B is unlikely.\n\n4) Genes affecting the cuticle often produce distinct gross morphological phenotypes such as dumpy (dpy), roller (rol), blister (bli), or squat morphologies. While cuticle defects can influence movement, they usually alter body shape or surface structure, producing conspicuous morphological changes rather than normal gross morphology with solely uncoordinated movement. Therefore, option C is less consistent with the description.\n\n5) The canonical unc class encompasses genes whose products function in the neuromuscular system, including neuronal ion channels, synaptic vesicle cycle proteins, axon guidance molecules, neurotransmitter receptors, and muscle structural or contractile components. Mutations in these genes commonly yield viable animals with normal overall morphology but defective coordination and locomotion. Therefore, option D best matches the phenotype.\n\nConclusion: The most likely functional class is genes whose products are components of the neuromuscular system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1674169"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful features of *C. elegans* is its completely mapped and invariant cell lineage, which includes a precise program of cell death, or apoptosis. This predictability allows us to make exact quantitative predictions about the consequences of genetic mutations. This practice asks you to calculate the cellular outcome of disabling a key pro-apoptotic gene, `ced-3`, thereby reinforcing your understanding of how single genes can control fundamental developmental processes [@problem_id:1674139].", "problem": "The nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* is a powerful model organism for studying developmental biology due to its invariant cell lineage. In a wild-type hermaphrodite, a total of 1090 somatic cells are generated during development. Of these, a specific subset of 131 cells are destined to be eliminated through a genetically controlled process. This elimination is critically dependent on the `ced-3` gene, which encodes a key protein required for the execution of cell death.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *C. elegans* in which the `ced-3` gene has a loss-of-function mutation, rendering the CED-3 protein completely non-functional. Assuming all other developmental processes, including cell division and differentiation, are unaffected by this mutation, what would be the exact final number of somatic cells in an adult hermaphrodite of this mutant strain?\n\nProvide your answer as an exact integer.", "solution": "Let $N_{\\text{generated}}$ denote the total number of somatic cells produced during development and $N_{\\text{eliminated}}$ denote the number of cells removed by programmed cell death.\n\nBy the problem statement, in wild type,\n$$\nN_{\\text{generated}}=1090, \\quad N_{\\text{eliminated}}=131.\n$$\nThe wild-type adult somatic cell number is therefore\n$$\nN_{\\text{adult, WT}}=N_{\\text{generated}}-N_{\\text{eliminated}}=1090-131=959.\n$$\nIn the ced-3 loss-of-function mutant, CED-3 is non-functional, so the genetically controlled cell death does not occur. Under the assumption that all other developmental processes are unaffected, the number of eliminated cells in the mutant is\n$$\nN_{\\text{eliminated, mutant}}=0.\n$$\nHence, the adult somatic cell number in the mutant is\n$$\nN_{\\text{adult, mutant}}=N_{\\text{generated}}-N_{\\text{eliminated, mutant}}=1090-0=1090.\n$$\nTherefore, the exact final number of somatic cells in an adult hermaphrodite of this mutant strain is $1090$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1090}$$", "id": "1674139"}, {"introduction": "Studying mutations that are essential for an organism's survival, such as embryonic lethal mutations, presents a significant practical challenge. Geneticists have devised elegant solutions, like balancer chromosomes, to maintain these mutations in a population without them being lost. This problem delves into the logic of a balanced lethal system, requiring you to analyze a genetic cross to understand how these sophisticated tools ensure that only specific heterozygous animals survive, allowing for the stable propagation of otherwise lethal alleles [@problem_id:1674132].", "problem": "A student in a developmental biology laboratory is tasked with maintaining a strain of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*. This strain carries a recessive embryonic lethal mutation, designated `let-77`, on chromosome II. To prevent the loss of this mutation from the population through selection, the `let-77` allele is maintained in a heterozygous state opposite a special balancer chromosome, `mIn1`.\n\nThe `mIn1` balancer chromosome has the following critical properties:\n1. It contains a dominant marker, an integrated transgene that drives expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the pharynx, making the worm's pharynx visibly glow green under fluorescent light.\n2. It is homozygous lethal, meaning embryos with two copies of `mIn1` cannot survive.\n3. It effectively suppresses meiotic recombination with its homologous chromosome (chromosome II).\n\nThe student maintains the strain by allowing the heterozygous `let-77 / mIn1` hermaphrodites to self-fertilize. After several generations, the student consistently observes that all viable, fertile adult worms in the population show green fluorescence in their pharynx. No viable, fertile adults that lack GFP are ever found.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and complete genetic explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The only viable progeny from a `let-77 / mIn1` self-cross are `let-77 / mIn1` heterozygotes. Worms homozygous for `let-77` die due to the lethal mutation, and worms homozygous for `mIn1` die due to the balancer's own lethality.\n\nB. The `let-77` mutation causes sterility in the non-GFP worms, so while they may hatch, they cannot contribute to subsequent generations.\n\nC. The GFP marker gene on the `mIn1` chromosome actively suppresses the lethal effect of the `let-77` mutation, a phenomenon known as intergenic complementation.\n\nD. Meiotic recombination between the `let-77` chromosome and the `mIn1` balancer chromosome creates a new chromosome that carries both `let-77` and the GFP marker, which is then selected for.\n\nE. The worms homozygous for `mIn1` are viable but sterile, while worms homozygous for `let-77` are lethal. This imbalance ensures the GFP-positive worms always outnumber the non-GFP worms.", "solution": "We denote the chromosome II homologs as $L$ for the chromosome carrying the recessive embryonic lethal allele $let\\text{-}77$ and $B$ for the balancer chromosome $mIn1$. The key genetic properties stated are:\n- $let\\text{-}77$ is recessive embryonic lethal, so $L/L$ embryos are nonviable.\n- $mIn1$ is homozygous lethal, so $B/B$ embryos are nonviable.\n- $mIn1$ carries a dominant GFP marker, so any genotype with at least one $B$ shows GFP in the pharynx.\n- Recombination between $L$ and $B$ is effectively suppressed, so only parental homologs segregate.\n\nStarting with a self-fertilizing heterozygote $L/B$, Mendelian segregation with suppressed recombination produces gametes $L$ and $B$ each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus the zygotic genotype distribution from $L/B \\times L/B$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(L/L) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4},\\\\\nP(L/B) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2},\\\\\nP(B/B) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nApplying viability:\n- $L/L$ die embryonically due to the recessive lethal $let\\text{-}77$.\n- $B/B$ die due to the balancer’s homozygous lethality.\n- Only $L/B$ survive; these are GFP-positive due to the dominant marker on $B$.\n\nTherefore, all viable, fertile adults are $L/B$ and GFP-positive; no GFP-negative adults survive to be observed. This precisely matches statement A, while B, C, D, and E contradict the given properties (B confuses lethality with sterility; C invokes nonexistent suppression/complementation by GFP; D contradicts suppressed recombination; E contradicts the stated homozygous lethality of $mIn1$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1674132"}]}
