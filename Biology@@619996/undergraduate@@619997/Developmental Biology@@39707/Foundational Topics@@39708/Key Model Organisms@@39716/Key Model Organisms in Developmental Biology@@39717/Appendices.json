The fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* provides a powerful model for this, revealing a hierarchical cascade of gene expression that systematically divides the embryo into segments. This exercise challenges you to work like a geneticist, using the specific phenotype of a mutant embryo to deduce which level of this genetic hierarchy has been disrupted [@problem_id:1696985].", "problem": "In a genetic screen for developmental defects in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a biologist identifies a recessive lethal mutation. Homozygous mutant embryos proceed through early development but fail to hatch. Upon examining the cuticle preparation of these unhatched embryos, the biologist observes that while the head and thoracic segments have formed correctly, all eight abdominal segments are completely absent, resulting in a severely truncated body plan.\n\nThe formation of the segmented body plan in *Drosophila* is orchestrated by a hierarchical cascade of gene activity. Based on this well-established hierarchy, a mutation in a gene belonging to which of the following functional classes is the most direct and likely cause of the observed phenotype?\n\nA. Gap genes\n\nB. Pair-rule genes\n\nC. Segment polarity genes\n\nD. Homeotic selector (Hox) genes\n\nE. Maternal coordinate genes", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the class of segmentation gene most likely responsible for a specific phenotype in a *Drosophila* embryo: the complete absence of the abdominal region, while the head and thorax are normal. To solve this, we must analyze the function of each gene class in the segmentation hierarchy.\n\nThe establishment of the *Drosophila* body plan follows a strict hierarchy:\n1.  **Maternal Coordinate Genes:** These genes, such as *bicoid* and *nanos*, are transcribed in the mother's nurse cells and their mRNA is deposited into the oocyte. Their protein products form concentration gradients along the anterior-posterior axis after fertilization. *Bicoid* protein specifies anterior structures (head and thorax), while *Nanos* protein is required for the formation of posterior structures (abdomen). A mutation in *nanos* would indeed lead to the loss of abdominal segments. However, these genes are at the very top of the hierarchy, providing the initial spatial information for the zygotic genome.\n\n2.  **Gap Genes:** These are the first zygotic genes to be expressed in response to the maternal coordinate gene gradients. Genes like *hunchback*, *Krüppel*, *knirps*, and *giant* are expressed in broad, overlapping domains along the anterior-posterior axis. Their function is to divide the embryo into large, multi-segmental regions. Crucially, a mutation in a gap gene results in the deletion of a large, contiguous block of segments corresponding to the region where that gene is normally expressed. For example, a null mutation in the gap gene *knirps* is known to cause the loss of abdominal segments A1 through A7. This perfectly matches the phenotype described in the problem—the loss of the entire abdominal region.\n\n3.  **Pair-Rule Genes:** These genes, such as *even-skipped* and *fushi tarazu*, are regulated by the gap genes. They are expressed in a pattern of seven transverse stripes along the embryo. Their function is to divide the broad domains established by gap genes into smaller units, establishing the 14-parasegment plan of the embryo. A mutation in a pair-rule gene results in the deletion of every other segment, leading to an embryo with only half the normal number of segments. This pattern of alternating deletions is inconsistent with the observed phenotype of a single, large deletion of the entire abdomen.\n\n4.  **Segment Polarity Genes:** These genes, such as *engrailed* and *wingless*, are expressed in a repeating pattern in a single stripe within each of the 14 parasegments. They function to define the anterior and posterior compartments within each individual segment and to reinforce segment boundaries. A mutation in a segment polarity gene causes defects in every segment, typically a deletion of one part of the segment and a mirror-image duplication of the remaining part. This also does not match the observed phenotype.\n\n5.  **Homeotic Selector (Hox) Genes:** These genes are activated later and are regulated by the combination of gap and pair-rule genes. Their role is not to create segments, but to provide each segment with its unique identity (e.g., determining which segment grows legs, wings, or halteres). A mutation in a Hox gene causes a homeotic transformation, where one body part is replaced by another (e.g., legs growing in place of antennae). It does not cause the deletion of segments.\n\nComparing the options, both maternal coordinate genes (E) and gap genes (A) can cause the loss of the abdomen. However, the gap genes are the first tier of the *zygotic* segmentation cascade that directly subdivides the embryo into large regions. The loss of a large, contiguous block of segments is the classic, defining phenotype for a mutation in a gap gene. Therefore, a gap gene mutation is the most direct and specific explanation for the observed phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1696985"}, {"introduction": "Once body regions are established, they must be given a specific identity. The ABC model of flower development in *Arabidopsis thaliana* is a beautifully simple illustration of how a small number of master regulatory genes, acting in different combinations, can specify a variety of distinct organs. By analyzing a mutant flower with a rearranged pattern of organs, you can retrace the logic of this combinatorial code and identify the likely genetic failure [@problem_id:1696983].", "problem": "In developmental biology, the flowering plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* serves as a crucial model organism for understanding how genes control organ formation. The identity of floral organs is governed by the ABC model, which describes the combinatorial action of three classes of homeotic genes (Class A, Class B, and Class C) across four concentric whorls of the flower bud, numbered from outermost (Whorl 1) to innermost (Whorl 4).\n\nThe wild-type (normal) flower has sepals in Whorl 1, petals in Whorl 2, stamens (male reproductive organs) in Whorl 3, and carpels (female reproductive organs) in Whorl 4. The genetic rules for organ identity are as follows:\n- Whorl 1: Expression of Class A genes alone results in sepals.\n- Whorl 2: Co-expression of Class A and Class B genes results in petals.\n- Whorl 3: Co-expression of Class B and Class C genes results in stamens.\n- Whorl 4: Expression of Class C genes alone results in carpels.\n\nA key feature of this model is the mutual antagonism between Class A and Class C genes: where Class A is active, Class C is repressed, and where Class C is active, Class A is repressed. In a wild-type flower, Class A genes are expressed in Whorls 1 and 2, while Class C genes are expressed in Whorls 3 and 4. Class B genes are expressed in Whorls 2 and 3.\n\nA botanist discovers a stable mutant lineage of *Arabidopsis thaliana* that exhibits a floral organ pattern of sepal, petal, petal, sepal, moving from Whorl 1 to Whorl 4, respectively. Based on the ABC model, which of the following genetic alterations is the most likely cause for this phenotype?\n\nA. A loss-of-function mutation in a Class A gene.\n\nB. A loss-of-function mutation in a Class B gene.\n\nC. A loss-of-function mutation in a Class C gene.\n\nD. A gain-of-function mutation causing ectopic expression of a Class B gene in all four whorls.\n\nE. A gain-of-function mutation causing ectopic expression of a Class C gene in all four whorls.", "solution": "We translate the ABC rules into organ identities per whorl based on gene activities:\n- If only Class A is active in a whorl, the organ is sepal.\n- If Class A and Class B are co-active, the organ is petal.\n- If Class B and Class C are co-active, the organ is stamen.\n- If only Class C is active, the organ is carpel.\nMutual antagonism: Class A and Class C repress each other; thus where Class A is active, Class C is inactive, and vice versa. In wild type, Class A is in whorls 1 and 2, Class B in whorls 2 and 3, and Class C in whorls 3 and 4.\n\nThe observed mutant organ sequence is: Whorl 1 sepal, Whorl 2 petal, Whorl 3 petal, Whorl 4 sepal. Mapping these organs back to gene activities:\n- Whorl 1 sepal implies Class A alone active in whorl 1 (consistent with wild type).\n- Whorl 2 petal implies Class A and Class B co-active in whorl 2 (consistent with wild type), indicating Class B function is intact at least in whorl 2.\n- Whorl 3 petal implies Class A and Class B co-active in whorl 3. Therefore, Class A must be ectopically active in whorl 3 and Class C must be inactive there (since Class A and Class C antagonize). Class B in whorl 3 is the wild-type domain.\n- Whorl 4 sepal implies Class A alone active in whorl 4; thus both Class B and Class C must be inactive in whorl 4. Class B is normally absent in whorl 4, so this requires loss of Class C and expansion of Class A into whorl 4.\n\nThe simplest alteration that yields Class A activity in whorls 3 and 4 (and absence of Class C in those whorls) while leaving Class B in whorls 2 and 3 is a loss-of-function of a Class C gene. By mutual antagonism, loss of Class C allows Class A to expand inward to whorls 3 and 4, producing petals in whorl 3 (Class A + Class B) and sepals in whorl 4 (Class A alone).\n\nEvaluation of alternatives:\n- A loss-of-function of Class A would permit Class C to expand outward (by antagonism), producing carpels and stamens in outer whorls, not the observed sepal-petal-petal-sepal pattern.\n- A loss-of-function of Class B would produce sepals in whorls 1–2 and carpels in whorls 3–4, not matching.\n- Ectopic Class B in all whorls would yield petals in whorls 1–2 (with Class A) and stamens in whorls 3–4 (with Class C), not matching.\n- Ectopic Class C in all whorls would produce carpels in whorl 1, stamens in whorls 2–3, and carpels in whorl 4, not matching.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause is a loss-of-function mutation in a Class C gene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1696983"}, {"introduction": "Development involves not just the creation of cells and tissues, but their precise organization and interconnection, often guided by cell migration and axon pathfinding. Classic embryological experiments, involving surgical manipulation of tissues, have been instrumental in revealing the underlying guidance cues. This problem presents a famous somite rotation experiment in a chick embryo, allowing you to interpret the results to understand how pre-existing patterns within a tissue can create pathways for migrating cells and axons [@problem_id:1696999].", "problem": "In developmental biology, the segmented organization of the vertebrate body plan is established by the sequential formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm. Each somite subsequently differentiates into the dermomyotome and the sclerotome. The sclerotome, in particular, gives rise to the vertebrae and ribs. During early embryogenesis, neural crest cells and the axons of motor neurons must navigate through the somitic environment to reach their targets.\n\nConsider a classic experiment performed on a chick embryo. A single, newly formed thoracic somite is surgically excised. This somite is then rotated 180 degrees about its anteroposterior (A-P) axis and carefully reimplanted into its original location. After a period of further development, the migration patterns of neural crest cells and motor axons originating from the adjacent segment of the neural tube are observed. The result is that these cells and axons do not migrate through the half of the reimplanted somite that is now positioned anteriorly (closer to the head). Instead, they are observed to migrate exclusively through the half of the somite that is now positioned posteriorly (closer to the tail).\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, what is the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn regarding the guidance of these migrating cells and axons?\n\nA. The anteroposterior polarity of the somite is intrinsically determined before neural crest and axon migration, and this pre-patterned polarity dictates their subsequent migration pathways.\n\nB. Neural crest cells are responsible for inducing a permissive migratory environment by secreting signaling factors that alter the character of the somite tissue they first encounter.\n\nC. The notochord provides a dominant, long-range attractive signal that defines the migratory corridor, effectively overriding any local molecular cues present within the somite itself.\n\nD. The polarity of a somite is highly plastic and is rapidly re-specified by inductive signals from the overlying surface ectoderm and the adjacent neural tube after its surgical manipulation.\n\nE. Motor axons act as pioneers that enzymatically degrade extracellular matrix molecules to create a path, which is then passively followed by the migrating neural crest cell population.", "solution": "1. Known developmental principle: Each sclerotome is subdivided into an anterior (rostral) half that is permissive for neural crest cell and motor axon migration, and a posterior (caudal) half that is non-permissive due to repellent cues (for example, ephrin family members, semaphorins, and specific extracellular matrix components). This intrinsic anteroposterior polarity within each somite governs the segmental pathways used by migrating neural crest cells and motor axons.\n\n2. Surgical manipulation: Rotating a single somite by 180 degrees about its anteroposterior axis swaps the positions of its intrinsic anterior and posterior halves relative to the embryo’s global anteroposterior coordinates, but does not alter the intrinsic identity of those halves within the somite tissue itself at the time of rotation.\n\n3. Experimental observation: After rotation and reimplantation, neural crest cells and motor axons avoid the half now positioned anteriorly and migrate exclusively through the half now positioned posteriorly. Interpreted with respect to the somite’s original intrinsic identity, the half now posterior was originally the anterior (permissive) half, and the half now anterior was originally the posterior (non-permissive) half.\n\n4. Deduction: The migrating cells and axons are reading pre-existing, local cues in the somite that are preserved through the manipulation. If long-range cues such as those from the notochord were dominant, or if rapid respecification of polarity by surrounding tissues occurred, migration would align with the embryo’s positional coordinates rather than with the somite’s original intrinsic halves. Similarly, if neural crest cells or motor axons were primarily responsible for creating the permissive path de novo, the observed strict adherence to the somite’s pre-patterned halves would not be expected.\n\n5. Evaluation of options:\n- A is supported: The result demonstrates that anteroposterior polarity is intrinsically specified in the somite before neural crest and axon migration and that this pre-pattern locally dictates the migratory pathway.\n- B is contradicted: Neural crest cells do not reprogram the first half they encounter; they avoid a rotated posterior (non-permissive) half.\n- C is contradicted: A putative dominant long-range attractant does not override local somite cues.\n- D is contradicted: Rapid respecification by ectoderm or neural tube would predict migration through the half now anterior, which is not observed.\n- E is contradicted: The path is defined by somite-derived polarity rather than by axon-mediated ECM degradation, and in trunk regions neural crest migration typically precedes motor axon outgrowth.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that somite anteroposterior polarity is intrinsically determined and directs migration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1696999"}]}
