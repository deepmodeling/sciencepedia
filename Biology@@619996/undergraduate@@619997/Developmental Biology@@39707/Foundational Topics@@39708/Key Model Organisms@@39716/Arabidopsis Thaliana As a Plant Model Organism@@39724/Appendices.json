The biologist isolates this plant and confirms that the trait is heritable. To determine the genetic nature of this new phenotype, the biologist performs a controlled experiment. First, the original dwarf mutant is crossed with a pure-breeding, wild-type plant. Then, a single individual from the resulting first filial (F1) generation is allowed to self-pollinate, producing a second filial (F2) generation.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes observed in the F2 generation would provide conclusive evidence that the allele responsible for the dwarf phenotype is dominant?\n\nA. All plants in the F2 generation are dwarf.\n\nB. The F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of approximately 3 wild-type plants to 1 dwarf plant.\n\nC. The F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of approximately 1 wild-type plant to 3 dwarf plants.\n\nD. The F2 generation exhibits three distinct phenotypes: wild-type, dwarf, and an intermediate height phenotype.\n\nE. All plants in the F1 generation are phenotypically identical to the wild-type parent.", "solution": "Let the trait be determined by a single Mendelian locus with two alleles. Consider two alternative hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 1 (dwarf dominant): Let $D$ be the dwarf allele and $d$ the wild-type allele. Phenotypes: $DD$ and $Dd$ are dwarf; $dd$ is wild-type. The pure-breeding wild-type parent must be $dd$. The dwarf mutant can be $DD$ or $Dd$.\n\n- If the mutant is $DD$, the cross $DD \\times dd$ gives F1 all $Dd$ (all dwarf). Selfing a $Dd$ yields\n$$\nD d \\times D d \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{F2 genotypes } DD : Dd : dd = \\frac{1}{4} : \\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nPhenotypes: dwarf fraction $P(\\text{dwarf}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$; wild-type fraction $P(\\text{wild}) = \\frac{1}{4}$. Thus the F2 phenotypic ratio is $3$ dwarf to $1$ wild-type, equivalently $1$ wild-type to $3$ dwarf.\n\n- If the mutant is $Dd$, the cross $Dd \\times dd$ gives F1 $\\frac{1}{2}\\,$Dd$ (dwarf) and $\\frac{1}{2}\\,$$dd$ (wild-type). The single F1 chosen to self could be either genotype. If a $Dd$ individual is selfed, the same F2 ratio as above results:\n$$\nD d \\times D d \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{F2 phenotypes } 3 \\text{ dwarf} : 1 \\text{ wild-type}.\n$$\nIf a $dd$ individual is selfed, the F2 are all $dd$ (all wild-type). Therefore, under dominant dwarf, an observed F2 ratio of $3$ dwarf to $1$ wild-type (i.e., $1$ wild-type to $3$ dwarf) is the expected monohybrid outcome when the selfed F1 is heterozygous.\n\nHypothesis 2 (dwarf recessive): Let $d$ be the dwarf allele and $D$ the wild-type allele. Phenotypes: $dd$ is dwarf; $DD$ and $Dd$ are wild-type. The pure-breeding wild-type parent must be $DD$, and the dwarf mutant is $dd$. The cross $dd \\times DD$ gives F1 all $Dd$ (all wild-type).

The complementation test is an elegant genetic tool designed for this purpose, relying on the phenotype of the F1 offspring from a cross between two recessive mutants. This practice problem on petal-less *Arabidopsis* mutants [@problem_id:1671883] will help you master the logic of complementation, distinguishing between mutations that are allelic and those that affect different genes.", "problem": "In the study of floral development in the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the wild-type flower possesses four whorls of organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. A developmental biologist isolates two distinct, true-breeding mutant lines from different populations. Both mutant lines, which we will call *mutant-alpha* and *mutant-beta*, exhibit the exact same recessive phenotype: their flowers completely lack petals (a condition known as apetalous), but are otherwise normal.\n\nTo determine if the mutations in *mutant-alpha* and *mutant-beta* are alleles of the same gene or are mutations in two different genes, the biologist performs a genetic cross between a plant from the *mutant-alpha* line and a plant from the *mutant-beta* line. The resulting seeds are collected and grown into the first filial (F1) generation.\n\nWhich of the following phenotypic outcomes observed in the F1 generation would provide conclusive evidence that the mutations in *mutant-alpha* and *mutant-beta* are located in the same gene?\n\nA.

The F1 plants consist of approximately 50% plants with wild-type flowers and 50% with apetalous flowers.\n\nE. The F1 plants exhibit a novel phenotype, such as having extra stamens in place of petals.", "solution": "This problem describes a classic genetic experiment known as a complementation test. A complementation test is used to determine whether two recessive mutations that cause the same phenotype are alleles of the same gene or are mutations in different genes.\n\nLet's analyze the two possible scenarios for the genetic basis of the apetalous phenotype in the *mutant-alpha* and *mutant-beta* lines.\n\n**Scenario 1: The mutations are in different genes (Complementation occurs).**\n\nSuppose two different genes, Gene A and Gene B, are both required for petal development. A recessive mutation in either gene leads to an apetalous phenotype.\nLet $A$ be the wild-type allele for Gene A, and $a$ be the recessive mutant allele.\nLet $B$ be the wild-type allele for Gene B, and $b$ be the recessive mutant allele.\n\nThe wild-type genotype has at least one dominant allele for each gene (e.g., $A\\_ B\\_$).\nThe *mutant-alpha* line could have a mutation in Gene A, making its genotype $aa\\;BB$. It is true-breeding for this genotype.\nThe *mutant-beta* line could have a mutation in Gene B, making its genotype $AA\\;bb$. It is also true-breeding.\n\nNow, we perform the cross:\nParental Cross: *mutant-alpha* ($aa\\;BB$) $\\times$ *mutant-beta* ($AA\\;bb$)\n\nThe gametes produced by *mutant-alpha* will all be $aB$.\nThe gametes produced by *mutant-beta* will all be $Ab$.\n\nThe F1 generation will have a genotype resulting from the fusion of these gametes:\nF1 Genotype: $Aa\\;Bb$\n\nBecause the F1 individuals are heterozygous for both genes, they possess one functional wild-type allele ($A$) and one functional wild-type allele ($B$). The wild-type allele from the *mutant-beta* parent ($A$) \"complements\" the defect in Gene A from the *mutant-alpha* parent. Similarly, the wild-type allele from the *mutant-alpha* parent ($B$) \"complements\" the defect in Gene B from the *mutant-beta* parent. As a result, the F1 plants will have the wild-type phenotype, meaning they will produce flowers with petals. This outcome corresponds to option A.\n\n**Scenario 2: The mutations are in the same gene (Failure to complement).**\n\nSuppose there is only one gene, Gene P, responsible for petal development. Let $P$ be the wild-type allele. The *mutant-alpha* and *mutant-beta* lines both have mutations in this gene, but they may be different mutant alleles.\nLet $p\\text{-}alpha$ be the recessive mutant allele found in the *mutant-alpha* line.\nLet $p\\text{-}beta$ be the recessive mutant allele found in the *mutant-beta* line.\n\nThe *mutant-alpha* line has genotype $p\\text{-}alpha/p\\text{-}alpha$.\nThe *mutant-beta* line has genotype $p\\text{-}beta/p\\text{-}beta$.\n\nNow, we perform the cross:\nParental Cross: *mutant-alpha* ($p\\text{-}alpha/p\\text{-}alpha$) $\\times$ *mutant-beta* ($p\\text{-}beta/p\\text{-}beta$)\n\nThe gametes from *mutant-alpha* are all $p\\text{-}alpha$.\nThe gametes from *mutant-beta* are all $p\\text{-}beta$.\n\nThe F1 generation will have the following genotype:\nF1 Genotype: $p\\text{-}alpha/p\\text{-}beta$\n\nThis F1 individual is a \"compound heterozygote\" because it has two different mutant alleles for the same gene. Since both $p\\text{-}alpha$ and $p\\text{-}beta$ are recessive, non-functional alleles, the F1 plant has no functional copy of Gene P. Therefore, it cannot produce the wild-type protein needed for petal development. The F1 plants will exhibit the mutant (apetalous) phenotype. This is called a \"failure to complement\". This outcome indicates that the two original mutations are alleles of the same gene. This corresponds to option B.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n*   A. All F1 plants produce wild-type flowers with petals. This is the result of successful complementation, meaning the mutations are in different genes.\n*   B. All F1 plants produce apetalous flowers that lack petals. This is the result of a failure to complement, meaning the mutations are in the same gene. This is the correct answer.\n*   C. A 3:1 ratio of wild-type to mutant. This is the classic Mendelian ratio for the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross, not the F1 generation.\n*   D. A 1:1 ratio of wild-type to mutant. This ratio would be expected from a test cross (a heterozygote crossed with a homozygous recessive), which is not the cross being performed.\n*   E. A novel phenotype. This can sometimes occur due to interactions between alleles (e.g., incomplete dominance or co-dominance) or genes, but it is not the standard outcome for a complementation test designed to test for allelism. The most direct conclusion comes from observing a restoration of wild-type or a persistence of the mutant phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the observation that all F1 progeny are apetalous demonstrates a failure to complement and proves the mutations are alleles of the same gene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1671883"}, {"introduction": "After identifying multiple genes involved in a single biological process, the next step is to uncover their functional relationship.

A researcher is investigating the genetic pathway that governs the spacing of trichomes (leaf hairs) on the surfaces of its leaves. Through a genetic screen, they have identified two distinct, recessive loss-of-function mutations in two previously uncharacterized genes, which they have named *SPACEY1* (*SPY1*) and *CLUSTERONE* (*CLO1*).\n\nThe phenotypes of the single mutants and the wild-type are characterized as follows:\n- **Wild-type:** Exhibits a regular pattern of well-separated, single trichomes on its leaf surfaces.\n- **$spy1$ mutant:** Shows a drastic reduction in overall trichome density, with only a few, widely separated trichomes forming.\n- **$clo1$ mutant:** Displays clusters of two or more trichomes growing in direct contact with one another, disrupting the normal one-trichome-per-site spacing rule.\n\nTo understand how these genes interact, the researcher constructs a $spy1\\;clo1$ double mutant. Upon observation, the phenotype of the double mutant is found to be indistinguishable from that of the $spy1$ single mutant; it also shows a severe reduction in trichome density.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements best describes the genetic relationship between the *SPACEY1* and *CLUSTERONE* genes in the trichome development pathway?\n\nA. *SPACEY1* is epistatic to *CLUSTERONE*.\n\nB. *CLUSTERONE* is epistatic to *SPACEY1*.\n\nC.

The mutations are synthetically lethal, and the double mutant is not viable.", "solution": "- Definitions and principle: In classical genetic epistasis analysis with recessive loss-of-function mutations, the gene whose mutant phenotype is observed in the double mutant is said to be epistatic (its mutation masks the other). This masking indicates that the epistatic gene’s function is required for the other gene’s phenotype to be manifested.\n\n- Observations:\n  1. Wild-type: regular, well-separated, single trichomes.\n  2. $spy1$: drastic reduction in trichome density (few, widely separated trichomes).\n  3. $clo1$: clusters of adjacent trichomes (defect in spacing/lateral inhibition).\n  4. $spy1\\;clo1$ double mutant: indistinguishable from $spy1$; severe reduction in trichome density.\n\n- Logical inference:\n  1. The double mutant shows the $spy1$ phenotype, not the $clo1$ phenotype. Therefore, the $spy1$ mutation masks the $clo1$ mutation.\n  2. By the definition above, *SPACEY1* is epistatic to *CLUSTERONE*.\n  3. A mechanistic interpretation consistent with these data is that $SPY1$ function is required for trichome initiation (or for producing enough competent sites), whereas $CLO1$ regulates spacing among initiated trichomes. In the absence of $SPY1$ function, very few trichomes form, so the clustering phenotype of $clo1$ cannot be expressed.\n\n- Exclusion of alternatives:\n  - Option B is incorrect because the double mutant does not show the $clo1$ clustering phenotype.\n  - Option C is incorrect because the double mutant is not more severe than $spy1$; it matches $spy1$.\n  - Option D is incorrect because genetic redundancy would typically yield weak or no phenotype in single mutants and a strong phenotype only in the double; here, both single mutants are clearly abnormal and distinct.\n  - Option E is incorrect because the double mutant is viable and characterized.\n\n- Conclusion: The correct relationship is that *SPACEY1* is epistatic to *CLUSTERONE*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1671851"}]}
