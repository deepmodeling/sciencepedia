A signaling molecule, called a morphogen, is produced at a source located at $x=0$ and forms a concentration gradient along the axis. The concentration of this morphogen, $C(x)$, at a position $x$ is described by the linear relationship:\n$$C(x) = C_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the concentration at the source ($x=0$).\n\nThe fate of the cells is determined by the local concentration of this morphogen.

Dorsalin is a protein secreted by a group of cells at the anterior pole. It diffuses towards the posterior, establishing a stable, monotonically decreasing concentration gradient.
