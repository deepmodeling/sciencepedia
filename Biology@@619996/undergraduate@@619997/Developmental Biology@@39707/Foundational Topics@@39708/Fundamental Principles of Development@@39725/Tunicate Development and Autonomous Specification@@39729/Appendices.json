{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand autonomous specification, we must first appreciate how fate determinants are moved to the correct location within the single-celled zygote. This process, known as ooplasmic segregation, is a highly dynamic and organized event driven by the cell's internal scaffolding. This exercise will challenge you to think like a cell biologist, using a classic experimental approach to dissect the specific roles of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in positioning determinants within the tunicate embryo [@problem_id:1731488].", "problem": "In the development of tunicates, a group of marine invertebrate chordates, a visible cytoplasmic region known as the \"yellow crescent\" plays a critical role in specifying muscle cell fate. This region is rich in determinants, including specific messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecules like *macho-1*. Following fertilization, a series of dramatic cytoplasmic rearrangements, known as ooplasmic segregation, occurs to localize these determinants to the posterior-vegetal region of the zygote, where they will ultimately be inherited by the blastomeres that form the larval tail muscles.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on tunicate embryos. Immediately following fertilization, a batch of zygotes is placed in a seawater solution containing cytochalasin D, a potent drug that specifically inhibits actin polymerization. Another batch is placed in a solution containing nocodazole, a drug that effectively depolymerizes microtubules. A third, control batch is raised in normal seawater.\n\nBased on your understanding of the cytoskeletal mechanisms driving ooplasmic segregation in tunicates, predict the most likely primary defect observed in the batch of embryos treated with nocodazole.\n\nA. The yellow crescent determinants will fail to move from their initial location and will remain dispersed in the subcortical cytoplasm.\n\nB. The yellow crescent determinants will congregate at the vegetal pole but will fail to migrate to the posterior side of the embryo.\n\nC. The yellow crescent determinants will segregate correctly and form a distinct crescent at the posterior of the embryo, just as in the control group.\n\nD. The yellow crescent determinants will form a crescent at the animal pole instead of the posterior-vegetal region.\n\nE. The yellow crescent determinants will successfully congregate at the posterior but will fail to be partitioned correctly during the first cleavage.", "solution": "Step 1: State the biological mechanism underlying the phenomenon. In tunicate embryos, ooplasmic segregation after fertilization occurs in two sequential phases that localize determinants such as the yellow crescent to the posterior-vegetal region. The first phase is a rapid, actin-dependent cortical contraction that moves cytoplasmic components, including determinants, toward the vegetal pole. The second phase is a slower, microtubule-dependent translocation, directed by the sperm aster and associated microtubule arrays, that shifts the previously gathered vegetal cytoplasm toward the future posterior side.\n\nStep 2: Identify cytoskeletal dependencies for each phase. The first phase depends primarily on actin microfilaments; the second phase depends on intact microtubules for directed transport or cortical flows toward the posterior.\n\nStep 3: Relate drug actions to the phases. Cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization and thus disrupts the first, actin-dependent phase, preventing initial gathering at the vegetal pole. Nocodazole depolymerizes microtubules and thus disrupts the second, microtubule-dependent phase, preventing the subsequent posterior shift while leaving the actin-dependent first phase intact.\n\nStep 4: Predict outcome under nocodazole. Because actin remains functional, the determinants will still congregate at the vegetal pole during the first phase. Because microtubules are depolymerized, the second phase cannot occur, so the determinants will fail to migrate from the vegetal pole to the posterior.\n\nStep 5: Match to the provided options. The described nocodazole phenotype corresponds to determinants congregating at the vegetal pole but failing to migrate to the posterior side, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1731488"}, {"introduction": "Once cytoplasmic determinants are correctly positioned, the next critical step is their delivery into different daughter cells. The orientation of the early cleavage planes is therefore a key event that translates the zygote's pre-existing spatial pattern into distinct cellular identities. This thought experiment asks you to predict the developmental consequences of altering the very first cell division, demonstrating the fundamental link between embryonic geometry and cell fate specification [@problem_id:1731494].", "problem": "The zygote of a tunicate, a marine invertebrate, is a classic model for studying autonomous specification, where cell fates are determined by cytoplasmic determinants segregated into different blastomeres during cleavage. Before the first cell division, these determinants become localized to specific regions. Consider a simplified model of a tunicate zygote with the following three distinct fate determinants:\n\n1.  **Determinant E**: Responsible for ectoderm formation, localized exclusively throughout the cytoplasm of the animal hemisphere.\n2.  **Determinant N**: Responsible for endoderm formation, localized exclusively in the cytoplasm near the vegetal pole, within the vegetal hemisphere.\n3.  **Determinant M**: Responsible for muscle formation, localized in a distinct crescent-shaped area within the posterior region of the vegetal hemisphere.\n\nIn a normal tunicate embryo, the first cleavage division is meridional, meaning the cleavage furrow passes through the animal and vegetal poles, dividing the zygote into left and right blastomeres. However, an experiment is conducted where the zygote is manipulated so that its first cleavage is forced to be **equatorial**. An equatorial cleavage plane is perpendicular to the animal-vegetal axis and divides the zygote into an upper (animal-pole) blastomere and a lower (vegetal-pole) blastomere.\n\nAssuming this experimental cleavage is perfectly equatorial, which of the following statements accurately describes the distribution of the determinants E, N, and M into the two resulting blastomeres?\n\nA. The animal blastomere receives only Determinant E. The vegetal blastomere receives both Determinant N and Determinant M.\n\nB. Both the animal and vegetal blastomeres receive a portion of all three determinants (E, N, and M).\n\nC. The animal blastomere receives Determinant E and Determinant M. The vegetal blastomere receives only Determinant N.\n\nD. The animal blastomere receives only Determinant N. The vegetal blastomere receives both Determinant E and Determinant M.\n\nE. One blastomere receives Determinants E and N, while the other blastomere receives only Determinant M.", "solution": "We are asked how cytoplasmic determinants partition between two blastomeres when the first cleavage of a tunicate zygote is experimentally forced to be equatorial. The key principle is autonomous specification by localized cytoplasmic determinants: at cleavage, each daughter cell inherits the determinants present in the portion of cytoplasm it receives.\n\nBy definition, an equatorial cleavage plane is perpendicular to the animalâ€“vegetal axis and divides the zygote into an upper animal blastomere and a lower vegetal blastomere. Therefore, cytoplasm localized to the animal hemisphere will be inherited by the animal blastomere, and cytoplasm localized to the vegetal hemisphere (including vegetal pole regions) will be inherited by the vegetal blastomere.\n\nApplying this to each determinant:\n- Determinant E (ectoderm): localized exclusively throughout the animal hemisphere. Under an equatorial cleavage, it will be inherited by the animal blastomere and excluded from the vegetal blastomere.\n- Determinant N (endoderm): localized exclusively near the vegetal pole within the vegetal hemisphere. Under an equatorial cleavage, it will be inherited by the vegetal blastomere and excluded from the animal blastomere.\n- Determinant M (muscle): localized in a crescent within the posterior region of the vegetal hemisphere. Because it resides entirely within the vegetal hemisphere, an equatorial cleavage will allocate it to the vegetal blastomere and exclude it from the animal blastomere.\n\nThus, the animal blastomere receives only Determinant E, while the vegetal blastomere receives Determinants N and M. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1731494"}, {"introduction": "How does a maternal factor, once inherited by a blastomere, actually direct that cell to adopt a specific fate? The answer lies in the logic of gene regulatory networks, where proteins switch genes on or off in a precise cascade. This practice problem models a simplified genetic circuit to help you trace the molecular pathway from a localized maternal mRNA to the control of downstream zygotic genes, illustrating the core mechanism of autonomous specification at the transcriptional level [@problem_id:1731522].", "problem": "In the early development of a tunicate embryo, cell fates are often determined by the inheritance of specific maternal factors localized in the egg cytoplasm, a process known as autonomous specification. Consider a simplified, hypothetical gene regulatory network that controls differentiation in the endoderm precursor cells.\n\nThis network consists of:\n1.  A maternal mRNA, *Mat-1*, which is exclusively localized to the blastomeres fated to become endoderm.\n2.  A zygotic gene, *Zyg-P*, which is transcriptionally activated by the Mat-1 protein.\n3.  A second zygotic gene, *Zyg-Q*, which is transcriptionally repressed by the Zyg-P protein.\n\nIn a normal, wild-type embryo, *Zyg-Q* is expressed in all cell lineages *except* for the endoderm precursors. A researcher performs an experiment by injecting a Morpholino Oligonucleotide (MO) that specifically targets and blocks the translation of the *Mat-1* mRNA.\n\nAssuming the MO is 100% effective, which of the following outcomes describes the most likely expression pattern of the *Zyg-Q* gene in the manipulated embryo?\n\nA. *Zyg-Q* expression will be completely eliminated from all cells of the embryo.\n\nB. *Zyg-Q* will be expressed ectopically in the endoderm-precursor lineage, in addition to its normal expression in other lineages.\n\nC. *Zyg-Q* expression will be restricted exclusively to the endoderm-precursor lineage.\n\nD. *Zyg-Q* expression will be confined to the ectodermal lineage only, and will be lost from the mesodermal lineage.\n\nE. The expression pattern of *Zyg-Q* will be identical to that of a wild-type embryo.", "solution": "We identify the gene regulatory relationships:\n- The maternal factor *Mat-1* is localized to endoderm precursors and produces a protein only in those cells.\n- The Mat-1 protein activates transcription of the zygotic gene *Zyg-P*. Therefore, in a wild-type situation, Zyg-P is produced specifically in endoderm precursors where Mat-1 protein is present.\n- The Zyg-P protein represses transcription of *Zyg-Q*. Hence, in wild type, *Zyg-Q* is absent from endoderm precursors (where Zyg-P is present and represses it) and present in all other lineages (where Zyg-P is absent and cannot repress it).\n\nNow consider the Morpholino Oligonucleotide (MO) injection that blocks translation of *Mat-1* mRNA with complete effectiveness. The immediate consequence is that no Mat-1 protein is produced in the endoderm precursor lineage. Without Mat-1 protein, *Zyg-P* is not transcriptionally activated in those cells. Since *Zyg-P* was already absent from other lineages in wild type (because *Mat-1* is localized only to endoderm precursors), the net effect is that *Zyg-P* protein becomes absent from all lineages.\n\nGiven that *Zyg-P* is the repressor of *Zyg-Q*, removing *Zyg-P* eliminates repression of *Zyg-Q* in the endoderm precursors. Therefore, *Zyg-Q*, which was previously expressed in all non-endoderm lineages, will now also be expressed in the endoderm precursor lineage. Consequently, the expression domain of *Zyg-Q* expands to include the endoderm precursors, adding ectopic expression there while maintaining its normal expression elsewhere.\n\nThis outcome matches the statement that *Zyg-Q* will be expressed ectopically in the endoderm-precursor lineage, in addition to its normal expression in other lineages.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1731522"}]}
