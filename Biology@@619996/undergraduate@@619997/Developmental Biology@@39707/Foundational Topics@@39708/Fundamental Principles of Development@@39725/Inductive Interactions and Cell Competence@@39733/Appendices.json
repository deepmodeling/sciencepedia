This first practice problem [@problem_id:1695288] explores this core idea, challenging you to predict a cell's fate when it is moved from its normal position in a gradient to an environment with a different, uniform signal concentration. By working through this scenario, you will reinforce the crucial distinction between a cell's potential (competence) and its final, determined fate based on inductive signals.", "problem": "In the developing embryo of the frog *Xenopus tropicalis*, the paraxial mesoderm segments into structures called somites. The differentiation of cells within a somite into sclerotome (which forms the vertebrae), myotome (which forms skeletal muscle), and dermatome (which forms the dermis of the back) is controlled by a secreted signaling molecule, which we will call \"Somitin\". Somitin is produced by the notochord, a structure adjacent to the ventral side of the somites. This creates a concentration gradient of Somitin across the dorso-ventral axis of each somite.\n\nThe cells of the early somite are considered \"competent,\" meaning they have the ability to respond to any concentration of Somitin and adopt the corresponding fate. The specific fate adopted by a cell is determined by the local concentration of Somitin it experiences, according to the following thresholds:\n*   High Concentration (> 10 nM): Induces sclerotome fate.\n*   Intermediate Concentration (1 nM to 10 nM): Induces myotome fate.\n*   Low Concentration (< 1 nM): Induces dermatome fate.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a small piece of tissue is dissected from the region of a developing somite that would normally form the myotome. This tissue explant is then cultured in a medium containing a high, uniform concentration of 15 nM of purified Somitin.\n\nAssuming the cells in the explant remain competent and viable throughout the experiment, which of the following outcomes is the most likely fate for the majority of the cells in the explant?\n\nA. The cells differentiate into sclerotome.\n\nB. The cells differentiate into myotome.\n\nC. The cells differentiate into dermatome.\n\nD.

This exercise [@problem_id:1695262] presents a hypothetical scenario where the sensitivity of the signaling system is altered through a mutation that increases the receptor's binding affinity for its ligand. By predicting the resulting phenotype, you'll gain insight into how the molecular properties of a cell's signal reception machinery are critical for interpreting positional information and generating a correctly patterned tissue.", "problem": "In a newly discovered species of reptile, the differentiation of embryonic skin cells into two distinct types, smooth scales or ridged scutes, is controlled by a secreted signaling molecule called \"Dermin,\" which acts as a morphogen. Undifferentiated ectodermal cells are competent to respond to Dermin. A low concentration of Dermin induces the cells to differentiate into smooth scales (Type S), while a high concentration of Dermin induces them to differentiate into ridged scutes (Type R). Cells that receive a negligible or zero concentration of Dermin remain as undifferentiated ectoderm.\n\nA research team isolates a mutant strain of this reptile that exhibits an abnormal skin pattern. Genetic analysis reveals a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Dermin receptor. This mutation does not alter the number or cellular location of the receptors but significantly increases the binding affinity of the receptor for the Dermin molecule. Assume that in this mutant, the production and spatial distribution (gradient) of the Dermin morphogen itself are completely normal.\n\nWhat is the most likely phenotype you would predict for the skin of an embryo that is homozygous for this high-affinity receptor mutation?\n\nA. The embryo's skin will consist almost entirely of undifferentiated ectoderm.\n\nB. The embryo's skin will show a normal pattern of Type S and Type R cells, identical to the wild type.\n\nC.

Let the local Dermin concentration be $C(\\mathbf{r}) \\ge 0$ across embryonic skin. The receptor–ligand occupancy (or an equivalent monotonic signaling proxy) is given by\n$$\n\\theta(C;K_{D})=\\frac{C}{C+K_{D}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{D}$ is the dissociation constant. A gain-of-function, high-affinity receptor mutation reduces the dissociation constant to $K_{D}'$ with $K_{D}'<K_{D}$, without changing receptor abundance or localization, and the morphogen gradient $C(\\mathbf{r})$ is unchanged.\n\nAssume that cell fates are determined by thresholds in the signaling output (equivalently, receptor occupancy):\n- Type R (ridged scutes) if $\\theta \\ge \\theta_{R}$,\n- Type S (smooth scales) if $\\theta_{S} \\le \\theta < \\theta_{R}$,\n- Undifferentiated if $\\theta < \\theta_{S}$,\nwith $0<\\theta_{S}<\\theta_{R}\\le 1$.\n\nFor a given threshold $\\hat{\\theta}\\in(0,1)$, the corresponding required ligand concentration is obtained by inverting $\\theta(C;K_{D})$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}=\\frac{C_{\\hat{\\theta}}}{C_{\\hat{\\theta}}+K_{D}}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nC_{\\hat{\\theta}}=K_{D}\\,\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}}{1-\\hat{\\theta}}.\n$$\nThus, in wild type, the concentration thresholds are\n$$\nT_{S}=K_{D}\\,\\frac{\\theta_{S}}{1-\\theta_{S}},\\qquad\nT_{R}=K_{D}\\,\\frac{\\theta_{R}}{1-\\theta_{R}}.\n$$\nIn the mutant with higher affinity $K_{D}'<K_{D}$, the thresholds scale proportionally:\n$$\nT_{S}'=K_{D}'\\,\\frac{\\theta_{S}}{1-\\theta_{S}}=\\alpha\\,T_{S},\\qquad\nT_{R}'=K_{D}'\\,\\frac{\\theta_{R}}{1-\\theta_{R}}=\\alpha\\,T_{R},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha=K_{D}'/K_{D}$ and $0<\\alpha<1$.\n\nSince $C(\\mathbf{r})$ is unchanged and $T_{R}'=\\alpha T_{R}<T_{R}$, the spatial region satisfying $C(\\mathbf{r})\\ge T_{R}'$ strictly contains the wild-type region $C(\\mathbf{r})\\ge T_{R}$. Therefore, the domain adopting the high-concentration fate (Type R) expands. Similarly, because $T_{S}'=\\alpha T_{S}<T_{S}$, the undifferentiated domain $C(\\mathbf{r})<T_{S}'$ shrinks. The Type S band, defined by $T_{S}'\\le C(\\mathbf{r})<T_{R}'$, also shrinks because both bounds move downward, while the upper bound decreases more consequentially for assigning cells to Type R rather than Type S across the gradient.\n\nConsequently, with higher receptor affinity, more cells experience an effective signaling level above the Type R threshold, shifting the fate map toward Type R and away from Type S and undifferentiated ectoderm. In the limit of substantially increased affinity (small $\\alpha$), almost the entire competent field with nonzero $C(\\mathbf{r})$ crosses the Type R threshold, yielding predominantly ridged scutes, with very few smooth scales and minimal undifferentiated ectoderm where $C(\\mathbf{r})$ is truly negligible or zero.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is skin consisting almost entirely of ridged scutes (Type R), with very few or no smooth scales (Type S).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1695262"}, {"introduction": "Developmental processes unfold over time, and so too do signaling interactions.
