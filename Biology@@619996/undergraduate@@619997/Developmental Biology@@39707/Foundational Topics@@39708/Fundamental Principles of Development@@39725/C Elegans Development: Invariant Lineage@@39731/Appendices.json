The development of every somatic cell in the adult worm can be traced back to one of six founder cells that are established early in embryogenesis. These founder cells are named AB, MS, E, C, D, and P4. Each of these blastomeres is fated to give rise to a specific set of tissues and organs.\n\nA developmental biologist is studying a mutant strain of *C. elegans*. Upon inspection of the newly hatched larvae, they observe a consistent and lethal phenotype: the worms are viable for a short period but completely lack an intestine. Further analysis reveals that other major structures, including the majority of the nervous system, the pharynx, body wall muscles, and the hypodermis (skin), are all present and appear structurally normal. The germline is also properly specified.\n\nBased on this specific defect, which one of the following founder cells most likely failed in its developmental program, leading to the observed phenotype?\n\nA.

Mapping these structures to founder cells:\n- Normal nervous system and hypodermis argue that AB functioned.\n- Normal pharynx and body wall muscle argue that MS and C (and D for muscle) functioned.\n- Proper germline argues that P4 functioned.\n- The specific and complete absence of intestine indicates failure of the E lineage, since E uniquely gives rise to the endodermal intestine in *C. elegans*.\n\nTherefore, the founder cell most likely to have failed in its developmental program is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1673671"}, {"introduction": "With hundreds of cells arising from a single zygote, how do biologists track each one?

A systematic nomenclature is used to identify each cell based on its ancestry.\n\nThe system begins with the zygote, named P0. When a cell divides, its daughters are named by appending a character to the parent cell's name. This appended character signifies the daughter cell's relative position after cytokinesis. The primary positional characters are:\n- 'a' for anterior\n- 'p' for posterior\n- 'r' for right\n- 'l' for left\n- 'd' for dorsal\n- 'v' for ventral\n\nFor example, the zygote (P0) first divides along the anterior-posterior axis to produce an anterior daughter cell named 'AB' and a posterior daughter cell named 'P1'. The 'P1' cell then divides again along the same axis to yield an anterior cell 'EMS' and a posterior cell 'P2'. The 'EMS' cell subsequently divides to produce an anterior cell 'MS' and a posterior cell 'E'. The 'MS' cell then divides to produce its own anterior daughter cell, 'MSa'.\n\nFollowing this established nomenclature, if the cell 'MSa' undergoes its next division along the anterior-posterior axis, what is the name of its posterior daughter cell?\n\nA.

Its next division is along the anterior-posterior axis. Therefore:\n- The anterior daughter will be named by appending 'a' to `MSa`, yielding `MSaa`.\n- The posterior daughter will be named by appending 'p' to `MSa`, yielding `MSap`.\n\nThe question asks for the name of the posterior daughter of `MSa`, which is `MSap`. Among the options:\n- A (`MSaa`) is the anterior daughter of `MSa`.\n- B (`MSp`) is not specific to `MSa`; it would imply posterior of `MS`, not of `MSa`.\n- C (`MSap`) matches the posterior daughter of `MSa`.\n- D (`EMa`) is from a different lineage.\n- E (`MSd`) refers to a dorsal division, not anterior-posterior.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1673672"}, {"introduction": "Development is a dynamic process where timing is everything.
