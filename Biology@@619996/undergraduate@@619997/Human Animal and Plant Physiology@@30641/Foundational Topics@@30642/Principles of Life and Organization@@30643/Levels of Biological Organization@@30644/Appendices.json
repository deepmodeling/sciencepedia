The bundle is known to contain two distinct populations of myelinated axons: fast-conducting A-fibers and slow-conducting C-fibers. A single electrical stimulus is applied at one end of the isolated nerve bundle, and the resulting compound action potential is measured by a recording electrode placed at a distance $L$ from the stimulus point.\n\nThe conduction velocity of the A-fibers is $v_A = 85.0$ m/s, and that of the C-fibers is $v_C = 1.50$ m/s. The duration of the action potential passing the electrode is determined by the repolarization phase. For this nerve, the repolarization can be modeled as the discharge of the membrane's capacitance. The duration of the recorded signal for a single action potential is defined as being equal to 3 times the membrane's repolarization time constant.\n\nA novel neurotoxin, Achronotoxin, is introduced, which completely and specifically blocks all voltage-gated potassium channels, leaving only the passive leak channels to facilitate repolarization. The membrane capacitance per unit area, $C_m$, is $1.00 \\times 10^{-2}$ F/m². The effective membrane resistance per unit area due to leak channels alone, $R_{\\text{leak}}$, is $6.00$ Ω·m².\n\nFor the two signals to be distinguished (or \"resolved\") at the recording electrode, the arrival of the peak of the C-fiber signal must occur after the entire signal from the A-fiber has passed the electrode.\n\nCalculate the minimum length $L_{min}$ of the nerve bundle segment, in meters, for the two signals to be resolvable after the application of the Achronotoxin.
