The length and complexity of the gut are finely tuned to the animal's diet, creating a trade-off between the speed of digestion and the efficiency of nutrient extraction.

For a plant stem, resisting forces like gravity and wind is an engineering problem solved through evolution. This thought experiment invites you to analyze two distinct biological \"designs\"—the scattered vascular bundles of monocots versus the ringed arrangement in dicots—and apply principles of structural mechanics to understand why one configuration is more efficient at resisting bending forces [@problem_id:1746233].", "problem": "In terrestrial plants, the stem provides mechanical support against gravity and environmental forces like wind, while also housing the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) responsible for transport. The arrangement of these vascular bundles differs significantly between major plant groups. In most dicotyledonous (dicot) plants, the vascular bundles are arranged in a distinct ring separating the outer cortex from the central pith. In contrast, most monocotyledonous (monocot) plants feature vascular bundles scattered throughout the stem's ground tissue.\n\nConsidering principles of structural mechanics, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary functional advantage of the dicot's ringed vascular bundle arrangement for providing support?\n\nA. The ringed arrangement concentrates rigid, supportive tissue away from the stem's central axis, creating a structure that is highly efficient at resisting bending forces for a given mass of tissue.\n\nB. The ringed structure allows for a more extensive central pith, which acts as the primary load-bearing column, making the stem more resistant to compression.\n\nC. The continuous ring of vascular tissue provides uniform support against torsional (twisting) forces, a feature that is absent in the scattered arrangement of monocot stems.\n\nD. By confining vascular bundles to a ring, the plant can develop a very thick, supportive outer bark, which is the principal source of mechanical strength in dicot stems.\n\nE. The arrangement of vascular bundles in a ring minimizes the total cross-sectional area dedicated to vascular tissue, allowing more mass to be allocated to flexible parenchyma tissue for shock absorption.", "solution": "We identify the relevant structural mechanics principle for stems subjected primarily to bending from self-weight and wind: the bending moment-curvature relation\n$$\nM = E I \\kappa,\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young’s modulus of the material carrying bending stress, $I$ is the second moment of area of the load-bearing material about the neutral axis, and $\\kappa$ is curvature. For a composite cross-section with stiff supportive tissue (lignified xylem fibers, sclerenchyma) embedded in compliant parenchyma, the effective bending stiffness is\n$$\nE I \\approx \\int_{A} E(\\mathbf{x})\\, y^{2}\\, dA,\n$$\nwhere $y$ is the distance to the neutral axis and $E(\\mathbf{x})$ varies strongly between supportive tissue (large $E$) and parenchyma (small $E$).\n\nLet $A_{s}$ denote the cross-sectional area of the stiff supportive tissue with modulus $E_{s}$, and let the parenchyma modulus be much smaller so that its contribution to $E I$ is comparatively negligible. Then\n$$\nE I \\approx E_{s} \\int_{A_{s}} y^{2}\\, dA = E_{s} A_{s} \\,\\overline{y^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $\\overline{y^{2}}$ is the area-average of $y^{2}$ over the supportive tissue region. Because $0 \\leq |y| \\leq R$, where $R$ is the stem’s outer radius, the average $\\overline{y^{2}}$ is maximized when all supportive area lies as far from the neutral axis as possible, i.e., at $|y| = R$. Therefore, for a fixed amount of supportive material $A_{s}$ and fixed stem radius $R$,\n$$\n(EI)_{\\max} = E_{s} A_{s} R^{2},\n$$\nachieved by concentrating supportive tissues in a peripheral ring. Any distribution that places some supportive tissue at smaller radii reduces $\\overline{y^{2}}$ and hence $E I$, making the structure less efficient at resisting bending for the same mass of supportive tissue.\n\nCorrespondingly, the maximum bending stress under a given bending moment $M$ is\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{M R}{I},\n$$\nso increasing $I$ by shifting stiff material outward lowers $\\sigma_{\\max}$ for the same $M$, further demonstrating the mechanical advantage of a peripheral (ring) arrangement.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A states that the ringed arrangement concentrates rigid, supportive tissue away from the central axis, which maximizes $I$ (and thus $E I$) per unit supportive mass, making the stem highly efficient at resisting bending. This directly follows from $I = \\int y^{2} dA$ and is correct.\n- B claims the central pith is the primary load-bearing column in compression. In plants, the pith is relatively low in $E$ and not the main source of mechanical strength; global stability against buckling is governed by $E I$, which is increased by peripheral stiff tissue, not by a larger pith.\n- C invokes torsional uniformity. Torsional rigidity is characterized by $G J$, where $J$ is the polar moment or torsion constant. While a closed thin-walled ring can enhance $J$, the primary and well-established advantage of dicot ringed arrangement is improved bending resistance; dicot stems at early stages have discrete bundles around the periphery rather than a perfectly closed tube, and bending loads dominate ecological demands.\n- D attributes principal strength to outer bark. Bark is primarily protective; the main mechanical strength in dicots comes from lignified xylem (wood), not bark.\n- E suggests the ring minimizes vascular area to allocate mass to parenchyma for shock absorption. This does not follow mechanical efficiency principles; maximizing $I$ per supportive area, not minimizing vascular area, provides support efficiency.\n\nThus, based on $M = E I \\kappa$, $I = \\int y^{2} dA$, and the strategy of maximizing $I$ by placing stiff tissue at large radius, the correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1746233"}, {"introduction": "The intricate relationship between structure and function extends all the way down to the molecular level, where individual proteins act as sophisticated biological machines. The giant protein titin, a key component of muscle fibers, functions as a tunable molecular spring, and its remarkable properties arise from its modular domain architecture. This problem will guide you through a simplified biophysical model of titin, challenging you to calculate the force it generates and appreciate how its multi-part structure gives rise to complex, non-linear elasticity in muscle tissue [@problem_id:1746225].", "problem": "The giant protein titin is a key determinant of passive elasticity in vertebrate striated muscle.

For this problem, we will model a single titin molecule as a simplified two-component system connected in series: a compliant, unstructured segment known as the PEVK region (rich in proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine), and a chain of tandem Immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains.\n\nThe PEVK segment's elastic behavior can be described by the following force-extension relationship:\n$$F = K_{\\text{PEVK}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $F$ is the force, $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}}$ is the extension of the PEVK segment from its resting length, $K_{\\text{PEVK}}$ is a stiffness constant, and $L_c$ is a characteristic length scale of the polymer.\n\nThe Ig domains are folded protein modules that behave rigidly until a characteristic unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}}$, is reached. At this force, the domains begin to unfold one by one. This unfolding process occurs at a nearly constant force, meaning that as the molecule is stretched further, the force remains at $F_{\\text{unfold}}$ while successive Ig domains unravel.\n\nConsider a single titin molecule in a half-sarcomere under passive stretch.

The titin molecule is modeled as two components in series: the PEVK segment and a chain of Ig domains. In a series arrangement, the total extension is the sum of the extensions of the individual components, and the force is the same throughout the entire system.\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{PEVK}} = F_{\\text{Ig}}$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}} + \\Delta L_{\\text{Ig}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta L_{\\text{Ig}}$ is the extension due to the unfolding of Ig domains.\n\nThe key feature of the model is the behavior of the Ig domains. They do not contribute to the extension (i.e., $\\Delta L_{\\text{Ig}} = 0$) until the force in the molecule reaches the unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}}$. Below this force, all extension is accommodated by the PEVK segment. Once the force reaches $F_{\\text{unfold}}$, the Ig domains begin to unfold, and the force remains \"clamped\" at this value as long as there are domains available to unfold.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to determine the state of the system at the given total extension. We need to find out whether the force has reached $F_{\\text{unfold}}$ or not. We can do this by calculating the maximum possible extension of the PEVK segment alone, which occurs at the precise moment the force reaches $F_{\\text{unfold}}$. Let's call this maximum PEVK extension $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}$.\n\nWe use the given force-extension relation for the PEVK segment:\n$$F = K_{\\text{PEVK}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nSetting $F = F_{\\text{unfold}}$ and $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}} = \\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}$, we can solve for $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{unfold}} = K_{\\text{PEVK}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1$$\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c}\\right) = \\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} + 1$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} + 1\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = L_c \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} + 1\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $F_{\\text{unfold}} = 28.0 \\text{ pN}$, $K_{\\text{PEVK}} = 5.00 \\text{ pN}$, and $L_c = 40.0 \\text{ nm}$.\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = (40.0 \\text{ nm}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{28.0 \\text{ pN}}{5.00 \\text{ pN}} + 1\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = (40.0 \\text{ nm}) \\ln(5.60 + 1)$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = (40.0 \\text{ nm}) \\ln(6.60)$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(6.60) \\approx 1.887$:\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} \\approx 40.0 \\times 1.887 \\text{ nm} \\approx 75.48 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nNow we compare this threshold extension with the given total extension, $\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} = 250 \\text{ nm}$.\nWe see that $\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} (250 \\text{ nm}) > \\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} (75.48 \\text{ nm})$.\n\nThis comparison tells us that the total required extension is greater than what can be provided by the PEVK segment alone before reaching the Ig domain unfolding force. Therefore, the system must be in the regime where the Ig domains are unfolding to accommodate the additional stretch.\n\nAccording to the problem description, when Ig domains are unfolding, the force throughout the molecule is maintained at the constant unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}}$. The total extension of $250 \\text{ nm}$ is accommodated by the PEVK segment stretching to $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = 75.48 \\text{ nm}$ and the remaining extension, $250 \\text{ nm} - 75.48 \\text{ nm} = 174.52 \\text{ nm}$, is accommodated by the unfolding of several Ig domains. Regardless of how many domains unfold (as long as there are enough), the force is clamped.\n\nThus, the force in the titin molecule is:\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{unfold}} = 28.0 \\text{ pN}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = 28 \\text{ pN}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28}$$", "id": "1746225"}]}
