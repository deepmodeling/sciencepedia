This first practice applies the famous Kleiber's Law ($MR \\propto M^{0.75}$) to a fundamental question of survival: how much must an animal eat? By comparing the relative food intake of a small rodent and a much larger mammal, you will uncover the quantitative reason why smaller animals have such seemingly voracious appetites [@problem_id:1691651].", "problem": "The relationship between an animal's basal metabolic rate ($B$) and its body mass ($M$) can be described by the allometric scaling law, often referred to as Kleiber's Law, which states that $B$ is proportional to $M^{0.75}$. To maintain its body mass, an animal's daily energy intake from food must balance its total energy expenditure, which is directly proportional to its basal metabolic rate. Assume that the energy content per unit mass of food is constant across different food sources.\n\nConsider two mammals: a small rodent with a body mass $m_1 = 30.0 \\text{ g}$ and a significantly larger rodent, a capybara, with a body mass $m_2 = 60.0 \\text{ kg}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the required daily food intake *as a fraction of body mass* for the small rodent compared to that of the capybara.

This exercise explores how swimming speed scales with body length in fish, based on hydrodynamic principles [@problem_id:1691636]. You will calculate both absolute speed and relative speed, revealing the important and often counter-intuitive distinction between being fast in meters per second versus body lengths per second.", "problem": "The maximum burst swimming speed ($v$) of many fish species can be modeled by an allometric scaling law of the form $v = cL^{a}$, where $L$ is the body length of the fish, $c$ is a proportionality constant that depends on factors like body shape and water temperature, and $a$ is a scaling exponent. For a wide range of similarly shaped fish, hydrodynamic principles suggest a scaling exponent of $a = 2/3$.\n\nConsider two related species: the Dwarf River Runner and the Giant Lake Cruiser. Assume they share a similar body plan and thus can be described by the same constant $c$. An adult Giant Lake Cruiser has an average body length that is exactly 8 times the average body length of an adult Dwarf River Runner.\n\nWe can analyze their performance in two ways: by their absolute speed (measured in units like m/s) and by their relative speed, which is their speed measured in body lengths per second ($v_{rel} = v/L$).\n\nYou are asked to calculate two dimensionless ratios:\n1.  The ratio of the maximum absolute speed of the Giant Lake Cruiser to that of the Dwarf River Runner.\n2.

So, the equation becomes:\n$$v = cL^{2/3}$$\n\nWe are also given the relationship between the body lengths of the two species:\n$$L_G = 8 L_D$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the maximum absolute speeds, which we'll call $R_{abs}$.\n$$R_{abs} = \\frac{v_G}{v_D}$$\nUsing the scaling law for each fish:\n$$v_G = cL_G^{2/3}$$\n$$v_D = cL_D^{2/3}$$\nSubstituting these into the ratio, the constant $c$ cancels out:\n$$R_{abs} = \\frac{cL_G^{2/3}}{cL_D^{2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{L_G}{L_D}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nWe know that $\\frac{L_G}{L_D} = 8$. Substituting this value:\n$$R_{abs} = (8)^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^{(3 \\times 2/3)} = 2^2 = 4$$\nSo, the Giant Lake Cruiser is 4 times faster than the Dwarf River Runner in absolute terms.\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of the maximum relative speeds, which we'll call $R_{rel}$.

Now we can find the ratio $R_{rel}$:\n$$R_{rel} = \\frac{(v_{rel})_G}{(v_{rel})_D}$$\nUsing the new scaling law for each fish:\n$$(v_{rel})_G = cL_G^{-1/3}$$\n$$(v_{rel})_D = cL_D^{-1/3}$$\nSubstituting these into the ratio:\n$$R_{rel} = \\frac{cL_G^{-1/3}}{cL_D^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{L_G}{L_D}\\right)^{-1/3}$$\nAgain, we substitute $\\frac{L_G}{L_D} = 8$:\n$$R_{rel} = (8)^{-1/3} = (2^3)^{-1/3} = 2^{(3 \\times -1/3)} = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSo, the Giant Lake Cruiser's relative speed is half that of the Dwarf River Runner.\n\nThe two ratios are $R_{abs} = 4$ and $R_{rel} = \\frac{1}{2}$.
