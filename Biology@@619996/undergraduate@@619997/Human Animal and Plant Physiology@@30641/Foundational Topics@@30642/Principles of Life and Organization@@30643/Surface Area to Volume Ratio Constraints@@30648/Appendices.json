By working through this exercise, you will derive a quantitative relationship that reveals why cell size is fundamentally limited.", "problem": "A hypothetical, perfectly spherical biological cell is suspended in a stable environment. To maintain its physiological functions, it must keep the internal concentration of a specific ion constant. This is challenging because the ion continuously leaks out of the cell through its membrane. The leakage rate is uniform across the entire surface. To counteract this diffusive loss, the cell's membrane is equipped with a large number of ion pumps that actively transport the ion back into the cytoplasm.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The cell is a perfect sphere with a radius $r$.\n- The leakage of ions out of the cell occurs at a constant flux $L$, defined as ions per unit area per unit time.\n- Each individual ion pump actively transports ions into the cell at a constant rate $P$, defined as ions per pump per unit time.\n- To maintain a stable internal ion concentration, the total rate of ions being pumped into the cell must exactly balance the total rate of ions leaking out.\n\nDerive an expression for $N(r)$, the total number of ion pumps required on the cell's membrane as a function of its radius $r$. Your answer should be an expression in terms of $r$, $L$, and $P$.", "solution": "At steady state, the internal ion concentration remains constant, which implies that the total rate of ions entering the cell equals the total rate of ions leaving the cell.\n\nThe cell is a sphere of radius $r$, so its surface area is\n$$\nA = 4 \\pi r^{2}.\n$$\nThe leakage flux is uniform and equal to $L$ (ions per unit area per unit time). Therefore, the total outward leakage rate is the flux times the area:\n$$\nR_{\\text{out}} = L \\cdot A = L \\cdot 4 \\pi r^{2} = 4 \\pi r^{2} L.\n$$\nEach pump transports ions into the cell at a rate $P$ (ions per pump per unit time).
