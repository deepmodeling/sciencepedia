For a cell to permanently expand, its wall must undergo irreversible, or plastic, deformation, a process driven by turgor pressure exceeding a specific threshold. This exercise uses a mathematical model to distinguish between reversible elastic stretching and the permanent plastic expansion that constitutes growth, offering insight into the biophysical basis of morphogenesis [@problem_id:1706112].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model for the growth of a single, isolated plant cell, which is used to understand the mechanics of the cell wall. The cell is initially in a state of no internal pressure, with a volume of $V_0$. The cell wall behaves as a material with both elastic and plastic properties.\n\nThe cell's response to internal turgor pressure, $P$, is described by two principles:\n1.  **Elastic Expansion**: When subjected to pressure $P$, the cell wall stretches elastically. This is a reversible process. The elastic fractional increase in volume is given by $\\frac{\\Delta V_{elastic}}{V_{rest}} = \\frac{P}{\\epsilon}$, where $V_{rest}$ is the corresponding pressure-free (rest) volume and $\\epsilon$ is the volumetric elastic modulus. The total volume of the cell under pressure is thus $V = V_{rest} + \\Delta V_{elastic}$.\n2.  **Plastic Growth**: Irreversible expansion, or growth, occurs only when the turgor pressure $P$ exceeds a certain yield threshold, $Y$. For $P > Y$, the relative rate of volume increase of the pressurized cell is governed by the equation: $\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\phi(P-Y)$, where $V$ is the total instantaneous volume of the cell under pressure and $\\phi$ is the wall extensibility, a constant that measures how easily the wall deforms permanently.\n\nAn experiment is conducted. The turgor pressure inside the cell is rapidly increased from zero to a constant value $P_{app}$ (where $P_{app} > Y$) and held at this level for a duration of $T$. After this duration, the turgor pressure is rapidly returned to zero, and the cell is allowed to relax to its final, stable volume.\n\nDetermine the final volume, $V_f$, of the cell after the pressure is released. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the given parameters: $V_0$, $P_{app}$, $Y$, $\\phi$, $\\epsilon$, and $T$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the final stable volume of the plant cell after it has been subjected to a high turgor pressure for a time $T$ and then relaxed. We can solve this by analyzing the process in three distinct steps: the initial elastic expansion when pressure is applied, the subsequent plastic growth under constant pressure, and the final elastic contraction when the pressure is released.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Elastic Expansion**\n\nThe cell starts at a rest volume $V_0$ with zero pressure. At time $t=0$, the pressure is rapidly increased to $P_{app}$. This causes an instantaneous elastic expansion. According to the elastic expansion rule, the change in volume is $\\Delta V_{elastic} = V_{rest} \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}$. In this initial step, the rest volume is $V_0$.\nSo, the volume of the cell immediately after the pressure is applied, which we'll call $V(0)$, is:\n$$V(0) = V_0 + \\Delta V_{elastic} = V_0 + V_0 \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon} = V_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nThis volume $V(0)$ is the initial condition for the plastic growth phase.\n\n**Step 2: Plastic Growth under Constant Pressure**\n\nFor the time interval $0 < t \\leq T$, the turgor pressure is held constant at $P_{app}$, which is greater than the yield threshold $Y$. Therefore, the cell undergoes plastic growth. The growth is governed by the differential equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\phi(P_{app}-Y)$$\nSince $P_{app}$, $Y$, and $\\phi$ are constants, the right side of the equation is a constant. Let's call this constant $k = \\phi(P_{app}-Y)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dV}{V} = k \\, dt$$\nWe need to solve this differential equation to find the cell's volume at time $T$, which we'll call $V(T)$. We integrate both sides, with the volume going from $V(0)$ to $V(T)$ as time goes from $0$ to $T$:\n$$\\int_{V(0)}^{V(T)} \\frac{dV}{V} = \\int_{0}^{T} k \\, dt$$\n$$\\ln(V) \\Big|_{V(0)}^{V(T)} = kt \\Big|_{0}^{T}$$\n$$\\ln(V(T)) - \\ln(V(0)) = k(T-0)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{V(T)}{V(0)}\\right) = kT$$\nSolving for $V(T)$ gives:\n$$V(T) = V(0) \\exp(kT)$$\nSubstituting back $k = \\phi(P_{app}-Y)$ and the expression for $V(0)$ from Step 1:\n$$V(T) = V_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\phi(P_{app}-Y)T\\right)$$\nThis is the total volume of the cell at time $T$, while still under pressure $P_{app}$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Elastic Relaxation**\n\nAt time $T$, the pressure $P_{app}$ is rapidly removed. The cell wall's elastic deformation is recovered, meaning the cell volume contracts. The final volume, $V_f$, is the new \"rest\" volume of the cell. The volume $V(T)$ was the elastically stretched state corresponding to the rest volume $V_f$ under pressure $P_{app}$. We can use the elastic expansion rule again:\n$$V_{stretched} = V_{rest} \\left(1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nIn our case, $V_{stretched} = V(T)$ and the new rest volume is $V_f$. So:\n$$V(T) = V_f \\left(1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nWe can solve for the final volume $V_f$:\n$$V_f = \\frac{V(T)}{1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}}$$\n\n**Step 4: Final Expression**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $V(T)$ from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:\n$$V_f = \\frac{V_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\phi(P_{app}-Y)T\\right)}{1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}}$$\nThe term $\\left(1 + \\frac{P_{app}}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This yields the final expression for the final volume $V_f$:\n$$V_f = V_0 \\exp\\left(\\phi(P_{app}-Y)T\\right)$$\nThis result shows that the final, permanent volume of the cell depends on the initial volume and the parameters governing plastic growth ($\\phi$, $Y$, $P_{app}$, $T$), but not on the elastic modulus $\\epsilon$. The elastic expansion is a transient effect that does not contribute to the final permanent size of the cell in this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{V_0 \\exp(\\phi(P_{app}-Y)T)}$$", "id": "1706112"}]}
