A research team is developing two experimental drugs, Farnesinib and Geranostat, intended to inhibit a specific Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) that is implicated in unregulated cell growth. The binding interaction of each drug with the RTK is characterized by the dissociation constant, $K_d$. The dissociation constant is defined as the equilibrium concentration of the drug at which 50% of the RTK molecules are bound by the drug.\n\nAfter conducting binding assays, the team obtains the following data:\n- The dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the Farnesinib-RTK complex is $4.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ M.\n- The dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the Geranostat-RTK complex is $8.0 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nBased solely on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between these two drugs and the target RTK?\n\nA. Farnesinib has a lower affinity for the RTK, meaning a higher concentration is needed to bind to the target compared to Geranostat.\n\nB. Geranostat has a higher affinity for the RTK than Farnesinib.\n\nC. Farnesinib has a higher affinity for the RTK than Geranostat.\n\nD. Both drugs have the same binding affinity for the RTK, and the difference in $K_d$ values is likely due to experimental noise.\n\nE. It is impossible to compare the affinities without also knowing the association rate constants ($k_{on}$) for each drug.", "solution": "For a ligand (drug) $L$ binding to a receptor $R$ to form a complex $LR$, the equilibrium is\n$$\nL + R \\rightleftharpoons LR.\n$$\nThe dissociation constant is defined by\n$$\nK_{d} \\equiv \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}},\n$$\nand the fractional occupancy at equilibrium is\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}.\n$$\nFor any fixed $[L] > 0$, $\\theta$ is a strictly decreasing function of $K_{d}$; that is, if $K_{d,1} < K_{d,2}$, then\n$$\n\\frac{[L]}{K_{d,1} + [L]} > \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,2} + [L]},\n$$\nso a smaller $K_{d}$ implies higher affinity (greater occupancy at the same concentration).

Option A is false (it reverses the relationship); option B is false (Geranostat has the higher $K_{d}$ and thus lower affinity); option D is inconsistent with the large difference in $K_{d}$; option E is false because $K_{d}$ fully specifies equilibrium affinity via $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$, so comparing $K_{d}$ suffices to compare affinities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2331730"}, {"introduction": "Beyond initial binding, the duration and intensity of a cellular signal are tightly regulated to ensure an appropriate response. This practice problem shifts our focus from the static concept of affinity to the dynamics of signal termination, using the well-known second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a model.

The pathway is initiated by a brief pulse of a hormone, which leads to a rapid increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) to an initial peak value, $[cAMP]_0$. After this initial pulse, the hormone is removed, and the cAMP concentration begins to decrease as it is degraded into Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE).\n\nThe degradation process can be modeled as a first-order decay, where the rate of decrease of cAMP is directly proportional to its current concentration. A cellular response is maintained as long as the cAMP concentration, $[cAMP](t)$, remains above a critical threshold, $[cAMP]_{thresh}$. For this particular cell type, the initial peak concentration is a factor of $N$ times the threshold concentration, i.e., $[cAMP]_0 = N \\cdot [cAMP]_{thresh}$, where $N>1$.\n\nThe team then introduces a novel pharmacological compound that acts as an inhibitor of PDE. In the presence of this compound, the effective catalytic rate of PDE is reduced to a fraction $f$ of its original rate, where $0 < f < 1$.

This modification completely and irreversibly inhibits the intrinsic Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the Gαs subunit, without affecting its ability to bind to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) or its downstream effector.
