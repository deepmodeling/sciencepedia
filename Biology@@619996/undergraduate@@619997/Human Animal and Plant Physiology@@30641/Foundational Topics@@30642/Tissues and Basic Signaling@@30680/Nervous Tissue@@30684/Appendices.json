This first practice provides a direct, hands-on look at this fundamental process of neural integration, known as summation.

For an action potential to be initiated at its axon hillock, the membrane potential must be depolarized to a threshold value of $-55$ mV. This neuron simultaneously receives two inputs: one signal generates an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) of $+20$ mV, and another signal generates an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) of $-10$ mV. Assuming these potentials sum algebraically at the axon hillock, determine the resulting state of the neuron.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the outcome?\n\nA.

This process is known as summation.\n\nFirst, we identify the initial state of the neuron, which is its resting membrane potential.\nResting potential = $-70$ mV\n\nNext, we identify the inputs the neuron receives. It receives one Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) and one Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\nEPSP = $+20$ mV\nIPSP = $-10$ mV\n\nSince the potentials arrive simultaneously, they sum up at the axon hillock. We can calculate the final membrane potential by algebraically adding the values of the EPSP and IPSP to the resting potential.\n\nFinal potential = Resting potential + EPSP + IPSP\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\nFinal potential = $(-70 \\text{ mV}) + (+20 \\text{ mV}) + (-10 \\text{ mV})$\nFinal potential = $-70 \\text{ mV} + 20 \\text{ mV} - 10 \\text{ mV}$\nFinal potential = $-50 \\text{ mV} - 10 \\text{ mV}$\nFinal potential = $-60$ mV\n\nNow, we must compare this final membrane potential to the neuron's threshold potential to determine if an action potential will be generated.\nThreshold potential = $-55$ mV\nCalculated final potential = $-60$ mV\n\nFor an action potential to be initiated, the final membrane potential must reach or exceed the threshold potential. In this case, $-60$ mV is more negative than the threshold of $-55$ mV.

This exercise focuses on a common form of inhibition mediated by chloride ($Cl^{-}$) channels [@problem_id:1721713]. By comparing the neuron's resting potential to the equilibrium potential for chloride ($E_{Cl}$), you will practice calculating the ionic driving force to predict whether a neurotransmitter's effect will be inhibitory or excitatory, making the cell less or more likely to fire an action potential.", "problem": "Neuropharmacologists are developing a new synthetic compound, designated NG-Alpha, intended for the treatment of neurological disorders characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability. The compound is designed to mimic the action of the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), by binding to specific ligand-gated ion channels on the postsynaptic membrane of central nervous system neurons.\n\nIn the target neurons, the typical resting membrane potential ($V_{m}$) is maintained at $-65$ mV. The threshold potential required to initiate an action potential is $-55$ mV. Due to the specific intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations maintained by active transport, the Nernst equilibrium potential for chloride ions ($E_{Cl}$) in these neurons is calculated to be $-70$ mV.\n\nIf the compound NG-Alpha successfully binds to and opens these chloride channels when the neuron is at its resting state, what will be the immediate net effect on the postsynaptic membrane?\n\nA. The membrane will depolarize, resulting in an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP).\n\nB. The membrane will hyperpolarize, resulting in an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nC. The membrane potential will not change, because the resting potential is already equal to the chloride equilibrium potential.\n\nD. The membrane will depolarize, but the effect is classified as inhibitory due to a shunting effect.\n\nE. The membrane will hyperpolarize, but this will result in an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP).", "solution": "We are given the resting membrane potential $V_{m}=-65$ mV, threshold potential $-55$ mV, and chloride equilibrium potential $E_{Cl}=-70$ mV. The compound opens chloride channels at rest.\n\nPrinciple 1 (Ohmic current for an ionic conductance): For an ion with conductance $g_{ion}$ and equilibrium potential $E_{ion}$, the current is\n$$\nI_{ion}=g_{ion}\\left(V_{m}-E_{ion}\\right),\n$$\nwith $g_{ion}>0$. The sign of $I_{ion}$ is set by the driving force $V_{m}-E_{ion}$, and opening the channels drives $V_{m}$ toward $E_{ion}$.\n\nApplying to chloride:\n$$\nI_{Cl}=g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m}-E_{Cl}\\right),\\quad g_{Cl}>0.\n$$\nAt rest,\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{Cl}=(-65)-(-70)=+5\\ \\text{mV}>0,\n$$\nso $I_{Cl}>0$ (an outward current by the electrophysiological convention), which corresponds to an influx of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ (negative charge entering). This influx of negative charge makes $V_{m}$ more negative, i.e., it hyperpolarizes the membrane, moving $V_{m}$ toward $E_{Cl}$.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Steady-state with added conductance): If a new conductance $g_{Cl}$ with reversal $E_{Cl}$ is added to an existing membrane with leak conductance $g_{L}$ and reversal $E_{L}$, the new steady-state potential is\n$$\nV_{\\text{ss}}=\\frac{g_{L}E_{L}+g_{Cl}E_{Cl}}{g_{L}+g_{Cl}},\n$$\nwhich lies between $E_{L}$ (near $-65$ mV here) and $E_{Cl}=-70$ mV. Since $E_{Cl}<V_{m}$, $V_{\\text{ss}}<V_{m}$, confirming an immediate movement of $V_{m}$ to more negative values.\n\nClassification of postsynaptic potential: Because $V_{m}$ becomes more negative (hyperpolarizes) and thus moves farther from the threshold $-55$ mV, the effect is inhibitory, i.e., an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because the effect is not depolarizing.\n- B is correct: opening $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ channels at $V_{m}=-65$ mV with $E_{Cl}=-70$ mV hyperpolarizes and yields an IPSP.\n- C is incorrect because $V_{m}\\neq E_{Cl}$.\n- D is incorrect here: depolarization would require $E_{Cl}>V_{m}$; while $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ conductance can cause shunting inhibition, the immediate voltage change in this case is hyperpolarization, not depolarization.\n- E is incorrect because hyperpolarization is not excitatory.\n\nTherefore, the immediate net effect is hyperpolarization producing an IPSP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1721713"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate output of neuronal integration is the action potential, an all-or-none electrical signal. The precise shape of this signal is crucial for neural coding and is determined by the orchestrated opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. This final practice explores the link between molecular properties and physiological function by examining a hypothetical mutation affecting potassium ($K^{+}$) channels [@problem_id:1721736]. You will analyze how slowing the closure of these channels alters the repolarization and afterhyperpolarization phases, deepening your understanding of how the action potential is generated and shaped.", "problem": "A hypothetical genetic disorder, termed Delayed Repolarization Syndrome (DRS), is characterized by a point mutation affecting the neuronal voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels. The standard function of these channels is to open in response to membrane depolarization, allowing $K^{+}$ ions to flow out of the cell and repolarize the membrane. In individuals with DRS, these channels function normally in terms of their activation threshold and opening speed, but they are significantly slower to close once they have opened. Assuming all other neuronal properties, such as resting membrane potential, ion concentrations, and sodium ($Na^{+}$) channel function, are normal, how would this specific molecular defect alter the shape of a single action potential?\n\nA. The repolarization phase will be prolonged, leading to a deeper and longer-lasting afterhyperpolarization.\n\nB. The repolarization phase will be shortened, and the membrane potential will return to resting potential more quickly, eliminating the afterhyperpolarization phase.\n\nC. The depolarization phase will be slower and reach a lower peak voltage, while the repolarization phase remains unaffected.\n\nD. Both the repolarization and afterhyperpolarization phases will be unaffected, but the neuron's resting membrane potential will become significantly more negative.\n\nE. The repolarization phase will be prolonged, but the afterhyperpolarization will be shallower and shorter than normal.", "solution": "An action potential can be described by the membrane equation\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt}=-I_{\\text{ion}}=-g_{Na}(t)\\left(V-E_{Na}\\right)-g_{K}(t)\\left(V-E_{K}\\right)-g_{L}\\left(V-E_{L}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{Na}(t)$ and $g_{K}(t)$ are the time-dependent sodium and potassium conductances, and $E_{Na}$, $E_{K}$, and $E_{L}$ are the reversal potentials. In the Hodgkin–Huxley formalism, $g_{K}(t)=\\bar{g}_{K}n^{4}(t)$ with $dn/dt=\\alpha_{n}(V)\\left(1-n\\right)-\\beta_{n}(V)n$. Normal repolarization arises because, after the peak of the action potential, $g_{Na}$ falls due to inactivation while $g_{K}$ remains elevated, producing an outward potassium current $I_{K}=g_{K}(t)\\left(V-E_{K}\\right)$ that drives $V$ toward $E_{K}$. Afterhyperpolarization occurs because $g_{K}$ remains above baseline even after $V$ crosses the resting potential, so $V$ is pulled transiently toward $E_{K}$, which is more negative than the resting potential.\n\nIn Delayed Repolarization Syndrome, the activation threshold and opening kinetics of the voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels are normal, but the channels are slow to close once opened. In gating terms, this corresponds to a reduced effective $\\beta_{n}(V)$ during repolarization or, equivalently, an increased deactivation time constant $\\tau_{n}=1/\\left(\\alpha_{n}+\\beta_{n}\\right)$, so that $g_{K}(t)$ decays more slowly after the peak. Substituting into the membrane equation, a more sustained $g_{K}(t)$ maintains a larger outward current $I_{K}$ for a longer time. Two consequences follow: first, the total conductance during the falling phase is elevated, which reduces the instantaneous membrane time constant $\\tau_{m}=C_{m}/\\left(g_{Na}+g_{K}+g_{L}\\right)$ and helps drive $V$ rapidly toward $E_{K}$; second, because $g_{K}(t)$ remains elevated for longer, the membrane potential is held closer to $E_{K}$ beyond the time it would normally return to rest, producing a deeper and longer-lasting afterhyperpolarization. The membrane only returns to resting potential as $g_{K}(t)$ deactivates toward its baseline, which is delayed by the mutation.\n\nTherefore, although the early downstroke slope may be steep, the repolarization phase, considered as the return from the peak back to resting potential, is prolonged due to the extended period of elevated $g_{K}$. The afterhyperpolarization is both deeper (closer to $E_{K}$) and longer-lasting because the outward potassium current persists. Depolarization is unaffected because $Na^{+}$ channel function and $K^{+}$ activation onset are normal, and the resting potential is unchanged because it is determined by baseline leak and resting conductances when channels are closed.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the repolarization phase is prolonged with a deeper and longer-lasting afterhyperpolarization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1721736"}]}
