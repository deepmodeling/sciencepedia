By analyzing their distinct strategies for maintaining water balance, you will grasp the fundamental challenge of managing osmotic pressure and appreciate the evolution of specialized cellular machinery like the contractile vacuole.", "problem": "An introductory biology class is studying osmoregulation in single-celled eukaryotes. They are comparing a freshwater species, *Amoeba proteus*, which lives in a hypotonic pond environment, with a marine species, *Haliphysema* (a foraminiferan amoeboid), which lives in an isotonic ocean environment. The cytoplasm of both species has a solute concentration significantly higher than that of fresh water but is approximately equal in solute concentration to seawater. Which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the primary homeostatic strategies these two organisms employ to maintain water balance?\n\nA. The marine amoeboid's cell membrane is exceptionally rigid and impermeable to water, preventing water loss. In contrast, the freshwater amoeba's membrane is highly permeable, and it relies on a thick cell wall to resist bursting from water influx.\n\nB. The marine amoeboid utilizes its contractile vacuole to actively expel excess salt ions absorbed from the seawater. The freshwater amoeba uses the same organelle to actively absorb essential minerals from its dilute environment.\n\nC. Both organisms rely on the same primary mechanism: they actively pump individual water molecules across their cell membranes using specialized protein pumps. The direction of pumping is simply reversed depending on the external environment.\n\nD. The freshwater amoeba possesses an energy-dependent contractile vacuole system that continually collects and expels excess water that enters the cell via osmosis. The marine amoeboid, living in an osmotically stable environment, has a greatly reduced or absent contractile vacuole system.\n\nE. The freshwater amoeba maintains an internal solute concentration that is nearly identical to the surrounding fresh water, thus preventing any net movement of water. The marine amoeboid maintains an extremely high internal solute concentration to actively draw water in from the ocean.", "solution": "Water movement across a semipermeable membrane is governed by osmosis: water moves from lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration, equivalently down its chemical potential gradient. A useful formal statement is that the osmotic pressure of a solution is given by the van't Hoff relation $\\Pi = i C R T$, where $i$ is the van't Hoff factor, $C$ is solute concentration, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is absolute temperature. The driving force for water entry into a cell immersed in an external solution is proportional to the difference in osmotic pressure across the membrane.\n\nFor a freshwater amoeba, the cytoplasmic solute concentration satisfies $C_{\\text{in}} \\gg C_{\\text{fresh}}$, so the osmotic pressure difference\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = i R T \\left(C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{fresh}}\\right) > 0\n$$\ndrives continuous water influx into the cell by osmosis. Amoebae lack a rigid cell wall, so to prevent swelling and lysis, freshwater amoebae use an energy-dependent contractile vacuole system that collects excess cytosolic water and periodically expels it to the environment. This process requires metabolic energy (ATP) and cytoskeletal machinery; it is not primarily an ion-excretion mechanism.\n\nFor a marine amoeboid living in seawater, the cytoplasmic solute concentration is approximately isotonic with the environment, $C_{\\text{in}} \\approx C_{\\text{sea}}$, so\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi \\approx i R T \\left(C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{sea}}\\right) \\approx 0,\n$$\nand there is little net water flux. Consequently, a robust contractile vacuole system is unnecessary and is often reduced or absent in isotonic marine protists; their homeostatic focus is on maintaining ion balance rather than expelling large volumes of water.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because amoebae do not possess thick cell walls, and biological membranes are not impermeable to water; water crosses via the lipid bilayer and aquaporins.\n- B is incorrect because contractile vacuoles primarily expel excess water, not salt; ion homeostasis is managed by specific transporters and channels, not the contractile vacuole. Freshwater amoebae do not use the vacuole to absorb minerals.\n- C is incorrect because cells generally do not use ATP-driven pumps to directly transport individual water molecules; water movement is passive via osmosis.\n- D correctly states that freshwater amoebae use an energy-dependent contractile vacuole to expel osmotically gained water, whereas marine amoeboids in isotonic conditions have reduced or absent contractile vacuoles.\n- E is incorrect because freshwater amoebae maintain an internal solute concentration higher than fresh water (not equal), and marine amoeboids are approximately isotonic with seawater, not extremely hypertonic.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is given by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1711292"}, {"introduction": "This problem scales up the concept of water balance to the organ system level, focusing on the crucial role of hormonal control in human physiology. You will examine how Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) regulates water reabsorption in the kidneys to maintain bodily fluid homeostasis [@problem_id:1711297]. By calculating the consequences of a medication that blocks ADH function, you will quantitatively appreciate the power of this endocrine feedback loop in preventing dehydration or overhydration.", "problem": "An individual's kidneys are functioning with a Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 180 L/day.

This pharmacological intervention renders the collecting ducts completely impermeable to water. Consequently, the final excreted urine has the same osmolality as the tubular fluid entering the collecting duct, which is measured to be 110 mOsm/L.\n\nAssuming the daily solute load that must be excreted remains constant, calculate the resulting increase in the total daily urine output due to the medication.
