This extremophile thrives in an environment with unusually high concentrations of magnesium ions. To maintain its internal ionic balance, the cell utilizes a specialized membrane transport protein. Through experimental analysis, the researchers have determined that this protein couples the transport of three sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) out of the cell to the transport of one magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$) into the cell. This process is driven by the electrochemical gradient of sodium, which is maintained by a separate primary active transporter.\n\nBased on this mechanism, which of the following statements correctly classifies this specific $Na^{+}/Mg^{2+}$ transporter?\n\nA. It is a symporter and is electrogenic.\nB. It is a symporter and is electroneutral.\nC. It is an antiporter and is electrogenic.\nD. It is an antiporter and is electroneutral.\nE. It is neither a symporter nor an antiporter, as it is a primary active transporter.", "solution": "We analyze the coupling stoichiometry: per transport cycle, $3$ $Na^{+}$ are moved out of the cell while $1$ $Mg^{2+}$ is moved into the cell.\n\nStep 1 (classify by direction): A symporter moves coupled substrates in the same direction across the membrane, whereas an antiporter moves them in opposite directions. Here, $Na^{+}$ moves outward and $Mg^{2+}$ moves inward, which are opposite directions. Therefore, it is an antiporter.\n\nStep 2 (electrogenicity): A transporter is electrogenic if the net charge transferred across the membrane per cycle is nonzero; it is electroneutral if the net charge is zero. Let outward movement be positive. The net charge moved per cycle, in units of the elementary charge, is\n$$\nQ_{\\text{net}} = (3)(+1)\\cdot(+1) + (1)(+2)\\cdot(-1) = 3 - 2 = 1.\n$$\nThis is nonzero, so the transporter is electrogenic, with a net movement of one positive charge outward per cycle.\n\nStep 3 (primary vs secondary): The process is driven by the sodium electrochemical gradient maintained by a separate primary active transporter; thus this transporter itself is a secondary active antiporter, not a primary active transporter.\n\nCombining these results, the correct classification is an antiporter and electrogenic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1735648"}, {"introduction": "Secondary active transport harnesses the energy stored in an electrochemical gradient.

This practice challenges you to think like a physiologist by predicting how a transporter's function changes when the underlying ion gradients are disrupted. Analyzing the Na$^{+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger in a pathological scenario will deepen your understanding of the reversibility of secondary active transport and its profound implications for cell function and disease. [@problem_id:1735663]", "problem": "A cardiac myocyte maintains a low intracellular calcium concentration ($[Ca^{2+}]$) during its resting state, which is essential for proper muscle relaxation. This is achieved in part by a membrane protein called the Sodium-Calcium Exchanger (NCX), a secondary active transporter. Under normal physiological conditions, the NCX couples the energetically favorable influx of three sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) down their steep electrochemical gradient to the energetically unfavorable efflux of one calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) against its gradient.\n\nConsider a scenario where this cardiac myocyte is exposed to a potent toxin. This toxin creates permanent, non-selective channels in the cell membrane, permeable to small cations. This leads to a massive, uncontrolled influx of $Na^{+}$ into the cell, overwhelming the capacity of the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase pump to maintain the normal sodium gradient. As a result, the intracellular $Na^{+}$ concentration rises dramatically, approaching the concentration of $Na^{+}$ in the extracellular fluid.\n\nBased on the principles of secondary active transport and the function of an antiporter, what is the most likely immediate effect on the net movement of $Ca^{2+}$ ions via the NCX transporter?\n\nA. $Ca^{2+}$ will be transported out of the cell, but at a significantly reduced rate.\nB. The NCX will reverse its direction of transport, causing a net influx of $Ca^{2+}$ into the cell.\nC. The NCX will be inhibited and cease all transport of both $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$.\nD. The transport of $Ca^{2+}$ will remain directed out of the cell and its rate will increase to compensate for the ionic imbalance.\nE. The toxin-induced membrane damage will cause $Ca^{2+}$ to leak out of the cell, rendering the NCX's contribution negligible.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the effect of a massive increase in intracellular sodium concentration on the direction of calcium transport by the Sodium-Calcium Exchanger (NCX) in a cardiac myocyte.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the normal operation of the NCX.**\nThe NCX is a secondary active transporter, specifically an antiporter. It does not use Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) directly. Instead, it harnesses the potential energy stored in the electrochemical gradient of one ion ($Na^{+}$) to move another ion ($Ca^{2+}$) against its electrochemical gradient.\n- **Primary Transport Foundation:** The $Na^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase (a primary active transporter) actively pumps $Na^{+}$ out of the cell, creating a low intracellular $Na^{+}$ concentration and a high extracellular $Na^{+}$ concentration. This steep concentration gradient for $Na^{+}$ means there is a strong driving force for $Na^{+}$ to enter the cell.\n- **NCX Normal (Forward) Mode:** The NCX allows three $Na^{+}$ ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient into the cell. The energy released by this process is used to pump one $Ca^{2+}$ ion out of the cell, against its very steep concentration gradient (intracellular $[Ca^{2+}]$ is kept extremely low compared to extracellular $[Ca^{2+}]$). This is the \"forward mode\" of the exchanger, and it helps the cell relax by removing $Ca^{2+}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the toxin.**\nThe toxin creates pores that allow a massive, uncontrolled influx of $Na^{+}$. This causes the intracellular $Na^{+}$ concentration, $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$, to rise dramatically. The problem states that $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ starts to approach the extracellular concentration, $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{out}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the impact on the NCX's driving force.**\nThe driving force for the NCX's forward mode is the steep electrochemical gradient for $Na^{+}$. When $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ increases drastically, this gradient is diminished or even reversed.\n- The chemical potential part of the driving force for $Na^{+}$ influx is related to the ratio $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{out}} / [\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$. As $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ increases and approaches $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{out}}$, this ratio approaches 1, and the natural logarithm of the ratio approaches 0. This means the chemical driving force for $Na^{+}$ influx disappears.\n- If $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ were to become even slightly greater than $[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{out}}$, the chemical gradient for $Na^{+}$ would be reversed, favoring the efflux of $Na^{+}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the new direction of transport.**\nTransporters like the NCX are typically reversible. Their direction of operation is determined by the net thermodynamics of the coupled transport process. The overall free energy change ($\\Delta G$) for the forward mode ($3 \\text{ Na}^{+}$ in, $1 \\text{ Ca}^{2+}$ out) depends on the gradients of both ions and the membrane potential.\n- When the inwardly-directed $Na^{+}$ gradient collapses, the energy source for exporting $Ca^{2+}$ is lost.\n- The system will now follow the path of least energetic resistance. The exceedingly high intracellular $[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ creates a new, strong driving force for $Na^{+}$ to be exported *out* of the cell.\n- The NCX can run in \"reverse mode\" to exploit this new gradient. In reverse mode, it couples the now-favorable efflux of three $Na^{+}$ ions to the influx of one $Ca^{2+}$ ion. Although $Ca^{2+}$ is moving against its normal efflux direction, the driving force provided by exporting $Na^{+}$ in this pathological state is sufficient to drive $Ca^{2+}$ into the cell.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and select the correct option.**\nThe collapse and reversal of the $Na^{+}$ gradient cause the NCX to switch from its forward mode ($Ca^{2+}$ efflux) to its reverse mode ($Ca^{2+}$ influx). Therefore, the net movement of $Ca^{2+}$ via the NCX will be into the cell.\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because the driving force for \"forward\" transport is lost, so transport out of the cell cannot be maintained, even at a reduced rate.\n- **Option B** is correct. The transporter reverses, leading to $Ca^{2+}$ influx.\n- **Option C** is incorrect. The transporter is a passive protein (in the sense of having no intrinsic motor) that responds to gradients. It does not simply \"stop\" unless there is no net driving force for transport in either direction, which is a very specific condition (equilibrium). Given the strong new $Na^{+}$ gradient, it will operate in reverse.\n- **Option D** is incorrect. The driving force for $Ca^{2+}$ efflux is completely removed, so the rate cannot increase.\n- **Option E** is incorrect. While the toxin might also cause some $Ca^{2+}$ leakage, the question specifically asks about the effect on the NCX transporter itself. The NCX will actively contribute to the change in $Ca^{2+}$ flux by reversing its operation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1735663"}]}
