This property is heavily influenced by the membrane's lipid composition. This exercise challenges you to explore the relationship between the structure of phospholipid fatty acid tails and the overall fluidity of the membrane, a fundamental concept in homeoviscous adaptation. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving a synthetic protocell [@problem_id:1718153], you will strengthen your understanding of how van der Waals interactions between hydrocarbon chains dictate the physical state of the bilayer.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing an artificial protocell intended to function optimally in a warm aqueous environment maintained at $40^\\circ\\text{C}$. The membrane of this protocell is composed entirely of phospholipids. The team initially synthesizes the phospholipids using a precursor that exclusively produces saturated fatty acids with 20-carbon (C20) chains. Upon testing, they find that the resulting membranes are too viscous and rigid at the target temperature, impairing the function of embedded proteins.\n\nTo remedy this, the team plans to create a new batch of protocells. For this new batch, they will synthesize the phospholipids such that a large fraction of the 20-carbon fatty acid tails are replaced with saturated 14-carbon (C14) fatty acid tails. All other factors, such as the phospholipid head groups and the external environment, remain identical.\n\nWhat is the primary biophysical consequence of this change on the protocell membrane at the operating temperature of $40^\\circ\\text{C}$?\n\nA. The membrane will become even more rigid because the shorter fatty acid tails can pack more densely.\nB. The membrane fluidity will increase because there are fewer van der Waals interactions between the shorter fatty acid tails.\nC. The net charge on the membrane surface will change, leading to an increase in fluidity.\nD. The thickness of the membrane will increase, causing a decrease in the mobility of embedded proteins.\nE. The membrane fluidity will remain unchanged because the degree of saturation of the fatty acid tails has not been altered.", "solution": "We analyze how changing acyl chain length affects bilayer physical properties at a fixed temperature. Membrane fluidity at a given temperature reflects the balance of chain-chain van der Waals cohesion (favoring order) and configurational entropy (favoring disorder). For saturated phospholipid bilayers, increasing acyl chain length increases the strength and number of chain-chain London dispersion interactions, thereby increasing the enthalpy required to disorder the chains and raising the gel-to-fluid phase transition temperature.\n\nLet $N_{C}$ denote the number of carbons per saturated acyl chain. The cohesive enthalpy per chain scales approximately with contact area and thus with chain length, so one can write symbolically\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{melt}} \\propto N_{C},\n$$\nwhile the entropy change per chain upon melting, $\\Delta S_{\\text{melt}}$, is much less sensitive to $N_{C}$ for the same headgroup chemistry. The main-chain melting temperature then satisfies\n$$\nT_m=\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{melt}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{melt}}},\n$$\nso decreasing $N_{C}$ lowers $\\Delta H_{\\text{melt}}$ and hence lowers $T_m$.\n\nInitially, with saturated C20 chains, the membrane is described as too viscous and rigid at $40^\\circ\\text{C}$, implying that $T_m$ is at or above, or not far below, the operating temperature, leading to high order and low fluidity. Replacing many C20 chains with saturated C14 chains decreases $N_C$, weakens van der Waals interactions, lowers $\\Delta H_{\\text{melt}}$, and thereby decreases $T_m$. At the same fixed operating temperature, moving $T_m$ downward increases the distance $T-T_m$, which increases fluidity and decreases viscosity.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect: shorter saturated chains pack less tightly due to reduced contact area and weaker dispersion interactions, lowering rigidity rather than increasing it.\n- B is correct: fewer and weaker van der Waals interactions between shorter tails increase fluidity at $40^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n- C is incorrect: headgroups and thus surface charge are unchanged; charge does not explain the observed change in core fluidity here.\n- D is incorrect: bilayer thickness decreases with shorter tails; moreover, the net effect is increased, not decreased, protein mobility due to higher fluidity.\n- E is incorrect: although saturation is unchanged, chain length is an independent and strong determinant of $T_m$ and fluidity.\n\nTherefore, the primary biophysical consequence is increased membrane fluidity due to reduced tail-tail van der Waals interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1718153"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the physical nature of the membrane itself, we now turn to how substances traverse it.

Distinguishing between different transport mechanisms—such as facilitated diffusion, primary active transport, and secondary active transport—is a key skill for any biologist. This final practice [@problem_id:1718120] places you in the role of an investigator, tasked with interpreting a set of experimental observations. By systematically evaluating evidence related to saturation kinetics, energy dependence, and concentration gradients, you will deduce the most likely transport mechanism for a novel nutrient, honing your analytical and problem-solving skills.", "problem": "An experimental biologist is investigating the mechanism by which a newly discovered, uncharged nutrient, \"Nutrient X,\" enters a specific type of eukaryotic cell. The cell maintains a stable internal environment and is suspended in a controlled buffer solution. The biologist performs a series of experiments to characterize the transport process, yielding the following key observations:\n\n1.  The initial velocity of Nutrient X uptake into the cells shows saturation kinetics. A plot of initial uptake rate versus the extracellular concentration of Nutrient X is hyperbolic and can be accurately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding a finite maximum transport rate ($V_{max}$) and a specific binding affinity constant ($K_m$).\n\n2.  When the cells are pre-treated with oligomycin, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial F-type Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthase which leads to a significant depletion of cellular ATP levels, the kinetics of Nutrient X uptake ($V_{max}$ and $K_m$) remain unchanged.\n\n3.  When the experiment is repeated in the presence of Carbonyl Cyanide m-ChloroPhenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore that dissipates electrochemical proton gradients across cellular membranes, there is no discernible effect on the rate of Nutrient X transport.\n\n4.  Even after prolonged incubation, the intracellular concentration of Nutrient X never exceeds its concentration in the external buffer solution.\n\nBased on this set of experimental evidence, which of the following transport mechanisms is most likely responsible for the uptake of Nutrient X?\n\nA. Simple Diffusion\nB. Facilitated Diffusion\nC. Primary Active Transport\nD. Ion-coupled Secondary Active Transport\nE. Endocytosis", "solution": "We analyze each observation using standard transport principles to identify the most consistent mechanism.\n\nFirst, the initial uptake velocity follows Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with finite $V_{max}$ and $K_m$. Carrier-mediated transport (facilitated diffusion or active transport) exhibits saturability due to a finite number of transporters, typically described by\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{max}[X]_{out}}{K_m+[X]_{out}}.\n$$\nIn contrast, simple diffusion obeys Fick’s law and is not saturable:\n$$\nJ=P\\left([X]_{out}-[X]_{in}\\right),\n$$\nwhich is linear in concentration difference and does not display a hyperbolic dependence on $[X]_{out}$. Therefore, simple diffusion is inconsistent with the observed saturation and is excluded.\n\nSecond, oligomycin depletes cellular ATP by inhibiting the mitochondrial F-type ATP synthase. Primary active transport requires direct ATP hydrolysis to drive solute movement against its gradient; thus, ATP depletion should reduce $V_{max}$ and typically alter apparent $K_m$ if transporter cycling is impaired. The observation that both $V_{max}$ and $K_m$ remain unchanged rules out primary active transport. Endocytosis also depends on cellular energy (ATP and GTP) for vesicle formation and trafficking; substantial ATP depletion should reduce uptake capacity, which is not observed, arguing against endocytosis.\n\nThird, CCCP dissipates electrochemical proton gradients by uncoupling proton movements, thereby collapsing the proton motive force. Secondary active transport that is H$^{+}$-coupled relies on the electrochemical gradient\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu_{H^{+}}=RT\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{in}}{[H^{+}]_{out}}\\right)+z_{H^{+}}F\\Delta\\psi\n$$\nto drive uphill transport of the substrate. Eliminating $\\Delta\\mu_{H^{+}}$ should decrease uptake rate or capacity for H$^{+}$-coupled symport or antiport. The absence of any effect of CCCP excludes H$^{+}$-coupled secondary active transport. Although some secondary active transporters are Na$^{+}$-coupled, such mechanisms generally enable accumulation against a gradient and depend on ion gradients and membrane potential; this is further addressed by the next point.\n\nFourth, the intracellular concentration of the uncharged Nutrient X never exceeds its extracellular concentration, even after prolonged incubation. For a passive process acting on an uncharged solute, the equilibrium condition is\n$$\n[X]_{in}=[X]_{out},\n$$\nsince the only driving force is the concentration gradient. In contrast, secondary active transport (ion-coupled) can accumulate substrate against its concentration gradient, allowing $[X]_{in}>[X]_{out}$ up to a limit set by the coupling stoichiometry and the ion electrochemical gradient. The inability to exceed the external concentration therefore argues against any concentrative (active) mechanism, whether primary or secondary, and is fully consistent with passive, carrier-mediated transport.\n\nCollectively:\n- Saturation kinetics exclude simple diffusion and support a carrier-mediated process.\n- No effect of ATP depletion excludes primary active transport and endocytosis.\n- No effect of proton gradient collapse excludes H$^{+}$-coupled secondary active transport.\n- Lack of accumulation above external concentration excludes any active transport and supports passive equilibration.\n\nThe only mechanism consistent with all observations is facilitated diffusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1718120"}]}
