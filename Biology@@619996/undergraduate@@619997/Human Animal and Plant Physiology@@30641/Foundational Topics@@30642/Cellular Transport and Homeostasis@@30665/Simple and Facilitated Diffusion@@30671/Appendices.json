These liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of a pure phospholipid bilayer. In an experiment, a batch of these liposomes, which initially contain only an inert isotonic buffer, is suspended in a large volume of an external solution. This external solution has the same osmolarity as the internal buffer but contains 150 mM of glycerol ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_8\\text{O}_3$, molecular weight ≈ 92.1 g/mol) and 150 mM of sodium chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$, molecular weight ≈ 58.4 g/mol).\n\nAssuming that the transport of these substances into the liposome occurs exclusively via simple diffusion and that no specialized transport proteins are present in the membrane, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the initial net movement of these substances across the liposome membrane?\n\nA. Sodium chloride will enter the liposome much more rapidly than glycerol because its molecular weight is significantly lower.\n\nB. Glycerol and sodium chloride will enter the liposome at approximately the same rate because their initial concentration gradients are identical.\n\nC. Neither substance will enter the liposome because the external solution is isotonic to the internal buffer.\n\nD. Glycerol will enter the liposome, but sodium chloride will show negligible entry. This will cause water to initially move out of the liposome.\n\nE. Glycerol will enter the liposome, but sodium chloride will show negligible entry. This will cause water to initially move into the liposome.", "solution": "The membrane is a pure phospholipid bilayer with no transport proteins, so solute movement occurs only by simple diffusion. For each solute $i$, the unidirectional diffusive flux into the liposome is given by Fick’s law across a membrane, which can be written as\n$$\nJ_{i} = P_{i}\\left(C_{o,i} - C_{i,i}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $P_{i}$ is the permeability coefficient and $C_{o,i}$ and $C_{i,i}$ are the outside and inside concentrations, respectively.\n\nPermeability through a phospholipid bilayer depends primarily on polarity and charge, not on molecular weight. Neutral, small polar molecules such as glycerol have a finite $P_{\\text{gly}} > 0$, whereas inorganic ions such as $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ have extremely low permeability due to charge and hydration, effectively $P_{\\text{NaCl}} \\approx 0$ in the absence of channels.

The problem states the external solution is isotonic to the internal buffer initially, so at $t=0$,\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi(0) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad J_{w}(0) = 0.\n$$\nAs time begins, glycerol diffuses into the liposome while $\\text{NaCl}$ remains effectively outside. The external volume is large, so $C_{o,\\text{gly}}$ and $C_{o,\\text{NaCl}}$ remain essentially constant. The entry of glycerol increases the intracellular solute content,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\sum_{j} C_{i,j}(t)\\right) > 0 \\quad \\text{due to glycerol influx},\n$$\nmaking $\\Pi_{\\text{in}}(t) > \\Pi_{\\text{out}}(t)$ transiently.

Thus, initially glycerol enters, sodium chloride shows negligible entry, and water moves into the liposome.\n\nOption A is false because permeability is dominated by charge and hydrophobicity, not molecular weight, and ions are far less permeable than glycerol. Option B is false because equal concentration gradients do not imply equal fluxes when permeabilities differ ($P_{\\text{gly}} \\gg P_{\\text{NaCl}}$). Option C is false because isotonicity only guarantees no initial net water flux; permeant solutes still diffuse down their concentration gradients. Between D and E, the correct water direction is inward, not outward, due to the transient increase in intracellular solute from glycerol entry.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that glycerol will enter while sodium chloride shows negligible entry, and water will initially move into the liposome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1742149"}, {"introduction": "While simple diffusion provides a basic pathway, cells employ carrier proteins for the efficient uptake of many essential molecules via facilitated diffusion.
