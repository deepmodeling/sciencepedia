The fluidity of a cell membrane is not uniform; it is dynamically determined by its lipid composition. This exercise explores this fundamental principle by asking you to predict how the structure of phospholipid tails—specifically, their degree of saturation—impacts membrane permeability, a key factor in transport and cellular function. [@problem_id:1735154]", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate the permeability of artificial membranes. Two distinct populations of vesicles, known as liposomes, are synthesized in a laboratory.\n\nPopulation A consists of liposomes formed exclusively from phospholipids that have long, fully saturated fatty acid tails.\nPopulation B consists of liposomes formed exclusively from phospholipids that have long, cis-unsaturated fatty acid tails.\n\nBoth populations of liposomes are suspended in separate, identical aqueous solutions containing a 1 M concentration of glycerol. The entire experiment is maintained at a constant temperature of 25°C.\n\nBased on the principles of membrane structure and function, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The liposomes in Population A will be more permeable to glycerol because the straight, ordered structure of saturated fatty acid tails creates uniform channels for small molecules to pass through.\n\nB. The liposomes in Population B will be more permeable to glycerol because the kinks in the cis-unsaturated fatty acid tails prevent tight packing, leading to a more fluid membrane.\n\nC. The liposomes in Population A will be more permeable to glycerol because the lack of double bonds makes the membrane more hydrophobic, which facilitates the passage of the polar glycerol molecule.\n\nD. The liposomes in Population B will be more permeable to glycerol because the double bonds in the fatty acid tails are polar and form temporary favorable interactions with glycerol, pulling it into the membrane.\n\nE. Both populations of liposomes will exhibit identical permeability to glycerol because glycerol is a small, uncharged molecule, and its passage is not significantly affected by the type of fatty acid tail.", "solution": "We compare the permeability of glycerol across two lipid bilayer compositions at the same temperature and external solution. For passive permeation, the unidirectional flux $J$ can be described by the solubility-diffusion model:\n$$\nJ = P\\,\\Delta C,\n$$\nwhere $P$ is the permeability coefficient and $\\Delta C$ is the transmembrane concentration difference. Because both populations experience the same solution conditions and temperature, any difference in $J$ for a given $\\Delta C$ arises from differences in $P$ that are due solely to bilayer composition.\n\nIn the solubility-diffusion framework,\n$$\nP = \\frac{D\\,K}{L},\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute within the hydrophobic core, $K$ is the solute’s partition coefficient from water into the membrane interior, and $L$ is the effective thickness of the barrier. Equivalently, one can express the barrier as an activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, giving\n$$\nP \\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right),\n$$\nso that increased bilayer order and tighter packing raise $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and reduce $P$, while increased disorder lowers $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and elevates $P$. Cis-unsaturated fatty acyl chains introduce kinks that prevent tight packing, reduce van der Waals interactions, increase lateral and segmental dynamics, and create more transient free volume. These effects increase $D$ and reduce the effective free-energy barrier to permeation, thereby increasing $P$. In contrast, fully saturated long chains pack tightly, maximize van der Waals contacts, increase order and thickness, and reduce free volume, which lowers $D$, raises $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, and decreases $P$.\n\nApplying these principles to the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because straight saturated tails pack tightly rather than forming channels; lipid tails do not create uniform channels for solute passage, and tight packing decreases permeability.\n- Option B is correct: cis-unsaturated kinks prevent tight packing, increase membrane fluidity and disorder, and thus increase glycerol permeability via larger $D$ and lower $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$.\n- Option C is incorrect because a more hydrophobic, tightly packed core disfavors the entry of a polar solute such as glycerol; increased hydrophobicity and order increase the barrier and reduce permeability.\n- Option D is incorrect because the C=C bonds in hydrocarbon chains are not significantly polar in a way that would form favorable polar interactions with glycerol in the membrane core; permeation is dominated by hydrophobic packing and free-volume effects rather than specific polar interactions with double bonds.\n- Option E is incorrect because permeability to small polar solutes like glycerol depends strongly on bilayer composition and fluidity; saturated versus cis-unsaturated chains yield different $P$ values under identical conditions.\n\nTherefore, the liposomes with cis-unsaturated fatty acid tails (Population B) will be more permeable to glycerol for the correct mechanistic reason stated in B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1735154"}, {"introduction": "While the lipid bilayer forms the basic structure of the membrane, it's the embedded and associated proteins that carry out most of its specific functions. These proteins are classified based on the nature of their association with the bilayer. This problem walks you through the logic of a classic biochemical workflow, using different chemical treatments to determine whether a newly discovered protein is an integral or peripheral component of the membrane. [@problem_id:1735116]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a newly discovered protein, which they have named \"GlycoReceptor-Z\" (GR-Z). Preliminary studies have confirmed that GR-Z is associated with the plasma membrane of cultured human cells. To determine the nature of this association, the biologist performs two separate experiments.\n\n**Experiment 1:** A culture of intact cells is washed with a buffer solution containing a high concentration of salt (1.0 M KCl). After the wash, the cells are separated from the wash solution (supernatant) by centrifugation. The cell pellet and the supernatant are then analyzed for the presence of GR-Z. The analysis reveals that GR-Z is exclusively found in the cell pellet and is absent from the high-salt supernatant.\n\n**Experiment 2:** The biologist first prepares a purified fraction of plasma membranes from a large batch of cells. This membrane fraction is then treated with a buffer containing a mild, non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100). After incubation, the mixture is subjected to ultracentrifugation, which pellets any remaining insoluble membrane fragments. Analysis of the resulting supernatant and pellet shows that GR-Z is now found almost entirely in the supernatant.\n\nBased on the results of these two experiments, what is the most likely conclusion about how GlycoReceptor-Z is associated with the plasma membrane?\n\nA. GR-Z is a peripheral membrane protein attached to the membrane surface primarily through electrostatic interactions.\n\nB. GR-Z is an integral membrane protein embedded within the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer.\n\nC. GR-Z is a secreted protein that becomes trapped in the extracellular matrix and co-purifies with the plasma membrane.\n\nD. GR-Z is a cytoskeletal protein that binds to the intracellular face of the plasma membrane.\n\nE. The experimental results are contradictory and do not allow for a clear conclusion to be drawn.", "solution": "We interpret the results using standard principles of membrane protein biochemistry and fractionation.\n\nStep 1: Principle of high-salt extraction. A high ionic strength buffer (e.g., 1.0 M KCl) screens electrostatic interactions and competes with ionic bonds at membrane surfaces. This treatment typically releases peripheral membrane proteins that are attached primarily through electrostatic interactions to lipid headgroups or to other membrane proteins, provided the binding site is accessible to the salt. Integral membrane proteins, which are embedded in the hydrophobic core via transmembrane segments, are not released by high salt alone.\n\nStep 2: Interpretation of Experiment 1. Intact cells were washed with high salt, then pelleted; GR-Z remained exclusively in the cell pellet and was absent from the supernatant. This indicates that GR-Z is not released by high salt from intact cells. Two possibilities remain: (i) GR-Z is an integral membrane protein, or (ii) GR-Z is a peripheral protein located on the cytosolic face (thus not accessible to the external high-salt wash in intact cells). The data rule out externally exposed peripheral electrostatic attachment, because such proteins would be extracted into the supernatant under these conditions.\n\nStep 3: Principle of non-ionic detergent solubilization. Mild non-ionic detergents (e.g., Triton X-100) solubilize lipid bilayers by forming mixed micelles, extracting integral membrane proteins through hydrophobic interactions into the detergent-containing supernatant after ultracentrifugation. In contrast, many peripheral membrane proteins that are not embedded in the bilayer, as well as cytoskeletal elements and detergent-resistant complexes, tend to remain in the insoluble pellet unless specifically extracted by salt or other reagents.\n\nStep 4: Interpretation of Experiment 2. After isolating plasma membranes and treating with Triton X-100, GR-Z is found almost entirely in the supernatant. This pattern is characteristic of an integral membrane protein becoming solubilized into detergent micelles. A protein that is merely peripherally associated via electrostatic interactions would more likely have been removed by high salt in Experiment 1 (if externally accessible), and cytoskeletal proteins or strongly scaffold-associated proteins typically partition into the detergent-insoluble pellet rather than the supernatant.\n\nStep 5: Synthesis of both experiments. The inability of high salt to extract GR-Z from intact cells, combined with efficient solubilization into the supernatant by a non-ionic detergent after membrane isolation, most strongly supports that GR-Z is an integral membrane protein embedded in the lipid bilayer. This is inconsistent with a purely peripheral electrostatic attachment (Option A), a cytoskeletal protein bound to the intracellular face (Option D), or a secreted protein trapped in extracellular matrix (Option C). The results are coherent and not contradictory (Option E is false).\n\nConclusion: GR-Z is an integral membrane protein embedded within the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1735116"}, {"introduction": "The fluid mosaic model implies that membrane components are not static but can move laterally within the bilayer; however, this movement is often highly regulated. This practice introduces a powerful technique, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), to investigate the mobility of membrane proteins. You will explore how underlying cellular structures, like the cytoskeleton, can act as \"fences\" or \"tethers\" to control protein location and function. [@problem_id:1735123]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the lateral mobility of a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) in the plasma membrane of cultured human fibroblasts. To quantify this mobility, the biologist employs a technique called Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). In this method, the GPCRs are first tagged with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Then, a high-intensity laser is used to irreversibly bleach the GFP molecules in a small, circular region of the cell's plasma membrane. The rate at which fluorescence returns to this bleached spot, due to the diffusion of unbleached GPCR-GFP molecules from surrounding areas, is measured over time.\n\nThe experiment is conducted on two groups of cells. The control group is untreated. The experimental group is treated with Cytochalasin D, a drug that specifically binds to the growing ends of actin filaments and prevents their polymerization, effectively disrupting the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton that lies just beneath the plasma membrane.\n\nAssuming the drug has no other significant effects on the cell or the GPCRs themselves, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected results of the FRAP experiment on the drug-treated cells compared to the untreated control cells?\n\nA. There will be no significant difference in the rate or final extent of fluorescence recovery.\n\nB. The recovery of fluorescence will be significantly faster, and the final percentage of recovery will be higher.\n\nC. The recovery of fluorescence will be significantly slower, and the final percentage of recovery will be lower.\n\nD. The bleached spot will show no fluorescence recovery, indicating the GPCRs have become completely immobile.\n\nE. The GPCRs will rapidly aggregate into large, non-diffusing clusters, making a FRAP measurement impossible.", "solution": "We analyze fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) as diffusion-limited replenishment of unbleached fluorophores into a bleached region on a two-dimensional membrane. Let $c(\\mathbf{r},t)$ denote the surface concentration of unbleached GPCR-GFP molecules. In the absence of reactions and with purely lateral mobility, the mobile fraction obeys the diffusion equation\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}=D\\nabla^{2}c,\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the lateral diffusion coefficient. In FRAP, the observable fluorescence recovery in the bleached region is governed by the diffusion of the mobile population and the presence of any immobile fraction. Denote the mobile fraction by $f_{m}$ and the immobile fraction by $1-f_{m}$.\n\nFor a circular bleached spot of effective radius $w$, standard FRAP analysis yields a recovery kinetics characterized by a diffusion-limited timescale\n$$\nt_{1/2}=\\beta \\frac{w^{2}}{D},\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on the bleaching geometry and the analysis model. Thus, increasing $D$ decreases $t_{1/2}$, i.e., recovery becomes faster. The long-time recovery plateau equals the mobile fraction:\n$$\nR(\\infty)=f_{m}.\n$$\n\nThe cortical actin cytoskeleton creates membrane barriers and anchoring points (e.g., corrals and picket-fence effects) that impede lateral diffusion and maintain a subpopulation of receptors in an effectively immobile or slowly exchanging state. Consequently, in untreated cells, the actin network tends to lower $D$ and reduce $f_{m}$ for membrane proteins that interact with actin-associated scaffolds.\n\nCytochalasin D prevents actin polymerization and disrupts the cortical actin network. Under the stated assumption that the drug has no other significant effects on the cell or the GPCRs themselves, disruption of actin reduces corralling and anchoring, thereby:\n- increasing the effective diffusion coefficient: $D' > D$, which implies\n$$\nt'_{1/2}=\\beta \\frac{w^{2}}{D'} < \\beta \\frac{w^{2}}{D}=t_{1/2},\n$$\nso recovery is faster; and\n- increasing the mobile fraction: $f'_{m} \\geq f_{m}$, which implies\n$$\nR'(\\infty)=f'_{m} \\geq f_{m}=R(\\infty),\n$$\nso the final extent of recovery is higher.\n\nAlternatives that predict no change (A), slower recovery with lower plateau (C), no recovery (D), or aggregation precluding FRAP (E) are not consistent with diffusion theory and the known role of cortical actin as a barrier/anchor under the given assumptions.
