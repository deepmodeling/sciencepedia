These vesicles are also spherical, each with a uniform radius of $r$. Assume that $r$ is much smaller than $R$.

This problem challenges you to think like a cell biologist by predicting the outcome of a hypothetical experiment involving endocytosis [@problem_id:1757393]. By analyzing the effect of a specific inhibitor on the Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) dependent protein dynamin, you will gain insight into the precise molecular choreography required to pinch off vesicles from the plasma membrane.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the cellular uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, a process known to rely on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In an experiment, a culture of fibroblast cells is incubated with a medium containing LDL. For the experimental group, the cells are pre-treated with GTP-gamma-S (GTPγS), a synthetic analog of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) that can bind effectively to GTP-binding proteins but is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis into Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP). The biologist then uses transmission electron microscopy to observe the ultrastructure of the plasma membrane in these treated cells.\n\nAssuming the GTPγS has successfully entered the cells and is active in the cytosol, which of the following observations is the most likely consequence of the compound's effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis?\n\nA. The plasma membrane appears abnormally smooth, with a significant reduction in the number of clathrin-coated pits, indicating a failure in the initial assembly of the endocytic coat.\n\nB. Numerous clathrin-coated vesicles are observed freely diffusing in the cytoplasm, but they fail to shed their clathrin coats, leading to their accumulation.\n\nC. LDL receptors and their bound LDL cargo cluster correctly on the cell surface, but the plasma membrane fails to invaginate to form a pit.\n\nD. Deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits are seen in large numbers, but they remain tethered to the plasma membrane by a narrow stalk and fail to detach as free vesicles.\n\nE. The rate of LDL uptake is unaffected, as the primary energy-requiring steps of vesicle formation and scission depend on the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), not GTP.", "solution": "The key mechanistic premise is that GTP$\\gamma$S is a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog: it binds to GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) and prevents the transition from the GTP-bound (active) state to the GDP-bound (inactive) state because hydrolysis $ \\mathrm{GTP} \\to \\mathrm{GDP} + \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{i}} $ cannot occur. In clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane, the essential GTPase whose hydrolysis is required for vesicle scission is dynamin. Dynamin assembles into a helical collar around the neck of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits and utilizes the free energy from GTP hydrolysis to drive membrane fission.\n\nTherefore, if GTP hydrolysis on dynamin is blocked by GTP$\\gamma$S, dynamin will remain in the GTP-bound state and continue to assemble at the neck but will be unable to execute the conformational changes and mechanochemical steps associated with scission. The predicted ultrastructural phenotype is an accumulation of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow neck (or stalk), often with prominent dynamin collars, i.e., scission failure at the last step.\n\nEvaluating the options against this mechanism:\n- Option A (smooth membrane with reduced coated pits) implies a failure of coat initiation/assembly. Coat nucleation and AP2/clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane are governed primarily by cargo, phosphoinositides (notably $\\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$), and adaptors; they do not require GTP hydrolysis. GTP$\\gamma$S would not be expected to reduce coated pit initiation.\n- Option B (coated vesicles that fail to uncoat) describes an uncoating defect. Uncoating requires the ATP-dependent chaperone Hsc70 with auxilin; it depends on ATP, not GTP. Blocking GTP hydrolysis would not specifically cause failure to shed clathrin coats.\n- Option C (cargo clustering but failure to invaginate) suggests a defect in curvature generation/coat assembly, not a scission block. This is not the canonical consequence of inhibiting dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis.\n- Option D (deeply invaginated coated pits tethered by a narrow stalk, failing to detach) matches the established effect of preventing dynamin-mediated scission by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis with nonhydrolyzable analogs like GTP$\\gamma$S.\n- Option E (rate unaffected; only ATP matters) is incorrect because dynamin’s scission is a GTP-dependent step; thus, GTP hydrolysis is essential and is specifically inhibited by GTP$\\gamma$S.\n\nHence, the most likely observation is the accumulation of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that fail to pinch off as free vesicles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1757393"}, {"introduction": "Cells are masters of maintaining stability, or homeostasis, in a constantly changing environment. This final practice elevates our perspective from individual events to the continuous, dynamic regulation of the entire cell surface [@problem_id:1757428]. You will construct and solve a simple differential equation that models the balance between a constant rate of exocytosis, $R_{exo}$, and a proportional rate of endocytosis, $kA(t)$, discovering the elegant mathematical principles that govern how a cell reaches a new steady-state surface area.", "problem": "A specialized secretory cell, essential for metabolic regulation, maintains its plasma membrane integrity through a dynamic balance between exocytosis and endocytosis. Initially, at time $t=0$, the cell is in a resting state with a surface area of $A_0$. Upon receiving a persistent physiological signal, the cell initiates a continuous process of secretion. This results in the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, adding new membrane material at a constant rate, $R_{exo}$, which has units of area per unit time.\n\nTo counteract this expansion and maintain long-term stability, the cell activates a compensatory endocytosis process. The rate at which the membrane area is removed via endocytosis is found to be directly proportional to the cell's instantaneous total surface area, $A(t)$. The proportionality constant for this process is given by $k$, which has units of inverse time.\n\nAssuming that the initial state is not an equilibrium state for the stimulated process (i.e., $R_{exo} \\neq kA_0$), determine a symbolic expression for the time $t_{avg}$ at which the cell's surface area, $A(t)$, becomes equal to the arithmetic mean of its initial surface area, $A_0$, and its new, final steady-state surface area, $A_{ss}$. Your final expression should be in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time it takes for the cell's surface area to reach a specific value, which is the average of its initial and final steady-state areas. To find this time, we must first model the change in surface area over time by setting up and solving a differential equation.\n\nStep 1: Formulate the differential equation for the surface area $A(t)$.\nThe rate of change of the surface area, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the sum of the rate at which the area is added and the rate at which it is removed.\nThe process of exocytosis adds membrane at a constant rate $R_{exo}$. This is a positive contribution to $\\frac{dA}{dt}$.\nThe process of endocytosis removes membrane at a rate proportional to the current surface area $A(t)$, which is $kA(t)$. This is a negative contribution to $\\frac{dA}{dt}$.\nCombining these two processes, we can write the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = R_{exo} - kA(t)\n$$\n\nStep 2: Solve the differential equation.\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} + kA = R_{exo}\n$$\nWe solve this equation using an integrating factor, $I(t)$. The integrating factor is given by $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(kt)$.\nMultiplying the entire equation by the integrating factor $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(kt)\\frac{dA}{dt} + k\\exp(kt)A = R_{exo}\\exp(kt)\n$$\nThe left-hand side of the equation is the result of the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dt}(A \\cdot \\exp(kt))$. So, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(A(t)\\exp(kt)\\right) = R_{exo}\\exp(kt)\n$$\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(A(t)\\exp(kt)\\right) dt = \\int R_{exo}\\exp(kt) dt\n$$\n$$\nA(t)\\exp(kt) = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\\exp(kt) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To find $A(t)$, we divide by $\\exp(kt)$:\n$$\nA(t) = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} + C\\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\nStep 3: Apply the initial condition to find the constant of integration $C$.\nWe are given that at $t=0$, the surface area is $A(0) = A_0$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$$\nA(0) = A_0 = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} + C\\exp(-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\n$$\nA_0 = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} + C\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC = A_0 - \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the solution for $A(t)$:\n$$\nA(t) = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} + \\left(A_0 - \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\\right)\\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\nStep 4: Determine the final steady-state surface area, $A_{ss}$.\nThe steady-state surface area is the area as $t \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the term $\\exp(-kt)$ goes to zero.\n$$\nA_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} A(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} + \\left(A_0 - \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\\right)\\exp(-kt) \\right] = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\n$$\nAlternatively, steady state is achieved when the area stops changing, i.e., $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$. From the original differential equation:\n$$\n0 = R_{exo} - kA_{ss} \\implies A_{ss} = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\n$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the target area.\nThe problem asks for the time $t_{avg}$ when the area $A(t_{avg})$ is the arithmetic mean of the initial area $A_0$ and the final steady-state area $A_{ss}$.\n$$\nA(t_{avg}) = \\frac{A_0 + A_{ss}}{2} = \\frac{A_0 + \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}}{2}\n$$\n\nStep 6: Solve for the time $t_{avg}$.\nWe set our general solution for $A(t)$ equal to this target area and solve for $t = t_{avg}$:\n$$\nA(t_{avg}) = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} + \\left(A_0 - \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}\\right)\\exp(-kt_{avg}) = \\frac{A_0 + \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}}{2}\n$$\nSubstitute $A_{ss} = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k}$ into the equation to simplify:\n$$\nA_{ss} + (A_0 - A_{ss})\\exp(-kt_{avg}) = \\frac{A_0 + A_{ss}}{2}\n$$\nNow, we isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n(A_0 - A_{ss})\\exp(-kt_{avg}) = \\frac{A_0 + A_{ss}}{2} - A_{ss}\n$$\n$$\n(A_0 - A_{ss})\\exp(-kt_{avg}) = \\frac{A_0 + A_{ss} - 2A_{ss}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n(A_0 - A_{ss})\\exp(-kt_{avg}) = \\frac{A_0 - A_{ss}}{2}\n$$\nSince the problem states that $R_{exo} \\neq kA_0$, it implies that $A_{ss} = \\frac{R_{exo}}{k} \\neq A_0$, so $(A_0 - A_{ss}) \\neq 0$. We can safely divide both sides by $(A_0 - A_{ss})$:\n$$\n\\exp(-kt_{avg}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{avg}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(-kt_{avg})) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-kt_{avg} = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{avg}$:\n$$\nt_{avg} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis time is the half-life of the exponential relaxation process towards the new steady state.
