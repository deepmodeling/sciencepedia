Its cardiovascular system can be modeled with the following resting-state parameters: a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of $100$ mmHg and a total cardiac output (CO) of $2.50$ L/min. For this model, we simplify the systemic circulation into three parallel vascular beds: the skeletal muscles, the splanchnic circulation (digestive organs), and a composite \"rest of body\" compartment. At rest, the blood flow is distributed as follows: $20.0\\%$ of the cardiac output perfuses the skeletal muscles, $25.0\\%$ perfuses the splanchnic circulation, and the remaining $55.0\\%$ perfuses the \"rest of body\" compartment.\n\nSuddenly, the gazelle spots a lion in the distance. This visual stimulus triggers a powerful, anticipatory feedforward response via the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for intense physical exertion (fleeing) *before* any movement occurs. This response elicits the following instantaneous changes:\n1. The cardiac output doubles from its resting value.\n2. The vascular resistance of the skeletal muscle bed decreases to $40.0\\%$ of its resting value.\n3. The vascular resistance of the splanchnic circulation triples.\n4. The vascular resistance of the \"rest of body\" compartment remains unchanged.\n\nAssuming the relationship between mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance (TPR) is given by $MAP = CO \\times TPR$, and that resistances in parallel sum reciprocally, calculate the gazelle's new mean arterial pressure during this anticipatory state.

A primary challenge for their sensory system is to distinguish faint electrical signals from prey or environmental objects (exafference) from the overwhelming sensory input caused by their own EOD (reafference). To solve this, these fish have evolved a sophisticated neural mechanism based on feedforward cancellation. This mechanism uses a copy of the motor command for the EOD, known as an efference copy, to generate an internal \"negative image\" signal that cancels the expected reafferent sensory input.\n\nConsider a simplified model of this circuit. The EOD motor command is issued at time $t=0$. This command triggers two parallel pathways that converge on a central sensory neuron, the P-cell.\n\n1.  **The Reafferent Pathway**: The EOD generates an electric pulse in the water. This field is detected by electroreceptors on the fish's skin, which then transmit a signal to the P-cell. The resulting synaptic current in the P-cell, $I_R(t)$, is modeled as a function of time:\n    $$I_R(t) = A_R \\cdot g(t - \\Delta t_R, \\tau_R)$$\n    This current only exists for $t > \\Delta t_R$. Here, $A_R$ is the peak amplitude, $\\Delta t_R$ is the total delay of the reafferent pathway, and $\\tau_R$ is a time constant determining the shape of the current pulse. The normalized pulse shape is given by the function $g(x, \\tau) = (x/\\tau) \\exp(1 - x/\\tau)$, which peaks at $x=\\tau$.\n\n2.  **The Efference Copy Pathway**: The EOD motor command is also sent internally to an inhibitory neuron, the G-cell. The G-cell, in turn, projects to the P-cell, generating an inhibitory synaptic current, $I_I(t)$, that serves as the negative image.
