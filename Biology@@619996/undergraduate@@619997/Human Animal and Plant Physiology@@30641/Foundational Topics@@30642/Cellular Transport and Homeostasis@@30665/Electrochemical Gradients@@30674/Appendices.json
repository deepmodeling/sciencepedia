This conceptual problem [@problem_id:1703983] illustrates this by examining the crucial process of secondary active transport in the kidney. By analyzing the consequences of inhibiting the $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pump, you will trace the chain of events that connects energy expenditure (ATP), the establishment of an ion gradient, and the subsequent transport of essential molecules like glucose.", "problem": "In the epithelial cells of the kidney's Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT), glucose from the tubular fluid is reabsorbed into the body. This process involves two key transport proteins: a Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter (SGLT) on the apical membrane (facing the tubular fluid) and a Na+/K+-ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane (facing the interstitial fluid and blood). The SGLT uses the electrochemical gradient of sodium ions to move glucose into the cell against its concentration gradient (secondary active transport), while the Na+/K+-ATPase pump uses Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to maintain a low intracellular sodium concentration (primary active transport).\n\nA new pharmacological agent, \"Uremex,\" is developed that acts as a highly specific and potent inhibitor of the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase pump in these PCT cells. Assuming Uremex is administered and effectively reaches its target, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct description of the consequences for glucose reabsorption?\n\nA. Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump will cause K+ to leak out of the cell, leading to cellular hyperpolarization, which increases the driving force for Na+ entry via the SGLT and thus accelerates glucose uptake.\n\nB. Uremex will directly bind to the SGLT, acting as a competitive inhibitor for glucose and thereby preventing glucose from entering the cell, while the Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity remains normal.\n\nC. Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump will lead to an accumulation of Na+ inside the cell, which diminishes the transmembrane Na+ gradient required by the SGLT, ultimately halting glucose transport from the tubular fluid into the cell.\n\nD. The blockage of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump causes ATP to accumulate within the cell. This excess ATP directly powers the SGLT to reverse its direction and pump glucose from the cell back into the tubular fluid.\n\nE. The rising intracellular Na+ concentration will cause the cell to swell due to osmosis. This physical swelling deforms the SGLT protein channels, rendering them non-functional and blocking glucose uptake.", "solution": "Glucose reabsorption across the apical membrane of PCT cells via SGLT is a form of secondary active transport driven by the sodium electrochemical gradient maintained by the basolateral Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase.
