This first exercise focuses on the simplest form of carrier-mediated transport, where a single type of molecule is moved across the membrane down its concentration gradient. By analyzing the provided scenario [@problem_id:2302595], you'll learn to identify a uniporter and distinguish facilitated diffusion from simple diffusion and active transport.", "problem": "In the plasma membrane of a certain mammalian cell, a specific integral membrane protein is responsible for transporting glucose from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm. The concentration of glucose is higher outside the cell than inside. The transport mechanism involves the protein binding to a glucose molecule, which induces a conformational change in the protein, subsequently releasing glucose into the cell's interior. This process does not directly consume metabolic energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and does not rely on the simultaneous transport of any other molecule or ion, such as $Na^{+}$ or $H^{+}$.\n\nBased on this description of its function, what is the most precise classification for this type of transport protein?\n\nA. ATP-powered pump\n\nB. Symporter\n\nC. Antiporter\n\nD. Uniporter\n\nE. Ion channel", "solution": "We identify the thermodynamic driving force and the transport mechanism described. The extracellular glucose concentration is higher than the intracellular concentration, so the chemical potential gradient for glucose is downhill into the cell. The chemical potential difference for glucose is $\\Delta \\mu = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[{\\rm in}]}{[{\\rm out}]}\\right)$, and with $[{\\rm out}] > [{\\rm in}]$, we have $\\Delta \\mu < 0$, indicating a spontaneous process that does not require an external energy source such as ATP hydrolysis. The description explicitly states that no ATP is consumed and there is no coupling to other ions or molecules (e.g., $Na^{+}$ or $H^{+}$), so this is not primary active transport (ATP-powered pump) and not secondary active transport (symporter or antiporter).\n\nMechanistically, the protein binds glucose, undergoes a conformational change, and releases glucose on the other side. This is characteristic of carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion rather than a channel, since channels form aqueous pores and typically conduct ions or water without a specific alternating-access binding and release cycle for a single solute. Moreover, because only one solute (glucose) is transported without coupling to another solute, the transporter is classified as a uniporter.\n\nTherefore, the most precise classification is a uniporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2302595"}, {"introduction": "Many vital cellular processes depend on moving a substance against its concentration gradient, a feat often accomplished by coupling its movement to the favorable transport of another ion. This problem explores cotransport, where two different substances are moved in opposite directions by the same protein. Working through this example [@problem_id:2302637] will solidify your ability to distinguish between symporters and antiporters, a key feature of secondary active transport.", "problem": "In many types of animal cells, such as neurons and cardiac muscle cells, it is critical to maintain a very low intracellular concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). One of the key proteins involved in this regulation is a transporter that couples the movement of sodium ions ($Na^+$) with the movement of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). Specifically, this transporter moves three $Na^+$ ions into the cell for every one $Ca^{2+}$ ion it moves out of the cell within a single transport cycle.

A primary active transporter", "solution": "We classify membrane transporters by the number of solutes moved and the relative directions of their movement:\n- A uniporter transports a single solute species across the membrane.\n- A symporter couples the transport of two or more solutes in the same direction across the membrane.\n- An antiporter couples the transport of two or more solutes in opposite directions across the membrane.\n- An ion channel forms a pore allowing passive diffusion of ions down their electrochemical gradients without fixed stoichiometry per cycle.\n- A primary active transporter uses direct energy input (typically ATP hydrolysis) to drive movement against a gradient.\n- A secondary active transporter uses the energy stored in one soluteâ€™s electrochemical gradient to drive another solute uphill, typically via symport or antiport.\n\nGiven mechanism: the protein moves $3$ $Na^{+}$ into the cell for every $1$ $Ca^{2+}$ moved out in a single transport cycle. Because $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$ move in opposite directions, this is countertransport by definition, hence an antiporter. The stoichiometric coupling ($3$ to $1$) further indicates a carrier with fixed exchange rather than a channel. Moreover, the driving force is the $Na^{+}$ electrochemical gradient (established by the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$ ATPase), indicating secondary active transport rather than primary active transport. Therefore, it is not a uniporter, not an ion channel, not a symporter, and not a primary active transporter.\n\nThus, the correct classification is an antiporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2302637"}, {"introduction": "Individual transporters rarely work in isolation; they are often organized into complex systems to perform physiological functions like nutrient absorption across a tissue. This final challenge asks you to design a functional model of a polarized epithelial cell, strategically placing different transporters on its apical and basolateral membranes. By solving this puzzle [@problem_id:2302615], you will synthesize your knowledge of primary and secondary active transport with facilitated diffusion to understand how cells achieve vectorial transport.", "problem": "A polarized intestinal epithelial cell is tasked with the net transcellular absorption of a neutral amino acid (let's denote it as AA) from the intestinal lumen to the interstitial fluid. The cell maintains a low intracellular concentration of sodium ions ($[\\text{Na}^+]$) and a high intracellular concentration of potassium ions ($[\\text{K}^+]$) relative to the extracellular environment (both lumen and interstitial fluid). The absorption process requires moving AA into the cell against its concentration gradient from the lumen, and subsequently releasing it into the interstitial fluid down its newly established concentration gradient. This entire process is energized by the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nGiven the following types of transport proteins:\n1.  **$Na^+$/$K^+$-ATPase:** A primary active transporter that pumps $Na^+$ out and $K^+$ into the cell.\n2.  **$Na^+$-AA Symporter:** A secondary active co-transporter that moves $Na^+$ and AA in the same direction.\n3.  **AA Uniporter:** A facilitated transporter that moves AA down its concentration gradient.\n\nWhich of the following configurations of these transporters on the apical (lumen-facing) and basolateral (interstitial fluid-facing) membranes correctly describes the mechanism for net AA absorption?\n\nA.

Apical membrane: $Na^+$-AA Symporter and AA Uniporter; Basolateral membrane: $Na^+$/$K^+$-ATPase.", "solution": "We aim to achieve net transcellular absorption of a neutral amino acid (AA) from the lumen to the interstitial fluid. The process must include: (i) apical entry of AA into the cell against its concentration gradient, driven by the inward electrochemical gradient of Na^{+} (secondary active transport), (ii) maintenance of a low intracellular [Na^{+}] and high intracellular [K^{+}] via ATP hydrolysis (primary active transport), and (iii) basolateral exit of AA down its concentration gradient by facilitated diffusion.\n\nFirst, we formalize the energetic requirements for the apical step. For a Na^{+}-AA symporter that simultaneously translocates one Na^{+} and one neutral AA from lumen (out) to cytosol (in), the total free energy change per transport cycle is\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{symport}} = \\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}} + \\Delta \\mu_{\\text{AA}},\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{out}}} \\right) + z_{\\text{Na}} F \\Delta \\psi, \\quad z_{\\text{Na}}=+1,\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{AA}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{[AA]_{\\text{in}}}{[AA]_{\\text{out}}} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi = \\psi_{\\text{in}} - \\psi_{\\text{out}}$. For intestinal epithelial cells, $[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}} \\ll [Na^{+}]_{\\text{out}}$ and $\\Delta \\psi < 0$, so $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}} < 0$ strongly favors Na^{+} entry. To move AA into the cell against its concentration gradient from lumen to cytosol, we have $[AA]_{\\text{in}} > [AA]_{\\text{out}}$ and hence $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{AA}} > 0$. The symporter operates if\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{symport}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{out}}} \\right) + F \\Delta \\psi + RT \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{[AA]_{\\text{in}}}{[AA]_{\\text{out}}} \\right) < 0,\n$$\nwhich is satisfied because the large negative driving force for Na^{+} entry overcomes the positive term for AA uptake. Therefore, the Na^{+}-AA symporter must be placed on the apical membrane to couple AA uptake from the lumen to the inward Na^{+} gradient.\n\nSecond, maintaining the inward Na^{+} electrochemical gradient requires primary active transport by Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase, which hydrolyzes ATP to extrude Na^{+} and import K^{+}. In epithelia, this pump is localized to the basolateral membrane to remove Na^{+} that entered the cell (via apical cotransport) into the interstitial space and to sustain low $[Na^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$. The pump stoichiometry drives\n$$\n3\\,Na^{+}_{\\text{in}} \\rightarrow 3\\,Na^{+}_{\\text{out}}, \\quad 2\\,K^{+}_{\\text{out}} \\rightarrow 2\\,K^{+}_{\\text{in}},\n$$\npowered by ATP hydrolysis, thereby ensuring $\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{Na}}$ remains strongly negative for apical Na^{+} entry.\n\nThird, once intracellular [AA] has been elevated by apical cotransport, AA must exit to the interstitial fluid to complete net absorption. Because $[AA]_{\\text{in}} > [AA]_{\\text{interstitial}}$, the free energy change for basolateral facilitated diffusion is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\text{AA, baso}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{[AA]_{\\text{interstitial}}}{[AA]_{\\text{in}}} \\right) < 0,\n$$\nso an AA uniporter on the basolateral membrane allows downhill efflux of AA into the interstitial fluid without direct ATP consumption.\n\nThese requirements uniquely specify:\n- Apical membrane: Na^{+}-AA symporter to bring AA into the cell using the inward Na^{+} gradient.\n- Basolateral membrane: Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase to maintain the Na^{+} gradient by ATP hydrolysis, and AA uniporter to mediate AA efflux into the interstitial fluid.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A places the Na^{+}-AA symporter apically and both the Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase and AA uniporter basolaterally, matching the mechanism above.\n- B, C, and D mislocalize key transporters (e.g., apical Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase or basolateral Na^{+}-AA symporter), which would not support vectorial absorption from lumen to interstitium.\n- E lacks a basolateral AA uniporter and instead places the AA uniporter apically, which would allow AA to leak back to the lumen and prevent efficient net absorption into the interstitium.\n\nTherefore, the correct configuration is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2302615"}]}
