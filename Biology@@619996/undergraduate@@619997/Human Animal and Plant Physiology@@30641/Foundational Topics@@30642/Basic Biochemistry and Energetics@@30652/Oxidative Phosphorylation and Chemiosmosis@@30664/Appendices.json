A suspension of isolated, actively respiring mitochondria is prepared in a buffered solution containing an excess of pyruvate and inorganic phosphate.

Electrons from NADH and FADH2 generated by the Krebs cycle flow through the electron transport chain to oxygen, where oxygen is reduced to water.

In pyruvate dehydrogenase and the Krebs cycle decarboxylations (isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), $CO_{2}$ oxygens derive from substrate oxygens and from water through hydration/dehydration steps within the cycle, not from $O_{2}$. Therefore, introducing $^{18}O_{2}$ does not label $CO_{2}$.\n\nATP synthesis by ATP synthase proceeds via phosphorylation of ADP with inorganic phosphate:\n$$\nADP + P_{i} + H^{+} \\rightarrow ATP + H_{2}O,\n$$\nwhere the oxygens in ATP derive from ADP and $P_{i}$, not from molecular oxygen. Thus, $^{18}O$ from $^{18}O_{2}$ is not incorporated into ATP.\n\nSimilarly, the oxygens in pyruvate ($C_{3}H_{3}O_{3}^{-}$) and acetyl-CoA arise from prior metabolic intermediates and water; they are not sourced from the reduction of molecular oxygen in the electron transport chain.\n\nTherefore, the predominant destination of $^{18}O$ supplied as $^{18}O_{2}$ is water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1725455"}, {"introduction": "Having established that oxygen is consumed to produce water, we now explore how this process is regulated by the cell's demand for energy.

At the beginning of the experiment, succinate is added to the suspension, which initiates respiration. A stable rate of oxygen consumption is quickly established.\n\nAt a later time, a compound called oligomycin is introduced into the mitochondrial suspension. Oligomycin is a specific inhibitor that binds to the F_o subunit of the ATP synthase enzyme, effectively blocking the channel through which protons (H+) flow from the intermembrane space back into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nAssuming the mitochondria remain otherwise fully functional, which of the following describes the immediate effects on the rate of oxygen consumption and the magnitude of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane after the addition of oligomycin?\n\nA.

You are challenged to calculate the total energy yield, in molecules of ATP, from one molecule of glucose in a cell with a partially deficient Complex IV of the electron transport chain [@problem_id:1725430]. This comprehensive calculation bridges the gap between a specific molecular impairment and the overall bioenergetic capacity of a cell, a key skill in understanding mitochondrial diseases.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating a rare mitochondrial myopathy. They have identified a point mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that affects the gene encoding a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, also known as Complex IV of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). This structural change impairs the complex's function. Specifically, while the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen is unaffected, the mutation reduces the efficiency of proton pumping. For every pair of electrons that passes through the mutated Complex IV, only one proton is translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas a non-mutated complex would translocate two.\n\nAssume that all other cellular respiratory processes and protein complexes function with their standard efficiencies. For your calculations, use the following established values and simplifying assumptions for a human liver cell:\n- The complete breakdown of one glucose molecule through glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle produces a net total of 10 NADH molecules, 2 FADH2 molecules, and 4 molecules of ATP/GTP through substrate-level phosphorylation.\n- Complex I of the ETC translocates 4 protons per NADH molecule oxidized.\n- Complex III of the ETC translocates 4 protons for every pair of electrons it processes.\n- The ATP synthase complex requires the influx of 4 protons to synthesize and export one molecule of ATP into the cytosol.\n- All NADH molecules produced, whether in the cytosol or the mitochondrial matrix, are equivalent for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nCalculate the maximum theoretical number of ATP molecules that can be generated from the complete aerobic oxidation of one molecule of glucose in a cell carrying this specific mutation.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total ATP yield from one molecule of glucose in a cell with a specific mutation in Complex IV of the electron transport chain. We need to calculate the ATP produced from oxidative phosphorylation with the mutated complex and add it to the ATP produced via substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\nFirst, let's establish the number of protons pumped per electron carrier in a normal, unmutated mitochondrion based on the provided data.\n- For each NADH molecule, electrons pass through Complex I, Complex III, and Complex IV. The total protons pumped are the sum from each complex: $4 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex I) + $4 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex III) + $2 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from a normal Complex IV) = $10 \\text{ H}^{+}$.\n- For each FADH2 molecule, electrons enter at Complex II, which does not pump protons. They then pass through Complex III and Complex IV. The total protons pumped are: $0 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex II) + $4 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex III) + $2 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from a normal Complex IV) = $6 \\text{ H}^{+}$.\n\nThe problem states that ATP synthase requires 4 protons to generate 1 ATP molecule. So, the normal ATP yield per electron carrier (the P/O ratio) would be:\n- For NADH: $\\frac{10 \\text{ H}^{+}}{4 \\text{ H}^{+}/\\text{ATP}} = 2.5 \\text{ ATP}$\n- For FADH2: $\\frac{6 \\text{ H}^{+}}{4 \\text{ H}^{+}/\\text{ATP}} = 1.5 \\text{ ATP}$\n\nNow, we must account for the mutation. The problem states that the mutated Complex IV pumps only 1 proton per electron pair, instead of the usual 2. We must recalculate the total protons pumped for each electron carrier.\n- For each NADH in the mutated cell: $4 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex I) + $4 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex III) + $1 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from mutated Complex IV) = $9 \\text{ H}^{+}$.\n- For each FADH2 in the mutated cell: $0 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex II) + $4 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from Complex III) + $1 \\text{ H}^{+}$ (from mutated Complex IV) = $5 \\text{ H}^{+}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the new ATP yield per electron carrier in the presence of the mutation, using the same ATP synthase requirement of 4 protons per ATP.\n- ATP yield per NADH (mutated): $\\frac{9 \\text{ H}^{+}/\\text{NADH}}{4 \\text{ H}^{+}/\\text{ATP}} = 2.25 \\text{ ATP per NADH}$.\n- ATP yield per FADH2 (mutated): $\\frac{5 \\text{ H}^{+}/\\text{FADH2}}{4 \\text{ H}^{+}/\\text{ATP}} = 1.25 \\text{ ATP per FADH2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule yields 10 NADH molecules and 2 FADH2 molecules that enter the ETC. We can now calculate the total ATP produced via oxidative phosphorylation in the mutated cell.\n- Total ATP from 10 NADH: $10 \\text{ NADH} \\times 2.25 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{NADH}} = 22.5 \\text{ ATP}$.\n- Total ATP from 2 FADH2: $2 \\text{ FADH2} \\times 1.25 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{FADH2}} = 2.5 \\text{ ATP}$.\n- Total ATP from oxidative phosphorylation = $22.5 \\text{ ATP} + 2.5 \\text{ ATP} = 25 \\text{ ATP}$.\n\nFinally, to get the total ATP yield per glucose molecule, we must add the ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation to the amount produced by oxidative phosphorylation. The problem states that 4 ATP/GTP molecules are produced via substrate-level phosphorylation.\n- Total ATP yield per glucose = (ATP from oxidative phosphorylation) + (ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- Total ATP yield per glucose = $25 \\text{ ATP} + 4 \\text{ ATP} = 29 \\text{ ATP}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum theoretical number of ATP molecules generated from the complete aerobic oxidation of one glucose molecule in a cell with this mutation is 29.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{29}$$", "id": "1725430"}]}
