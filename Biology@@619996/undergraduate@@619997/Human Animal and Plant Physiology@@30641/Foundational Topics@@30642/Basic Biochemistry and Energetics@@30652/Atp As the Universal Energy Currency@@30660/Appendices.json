For each molecule of glucose it consumes, it performs alcoholic fermentation.\n\n**Scenario 2:** A primary culture of human cardiac muscle cells is maintained in a well-oxygenated environment. For each molecule of glucose it consumes, it performs complete aerobic respiration.\n\nTo ensure a standardized calculation, you must use the following established parameters and assumptions:\n- The initial breakdown of one glucose molecule via glycolysis yields a net of 2 molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and 2 molecules of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) in the cytoplasm.\n- In the human cells, the high-energy electrons from the cytoplasmic NADH produced during glycolysis are transferred into the mitochondrial matrix via the malate-aspartate shuttle, regenerating NAD+ in the cytoplasm and producing NADH inside the mitochondria.\n- The complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle yields 1 ATP (or an equivalent GTP), 3 NADH, and 1 molecule of Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FADH$_2$).\n- During oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons through the electron transport chain from one molecule of NADH yields 2.5 molecules of ATP, and from one molecule of FADH$_2$ yields 1.5 molecules of ATP.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total net ATP generated per molecule of glucose in the human cardiac cell to the total net ATP generated in the yeast cell.

Therefore, the net ATP per glucose in yeast is\n$$\n\\text{ATP}_{\\text{yeast}}=2.\n$$\n\nIn well-oxygenated human cardiac cells using the malate-aspartate shuttle, glycolysis yields $2$ ATP and $2$ cytosolic NADH that are transferred as $2$ mitochondrial NADH. The two pyruvate produced are converted to two acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase, generating $2$ NADH.

This thought experiment explores the consequences of severing this vital supply line by inhibiting the Adenine Nucleotide Translocase, a critical transporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane. By analyzing the immediate effects in both the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol, you will develop a deeper understanding of metabolic regulation and the interconnectedness of cellular compartments [@problem_id:1693522].", "problem": "The Adenine Nucleotide Translocase (ANT), an antiporter protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is crucial for cellular energy metabolism. It facilitates the exchange of one molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) from the cytosol for one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the mitochondrial matrix. Atractyloside is a potent and specific poison that binds to the ANT, locking it in a conformation that prevents this transport.\n\nConsider a suspension of isolated, actively respiring mitochondria placed in a buffered solution that represents the cytosol. This solution contains all necessary substrates for both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (glucose, inorganic phosphate, ADP, oxygen). At time $t=0$, a dose of atractyloside sufficient to completely inhibit all ANT proteins is added to the suspension.\n\nEvaluate the following four statements describing the immediate metabolic consequences of this inhibition. Which of the statements are correct?\n\nA. In the mitochondrial matrix, the ATP/ADP ratio will rise, leading to feedback inhibition of the Krebs cycle and a decrease in oxygen consumption.\n\nB. In the mitochondrial matrix, the proton-motive force will dissipate rapidly as electron transport continues without coupled ATP synthesis.\n\nC. In the cytosol, the ATP/ADP ratio will fall, leading to allosteric activation of phosphofructokinase-1 and an increased rate of glycolysis.\n\nD. In the cytosol, ATP levels will remain stable, as the increased rate of substrate-level phosphorylation from glycolysis is sufficient to compensate for the loss of mitochondrial ATP.\n\nSelect all correct statements from the list above.", "solution": "The Adenine Nucleotide Translocase (ANT) normally catalyzes the electrogenic exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane:\n$$\\text{ATP}_{m}^{4-} + \\text{ADP}_{c}^{3-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{ATP}_{c}^{4-} + \\text{ADP}_{m}^{3-}.$$\nAtractyloside fixes ANT in the cytosol-facing conformation and sets the ANT flux to zero:\n$$J_{\\text{ANT}} = 0.$$\n\nMatrix consequences:\n- ATP synthase requires matrix ADP:\n$$\\text{ADP}_{m} + P_{i} + nH^{+}_{\\text{ims}} \\to \\text{ATP}_{m} + nH^{+}_{m},$$\nwith the rate $J_{\\text{ATP}} \\propto [\\text{ADP}]_{m}$.

This increases the matrix ATP/ADP ratio, which inhibits key dehydrogenases of the Krebs cycle and lowers flux into the respiratory chain, decreasing oxygen consumption. Thus statement A is correct.\n\n- The proton-motive force is\n$$\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT}{F}\\Delta \\text{pH}.$$\nAt steady state, proton pumping by the electron transport chain satisfies\n$$J_{\\text{pump}} = J_{\\text{ATP}} + J_{\\text{leak}}.$$\nSetting $J_{\\text{ATP}} \\approx 0$ forces $\\Delta p$ to rise until $J_{\\text{pump}}$ is reduced (by backpressure) to match $J_{\\text{leak}}$. Therefore the proton-motive force increases rather than dissipating, and electron transport does not continue at a high rate without ATP synthesis. Thus statement B is incorrect.\n\nCytosolic consequences:\n- The cytosolic ATP balance obeys\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{ATP}]_{c}}{dt} = J_{\\text{gly}} - J_{\\text{ATPases}} + J_{\\text{ANT},m \\to c},$$\nand with atractyloside, $J_{\\text{ANT},m \\to c}=0$.

Phosphofructokinase-1 is allosterically activated by ADP/AMP and inhibited by ATP; hence a fall in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio activates phosphofructokinase-1 and increases glycolytic flux. Thus statement C is correct.\n\n- Although glycolysis can increase and regenerate NAD$^{+}$ via lactate dehydrogenase to support higher rates, substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis (net two ATP per glucose) generally cannot immediately and fully compensate for the loss of mitochondrial ATP production under aerobic, actively respiring conditions. Therefore cytosolic ATP levels do not remain stable; they fall.
