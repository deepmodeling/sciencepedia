The stability of an alpha-helix is primarily maintained by a regular pattern of hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of the amino acid residues. While most amino acids can be readily incorporated into an alpha-helix, the amino acid proline is well-known to be a \"helix breaker,\" meaning its presence within a helical segment is structurally destabilizing.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason for proline's disruptive effect on alpha-helical structures?\n\nA. Proline possesses a large, hydrophobic side chain, which causes significant steric clashes with the side chains of adjacent residues in the tightly packed helical core.\n\nB. Proline's side chain is positively charged at physiological pH, leading to electrostatic repulsion with other residues and destabilizing the uniform charge distribution along the helix.\n\nC. The backbone carbonyl group (C=O) of a proline residue is sterically hindered and cannot act as a hydrogen bond acceptor for another residue in the helix.\n\nD. Proline's side chain is aromatic and preferentially forms pi-stacking interactions with other aromatic residues, which pulls the backbone out of its helical alignment.\n\nE. Proline's side chain is covalently bonded to its own backbone nitrogen atom, which both eliminates the amide hydrogen required for backbone hydrogen bonding and imposes a rigid kink in the polypeptide chain.", "solution": "Goal: Identify the fundamental biochemical reason proline disrupts alpha-helical structure.\n\n1) An alpha-helix is stabilized by a regular pattern of backbone hydrogen bonds where the backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide hydrogen of residue $i+4$. Thus, residues within a helix must be able to (a) present a backbone carbonyl that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor and (b) present a backbone amide hydrogen that can act as a hydrogen bond donor, while adopting the characteristic dihedral angles of the helix.\n\n2) Proline is unique: its side chain forms a ring by covalently bonding to its own backbone nitrogen. After peptide bond formation, this nitrogen is N-substituted and lacks the amide hydrogen. Therefore, a proline at position $i$ cannot donate the backbone N–H hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of residue $i-4$, directly interrupting the $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen-bonding network essential for helix stability.\n\n3) In addition, the cyclic structure of proline imposes restricted backbone dihedral angles (notably a constrained $\\phi$), introducing a rigid kink that is incompatible with the uniform geometry of a long, uninterrupted alpha-helix. This conformational rigidity further destabilizes helical propagation.\n\n4) Evaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: proline is not particularly large compared to common helix-formers (for example, leucine is larger and is helix-friendly); steric clashes of a “large hydrophobic side chain” are not the primary cause.\n- B is incorrect: proline’s side chain is not positively charged at physiological pH in the polypeptide backbone; the amide nitrogen is neutral and lacks a hydrogen.\n- C is incorrect: the backbone carbonyl of proline can still act as a hydrogen bond acceptor; the loss is on the donor side (amide hydrogen).\n- D is incorrect: proline is not aromatic and does not engage in pi-stacking.\n- E is correct: the side chain’s covalent bond to the backbone nitrogen eliminates the amide hydrogen required for backbone hydrogen bonding and imposes a rigid kink, both of which disrupt the helix.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason is captured by option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1744520"}, {"introduction": "Beyond local secondary structures, a protein's overall stability is governed by thermodynamic forces, chief among them the hydrophobic effect which drives nonpolar side chains into the protein's core. This exercise provides a quantitative way to explore this principle, using a simplified thermodynamic model to calculate the energetic cost of introducing a polar residue into this nonpolar environment. By working through this problem, you will see how a single mutation can impact the Gibbs free energy of folding, providing a measurable prediction of protein stability [@problem_id:1744474].", "problem": "A team of bioengineers is studying a thermostable enzyme, CelluMax, critical for the efficient breakdown of cellulose in a new biofuel reactor. The exceptional stability of CelluMax is attributed to its densely packed hydrophobic core.

The precise three-dimensional arrangement of amino acid side chains within an active site creates a chemical microenvironment optimized for a specific reaction. This problem challenges you to think like a biochemist, predicting the functional consequences of mutating a critical catalytic residue and thereby directly connecting the protein's structure to its enzymatic activity [@problem_id:1744455].", "problem": "An engineered enzyme, \"Ligno-lysin,\" is designed for industrial applications to break down lignin, a complex polymer found in plant cell walls. The catalytic mechanism of Ligno-lysin critically depends on a glutamate residue (Glu-182) located deep within its active site. At the optimal pH for the enzyme, the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu-182 acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from a specific water molecule. This deprotonation activates the water, turning it into a potent nucleophile that attacks a key bond in the lignin substrate.\n\nA research team creates a mutant version of Ligno-lysin through site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the glutamate at position 182 with a valine residue (Glu-182-Val). Assuming this single amino acid substitution does not cause the entire protein to misfold, which of the following statements best predicts the functional consequence of this mutation?\n\nA. The enzyme will exhibit a significantly reduced or completely abolished catalytic activity.\n\nB. The enzyme will function more efficiently at highly acidic pH values.\n\nC. The enzyme's substrate specificity will change, allowing it to bind to cellulose instead of lignin.\n\nD. The enzyme will become constitutively active, no longer requiring the substrate to induce a conformational change.\n\nE. The enzyme's catalytic rate will increase due to the smaller size of valine reducing steric hindrance within the active site.", "solution": "First, identify the catalytic role of Glu-182. The problem states that Glu-182 acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from a bound water to generate a more nucleophilic species that attacks a bond in lignin. This is an example of general base catalysis: a side chain with an appropriate $pK_{a}$ is positioned to accept a proton, thereby increasing the nucleophilicity of water and lowering the activation barrier for the chemical step.\n\nNext, analyze the chemical properties of the residues. Glutamate has a carboxylate side chain that can exist as a negatively charged base at the enzyme’s optimal pH, enabling proton abstraction. By contrast, valine is hydrophobic and lacks any ionizable side chain; it cannot participate in general acid-base catalysis. Therefore, replacing Glu-182 with Val removes the general base functionality that is essential for activating water.\n\nThen, infer the mechanistic consequence. Without a general base at the correct position in the active site, the water molecule will not be efficiently deprotonated. As a result, the nucleophilic attack required for bond cleavage in lignin will be severely compromised. In enzymatic terms, the chemical step’s rate constant will drop markedly; thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is expected to be significantly reduced, potentially to a level that appears abolished under typical assay conditions. Although minor residual activity could, in principle, arise from adventitious bases (e.g., other residues or solvent) or altered microenvironments, the dominant and most reliable prediction is a drastic loss of catalytic efficiency.\n\nFinally, evaluate the options:\n- A is consistent with the removal of the essential general base, predicting a significantly reduced or abolished catalytic activity.\n- B is incorrect because substituting glutamate with valine does not introduce a new acid-dependent catalytic mechanism; valine has no titratable side chain, so shifting to highly acidic pH will not restore general base catalysis and may further destabilize the active site.\n- C is unlikely because substrate specificity typically depends on a network of binding interactions; changing a catalytic base to a hydrophobic residue does not plausibly reconfigure the binding pocket to recognize cellulose instead of lignin, and the primary effect here is loss of catalysis.\n- D is incorrect because removing a catalytic requirement does not render the enzyme constitutively active; rather, it removes the key catalytic function.\n- E is incorrect because any reduction in steric bulk is outweighed by the loss of the essential catalytic base; the absence of proton abstraction capability cannot be compensated by reduced steric hindrance.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is that the enzyme’s catalytic activity will be severely reduced or abolished.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1744455"}]}
