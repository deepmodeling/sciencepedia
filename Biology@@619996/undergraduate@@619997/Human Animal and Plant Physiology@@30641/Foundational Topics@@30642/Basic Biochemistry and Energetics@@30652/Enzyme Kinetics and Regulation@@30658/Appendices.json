Uncompetitive would yield parallel lines; non-competitive would intersect on the $x$-axis; substrate inhibition does not produce a simple pair of LB straight lines of the described relationship; irreversible inhibition is not characterized by reversible, well-defined LB line intersections of this type.\n\nTherefore, the inhibitory mechanism is competitive inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1704544"}]}
