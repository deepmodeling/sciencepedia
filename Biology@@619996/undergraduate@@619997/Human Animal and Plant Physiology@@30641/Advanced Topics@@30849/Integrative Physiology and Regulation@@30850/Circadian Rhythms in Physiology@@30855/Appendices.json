Preliminary studies have shown it to be a photoperiodic plant that requires a continuous period of darkness greater than a critical night length of 13 hours to initiate flowering. To further characterize this behavior, a botanist sets up five isolated growth chambers, each containing genetically identical specimens of the plant. The chambers are subjected to the following 24-hour light/dark cycles for several weeks:\n\n*   **Chamber A:** 9 hours of light followed by 15 hours of darkness.\n*   **Chamber B:** 15 hours of light followed by 9 hours of darkness.\n*   **Chamber C:** 9 hours of light followed by 15 hours of darkness. The dark period is interrupted at its midpoint by a brief, intense flash of red light.\n*   **Chamber D:** 9 hours of light followed by 15 hours of darkness. The dark period is interrupted at its midpoint by a brief, intense flash of far-red light.\n*   **Chamber E:** 9 hours of light followed by 15 hours of darkness. The dark period is interrupted at its midpoint by a brief, intense flash of red light which is immediately followed by a brief, intense flash of far-red light.\n\nAssuming that the light flashes are brief enough to be considered instantaneous and that all other growth conditions are optimal, in which of the chambers would the plants be expected to flower?\nYour answer should consist of the letters corresponding to all the chambers where flowering is predicted to occur, concatenated in alphabetical order.

Chamber E", "solution": "We are told the plant is photoperiodic with the requirement that flowering is initiated only if a continuous dark period exceeds a critical night length of $N_{c} = 13$ hours. For a given 24-hour cycle, let $N$ denote the longest uninterrupted dark interval. The flowering condition is:\n$$\nN > N_{c}.\n$$\nLight interruptions during the dark period are evaluated using the phytochrome system: red light converts phytochrome from the inactive form $P_r$ to the active form $P_{fr}$ (i.e., $P_r \\to P_{fr}$ under red), which mimics a light signal and breaks the night, while far-red light converts $P_{fr}$ back to $P_r$ (i.e., $P_{fr} \\to P_r$ under far-red), reversing the effect of a prior red exposure. A brief far-red flash alone during the night does not mimic daytime and does not effectively break the night in short-day (long-night) plants. A red flash followed immediately by far-red leaves phytochrome in the $P_r$ state, effectively undoing the night-break effect of red.\n\nEvaluate each chamber:\n\n- Chamber A: $9$ hours light followed by $15$ hours continuous darkness, so $N = 15$ and $15 > 13$. The continuous night exceeds the critical night length; flowering occurs.\n\n- Chamber B: $15$ hours light followed by $9$ hours darkness, so $N = 9$ and $9 < 13$. The continuous night is too short; no flowering.\n\n- Chamber C: $9$ hours light followed by $15$ hours darkness with a brief red flash at the midpoint. The red flash converts $P_r \\to P_{fr}$ and acts as a light signal, breaking the continuity of darkness into two segments of $7.5$ hours each. Each uninterrupted dark segment is $7.5 < 13$, so the condition $N > 13$ is not met; no flowering.\n\n- Chamber D: Same as A, but with a brief far-red flash at the midpoint. A far-red flash converts $P_{fr} \\to P_r$ and does not mimic daylight; thus the dark period remains effectively continuous. Therefore $N = 15$ and $15 > 13$; flowering occurs.\n\n- Chamber E: Same as A, but with a red flash immediately followed by far-red at the midpoint. The far-red reverses the effect of red, returning the phytochrome to $P_r$, so the dark period is effectively unbroken. Therefore $N = 15$ and $15 > 13$; flowering occurs.\n\nThus, flowering is expected in chambers A, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "1699851"}, {"introduction": "While external cues like light set the rhythm, organisms possess an internal, self-sustaining clock with its own natural period, called the free-running period ($\\tau$).
