Different functional demands lead to specialized fiber types with distinct metabolic and contractile properties. This classic comparative physiology exercise [@problem_id:1742469] uses the familiar example of a turkey's 'dark' and 'white' meat to help you connect a muscle's observable characteristics to its underlying cellular machinery and its primary role in either sustained endurance or brief, powerful bursts of activity.", "problem": "A comparative physiologist is studying the skeletal muscle tissue from a domestic turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo*). It is observed that turkeys, being primarily ground-dwelling birds, use their leg muscles for sustained, low-intensity activities like walking and standing. In contrast, their large breast muscles (pectoralis) are used for very brief, high-intensity bursts of flight, typically to escape perceived threats.\n\nThe physiologist prepares two samples:\n- Sample A: from the dark meat of the leg.\n- Sample B: from the white meat of the breast.\n\nBased on the functional demands of these two muscle groups, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected physiological and biochemical differences between them?\n\nA. Sample A will have a higher concentration of myoglobin and a greater density of mitochondria compared to Sample B.\n\nB. Sample B will primarily rely on aerobic respiration for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production and will have a richer blood supply than Sample A.\n\nC. Sample A will be characterized by fibers with a larger diameter and a higher concentration of stored glycogen for rapid glycolysis compared to Sample B.\n\nD. Sample B will be more resistant to fatigue and contain a higher proportion of slow-twitch fibers than Sample A.\n\nE. Both samples will have nearly identical physiological profiles as they originate from the same animal, and the color difference is primarily due to diet rather than fiber type composition.", "solution": "We identify the functional demands of the two muscle groups. Turkey leg muscles (dark meat) are used for sustained, low-intensity activities such as walking and standing. Such functions are best served by oxidative, fatigue-resistant fibers. These are typically slow-twitch (Type I) or fast oxidative (Type IIa) fibers, which have high myoglobin content, abundant mitochondria, dense capillary supply, and primarily use aerobic respiration. Breast muscles (white meat) are used for brief, high-intensity bursts of flight, which align with fast glycolytic (Type IIb) fibers that rely primarily on anaerobic glycolysis, have low myoglobin content, fewer mitochondria, larger fiber diameters, higher glycogen stores, lower capillary density, and fatigue quickly.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. Sample A (leg, dark meat) will have higher myoglobin and greater mitochondrial density than Sample B (breast, white meat). This matches the oxidative profile of leg muscles versus the glycolytic profile of breast muscles. This statement is correct.\n- B. Sample B will primarily rely on aerobic respiration and have a richer blood supply than Sample A. This is incorrect; white breast muscle relies more on anaerobic glycolysis and has less capillary density.\n- C. Sample A will have larger diameter fibers and higher glycogen for rapid glycolysis compared to Sample B. This is incorrect; those traits describe fast glycolytic fibers typical of breast muscle (Sample B).\n- D. Sample B will be more resistant to fatigue and contain more slow-twitch fibers than Sample A. This is the opposite of observed physiology and is incorrect.\n- E. Both samples will be nearly identical and color differences are due to diet. This is incorrect; color differences reflect myoglobin content linked to fiber type and metabolic profile.\n\nTherefore, only option A accurately describes the expected differences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1742469"}, {"introduction": "Muscle size is not static; it exists in a dynamic equilibrium between protein synthesis and breakdown, a state heavily influenced by hormonal signals. This practice [@problem_id:1742421] introduces a quantitative model to explore how anabolic hormones like testosterone and catabolic hormones like cortisol compete to determine the net protein balance. By calculating this outcome, you will gain insight into the physiological tug-of-war that ultimately dictates whether a muscle will undergo hypertrophy or atrophy.", "problem": "A researcher is developing a simplified model to predict changes in skeletal muscle mass in response to hormonal fluctuations. The model focuses on the Net Protein Balance (NPB), defined as the difference between the rate of Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) and the rate of Muscle Protein Breakdown (MPB).\n\nIn an untrained individual at rest, the protein turnover is in equilibrium, with a baseline MPS rate, $S_0$, equal to the baseline MPB rate, $B_0$. For this model, these baseline rates are both given as $S_0 = B_0 = 1.75$ grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day (g/kg/day).\n\nThe model proposes that the anabolic hormone testosterone primarily influences MPS, while the catabolic hormone cortisol primarily influences MPB. The new rates, $S_{\\text{new}}$ and $B_{\\text{new}}$, are given by the following relations:\n$S_{\\text{new}} = S_0 \\left(1 + \\alpha \\cdot f_T\\right)$\n$B_{\\text{new}} = B_0 \\left(1 + \\beta \\cdot f_C\\right)$\n\nHere, $f_T$ is the fractional change in testosterone concentration from baseline, and $f_C$ is the fractional change in cortisol concentration from baseline.

For the subject being studied, these are determined to be $\\alpha = 0.800$ and $\\beta = 0.450$.\n\nConsider a scenario where the individual undergoes a period of intense resistance training, which is known to elevate testosterone, but simultaneously experiences high levels of psychological stress and sleep deprivation, which elevates cortisol. After this period, measurements indicate that the individual's average testosterone concentration has increased by 25.0% ($f_T = 0.250$), while their average cortisol concentration has increased by 50.0% ($f_C = 0.500$).\n\nUsing the provided model and parameters, calculate the new Net Protein Balance (NPB = $S_{\\text{new}} - B_{\\text{new}}$).

The model considers a single skeletal muscle fiber with an initial cross-sectional area (CSA), $A_0$.
