Two of the most dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut are the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes. Firmicutes are known for their efficiency in extracting energy from food, particularly from fats and simple sugars. Bacteroidetes, on the other hand, are specialists in breaking down complex plant-based carbohydrates, such as dietary fiber, that are otherwise indigestible by human enzymes.\n\nA clinical study participant initially followed a long-term \"Western-style\" diet, characterized by high consumption of processed foods, saturated fats, and simple sugars, with very low intake of dietary fiber. After a baseline measurement of their gut flora, the participant was switched to a whole-foods, plant-based diet rich in complex carbohydrates and high in dietary fiber from sources like legumes, whole grains, and a wide variety of vegetables.\n\nAssuming the participant adheres strictly to the new diet for several months, allowing the gut microbiome to reach a new stable state, what is the most likely long-term change that will be observed in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) in their gut microbiome compared to their baseline measurement?\n\nA. The F/B ratio will significantly increase.\n\nB. The F/B ratio will significantly decrease.\n\nC. The F/B ratio will remain unchanged, as an individual's microbiome composition is genetically determined and stable.\n\nD. Both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes populations will decrease, leading to an unpredictable change in the ratio.\n\nE. The F/B ratio will initially decrease but will gradually return to the original baseline level after a few months of adaptation.", "solution": "Let $F$ denote the relative abundance of Firmicutes and $B$ denote the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. Define the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio as\n$$\nR=\\frac{F}{B}.\n$$\nUnder a long-term Western-style diet, the substrate profile is characterized by high availability of fats and simple sugars and low availability of complex plant polysaccharides (dietary fiber). By ecological selection principles in microbial communities, taxa with metabolic machinery optimized for the dominant substrates increase in relative abundance. Firmicutes are efficient at extracting energy from fats and simple sugars; therefore, under the baseline Western diet, $F$ is favored relative to $B$, leading to a comparatively higher $R$.\n\nAfter switching to a whole-foods, plant-based diet rich in complex carbohydrates and high in dietary fiber, the substrate profile shifts toward complex polysaccharides that are not digested by human enzymes but are metabolized by Bacteroidetes, which specialize in polysaccharide degradation. Over several months, allowing for microbial adaptation and succession to a new steady state, this ecological shift increases $B$ relative to $F$. Consequently, the ratio\n$$\nR=\\frac{F}{B}\n$$\ndecreases because the denominator increases (and the numerator may decrease or increase less), yielding a lower long-term $R$ compared to baseline.\n\nEvaluating the options: an increase in $R$ (A) contradicts the substrate-driven rise in $B$; stability (C) is incorrect because diet is a dominant modulator of microbiome composition; a concurrent decrease of both phyla with an unpredictable ratio (D) is inconsistent with fiber-driven enrichment of Bacteroidetes; reversion to baseline despite sustained diet (E) contradicts the establishment of a new diet-dependent steady state. Therefore, the most likely long-term change is a significant decrease in the F/B ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1710232"}, {"introduction": "Beyond shaping the microbial community, diet also determines the metabolites these microbes produce, which can serve as vital fuel for the host.

A high-fiber diet promotes the growth of gut microbiota that produce butyrate, a Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA). Butyrate is known to be a potent inhibitor of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. By inhibiting HDACs, butyrate increases the level of histone acetylation, which generally leads to a more open chromatin structure and enhanced gene transcription.\n\nThe researcher focuses on the p21 gene, a critical regulator of the cell cycle whose increased expression can lead to cell cycle arrest, a mechanism important for preventing uncontrolled proliferation. The researcher develops a simplified kinetic model for the regulation of p21 transcription:\n\n1.  The rate of transcription of the p21 gene is assumed to be directly proportional to the steady-state fraction of acetylated histone sites, $\\theta_{ac}$, at the gene's promoter.\n2.  The acetylation fraction $\\theta_{ac}$ is determined by the balance between two opposing enzymatic activities: acetylation by Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylation by Histone Deacetylases (HDACs).\n3.  The rate of acetylation is given by $v_{HAT} = k_{HAT}(1-\\theta_{ac})$, and the rate of deacetylation is given by $v_{HDAC} = k_{HDAC}\\theta_{ac}$, where $k_{HAT}$ and $k_{HDAC}$ are the respective effective rate constants.\n4.  Butyrate acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of HDACs. The presence of butyrate at a concentration $[B]$ modifies the HDAC rate constant to an effective value $k'_{HDAC} = \\frac{k_{HDAC}}{1 + [B]/K_I}$, where $K_I$ is the inhibition constant for butyrate.\n\nIn the colon of an individual on a low-fiber diet, the butyrate concentration is negligible. Under these conditions, the cellular machinery is such that the deacetylation rate constant is significantly larger than the acetylation rate constant, with the ratio $\\frac{k_{HDAC}}{k_{HAT}} = 9.00$.\n\nWhen this individual switches to a high-fiber diet, the luminal butyrate concentration rises to a new steady-state value of $[B] = 5.00 \\text{ mM}$.
