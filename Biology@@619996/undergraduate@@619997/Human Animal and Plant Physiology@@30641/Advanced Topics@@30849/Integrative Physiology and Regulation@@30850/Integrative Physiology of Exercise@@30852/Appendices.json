The analysis focuses on the first 15.0 seconds of an all-out effort, such as the final push in a cycling sprint.\n\nThe following physiological parameters for the athlete's active muscle have been determined:\n- At rest, the concentration of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is 5.5 mmol per kg of wet muscle.\n- At rest, the concentration of Phosphocreatine (PCr) is 16.5 mmol per kg of wet muscle. For this model, assume this entire initial pool of high-energy phosphates (both ATP and PCr) is utilized to generate or buffer ATP levels during the 15.0-second effort. This is known as the phosphagen system.\n- During the maximal effort, anaerobic glycolysis is assumed to operate at a constant average rate, producing 1.60 mmol of ATP per kg of muscle per second.\n- The aerobic system (oxidative phosphorylation) also contributes at a constant average rate, producing 0.40 mmol of ATP per kg of muscle per second throughout the effort.\n\nCalculate the relative contribution of anaerobic glycolysis to the total amount of ATP produced during this 15.0-second period.
