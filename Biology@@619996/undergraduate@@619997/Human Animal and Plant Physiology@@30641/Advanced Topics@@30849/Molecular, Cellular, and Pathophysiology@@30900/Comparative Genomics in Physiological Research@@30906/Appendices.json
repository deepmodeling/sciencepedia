CTG | GTC | CAA | TTA | GGC ...`\nDelete the G at the start of `GTC`:\n`... CTG | TCC | AAT | TAG | GC ...`\nThis exactly matches the Selkirk Rex codon progression, including the premature stop at `TAG`.\n- Therefore, the mutation is a single-nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift with altered downstream amino acids and a premature stop codon.\n\nEliminate alternatives:\n- A (silent point mutation) is false because the amino acid changes at and after the fourth codon.\n- B (nonsense point mutation in the sixth codon) is false because changes begin at the fourth codon and reflect a frameshift, not an isolated single-codon substitution.\n- D (missense at the fourth codon only) is false because downstream codons also change and a premature stop appears.\n- E (frameshift by insertion) is inconsistent with the observed pattern that is parsimoniously explained by a deletion of the G starting the fourth codon.\n\nThus, the correct choice is a frameshift due to a single nucleotide deletion producing altered downstream amino acids and a premature stop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1700836"}, {"introduction": "Comparative genomics is not just about identifying differences; it's about reconstructing evolutionary stories. This problem takes you to the frigid waters of the Antarctic to investigate a remarkable adaptation: antifreeze glycoproteins in fish blood. You will act as an evolutionary detective, tasked with identifying the ancestral gene from which this novel function arose. This exercise challenges you to move beyond simple sequence matching and use an evolutionary model to interpret genomic evidence, revealing how gene duplication and modification can pave the way for incredible physiological innovations [@problem_id:1700807].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the adaptation of Antarctic notothenioid fish to their frigid environment. A key adaptation is the presence of Antifreeze Glycoproteins (AFGPs), which prevent the formation of ice crystals in the fish's blood. The primary AFGP gene in the Antarctic toothfish (*Dissostichus mawsoni*) has been sequenced and its structure is well-characterized. It consists of two exons. Exon 1 codes for a signal peptide, which directs the protein to be secreted from the cell. Exon 2 is composed almost entirely of a repeating 9-base-pair sequence that codes for the tri-peptide \"Threonine-Alanine-Alanine\", the functional unit of the antifreeze protein.\n\nScientific consensus holds that this AFGP gene evolved from an ancestral gene for a digestive enzyme, specifically a trypsinogen-like serine protease. This evolutionary event involved the duplication of the ancestral gene, followed by the mutation of an intronic region into the repeating sequence and the deletion of the part of the gene that coded for the protease's active site.\n\nYour task is to identify the most likely ancestral gene for this AFGP from a list of candidate genes found in the genome of a related, non-Antarctic tropical fish, *Tropichthys calidus*. This tropical fish does not possess any AFGP genes. You are provided with the descriptions of five candidate genes from *T. calidus*. Which one is the most plausible evolutionary precursor to the *D. mawsoni* AFGP gene?\n\n**Candidate Genes from *Tropichthys calidus***\n\n*   **A. Gene CAL-A:** A single-exon gene that codes for a fatty acid binding protein involved in lipid transport. Sequence analysis shows less than 10% identity with any part of the *D. mawsoni* AFGP gene.\n\n*   **B. Gene CAL-B:** A large gene with 15 exons that codes for a structural protein, similar to collagen. Its coding sequence contains extensive repeats of a \"Glycine-Proline-X\" motif (where X is any amino acid). Its first exon shows 25% sequence identity with the AFGP's Exon 1.\n\n*   **C. Gene CAL-C:** A gene with 6 exons that codes for a trypsinogen-like serine protease primarily expressed in the pancreas. Its first exon, which codes for a signal peptide, shares 94% sequence identity with Exon 1 of the *D. mawsoni* AFGP gene. The remaining five exons show no significant sequence identity to the AFGP's Exon 2.\n\n*   **D. Gene CAL-D:** A gene cluster that does not code for a protein but instead transcribes a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecule, a core component of the ribosome. It does not have a standard exon-intron structure or codons.\n\n*   **E. Gene CAL-E:** A gene with two exons that codes for a small protein with unknown function. Its Exon 1 has 40% sequence identity with the AFGP's Exon 1. Its Exon 2 is composed of a simple \"Glutamine-Glutamine-Glutamine\" repeat.", "solution": "We aim to identify the most plausible ancestral gene of the Antarctic toothfish AFGP based on the widely accepted evolutionary model: the AFGP originated from a duplication of a trypsinogen-like serine protease gene, followed by (i) retention of a signal peptide in Exon 1 for secretion, (ii) conversion of an intronic region into a 9-base-pair tandem repeat encoding the tri-peptide threonine-alanine-alanine in Exon 2, and (iii) deletion or loss of the protease catalytic domain.\n\nStep 1: Establish necessary criteria for an ancestral precursor based on the model.\n- The ancestral gene should be a trypsinogen-like serine protease, because the AFGP arose from such an enzyme following duplication.\n- Exon 1 should encode a signal peptide and show high sequence identity to the AFGP Exon 1, since the secretory signal was retained.\n- The remaining exons of the protease are not expected to match AFGP Exon 2, because Exon 2 in AFGP originated from an intronic sequence that expanded into tandem repeats; thus, lack of similarity between protease coding exons and AFGP Exon 2 is expected and does not count against candidacy.\n- Expression in a secretory context (e.g., pancreas or liver) is consistent with the ancestral state, since AFGPs are secreted proteins.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each candidate against the criteria.\n- Candidate A (CAL-A): A single-exon fatty acid binding protein, less than 0.10 identity with any part of AFGP. This fails the protease criterion, lacks exon structure consistent with the model, and lacks sequence similarity. Not plausible.\n- Candidate B (CAL-B): A large, collagen-like structural protein with 15 exons and a \"Glycine-Proline-X\" repeat. Although its first exon shows 0.25 identity to AFGP Exon 1, it is not a trypsinogen-like serine protease and its repeat architecture is unrelated to the AFGP repeat origin (which derives from an intron). Not plausible.\n- Candidate C (CAL-C): A 6-exon trypsinogen-like serine protease, primarily expressed in the pancreas. Its first exon, which encodes a signal peptide, shares 0.94 identity with AFGP Exon 1. The remaining exons show no significant identity to AFGP Exon 2. This satisfies the key criteria: correct gene family, secretory signal with very high identity to AFGP Exon 1, and the lack of similarity in other exons aligns with AFGP Exon 2 being derived from an intron rather than a protease coding exon. This matches the established evolutionary scenario.\n- Candidate D (CAL-D): An rRNA gene cluster, non-coding, lacking exon-intron coding structure. This cannot be a precursor for a protein-coding gene. Not plausible.\n- Candidate E (CAL-E): A two-exon small protein gene of unknown function. Exon 1 shows 0.40 identity to AFGP Exon 1, and Exon 2 is a glutamine-repeat region, which does not correspond to the threonine-alanine-alanine coding repeats and does not match the expected origin from a trypsinogen intron. Not plausible relative to a bona fide trypsinogen-like protease with much higher Exon 1 identity.\n\nStep 3: Select the most plausible precursor.\n- Only CAL-C matches the functional class (trypsinogen-like serine protease), genomic architecture (multi-exon with a signal peptide in Exon 1), expression context (pancreas, secretory), and exhibits very high Exon 1 sequence identity to AFGP Exon 1, while the absence of similarity in other exons is expected due to the de novo intronic repeat origin of AFGP Exon 2. Therefore, CAL-C is the most plausible ancestral gene.\n\nNo inconsistencies or mistakes are detected in the problem statement; the data align with the established evolutionary model of AFGP origin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1700807"}, {"introduction": "Identical genomes do not always lead to identical organisms, a puzzle that points to the crucial role of gene regulation.

The analysis focuses on a hypothetical gene, *dynastin-alpha* (*dna-α*), which is suspected to be a key regulator of metabolism and longevity.

Let $p_Q$ be the mean methylation level across all queen samples and $p_W$ be the mean methylation level across all worker samples. The DMS is defined as:\n    $$DMS = JSD(p_Q, p_W) = \\frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_Q || p_M) + \\frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_W || p_M)$$\n    where $p_M = \\frac{p_Q + p_W}{2}$, and $D_{KL}(p_1 || p_2)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence for Bernoulli distributions, given by:\n    $$D_{KL}(p_1 || p_2) = p_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) + (1-p_1) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p_1}{1-p_2}\\right)$$\n    Here, $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm.\n\n3.  **Physiological Relevance ($R_{\\text{phys}}$)**: The regulatory effect of methylation on the *dna-α* gene's function is modeled by a sigmoidal activation curve.
