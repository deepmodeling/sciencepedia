The $HLA$ genes are inherited in large blocks, or haplotypes, following predictable Mendelian rules. This foundational exercise allows you to apply principles of genetics to calculate the probability of a perfect $HLA$ match between siblings, revealing the statistical basis for why family members are such valuable potential donors [@problem_id:1723904].", "problem": "In human genetics, the major histocompatibility complex is a set of genes that code for cell surface proteins essential for the immune system. In humans, this complex is referred to as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. The primary HLA genes are located in a cluster on chromosome 6. Due to their close physical proximity, these genes are typically inherited together as a single block known as a haplotype. Each person inherits one haplotype from their mother and one from their father.\n\nFor a successful organ transplant, it is highly desirable for the donor and recipient to have identical HLA genotypes, which is referred to as a \"perfect match\". Consider a family where the parents are genetically unrelated and, for the purposes of this problem, possess four entirely distinct HLA haplotypes. That is, the mother has two unique haplotypes, and the father has two unique haplotypes, with no haplotypes shared between the parents.\n\nAssuming straightforward Mendelian inheritance and no chromosomal crossover events within the HLA gene cluster, what is the probability that two full siblings within this family will be perfect HLA matches for one another? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let the mother carry two distinct HLA haplotypes $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, and the father carry two distinct haplotypes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. Under Mendelian inheritance without crossover within the HLA cluster, each child independently inherits one maternal haplotype and one paternal haplotype, with\n$$\nP(\\text{inherit } M_{1})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{inherit } M_{2})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{inherit } P_{1})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{inherit } P_{2})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThus, a child’s HLA genotype can be represented as the pair $(M_{i},P_{j})$ with $i,j\\in\\{1,2\\}$, and each of the four combinations occurs with probability\n$$\nP\\big((M_{i},P_{j})\\big)=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nTwo full siblings are a perfect HLA match if and only if they inherit the same maternal haplotype and the same paternal haplotype. Conditioning on the first sibling’s genotype, the probability that the second sibling matches the maternal haplotype is\n$$\nP(\\text{match maternal})=\\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nand independently, the probability that the second sibling matches the paternal haplotype is\n$$\nP(\\text{match paternal})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nBy independence of maternal and paternal transmissions,\n$$\nP(\\text{perfect HLA match})=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, enumerating the four equally likely genotypes $(M_{1},P_{1}), (M_{1},P_{2}), (M_{2},P_{1}), (M_{2},P_{2})$, the probability that two siblings have the same genotype is\n$$\n\\sum_{g} P(G_{1}=g)P(G_{2}=g)=4\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nExpressed as a decimal, this probability is $0.25$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.25}$$", "id": "1723904"}, {"introduction": "Even with a perfect genetic match secured, immediate barriers can lead to catastrophic graft failure.

Individuals with blood type A possess naturally occurring anti-B isohemagglutinins, predominantly immunoglobulin M (IgM), and often some immunoglobulin G (IgG).\n\nState the relevant antigen expression: ABO antigens are expressed not only on red blood cells but also on vascular endothelial cells of solid organs, including the liver. Therefore, upon reperfusion, the recipient’s preformed anti-B antibodies will encounter and bind to ABO B antigens on the graft endothelium.\n\nApply the mechanism of antibody-mediated injury: preformed anti-B antibodies bind to endothelial ABO antigens and activate the classical complement pathway (initiated by C1 binding to antibody-antigen complexes), generating anaphylatoxins (such as C3a and C5a) and the membrane attack complex.

The rate of this T-cell driven response is influenced by a cascade of events, beginning with the physical recovery of the graft itself, including the slow regeneration of lymphatic vessels that carry donor antigens to the recipient's immune system. This advanced problem guides you through the development of a quantitative model to connect these physiological and immunological steps, allowing you to calculate the time it takes for rejection to become clinically significant [@problem_id:1723877].", "problem": "A patient undergoes a kidney transplant. The surgical procedure severs the lymphatic vessels responsible for draining interstitial fluid from the new organ to the recipient's lymph nodes. This disruption is a key factor in the timeline of acute T-cell mediated rejection. To model this process, a simplified biophysical model is proposed.\n\nThe model is based on the following assumptions:\n1.  The regeneration of lymphatic drainage pathways from the graft is slow and, for the initial period relevant to acute rejection, the effective lymphatic drainage rate, $\\Lambda(t)$, increases linearly with time $t$ after surgery: $\\Lambda(t) = \\kappa t$. The time $t$ is measured in days.\n2.  The transplanted kidney contains a large reservoir of donor antigens, resulting in a constant interstitial antigen concentration, $[A]_g$, within the graft. The total rate of antigen flux to the lymph nodes is the product of this concentration and the effective lymphatic drainage rate.\n3.  The rate of generation of activated, graft-specific T-cells, measured in cells per day, is directly proportional to the antigen flux. The constant of proportionality is the immunogenic potential, $\\rho$.\n4.  These activated T-cells migrate to the graft and cause damage. The rate of accumulation of graft damage, measured in Damage Units (DU) per day, is directly proportional to the total number of activated T-cells present at that time. The constant of proportionality is the T-cell cytotoxic potency, $\\sigma$.\n5.  Assume that at the time of transplant ($t=0$), the number of activated graft-specific T-cells is zero and the accumulated damage is zero.\n6.
