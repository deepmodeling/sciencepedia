This ionophore instantly renders the ER membrane fully permeable to $Ca^{2+}$ ions, allowing them to move freely between the ER and the cytosol until a new equilibrium is reached. Assume that the cell is in a calcium-free external medium and that its outer plasma membrane remains completely impermeable to $Ca^{2+}$.

Their hypothesis is that it activates its target cells by binding to a receptor that is coupled to the Phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme. Activation of PLC is known to cause the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The subsequent binding of IP3 to its receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum triggers the release of stored calcium ions (Ca²⁺), leading to an increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration, $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_i$.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the researchers perform an experiment on a population of cultured cells.

SOCs are activated by ER depletion; thus $O$ increases as $E$ falls and remains high when $E$ stays low. However, net $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through SOCs requires a nonzero $C_{ext}$, because $J_{SOC}$ depends on the electrochemical driving force set by $C_{ext}$.\n\nPhase 1 ($0\\leq t\\leq T$): the bath is $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free, so $C_{ext}=0$. Even if $O$ rises as the ER depletes, the driving force for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry via SOCs is absent, giving\n$$\nJ_{SOC}(C_{ext}=0,O)=0.\n$$\nWith SERCA off, the ER cannot sequester cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, so\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt}=-J_{ER\\to cyto}(E)\\;<\\;0,\n$$\nand $E(t)$ decreases monotonically toward depletion.

In parallel, $J_{efflux}(C)$ removes $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to the extracellular medium. Because $C_{ext}=0$, extrusion via PMCA is favored by a steep outward gradient and is nonzero. As $E$ becomes depleted, $J_{ER\\to cyto}(E)\\to 0$, so $\\frac{dC}{dt}\\to -J_{efflux}(C)$ and $C$ tends to decrease toward a low level set by the balance between residual leak and efflux. The net qualitative behavior is a slow, moderate elevation of $C$ driven by ER leak, limited by plasma membrane efflux and the progressive reduction of $J_{ER\\to cyto}(E)$ as the ER empties; there is no large, sustained influx in Phase 1 because $J_{SOC}=0$ when $C_{ext}=0$.\n\nPhase 2 ($t>T$): the bath is switched to high physiological $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, so $C_{ext}$ becomes large. SERCA remains inhibited, so $J_{SERCA}=0$ and the ER cannot refill; therefore $E$ stays low, keeping SOCs activated with high $O$.

Consequently, $C$ rises markedly and remains elevated at a new high quasi-steady state determined by $J_{SOC}=J_{efflux}(C)$, which corresponds to a substantially higher $C$ than the resting level. Because SERCA is inhibited, ER refilling does not occur, SOCs do not close, and the influx is sustained rather than transient.\n\nComparing against the options:\n- A is incorrect because Phase 1 does not maintain strictly resting $C$; ER leak without SERCA reuptake increases $C$.\n- B matches the mechanistic sequence: slow, moderate increase in Phase 1 from ER leak, then a large, sustained SOC-mediated influx in Phase 2 that elevates $C$ dramatically.\n- C is incorrect because Phase 2 is not negligible; it produces a large response, and Phase 1 is not characterized by a rapid spike back to rest when SERCA is off.\n- D is incorrect because Phase 1 is not strictly flat; ER leak elevates $C$ even without extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.\n- E is incorrect because adding extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ does not restore the resting level; it sustains SOC influx in the continued absence of SERCA.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1695984"}]}
