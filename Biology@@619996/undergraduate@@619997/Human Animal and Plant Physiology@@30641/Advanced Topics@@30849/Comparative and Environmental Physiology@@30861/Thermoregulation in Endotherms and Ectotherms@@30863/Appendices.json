When the temperature is lowered from this range to $10^\\circ\\text{C}$, the metabolic rate increases substantially.

The provided data is insufficient to distinguish between a mammal and a reptile.", "solution": "Let $T_{a}$ denote the ambient temperature and $M$ denote the resting metabolic rate (rate of oxygen consumption).\n\nFirst, consider an endotherm (a small placental mammal such as a field mouse). Endotherms defend a relatively constant body temperature $T_{b}$ and exhibit a thermoneutral zone (TNZ), an interval of $T_{a}$ over which resting metabolism is minimal. Within the TNZ,\n$$\nM = M_{\\text{basal}}.\n$$\nBelow the lower critical temperature $T_{\\text{lc}}$ of the TNZ, heat loss increases, and the endotherm elevates metabolism to generate heat. A standard heat-balance model gives an approximately linear increase in resting metabolism with the thermal gradient:\n$$\nM = M_{\\text{basal}} + C\\,(T_{b} - T_{a}), \\quad \\text{for } T_{a} < T_{\\text{lc}},\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the thermal conductance. Above the upper critical temperature $T_{\\text{uc}}$, additional energetic costs arise for active heat dissipation (such as panting or sweating), yielding\n$$\nM > M_{\\text{basal}}, \\quad \\text{for } T_{a} > T_{\\text{uc}}.\n$$\nTherefore, an endotherm shows a U-shaped relation: $M$ is minimal within a moderate $T_{a}$ range (the TNZ) and increases when $T_{a}$ is lowered well below or raised well above that range.\n\nNow consider an ectotherm (a small squamate reptile such as a garter snake). Ectotherms do not maintain $T_{b}$ metabolically; instead, their metabolic rate reflects temperature-dependent biochemical kinetics. A common description is an Arrhenius-type dependence:\n$$\nM(T) = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $T$ is absolute temperature, $E_{a}$ is an activation energy, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $A$ is a pre-exponential factor. Over ecological temperature ranges, this is often summarized by a $Q_{10}$ relationship:\n$$\nM(T) = M(T_{0})\\, Q_{10}^{\\frac{T - T_{0}}{10}},\n$$\nwith $Q_{10} > 1$, implying a monotonic, approximately exponential increase of $M$ with $T$. Consequently, at low $T_{a}$ (for example, near $10^\\circ\\text{C}$), $M$ is extremely low, and as $T_{a}$ increases toward warmer values (for example, toward $40^\\circ\\text{C}$), $M$ increases steeply.\n\nMatch the observations to these principles. Species X shows a minimal metabolic rate between $28^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $32^\\circ\\text{C}$, with substantial increases both when cooled to $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ and when warmed to $40^\\circ\\text{C}$. This is the hallmark of an endotherm with a TNZ bracketed by lower and upper critical temperatures. Species Y shows extremely low metabolism at $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ and a consistent, approximately exponential rise as $T_{a}$ increases to $40^\\circ\\text{C}$, which is the hallmark of an ectotherm governed by temperature-dependent biochemical kinetics.\n\nTherefore, Species X is the mammal (field mouse), and Species Y is the reptile (garter snake). This identification rules out options B, C, D, and contradicts E, since the data are sufficient to distinguish endothermy from ectothermy.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1890909"}, {"introduction": "While endotherms enjoy the advantage of a stable internal temperature, this stability comes at a significant energetic price, especially in the cold. This exercise provides a quantitative look at the energy budget of an endotherm, requiring you to calculate the portion of its total metabolic rate dedicated solely to generating heat below its thermoneutral zone.
