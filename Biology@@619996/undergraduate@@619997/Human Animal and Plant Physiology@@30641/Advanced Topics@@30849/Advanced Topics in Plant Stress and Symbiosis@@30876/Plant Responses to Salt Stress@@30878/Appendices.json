Species A is a halophyte, a plant adapted to grow in high-salinity environments. Species B is a glycophyte, a plant that is sensitive to salt. The rate of $K^+$ uptake for both species is described by the following equation:\n$$V_{K^+} = \\frac{V_{max, K^+} [K^+]_{ext}}{K_{m, K^+} \\left(1 + \\frac{[Na^+]_{ext}}{K_{i, Na^+}}\\right) + [K^+]_{ext}}$$\nwhere:\n- $V_{max, K^+}$ is the maximum rate of $K^+$ uptake.\n- $[K^+]_{ext}$ is the external concentration of potassium ions.\n- $[Na^+]_{ext}$ is the external concentration of sodium ions.\n- $K_{m, K^+}$ is the Michaelis constant for $K^+$, representing the transporter's affinity for potassium.\n- $K_{i, Na^+}$ is the inhibition constant for $Na^+$, representing the transporter's affinity for the competing sodium ion. A lower $K_{i, Na^+}$ indicates stronger competition from $Na^+$.\n\nThe kinetic parameters for the primary $K^+$ transporter in the roots of each species are as follows:\n\nFor the salt-tolerant Species A:\n- $K_{m, K^+} = 1.2 \\text{ mM}$\n- $K_{i, Na^+} = 60.0 \\text{ mM}$\n\nFor the salt-sensitive Species B:\n- $K_{m, K^+} = 1.2 \\text{ mM}$\n- $K_{i, Na^+} = 4.0 \\text{ mM}$\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that $V_{max, K^+}$ is the same for both species.\n\nTo quantify the plant's ability to sustain potassium uptake under salt stress, we define the Potassium Uptake Maintenance Ratio (PUMR).

The Na^{+}/H^{+} antiporter in the tonoplast is energized by the proton motive force generated by vacuolar $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-ATPase and $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$-pyrophosphatase, not by catalase.
