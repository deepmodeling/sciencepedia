Strawberry: Intracellular ice crystal formation ruptures organelles.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biophysical mechanisms for low-temperature injury by distinguishing chilling injury (above the freezing point of cellular water) from freezing injury (below the freezing point).\n\nFor the banana at $5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- The temperature is above $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so liquid water persists in cells and ice crystals do not form under normal conditions.\n- Tropical species such as banana are chilling-sensitive. The primary mechanism is chilling injury, where membrane lipids undergo a phase transition from a liquid-crystalline to a gel state as temperature falls below the lipid's transition temperature. This reduces membrane fluidity, disrupts membrane protein function (including ion pumps and channels), and increases permeability, causing ion leakage and impaired transport. Therefore, the correct mechanism for the banana is loss of membrane fluidity with resultant leakage and transport impairment.\n\nFor the strawberry at $-5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- The temperature is below $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so freezing occurs. In temperate, frost-adapted plants, the typical and adaptive response is extracellular ice formation in the apoplast. Ice has a lower water potential than liquid water, so a chemical potential gradient drives water efflux from the symplast to the apoplast, leading to cellular dehydration and plasmolysis. This extracellular freezing-induced dehydration is the primary mechanism of freezing injury in frost-hardy tissues; intracellular ice formation is generally catastrophic and is usually avoided in such species unless conditions are extreme or cooling is too rapid.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Options that invoke ice formation in the banana at $5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (A, C) are incorrect.\n- Options that invoke intracellular ice as primary in the strawberry (E) are inconsistent with frost tolerance mechanisms; the primary mechanism is extracellular ice and dehydration.\n- Metabolic explanations (D) are not the primary biophysical causes of the observed damage under these temperatures.\n\nThus, the most accurate pair is: banana—membrane fluidity loss and leakage; strawberry—extracellular ice formation causing severe cellular dehydration, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733933"}, {"introduction": "To survive sub-zero temperatures, frost-tolerant plants avoid lethal intracellular freezing by allowing ice to form in the extracellular space.

This process allows pure water ice crystals to form exclusively in the extracellular spaces (apoplast). As external ice forms, water osmotically exits the cells until the intracellular solution reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with the external ice.\n\nProtocol B (Flash Freezing): The tissue is frozen almost instantaneously. This rapid cooling causes water to freeze in situ, both inside and outside the cells, before any significant net movement of water across the cell membrane can occur.\n\nAssuming the intracellular solutes behave as an ideal, non-volatile solute mixture in water, calculate the ratio of the final effective molal concentration of solutes in a cell subjected to Protocol A to the initial effective molal concentration, $C_{initial}$.
