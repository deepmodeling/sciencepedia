This first practice problem uses a hypothetical grafting scenario to explore the source of the strigolactone signal that controls shoot architecture. By predicting the outcome when a mutant shoot is supplied by a wild-type root system, you will solidify your understanding of strigolactones as systemic, root-derived inhibitors of bud growth [@problem_id:1743477].", "problem": "In plant developmental biology, a class of hormones known as Strigolactones (SLs) plays a crucial role in regulating plant architecture. One of their primary functions is to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds, thus suppressing the formation of lateral shoots and controlling the overall extent of branching. In a typical plant, these hormones are synthesized predominantly in the root system and are then transported upwards through the vasculature to the aerial parts of the plant, including the stem and axillary buds.\n\nConsider a species of plant for which two lines exist: a wild-type (WT) line, which exhibits a normal, regulated branching pattern, and a mutant line, which we will call `sl-syn`. The `sl-syn` mutant has a defect in a key gene for Strigolactone biosynthesis, rendering it incapable of producing its own SLs. As a result, ungrafted `sl-syn` plants display a phenotype of excessive, uncontrolled shoot branching.\n\nAn experiment is performed where a shoot cutting, known as the scion, is taken from an `sl-syn` mutant plant and is grafted onto the root system, known as the rootstock, of a WT plant. The graft union is successful, and the composite plant is allowed to grow.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes best describes the shoot branching phenotype that will be observed in the `sl-syn` mutant scion as the composite plant matures?\n\nA. The scion will exhibit excessive shoot branching, identical to an ungrafted `sl-syn` mutant plant.\n\nB. The scion will exhibit a normal branching pattern, identical to a wild-type (WT) plant.\n\nC. The scion will grow for a short period and then die due to a long-term incompatibility between the mutant and wild-type tissues.\n\nD. The scion will exhibit an extreme suppression of branching, growing as a single, unbranched stem.\n\nE. The branching of the scion will be normal, but the WT rootstock will develop an unusually large and dense root system to compensate for the mutant scion.", "solution": "Principle: Strigolactones (SLs) are synthesized mainly in roots, move acropetally through the vasculature, and inhibit axillary bud outgrowth in shoots. Therefore, SL action on shoot branching can be supplied non-locally by root-derived hormone.\n\nGenetic context: The `sl-syn` mutant is defective in SL biosynthesis but not necessarily in SL perception or signaling. Biosynthesis mutants typically retain responsiveness to exogenous or transported SLs; hence their phenotype can be complemented by supplying SL from another tissue.\n\nGraft setup: A `sl-syn` scion is grafted onto a WT rootstock. The WT rootstock produces SLs at normal levels. These SLs are transported upwards into the scion via the xylem.\n\nExpected outcome: Because the scion’s defect is in synthesis and the WT rootstock supplies the hormone, the scion receives sufficient SL to suppress axillary bud outgrowth to wild-type levels. Thus, the scion’s branching phenotype is rescued to normal.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because excessive branching would persist only if SL could not be supplied or if the scion were defective in perception/signaling; here the defect is in synthesis and transport is intact.\n- C is incorrect because WT and mutant tissues are generally graft-compatible in such experiments.\n- D is unlikely because WT-derived SL levels regulate within physiological ranges; mere grafting does not cause supra-physiological suppression beyond WT.\n- E is unrelated to the SL-specific shoot branching phenotype; the question centers on shoot branching, and WT roots do not necessarily overproliferate to compensate for a biosynthesis-defective scion.\n\nTherefore, the scion will exhibit a normal WT-like branching pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743477"}, {"introduction": "Strigolactones are fascinating because they function both internally as hormones regulating plant development and externally as signals to beneficial soil microbes. This exercise challenges you to disentangle these two distinct roles by comparing the phenotypes of a synthesis mutant with a perception mutant. Analyzing their respective effects on shoot branching and mycorrhizal symbiosis will deepen your understanding of the crucial difference between producing a signal and being able to respond to it [@problem_id:1743473].", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating the function of a class of hormones called Strigolactones (SLs) in pea plants. SLs are known to be involved in regulating plant architecture and in facilitating symbiotic relationships with soil microbes. The biologist prepares an experiment using three distinct genotypes:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):** A normal pea plant that synthesizes and responds to SLs correctly.\n2.  **`sl-syn` mutant:** A mutant that is deficient in a key enzyme for SL biosynthesis, rendering it unable to produce any SLs.\n3.  **`sl-d14` mutant:** A mutant that produces SLs normally but lacks a functional D14 receptor protein, which is essential for the plant to perceive and initiate a response to SLs within its own cells.\n\nAll three genotypes are grown from seed under identical conditions in pots containing sterile soil that has been inoculated with spores of an Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungus. AM fungi are known to form a beneficial symbiosis with plant roots, a process which is initiated by chemical signals exuded from the roots. After several weeks of growth, the biologist plans to assess two key characteristics: (1) the degree of shoot branching, and (2) the percentage of root length that has been successfully colonized by the AM fungus.\n\nBased on the established dual roles of strigolactones as both internal hormones and external signaling molecules for symbiosis, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. Both the `sl-syn` and `sl-d14` mutants will show increased shoot branching compared to the WT. AM fungal colonization will be severely reduced in the `sl-d14` mutant but will be similar to WT levels in the `sl-syn` mutant.\n\nB. Both the `sl-syn` and `sl-d14` mutants will show increased shoot branching compared to the WT. AM fungal colonization will be severely reduced in the `sl-syn` mutant, while the `sl-d14` mutant will show colonization levels comparable to the WT.\n\nC. The `sl-syn` mutant will show increased shoot branching, but the `sl-d14` mutant will have branching similar to the WT. Both mutants will show severely reduced AM fungal colonization compared to the WT.\n\nD. Both the `sl-syn` and `sl-d14` mutants will show branching and AM fungal colonization levels that are indistinguishable from the WT, suggesting that other hormonal pathways fully compensate for these specific genetic defects.\n\nE. The `sl-d14` mutant will show increased shoot branching, while the `sl-syn` mutant will have branching similar to the WT. AM fungal colonization would be expected to be normal in both mutants.", "solution": "We first state the two distinct roles of strigolactones (SLs) grounded in established plant physiology:\n- As internal hormones, SLs inhibit axillary bud outgrowth and thus suppress shoot branching. This endogenous signaling requires both SL biosynthesis and perception via the D14 receptor in plant cells.\n- As external rhizosphere signals, SLs are exuded by roots and perceived by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to stimulate hyphal branching and initiate symbiosis. This step depends on SL production and exudation by the plant but does not require the plant’s D14 receptor for the fungus to respond.\n\nPredictions for shoot branching:\n- In the wild type (WT), SLs are synthesized and perceived via D14, so axillary bud outgrowth is inhibited and branching remains relatively low.\n- In the sl-syn mutant, SL biosynthesis is abolished; therefore, no endogenous SL signal reaches D14. Even with a functional D14 receptor, the absence of ligand means the SL pathway is inactive. By the principle that SLs suppress branching, loss of SLs leads to increased shoot branching.\n- In the sl-d14 mutant, SLs are synthesized normally, but the D14 receptor is nonfunctional. Endogenous SL signals cannot be perceived, which phenocopies loss of SL signaling. Thus, shoot branching is increased, similar to SL biosynthetic mutants.\n\nPredictions for AM fungal colonization:\n- Initiation of AM symbiosis requires SL exudation from roots to the soil, where the fungus perceives these molecules to undergo hyphal branching and host seeking. The fungal response depends on the presence of SLs in the rhizosphere; plant D14 is not required for the fungus to perceive SLs.\n- In WT, SL exudation is normal; AM colonization is high.\n- In sl-syn, SLs are not produced, so there is negligible or severely reduced SL exudation. The AM fungus receives little to no exogenous SL signal; hence colonization is severely reduced.\n- In sl-d14, SL production and exudation are normal because biosynthesis is intact. Although plant endogenous perception is defective, the external SL signal to the fungus remains. Therefore, AM colonization is expected to be similar to WT.\n\nCombining these outcomes:\n- Both sl-syn and sl-d14 show increased shoot branching relative to WT.\n- AM colonization is severely reduced in sl-syn but similar to WT in sl-d14.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743473"}, {"introduction": "Beyond studying genetic mutations, scientists often use chemical tools to probe the function of specific proteins within a signaling pathway. This thought experiment introduces a hypothetical molecule that acts as a competitive antagonist, binding to the strigolactone receptor $D14$ without activating it. By determining the effect of this molecular \"blocker\" on plant development, you can connect the macroscopic phenotype of branching directly to the molecular event of receptor activation and signaling [@problem_id:1743495].", "problem": "In many higher plants, the degree of shoot branching is controlled by a class of hormones called strigolactones (SLs). The canonical signaling pathway for SLs, which acts to suppress the outgrowth of axillary buds, can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  A strigolactone molecule binds to the active site of a receptor protein known as DWARF14 (D14).\n2.  This binding event activates D14, causing it to recruit an F-box protein called MAX2.\n3.  The activated D14-MAX2 complex then targets a family of transcriptional repressor proteins, known as SMXLs, for degradation via the cellular proteasome system.\n4.  The degradation of these SMXL proteins ultimately leads to the inhibition of shoot branching.\n\nImagine a plant biologist synthesizes a new compound, Molecule Y. This molecule is designed to have a very high affinity for the D14 receptor's active site. However, upon binding, Molecule Y fails to induce the necessary conformational change in D14 required for it to interact with MAX2. A wild-type plant is continuously treated with a high concentration of Molecule Y, sufficient to saturate most of the D14 receptors.\n\nCompared to an untreated wild-type plant, what would be the expected shoot branching phenotype of the plant treated with Molecule Y?\n\nA. The plant will exhibit an increased number of branches (a hyper-branched or \"bushy\" phenotype).\n\nB. The plant will exhibit a decreased number of branches (a hypo-branched or \"unbranched\" phenotype).\n\nC. The plant's branching pattern will show no significant difference.\n\nD. All axillary buds will be immediately activated, leading to a chaotic and unsustainable growth form.\n\nE. The plant will cease all growth in the shoots but continue normal root development.", "solution": "We first formalize the canonical strigolactone (SL) pathway provided. Let $D14$ denote the receptor, $SL$ the endogenous strigolactone ligand, $MAX2$ the F-box partner, and $SMXL$ the transcriptional repressors. The pathway is:\n1. $SL$ binds $D14$ to form an active complex, which we denote $D14^{\\ast}$.\n2. $D14^{\\ast}$ recruits $MAX2$.\n3. The $D14^{\\ast}\\text{-}MAX2$ complex targets $SMXL$ proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation.\n4. Reduced $SMXL$ levels lead to inhibition of shoot branching.\n\nTherefore, active SL signaling reduces branching, whereas loss or attenuation of SL signaling increases branching.\n\nNow consider Molecule Y with the following properties:\n- It binds the active site of $D14$ with very high affinity.\n- Upon binding, it fails to induce the conformational change required for $D14$ to interact with $MAX2$.\nThus, the $D14\\!:\\!Y$ complex is inactive with respect to downstream signaling.\n\nLet the binding equilibria be:\n$$\nD14 + SL \\rightleftharpoons D14\\!:\\!SL,\\quad K_{d,SL}=\\frac{[D14][SL]}{[D14\\!:\\!SL]},\n$$\n$$\nD14 + Y \\rightleftharpoons D14\\!:\\!Y,\\quad K_{d,Y}=\\frac{[D14][Y]}{[D14\\!:\\!Y]}.\n$$\nLet the total receptor concentration be $[D14]_{T}=[D14]+[D14\\!:\\!SL]+[D14\\!:\\!Y]$. The fractional occupancies are\n$$\n\\theta_{SL}=\\frac{[D14\\!:\\!SL]}{[D14]_{T}}=\\frac{[SL]/K_{d,SL}}{1+[SL]/K_{d,SL}+[Y]/K_{d,Y}},\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{Y}=\\frac{[D14\\!:\\!Y]}{[D14]_{T}}=\\frac{[Y]/K_{d,Y}}{1+[SL]/K_{d,SL}+[Y]/K_{d,Y}}.\n$$\nGiven the treatment condition states a high concentration of Molecule Y sufficient to saturate most receptors, we have $[Y]/K_{d,Y}\\gg 1$, which implies\n$$\n\\theta_{SL}\\approx 0,\\quad \\theta_{Y}\\approx 1.\n$$\nBecause $D14\\!:\\!Y$ is inactive (no conformational change, no $MAX2$ recruitment), the fraction of receptors in the active state $D14^{\\ast}$ is approximately $\\theta_{SL}\\approx 0$. Consequently, the rate of $SMXL$ degradation, which depends on $D14^{\\ast}\\text{-}MAX2$, is strongly reduced. $SMXL$ proteins therefore accumulate.\n\nFrom the pathway logic, accumulation of $SMXL$ leads to reduced inhibition of branching (i.e., branching is promoted). Thus, relative to an untreated wild-type plant, the plant treated with Molecule Y will exhibit an increased number of branches (a hyper-branched phenotype).\n\nThis outcome corresponds to the behavior of a competitive antagonist at the $D14$ receptor: it occupies the receptor without activating signaling, thereby blocking endogenous $SL$ action and phenocopying reduced SL signaling.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1743495"}]}
