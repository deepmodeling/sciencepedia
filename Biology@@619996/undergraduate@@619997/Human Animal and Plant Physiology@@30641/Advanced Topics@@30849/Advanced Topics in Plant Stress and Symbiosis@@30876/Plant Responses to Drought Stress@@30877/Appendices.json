Water does not simply \"soak\" into roots; it moves along a gradient of potential energy, a concept captured by water potential ($\\Psi_w$). This exercise [@problem_id:1733669] provides a practical application of the water potential equation, allowing you to calculate the water potential within a root cell and compare it to the surrounding soil. By mastering this calculation, you will grasp the essential driving force that governs a plant's ability to acquire water, the very first challenge it faces in a drying environment.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is investigating the mechanisms of drought tolerance in maize (*Zea mays*). The study focuses on the movement of water from the soil into the plant's root cells. Water movement is governed by water potential ($\\Psi_w$), which is the sum of the solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) and the pressure potential ($\\Psi_p$). The governing equation is $\\Psi_w = \\Psi_s + \\Psi_p$.\n\nDuring a period of moderate drought, the physiologist measures the water potential of the soil surrounding the maize roots to be $\\Psi_{w, \\text{soil}} = -0.9$ megapascals (MPa). A representative cortex cell in a root hair is analyzed and found to have a solute potential of $\\Psi_{s, \\text{cell}} = -1.2$ MPa.

Abscisic acid (ABA) is the primary chemical messenger for drought stress, but its effects can seem paradoxical. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1733654] delves into how a single hormone can simultaneously halt shoot growth to conserve water, while also promoting root growth to find more. Grappling with this question will deepen your understanding of dose-dependent responses and differential tissue sensitivity, key principles that explain how organisms can fine-tune their strategy for survival.", "problem": "In response to water-deficit conditions, plants produce the hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA), which orchestrates a variety of physiological adaptations. A well-documented, yet seemingly paradoxical, response in the early stages of drought stress is that ABA simultaneously inhibits the growth of the shoot system (stems and leaves) while promoting the continued elongation of the root system. This allows the plant to reduce water loss from transpiration while concurrently exploring a larger volume of soil for water.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for how a single hormone, ABA, can produce these opposite growth effects in the shoot and root systems at the same time?\n\nA. Root cells are significantly less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of ABA than shoot cells. The systemic concentration of ABA that is high enough to inhibit shoot growth falls within a range that is optimal for promoting root cell elongation.\n\nB. ABA is selectively transported to and accumulated in the shoot system, leading to high inhibitory concentrations, while a barrier mechanism at the root-shoot junction actively prevents its entry into the root system.\n\nC. The shoot and root systems possess fundamentally different classes of ABA receptors. Receptors in the shoot are uniquely configured to trigger growth inhibition upon binding ABA, whereas receptors in the root are uniquely configured to trigger growth promotion.\n\nD. ABA's primary role is to lower the water potential in all plant tissues. This effect is more pronounced in the shoots, directly halting cell turgor and expansion, while roots can override this effect by actively absorbing solutes from the soil.\n\nE. ABA is synthesized exclusively in the leaves in response to desiccation. Its concentration is highest in the shoots, causing inhibition, and becomes progressively diluted as it is transported downwards, reaching a low, growth-promoting concentration in the roots.", "solution": "Define the systemic ABA concentration under early drought as $c$. Let the shoot growth response be $G_{\\text{shoot}}(c)$ and the root growth response be $G_{\\text{root}}(c)$, where larger values indicate faster elongation. Empirical plant physiology establishes two key principles relevant here:\n1) Tissue-specific dose-response: $G_{\\text{shoot}}(c)$ is predominantly monotonic decreasing across physiologically relevant $c$; that is, $G_{\\text{shoot}}^{\\prime}(c)<0$, reflecting the well-known ABA inhibition of shoot growth. In contrast, $G_{\\text{root}}(c)$ is biphasic: at low to moderate $c$, ABA promotes root elongation (i.e., $G_{\\text{root}}^{\\prime}(c)>0$), but at at higher $c$ it inhibits it (i.e., $G_{\\text{root}}^{\\prime}(c)<0$). This yields an intermediate $c_{\\text{root,opt}}$ at which root elongation is maximal and an inhibitory threshold $c_{\\text{root,inh}}$ above which root growth is suppressed.\n2) Differential sensitivity: The shoot exhibits a lower inhibitory threshold $c_{\\text{shoot,inh}}$ than the root, i.e., $c_{\\text{shoot,inh}}<c_{\\text{root,inh}}$. Under early drought, $c$ typically satisfies $c_{\\text{shoot,inh}}\\leq c<c_{\\text{root,inh}}$, so the same systemic ABA level inhibits $G_{\\text{shoot}}$ while placing $G_{\\text{root}}$ in its promotive window near $c_{\\text{root,opt}}$.\n\nMechanistically, this dose- and tissue-dependent behavior arises from differences in sensitivity and network wiring (expression patterns of PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, PP2C phosphatases, SnRK2 kinases) and crosstalk with auxin, ethylene, and gibberellin pathways, not from fundamentally distinct receptor classes or a unidirectional transport barrier. Thus, a single hormone can cause opposite outcomes because tissues have different dose-response curves and thresholds to the same ligand concentration.\n\nEvaluate the options against these principles:\n- A matches the established biphasic, concentration-dependent promotion of roots at low to moderate ABA and the higher inhibitory threshold in roots than shoots. It correctly explains opposite outcomes at the same systemic $c$ via differential sensitivity and nonlinearity in $G_{\\text{root}}(c)$ versus $G_{\\text{shoot}}(c)$.\n- B is incorrect because ABA is synthesized in both roots and shoots and is transported bidirectionally via xylem and phloem; there is no barrier preventing ABA entry into roots under drought.\n- C is misleading: while receptor and signaling component expression differs by tissue, plants do not possess fundamentally different ABA receptor classes that are uniquely pro-growth in roots and anti-growth in shoots; rather, the same core PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C-SnRK2 module operates with tissue-specific sensitivities and downstream targets.\n- D is incomplete/incorrect: ABA does modulate osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure, but the opposite growth outcomes are not primarily explained by a uniform lowering of water potential overridden only in roots; the key determinant is dose-dependent and tissue-specific signaling leading to differential cell expansion and division control.\n- E is incorrect: ABA is not synthesized exclusively in leaves; roots also synthesize ABA under drought, and the explanation by simple dilution from leaves to roots does not account for the observed biphasic response and differential sensitivity.\n\nTherefore, A provides the most accurate and complete explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1733654"}, {"introduction": "A plant's ability to survive drought is not only about immediate responses but is also etched into its very anatomy through evolution. The xylem, the plant's water-conducting plumbing, is a prime example of this adaptation, facing a critical trade-off between transport efficiency and safety from air bubbles (embolism) under tension. This exercise [@problem_id:1733655] invites you to build a quantitative model based on physical principles to explore how the structure of xylem vessels differs between plants adapted to dry versus wet climates. By exploring the relationship between vessel size, density, and overall hydraulic conductance, you will uncover the elegant biophysical solutions that evolution has engineered to balance risk and reward in water transport.", "problem": "To understand the functional trade-offs in plant water transport, we can model the xylem tissue of a plant stem as a collection of parallel cylindrical pipes (vessels).
