{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Complex signaling pathways often rely on \"master regulator\" proteins that act as switches. In Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), the NPR1 protein is this crucial switch, and its location within the cell determines whether the plant's defenses are on or off. This problem presents a thought experiment with a specific mutation to probe the importance of NPR1's journey into the nucleus, a non-negotiable step for activating the defense response [@problem_id:1739588].", "problem": "Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) is a crucial plant defense mechanism that provides long-lasting, broad-spectrum immunity throughout the plant following an initial localized pathogen attack. The signaling pathway for SAR is initiated by the accumulation of the signaling molecule salicylic acid (SA). In a healthy, uninfected plant cell, a key regulatory protein called NPR1 exists as an inactive polymer (oligomer) in the cytoplasm, held together by disulfide bonds. When SA levels rise due to a pathogen infection, it triggers a change in the cell's redox potential. This change causes the reduction of the disulfide bonds, leading to the dissociation of the NPR1 oligomer into active monomers. These NPR1 monomers then translocate into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, NPR1 monomers interact with TGA transcription factors, which then bind to the promoters of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) genes, activating their transcription. The resulting PR proteins are the effectors that establish the state of SAR.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered plant line that expresses a mutant version of the NPR1 protein. This mutation prevents the NPR1 oligomer from dissociating into monomers, effectively trapping the protein as an inactive complex in the cytoplasm, regardless of the cellular SA concentration or redox state.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the consequence of this mutation on the plant's ability to mount a SAR response?\n\nA. The SAR response will be permanently and strongly activated, as the trapped NPR1 complex constantly signals for defense.\n\nB. The plant will be unable to mount a SAR response because the activation of PR genes will be blocked.\n\nC. The SAR response will be significantly delayed but will eventually reach full strength through alternative pathways.\n\nD. The plant will only be able to mount a localized defense response in the initially infected tissues, but the systemic signal will be lost.\n\nE. The production of salicylic acid will be completely halted, preventing any part of the defense cascade from initiating.", "solution": "In uninfected cells, NPR1 exists as an oligomer held by disulfide bonds and is inactive in the cytoplasm. Upon pathogen infection, salicylic acid accumulates and alters the cellular redox state, reducing the disulfide bonds so that NPR1 oligomers dissociate into monomers. These NPR1 monomers translocate to the nucleus, interact with TGA transcription factors, and enable transcription of PR genes, which are required to establish SAR.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, NPR1 cannot dissociate into monomers regardless of salicylic acid level or redox state. Therefore:\n1) NPR1 remains in the cytoplasm as an inactive oligomer and cannot enter the nucleus.\n2) Without nuclear NPR1 monomers, TGA factors cannot activate PR gene transcription in either local or systemic tissues via the SA–NPR1 pathway.\n3) As PR gene induction is a defining and necessary hallmark of SAR, the SAR response cannot be mounted.\n\nAlthough other defense pathways (for example, jasmonic acid or ethylene related pathways) may mediate some defenses, the SA–NPR1-dependent PR gene activation central to SAR is blocked. The systemic signal may still be produced, but the downstream transcriptional response requiring NPR1 cannot occur. Thus the most accurate statement is that the plant will be unable to mount a SAR response because PR gene activation is blocked.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because trapping NPR1 as an inactive oligomer prevents, rather than constitutively activates, signaling.\n- B is correct because PR gene activation via NPR1 is blocked, preventing SAR.\n- C is incorrect because NPR1 is essential for SA-dependent SAR; alternative pathways do not restore full SAR.\n- D is less accurate than B because it implies loss of systemic signal generation, whereas the defect is in response execution due to NPR1 inactivity.\n- E is incorrect because SA biosynthesis is upstream and not directly affected by the NPR1 mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1739588"}, {"introduction": "Building on the role of NPR1 in receiving the defense signal, this practice explores how scientists can experimentally separate the act of sending a signal from receiving it. Using the classic technique of grafting, we can create a chimeric plant with different genetic properties in its shoots and roots [@problem_id:1739570]. This exercise demonstrates the elegant logic used in experimental biology to dissect long-distance communication pathways within an organism.", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), a whole-plant defense response triggered by a localized pathogen infection. In this response, a signal is generated in the infected \"primary\" leaves, travels throughout the plant, and \"primes\" distant, uninfected \"systemic\" tissues to resist subsequent infections. It is well-established that the protein NPR1 (NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1) is essential for a cell to perceive this systemic signal and activate defense gene expression. A mutant plant lacking a functional NPR1 protein, denoted as an *npr1* mutant, can produce the systemic signal but cannot respond to it, and thus cannot mount a SAR response.\n\nTo determine if the root system activates its own defenses by directly perceiving the systemic signal generated in the leaves, the biologist performs a grafting experiment. A shoot system (scion) from a wild-type (WT) plant is grafted onto a root system (rootstock) from an *npr1* mutant plant. This creates a chimeric plant designated as WT/*npr1* (scion/rootstock).\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1. A lower leaf on the WT scion is inoculated with a pathogen known to induce a strong SAR response.\n2. After several days, to allow for the generation and transport of the systemic signal, the roots of the *npr1* rootstock are challenged with a virulent root pathogen.\n3. The level of disease in the roots is then assessed and compared to control plants.\n\nAssuming the established model of SAR signaling is correct, which of the following outcomes is expected for the *npr1* roots in the WT/*npr1* graft?\n\nA. The *npr1* roots will exhibit enhanced resistance to the root pathogen, equivalent to the resistance seen in an induced WT plant.\n\nB. The *npr1* roots will exhibit a level of susceptibility to the root pathogen similar to that of an uninduced *npr1* plant.\n\nC. The WT scion will be unable to produce the systemic signal because it is attached to a mutant rootstock.\n\nD. The *npr1* roots will generate a compensatory signal that induces a heightened defense response in the WT scion.\n\nE. The entire grafted plant will show rapid necrosis and death immediately following the primary infection of the scion.", "solution": "Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) follows two separable steps: generation and transport of a mobile systemic signal from the initially infected tissue, and perception of that signal in distant tissues to activate defense gene expression. The established principle is that NPR1 is dispensable for generating the mobile signal but essential in recipient cells for perceiving the signal and activating SAR-associated transcriptional responses. In contrast, an npr1 mutant can generate and export the systemic signal but cannot respond to it, so it fails to mount SAR.\n\nIn the WT/npr1 graft, the WT scion leaf infected in step 1 will produce and export the systemic signal through the vasculature to the rootstock. Because the rootstock is npr1, its root cells lack functional NPR1 and therefore cannot perceive the incoming signal to induce SAR defenses. Consequently, upon root challenge in step 2, the npr1 roots will not exhibit the enhanced resistance characteristic of SAR; instead, they will display susceptibility comparable to an uninduced npr1 plant.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because enhanced resistance requires NPR1 in the roots to perceive the signal. B is correct because npr1 roots cannot respond to the systemic signal and thus remain as susceptible as uninduced npr1. C is incorrect because WT tissues can generate the mobile signal regardless of the rootstock genotype. D is not supported by the SAR model; npr1 roots lacking NPR1 do not generate a compensatory systemic signal that enhances defense in WT shoots. E is not expected under SAR; systemic signaling and priming do not cause immediate whole-plant necrosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1739570"}, {"introduction": "We have seen how the SAR signal is initiated and perceived, but what is the functional outcome?
