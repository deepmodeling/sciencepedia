After evaluating several plant species, they decide to plant a particular fast-growing grass known for its metal tolerance. After a full growth cycle, the firm collects samples for analysis. Their report contains the following key findings:\n1.  The concentration of mobile, bioavailable zinc in the topsoil has decreased significantly in the planted areas compared to control plots.\n2.  Analysis of the harvested grass reveals that the zinc concentration in its shoots (stems and leaves) is several orders of magnitude higher than the concentration in the soil from which it was grown.\n3.  The roots of the grass show elevated zinc levels, but these are substantially lower than the concentrations found in the shoots.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following phytoremediation mechanisms is the primary process being employed by this grass species to clean the soil?\n\nA. Phytostabilization\n\nB. Phytodegradation\n\nC. Rhizofiltration\n\nD. Phytoextraction\n\nE. Phytovolatilization", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the primary phytoremediation mechanism based on a set of observations from a field study. To do this, we must understand the definitions of each option and compare them to the scenario described.\n\nThe scenario describes a process where a plant (a specific grass) takes up a contaminant (zinc) from the soil and concentrates it in its above-ground, harvestable tissues (the shoots). Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Phytostabilization**: This mechanism involves the immobilization of contaminants in the soil, primarily through absorption and accumulation onto the roots, or by chemical changes in the rhizosphere (the soil region around the roots) that precipitate the contaminant. The goal is to prevent the contaminant from migrating into groundwater or the food chain. While the roots in the problem do have elevated zinc levels, the key finding is the extremely high concentration in the shoots. Phytostabilization focuses on locking the contaminant in the soil/root zone, not translocating it to the shoots for removal. Therefore, this is not the primary mechanism.\n\nB. **Phytodegradation** (or Phytotransformation): This mechanism involves the breakdown of organic contaminants (such as pesticides, solvents, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons) into simpler and less toxic molecules by metabolic processes within the plant. Zinc is a heavy metal, an inorganic element, and cannot be broken down or degraded. Therefore, phytodegradation is not applicable to zinc contamination.\n\nC. **Rhizofiltration**: This mechanism is used to clean contaminated water (surface or groundwater), not soil. Plants are grown hydroponically and their roots are introduced into the contaminated water, where they absorb or precipitate the contaminants. The problem explicitly states that the contamination is in the soil, so rhizofiltration is not the correct mechanism.\n\nD. **Phytoextraction** (or Phytoaccumulation): This mechanism involves the uptake of contaminants (typically metals) by plant roots from the soil and their subsequent translocation and accumulation into the harvestable, above-ground parts of the plant, such as the shoots, stems, and leaves. After the plants have accumulated the contaminant, they are harvested, effectively removing the contaminant from the soil. The observation that the zinc concentration is \"several orders of magnitude higher\" in the shoots than in the soil is the classic hallmark of phytoextraction. The decrease in soil zinc concentration confirms that the contaminant is being removed from the soil matrix. This perfectly matches the described scenario.\n\nE. **Phytovolatilization**: This mechanism involves the uptake of a contaminant by a plant and its conversion into a volatile (gaseous) form that is then released into the atmosphere through the leaves. While some metals like mercury and selenium can be volatilized, the primary evidence presented in the problem is the *accumulation* of zinc in the shoots, not its release as a gas. Thus, phytovolatilization is not the primary mechanism at play.\n\nBased on the analysis, the evidence strongly points to phytoextraction as the primary phytoremediation mechanism. The plant is actively extracting zinc from the soil and accumulating it in its harvestable shoots.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1730681"}, {"introduction": "Once a suitable phytoremediation strategy like phytoextraction is identified, it becomes crucial to understand and predict its efficiency under real-world conditions. This problem delves into the biochemical process of contaminant uptake at the root level, using the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model.
