This exercise [@problem_id:1747005] presents a classic experimental scenario, challenging you to predict the visible symptoms a legume would display when deprived of its nitrogen-fixing bacterial partners. By working through this problem, you will learn to connect macroscopic plant health indicators, like leaf color, to the fundamental role of nitrogen in plant biology and the critical importance of the rhizobial symbiosis.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is conducting an experiment to study symbiotic relationships. A batch of soybean seeds, which is a type of legume, is surface-sterilized to remove any external microorganisms. These seeds are then planted in pots containing a growth medium that has been autoclaved, rendering it completely sterile. The medium contains all essential macronutrients and micronutrients for plant growth except for one which is typically supplied via a biological process. The plants are provided with adequate water and light but are not inoculated with any bacteria. After several weeks of growth, which of the following observations would be the most likely and prominent symptom exhibited by these soybean plants?\n\nA. The leaves, particularly the older ones at the base of the plant, appear uniformly yellow (a condition known as chlorosis), and the overall plant growth is severely stunted.\n\nB. The leaves develop a dark green or purplish hue, and the development of the root system is noticeably poor compared to the shoot.\n\nC. The tips and margins of the younger leaves at the top of the plant turn yellow and become curled, while the older leaves remain green.\n\nD. The veins of the leaves turn yellow while the tissue between the veins remains green, creating a mottled or striped appearance on the leaves.\n\nE. The stems are unusually thick and woody, and the areas between leaf veins bulge out, giving the leaves a puckered appearance.", "solution": "- Identify the missing nutrient based on the setup:\n  - The medium is completely sterile and contains all essential macro- and micronutrients except one that is typically supplied via a biological process.\n  - In legumes such as soybean, the macronutrient most characteristically supplied via a biological process is nitrogen, through symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobia (e.g., Bradyrhizobium) forming root nodules.\n  - The seeds and medium are sterilized and no inoculation is performed, so no symbiotic bacteria are present. Therefore, biological nitrogen fixation cannot occur, and if the medium lacks nitrogen sources, the plants will experience nitrogen deficiency after seed reserves are exhausted.\n\n- Apply nutrient mobility and deficiency symptom principles:\n  - Nitrogen is a mobile nutrient in the phloem; when deficient, plants remobilize nitrogen from older leaves to younger, actively growing tissues.\n  - Characteristic nitrogen deficiency symptoms include:\n    - Uniform chlorosis (yellowing) that appears first on older, basal leaves.\n    - Overall stunted growth due to impaired synthesis of amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.\n\n- Evaluate options against nitrogen deficiency:\n  - A: Older leaves show uniform chlorosis and severe stunting — matches nitrogen deficiency.\n  - B: Dark green or purplish leaves and poor root system compared to shoot — more consistent with phosphorus deficiency and does not match nitrogen’s typical symptom pattern.\n  - C: Yellowing and curling of young leaf tips/margins with older leaves remaining green — more consistent with deficiencies of immobile nutrients such as calcium (or sometimes sulfur for general chlorosis of young leaves), not nitrogen.\n  - D: Interveinal chlorosis (veins green, tissue yellow) — characteristic of iron (young leaves) or magnesium (older leaves) deficiencies, not the uniform chlorosis of nitrogen deficiency.\n  - E: Thick, woody stems and puckered leaves — typical of boron deficiency, not nitrogen.\n\n- Conclusion:\n  - The most likely and prominent symptom under these conditions is nitrogen deficiency, described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1747005"}, {"introduction": "Symbiotic relationships are not accidental; they are built upon a foundation of highly specific molecular communication developed over millions of years of co-evolution. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1747028] investigates why the beneficial partnership between rhizobia and legumes is so exclusive and cannot be easily established with other plants, such as corn. Engaging with this problem will deepen your understanding of the precise chemical dialogue—the signals and responses—that acts as the gatekeeper for initiating this vital symbiosis.", "problem": "An agricultural scientist is investigating methods to improve crop yield without excessive use of synthetic fertilizers. The scientist runs an experiment on two adjacent plots of land with identical soil composition. Plot A is planted with soybeans (*Glycine max*), a legume, and Plot B is planted with corn (*Zea mays*), a cereal grain. Both plots are inoculated with a high concentration of a bacterial species, *Rhizobium leguminosarum*, which is known to form nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships. After several weeks, the scientist observes the formation of root nodules and enhanced growth in the soybean plants in Plot A. However, the corn plants in Plot B show no nodule formation and no significant growth benefit compared to a control plot with no inoculation.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biological explanation for the failure of the *Rhizobium* to establish a symbiotic relationship with corn?\n\nA. The roots of the corn plant do not secrete the specific flavonoid signaling molecules required to activate the nodulation genes in the *Rhizobium* bacteria.\n\nB. The corn plant's innate immune system identifies *Rhizobium* as a foreign pathogen and actively eliminates the bacteria before any interaction can occur.\n\nC. The *Rhizobium* bacteria are outcompeted for root colonization by the native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which are more evolutionarily adapted to associate with corn.\n\nD. *Rhizobium* bacteria are obligate anaerobes and cannot survive in the well-aerated soil environment typical for cultivating corn.\n\nE. The corn roots lack the specific leghemoglobin protein necessary to create the microaerobic environment required for the nitrogenase enzyme to function.", "solution": "We apply the biological principles governing rhizobium–legume symbiosis:\n\n1) Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobia is highly host-specific and depends on precise pre-symbiotic molecular signaling. Legume roots exude specific flavonoids that induce expression of rhizobial nodulation (nod) genes in compatible Rhizobium species.\n\n2) Upon activation of nod genes, rhizobia synthesize Nod factors (lipochitooligosaccharides) that are specifically recognized by plant LysM-type Nod factor receptors, triggering infection thread formation and nodule organogenesis. This developmental program is characteristic of legumes and is absent in non-legumes such as corn.\n\n3) Evaluate options:\n- A: The statement that corn roots do not secrete the specific flavonoids required to activate rhizobial nod genes correctly identifies an essential, early, host-specific signaling step that fails in non-legumes. Without this induction, Nod factors are not produced, and nodulation cannot initiate. This directly explains the failure of symbiosis at the fundamental signaling level.\n- B: While plant innate immunity can influence microbial interactions, rhizobia are not generally eliminated as pathogens in the rhizosphere of non-legumes; the primary barrier is lack of compatible signaling and developmental pathways, not immune clearance.\n- C: Competition with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi does not explain the categorical inability of rhizobia to nodulate corn; even in the absence of AMF, corn lacks the necessary recognition and nodulation program.\n- D: Rhizobium species are not obligate anaerobes; they are typically aerobic in soil. Nitrogenase requires a microaerobic environment inside nodules, but this is not a constraint preventing soil survival or initial interactions.\n- E: Leghemoglobin is a plant protein produced within nodules to buffer oxygen; its absence in corn is a consequence of not forming nodules, not the fundamental cause preventing symbiosis from establishing.\n\n4) Therefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation among the options is the absence of the specific flavonoid signaling needed to induce rhizobial nod gene expression and initiate the legume-specific symbiotic program.\n\nConclusion: A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1747028"}, {"introduction": "Mutualistic symbioses can be viewed as a biological marketplace, involving a carefully balanced trade of resources between partners. This practice problem [@problem_id:1747046] employs a quantitative model to illuminate the \"carbon cost\" a plant must pay to fuel the energetically demanding process of nitrogen fixation by its rhizobial symbionts. By calculating how a change in the plant's photosynthetic activity impacts the rate of nitrogen fixation, you will gain a concrete appreciation for the economic trade-offs that govern these essential ecological interactions.", "problem": "A soybean plant is cultivated in a controlled environment to study its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. The plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates, produced via photosynthesis, which the bacteria use as an energy source to fix atmospheric nitrogen ($N_2$) into ammonia ($NH_3$).\n\nConsider a simplified model of this carbon-for-nitrogen exchange. The rate of nitrogen fixation by the rhizobia is directly proportional to the mass of surplus carbon the plant allocates to its root nodules. The plant prioritizes its own metabolic needs; it first uses a portion of its daily photosynthetic gain for maintenance and growth, and only the remaining surplus is transported to the nodules.\n\nUnder optimal \"sunny\" conditions, the plant's net photosynthetic carbon gain is $G_{sun} = 2.50$ grams of carbon per day. The plant's own essential metabolic processes require a constant $M_{plant} = 1.20$ grams of carbon per day.\n\nNow, suppose the plant experiences a prolonged period of cloudy weather, during which its net photosynthetic carbon gain is reduced to 65.0% of the sunny-day rate.\n\nCalculate the fractional reduction in the rate of nitrogen fixation during the cloudy period compared to the sunny period. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The nitrogen fixation rate is directly proportional to the surplus carbon sent to nodules. Let $G$ be daily net photosynthetic gain and $M$ the plant’s own requirement. The surplus available to nodules is $S=G-M$ (assuming $G>M$), and the fixation rate $R$ satisfies $R\\propto S$.
