This exercise challenges you to connect specific genetic mutations in the jasmonate signaling pathway to whole-plant phenotypes, specifically exploring the fundamental trade-off between allocating resources to growth versus defense [@problem_id:1714696]. By analyzing hypothetical mutants with defense systems that are either permanently \"off\" or permanently \"on,\" you will build an intuition for how molecular switches govern an organism's overall physiology and survival strategy.", "problem": "In plant biology, the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway is a critical defense mechanism against chewing insects. The pathway operates as follows: In the absence of an insect attack, JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as repressors, binding to and inactivating transcription factors that would otherwise switch on defense genes. When a plant is attacked, it synthesizes the signaling molecule jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). JA-Ile binds to its receptor, an F-box protein called CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1). This binding event causes the COI1-containing protein complex to tag the JAZ repressor proteins for degradation. The removal of JAZ repressors liberates the transcription factors, which then activate the expression of a suite of defense genes, leading to the production of anti-herbivore compounds. This defense response is effective but metabolically costly, often leading to reduced plant growth due to the diversion of resources.\n\nA plant biologist is studying two mutant lines of a model plant, alongside a normal Wild-Type (WT) plant.\n- **Mutant A:** Possesses a non-functional *coi1* allele, resulting in a COI1 protein that cannot bind to JA-Ile.\n- **Mutant B:** Possesses a mutation that makes its JAZ proteins constitutively unstable, leading to their constant degradation, irrespective of JA-Ile presence.\n\nThe biologist grows all three plant types (WT, Mutant A, and Mutant B) in a controlled environment. For each plant type, half the population is exposed to herbivorous caterpillars and the other half is left unexposed as a control. Based on your understanding of the JA signaling pathway and the associated growth-defense trade-offs, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the observable phenotypes?\n\nA. Mutant A will show growth comparable to the unexposed WT plant but will be highly susceptible to herbivory. Mutant B will be highly resistant to caterpillars but will show stunted growth compared to the unexposed WT plant, regardless of caterpillar presence.\n\nB. Mutant B will show growth comparable to the unexposed WT plant but will be highly susceptible to herbivory. Mutant A will be highly resistant to caterpillars but will show stunted growth compared to the unexposed WT plant, regardless of caterpillar presence.\n\nC. Both Mutant A and Mutant B will be highly susceptible to herbivory. Mutant A will have growth comparable to the unexposed WT, while Mutant B will have stunted growth.\n\nD. Both Mutant A and Mutant B will be highly resistant to herbivory. Mutant A will have stunted growth, while Mutant B will have growth comparable to the unexposed WT.\n\nE. Mutant A will be phenotypically identical to the Wild-Type plant under all conditions. Mutant B will be highly resistant to caterpillars but will show stunted growth compared to the unexposed WT plant, regardless of caterpillar presence.", "solution": "The jasmonate signaling logic is as follows. In the absence of herbivory, JAZ repressors bind and inactivate defense transcription factors, so defense genes remain off and resources are allocated to growth. Upon herbivory, the plant synthesizes JA-Ile; JA-Ile binding to COI1 enables the SCF-COI1 complex to target JAZ proteins for degradation. Degradation of JAZ releases transcription factors to activate defense genes, producing anti-herbivore compounds. This activated defense state increases resistance but imposes a metabolic cost that reduces growth relative to the uninduced state.\n\nWild-Type (WT) predictions:\n- Unexposed: JAZ intact, defense off, maximal growth, low constitutive resistance.\n- Exposed: JA-Ile induces COI1-dependent JAZ degradation, defense on, higher resistance, reduced growth due to defense cost.\n\nMutant A (non-functional coi1; COI1 cannot bind JA-Ile):\n- Mechanism: Without JA-Ile binding to COI1, the SCF-COI1 complex cannot target JAZ for degradation even when JA-Ile is present. JAZ repressors persist and continue to inhibit defense transcription factors.\n- Phenotype: Defense genes fail to activate upon herbivory, making the plant highly susceptible to caterpillars. Because defense is not induced, the plant does not pay the metabolic defense cost and thus, in the absence of herbivory, exhibits growth comparable to unexposed WT. When exposed to herbivores, susceptibility leads to high damage; the key mechanistic prediction remains lack of induced defense and absence of defense-associated growth penalty.\n\nMutant B (constitutively unstable JAZ; constant degradation independent of JA-Ile):\n- Mechanism: JAZ proteins are continually degraded regardless of JA-Ile, freeing defense transcription factors constitutively.\n- Phenotype: Defense genes are always on, conferring high resistance to caterpillars in both exposed and unexposed conditions. Constitutive defense imposes a persistent metabolic cost, causing stunted growth relative to unexposed WT regardless of caterpillar presence.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the mechanistic predictions: Mutant A is highly susceptible and shows growth comparable to unexposed WT when not attacked; Mutant B is highly resistant but shows stunted growth regardless of exposure.\n- B reverses roles and is inconsistent with the pathway.\n- C incorrectly claims Mutant B is susceptible.\n- D incorrectly claims Mutant A is resistant and Mutant B has normal growth.\n- E incorrectly asserts Mutant A is phenotypically identical to WT under all conditions; WT can induce defense whereas Mutant A cannot.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1714696"}, {"introduction": "The activation of plant defenses relies on the precise and timely removal of JAZ repressor proteins. This critical step is carried out by a sophisticated piece of cellular machinery known as the SCF-COI1 E3 ligase complex [@problem_id:1714753]. This problem invites you to think like a molecular biologist, dissecting this multi-protein machine to predict the outcome when a single, essential component is missing, thereby emphasizing that complex biological functions often depend on the integrity of every part of the system.", "problem": "In wild-type plants, physical damage from herbivory triggers the synthesis of the hormone jasmonate (JA). The active form of this hormone, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), binds to its receptor, a protein called CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1). This binding event enables the COI1 protein to interact with a family of repressor proteins known as Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins.\n\nIn the cellular machinery, COI1 is part of a larger multi-protein complex called the SCF-COI1 complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The formation of this complex requires COI1, a Cullin protein, and a Skp1 protein. When a JAZ repressor is bound by the JA-Ile/COI1 complex, the SCF-COI1 E3 ligase targets the JAZ protein for ubiquitination, marking it for degradation by the 26S proteasome.\n\nJAZ proteins normally function by repressing transcription factors, such as MYC2. The degradation of JAZ proteins releases these transcription factors, allowing them to activate the expression of defense genes. The products of these genes, such as proteinase inhibitors, help to deter further herbivory.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mutant plant line that expresses a fully functional COI1 receptor protein but is completely deficient in the Skp1 protein. If this mutant plant is subjected to sustained herbivory, which of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed?\n\nA. The plant will exhibit a hyper-defensive response, producing excessive amounts of defense compounds even with minor damage, because JAZ proteins will be constitutively degraded.\n\nB. The plant will be unable to degrade JAZ proteins, leading to a failure to express defense genes and increased susceptibility to herbivores.\n\nC. The plant will show a normal defense response, as the functional COI1 receptor is sufficient to initiate the signaling cascade upon JA-Ile binding.\n\nD. The plant will be unable to synthesize jasmonate (JA-Ile) in response to herbivory, preventing the initiation of any defense signaling.\n\nE. The transcription factor MYC2 will be constitutively active in the absence of Skp1, leading to a permanent state of defense even without herbivory.", "solution": "1) State the normal pathway components and sequence. Herbivory increases jasmonate levels, and the active hormone JA-Ile binds COI1. COI1 is the F-box component of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that requires Skp1 and a Cullin to assemble. In the presence of JA-Ile, COI1 engages JAZ repressors, and the SCF-COI1 complex ubiquitinates JAZ proteins, targeting them for 26S proteasome degradation. Loss of JAZ de-represses transcription factors such as MYC2, enabling defense gene expression.\n\n2) Identify the specific role of Skp1. Skp1 is the adaptor that bridges the F-box protein (COI1) to the Cullin scaffold, completing the SCF E3 ligase architecture. Without Skp1, the SCF-COI1 complex cannot assemble and lacks E3 ligase activity.\n\n3) Predict the consequence of Skp1 deficiency with functional COI1. Even if COI1 can bind JA-Ile and engage JAZ proteins, the absence of Skp1 prevents formation of a functional SCF-COI1 E3 ligase. Therefore, JAZ proteins cannot be ubiquitinated and will not be targeted for proteasomal degradation.\n\n4) Infer the downstream transcriptional outcome. Stabilized JAZ repressors continue to inhibit MYC2 and related transcription factors, preventing activation of jasmonate-responsive defense genes. Consequently, the plant fails to mount an effective defense response and becomes more susceptible to herbivory.\n\n5) Evaluate the options. \n- A is incorrect because JAZ degradation requires an intact SCF-COI1 complex; without Skp1, JAZ is stabilized, not constitutively degraded.\n- B is correct because Skp1 loss blocks JAZ ubiquitination and degradation, preventing defense gene expression.\n- C is incorrect because a functional COI1 alone is insufficient; the SCF complex is required for ubiquitination.\n- D is incorrect because Skp1 is not required for JA-Ile biosynthesis.\n- E is incorrect because MYC2 remains repressed by undegraded JAZ; it is not constitutively active.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714753"}, {"introduction": "The jasmonate signaling cascade is initiated by a chemical hormone, but the cell's response is highly specific to the molecule's structure.

This pathway is initiated when a bioactive jasmonate conjugate binds to the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1), which functions as a co-receptor. This binding event promotes the interaction of COI1 with a JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) repressor protein, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the JAZ protein, thereby activating defense gene expression. The most well-characterized bioactive molecule is Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile).\n\nA botanist is studying a newly discovered plant species, *Silphium novum*, which shows remarkable resilience to a specific herbivore. Using mass spectrometry, she finds that upon simulated herbivory, *S. novum* synthesizes almost exclusively Jasmonoyl-valine (JA-Val), with negligible production of JA-Ile. To investigate whether JA-Val is an active signaling molecule in this species, she performs an in-vitro competitive binding assay using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).\n\nIn the experiment, recombinant JAZ1 protein is immobilized on a sensor chip. A solution containing a constant concentration of recombinant COI1 protein and a fluorescently labeled JA-Ile analog is passed over the chip. This results in the formation of a COI1-JAZ1 complex, generating a baseline signal. The experiment then measures how effectively unlabeled \"competitor\" molecules (unconjugated Jasmonic Acid (JA), JA-Ile, or JA-Val) can disrupt the formation of this complex by competing for the binding site on COI1. The effectiveness is quantified by the IC50 value, which is the concentration of the competitor required to inhibit 50% of the COI1-JAZ1 binding signal. A lower IC50 value indicates a higher affinity of the competitor for COI1 and thus greater potency in mediating the COI1-JAZ1 interaction.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n- Competitor JA-Ile: IC50 = $0.045 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- Competitor JA-Val: IC50 = $8.55 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- Competitor JA: IC50 > $500 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nBased on this data, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA. JA-Val is completely inactive as a signaling molecule for the COI1-JAZ1 interaction in *S. novum*.\n\nB. JA-Val is a more potent signaling molecule than JA-Ile for promoting the COI1-JAZ1 interaction.\n\nC. Jasmonic Acid (JA) itself is the most important signaling molecule, and its conjugation to amino acids weakens its activity.\n\nD. Both JA-Ile and JA-Val can mediate the COI1-JAZ1 interaction, but JA-Val is significantly less effective than JA-Ile.\n\nE.

In this setup, a fluorescently labeled JA-Ile analog and COI1 together promote formation of a COI1–JAZ1 complex on a JAZ1-coated chip, generating a signal. Addition of an unlabeled competitor that binds the same COI1 pocket and supports the COI1–JAZ1 ternary complex will displace the labeled analog and reduce the signal. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of competitor that reduces the binding signal by one-half; lower IC50 indicates higher effective affinity/potency for mediating the COI1–JAZ1 interaction under the assay conditions.\n\nGiven the results:\n- JA-Ile: IC50 $=0.045 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$,\n- JA-Val: IC50 $=8.55 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$,\n- JA: IC50 $>500 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$,\n\nthe potency ranking is JA-Ile $\\gg$ JA-Val $\\gg$ JA.
