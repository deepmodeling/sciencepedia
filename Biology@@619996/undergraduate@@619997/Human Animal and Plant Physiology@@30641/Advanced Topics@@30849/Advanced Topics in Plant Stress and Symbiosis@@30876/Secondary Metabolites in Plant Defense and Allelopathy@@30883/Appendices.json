This is a central theme in plant defense theory, where allocating resources like carbon ($C$) and nitrogen ($N$) to produce defensive secondary metabolites comes at the cost of growth and reproduction. This exercise provides a quantitative look at such a trade-off, allowing you to calculate how a plant might distribute its available resources between two different classes of defensive compounds based on their elemental costs, a concept at the heart of the Growth-Differentiation Balance Hypothesis. [@problem_id:1740738]", "problem": "A botanist studies the defense chemistry of a hypothetical plant, *Fictitia herba*, which allocates resources to either nitrogen-based alkaloids or carbon-based terpenoids for defense. This allocation occurs from the pools of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) that remain after the plant's primary growth requirements are met.\n\nThe metabolic cost to synthesize 1 milligram (mg) of each compound is defined as:\n- **Alkaloids:** Cost is $c_a = 15$ units of carbon and $n_a = 5$ units of nitrogen.\n- **Terpenoids:** Cost is $c_t = 25$ units of carbon and $n_t = 0$ units of nitrogen.\n\nThe plant's production strategy is to fully utilize its available resource pools. It produces a mass of alkaloids, $m_a$, and a mass of terpenoids, $m_t$, such that the total resource consumption matches the available pools for defense.\n\nIn an experiment on plants grown in nitrogen-limited soil, the daily available resource pools for secondary metabolism were measured to be:\n- Carbon pool ($C_{avail}$): 4500 units\n- Nitrogen pool ($N_{avail}$): 260 units\n\nCalculate the total mass of defensive compounds (alkaloids plus terpenoids) that the plant produces in one day under these conditions.
