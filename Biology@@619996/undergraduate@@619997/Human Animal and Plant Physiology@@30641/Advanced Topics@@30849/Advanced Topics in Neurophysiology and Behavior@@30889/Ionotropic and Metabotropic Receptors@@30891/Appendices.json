To characterize the receptor's function, a voltage-clamp experiment is performed on the postsynaptic neuron. The neuron is known to have a stable resting membrane potential of -70 mV and an action potential threshold of -50 mV. The experiment reveals that when the novel neurotransmitter is applied, the resulting postsynaptic current reverses its direction at a membrane potential of +5 mV. This value is determined to be the reversal potential ($E_{rev}$) for the synapse.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following provides the most accurate functional classification of this postsynaptic receptor?\n\nA. Inhibitory and likely permeable to only K⁺ ions.\nB. Excitatory and likely permeable to only Na⁺ ions.\nC. Inhibitory and likely permeable to only Cl⁻ ions.\nD.

The ultimate effect of opening an ion channel depends critically on where the resulting membrane potential settles relative to the action potential threshold. This exercise [@problem_id:1714462] presents a classic scenario involving a chloride channel to explore the important principle of shunting inhibition, where a receptor can inhibit a neuron not by hyperpolarizing it, but by 'clamping' the voltage below threshold and short-circuiting other excitatory inputs.", "problem": "In the central nervous system, a neuron at rest has a typical membrane potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$) of -70 mV and a threshold potential ($V_{\\text{th}}$) of -55 mV required to fire an action potential. Consider a scenario where a neurotransmitter binds to an ionotropic receptor on the postsynaptic membrane of this neuron. This specific receptor is exclusively permeable to chloride ions ($Cl^-$). The equilibrium potential for chloride ions ($E_{\\text{Cl}}$) in this neuron is -65 mV.\n\nWhen this receptor is activated, it generates a small, localized change in the postsynaptic membrane potential. This change is classified as either an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), which makes the neuron more likely to fire an action potential, or an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP), which makes the neuron less likely to fire an action potential.\n\nBased on the provided values, which of the following statements correctly describes the resulting event?\n\nA. An EPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.\nB. An EPSP, because the efflux of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.\nC. An IPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will hyperpolarize the membrane.\nD. An IPSP, because the resulting membrane potential is held below the action potential threshold, and the increased conductance shunts excitatory currents.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the nature of the postsynaptic potential generated by opening chloride channels on a neuron with specific properties. We need to analyze the movement of chloride ions ($Cl^-$) and its effect on the neuron's ability to reach the action potential threshold.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the electrochemical driving force on $Cl^-$ ions.**\nThe direction of ion flow through an open channel is determined by the electrochemical driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the ion's equilibrium potential ($E_{ion}$). The formula for the driving force is $V_m - E_{ion}$. A positive driving force on a cation or a negative driving force on an anion results in an outward current (efflux). A negative driving force on a cation or a positive driving force on an anion results in an inward current (influx).\n\nThe neuron is initially at its resting membrane potential, so $V_m = V_{\\text{rest}} = -70$ mV.\nThe equilibrium potential for chloride is given as $E_{\\text{Cl}} = -65$ mV.\n\nThe driving force on $Cl^-$ is:\n$$ \\text{Driving Force} = V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}} = (-70 \\text{ mV}) - (-65 \\text{ mV}) = -5 \\text{ mV} $$\n\nSince $Cl^-$ is an anion (negatively charged) and the driving force is negative, the chloride ions will move out of the cell. This is an efflux of chloride ions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the effect of ion movement on the membrane potential.**\nThe efflux of negative charges ($Cl^-$ ions) from the cell makes the inside of the cell less negative relative to the outside. This change in potential is a depolarization. The membrane potential will move from its resting value of -70 mV towards the equilibrium potential of chloride, -65 mV.\nSo, the activation of the receptor causes a small depolarization from -70 mV towards -65 mV.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the postsynaptic potential as an EPSP or an IPSP.**\nAn Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) brings the membrane potential closer to the action potential threshold ($V_{\\text{th}} = -55$ mV), making it easier to fire an action potential.\nAn Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) makes it more difficult for the neuron to reach the threshold. This can happen in two ways:\n1.  **Hyperpolarization**: The membrane potential becomes more negative, moving further away from the threshold.\n2.  **Shunting Inhibition**: The membrane potential is stabilized at a value below the threshold. The opening of the channels increases the membrane's conductance, so any excitatory current that arrives is \"shunted\" or diverted through these open channels, making it much less effective at depolarizing the membrane to threshold.\n\nIn this case, the membrane depolarizes from -70 mV towards -65 mV. While this is a depolarization, the new potential (-65 mV) is still more negative than the threshold potential (-55 mV). The opening of these $Cl^-$ channels effectively \"clamps\" or stabilizes the membrane potential near -65 mV. If a simultaneous EPSP tried to depolarize the neuron towards the -55 mV threshold, the open $Cl^-$ channels would provide a low-resistance pathway for current to leak out, counteracting the depolarization. This effect is known as shunting inhibition. Because the overall effect is to make the neuron *less* likely to fire an action potential, the event is functionally classified as an IPSP.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A. An EPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.** This is incorrect. The ion movement is an efflux, not an influx.\n- **B. An EPSP, because the efflux of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.** This correctly identifies the ion movement (efflux) and the immediate voltage change (depolarization). However, it incorrectly classifies the event as an EPSP because it ignores the functional context of the action potential threshold and the principle of shunting inhibition.\n- **C. An IPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will hyperpolarize the membrane.** This is incorrect. The ion movement is an efflux, and it causes depolarization, not hyperpolarization.\n- **D. An IPSP, because the resulting membrane potential is held below the action potential threshold, and the increased conductance shunts excitatory currents.** This is the correct and most complete explanation. It correctly identifies the event as an IPSP and provides the accurate reason based on the principle of shunting inhibition, which is the key concept in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1714462"}, {"introduction": "Shifting our focus to metabotropic receptors, we move from direct ion gating to intricate intracellular signaling cascades that rely on molecular switches, like G-proteins, which must be precisely turned on and off.

By understanding what happens when this regulation fails, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the critical role of GTP hydrolysis in ensuring that cellular responses are transient and proportional to the stimulus.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway in a line of cultured cells. The pathway proceeds as follows: upon binding of an external hormone ligand, the GPCR activates a heterotrimeric G-protein. The alpha subunit of this G-protein, denoted Gα, releases its bound Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and binds a molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The now active Gα-GTP complex dissociates and activates a membrane-bound enzyme, adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme then catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). High intracellular concentrations of cAMP lead to the activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA), which then phosphorylates various downstream target proteins to elicit a cellular response. The signaling is terminated when the Gα subunit's intrinsic GTPase activity hydrolyzes the bound GTP back to GDP, causing Gα to become inactive and re-associate with its partner subunits.\n\nThe researchers introduce a point mutation into the gene encoding the Gα subunit. This mutation renders the intrinsic GTPase domain of the Gα protein completely non-functional. The Gα subunit can still be activated by the GPCR, bind GTP, and activate adenylyl cyclase. However, it can no longer hydrolyze its bound GTP.\n\nAssuming that there is a low, basal level of spontaneous GPCR activation even without the hormone, which of the following statements best describes the long-term state of the intracellular concentration of cAMP and the activity of PKA in these mutant cells, even when they are cultured in a medium completely lacking the hormone ligand?\n\nA. Both cAMP concentration and PKA activity will remain at low, basal levels.\nB. Both cAMP concentration and PKA activity will be persistently and maximally elevated.\nC. Both cAMP concentration and PKA activity will rise initially but then return to basal levels as the cell's receptors are desensitized.\nD. The cAMP concentration will be depleted, and PKA activity will be inhibited.\nE. The cAMP concentration will be elevated, but PKA will remain inactive because the cell will run out of ATP to be phosphorylated.", "solution": "The problem describes a mutation that disrupts the normal \"off switch\" for a G-protein signaling pathway. Let's analyze the consequences step by step.\n\nFirst, we must understand the normal G-protein cycle. The Gα subunit acts as a molecular switch. It is in the \"off\" state when bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and in the \"on\" state when bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The transition from \"off\" to \"on\" is triggered by an activated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP. The transition from \"on\" back to \"off\" is an intrinsic property of the Gα subunit itself: its GTPase domain hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate, thereby inactivating the subunit.\n\nThe problem states that a mutation has rendered the intrinsic GTPase domain non-functional. This means that the Gα subunit can no longer perform the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Consequently, once a Gα subunit is activated by binding GTP, it becomes permanently locked in the \"on\" state. It is constitutively active.\n\nThe problem specifies that there is a low, basal level of spontaneous GPCR activation. This means that, over time, even without any hormonal stimulus, some GPCRs will randomly become active and trigger the GDP-GTP exchange on their associated Gα subunits. In a normal cell, this transient activation would be quickly terminated by GTP hydrolysis. However, in the mutant cells, each Gα subunit that is stochastically activated will become permanently stuck in its active Gα-GTP state.\n\nA constitutively active Gα-GTP subunit will continuously stimulate its downstream target, adenylyl cyclase. This leads to the unabated production of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). As a result, the intracellular concentration of cAMP will rise far above basal levels and remain persistently high.\n\nThis chronically high concentration of cAMP will, in turn, cause the sustained and maximal activation of its target, Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA will then continuously phosphorylate its downstream targets, leading to a maximal cellular response as if the cell were being constantly stimulated by the hormone at a saturating concentration.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The failure of the \"off\" switch leads to signal accumulation, not a return to the basal state.\nB. This is the correct description. The Gα subunit is constitutively active, leading to persistent and maximal activation of the entire downstream pathway: adenylyl cyclase, cAMP production, and PKA activity.\nC. This is a plausible but incorrect distractor. Receptor desensitization is a feedback mechanism that often involves phosphorylating and internalizing the GPCR itself to reduce its sensitivity to external ligands. However, this mechanism acts upstream of the G-protein. Even if all receptors were desensitized and internalized, the Gα subunits that have already been activated would remain locked in their GTP-bound \"on\" state and continue to signal. The problem lies within the G-protein, not the receptor.\nD. This is incorrect. It describes the opposite of what happens. An active Gα leads to the production, not depletion, of cAMP and subsequent activation of PKA.\nE. This is incorrect. While it's true that adenylyl cyclase consumes ATP to make cAMP, and PKA uses ATP for phosphorylation, the primary signaling consequence is the activation of PKA by cAMP. Cellular ATP depletion is a potential secondary metabolic consequence of extreme, long-term pathway activation, not the primary reason PKA would be inactive. In fact, PKA would be hyper-activated until or unless ATP levels became critically low, but the direct signaling logic points to PKA activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714420"}]}
