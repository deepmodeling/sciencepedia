The neuron is observed to have a stable resting membrane potential of -70 mV. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of chloride ions ($Cl^-$) are such that the Nernst equilibrium potential for chloride ($E_{Cl}$) is -65 mV. At a specific moment, a neurotransmitter, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), binds to and opens GABA-A receptors on the neuron's postsynaptic membrane. These GABA-A receptors are ligand-gated ion channels primarily permeable to chloride ions.\n\nAssuming the intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations do not change instantaneously, what is the immediate effect of the opening of these GABA-A receptor channels on the neuron?\n\nA. Chloride ions will flow out of the cell, causing a slight depolarization.\n\nB. Chloride ions will flow into the cell, causing a hyperpolarization.\n\nC.
