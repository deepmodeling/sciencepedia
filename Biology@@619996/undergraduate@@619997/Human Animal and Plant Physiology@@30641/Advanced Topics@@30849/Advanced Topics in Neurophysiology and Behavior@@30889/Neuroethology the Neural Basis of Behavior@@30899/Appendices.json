The researcher isolates a specific \"coincidence detector\" neuron in the owl's auditory brainstem. This neuron exhibits its maximum firing rate when a sound signal reaches the owl's left ear a specific amount of time before it reaches the right ear. This time delay is measured to be $\\Delta t = 100.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ seconds.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, model the owl's head as a simple sphere, and assume the sound source is distant enough that the incoming sound waves are effectively planar.

These circuits use the Interaural Time Difference (ITD), the delay in sound arrival time between the two ears, to calculate the horizontal position (azimuth) of a sound source. In a normal owl, there is a simple linear relationship between the azimuth angle $\\theta$ (in degrees, with $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$ being directly in front) and the corresponding ITD. Experimental data for a particular owl shows that a sound source at an azimuth of $\\theta = +25^{\\circ}$ (to the right) produces an ITD of $+120$ microseconds ($\\mu$s).\n\nThis owl is fitted with special prismatic spectacles that displace its entire visual field horizontally by a constant angle $\\Delta\\theta = -12^{\\circ}$ (a shift to the left).

This problem delves into the cellular mechanism of 'corollary discharge,' a neural signal that prevents an animal like a cricket from being overwhelmed by its own actions, such as birdsong or stridulation. You will model an auditory neuron to calculate the precise amount of inhibition required to cancel out a self-generated stimulus, connecting a high-level behavioral problem to its biophysical solution [@problem_id:1722344].", "problem": "In the neuroethology of insect communication, the phenomenon of corollary discharge is crucial for distinguishing self-generated stimuli from external ones. A male cricket, for instance, must avoid deafening its own auditory system with its loud courtship song. To achieve this, a copy of the motor command for singing, the corollary discharge, is sent to centrally inhibit key auditory neurons.\n\nLet us model one such neuron, the auditory neuron AN1, as a single electrical compartment governed by passive membrane properties. Under normal resting conditions, the neuron has a stable resting membrane potential $V_{rest}$. When its membrane potential $V_m$ reaches a threshold potential $V_{th}$, it fires an action potential. The cricket's song is so intense that the acoustic stimulus it produces would, in the absence of any inhibition, depolarize the AN1 neuron to a steady-state potential $V_{sound}$, which is well above the firing threshold.\n\nThe corollary discharge mechanism counters this by activating a specific set of inhibitory synapses on the AN1 neuron. The activation of these synapses can be modeled as the introduction of an inhibitory conductance, $g_{inh}$, associated with an ionic reversal potential of $E_{inh}$.\n\nGiven the following parameters for the AN1 neuron:\n-   Resting membrane potential, $V_{rest} = -65.0 \\text{ mV}$\n-   Spike threshold potential, $V_{th} = -45.0 \\text{ mV}$\n-   Membrane resistance, $R_m = 50.0 \\text{ M}\\Omega$\n-   Inhibitory reversal potential, $E_{inh} = -70.0 \\text{ mV}$\n-   Song-induced steady-state potential, $V_{sound} = -20.0 \\text{ mV}$\n\nCalculate the minimum inhibitory conductance $g_{inh}$ that the corollary discharge must generate to prevent the AN1 neuron from firing an action potential in response to the cricket's own song.
