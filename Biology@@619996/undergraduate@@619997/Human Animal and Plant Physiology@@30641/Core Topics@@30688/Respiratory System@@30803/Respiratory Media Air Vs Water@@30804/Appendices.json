The average partial pressure of $CO_2$ maintained in a fish's arterial blood is significantly higher than that in a mammal's arterial blood.", "solution": "The solution requires a careful analysis of the trade-offs and adaptations related to breathing in water versus air. We will evaluate each statement.\n\nThe key differences between air and water as respiratory media are:\n1.  **Oxygen Content**: Air contains about 210 mL of $O_2$ per liter, while cool, fresh water contains only about 7 mL of $O_2$ per liter. Oxygen is much less available in water.\n2.  **Density and Viscosity**: Water is about 800 times denser and 50 times more viscous than air. This means it requires substantially more energy to move a given volume of water over a respiratory surface compared to moving the same volume of air.\n3.  **CO₂ Solubility**: Carbon dioxide is highly soluble in water, much more so than oxygen.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these facts.\n\n**Statement A: The partial pressure gradient between the blood and the medium required to excrete a given amount of $CO_2$ is significantly larger in fish than in mammals.**\nThis statement is incorrect. $CO_2$ is extremely soluble in water and diffuses rapidly across the gills into the surrounding environment, where its partial pressure is very low. Consequently, fish can effectively excrete large amounts of $CO_2$ with a very small partial pressure gradient between their blood and the water. Mammals, excreting $CO_2$ into air, require a more substantial gradient (e.g., arterial blood $P_{CO_2}$ ~40 mmHg, pulmonary artery blood $P_{CO_2}$ ~45-46 mmHg, alveolar air $P_{CO_2}$ ~40 mmHg). So, the gradient is smaller in fish, not larger.\n\n**Statement B: Due to the high $O_2$ content and low density of air, mammalian lungs are able to extract a higher percentage of $O_2$ from each volume of inhaled medium compared to fish gills.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While air is rich in $O_2$, the tidal (in-and-out) breathing mechanism of mammals is not maximally efficient. Inhaled fresh air mixes with \"dead space\" air that remains in the lungs, lowering the alveolar $P_{O_2}$ well below that of atmospheric air. Typically, mammalian lungs extract only about 25% of the $O_2$ from the air that is inhaled into the alveoli. In contrast, fish use a unidirectional flow of water across their gills, coupled with a highly efficient counter-current exchange system. This system allows them to extract 80% or more of the scarce $O_2$ present in the water. Therefore, fish gills are more efficient at percentage extraction.\n\n**Statement C: The partial pressure of $O_2$ in the blood leaving the respiratory organ can approach the partial pressure of $O_2$ in the incoming, fresh medium (inhaled air or inspired water) for a fish, but not for a mammal.**\nThis statement is correct. This is a direct consequence of the different gas exchange mechanisms. The counter-current exchange in fish gills maintains a partial pressure gradient for $O_2$ across the entire length of the respiratory surface (the lamellae). Blood flowing through the gill capillaries continually encounters water with a slightly higher $P_{O_2}$, allowing the blood $P_{O_2}$ to rise to a level very close to that of the incoming water. In mammalian lungs, blood flows past the alveoli and can only equilibrate with the partial pressure of the alveolar air. Due to the mixing of fresh and stale air (tidal breathing), the alveolar $P_{O_2}$ (around 104 mmHg) is significantly lower than the $P_{O_2}$ of the inhaled atmospheric air (around 160 mmHg at sea level). Thus, the blood leaving the lungs can never approach the $P_{O_2}$ of the fresh, inhaled medium.\n\n**Statement D: To compensate for the low solubility of $O_2$ in water, fish must expend a smaller fraction of their total metabolic energy on the physical process of ventilation compared to mammals.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Because water is dense and viscous, and because it contains little $O_2$, fish must pump very large volumes of it across their gills to meet their metabolic needs. This process, ventilation, is energetically expensive. It is estimated that a fish may expend up to 20% of its total resting metabolism just on breathing. A mammal, moving light and oxygen-rich air, typically expends only 1-2% of its resting metabolism on ventilation.\n\n**Statement E: The average partial pressure of $CO_2$ maintained in a fish's arterial blood is significantly higher than that in a mammal's arterial blood.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As explained for statement A, the high solubility of $CO_2$ in water allows it to be removed from the fish's blood with extreme efficiency and a minimal partial pressure gradient. As a result, the $P_{CO_2}$ in a fish's blood is kept very low, often less than 5-10 mmHg, which is substantially lower than the ~40 mmHg found in mammalian arterial blood.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1738563"}]}
