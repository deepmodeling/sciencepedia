The model assumes the person is submerged vertically in freshwater, with the top of the snorkel just at the surface. The effective depth of the person's chest below the surface is equal to the length of the snorkel, $L$. For successful breathing, two critical conditions must be met:\n\n1.  The pressure difference generated by the inspiratory muscles must be sufficient to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the water on the chest.\n2.  The volume of fresh air inhaled during a single breath must be greater than the volume of the non-gas-exchanging airways (the dead space), which now includes the snorkel's volume.\n\nYou are tasked with calculating the maximum possible length of the snorkel.

We must calculate the maximum length allowed by each constraint and then determine the overall maximum functional length, which will be the smaller of the two values. Let the length of the snorkel be $L$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the pressure constraint. When a person is submerged at a depth $L$, the water exerts an external hydrostatic pressure on their chest. This pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{hydro}}$, must be overcome by the inspiratory muscles to expand the thoracic cavity. The hydrostatic pressure is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{hydro}} = \\rho g L $$\nFor successful inspiration, this pressure cannot exceed the maximum pressure difference the respiratory muscles can generate, $\\Delta P_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$ \\rho g L \\leq \\Delta P_{\\text{max}} $$\nThis inequality gives us the first limit on the length, which we'll call $L_{\\text{pressure}}$:\n$$ L \\leq \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{max}}}{\\rho g} $$\nSo, the maximum length based on the pressure constraint is:\n$$ L_{\\text{pressure}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{max}}}{\\rho g} $$\n\nSecond, let's analyze the dead space constraint. For effective gas exchange to occur in the alveoli, the volume of fresh air inhaled must reach them. The total dead space, $V_{D, \\text{total}}$, is the sum of the person's Anatomical Dead Space ($V_{\\text{ADS}}$) and the volume of the snorkel ($V_{\\text{snorkel}}$).\n$$ V_{D, \\text{total}} = V_{\\text{ADS}} + V_{\\text{snorkel}} $$\nThe snorkel is a cylinder of length $L$ and inner diameter $d$. Its volume is given by:\n$$ V_{\\text{snorkel}} = A \\cdot L = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 L $$\nFor any fresh air to reach the alveoli, the Tidal Volume ($V_T$) must be greater than the total dead space.\n$$ V_T > V_{D, \\text{total}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the dead space volumes:\n$$ V_T > V_{\\text{ADS}} + \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 L $$\nThis inequality gives us the second limit on the length, which we'll call $L_{\\text{deadspace}}$:\n$$ L < \\frac{V_T - V_{\\text{ADS}}}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2} $$\nSo, the maximum length based on the dead space constraint is:\n$$ L_{\\text{deadspace}} = \\frac{V_T - V_{\\text{ADS}}}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2} $$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into both expressions to find the two limiting lengths.\n\nFor the pressure limit, $L_{\\text{pressure}}$:\n$$ L_{\\text{pressure}} = \\frac{8.50 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ Pa}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ kg/m}^3)(9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2)} = \\frac{8500}{9810} \\text{ m} \\approx 0.86646 \\text{ m} $$\n\nFor the dead space limit, $L_{\\text{deadspace}}$:\nFirst, calculate the cross-sectional area $A$ of the snorkel.\n$$ A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{2.40 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi (1.20 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m})^2 = \\pi (1.44 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2) \\approx 4.5239 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2 $$\nNext, calculate the available volume for the snorkel, which is the \"fresh air\" volume, $V_T - V_{\\text{ADS}}$.\n$$ V_T - V_{\\text{ADS}} = (5.50 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^3) - (1.50 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^3) = 4.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^3 $$\nNow, we can find $L_{\\text{deadspace}}$:\n$$ L_{\\text{deadspace}} = \\frac{4.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^3}{4.5239 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2} \\approx 0.88424 \\text{ m} $$\n\nWe have two maximum possible lengths: $L_{\\text{pressure}} \\approx 0.86646$ m and $L_{\\text{deadspace}} \\approx 0.88424$ m. The snorkel must satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the actual maximum functional length is the smaller of these two values.\n$$ L_{\\text{max}} = \\min(L_{\\text{pressure}}, L_{\\text{deadspace}}) = \\min(0.86646 \\text{ m}, 0.88424 \\text{ m}) = 0.86646 \\text{ m} $$\nThe problem asks for the final answer rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ L_{\\text{max}} \\approx 0.866 \\text{ m} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.866}$$", "id": "1716955"}, {"introduction": "Physiologists and clinicians often use pressure-volume (P-V) loops to visualize and quantify the work of breathing.
