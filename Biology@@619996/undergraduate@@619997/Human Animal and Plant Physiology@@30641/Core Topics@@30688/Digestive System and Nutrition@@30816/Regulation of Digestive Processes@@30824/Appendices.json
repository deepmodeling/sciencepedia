As a meal travels from the stomach through the intestines, different regions must communicate to coordinate the release of acids, enzymes, and bile. This exercise [@problem_id:1738047] challenges you to map out this chemical conversation by predicting the timing of key hormonal signals. Understanding this temporal sequence is fundamental to grasping the overall flow of digestive regulation.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to study the endocrine response to a meal in a healthy human subject. The subject, after an overnight fast, consumes a large, balanced test meal rich in proteins, fats, and complex carbohydrates. Over the next four hours, blood samples are drawn periodically to measure the plasma concentrations of three specific gastrointestinal hormones: gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Your task is to predict the physiological response. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected temporal sequence of the plasma concentration peaks for these three hormones?\n\nA. CCK levels will peak first, followed by a simultaneous peak of gastrin and PYY as the meal is fully processed in the small and large intestines.\n\nB. Gastrin, CCK, and PYY levels will all begin to rise simultaneously upon ingestion of the meal, peaking together approximately one hour later before gradually declining.\n\nC. Gastrin levels will peak first, followed by CCK. The peak in PYY concentration will occur significantly later than the peaks for both gastrin and CCK.\n\nD. PYY levels will show the first and highest peak to signal satiety, followed by a peak in gastrin to initiate digestion, and finally a peak in CCK to facilitate absorption.\n\nE. Gastrin and CCK levels will rise and peak together as the meal enters the stomach and duodenum, followed by a much later peak in PYY concentration.", "solution": "We identify the principal sources, stimuli, and anatomical transit constraints for each hormone, then infer the expected timing of their postprandial peaks.\n\nGastrin is secreted by G cells in the gastric antrum, primarily stimulated by gastric distension, peptides and amino acids in the lumen, and vagal cholinergic input. After ingestion at $t=0$, the stomach rapidly experiences distension and exposure to peptides from the mixed meal, so gastrin secretion rises promptly during the cephalic and early gastric phases. Thus, the peak in gastrin concentration occurs early, soon after the meal begins to be processed in the stomach.\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted by I cells in the duodenum and jejunum, primarily stimulated by fats and partially digested proteins in the small intestinal lumen. CCK release requires that chyme exit the stomach and enter the duodenum. Because gastric emptying of a large mixed meal takes time and is slowed by fat, the arrival of significant stimulatory nutrients in the duodenum lags behind the initial gastric phase. Therefore, the CCK peak follows the gastrin peak, as chyme progressively enters the proximal small intestine. Consequently, $t_{\\text{peak,gastrin}}<t_{\\text{peak,CCK}}$.\n\nPeptide YY (PYY) is secreted by L cells predominantly in the distal ileum and colon, stimulated especially by fats and, to a lesser extent, proteins and bile acids arriving in the distal gut. The main rise in PYY requires nutrients to traverse much of the small intestine, which takes substantially longer than the time required for duodenal exposure. Although there can be minor early neural or endocrine components, the dominant postprandial PYY peak is delayed and often occurs well after the peaks of gastrin and CCK. Therefore, $t_{\\text{peak,CCK}} \\ll t_{\\text{peak,PYY}}$, yielding the overall ordering $t_{\\text{peak,gastrin}}<t_{\\text{peak,CCK}}\\ll t_{\\text{peak,PYY}}$.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A incorrectly places CCK first and suggests a simultaneous peak of gastrin and PYY later; this contradicts the early gastric phase rise of gastrin and the delayed distal-gut-driven PYY peak.\n- Option B posits simultaneous rise and peak; this ignores the anatomical and physiological delays between gastric, duodenal, and distal intestinal phases.\n- Option C states that gastrin peaks first, followed by CCK, with PYY peaking significantly later than both, which matches the physiological sequence derived above.\n- Option D incorrectly places PYY first and highest; PYY is characteristically delayed.\n- Option E claims gastrin and CCK peak together as the meal enters stomach and duodenum; while both rise early, CCK depends on duodenal entry and thus lags behind gastrin rather than peaking together.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate temporal sequence is gastrin first, then CCK, with PYY peaking significantly later, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1738047"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand a system, scientists often study what happens when a critical component is removed. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1738057] uses a hypothetical knockout mouse to explore the role of the Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor. By predicting the consequences of a broken signaling pathway, you will gain a deeper insight into the importance of CCK in fat digestion and the powerful nature of negative feedback loops in maintaining physiological balance.", "problem": "A team of physiologists has developed a line of knockout mice in which the gene for the CCK1 receptor is non-functional. The hormone Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone secreted by enteroendocrine cells of the duodenum and jejunum primarily in response to the presence of fatty acids and amino acids in the chyme. In a healthy animal, CCK binds to CCK1 receptors on various target organs, most notably causing potent contraction of the gallbladder and stimulating the secretion of enzyme-rich fluid from the pancreatic acinar cells.\n\nAssuming these knockout mice are fed a standard diet containing fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, which of the following options most accurately predicts the primary digestive insufficiency and the resulting chronic change in the plasma concentration of a key digestive hormone?\n\nA. Primary defect in protein digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.\n\nB. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically elevated plasma CCK levels.\n\nC. Primary defect in carbohydrate digestion; Chronically elevated plasma secretin levels.\n\nD. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.\n\nE. Accelerated gastric emptying; Chronically elevated plasma ghrelin levels.", "solution": "**Step 1: Analyze the physiological role of the CCK1 receptor.**\nThe problem states that Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released in response to fats and proteins in the small intestine. It then acts on CCK1 receptors. The primary functions mediated by these receptors are:\n1.  **Gallbladder Contraction:** This action releases stored bile into the duodenum. Bile salts are essential for the emulsification of dietary fats, breaking large fat globules into smaller micelles. This process dramatically increases the surface area available for enzymatic digestion.\n2.  **Pancreatic Enzyme Secretion:** This action stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to release a suite of digestive enzymes, including pancreatic lipase (for fat digestion), proteases like trypsinogen (for protein digestion), and amylase (for carbohydrate digestion). The stimulation of lipase secretion is a particularly strong effect of CCK.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the primary digestive insufficiency in CCK1 receptor knockout mice.**\nIn mice lacking functional CCK1 receptors, CCK, even if present in the blood, cannot execute its normal functions.\n-   The gallbladder will not receive the signal to contract. This leads to a failure of bile release into the duodenum, a condition known as biliary insufficiency. Without bile, fat emulsification is severely impaired.\n-   The pancreas will not receive the potent CCK signal to secrete digestive enzymes. This results in a marked deficiency of pancreatic enzymes in the intestinal lumen, especially pancreatic lipase.\nThe combination of failed emulsification (no bile) and lack of the primary fat-digesting enzyme (no lipase) leads to a profound inability to digest and absorb dietary fats. This is known as fat malabsorption or steatorrhea. While protein digestion is also hampered by the lack of pancreatic proteases, the dual failure affecting fat digestion makes it the most significant and primary digestive defect. Carbohydrate digestion is less affected as it begins in the mouth and involves brush border enzymes in addition to pancreatic amylase. Therefore, the primary digestive insufficiency is a severe defect in fat digestion.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the resulting change in plasma hormone levels.**\nThe stimulus for CCK secretion by the I-cells of the small intestine is the presence of undigested fats (fatty acids) and proteins (amino acids) in the lumen.\n-   In the CCK1 receptor knockout mice, fats are not being digested and absorbed.\n-   This means that the concentration of the stimulating molecules (fats and their derivatives) in the duodenal and jejunal lumen remains high for an extended period.\n-   This persistent stimulus leads to continuous and robust secretion of CCK from the I-cells. The feedback loop, where digestion and absorption of nutrients would normally remove the stimulus for CCK release, is broken.\n-   Consequently, despite the inability of the hormone to act on its target organs, its synthesis and secretion are upregulated. This results in chronically elevated levels of CCK in the plasma.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n-   **A. Primary defect in protein digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.** Incorrect. The primary defect is fat digestion, and CCK levels would be elevated, not decreased.\n-   **B. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically elevated plasma CCK levels.** Correct. This option accurately identifies the most severe digestive defect and the logical consequence of the broken feedback loop on hormone concentration.\n-   **C. Primary defect in carbohydrate digestion; Chronically elevated plasma secretin levels.** Incorrect. Carbohydrate digestion is not the primary defect. Secretin is released in response to acid, a different pathway.\n-   **D. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.** Incorrect. This option correctly identifies the digestive defect but incorrectly predicts the hormonal response. The lack of nutrient clearance leads to *increased*, not decreased, stimulation of CCK secretion.\n-   **E. Accelerated gastric emptying; Chronically elevated plasma ghrelin levels.** Incorrect. CCK normally slows gastric emptying, so its lack of function might lead to faster emptying, but this is a secondary effect, not the primary digestive insufficiency. The connection to ghrelin is also less direct and certain than the effect on CCK levels themselves.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the most accurate prediction is a primary defect in fat digestion coupled with chronically elevated plasma CCK levels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1738057"}, {"introduction": "The action of a hormone begins with its binding to a specific receptor, an interaction that can be described with mathematical precision. This problem [@problem_id:1738075] takes you from qualitative physiology to quantitative analysis, modeling how a hormone and a competitive drug vie for the same receptor. By calculating the impact of an antagonist on bile ejection, you will practice applying the principles of pharmacodynamics to a concrete physiological process, a crucial skill in both biological research and medicine.", "problem": "In response to a high-fat meal, specialized enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum and jejunum release a peptide hormone, hereafter referred to as \"Hormone X\". This hormone plays a crucial role in fat digestion by binding to receptors on the smooth muscle of the gallbladder, causing it to contract, and simultaneously binding to receptors on the sphincter of Oddi, causing it to relax. This coordinated action ensures the timely release of bile into the small intestine.\n\nLet us model this physiological process. The magnitude of gallbladder contraction, and consequently the volume of bile ejected, is directly proportional to the fraction of Hormone X receptors that are occupied by the hormone. The binding of Hormone X (L) to its receptor (R) is a reversible process governed by the equilibrium $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$, with a characteristic dissociation constant, $K_D$.\n\nA pharmaceutical company is conducting a trial for a new drug, \"Antagonin\" (I), designed as a competitive antagonist for the Hormone X receptor. Antagonin binds to the same receptor site as Hormone X but fails to elicit a biological response. The binding of Antagonin is also reversible, with its own dissociation constant, $K_I$.\n\nIn an experiment, a subject is given a standard high-fat meal, which results in a steady-state plasma concentration of Hormone X, $[L] = 3.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ M.

The subject is then administered a dose of Antagonin, leading to a steady-state plasma concentration of the drug, $[I] = 5.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ M.
