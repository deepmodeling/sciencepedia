Mechanical digestion, or mastication, is not merely about making food small enough to swallow; it's a critical step that prepares food for chemical breakdown. This exercise provides a quantitative look at the primary goal of chewing, demonstrating how breaking a large piece of food into smaller fragments massively increases the surface area available for digestive enzymes to act upon [@problem_id:1716724].", "problem": "In human physiology, mechanical digestion is the primary process by which food is physically broken down into smaller fragments, a crucial first step that increases the surface area for subsequent chemical digestion by enzymes. Consider a simplified model of this process. A single, solid piece of food, which is a perfect cube with a side length of 1.0 cm, is masticated (chewed). The result of this process is that the large cube is perfectly partitioned into numerous smaller, identical, non-overlapping cubes, each with a side length of 1.0 mm.\n\nCalculate the net increase in the total surface area of the food after it has been masticated.

The function of these enzymes is exquisitely tuned to their specific environment, particularly its pH.

The enzyme's activity in the stomach is approximately 1% of its activity in the mouth, indicating a significant reduction but not complete cessation of function.\n\nB.
