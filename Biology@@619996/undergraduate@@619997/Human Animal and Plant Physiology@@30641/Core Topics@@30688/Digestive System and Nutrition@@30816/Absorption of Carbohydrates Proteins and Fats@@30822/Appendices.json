However, all other aspects of their digestive system function normally, including the secretion of salivary amylase in the mouth, the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, and the expression of all enzymes on the apical membrane of enterocytes (the brush border enzymes) in the small intestine. This individual consumes a meal consisting primarily of starch.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of starch digestion in this person's gastrointestinal tract?\n\nA. Starch digestion will begin in the mouth, cease in the stomach, and then be severely impaired in the small intestine, resulting in a significant amount of undigested starch passing to the large intestine.\n\nB. The normally functioning salivary amylase will be sufficient to fully digest all the starch into absorbable monosaccharides once the chyme reaches the neutral pH of the small intestine.\n\nC. Starch digestion will be entirely absent throughout the digestive tract, as pancreatic amylase is essential for the process.\n\nD. The brush border enzymes of the small intestine, such as glucoamylase and isomaltase, will effectively take over the entire process of starch digestion, breaking it down directly into glucose for absorption.\n\nE. The acidic environment of the stomach will hydrolyze a significant portion of the starch, compensating for the lack of amylase activity in the small intestine.", "solution": "1) Identify the substrates and relevant bonds in dietary starch: native starch is a mixture of amylose and amylopectin containing predominantly $\\alpha\\text{-}1,4$ glycosidic bonds and branch points with $\\alpha\\text{-}1,6$ bonds. Efficient digestion requires luminal endo-$\\alpha$-amylase to generate smaller oligosaccharides (e.g., maltose, maltotriose, $\\alpha$-limit dextrins), followed by brush border exo-enzymes that hydrolyze these into monosaccharides, primarily glucose, for absorption.\n\n2) Enumerate the enzymes and their sites of action under normal physiology:\n- Salivary $\\alpha$-amylase initiates luminal endo-hydrolysis of $\\alpha\\text{-}1,4$ bonds in the mouth, producing small oligosaccharides. Its catalytic activity is optimal near neutral pH and is rapidly inhibited by gastric acidity.\n- Gastric acid does not enzymatically hydrolyze glycosidic bonds; nonenzymatic acid hydrolysis of starch is negligible under physiological conditions and time scale.\n- Pancreatic $\\alpha$-amylase is the principal luminal endo-amylase in the small intestine; it performs the bulk of starch depolymerization into oligosaccharides.\n- Brush border enzymes (maltase-glucoamylase, sucrase-isomaltase complex including isomaltase) act primarily as exo-enzymes on short oligosaccharides at the apical membrane, cleaving terminal $\\alpha\\text{-}1,4$ and $\\alpha\\text{-}1,6$ linkages to yield glucose. They do not efficiently hydrolyze intact, high-molecular-weight starch polymers in the lumen.\n\n3) Apply the patientâ€™s condition: complete absence of pancreatic $\\alpha$-amylase, with normal salivary amylase, normal gastric acid, and intact brush border enzymes.\n- In the mouth, salivary $\\alpha$-amylase will begin starch digestion, generating limited amounts of oligosaccharides before swallowing.\n- In the stomach, low pH denatures/inhibits salivary amylase, so luminal starch digestion effectively ceases.\n- In the small intestine, in the absence of pancreatic $\\alpha$-amylase, there is no effective luminal endo-hydrolysis of the remaining starch. Although brush border enzymes are present, their membrane-bound exo-activity requires short oligosaccharide substrates and is not sufficient to process bulk intact starch polymers in the lumen.\n- Consequently, starch digestion in the small intestine is severely impaired, and a substantial fraction of dietary starch remains undigested and passes into the large intestine, where it may be fermented by colonic microbiota.\n\n4) Evaluate the options:\n- A accurately states early oral digestion, cessation in the stomach, and severe small-intestinal impairment leading to significant undigested starch reaching the colon.\n- B is incorrect because salivary amylase is largely inactivated by gastric acid and is not sufficient to complete digestion in the small intestine.\n- C is incorrect because oral digestion by salivary amylase does occur initially.\n- D is incorrect because brush border enzymes cannot replace the missing luminal endo-amylase function for intact starch polymers.\n- E is incorrect because gastric acid does not significantly hydrolyze starch under physiological conditions.\n\nTherefore, the fate of starch digestion is best described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1690312"}, {"introduction": "Once carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides like glucose, they must be transported across the intestinal cell, or enterocyte, to reach the bloodstream. This is not a simple diffusion but a sophisticated, two-step journey involving distinct transport proteins on the cell's apical (lumen-facing) and basolateral (blood-facing) surfaces. This practice problem [@problem_id:1690290] uses a thought experiment with a specific inhibitor to examine the role of the basolateral transporter, GLUT2, revealing the crucial importance of the 'exit' step in the overall process of transepithelial transport.", "problem": "A novel experimental drug, Glucoblock, is being investigated for its effects on nutrient absorption. It has been determined that Glucoblock is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of the Glucose Transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein located exclusively on the basolateral membrane of intestinal enterocytes. It has no effect on any other transporters, including the apical Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1 (SGLT1) or the basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pump.\n\nConsider a healthy individual who has just consumed a meal rich in carbohydrates, resulting in high concentrations of glucose and galactose in the intestinal lumen. If this individual is administered an effective dose of Glucoblock, what would be the most immediate and direct effect on the intracellular environment of their intestinal enterocytes?\n\nA. The intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose will decrease.\n\nB. The intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose will increase.\n\nC. The activity of the apical SGLT1 transporters will be allosterically enhanced, increasing the rate of sodium influx.\n\nD. The intracellular concentration of sodium ions will decrease.\n\nE. The transport of fructose out of the enterocyte will remain unaffected.", "solution": "We analyze the transport processes and fluxes across the enterocyte membranes in the presence of a specific, non-competitive inhibitor of basolateral GLUT2.\n\n1. Under a carbohydrate-rich meal, the luminal concentrations of glucose and galactose are high. Apical uptake is mediated by SGLT1, a secondary active cotransporter that couples monosaccharide influx to the inward sodium gradient maintained by the basolateral $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{K}^{+}$ ATPase. Denote the net apical influx of glucose or galactose via SGLT1 by $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}$. With high luminal substrate, $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}$ is large and positive (inward).\n\n2. Basolateral efflux of glucose, galactose, and fructose from the enterocyte into the blood is mediated by GLUT2 (facilitated diffusion). Denote this efflux by $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}$ (outward).\n\n3. The drug Glucoblock is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of GLUT2 located exclusively on the basolateral membrane. Non-competitive inhibition decreases $V_{\\max}$ without changing $K_{m}$. Therefore, for GLUT2-mediated transport, the maximal efflux capacity is reduced independently of intracellular hexose concentration, so $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}$ is reduced toward zero at an effective inhibitor dose.\n\n4. The problem states there is no effect on any other transporters: apical SGLT1 and basolateral $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{K}^{+}$ ATPase remain fully active. Thus, $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}$ is unchanged by the drug at the instant of administration, and the sodium gradient is maintained.\n\n5. Let $C_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{glu}}$ and $C_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{gal}}$ be the intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose, respectively. On the immediate time scale after GLUT2 inhibition, their rates of change can be written schematically as\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{glu}}}{dt} = J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{glu}} - J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{glu}} - J_{\\text{met}}^{\\text{glu}}, \\quad\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{gal}}}{dt} = J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{gal}} - J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{gal}} - J_{\\text{met}}^{\\text{gal}}.\n$$\nImmediately upon inhibition, $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{glu}}$ and $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{gal}}$ remain high due to high luminal substrate and intact transporter and sodium gradient, while $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{glu}}$ and $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{gal}}$ are markedly decreased by the non-competitive inhibition. Intracellular metabolic consumption terms $J_{\\text{met}}$ do not change instantaneously.

Consider the distractors:\n- Option A is incorrect because blocking basolateral efflux cannot decrease intracellular glucose or galactose when apical influx is ongoing.\n- Option C is incorrect because the drug does not act on SGLT1; non-competitive inhibition of GLUT2 does not allosterically enhance SGLT1 or increase sodium influx.\n- Option D is incorrect because $\\text{Na}^{+}$ handling is governed by SGLT1 influx and the $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{K}^{+}$ ATPase efflux; neither is inhibited. There is no immediate direct decrease in intracellular $\\text{Na}^{+}$ attributable to GLUT2 inhibition.\n- Option E is incorrect because fructose exits the enterocyte basolaterally via GLUT2 after apical entry via GLUT5; inhibiting GLUT2 will impair fructose efflux and thus does not leave it unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct effect is an increase in intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1690290"}, {"introduction": "Failures in the intricate machinery of digestion and absorption can lead to significant clinical symptoms.

The enzyme sucrase, present on the brush border of the enterocytes, is fully functional and instantaneously hydrolyzes all the ingested sucrose into its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose.\n2.  Due to the mutation, there is absolutely no absorption of glucose from the intestinal lumen via SGLT1.\n3.  Fructose is absorbed via the GLUT5 transporter, which operates at a constant maximum rate, $J_{\\text{max,fru}} = 1.40 \\times 10^{-3}$ moles per minute.\n4.
