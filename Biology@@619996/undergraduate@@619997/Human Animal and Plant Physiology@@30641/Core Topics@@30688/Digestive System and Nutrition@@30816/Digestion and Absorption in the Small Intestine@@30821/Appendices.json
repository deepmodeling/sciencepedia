{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Effective digestion hinges on a series of precisely timed molecular events. While protein digestion begins in the stomach, its completion in the small intestine relies on a powerful cocktail of pancreatic enzymes. These enzymes are secreted in an inactive form, or zymogen, to prevent self-digestion; understanding their activation cascade is a fundamental concept in digestive physiology, which you will explore in the following problem [@problem_id:1703042].", "problem": "An individual on a high-protein diet consumes a meal consisting of pure collagen protein. Initial denaturation and proteolysis occur in the stomach via hydrochloric acid and pepsin, respectively. The resulting mixture of acidic chyme and large polypeptides is subsequently emptied into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. For effective absorption to occur, these large polypeptides must be broken down into smaller peptides and individual amino acids.\n\nConsidering the physiological events that happen *after* the acidic chyme enters the duodenum, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and sequential description of the initiation and propagation of the proteolytic enzyme cascade within the duodenal lumen?\n\nA. Cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to secrete active trypsin, which then travels to the duodenum and converts chymotrypsinogen and proelastase into their active forms.\n\nB. Pepsin, which is stable in the alkaline environment of the duodenum, continues its proteolytic activity and activates pancreatic trypsinogen into trypsin.\n\nC. The hormone secretin, released in response to acidic chyme, stimulates the pancreas to release zymogens and also directly cleaves trypsinogen into active trypsin within the duodenal lumen.\n\nD. A brush border enzyme, enteropeptidase, cleaves pancreatic trypsinogen to form active trypsin. This newly formed trypsin then catalyzes the activation of other pancreatic zymogens, such as chymotrypsinogen.\n\nE. The acidic chyme itself provides the necessary trigger, causing the spontaneous autocatalysis of trypsinogen into trypsin, which then initiates the activation of all other pancreatic zymogens.", "solution": "After acidic chyme enters the duodenum, the low pH stimulates S cells to release secretin, which primarily acts on pancreatic ductal cells to increase bicarbonate secretion; this neutralizes the luminal pH and inactivates gastric pepsin, which is not stable nor active at the more alkaline pH. Concurrently, peptides and fatty acids in the chyme stimulate I cells to release cholecystokinin (CCK), which acts on pancreatic acinar cells to promote secretion of inactive protease zymogens, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, and procarboxypeptidases.\n\nThe initiation of the proteolytic cascade within the duodenal lumen requires conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin by a brush border enzyme, enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase), located on the apical membrane of duodenal enterocytes. Once a small amount of trypsin is formed, trypsin catalyzes the activation of other pancreatic zymogens, including conversion of chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin and proelastase to elastase, and it also autocatalytically activates additional trypsinogen molecules. This sequence explains both the initiation (enteropeptidase-mediated trypsin formation) and propagation (trypsin-mediated activation of other zymogens) of the proteolytic cascade.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the pancreas secretes trypsinogen (inactive), not active trypsin.\n- B is incorrect because pepsin is inactivated by the alkaline duodenal environment and does not activate trypsinogen.\n- C is incorrect because secretin stimulates bicarbonate secretion and zymogen release indirectly via pancreatic function but does not directly cleave trypsinogen.\n- D is correct: enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen to trypsin, and trypsin then activates other zymogens.\n- E is incorrect because trypsinogen does not spontaneously autocatalyze in response to acid; activation requires enteropeptidase, and the duodenal environment becomes alkaline due to bicarbonate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and sequential description is that enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen, and trypsin propagates activation of other zymogens.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1703042"}, {"introduction": "Unlike water-soluble carbohydrates and amino acids, dietary fats present a unique challenge for absorption due to their hydrophobicity. The body has evolved a sophisticated multi-step process involving emulsification by bile salts and packaging into special transport particles. Tracing the journey of a single fatty acid from the intestinal lumen into the lymphatic system [@problem_id:1703068] solidifies the understanding of micelles, intracellular re-esterification, and the critical role of chylomicrons.", "problem": "The absorption of dietary fats is a multi-step process that differs significantly from that of carbohydrates or proteins. Consider the journey of a long-chain fatty acid, derived from the digestion of a triglyceride in the small intestine. Its ultimate destination after absorption by an intestinal epithelial cell, or enterocyte, is the lymphatic system, not the portal blood circulation.\n\nWhich one of the following statements correctly describes the sequence of events and key structures involved in the transport of a long-chain fatty acid from the intestinal lumen into a lacteal?\n\nA. In the lumen, the fatty acid combines with bile salts to form a micelle. The fatty acid diffuses from the micelle into the enterocyte. Inside the cell, it is re-esterified into a triglyceride within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, then packaged with proteins into a chylomicron. The chylomicron is exocytosed from the basolateral membrane and enters a lymphatic lacteal.\n\nB. In the lumen, the fatty acid is directly absorbed into the enterocyte via active transport. Inside the cell, it is packaged into a micelle, which is then exocytosed from the basolateral membrane and diffuses into a lymphatic lacteal.\n\nC. In the lumen, the fatty acid is packaged into a chylomicron. The chylomicron enters the enterocyte via endocytosis. Inside the cell, the chylomicron travels to the basolateral membrane and is released into the interstitial fluid, where it enters a blood capillary.\n\nD. In the lumen, the fatty acid combines with bile salts to form a micelle. The entire micelle is taken up by the enterocyte via endocytosis. The fatty acid is released and re-esterified into a triglyceride, which then diffuses directly across the basolateral membrane into a lymphatic lacteal.", "solution": "Long-chain triglycerides in the intestinal lumen are emulsified by bile salts and hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase (with colipase) to yield primarily free long-chain fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol. These hydrophobic products are incorporated, together with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, into mixed micelles whose amphipathic bile salts present a hydrophilic surface to the aqueous lumen. The micelle functions as a shuttle that delivers lipid monomers to the apical membrane.\n\nAt the brush border, long-chain fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol diffuse out of the micelle and across the apical membrane into the enterocyte; the bile salts remain in the lumen to be reused and later reabsorbed in the terminal ileum. Entire micelles are not endocytosed under normal physiology.\n\nWithin the enterocyte, long-chain fatty acids are activated to acyl-CoA by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and, together with 2-monoacylglycerol, are re-esterified in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum to form triglycerides. These triglycerides, along with cholesterol esters and phospholipids, are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein into nascent chylomicrons. Because triglycerides are too hydrophobic and large to diffuse across the basolateral membrane, they are packaged in these lipoprotein particles and transported via vesicles for exocytosis at the basolateral membrane.\n\nChylomicrons enter the interstitial space and, due to their large size and the structural features of lymphatic capillaries, preferentially enter the central lacteal of the villus rather than blood capillaries. They are then carried via the lymphatics to the thoracic duct and subsequently into the systemic circulation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA correctly describes micelle-mediated delivery to the enterocyte, diffusion of fatty acids from the micelle, re-esterification in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, assembly into chylomicrons, basolateral exocytosis, and entry into a lacteal.\nB is incorrect because long-chain fatty acid uptake is not via active transport and micelles are not formed intracellularly nor exocytosed.\nC is incorrect because chylomicrons are not formed in the lumen nor taken up by endocytosis, and they do not directly enter blood capillaries from the villus.\nD is incorrect because entire micelles are not endocytosed and triglycerides do not diffuse directly across the basolateral membrane; they are exported in chylomicrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1703068"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the pathways of digestion and absorption, a deeper physiological insight comes from quantifying the rates of these processes.
