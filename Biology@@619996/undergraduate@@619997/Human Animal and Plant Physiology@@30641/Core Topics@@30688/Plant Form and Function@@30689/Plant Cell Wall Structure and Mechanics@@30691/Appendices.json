A single, healthy plant cell is carefully isolated and placed in an isotonic solution, where it maintains a stable, positive turgor pressure. The isotonic solution is then gently replaced with a hypertonic solution, which has a significantly higher solute concentration than the cell's cytoplasm. The cell is left in this new environment until it reaches osmotic equilibrium.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the cell's state after reaching equilibrium with the hypertonic solution?\n\nA. The protoplast shrinks due to a net outflow of water, causing the plasma membrane to pull away from the rigid cell wall. The cell is now in a flaccid or plasmolyzed state, and its turgor pressure is near zero.\n\nB. The cell absorbs a large amount of water, causing the turgor pressure to increase significantly until the plasma membrane is pressed firmly against the cell wall, making the cell highly turgid.\n\nC. The cell rapidly swells due to the influx of solutes from the external solution and eventually bursts, a process known as cytolysis.\n\nD. The rigid cell wall prevents any significant change in cell volume, and the cell's internal pressure remains largely unchanged due to the structural support of the wall.\n\nE. Both the protoplast and the cell wall shrink in equal measure, maintaining contact between the plasma membrane and the cell wall, but resulting in a smaller overall cell size.", "solution": "We analyze water movement using water potential. For any plant cell, the water potential is given by\n$$\n\\psi_{w}=\\psi_{s}+\\psi_{p},\n$$\nwhere $\\psi_{s}$ is the solute (osmotic) potential and $\\psi_{p}$ is the pressure (turgor) potential. In an external solution open to the atmosphere, $\\psi_{p}^{\\text{out}}=0$, so $\\psi_{w}^{\\text{out}}=\\psi_{s}^{\\text{out}}$. At equilibrium, water potentials inside and outside are equal:\n$$\n\\psi_{w}^{\\text{in}}=\\psi_{w}^{\\text{out}}.\n$$\n\nInitially, the problem states the cell is in an isotonic solution and maintains positive turgor. In standard plant physiology, a truly isotonic external solution for a walled cell implies $\\psi_{w}^{\\text{out}}=\\psi_{w}^{\\text{in}}$ with $\\psi_{p}^{\\text{in}}=0$ (flaccid). Positive $\\psi_{p}^{\\text{in}}>0$ at equilibrium would require $\\psi_{s}^{\\text{out}}=\\psi_{s}^{\\text{in}}+\\psi_{p}^{\\text{in}}$, i.e., an external solution less concentrated (more positive $\\psi_{s}^{\\text{out}}$) than the cell sap, which is hypotonic rather than isotonic. Regardless, this initial detail does not affect the final state after transfer to a hypertonic solution.\n\nUpon replacing the bath with a hypertonic solution, the outside has a more negative solute potential, so $\\psi_{w}^{\\text{out}}<\\psi_{w}^{\\text{in}}$ initially, and water flows out of the cell. As water leaves, the cell’s volume decreases, the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall (plasmolysis), and the pressure potential declines. In a plasmolyzed plant cell, the cell wall no longer bears on the protoplast, so\n$$\n\\psi_{p}^{\\text{in}}\\to 0.\n$$\nAt the new equilibrium, $\\psi_{w}^{\\text{in}}=\\psi_{w}^{\\text{out}}$ is achieved by making the cell’s solute potential more negative (due to water loss and increased internal solute concentration) until\n$$\n\\psi_{s}^{\\text{in}}=\\psi_{s}^{\\text{out}}, \\quad \\psi_{p}^{\\text{in}}=0.\n$$\nThus the final state is a plasmolyzed or flaccid cell with the protoplast shrunken away from the wall and turgor pressure near zero. This corresponds to option A. Options B and C incorrectly predict swelling or bursting in a hypertonic medium. Option D is incorrect because the rigid wall does not prevent loss of water and turgor; $\\psi_{p}$ falls to approximately zero. Option E is incorrect because the wall does not shrink along with the protoplast; rather, the membrane detaches from the rigid wall during plasmolysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1731576"}, {"introduction": "While turgor pressure provides structural rigidity, it is also the driving force for cell expansion, which is the basis of plant growth.

This directionality is governed by the mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall, a property stemming from the oriented arrangement of stiff cellulose microfibrils. This final practice uses a mechanical model to explore how the presence of cross-linking molecules like xyloglucan creates this anisotropy, allowing you to see the direct and predictable link between molecular architecture and the final shape of the cell [@problem_id:1731596].", "problem": "The primary cell wall of a growing plant cell is a composite material primarily composed of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a matrix of pectin and hemicelluloses. The oriented deposition of stiff cellulose microfibrils allows the cell to control its expansion direction in response to internal turgor pressure, a phenomenon known as anisotropic growth. One of the key hemicelluloses, xyloglucan, is believed to act as a tether, cross-linking adjacent cellulose microfibrils.\n\nTo investigate the mechanical role of xyloglucan, we model a single, elongating plant cell as a thin-walled, closed-end cylinder with an initial length $L_0 = 12.0$ micrometers and an initial radius $r_0 = 6.0$ micrometers. The cell wall has a thickness $t$. The cell expands due to a constant internal turgor pressure $P$. The wall is treated as a linear orthotropic elastic material, meaning its stiffness differs in the longitudinal (axial) and circumferential (hoop) directions. For simplicity, we ignore the Poisson effect, and the extensional strains are given by $\\epsilon_z = \\sigma_z / E_z$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\theta} / E_{\\theta}$, where $E_z$ and $E_{\\theta}$ are the Young's moduli in the longitudinal and circumferential directions, respectively. The corresponding stresses are $\\sigma_z = Pr/(2t)$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta} = Pr/t$. The final dimensions after expansion are given by $L_f = L_0(1+\\epsilon_z)$ and $r_f = r_0(1+\\epsilon_{\\theta})$, where the strains are calculated using the initial radius $r_0$.\n\nIn a wild-type cell, the circumferential orientation of cellulose microfibrils results in high stiffness in that direction. The mechanical properties are given by $E_{\\theta, \\text{WT}} = 1250$ MPa and $E_{z, \\text{WT}} = 50.0$ MPa. Under sustained turgor pressure, a wild-type cell undergoes expansion until its length increases by 150% (i.e., its final length is $2.5$ times its initial length).\n\nNow, consider a mutant plant that is unable to synthesize xyloglucan. This genetic defect leads to stunted and fragile plants. Our model attribute this phenotype to a change in the cell wall's mechanical properties. The absence of xyloglucan tethers severely compromises the integrity of the cellulose network, drastically reducing the circumferential stiffness. The longitudinal stiffness is less affected. The moduli for the mutant cell wall are $E_{\\theta, \\text{MUT}} = 125$ MPa and $E_{z, \\text{MUT}} = 40.0$ MPa.\n\nAssuming this mutant cell starts with the same initial dimensions and is subjected to the same turgor-driven expansion process that causes the specified elongation in the wild-type, calculate the final aspect ratio, $L_f / r_f$, of the mutant cell.
