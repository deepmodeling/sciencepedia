{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding abstract concepts like the cohesion-tension theory becomes much easier when we can see the results firsthand. This exercise is based on a classic experiment that uses a simple colored dye to vividly trace the path of water through a plant's vascular system. By manipulating environmental conditions, you will explore how transpiration—the evaporation of water from leaves—acts as the powerful engine driving water up the xylem, making the invisible process of water transport visible [@problem_id:1734480].", "problem": "A student in an introductory plant biology course is tasked with designing an experiment to investigate the cohesion-tension theory of water transport. The student uses four identical, freshly cut white carnation flowers (Flower A, B, C, and D). Each flower's stem is placed in a beaker under different conditions for 12 hours.\n\n- **Flower A** is placed in a beaker containing 200 mL of pure, deionized water. The setup is left on a lab bench at standard room temperature (25°C) and 50% relative humidity.\n- **Flower B** is placed in a beaker containing 200 mL of a non-toxic, water-soluble blue dye solution. The setup is left on the same lab bench next to Flower A.\n- **Flower C** is placed in a beaker containing 200 mL of the same blue dye solution. This entire setup is then placed under a large, sealed glass bell jar, where the enclosed air is maintained at 100% relative humidity.\n- **Flower D** is placed in a beaker containing 200 mL of the same blue dye solution. This setup is placed in a fume hood with a constant, gentle flow of dry air (20% relative humidity) directed across the flower's petals.\n\nAssuming no significant wilting occurs in any of the flowers during the experiment, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected observations and the underlying physiological principles?\n\nA. Flower C will exhibit the most intense blue coloration in its petals, as the 100% humidity environment maximizes water absorption through the stem. The coloration will be evenly distributed throughout the petal tissue.\n\nB. All flowers in the dye solution (B, C, and D) will show an equal and moderate amount of blue coloration, confirming that water uptake in a cut stem is a passive process independent of environmental conditions.\n\nC. Flower D will show the most rapid and intense blue coloration, which will be concentrated in the network of veins within its petals. Flower C will show little to no blue coloration.\n\nD. Flower D will remain almost completely white because the constant airflow will cause widespread embolism (air bubbles) in the xylem vessels, immediately blocking all water transport.\n\nE. Both Flower B and Flower D will turn blue, but Flower B will be darker. The fan on Flower D will cool the petals via evaporative cooling, slowing down the metabolic processes that drive water uptake.", "solution": "The problem requires an understanding of the cohesion-tension theory, which is the primary mechanism for long-distance water transport in plants, including cut flowers where root pressure is absent. This theory posits that the evaporation of water from plant surfaces, a process called transpiration, creates a negative pressure potential (tension) in the xylem. This tension pulls the entire column of water up from the base of the stem, a process enabled by the cohesive properties of water molecules (sticking to each other) and their adhesive properties (sticking to the xylem walls). The dye in the water acts as a tracer, allowing us to visualize the path and rate of water movement.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for each flower:\n\n1.  **Flower A (Control):** This flower is in pure water under standard conditions. It will undergo transpiration and draw up water to remain turgid. It serves as a visual control and will remain white.\n\n2.  **Flower B (Standard Condition):** This flower is in the blue dye solution under standard room conditions. A moderate rate of transpiration will occur from the petals. This will create tension in the xylem, pulling the blue dye solution up the stem and into the vascular tissues (the veins) of the petals. Over 12 hours, the white petals will develop a visible pattern of blue veins.\n\n3.  **Flower C (High Humidity):** This flower is in an environment with 100% relative humidity. The water potential gradient between the air inside the leaf/petal and the surrounding air is zero. Consequently, transpiration is almost completely inhibited. Without transpiration, there is no significant tension created in the xylem to pull the water column upward. Therefore, very little, if any, of the blue dye solution will be transported into the petals. The flower will remain predominantly white.\n\n4.  **Flower D (Low Humidity and Airflow):** This flower is exposed to dry air and a constant airflow. Both of these factors drastically increase the rate of transpiration. The dry air increases the water potential gradient between the petal and the atmosphere, and the fan continuously removes the boundary layer of humid air from the petal surface, further promoting evaporation. This high rate of transpiration will generate a very strong tension in the xylem, causing a rapid and large-volume uptake of the blue dye solution. This will result in the most intense and widespread coloration of the petal veins compared to the other flowers.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n- **Option A:** This is incorrect. High humidity (100%) *inhibits* transpiration and therefore drastically *reduces* water uptake, it does not maximize it. Also, the coloration would be in the veins (xylem), not evenly distributed.\n\n- **Option B:** This is incorrect. The experiment is designed to show that water uptake is highly dependent on environmental conditions that affect transpiration. The outcomes for B, C, and D will be markedly different.\n\n- **Option C:** This is the correct statement. Flower D, under conditions of maximal transpiration, will pull up the most dye. Flower C, with minimal transpiration, will pull up the least dye. The dye is transported within the xylem, which constitutes the network of veins in the petals.\n\n- **Option D:** This is an overstatement and likely incorrect. While severe dehydration can lead to embolism, the conditions described are primarily intended to maximize transpiration, not cause immediate and complete transport failure. The initial and dominant effect will be an accelerated water flow, leading to more coloration, not less. Embolism might become a factor after a much longer period or under more extreme conditions, but it's not the primary outcome to expect.\n\n- **Option E:** This is incorrect. The dominant effect of the fan and dry air is the massive increase in transpiration, which far outweighs any minor temperature change effect on metabolic processes. The metabolic processes related to water transport in xylem are minimal as xylem cells are dead at maturity. Therefore, Flower D will be significantly darker blue than Flower B, not lighter.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the most accurate prediction is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1734480"}, {"introduction": "While xylem moves water up from the roots, the phloem network has the critical task of distributing the energy-rich sugars produced during photosynthesis. This thought experiment simulates the use of a radioactive tracer, $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$, to follow the journey of these sugars from a \"source\" leaf to various \"sink\" tissues that consume energy for growth and maintenance. Your challenge is to predict the distribution of these sugars, which will sharpen your understanding of source-sink dynamics and the pressure-flow mechanism that governs phloem transport [@problem_id:1734526].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted on a healthy, actively growing bean plant (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) which has mature leaves, young developing leaves at its apex, flowers, and a well-developed root system. A single, mature leaf located halfway up the main stem is carefully enclosed in a transparent, airtight bag. The air inside the bag is replaced with an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide labeled with the radioactive isotope carbon-14 ($^{\\text{14}}\\text{CO}_2$). The plant is kept under a light source to allow for photosynthesis, and after several hours, the bag is removed. The plant is then left for an additional 24 hours under normal conditions.\n\nAfter this 24-hour period, tissue samples are taken from different parts of the plant to measure the concentration of accumulated $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$. Assuming all listed parts are metabolically active, which of the following locations, *excluding the original treated leaf*, would you predict to have the highest concentration of accumulated radioactive carbon?\n\nA. The fibrous roots.\n\nB. A young, developing leaf near the apex of the plant.\n\nC. The pith (central parenchyma tissue) of the main stem.\n\nD. The vascular cambium tissue in the lower stem.\n\nE. A different mature leaf located on the opposite side of the stem from the treated leaf.", "solution": "The treated mature leaf is the only site that fixes $^{\\text{14}}\\text{CO}_2$ during the labeling period, so the $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ label first appears in photosynthetic products synthesized in that leaf. By the Calvin–Benson cycle, $^{\\text{14}}\\text{CO}_2$ is incorporated into $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$-labeled triose phosphates that are converted to export sugars (predominantly sucrose) within the source leaf.\n\nPhloem loading then transfers $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$-sucrose from mesophyll into companion cells and sieve elements. Loading increases solute concentration and lowers the sieve-tube water potential, drawing in xylem water and raising turgor pressure at the source. According to the pressure-flow (Münch) mechanism, bulk flow in the phloem proceeds from sources (high turgor) to sinks (low turgor), with volumetric flow along a pathway given conceptually by\n$$\nQ=\\frac{\\Delta P}{R},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the source-to-sink turgor pressure difference and $R$ is the hydraulic resistance of the phloem path. When multiple sinks are connected to a source, the partitioning of assimilate can be expressed qualitatively as\n$$\nJ_{i}\\propto \\frac{S_{i}}{R_{i}},\n$$\nwhere $J_{i}$ is the flux to sink $i$, $S_{i}$ is the sink strength (reflecting unloading capacity and metabolic demand), and $R_{i}$ is the effective path resistance to that sink. Thus, the greatest accumulation from a single labeled source leaf is expected in the nearest, strongest sinks along the same vascular pathways (orthostichies), especially rapidly growing tissues.\n\nRanking the candidate tissues by expected sink strength and effective proximity:\n1. A young, developing leaf near the apex is a strong sink due to high rates of cell division and expansion, high sucrose unloading capacity, and close vascular connection to subtending source leaves. It typically receives a large fraction of assimilate from nearby mature leaves.\n2. Fibrous roots constitute important sinks (particularly root tips), but the assimilate from a single source leaf distributes among many root branches and tips over a longer path length and higher cumulative resistance, lowering the concentration in any sampled segment relative to a single, strong apical sink.\n3. The vascular cambium is a sink in secondary growth, but in an herbaceous dicot such as *Phaseolus vulgaris* the cambial demand is modest compared to rapidly expanding young leaves.\n4. The pith is not a primary phloem unloading target and is weakly connected to the main assimilate stream; it has low sink strength for newly synthesized sucrose.\n5. A different mature leaf is typically a source under light and does not act as a net sink; net import of labeled assimilate into another mature, illuminated leaf is minimal.\n\nGiven these source–sink principles and the expected partitioning $J_{i}\\propto S_{i}/R_{i}$, the location with the highest accumulated $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$, excluding the treated leaf, is the young, developing leaf near the apex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1734526"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand the efficiency of water transport, we must move from qualitative observation to quantitative analysis. This practice introduces a powerful biophysical model, treating the xylem network like an electrical circuit where pressure difference ($\\Delta P$) acts as voltage and water flow ($Q$) acts as current.
