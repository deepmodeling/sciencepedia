Histochemical staining is a fundamental technique in biology that allows us to visualize these specializations by using dyes that react with specific molecules. This practice [@problem_id:1732068] challenges you to apply this principle by predicting the outcome of a classic iodine staining experiment on a potato tuber, reinforcing the link between parenchyma tissue and its vital role as an energy storage depot.", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating the tissue composition of a potato tuber, a modified stem specialized for nutrient storage. A thin cross-section of the tuber is prepared and mounted on a microscope slide. The biologist knows that the ground tissue system in plants is composed of three main cell types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma. To differentiate these tissues based on their function within the tuber, the biologist applies an iodine-potassium iodide (I2-KI) solution, which is known to change from its native yellowish-brown color to a deep blue-black in the presence of starch.\n\nBased on the primary function of a potato tuber and the characteristic roles of the plant ground tissues, what is the most likely observation after the staining procedure?\n\nA. All visible cells, regardless of wall thickness or shape, will stain a uniform, deep blue-black.\n\nB.

Large, isodiametric cells with thin primary walls, which constitute the bulk of the tuber's internal tissue, will stain blue-black, while other tissues remain yellowish-brown.\n\nE. The entire tissue section will remain yellowish-brown, indicating none of the ground tissues in the tuber contain the target substance.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of staining a potato tuber cross-section with an iodine-potassium iodide (I2-KI) solution. This requires understanding the function of the I2-KI solution and the primary functions and structures of the three ground tissue types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma.\n\nFirst, let's establish the principle of the chemical test. The iodine-potassium iodide solution is a classic indicator for the presence of starch. The polyiodide ions (primarily I3-) formed in the solution intercalate within the helical structure of amylose, a component of starch, forming a starch-iodine complex. This complex absorbs light differently than the solution alone, resulting in a characteristic deep blue-black color. The native color of the I2-KI solution is yellowish-brown. Therefore, the staining procedure is designed to locate starch within the plant tissue.\n\nNext, we must consider the functions of the three ground tissue types and their relevance to a potato tuber.\n1.  **Parenchyma**: These are typically living cells with thin primary walls. They are metabolically active and perform a wide variety of functions, including photosynthesis (in chlorenchyma), secretion, and, most importantly for this problem, storage of food reserves like starch, proteins, and lipids. Structurally, they are often large and roughly spherical or isodiametric. In storage organs like a potato tuber, parenchyma cells are specialized for starch storage, with their cytoplasm packed with starch-filled plastids called amyloplasts.\n\n2.  **Collenchyma**: These are living cells characterized by unevenly thickened primary walls, which provide flexible support to growing parts of the plant, such as young stems and leaf petioles. Their primary function is mechanical support, not storage. Therefore, they do not typically contain significant amounts of starch.\n\n3.  **Sclerenchyma**: These cells have thick, rigid secondary walls that are heavily lignified. Their primary function is to provide structural support and hardness to the plant. Mature sclerenchyma cells (like fibers and sclereids) are often dead and lack a protoplast. Their role is purely mechanical, and they do not store starch.\n\nA potato tuber is a modified stem whose primary function is to store energy for the plant, predominantly in the form of starch. The bulk of the fleshy part of a potato tuber is composed of storage parenchyma.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n-   **A. All visible cells... will stain... blue-black.** This is incorrect. Only tissues specialized for starch storage will stain. The protective outer layers (periderm) and any vascular tissues (xylem, phloem) or potential structural tissues would not be primarily storing starch.\n-   **B. Only the cells with unevenly thickened primary walls... will stain blue-black.** This describes collenchyma. Collenchyma's function is support, not starch storage. This option is incorrect.\n-   **C. Only the cells with very thick, lignified secondary walls... will stain blue-black.** This describes sclerenchyma. Sclerenchyma's function is rigid support, not storage, and the cells are often dead at maturity. This option is incorrect.\n-   **D. Large, isodiametric cells with thin primary walls... will stain blue-black...** This accurately describes the morphology of parenchyma cells. Given that the potato tuber's main role is starch storage, these parenchyma cells, which make up most of the tissue, will be filled with starch. Therefore, they will react with the iodine solution to produce a blue-black color. Other tissues, not being specialized for storage, will not react and will retain the yellowish-brown color of the iodine stain. This is the correct prediction.\n-   **E. The entire tissue section will remain yellowish-brown...** This would imply a complete absence of starch, which contradicts the fundamental biological function of a potato tuber as a starch storage organ. This option is incorrect.\n\nThus, the iodine will selectively stain the starch-filled parenchyma cells, which are characterized as being large with thin walls and making up the majority of the tuber's tissue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1732068"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond single-substance identification, advanced staining methods can simultaneously reveal the distinct chemical signatures of different cell types within a single tissue sample.

The petiole is known to contain three primary types of ground tissue cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma (specifically, stone cells or sclereids). The chemical composition of their walls is well-established:\n- **Parenchyma** cells have thin primary walls composed mainly of cellulose.\n- **Collenchyma** cells provide flexible support and have unevenly thickened primary walls rich in pectic substances.\n- **Sclerenchyma** cells provide rigid support and have thick, lignified secondary walls.\n\nThe physiologist wants to use a single, well-established staining protocol that can simultaneously differentiate all three cell types in one preparation based on their distinct wall chemistries.

Phloroglucinol-HCl (Wiesner reaction): a specific test for lignin that yields a cherry-red to magenta coloration in lignified walls. It is not a polychromatic stain and does not simultaneously differentiate pectins or cellulose; hence it cannot produce the stated three-color differentiation.\n\nB. Safranin followed by Fast Green: a classic double stain; Safranin typically stains lignified tissues red, and Fast Green stains cellulose-containing tissues green. While it differentiates lignified vs non-lignified, it does not produce the specified palette (lignin blue-green, pectin reddish-purple, cellulose blue), nor does it distinctly highlight pectin-rich collenchyma as reddish-purple via metachromasia.\n\nC. Ruthenium Red: a stain for pectic substances and mucilage, giving a red coloration to pectin. It does not simultaneously differentiate lignin and cellulose into the required colors and thus does not produce the desired polychromatic outcome across all three tissues.\n\nD. Toluidine Blue O (TBO): a basic metachromatic dye whose color depends on substrate chemistry and pH. Under appropriate mildly acidic conditions, TBO exhibits:\n- Orthochromasia on cellulose, yielding blue.\n- Metachromasia on pectin-rich regions, yielding reddish-purple.\n- Characteristic blue-green to greenish-turquoise on lignified tissues due to interactions with lignin.\nThis matches exactly the requested palette: lignified sclerenchyma blue-green, pectin-rich collenchyma reddish-purple, and cellulosic parenchyma blue.\n\nE. Aniline Blue: primarily stains callose and is used for sieve plates and pollen tubes; it does not provide the required simultaneous differentiation of lignin, pectin, and cellulose with the specified colors.\n\nTherefore, only Toluidine Blue O, used under appropriate pH conditions, produces the specified polychromatic differentiation corresponding to the wall chemistries of sclerenchyma, collenchyma, and parenchyma.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1732081"}, {"introduction": "The microscopic properties of plant tissues scale up to determine the macroscopic, physical characteristics of the entire organism, such as a stem's strength and flexibility.
