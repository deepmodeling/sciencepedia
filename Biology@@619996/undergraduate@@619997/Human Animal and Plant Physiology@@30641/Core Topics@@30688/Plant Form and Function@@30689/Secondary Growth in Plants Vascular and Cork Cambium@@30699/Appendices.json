Correctly identifying and placing their derivative tissues—secondary xylem, secondary phloem, and the components of the periderm—is the first step toward building an essential anatomical map for grasping the complexities of secondary growth.", "problem": "A botany student is tasked with analyzing the anatomy of a mature, woody dicotyledonous stem that has undergone several years of secondary growth. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in girth, which results from the activity of two lateral meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium (also known as phellogen). The student understands that the vascular cambium is a cylindrical layer of cells located between the xylem and phloem, while the cork cambium typically arises in the cortex. For the context of this problem, \"wood\" is defined as all tissues found internal to the vascular cambium, and \"bark\" is defined as all tissues external to the vascular cambium.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the tissues produced by these two meristems and their classification as either wood or bark?\n\nA. The vascular cambium produces secondary phloem internally (wood) and secondary xylem externally (bark). The cork cambium produces the epidermis and cortex.\n\nB. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem internally (wood) and secondary phloem externally (bark). The cork cambium and its derivatives (phellem and phelloderm) are also components of the bark.\n\nC. The vascular cambium produces primary xylem internally (wood) and primary phloem externally (bark). The cork cambium produces secondary xylem.\n\nD. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem internally (wood) and parenchyma externally (bark). The cork cambium produces secondary phloem.\n\nE. Both the vascular cambium and the cork cambium contribute exclusively to the formation of wood; the bark is composed entirely of primary tissues.", "solution": "We use the stated definitions and core anatomical principles of secondary growth in woody dicots.\n\n1) Definitions provided in the problem:\n- Wood is all tissues internal to the vascular cambium.\n- Bark is all tissues external to the vascular cambium.\n\n2) Fundamental principle of vascular cambium activity:\n- The vascular cambium is a lateral meristem that produces secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. Therefore, the secondary xylem is part of the wood (internal), and the secondary phloem is part of the bark (external). This directly follows from the given definitions and the positional polarity of cambial derivatives.\n\n3) Fundamental principle of cork cambium (phellogen) activity:\n- The cork cambium produces phellem (cork) to the outside and phelloderm to the inside. Together, the phellogen, phellem, and phelloderm form the periderm. Because the entire periderm lies external to the vascular cambium, these tissues are components of the bark.\n\n4) Evaluate each option against these principles and definitions:\n- Option A: Incorrect. It reverses the polarity of the vascular cambium (claims secondary phloem inside and secondary xylem outside) and incorrectly states that the cork cambium produces the epidermis and cortex; the cork cambium produces periderm (phellem and phelloderm), not epidermis or cortex.\n- Option B: Correct. It states that the vascular cambium produces secondary xylem internally (wood) and secondary phloem externally (bark), and that the cork cambium and its derivatives (phellem and phelloderm) are components of the bark. This matches the established principles and the provided definitions.\n- Option C: Incorrect. Primary xylem and primary phloem are produced by the procambium, not the vascular cambium. The cork cambium does not produce secondary xylem.\n- Option D: Incorrect. The vascular cambium does not simply produce “parenchyma” externally; it produces secondary phloem externally. The cork cambium does not produce secondary phloem.\n- Option E: Incorrect. Both the vascular cambium (via secondary phloem) and the cork cambium (via periderm) contribute to bark, which is not composed solely of primary tissues.\n\nTherefore, the only accurate statement is Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1740427"}, {"introduction": "Moving from static structure to dynamic function, this practice uses a classic thought experiment to explore the consequences of disrupting a key tissue system [@problem_id:1740477]. By analyzing the effects of girdling, you will deduce the indispensable role of secondary phloem in nourishing the root system. This exercise powerfully illustrates source-sink dynamics and the vital flow of energy that sustains the entire plant.", "problem": "In horticulture and forestry, the practice of \"girdling\" or \"ring-barking\" involves the complete removal of a strip of bark, including the phloem, cork cambium, and cork, from the entire circumference of a tree's woody stem or trunk. Following this procedure, it is observed that the leaves of the tree may remain green and photosynthetically active for a period of time, and the root system continues to have access to water and mineral nutrients from the soil. However, the root system invariably begins to die first, followed by the eventual death of the entire tree.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate physiological explanation for the death of the root system in a girdled tree?\n\nA. Girdling severs the xylem vessels, which immediately halts the transport of water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, causing the roots to die from dehydration.\n\nB. The removal of the phloem prevents root-ward transport of essential growth hormones, such as auxins, produced in the apical meristems of the shoot, leading to a cessation of cell division and root growth.\n\nC. The interruption of the phloem prevents the translocation of sugars, produced during photosynthesis in the leaves, to the roots, which starves the root cells of the necessary energy source for cellular respiration and metabolic maintenance.\n\nD. The removal of the protective cork layer exposes the inner tissues to soil-borne pathogens, which infect the cut area and systemically spread to the root system, causing widespread disease and tissue death.\n\nE. Girdling disrupts the osmotic potential gradient in the stem, causing water to leak out from the xylem and preventing the generation of sufficient root pressure to absorb more water from the soil.", "solution": "1) Identify which tissues are removed by girdling: The operation removes the bark, which consists of the periderm (cork and cork cambium) and the secondary phloem. The secondary xylem in the wood remains largely intact because it lies interior to the vascular cambium.\n\n2) Infer immediate physiological consequences from tissue continuity:\n- Xylem continuity implies continued ascent of water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves driven by transpiration pull and cohesion-tension. This matches the observation that leaves remain green and photosynthetically active and that roots still access water and minerals. Therefore, any explanation that requires immediate failure of xylem transport is contradicted by the observed persistence of leaf function.\n- Phloem continuity is severed across the girdle, interrupting mass-flow translocation (as described by the pressure-flow hypothesis) from sources (leaves) to sinks below the girdle (notably roots).\n\n3) Relate source-sink physiology to root survival: Roots are strong carbohydrate sinks and are largely heterotrophic; they depend on sucrose delivered via the phloem for cellular respiration to generate ATP required for maintenance, ion uptake, osmotic regulation, and growth. When phloem transport to the roots is interrupted, roots can only temporarily rely on stored reserves (e.g., starch). Upon depletion of these reserves, roots experience carbon starvation, leading to loss of metabolic maintenance and death.\n\n4) Evaluate each option against the physiology and observations:\n- Option A is incorrect because girdling does not sever the xylem; water and mineral transport continues, consistent with green leaves and initial root function.\n- Option B, while hormone transport (including auxin) can be affected by phloem interruption, the primary and most direct cause of root death is the loss of carbohydrate supply essential for respiration. Root cell division cessation does not immediately explain the observed sequence of root starvation and death.\n- Option C directly states the interruption of phloem sugar translocation, which is the principal cause of root starvation and subsequent death; it aligns with both the mechanism and observed sequence (roots die first due to lack of assimilates).\n- Option D is not the necessary or consistent cause; pathogen invasion is not invariably responsible for root death, and the sequence does not require systemic infection to explain the outcome.\n- Option E is incorrect because the xylem pathway remains functional and root pressure is not the primary driver of water ascent in transpiring trees; no essential osmotic gradient in the xylem is disrupted in a way that explains root-first death.\n\n5) Conclusion: The most direct and accurate physiological explanation is that the interruption of phloem transport prevents delivery of photosynthates to the roots, causing carbon starvation of the root system.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1740477"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to apply quantitative reasoning to understand the protective function of the bark, a product of the cork cambium [@problem_id:1740468].
