The experiment involves a seedling grown in a transparent medium, which is turned horizontally at time $t=0$. The root, initially growing straight, begins to curve downwards in response to gravity.\n\nThe student models the curving portion of the root as an arc of a a circle. This curvature is understood to be the result of a differential growth rate between the upper and lower sides of the root's zone of elongation, caused by the asymmetric distribution of the hormone auxin.\n\nAssuming the root has a uniform diameter $d$ in this zone, the student makes the following idealizations based on microscopic measurements:\n- The cells on the upper side (away from the direction of gravity) elongate at a constant rate of $v_u$.\n- The cells on the lower side (towards the direction of gravity) are inhibited by a higher concentration of auxin and thus elongate at a slower, constant rate of $v_l$.\n\nBased on this differential growth model, determine the expression for the radius of curvature, $R$, of the root's central axis. Express your answer in terms of $d$, $v_u$, and $v_l$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the radius of curvature, $R$, of the root's central axis based on the differential growth rates of its upper and lower surfaces. We can model the bending root segment as an arc of a circle.\n\nLet $R$ be the radius of curvature of the central axis of the root. The root has a diameter $d$.\nThe upper surface of the root is at a distance of $d/2$ from the central axis, farther from the center of curvature. Therefore, its path follows an arc with a radius of curvature $R_u = R + \\frac{d}{2}$.\nThe lower surface of the root is also at a distance of $d/2$ from the central axis, but closer to the center of curvature. Its path follows an arc with a radius of curvature $R_l = R - \\frac{d}{2}$.\n\nLet's consider the root bending through a small angle $d\\theta$ in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$. The angular rate of bending is $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$. This angular rate must be the same for all points across the root's cross-section (upper, lower, and central).\n\nThe linear speed of a point moving along a circular arc is related to the angular speed and the radius by the formula $v = r\\omega$. We are given the linear elongation rates for the upper and lower surfaces, which correspond to their linear speeds.\n\nFor the upper surface, the linear speed is the elongation rate $v_u$. Thus, we have:\n$$v_u = R_u \\omega = \\left(R + \\frac{d}{2}\\right) \\omega$$\n\nFor the lower surface, the linear speed is the elongation rate $v_l$. Thus, we have:\n$$v_l = R_l \\omega = \\left(R - \\frac{d}{2}\\right) \\omega$$\n\nWe can solve for the angular rate $\\omega$ from both equations:\nFrom the upper surface equation: $\\omega = \\frac{v_u}{R + \\frac{d}{2}}$\nFrom the lower surface equation: $\\omega = \\frac{v_l}{R - \\frac{d}{2}}$\n\nSince the angular rate $\\omega$ is the same for both, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{v_u}{R + \\frac{d}{2}} = \\frac{v_l}{R - \\frac{d}{2}}$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the radius of curvature, $R$. We can start by cross-multiplying:\n$$v_u \\left(R - \\frac{d}{2}\\right) = v_l \\left(R + \\frac{d}{2}\\right)$$\n\nDistribute $v_u$ and $v_l$:\n$$R v_u - \\frac{d}{2} v_u = R v_l + \\frac{d}{2} v_l$$\n\nGroup the terms containing $R$ on one side of the equation and the other terms on the opposite side:\n$$R v_u - R v_l = \\frac{d}{2} v_u + \\frac{d}{2} v_l$$\n\nFactor out $R$ on the left side and $\\frac{d}{2}$ on the right side:\n$$R (v_u - v_l) = \\frac{d}{2} (v_u + v_l)$$\n\nFinally, isolate $R$ by dividing by $(v_u - v_l)$:\n$$R = \\frac{d}{2} \\frac{v_u + v_l}{v_u - v_l}$$\n\nThis expression gives the radius of curvature of the root's central axis in terms of the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{d}{2}\\frac{v_u + v_l}{v_u - v_l}}$$", "id": "1719955"}, {"introduction": "While the branching architecture of a root system is visible to the naked eye, its true absorptive power lies at a much smaller scale.
