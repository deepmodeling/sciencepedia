This first practice problem takes us to the cellular heart of this process. We will explore the fundamental distinction between mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division) by considering a hypothetical scenario where this critical coordination is disrupted [@problem_id:1735939]. Understanding the outcome of this disruption is key to appreciating how tightly regulated the cell cycle must be to ensure proper plant development.", "problem": "A team of agricultural scientists is developing a novel herbicide, designated \"Partitio-Stat,\" designed to stunt plant growth. Laboratory analysis reveals that Partitio-Stat functions by specifically inhibiting cytokinesis in plant cells, the process by which a cell's cytoplasm divides to form two distinct daughter cells. However, the drug has no effect on mitosis, the process of nuclear division where replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. To test its efficacy, a solution of Partitio-Stat is applied to the root tip of a young, actively growing plant. The root apical meristem is a region of rapidly dividing cells responsible for primary root growth.\n\nAfter an incubation period sufficient for several cell division cycles to have normally occurred, a microscopic examination of the cells within the meristematic zone is performed. Which of the following observations would be the most likely outcome of the Partitio-Stat treatment?\n\nA. The majority of cells would be arrested in prophase, with condensed chromosomes visible but no further progression.\n\nB. The cells would be larger than normal and many would contain multiple nuclei.\n\nC. The cells would be significantly smaller than normal and most would be anucleated (lacking a nucleus).\n\nD.

To determine the outcome, we must understand the distinct stages of the cell cycle's M (mitotic) phase.\n\nThe M phase of the cell cycle consists of two major, tightly coupled events:\n1.  **Mitosis**: The division of the cell nucleus. During mitosis, the cell's replicated DNA, organized into chromosomes, is precisely segregated into two identical sets, forming two new nuclei at opposite poles of the parent cell. The stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n2.  **Cytokinesis**: The division of the cytoplasm. This process typically begins during late anaphase or telophase of mitosis. In plant cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a structure called the cell plate along the cell's midline, which eventually develops into a new cell wall, physically separating the two newly formed nuclei into two distinct daughter cells.\n\nThe problem states that Partitio-Stat inhibits cytokinesis but not mitosis. Let's trace the fate of a single meristematic cell under these conditions.\n\n- The cell enters the M phase and undergoes mitosis. It proceeds through prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase without interruption. At the end of telophase, the cell possesses two genetically identical nuclei.\n- Normally, cytokinesis would now occur. A cell plate would form and divide the cell into two. However, Partitio-Stat blocks this specific step.\n- Consequently, the cell plate does not form, and the cytoplasm does not divide. The result is a single, larger cell that now contains two nuclei.\n- This binucleated cell, having failed to divide, is now effectively in the G1 phase of the next cell cycle. It continues to grow and will eventually replicate its DNA (S phase) for both nuclei.\n- When this cell attempts the next M phase, both nuclei will undergo mitosis. This will result in the production of four nuclei within the same, single cell.\n- This process repeats with each attempted cell cycle. The cell fails to divide its cytoplasm but continues to replicate and segregate its genetic material. This leads to the formation of very large cells (since the cytoplasm grows but never divides) that are multinucleated.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\nA. The majority of cells would be arrested in prophase. This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that mitosis is *unaffected* by the drug, so cells would proceed through all stages of mitosis, including prophase.\n\nB. The cells would be larger than normal and many would contain multiple nuclei. This is the correct description of the outcome. Mitosis creates multiple nuclei, and the failure of cytokinesis prevents the cell from dividing, leading to an increase in cell size and a multinucleated state.\n\nC. The cells would be significantly smaller than normal and most would be anucleated. This is incorrect. The cells would be larger because they are not dividing, and they would accumulate nuclei, not lose them.\n\nD. The cells would appear normal in size and nuclear content, but the overall root tissue would be disorganized. This is incorrect. The fundamental properties of the individual cells (size and nuclear count) would be drastically altered.\n\nE. The cells would have multiple cell plates forming aberrantly within a single cytoplasm. This is incorrect. The drug *inhibits* cytokinesis, which means the cell plate, the key structure of plant cytokinesis, would fail to form in the first place. The drug prevents its formation, not causes its aberrant duplication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1735939"}, {"introduction": "Building a complex organism requires more than just an increase in cell number; it demands precise spatial organization. The apical meristems are masters of three-dimensional construction, and the orientation of cell divisions is their primary tool. This exercise focuses on how the geometry of cell division—specifically the distinction between divisions parallel (periclinal) and perpendicular (anticlinal) to the surface—establishes the distinct, concentric tissue layers in a plant root [@problem_id:1735946]. By examining a mutation that alters this pattern, you will gain insight into the genetic blueprint that dictates plant anatomy.", "problem": "In the primary root of the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the radial pattern of tissues is established in a highly organized manner by the stem cells in the apical meristem. The ground tissue, which consists of the cortex and the endodermis, originates from a stem cell population known as the Cortex/Endodermis Initials (CEIs). In a wild-type plant, a CEI cell first undergoes an asymmetric anticlinal division to regenerate itself and produce a daughter cell. This daughter cell then undergoes a single, precisely oriented periclinal division, giving rise to two new cells that become the progenitors of the cortex (the outer layer) and the endodermis (the inner layer). This process ensures the formation of two distinct ground tissue layers.\n\nConsider a mutant Arabidopsis plant that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in a newly discovered gene, `RADIAL-PATTERN-REGULATOR-1` (`RPR1`). The RPR1 protein is essential for triggering the periclinal division in the daughter cell of the CEI. In the `rpr1` mutant, the CEI still divides asymmetrically to produce a daughter cell, but this daughter cell fails to undergo the subsequent periclinal division. Instead, it proceeds to divide only anticlinally, like other cells in a developing tissue layer, and its progeny differentiate. The molecular signals that specify endodermal cell fate (such as the formation of a Casparian strip) are still present and functional within this single resulting layer.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the ground tissue phenotype of the `rpr1` mutant root?\n\nA. The root will have two layers of cortex and will completely lack an endodermis layer.\n\nB. The root will have a single ground tissue layer that possesses the characteristic features of an endodermis.\n\nC. The root will completely lack both cortex and endodermis layers, with the epidermis directly bordering the central vascular tissue (stele).\n\nD. The root will have two layers of endodermis and will completely lack a cortex layer.\n\nE. The root will display a disorganized proliferation of ground tissue cells, resulting in more than two layers.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the anatomy of the ground tissue in an `Arabidopsis` root with a specific mutation affecting cell division. Let's break down the developmental process in both the wild-type and the mutant scenario.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Wild-Type Ground Tissue Development**\nIn a wild-type `Arabidopsis` root, the ground tissue is composed of two distinct cell layers: an outer cortex layer and an inner endodermis layer. The problem states that both layers originate from a common stem cell, the Cortex/Endodermis Initial (CEI). The sequence of events is as follows:\n1.  A CEI cell divides asymmetrically in an anticlinal orientation (a division perpendicular to the surface of the root). This division serves two purposes: it creates a new CEI cell (self-renewal) and a daughter cell positioned further from the root tip.\n2.  This daughter cell then undergoes a periclinal division (a division parallel to the surface of the root).\n3.  This periclinal division produces two cells. The inner cell will give rise to the endodermis layer, and the outer cell will give rise to the cortex layer.\n4.  Subsequent anticlinal divisions of these progenitor cells elongate the two distinct layers. The final result is a root with one layer of cortex and one layer of endodermis.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Effect of the `rpr1` Mutation**\nThe problem describes a loss-of-function mutation in the `RPR1` gene. The function of the RPR1 protein is explicitly stated: it is \"essential for triggering the periclinal division in the daughter cell of the CEI\".\nIn the `rpr1` mutant:\n1.  The initial asymmetric, anticlinal division of the CEI still occurs normally, producing a daughter cell.\n2.  However, this daughter cell *fails* to undergo the crucial periclinal division.\n3.  Instead of splitting into two progenitors for two layers, this single daughter cell and its descendants will form a single file of cells. These cells will only divide anticlinally to expand the single layer as the root grows.\n\nTherefore, the `rpr1` mutant root will have only one layer of ground tissue instead of the usual two.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Identity of the Single Ground Tissue Layer**\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information regarding cell fate: \"The molecular signals that specify endodermal cell fate (such as the formation of a Casparian strip) are still present and functional within this single resulting layer.\"\nThe endodermis is defined by specific features, most notably the Casparian strip, which is a waterproof band in the cell wall. Since the signals for this endodermal identity are functional in the cells of the single ground tissue layer, this layer will differentiate as an endodermis. It will possess the features of endodermal cells, such as a Casparian strip. The cortex fate is never specified because the periclinal division that would have segregated the cortex progenitor cell never happened.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\nLet's evaluate each option based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A. The root will have two layers of cortex and will completely lack an endodermis layer.** This is incorrect. The mutation prevents the formation of two layers. It results in only one layer.\n*   **B. The root will have a single ground tissue layer that possesses the characteristic features of an endodermis.** This is correct. The failure of the periclinal division results in a single layer, and the problem states that the signals for endodermal fate are active, so this layer will have endodermal characteristics.\n*   **C. The root will completely lack both cortex and endodermis layers, with the epidermis directly bordering the central vascular tissue (stele).** This is incorrect. The CEI initial still divides to produce a lineage of ground tissue cells, so ground tissue is present, albeit malformed.\n*   **D. The root will have two layers of endodermis and will completely lack a cortex layer.** This is incorrect. The mutation leads to the formation of only one layer, not two.\n*   **E. The root will display a disorganized proliferation of ground tissue cells, resulting in more than two layers.** This is incorrect. The mutation is described as a loss of a specific division, not as a general loss of cell cycle control that would lead to over-proliferation. It leads to fewer layers, not more.\n\nThus, the most accurate description of the `rpr1` mutant phenotype is a single ground tissue layer with endodermal identity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1735946"}, {"introduction": "We now move from the qualitative aspects of cell division to a quantitative perspective.

In this model, the root tip is considered as a single file of cells organized into distinct zones. At the very tip is the meristematic zone, a region of length $L_m$ where active cell division occurs. The cells within this zone have a uniform, small average length, $l_m$. Within the meristem, there is a small population of mitotically inactive cells, known as the quiescent center, comprising $N_q$ cells. All other cells in the meristematic zone are actively dividing with a constant cell cycle duration of $T_c$.\n\nAs new cells are produced, they are displaced from the meristematic zone and enter the zone of elongation. In this zone, cells cease to divide and expand until they reach a final, constant length, $l_f$, in the zone of maturation. The overall rate of root elongation is determined by the rate at which new cells are produced in the meristem and their subsequent expansion.\n\nGiven the following parameters for the root:\n- Length of the meristematic zone, $L_m = 250.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Average length of a meristematic cell, $l_m = 10.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Number of quiescent cells, $N_q = 5$\n- Final length of a mature cell, $l_f = 150.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Cell cycle duration, $T_c = 18.0 \\text{ hours}$\n\nCalculate the rate of root elongation.
