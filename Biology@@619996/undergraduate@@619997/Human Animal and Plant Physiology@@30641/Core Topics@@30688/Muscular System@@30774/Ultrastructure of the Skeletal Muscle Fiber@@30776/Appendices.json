{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "At the heart of muscle contraction lies the cross-bridge cycle, a remarkable molecular process where myosin heads act as tiny motors, powered by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). To truly grasp this mechanism, it's crucial to understand the distinct roles of ATP binding versus its subsequent hydrolysis. This practice problem [@problem_id:1756567] presents a thought experiment with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue to isolate a key step, challenging you to deduce the state in which the myosin motor becomes 'frozen' and thereby clarifying how energy from ATP is used to drive movement.", "problem": "The contraction of a skeletal muscle fiber is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, a series of molecular events involving the thick filament protein, myosin, and the thin filament protein, actin. This process is critically dependent on the binding and hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a skeletal muscle fiber is permeated with a solution containing a high concentration of an ATP analogue, let's call it \"non-hydrolyzable ATP\" or \"nhATP\". This molecule has the following properties:\n1. It binds to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head with the same affinity as natural ATP.\n2. The bond between its terminal phosphate groups is exceptionally stable and cannot be broken (hydrolyzed) by the myosin's ATPase activity.\n\nIf this nhATP is introduced at a concentration that vastly outcompetes the cell's natural ATP for binding to myosin heads, what would be the resulting state of the majority of myosin heads within the muscle fiber's sarcomeres?\n\nA. The myosin heads will be trapped in the \"rigor\" state, strongly bound to the actin filaments.\n\nB. The myosin heads will be in a detached, high-energy conformation, prepared to execute a power stroke.\n\nC. The myosin heads will be in a detached, low-energy conformation, unable to bind to actin.\n\nD. The myosin heads will continuously execute the power stroke without detaching from the actin filaments, causing maximum sustained tension.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle can be represented by the following nucleotide- and actin-binding states of myosin:\n\n1. Strong-binding, nucleotide-free rigor state: $AM$ (actomyosin without bound nucleotide).\n2. ATP binding induces detachment: $AM + \\mathrm{ATP} \\to M\\mathrm{ATP} + A$. This step is driven by the principle that ATP binding to myosin reduces its affinity for actin, causing dissociation.\n3. Hydrolysis and cocking: $M\\mathrm{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ATPase}} M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$. Hydrolysis stores energy in the myosin head and places it in a high-energy, cocked conformation with weak actin affinity.\n4. Weak binding and force generation: $M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}} + A \\leftrightarrow AM\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$, followed by $\\mathrm{P_{i}}$ release to trigger the power stroke and then ADP release, returning toward $AM$ until ATP binds again.\n\nNow consider the introduction of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, $\\mathrm{nhATP}$, with the properties:\n- It binds the ATP site with the same affinity as ATP.\n- It cannot be hydrolyzed by myosin ATPase.\n\nAt high $\\mathrm{nhATP}$ concentration that outcompetes ATP, the dominant reactions are:\n$$AM + \\mathrm{nhATP} \\to M\\mathrm{nhATP} + A.$$\nBecause $\\mathrm{nhATP}$ cannot be hydrolyzed, the transition\n$$M\\mathrm{nhATP} \\not\\to M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$$\ndoes not occur. Therefore, myosin remains in the ATP-bound conformation, which is detached from actin and has low actin affinity. Without hydrolysis, the myosin head does not enter the cocked, high-energy $M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$ state and thus is not prepared to execute a power stroke. Moreover, because a nucleotide is bound, the rigor state $AM$ is not populated. Continuous power strokes are impossible without the hydrolysis and product-release steps.\n\nThus, the majority of myosin heads will be in the detached, low-energy conformation with $\\mathrm{nhATP}$ bound and unable to bind actin strongly.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1756567"}, {"introduction": "A muscle fiber's powerful cross-bridge motors remain idle until they receive a specific 'go' signal. This activation process, known as excitation-contraction coupling, translates an electrical nerve impulse into a chemical message—a sudden flood of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) into the sarcoplasm. This exercise [@problem_id:1756578] explores a hypothetical scenario where a toxin blocks the calcium release channels, providing a practical way to test your understanding of the precise sequence of events that link a nerve's command to the muscle's mechanical response.", "problem": "A newly discovered neurotoxin, named Paralysin-R, is found in the venom of a rare rainforest arachnid. Laboratory analysis reveals its sole mechanism of action is to function as a potent and irreversible antagonist of the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of skeletal muscle fibers. An experiment is conducted where an isolated skeletal muscle fiber is exposed to this toxin.\n\nAssuming that the neuromuscular junction, sarcolemma, T-tubules, and all contractile and regulatory proteins (actin, myosin, troponin, tropomyosin) are initially functioning perfectly, and that ATP levels are non-limiting, which of the following statements describes the most immediate consequence of Paralysin-R's action on the molecular events of muscle contraction after the fiber receives a single, above-threshold stimulus from its motor neuron?\n\nA. The action potential will be prevented from propagating down the T-tubules.\n\nB. Myosin heads will be unable to form cross-bridges with the actin filaments.\n\nC. ATP will be unable to bind to the myosin heads, preventing their detachment from actin.\n\nD. Acetylcholine will be prevented from binding to its receptors on the motor end plate.\n\nE. Sarcoplasmic reticulum pumps will actively transport an excess of calcium ions out of the sarcoplasm.", "solution": "The ryanodine receptor (RyR) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane in skeletal muscle is the channel that releases stored calcium ions into the cytosol during excitation-contraction coupling. In skeletal muscle, depolarization of the T-tubule membrane activates the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which is mechanically coupled to RyR. The sequence under normal conditions is:\n1) A motor neuron action potential leads to acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine binds to nicotinic receptors, and an end plate potential triggers a muscle fiber action potential.\n2) The action potential propagates along the sarcolemma and down the T-tubules.\n3) T-tubule depolarization activates DHPR, which mechanically opens RyR on the SR.\n4) RyR opening causes a rapid increase in cytosolic calcium, denoted $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n5) Calcium binds to troponin C: $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} + \\mathrm{TnC} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}\\mbox{-}TnC}$.\n6) This shifts tropomyosin on actin, exposing myosin-binding sites and allowing cross-bridge formation and cycling, provided ATP is available.\n\nParalysin-R is an irreversible antagonist of RyR; therefore, step 4 is blocked. After an above-threshold neural stimulus, steps 1–3 occur normally: the neuromuscular junction functions, the sarcolemma and T-tubules conduct the action potential, and DHPR is activated. However, because RyR cannot open, there is no SR calcium release, so $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ does not rise above resting levels. Without an increase in $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the equilibrium for $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding to troponin C does not shift toward $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}\\mbox{-}TnC}$, tropomyosin remains in the blocking position on actin, and myosin heads cannot access their binding sites. Thus, cross-bridge formation is prevented despite adequate ATP.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because action potential propagation along the T-tubules depends on voltage-gated sodium channels and membrane excitability, not on RyR function.\n- B is correct because blocked RyR prevents the rise in $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, so troponin C is not activated and myosin cannot form cross-bridges with actin.\n- C is incorrect because ATP binding to myosin is unaffected; ATP is non-limiting and RyR blockade does not alter the myosin ATP-binding site.\n- D is incorrect because acetylcholine binding at the motor end plate is upstream and unaffected by RyR antagonism.\n- E is incorrect because there is no excess cytosolic calcium to be cleared by SR $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-ATPases (SERCA) when RyR-mediated release is blocked; the most immediate consequence is failure of calcium release, not enhanced pumping.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate consequence is the inability of myosin to form cross-bridges with actin due to failure of calcium release from the SR.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1756578"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the molecular motor and its activation switch, we now zoom out to see the collective result of millions of cross-bridge cycles: the shortening of the sarcomere.

Therefore, the A band length remains constant.\n- I band: the region containing only thin filaments, spanning from the end of one A band to the beginning of the next; as thin filaments slide inward over the thick filaments, the non-overlap region decreases, so the I band narrows.\n- H zone: the central lighter region within the A band where there is only thick filament (no thin filament overlap) in the relaxed state; as contraction increases overlap, this non-overlap region decreases and can vanish at maximal contraction.\n- M line: the midline of the sarcomere where thick filaments are anchored; it remains present structurally.\n- Z disc: defines sarcomere boundaries; Z discs move closer together but do not disappear.\n\nTranslate the above to symbolic statements about band/zone widths:\n- Let $L_{A}$ be the A band length; then $L_{A}=\\text{constant}$ during contraction.\n- Let $L_{I}$ be the I band width; then $L_{I}$ decreases with increasing overlap.\n- Let $L_{H}$ be the H zone width; then as thin filaments slide toward the M line, overlap within the A band increases until, at maximal isometric contraction, $L_{H}\\to 0$.\n- The M line and Z discs persist structurally; they do not vanish.\n\nMatch to the observation in electron micrographs:\n- The “lighter region in the center of the dark band” visible in relaxed muscle is the H zone within the A band.\n- Upon maximal contraction, the H zone disappears due to complete overlap of thin and thick filaments in the A band, consistent with $L_{H}=0$.\n\nTherefore, the structure that disappears at maximal contraction is the H zone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1756593"}]}
