In this model, the maximum unloaded shortening velocity of the fiber, $v_{max}$, is inversely proportional to the total duration of a single myosin cross-bridge cycle, $T_{cycle}$. The cycle is modeled as consisting of two main phases: a 'power phase' with duration $t_{power}$, which includes actin binding and the power stroke, and a 'reset phase' with duration $t_{reset}$, which includes detachment from actin and re-cocking of the myosin head. The duration of the reset phase is determined by the rate of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and is thus inversely proportional to the activity of the myosin's ATPase domain.\n\nIn a normal, healthy fiber of this type, the reset phase accounts for 70% of the total cross-bridge cycle time.\n\nNow, consider a genetic mutation that does not affect the power phase but significantly impairs the myosin ATPase, reducing its catalytic activity to 35% of its normal value.\n\nAssuming the described model is accurate, calculate the ratio of the new maximum shortening velocity in the mutated fiber, $v'_{max}$, to the original maximum shortening velocity in the healthy fiber, $v_{max}$.

The nervous system does not simply switch a muscle \"on\" or \"off\"; it precisely grades the force output to meet demand. This problem asks you to interpret a common physiological measurement, the electromyogram (EMG), to deduce the underlying neural strategy [@problem_id:1717277]. Understanding this scenario is key to grasping how the principle of motor unit recruitment allows for the vast dynamic range of muscle force.", "problem": "An exercise physiologist is studying muscle activation during a challenging weightlifting task. A subject is asked to perform a slow, controlled bicep curl with a dumbbell that is near their maximum capacity. A surface Electromyogram (EMG), a technique that measures the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles, is used to monitor the biceps brachii. The EMG signal's amplitude is a measure of the summed electrical potentials from all active muscle fibers beneath the electrode. Initially, the signal amplitude is moderate and relatively stable. However, as the subject struggles to complete the final portion of the lift, the physiologist observes a sudden, sharp increase in the recorded EMG signal amplitude.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physiological explanation for this sudden increase in EMG amplitude?\n\nA. The amplitude of the action potentials in the individual muscle fibers that were already active has increased to generate more force.\n\nB. The nervous system has recruited a significant number of additional motor units, particularly larger ones, to meet the increased force demand.\n\nC. All the initially active slow-twitch (Type I) motor units have been deactivated and replaced by the activation of fast-twitch (Type II) motor units.\n\nD. The firing rate (frequency of action potentials) of the initially recruited motor units has increased, while the number of active motor units has remained constant.\n\nE. The muscle has undergone a rapid transition from a state of isotonic contraction to isometric contraction.", "solution": "We model the surface EMG as the summed motor unit action potential (MUAP) trains from all active motor units. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ denote the set of active motor units, and let the waveform recorded from motor unit $i$ at the electrode have amplitude scale $V_{i}$ (which reflects motor unit size and electrode geometry). If the firing of distinct motor units is approximately uncorrelated over the analysis window and unit $i$ fires at rate $\\lambda_{i}$, then the EMG root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude obeys the variance-addition principle for uncorrelated signals:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{RMS}}^{2}\\ \\propto\\ \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\mathrm{Var}(s_{i})\\ \\propto\\ \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\lambda_{i} V_{i}^{2},\n$$\nso that\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{RMS}}\\ \\propto\\ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\lambda_{i} V_{i}^{2}}.\n$$\nFrom this relationship, there are two ways to increase $E_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$: increase the firing rates $\\lambda_{i}$ of already active units (rate coding), or recruit additional units by enlarging $\\mathcal{A}$. Recruitment of a new, high-threshold, large motor unit $j$ introduces a new term $+\\lambda_{j} V_{j}^{2}$; because large motor units have larger $V_{j}$, this addition can cause a sudden, sharp increase in $E_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$. In contrast, rate coding tends to change $\\lambda_{i}$ continuously, producing a smoother amplitude rise rather than an abrupt jump.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles and basic neurophysiology:\n- Against A: The amplitude of an individual muscle fiber action potential is all-or-none under normal physiological conditions; it does not scale with force. Thus the claim that already active fibers increase their action potential amplitude is false.\n- In favor of B: Near maximal effort, the nervous system recruits additional higher-threshold, larger motor units according to Hennemanâ€™s size principle. The recruitment of large units (with larger MUAP amplitudes $V_{i}$) adds substantial new variance terms, explaining a sudden EMG amplitude increase.\n- Against C: Voluntary force increments follow additive recruitment; initially active slow-twitch (Type I) units are not switched off and replaced wholesale. Deactivation of the slow units would reduce, not increase, EMG amplitude.\n- Partially related but less accurate D: Increasing firing rates $\\lambda_{i}$ of already active units elevates EMG amplitude, but typically in a smoother fashion. A sudden sharp increase is more consistent with the discrete recruitment of large, high-threshold motor units.\n- Against E: A shift toward isometric mechanics at a sticking point does not by itself mechanistically produce a sudden EMG amplitude increase; the neural drive change (recruitment of additional units and/or rate coding) is the proximate cause. Among the listed explanations, recruitment of additional, larger motor units best accounts for the abrupt increase.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation for the observed sudden increase in EMG amplitude is the recruitment of additional motor units, particularly larger ones, to meet the increased force demand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1717277"}]}
