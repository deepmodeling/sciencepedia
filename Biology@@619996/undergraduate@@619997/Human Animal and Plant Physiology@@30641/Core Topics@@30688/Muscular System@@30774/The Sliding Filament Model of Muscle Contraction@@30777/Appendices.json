The sarcomere has a resting length of $L_0 = 2.5 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. During an isotonic contraction, the sarcomere shortens by 20% of its initial resting length. This shortening is a result of thin (actin) filaments sliding past thick (myosin) filaments, a process described by the sliding filament model. The shortening is symmetric, meaning the thin filaments anchored at the Z-discs on both ends of the sarcomere slide equally towards the central M-line.\n\nThe sliding motion is driven by the cyclical binding and unbinding of myosin heads to the actin filaments. Each complete cycle, known as a cross-bridge cycle, culminates in a \"power stroke\" that pulls the actin filament by a discrete distance. For this particular muscle fiber, a single power stroke moves an actin filament by a distance of $d = 10 \\, \\text{nm}$.\n\nAssuming that the action of the myosin heads on one half of the sarcomere is synchronized, calculate the number of cross-bridge cycles that must occur for the actin filaments attached to a single Z-disc to produce the total observed sarcomere shortening. Report your answer as an integer.", "solution": "The sliding filament model states that sarcomere shortening arises from actin filaments sliding past myosin filaments. For symmetric shortening, both halves of the sarcomere contribute equally, so the displacement of the actin attached to a single Z-disc is half of the total sarcomere shortening.\n\nGiven resting length $L_{0}$ and shortening fraction $s = 0.2$, the total sarcomere shortening is\n$$\n\\Delta L = s L_{0} = 0.2 L_{0}.\n$$\nSymmetry implies the displacement required from one Z-disc is\n$$\nx = \\frac{\\Delta L}{2} = \\frac{0.2 L_{0}}{2} = 0.1 L_{0}.\n$$\nEach cross-bridge cycle produces a power stroke of length $d$, so the number of synchronized cycles needed on one half-sarcomere is obtained by\n$$\nN d = x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N = \\frac{x}{d} = \\frac{0.1 L_{0}}{d}.\n$$\nSubstituting $L_{0} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$ and $d = 10 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$,\n$$\nN = \\frac{0.1 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-6}}{10 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{0.25}{10} \\times 10^{3} = 25.\n$$\nThus, $25$ cross-bridge cycles are required for the actin filaments attached to a single Z-disc to account for the observed shortening.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25}$$", "id": "1753050"}, {"introduction": "Force generation in a muscle fiber is not constant; it critically depends on the muscle's starting length. This practice explores the famous length-tension relationship, which is a direct consequence of the filament overlap described by the sliding filament model. By considering a muscle stretched far beyond its optimal length [@problem_id:1721237], you will learn to distinguish between the active force generated by cross-bridges and the passive force from the muscle's elastic components.", "problem": "In the study of muscle physiology, the length-tension relationship is a cornerstone principle describing how the force a muscle can generate depends on its length. Consider an isolated skeletal muscle fiber whose sarcomeres have an optimal length, denoted as $L_o$. At this length, the overlap between the thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments is ideal, allowing for the generation of maximum active tension upon stimulation.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where this muscle fiber is passively stretched to a new length of $1.75 L_o$. At this substantially increased length, the fiber is then subjected to a maximal electrical stimulus to induce a contraction. Based on the principles of the sliding filament model and the components of muscle tension, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the state of tension in the fiber at the length of $1.75 L_o$?\n\nA. The active tension will be maximal because the filaments are stretched, increasing their potential for interaction. The total tension will be equal to this maximal active tension.\n\nB. Both the active tension and the passive tension will be approximately zero, resulting in a total tension that is negligible.\n\nC. The active tension will be approximately zero due to minimal overlap between actin and myosin filaments, but the total measured tension will be significant due to high passive tension from stretched elastic elements.\n\nD. The active tension will be approximately half of its maximum value, and the passive tension will be negligible, making the total tension moderate.\n\nE. The muscle fiber will fail to respond to the electrical stimulus at this length, and thus no tension of any kind can be generated.", "solution": "Define $L$ as the instantaneous sarcomere length and $L_{o}$ as the optimal sarcomere length for maximal active force. The total tension measured during a contraction at a fixed length is the sum of active and passive components:\n$$\nT_{\\text{tot}}(L) = T_{a}(L) + T_{p}(L).\n$$\n\nBy the sliding filament model, active tension $T_{a}(L)$ is proportional to the number of actin-myosin cross-bridges that can form, which depends on the overlap between thin and thick filaments. This overlap is maximal at $L_{o}$, yielding maximal $T_{a}(L_{o})$. For lengths $L > L_{o}$, filament overlap decreases; as $L$ increases sufficiently, the overlap approaches zero, and therefore\n$$\nT_{a}(L) \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as} \\quad \\text{overlap} \\to 0.\n$$\nAt a substantially increased length such as $L = 1.75 L_{o}$, the sarcomere is well beyond $L_{o}$; the overlap between actin and myosin is minimal or absent, so\n$$\nT_{a}(1.75 L_{o}) \\approx 0.\n$$\n\nPassive tension $T_{p}(L)$ arises from elastic elements (notably titin within the sarcomere and connective tissue in series and parallel). For lengths near and below slack length (near $L_{o}$), $T_{p}(L)$ is small. As $L$ is increased beyond slack, $T_{p}(L)$ increases steeply (often nonlinearly, e.g., exponentially) with stretch:\n$$\nL > L_{\\text{slack}} \\implies T_{p}(L) \\text{ increases rapidly}.\n$$\nTherefore, at $L = 1.75 L_{o}$,\n$$\nT_{p}(1.75 L_{o}) \\gg 0,\n$$\nand the total tension is dominated by passive elements:\n$$\nT_{\\text{tot}}(1.75 L_{o}) = T_{a}(1.75 L_{o}) + T_{p}(1.75 L_{o}) \\approx 0 + T_{p}(1.75 L_{o}) = T_{p}(1.75 L_{o}),\n$$\nwhich is significant.\n\nComparing to the statements: maximal active tension when stretched (A) contradicts the sliding filament model; both active and passive near zero (B) is false because passive tension is high when stretched; moderate total with half-max active and negligible passive (D) is inconsistent with both the decline of active tension and the rise of passive tension at long lengths; failure to respond to stimulus (E) is incorrect for an otherwise viable fiber. The correct description is that active tension is approximately zero due to minimal overlap, while total tension is significant due to high passive tension, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1721237"}, {"introduction": "While we often study the cycle of a single myosin head, a muscle's true function emerges from the collective action of billions of these molecular motors. This thought experiment explores the vital importance of their uncoordinated, or asynchronous, cycling [@problem_id:1753020]. By analyzing the hypothetical outcome of perfectly synchronized cross-bridges, you will discover why asynchrony is a crucial biological design principle for producing smooth, sustained force.", "problem": "In a healthy skeletal muscle fiber, the contraction process is driven by the sliding filament model, where thousands of myosin heads on thick filaments asynchronously cycle through binding to actin on thin filaments, performing a power stroke, and detaching. This asynchrony ensures a smooth, sustained generation of force.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a researcher introduces a chemical agent to an isolated, electrically stimulated muscle fiber. This agent forces all myosin heads within that single fiber to operate in perfect synchrony. That is, every single myosin head simultaneously binds to actin, performs its power stroke at the same instant, detaches after binding with Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and re-cocks its head in unison. Assume that the supply of ATP and calcium ions remains sufficient to allow this cycling to continue indefinitely as long as the stimulus is present.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the mechanical output of this synchronously cycling muscle fiber?\n\nA. The fiber will generate a much larger maximum tetanic tension than a normal fiber because all force-generating elements are active at the same time.\n\nB. The fiber will be unable to generate any net force or produce shortening, as the synchronous power strokes and detachments will cancel each other out over time.\n\nC. The fiber will produce a series of rapid, discrete \"jerks\" or twitches, resulting in very little sustained tension or effective shortening.\n\nD. The fiber will immediately enter a state equivalent to rigor mortis, with all heads becoming permanently locked to the actin filaments.\n\nE. The fiber will produce a smooth, sustained contraction identical to a normal fused tetanus, but at a significantly lower energy cost.", "solution": "The relevant physical and physiological principle is the cross-bridge theory with a finite duty ratio, where each myosin head spends a fraction of its cycle attached and generating force, and the remainder detached. Let $N$ be the number of myosin heads and $f_{0}$ the mean force per attached head. Let the duty ratio be $d$, the fraction of the cycle duration $T$ during which a head is strongly bound and generating force.\n\nIn a normal asynchronous fiber, the heads are randomly phased, so at any moment approximately $N d$ heads are attached. The macroscopic force is the sum of many independent microscopic forces, yielding a near-constant tension\n$$\nF_{\\text{async}} \\approx N d f_{0},\n$$\nwhich produces smooth, sustained force because detachments of some heads are compensated by attachments of others.\n\nIn the hypothetical synchronous fiber, all heads bind, power stroke, detach, and re-cock in perfect unison. The time course of force from the contractile element becomes pulsatile:\n$$\nF_{\\text{sync}}(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\nN f_{0}, & \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\mod T < dT, \\\\\n0, & \\text{for } dT \\le t \\mod T < T.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThus the instantaneous force alternates between a high value during the brief attached phase and nearly zero during the detached phase. While the time-average of this waveform equals $\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}F_{\\text{sync}}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = N d f_{0}$, the key mechanical consequence is the lack of overlap between force-generating elements across the cycle: during the detached interval, no heads remain attached to sustain force.\n\nIncluding the muscle’s series elastic component (SEC) from the Hill-type model clarifies the output: during the synchronous power stroke, the contractile element abruptly increases force and shortens, stretching the SEC and producing a transient force spike and a small shortening “jerk.” When all heads detach simultaneously, the contractile element force drops to zero, the SEC recoils, and externally measured force falls toward zero while the muscle re-lengthens under load. Repetition at the cross-bridge cycling frequency yields rapid, discrete twitches or “jerks,” not a continuous plateau.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because “maximum tetanic tension” refers to the sustained steady plateau under fused stimulation; synchrony eliminates sustained force by creating force-free gaps, so there is no larger sustained tetanic plateau.\n- B is incorrect because each synchronous attached phase does generate positive force and can produce transient shortening; this does not cancel to zero instantaneously, though net effective shortening against a load is minimal due to re-lengthening during the detached phase.\n- C is correct: the fiber will exhibit rapid, discrete jerks with little sustained tension or effective shortening because all heads let go together, preventing continuous load-bearing.\n- D is incorrect because rigor requires absence of ATP; here ATP is sufficient, so heads detach normally.\n- E is incorrect because smooth sustained contraction requires asynchrony; synchrony does not lower energy cost and in fact wastes work due to repeated loading and unloading of the SEC without sustained external work.\n\nTherefore, the synchronous cycling yields pulsatile, twitch-like output with minimal sustained force or effective shortening.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1753020"}]}
