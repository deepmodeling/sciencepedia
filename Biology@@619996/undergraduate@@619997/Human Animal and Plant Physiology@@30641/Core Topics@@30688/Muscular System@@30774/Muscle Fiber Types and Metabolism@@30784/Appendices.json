This deficiency prevents the re-synthesis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from creatine phosphate. All other aspects of the athlete's muscle physiology, including glycogen storage, the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, and mitochondrial function, are considered normal.\n\nThe athlete attempts to compete in two events: a 100-meter sprint and an 800-meter run. Given the specific nature of this metabolic impairment, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected impact on their performance compared to an unaffected athlete with similar training?\n\nA. Performance in the 100-meter sprint will be normal, but performance in the 800-meter run will be severely impaired due to rapid glycogen depletion.\n\nB. Performance will be severely impaired in the 100-meter sprint, while performance in the 800-meter run will be only moderately impaired, primarily affecting the initial acceleration.\n\nC. Performance will be severely impaired in both the 100-meter sprint and the 800-meter run because the lack of creatine phosphate prevents any form of high-intensity exercise.\n\nD. Performance will be normal in both events because the glycolytic pathway can immediately compensate for the lack of ATP from the creatine phosphate system.\n\nE. Performance in the 800-meter run will be normal, but the athlete will be unable to even start the 100-meter sprint due to a complete lack of initial ATP.", "solution": "The key biochemical step affected is the phosphagen system reaction, normally catalyzed by creatine kinase (CK), which rapidly buffers and regenerates ATP at the onset of contraction:\n$$\\mathrm{PCr} + \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{Cr} \\quad (\\text{catalyzed by CK}).$$\nWith near-total CK deficiency in skeletal muscle, the rapid re-synthesis of ATP from phosphocreatine is essentially absent. The immediate consequences follow from basic exercise bioenergetics:\n1) At the onset of maximal effort, power output depends on the rate of ATP resynthesis. The phosphagen system is the fastest ATP supply and normally sustains peak power for the first seconds of high-intensity exercise. Without CK, the muscle cannot rapidly regenerate ATP from phosphocreatine; only the small resting ATP pool is available until glycolysis ramps up. Therefore, peak power and initial acceleration are markedly impaired.\n2) Anaerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are intact by assumption. Glycolysis can provide high ATP flux after a brief delay, and oxidative phosphorylation supports longer-duration efforts once oxygen delivery and mitochondrial enzymes meet demand. Thus, over efforts lasting well beyond the initial seconds, performance can be sustained without the phosphagen system, albeit with compromised starts and surges.\n\nApplying these principles to the two events:\n- For the 100-meter sprint, performance critically depends on the first seconds of explosive power and acceleration, during which the phosphagen system normally dominates ATP resynthesis. Without CK, there is a profound deficit in initial and peak power; although glycolysis contributes, the delay in achieving high flux and the lack of the immediate ATP buffer cause severe impairment overall.\n- For the 800-meter run, the energy contribution shifts increasingly to anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation after the initial phase. Since both pathways are normal, the athlete can sustain a substantial fraction of expected performance once underway. The main deficit is during the start and any surges, so the overall impairment is moderate rather than severe. There is no compelling mechanism for severe, rapid glycogen depletion uniquely causing failure within this distance, given normal glycolysis and mitochondrial function.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because 100-meter performance would not be normal; it is heavily dependent on the phosphagen system.\n- B is correct: severe impairment in the 100-meter sprint, with only moderate impairment in the 800-meter run, primarily affecting initial acceleration.\n- C is incorrect because high-intensity exercise beyond the first seconds can proceed via glycolysis; lack of phosphocreatine does not preclude all high-intensity work.\n- D is incorrect; glycolysis cannot immediately compensate for the absent rapid ATP buffering of the phosphagen system.\n- E is incorrect; resting ATP allows initiation of contraction, so the athlete can start, albeit poorly.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is best described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1720819"}, {"introduction": "For endurance efforts lasting more than a few minutes, muscles depend on the oxidative metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. While fat stores are nearly limitless, the rate at which they can be converted to energy is finite, creating a potential bottleneck at high exercise intensities.
