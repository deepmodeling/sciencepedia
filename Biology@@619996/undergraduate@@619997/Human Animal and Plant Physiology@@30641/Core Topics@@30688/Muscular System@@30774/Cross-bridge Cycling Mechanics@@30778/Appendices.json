This exercise [@problem_id:1702108] explores the fundamental structural requirement for contraction by examining an extreme scenario of sarcomere stretching. By considering the consequences of eliminating the overlap between actin and myosin filaments, we can isolate the very first and most essential step in the cross-bridge cycle: the physical binding of myosin to actin.", "problem": "In a cellular biophysics laboratory, an experiment is conducted on an isolated skeletal muscle fiber. The fiber is maintained in an aqueous solution with optimal physiological concentrations of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and a non-depleting supply of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The cross-bridge cycle, the fundamental process of muscle contraction, involves four key stages: (1) The binding of an energized myosin head to an actin filament. (2) The \"power stroke,\" where the myosin head pivots, pulling the actin filament. (3) The detachment of the myosin head from actin upon binding a new ATP molecule. (4) The re-energizing (\"re-cocking\") of the myosin head via ATP hydrolysis into Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\nUsing high-precision micromanipulators, a single sarcomere within the muscle fiber is stretched to approximately 150% of its resting length. At this extreme length, there is no longer any physical overlap between the thick (myosin) filaments and the thin (actin) filaments. Assuming all other conditions for contraction remain ideal, which of the following essential events in muscle contraction is primarily and directly inhibited by this lack of filament overlap?\n\nA. The binding of the energized myosin head to its corresponding site on the actin filament.\nB. The \"power stroke,\" where the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) triggers the myosin head to pivot and pull the actin filament.\nC. The binding of a new Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecule to the myosin head, leading to its detachment from actin.\nD. The hydrolysis of ATP into Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Pi, which energizes and \"re-cocks\" the myosin head.\nE. The release of Ca$^{2+}$ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and their subsequent binding to troponin.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle requires physical proximity between myosin heads on the thick filament and binding sites on actin of the thin filament. With optimal $Ca^{2+}$ and ATP, the biochemical readiness for cycling is present, but mechanical interaction requires filament overlap.\n\nAt approximately 150 percent of resting sarcomere length with no overlap between thick and thin filaments, myosin heads cannot physically reach actin. Therefore, the initial cross-bridge formation (attachment of myosin to actin) cannot occur.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is directly inhibited because myosin cannot bind to actin without overlap; the required steric interaction is absent.\n- B requires a pre-formed cross-bridge; it is secondarily prevented but not the primary event inhibited.\n- C (ATP binding to myosin and detachment) occurs only if myosin is attached; without attachment, this specific detachment event is moot, but ATP can still bind to free myosin.\n- D (ATP hydrolysis and re-cocking) is intrinsic to myosin and proceeds independently of actin, so it is not inhibited by lack of overlap.\n- E ($Ca^{2+}$ release and binding to troponin) is independent of filament overlap and remains unaffected under the stated conditions.\n\nThus, the essential event primarily and directly inhibited by the lack of filament overlap is the initial binding of myosin to actin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1702108"}, {"introduction": "The molecule Adenosine Triphosphate ($ATP$) is often called the \"energy currency\" of the cell, but in muscle contraction, its role is more nuanced than just providing energy. This practice [@problem_id:1702077] uses a thought experiment involving a non-hydrolyzable $ATP$ analogue to dissect its two distinct functions. This challenge will deepen your understanding of how $ATP$ binding causes myosin detachment, while its subsequent hydrolysis provides the energy for the \"re-cocking\" of the myosin head.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a research team is investigating the molecular mechanics of muscle contraction. They are using an isolated skeletal muscle fiber that has been chemically permeabilized, allowing direct access to the contractile machinery. The fiber is placed in a solution containing a high concentration of calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$) to ensure the troponin-tropomyosin complex has exposed the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments. The fiber is actively contracting.\n\nThe researchers then introduce a high concentration of Adenosine-5'-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (AMP-PNP), a synthetic analogue of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). AMP-PNP is structurally similar to ATP and can bind to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head, but the bond between its second and third phosphate groups is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis.\n\nAssuming the muscle fiber was in a state of active contraction, with cross-bridges cycling normally just before the introduction of AMP-PNP, what is the fate of the myosin heads? Specifically, identify the last step of the cross-bridge cycle that is successfully completed and the first subsequent step that is blocked by the presence of AMP-PNP.\n\nA. Last completed step: The power stroke, where the myosin head pivots and pulls the actin filament. Blocked step: The dissociation of the myosin head from the actin filament.\nB.

Last completed step: The release of ADP from the myosin head.

Using $A$ for actin and $M$ for myosin, the key strong-binding and nucleotide states are:\n\nAfter a power stroke, the complex is typically in a strongly bound state that still may carry ADP, followed by ADP release:\n$$\nA \\cdot M \\cdot ADP \\xrightarrow{\\text{ADP release}} A \\cdot M.\n$$\nBinding of ATP to myosin reduces actin affinity and causes dissociation:\n$$\nA \\cdot M + ATP \\to A + M \\cdot ATP.\n$$\nMyosin then hydrolyzes ATP and re-cocks to a high-energy conformation:\n$$\nM \\cdot ATP \\xrightarrow{\\text{hydrolysis}} M^{*} \\cdot ADP \\cdot P_i,\n$$\nwhere $M^{*}$ denotes the cocked, high-energy conformation.

This exercise [@problem_id:1702070] focuses on the precise molecular trigger for this event by introducing a hypothetical toxin that locks the cross-bridge in a state just prior to force generation. By analyzing this scenario, you will learn to appreciate the crucial role of inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) release in initiating the power stroke and transitioning the myosin head into a strong, force-producing state.", "problem": "Researchers have isolated a novel paralytic peptide, which they have named \"Rigiloxin,\" from the venom of a deep-sea cone snail. When applied to isolated skeletal muscle fibers, Rigiloxin causes an immediate cessation of force generation. Subsequent biochemical analysis reveals its precise molecular mechanism: Rigiloxin allows the energized myosin head, which has already hydrolyzed Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), to bind to actin. However, the peptide then conformationally locks the myosin head in this state, specifically preventing the release of the inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) molecule from its binding site.\n\nBased on this mechanism, which of the following options most accurately describes the immediate state of the contractile proteins within the sarcomeres of a muscle fiber exposed to Rigiloxin?\n\nA. A state similar to rigor mortis, where myosin heads are tightly bound to actin in a low-energy conformation due to the absence of bound ATP.\nB. A state of complete flaccidity, where myosin heads are unable to form cross-bridges with the actin filaments.\nC. A state of arrested tension, where myosin heads are attached to actin filaments in a high-energy, \"cocked\" conformation but are unable to perform the power stroke.\nD. A state of maximal, continuous contraction (fused tetanus), as the cross-bridge cycle is locked in its force-generating phase.\nE. A state of where the release of ADP is the primary inhibited step, causing myosin to remain attached to actin after the power stroke has been completed.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the canonical cross-bridge cycle in skeletal muscle:\n1) In the presence of $ATP$, myosin detaches from actin as the myosin head binds $ATP$.\n2) Hydrolysis of $ATP$ to $ADP + P_{i}$ cocks the myosin head into a high-energy conformation; the myosin head is now $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$.\n3) The $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$ head can bind to actin; initially this is a weak-binding state.\n4) Release of $P_{i}$ is the key, rate-limiting transition that converts the actomyosin interaction to a strong-binding state and triggers the power stroke, generating force.\n5) After the power stroke, $ADP$ is released; in the absence of $ATP$, the myosin remains tightly bound to actin (rigor). Binding of new $ATP$ causes detachment and restarts the cycle.\n\nNow apply the mechanism of Rigiloxin: it allows the energized myosin head that has already hydrolyzed $ATP$ to $ADP + P_{i}$ to bind to actin, but specifically prevents the release of $P_{i}$. Therefore, the cross-bridge is trapped in the $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$ state while attached to actin. Because $P_{i}$ release is the trigger for the strong-binding transition and the power stroke, blocking $P_{i}$ release prevents the power stroke and force generation. Thus, the myosin heads remain in a high-energy, cocked conformation, attached to actin but unable to proceed to the force-generating step.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because rigor mortis requires absence of bound $ATP$ and reflects a low-energy, tightly bound actomyosin state after $ADP$ release; here $ATP$ has been hydrolyzed and $P_{i}$ remains bound, and the heads are in a high-energy state.\n- B is incorrect because the mechanism explicitly allows myosin to bind to actin; cross-bridges do form.\n- C is correct: myosin heads are attached to actin in a high-energy, cocked state ($M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$) but cannot perform the power stroke due to inhibited $P_{i}$ release, arresting force generation.\n- D is incorrect because locking in the force-generating phase would require progression through $P_{i}$ release and the power stroke; Rigiloxin prevents that.\n- E is incorrect because the inhibited step is $P_{i}$ release, not $ADP$ release; the latter occurs after the power stroke.\n\nTherefore, the immediate state is arrested in the pre–power stroke, high-energy, actin-attached conformation, consistent with option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1702070"}]}
