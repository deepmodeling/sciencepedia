The drug inhibits the basolateral $Na^{+}-K^{+}$-ATPase exclusively in principal cells of the late distal convoluted tubule/connecting tubule and collecting duct. Other nephron segments (proximal tubule, thick ascending limb, early distal convoluted tubule) and intercalated cells are unaffected directly.\n\nState the normal role of the $Na^{+}-K^{+}$-ATPase in principal cells. The pump extrudes intracellular $Na^{+}$ and brings $K^{+}$ into the cell, maintaining low intracellular $Na^{+}$ and high intracellular $K^{+}$. This:\n- Provides the electrochemical gradient for apical ENaC-mediated $Na^{+}$ reabsorption, so principal cell $Na^{+}$ reabsorption depends on pump activity.\n- Supplies intracellular $K^{+}$ and, together with electrogenic $Na^{+}$ uptake, generates a lumen-negative transepithelial potential that favors apical $K^{+}$ secretion via ROMK/BK channels.\n- The lumen-negative potential also augments electrogenic $H^{+}$ secretion by neighboring \\alpha-intercalated cells (via apical $H^{+}$-ATPase and $H^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase), thereby acidifying the urine.\n\nPredict the consequences of inhibiting the pump in principal cells.\n1) $Na^{+}$ handling: With pump inhibition, the intracellular $Na^{+}$ gradient collapses, reducing the driving force for ENaC, so principal cell $Na^{+}$ reabsorption falls. Because earlier segments are unchanged, less $Na^{+}$ is reclaimed distally and more $Na^{+}$ appears in the final urine. Therefore, urine $Na^{+}$ concentration increases.\n2) $K^{+}$ handling: Pump inhibition lowers intracellular $K^{+}$ availability and reduces the lumen-negative potential created by electrogenic $Na^{+}$ reabsorption. Both effects diminish the electrochemical driving force for $K^{+}$ secretion through apical $K^{+}$ channels. Therefore, urine $K^{+}$ concentration decreases.\n3) Acid-base handling (urine pH): The decrease in ENaC-mediated $Na^{+}$ reabsorption reduces the lumen-negative transepithelial potential, which normally promotes electrogenic $H^{+}$ secretion by \\alpha-intercalated cells. With a smaller driving force for $H^{+}$ secretion, less acid is excreted into the lumen, so the urine becomes less acidic. Therefore, urine pH increases.\n\nSynthesize the predicted changes. The final urine will have increased $Na^{+}$, decreased $K^{+}$, and increased pH relative to the pre-drug state.
