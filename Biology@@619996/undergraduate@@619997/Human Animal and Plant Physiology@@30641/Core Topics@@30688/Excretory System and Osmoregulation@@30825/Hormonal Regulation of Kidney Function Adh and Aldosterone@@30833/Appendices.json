Both begin the experiment in a state of normal hydration and electrolyte balance, with a plasma osmolarity of 290 mOsm/L. At the start of the experiment, Subject A consumes 1.0 liter of pure, deionized water. Simultaneously, Subject B consumes 1.0 liter of an isotonic saline solution, which has an osmolarity of 290 mOsm/L.

Both subjects will experience a significant decrease in aldosterone secretion as the primary response to volume expansion, leading to increased excretion of sodium.\n\nE. Subject A will experience an increase in Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) secretion to prevent water loss. Subject B's hormonal profile will remain unchanged because the ingested fluid was isotonic.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the primary hormonal and renal responses in two individuals after ingesting either pure water or an isotonic saline solution. We must analyze the physiological effects of each fluid on plasma osmolarity and blood volume, and then deduce the corresponding hormonal regulation by Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS).\n\n**Analysis of Subject A (Ingested 1.0 L of Pure Water)**\n\n1.  **Fluid Absorption and its Effects:** When Subject A drinks 1.0 L of pure water, it is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. Since water has zero osmolarity, its absorption dilutes the blood.\n2.  **Change in Plasma Parameters:**\n    *   **Plasma Osmolarity:** The primary effect is a significant decrease in plasma osmolarity below the normal value of 290 mOsm/L.\n    *   **Blood Volume:** The addition of 1.0 L of fluid increases the total blood volume.\n3.  **Hormonal Response:** The body's primary mechanism for regulating water balance is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which are extremely sensitive to changes in plasma osmolarity.\n    *   The decrease in plasma osmolarity is detected by these osmoreceptors.\n    *   This detection leads to a strong inhibition of the release of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, from the posterior pituitary gland.\n    *   While the increased blood volume is also detected by baroreceptors, which can also inhibit ADH release, the change in osmolarity is the dominant stimulus in this scenario. Aldosterone secretion is primarily regulated by angiotensin II and plasma potassium levels, neither of which is directly and significantly altered by drinking pure water, so aldosterone levels will not be the primary response.\n4.  **Renal Response:** ADH acts on the collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase their permeability to water by inserting aquaporin channels.\n    *   The significant decrease in circulating ADH levels causes the collecting ducts to become less permeable to water.\n    *   As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the bloodstream.\n    *   This leads to the production and excretion of a large volume of dilute urine (low osmolarity). This process is called diuresis. The goal is to excrete the excess free water to restore plasma osmolarity to its normal set point.\n\n**Analysis of Subject B (Ingested 1.0 L of Isotonic Saline)**\n\n1.  **Fluid Absorption and its Effects:** Subject B drinks 1.0 L of isotonic saline (290 mOsm/L). This fluid has the same osmolarity as the body's fluids. When absorbed, it enters the extracellular fluid compartment, including the plasma.\n2.  **Change in Plasma Parameters:**\n    *   **Plasma Osmolarity:** Because the ingested fluid is isotonic, there will be no significant change in the plasma osmolarity. It will remain at or very near 290 mOsm/L.\n    *   **Blood Volume:** The primary effect is a significant increase in the volume of the extracellular fluid, including the blood volume.\n3.  **Hormonal Response:**\n    *   Since plasma osmolarity does not change, the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are not stimulated. Therefore, there is no significant change in ADH secretion via this primary pathway.\n    *   The main disturbance is the increase in blood volume (volume expansion). This increase in volume (and the associated increase in blood pressure) is detected by stretch receptors (baroreceptors) in the walls of the large veins, atria of the heart, and aortic arch/carotid sinus.\n    *   The increased stretch has two main consequences:\n        *   It inhibits the release of renin from the kidneys. This downregulates the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Less renin leads to less angiotensin II, which in turn leads to decreased secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex.\n        *   It stimulates the release of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) from the atrial walls. ANP promotes the excretion of sodium (natriuresis) and water, and also inhibits the release of renin, aldosterone, and ADH.\n    *   The primary hormonal response to isotonic volume expansion is therefore a decrease in aldosterone secretion (and an increase in ANP).\n4.  **Renal Response:** Aldosterone's main function is to increase the reabsorption of sodium (and consequently water) in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct.\n    *   The decrease in aldosterone levels reduces sodium reabsorption.\n    *   With less sodium being reabsorbed, more sodium remains in the tubular fluid, which osmotically holds water with it.\n    *   This leads to the excretion of an increased volume of urine that is approximately isotonic, effectively excreting the excess salt and water to return the blood volume to normal.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **Subject A (water):** Primary response is decreased ADH due to decreased osmolarity, leading to excretion of dilute urine.\n*   **Subject B (saline):** Primary response is decreased aldosterone due to increased volume, leading to excretion of isotonic urine.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A: This option incorrectly swaps the responses of Subject A and Subject B.\n*   B: This option is incorrect because for Subject B, the change in ADH is not the primary response; the lack of osmolarity change is key. Also, the urine excreted by Subject B would be isotonic, not dilute.\n*   C: This option correctly identifies that Subject A's response is a decrease in ADH leading to dilute urine excretion. It also correctly identifies that Subject B's primary response is a decrease in aldosterone to excrete sodium and water, with minimal change in ADH. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n*   D: This option incorrectly claims that a decrease in aldosterone is the primary response for both subjects. This is untrue for Subject A, whose primary stimulus is osmolarity change affecting ADH.\n*   E: This option is incorrect. Ingesting water (Subject A) decreases ADH, it does not increase it. For Subject B, while the fluid is isotonic, the volume expansion triggers a significant hormonal response.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1712123"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the whole-organism level to the cellular machinery, this problem [@problem_id:1712095] explores the mechanism of ADH action. Hormones like ADH work by triggering intracellular signaling cascades, and this exercise models the role of the second messenger cyclic AMP ($cAMP$).

Under these initial conditions, the cells reach a steady state with a specific level of water permeability, denoted as $P_{w, initial}$.\n\nThe intracellular dynamics of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), the second messenger for ADH, are modeled by the following principles:\n1.  The rate of cAMP synthesis, $R_{\\text{prod}}$, is constant due to the fixed ADH concentration.\n2.  The rate of cAMP degradation is a first-order process, proportional to the cAMP concentration, with a rate constant $k_{deg}$.

This drug reduces the activity of the PDE enzyme, causing the degradation rate constant $k_{deg}$ to decrease to 2.5% of its original value.

This particular candy is rich in glycyrrhetinic acid. For the purposes of this problem, you are to assume that glycyrrhetinic acid acts as a potent agonist for mineralocorticoid receptors in the principal cells of the kidney's collecting ducts, perfectly mimicking the physiological actions of aldosterone. After a period sufficient for systemic equilibrium to be approached, which of the following sets of physiological changes would be the most accurate prediction for this student, assuming they are otherwise healthy and have free access to water?\n\nA. Low renin secretion, low endogenous aldosterone secretion, and hypokalemia (low plasma potassium concentration).\nB.

No significant change in renin or aldosterone secretion, but pronounced hyponatremia (low plasma sodium concentration).", "solution": "By assumption, glycyrrhetinic acid here is a potent agonist at mineralocorticoid receptors in principal cells and perfectly mimics aldosterone. In principal cells, aldosterone increases expression and activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) on the apical membrane and the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase on the basolateral membrane. The net effect is increased $Na^{+}$ reabsorption from the tubular lumen into the interstitium and increased $K^{+}$ uptake into cells with enhanced secretion into the lumen via ROMK (and, when applicable, BK) channels. Therefore, sustained mineralocorticoid receptor activation causes net $Na^{+}$ retention and increased $K^{+}$ excretion, which lowers plasma $K^{+}$ concentration (hypokalemia).\n\nThe increased $Na^{+}$ reabsorption expands extracellular fluid volume and raises effective arterial blood volume. Elevated effective arterial blood volume reduces renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells via several mechanisms: increased afferent arteriolar wall tension (intrarenal baroreceptor mechanism), increased $NaCl$ delivery to the macula densa (which suppresses renin), and reduced renal sympathetic nerve activity (lower $\\beta_{1}$ stimulation). Thus, renin secretion decreases.\n\nA decrease in renin lowers angiotensin II formation. Zona glomerulosa aldosterone secretion depends positively on angiotensin II and on plasma $K^{+}$. Because angiotensin II is reduced and plasma $K^{+}$ is lowered by enhanced $K^{+}$ secretion, endogenous aldosterone secretion is suppressed. Therefore, under exogenous mineralocorticoid receptor activation, the expected steady-state pattern is low renin, low endogenous aldosterone, and hypokalemia.\n\nHyponatremia is not expected; aldosterone-driven $Na^{+}$ retention tends to increase extracellular volume with water following osmotically, and with free access to water and intact osmoregulation, plasma $Na^{+}$ concentration typically does not become markedly low. Hence the option stating pronounced hyponatremia without renin-aldosterone changes is inaccurate.\n\nThe set that matches these predictions is: low renin secretion, low endogenous aldosterone secretion, and hypokalemia.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1712113"}]}
