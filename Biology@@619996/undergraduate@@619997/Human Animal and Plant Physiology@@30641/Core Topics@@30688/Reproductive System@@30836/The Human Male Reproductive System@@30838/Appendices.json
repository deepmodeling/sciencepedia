To truly grasp how this system functions, it is instructive to consider what happens when its regulation is disrupted. This problem explores a hypothetical genetic condition that causes a key receptor to be permanently active, providing a powerful case study for understanding the critical role of negative feedback in maintaining hormonal homeostasis [@problem_id:1750591].", "problem": "In the male endocrine system, the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis regulates reproductive function. The hypothalamus secretes Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release Luteinizing hormone (LH). LH, in turn, acts on the Leydig cells of the testes to stimulate the production and secretion of testosterone. Testosterone then exerts negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, inhibiting the release of GnRH and LH, respectively, thereby maintaining hormonal balance.\n\nConsider a prepubertal boy diagnosed with Familial Male-Limited Precocious Puberty. This condition is caused by a specific genetic mutation that results in a constitutively active LH receptor. A constitutively active receptor is one that signals continuously, as if it were constantly bound by its ligand (LH), even when the ligand is not present.\n\nCompared to a healthy, age-matched prepubertal boy, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected circulating levels of GnRH, LH, and testosterone in the boy with this condition?\n\nA.

Testosterone exerts negative feedback on both hypothalamus and pituitary. Symbolically, let $S_{LH\\text{-}R}$ denote LH receptor signaling in Leydig cells and let $T = f(S_{LH\\text{-}R})$ with $\\frac{dT}{dS_{LH\\text{-}R}} > 0$. Let hypothalamic and pituitary outputs be $G(T)$ and $L(T)$ with $\\frac{dG}{dT} < 0$ and $\\frac{dL}{dT} < 0$ representing negative feedback.\n- In a healthy prepubertal boy, baseline $\\text{GnRH}$ pulsatility and $\\text{LH}$ are low, and $T$ is low.\n- In Familial Male-Limited Precocious Puberty, the LH receptor is constitutively active. This implies $S_{LH\\text{-}R} = S_{0} > 0$ even when $\\text{LH}$ is low, i.e., receptor signaling is ligand independent. Therefore, testosterone production increases: $T = f(S_{0})$ is elevated relative to an age-matched control, so $T$ is high.\n- Elevated $T$ applies stronger negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary, so both $\\text{GnRH}$ and $\\text{LH}$ secretion decrease: $G(T)$ and $L(T)$ are reduced when $T$ is high. Hence $\\text{GnRH}$ is low and $\\text{LH}$ is low despite high testicular androgen output driven by receptor signaling.\n- Mapping to choices:\n  - A (high, high, high): incorrect; negative feedback from high $T$ lowers $\\text{GnRH}$ and $\\text{LH}$.\n  - B (low, high, low): incorrect; constitutive receptor raises $T$ and negative feedback lowers $\\text{LH}$.\n  - C (low, low, high): correct; gonadotropin-independent testosterone excess suppresses both upstream hormones.\n  - D (high, low, high): incorrect; high $T$ suppresses $\\text{GnRH}$, not raises it.\n  - E (low, low, low): incorrect; $T$ is high due to receptor activation.\n  - F (high, high, low): incorrect; contradicts both receptor activation and feedback.\nTherefore, the expected pattern is $\\text{GnRH}$ low, $\\text{LH}$ low, and testosterone high.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1750591"}, {"introduction": "Beyond hormonal control, the male reproductive system relies on the coordinated function of several accessory glands that produce the components of seminal fluid. Each gland makes a unique and essential contribution to the final composition of the ejaculate, which is vital for sperm viability and transport. This exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of anatomy and physiology by predicting the physical and chemical properties of semen in a scenario where the seminal vesicles, a major contributor, are congenitally absent [@problem_id:1750578].", "problem": "In a typical human male ejaculate, the seminal fluid is a composite mixture from several glands. The seminal vesicles contribute approximately 65-75% of the total volume, providing a viscous, alkaline fluid rich in fructose and prostaglandins. The prostate gland contributes about 20-30% of the volume with a milky, slightly acidic fluid containing citrate and various enzymes like prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The bulbourethral glands contribute less than 5% as a clear, lubricating mucus. The testes contribute spermatozoa, which constitute less than 5% of the total volume.

The seminal vesicles contribute approximately 0.65 to 0.75 of the total volume and supply a viscous, alkaline fluid rich in fructose and prostaglandins. The prostate provides about 0.20 to 0.30 of the volume with a milky, slightly acidic fluid containing citrate and enzymes such as PSA. The bulbourethral glands contribute less than 0.05 of the volume as a clear, lubricating, mildly alkaline mucus. The testes contribute spermatozoa, constituting less than 0.05 of the volume. The overall semen pH is normally alkaline, typically in the range 7.2 to 8.0, largely due to the alkaline seminal vesicle secretion.\n\nIn congenital bilateral absence of the seminal vesicles, the entire seminal vesicle contribution is missing. The direct consequences are:\n- Volume: Loss of 0.65 to 0.75 of the ejaculate volume leads to a severely reduced total volume, since only the prostatic fluid (about 0.20 to 0.30), bulbourethral mucus (less than 0.05), and spermatozoa (less than 0.05) remain.\n- pH: The seminal vesicles normally provide the dominant alkaline component. Without this, the remaining major contributor is prostatic secretion, which is slightly acidic. Although bulbourethral mucus is mildly alkaline, its volume is small, so the net pH will tend toward acidic relative to normal semen.\n- Fructose: Fructose is supplied by the seminal vesicles; thus, in their absence, fructose is absent from the ejaculate.\n- Citrate: Citrate is provided by the prostate and remains present.\n- Spermatozoa: Testes and epididymides are normal, so sperm are present.\n- Lubricating mucus: Bulbourethral glands are normal, so mucus is present.\n\nMatching these findings to the options:\n- Normal volume or absence of spermatozoa is incorrect.\n- Highly alkaline pH or absent citrate is incorrect.\n- Normal fructose levels despite absent seminal vesicles is incorrect.\n- Absence of lubricating mucus is incorrect.\n\nThe correct description is severely reduced volume, acidic pH, and absent fructose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1750578"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate function of a spermatozoon is to reach and fertilize an oocyte, a feat of cellular motility that is energetically demanding.
