This first practice problem serves as a fundamental check on your understanding of the first meiotic division, which is a reductional division. By carefully tracking the number of chromosomes and their component sister chromatids, you will solidify the core principle of how a diploid cell gives rise to haploid cells, a cornerstone of sexual reproduction [@problem_id:1708251].", "problem": "In a particular species of mammal, somatic cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are diploid and contain 24 chromosomes ($2n = 24$). A researcher is studying spermatogenesis in a male from this species. A single primary spermatocyte, after completing the S phase of interphase, enters meiosis. This cell then undergoes the first meiotic division (meiosis I) to produce two secondary spermatocytes.

A primary spermatocyte arises as a diploid cell and, after completing S phase, each chromosome has replicated into two sister chromatids while the chromosome number remains unchanged. Therefore, immediately after S phase, the primary spermatocyte has $2n=24$ chromosomes and $2$ chromatids per chromosome, for a total of $2 \\times 24 = 48$ chromatids.\n\nMeiosis I separates homologous chromosomes (reductional division) but does not separate sister chromatids. Thus, at the completion of meiosis I, each secondary spermatocyte is haploid in terms of chromosome number, containing $n=12$ chromosomes, with each chromosome still consisting of two sister chromatids. Therefore, each secondary spermatocyte has $12$ chromosomes and $2 \\times 12 = 24$ chromatids.\n\nHence, the correct choice is $12$ chromosomes and $24$ chromatids, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1708251"}, {"introduction": "While we often study meiosis as a flawless process, errors can occur, with significant consequences for the genetic makeup of gametes.

Analyzing the unique pairing and subsequent segregation patterns of these rearranged chromosomes will allow you to apply your meiotic knowledge to predict the probability of producing genetically balanced versus unbalanced gametes, a critical skill in genetic counseling and risk assessment.", "problem": "A clinical geneticist is analyzing the meiotic products of a male patient known to be a carrier of a balanced reciprocal translocation. The patient's karyotype is 46,XY,t(3;11)(p21;q13), meaning there has been an exchange of segments between the short arm (p) of chromosome 3 at band 21 and the long arm (q) of chromosome 11 at band 13. Let us denote the normal chromosomes as `N3` and `N11`, and the derivative (translocated) chromosomes as `T3` (the majority of chromosome 3 with a piece of chromosome 11) and `T11` (the majority of chromosome 11 with a piece of chromosome 3).\n\nDuring prophase I of meiosis, these four chromosomes—`N3`, `N11`, `T3`, and `T11`—form a characteristic cross-shaped quadrivalent structure to allow for homologous pairing. The segregation of these chromosomes at the end of anaphase I can occur in several ways. Based on empirical data for this specific translocation, the probabilities of the three possible segregation patterns are as follows:\n\n1.  **Alternate Segregation**: Homologous centromeres move to opposite poles. The resulting gametes will contain either `{N3, N11}` or `{T3, T11}`. This mode occurs with a total probability of $P_{\\text{alt}} = 0.40$.\n2.  **Adjacent-1 Segregation**: Non-homologous centromeres move to opposite poles. The resulting gametes will contain either `{N3, T11}` or `{T3, N11}`. This mode occurs with a total probability of $P_{\\text{adj1}} = 0.50$.\n3.  **Adjacent-2 Segregation**: Homologous centromeres move to the same pole. The resulting gametes will contain either `{N3, T3}` or `{N11, T11}`. This mode occurs with a total probability of $P_{\\text{adj2}} = 0.10$.\n\nAssume that for each of the three segregation modes, the two possible types of resulting gametes are produced in equal proportions. A gamete is considered \"genetically unbalanced\" if it does not contain exactly one complete copy of the genetic material from both chromosome 3 and chromosome 11.\n\nWhat is the total theoretical proportion of gametes produced by this individual that will be genetically unbalanced?\n\nA. 0.20\n\nB. 0.40\n\nC. 0.50\n\nD. 0.60\n\nE. 0.80", "solution": "Define the three mutually exclusive segregation events at anaphase I with given probabilities: alternate with probability $P_{\\text{alt}}=0.40$, adjacent-1 with probability $P_{\\text{adj1}}=0.50$, and adjacent-2 with probability $P_{\\text{adj2}}=0.10$.\n\nBalanced gamete criterion: a gamete is balanced if and only if it contains exactly one complete copy of the genetic material of chromosome 3 and exactly one complete copy of the genetic material of chromosome 11.\n\nAnalyze balance by segregation mode:\n- Alternate segregation yields gametes $\\{N3,N11\\}$ and $\\{T3,T11\\}$. Each contains a complete single dose of chromosome 3 material and a complete single dose of chromosome 11 material; thus both are balanced.
