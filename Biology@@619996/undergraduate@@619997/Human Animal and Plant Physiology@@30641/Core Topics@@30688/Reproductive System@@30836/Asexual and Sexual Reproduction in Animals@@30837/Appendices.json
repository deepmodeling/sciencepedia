These fish practice a rare form of asexual reproduction called gynogenesis. They coexist in their natural habitat with males of a closely related species, the Sailfin Molly (*Poecilia latipinna*). To reproduce, a female Amazon Molly must mate with a Sailfin Molly male, but the process is unusual. The sperm from the male only serves to trigger the activation and subsequent development of the egg; the sperm's nucleus never fuses with the egg's nucleus, and thus no paternal genetic material is contributed to the offspring.\n\nKaryotype analysis reveals the following:\n- A typical somatic (non-reproductive) cell of an Amazon Molly is diploid and contains 92 chromosomes. During its specialized form of oogenesis, it produces a diploid ovum (egg cell).\n- A typical somatic cell of a Sailfin Molly is also diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Males of this species produce normal, haploid sperm via standard meiosis.\n\nAssuming a successful gynogenetic event occurs between a female Amazon Molly and a male Sailfin Molly, what is the total number of chromosomes that would be found in a somatic cell of the resulting offspring?\n\nSelect the correct option.\nA. 46\n\nB. 69\n\nC. 92\n\nD. 115\n\nE. 138", "solution": "Define the diploid chromosome numbers:\n- Amazon Molly somatic cells: $2n_{A} = 92$.

This exercise delves into the haplodiploid system of honey bees, where diploid females develop from fertilized eggs and haploid males from unfertilized ones.

Diploid females (queens and workers) develop from fertilized eggs, whereas haploid males (drones) develop from unfertilized eggs through a process called parthenogenesis.\n\nConsider a single diploid queen who is heterozygous for a certain gene influencing abdominal striping pattern, carrying the genotype $B_1B_2$. The allele $B_1$ is dominant over the allele $B_2$. This queen performs her nuptial flight and mates with two distinct haploid drones. The first drone carries the allele $B_1$, and the second drone carries the allele $B_2$.\n\nThe queen stores the sperm from both matings in her spermatheca. Based on physiological and competitive factors, the sperm from the first drone ($B_1$) is used for 60% of fertilizations, while the sperm from the second drone ($B_2$) is used for the remaining 40% of fertilizations. The queen lays a large number of eggs, some of which are fertilized and some of which remain unfertilized.\n\nCalculate the expected proportions of all possible genotypes among the queen's female offspring and male offspring. Present your answer as a row matrix of five exact fractional values, in the following order: the proportion of female offspring with genotype $B_1B_1$, the proportion of females with genotype $B_1B_2$, the proportion of females with genotype $B_2B_2$, the proportion of male offspring with genotype $B_1$, and the proportion of male offspring with genotype $B_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected genotypic proportions for both male and female offspring of a honey bee queen. We will analyze the two sexes separately due to the haplodiploid reproductive system.\n\nFirst, let's determine the genotypes of the male offspring. Males (drones) are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs. Therefore, their genotype is determined solely by the allele present in the egg from which they develop. The queen has a genotype of $B_1B_2$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, during meiosis, she will produce eggs carrying the $B_1$ allele and eggs carrying the $B_2$ allele in equal proportions.\n\nLet $P(\\text{egg}=B_1)$ be the probability that an egg carries the $B_1$ allele, and $P(\\text{egg}=B_2)$ be the probability that it carries the $B_2$ allele.\n$$P(\\text{egg}=B_1) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(\\text{egg}=B_2) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSince drones develop from these eggs without fertilization, the proportions of drone genotypes will directly reflect these egg proportions.\nThe proportion of male offspring with genotype $B_1$ is:\n$$P(\\text{male}=B_1) = P(\\text{egg}=B_1) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe proportion of male offspring with genotype $B_2$ is:\n$$P(\\text{male}=B_2) = P(\\text{egg}=B_2) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, let's determine the genotypes of the female offspring. Females are diploid and develop from fertilized eggs. They receive one allele from the queen's egg and one from a drone's sperm.\nThe probabilities for the alleles from the queen's eggs are as determined above: $P(\\text{egg}=B_1) = 1/2$ and $P(\\text{egg}=B_2) = 1/2$.\n\nThe problem states that the sperm used for fertilization comes from two drones. Let's define the proportions of sperm alleles in the effective sperm pool used by the queen.\nSperm from Drone 1 (genotype $B_1$) is used in 60% of fertilizations.\nSperm from Drone 2 (genotype $B_2$) is used in 40% of fertilizations.\nSo, the probability that a random fertilizing sperm carries the $B_1$ allele is $P(\\text{sperm}=B_1) = 0.60 = \\frac{3}{5}$.\nThe probability that a random fertilizing sperm carries the $B_2$ allele is $P(\\text{sperm}=B_2) = 0.40 = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities of the three possible diploid female genotypes ($B_1B_1$, $B_1B_2$, $B_2B_2$) by combining the probabilities of the egg and sperm alleles.\n\n1.  **Proportion of female offspring with genotype $B_1B_1$**: This requires a $B_1$ egg and a $B_1$ sperm.\n    $$P(\\text{female}=B_1B_1) = P(\\text{egg}=B_1) \\times P(\\text{sperm}=B_1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{3}{10}$$\n\n2.  **Proportion of female offspring with genotype $B_2B_2$**: This requires a $B_2$ egg and a $B_2$ sperm.\n    $$P(\\text{female}=B_2B_2) = P(\\text{egg}=B_2) \\times P(\\text{sperm}=B_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\n3.  **Proportion of female offspring with genotype $B_1B_2$**: This can occur in two ways:\n    a) A $B_1$ egg fertilized by a $B_2$ sperm.\n    b) A $B_2$ egg fertilized by a $B_1$ sperm.\n    We sum the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n    $$P(\\text{female}=B_1B_2) = [P(\\text{egg}=B_1) \\times P(\\text{sperm}=B_2)] + [P(\\text{egg}=B_2) \\times P(\\text{sperm}=B_1)]$$\n    $$P(\\text{female}=B_1B_2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nAs a check, the sum of the female genotype proportions should be 1:\n$$P(B_1B_1) + P(B_1B_2) + P(B_2B_2) = \\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1$$\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\nThe final results are:\n-   Proportion of female $B_1B_1$: $\\frac{3}{10}$\n-   Proportion of female $B_1B_2$: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Proportion of female $B_2B_2$: $\\frac{1}{5}$\n-   Proportion of male $B_1$: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Proportion of male $B_2$: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe problem asks for these five values in a specific order within a row matrix.\nOrder: ($P(B_1B_1)$, $P(B_1B_2)$, $P(B_2B_2)$, $P(\\text{male } B_1)$, $P(\\text{male } B_2)$)\nThe corresponding values are: ($\\frac{3}{10}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{5}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$)", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{10} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "1693195"}, {"introduction": "In many animals, successful sexual reproduction is orchestrated by a complex and precise interplay of hormones. This problem challenges you to analyze the hormonal control of male fertility through a hypothetical scenario involving a drug that specifically targets Follicle-Stimulating Hormone ($FSH$) receptors.

The drug is designed to be a highly specific competitive antagonist that binds to the receptors for Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) on the surface of Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules of the testes, preventing the endogenous FSH from binding and activating these cells. Assuming the drug has no other off-target effects and does not cross the blood-brain barrier to affect the pituitary gland or hypothalamus directly, what is the most direct and primary consequence on the process of spermatogenesis in a healthy adult male primate administered this drug?\n\nA.

An overstimulation of the accessory reproductive glands (e.g., seminal vesicles, prostate), leading to increased semen volume.\n\nE. A rapid increase in the secretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary due to a positive feedback mechanism.", "solution": "The physiological control of male reproduction proceeds via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, in which the anterior pituitary secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH acts on Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules, while LH acts on Leydig cells in the interstitium. Sertoli cells, when stimulated by FSH, support multiple steps of spermatogenesis by producing androgen-binding protein (ABP) to concentrate testosterone within the seminiferous tubules, secreting growth factors that support spermatogonial proliferation and meiosis, and facilitating the maturation of spermatids into spermatozoa (spermiogenesis). Sertoli cells also secrete inhibin B, which exerts negative feedback selectively on FSH secretion at the anterior pituitary. By contrast, LH stimulates Leydig cells to synthesize testosterone, which is essential for spermatogenesis and for the function of accessory reproductive glands.\n\nThe drug described, a competitive antagonist specifically at FSH receptors on Sertoli cells, will prevent endogenous FSH from activating Sertoli cells. Because the agent does not cross the blood-brain barrier and has no off-target effects, it does not directly alter hypothalamic GnRH secretion or pituitary gonadotrophs. The immediate consequences of FSH receptor blockade are therefore localized to Sertoli cell function: decreased ABP synthesis, reduced paracrine support for germ cells, diminished inhibin B secretion, and impaired Sertoli-mediated steps of germ cell maturation. Decreased inhibin B would lessen negative feedback on FSH, tending to raise circulating FSH, but this compensatory increase cannot restore Sertoli cell activation because the receptor is antagonized. Importantly, LH secretion and Leydig cell function remain intact, so systemic testosterone production continues.\n\nConsidering the steps of spermatogenesis, complete arrest of spermatogonial mitosis is not expected because intratesticular testosterone (although less concentrated without ABP) and local paracrine factors can still sustain some early germ cell activity; therefore, a total halt in the initiation of the spermatogenic cycle is not the most direct or primary outcome. Likewise, Leydig cell testosterone production does not cease because LH action is unaffected, so an immediate and complete stop in testosterone synthesis does not occur. Accessory gland overstimulation requires increased androgenic stimulation, which is not produced by FSH receptor blockade. Finally, a rapid increase in LH due to positive feedback is incorrect because inhibin B modulates FSH rather than LH; changes in inhibin primarily affect FSH, and there is no positive feedback mechanism causing LH surges in this context.\n\nThe most direct and primary effect of blocking FSH signaling at Sertoli cells is impairment of the Sertoli-dependent maturation of spermatids into spermatozoa (spermiogenesis), owing to reduced Sertoli support and reduced intratubular androgen concentration secondary to decreased ABP. Thus, the best answer is that spermiogenesis is severely impaired.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1693228"}]}
