The scala media is filled with endolymph, a fluid with an unusually high potassium ion concentration, $[K^+] \\approx 150 \\text{ mM}$, and a large positive electrical potential of approximately $+80 \\text{ mV}$ relative to the surrounding tissue. This is known as the endocochlear potential. The hair cells, responsible for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, sit with their apical stereocilia bathed in this endolymph. The intracellular environment of a hair cell has a potassium concentration of $[K^+] \\approx 140 \\text{ mM}$ and a resting membrane potential of approximately $-45 \\text{ mV}$ relative to the perilymph.

Assume that the intracellular concentrations and resting potential of the hair cell do not have time to change.\n\nGiven this sudden change, what is the immediate consequence for potassium ($K^+$) ion movement through the mechanically-gated transduction channels on the hair cell's stereocilia if they are opened by a sound stimulus?\n\nA.

This practice shifts our focus from the auditory system to the vestibular system to explore how structures called otoconia enable us to sense gravity and linear acceleration. By analyzing a thought experiment where these crucial components are absent, we can isolate their function and understand the elegant physical principle of an inertial mass-based sensor [@problem_id:1744786].", "problem": "The vestibular system in the inner ear is crucial for balance and spatial orientation. It includes the otolithic organs—the utricle and saccule—which are responsible for detecting static equilibrium (the position of the head with respect to gravity) and linear acceleration. These organs contain a gelatinous layer topped with tiny calcium carbonate crystals called otoconia. When the head tilts, gravity pulls on these dense otoconia, which in turn shifts the gelatinous layer and bends the stereocilia of the underlying hair cells. This mechanical stimulation is transduced into neural signals that the brain interprets as head position.\n\nImagine a hypothetical medical condition where a person's otoconia completely dissolve, but all other components of the vestibular system, including the hair cells and their associated nerves, remain perfectly functional.

These structures detect static head position relative to gravity and linear acceleration via a mass-loaded gelatinous layer (the otolithic membrane) that shears relative to the hair cell bundles when subjected to gravitational or inertial forces. The otoconia provide the dominant effective mass that allows gravity and linear acceleration to produce sufficient force to bend the stereocilia and modulate hair-cell transduction.\n\nWe model the mechano-electrical transduction by a simple mass-spring relation.

This practice uses a quantitative model of the basilar membrane to explain a key psychoacoustic phenomenon: the asymmetric nature of auditory masking. By calculating the interaction between two tones, you will uncover how the physical shape of the traveling wave along the membrane directly shapes our perception of sound [@problem_id:1744791].", "problem": "In the field of psychoacoustics, an interesting phenomenon known as auditory masking describes how the perception of one sound (the signal) is affected by the presence of another sound (the masker). A key observation is that a low-frequency tone is a more effective masker for a nearby high-frequency tone than the reverse. This asymmetry can be understood by modeling the mechanical response of the basilar membrane in the inner ear.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model of the basilar membrane. The position along the membrane, $x$, is measured in millimeters (mm) from the stapes (the base). The membrane is tonotopically organized, meaning each position $x$ has a characteristic frequency $f_c(x)$ to which it responds most strongly. This relationship is given by:\n$$f_c(x) = f_{base} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_0}\\right)$$\nwhere $f_{base} = 20000 \\text{ Hz}$ is the characteristic frequency at the base, and $L_0 = 5.00 \\text{ mm}$ is a characteristic length.\n\nWhen a pure tone of a certain frequency is introduced, it creates a traveling wave along the basilar membrane, causing displacement. The envelope of this displacement (its maximum amplitude at each point) for a stimulus tone that peaks at position $x_s$ with a maximum amplitude of $A_0$ is modeled by the following asymmetric function of position $x$:\n$$A(x; x_s) = \\begin{cases} A_0 \\exp\\left( -k_{up} (x_s - x) \\right) & \\text{for } x \\le x_s \\\\ A_0 \\exp\\left( -k_{down} (x - x_s) \\right) & \\text{for } x > x_s \\end{cases}$$\nThe parameters $k_{up} = 0.100 \\text{ mm}^{-1}$ and $k_{down} = 0.800 \\text{ mm}^{-1}$ describe the gradual rise of the wave envelope toward the peak and the sharp fall-off after the peak, respectively.\n\nLet's investigate the masking interaction between two tones: a low-frequency tone $f_L = 2000 \\text{ Hz}$ and a high-frequency tone $f_H = 4000 \\text{ Hz}$. Assume both tones, when presented alone, produce the same peak displacement amplitude $A_0$. The masking effectiveness of a masker tone on a signal tone is defined as the displacement amplitude the masker creates at the signal tone's characteristic position on the membrane.
