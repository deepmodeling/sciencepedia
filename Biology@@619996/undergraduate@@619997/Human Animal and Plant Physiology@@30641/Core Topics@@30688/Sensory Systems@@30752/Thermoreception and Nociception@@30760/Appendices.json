The physiological principle is that faster conduction arises from myelination and larger axon diameter. Thinly myelinated A-delta fibers conduct faster than unmyelinated C fibers, producing the early “first pain.” The transducing receptors for a brief, punctate mechanical probe are mechanical (often mechanothermal) nociceptors that are activated by high-threshold mechanical stimuli. Therefore, Stimulus 1 is mediated by mechanical nociceptors carried predominantly by A-delta fibers.\n\nFor Stimulus 2 (slowly developing, dull, burning, poorly localized “second pain”): The temporal delay and diffuse, burning quality indicate the slow-conducting, unmyelinated C fibers. The transducing receptors for a mild chemical irritant are typically polymodal nociceptors, which respond to chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli and predominantly project via C fibers, producing the delayed “second pain.” Although “silent” nociceptors can be recruited after inflammation, the canonical mediator of a mild chemical irritant–evoked dull burn is the polymodal C-fiber nociceptor.\n\nMatching these to the options:\n- Stimulus 1: mechanical nociceptors via A-delta fibers.\n- Stimulus 2: polymodal nociceptors via C fibers.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1753990"}, {"introduction": "Our ability to pinpoint a sensation on our skin varies dramatically across the body. This exercise delves into the concept of sensory acuity by modeling the relationship between the density of thermoreceptors and the two-point discrimination threshold. By applying a simple geometric model, you will quantitatively see how the anatomical arrangement of sensory neurons directly translates into the functional resolution of our perceptual map of the world.

A lower threshold indicates higher sensory acuity.\n\nLet's model the relationship between receptor density and the thermal two-point discrimination threshold. Assume that the receptive fields of thermoreceptors on the skin are circular and tile the surface without any overlap.

This challenging practice explores the famous \"thermal grill illusion,\" a powerful demonstration of this principle where non-painful inputs combine to create a painful sensation. You will use a quantitative model involving synaptic excitation, inhibition, and central disinhibition to understand how the nervous system can generate perceptual experiences that seem paradoxical. [@problem_id:1753969]", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is developing a simplified quantitative model to explain the thermal grill illusion, where an interleaved pattern of non-painful warm and cool stimuli elicits a paradoxical sensation of burning cold. The model focuses on the convergence of two types of primary afferent fibers onto a single second-order neuron in the spinal cord, whose net activity corresponds to the perceived pain.\n\nThe model is defined as follows:\n\n1.  A polymodal C-fiber, which can signal noxious cold, has a firing rate $f_C$ given by the function:\n    $f_C(T) = k_C \\cdot \\max(0, T_{ref} - T)$, where $T$ is the temperature of its receptive field, $T_{ref} = 33.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ is the neutral skin temperature, and $k_C = 2.50 \\text{ impulses}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\\cdot^\\circ\\text{C}^{-1}$ is a response constant.\n\n2.  A non-nociceptive A-delta fiber, which signals innocuous cool temperatures, has a firing rate $f_{A\\delta}$ given by the function:\n    $f_{A\\delta}(T) = k_{A\\delta} \\cdot \\max(0, T_{ref} - T)$, with a response constant $k_{A\\delta} = 8.00 \\text{ impulses}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\\cdot^\\circ\\text{C}^{-1}$.\n\n3.  The C-fiber provides an excitatory input, and the A-delta fiber provides an inhibitory input to the second-order neuron. The net activity of this neuron, $A_{pain}$, which represents the intensity of the pain signal, is given by:\n    $A_{pain} = W_C f_C - W_{A\\delta} f_{A\\delta}$, where $W_C = 0.800$ is the dimensionless excitatory synaptic weight and $W_{A\\delta}$ is the dimensionless inhibitory synaptic weight.\n\nThe thermal grill apparatus uses cool bars at $T_{cool} = 21.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ and warm bars at $T_{warm} = 41.0^\\circ\\text{C}$. Individually, a uniform stimulus at $T_{cool}$ is perceived as cool but not painful. In the model, this implies that the baseline inhibitory weight, $W_{A\\delta,0}$, is precisely tuned such that $A_{pain} = 0$ when the receptive fields of both fibers are stimulated only by the temperature $T_{cool}$.\n\nThe core of the illusion is that the simultaneous stimulation from the adjacent warm bars ($T_{warm}$) causes a central disinhibition, reducing the effectiveness of the A-delta fiber's inhibitory synapse. In this model, this effect is represented as a 35.0% reduction in the inhibitory weight $W_{A\\delta}$.\n\nAssuming a receptive field is stimulated by the cool bar temperature ($T_{cool}$) while simultaneously being subject to this 35.0% disinhibitory effect from the adjacent warm bars, calculate the resulting activity $A_{pain}$ of the second-order neuron.
