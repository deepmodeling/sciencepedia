Understanding how the absence of light can trigger a strong neural signal is crucial for appreciating how the retina encodes not just brightness, but also darkness and contrast. By tracing the cascade of events from a photoreceptor to a ganglion cell, this exercise [@problem_id:1757662] solidifies your grasp of synaptic transmission and the sign-inverting logic that underpins visual processing.", "problem": "In the vertebrate retina, the processing of visual information begins with a network of neurons that includes photoreceptors (rods and cones), bipolar cells, and ganglion cells. The receptive field of a bipolar or ganglion cell is the specific region of the retina that, when stimulated by light, affects the cell's firing rate. These receptive fields often have a center-surround organization. An \"OFF-center\" ganglion cell is characterized by an increased firing rate when the center of its receptive field is dark and a decreased firing rate when the center is illuminated.\n\nConsider a single OFF-center ganglion cell and the direct vertical pathway that innervates it (a photoreceptor in the center of the receptive field synapsing onto an OFF-center bipolar cell, which in turn synapses onto the ganglion cell). Initially, a small spot of light is steadily illuminating only the center of this cell's receptive field. Then, the light is abruptly turned off. In response to the light being turned off, the OFF-center ganglion cell fires a vigorous burst of action potentials.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct causal explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA. When the light is turned off, the central photoreceptor hyperpolarizes, reducing its release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This decrease in glutamate is an excitatory signal for the OFF-center bipolar cell, causing it to depolarize and excite the ganglion cell.\n\nB. When the light is turned off, the central photoreceptor depolarizes, increasing its release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This increase in glutamate is an excitatory signal for the OFF-center bipolar cell, causing it to depolarize and excite the ganglion cell.\n\nC. When the light is turned off, the central photoreceptor depolarizes, increasing its release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This increase in glutamate is an inhibitory signal for the OFF-center bipolar cell, causing it to hyperpolarize, which in turn disinhibits and excites the ganglion cell.\n\nD. When the light is turned off, the central photoreceptor hyperpolarizes, increasing its release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This increase in glutamate is an excitatory signal for the OFF-center bipolar cell, causing it to depolarize and excite the ganglion cell.\n\nE. When the light is turned off, the central photoreceptor depolarizes and releases an excitatory neurotransmitter directly onto the ganglion cell, bypassing the bipolar cell, which causes the ganglion cell to fire action potentials.", "solution": "An OFF-center ganglion cell increases its firing rate when the center of its receptive field becomes dark. The vertical pathway mediating this response consists of a photoreceptor synapsing onto an OFF bipolar cell, which then synapses onto the ganglion cell.\n\nFirst principle: Photoreceptors are depolarized in darkness and hyperpolarized in light. Their transmitter release (glutamate) is graded and increases with depolarization and decreases with hyperpolarization. Therefore, light in the receptive field center causes the central photoreceptor to hyperpolarize and reduce glutamate release; turning the light off depolarizes the photoreceptor and increases glutamate release.\n\nSecond principle: OFF bipolar cells express ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA/kainate) that are sign-preserving; increased glutamate depolarizes OFF bipolar cells (excitation), whereas decreased glutamate hyperpolarizes them (reduced excitation). In contrast, ON bipolar cells express mGluR6 and invert the sign, but ON bipolars are not the pathway here.\n\nApplying these to the temporal sequence:\n- Initially, with a small central spot of light on, the central photoreceptor is hyperpolarized, so glutamate release is reduced. The OFF bipolar cell receives less excitatory input and is relatively hyperpolarized, providing less excitatory drive to the ganglion cell; the ganglion cell’s firing is suppressed.\n- When the light is abruptly turned off, the central photoreceptor depolarizes and increases glutamate release. This elevated glutamate excites the OFF bipolar cell (depolarization via AMPA/kainate receptors), which increases its excitatory output onto the ganglion cell. The ganglion cell depolarizes and fires a vigorous burst of action potentials.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because turning the light off does not hyperpolarize the photoreceptor, and a decrease in glutamate would not excite an OFF bipolar.\n- B is correct: darkness depolarizes the photoreceptor, increases glutamate, which excites the OFF bipolar, leading to excitation of the ganglion cell.\n- C is incorrect because increased glutamate excites, not inhibits, OFF bipolars; the disinhibition mechanism described does not apply here.\n- D is incorrect because hyperpolarization cannot increase glutamate release.\n- E is incorrect because photoreceptors do not directly synapse onto ganglion cells in the vertical pathway; bipolar cells are required.\n\nThus, the correct causal explanation is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1757662"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of ON and OFF pathways, this exercise challenges you to predict the response of a ganglion cell to a moving stimulus. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1757687] simulates how neurophysiologists map a cell's receptive field, the specific patch of the visual world it \"sees.\" Mastering this practice will deepen your intuition for how center-surround antagonism allows the retina to act as a powerful edge and contrast detector, highlighting changes in the visual scene.", "problem": "In the vertebrate retina, the processing of visual information begins with photoreceptors (rods and cones) which synapse onto bipolar cells, which in turn synapse onto retinal ganglion cells. The axons of ganglion cells form the optic nerve. A single ganglion cell receives input from a specific circular area of the retina, known as its receptive field. Many ganglion cells exhibit a center-surround receptive field organization.\n\nConsider a specific type of ganglion cell known as an ON-center, OFF-surround cell. This cell has a baseline, spontaneous firing rate of action potentials when its entire receptive field is exposed to uniform, moderate illumination. The cell's firing rate is modulated as follows:\n- Light projected onto the circular \"center\" of its receptive field causes an increase in its firing rate (excitation).\n- Light projected onto the annular \"surround\" region of its receptive field causes a decrease in its firing rate (inhibition).\n\nA small, opaque (dark) spot is moved at a constant velocity across a straight line that passes directly through the geometric center of this cell's receptive field. The experiment begins with the spot entirely outside the receptive field, after which it traverses the surround, then the center, then the opposite side of the surround, and finally moves completely out of the receptive field.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the sequence of changes in the firing rate of this ON-center, OFF-surround ganglion cell as the dark spot moves across its receptive field?\n\nA. The firing rate first decreases below baseline, then strongly increases above baseline, then decreases below baseline again, and finally returns to the baseline rate.\nB. The firing rate remains at the baseline, then strongly increases above baseline as the spot crosses the center, and then returns to the baseline rate.\nC. The firing rate first increases above baseline, then strongly decreases below baseline, then increases above baseline again, and finally returns to the baseline rate.\nD. The firing rate remains at the baseline until the spot reaches the center where it strongly decreases below baseline, after which it returns to the baseline rate for the remainder of the path.\nE. The firing rate first decreases below baseline, then decreases even further below baseline in the center, then decreases below baseline again in the far surround, and finally returns to the baseline rate.", "solution": "We model the ON-center, OFF-surround ganglion cell’s firing modulation around baseline by considering how luminance changes in the center and surround regions affect the firing rate. Under uniform, moderate illumination (baseline), let the center and surround luminances be equal to a constant $I_{0}$. Define the change in firing rate relative to baseline as\n$$\n\\Delta r = k_{c}\\,\\Delta L_{c} - k_{s}\\,\\Delta L_{s},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta L_{c}$ and $\\Delta L_{s}$ are the changes in luminance in the center and surround relative to $I_{0}$, and $k_{c}, k_{s} > 0$. This sign structure encodes the ON-center (center excitation by light: $\\Delta L_{c} > 0$ increases firing) and OFF-surround (surround inhibition by light: $\\Delta L_{s} > 0$ decreases firing) organization.\n\nA small opaque spot locally reduces luminance by some amount $\\Delta L < 0$ wherever it lies. As it moves:\n\n1) Spot enters the surround before the center: $\\Delta L_{s} = \\Delta L < 0$, $\\Delta L_{c} = 0$. Then\n$$\n\\Delta r = -k_{s}\\,\\Delta L_{s} = -k_{s}(\\Delta L) = k_{s}|\\Delta L| > 0,\n$$\nso the firing rate increases above baseline due to disinhibition.\n\n2) Spot reaches and traverses the center (with surround not stimulated by the spot at the instant of center crossing): $\\Delta L_{c} = \\Delta L < 0$, $\\Delta L_{s} = 0$. Then\n$$\n\\Delta r = k_{c}\\,\\Delta L < 0,\n$$\nso the firing rate decreases below baseline, with the strongest decrease when the spot is centered.\n\n3) Spot proceeds into the opposite surround: again $\\Delta L_{s} = \\Delta L < 0$, $\\Delta L_{c} = 0$, yielding\n$$\n\\Delta r = k_{s}|\\Delta L| > 0,\n$$\nso the firing rate increases above baseline.\n\n4) Spot exits the receptive field: $\\Delta L_{c} = \\Delta L_{s} = 0$, so $\\Delta r = 0$ and the firing rate returns to baseline.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is: increase above baseline in the first surround, strong decrease below baseline in the center, increase above baseline in the opposite surround, then return to baseline.
