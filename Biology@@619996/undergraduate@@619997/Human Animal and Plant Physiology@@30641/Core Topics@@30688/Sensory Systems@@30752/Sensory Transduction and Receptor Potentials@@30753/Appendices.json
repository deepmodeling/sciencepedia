{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Sensory neurons do more than just detect a stimulus; they also encode its duration and dynamics. This is largely determined by their rate of adaptation, which classifies them as either slowly or rapidly adapting. This practice challenges you to apply these concepts to predict the distinct electrical signatures of two key mechanoreceptors in our skin, helping you understand how our nervous system discerns between a sustained touch and a fleeting vibration [@problem_id:1741290].", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the properties of two distinct types of mechanoreceptors in the glabrous (hairless) skin of a fingertip: the Merkel's disc, which is a slowly adapting receptor, and the Meissner's corpuscle, which is a rapidly adapting receptor. To contrast their behaviors, a small, blunt probe is used to apply a constant indentation to the skin. The stimulus begins at time $t=0$ and is maintained at a constant depth for a duration $T$, where $T$ is a few seconds. At time $t=T$, the probe is rapidly withdrawn.\n\nThe researcher measures the receptor potential of the sensory neuron associated with each receptor type. A receptor potential is a graded change in the neuron's membrane voltage from its resting state.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected receptor potential profiles for both the Merkel's disc and the Meissner's corpuscle in response to this sustained stimulus?\n\nA. Merkel's disc: The receptor potential depolarizes at $t=0$ and remains significantly depolarized for the entire duration from $t=0$ to $t=T$, before returning to the resting state after $t=T$. Meissner's corpuscle: The receptor potential depolarizes transiently at $t=0$, returns to the resting state shortly after, and shows another transient potential change at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.\n\nB. Merkel's disc: The receptor potential depolarizes transiently at $t=0$, returns to the resting state shortly after, and shows another transient potential change at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed. Meissner's corpuscle: The receptor potential depolarizes at $t=0$ and remains significantly depolarized for the entire duration from $t=0$ to $t=T$, before returning to the resting state after $t=T$.\n\nC. Both the Merkel's disc and the Meissner's corpuscle show a receptor potential that depolarizes at $t=0$ and remains significantly depolarized for the entire duration from $t=0$ to $t=T$.\n\nD. Both the Merkel's disc and the Meissner's corpuscle show a receptor potential that depolarizes transiently at $t=0$, returns to the resting state shortly after, and shows another transient potential change at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.\n\nE. Merkel's disc: The receptor potential shows a single, transient depolarization only at $t=0$ and is unresponsive to the removal of the stimulus at $t=T$. Meissner's corpuscle: The receptor potential shows no response at $t=0$ but shows a transient depolarization only at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.", "solution": "1) Identify receptor types and their adaptation properties. Merkel's discs are slowly adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors, meaning their receptor potential during a sustained, constant stimulus remains elevated above baseline for the duration of the stimulus, reflecting static skin deformation. Meissner's corpuscles are rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors, meaning their receptor potential primarily encodes changes in stimulus (onset and offset) and returns to near resting potential during a constant, unchanging stimulus.\n\n2) Apply the mechanotransduction principle for SA and RA receptors to a step indentation. The stimulus is a step input starting at $t=0$ and maintained constant until $t=T$, then rapidly removed. For SA receptors (Merkel), the receptor potential shows an initial dynamic component at $t=0$ followed by a sustained depolarization during $0<t<T$, and then a return to baseline after $t=T$ when the indentation is removed. For RA receptors (Meissner), the receptor potential exhibits a transient depolarization at the onset $t=0$, adapts back toward baseline during $0<t<T$ despite continued indentation, and then exhibits another transient change at $t=T$ upon stimulus removal.\n\n3) Map these expected profiles to the provided statements. Statement A describes: Merkel’s disc depolarizes at $t=0$ and remains significantly depolarized for $0<t<T$, returning to resting after $t=T$; Meissner’s corpuscle shows transient responses at $t=0$ and $t=T$ with baseline in between. This matches the established SA versus RA behavior.\n\n4) Exclude alternatives by contradiction with known physiology. Statement B reverses SA and RA roles; Statement C incorrectly claims sustained depolarization for both; Statement D incorrectly assigns RA-like dynamics to both; Statement E contradicts known onset sensitivity of both RA and SA receptors and ignores offset sensitivity of RA receptors.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1741290"}, {"introduction": "Having distinguished between adaptation types, we now explore the physical mechanism behind rapid adaptation in a classic example: the Pacinian corpuscle. This exercise asks you to connect the unique, layered structure of this receptor to its physiological function as a detector of pressure changes. Understanding this link reveals how biological form is elegantly tuned for a specific sensory function, in this case acting as a biological high-pass filter for mechanical signals [@problem_id:1741286].", "problem": "The Pacinian corpuscle is a type of mechanoreceptor located in the skin and other tissues, responsible for sensitivity to vibration and deep pressure. Structurally, it consists of a bare nerve ending encapsulated by many concentric layers of connective tissue, resembling an onion. This receptor is classified as a *rapidly adapting* or *phasic* receptor.\n\nConsider an experiment where a probe applies a constant, sustained pressure to the skin directly over a single Pacinian corpuscle. The pressure is applied at time $t_{on}$ and is completely removed at a later time $t_{off}$. The receptor potential, which is the graded electrical potential produced by the nerve ending inside the corpuscle, is monitored throughout the experiment.\n\nWhich one of the following options best describes the expected waveform of the receptor potential recorded between times just before $t_{on}$ and just after $t_{off}$?\n\nA. The potential shows a sharp depolarization at $t_{on}$, which is then maintained at a constant, elevated level for the entire duration the pressure is applied (from $t_{on}$ to $t_{off}$), before returning sharply to the resting potential at $t_{off}$.\nB. The potential shows a sharp, transient depolarization at $t_{on}$, which quickly returns to the resting potential even as the pressure is maintained. A second, sharp, transient depolarization occurs at $t_{off}$ when the pressure is removed.\nC. The potential shows a sharp, transient depolarization at $t_{on}$, which quickly returns to the resting potential. No significant change in potential occurs at $t_{off}$ when the pressure is removed.\nD. The potential begins to depolarize at $t_{on}$ and a new, stable, depolarized potential is maintained for the duration of the stimulus. When the stimulus is removed at $t_{off}$, the potential hyperpolarizes below the resting potential before slowly returning to baseline.\nE. The potential shows an initial sharp depolarization at $t_{on}$, after which the potential slowly and continuously decays back towards the resting potential, only reaching the resting potential at time $t_{off}$.", "solution": "Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting (phasic) mechanoreceptors whose encapsulated, viscoelastic lamellae act as a mechanical high-pass filter. The essential physical principle is that the nerve ending is strongly deformed only by changes in the applied force, while sustained, constant force is quickly redistributed by the capsule so that little or no steady deformation reaches the transduction site. Consequently, the receptor potential reflects temporal changes in the stimulus rather than its steady level.\n\nModel the applied pressure (or force) as a temporal step between onset and offset:\n$$\nS(t)=A\\big[u(t-t_{on})-u(t-t_{off})\\big],\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the stimulus amplitude and $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. A rapidly adapting receptor acts approximately like a differentiator followed by a short time-constant filter, so the receptor potential $V_{r}(t)$ can be represented, to first order, as the output of a linear time-invariant system emphasizing changes in $S(t)$:\n$$\nV_{r}(t)\\propto \\left(\\frac{dS}{dt}\\right)\\star h(t),\n$$\nwhere $h(t)$ is a brief impulse response and $\\star$ denotes convolution. Differentiating $S(t)$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt}=A\\big[\\delta(t-t_{on})-\\delta(t-t_{off})\\big],\n$$\nwith $\\delta(t)$ the Dirac delta. Convolution with $h(t)$ yields\n$$\nV_{r}(t)\\propto A\\big[h(t-t_{on})-h(t-t_{off})\\big].\n$$\nThus, the receptor potential consists of brief transients at $t_{on}$ and at $t_{off}$, each decaying rapidly back to baseline. During the sustained interval $t\\in(t_{on},t_{off})$, $V_{r}(t)$ returns close to the resting potential despite the maintained pressure. This matches the defining behavior of a rapidly adapting receptor: strong response to stimulus onset and offset, minimal response to steady stimulation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A describes a tonic, slowly adapting response with maintained depolarization, which contradicts rapid adaptation.\n- B describes sharp, transient depolarizations at both $t_{on}$ and $t_{off}$ with a return to baseline during the sustained stimulus, consistent with the analysis above and with classic Pacinian corpuscle recordings that show on- and off-responses.\n- C lacks the off-response, which is inconsistent with the differentiator-like behavior.\n- D posits a new stable depolarized level and a rebound hyperpolarization at offset, not characteristic of Pacinian corpuscles.\n- E suggests a slow decay that only reaches baseline at $t_{off}$, inconsistent with the short time constant and rapid return to baseline typical of rapid adaptation.\n\nTherefore, the expected waveform is best described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1741286"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts our focus from the timing of a sensory response to the fundamental biophysics that generate the receptor potential itself. By modeling a taste receptor cell as an electrical circuit, you can calculate precisely how the influx of ions through stimulus-gated channels creates a change in membrane voltage.

When a salty solution is applied to the tongue, taste receptor cells are exposed to a high concentration of $Na^+$, which then flows into the cell through a specific class of channels called Epithelial Sodium Channels (ENaCs), causing the cell to depolarize.
