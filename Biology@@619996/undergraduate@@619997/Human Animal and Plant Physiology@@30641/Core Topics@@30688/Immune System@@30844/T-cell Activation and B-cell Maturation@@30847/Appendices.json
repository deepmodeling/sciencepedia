The naive T cells express the T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for a particular peptide, as well as the surface protein CD28. The APCs have been loaded with this same specific peptide, which they are presenting on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. However, these specific APCs have been genetically modified to be completely deficient in the expression of all B7 family proteins (including B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86). All other cellular functions are normal. What is the most likely immunological outcome for the naive CD4$^{+}$ T helper cells that recognize their specific peptide-MHC complex on these APCs?\n\nA. The T cells will be fully activated, begin to secrete cytokines, and undergo clonal expansion.\n\nB. The T cells will enter a functionally unresponsive state known as clonal anergy.\n\nC. The T cells will immediately undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) upon binding to the APC.\n\nD. The T cells will differentiate directly into long-lived memory T cells, bypassing the effector stage.\n\nE. The T cells will differentiate into regulatory T cells (Tregs) and suppress the function of other immune cells.", "solution": "T cell activation requires two cooperative signals. First, antigen recognition via the T-cell receptor, which is the binding of $TCR$ on the naive CD4$^{+}$ T cell to the specific peptide presented on $MHC$ class II on the $APC$ (often termed Signal 1). Second, a costimulatory signal delivered when $CD28$ on the T cell engages $B7$ family ligands ($B7$-1/$CD80$ or $B7$-2/$CD86$) on the $APC$ (Signal 2). Symbolically, $S_{1}+S_{2}\\Rightarrow$ full activation with IL-2 production, clonal expansion, and effector differentiation.\n\nIn the described system, the $APC$s present the relevant peptide-$MHC$ II complexes, so $S_{1}$ is delivered. However, they completely lack all $B7$ family proteins, so $CD28$ cannot engage any ligand and $S_{2}$ is absent. For naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells, receipt of $S_{1}$ in the absence of $S_{2}$ induces a state of peripheral tolerance known as clonal anergy rather than full activation. Mechanistically, $CD28$ costimulation is required to activate $PI3K/Akt$, $NF$-$\\kappa B$, and to support IL-2 transcription and stability; without it, $NFAT$ signaling unopposed by $AP$-$1$ promotes an anergy gene program (e.g., upregulation of E3 ligases such as Cbl-b and GRAIL), leading to a long-lived hyporesponsive state upon restimulation.\n\nImmediate apoptosis (activation-induced cell death) is not the default upon primary antigen recognition without costimulation; AICD typically follows repeated activation and high IL-2 signaling. Differentiation directly into memory T cells requires prior activation and proliferation. Conversion into regulatory T cells generally requires specific cytokine milieus (e.g., $TGF$-$\\beta$ with IL-2) and is not the typical outcome of signal 1 alone without costimulation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is induction of clonal anergy in the naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1748439"}, {"introduction": "Once a T-cell is successfully activated, its job is far from over; it must differentiate into a specialized effector cell tailored to the specific type of threat.

IL-12 signals through STAT4, promoting commitment to the Th1 lineage and the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

This advanced problem presents an immunological puzzle that can only be solved by understanding the principle of \"linked recognition.\" By working through this hypothetical viral infection, you will uncover the elegant mechanism that allows a B-cell targeting a surface protein to receive help from a T-cell that recognizes an internal protein, a concept fundamental to the design of modern conjugate vaccines. [@problem_id:1748450]", "problem": "A novel virus, the Lymphotropic Agility Virus (LAV), has been identified. Its structure consists of a single capsid protein, CP-1, enclosing its genetic material and an internal, non-structural protein, NSP-3. Clinical studies show that a robust, long-lasting immune response requires the production of high-affinity, class-switched Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies targeting a specific conformational epitope, `E_B`, located on the surface of the viral CP-1 protein.\n\nIn a specific population of hosts, genetic factors have resulted in a peculiar T-cell repertoire. All naive CD4$^{+}$ T-helper cells capable of responding to any LAV-derived antigen are exclusively specific for a single linear peptide epitope, `E_T`, which is derived from the internal NSP-3 protein. This `E_T` peptide can only be recognized when presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecule. The naive B-cell repertoire, however, is normal and contains cells with B-cell receptors (BCRs) that can recognize the `E_B` epitope on intact virions.\n\nGiven this conundrum, identify the one correct sequence of events from the options below that describes the minimal necessary pathway for a naive B-cell recognizing `E_B` to differentiate into a plasma cell secreting high-affinity IgG antibodies against `E_B`.\n\nA. The naive B-cell binds the LAV particle via its BCR, internalizes it, and presents the `E_T` peptide on its MHC-II molecules. This presentation is sufficient to directly activate a naive CD4+ T-cell, which then provides help for B-cell differentiation into an IgG-secreting plasma cell.\n\nB. A dendritic cell (DC) phagocytoses an LAV-infected cell, processes viral proteins, and presents the `E_B` peptide on its MHC-II molecules to activate a naive CD4+ T-cell. This activated T-cell then finds a B-cell that has bound LAV and provides the necessary signals for IgG production.\n\nC. The naive B-cell binds the LAV particle, and this binding, along with non-specific signals from the innate immune system, triggers T-cell independent class-switching to IgG and affinity maturation.\n\nD. A dendritic cell (DC) endocytoses an LAV particle, processes it, and presents the `E_T` peptide on its MHC-II molecules, activating a naive CD4+ T-cell into a T-helper cell. Separately, a naive B-cell binds an LAV particle via its BCR, internalizes and processes it, and presents the `E_T` peptide on its MHC-II. The activated T-helper cell then recognizes the `E_T`-MHC-II complex on the B-cell, leading to co-stimulation and cytokine-mediated B-cell differentiation.\n\nE. The naive B-cell binds and internalizes the LAV particle. It processes the virus and presents the `E_T` peptide on an MHC-I molecule. This complex is recognized by a specialized CD4$^{+}$ T-cell, which then provides help for B-cell differentiation into an IgG-secreting plasma cell.", "solution": "Goal: Identify the minimal necessary pathway that allows a naive B cell specific for the conformational epitope $E_{B}$ on CP-1 to receive T cell help and differentiate into a plasma cell secreting high-affinity, class-switched IgG against $E_{B}$, given that all naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells in this population recognize only the linear peptide epitope $E_{T}$ derived from the internal protein NSP-3 and only when presented on MHC-II.\n\nPrinciples to apply:\n- High-affinity, class-switched IgG production against a protein antigen requires a T-dependent germinal center response, which in turn requires CD4$^{+}$ T cell help.\n- Naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells are best primed by professional antigen-presenting cells, especially dendritic cells (DCs), via MHC-II presentation together with co-stimulation (e.g., CD80/CD86 engaging CD28) and polarizing cytokines. B cells generally do not prime naive T cells efficiently.\n- B cells recognize intact antigen via the BCR, internalize the whole antigen, process it, and present derived peptides on MHC-II. The presented peptide need not be the same epitope recognized by the BCR; this is the basis of linked recognition.\n- Cognate T–B interactions require that the T cell recognize on the B cell’s MHC-II a peptide it is specific for; then CD40L–CD40 and cytokines (e.g., IL-21, IL-4 from T follicular helper cells) drive class-switch recombination to IgG and affinity maturation via somatic hypermutation.\n\nDerivation of the minimal correct pathway:\n1. Constraint on T cell specificity: All naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells specific for LAV recognize only $E_{T}$ on MHC-II. Therefore, any activation of naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells must involve presentation of $E_{T}$ on MHC-II by a professional APC, optimally a DC.\n2. DC role in priming: A DC that endocytoses LAV can process viral proteins and present peptides from internal proteins (including NSP-3) on MHC-II. Presentation of $E_{T}$ on MHC-II by the DC, together with co-stimulation and cytokines, activates naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells into T helper (ideally Tfh) cells specific for $E_{T}$.\n3. B cell antigen capture and presentation: A naive B cell with a BCR specific for the conformational epitope $E_{B}$ binds the intact LAV virion via $E_{B}$, internalizes the entire particle, processes all associated proteins, and presents derived peptides on MHC-II, including $E_{T}$ from NSP-3.\n4. Cognate T–B collaboration via linked recognition: The activated $E_{T}$-specific CD4$^{+}$ T helper cell recognizes the $E_{T}$–MHC-II complex on the B cell. This cognate interaction provides CD40L–CD40 co-stimulation and cytokines needed to initiate and sustain germinal center reactions, leading to class-switch recombination to IgG and affinity maturation. The antibody specificity remains for $E_{B}$ because that was the determinant bound by the BCR during antigen capture.\n5. Therefore, the minimal sequence consistent with all constraints is: DC primes $E_{T}$-specific CD4$^{+}$ T cells via MHC-II; B cell binds $E_{B}$ on intact virion, internalizes, processes, and presents $E_{T}$ on MHC-II; activated T helper cell recognizes $E_{T}$–MHC-II on the B cell and delivers help, culminating in high-affinity IgG against $E_{B}$.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells are not efficiently primed by B cells; priming typically requires DCs with robust co-stimulation.\n- B is incorrect because it specifies DC presentation of $E_{B}$ on MHC-II to activate naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells, but the T cell repertoire recognizes only $E_{T}$.\n- C is incorrect because T-independent responses do not produce robust class-switched, high-affinity IgG with affinity maturation.\n- D correctly specifies DC activation of naive CD4$^{+}$ T cells via $E_{T}$ on MHC-II, and B cell presentation of $E_{T}$ after binding $E_{B}$, enabling linked recognition and T-dependent IgG production.\n- E is incorrect because $E_{T}$ on MHC-I would engage CD8$^{+}$ T cells, not CD4$^{+}$ T cells; CD4$^{+}$ T cells require MHC-II.\n\nThus, D is the single correct sequence consistent with immunological principles and the constraints given.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1748450"}]}
