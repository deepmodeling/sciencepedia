The key is the 'threshold potential,' a critical voltage that must be reached for the all-or-none event to occur. This first practice explores the fundamental concept of neuronal excitability by examining how a change in this threshold affects a neuron's responsiveness. By working through this hypothetical scenario, you'll develop a clear understanding of what makes a neuron 'easier' or 'harder' to excite.

An action potential is initiated when a stimulus causes the membrane to depolarize to a threshold potential, at which point voltage-gated sodium channels open. For a normal neuron, this threshold potential is -55 mV.\n\nConsider a scenario where a specific genetic mutation affects the structure of the voltage-gated sodium channels. As a result of this mutation, the channels now require the membrane potential to reach -40 mV before they open. The resting membrane potential of the mutated neuron remains at -70 mV, and all other properties of the neuron, including its ion-channel kinetics and equilibrium potentials, are unchanged.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements best describes the effect of this mutation on the neuron's excitability?\n\nA.

With large $g_{K}$ and small voltage-gated sodium conductance (because sodium channels inactivate), the membrane potential $V$ is driven toward the effective reversal potential determined by parallel conductances.

The repolarization driving force $V - E_{K}$ is somewhat smaller than in a typical neuron (since $E_{K}$ is less negative), so repolarization may be modestly slower, but the hallmark change is the loss of the AHP, not a dramatic slowing as the primary feature.\n- Failure to repolarize (option D) is incorrect; with large $g_{K}$, $V$ is driven to $E_{K} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, not stuck near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- A reduced peak amplitude (option E) would mainly depend on sodium channel properties and $E_{\\text{Na}}$; these are stipulated to be typical, and the resting potential is the same as in a typical neuron, so the peak is not expected to be significantly lower for this reason.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that the afterhyperpolarization phase would be absent or significantly reduced.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708781"}, {"introduction": "While we can describe the phases of an action potential qualitatively, its precise voltage can be calculated using fundamental biophysical principles.
