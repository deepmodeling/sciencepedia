{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This practice explores the fundamental relationship between the physical dimensions of the synapse and the efficacy of signal transmission. The synaptic cleft is not just empty space; its width directly impacts how many neurotransmitter molecules successfully reach their postsynaptic targets. By considering a hypothetical change in cleft width, you will apply principles of diffusion and enzymatic degradation to predict the functional outcome, providing a tangible understanding of why synaptic architecture is so precisely maintained [@problem_id:2351366].", "problem": "In a study of a model chemical synapse, a presynaptic neuron releases a fixed quantity of a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft upon the arrival of an action potential. This neurotransmitter diffuses across the cleft to bind with receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, generating a Postsynaptic Potential (PSP). The synaptic cleft is not an empty space; it contains enzymes that actively degrade the neurotransmitter, reducing its concentration over time.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that causes the width of this synaptic cleft to become exactly twice its normal size, while all other properties, including the number of neurotransmitter molecules released per action potential, the concentration and efficacy of the degradative enzymes, and the density and properties of the postsynaptic receptors, remain unchanged.\n\nBased on the principles of diffusion and enzymatic degradation, what is the most likely effect of this doubled cleft width on the peak amplitude of the PSP generated by a single presynaptic action potential?\n\nA. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will significantly decrease.\n\nB. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will double.\n\nC. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will be halved.\n\nD. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will remain unchanged.\n\nE. The postsynaptic potential will switch from excitatory to inhibitory.\n\nF. The latency of the postsynaptic potential will decrease, but its amplitude will be unchanged.", "solution": "We model neurotransmitter diffusion across the synaptic cleft with enzymatic degradation as one-dimensional diffusion with first-order decay. Let the cleft width be $L$ (normal) and receptors be at $x=L$. A presynaptic action potential releases $N$ molecules at $x=0$ at $t=0$. The concentration $C(x,t)$ satisfies the reaction-diffusion equation\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} - k C,\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $k$ is the effective first-order degradation rate due to enzymes (assumed unchanged by the mutation). For an instantaneous point release in an effectively unbounded medium, the Green’s function solution is\n$$\nC(x,t) = \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{x^{2}}{4 D t}\\Big)\\exp(-k t).\n$$\nEvaluated at the postsynaptic membrane ($x=L$), the time-dependent concentration driving receptor activation is\n$$\nC_{m}(t;L) = \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{L^{2}}{4 D t}\\Big)\\exp(-k t).\n$$\n\nThe peak postsynaptic potential amplitude is a monotonically increasing function of the peak transmitter concentration at the membrane (e.g., for typical ligand-gated receptors, open probability is a monotone function of ligand concentration such as a Hill function). Therefore, it suffices to analyze the peak of $C_{m}(t;L)$ with respect to $t$.\n\nTo find the peak time $t^{*}(L)$, maximize $C_{m}(t;L)$ by setting $\\frac{d}{d t}\\ln C_{m}(t;L)=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d t}\\ln C_{m} = -\\frac{1}{2 t} + \\frac{L^{2}}{4 D}\\frac{1}{t^{2}} - k = 0.\n$$\nMultiply by $t^{2}$ to obtain a quadratic in $t$:\n$$\nk t^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} t - \\frac{L^{2}}{4 D} = 0.\n$$\nThe positive root gives\n$$\nt^{*}(L) = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + k \\frac{L^{2}}{D}}}{2 k},\n$$\nwith the limiting case $t^{*}(L) \\to \\frac{L^{2}}{2 D}$ when $k \\to 0$. Since the square-root term increases with $L^{2}$, $t^{*}(L)$ is strictly increasing in $L$. Thus, doubling the cleft width increases the latency to peak concentration at the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nDefine the peak concentration at the membrane as\n$$\nC_{\\max}(L) \\equiv \\max_{t>0} C_{m}(t;L) = C_{m}\\!\\big(L, t^{*}(L)\\big).\n$$\nTo determine how $C_{\\max}$ changes with $L$, use the envelope theorem: because $t^{*}(L)$ maximizes $C_{m}$ with respect to $t$, we have $\\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial t}\\big|_{t=t^{*}}=0$, and therefore\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d L} C_{\\max}(L) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} C_{m}\\!\\big(L, t^{*}(L)\\big).\n$$\nCompute the partial derivative with respect to $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} C_{m}(t;L) = C_{m}(t;L)\\left(-\\frac{L}{2 D t}\\right).\n$$\nEvaluated at $t=t^{*}(L)$, this gives\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d L} C_{\\max}(L) = -\\frac{L}{2 D\\, t^{*}(L)}\\, C_{\\max}(L) < 0\n$$\nfor all $L>0$, since $D>0$, $t^{*}(L)>0$, and $C_{\\max}(L)>0$. Hence, $C_{\\max}(L)$ is strictly decreasing in $L$. Therefore, doubling the cleft width from $L$ to $2L$ strictly reduces the peak neurotransmitter concentration at the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nBecause the postsynaptic potential amplitude is a monotone increasing function of the transmitter concentration at the receptors and all postsynaptic receptor properties are unchanged, the peak PSP amplitude must also decrease when the cleft width doubles. Moreover, enzymatic degradation ($k>0$) exacerbates the reduction by imposing an extra exponential factor $\\exp(-k t)$ that penalizes the longer diffusion time $t^{*}(2L)>t^{*}(L)$, making the reduction more pronounced than diffusion alone. The latency increases rather than decreases, ruling out any claim of decreased latency.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect is a significant decrease in the peak PSP amplitude, not a precise halving, doubling, or no change, and without any change in polarity (excitatory vs inhibitory) since receptor type is unchanged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351366"}, {"introduction": "Sustained neural communication requires a constant supply of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles, a demand met by an elegant recycling pathway. This exercise examines what happens when a critical component of this machinery, the protein clathrin, is inhibited. By analyzing the consequences of disrupting clathrin-mediated endocytosis during intense synaptic activity, you will gain insight into the essential role of vesicle recycling in maintaining synaptic function and structural integrity [@problem_id:2351311].", "problem": "An experimental neurotoxin, which we will call \"Clathroxin,\" is discovered. Its sole mechanism of action is to selectively and completely inhibit the function of the protein clathrin. In an experiment, a cultured neuron is bathed in a solution containing Clathroxin. Subsequently, the neuron's axon is subjected to sustained high-frequency electrical stimulation, designed to repeatedly trigger action potentials. An electron microscope is used to monitor the morphology of a presynaptic terminal of this neuron, while a postsynaptic electrode measures the response to neurotransmitter release.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected structural and functional changes at the presynaptic terminal?\n\nA. The presynaptic terminal will swell significantly, and after an initial period of release, neurotransmission will fail.\n\nB. The presynaptic terminal will shrink, and neurotransmitter release will be strongly and sustainably potentiated.\n\nC. The number of synaptic vesicles stored in the reserve pool within the terminal will increase, but they will be unable to dock at the active zone.\n\nD. The presynaptic terminal will show no significant change in size, but neurotransmitter release will cease immediately upon the first stimulus.\n\nE. The presynaptic terminal will swell significantly, and neurotransmitter release will continue at a high, sustained rate indefinitely.", "solution": "Clathrin is the coat protein required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the principal mechanism by which synaptic vesicle membrane is retrieved from the presynaptic plasma membrane after exocytosis to regenerate functional synaptic vesicles. In a presynaptic terminal, exocytosis of neurotransmitter relies on the vesicle fusion machinery (including SNAREs and synaptotagmin) and does not require clathrin. By contrast, the regeneration of vesicles from the plasma membrane after fusion requires clathrin to form coated pits and coated vesicles; thus, complete inhibition of clathrin specifically blocks synaptic vesicle recycling while leaving initial exocytosis intact.\n\nWhen the axon is driven by sustained high-frequency stimulation, the rate of exocytosis of existing synaptic vesicles increases. Because clathrin is inhibited, endocytic retrieval of vesicle membrane and reformation of synaptic vesicles cannot occur. The readily releasable pool is depleted first, followed by recruitment and fusion of vesicles from the recycling and reserve pools. However, with no clathrin-mediated endocytosis, these pools cannot be replenished. Consequently, the total number of releasable vesicles progressively declines until neurotransmitter release fails. Functionally, a postsynaptic electrode would detect an initial phase of normal responses followed by progressive synaptic depression culminating in failure.\n\nStructurally, every exocytic event adds membrane to the presynaptic plasma membrane. In the absence of clathrin, this added membrane is not retrieved, causing an accumulation of membrane at the terminal. Electron microscopy would therefore reveal a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles and an increase in presynaptic plasma membrane surface area, often with swollen terminals and possible appearance of abnormal membranous cisternae rather than normal clathrin-coated structures. Thus, swelling of the presynaptic terminal is expected.\n\nThese mechanistic considerations eliminate the alternatives: immediate cessation of release upon the first stimulus does not occur because the existing vesicles can still fuse; sustained potentiation is impossible without recycling because vesicle pools are finite; an increase in reserve pool vesicles is not expected because vesicles are consumed and not replenished; and indefinite high-rate release cannot occur without vesicle regeneration. The outcome that matches both the structural swelling and the functional failure after an initial period of release is therefore the first option.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351311"}, {"introduction": "For a synapse to function, synaptic vesicles must be filled with neurotransmitters, a process that works against a steep concentration gradient and therefore requires a significant energy investment.
