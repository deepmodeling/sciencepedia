This practice challenges you to predict the direct consequences of losing this myelin, forcing a connection between the biophysical properties of the sheath and the overall speed of action potential propagation. By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why demyelinating diseases have such profound effects on neural function [@problem_id:1709090].", "problem": "A team of neurobiologists is investigating a novel environmental toxin, designated Oligocidin-T. Their in-vitro studies reveal that this toxin has a highly specific mechanism of action: it selectively and rapidly triggers apoptosis in oligodendrocytes, while having no discernible effect on neurons or other glial cell types such as astrocytes, microglia, or Schwann cells.\n\nTo understand its physiological impact, the researchers apply a solution containing Oligocidin-T to a live, isolated tissue preparation of the mammalian corticospinal tract, a major pathway within the Central Nervous System (CNS). Assuming the toxin acts immediately as described, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary and most immediate consequence for the myelinated axons within this tract?\n\nA. The speed of action potential propagation along the affected axons will decrease significantly, potentially leading to conduction failure.\n\nB.

The rate of neurotransmitter synthesis within the neuron cell bodies will be inhibited.\n\nE. The affected axons will be rapidly remyelinated by migrating Schwann cells.", "solution": "Oligocidin-T selectively and rapidly induces apoptosis in oligodendrocytes. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes produce and maintain myelin sheaths around axons. The immediate physiological role of myelin is to increase membrane resistance and decrease membrane capacitance along internodal regions, which enables saltatory conduction from node to node.\n\nFormally, along an internodal segment:\n- Myelin increases membrane resistance $r_{m}$ and decreases membrane capacitance $c_{m}$.\n- The electrotonic length constant is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}$, where $r_{i}$ is axial resistance.\n- The membrane time constant is $\\tau = r_{m} c_{m}$.\n\nLoss or acute functional failure of myelin (due to oligodendrocyte apoptosis) causes $r_{m} \\downarrow$ and $c_{m} \\uparrow$. Consequently:\n- $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}$ decreases, so passive depolarization decays more over a given distance, making it harder for current at one node to bring the next node to threshold.\n- The increased $c_{m}$ slows charging of the internodal membrane, increasing the delay before the next node can reach threshold. In myelinated axons, conduction velocity $v$ is limited by how quickly the next node is brought to threshold through passive spread across the internode; qualitatively, as $c_{m}$ increases and $r_{m}$ decreases, the time to reach threshold increases, so $v$ decreases, and conduction can fail if the depolarization at the next node falls below threshold (reduced safety factor).\n\nTherefore, the primary and most immediate effect is a significant decrease in conduction velocity, with potential conduction block.\n\nThe other options do not follow:\n- B: The resting membrane potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ is mainly set by leak conductances (especially $K^{+}$) in the neuronal membrane; myelin integrity does not directly make $V_{\\text{rest}}$ more negative.\n- C: Action potential amplitude at a node is determined by voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channel dynamics and reversal potentials (for example $E_{Na}$), not increased by demyelination.\n- D: Neurotransmitter synthesis in the soma is not immediately inhibited by oligodendrocyte apoptosis.\n- E: Schwann cells are peripheral glia and do not remyelinate CNS axons; they do not rapidly migrate into the CNS in such a preparation.\n\nThus, the correct prediction is the marked slowing of conduction with possible failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1709090"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond structural support, glial cells like astrocytes are active guardians of the brain's microenvironment. This practice explores their critical role in buffering extracellular potassium ions, $[K^+]_o$, which accumulate during intense neuronal activity. By modeling the failure of this buffering system, you can directly calculate how glial function is coupled to neuronal excitability and understand why this homeostatic partnership is essential for preventing pathological network states [@problem_id:1709078].", "problem": "Astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the Central Nervous System (CNS), play a critical homeostatic role by regulating the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid surrounding neurons. During periods of high neuronal activity, repetitive firing of action potentials leads to an efflux of potassium ions ($K^+$) from neurons, causing a transient increase in the local extracellular potassium concentration, $[K^+]_o$. Astrocytes help buffer this increase by taking up excess $K^+$ through specialized, inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (Kir channels) on their membranes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment on a localized region of brain tissue in vitro. A neuropharmacological agent, \"AstroBlock-K,\" is developed that selectively and completely blocks Kir channels on astrocytes without any effect on ion channels located on neurons. The brain tissue is subjected to a brief but intense period of repetitive electrical stimulation that induces a high frequency of action potentials in the local neurons. This is performed under two conditions: (1) a control condition with a standard physiological solution, and (2) an experimental condition where AstroBlock-K has been added to the solution.\n\nCompared to the control condition, which of the following outcomes is the most likely immediate effect of AstroBlock-K on the resting membrane potential and excitability of the local neurons during the period of intense stimulation?\n\nA. Neurons will exhibit a more depolarized (less negative) resting membrane potential, leading to hyperexcitability.\n\nB. Neurons will exhibit a more hyperpolarized (more negative) resting membrane potential, leading to hypoexcitability.\n\nC. Neuronal resting membrane potential and excitability will remain unchanged, as astrocytic functions are not directly coupled to neuronal membrane potential.\n\nD. The threshold potential required to initiate an action potential will significantly increase, making the neurons less excitable.\n\nE. Neurons will become hyperexcitable due to an enhanced influx of sodium ions ($Na^+$) during the rising phase of the action potential.", "solution": "Astrocytic Kir channels normally buffer activity-dependent increases in extracellular potassium by taking up excess $K^{+}$. Blocking these channels with AstroBlock-K reduces astrocytic $K^{+}$ uptake, so during intense neuronal firing the extracellular potassium concentration $[K^{+}]_{o}$ rises more than in control.\n\nThe potassium equilibrium potential is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{K}=\\frac{RT}{zF}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right), \\quad z=+1.\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $[K^{+}]_{o}$ shows monotonic dependence:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{K}}{\\partial [K^{+}]_{o}}=\\frac{RT}{F}\\frac{1}{[K^{+}]_{o}}>0,\n$$\nso an increase in $[K^{+}]_{o}$ makes $E_{K}$ less negative (depolarized).\n\nThe neuronal resting membrane potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ is well described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation:\n$$\nV_{\\text{rest}}\\approx \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{K}[K^{+}]_{o}+P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{o}+P_{Cl}[Cl^{-}]_{i}}{P_{K}[K^{+}]_{i}+P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{i}+P_{Cl}[Cl^{-}]_{o}}\\right),\n$$\nand because at rest $P_{K}\\gg P_{Na},P_{Cl}$, $V_{\\text{rest}}$ closely tracks $E_{K}$. Therefore, an increase in $[K^{+}]_{o}$ depolarizes $V_{\\text{rest}}$ (makes it less negative).\n\nNeuronal excitability depends on the difference $\\Delta=V_{\\text{th}}-V_{\\text{rest}}$, where $V_{\\text{th}}$ is the threshold potential. A depolarization of $V_{\\text{rest}}$ decreases $\\Delta$, making it easier for inputs to reach threshold, i.e., increasing excitability. AstroBlock-K does not directly alter neuronal sodium channel conductance or the threshold in the immediate term, nor does it enhance sodium influx during the action potential rising phase; the primary immediate effect is mediated by the elevated $[K^{+}]_{o}$ and the consequent depolarization.\n\nThus, compared to control, blocking astrocytic Kir channels during intense stimulation will acutely depolarize neurons and increase their excitability.\n\nEliminations:\n- B contradicts the Nernst and GHK predictions.\n- C is incorrect because astrocytic $K^{+}$ buffering directly shapes $[K^{+}]_{o}$ and thereby neuronal $V_{\\text{rest}}$.\n- D is not the immediate effect; threshold is not expected to significantly increase from astrocytic Kir block.\n- E cites an enhanced sodium influx mechanism that is not produced by AstroBlock-K.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect is a depolarized resting potential and hyperexcitability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1709078"}, {"introduction": "The brain's circuitry is not static; it is sculpted by experience, and glial cells play a key role in this plasticity.

Differentiation of the OPC into a myelinating oligodendrocyte is initiated once the fraction of occupied P2Y receptors reaches a critical threshold.\n\nConsider the following simplified biophysical model:\n- A single axon fires action potentials at a constant frequency, $f$.\n- Each action potential causes the release of a fixed number of ATP molecules, $N_{ATP}$, into the confined extracellular volume, $V$.\n- The released ATP is enzymatically degraded and cleared from this volume.
