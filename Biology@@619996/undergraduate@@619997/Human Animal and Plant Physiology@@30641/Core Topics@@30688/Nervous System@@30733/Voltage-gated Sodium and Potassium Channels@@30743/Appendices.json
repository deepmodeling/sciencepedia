This critical repolarization depends on halting the influx of sodium ions. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1757930] isolates the function of the sodium channel's inactivation gate by imagining it is non-functional. This exercise clarifies the essential role of inactivation—a distinct process from channel closing—in shaping the action potential and enabling the rapid reset of the neuron's membrane potential.", "problem": "In a typical neuron, the generation of an action potential is governed by the precise opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. A suprathreshold stimulus causes rapid depolarization as voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channels open, allowing an influx of $Na^{+}$ ions. Repolarization begins as the $Na^{+}$ channels' inactivation gates close, halting the influx, and voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels open, allowing an efflux of $K^{+}$ ions.\n\nConsider a hypothetical neuron with a specific genetic mutation that affects its voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels. In this mutated neuron, the voltage-sensitive activation gate of the $Na^{+}$ channel opens correctly upon depolarization to the threshold, but the inactivation gate is non-functional and fails to close, regardless of the membrane potential.

The neuron shows a normal action potential, but the duration of the repolarization phase is significantly shortened.\n\nC. After the initial depolarization, the membrane potential immediately and rapidly repolarizes to the resting potential without an overshoot, and no further action potentials can be generated.\n\nD. The neuron fires a continuous, high-frequency train of action potentials for as long as the stimulus would have normally been effective.\n\nE.

Because $h$ does not inactivate, the inward $Na^{+}$ current does not turn off; hence there is no intrinsic mechanism to terminate $I_{Na}$ aside from voltage-dependent closure of $m$, which would require repolarization.

The $K^{+}$ conductance, though activated, balances this inward drive at a membrane potential substantially above the resting potential, yielding a depolarized plateau rather than a complete repolarization. There is no mechanism for a train of action potentials: once $m$ and $n$ settle near their steady values at $V^{*}$, $dV/dt=0$ and excitability is effectively suppressed by the depolarization (depolarization block). Immediate rapid repolarization is precluded by the sustained $Na^{+}$ influx, and the mutation does not prevent initial depolarization because the activation gate opens normally.\n\nTherefore, the membrane depolarizes rapidly and then fails to repolarize completely, stabilizing at a prolonged, markedly depolarized plateau relative to rest, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1757930"}, {"introduction": "The link between a neuron's resting potential and its excitability can be surprisingly complex, as illustrated by conditions like hyperkalemia (elevated extracellular $K^+$).

The inactivation gate $h$ approaches a steady-state value that depends on membrane potential, often described by a Boltzmann relationship $h_{\\infty}(V)$ that decreases as $V$ is depolarized.\n- A sustained depolarization (minutes) causes $h$ to relax to a reduced steady-state value $h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}^{\\text{depolarized}})<h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}^{\\text{normal}})$, reducing the fraction of available sodium channels. This lowers the maximal rate of rise of the action potential and raises the effective threshold, making it harder to elicit a spike.\n- Although an immediate, brief depolarization may transiently bring the membrane closer to threshold, the problem specifies that the neuron is allowed to stabilize for minutes in the hyperkalemic solution. Thus the sustained, combined effect is a depolarized resting potential with reduced excitability due to sodium channel inactivation.\n\nConclusion: The resting potential becomes less negative (depolarizes), and the neuron becomes less excitable due to inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels.
