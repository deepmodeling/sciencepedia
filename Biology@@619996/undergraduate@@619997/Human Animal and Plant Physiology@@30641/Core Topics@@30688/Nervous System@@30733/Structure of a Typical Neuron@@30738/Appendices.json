You will use a quantitative approach to determine how a neuron must compensate when its transport machinery is impaired, providing insight into the delicate balance between protein delivery and degradation that is essential for neuronal health.", "problem": "A neuron maintains the health of its axon terminal by transporting a specific protein, let's call it Axon Viability Factor (AVF), from the cell body (soma) to the terminal. The transport is mediated by kinesin motors moving along microtubules. Consider an axon of length $L$. AVF is synthesized in the soma, leading to a concentration $C_0$ of transportable AVF at the axon's start ($x=0$). As AVF travels down the axon at a constant speed $v$, it is also subject to a first-order degradation process with a rate constant $k$. This means the rate of degradation at any point is proportional to the local concentration of AVF.\n\nA specific genetic mutation is introduced that impairs the function of the kinesin motors, reducing their transport speed to a new, slower value $v'$. To compensate and maintain the same steady-state concentration of AVF at the axon terminal (at $x=L$) as in a healthy neuron, the cell upregulates the synthesis of AVF, resulting in a new concentration $C'_0$ at the soma.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Axon length, $L = 20.0$ mm\n- Normal transport speed, $v = 100.0$ mm/day\n- Mutated transport speed, $v' = 50.0$ mm/day\n- Degradation rate constant, $k = 1.00$ day⁻¹\n\nCalculate the fractional increase in the soma concentration of AVF, defined as $\\frac{C'_0 - C_0}{C_0}$, that is required for the neuron to maintain its axon terminal viability.

The specific shape of these spines is not arbitrary; it is a key determinant of synaptic strength and plasticity. In this exercise [@problem_id:1745314], you will apply fundamental principles of electrical circuits to a simplified model of a dendritic spine. By deriving the voltage attenuation factor, you will discover how the spine's physical structure, particularly the resistance of its neck, can modulate the impact of a synaptic signal before it even reaches the parent dendrite.", "problem": "In neuroscience, the morphology of a dendritic spine is thought to play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity. A typical spine consists of a bulbous head, where excitatory synapses are formed, and a thin neck that connects the head to the parent dendrite. The electrical properties of the neck can influence how a local synaptic signal propagates to the rest of the neuron.\n\nConsider a simplified steady-state electrical model of this system. The spine head is modeled as a compartment with a membrane resistance $R_{head}$ to the extracellular space (ground). The parent dendrite, at the point where the spine attaches, is modeled as a compartment with an input resistance $R_{dendrite}$ to ground. The cytoplasm within the spine neck is modeled as a single axial resistor with resistance $R_{neck}$ that connects the spine head compartment to the dendrite compartment.\n\nAn ongoing synaptic activation on the spine head generates an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP). In this steady-state model, this activation establishes a constant voltage difference $V_H$ in the spine head and a corresponding constant voltage $V_D$ at the base of the spine on the parent dendrite, both measured relative to the extracellular ground.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the dimensionless voltage attenuation factor, $\\alpha = \\frac{V_D}{V_H}$, in terms of the given resistances $R_{head}$, $R_{neck}$, and $R_{dendrite}$.", "solution": "We model the system as a two-node resistive network at steady state.

The dendrite node has voltage $V_{D}$ relative to ground and is connected to ground via $R_{dendrite}$. There is no external current source at the dendrite node, so Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) at the dendrite node requires that the current flowing through the neck into the dendrite equals the leak current from the dendrite to ground:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{H}-V_{D}}{R_{neck}}=\\frac{V_{D}}{R_{dendrite}}.\n$$\nSolving algebraically for the ratio $\\alpha=\\frac{V_{D}}{V_{H}}$, proceed step by step:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{H}-V_{D}}{R_{neck}}=\\frac{V_{D}}{R_{dendrite}}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nR_{dendrite}\\left(V_{H}-V_{D}\\right)=R_{neck}V_{D}\n$$\n$$\nR_{dendrite}V_{H}-R_{dendrite}V_{D}=R_{neck}V_{D}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nR_{dendrite}V_{H}=V_{D}\\left(R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{V_{D}}{V_{H}}=\\frac{R_{dendrite}}{R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}}.\n$$\nThus the attenuation factor is\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{V_{D}}{V_{H}}=\\frac{R_{dendrite}}{R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}}.\n$$\nNote that $R_{head}$ does not enter this ratio because the dendrite node’s KCL, which fixes the relation between $V_{D}$ and $V_{H}$, depends only on the pathway through $R_{neck}$ and the leak through $R_{dendrite}$.
