But is this an inherent property of the axon itself? This classic thought experiment [@problem_id:1736730] challenges you to predict the outcome of stimulating an axon in its middle, revealing the fundamental principles that enforce unidirectional propagation in a physiological context. Understanding this behavior is key to appreciating the role of the refractory period in ensuring orderly and reliable information flow.", "problem": "In a neurophysiology experiment, a long, isolated myelinated axon is placed in a saline bath that mimics extracellular fluid. Using a microelectrode, a researcher delivers a single electrical stimulus at the exact midpoint of the axon. The stimulus is suprathreshold, meaning it is strong enough to reliably generate a single action potential at the point of stimulation. Under normal physiological conditions within the body, an action potential is initiated at the axon hillock and propagates in only one direction toward the axon terminal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the propagation of the action potential generated by this artificial, midpoint stimulus and provides the correct primary reason for why this behavior differs from normal physiological propagation?\n\nA. The action potential will propagate only toward the axon terminal. This is because the molecular machinery of ion channels inherently favors movement away from the cell body.\n\nB. The action potential will propagate in both directions away from the midpoint. This differs from physiological propagation because a natural stimulus at the synapse is always much stronger, overwhelming any tendency for backward movement.\n\nC. The action potential will not propagate. An action potential can only be initiated at the axon hillock, where the density of voltage-gated sodium channels is uniquely high.\n\nD. The action potential will propagate only toward the cell body. This is because the artificial stimulus disrupts the normal electrical gradient which is oriented from the hillock to the terminal.\n\nE. The action potential will propagate in both directions away from the midpoint. This differs from physiological propagation, which is unidirectional because the signal is initiated at one end of the axon, and the membrane immediately behind the propagating action potential becomes temporarily refractory.", "solution": "We model the axon as an excitable cable with membrane potential denoted by $V(x,t)$ along position $x$ and time $t$. An action potential (AP) is initiated when the local membrane potential at an excitable segment (e.g., a node of Ranvier) exceeds a threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$. The passive spread of voltage along the axon obeys a cable-like relation that, in lumped form, can be written as\n$$\nc_{m}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}=\\frac{1}{r_{i}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}}-\\frac{V}{r_{m}}+I_{\\text{ion}}(V,\\text{gating})+I_{\\text{stim}}(x,t),\n$$\nwhere $c_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance per unit length, $r_{i}$ is the axial (internal) resistance per unit length, $r_{m}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length, $I_{\\text{ion}}$ is the active ionic current governed by voltage-gated channel kinetics, and $I_{\\text{stim}}$ is the applied stimulus current. In Hodgkinâ€“Huxley-type terms, the rapid upstroke of the AP depends on activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, with an inactivation variable that produces a refractory period. Immediately after an AP passes, sodium channels are inactivated (absolute refractory period), and potassium conductance is elevated (relative refractory period), so the recently excited membrane cannot immediately fire again.\n\nUnder normal physiological initiation at the axon hillock (take $x=0$ as hillock, axon along $x>0$), a suprathreshold depolarization produces an AP that propagates in the $+x$ direction. The region just behind the advancing wavefront (toward $x<0$) is temporarily refractory for a duration $\\tau_{\\text{ref}}$, so even though axial currents spread in both directions, the backward direction encounters membrane with inactivated sodium channels and elevated potassium conductance, preventing re-excitation. Thus, unidirectional propagation arises because the AP starts at one end and leaves a refractory wake behind it.\n\nIn the experiment, a suprathreshold, brief stimulus is applied at the midpoint of a long, isolated myelinated axon. Let the stimulus be represented schematically as $I_{\\text{stim}}(x,t)=I_{0}\\delta(x-x_{0})f(t)$, with $x_{0}$ at the midpoint and $f(t)$ brief, such that $V(x_{0},t)$ crosses $V_{\\text{th}}$. Because both sides of the midpoint (for $x<x_{0}$ and $x>x_{0}$) are initially at rest (not refractory), the depolarizing axial currents spread in both directions and bring adjacent excitable nodes on both sides to threshold:\n$$\nV(x_{0}\\pm\\Delta x,t)\\to V_{\\text{th}} \\quad \\text{for some } t>t_{0},\n$$\nthereby initiating two AP wavefronts that propagate away from the midpoint in opposite directions. Each wavefront then leaves a refractory region behind it, which prevents retrograde re-entry of the same wave into the region it has just excited. The key point is that, unlike the physiological case where initiation at one end ensures the membrane behind the wave is refractory, here the initial condition sets excitable membrane on both sides of the source, allowing bidirectional propagation.\n\nEvaluating the answer choices:\n- A is incorrect. Ion channel kinetics do not confer an inherent spatial bias favoring propagation away from the soma; directionality arises from initial conditions and refractoriness.\n- B is incorrect in its reasoning. The difference from physiological propagation is not because natural stimuli are stronger; rather, it is due to the refractory state of the membrane immediately behind the wavefront in a unidirectional initiation scenario.\n- C is incorrect. While the axon hillock has high voltage-gated sodium channel density, a suprathreshold stimulus at an excitable segment (e.g., a node of Ranvier) elsewhere can initiate an AP that propagates.\n- D is incorrect. There is no imposed fixed electrical gradient dictating direction; propagation direction is determined by which neighboring regions are excitable versus refractory.\n- E is correct. A midpoint suprathreshold stimulus produces two APs that propagate in opposite directions, and normal unidirectionality in vivo results because the AP starts at one end and the membrane just activated becomes refractory, blocking backward propagation.\n\nTherefore, the action potential will propagate in both directions away from the midpoint, and the unidirectionality in normal physiology is due to the refractory membrane region immediately behind the propagating action potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1736730"}, {"introduction": "The all-or-none action potential relies on the exquisitely timed opening and closing of different ion channels.

The primary mechanism of this toxin is its irreversible binding to voltage-gated sodium (Na$^{+}$) channels in neurons. This binding alters the channel's function by preventing the inactivation gate from closing. Consequently, once a Na$^{+}$ channel is opened by membrane depolarization, it remains permanently open as long as the membrane potential is above the channel's closing threshold.\n\nConsider a myelinated axon exposed to a concentration of BTX sufficient to affect all of its Na$^{+}$ channels. A single electrical stimulus is applied to one end of the axon, initiating an action potential. Due to the toxin, the Na$^{+}$ channels open and stay open, causing a sustained depolarization. This prolonged depolarization, in turn, causes the voltage-gated potassium (K$^{+}$) channels to open and remain fully open.
