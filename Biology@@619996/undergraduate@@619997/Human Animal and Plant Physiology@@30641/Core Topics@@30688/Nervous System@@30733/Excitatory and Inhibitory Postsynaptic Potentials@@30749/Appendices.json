The intracellular potassium concentration is maintained at $[K^+]_{in} = 140$ mM. In an experiment, the standard extracellular solution is replaced with one containing a high potassium concentration of $[K^+]_{out} = 50.0$ mM. After the neuron has stabilized in this new environment, a neurotransmitter is applied that exclusively opens ligand-gated potassium channels.\n\nAssume the experiment is conducted at mammalian body temperature (37 °C), where the Nernst potential for a monovalent cation can be calculated using the formula:\n$E_{ion} = (61.5 \\text{ mV}) \\cdot \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}}\\right)$\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting postsynaptic potential?\n\nA.

A depolarizing postsynaptic response is, by definition, an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP). The classification as EPSP does not require that threshold be reached; it is based on the depolarizing direction of the potential change.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that opening $K^{+}$ channels produces an EPSP here because the equilibrium potential for $K^{+}$ is now less negative than the resting membrane potential.\n\nOptions analysis:\n- A is incorrect: opening $K^{+}$ channels is not intrinsically inhibitory; it depends on $E_{K}$ relative to $V$.\n- B states a true mechanistic detail in this specific setup (inward $K^{+}$ flux), but the most general and accurate rationale is the position of $E_{K}$ relative to $V_{m}$.\n- C would only hold if $V = E_{K}$ exactly, which is not generally warranted; the given comparison shows a nonzero driving force.\n- D correctly identifies the general principle leading to a depolarizing (excitatory) effect.\n- E is incorrect because EPSP versus IPSP is not determined by whether threshold is reached.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$"}, {"introduction": "For a neuron to integrate signals that arrive in rapid succession—a process known as temporal summation—it must retain a \"memory\" of the first potential when the second one arrives.
