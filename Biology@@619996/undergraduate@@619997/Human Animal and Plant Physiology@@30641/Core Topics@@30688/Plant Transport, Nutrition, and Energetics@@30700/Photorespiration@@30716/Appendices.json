{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Photorespiration is often described as a \"wasteful\" pathway, but what is its actual cost to the plant in terms of fixed carbon? This first exercise provides a quantitative foundation by asking you to perform a careful accounting of carbon atoms as they move through the photorespiratory salvage pathway. By tracking the fate of the products from RuBisCO's oxygenase reaction, you will calculate the net loss of carbon for every molecule of oxygen that is fixed, revealing the fundamental inefficiency of this metabolic route [@problem_id:2329916].", "problem": "The enzyme Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is central to photosynthetic carbon fixation. However, it possesses an 'inefficient' oxygenase activity in addition to its primary carboxylase function. When RuBisCO reacts with O2 instead of CO2, it initiates a pathway known as photorespiration, which results in a net loss of previously fixed carbon.\n\nConsider the initial step of photorespiration where RuBisCO acts on one molecule of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), a 5-carbon sugar. The reaction with one molecule of O2 yields one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), which contains 3 carbon atoms, and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate, which contains 2 carbon atoms.\n\nThe 3-PGA molecule can directly re-enter the Calvin-Benson cycle and is thus considered salvaged. The 2-phosphoglycolate molecule, however, must be processed through a complex salvage pathway that spans the chloroplast, peroxisome, and mitochondrion. To simplify the accounting, the net result of this salvage pathway can be summarized as follows: two molecules of 2-phosphoglycolate are consumed to produce one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate and one molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nGiven this information, calculate the net number of fixed carbon atoms that are lost as CO2 for every single oxygenation event (i.e., for every one molecule of O2 that reacts with RuBP). Your answer should be a single number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the net number of fixed carbon atoms lost as CO2 per single oxygenation event catalyzed by RuBisCO. We must carefully track the carbon atoms through the specified reactions.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial oxygenation reaction.\nOne oxygenation event involves one molecule of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), which has 5 carbon atoms, reacting with O2.\nThe products are:\n- One molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), which contains 3 carbon atoms.\n- One molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG), which contains 2 carbon atoms.\nThe total number of carbons is conserved in this initial step: $5\\text{C} \\rightarrow 3\\text{C} + 2\\text{C}$.\nThe 3-PGA molecule is immediately salvaged by re-entering the Calvin-Benson cycle. So, we only need to track the fate of the 2-PG molecule.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the stoichiometry of the salvage pathway.\nThe problem states that the salvage pathway for 2-PG requires *two* molecules of 2-PG as input to proceed. A single oxygenation event only produces *one* molecule of 2-PG. Therefore, to correctly account for the carbon loss, we must consider what happens over the course of *two* oxygenation events, which will produce the two molecules of 2-PG needed for one full cycle of the salvage pathway.\n\nStep 3: Track the carbon atoms for two oxygenation events.\n- **Input:** Two oxygenation events consume 2 molecules of RuBP.\n  Total input carbon = $2 \\times 5\\text{C} = 10\\text{C}$.\n- **Products of the two initial reactions:**\n  - $2 \\times (1 \\text{ molecule of 3-PGA}) = 2$ molecules of 3-PGA (Total $2 \\times 3\\text{C} = 6\\text{C}$).\n  - $2 \\times (1 \\text{ molecule of 2-PG}) = 2$ molecules of 2-PG (Total $2 \\times 2\\text{C} = 4\\text{C}$).\n- **Fate of the products:**\n  - The 2 molecules of 3-PGA (6C) are directly salvaged.\n  - The 2 molecules of 2-PG (4C) enter the salvage pathway.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the output of the salvage pathway.\nThe problem states that the salvage pathway takes 2 molecules of 2-PG (a total of 4C) and produces:\n- One molecule of 3-PGA (which contains 3C).\n- One molecule of CO2 (which contains 1C).\nThe carbon atoms are conserved in the salvage pathway: $4\\text{C} \\rightarrow 3\\text{C} + 1\\text{C}$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the net carbon loss for two oxygenation events.\nLet's tally the final products after two oxygenation events and the subsequent salvage pathway:\n- Total carbon recovered as 3-PGA (a useful intermediate for the Calvin cycle) = (2 molecules from initial reaction) + (1 molecule from salvage) = 3 molecules of 3-PGA. This accounts for $3 \\times 3\\text{C} = 9\\text{C}$.\n- Total carbon lost as CO2 = 1 molecule of CO2. This accounts for $1\\text{C}$.\n- The total number of carbons accounted for is $9\\text{C} + 1\\text{C} = 10\\text{C}$, which matches the initial input from 2 molecules of RuBP.\nSo, for every *two* oxygenation events, exactly *one* carbon atom is lost as CO2.\n\nStep 6: Determine the carbon loss per single oxygenation event.\nThe question asks for the net number of carbon atoms lost per *single* oxygenation event. Since 1 carbon atom is lost for every 2 events, the loss per single event is:\nLoss per event = $\\frac{1 \\text{ C atom lost}}{2 \\text{ events}} = 0.5$ C atoms lost per event.\n\nTherefore, for every single oxygenation event, a net of 0.5 fixed carbon atoms are lost.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "2329916"}, {"introduction": "The rate of photorespiration is not constant; it is highly sensitive to environmental conditions.

This closure restricts gas exchange, causing the internal CO2 concentration, $[\\text{CO}_2]_2$, to drop significantly to $95 \\text{ ppm}$.
