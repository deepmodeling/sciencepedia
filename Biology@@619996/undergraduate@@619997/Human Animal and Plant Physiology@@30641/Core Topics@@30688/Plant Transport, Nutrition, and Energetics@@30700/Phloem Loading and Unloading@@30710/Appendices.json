This conceptual exercise uses a common household item—a celery stalk—to challenge a key misconception [@problem_id:1727911]. By analyzing why externally supplied sucrose isn't transported upwards, you will appreciate the biological specificity and energy dependence of phloem loading, which requires specialized cellular machinery found only in designated source tissues.", "problem": "An undergraduate student conducting a plant physiology experiment takes a freshly cut celery stalk (which primarily consists of a petiole and some leaflets) and places its base in a beaker containing a concentrated, sterile sucrose solution. The experimental setup is left for several hours under standard laboratory conditions. Subsequent analysis of the tissues in the upper part of the leaflets reveals that, while water has moved up the xylem, the sucrose from the beaker has not been transported upwards through the phloem tissue. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate physiological explanation for this observation?\n\nA. Phloem loading is a highly regulated active transport process that requires specific cellular machinery and metabolic energy, which are primarily located in specialized source tissues (like mature leaves performing photosynthesis) and are not functional along the cut vascular bundles of the celery stalk.\n\nB. The sucrose solution is too viscous for the plant to transport. The cohesive and adhesive properties of water that drive transport are disrupted by the high solute concentration, preventing any bulk flow in the vascular tissues.\n\nC. The high external concentration of sucrose creates a strong negative water potential outside the phloem, causing water to move out of the sieve tubes and into the beaker, thereby generating a hydrostatic pressure that opposes any upward movement.\n\nD. Upward transport in the phloem is initiated by a pressure gradient established by active water uptake in the roots. Since the celery stalk is cut and lacks roots, this initial pressure pump is missing.\n\nE. The transport of sucrose into the phloem is a passive process driven by diffusion. The existing concentration of sugars within the phloem sap is already higher than that of the solution in the beaker, preventing a favorable diffusion gradient.", "solution": "We analyze the distinct transport mechanisms of xylem and phloem and the anatomical-physiological constraints imposed by cutting the stalk.\n\nStep 1: Explain why water still moves in the xylem of a cut stalk.\nThe ascent of xylem sap is driven by the cohesion-tension mechanism, which relies on transpiration at the leaf surfaces to generate a negative pressure potential in the xylem. This process is passive and can persist in a cut stem because xylem vessels are dead, lignified conduits that can maintain a continuous water column from the beaker to the leaves, provided that the leaves are transpiring. Thus, water can move upward through the xylem even without roots.\n\nStep 2: State what drives phloem translocation under normal conditions.\nAccording to the pressure-flow (Münch) hypothesis, phloem transport requires:\n- Active loading of sucrose at source tissues (typically mature photosynthetic leaves) into sieve elements via companion cells, often through proton-coupled sucrose symporters powered by a plasma membrane H^{+}-ATPase.\n- This loading decreases the solute potential in sieve elements, draws water osmotically from the xylem, increases hydrostatic pressure at the source, and drives bulk flow toward sinks along the sieve tube network.\n- Unloading occurs at sinks; transport direction is set by source-sink pressure differences, not by root-generated pressures.\n\nStep 3: Identify why sucrose in the beaker is not transported upward in the phloem of a cut stalk.\n- Specialized phloem-loading machinery (companion cells with H^{+}-ATPase and sucrose transporters, often localized to minor veins of source leaves) is not generally functional at a cut petiole base. Therefore, sucrose in the external beaker solution is not effectively taken up into sieve elements to initiate a source-like high-pressure region at the base.\n- Additionally, cutting phloem triggers rapid occlusion (P-protein plugging and callose deposition), which seals sieve plates to prevent sap loss and disrupts continuity, further preventing uptake and mass flow initiation from the cut end.\n- Consequently, although xylem can still conduct water upward, phloem does not load sucrose from the beaker nor establish the necessary pressure gradient for upward translocation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A: Correct. It accurately states that phloem loading is a regulated, energy-dependent process localized to specialized source tissues and not operative along cut vascular bundles; thus exogenous sucrose at the cut base is not loaded into phloem.\n- B: Incorrect. While viscosity affects flow, phloem sap is normally sucrose-rich and still flows; moreover, the limiting factor here is loading/continuity, not viscosity of an external solution.\n- C: Incorrect. The beaker’s external solution does not set phloem driving pressures in intact sieve tubes; any local water potential effect at the cut base would not generate a sustained opposing hydrostatic pressure that explains the absence of upward sucrose translocation.\n- D: Incorrect. Phloem pressure gradients arise from source loading, not from active water uptake in roots; root pressure is relevant to xylem, not the primary driver of phloem flow.\n- E: Incorrect. Phloem loading is not generally passive diffusion; in many species it is active apoplastic loading. The premise about diffusion gradients is also flawed in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physiological explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1727911"}, {"introduction": "Phloem loading is a dynamic system, finely tuned to the plant's overall metabolic state. This advanced practice moves beyond static principles to explore a quantitative model of feedback regulation, where the accumulation of sucrose in the phloem downregulates the very transporters responsible for its loading [@problem_id:1727886]. Working through this problem will integrate concepts of enzyme kinetics and gene expression, demonstrating how plants modulate nutrient transport in response to changing source-sink demands.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is investigating a proposed feedback mechanism for phloem loading in a source leaf. The hypothesis is that high sucrose concentration within the phloem itself negatively regulates the synthesis of the very transporters responsible for loading it. To model this, a quantitative relationship is proposed.\n\nThe total sucrose loading rate into a phloem companion cell, $L$, is given by the product of the number of active Sucrose Transporter (SUT) proteins, $N_{SUT}$, and the sucrose transport rate of an individual protein, $v_{ind}$. Thus, $L = N_{SUT} \\cdot v_{ind}$.\n\nThe rate of an individual transporter, $v_{ind}$, depends on the sucrose concentration in the apoplast (the space outside the cell), $[S]_{apo}$, and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics:\n$$v_{ind} = v_{max} \\frac{[S]_{apo}}{K_m + [S]_{apo}}$$\nwhere $v_{max}$ is the maximum transport rate per transporter and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe number of active transporters, $N_{SUT}$, is maintained at a steady-state level that is negatively regulated by the sucrose concentration inside the phloem sieve tube, $[S]_{phloem}$. This relationship is modeled by an exponential decay function:\n$$N_{SUT} = N_0 \\exp(-k [S]_{phloem})$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the hypothetical maximum number of transporters and $k$ is an inhibition constant.\n\nAn experiment is conducted under two different steady-state conditions:\n**Condition 1 (Control):** A plant with a strong, active sink (e.g., a developing fruit) is monitored. The measured parameters in a source leaf are:\n- Apoplastic sucrose concentration, $[S]_{apo,1} = 2.50$ mmol/L.\n- Phloem sucrose concentration, $[S]_{phloem,1} = 500$ mmol/L.\n\n**Condition 2 (Sink-Limited):** The primary sink is surgically removed. After the plant reaches a new steady state, the sucrose accumulation causes the apoplastic concentration in the source leaf to rise to $[S]_{apo,2} = 15.0$ mmol/L. In this new state, the total phloem loading rate, $L_2$, is measured to be 25.0% of the loading rate in the control condition ($L_2 = 0.250 L_1$).\n\nUsing the model and the experimental data, calculate the new phloem sucrose concentration, $[S]_{phloem,2}$, under the sink-limited condition.\n\nThe following parameter values for the model have been determined independently:\n- $v_{max} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-5}$ pmol/s per transporter\n- $K_m = 5.00$ mmol/L\n- $N_0 = 8.00 \\times 10^4$ transporters per cell\n- $k = 4.00 \\times 10^{-3}$ (mmol/L)$^{-1}$\n\nExpress your answer in mmol/L, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the phloem sucrose concentration in the sink-limited condition, $[S]_{phloem,2}$.
