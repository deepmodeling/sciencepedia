This mutant strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the SUT1 sucrose-proton symporter. In wild-type plants, SUT1 is highly expressed and localized to the plasma membrane of companion cells within the minor veins of source leaves. This symporter is essential for actively loading sucrose from the apoplast (the space outside the cell membrane) into the phloem. The mutant plant is grown alongside a wild-type control plant under identical, optimal conditions for photosynthesis and growth (i.e., adequate light, water, and soil nutrients).\n\nBased on the pressure-flow hypothesis of phloem transport, which of the following sets of physiological consequences would be most expected in the SUT1 mutant plant compared to the wild-type control?\n\nA. Increased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, decreased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth.\n\nB. Decreased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, increased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth.\n\nC.

The water potential of a cell is given by $\\Psi_{w} = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p}$ (neglecting gravity and matric terms for these tissues), where $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute potential (more negative with more solute) and $\\Psi_{p}$ is the turgor pressure. In source leaves of wild type, SUT1 actively loads sucrose from the apoplast into companion cells/sieve elements, making $\\Psi_{s}$ in the sieve tubes more negative, which draws in water osmotically from the xylem, thereby increasing $\\Psi_{p}$ in sieve tube elements. This elevated $\\Psi_{p}$ at the source drives mass flow toward sinks.\n\nIn the SUT1 loss-of-function mutant:\n1) Phloem loading in source leaves is impaired. Therefore, in sieve tube elements of source leaves, sucrose concentration is reduced relative to wild type, so $\\Psi_{s}$ is less negative, water influx is reduced, and $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure) in sieve tube elements decreases relative to wild type.\n2) Because sucrose export from mesophyll to the phloem is impaired, sugars accumulate in source leaf cells (mesophyll and associated tissues). This accumulation makes $\\Psi_{s}$ in mesophyll cells more negative, causing greater water influx and thus an increase in $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure) of mesophyll cells relative to wild type.\n3) Reduced phloem export from source leaves lowers carbohydrate delivery to sinks such as roots, leading to severely inhibited root growth.\n\nThese outcomes correspond to increased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, decreased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth, which matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1752303"}, {"introduction": "While pressure generation at the source initiates flow, the process relies equally on the pressure release at the sink. This problem challenges you to think about the system's dynamics by considering what happens when the sink stops functioning correctly. This thought experiment highlights how active unloading of sugars is essential for maintaining the pressure gradient that drives the continuous movement of sap throughout the plant [@problem_id:1752300].", "problem": "In vascular plants, the long-distance transport of sugars from photosynthetic leaves (sources) to non-photosynthetic tissues like roots or fruits (sinks) occurs through the phloem. This process is primarily explained by the pressure-flow hypothesis. According to this model, the active loading of sucrose into phloem sieve-tube elements at the source tissue lowers the local water potential, causing water to enter from the adjacent xylem via osmosis. This influx of water generates a high hydrostatic pressure ($P_{\\text{source}}$). Conversely, at the sink tissue, sucrose is actively unloaded from the phloem for metabolism or storage. This removal of solute raises the local water potential, causing water to exit the phloem and return to the xylem, which results in a low hydrostatic pressure ($P_{\\text{sink}}$). The resulting pressure gradient, $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{source}} - P_{\\text{sink}}$, drives the bulk flow of sugar-rich sap from source to sink.\n\nConsider a healthy plant where a mature leaf is efficiently supplying sucrose to a developing fruit. An experiment is conducted where a chemical inhibitor is selectively applied to the fruit. This inhibitor specifically blocks the active transport machinery responsible for unloading sucrose from the phloem sieve-tube elements into the fruit's cells, without immediately affecting other metabolic processes.\n\nAssuming the source leaf continues to produce and load sucrose at a constant rate, what are the immediate consequences of this inhibition for the hydrostatic pressure within the phloem at the sink ($P_{\\text{sink}}$) and for the overall pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$) driving the flow?\n\nA. $P_{\\text{sink}}$ increases, and the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ decreases.\n\nB. $P_{\\text{sink}}$ decreases, and the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ increases.\n\nC. $P_{\\text{sink}}$ increases, and the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ increases.\n\nD. $P_{\\text{sink}}$ decreases, and the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ decreases.\n\nE.

This lowers $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor) at the sink, producing low $P_{\\text{sink}}$.\n\n4) With unloading inhibited at the sink: Sucrose cannot be actively removed, so $C$ in the sink-region sieve elements remains high or increases due to continued source loading.

Therefore, the hydrostatic pressure at the sink increases:\n$$\nP_{\\text{sink}} \\text{ increases.}\n$$\n\n5) Consequence for the driving gradient: With $P_{\\text{source}}$ maintained by continued loading and $P_{\\text{sink}}$ increased as above, the pressure difference\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_{\\text{source}} - P_{\\text{sink}}\n$$\ndecreases. Hence the bulk flow slows.\n\nTherefore, immediately after inhibition of sink unloading, $P_{\\text{sink}}$ increases and $\\Delta P$ decreases.\n\nThe correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1752300"}, {"introduction": "The pressure gradient provides the driving force, but the physical anatomy of the phloem dictates the actual rate of flow. This practice delves into the physics of the transport pathway, modeling the sieve tubes and plates as a series of hydraulic resistances.

This transport occurs through a series of connected cells called sieve tube elements, which are joined end-to-end. The junction between two sieve tube elements is a perforated wall called a sieve plate.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a functional phloem unit consisting of a single cylindrical sieve tube element of length $L$ and radius $R$, connected in series to a single sieve plate.

The sap can be modeled as a viscous fluid with viscosity $\\eta$. The entire unit is subject to a total pressure drop of $\\Delta P$ from one end to the other, which drives the flow.\n\nNow, consider a plant with a genetic mutation that leads to the excessive synthesis of callose, a polysaccharide that is deposited around the sieve plate pores. This deposition partially clogs the pores, reducing their effective radius to a new value, $r_{m}$, where $r_{m} < r_{0}$.
