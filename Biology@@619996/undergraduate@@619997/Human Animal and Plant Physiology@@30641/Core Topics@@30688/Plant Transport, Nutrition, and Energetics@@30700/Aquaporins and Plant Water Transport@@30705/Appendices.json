This exercise presents a thought experiment comparing a normal wild-type plant to a mutant that cannot produce key aquaporins when both face drought conditions. By predicting which plant will fare worse, you will develop an intuitive understanding of how these molecular channels are critical for a plant's overall ability to manage water stress and maintain its structure. [@problem_id:1692894]", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate the role of aquaporins in plant water relations under stress. Two groups of *Arabidopsis thaliana* plants are used: a wild-type (WT) group and a mutant group. The mutant plants have a loss-of-function mutation in a key gene encoding for Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs), a major class of aquaporins responsible for water transport across cell membranes, particularly in the roots and vascular tissues.\n\nBoth groups of plants are initially well-watered and grown in identical soil conditions. At the start of the experiment (t=0), watering is completely stopped for both groups. After 48 hours (t=48h), the physical appearance of the plants is observed. It is noted that one group of plants is significantly more wilted (i.e., showing greater loss of turgor in its leaves) than the other.\n\nBased on the physiological role of aquaporins, which of the following statements provides the most accurate prediction and explanation for the observation at t=48 hours?\n\nA. The WT plant will be more wilted because its functional aquaporins allow for a higher rate of water loss from the roots back into the drying soil, driven by the soil's increasingly negative water potential.\n\nB. The mutant plant will be more wilted because the lack of functional aquaporins severely restricts the rate of water transport from the roots to the leaves, failing to replace water lost via transpiration, thus leading to a rapid loss of leaf turgor pressure.\n\nC. The mutant plant will be less wilted because the absence of aquaporins reduces overall water permeability, leading to slower water loss from the plant to the atmosphere and conserving more water within the plant tissues.\n\nD. Both plants will be equally wilted, as after 48 hours, the primary limiting factor is the near-zero water availability in the soil, rendering the efficiency of water transport by aquaporins irrelevant.\n\nE. The WT plant will be more wilted because its higher transpiration rate, supported by efficient water uptake via aquaporins, depletes the available soil water much faster than the mutant plant.", "solution": "Water movement in plants is driven by gradients in water potential, from soil to root to leaf to atmosphere, with the ordering $\\psi_{\\text{soil}} > \\psi_{\\text{root}} > \\psi_{\\text{leaf}} > \\psi_{\\text{air}}$ (with more negative values toward the atmosphere). The volumetric water flux across membranes or tissues is proportional to the hydraulic conductance and the water potential difference. At the membrane scale, this is expressed as\n$$\nJ_{v} = L_{p} A \\left( \\Delta \\psi \\right),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic permeability, $A$ is area, and $\\Delta \\psi$ is the water potential difference across the membrane. At the organ/whole-plant scale, one can write\n$$\nJ = K_{\\text{plant}} \\left( \\psi_{\\text{soil}} - \\psi_{\\text{leaf}} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $K_{\\text{plant}}$ is the whole-plant hydraulic conductance. Aquaporins (notably PIPs) increase $L_{p}$ of cell membranes and thereby increase $K_{\\text{root}}$ and $K_{\\text{leaf}}$, contributing to a higher $K_{\\text{plant}}$.\n\nLeaf water status in the steady state is determined by the balance between supply and loss. The supply from the soil to the leaf is $J$, while the loss to the atmosphere via transpiration is\n$$\nE = g_{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{VPD},\n$$\nwhere $g_{s}$ is stomatal conductance and $\\mathrm{VPD}$ is the vapor pressure deficit. In quasi-steady conditions, maintenance of leaf hydration requires\n$$\nJ = E.\n$$\nIf aquaporin function is reduced (mutant), then $L_{p}$ decreases, which reduces $K_{\\text{plant}}$. For a given $\\psi_{\\text{soil}}$ and atmospheric demand (hence a given $E$ set by $g_{s}$ and $\\mathrm{VPD}$), a lower $K_{\\text{plant}}$ implies that to satisfy $J = K_{\\text{plant}}(\\psi_{\\text{soil}} - \\psi_{\\text{leaf}}) = E$, $\\psi_{\\text{leaf}}$ must become more negative to increase the driving force. The leaf water potential relates to solute and pressure components by\n$$\n\\psi_{\\text{leaf}} = \\psi_{s,\\text{leaf}} + P,\n$$\nwhere $\\psi_{s,\\text{leaf}}$ is the osmotic potential and $P$ is turgor pressure. As $\\psi_{\\text{leaf}}$ declines (more negative) without proportional osmotic adjustment, $P$ declines toward zero, causing loss of turgor (wilting). Thus, mutants with reduced aquaporin function fail to deliver water to the leaves quickly enough to replace transpired water, leading to faster turgor loss and greater wilting compared with wild type under the same drying period.\n\nEvaluate the options against these principles:\n- A is incorrect because the dominant water loss pathway under drying conditions is transpiration to the atmosphere, not net water efflux from roots back to the soil. Moreover, as long as transpiration continues, $\\psi_{\\text{leaf}}$ and xylem remain sufficiently negative that net flow is generally inward from soil; aquaporins do not primarily cause increased backflow to the soil.\n- B is correct: loss of PIP function lowers $L_{p}$ and $K_{\\text{plant}}$, restricting water transport from roots to leaves. For a given evaporative demand, this causes a rapid decline in $\\psi_{\\text{leaf}}$ and $P$, producing earlier and greater wilting.\n- C is misleading because while reduced membrane permeability could limit internal water movement, the primary control of water loss to the atmosphere is stomatal conductance, not membrane aquaporins. Lower $K_{\\text{plant}}$ does not inherently conserve water in leaves; instead, it impairs supply and promotes wilting unless stomata fully close preemptively.\n- D is incorrect because differences in $K_{\\text{plant}}$ remain physiologically consequential within 48 hours of withholding water; soil water potential is not universally near zero, and internal transport capacity still influences plant water status.\n- E is less accurate than B: although WT may support higher transpiration due to higher $K_{\\text{plant}}$, stomata dynamically regulate $g_{s}$ as soil dries. The more direct and robust consequence of aquaporin loss is impaired hydraulic supply leading to earlier turgor loss, not necessarily faster soil depletion by WT within this timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction and explanation are given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1692894"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the whole-plant consequences of faulty water transport, we now zoom into the cellular level to examine the precise function of aquaporins.

The second population consists of genetically engineered (GE) cells, which have been modified to significantly overexpress the same aquaporin protein, resulting in a much higher density of these water channels in their plasma membranes.\n\nInitially, both WT and GE cells are fully turgid and are in equilibrium with an isotonic solution.

Cell Type GE will undergo plasmolysis more rapidly than Cell Type WT, but both will eventually reach the same final state of plasmolysis.\n\nB. Cell Type WT will undergo plasmolysis more rapidly than Cell Type GE because the high protein density in the GE cell membrane hinders water movement.\n\nC. Both cell types will undergo plasmolysis at the same rate, as the rate is determined solely by the magnitude of the water potential gradient, which is the same for both.\n\nD.

The governing equation shows the time dependence scales with $L_{p}$.
