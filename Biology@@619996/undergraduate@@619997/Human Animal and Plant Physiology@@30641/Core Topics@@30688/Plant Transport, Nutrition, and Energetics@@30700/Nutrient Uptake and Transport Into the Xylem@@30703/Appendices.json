Plants often use secondary active transport, where the uptake of one substance, like nitrate ($NO_3^-$), is powered by the gradient of another, like protons ($H^+$), established by ATP-driven pumps. This problem provides a hypothetical scenario to explore the kinetics of this process, treating it with the Michaelis-Menten model and demonstrating how increasing the power source (the number of proton pumps) affects the overall rate of nutrient accumulation in the xylem [@problem_id:1723125].", "problem": "A plant physiologist is investigating nutrient transport in maize. The uptake of nitrate ($NO_3^-$) from the soil into the root epidermal cells is primarily mediated by a family of proton-nitrate symporters.

The overall process can be modeled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\n\nThe physiologist posits a model where the number of active $H^+$-ATPases determines the magnitude of the proton motive force, which in turn enhances the affinity of the symporters for nitrate. This effect is modeled by assuming the apparent Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of the nitrate transport system is inversely proportional to the number of active $H^+$-ATPases in the root epidermal membranes. The maximum transport rate ($V_{max}$) is determined by the number of symporter proteins, which is constant.\n\nThe physiologist compares a wild-type (WT) maize plant with a genetically engineered (GE) variant. The GE plant expresses exactly double the number of functional $H^+$-ATPases in its root epidermal membranes compared to the WT plant.
