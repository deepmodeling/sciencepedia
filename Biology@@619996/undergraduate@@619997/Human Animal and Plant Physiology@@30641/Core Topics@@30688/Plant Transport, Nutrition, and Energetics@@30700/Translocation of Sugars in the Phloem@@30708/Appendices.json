To trace the movement of photosynthates, the scientist selects a single, healthy, mature leaf located halfway up the plant's main stem. This leaf is enclosed in a transparent, sealed bag containing air enriched with radioactive carbon dioxide ($^{14}\\text{CO}_2$). The leaf is illuminated for several hours, allowing it to photosynthesize and incorporate the $^{14}\\text{C}$ into sugars. After this exposure period, the bag is removed, and the plant is left under normal conditions for 24 hours to allow for the transport of these newly synthesized sugars.\n\nBased on the principles of phloem transport and source-sink dynamics in plants, which of the following locations would be expected to show a significant accumulation of the radioactive $^{14}\\text{C}$ label after the 24-hour translocation period?\n\nSelect all valid options.\n\nA.

By phloem loading, the concentration of $S^{\\ast}$ in sieve elements at the source increases, raising solute concentration and lowering the solute component of water potential $\\Psi_{s}$.\n\nWater movement and pressure generation in the phloem follow the relation for water potential,\n$$\n\\Psi = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p},\n$$\nwhere $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure (turgor) potential. An increase in $[S^{\\ast}]$ at the source lowers $\\Psi_{s}$, thus lowering $\\Psi$, which drives water entry from adjacent xylem into the phloem, increasing $\\Psi_{p}$ at the source.\n\nAccording to the pressure-flow (Munch) hypothesis, bulk flow of phloem sap proceeds from high pressure at sources to low pressure at sinks. A simple constitutive relation for mass flow is\n$$\nJ = K\\left(P_{\\text{source}} - P_{\\text{sink}}\\right),\n$$\nwith $K$ the hydraulic conductance of the sieve-tube path and $P$ the turgor pressure.

In a potato simultaneously flowering and tuberizing, the following are strong sinks and thus expected to accumulate $^{14}\\text{C}$ after $24$ hours:\n- Actively growing underground tubers (storage sinks): strong demand for sucrose for starch deposition; expect significant $S^{\\ast}$ accumulation (B).\n- Apical meristem and young, unexpanded leaves (growth sinks): high import for cell division and expansion; expect significant accumulation (C).\n- Flowers at the top (reproductive sinks): developing floral tissues import photosynthate; expect accumulation (E).\n- Fine roots (growth and maintenance sinks): root tips and fine roots import carbon for growth and respiration; expect accumulation (A).\n\nBy contrast:\n- A different, untreated mature leaf is itself a source with net export rather than import; it is not a sink under normal conditions and thus would not show significant $^{14}\\text{C}$ accumulation (D excluded).\n- Lignified vessel elements of the xylem are dead cells and are not part of the phloem transport pathway for sucrose; sucrose is transported in sieve elements, not xylem vessels, so no accumulation is expected in xylem vessel elements (F excluded).\n\nBecause the labeled source leaf is located halfway up the stem, phloem transport can proceed both upward and downward within its vascular sector over the $24$ hour period, delivering $S^{\\ast}$ to both shoot and root/tuber sinks.

This practice uses a simple scenario to address a common misconception, highlighting why phloem transport is not a passive process like water movement in the xylem. Analyzing this experiment will clarify the critical role of active, regulated phloem loading in initiating the translocation stream [@problem_id:1727911].", "problem": "An undergraduate student conducting a plant physiology experiment takes a freshly cut celery stalk (which primarily consists of a petiole and some leaflets) and places its base in a beaker containing a concentrated, sterile sucrose solution. The experimental setup is left for several hours under standard laboratory conditions. Subsequent analysis of the tissues in the upper part of the leaflets reveals that, while water has moved up the xylem, the sucrose from the beaker has not been transported upwards through the phloem tissue. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate physiological explanation for this observation?\n\nA. Phloem loading is a highly regulated active transport process that requires specific cellular machinery and metabolic energy, which are primarily located in specialized source tissues (like mature leaves performing photosynthesis) and are not functional along the cut vascular bundles of the celery stalk.\n\nB. The sucrose solution is too viscous for the plant to transport. The cohesive and adhesive properties of water that drive transport are disrupted by the high solute concentration, preventing any bulk flow in the vascular tissues.\n\nC. The high external concentration of sucrose creates a strong negative water potential outside the phloem, causing water to move out of the sieve tubes and into the beaker, thereby generating a hydrostatic pressure that opposes any upward movement.\n\nD. Upward transport in the phloem is initiated by a pressure gradient established by active water uptake in the roots. Since the celery stalk is cut and lacks roots, this initial pressure pump is missing.\n\nE. The transport of sucrose into the phloem is a passive process driven by diffusion. The existing concentration of sugars within the phloem sap is already higher than that of the solution in the beaker, preventing a favorable diffusion gradient.", "solution": "We analyze the distinct transport mechanisms of xylem and phloem and the anatomical-physiological constraints imposed by cutting the stalk.\n\nStep 1: Explain why water still moves in the xylem of a cut stalk.\nThe ascent of xylem sap is driven by the cohesion-tension mechanism, which relies on transpiration at the leaf surfaces to generate a negative pressure potential in the xylem. This process is passive and can persist in a cut stem because xylem vessels are dead, lignified conduits that can maintain a continuous water column from the beaker to the leaves, provided that the leaves are transpiring. Thus, water can move upward through the xylem even without roots.\n\nStep 2: State what drives phloem translocation under normal conditions.\nAccording to the pressure-flow (Münch) hypothesis, phloem transport requires:\n- Active loading of sucrose at source tissues (typically mature photosynthetic leaves) into sieve elements via companion cells, often through proton-coupled sucrose symporters powered by a plasma membrane H^{+}-ATPase.\n- This loading decreases the solute potential in sieve elements, draws water osmotically from the xylem, increases hydrostatic pressure at the source, and drives bulk flow toward sinks along the sieve tube network.\n- Unloading occurs at sinks; transport direction is set by source-sink pressure differences, not by root-generated pressures.\n\nStep 3: Identify why sucrose in the beaker is not transported upward in the phloem of a cut stalk.\n- Specialized phloem-loading machinery (companion cells with H^{+}-ATPase and sucrose transporters, often localized to minor veins of source leaves) is not generally functional at a cut petiole base. Therefore, sucrose in the external beaker solution is not effectively taken up into sieve elements to initiate a source-like high-pressure region at the base.\n- Additionally, cutting phloem triggers rapid occlusion (P-protein plugging and callose deposition), which seals sieve plates to prevent sap loss and disrupts continuity, further preventing uptake and mass flow initiation from the cut end.\n- Consequently, although xylem can still conduct water upward, phloem does not load sucrose from the beaker nor establish the necessary pressure gradient for upward translocation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A: Correct. It accurately states that phloem loading is a regulated, energy-dependent process localized to specialized source tissues and not operative along cut vascular bundles; thus exogenous sucrose at the cut base is not loaded into phloem.\n- B: Incorrect. While viscosity affects flow, phloem sap is normally sucrose-rich and still flows; moreover, the limiting factor here is loading/continuity, not viscosity of an external solution.\n- C: Incorrect. The beaker’s external solution does not set phloem driving pressures in intact sieve tubes; any local water potential effect at the cut base would not generate a sustained opposing hydrostatic pressure that explains the absence of upward sucrose translocation.\n- D: Incorrect. Phloem pressure gradients arise from source loading, not from active water uptake in roots; root pressure is relevant to xylem, not the primary driver of phloem flow.\n- E: Incorrect. Phloem loading is not generally passive diffusion; in many species it is active apoplastic loading. The premise about diffusion gradients is also flawed in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physiological explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1727911"}, {"introduction": "The pressure-flow hypothesis posits that a pressure gradient, generated osmotically, drives sugar transport. This exercise provides a quantitative link between the metabolic activity in sink tissues and the physical forces within the phloem. By modeling the effect of a mutation that halts sugar unloading, you will calculate the direct impact on phloem turgor pressure, solidifying your understanding of the biophysical engine that powers translocation [@problem_id:1755060].", "problem": "A plant physiologist is studying a genetically engineered variety of sugar beet (*Beta vulgaris*) that has a massive storage root, which acts as a primary \"sink\" for sugars produced during photosynthesis in the leaves (the \"source\"). In a wild-type plant under optimal conditions, the sucrose concentration in the phloem sieve tubes at the source is maintained at $0.80$ M, while active unloading and metabolism in the sink keep the phloem sucrose concentration in the storage root at $0.30$ M.\n\nA new mutant is created in which the gene for the enzyme sucrose synthase is specifically and completely inactivated only within the parenchyma cells of the storage root. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of sucrose after it is unloaded from the phloem into the sink cells. All other physiological functions, including sucrose synthesis in the leaves and the integrity of the phloem transport system, remain normal. The inactivation of sucrose synthase in the sink leads to a halt in sucrose unloading from the phloem, causing a cessation of bulk flow. Over time, the system reaches a new steady state where the sucrose concentration within the phloem of the storage root equilibrates with the phloem at the source.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you may assume that the phloem turgor pressure ($P$) is generated osmotically and is directly proportional to the molar concentration of sucrose ($C$) according to the approximate relation $P = kC$, where $k$ is a constant that depends on temperature.
