This practice casts you as a metabolic accountant, tasked with quantifying the energy cost of sugar synthesis. By calculating the precise number of ATP and NADPH molecules consumed in the Calvin cycle to produce the building blocks for sucrose, you will gain a concrete understanding of the energetic coupling between the light-dependent and light-independent reactions. [@problem_id:1728821]", "problem": "In a mature leaf cell undergoing photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) occur in the chloroplast stroma. The primary carbohydrate product that is exported from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm is not glucose, but rather a three-carbon sugar phosphate called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). In the cytoplasm, these G3P molecules serve as the building blocks for synthesizing sucrose ($C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$), which is the principal sugar transported throughout the plant's vascular system. The synthesis of a single molecule of sucrose in the cytoplasm requires precursors that are metabolically equivalent to four net molecules of G3P produced by the Calvin cycle.\n\nAssuming the Calvin cycle is operating under standard conditions, calculate the total number of ATP molecules and the total number of NADPH molecules consumed *within the Calvin cycle* to generate the required amount of net G3P for the synthesis of one single molecule of sucrose.\n\nYour answer should consist of two integers: the total number of ATP molecules followed by the total number of NADPH molecules.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of ATP and NADPH molecules consumed by the Calvin cycle to produce the necessary precursors for one molecule of sucrose. We are given that the synthesis of one sucrose molecule requires four net molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Therefore, our goal is to first determine the energetic cost (in ATP and NADPH) for producing one net G3P molecule via the Calvin cycle, and then scale that cost for four molecules.\n\nLet's analyze the stoichiometry of the Calvin cycle. The cycle is best understood by considering the processing of 3 molecules of carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$), which leads to the net production of a single molecule of G3P. The cycle consists of three main phases:\n\n1.  **Carbon Fixation:**\n    Three molecules of $\\text{CO}_2$ react with three molecules of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), a five-carbon sugar. This reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO, produces six molecules of a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).\n    $$3 \\text{ } \\text{CO}_2 + 3 \\text{ } \\text{RuBP} \\rightarrow 6 \\text{ } \\text{3-PGA}$$\n    This phase does not consume ATP or NADPH.\n\n2.  **Reduction:**\n    The six molecules of 3-PGA are converted into six molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This is a two-step process:\n    First, each 3-PGA molecule is phosphorylated by ATP, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.\n    $$6 \\text{ } \\text{3-PGA} + 6 \\text{ } \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow 6 \\text{ } \\text{1,3-bisphosphoglycerate} + 6 \\text{ } \\text{ADP}$$\n    Second, each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate molecule is reduced by NADPH.\n    $$6 \\text{ } \\text{1,3-bisphosphoglycerate} + 6 \\text{ } \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 6 \\text{ } \\text{G3P} + 6 \\text{ } \\text{NADP}^{+} + 6 \\text{ } P_i$$\n    The total cost for the reduction phase is 6 ATP and 6 NADPH.\n\n3.  **Regeneration:**\n    Out of the six G3P molecules produced, only one is considered the net product of the cycle for this turn. The other five G3P molecules are used to regenerate the three molecules of RuBP that were initially consumed. This complex series of reactions requires the input of more ATP.\n    $$5 \\text{ } \\text{G3P} + 3 \\text{ } \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow 3 \\text{ } \\text{RuBP} + 3 \\text{ } \\text{ADP}$$\n    The regeneration phase costs 3 ATP.\n\n**Summary for one net G3P molecule:**\nTo produce one net molecule of G3P (from the fixation of 3 $\\text{CO}_2$ molecules), the Calvin cycle consumes:\n-   ATP: 6 ATP (from reduction) + 3 ATP (from regeneration) = 9 ATP\n-   NADPH: 6 NADPH (from reduction)\n\nSo, the net cost for producing 1 G3P is 9 ATP and 6 NADPH.\n\n**Calculation for one sucrose molecule:**\nThe problem states that the synthesis of one sucrose molecule requires four net molecules of G3P. We can now calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost per G3P by a factor of four.\n\nTotal ATP consumed = (ATP per net G3P) $\\times$ (number of net G3P molecules)\n$$ \\text{Total ATP} = 9 \\text{ ATP}/\\text{G3P} \\times 4 \\text{ G3P} = 36 \\text{ ATP} $$\n\nTotal NADPH consumed = (NADPH per net G3P) $\\times$ (number of net G3P molecules)\n$$ \\text{Total NADPH} = 6 \\text{ NADPH}/\\text{G3P} \\times 4 \\text{ G3P} = 24 \\text{ NADPH} $$\n\nThus, to produce the four net G3P molecules required for synthesizing one molecule of sucrose, the Calvin cycle must consume a total of 36 molecules of ATP and 24 molecules of NADPH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 36 & 24 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1728821"}, {"introduction": "The light-dependent reactions are a high-speed assembly line of electron transport, and scientists have clever ways to monitor it.

Chlorophyll fluorescence yield from Photosystem II (PSII) reflects how absorbed excitation energy is partitioned among photochemistry, fluorescence, and non-photochemical quenching (heat).

When PSII reaction centers are open (primary quinone acceptor $Q_{A}$ oxidized), $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{PSII}}$ is high and $\\Phi_{F}$ is low. When PSII reaction centers are closed (primary acceptor $Q_{A}$ reduced and unable to pass electrons forward), $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{PSII}} \\to 0$ and $\\Phi_{F}$ rises to a maximal level, producing a large and stable increase in fluorescence.\n\nBinding of an herbicide at the plastoquinone-binding site on the D1 protein that blocks electron transfer from $Q_{A}$ to $Q_{B}$ (the classic mechanism of PSII herbicides like DCMU/diuron) causes rapid accumulation of reduced $Q_{A}^{-}$, functionally closing PSII reaction centers. This eliminates photochemical quenching and drives fluorescence to a high, stable maximum, exactly matching the observation. Therefore, option B best fits.\n\nBy contrast:\n- A (inhibition of the oxygen-evolving complex manganese cluster) impairs water oxidation and leaves $P680^{+}$ more oxidized, tending to keep $Q_{A}$ oxidized (open centers), which would reduce fluorescence or prevent a maximal rise.\n- C (protonophore) collapses the proton gradient, which decreases $\\Phi_{NPQ}$ and could increase fluorescence modestly, but it simultaneously accelerates electron transport and tends to oxidize $Q_{A}$, often yielding a decrease or only a modest, not maximal, stable increase.\n- D (FNR inhibition) and E (PSI $P700$ inhibition) create acceptor-side limitations at PSI that can secondarily reduce the plastoquinone pool and close PSII, potentially increasing fluorescence. However, these effects are typically less immediate or characteristic and depend on stromal redox poise and alternative sinks; they are not as specific nor as rapidly maximal as the hallmark response to a $Q_{A} \\to Q_{B}$ block at PSII.\n\nTherefore, the most probable primary site of action is the PSII $Q_{B}$ site on the D1 protein, blocking electron transfer from $Q_{A}$ to $Q_{B}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1728855"}, {"introduction": "Photosynthesis is not a one-size-fits-all process; plants have evolved remarkable strategies to thrive in diverse environments.
