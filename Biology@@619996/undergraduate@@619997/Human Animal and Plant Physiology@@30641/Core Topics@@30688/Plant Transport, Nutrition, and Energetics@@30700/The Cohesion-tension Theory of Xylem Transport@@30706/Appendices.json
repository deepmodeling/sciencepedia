It constitutes a standard problem in the physics of fluid transport in biological systems. We will therefore proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\nThe problem asks us to derive the expression for the maximum capillary rise height, $h$, in a cylindrical pore of radius $r$. This is determined by the balance between the upward force due to surface tension and the downward force due to the weight of the liquid column at static equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we will formulate the upward force, $F_{\\text{up}}$. The problem states that surface tension, $\\gamma$, exerts a force per unit length along the three-phase contact line. For a cylindrical pore of radius $r$, this contact line is a circle with circumference $L = 2\\pi r$. The force acts tangentially to the liquid surface at the wall, with a contact angle $\\theta$. The vertical component of this force per unit length is given as $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$. Therefore, the total upward force is the product of this vertical component and the length of the contact line:\n$$F_{\\text{up}} = (2\\pi r) (\\gamma \\cos\\theta)$$\n\nNext, we formulate the downward force, $F_{\\text{down}}$, which is the weight of the liquid column. The problem instructs us to consider the volume of a cylinder of height $h$ and radius $r$. The volume, $V$, is:\n$$V = \\pi r^2 h$$\nThis approximation is valid as it neglects the small volume of the meniscus, which is reasonable when $h \\gg r$. The mass, $m$, of this fluid column is the product of its density, $\\rho$, and its volume, $V$:\n$$m = \\rho V = \\rho (\\pi r^2 h)$$\nThe weight of the column, $W$, which constitutes the downward force, is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$:\n$$F_{\\text{down}} = W = m g = \\rho g \\pi r^2 h$$\n\nAt static equilibrium, the upward and downward forces must be equal:\n$$F_{\\text{up}} = F_{\\text{down}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces, we get:\n$$2\\pi r \\gamma \\cos\\theta = \\rho g \\pi r^2 h$$\nWe can now solve for the height, $h$.

The calculated radius of $0.147\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is significantly smaller than what is observed in the main conducting elements of the xylem. According to the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, the hydraulic conductance of a cylindrical tube is proportional to the fourth power of its radius ($r^4$). A conduit with such a minuscule radius would impose an exceedingly high resistance to water flow, rendering it ineffective for transporting the large volumes of water required by a tall tree. Consequently, while capillarity contributes to water adhesion and cohesion within the xylem, it is quantitatively insufficient to be the primary mechanism for lifting water to heights of $100\\,\\mathrm{m}$.
