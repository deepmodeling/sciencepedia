This exercise challenges you to calculate the cycle's energy budget—the specific amounts of ATP and NADPH—required to synthesize a six-carbon sugar. Mastering this calculation is a crucial first step, as it provides the quantitative foundation for appreciating the cycle's efficiency and its energetic demands on the light-dependent reactions [@problem_id:1748792].", "problem": "The Calvin cycle is a crucial metabolic pathway in photosynthetic organisms for the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide ($CO_2$). The cycle utilizes energy carriers generated during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, namely Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and the reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH), to synthesize carbohydrates. The cycle can be conceptually divided into three phases: carboxylation, reduction, and regeneration.\n\nIn the carboxylation phase, $CO_2$ is incorporated into an organic molecule. In the reduction phase, this molecule is converted into Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon sugar phosphate. Some of the G3P produced is exported from the cycle to be used in other metabolic pathways, such as the synthesis of sucrose or starch. In the regeneration phase, the remaining G3P is used to regenerate the initial $CO_2$ acceptor molecule, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP).\n\nAssuming the Calvin cycle operates with perfect efficiency and no side reactions like photorespiration occur, calculate the total number of ATP molecules and the total number of NADPH molecules consumed within the stroma of the chloroplast to achieve the net synthesis of a single molecule of a hexose phosphate (a six-carbon sugar), which is subsequently exported for cellular use.\n\nPresent your answer as a pair of integers in a row matrix.
