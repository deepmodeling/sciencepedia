This procedure eliminates the body's primary source of the endocrine hormones insulin and glucagon. Assuming no hormonal replacement therapy is initiated, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and primary metabolic consequences for this patient, particularly concerning glucose and fat metabolism?\n\nA. The patient would experience severe hypoglycemia (abnormally low blood glucose) and a suppression of fat breakdown, as the body attempts to conserve energy.\n\nB. Blood glucose levels would remain relatively stable, as the removal of the glucose-lowering hormone (insulin) is balanced by the removal of the glucose-raising hormone (glucagon). Fat storage in adipose tissue would increase.\n\nC. The patient would develop severe hyperglycemia (abnormally high blood glucose), but the production of ketone bodies would decrease because glucagon, a hormone that stimulates their formation, is absent.\n\nD. The patient would develop severe hyperglycemia, and the rate of fat breakdown in adipose tissue would increase dramatically, leading to a rapid and severe accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood (ketoacidosis).\n\nE. The patient would experience mild hyperglycemia, but fat metabolism would remain largely unaffected in the immediate period following the surgery.", "solution": "We identify the key endocrine controls of glucose and fat metabolism.\n\n1) Normal insulin actions:\n- Insulin lowers blood glucose by increasing peripheral uptake (muscle and adipose), increasing glycogenesis, and inhibiting hepatic glucose output.\n- Insulin suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis by inhibiting hormone-sensitive lipase, thereby decreasing plasma free fatty acids (FFA).\n- Insulin is strongly anti-ketogenic; it suppresses hepatic ketone body production.\n\nSymbolically: loss of insulin implies\n$$\\text{peripheral glucose uptake} \\downarrow,\\quad \\text{hepatic glucose production not suppressed},\\quad \\text{lipolysis} \\uparrow,\\quad \\text{ketogenesis inhibition removed}.$$\n\n2) Normal glucagon actions:\n- Glucagon raises blood glucose by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.\n- Glucagon promotes hepatic ketogenesis.\n\nSymbolically: loss of glucagon implies\n$$\\text{hepatic glycogenolysis} \\downarrow,\\quad \\text{gluconeogenesis} \\downarrow,\\quad \\text{ketogenesis drive} \\downarrow.$$\n\n3) Net effect after total pancreatectomy (no insulin, no glucagon), without replacement therapy:\n- On glucose: The absence of insulin eliminates the primary mechanism for glucose disposal and the restraint on hepatic glucose output. Although glucagon is absent (reducing one counterregulatory driver), other counterregulatory hormones (epinephrine, cortisol, growth hormone) remain and continue to stimulate hepatic glucose production and insulin antagonism. The dominant effect is severe hyperglycemia due to absent insulin.\nFormally,\n$$\\text{net effect on glucose}:~(\\text{loss of insulin}) \\gg (\\text{loss of glucagon}) \\implies \\text{hyperglycemia}.$$\n\n- On fat and ketones: The absence of insulin removes strong inhibition of adipose lipolysis, so FFA release increases markedly, driven further by catecholamines. The increased FFA flux to the liver, combined with the removal of insulin’s anti-ketogenic effect, results in accelerated hepatic ketogenesis. Although glucagon enhances ketogenesis, its absence does not prevent ketone body formation when insulin is absent and catecholamines are active; the anti-ketogenic “brake” (insulin) is the dominant control.

This practice moves from the systemic effects of insulin to its very synthesis, exploring what happens when the final step of its production—the cleavage of the proinsulin precursor—fails. This exercise highlights the critical importance of post-translational processing and demonstrates how a single molecular defect can lead to a condition mimicking a complete lack of the hormone. [@problem_id:1725961]", "problem": "In healthy individuals, pancreatic beta cells first synthesize a precursor molecule called proinsulin. In the secretory granules of these cells, proinsulin is cleaved by specific enzymes into two products: the biologically active hormone insulin and a smaller fragment called C-peptide. Insulin is essential for regulating blood glucose homeostasis; it promotes the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder that results in the complete loss-of-function of the proconvertase enzymes responsible for cleaving proinsulin. As a result, the patient's pancreatic beta cells secrete unprocessed proinsulin into the bloodstream instead of mature insulin.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately represents the primary metabolic consequence for this patient?\n\nA. Chronic hypoglycemia, due to the accumulation of an insulin-like molecule in the blood.\n\nB. Severe hyperglycemia, with clinical symptoms resembling Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\nC. Normal blood glucose levels, but with a complete absence of measurable C-peptide in the blood.\n\nD. A metabolic state resembling Type 2 diabetes mellitus, characterized by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues.\n\nE. A significant and sustained increase in the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha cells.", "solution": "Proinsulin is processed within beta-cell secretory granules by prohormone convertases (notably PC1/3 and PC2) and carboxypeptidase to yield two products in equimolar amounts: mature insulin and C-peptide. Symbolically, the processing is:\n$$\\text{proinsulin} \\to \\text{insulin} + \\text{C-peptide}.$$\nA complete loss-of-function of the proconvertases prevents this cleavage, so the beta cells secrete intact proinsulin. Consequently:\n- Mature insulin is not produced, so circulating insulin activity is severely reduced.\n- C-peptide is absent, because it is only generated by proinsulin cleavage.\n- Proinsulin has very low bioactivity at the insulin receptor relative to insulin (markedly reduced receptor affinity and signaling), so it does not compensate for the absence of insulin.\n\nWith effectively absent insulin action, the metabolic state mirrors absolute insulin deficiency:\n- In liver, decreased insulin action removes inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, increasing hepatic glucose output.\n- In muscle and adipose tissue, failure of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation reduces glucose uptake.\n- Lipolysis and proteolysis increase, and ketogenesis may ensue.\nThese changes produce severe hyperglycemia with clinical features akin to Type 1 diabetes mellitus. \n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: proinsulin’s weak activity does not produce hypoglycemia; the net effect is insulin deficiency with hyperglycemia.\n- B is correct: the phenotype is severe hyperglycemia resembling Type 1 diabetes mellitus due to absolute insulin deficiency.\n- C is incorrect: C-peptide would be absent, but blood glucose would not be normal; it would be elevated.\n- D is incorrect: the problem is not insulin resistance but lack of insulin action.\n- E is not the primary metabolic consequence; although intra-islet insulin deficiency can disinhibit glucagon, the defining systemic effect is hyperglycemia from insulin deficiency.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is severe hyperglycemia with features similar to Type 1 diabetes mellitus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1725961"}, {"introduction": "Effective biological signaling requires not only a potent \"on\" signal but also a precise and timely \"off\" signal. This final practice shifts our focus to the termination of insulin's action through enzymatic degradation. You are asked to predict the dynamic consequences of a faulty clearance mechanism, encouraging you to think about hormone concentrations not as static levels, but as kinetic profiles that are crucial for preventing over-stimulation and maintaining metabolic stability. [@problem_id:1725950]", "problem": "The homeostatic regulation of blood glucose is a critical physiological process orchestrated primarily by pancreatic hormones. After a meal, rising blood glucose stimulates the secretion of insulin, which promotes glucose uptake by peripheral tissues, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. The termination of the insulin signal is equally important and is achieved through its clearance and degradation. A key enzyme in this process is the Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE), a metalloprotease responsible for a significant fraction of insulin catabolism in the body.\n\nConsider a hypothetical individual who is homozygous for a genetic loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding IDE. This mutation leads to a 90% reduction in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This individual undergoes a standard oral glucose tolerance test, where their plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are monitored over several hours after ingesting a glucose solution.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected kinetic profiles of plasma insulin and plasma glucose in this individual compared to a healthy subject with normal IDE function undergoing the same test?\n\nA. The subject will exhibit a significantly lower peak plasma insulin concentration and a blunted glucose response, resulting in prolonged hyperglycemia.\n\nB. The subject will show a normal plasma insulin profile, but a blunted glucose response due to insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia.\n\nC. The subject will exhibit a plasma insulin concentration that reaches a higher peak and remains elevated for a longer duration, leading to a more rapid and profound drop in plasma glucose that may result in hypoglycemia.\n\nD. The subject's plasma insulin and plasma glucose will both rise to higher peaks and remain elevated for a longer duration compared to a normal individual.\n\nE. The mutation will cause a paradoxical decrease in insulin secretion, leading to low plasma insulin levels and severe postprandial hyperglycemia.", "solution": "Let $G(t)$ denote plasma glucose concentration and $I(t)$ denote plasma insulin concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test. Let $R_{\\mathrm{abs}}(t)$ denote the rate of appearance of glucose from the gut, $U_{\\mathrm{basal}}$ the insulin-independent glucose utilization, and $U_{\\mathrm{ins}}(I,G)$ the insulin-dependent glucose disposal, which is strictly increasing in $I$ for fixed $G$. Let $S(G)$ denote pancreatic insulin secretion, which is strictly increasing in $G$ over the relevant range. Let $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ denote the first-order insulin clearance constant, which includes the contribution of the insulin-degrading enzyme.\n\nThe standard compartmental dynamics can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dt}=R_{\\mathrm{abs}}(t)-U_{\\mathrm{basal}}-U_{\\mathrm{ins}}(I,G),\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt}=S(G)-k_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\,I.\n$$\n\nIn the loss-of-function insulin-degrading enzyme mutation, catalytic activity is reduced by nine-tenths, so the IDE-mediated component of $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is reduced to a factor of $\\frac{1}{10}$ of normal. Writing $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}=k_{\\mathrm{IDE}}+k_{\\mathrm{non}}$ in the normal subject and $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{\\ast}=\\frac{1}{10}k_{\\mathrm{IDE}}+k_{\\mathrm{non}}$ in the mutant, we have $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{\\ast}<k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$.\n\nFor a given secretion input $S(G(t))$, the solution of the linear insulin kinetics is\n$$\nI(t)=\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{cl}} t)\\Big(I(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\tau)\\,S(G(\\tau))\\,d\\tau\\Big).\n$$\nFor the mutant,\n$$\nI^{\\ast}(t)=\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{\\ast} t)\\Big(I^{\\ast}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{\\ast}\\tau)\\,S(G^{\\ast}(\\tau))\\,d\\tau\\Big),\n$$\nwith $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{\\ast}<k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. If one compares responses to the same secretion drive $S(\\cdot)$, the mapping $S\\mapsto I$ is a stable linear filter whose gain and time constant both increase as $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ decreases. Specifically, for any nonnegative input $S$, decreasing $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ increases both the peak and the duration of $I(t)$: the exponential kernel $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{cl}}(t-\\tau))$ decays more slowly, increasing the convolution integral. Thus, for the same $S(G(t))$, $I^{\\ast}(t)>I(t)$ for $t>0$ and $I^{\\ast}$ decays more slowly.\n\nCoupling back to glucose, initially $G^{\\ast}(t)$ and $G(t)$ rise similarly from $R_{\\mathrm{abs}}(t)$ because $I$ has not yet exerted a strong effect. As $I^{\\ast}(t)$ exceeds $I(t)$ due to reduced clearance, and $U_{\\mathrm{ins}}$ is increasing in $I$, we have\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{ins}}(I^{\\ast}(t),G^{\\ast}(t))>U_{\\mathrm{ins}}(I(t),G(t))\n$$\nfor comparable $G$, which makes\n$$\n\\frac{dG^{\\ast}}{dt}<\\frac{dG}{dt}\n$$\nonce the insulin effect manifests. Consequently, glucose in the mutant falls more rapidly and to a lower nadir; the prolonged elevation of $I^{\\ast}(t)$ due to smaller $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{\\ast}$ sustains enhanced disposal, increasing the risk of undershoot (hypoglycemia). Meanwhile, the reduced clearance makes the insulin concentration reach a higher peak and remain elevated longer, even accounting for any feedback reduction of secretion as glucose declines, because the clearance bottleneck dominates the temporal profile.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because reduced degradation raises, not lowers, plasma insulin, and would not cause a blunted insulin effect; prolonged hyperglycemia is unlikely with higher insulin action.\n- B is incorrect because the mutation affects clearance, not insulin sensitivity; the insulin profile will not be normal, and insulin resistance is not implied.\n- C is consistent with the analysis: decreased clearance yields a higher and more prolonged insulin profile, which drives a faster and deeper glucose decline that can lead to hypoglycemia.\n- D is incorrect because although insulin is higher and prolonged, glucose should not rise to a higher and prolonged peak; it should fall faster due to stronger insulin action.\n- E is incorrect because the mutation does not directly suppress secretion; it reduces degradation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1725950"}]}
