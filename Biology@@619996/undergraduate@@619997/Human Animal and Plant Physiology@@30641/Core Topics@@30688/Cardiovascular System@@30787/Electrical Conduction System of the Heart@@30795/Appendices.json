Its primary mechanism of action has been identified as the selective blockage of slow, L-type voltage-gated calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) channels located on the sarcolemma of ventricular contractile myocytes. Assuming the drug has no other significant effects on other ion channels or pumps, which of the following describes the most direct and immediate effect of administering Cardiostatin on the action potential waveform of a single ventricular contractile cell?\n\nA. It would prolong the duration of the plateau phase (Phase 2).\n\nB. It would increase the rate of rapid depolarization (Phase 0).\n\nC.
