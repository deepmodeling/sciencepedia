This first practice focuses on calculating Stroke Volume ($SV$), Ejection Fraction ($EF$), and ultimately Cardiac Output ($CO$) from direct measurements of the heart's filling and emptying volumes. Mastering these foundational calculations [@problem_id:1697170] is the essential first step in quantifying and assessing cardiac function in both healthy and pathological states.", "problem": "An exercise physiologist is assessing the cardiac performance of a highly trained endurance athlete during a maximal exertion stress test on a treadmill. Using non-invasive imaging techniques, the following measurements are taken for the athlete's left ventricle at peak exercise: the End-Diastolic Volume (EDV), which is the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of filling, is measured to be 165 mL. The End-Systolic Volume (ESV), the volume of blood remaining in the ventricle after contraction, is 45 mL. The athlete's heart rate is recorded as 185 beats per minute.\n\nCalculate the following three performance metrics:\n1. The Stroke Volume in mL.\n2. The Ejection Fraction, expressed as a decimal.\n3. The Cardiac Output in L/min.\n\nProvide the three numerical values in the order listed above. Round each value to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of three key cardiac metrics: Stroke Volume (SV), Ejection Fraction (EF), and Cardiac Output (CO), based on the provided physiological data.\n\nFirst, let's define the given parameters:\nEnd-Diastolic Volume, $EDV = 165 \\text{ mL}$\nEnd-Systolic Volume, $ESV = 45 \\text{ mL}$\nHeart Rate, $HR = 185 \\text{ beats/min}$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Stroke Volume (SV)**\nThe Stroke Volume is the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat. It is calculated as the difference between the End-Diastolic Volume and the End-Systolic Volume.\n\nThe formula for Stroke Volume is:\n$$ SV = EDV - ESV $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ SV = 165 \\text{ mL} - 45 \\text{ mL} = 120 \\text{ mL} $$\nThe value 120 has three significant figures (the trailing zero is significant in this context of subtraction from numbers with three significant figures). So, $SV = 120 \\text{ mL}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ejection Fraction (EF)**\nThe Ejection Fraction is the fraction (or percentage) of blood from the End-Diastolic Volume that is ejected from the ventricle during each contraction. It is a key indicator of cardiac efficiency.\n\nThe formula for Ejection Fraction is:\n$$ EF = \\frac{SV}{EDV} $$\n\nUsing the calculated Stroke Volume from Step 1 and the given End-Diastolic Volume:\n$$ EF = \\frac{120 \\text{ mL}}{165 \\text{ mL}} $$\n$$ EF \\approx 0.727272... $$\nThe problem asks to round the answer to three significant figures.\n$$ EF \\approx 0.727 $$\nThe Ejection Fraction is a dimensionless quantity, expressed here as a decimal as requested.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Cardiac Output (CO)**\nCardiac Output is the total volume of blood pumped by the ventricle per unit of time, typically per minute. It is the product of the Heart Rate and the Stroke Volume.\n\nThe formula for Cardiac Output is:\n$$ CO = HR \\times SV $$\n\nSubstituting the given Heart Rate and the calculated Stroke Volume:\n$$ CO = 185 \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{min}} \\times 120 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{beat}} $$\n$$ CO = 22200 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in liters per minute (L/min). We use the conversion factor $1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\text{ mL}$.\n$$ CO = 22200 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ mL}} = 22.2 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} $$\nThe value 22.2 is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThe three requested values, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n1. Stroke Volume: $120 \\text{ mL}$\n2. Ejection Fraction: $0.727$\n3.

A positive chronotropic effect, which leads to an increase in the patient's heart rate by 25.0%.\n2.  A negative inotropic effect, which leads to a decrease in the force of ventricular contraction, resulting in a 30.0% reduction in the patient's stroke volume.\n\nAssuming these are the only effects of the drug, calculate the patient's new cardiac output after the drug has taken full effect.
