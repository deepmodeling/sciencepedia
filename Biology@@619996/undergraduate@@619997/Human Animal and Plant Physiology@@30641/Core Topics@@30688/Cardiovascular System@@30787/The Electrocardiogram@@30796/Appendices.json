A core function of this device is to calculate heart rate in real-time. The device records an Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a measurement of the heart's electrical activity. On a standard ECG trace, the most prominent feature of each cardiac cycle is the \"R wave,\" a sharp upward spike. The time interval between two consecutive R waves is known as the R-R interval. This interval corresponds to the duration of a single heartbeat.\n\nThe device's sensor measures the R-R interval with high precision, providing a value, $T_{\\text{ms}}$, in units of milliseconds. Your task is to provide the general analytical formula for the heart rate, expressed in units of beats per minute (BPM), as a function of the measured R-R interval, $T_{\\text{ms}}$.", "solution": "Heart rate is defined as the number of cardiac cycles per unit time.
