These mechanoreceptors are located in the walls of the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch, and they respond to the stretching of blood vessel walls caused by changes in blood pressure.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the response of baroreceptors in the carotid sinus of a healthy adult at rest. The individual has an initial Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) of $P_0 = 95$ mmHg, and at this pressure, their baroreceptors fire at a baseline rate of $f_0 = 80$ Hz. Assume that for MAP values between 60 mmHg and 120 mmHg, the firing rate of these baroreceptors changes linearly with pressure. The sensitivity of these receptors, $S$, is defined as the change in firing rate per unit change in pressure, and for this individual, it is constant at $S = 2.5$ Hz/mmHg.\n\nThis person then experiences a sudden, significant hemorrhage, which causes their MAP to drop to a new, lower value of $P_f = 65$ mmHg. Calculate the new, instantaneous firing rate of the baroreceptors immediately after the pressure drop occurs. You should consider only this initial response, before any compensatory feedback mechanisms from the central nervous system have had time to alter cardiovascular parameters.\n\nExpress your answer in Hz, rounded to the nearest integer.", "solution": "The sensitivity is defined as the constant slope of firing rate versus pressure, so by definition $S = \\frac{df}{dP}$ with $S$ constant over the specified range. Integrating with respect to $P$ gives a linear relation\n$$\nf(P)=SP + C,\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an integration constant. Using the baseline condition at $P_0$, namely $f(P_0)=f_0$, we solve for $C$:\n$$\nf_0 = SP_0 + C \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; C = f_0 - SP_0.\n$$\nThus the firing rate at any pressure $P$ in the linear range is\n$$\nf(P) = f_0 + S(P-P_0).\n$$\nEvaluating at the new pressure $P_f$,\n$$\nf(P_f) = f_0 + S(P_f - P_0).\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values for this required numerical result,\n$$\nP_f - P_0 = 65 - 95 = -30,\n$$\n$$\nS(P_f - P_0) = 2.5 \\times (-30) = -75,\n$$\n$$\nf(P_f) = 80 + (-75) = 5.\n$$\nRounding to the nearest integer leaves $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1737771"}, {"introduction": "This problem explores the complex interplay between heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$) in determining cardiac output ($CO$).

Before administration, the individual has a heart rate ($HR$) of 75 beats per minute and a stroke volume ($SV$), the volume of blood pumped from a ventricle per beat, of 70.0 mL/beat. The individual's total peripheral resistance ($TPR$), a measure of the total resistance to blood flow by the entire systemic circulation, is 20.0 mmHgâ‹…min/L.\n\nThe relationship between these variables is given by the following equations:\n1.  Cardiac Output ($CO$) = $HR \\times SV$. Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute.\n2.  Mean Arterial Pressure ($MAP$) = $CO \\times TPR$. Mean arterial pressure is the average arterial pressure during a single cardiac cycle.\n\nAfter administering the drug, the heart rate stabilizes at a new value of 185 beats per minute. The drug has no direct effect on the vasculature, so the total peripheral resistance remains unchanged. However, such a high heart rate significantly reduces the time available for ventricular filling between beats. This leads to a reduction in stroke volume according to the following model: for every 10 beats per minute increase in heart rate above a threshold of 100 beats per minute, the stroke volume decreases from its initial value by 4.0%.\n\nCalculate the percentage change in the mean arterial pressure from its initial value to its new stabilized value after the drug's effect.
