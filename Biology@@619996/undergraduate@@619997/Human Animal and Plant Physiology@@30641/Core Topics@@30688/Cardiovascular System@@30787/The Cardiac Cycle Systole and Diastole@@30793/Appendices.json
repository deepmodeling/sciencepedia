Echocardiography reveals that the volume of blood in the left ventricle at the end of its filling phase (diastole), known as the End-Diastolic Volume (EDV), is 135 mL. The volume of blood remaining in the same ventricle immediately after it contracts (systole), referred to as the End-Systolic Volume (ESV), is measured to be 60 mL. A separate diagnostic tool measures the total volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle over a one-minute interval, a quantity called the Cardiac Output (CO).

This practice explores the elegant pressure-volume ($P-V$) relationship, a powerful framework for analyzing ventricular function that separates the intrinsic contractility of the heart from external factors. By modeling how an inotropic drug alters the heart's end-systolic elastance ($E_{es}$), you will calculate the resulting change in stroke work, gaining insight into the very mechanics of cardiac contractility [@problem_id:1749093].", "problem": "A cardiovascular research team is evaluating a new inotropic drug designed to treat forms of heart failure characterized by reduced contractility. They model the performance of a patient's left ventricle using a simplified pressure-volume framework.\n\nThe model is defined by the following relationships:\n1.  The End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (ESPVR), which describes the maximum pressure ($P_{es}$) the ventricle can generate at a given end-systolic volume ($V_{es}$), is modeled by the linear equation: $P_{es} = E_{es}(V_{es} - V_d)$. Here, $E_{es}$ is the chamber's end-systolic elastance (a measure of contractility), and $V_d$ is a constant volume offset.\n2.  The properties of the arterial system (the afterload) are modeled by an effective arterial elastance line: $P_{es} = -E_a(V_{es} - V_{ed}) + P_{ed}$. Here, $E_a$ is the effective arterial elastance, $V_{ed}$ is the end-diastolic volume (a measure of preload), and $P_{ed}$ is the end-diastolic pressure. The intersection of these two lines determines the ventricle's operating point $(V_{es}, P_{es})$.\n3.
