In the ethylene pathway, the EIN3 protein acts as this master switch. This first practice invites you to consider what happens if this switch gets stuck in the \"on\" position, providing a clear and direct view of the physiological changes ethylene commands within a developing plant. By examining this hypothetical scenario, you'll gain a fundamental understanding of how protein stability is a critical control point in signaling and see the classic \"triple response\" that has been so instrumental in ethylene research. [@problem_id:1733094]", "problem": "In the signaling pathway for the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, the presence of the hormone leads to the stabilization of a key transcription factor called ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3). Once stabilized, EIN3 accumulates in the nucleus and activates the transcription of ethylene-responsive genes. In the absence of ethylene, a different signaling state causes EIN3 to be rapidly targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome, thus ensuring that the ethylene-responsive genes remain unexpressed.\n\nA well-characterized ethylene response in dark-grown seedlings is the \"triple response,\" which consists of three distinct morphological changes: (1) inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, (2) inhibition of root elongation, and (3) radial swelling of the hypocotyl, which makes it appear short and thick. A wild-type seedling grown in the dark without ethylene does not show this response and instead becomes etiolated, developing a long, thin hypocotyl and root system to seek light.\n\nConsider a novel mutant line of Arabidopsis in which a specific mutation has occurred in the gene encoding the EIN3 protein. This mutation completely blocks the ability of the proteasome to recognize and degrade the EIN3 protein, but it has no effect on EIN3's ability to act as a transcription factor. If a seed from this mutant line is germinated and grown for several days in complete darkness on a sterile growth medium devoid of any external ethylene, which of the following phenotypes is most likely to be observed?\n\nA. The seedling will exhibit a short, thick hypocotyl, a short root, and an exaggerated apical hook.\n\nB. The seedling will be indistinguishable from a wild-type seedling grown under the same conditions, displaying a long, thin hypocotyl.\n\nC. The seedling will appear as a wild-type seedling, and it will fail to exhibit the triple response even if ethylene is later added to the growth medium.\n\nD. The seedling will display a phenotype of extreme etiolation, with a hypocotyl that is significantly longer and thinner than a wild-type seedling.\n\nE. The seedling will fail to germinate, as a constant ethylene signal is lethal during embryogenesis.", "solution": "Principle of the pathway:\n- In the ethylene pathway, ethylene presence leads to stabilization and nuclear accumulation of EIN3, which activates transcription of ethylene-responsive genes. This activation in dark-grown seedlings produces the triple response: (1) inhibited hypocotyl elongation, (2) inhibited root elongation, and (3) radial swelling of the hypocotyl with an exaggerated apical hook.\n- In the absence of ethylene, the default signaling state targets EIN3 for rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome, preventing expression of ethylene-responsive genes and resulting in etiolation (long, thin hypocotyl and root).\n\nEffect of the mutation described:\n- The mutation blocks recognition and degradation of EIN3 by the 26S proteasome while preserving EIN3â€™s transcription factor function.\n- Therefore, even without ethylene, EIN3 cannot be degraded and will accumulate in the nucleus.\n- Accumulated, functional EIN3 will constitutively activate ethylene-responsive gene expression.\n\nPredicted phenotype in darkness without external ethylene:\n- Constitutive activation of ethylene-responsive genes in the dark produces the triple response regardless of ethylene presence.\n- Thus, the seedling will show a short, thick hypocotyl, a short root, and an exaggerated apical hook.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the constitutive ethylene response (triple response) expected from stabilized, functional EIN3.\n- B describes the wild-type no-ethylene phenotype (etiolation), which is not expected here due to constitutive EIN3 stabilization.\n- C incorrectly predicts a failure to respond even with ethylene; that would require loss of EIN3 function, which is not the case.\n- D describes exaggerated etiolation, the opposite of constitutive ethylene signaling.\n- E is incorrect; constitutive ethylene signaling is not lethal during embryogenesis, as evidenced by viable constitutive ethylene response mutants.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1733094"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of the pathway's final output, we now move to the challenge of diagnostics. Plant biologists often work like detectives, inferring the molecular cause from a visible effect, or phenotype. This problem presents you with a \"never-ripe\" tomato, a classic ethylene-insensitive phenotype, and asks you to trace the signal back through the pathway to identify the broken component. This exercise will sharpen your analytical skills, forcing you to logically dissect the roles of positive and negative regulators in a signal transduction cascade, a foundational concept in cellular biology. [@problem_id:1733110]", "problem": "In an agricultural biotechnology project, a new line of tomato plants is genetically engineered. These plants produce fruits that exhibit a \"never-ripe\" phenotype; they grow to full size but fail to soften, change color, or develop characteristic flavors. Crucially, these tomatoes remain unripe even when exposed to high atmospheric concentrations of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone known to be the primary trigger for ripening in normal tomatoes.\n\nTo understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, consider the following simplified model of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in a normal plant cell:\n\n1.  In the absence of ethylene, membrane-bound receptors activate a protein kinase known as CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1 (CTR1).\n2.  Active CTR1 acts as a negative regulator by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating a key signaling protein called ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2), which is tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n3.  When ethylene gas binds to its receptors, the receptor-CTR1 complex is inactivated.\n4.  Consequently, CTR1 no longer phosphorylates EIN2. The now de-phosphorylated (active) EIN2 undergoes cleavage, and its C-terminal fragment translocates to the nucleus.\n5.  In the nucleus, the EIN2 fragment promotes the activity of transcription factors, such as ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3), by protecting them from degradation. These active transcription factors then turn on a cascade of genes required for the ripening process.\n\nAssuming the \"never-ripe\" phenotype in the engineered tomatoes is caused by a single loss-of-function mutation that renders one of the following protein components completely non-functional, which component is the most likely target of the mutation?\n\nA. The ethylene receptor\n\nB. The CTR1 kinase\n\nC. The EIN2 protein\n\nD. The protease responsible for degrading the EIN3 transcription factor", "solution": "Begin by restating the causal sequence in a normal cell.\n\nIn the absence of ethylene:\n- Receptors are active and activate CTR1. Symbolically:\n$$R_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow CTR1_{\\text{active}}.$$\n- Active CTR1 phosphorylates EIN2, keeping it inactive:\n$$CTR1_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow \\text{P-}EIN2 \\equiv EIN2_{\\text{inactive}}.$$\n- Inactive EIN2 cannot promote EIN3 stabilization, so ripening genes are not expressed:\n$$EIN2_{\\text{inactive}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ degraded} \\Rightarrow \\text{no ripening}.$$\n\nIn the presence of ethylene:\n- Ethylene binding inactivates the receptor-CTR1 complex:\n$$\\text{ethylene bound } R \\Rightarrow CTR1_{\\text{inactive}}.$$\n- CTR1 no longer phosphorylates EIN2; EIN2 becomes dephosphorylated and active, gets cleaved, and its C-terminus moves to the nucleus:\n$$CTR1_{\\text{inactive}} \\Rightarrow EIN2_{\\text{deP, active}} \\Rightarrow \\text{EIN2-C to nucleus}.$$\n- Nuclear EIN2 fragment stabilizes EIN3 (by preventing its degradation), allowing activation of ripening genes:\n$$EIN2_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ stabilized} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening gene expression} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening}.$$\n\nNow evaluate the effect of a complete loss-of-function in each component:\n\nA.

Thus B is inconsistent.\n\nC. EIN2 protein (loss-of-function). EIN2 is an essential positive regulator downstream of CTR1.

This final practice expands our focus from a single linear pathway to the intricate network of hormone \"crosstalk.\" Here, we explore the dynamic relationship between ethylene and auxin, another crucial plant hormone. By comparing the localized effects of applying an ethylene precursor with the more widespread effects of using auxin to stimulate ethylene synthesis, you will uncover a more nuanced principle: a hormone's effect depends not only on the signal itself but also on its synthesis, transport, and interaction with other pathways. [@problem_id:1733128]", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is investigating hormone interactions in a young, actively growing tomato plant. The experiment involves treating two separate, mature leaves on opposite sides of the main stem. Leaf A is carefully sprayed with a solution containing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the immediate biochemical precursor to ethylene. Leaf B is sprayed with a solution containing a high concentration of a synthetic auxin known to strongly stimulate ethylene biosynthesis in plant tissues. The rest of the plant is left untreated. The plant is then observed for several days under optimal growing conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the differential physiological outcomes that will be observed on the plant?\n\nA. Both Leaf A and Leaf B will show identical signs of rapid senescence and epinasty (downward bending of the petiole), and will abscise from the stem at the same time. The rest of the plant will remain unaffected.\n\nB. The effects on the ACC-treated side will be primarily localized to Leaf A, which will exhibit senescence and epinasty. In contrast, the auxin-treated side will not only show similar effects in Leaf B but may also exhibit systemic responses, such as the formation of adventitious roots on the stem near the base of Leaf B's petiole.\n\nC. The ACC-treated Leaf A will remain healthy, as ACC is not biologically active itself. The auxin-treated Leaf B will stimulate vigorous new growth and cell elongation throughout the entire plant, causing the plant to grow taller.\n\nD. The auxin-treated Leaf B will remain green and healthy due to auxin's growth-promoting properties, while the ACC-treated Leaf A will rapidly senesce and die. This demonstrates that auxin can counteract the effects of ethylene.\n\nE. The effects of the ACC treatment will become systemic, as ACC is actively transported throughout the plant, leading to widespread senescence. The effects of the auxin treatment will remain localized to Leaf B because auxin is not a mobile hormone.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the compounds and their known physiological roles and mobilities. Leaf A receives 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the immediate biochemical precursor of ethylene. Plant tissues, including leaves, possess ACC oxidase, which converts ACC to ethylene in situ. Therefore, exogenous ACC applied to a leaf is converted locally into ethylene in that tissue. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that acts predominantly locally and by diffusion over short distances; it is not efficiently transported long distances in a directed manner through vascular tissues. Consequently, the primary effects of ACC application are expected to be localized to the treated organ, with limited spread by diffusion.\n\nEthyleneâ€™s principal effects relevant here include promotion of leaf senescence, stimulation of abscission (via effects on the abscission zone), and induction of epinasty (downward bending due to differential growth on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the petiole). Thus, Leaf A should exhibit senescence and epinasty, with abscission potentially occurring, primarily as a localized response.\n\nLeaf B receives a high concentration of a synthetic auxin known to strongly stimulate ethylene biosynthesis. High auxin levels induce ACC synthase and ACC oxidase gene expression, thereby increasing endogenous ethylene production in the treated tissue. As a result, Leaf B should exhibit ethylene-like responses similar to Leaf A, namely epinasty and senescence, with potential abscission. However, auxin differs from ACC and ethylene in its mobility: auxin undergoes polar transport, moving basipetally from leaves through the petiole into the stem. This directed transport enables auxin to elicit responses beyond the initially treated leaf region. One characteristic auxin-induced response in tomato is the induction of adventitious roots along the stem, particularly near nodes or at sites of localized auxin accumulation such as near the base of a petiole. Therefore, in addition to local ethylene-like effects on Leaf B, one may observe systemic or regional responses on the auxin-treated side, including the formation of adventitious roots near the base of Leaf Bâ€™s petiole.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A is inaccurate because it predicts identical timing and extent for both leaves and no additional systemic effects, ignoring auxinâ€™s mobility and adventitious root induction.\n- Option C is incorrect because ACC, while a precursor, is readily converted to ethylene in plant tissues and therefore is effectively active via conversion.\n- Option D is incorrect because at high concentrations auxin typically stimulates ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene-like responses rather than counteracting them.\n- Option E is incorrect because it reverses the mobility expectation: auxin is highly mobile via polar transport, whereas ACC does not undergo active, whole-plant transport from a leaf application to cause widespread senescence.\n\nOption B correctly predicts localized ethylene responses in the ACC-treated leaf and both local ethylene-like effects plus potential systemic outcomes specific to auxin mobility, notably adventitious root formation near the treated side.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733128"}]}
