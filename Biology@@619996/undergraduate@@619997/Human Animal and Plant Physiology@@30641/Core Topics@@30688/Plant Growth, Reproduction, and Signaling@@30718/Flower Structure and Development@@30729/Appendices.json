The ABC model of flower development provides a simple set of rules that act like a blueprint, dictating which organs—sepals, petals, stamens, or carpels—form in each part of the flower. This exercise [@problem_id:1707220] challenges you to apply this powerful model to a hypothetical scenario, allowing you to practice thinking like a developmental geneticist and predict how a flower's structure changes when a key gene is lost.", "problem": "The development of floral organs in many flowering plants is governed by the ABC model. This model posits that the identity of organs in four concentric whorls of a flower is determined by the differential expression of three classes of homeotic genes: Class A, Class B, and Class C.\n\nConsider a hypothetical plant species whose flower development perfectly adheres to the following rules:\n1.  The flower has four whorls, arranged from outermost to innermost (Whorl 1, Whorl 2, Whorl 3, Whorl 4).\n2.  In a normal (wild-type) flower, Whorl 1 develops into sepals, Whorl 2 into petals, Whorl 3 into stamens, and Whorl 4 into carpels.\n3.  The gene activities that specify these organs are as follows:\n    - Class A activity alone specifies sepals.\n    - Class A and Class B activities together specify petals.\n    - Class B and Class C activities together specify stamens.\n    - Class C activity alone specifies carpels.\n4.  The domains of gene expression are:\n    - Class A genes are expressed in Whorl 1 and Whorl 2.\n    - Class B genes are expressed in Whorl 2 and Whorl 3.\n    - Class C genes are expressed in Whorl 3 and Whorl 4.\n5.  Class A and Class C genes are mutually antagonistic; the expression of one represses the expression of the other. Thus, in any whorl where Class A is active, Class C is inactive, and vice versa.\n\nA researcher discovers a mutant strain of this plant in which there is a complete loss-of-function of all Class A genes. Assuming all other developmental processes are normal, predict the arrangement of floral organs in this mutant, starting from the outermost whorl (Whorl 1) and moving to the innermost whorl (Whorl 4).\n\nA.

Organ specification rules are: $A$ alone gives sepals, $A+B$ gives petals, $B+C$ gives stamens, and $C$ alone gives carpels.\n\nIn the mutant with complete loss-of-function of all Class $A$ genes, $A=0$ in all whorls. By mutual antagonism, the absence of $A$ derepresses $C$ in Whorls 1 and 2, so $C$ is active in Whorls 1 through 4. Class $B$ expression remains as in wild type (Whorls 2 and 3).\n\nDetermine gene combinations and resulting organs by whorl:\n- Whorl 1: $B$ absent, $C$ present, so the active set is $\\{C\\}$, which specifies carpels.\n- Whorl 2: $B$ present, $C$ present, so the active set is $\\{B,C\\}$, which specifies stamens.\n- Whorl 3: $B$ present, $C$ present, so the active set is $\\{B,C\\}$, which specifies stamens (unchanged from wild type).\n- Whorl 4: $B$ absent, $C$ present, so the active set is $\\{C\\}$, which specifies carpels.\n\nThus, from outermost to innermost, the organs are Carpel, Stamen, Stamen, Carpel, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1707220"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its structure, a flower's ultimate purpose is to ensure successful reproduction, a process that in angiosperms involves a unique event called double fertilization. This intricate mechanism creates both the embryo and its essential food supply, the endosperm. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1707241] asks you to explore the critical interdependence of these two fertilization products by predicting the consequences if the endosperm fails to form, reinforcing the importance of this process for seed viability.", "problem": "In a research project on the reproductive biology of a newly discovered species of flowering plant, a stable mutant line is identified. This mutant exhibits a peculiar reproductive defect. Pollination occurs normally, and the pollen tube successfully grows and reaches the ovule's embryo sac. Analysis reveals that one of the two sperm nuclei delivered by the pollen tube correctly fuses with the egg cell. However, a specific cellular incompatibility prevents the second sperm nucleus from fusing with the two polar nuclei within the central cell of the embryo sac. Assuming all other developmental processes are initially normal, which of the following is the most likely consequence for the ovule affected by this mutation?\n\nA. The ovule will develop into a seed containing a healthy embryo, as the ovary wall will provide the necessary nutrients for its growth.\n\nB. The zygote will fail to develop, and the ovule will degenerate immediately because the fertilization of the polar nuclei is a required signal for embryogenesis to begin.\n\nC. The ovule will develop into a seed that lacks an embryo but contains a large, triploid endosperm.\n\nD. A viable seed will form, but it will be unable to germinate because the seed coat, whose development depends on the endosperm, will not form correctly.\n\nE. The zygote will begin to divide and form an early-stage embryo, but development will soon cease, leading to the abortion of the seed due to a lack of nutritive tissue.", "solution": "In angiosperms, sexual reproduction involves double fertilization. One sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell to form the zygote, initiating embryogenesis, while the second sperm nucleus fuses with the two polar nuclei in the central cell to produce the primary endosperm nucleus. The endosperm develops from this nucleus and serves as the nutritive tissue required to support early and continued embryo development.\n\nIn the described mutant, pollination and pollen tube guidance are normal, and one sperm nucleus successfully fuses with the egg cell, forming a zygote. However, the second sperm nucleus fails to fuse with the two polar nuclei in the central cell. The immediate consequence is that no primary endosperm nucleus is formed and thus no endosperm develops.\n\nGiven these principles, the consequences are as follows:\n1. Embryogenesis can begin because fusion of the egg and sperm is sufficient to form a zygote and initiate early cell division. Therefore, the absence of fusion in the central cell is not a prerequisite signal for zygote formation or the first embryonic divisions.\n2. The lack of endosperm eliminates the principal nutritive source for the developing embryo. Although the zygote may undergo initial divisions using maternal resources and stored reserves, sustained embryo development typically requires endosperm. Without endosperm, embryo growth soon ceases, and the ovule commonly aborts rather than maturing into a viable seed.\n3. There can be no triploid endosperm in this mutant because the triple fusion (two polar nuclei plus one sperm) does not occur.\n4. The ovary wall (pericarp) is maternal tissue that forms the fruit and does not substitute for endosperm in nourishing the embryo. The seed coat derives from maternal integuments and its initiation is tied to fertilization, but its correct formation is not the key barrier here; rather, the absence of endosperm deprives the embryo of nutrition, leading to abortion.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the ovary wall does not provide the nutritive support normally supplied by endosperm to the embryo.\n- B is incorrect because embryogenesis can begin after egg fertilization independent of central cell fertilization; the latter is not the required trigger for the onset of embryogenesis.\n- C is incorrect because triploid endosperm cannot form without the triple fusion.\n- D is incorrect because the primary issue is the lack of endosperm leading to nonviability before germination; moreover, the seed coat is maternal and not strictly dependent on endosperm for its formation.\n- E is correct: the zygote will initiate development, but embryo growth soon halts due to the absence of endosperm, leading to abortion of the seed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1707241"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the cellular to the organismal level, understanding a plant's reproductive strategy is key to understanding its ecology and evolution. Botanists use carefully designed experiments to uncover whether a plant can self-pollinate or if it requires a partner. This problem [@problem_id:1707251] places you in the role of a researcher, tasking you with analyzing real-world experimental data to deduce the mating system of a newly discovered species, thereby honing your skills in scientific reasoning and data interpretation.", "problem": "A team of botanists studying a remote island ecosystem discovers a new species of flowering plant, which they name *Petalidium singularis*. The flowers of this plant are perfect, containing both functional stamens (male parts) and pistils (female parts). To understand its reproductive strategy, the researchers conduct a controlled pollination experiment. They divide a population of plants into three treatment groups:\n\n*   **Group A:** 100 flowers were selected. Before each flower bud opened, it was enclosed in a fine mesh bag to prevent insect pollination. Once the flower opened, pollen from its own anthers was manually transferred to its stigma. The bag was then replaced.\n*   **Group B:** 100 flowers were selected. Before each flower bud opened, its anthers were carefully removed (a process called emasculation), and the bud was bagged. Once the flower opened, pollen collected from a different individual of *Petalidium singularis* was manually transferred to its stigma. The bag was then replaced.\n*   **Group C:** 100 flowers were selected. They were emasculated and bagged just like in Group B, but no pollen was applied to the stigma. This served as a control to test for asexual seed production (apomixis).\n\nAfter several weeks, the researchers recorded the number of flowers in each group that successfully developed into mature fruits. The results were as follows:\n\n*   **Group A (Self-pollination):** 2 flowers developed into fruit.\n*   **Group B (Cross-pollination):** 93 flowers developed into fruit.\n*   **Group C (Emasculation control):** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most logical conclusion about the reproductive system of *Petalidium singularis*?\n\nA. The plant is self-compatible.\n\nB. The plant exhibits a high degree of self-incompatibility.\n\nC. The plant is sterile and cannot reproduce sexually.\n\nD. The plant reproduces asexually through apomixis.\n\nE. The pollen produced by *Petalidium singularis* is generally non-viable.", "solution": "We interpret each treatment as a test of a specific reproductive pathway and use the observed fruit set to infer compatibility.\n\n1) Group A (manual self-pollination under a bag) tests self-compatibility. The fruit set is $f_{A}=\\frac{2}{100}=0.02$, which is extremely low. Such a low value indicates that self-pollen rarely results in successful fertilization and fruit development, consistent with self-incompatibility. The nonzero value suggests the self-incompatibility system is strong but not absolute, allowing rare “leakage” or partial breakdown.\n\n2) Group B (emasculation to prevent selfing, then manual cross-pollination under a bag) tests cross-compatibility and pollen and pistil viability. The fruit set is $f_{B}=\\frac{93}{100}=0.93$, which is high. This demonstrates that both pollen and pistils are functional and that cross-pollination is readily successful. Therefore, the species is not sterile, and its pollen is viable under appropriate (cross) conditions.\n\n3) Group C (emasculation and bagging with no pollen) tests for apomixis and contamination. The fruit set is $f_{C}=\\frac{0}{100}=0$, indicating no asexual seed production and that the bagging effectively prevented unintended pollination.\n\nFrom these results:\n- The high success in Group B rules out sterility (eliminates option C) and contradicts generally non-viable pollen (eliminates option E).\n- The zero fruit set in Group C rules out apomixis (eliminates option D).\n- The extremely low fruit set in Group A is inconsistent with self-compatibility (eliminates option A) and indicates a strong, though not absolute, self-incompatibility system.\n\nThus, the most logical conclusion is that the plant exhibits a high degree of self-incompatibility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1707251"}]}
