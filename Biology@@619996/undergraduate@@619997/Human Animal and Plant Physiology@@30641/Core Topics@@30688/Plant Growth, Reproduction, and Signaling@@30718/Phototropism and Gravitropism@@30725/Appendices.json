By comparing the effects of blue, red, and white light, this exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of plant photoreceptors—specifically, the role of phototropins in sensing blue light. Understanding this action spectrum is the first step in deciphering the molecular conversation between light and plant movement [@problem_id:1729117].", "problem": "A plant physiologist is investigating the phototropic response in etiolated maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles. An intact coleoptile is placed in a completely dark, temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber, oriented vertically. A narrow beam of monochromatic light can be directed horizontally at one side of the coleoptile, targeting the region just below its apex. The experiment is designed to measure the angle of curvature of the coleoptile relative to its initial vertical orientation after a fixed duration of illumination.\n\nFour separate, identical experiments are conducted, each using a different illumination condition:\n\n1.  **Condition A:** Unilateral illumination with blue light at a wavelength of $450$ nm.\n2.  **Condition B:** Unilateral illumination with red light at a wavelength of $660$ nm.\n3.  **Condition C:** The coleoptile is maintained in complete darkness for the duration of the experiment.\n4.  **Condition D:** Unilateral illumination with a broad-spectrum white light.\n\nAssume that the light intensity (fluence rate) for each condition is adjusted to be physiologically effective for any potential response, and the experimental duration is sufficient for a measurable tropic response to develop.\n\nBased on the known molecular mechanisms of phototropism in higher plants, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the relative outcomes of these experiments?\n\nA. Condition B will produce the largest angle of curvature, significantly greater than the curvature produced in Condition A.\n\nB. Conditions A and D will result in significant curvature towards the light source, while Conditions B and C will result in negligible curvature.\n\nC. All conditions involving light (A, B, and D) will result in significant and approximately equal angles of curvature towards the light source.\n\nD. Condition D will result in the largest curvature, followed by Condition B, and then Condition A, with Condition C showing no curvature.\n\nE. Conditions A and D will result in curvature towards the light source, while Condition B will result in significant curvature away from the light source.", "solution": "Phototropism in coleoptiles is a positive curvature towards unilateral light driven by blue-light photoreceptors, primarily phototropins (phot1 and phot2). The experimentally established action spectrum for shoot phototropism peaks in the blue region near a wavelength of approximately $450$ nm, indicating maximal sensitivity to blue light and negligible sensitivity to red light for eliciting phototropic curvature.\n\nThe mechanistic basis involves unilateral blue-light perception at the coleoptile tip, which triggers asymmetric auxin distribution via relocalization of auxin transporters, producing higher auxin concentration on the shaded side. This yields differential elongation rates such that the shaded side grows faster than the illuminated side, i.e., $r_{\\text{shaded}} > r_{\\text{lit}}$, producing curvature towards the light source. In the absence of a directional light cue, auxin distribution remains symmetric and elongation rates are equal, $r_{\\text{shaded}} = r_{\\text{lit}}$, so no net curvature develops.\n\nApplying these principles to the conditions:\n- Condition A (unilateral blue, $450$ nm): Strong activation of phototropins produces significant curvature towards the light via the auxin-mediated mechanism described.\n- Condition B (unilateral red, $660$ nm): Red light is perceived primarily by phytochromes, which regulate processes such as germination and shade avoidance but do not effectively drive the phototropic response in coleoptiles; unilateral red alone produces negligible phototropic curvature under standard conditions.\n- Condition C (dark): No directional cue, so no asymmetric auxin distribution and negligible curvature.\n- Condition D (unilateral white light): White light contains blue wavelengths; thus phototropins are activated and significant curvature towards the light occurs, comparable to that in Condition A when intensities are adjusted to be physiologically effective.\n\nEvaluating the options, the only statement consistent with the known action spectrum and mechanism is that Conditions A and D produce significant curvature towards the light, while Conditions B and C produce negligible curvature. Therefore, the correct choice is B. Other options are incorrect because they either overstate red-light efficacy for phototropism (A, D), claim equal curvature for all light qualities (C), or assert red-induced curvature away from the light (E), which is not supported for coleoptiles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1729117"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand how plants sense gravity, it is helpful to construct a thought experiment that removes other directional cues. This problem [@problem_id:1729107] does exactly that by placing a seedling in an environment with uniform, nondirectional light, thereby isolating the effects of gravitropism. By predicting the plant's growth after it is tilted, you will reinforce the fundamental principles of negative gravitropism in shoots and positive gravitropism in roots, which are crucial for plant orientation and survival.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is studying tropisms in seedlings. A seedling is germinated and grown in a sealed, upright \"isotropic illumination chamber.\" This chamber is engineered to provide uniform, constant-intensity light to the plant from all directions simultaneously (top, bottom, and all sides). After the seedling has established a straight, vertical shoot and root system aligned with the gravitational field, the entire chamber is carefully tilted at an angle of $45^\\circ$ with respect to the vertical and then held fixed in this new position. Assume gravity acts vertically downwards.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the subsequent growth pattern of the seedling inside the tilted chamber?\n\nA. The shoot and root will both continue to grow straight, parallel to the new orientation of the chamber's central axis.\n\nB. The shoot will bend to grow towards the gravitational \"up\" direction (opposite to the force of gravity), and the root will bend to grow towards the gravitational \"down\" direction (aligned with the force of gravity).\n\nC. The shoot will bend to grow towards the geometric \"top\" of the tilted chamber, and the root will bend to grow towards the geometric \"bottom\" of the tilted chamber, driven by the light.\n\nD. Both the shoot and root will cease directional growth and begin to grow in random directions due to the conflicting stimuli.\n\nE. The shoot will bend to grow towards the gravitational \"down\" direction, and the root will bend to grow towards the gravitational \"up\" direction.", "solution": "1) Identify the available directional stimuli before and after tilting.\n- The chamber provides uniform, constant-intensity light from all directions. By definition, isotropic illumination removes any net directional light gradient, so there is no phototropic vector to bias growth direction. Therefore, phototropism does not contribute to directional growth.\n- Gravity remains a constant vector pointing vertically downward. Thus, gravitropism is the only directional cue.\n\n2) Establish the baseline orientation prior to tilting.\n- The seedling has already formed a straight vertical shoot and root aligned with the gravitational field. This is consistent with classical gravitropic responses: shoots exhibit negative gravitropism (growth against the gravity vector) and roots exhibit positive gravitropism (growth along the gravity vector).\n\n3) Analyze the effect of tilting the chamber by $45^{\\circ}$ with respect to vertical while gravity remains vertical.\n- Tilting changes the seedling’s orientation with respect to the gravity vector but does not change the gravity vector itself. Immediately after tilting, the shoot and root axes are no longer aligned with their preferred orientations relative to gravity.\n\n4) State the mechanistic basis of gravitropic bending after tilting.\n- In both roots and shoots, gravity is sensed via statolith sedimentation in specialized cells, which triggers asymmetrical redistribution of auxin across the organ (Cholodny–Went model).\n- In shoots, increased auxin on the lower side promotes cell elongation, resulting in curvature that raises the shoot tip, i.e., bending toward the direction opposite the gravity vector (negative gravitropism).\n- In roots, increased auxin on the lower side inhibits cell elongation, causing the root to bend downward toward the gravity vector (positive gravitropism).\n\n5) Predict the growth trajectory under isotropic light with only gravitropic guidance.\n- Because there is no directional light cue, the only consistent directional growth arises from gravitropism.\n- Therefore, after the tilt, the shoot will bend to reorient toward gravitational “up” (opposite to gravity), and the root will bend to reorient toward gravitational “down” (along gravity), until they approach alignment with their respective gravitropic setpoints.\n\n6) Evaluate the options:\n- A: Incorrect. Alignment with the chamber’s axis is irrelevant; gravity, not chamber geometry, dictates direction.\n- B: Correct. Matches negative gravitropism of shoots and positive gravitropism of roots under isotropic light.\n- C: Incorrect. Isotropic illumination provides no top–bottom light gradient; phototropism does not drive direction here.\n- D: Incorrect. There is a single, nonconflicting cue (gravity), so growth is not random.\n- E: Incorrect. This reverses the known gravitropic responses of shoots and roots.\n\nConclusion: The shoot bends toward gravitational “up” and the root toward gravitational “down,” which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1729107"}, {"introduction": "Plants in nature often face competing environmental signals. This exercise [@problem_id:1729157] presents a classic conflict by pitting the pull of gravity against a light source from an unusual direction—directly below the plant.

A single seed of a typical terrestrial plant is sown in a pot filled with a suitable growth medium. The pot itself is made of an opaque material, but its base is perfectly transparent.

The only illumination provided is from a uniform light source placed directly beneath the transparent base of the pot, shining light vertically upwards through the soil.

Let the gravitational acceleration vector be $\\vec{g}$ directed downward. The light source is placed beneath the pot and shines upward through the soil; the light source itself is below, so “toward the light source” means downward.\n\nPrinciples:\n- Shoots exhibit positive phototropism (growth toward the light source) and negative gravitropism (growth opposite to $\\vec{g}$).\n- Roots exhibit negative phototropism (growth away from the light source) and positive gravitropism (growth along $\\vec{g}$).\n- When phototropic and gravitropic cues conflict, the typical dominance is that phototropism dominates in shoots, while gravitropism dominates in roots.\n\nApply to the setup:\n1. For the shoot: The light source is below, so positive phototropism favors growth downward (toward the source). Negative gravitropism favors growth upward (opposite $\\vec{g}$). Under conflicting cues, phototropism generally dominates in shoots; therefore, the shoot grows downward, toward the light source.\n2.

Under conflicting cues, gravitropism generally dominates in roots; therefore, the root grows downward, along $\\vec{g}$.\n\nThus, the shoot grows downward toward the light source, and the root grows downward with gravity, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1729157"}]}
