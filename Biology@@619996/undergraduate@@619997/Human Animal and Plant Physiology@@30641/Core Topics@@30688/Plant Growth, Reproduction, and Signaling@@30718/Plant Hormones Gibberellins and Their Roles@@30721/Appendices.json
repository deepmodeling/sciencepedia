This exercise presents a classic grafting experiment, a powerful technique in plant physiology that allows us to test these hypotheses directly. By considering the movement of a mobile hormone like gibberellin between different plant parts, you can learn to predict experimental outcomes and diagnose the underlying cause of a phenotype like dwarfism [@problem_id:1733399].", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the genetic basis for dwarfism in a newly discovered plant species, *Virentia humilis*. This species has two distinct, naturally occurring phenotypes: a tall wild-type and a short, dwarf variant. The botanist hypothesizes that the dwarf phenotype is caused by a single-gene mutation that disrupts the normal function of the plant hormone gibberellin, which is crucial for stem elongation.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are proposed to explain the dwarfism:\n1.  **Deficiency Hypothesis**: The dwarf plants have a mutation in a gene essential for the biosynthesis of gibberellin, making them unable to produce the hormone.\n2.  **Insensitivity Hypothesis**: The dwarf plants produce normal levels of gibberellin, but have a mutation in the hormone's receptor or a downstream signaling component, rendering them unable to respond to it.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the botanist performs a classic grafting experiment. A scion (the upper shoot portion of a plant) from a dwarf variant is grafted onto the rootstock (the lower root and stem portion) of a tall, wild-type plant. Assume the graft is successful and that hormones can be transported across the graft union.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence for the **Deficiency Hypothesis**?\n\nA. The dwarf scion remains dwarf after being grafted onto the tall rootstock.\n\nB. The dwarf scion grows and develops into a tall shoot, phenotypically resembling the wild-type plant.\n\nC. The tall wild-type rootstock begins to exhibit stunted growth characteristics after the dwarf scion is grafted onto it.\n\nD. Both the scion and the rootstock degenerate, indicating graft incompatibility.\n\nE. The leaves of the dwarf scion turn yellow, but the stem does not elongate.", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the two hypotheses in terms of cause and predicted response to exogenous hormone supplied via the graft:\n(1) Deficiency Hypothesis: The dwarf scion does not synthesize gibberellin but has a functional perception/signaling pathway. If supplied with gibberellin transported from the wild-type rootstock, the scion should respond with normal stem elongation and grow tall.\n(2) Insensitivity Hypothesis: The dwarf scion synthesizes gibberellin normally but has a defective receptor or downstream signaling. In this case, additional gibberellin supplied via the graft will not be perceived, so the scion will remain dwarf.\n\nNext, we apply the biological principle that gibberellin is a mobile hormone capable of being transported across a successful graft union from the rootstock into the scion. Therefore:\n(3) Under the Deficiency Hypothesis, a tall wild-type rootstock will produce gibberellin, which will move into the dwarf scion. Because the scion’s signaling machinery is intact in this hypothesis, the scion will elongate and adopt a tall phenotype.\n(4) Under the Insensitivity Hypothesis, even if the wild-type rootstock supplies normal or increased gibberellin to the scion, the scion cannot perceive the hormone; thus, the dwarf phenotype will persist.\n\nWe now map these predictions to the answer choices:\n(5) A: Scion remains dwarf. This supports insensitivity, not deficiency.\n(6) B: Scion becomes tall. This is the expected outcome under deficiency with intact signaling, thus strongly supports the Deficiency Hypothesis.\n(7) C: Rootstock becomes stunted due to scion. This is not expected; hormone supply from scion to rootstock does not explain loss of growth in a wild-type rootstock.\n(8) D: Graft incompatibility provides no information about hormone deficiency versus insensitivity.\n(9) E: Leaf chlorosis without stem elongation is nonspecific and does not establish deficiency versus insensitivity with respect to gibberellin signaling.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence for the Deficiency Hypothesis is that the dwarf scion becomes tall when grafted onto a wild-type rootstock, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733399"}, {"introduction": "Once a hormone deficiency has been identified, the next step is often to pinpoint the specific error in its complex biosynthetic pathway.

Plants with a functional pathway (wild-type) exhibit a tall phenotype.\n\nAn investigation is conducted on two different dwarf mutants of this plant species.\n- **Mutant A** is a dwarf because it possesses a null mutation in the gene encoding for Enzyme 1, rendering the enzyme completely non-functional.\n- **Mutant B** is a dwarf because it possesses a null mutation in the gene encoding for Enzyme 3, rendering this enzyme completely non-functional.\n\nSeedlings of both Mutant A and Mutant B are grown under identical conditions.

This practice explores a thought experiment involving a genetically modified plant with a permanently stable repressor protein, known as DELLA. Analyzing this scenario [@problem_id:1733347] will challenge your understanding of the core logic of GA signaling and highlight why the regulated degradation of DELLA proteins is the critical event for promoting growth.", "problem": "In many higher plants, the hormone Gibberellin (GA) plays a crucial role in regulating growth and development, including processes like seed germination and stem elongation. The signaling pathway for GA is well-characterized. In the absence of GA, a class of nuclear proteins known as DELLA proteins act as repressors, binding to transcription factors and preventing the expression of growth-promoting genes. This results in inhibited growth. When GA is present, it binds to its soluble receptor, GID1. This GA-GID1 complex then binds to a DELLA protein, triggering the DELLA protein to be targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The destruction of the DELLA repressor protein liberates the transcription factors, allowing them to activate the expression of growth-related genes, and an increase in growth is observed.\n\nA plant geneticist develops a transgenic plant line that expresses a stable, modified version of a DELLA protein. This modified DELLA protein retains its ability to repress transcription factors, and it can still be bound by the GA-GID1 complex, but it has been altered in such a way that it can no longer be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the observable phenotype of this transgenic plant, especially when it is sprayed with a solution containing a high concentration of gibberellin?\n\nA. The plant will exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype and will not show a growth response to the applied gibberellin.\n\nB. The plant will have a phenotype identical to a wild-type plant, showing normal growth and a normal response to applied gibberellin.\n\nC. The plant will exhibit a tall and spindly phenotype, characteristic of plants with excessive gibberellin signaling.\n\nD. The plant will initially be a dwarf but will grow to a normal height after the application of gibberellin, as the high concentration of the hormone will overcome the repression.\n\nE. The plant will die during the seedling stage because essential metabolic processes are permanently shut down.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the phenotype of a transgenic plant with a modified DELLA protein that cannot be degraded. To solve this, we must analyze the effect of this mutation on the gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway.\n\nStep 1: Understand the normal GA signaling pathway.\n- In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins are stable and active.\n- Active DELLA proteins repress growth by inhibiting transcription factors necessary for the expression of growth-promoting genes. The default state is therefore repressed growth.\n- When GA is present, it binds to its receptor, GID1.\n- The GA-GID1 complex binds to a DELLA protein.\n- This binding event marks the DELLA protein for degradation by the cell's protein disposal machinery (the 26S proteasome).\n- The destruction of the DELLA repressor removes the block on growth-promoting genes, leading to plant growth (e.g., stem elongation).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the specific mutation in the transgenic plant.\n- The plant expresses a modified DELLA protein that cannot be degraded by the proteasome.\n- This modified DELLA protein is still functional as a growth repressor.\n- This means that even when GA is present and binds to GID1, and the resulting complex binds to the DELLA protein, the final and crucial step of the pathway—the degradation of DELLA—is blocked.\n\nStep 3: Deduce the molecular consequences.\n- Since the DELLA protein cannot be degraded, it will remain present and active in the nucleus, regardless of the concentration of GA in the plant's tissues.\n- An active DELLA protein constantly represses the transcription of growth-promoting genes.\n- This condition is a state of constitutive (permanent) repression of the GA growth response. The cell is unable to respond to the GA signal because the repressor cannot be removed.\n\nStep 4: Predict the whole-plant phenotype.\n- The continuous repression of growth-promoting genes will lead to a significant reduction in growth processes that are regulated by GA, such as stem elongation.\n- This will result in a plant with a dwarf phenotype.\n- Because the block in the signaling pathway occurs downstream of GA perception (i.e., the repressor itself is invulnerable), applying external GA will not alleviate the repression. The plant will be insensitive to GA.\n- Therefore, even when sprayed with high concentrations of GA, the plant will remain a dwarf.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The plant will exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype and will not show a growth response to the applied gibberellin. This perfectly matches our deduction. The constitutive activity of the DELLA repressor causes dwarfism, and the inability to degrade it causes GA insensitivity.\n- B. The plant will have a phenotype identical to a wild-type plant, showing normal growth and a normal response to applied gibberellin. This is incorrect. The mutation fundamentally breaks the signaling pathway.\n- C. The plant will exhibit a tall and spindly phenotype, characteristic of plants with excessive gibberellin signaling. This is the opposite of the expected outcome. A tall phenotype would result from a lack of DELLA protein or a hyperactive GA pathway.\n- D. The plant will initially be a dwarf but will grow to a normal height after the application of gibberellin. This is incorrect. It suggests that high GA levels can overcome the repressor by some other means, but the mechanism of action—degradation—is explicitly blocked. Thus, the plant is GA-insensitive, not just less sensitive.\n- E. The plant will die during the seedling stage. While severe dwarfism might reduce fitness, DELLA proteins are primarily growth regulators, not controllers of essential central metabolism. Plants with this mutation are viable, though severely dwarfed. Thus, lethality is not the most accurate prediction.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate prediction is that the plant will be a GA-insensitive dwarf.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1733347"}]}
