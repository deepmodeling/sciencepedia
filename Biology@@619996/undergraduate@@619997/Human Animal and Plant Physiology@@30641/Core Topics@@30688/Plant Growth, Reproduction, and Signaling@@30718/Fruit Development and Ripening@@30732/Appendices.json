Both fruits are harvested at the stage of commercial maturity, meaning they are mature but not yet fully ripe. Fruit A is classified as a climacteric fruit, while Fruit B is classified as a non-climacteric fruit. Immediately after harvest, samples of each fruit are placed into separate, sealed, temperature-controlled chambers.

Chamber A, containing the climacteric fruit, will show a dramatic and relatively sudden increase in both $CO_2$ and ethylene concentrations peaking well after harvest, followed by a decline. Chamber B, containing the non-climacteric fruit, will show a high initial $CO_2$ concentration that gradually decreases throughout the period, with ethylene remaining at negligible levels.\n\nB.

Chamber A will show a sharp peak in $CO_2$ but a steady, low level of ethylene. Chamber B will show a steady decline in $CO_2$ but a sharp peak in ethylene, which triggers ripening without a respiratory burst.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the pattern of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and ethylene production in two types of fruits, climacteric (Fruit A) and non-climacteric (Fruit B), after harvest. This requires understanding the fundamental physiological differences in their ripening processes.\n\n**Step 1: Define Climacteric and Non-climacteric Ripening**\nThe key distinction between these two fruit types lies in their respiratory patterns and sensitivity to the plant hormone ethylene during ripening.\n- **Climacteric fruits** (like bananas, apples, tomatoes, and Fruit A) undergo a distinct phase during ripening called the \"climacteric rise.\" This is characterized by a dramatic increase in the rate of respiration, which means a significant increase in oxygen ($O_2$) consumption and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) production. This respiratory burst is autocatalytically triggered and sustained by a spike in the production of ethylene gas. In essence, a small amount of ethylene triggers the production of more ethylene and a surge in metabolic activity (respiration) that drives the ripening process (changes in color, texture, and aroma). When harvested mature but unripe, this entire process occurs off the plant.\n- **Non-climacteric fruits** (like citrus, grapes, strawberries, and Fruit B) do not exhibit this climacteric rise in respiration. They ripen more gradually. Their respiration rate is typically highest at harvest and then slowly and steadily declines as they age and senesce. While they produce trace amounts of ethylene, they do not have the autocatalytic ethylene production mechanism and are generally not responsive to external ethylene for initiating ripening (though it can accelerate senescence).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Expected Gas Profile for Fruit A (Climacteric)**\nFruit A is climacteric and was harvested mature but unripe.\n- Initially, its respiration rate will be relatively low, so $CO_2$ production will be low.\n- As the ripening process initiates, there will be a burst of ethylene synthesis.\n- This ethylene burst will trigger the climacteric rise in respiration. Consequently, we expect to see a sharp and significant increase in the concentration of $CO_2$ in Chamber A.\n- The peaks of ethylene and $CO_2$ production are closely linked and occur well after harvest.\n- After this peak, as the fruit becomes fully ripe and enters senescence (aging), the respiration rate and ethylene production will decline.\n- Therefore, for Chamber A, the expected pattern is a low initial rate, followed by a large, relatively sharp peak in both ethylene and $CO_2$, and then a fall.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Expected Gas Profile for Fruit B (Non-climacteric)**\nFruit B is non-climacteric.\n- Ripening in these fruits is a more gradual continuation of processes that began on the plant. They do not have a respiratory burst to complete ripening.\n- At the point of harvest, their metabolic rate is at its highest.\n- After being detached from the parent plant (their source of nutrients), their respiration rate will begin a slow, steady decline as they consume their stored reserves.\n- Ethylene production remains at very low, basal, and physiologically insignificant levels throughout the post-harvest period.\n- Therefore, for Chamber B, we expect an initial $CO_2$ level that only decreases over time. Ethylene levels will be negligible.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options**\n- **A:** This option correctly describes the expected patterns. Chamber A (climacteric) shows a dramatic post-harvest increase in both $CO_2$ and ethylene. Chamber B (non-climacteric) shows a gradually decreasing $CO_2$ level from a high initial point and negligible ethylene. This matches our analysis.\n- **B:** This option reverses the roles of climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. It is incorrect.\n- **C:** This option incorrectly claims both fruits show a steady decline and negligible ethylene, ignoring the defining climacteric burst of Fruit A. It is incorrect.\n- **D:** This option incorrectly suggests both fruits are climacteric. The pattern described is only characteristic of Fruit A. It is incorrect.\n- **E:** This option incorrectly decouples the $CO_2$ and ethylene peaks. In climacteric fruits, the ethylene burst *causes* the respiratory ($CO_2$) burst. It also incorrectly suggests a non-climacteric fruit would have an ethylene peak. It is incorrect.\n\nBased on the physiological principles of fruit ripening, option A provides the most accurate description of the events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1707774"}, {"introduction": "Having established the central role of ethylene in climacteric ripening, we now delve into its biochemical origins. This exercise presents a thought experiment involving genetic engineering to block the ethylene biosynthesis pathway at its rate-limiting step. Working through this scenario will deepen your understanding of metabolic control and how a 'knockout' phenotype can reveal the function of a specific enzyme like ACC synthase. [@problem_id:1707775]", "problem": "In plant physiology, fruit ripening is a complex, genetically programmed process. Fruits are broadly classified as climacteric or non-climacteric. Climacteric fruits, such as tomatoes, bananas, and apples, exhibit a characteristic burst in respiration and ethylene production at the onset of ripening. Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, is the primary trigger for this process. The biosynthesis of ethylene in plant tissues follows a well-established pathway, starting from the amino acid methionine. A crucial, rate-limiting step in this pathway is the conversion of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme ACC synthase.\n\nA team of plant scientists has developed a genetically modified tomato plant in which the gene encoding the ACC synthase enzyme has been rendered completely non-functional through targeted gene editing. The fruits on this plant develop and grow to their normal mature size. Considering the role of ACC synthase in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, select the option that most accurately describes the expected phenotype of these fruits.\n\nA. The fruit ripens prematurely on the vine, showing accelerated softening and color change.\n\nB. The fruit fails to undergo ripening and remains green and firm. Ripening cannot be induced by any external chemical treatment because the ripening machinery is fundamentally broken.\n\nC. The fruit develops to a mature green state but fails to ripen on its own. However, the ripening process (color change, softening) can be successfully initiated by exposing the harvested fruit to external ethylene gas.\n\nD. The fruit ripens normally, but the process is significantly delayed by several weeks compared to wild-type tomatoes.\n\nE. The fruit fails to grow to its full size and drops from the plant before reaching the mature green stage.", "solution": "Climacteric fruit ripening depends on a burst of endogenous ethylene that triggers and sustains ripening via an autocatalytic loop. Ethylene biosynthesis proceeds through the methionine cycle: methionine is converted to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), then ACC synthase catalyzes the rate-limiting step from SAM to ACC, and ACC oxidase converts ACC to ethylene. Symbolically,\n$$\n\\text{Methionine} \\to \\text{SAM} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ACC synthase}} \\text{ACC} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ACC oxidase}} \\text{ethylene}.\n$$\nIf the ACC synthase gene is rendered completely non-functional, endogenous production of ACC is effectively eliminated. Consequently, endogenous ethylene biosynthesis is blocked at the SAM-to-ACC step, preventing the climacteric ethylene burst and the associated autonomous initiation of ripening. Development to mature green size is unaffected because fruit growth occurs prior to ripening and is regulated primarily by hormones other than ethylene.\n\nDespite the block in ethylene biosynthesis, the downstream ethylene perception and signaling machinery (receptors, signaling components, and ripening gene networks) remain intact. Exogenous ethylene bypasses the blocked biosynthetic step by directly activating receptors and downstream transcriptional programs necessary for ripening (color change, softening, flavor volatiles). Therefore, the fruit will not ripen on the plant on its own but can be induced to ripen after harvest by exposure to ethylene gas.\n\nThis matches the description that the fruit reaches mature green stage, fails to ripen autonomously, but ripening can be initiated by external ethylene, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1707775"}, {"introduction": "A complete signaling pathway requires not only the production of a signal but also its perception by the target cell. This final practice explores the other side of the ethylene coin: the receptor. By considering a scenario where the ethylene receptor is non-functional, you can predict the outcome and grasp the critical importance of signal perception in triggering a physiological response like ripening. [@problem_id:1711519]", "problem": "In the field of agricultural biotechnology, a research team is studying climacteric fruits, which are fruits that exhibit a characteristic burst of respiration and ethylene production as they ripen. The hormone ethylene acts as a key signaling molecule, binding to specific cellular receptors to initiate a cascade of downstream events. This cascade includes the expression of genes responsible for softening of the cell walls, conversion of starches to sugars, and changes in pigmentation.\n\nThe team successfully develops a genetically engineered variant of a climacteric plant species. In this variant, the gene encoding the ethylene receptor has been mutated in such a way that the receptor protein is produced but is completely non-functional; it cannot bind to ethylene. The engineered plants are otherwise healthy and are able to grow to maturity, flower, and undergo pollination and fertilization.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the fate of the fruit produced by these genetically engineered plants, compared to the fruit from wild-type (unmodified) plants of the same species?\n\nA. The fruit will grow to its mature size but will fail to undergo the characteristic changes of ripening; it will remain hard, starchy, and green.\n\nB. The fruit will ripen prematurely and at an accelerated rate, displaying softening and color change much earlier than wild-type fruit.\n\nC. The fruit will be parthenocarpic (seedless), but will otherwise undergo a normal ripening process.\n\nD. The fruit will ripen normally, but will be insensitive to the application of external ethylene gas.\n\nE. Fruit development will be arrested shortly after fertilization, and the immature fruits will abscise (drop) from the plant.", "solution": "Let $E$ denote ethylene, $R$ the ethylene receptor, and $ER$ the ethylene–receptor complex. In wild-type climacteric fruits, ripening is initiated when $E$ binds $R$, forming $ER$, which triggers a signaling cascade that induces expression of genes for cell wall softening, starch-to-sugar conversion, and pigmentation. This ligand–receptor interaction can be represented by the mass-action equilibrium:\n$$\nE + R \\rightleftharpoons ER,\\quad K_{d} = \\frac{[E][R]}{[ER]}.\n$$\nActivation of the downstream pathway requires $[ER] > 0$, i.e., successful binding of $E$ to $R$.\n\nIn the engineered plants, the receptor protein is produced but is completely non-functional with respect to ethylene binding. This implies that the effective binding is abolished. Symbolically, this can be represented as $k_{\\text{on}} = 0$ or, equivalently, $K_{d} \\to \\infty$, which yields\n$$\n[ER] = 0 \\quad \\text{for all finite } [E].\n$$\nSince $[ER] = 0$, the ethylene-triggered signaling cascade is not initiated, and the ripening gene program is not activated. Therefore, traits dependent on ethylene signaling—softening, sugar accumulation from starch, and color change—do not occur. By the problem’s premise, the plants can grow to maturity, flower, and undergo pollination and fertilization, indicating that fruit set and growth to mature size proceed. What specifically fails is the ethylene-dependent ripening phase.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A predicts mature-sized fruit that fails to ripen (remains hard, starchy, green), which follows directly from $[ER]=0$ preventing the ripening program. This matches the expected ethylene-insensitive phenotype.\n- B predicts premature, accelerated ripening, which would require constitutive pathway activation (effectively $[ER]>0$ without $E$), contradicting the non-binding condition $[ER]=0$.\n- C invokes parthenocarpy (seedlessness), which is unrelated to ethylene receptor binding in this context; fertilization occurs normally per the prompt, and ripening would still require ethylene signaling.\n- D claims normal ripening but insensitivity to external ethylene; however, if binding is abolished, both endogenous and exogenous ethylene are ineffective, so ripening cannot be normal.\n- E predicts arrest of fruit development and abscission, which conflicts with the stated normal growth to maturity and successful fertilization.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1711519"}]}
