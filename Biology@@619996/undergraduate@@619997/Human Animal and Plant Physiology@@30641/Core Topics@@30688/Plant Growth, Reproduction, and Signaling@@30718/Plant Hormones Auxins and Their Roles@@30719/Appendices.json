{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how plants grow toward light is a foundational topic in plant physiology. The following problem takes us back to the classic experiments that first unveiled the existence of a mobile, growth-promoting signal in plants. By reasoning through a hypothetical variation of these historical experiments, you can practice applying the core principles of phototropism and appreciate how simple, elegant experimental design can lead to profound discoveries [@problem_id:1732623].", "problem": "In the early 20th century, experiments on phototropism in oat (Avena) coleoptiles were crucial for understanding plant growth regulation. A coleoptile is the protective sheath covering the emerging shoot in grasses. It is known that the tip of the coleoptile perceives the light stimulus and that a signal is transmitted to the lower region, causing differential growth that results in bending.\n\nConsider a classic experimental setup where an oat coleoptile is exposed to a unilateral light source, meaning light shines on it from one side only. A student modifies this experiment by making a small vertical incision just below the tip and inserting a thin, impermeable mica sheet into the incision. The mica sheet is positioned on the side of the coleoptile that is directly illuminated by the light source, and it does not pass all the way through the coleoptile.\n\nBased on the established mechanism of phototropism, what is the most likely observation for this modified coleoptile?\n\nA. The coleoptile will bend towards the light source.\n\nB. The coleoptile will not bend and will continue to grow straight up.\n\nC. The coleoptile will bend away from the light source.\n\nD. The coleoptile will cease to grow entirely.\n\nE. The coleoptile will bend, but in a random direction not related to the light source.", "solution": "Phototropic bending in coleoptiles is due to asymmetric distribution of auxin produced in the tip. Under unilateral light, auxin is laterally redistributed so that the shaded side receives a higher auxin concentration than the illuminated side. Because auxin in coleoptile tissue promotes cell elongation, greater elongation on the shaded side results in curvature toward the light source.\n\nThe signal (auxin) must be transmitted from the tip to the subapical region. Impermeable barriers such as mica block the passage of auxin only where they intervene. Classic half-block experiments established that when a mica sheet is inserted only on the illuminated side between the tip and the lower region, transmission along the shaded side remains intact, allowing auxin to move preferentially down the shaded side. This preserves the asymmetric auxin distribution, with higher auxin on the shaded side and lower auxin on the illuminated side.\n\nIn the described modification, the mica sheet is inserted vertically just below the tip on the illuminated side and does not pass through the entire coleoptile. Therefore, the shaded-side pathway between tip and base is unblocked. Auxin can still move down the shaded side, establishing higher auxin on that side, promoting greater cell elongation there, and producing bending toward the light.\n\nHence, the expected observation is bending toward the light source.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1732623"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have established that a mobile signal, auxin, governs directional growth, we can investigate how this signal moves through the plant. This practice problem simulates an experiment using a chemical inhibitor to block auxin's path, a common technique in modern plant biology. Thinking through this scenario will help you solidify your understanding of polar auxin transportâ€”the unique, directional flow of auxin from the shoot tip to the rest of the plant body [@problem_id:1732591].", "problem": "In vascular plants, the hormone auxin is essential for regulating growth and development. It is primarily synthesized in the shoot apical meristem and young leaves. From these sources, it is actively transported down the stem in a unidirectional process known as polar auxin transport. A primary function of this downward-flowing auxin is to stimulate the elongation of stem cells.\n\nAn experiment is performed on a young, actively growing pea plant. A small ring of lanolin paste containing N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), a chemical that specifically inhibits polar auxin transport, is carefully applied around the plant's main stem, midway between the apex and the ground. The plant is then allowed to grow for another week under ideal conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the changes in auxin concentration and resulting stem growth in the regions immediately above and immediately below the NPA-treated ring, relative to a normal, untreated plant?\n\nA. Above the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth. Below the ring: Increased auxin concentration and stimulated growth.\n\nB. Above the ring: Increased auxin concentration and stimulated growth. Below the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth.\n\nC. Both above and below the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth.\n\nD. Above the ring: No change in auxin concentration, but inhibited growth. Below the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth.\n\nE. Both above and below the ring: No significant change in auxin concentration or growth, as the primary effect of NPA is to inhibit root development.", "solution": "Auxin in stems is synthesized primarily in the shoot apical meristem and young leaves and is transported basipetally (from apex downward) via carrier-mediated polar transport. Let $J$ denote the basipetal auxin flux in a normal stem and let $C_{\\text{above}}$ and $C_{\\text{below}}$ denote the auxin concentrations immediately above and below a position on the stem, respectively. In an untreated plant at steady state, $J>0$ and there is continuous supply of auxin from the apex to lower regions, maintaining $C_{\\text{below}}$ relative to local degradation and diffusion.\n\nN-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) specifically inhibits the efflux carriers (e.g., PIN proteins) that mediate polar auxin transport. Applying an NPA-containing lanolin ring around the stem establishes a barrier to basipetal transport at that position. This sets the net basipetal flux across the ring to approximately zero, i.e., $J_{\\text{across ring}} \\approx 0$.\n\nImmediately above the ring, auxin continues to be synthesized at the apex and transported basipetally until it encounters the blocked interface. Because outflow across the ring is inhibited, the effective efflux from this compartment is reduced. A mass-balance description can be conceptualized as\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{above}}}{dt} = S_{\\text{apex}} - k_{\\text{local}} C_{\\text{above}} - J_{\\text{across ring}},\n$$\nwith $J_{\\text{across ring}} \\approx 0$ under NPA, so relative to the untreated condition (where $J_{\\text{across ring}}=J>0$), $C_{\\text{above}}$ increases. In shoots, increased auxin concentration stimulates cell elongation; therefore growth above the ring is stimulated.\n\nImmediately below the ring, the principal supply from the apex is cut off. A corresponding balance is\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{below}}}{dt} = J_{\\text{across ring}} - k_{\\text{decay}} C_{\\text{below}} + S_{\\text{local}},\n$$\nand with $J_{\\text{across ring}} \\approx 0$ and negligible local auxin synthesis in the lower stem compared to the apex (i.e., $S_{\\text{local}}$ small), $C_{\\text{below}}$ decreases relative to the untreated plant. Auxin promotes stem elongation, so reduced auxin leads to inhibited growth below the ring.\n\nTherefore, relative to a normal plant, auxin accumulates and growth is stimulated above the NPA ring, while auxin decreases and growth is inhibited below it. This pattern matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1732591"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how auxin moves, we now turn to the molecular level to see how plant cells perceive the auxin signal. This problem presents a genetic scenario where the primary auxin receptor, the TIR1 protein, is non-functional. By predicting the whole-plant consequences of this single molecular defect, you can practice connecting the intricate steps of a signaling pathway to observable, large-scale physiological traits like plant height and branching [@problem_id:1732578].", "problem": "In vascular plants, the hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating growth and development. The canonical signaling pathway for auxin involves its perception by a receptor complex. A key component of this receptor is the Transport Inhibitor Response 1 (TIR1) protein, which is part of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In the presence of auxin, the SCF-TIR1 complex targets transcriptional repressor proteins known as Aux/IAA for degradation. This degradation liberates Auxin Response Factor (ARF) transcription factors, which can then activate the expression of auxin-responsive genes, leading to various developmental outcomes such as cell elongation, apical dominance, and lateral root formation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant plant line that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the TIR1 protein. This mutation renders the TIR1 protein completely non-functional, making it unable to bind auxin or participate in the degradation of Aux/IAA repressors. Assuming all other cellular machinery, including the synthesis of auxin and all other signaling components, is normal, which of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the overall phenotype of this mutant plant compared to a wild-type plant?\n\nA. The plant exhibits profound dwarfism, a highly branched or \"bushy\" architecture due to a lack of apical dominance, and a severely reduced number of lateral roots.\n\nB. The plant displays exaggerated height due to enhanced cell elongation, a single unbranched primary stem due to strong apical dominance, and an overproduction of adventitious roots along the stem.\n\nC. The plant grows to a normal height but fails to produce any lateral branches, exhibiting extreme apical dominance, and shows a normal response to gravitational stimuli.\n\nD. The plant is a dwarf but develops a very dense and extensive lateral root system, while maintaining a normal, single-stem growth habit characteristic of strong apical dominance.\n\nE. The plant exhibits a normal shoot architecture and height, but its roots completely fail to respond to gravity, and its leaves are prematurely senescent and yellow.", "solution": "We first restate the canonical auxin signaling mechanism. Auxin is perceived by the SCF-TIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where TIR1 functions as the F-box receptor component. In the presence of auxin, TIR1 binds Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, targeting them for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAA releases Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) from repression, allowing ARFs to activate auxin-responsive genes. These gene programs promote processes such as cell elongation, maintenance of apical dominance, and lateral root initiation.\n\nNext, we consider the stated mutation: a complete loss of function in TIR1 such that TIR1 cannot bind auxin or promote Aux/IAA degradation. Given this, the immediate mechanistic consequence is the constitutive stabilization of Aux/IAA repressors. Because Aux/IAA proteins remain undegraded, ARFs remain repressed, and auxin-responsive gene expression is strongly diminished or abolished, despite normal auxin levels and otherwise intact cellular machinery.\n\nFrom this signaling block, we predict the following physiological outcomes:\n1. Cell elongation: Auxin promotes cell elongation via ARF-dependent induction of gene sets such as SAURs, GH3s, and expansins. With ARFs repressed, these pathways are not activated, leading to severely reduced cell elongation and thus dwarfism.\n2. Apical dominance: In wild-type plants, auxin produced by the shoot apex maintains apical dominance, suppressing lateral bud outgrowth through auxin-responsive signaling. If auxin signaling is blocked upstream at TIR1, the apex cannot exert its normal suppressive effect via ARF activation. This results in loss of apical dominance and a highly branched, bushy architecture.\n3. Lateral root formation: Auxin is essential for lateral root initiation and emergence, notably through ARF-dependent transcriptional activation of downstream regulators in pericycle cells. With Aux/IAA repressors not degraded, ARFs cannot induce lateral root programs, resulting in a severely reduced number of lateral roots.\n\nOther auxin-dependent processes such as tropic responses may also be compromised, but among the provided options, the combination of dwarfism, loss of apical dominance, and reduced lateral roots is the most direct and comprehensive consequence of abolishing TIR1-mediated auxin perception and signaling. Therefore, the description that best matches these mechanistic predictions is a plant that is profoundly dwarfed, bushy due to lack of apical dominance, and has a greatly reduced lateral root system.\n\nHence, option A is the most accurate prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1732578"}]}
