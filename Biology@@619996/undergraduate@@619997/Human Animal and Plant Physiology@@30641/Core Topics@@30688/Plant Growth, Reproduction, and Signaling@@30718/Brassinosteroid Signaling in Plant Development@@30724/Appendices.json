This first exercise [@problem_id:1695177] examines the most fundamental step in the brassinosteroid pathway: the binding of the hormone to its cell-surface receptor, BRI1. By considering a scenario where the receptor is non-functional, you will explore the critical concept of signal perception and understand why a cell's ability to \"hear\" a signal is just as important as the signal itself.", "problem": "Brassinosteroids are a class of plant steroid hormones that are crucial for a wide range of developmental processes, including cell elongation, vascular differentiation, and stress responses. A plant biologist is studying a mutant line of the model organism *Arabidopsis thaliana* that displays a classic brassinosteroid-deficient phenotype: severe dwarfism and dark, curled leaves. Genetic sequencing reveals that this mutant phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the membrane protein BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). In an attempt to rescue the mutant and restore normal growth, the biologist repeatedly applies a solution containing a high concentration of brassinolide, the most biologically active brassinosteroid, to the leaves and stem of the mutant plant. Despite this treatment, the plant remains dwarfed and shows no signs of recovery.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the failure of the external brassinolide application to rescue the mutant phenotype?\n\nA. The high concentration of applied brassinolide causes a strong negative feedback loop that shuts down the expression of key downstream growth-promoting genes.\n\nB. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) is the primary cell-surface receptor for brassinolide. Without a functional receptor, the plant cells are unable to perceive the hormonal signal, preventing the initiation of the downstream signaling cascade required for growth.\n\nC. The externally applied brassinolide cannot bypass the plant's waxy cuticle and is degraded by enzymes before it can reach the target cells in the plant tissues.\n\nD. The loss-of-function mutation in BRI1 leads to the constitutive activation of a different receptor, which sequesters all available brassinolide, preventing it from binding to other necessary co-receptors.\n\nE. Brassinolide must be actively transported into the cell's nucleus to function, and the BRI1 protein is an essential component of this nuclear transport machinery.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most accurate explanation for why a plant with a non-functional BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) protein cannot be rescued by the external application of its ligand, brassinolide. To determine the correct answer, we must first understand the canonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway.\n\n**Step 1: The wild-type brassinosteroid signaling pathway.**\nIn a normal (wild-type) plant, brassinosteroid signaling is initiated at the cell surface.\n1.  The brassinosteroid hormone, such as brassinolide (BL), binds to the extracellular domain of the BRI1 protein, which is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase located in the plasma membrane.\n2.  This binding event induces a conformational change in BRI1, causing it to heterodimerize with its co-receptor, BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1).\n3.  The formation of the BRI1-BAK1 complex triggers a series of trans-phosphorylation events between the two receptor kinases, leading to the full activation of BRI1's cytoplasmic kinase domain.\n4.  Activated BRI1 then phosphorylates other downstream components, initiating a signaling cascade. A key target of this cascade is the kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2).\n5.  The signaling cascade initiated by BRI1 leads to the inactivation of BIN2.\n6.  In its active state (in the absence of a BL signal), BIN2 phosphorylates and marks for degradation the key transcription factors BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1).\n7.  When BIN2 is inactivated by BL signaling, unphosphorylated BZR1 and BES1 accumulate in the nucleus, where they bind to the promoters of target genes and regulate their expression to promote cell elongation and other growth responses.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the mutant scenario.**\nThe problem states the mutant has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding BRI1. This means the plant produces a non-functional BRI1 protein or no BRI1 protein at all. According to the pathway described above, BRI1 is the primary receptor that perceives the brassinolide signal at the cell surface. If the receptor is non-functional, the very first step of the signaling pathway is broken. The cell is effectively \"blind\" to the presence of brassinolide, regardless of its concentration. Even though the hormone is supplied externally in high amounts, it cannot bind to its receptor to initiate the signal. Consequently, the downstream cascade is never activated, BIN2 remains constitutively active, BZR1 and BES1 remain phosphorylated and degraded, and the growth-promoting genes are never expressed. This results in the persistent dwarf phenotype.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of the given options.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This suggests that a negative feedback loop is the cause. While feedback regulation exists in many biological pathways, it is not the primary reason for the failure here. A feedback loop requires an initial signal to be perceived and processed, which is not happening in this mutant. The problem is a complete lack of signal perception, not an altered response to a perceived signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This statement correctly identifies BRI1 as the primary cell-surface receptor and accurately concludes that a non-functional receptor makes the cell unable to perceive the hormone signal. This directly explains why applying the hormone has no effect and why the downstream signaling required for growth is not initiated. This aligns perfectly with our understanding of the pathway and the mutant's condition.\n\n*   **Option C:** This suggests a problem with hormone delivery (penetration and degradation). While these can be practical challenges in applying substances to plants, they are not the fundamental genetic reason for the observed phenotype. The term \"INSENSITIVE\" in the protein's name (BRI1) implies the problem is with perception, not with the absence of the stimulus. Furthermore, the problem states a high concentration was used, which is often done to overcome such delivery barriers. Even if the hormone reached the cells perfectly, the lack of a receptor would still prevent a response. Thus, this is not the root cause.\n\n*   **Option D:** This proposes a complex scenario involving a different activated receptor sequestering the hormone. There is no evidence in the established brassinosteroid signaling pathway for such a mechanism. The loss of BRI1 leads to a loss of signaling, not a redirection or sequestration by another activated receptor in this manner. This option is speculative and inconsistent with the known pathway.\n\n*   **Option E:** This statement claims that brassinolide acts in the nucleus and that BRI1 is part of a nuclear transport system. This is fundamentally incorrect. Brassinosteroids are steroid hormones, but unlike many animal steroid hormones that have intracellular receptors, they are perceived at the cell surface by the BRI1 receptor kinase. The signal is then transduced through a cytoplasmic phosphorylation cascade to the nucleus to regulate transcription factors. The hormone itself does not need to enter the nucleus, and BRI1 is a plasma membrane protein, not a nuclear transporter.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, option B provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the experimental observation. The failure to rescue the phenotype is due to the plant's inability to perceive the hormonal signal because of the non-functional BRI1 receptor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1695177"}, {"introduction": "Once a signal is perceived, the cell must precisely control the resulting downstream cascade. Negative regulators act as crucial brakes, preventing the system from running unchecked. This practice problem [@problem_id:1695167] invites you to predict the consequences of strengthening these brakes by overexpressing the key negative regulator kinase, KIN-N (a stand-in for BIN2). This exercise will deepen your understanding of how the delicate balance between activating and inhibiting components dictates a plant's final growth characteristics.", "problem": "In plant development, Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones that are crucial for promoting cell elongation, division, and differentiation, thereby regulating overall plant size and form. The core signaling pathway for BRs can be simplified as follows:\n\n1.  BR hormone binds to a cell-surface receptor kinase, let's call it BRR1.\n2.  This binding event activates BRR1, which in turn leads to the inhibition of a cytoplasmic protein kinase known as KIN-N, a key negative regulator of the pathway.\n3.  The function of active KIN-N is to phosphorylate and thus inactivate a family of transcription factors, which we will call TF-G.\n4.  When KIN-N is inhibited (in the presence of BR), TF-G transcription factors accumulate in their active, non-phosphorylated form. They then move into the nucleus to activate the expression of numerous growth-promoting genes.\n5.  In the absence of BR, KIN-N is fully active, keeping TF-G inactive and thereby repressing growth.\n\nA team of plant biologists has created a transgenic plant line. This line has been engineered to have a gene that leads to the constitutive, high-level overexpression of the negative regulator kinase, KIN-N. This means that the cells of the transgenic plant produce a much larger amount of KIN-N protein than wild-type plants, irrespective of developmental stage or environmental conditions.\n\nBased on the described signaling pathway, select the option that best predicts the overall growth phenotype of this transgenic plant compared to a non-transgenic (wild-type) plant.\n\nA. The plant will exhibit gigantism, characterized by excessively long stems and larger leaves, as the increased amount of KIN-N amplifies the growth signal.\n\nB. The plant will display a severe dwarf phenotype, with short stems, reduced cell elongation, and dark green leaves. This phenotype will be observed even if the plant is treated with external BR hormones.\n\nC. The plant's phenotype will be indistinguishable from a wild-type plant because the endogenous BR hormone signaling is robust enough to inhibit the excess KIN-N.\n\nD. The plant will grow normally in the presence of BR hormones but will show an enhanced dwarf phenotype compared to wild-type plants in the absence of BR hormones.\n\nE. The plant will exhibit normal stem and leaf growth but will be unable to produce flowers or seeds, indicating a specific defect in reproductive development.", "solution": "We translate the pathway into signed regulatory relationships. BR binds and activates the receptor kinase BRR1. Activated BRR1 inhibits the cytoplasmic kinase KIN-N. KIN-N phosphorylates TF-G, and phosphorylation inactivates TF-G. Active, non-phosphorylated TF-G moves to the nucleus to induce growth-promoting genes. Therefore, in terms of net regulatory signs: BRR1 activation $\\rightarrow$ inhibition of KIN-N; KIN-N activation $\\rightarrow$ inhibition of TF-G activity; TF-G activity $\\rightarrow$ activation of growth gene expression and growth.\n\nDefine $K$ as the effective level or activity of KIN-N, and let $T^{*}$ denote the active, non-phosphorylated TF-G pool. Qualitatively, $T^{*}$ is a decreasing function of $K$ because KIN-N directly inactivates TF-G by phosphorylation. BR signaling reduces the effective activity of KIN-N. Representing this qualitatively, in the presence of BR, the effective KIN-N activity is reduced to $\\alpha K$ with $0<\\alpha<1$, while in the absence of BR it is $K$. Thus, $T^{*}$ increases with BR because KIN-N is inhibited, and decreased KIN-N activity leads to accumulation of active TF-G and growth gene expression.\n\nNow consider constitutive, high-level overexpression of KIN-N in the transgenic line. Let the overexpressed KIN-N activity be $K'$, where $K' \\gg K$ for the wild type. In the absence of BR, the effective KIN-N activity is $K'$; since $T^{*}$ is a decreasing function of KIN-N activity, $T^{*}$ is strongly reduced, leading to repression of growth genes and dwarfism. In the presence of BR, the receptor still inhibits KIN-N, but the effective activity is only reduced to $\\alpha K'$. When $K'$ is constitutively very large, even $\\alpha K'$ remains large relative to wild-type $K$, so $T^{*}$ remains low; TF-G remains largely phosphorylated and inactive, and growth-promoting transcription stays repressed. Therefore, the overexpression of the negative regulator is epistatic to BR addition, producing a BR-insensitive dwarf phenotype.\n\nEvaluate the options accordingly:\n- Option A is incorrect because KIN-N is a negative regulator; increasing its level does not amplify growth, it suppresses it.\n- Option B is correct. Overexpressed KIN-N maintains TF-G in the inactive, phosphorylated state, causing severe dwarfism with reduced cell elongation; high KIN-N renders the plant insensitive to exogenous BR because BR cannot sufficiently inhibit the excess KIN-N.\n- Option C is incorrect; endogenous BR signaling will not fully compensate for a constitutively high negative regulator, and BR-insensitive dwarf phenotypes are well documented for overactive KIN-N analogs.\n- Option D is incorrect; the transgenic line would not grow normally even with BR because the excess KIN-N still keeps TF-G largely inactivated.\n- Option E is incorrect; the predicted defect is general growth repression, not an isolated reproductive defect.\n\nThus, the best prediction is a severe, BR-insensitive dwarf phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1695167"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a signaling pathway at the molecular level allows us to ask bigger questions about an organism's physiology.

By analyzing radioactivity and gene expression levels, you will practice drawing evidence-based conclusions that connect the molecular details of BR signaling to the whole-plant level.", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the signaling range of Brassinosteroids (BRs), a class of plant steroid hormones essential for growth and development. A key question is whether BRs act systemically (transported long distances to act on remote tissues) or locally (acting primarily within the tissue where they are synthesized). To address this, an experiment is conducted using a genetically modified *Arabidopsis thaliana* plant, the `det2` mutant, which is deficient in its own BR biosynthesis.\n\nA solution containing Carbon-14 labeled brassinolide ($^{14}$C-BL), the most active BR, is carefully applied to the surface of a single mature leaf (termed the 'source leaf'). After 48 hours, the plant is dissected into different parts: the treated source leaf, an adjacent non-treated leaf, the shoot apex, and the roots. For each part, two measurements are taken:\n1.  **Radioactivity**: The amount of $^{14}$C is measured using a scintillation counter and reported in Counts Per Minute per milligram of tissue (CPM/mg). This indicates the concentration of the applied $^{14}$C-BL or its labeled metabolites.\n2.  **Gene Expression**: The expression level of `EXPANSIN A8` (`EXP8`), a well-known BR-responsive gene, is measured using quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The results are presented as the fold-change in expression relative to a control `det2` plant that received a mock treatment (a solution without $^{14}$C-BL). A fold-change of 1.0 indicates no change from the baseline.\n\nThe experimental data are summarized in the table below:\n\n| Tissue Sample     | Radioactivity (CPM/mg) | `EXP8` Gene Expression (Fold Change) |\n|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Source Leaf       | 12500                  | 95.0                                 |\n| Adjacent Leaf     | 150                    | 2.1                                  |\n| Shoot Apex        | 80                     | 1.8                                  |\n| Roots             | 10                     | 1.1                                  |\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions is the most scientifically sound?\n\nA. Brassinosteroids are exclusively synthesized and act in the same tissue, with no transport between tissues whatsoever.\n\nB. Brassinosteroids are synthesized in leaves and transported systemically in large quantities to all parts of the plant, where they elicit a strong physiological response.\n\nC. Brassinosteroids primarily act locally near their site of application or synthesis, and while a small amount may be transported long-distance, it is generally insufficient to trigger a strong physiological response in distant tissues.\n\nD. The physiological response to brassinosteroids is independent of their local concentration, as radioactivity is detected in distant tissues without a correspondingly strong gene expression response.\n\nE. The `det2` mutant is physiologically insensitive to brassinosteroids, and the observed results are likely due to experimental artifacts.", "solution": "Define $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ as radioactivity in CPM per mg and $G_{\\text{tissue}}$ as the fold-change in gene expression for each tissue. From the data: $R_{\\text{source}}=12500$, $R_{\\text{adjacent}}=150$, $R_{\\text{apex}}=80$, $R_{\\text{roots}}=10$; and $G_{\\text{source}}=95.0$, $G_{\\text{adjacent}}=2.1$, $G_{\\text{apex}}=1.8$, $G_{\\text{roots}}=1.1$.\n\nStep 1: Determine whether any transport occurs by checking for nonzero $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ outside the source leaf. Since $R_{\\text{adjacent}}>0$, $R_{\\text{apex}}>0$, and $R_{\\text{roots}}>0$, there is detectable movement of applied $^{14}\\text{C}$-BL or its labeled metabolites from the source leaf to other tissues. Therefore, the hypothesis of no transport whatsoever is falsified.\n\nStep 2: Quantify the extent of transport relative to the source by computing ratios:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{adjacent}}}{R_{\\text{source}}}=\\frac{150}{12500}=1.2 \\times 10^{-2},\\quad \\frac{R_{\\text{apex}}}{R_{\\text{source}}}=\\frac{80}{12500}=6.4 \\times 10^{-3},\\quad \\frac{R_{\\text{roots}}}{R_{\\text{source}}}=\\frac{10}{12500}=8.0 \\times 10^{-4}.$$\nThese values show that distant tissues receive between $8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ of the source-leaf radiolabel per mg, i.e., orders of magnitude less than the source.\n\nStep 3: Compare local concentration with physiological response by examining $G_{\\text{tissue}}$. The source leaf with the highest $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ shows a very strong response $G_{\\text{source}}=95.0$. Tissues with much lower $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ show modest responses: $G_{\\text{adjacent}}=2.1$, $G_{\\text{apex}}=1.8$, and near-baseline $G_{\\text{roots}}=1.1$. The monotonic relationship between $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ and $G_{\\text{tissue}}$ supports a concentration-dependent response rather than a response independent of local concentration.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options logically against the evidence.\n- Option A (no transport): contradicted by $R_{\\text{adjacent}}$, $R_{\\text{apex}}$, and $R_{\\text{roots}}$ being nonzero.\n- Option B (large systemic transport with strong responses everywhere): contradicted by the small $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ in distant tissues and only modest or negligible $G_{\\text{tissue}}$ outside the source.\n- Option D (response independent of local concentration): contradicted by the clear positive association between higher $R_{\\text{tissue}}$ and higher $G_{\\text{tissue}}$.\n- Option E (det2 insensitive or artifacts): contradicted by the very large $G_{\\text{source}}=95.0$, demonstrating robust BR responsiveness in det2 when BR is supplied.\n- Option C (primarily local action with limited long-distance transport insufficient for strong distal response): supported by the data showing strong local accumulation and response, minimal distal accumulation, and only modest distal responses.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound conclusion is that brassinosteroids primarily act locally, with limited long-distance movement that typically does not elicit strong physiological responses in distant tissues.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1695117"}]}
