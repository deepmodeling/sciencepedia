This particular cultivar has a critical night length of 10 hours, meaning it requires a period of uninterrupted darkness of at least this duration to initiate flowering.\n\nThe researchers set up five different experimental growth chambers. In all chambers, the plants are initially subjected to a baseline photoperiod consisting of 13 hours of light and 11 hours of darkness. The following modifications are made during the middle of the 11-hour dark period:\n\n*   **Treatment 1:** The 11-hour dark period is left completely uninterrupted.\n*   **Treatment 2:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief, intense flash of red light (R).\n*   **Treatment 3:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief, intense flash of far-red light (FR).\n*   **Treatment 4:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief flash of red light (R) immediately followed by a brief flash of far-red light (FR).\n*   **Treatment 5:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief flash of far-red light (FR) immediately followed by a brief flash of red light (R).\n\nAssuming all other growth conditions (temperature, humidity, nutrients) are optimal, which of the experimental treatments would be expected to result in the soybean plants flowering?\n\nA. Treatments 1 and 4 only\n\nB. Treatments 2 and 5 only\n\nC. Treatments 1, 3, and 4\n\nD. Treatments 3 and 5 only\n\nE. All treatments", "solution": "Given a short-day plant (SDP) with critical night length $N_{c}=10$ hours, flowering requires an uninterrupted dark interval of duration at least $N_{c}$ under which the phytochrome system remains in a non-inhibitory state. The phytochrome photoreversibility is:\n$$\nP_{r} \\xrightarrow{R} P_{fr}, \\qquad P_{fr} \\xrightarrow{FR} P_{r}.\n$$\nFor SDPs, $P_{fr}$ is inhibitory to flowering, while a low $P_{fr}$ (i.e., high $P_{r}$) state during the night permits flowering.\n\nBaseline photoperiod is $13$ hours light and $11$ hours dark, so without interruption $N=11 \\geq N_{c}$ and flowering occurs.\n\nEvaluate each treatment:\n\n- Treatment 1 (uninterrupted $11$-hour dark): There is a single continuous dark interval of length $11 \\geq 10$ hours, and $P_{fr}$ decays during the dark. Expect flowering.\n\n- Treatment 2 (red flash in middle): The red flash converts $P_{r}\\to P_{fr}$, provides a night-break signal, and splits the dark into two intervals each shorter than $10$ hours. The $P_{fr}$ state is inhibitory. Expect no flowering.\n\n- Treatment 3 (far-red flash in middle): The far-red flash converts any remaining $P_{fr}\\to P_{r}$. A brief FR pulse does not produce the inhibitory red night-break effect and leaves the system in the permissive $P_{r}$ state. The effective long night is not nullified. Expect flowering.\n\n- Treatment 4 (red followed by far-red): $R$ sets $P_{fr}$ (inhibitory), and immediate $FR$ reverses it to $P_{r}$, thereby cancelling the red night-break effect. Expect flowering.\n\n- Treatment 5 (far-red followed by red): $FR$ sets $P_{r}$, but subsequent $R$ converts to inhibitory $P_{fr}$, acting as a night break. Expect no flowering.\n\nThus, flowering occurs in Treatments 1, 3, and 4, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1728109"}, {"introduction": "While we often classify plants as simply 'long-day' or 'short-day,' these labels can sometimes oversimplify a more elegant reality. A more precise understanding is that many plants are actually measuring the length of the uninterrupted night. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1728075] utilizes a cleverly designed, non-standard light cycle to challenge the intuitive idea of 'day length,' reinforcing the critical concept that the duration of continuous darkness is the true environmental cue that governs flowering in many species.", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the flowering mechanism in a species of Arabidopsis, which is a long-day plant. It is known that this particular species requires a day length of at least 14 hours to initiate flowering when grown under a standard 24-hour light/dark cycle.\n\nThe botanist prepares an experiment where a set of these plants is grown in a specialized chamber under a non-standard, 24-hour lighting schedule. The daily cycle consists of 7.5 hours of light, followed by 1 hour of darkness, followed by another 7.5 hours of light, which is then followed by a final, longer period of darkness that completes the 24-hour cycle.\n\nBased on the modern understanding of photoperiodic timekeeping in plants, which of the following outcomes is expected, and for what reason?\n\nA. The plant will flower because the total duration of light per cycle (15 hours) is greater than its critical photoperiod of 14 hours.\n\nB. The plant will not flower because the longest continuous light period (7.5 hours) is less than the critical photoperiod of 14 hours.\n\nC. The plant will flower because the longest continuous period of darkness is shorter than the plant's critical night length.\n\nD. The plant will not flower because the interruption of the photoperiod by an hour of darkness resets the plant's internal clock, preventing flowering.\n\nE. The plant will not flower because the total duration of darkness per cycle (9 hours) is sufficiently long to inhibit flowering.", "solution": "Let the plantâ€™s critical photoperiod be $P_{c} = 14\\,\\text{h}$ under a $24\\,\\text{h}$ cycle. For long-day plants, the decisive variable is the continuous night length $N$ relative to a critical night length $N_{c}$, where under a $24\\,\\text{h}$ cycle:\n$$\nN_{c} = 24 - P_{c}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given $P_{c}$,\n$$\nN_{c} = 24 - 14 = 10\\,\\text{h}.\n$$\n\nIn the experimental schedule, the daily sequence is: $7.5\\,\\text{h}$ light, $1\\,\\text{h}$ dark, $7.5\\,\\text{h}$ light, then a final dark period that completes $24\\,\\text{h}$.

This matches the statement that the plant will flower because the longest continuous period of darkness is shorter than the critical night length, corresponding to option C. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they rely respectively on total light duration, longest continuous light duration, an incorrect clock-reset premise, and total darkness per cycle rather than the longest continuous dark interval.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1728075"}, {"introduction": "Once a plant perceives the correct environmental signal to flower, what happens next? Is the plant instantly and permanently committed to this new developmental path? This practice [@problem_id:1728111] explores the concept of floral induction and the generation of a mobile signal, historically named 'florigen.' You will analyze a scenario to determine whether a single, sufficient inductive stimulus is enough to trigger an irreversible cascade, causing the plant to flower even after it has been returned to non-inductive conditions.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is studying a species of short-day plant. This type of plant initiates flowering only when the duration of the daily dark period exceeds a specific critical night length. The particular species in this experiment is known to have a critical night length of 11 hours.\n\nThe plant is initially grown from a seedling under a consistent, non-inductive light regime consisting of a 16-hour light period followed by an 8-hour dark period each day. Once the plant is mature and has several fully developed leaves, the physiologist subjects it to a single, carefully controlled inductive cycle: one 8-hour light period followed by one continuous, uninterrupted 16-hour dark period. Immediately following this single long-night treatment, the plant is returned to the original non-inductive regime (16 hours light, 8 hours dark) for the rest of its lifespan.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome for this plant?\n\nA. The plant will not flower because a sustained period of multiple, consecutive long nights is required to induce flowering.\n\nB. The plant will initiate and complete the flowering process because a single, sufficient inductive stimulus triggers a stable, transmissible signal that commits the apical meristems to reproduction.\n\nC. The plant will begin to develop flower buds, but these buds will fail to develop fully and will revert to vegetative shoots because the plant is no longer in an inductive environment.\n\nD. Only the specific leaves that were exposed to the long night will attempt to produce flowers, while the rest of the plant remains vegetative.\n\nE. The plant will not flower because the apical meristem itself must directly perceive the long-night stimulus for flowering to be initiated.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the photoperiodic requirement. A short-day (long-night) plant flowers only when a single continuous night exceeds its critical night length. The given species has a critical night length of $11$ hours.\n\nStep 2: Classify the initial regime. The plant is initially under a $16$-hour light and $8$-hour dark cycle. Since the dark period is $8<11$ hours, this regime is non-inductive for this short-day plant.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the inductive treatment. The plant then experiences one cycle of $8$ hours light followed by $16$ hours continuous dark. Because the dark period is uninterrupted and $16>11$ hours, this single night is inductive.\n\nStep 4: Determine the site of perception and signal generation. In photoperiodism, the leaves are the sites of light/dark perception (via phytochrome and the circadian system). The problem states the plant has several fully developed leaves at the time of treatment, which enables proper perception and response. Following an inductive night, leaves synthesize a transmissible floral stimulus (florigen, classically associated with FT protein), which is transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristems.\n\nStep 5: Commitment of the meristem. The florigenic signal commits the apical meristems to reproductive development (floral evocation). This commitment is stable; after evocation, the meristems proceed through floral development even if returned to non-inductive photoperiods. Thus, a single sufficient inductive cycle can initiate and lead to completion of flowering in many short-day plants.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because multiple consecutive long nights are not universally required; a single uninterrupted inductive night can suffice for flowering induction in short-day plants.\n- B is correct: a single sufficient inductive stimulus in the leaves generates a stable, transmissible signal that commits apical meristems, allowing initiation and completion of flowering despite subsequent non-inductive conditions.\n- C is incorrect because once floral evocation occurs, the meristems do not typically revert to vegetative growth simply due to return to non-inductive photoperiods.\n- D is incorrect because flowering is not restricted to regions near leaves that perceived the signal; the florigen moves systemically to apical meristems throughout the plant.\n- E is incorrect because the apical meristem does not need to directly perceive the long night; perception occurs in leaves.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1728111"}]}
