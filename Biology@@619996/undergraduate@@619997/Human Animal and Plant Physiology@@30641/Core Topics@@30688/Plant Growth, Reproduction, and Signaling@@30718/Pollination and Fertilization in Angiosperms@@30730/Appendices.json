Its grain is a primary source of carbohydrates for human nutrition, with the bulk of the stored nutrients found in a tissue called the endosperm. Sexual reproduction in wheat, as in other flowering plants (angiosperms), involves the formation of a seed, which contains both the plant embryo and the nutritive endosperm tissue. Consider a specific cultivar of wheat where the somatic (non-reproductive) cells are diploid, containing a total of 42 chromosomes. Assuming a typical angiosperm life cycle involving double fertilization, determine the total number of chromosomes present in a single nucleus of a cell from the endosperm tissue of this wheat cultivar.", "solution": "In angiosperms, double fertilization produces a diploid embryo and a typically triploid endosperm. The endosperm nucleus forms by the fusion of one sperm nucleus ($n$) with the two haploid polar nuclei ($n + n$) of the central cell, giving a ploidy of $n + n + n = 3n$.\n\nFor this wheat cultivar, somatic cells are diploid with $2n = 42$. Thus the haploid number is\n$$\nn = \\frac{2n}{2} = 21.\n$$\nTherefore, the chromosome number in a single nucleus of an endosperm cell is\n$$\n3n = 3 \\times 21 = 63,\n$$\nequivalently,\n$$\n3n = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 2n = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 42 = 63.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63}$$", "id": "1735371"}, {"introduction": "To understand the evolution and ecology of flowering plants, we must investigate their breeding systemsâ€”whether they self-pollinate or require pollen from another individual. Biologists use carefully designed experiments to answer this question, manipulating flowers to isolate different reproductive pathways. This problem challenges you to think like a field botanist by interpreting the results of a classic bagging experiment, using logical deduction to uncover a plant's mating strategy from experimental data. [@problem_id:2278431]", "problem": "A botanist is studying the reproductive biology of a newly discovered angiosperm species, *Botanica investigata*. The flowers of this species are perfect, meaning they contain both male (stamens) and female (pistil) reproductive organs. To determine the plant's breeding system, the botanist conducts an experiment on 400 flowers across several individuals. The flowers are divided into four equal groups of 100.\n\n- **Group 1 (Control):** Flowers were left untouched and exposed to the natural environment, where various insects were observed visiting the flowers.\n- **Group 2 (Bagging):** Flowers were enclosed in fine-mesh bags before their stigmas became receptive. The bags prevented insects from visiting but allowed air and light to pass through.\n- **Group 3 (Emasculation and Bagging):** Before the flowers opened, their stamens were carefully removed (a process called emasculation). The flowers were then immediately enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n- **Group 4 (Emasculation and Hand-Pollination):** Flowers were emasculated as in Group 3. Once their stigmas became receptive, they were manually dusted with pollen collected from a different plant of the same species located 100 meters away. After hand-pollination, the flowers were also enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n\nAfter several weeks, the botanist recorded the number of flowers in each group that successfully developed into mature fruits containing seeds. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Group 1:** 82 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 2:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 3:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 4:** 89 flowers developed into fruit.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely conclusion about the breeding system of *Botanica investigata*?\n\nA. The plant is an obligate self-pollinator and depends on wind, not insects, for pollination.\n\nB. The plant is capable of both self-pollination and cross-pollination, but cross-pollination is more successful.\n\nC. The plant reproduces asexually through a process like apomixis, where seeds develop without fertilization.\n\nD. The plant is an obligate cross-pollinator (outcrosser) and likely has a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nE. The experiment is flawed, as the process of bagging damaged the flowers, preventing any fruit development.", "solution": "We analyze each treatment against the predictions of different breeding systems.\n\n1. Interpretations of the treatments:\n- Group 1 (control, open to visitors): If the plant is animal-pollinated and compatible with cross-pollen, we expect substantial fruit set due to natural pollination.\n- Group 2 (bagged, intact flowers): If the plant can self-fertilize autonomously (autogamy) or reproduce asexually (apomixis), some fruit should set without pollinators. If it is wind-pollinated and the mesh allows airborne pollen, some fruit might also set. If it is obligately outcrossing and self-incompatible, with no pollinator access, fruit set should be near zero.\n- Group 3 (emasculated and bagged): With stamens removed and no pollen applied, only apomixis could yield fruit; otherwise, fruit set should be zero.\n- Group 4 (emasculated, hand-crossed, bagged): If cross-pollen is compatible, fruit set should be high; this also tests that bagging itself does not prevent fruit development.\n\n2. Match observations to predictions:\n- Group 2 yielded $0/100$ fruits. This rules out autonomous selfing and strongly argues against apomixis. It also argues against obligate wind pollination as the sole mechanism because, with air movement permitted, at least some fruit might be expected if wind-borne pollen could reach stigmas; moreover, the decisive comparison is with Group 4 (see below), which shows the bags themselves did not prevent fertilization or fruit development once compatible pollen was applied.\n- Group 3 yielded $0/100$ fruits, which directly rules out apomixis (no seeds without fertilization).\n- Group 4 yielded $89/100$ fruits after manual application of cross-pollen, demonstrating that outcross pollen is fully compatible and that the bagging treatment did not damage flowers or prevent fruit development.\n- Group 1 yielded $82/100$ fruits under natural visitation, consistent with effective animal-mediated pollination; the slightly lower value than Group 4 suggests natural pollination is somewhat limited compared to controlled hand-crossing, as is commonly observed.\n\n3. Synthesize the breeding system inference:\n- The complete absence of fruit in Group 2 despite the presence of anthers and stigmas within the same bag excludes autonomous selfing and, coupled with the success of hand-crossing in Group 4, points to a requirement for outcross pollen.\n- The success of Group 4 combined with the failure of Group 2 is most parsimoniously explained by self-incompatibility: self-pollen fails to fertilize, whereas cross-pollen succeeds.\n- The success of Group 1 with insect visitation identifies biotic pollination (insect pollinators) as the natural mechanism; bagging did not itself preclude fruit set once compatible pollen was supplied (Group 4), so the lack of fruit in Group 2 is not due to bag damage.\n\n4. Eliminate incorrect options:\n- A is contradicted by the lack of fruit in Group 2 and the success with insect access in Group 1; also, Group 4 shows bagging does not prevent fruit set once compatible pollen is present.\n- B is not supported because there is no evidence of successful selfing; Group 2 shows no autonomous selfing, and no treatment demonstrates successful self-pollination.\n- C is ruled out by $0/100$ in Groups 2 and 3.\n- E is ruled out because Group 4 fruits developed despite bagging.\n\nTherefore, the data support that the species is an obligate outcrosser, likely with a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2278431"}, {"introduction": "The journey of a pollen tube from the stigma to the ovule is a remarkable feat of rapid, targeted cell growth, but this journey requires a substantial energy investment.
