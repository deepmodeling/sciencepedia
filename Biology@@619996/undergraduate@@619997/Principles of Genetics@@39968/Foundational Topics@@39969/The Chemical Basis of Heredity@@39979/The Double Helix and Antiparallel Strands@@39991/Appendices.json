Let's break down the process of finding the correct complementary strand step-by-step and then analyze Charles's mistake.\n\nThe original template strand is given as 5'-GCAATTCGGT-3'.\n\n**Step 1: Apply Complementary Base Pairing**\nThe first principle of DNA double helix formation is complementary base pairing. Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C). We apply this rule to each base in the template strand to find the sequence of bases on the complementary strand.\n- G pairs with C\n- C pairs with G\n- A pairs with T\n- A pairs with T\n- T pairs with A\n- T pairs with A\n- C pairs with G\n- G pairs with C\n- G pairs with C\n- T pairs with A\n\nFollowing the template strand from the 5' end, the sequence of complementary bases is: C, G, T, T, A, A, G, C, C, A. So the sequence of the complementary strand is CGTTAAGCCA. This is the sequence that Charles correctly identified.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Antiparallel Principle**\nThe second fundamental principle of the DNA double helix structure is that the two strands are **antiparallel**. This means that they run in opposite directions. If the template strand has a 5' to 3' polarity, its complementary strand must have a 3' to 5' polarity.\n\nSo, by aligning the complementary bases against the template strand, we get the correctly oriented complementary strand:\n\nTemplate:     5'-GCAATTCGGT-3'\nComplement:   3'-CGTTAAGCCA-5'\n\nThis, 3'-CGTTAAGCCA-5', is the correct, full description of the complementary strand.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Charles's Answer and Identify the Error**\nCharles's proposed answer is 5'-CGTTAAGCCA-3'.\n- He correctly identified the base sequence: CGTTAAGCCA.\n- However, he assigned it a 5' to 3' orientation.\n\nThis implies a structure where both strands run in the same direction:\nTemplate:     5'-GCAATTCGGT-3'\nCharles's ans:  5'-CGTTAAGCCA-3'  (Incorrect: implies parallel strands)\n\nThis proposed structure is **parallel**, not **antiparallel**. The fundamental principle that Charles failed to apply is that the two strands of a DNA double helix are antiparallel.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n- A. The phosphodiester bonds linking the nucleotides can only form in the 3' to 5' direction. This is incorrect. DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA by adding nucleotides to the 3' end, so the strand grows in the 5' to 3' direction. This statement is factually wrong and doesn't directly address the orientation error.\n- B. One strand of a DNA molecule contains only purines, while the complementary strand contains only pyrimidines. This is incorrect. The given template strand 5'-GCAATTCGGT-3' contains both purines (G, A) and pyrimidines (C, T).\n- C. The two strands of a DNA double helix are antiparallel, meaning their 5' to 3' orientations run in opposite directions. This statement correctly describes the principle that Charles overlooked. His answer implicitly assumes a parallel structure, demonstrating a failure to apply the antiparallel rule.\n- D. The hydrogen bonds between Guanine and Cytosine are stronger than those between Adenine and Thymine, causing the strand to twist. While it is true that G-C pairs have three hydrogen bonds and A-T pairs have two, this fact relates to the stability and melting temperature of DNA, not the relative orientation or directionality of the two strands.\n- E. The complementary strand must be an exact copy of the template strand, but with Uracil replacing Thymine. This describes the process of transcription into RNA, not DNA replication. It is fundamentally incorrect for forming a DNA double helix.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best identifies the principle Charles failed to apply is C. He correctly found the complementary bases but failed to reverse the orientation of the strand to make it antiparallel to the template.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526600"}, {"introduction": "Building on the structural rules, this problem moves into the quantitative application of Erwin Chargaff's findings.
