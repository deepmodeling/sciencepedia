A single tRNA species can sometimes recognize multiple codons due to flexible base pairing at the third position of the codon (which corresponds to the 5' position of the tRNA anticodon). For this organism, the allowed base pairings between the 5' base of the tRNA anticodon and the 3' base of the mRNA codon are strictly defined as:\n- Anticodon G can pair with Codon U or C.\n- Anticodon C can pair with Codon G only.\n- Anticodon U can pair with Codon A or G.\n- Anticodon I (Inosine, which is enzymatically modified from Adenosine in the tRNA) can pair with Codon U, C, or A.\n\nAssuming that each required tRNA is specific for only one amino acid, what is the minimum total number of distinct tRNA species that must be present in this synthetic organism to translate all of the specified codons for these four amino acids?", "solution": "We use the wobble base pairing rules specified for the 5' base of the tRNA anticodon pairing with the 3' base of the mRNA codon:\n- Anticodon $G$ pairs with codon $U$ or $C$.\n- Anticodon $C$ pairs with codon $G$ only.\n- Anticodon $U$ pairs with codon $A$ or $G$.\n- Anticodon $I$ pairs with codon $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n\nTranslation fidelity at the first two codon positions is assumed to require standard Watson–Crick pairing, so a tRNA with fixed anticodon positions for the first two bases can only read codons sharing the same first two bases. Therefore, minimization can be done independently for each amino acid’s codon family defined by its first two bases.\n\nDefine, for a given amino acid with codons $XYN$, the set of third-position bases used as $S=\\{N\\}$.
