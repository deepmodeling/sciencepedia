This exercise [@problem_id:1496274] challenges you to explore this foundational concept by considering a flawed, alternative experimental setup, reinforcing the critical importance of selecting a unique biochemical marker.", "problem": "The Hershey-Chase experiment, a cornerstone of molecular biology, was designed to determine whether protein or Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) functions as the genetic material. The researchers used bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, and took advantage of the distinct elemental composition of proteins and DNA. They prepared two batches of phages: one where the protein coats were labeled with the radioactive isotope of sulfur ($^{\\text{35}}\\text{S}$), and another where the DNA core was labeled with the radioactive isotope of phosphorus ($^{\\text{32}}\\text{P}$).\n\nSuppose a contemporary scientist, unfamiliar with the specific details of the original experiment, decides to repeat this classic study. Instead of using sulfur and phosphorus, they propose using the radioactive isotope of carbon, $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$, to label the phage components before infection. Which of the following statements best explains why this experimental design is fundamentally flawed and would lead to an ambiguous result?\n\nA. The half-life of $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ is far too long to be practical for detecting radioactivity within the timeframe of a typical bacterial infection experiment.\n\nB. Carbon is a key component of the phage's protein coat but is not present in the molecular structure of its DNA.\n\nC. Carbon is a key component of the phage's DNA but is not present in the molecular structure of its protein coat.\n\nD. Carbon is an essential structural element in both the amino acids that form proteins and the nucleotides that form DNA, preventing differential labeling.\n\nE. Carbon is a chemically inert element and its radioactive isotope, $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$, cannot be incorporated into a phage's biological macromolecules.", "solution": "1) Experimental principle: A differential labeling experiment requires an isotopic label that is incorporated into one molecular species but not the other, so that after infection and separation of phage coats from bacterial cells, radioactivity can be unambiguously assigned to either protein or DNA. In the Hershey-Chase design, $^{\\text{35}}\\text{S}$ labels protein because sulfur is present in certain amino acids (cysteine and methionine) but absent from DNA, while $^{\\text{32}}\\text{P}$ labels DNA because phosphorus is present in the phosphate backbone of nucleotides and generally absent from protein.\n\n2) Elemental composition logic: Proteins are polymers of amino acids whose backbones and side chains contain carbon; DNA is a polymer of nucleotides (sugar, base, phosphate), and both the sugar and the base contain carbon. Therefore, carbon is an essential structural element in both proteins and DNA.\n\n3) Consequence for $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ labeling: Because both proteins and DNA incorporate carbon, using $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ would label both the protein coat and the DNA core simultaneously. This prevents differential labeling and yields an ambiguous outcome, since radioactivity detected in either the supernatant or the pellet could originate from either macromolecule.\n\n4) Evaluation of the options:\n- A: Although $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ has a long half-life, that does not fundamentally preclude detection; sensitivity can be addressed by specific activity and detection methods. This is not the core flaw.\n- B and C: Both are false because carbon is present in both proteins and DNA.\n- D: Correct. Carbon is in both amino acids and nucleotides, so $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ cannot differentially label protein versus DNA.\n- E: False. $^{\\text{14}}\\text{C}$ is chemically incorporated like stable carbon isotopes.\n\n5) Conclusion: The design is fundamentally flawed because carbon is not unique to either protein or DNA, preventing differential labeling; thus option D is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1496274"}, {"introduction": "Moving from experimental design to data interpretation requires a quantitative mindset. Real-world experiments are never perfect, and understanding the results means accounting for the realities of each step, from phage attachment to blending. This practice [@problem_id:1496315] challenges you to create a precise quantitative model of the experiment by tracking the radiolabeled DNA through a multi-stage process, providing insight into how experimental inefficiencies influence the final data.", "problem": "A molecular biology lab is conducting a modern version of the Hershey-Chase experiment to demonstrate that Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is the genetic material. They use a culture of bacteriophages where the DNA has been exclusively labeled with the radioactive isotope Phosphorus-32 ($^{\\text{32}}\\text{P}$). The protein coats of these phages are non-radioactive.\n\nThe experiment proceeds as follows:\n1. The radiolabeled phage population is mixed with a culture of non-radioactive host bacteria and incubated to allow for infection.\n2. The mixture is then agitated in a blender to shear phage particles from the surface of the bacterial cells.\n3. The entire mixture is centrifuged, which separates the larger bacterial cells into a pellet at the bottom of the tube, while the smaller, free phage particles and sheared-off phage coats remain in the liquid supernatant.\n\nThe lab's equipment and protocols are known to have specific inefficiencies. Based on prior calibration experiments, the following has been determined:\n- **Attachment Efficiency:** 80.0% of the initial phage population successfully attaches to a bacterial cell. The remaining 20.0% do not attach and remain free in the medium.\n- **Injection Efficiency:** Of the phages that successfully attach, 90.0% successfully inject their DNA into the host bacterium. The remaining 10.0% of attached phages fail to inject their DNA.\n- **Shearing Inefficiency:** The blending process is imperfect. It successfully shears off 95.0% of all *attached* phage particles (both those that injected their DNA and those that did not). The remaining 5.0% of attached phage particles remain physically stuck to the bacterial cells, regardless of whether they injected their DNA.\n\nAssuming that the centrifugation step perfectly separates all bacterial cells (and anything attached to them) into the pellet, calculate the percentage of the *total initial* $^{\\text{32}}\\text{P}$ radioactivity that is expected to be found in the bacterial pellet. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the total initial radioactivity be $R_{0}$.
