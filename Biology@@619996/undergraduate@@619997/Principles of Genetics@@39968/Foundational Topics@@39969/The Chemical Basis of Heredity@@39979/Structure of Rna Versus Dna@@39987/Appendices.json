This exercise provides foundational practice in applying Watson-Crick pairing rules to a hybrid molecule, a structure vital for processes like transcription and reverse transcription. By meticulously counting the hydrogen bonds, you will reinforce your understanding of how Guanine-Cytosine ($G-C$) pairs contribute more to thermal stability than Adenine-Thymine ($A-T$) or Adenine-Uracil ($A-U$) pairs [@problem_id:1523624].", "problem": "In molecular biology, the structure and stability of nucleic acid duplexes are largely determined by the hydrogen bonds formed between complementary base pairs. A Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule typically consists of the bases Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). A Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule contains Uracil (U) in place of Thymine. The Watson-Crick base pairing rules are as follows:\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C), forming three hydrogen bonds.\n- In a DNA:DNA duplex, Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), forming two hydrogen bonds.\n- In an RNA:RNA duplex or an RNA:DNA hybrid, Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) or Thymine (T) respectively, in both cases forming two hydrogen bonds.\n\nConsider a short, single-stranded RNA molecule with the sequence 5'-GCAU-3'. This molecule anneals perfectly to its complementary single-stranded DNA molecule to form a stable RNA:DNA hybrid duplex.

This exercise challenges you to analyze an RNA sequence to find its most stable secondary structure, which is achieved by maximizing the number of hydrogen bonds in a contiguous stem region [@problem_id:1523618]. Mastering this skill is crucial for understanding how RNA can function as an enzyme (ribozyme) or a regulatory molecule.", "problem": "A single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecule, found in a newly discovered extremophilic virus, has the sequence 5'-GCCAUGAAGCUUCAUGGC-3'. When this molecule is placed in a suitable aqueous buffer, it is known to fold into its most stable secondary structure by forming intramolecular base pairs. Assuming that base pairing occurs exclusively through standard Watson-Crick interactions, where Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) and Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U), and that the overall stability of the structure is maximized by forming the longest possible contiguous stem of base pairs, calculate the total number of hydrogen bonds within this stem. A Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pair is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds, and an Adenine-Uracil (A-U) pair is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the total number of hydrogen bonds in the most stable secondary structure of the given Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) sequence. The problem states that the most stable structure is the one with the longest possible contiguous stem formed by Watson-Crick base pairs (G-C and A-U).\n\nThe RNA sequence is 5'-GCCAUGAAGCUUCAUGGC-3'. Let's number the nucleotides from the 5' end to the 3' end:\n5'-G(1)-C(2)-C(3)-A(4)-U(5)-G(6)-A(7)-A(8)-G(9)-C(10)-U(11)-U(12)-C(13)-A(14)-U(15)-G(16)-G(17)-C(18)-3'\n\nTo form a stem, nucleotides from the 5' portion of the sequence must pair with complementary nucleotides from the 3' portion in an antiparallel fashion. We test for complementarity by comparing nucleotides from the 5' end (position $i$) with nucleotides from the 3' end (position $18-i+1$).\n\nLet's check for pairs starting from the ends and moving inwards:\n- Pair 1: G(1) and C(18). This is a valid G-C pair.\n- Pair 2: C(2) and G(17). This is a valid C-G pair.\n- Pair 3: C(3) and G(16). This is a valid C-G pair.\n- Pair 4: A(4) and U(15). This is a valid A-U pair.\n- Pair 5: U(5) and A(14). This is a valid U-A pair.\n- Pair 6: G(6) and C(13). This is a valid G-C pair.\n\nAt this stage, we have a stem of 6 base pairs. The remaining unpaired nucleotides would be A(7)A(8)G(9)C(10)U(11)U(12), which would form a loop. However, the problem specifies we must find the *longest possible* contiguous stem. Therefore, we must continue checking for potential pairings.\n\n- Pair 7: A(7) and U(12). This is a valid A-U pair.\n- Pair 8: A(8) and U(11). This is a valid A-U pair.\n- Pair 9: G(9) and C(10). This is a valid G-C pair.\n\nAll possible pairs from the first half of the sequence with the second half are valid Watson-Crick pairs. This means the entire 18-nucleotide sequence folds back on itself to form a perfect 9-base-pair stem with no loop. This structure contains the maximum possible number of base pairs and is thus the most stable conformation as per the problem's criteria.\n\nThe 9 base pairs forming the stem are:\n1. G(1)-C(18)\n2.

G(9)-C(10)\n\nNext, we count the number of G-C and A-U type pairs to calculate the total hydrogen bonds.\nFrom the list above, we can identify:\n- Number of G-C pairs (or C-G pairs): 5 (pairs 1, 2, 3, 6, 9)\n- Number of A-U pairs (or U-A pairs): 4 (pairs 4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nThe total number of hydrogen bonds is calculated using the given information: 3 H-bonds for a G-C pair and 2 H-bonds for an A-U pair.\nTotal Hydrogen Bonds = (Number of G-C pairs $\\times$ 3) + (Number of A-U pairs $\\times$ 2)\nTotal Hydrogen Bonds = (5 $\\times$ 3) + (4 $\\times$ 2)\nTotal Hydrogen Bonds = 15 + 8\nTotal Hydrogen Bonds = 23.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{23}$$", "id": "1523618"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the bases, the very chemistry of the sugar-phosphate backbone distinguishes DNA from RNA and dictates how they are synthesized.

DNA polymerase can incorporate such an analogue because the current step uses the primer $3^{\\prime}\\mathrm{OH}$. However, once 3'-dTTP is incorporated, the new chain terminus bears $3^{\\prime}\\mathrm{H}$ instead of $3^{\\prime}\\mathrm{OH}$, so no subsequent nucleophilic attack can occur. Therefore, incorporation of 3'-dTTP causes chain termination in DNA replication.\n\nSystem 2 (transcription with NTPs): RNA polymerase selectively uses ribonucleoside triphosphates that have a $2^{\\prime}\\mathrm{OH}$ and, for A-templated positions, uses UTP rather than TTP. The 3'-dTTP analogue is both a deoxynucleotide (lacking $2^{\\prime}\\mathrm{OH}$) and contains thymine instead of uracil. By the fundamental substrate specificity of RNA polymerase for NTPs, 3'-dTTP is not efficiently incorporated into RNA.
