{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before DNA was identified as the carrier of genetic information, many scientists believed proteins were the more likely candidate. This was largely due to the \"complexity argument\": with 20 different amino acid building blocks compared to DNA's 4 nucleotide bases, proteins seemed to possess a much greater capacity for encoding the vast complexity of life. This exercise, [@problem_id:2315433], allows you to quantify this historical viewpoint by comparing the combinatorial possibilities of a short polypeptide versus a DNA strand of the same length. By working through the calculation, you will gain a concrete appreciation for the compelling, albeit incorrect, logic that experimentalists like Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty had to overcome.", "problem": "In the early 20th century, before the seminal work of Hershey and Chase, the scientific community widely believed that proteins, not Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), were the carriers of genetic information. This belief was partly based on a simple argument about structural complexity and information-carrying capacity. Proteins are constructed from a set of 20 standard amino acids, whereas DNA is built from only 4 nucleotide bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine).\n\nConsider a short macromolecule of length $n=4$ units. Let $N_{protein}$ be the total number of unique sequences possible for a polypeptide of this length, and let $N_{DNA}$ be the total number of unique sequences for a DNA strand of the same length. To quantify the difference in potential information content that influenced early researchers, calculate the value of the ratio $\\frac{N_{protein}}{N_{DNA}}$. Assume that any of the constituent units (amino acids or bases) can appear at any position along the chain.", "solution": "We model a sequence of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $a$ using the rule of product (fundamental counting principle): each position has $a$ independent choices, so the total number of unique sequences is $a^{n}$.\n\nFor a polypeptide of length $n=4$ with $a=20$ possible amino acids at each position, the number of unique sequences is\n$$\nN_{protein} = 20^{4}.\n$$\nFor a DNA strand of length $n=4$ with $a=4$ possible nucleotide bases at each position, the number of unique sequences is\n$$\nN_{DNA} = 4^{4}.\n$$\nThe ratio of the numbers of sequences is\n$$\n\\frac{N_{protein}}{N_{DNA}} = \\frac{20^{4}}{4^{4}} = \\left(\\frac{20}{4}\\right)^{4} = 5^{4} = 625.\n$$\nThus, for length $4$, proteins have $625$ times as many possible sequences as DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{625}$$", "id": "2315433"}, {"introduction": "The Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment was a masterpiece of scientific reasoning, using enzymes as precision tools to dissect the \"transforming principle.\" To truly test your understanding of their experimental logic, it is not enough to simply memorize their conclusion. This problem, [@problem_id:2315411], presents a hypothetical scenario where the transforming agent is a novel DNA-protein complex. By predicting the outcome of protease and DNase treatments in this fictional context, you will engage in the same critical thinking and process of elimination that allowed these pioneering scientists to definitively identify DNA as the genetic material.", "problem": "In a series of experiments inspired by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, a biologist investigates the nature of the \"transforming principle\" responsible for converting non-virulent (R-type) *Streptococcus pneumoniae* into the virulent (S-type) form. The principle is isolated from heat-killed S-type bacteria.\n\nA novel hypothesis is proposed: the transforming principle is a stable, covalent DNA-protein adduct. In this model, the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) component carries the genetic information for the polysaccharide capsule that confers virulence. The protein component, however, serves as a necessary shuttle, being absolutely required for the uptake of the entire adduct into the recipient R-type cells. The protein itself has no genetic function.\n\nTwo parallel experiments are conducted on separate, identical aliquots of the isolated transforming principle:\n1.  **Experiment 1**: The aliquot is treated with a purified protease, an enzyme that completely and specifically hydrolyzes all peptide bonds, thus destroying proteins.\n2.  **Experiment 2**: The aliquot is treated with a purified Deoxyribonuclease (DNase), an enzyme that completely and specifically hydrolyzes the phosphodiester backbone of DNA.\n\nFollowing each treatment, the resulting mixture is added to a fresh culture of living R-type cells and incubated under conditions that would normally allow for transformation.

By the hypothesis, $P$ is absolutely required for uptake of the adduct; without $P$, $D$ cannot enter R-type cells. Therefore, even if $D$ remains chemically intact, there is no cellular uptake and thus no transformation.\n\nExperiment 2 (DNase treatment):\n- Reaction: $$D\\text{-}P \\xrightarrow{\\text{DNase}} \\text{oligonucleotides/mononucleotides} + P.$$\n- Consequence: The DNA $D$ is degraded, eliminating the genetic information required for capsule synthesis. Even if $P$ could mediate uptake, there is no intact $D$ to confer heritable change. Therefore, no transformation occurs.\n\nPrediction:\n- After protease (Experiment 1): No transformation (uptake blocked due to absence of $P$).\n- After DNase (Experiment 2): No transformation (genetic information destroyed due to absence of intact $D$).\n\nThus, transformation will not be observed after either treatment, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315411"}, {"introduction": "The discovery that an external-molecule could genetically transform bacteria was not merely a historical breakthrough; it laid the groundwork for modern molecular biology and genetic engineering.

Define the selection goal.\n- We must exclusively recover recipient cells that have taken up donor DNA (i.e., are transformed). Untransformed DH5alpha cells are $ \\text{Lac}^{-}, \\text{Amp}^{S} $ and must not grow. Any residual live donor cells should also not grow; though donors are heat-killed, rigorous selection should still exclude them if present.\n\n3. Use dual independent selection to minimize false positives.\n- Spontaneous mutation can generate $ \\text{Amp}^{R} $ or $ \\text{Lac}^{+} $ in recipients without transformation.

Analyze each medium option against the selection criteria.\n- A. Minimal salts + Glucose: No antibiotic; carbon source is readily utilizable by DH5alpha. Untransformed recipients ($ \\text{Amp}^{S}, \\text{Lac}^{-} $) will grow. Not selective.\n- B.

Minimal salts + Lactose: Selects for $ \\text{Lac}^{+} $. Untransformed recipients ($ \\text{Lac}^{-} $) do not grow, but if any donor survivors exist (or contamination), they are $ \\text{Lac}^{+} $ and could grow; furthermore, spontaneous $ \\text{Lac}^{+} $ revertants could arise. Lacks antibiotic selection; not maximally exclusive.\n- D. Minimal salts + Ampicillin + Lactose: Ampicillin requires $ \\text{Amp}^{R} $ and lactose as sole carbon source requires $ \\text{Lac}^{+} $. Only cells that are both $ \\text{Amp}^{R} $ and $ \\text{Lac}^{+} $ will grow. Untransformed DH5alpha ($ \\text{Amp}^{S}, \\text{Lac}^{-} $) cannot grow; spontaneous mutants for a single trait are excluded because they would fail the other selection. Heat-killed donors cannot grow; any hypothetical live donor contaminants would be K12 ($ \\text{Amp}^{R}, \\text{Lac}^{+} $), but the experimental design heat-kills them, and the recipient background is eliminated, making this the most exclusive selection for transformed recipients.\n- E.
