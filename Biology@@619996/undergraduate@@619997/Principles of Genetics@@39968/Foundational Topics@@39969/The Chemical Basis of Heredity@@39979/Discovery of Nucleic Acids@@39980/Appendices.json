The discovery by Erwin Chargaff that the amount of adenine ($A$) equals thymine ($T$) and the amount of guanine ($G$) equals cytosine ($C$) was a critical piece of the puzzle that led to the double helix model. This exercise challenges you to apply these quantitative principles, known as Chargaff's rules, to determine the base composition of a DNA molecule, a foundational skill for any geneticist [@problem_id:1482407].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is constructing a novel plasmid for a gene therapy application. This plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule. The thermal stability of the plasmid is critical for its function within the host cell. This stability is largely determined by the relative abundance of Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pairs, which are linked by three hydrogen bonds, versus Adenine-Thymine (A-T) pairs, which are linked by two. For this specific design, the biologist has engineered the sequence such that the ratio of the total molar content of (Adenine + Thymine) to the total molar content of (Guanine + Cytosine) is precisely 1.60.\n\nAssuming the plasmid strictly follows the standard Watson-Crick base-pairing model for double-stranded DNA, calculate the molar fraction of Thymine (T).

For double-stranded DNA under Watson-Crick pairing, Chargaff’s rules give $a=t$ and $g=c$. Let $a=t=x$ and $g=c=y$.\n\nThe given ratio is\n$$\\frac{A+T}{G+C}=\\frac{a+t}{g+c}=\\frac{2x}{2y}=\\frac{x}{y}=1.60.$$\nThe total molar fraction sums to $1$:\n$$a+t+g+c=2x+2y=1.$$\nFrom $x=1.60\\,y$, substitute into the sum:\n$$2(1.60\\,y)+2y=1 \\implies 3.2\\,y+2y=1 \\implies 5.2\\,y=1 \\implies y=\\frac{1}{5.2}.$$\nThen\n$$x=\\frac{1.60}{5.2}=\\frac{16/10}{52/10}=\\frac{16}{52}=\\frac{4}{13}.$$\nThus the molar fraction of Thymine is $t=x=\\frac{4}{13}\\approx 0.307692\\ldots$, which rounds to three significant figures as $0.308$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.308}$$", "id": "1482407"}, {"introduction": "The Hershey-Chase experiment is a landmark in the history of science, providing compelling evidence that DNA, not protein, is the molecule of heredity.

The student prepares two separate batches of T2 bacteriophage. Batch A is grown in a medium containing the radioactive isotope $^{35}$S, which specifically labels the phage's protein coats. Batch B is grown in a medium containing the radioactive isotope $^{32}$P, which specifically labels the phage's DNA.\n\nBoth batches of labeled phages are then used to infect separate cultures of non-radioactive *E. coli* bacteria. The student allows sufficient time for the phages to attach to the bacteria and inject their genetic material. Following the infection period, the student proceeds directly to the centrifugation step, which separates the mixture into a solid pellet containing the bacterial cells and a liquid supernatant. Critically, the student completely omits the standard agitation step, where the mixture is vortexed or blended to shear the phage particles from the surface of the bacteria.\n\nAssuming the infection process itself was successful, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected distribution of radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant for both batches after centrifugation?\n\nA. Batch A ($^{35}$S): most radioactivity in the supernatant. Batch B ($^{32}$P): most radioactivity in the pellet.\n\nB. Batch A ($^{35}$S): most radioactivity in the pellet.

Labeling specificity: $^{35}$S incorporates into sulfur-containing amino acids and thus labels phage protein but not DNA; $^{32}$P incorporates into the phosphate backbone and thus labels phage DNA but not protein.\n2. Infection mechanics: Upon adsorption, T2 phage injects its DNA into the bacterium; the protein capsid remains outside as a phage ghost attached to the cell surface.\n3. Standard Hershey–Chase separation logic: Agitation (blending) is used to shear the attached protein ghosts off the bacterial surface before centrifugation, so that bacterial cells pellet while detached ghosts remain in the supernatant.\n4. Modified procedure in this scenario: The agitation step is omitted. Therefore, phage ghosts remain attached to the bacterial surface after DNA injection.\n5. Centrifugation principle: Dense bacterial cells, along with any material firmly attached to them, sediment into the pellet; only unattached particles remain in the supernatant.\n6. Predicted distribution:\n   - Batch A ($^{35}$S, protein-labeled): The labeled protein coats remain attached to the bacteria (because no shearing), so the radioactivity co-sediments with the cells in the pellet; only a minor fraction from any unattached phage would be in the supernatant.\n   - Batch B ($^{32}$P, DNA-labeled): The labeled DNA is injected into the bacteria and thus resides inside the cells, so the radioactivity is in the pellet.\n7.

One such mechanism involves rare, transient isomers of the DNA bases, known as tautomers, which can cause mispairing during replication. This advanced exercise [@problem_id:1482406] provides a glimpse into the chemical basis of spontaneous mutation, asking you to calculate the frequency of an error arising from a tautomeric shift and linking the molecular world to the process of evolution.", "problem": "The bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can exist in rare, alternative isomeric forms known as tautomers. For example, guanine (G) typically exists in a keto form, which pairs with cytosine (C). However, it can transiently shift to a rare enol tautomer (G*). This G* pairs preferentially with thymine (T) instead of cytosine. This process provides a chemical mechanism for spontaneous point mutations.\n\nConsider a single double-stranded DNA molecule in a replication-permissive environment. One strand of this molecule contains a single guanine base at a specific locus, which is part of a G-C base pair. The equilibrium for the tautomerization of this guanine from its common keto form to its rare enol form is described by the constant $K_{taut} = \\frac{[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{enol}}]}{[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{keto}}]} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nWe will model the generation of a mutation under the following simplifying assumptions:\n1. The tautomeric shift to the enol form (G to G*), if it occurs, happens only on the original guanine-containing strand just before the first round of replication begins.\n2. If the shift occurs, the DNA polymerase enzyme invariably incorporates a thymine (T) opposite the enol-guanine (G*) template.\n3. Immediately after this first replication event, the enol-guanine (G*) reverts to its stable keto form (G) and does not undergo any further tautomeric shifts in subsequent rounds.\n4. No other mutations or replication errors occur anywhere in the molecule.\n\nStarting from this single G-C pair, calculate the expected fraction of all descendant DNA molecules that will carry a G-C to A-T transition mutation at this specific site after exactly two complete rounds of semi-conservative replication.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $K_{taut}$ denote the equilibrium constant between enol and keto forms of the guanine base at the site, with\n$$\nK_{taut}=\\frac{[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{enol}}]}{[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{keto}}]}.\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the probability that the guanine is in the enol form at the onset of the first replication is the fraction of molecules in the enol state:\n$$\nP(\\text{enol})=\\frac{[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{enol}}]}{[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{enol}}]+[\\text{Guanine}_{\\text{keto}}]}=\\frac{K_{taut}}{1+K_{taut}}.\n$$\nBy assumption, if the template guanine is enol in the first round, DNA polymerase incorporates T opposite it, creating after the first replication one duplex with a G-T mismatch and one normal duplex. In the second round, replication of the mismatched duplex yields one duplex with G-C (from the G template) and one duplex with A-T (from the T template). The normal duplex yields two G-C duplexes.
