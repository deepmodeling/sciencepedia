Standard Watson-Crick pairing implies Chargaffâ€™s rules: $p_{A} = p_{T}$ and $p_{G} = p_{C}$. The fractions must sum to unity:\n$$\np_{A} + p_{T} + p_{G} + p_{C} = 1.\n$$\nGiven $p_{C} = 0.220$, we have $p_{G} = p_{C} = 0.220$.

This problem challenges you to work like a virologist, using base composition data to determine the fundamental nature of a newly discovered viral genome. By analyzing the relative amounts of purines and pyrimidines, you can deduce whether the genetic material is RNA or DNA, and whether it exists as a single or double strand [@problem_id:1516168].", "problem": "Researchers studying extremophiles have isolated a novel virus, named Thermococcus venti Phage 1 (TVP-1), from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. A key step in characterizing this virus is to determine the nature of its genetic material. A quantitative analysis of the nitrogenous bases from the viral nucleic acid was performed, yielding the following molar composition: 28% adenine, 30% cytosine, 22% guanine, and 20% uracil. Based on this composition, what is the most likely structure of the genetic material in the TVP-1 virus?\n\nA. Double-stranded RNA\n\nB. Single-stranded RNA\n\nC. Double-stranded DNA\n\nD. Single-stranded DNA\n\nE. A hybrid molecule of RNA and DNA", "solution": "The problem requires us to deduce the structure of a viral genome from its base composition. The fundamental principle governing the structure of double-stranded nucleic acids is complementary base pairing, as described by Chargaff's rules.\n\nFirst, we must identify the type of nucleic acid. The composition includes adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). The presence of uracil instead of thymine (T) is characteristic of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). Therefore, the genetic material of TVP-1 is RNA. This conclusion eliminates options C and D, which describe Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).\n\nNext, we must determine whether the RNA is single-stranded or double-stranded. In a double-stranded nucleic acid helix, adenine (A) forms a specific pair with uracil (U) (in RNA) or thymine (T) (in DNA), and guanine (G) forms a specific pair with cytosine (C). A direct consequence of this strict pairing is that the molar amount of A must equal the molar amount of U, and the molar amount of G must equal the molar amount of C.\n\nLet's analyze the given base percentages for the TVP-1 virus:\n- Molar percentage of Adenine (%A) = 28%\n- Molar percentage of Uracil (%U) = 20%\n- Molar percentage of Guanine (%G) = 22%\n- Molar percentage of Cytosine (%C) = 30%\n\nWe now check if the conditions for double-strandedness are met:\n1.  Is %A equal to %U? We have %A = 28% and %U = 20%. Since $28\\% \\neq 20\\%$, the A-U pairing rule is violated.\n2.  Is %G equal to %C? We have %G = 22% and %C = 30%. Since $22\\% \\neq 30\\%$, the G-C pairing rule is also violated.\n\nBecause the composition does not follow the A=U and G=C rule, the RNA molecule cannot be consistently base-paired along its entire length, which means it cannot be a fully double-stranded molecule. It must be single-stranded.\n\nOne might observe that the total percentage of purines (A + G) is $28\\% + 22\\% = 50\\%$, and the total percentage of pyrimidines (U + C) is $20\\% + 30\\% = 50\\%$. While it is a necessary condition for a double-stranded molecule that the total purines equal the total pyrimidines, this is not a sufficient condition. The individual pairing rules (%A = %U and %G = %C) must hold true. A single-stranded molecule can have any arbitrary base composition, and it is merely a coincidence that the total purine and pyrimidine contents are equal in this particular viral genome.\n\nGiven that the molecule is RNA and the base-pairing rules for a double helix are not satisfied, the genetic material must be single-stranded RNA.

This thought experiment guides you through the step-by-step process of chemical mutagenesis using 5-bromouracil, a pyrimidine analog. By tracking its incorporation and subsequent mispairing through two rounds of DNA replication, you will gain a deeper, dynamic understanding of how a single molecular error can lead to a permanent change in a gene [@problem_id:1516185].", "problem": "A specific DNA molecule within a bacterium contains a well-defined Adenine-Thymine (A-T) base pair at a particular gene locus. This bacterium is subjected to a two-stage experiment.\n\nIn the first stage, the bacterium is cultured for exactly one generation in a medium containing a mutagenic agent, 5-bromouracil (5-BU). The agent 5-BU is a base analog of thymine (T), and in its most common stable form (keto form), it pairs with adenine (A) during DNA replication.\n\nIn the second stage, the two cells resulting from the first division are immediately transferred to a new medium that is completely free of 5-BU. They are then allowed to grow for exactly one more generation. It is known that if a 5-BU base has been incorporated into a DNA strand, it has a significant probability of temporarily shifting to its rare, unstable tautomeric form (enol form) when it serves as a template in the next replication round. In this enol form, 5-BU preferentially pairs with guanine (G).\n\nAssuming that the 5-BU is incorporated into a new DNA strand during the first replication round and the subsequent mispairing event occurs during the second replication round, what will be the composition of the base pairs at this specific locus across the four granddaughter DNA molecules?\n\nA. Four molecules with A-T pairs.\n\nB. Two molecules with A-T pairs and two molecules with G-C pairs.\n\nC. Three molecules with A-T pairs and one molecule with a G-C pair.\n\nD. Two molecules with A-T pairs, one molecule with an A-5BU pair, and one molecule with a G-C pair.\n\nE. Three molecules with A-T pairs and one molecule with a G-5BU pair.", "solution": "Principles used:\n- DNA replicates semi-conservatively: each daughter duplex contains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n- Base-pairing rules under normal conditions: A pairs with T; T analog 5-bromouracil (5-BU) in its keto form pairs with A.\n- Tautomerization of incorporated 5-BU: when serving as a template in the next round, 5-BU can transiently adopt its enol form and pair with G, causing a mispair that precedes a fixed transition mutation.\n\nStep-by-step replication history at the specific locus:\n1) Start with a parental duplex containing an A-T pair at the locus: one strand carries A and the complementary strand carries T.\n2) First replication (in 5-BU medium):\n- The strand with template A directs incorporation of a thymine analog; because 5-BU in keto form pairs with A, the newly synthesized complementary base at this site is 5-BU. This produces one daughter duplex containing an A-5BU pair.\n- The complementary parental strand with template T directs incorporation of A, producing the other daughter duplex containing a normal A-T pair.\nThus, after the first generation, there are two duplexes: one with A-5BU and one with A-T.\n3) Second replication (in 5-BU-free medium), allowing mispairing from the incorporated 5-BU:\n- Replication of the A-5BU duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes:\n  a) The parental A strand templates a new T, yielding a granddaughter duplex with an A-T pair.\n  b) The parental strand containing 5-BU now serves as a template; by the stated assumption, it undergoes the tautomeric shift to the enol form during templating and pairs with G. This yields a granddaughter duplex with a G-5BU pair at the locus.\n- Replication of the A-T duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes, both with normal A-T pairs, since there is no 5-BU present and no mispairing is specified.\n\nTally across the four granddaughter DNA molecules: three duplexes with A-T pairs and one duplex with a G-5BU pair. Note that fixation to a stable G-C pair would require a further replication round where the G serves as a template for C; under the two-generation protocol, the mispair remains as G-5BU in one granddaughter duplex.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1516185"}]}
