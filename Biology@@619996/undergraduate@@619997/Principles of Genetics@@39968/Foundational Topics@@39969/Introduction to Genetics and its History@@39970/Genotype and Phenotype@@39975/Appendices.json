This problem challenges you to think quantitatively about genetic diversity by calculating the total number of distinct genotypes for a single gene when multiple alleles are present. Mastering this fundamental concept provides a crucial foundation for understanding the genetic makeup of populations and the raw material for evolution. [@problem_id:1495176]", "problem": "In the highlands of a remote island, botanists have discovered a unique species of flowering plant, *Lunaria nocturna*, which displays varying patterns of bioluminescence on its petals. Through genetic sequencing, researchers have determined that this trait is controlled by a single autosomal gene, which they have named the `Lumi` gene. Extensive sampling across the entire population has revealed the existence of exactly seven different alleles for this gene. Assuming that *Lunaria nocturna* is a diploid organism and that any combination of these alleles is possible, what is the total number of distinct genotypes for the `Lumi` gene that could theoretically exist in this plant population?", "solution": "Let $k$ denote the number of distinct alleles at the locus. For a diploid organism, a genotype corresponds to choosing an unordered pair of alleles with repetition allowed, because the two allele copies at a locus are not ordered and homozygotes repeat the same allele.\n\nThe total number of such genotypes is the number of combinations with repetition of size $2$ from $k$ types, given by:\n$$\n\\binom{k+2-1}{2}=\\binom{k+1}{2}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, we can count by cases:\n- Homozygotes: one allele chosen twice, giving $k$ possibilities.\n- Heterozygotes: two different alleles, giving $\\binom{k}{2}$ possibilities.\n\nSumming,\n$$\n\\binom{k}{2}+k=\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}+k=\\frac{k(k-1+2)}{2}=\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}=\\binom{k+1}{2}.\n$$\n\nFor this problem, $k=7$, so the total number of distinct genotypes is:\n$$\n\\binom{7+1}{2}=\\binom{8}{2}=\\frac{8\\cdot 7}{2}=28.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28}$$", "id": "1495176"}, {"introduction": "A genotype is a blueprint, but the final phenotype depends on how the alleles in that blueprint interact. This exercise moves beyond simple dominant/recessive relationships to explore a more realistic scenario: a multiple-allele system with a clear dominance hierarchy. By predicting the phenotypic ratios in the offspring of a genetic cross, you will practice the essential skill of translating genotypic information into observable traits using a Punnett square. [@problem_id:1495118]", "problem": "In a certain species of rabbit, coat color is determined by a single gene with four different alleles. These alleles exhibit a clear hierarchy of dominance. The allele for full color, $C$, is dominant over all other alleles. The allele for a chinchilla pattern, $c^{ch}$, is dominant over the Himalayan and albino alleles. The allele for a Himalayan pattern, $c^{h}$, is dominant only over the albino allele, $c$. The complete dominance hierarchy can be summarized as $C > c^{ch} > c^{h} > c$.\n\nA geneticist performs a cross between a male rabbit with a full-color coat and a female rabbit with a chinchilla coat. Through genetic testing, it is known that the male's genotype is $C c^{h}$ and the female's genotype is $c^{ch} c$.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance, determine the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring from this cross.

We are given the genotypes of the parent rabbits and the dominance hierarchy for the alleles controlling coat color.\n\nFirst, let's identify the parents and their genotypes:\nParent 1 (Male): Genotype is $C c^{h}$.\nParent 2 (Female): Genotype is $c^{ch} c$.\n\nNext, we must determine the possible gametes that each parent can produce. According to Mendel's Law of Segregation, the two alleles for a heritable character separate from each other during gamete formation.\n- Parent 1 ($C c^{h}$) can produce two types of gametes: one carrying the $C$ allele and one carrying the $c^{h}$ allele.\n- Parent 2 ($c^{ch} c$) can produce two types of gametes: one carrying the $c^{ch}$ allele and one carrying the $c$ allele.\n\nTo find all possible genotypes of the offspring, we can use a Punnett square. We place the gametes from one parent along the top and the gametes from the other parent along the side.\n\n| | $C$ | $c^{h}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **$c^{ch}$** | $C c^{ch}$ | $c^{ch} c^{h}$ |\n| **$c$** | $C c$ | $c^{h} c$ |\n\nThe Punnett square shows four equally probable genotypes for the offspring: $C c^{ch}$, $c^{ch} c^{h}$, $C c$, and $c^{h} c$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the phenotype for each of these genotypes using the given dominance hierarchy: $C > c^{ch} > c^{h} > c$.\n\n1.  **Genotype $C c^{ch}$**: The $C$ allele is dominant over the $c^{ch}$ allele. Therefore, the phenotype is **Full Color**.\n2.  **Genotype $c^{ch} c^{h}$**: The $c^{ch}$ allele is dominant over the $c^{h}$ allele. Therefore, the phenotype is **Chinchilla**.\n3.  **Genotype $C c$**: The $C$ allele is dominant over the $c$ allele. Therefore, the phenotype is **Full Color**.\n4.  **Genotype $c^{h} c$**: The $c^{h}$ allele is dominant over the $c$ allele. Therefore, the phenotype is **Himalayan**.\n\nFinally, we tally the phenotypes to find the expected ratio.\n- Full Color: 2 offspring ($C c^{ch}$ and $C c$)\n- Chinchilla: 1 offspring ($c^{ch} c^{h}$)\n- Himalayan: 1 offspring ($c^{h} c$)\n- Albino: 0 offspring\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio is 2 Full Color : 1 Chinchilla : 1 Himalayan : 0 Albino.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as a sequence of four integers in the order Full Color : Chinchilla : Himalayan : Albino.

This problem models a biochemical pathway, vividly illustrating the 'one gene, one enzyme' principle and the cascading effects of a genetic mutation. By analyzing how a non-functional enzyme disrupts the pathway, you will learn to predict which chemical intermediate accumulates and how this directly determines the organism's observable phenotype. [@problem_id:1495131]", "problem": "The bioluminescence of a hypothetical marine crustacean, the Glimmer Shrimp (*Lucentia marina*), is determined by a three-step biochemical pathway. In wild-type individuals, a widely available, colorless, and non-fluorescent precursor molecule is converted into the final bioluminescent compound, Lumiflavin, which emits a bright blue light.\n\nThe pathway is as follows:\n1.  The precursor is converted to an intermediate, Chromo-form A, by Enzyme E1, which is encoded by the gene `G1`. Chromo-form A is also colorless and non-fluorescent.\n2.  Chromo-form A is converted to a second intermediate, Chromo-form B, by Enzyme E2, which is encoded by the gene `G2`. Chromo-form B is colorless in visible light but exhibits a distinct green fluorescence when exposed to ambient ultraviolet (UV) light.\n3.  Chromo-form B is converted to the final product, Lumiflavin, by Enzyme E3, which is encoded by the gene `G3`. Lumiflavin is responsible for the shrimp's characteristic blue bioluminescence.\n\nConsider an individual Glimmer Shrimp that is homozygous for a recessive null allele of the `G2` gene (genotype $g2/g2$). A null allele results in the production of a completely non-functional enzyme. Assume the genes `G1` and `G3` are wild-type.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the primary substance that will accumulate in this shrimp and its resulting observable phenotype?\n\nA. Accumulates Chromo-form B; phenotype is non-bioluminescent but fluoresces green under ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\nB.

The immediate substrate of the defective enzyme accumulates, and all downstream products are not produced. Upstream steps that remain functional will still operate.\n\nGiven genotype $g2/g2$ is a recessive null for `G2`, Enzyme $E2$ has zero activity. Assume `G1` and `G3` are wild-type, so $E1$ and $E3$ are functional.\n\nStep-by-step consequences:\n1. $E1$ is functional, so the precursor is converted to Chromo-form A. Therefore, the precursor does not accumulate.\n2. $E2$ is non-functional due to the null $g2/g2$ genotype, so Chromo-form A cannot be converted to Chromo-form B. Hence, Chromo-form A accumulates.\n3. Because Chromo-form B is not produced, there is no green fluorescence under ultraviolet light (the property attributed to Chromo-form B).\n4. $E3$ is functional but has no substrate (Chromo-form B), so Lumiflavin is not produced. Therefore, there is no blue bioluminescence.\n\nConclusion: The primary accumulating substance is Chromo-form A; the observable phenotype is non-bioluminescent and non-fluorescent (colorless).
