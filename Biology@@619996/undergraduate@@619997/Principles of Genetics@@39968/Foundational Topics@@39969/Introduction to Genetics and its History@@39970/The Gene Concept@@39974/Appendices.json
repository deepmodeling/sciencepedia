This practice lets you step into the role of a classical geneticist, using controlled cross data to test if a newly discovered trait follows Mendelian inheritance patterns. By applying the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit test, you will learn a fundamental statistical method for validating genetic hypotheses against experimental results [@problem_id:1526851].", "problem": "A geneticist discovers a new heritable trait in fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*) which they call \"Luminous Bristles\" (LB). The wild-type phenotype is \"Normal Bristles\" (NB). To investigate the genetic basis of this trait, a series of controlled crosses are performed.\n\nFirst, a true-breeding fly with Luminous Bristles is crossed with a true-breeding fly with Normal Bristles. All of the resulting F1 generation flies exhibit Luminous Bristles.\n\nTwo experiments are then conducted:\n1.  **Experiment 1**: F1 flies are intercrossed, producing an F2 generation. The F2 generation consists of 921 flies with Luminous Bristles and 279 flies with Normal Bristles.\n2.  **Experiment 2**: F1 flies are crossed with true-breeding Normal Bristle flies. The offspring from this cross consist of 418 flies with Luminous Bristles and 382 flies with Normal Bristles.\n\nYou are tasked with evaluating the hypothesis that the Luminous Bristles trait is controlled by a single gene with simple dominance, consistent with Mendelian inheritance. To do this, perform a chi-square ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit test on the data from *both* experiments. Calculate the individual $\\chi^2$ value for each experiment based on the expected Mendelian ratios, and then find the sum of these two values.\n\nWhat is the total $\\chi^2$ value for the combined results of both experiments?

This exercise explores the direct and dramatic consequences of altering that blueprint, examining how a single nucleotide substitution can bring protein synthesis to a halt. You will diagnose the molecular event that truncates a protein, linking a specific change in the mRNA code to a functional outcome and reinforcing your understanding of different mutation types [@problem_id:1526870].", "problem": "A research team is studying a gene in the bacterium *Escherichia coli* that encodes a structural protein. In the wild-type strain, this protein is 350 amino acids in length. The team isolates a mutant strain that produces a non-functional, truncated version of this protein, which is found to be only 129 amino acids long. Through sequence analysis of the messenger RNA (mRNA) from the mutant strain, they determine that a single nucleotide substitution is responsible for this change. The analysis confirms that the codon corresponding to the 130th position in the wild-type mRNA, which codes for the amino acid Tryptophan, is 5'-UGG-3'.\n\nGiven this information, identify the resulting codon in the mutant mRNA and the correct classification for this type of mutation.\n\nA. 5'-UGC-3'; Missense mutation\n\nB. 5'-AGG-3'; Missense mutation\n\nC. 5'-UGA-3'; Nonsense mutation\n\nD. 5'-UGU-3'; Silent mutation\n\nE. 5'-CUG-3'; Frameshift mutation", "solution": "The problem describes a scenario where a full-length protein of 350 amino acids is prematurely terminated, resulting in a truncated protein of only 129 amino acids. This indicates that the process of translation stopped after the 129th amino acid was added to the polypeptide chain.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the consequence of the mutation.\nThe synthesis of a shorter-than-normal polypeptide chain is the hallmark of premature termination of translation. Translation termination occurs when the ribosome encounters a \"stop\" codon in the mRNA sequence. Therefore, the mutation must have converted a codon that specifies an amino acid into a stop codon.\n\nStep 2: Identify the original codon and its position.\nThe problem states that the mutation occurred at the 130th codon position. In the wild-type (normal) organism, this codon is 5'-UGG-3', which codes for the amino acid Tryptophan.\n\nStep 3: Identify the nature of the mutation.\nThe problem specifies that the mutation is a \"single nucleotide substitution.\" This means only one of the three bases in the original 5'-UGG-3' codon has been changed.\n\nStep 4: Determine the identity of the mutant codon.\nWe need to find a stop codon that can be formed by changing a single base in the original 5'-UGG-3' codon. The three standard stop codons are 5'-UAA-3', 5'-UAG-3', and 5'-UGA-3'. Let's check which can be formed from 5'-UGG-3' by a single substitution:\n- Changing 5'-UGG-3' to 5'-UAA-3' requires two substitutions (G→A at position 2 and G→A at position 3).\n- Changing 5'-UGG-3' to 5'-UAG-3' requires a single substitution (G→A at position 2).\n- Changing 5'-UGG-3' to 5'-UGA-3' requires a single substitution (G→A at position 3).\nBoth UAG and UGA are therefore possible stop codons resulting from a single nucleotide substitution. We must examine the options to find the correct answer.\n\nStep 5: Classify the mutation.\nA mutation that changes a codon specifying an amino acid into a stop codon is defined as a **nonsense mutation**. This is distinct from:\n- A **missense mutation**, which changes the codon to one that specifies a different amino acid.\n- A **silent mutation**, which changes the codon but does not change the specified amino acid (due to the degeneracy of the genetic code).\n- A **frameshift mutation**, which involves the insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in multiples of three, thus altering the reading frame for all subsequent codons.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. 5'-UGC-3'; Missense mutation. 5'-UGC-3' codes for Cysteine. This would be a missense mutation, but it would not cause premature termination.\n- B. 5'-AGG-3'; Missense mutation. 5'-AGG-3' codes for Arginine. This would be a missense mutation, not causing termination.\n- C. 5'-UGA-3'; Nonsense mutation. 5'-UGA-3' is a stop codon. It can be formed from 5'-UGG-3' by a single G-to-A substitution at the third position. This correctly explains the truncated protein. The classification as a \"nonsense mutation\" is also correct.\n- D. 5'-UGU-3'; Silent mutation. 5'-UGU-3' codes for Cysteine. This is a missense mutation (Tryptophan to Cysteine), not a silent one, and it would not cause termination.\n- E. 5'-CUG-3'; Frameshift mutation. A single substitution cannot cause a frameshift mutation. Frameshifts are caused by insertions or deletions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that correctly identifies a valid stop codon resulting from a single substitution and provides the correct classification is C. The mutation changed the tryptophan codon 5'-UGG-3' into the stop codon 5'-UGA-3', which is a nonsense mutation, leading to the observed truncated protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526870"}, {"introduction": "Our modern view of the gene is far more complex than a simple, continuous stretch of code, especially in eukaryotes. This problem explores the intricate architecture of genes composed of coding exons and non-coding introns, which must be precisely processed. You will investigate a surprising case where a mutation deep within an intron causes the complete removal of an adjacent exon from the final protein, revealing the critical regulatory roles that non-coding sequences play in defining the final gene product [@problem_id:1526880].", "problem": "A researcher is studying a gene in a eukaryotic organism that encodes a 400-amino-acid protein. The gene consists of 5 exons and 4 introns. A spontaneous point mutation is identified deep within Intron 3 (the intron separating Exon 3 and Exon 4). Analysis of the protein produced from this mutated gene reveals that it is a stable protein, but it is missing precisely the 25 amino acids that are encoded by Exon 3. The rest of the protein sequence, corresponding to Exons 1, 2, 4, and 5, is completely normal. Which of the following is the most likely molecular explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The mutation created a premature stop codon within Intron 3, triggering nonsense-mediated decay of the portion of the pre-mRNA corresponding to Exon 3.\n\nB. The mutation destroyed the canonical 5' splice donor site at the boundary between Exon 3 and Intron 3.\n\nC. The mutation created a new promoter sequence within Intron 3, leading to the synthesis of a truncated transcript initiated from that point.\n\nD. The mutation disrupted an intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) element within Intron 3, which is required for the proper recognition of Exon 3 by the spliceosome.\n\nE. The mutation created a new, cryptic 3' splice acceptor site within Intron 3 that is used preferentially, leading to a frameshift and premature termination of the protein after Exon 2.", "solution": "We are told that a point mutation occurs deep within Intron 3 (between Exon 3 and Exon 4), and the resulting protein is stable but lacks precisely the amino acids encoded by Exon 3, with all other exons’ sequences normal. This pattern is most consistent with exon skipping during pre-mRNA splicing, specifically skipping of Exon 3.\n\nKey splicing principle: proper exon inclusion depends on exon definition, which involves splice sites at exon-intron boundaries and auxiliary cis-elements such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers. Disruption of enhancers needed for exon recognition can cause the spliceosome to skip that exon, joining the flanking exons directly. If the length of the skipped exon in nucleotides is divisible by $3$, then the open reading frame is preserved, and the protein remains stable but lacks the exact segment encoded by that exon. Since each amino acid corresponds to $3$ nucleotides, $L_{\\text{nt}}=3L_{\\text{aa}}$, and exon skipping preserves the reading frame when $L_{\\text{nt}}$ is a multiple of $3$. The observation that the protein is stable and missing exactly the amino acids encoded by Exon 3 implies that Exon 3’s length is a multiple of $3$, so exon skipping yields an in-frame deletion.\n\nEvaluate the options in light of the location and consequence:\n- Option A (premature stop codon in an intron causing nonsense-mediated decay of the portion corresponding to Exon 3) is incorrect because introns are removed during splicing; a stop codon in an intron has no effect unless the intron is retained. Nonsense-mediated decay targets the entire mRNA containing a premature termination codon upstream of an exon-exon junction and does not selectively delete a single exon to produce a stable protein missing exactly that exon’s amino acids.\n- Option B (destruction of the canonical $5'$ splice donor at the Exon 3–Intron 3 boundary) is unlikely both because the mutation is stated to be deep within the intron (not at the boundary) and because such a lesion commonly leads to intron retention or activation of cryptic splice sites, often causing frameshifts or premature termination rather than a clean, in-frame loss of an entire exon with all other exons normal.\n- Option C (a new promoter in Intron 3) would initiate transcription downstream of Exon 3, typically producing a transcript lacking all upstream exons (e.g., Exons 1–3) or altering the $5'$ end, not a product missing only Exon 3 with Exons 1, 2, 4, and 5 intact and properly joined.\n- Option D (disruption of an intronic splicing enhancer within Intron 3 required for recognition of Exon 3) directly fits both the location (“deep within” the intron) and the outcome (exon skipping of Exon 3). Loss of an intronic splicing enhancer impairs spliceosome recruitment and exon definition for the adjacent exon, leading to its exclusion while the remaining exons are spliced normally. If Exon 3 is $3k$ nucleotides long, skipping it removes exactly $k$ amino acids and preserves the reading frame, consistent with a stable protein missing precisely those amino acids.\n- Option E (creation of a cryptic $3'$ acceptor in Intron 3 leading to a frameshift and premature termination after Exon 2) predicts a frameshift and truncated, likely unstable protein, not a full-length stable protein missing only Exon 3.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular explanation is disruption of an intronic splicing enhancer necessary for Exon 3 inclusion, causing Exon 3 skipping and an in-frame deletion of its encoded amino acids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1526880"}]}
