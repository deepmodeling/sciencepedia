The allele for yellow seeds ($Y$) is completely dominant over the allele for green seeds ($y$). If an experimenter were to collect and analyze a random sample of just four F2-generation seeds from this cross, what is the exact probability of observing a perfect 3:1 phenotypic ratio, meaning exactly three seeds with the dominant phenotype (yellow) and one seed with the recessive phenotype (green)?\n\nExpress your answer as a fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "In a monohybrid cross $Yy \\times Yy$ with complete dominance of $Y$ over $y$, the F2 genotype probabilities are $YY$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$, $Yy$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $yy$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Two historical models of heredity are being compared: a simplified Galtonian model and a Mendelian model.\n\nThe simplified Galtonian model, inspired by Francis Galton's work on continuous traits, predicts the height of an offspring ($H_{offspring}$) based on a weighted average of its recent ancestry and a regression to the population mean. The formula to be used is:\n$$H_{Galton} = \\frac{1}{2} H_{mid-parent} + \\frac{1}{4} H_{mid-grandparent} + \\frac{1}{4} H_{population}$$\nwhere $H_{mid-parent}$ is the average height of the two immediate parents, $H_{mid-grandparent}$ is the average height of the four grandparents, and $H_{population}$ is the mean height of the general population.\n\nThe Mendelian model assumes that height is a discrete trait controlled by a single gene with two alleles, `H` (tall) and `h` (short), which exhibit incomplete dominance. The phenotypes are as follows:\n- Genotype `HH`: 100.0 cm\n- Genotype `Hh`: 80.0 cm\n- Genotype `hh`: 60.0 cm\n\nThe botanist has the following data for two plants, Parent A and Parent B, which are to be crossed:\n- **Population Data**: The mean height of the general population, $H_{population}$, is 85.0 cm.\n- **Parent A**: Height is 80.0 cm.
