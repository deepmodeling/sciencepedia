In this practical exercise in genetic counseling, you will analyze a family pedigree to determine the probability of an individual being a carrier for an X-linked disorder.

The pedigree is described as follows:\n\nThe first generation consists of a phenotypically unaffected couple, a male (I-1) and a female (I-2). In the second generation, they have three children: an unaffected daughter (II-1), an affected son (II-2), and an unaffected son (II-3).\n\nThe unaffected daughter from the second generation, II-1, marries an unaffected male, II-4, who has no family history of the disorder. They have a daughter, designated III-1.\n\nGiven this family history and assuming the disorder is rare in the general population, calculate the probability that individual III-1 is a carrier of the disorder. Express your final answer as a fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "Let $X$ denote the normal allele and $x$ the mutant allele for an X-linked recessive disorder. For males, genotypes are $XY$ (unaffected) or $xY$ (affected). For females, genotypes are $XX$ (unaffected, non-carrier), $Xx$ (unaffected carrier), or $xx$ (affected, which requires an affected father or an $x$ from both parents).\n\n1) Obligate carrier status of I-2:\nSince II-2 is an affected son, his genotype is $xY$. A son receives his single $X$ chromosome from his mother, so I-2 must carry the mutant allele. Therefore, I-2 is $Xx$ with probability $1$.\n\n2) Probability that II-1 (daughter of I-1 and I-2) is a carrier:\nI-1 is an unaffected male, hence $XY$. I-2 is $Xx$. For a daughter, the paternal contribution is $X$, and the maternal contribution is $X$ or $x$ with equal probability due to Mendelian segregation. Thus,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{II-1 is }Xx)=\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\mathbb{P}(\\text{II-1 is }XX)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nHer unaffected phenotype provides no additional information because carriers ($Xx$) are typically unaffected in X-linked recessive conditions, and with an unaffected father she cannot be $xx$.\n\n3) Probability that III-1 (daughter of II-1 and II-4) is a carrier:\nII-4 is an unaffected male with no family history, and under the rare-disease assumption his genotype is $XY$ with probability effectively $1$. A daughter receives a normal $X$ from II-4 and receives $X$ or $x$ from II-1 depending on whether II-1 is a carrier. Using the law of total probability,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{III-1 is a carrier})=\\mathbb{P}(\\text{II-1 is }Xx)\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{transmit }x\\mid \\text{II-1 is }Xx)+\\mathbb{P}(\\text{II-1 is }XX)\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{transmit }x\\mid \\text{II-1 is }XX).\n$$\nGiven $Xx$, transmission of $x$ to a child occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Given $XX$, transmission of $x$ is $0$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{III-1 is a carrier})=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(0)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThus, the probability that III-1 is a carrier is $\\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1521853"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative genetics provides the tools to understand and predict the inheritance of complex traits like height or yield, which are central to agriculture.
