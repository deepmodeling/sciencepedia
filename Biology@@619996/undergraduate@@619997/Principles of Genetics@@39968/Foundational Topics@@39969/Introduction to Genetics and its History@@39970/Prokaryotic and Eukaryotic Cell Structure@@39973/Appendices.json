This system ensures that newly synthesized proteins reach their correct destinations to perform their functions. This exercise [@problem_id:1514038] explores the most fundamental rule of this system by examining what happens when a protein's initial \"address label\"—the N-terminal signal peptide that directs it to the secretory pathway—is lost. Understanding this default pathway is the first step in mapping the complex protein traffic within the cell.", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is using genetically engineered CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells to produce a therapeutic enzyme called \"Secretase-X\". Under normal conditions, Secretase-X is synthesized and actively secreted from the cells into the culture medium. This process is known to be directed by a specific 20-amino-acid sequence at the N-terminus of the newly synthesized polypeptide, which acts as a signal peptide. A new cell line is generated with a mutation in the gene for Secretase-X. This mutation results in a precise deletion of the genetic code for this 20-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide, but the rest of the protein's coding sequence remains intact and functional. Assuming the mutated protein is stable and correctly folded, where would it predominantly accumulate within these CHO cells?\n\nA. The nucleus\n\nB. The cytosol\n\nC. The mitochondrial matrix\n\nD. Secreted into the culture medium\n\nE. Bound to the exterior of the plasma membrane", "solution": "- Principle of protein targeting to the secretory pathway: Proteins destined for secretion or for residence in the endomembrane system typically possess an N-terminal signal peptide that is recognized co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where translation resumes and the polypeptide is translocated into the ER lumen. The signal peptide is generally cleaved in the ER. From the ER, the protein traffics through the Golgi apparatus and is ultimately secreted.\n\n- Consequence of deleting the N-terminal signal peptide: If the 20-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide is precisely deleted, SRP will not recognize the nascent chain, the ribosome will not be targeted to the ER membrane, and translation will proceed on free cytosolic ribosomes. Without entry into the ER, the protein cannot access the secretory pathway and therefore cannot be secreted.\n\n- Default localization in the absence of targeting signals: In eukaryotic cells, the default destination for proteins synthesized on free ribosomes without any positive targeting signals is the cytosol.\n\n- Exclusion of other compartments:\n  - Nucleus (Option A): Nuclear localization requires an internal nuclear localization signal (NLS), typically rich in Lys and Arg; deletion of a secretory signal does not create an NLS, and none is indicated. Thus nuclear accumulation is not expected.\n  - Mitochondrial matrix (Option C): Mitochondrial import generally requires an N-terminal amphipathic targeting sequence distinct from an ER signal peptide. None is provided, so mitochondrial targeting is not expected.\n  - Secreted (Option D): Secretion requires ER entry via the signal peptide; without it, secretion will not occur.\n  - Bound to the exterior of the plasma membrane (Option E): Cell-surface localization typically requires passage through the secretory pathway and often a transmembrane segment or GPI anchor; without ER targeting, this is not expected.\n\n- Given that the mutated protein is stable and correctly folded, in the absence of any other targeting signals, it will predominantly remain in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1514038"}, {"introduction": "Eukaryotic cells are highly compartmentalized, with specialized organelles performing distinct tasks to maintain cellular homeostasis. The lysosome, for instance, functions as the cell's recycling center, breaking down waste materials in its acidic interior. This practice problem [@problem_id:1513986] asks you to act like a cellular detective, using the evidence from a hypothetical genetic disorder to identify a malfunctioning organelle. By connecting the cellular symptoms to the unique properties of the lysosome, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how organelle-specific functions are critical for overall health.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a newly identified genetic disorder in humans, provisionally named \"Systemic Lipofuscinosis.\" Patients with this condition exhibit a progressive, harmful buildup of complex lipids and lipoproteins within various cell types, particularly neurons and macrophages. Microscopic examination of affected cells reveals that these undigested lipid aggregates are confined within numerous small, spherical, membrane-bound vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Further biochemical analysis shows that the internal environment of these vesicles is maintained at a pH of approximately 4.8. The underlying cause of the disorder is determined to be a mutation in a single gene that codes for a specific hydrolytic enzyme.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following cellular organelles is the most likely location where this defective enzyme is intended to function?\n\nA. Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum\n\nB. Golgi Apparatus\n\nC. Peroxisome\n\nD. Mitochondrion\n\nE. Lysosome", "solution": "We proceed by identifying the organelle based on the features given and applying core cell biology principles about intracellular compartments and enzyme function.\n\n1. The undigested aggregates are described as confined within numerous small, spherical, membrane-bound vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Such structures are characteristic of endomembrane organelles. Among these, lysosomes are membrane-bound vesicles specialized for macromolecular degradation.\n\n2. The internal pH of these vesicles is approximately 4.8. An acidic lumen in the range of about 4.5 to 5.0 is a defining property of lysosomes, maintained by a vacuolar-type H^{+}-ATPase that pumps protons into the lumen. Other candidate organelles:\n- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus have luminal environments that are not as acidic as lysosomes and are not the primary site of bulk hydrolytic degradation.\n- Peroxisomes carry out oxidative reactions (e.g., very long-chain fatty acid oxidation) and contain catalase; they do not maintain an acidic lumen for acid hydrolases.\n- Mitochondria have specialized pH gradients associated with oxidative phosphorylation, with the matrix near neutral to slightly alkaline relative to the intermembrane space; they are not small cytoplasmic vesicles and are not sites of general hydrolytic degradation.\n\n3. The defective gene encodes a hydrolytic enzyme. Lysosomes house acid hydrolases (lipases, proteases, glycosidases, nucleases, phosphatases, sulfatases) that function optimally at low pH. A mutation in a single lysosomal hydrolase gene is a classic cause of lysosomal storage diseases.\n\n4. The clinical and cellular phenotype—progressive accumulation of complex lipids and lipoproteins in neurons and macrophages—matches lysosomal storage disorders, in which substrate accumulation occurs due to deficient lysosomal degradation. The term \"lipofuscinosis\" also aligns with buildup of lipid-rich material in lysosomal residual bodies.\n\n5. Therefore, the intended site of action of the defective hydrolytic enzyme is the lysosome.\n\nBy exclusion:\n- A (Smooth ER): site of lipid synthesis and detoxification, not acidic, not the site of hydrolase-mediated degradation.\n- B (Golgi Apparatus): protein and lipid modification and sorting; not the terminal degradative compartment and not as acidic as lysosomes.\n- C (Peroxisome): oxidative catabolism; not acid hydrolase-based and not pH 4.8 lumen.\n- D (Mitochondrion): energy metabolism; not vesicular degradative organelle.\n- E (Lysosome): acidic, vesicular, contains hydrolytic enzymes; matches all clues.\n\nConclusion: Lysosome is the most likely location.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1513986"}, {"introduction": "While signal peptides initiate a protein's journey into the secretory pathway, further sorting signals are required to guide it from the Golgi apparatus to its final destination. This process is not random; it relies on highly specific molecular tags. This problem [@problem_id:1513993] focuses on one such tag, mannose-6-phosphate ($M6P$), which serves as an exclusive ticket for enzymes destined for the lysosome. By analyzing the consequences of a failure to attach this tag, as seen in the real-world example of I-cell disease, you will uncover the precision of the Golgi's sorting machinery and the critical importance of these molecular signposts.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the proper functioning of lysosomes relies on the accurate delivery of newly synthesized acid hydrolases. This trafficking is orchestrated by a specific molecular tag. Proteins destined for the lysosome are first co-translationally imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the *cis*-Golgi network, the enzyme GlcNAc-phosphotransferase normally adds a phosphate group to mannose residues on these hydrolases, creating a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tag. This tag is later recognized by M6P-receptors in the *trans*-Golgi network, ensuring the enzymes are sorted into vesicles bound for the lysosome.\n\nConsider a cell line derived from a patient with a severe form of inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease. These cells possess a genetic defect rendering the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase enzyme completely non-functional. As a result, the mannose-6-phosphate tag cannot be added to the lysosomal hydrolases. Assuming the hydrolase proteins themselves are synthesized and folded correctly, what will be the primary final destination of these untagged lysosomal hydrolases?\n\nA. They will be retained and accumulate in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nB. They will be returned to the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nC. They will enter the constitutive secretory pathway and be released into the extracellular space.\n\nD. They will accumulate in the *trans*-Golgi network, unable to be packaged into vesicles.\n\nE. They will be correctly delivered to the lysosomes but will remain inactive due to the absence of the tag.", "solution": "Lysosomal acid hydrolases are synthesized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, traverse to the Golgi apparatus, and in the cis-Golgi normally receive a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) modification catalyzed by GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. This M6P tag is the sorting signal recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which package the hydrolases into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and then lysosomes. Thus, the physical principle of receptor-mediated sorting in the TGN depends on the presence of the M6P tag.\n\nIn I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II), GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is nonfunctional, so soluble lysosomal hydrolases do not acquire M6P. Without the M6P tag, these hydrolases cannot bind M6P receptors and therefore cannot be specifically sorted into lysosome-directed transport vesicles. In the absence of a positive sorting signal, soluble proteins that have correctly folded and exited the ER follow the default constitutive secretory pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, where they are released into the extracellular space. This leads to a characteristic increase in lysosomal enzyme activity in extracellular fluids and a deficiency of these enzymes within lysosomes, causing accumulation of undegraded substrates (inclusion bodies).\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because correctly folded hydrolases lack ER retention signals (such as KDEL) and are not retained in the ER.\n- Option B is incorrect because ER-associated degradation with retrotranslocation to the cytosol and proteasomal degradation targets misfolded proteins; the hydrolases here are properly folded.\n- Option C is correct because, lacking M6P, the hydrolases are not captured by M6P receptors in the TGN and therefore enter the constitutive secretory pathway and are secreted.\n- Option D is incorrect because, without receptor capture, the hydrolases do not accumulate in the TGN; they proceed by default to secretion.\n- Option E is incorrect because the issue is mistargeting, not catalytic inactivity; absence of M6P impairs sorting, not enzyme activity per se.\n\nTherefore, the primary final destination of the untagged lysosomal hydrolases is the extracellular space via constitutive secretion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1513993"}]}
