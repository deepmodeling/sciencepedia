According to this model, the height of an offspring is always the exact arithmetic mean of the heights of its two parents.\n\nA botanist starts with two pure-breeding lines: a tall line with a consistent height of 2.10 meters and a short line with a consistent height of 0.90 meters. The botanist performs a cross between one tall plant and one short plant to produce a first-generation (F1) offspring.

This next practice directly contrasts the predictions of blending inheritance with the observed outcomes explained by Mendelian genetics, using the classic example of flower color.
