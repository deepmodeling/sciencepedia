The genetic information required to synthesize a functional luciferase enzyme is encoded within a specific gene.\n\nA geneticist is studying a strain of these bacteria and introduces a single point mutation into the gene that codes for luciferase. This mutation is a \"nonsense mutation,\" which changes a codon that specifies an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon. The position of this mutation is very near the beginning of the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nAssuming that no other mutations occur and that the cell's machinery for transcription and translation is otherwise normal, which of the following descriptions best predicts the observable trait (phenotype) of this mutant bacterial strain when compared to the wild-type (unmutated) strain?\n\nA. The bacteria will exhibit significantly brighter bioluminescence.\n\nB. The bacteria will exhibit bioluminescence of a different color (e.g., green instead of blue).\n\nC. The bacteria will not be bioluminescent.\n\nD. The bacteria will exhibit a reduced, but still detectable, level of bioluminescence.\n\nE. There will be no change in bioluminescence.", "solution": "We are told a single nonsense mutation is introduced very near the beginning of the luciferase coding sequence, and all other cellular transcription and translation machinery is normal.\n\n1) Central dogma and effect of a nonsense mutation:\n- Transcription: The gene is transcribed into mRNA, now containing a premature stop codon near the 5' end of the coding sequence. Transcription itself proceeds normally and yields an mRNA that encodes a truncated open reading frame.\n- Translation initiation occurs at the start codon as usual. Because the nonsense mutation converts an early sense codon to a stop codon, the ribosome encounters a termination signal shortly after initiation and terminates translation prematurely, producing a severely truncated polypeptide.\n\n2) Consequences for protein structure and function:\n- Enzymatic function of luciferase depends on correct folding and the presence of essential domains. A stop codon near the beginning of the coding region results in a polypeptide too short to form the active site and other necessary structural features. Such a truncated product is nonfunctional and is typically unstable and rapidly degraded.\n- Therefore, the effective cellular concentration of functional luciferase, denoted $[E]$, becomes effectively zero in the mutant.\n\n3) Consequences for the bioluminescent phenotype:\n- The bioluminescent reaction rate is catalyzed by luciferase. Under standard enzyme kinetics, the reaction flux (and thus light output) is proportional to the product of catalytic activity and enzyme concentration, for example $J \\propto k_{\\text{cat}}[E]$ under saturating or comparable substrate conditions. If $[E]=0$ (no functional enzyme), then $J=0$, and the observable light output is absent.\n- Alternative phenotypes are inconsistent with this mechanism:\n  - Brighter light (A) would require increased enzyme activity or expression, not a premature stop.\n  - Different color (B) would require an alteration in the chromophore environment or emission spectrum determinants, not loss of the entire protein.\n  - Reduced but detectable light (D) might occur with a missense mutation or a truncation near the C-terminus that preserves partial activity; a truncation very near the N-terminus yields no activity.\n  - No change (E) contradicts the loss of functional enzyme.\n\nThus, the mutant strain will not be bioluminescent when compared to the wild-type strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1517490"}, {"introduction": "While single genes can determine traits, biological reality is often more complex, with multiple genes collaborating to produce a final phenotype. This practice problem models a two-step biochemical pathway where the product of one gene is the substrate for another, a common pattern in metabolism. Working through this example will introduce you to the concept of epistasis, where one gene can mask the effects of another, and challenge you to predict phenotypic ratios that deviate from simple Mendelian inheritance [@problem_id:1517469].", "problem": "In the fictional plant species *Aurelia nocturna*, flower color is determined by a two-step biochemical pathway. A colorless precursor molecule is first converted into a blue-colored intermediate pigment by the protein product of the dominant allele $B$. This blue intermediate can then be converted into a final purple pigment by the protein product of the dominant allele $P$. The recessive alleles, $b$ and $p$, produce non-functional proteins. Therefore, any plant with at least one $B$ allele but homozygous for $p$ will have blue flowers, while plants homozygous for $b$ will have white flowers regardless of the alleles at the $P$ gene locus.\n\nA geneticist performs a cross between a true-breeding plant with blue flowers and a true-breeding plant with white flowers.

Genotype: $B\\_ P\\_$. Phenotype: Purple.\n- A plant needs at least one dominant $B$ allele but has only recessive $p$ alleles. It will produce the blue intermediate but cannot convert it to purple. Genotype: $B\\_ pp$. Phenotype: Blue.\n- A plant has only recessive $b$ alleles. It cannot produce the blue intermediate from the colorless precursor. The pathway is blocked at the first step, so the flower will be white, regardless of the alleles at the $P$ locus. Genotypes: $bb P\\_$ and $bb pp$. Phenotype: White.\nThis phenomenon, where the genotype at one locus (the $B$/$b$ gene) masks the phenotypic expression of another locus (the $P$/$p$ gene), is known as recessive epistasis.\n\nStep 2: Deduce the genotypes of the initial parental plants (P generation).\nThe problem states that a true-breeding blue-flowered plant is crossed with a true-breeding white-flowered plant. \"True-breeding\" implies that the plants are homozygous for the genes in question.\n- The blue-flowered parent must have the genotype $B\\_ pp$. Since it is true-breeding, it must be homozygous: $BBpp$.\n- The white-flowered parent must be homozygous recessive for the $b$ gene ($bb$). Its genotype could be $bbPP$ or $bbpp$.\nThe cross between these two parents produces an F1 generation where all offspring are purple. A purple phenotype requires the genotype $B\\_ P\\_$. This means the F1 generation must have inherited a $B$ allele from one parent and a $P$ allele from the other. The blue parent ($BBpp$) provides the $B$ allele. Therefore, the white parent must have provided the $P$ allele. This forces the genotype of the true-breeding white parent to be $bbPP$.\n\nSo, the parental cross (P) is: $BBpp$ (blue) $\\times$ $bbPP$ (white).\n\nStep 3: Determine the genotype of the F1 generation.\nAll offspring from the cross $BBpp$ $\\times$ $bbPP$ will inherit a $B$ allele and a $p$ allele from the blue parent, and a $b$ allele and a $P$ allele from the white parent. Thus, all F1 offspring will have the genotype $BbPp$. This genotype corresponds to a purple phenotype, which is consistent with the information given in the problem.\n\nStep 4: Determine the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation.\nThe F2 generation is produced by crossing two F1 plants: $BbPp$ $\\times$ $BbPp$. This is a standard dihybrid cross. The expected genotypic ratio among the F2 offspring is:\n- 9/16 $B\\_ P\\_$\n- 3/16 $B\\_ pp$\n- 3/16 $bb P\\_$\n- 1/16 $bb pp$\n\nStep 5: Map the F2 genotypes to their corresponding phenotypes.\nUsing the relationships established in Step 1:\n- 9/16 $B\\_ P\\_$ will be Purple.\n- 3/16 $B\\_ pp$ will be Blue.\n- 3/16 $bb P\\_$ will be White.\n- 1/16 $bb pp$ will be White.\n\nStep 6: Combine the phenotypes to find the final ratio.\n- Proportion of Purple flowers = 9/16\n- Proportion of Blue flowers = 3/16\n- Proportion of White flowers = (3/16 for $bb P\\_$) + (1/16 for $bb pp$) = 4/16\n\nThe final expected phenotypic ratio is 9 purple : 3 blue : 4 white.
