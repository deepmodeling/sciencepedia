This initial practice problem [@problem_id:1522933] challenges you to apply your knowledge of chromosome replication to a specific, clinically relevant scenario. By calculating the total number of sister chromatids aligned at the metaphase plate in a human cell with trisomy 21, you will solidify your understanding of how chromosomes are organized just before segregation.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a specific human cell line characterized by an aneuploidy. A normal human somatic cell has a diploid chromosome number designated as $2n=46$. The cell line under investigation exhibits trisomy for chromosome 21, meaning there are three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. Assuming a cell from this line undergoes a normal mitotic division, determine the total number of sister chromatids that will be aligned at the metaphase plate.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of sister chromatids at the metaphase plate in a human somatic cell with trisomy 21.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of chromosomes in this aneuploid cell. A normal human somatic cell is diploid with $2n=46$ chromosomes. Trisomy 21 means the cell has an extra copy of chromosome 21. Therefore, the total number of chromosomes in this cell is the normal count plus one extra chromosome.\nTotal chromosomes = $46 + 1 = 47$.\n\nNext, we must consider the state of these chromosomes during mitosis. Before mitosis begins, the cell undergoes the S phase of interphase, during which DNA replication occurs. As a result of replication, each of the 47 chromosomes is duplicated. Each duplicated chromosome consists of two identical copies, called sister chromatids, which are joined together at a region called the centromere.\n\nDuring metaphase, which is a stage of mitosis, all the duplicated chromosomes align along the cell's equator, forming what is known as the metaphase plate. At this stage, each of the 47 chromosomes is in its replicated form, composed of two sister chromatids.\n\nTo find the total number of sister chromatids, we need to multiply the total number of chromosomes by the number of sister chromatids per chromosome.\nNumber of sister chromatids per chromosome at metaphase = 2.\nTotal number of chromosomes in the cell = 47.\n\nTotal number of sister chromatids = (Total number of chromosomes) $\\times$ (Number of sister chromatids per chromosome)\nTotal number of sister chromatids = $47 \\times 2 = 94$.\n\nTherefore, a total of 94 sister chromatids would be aligned at the metaphase plate in a human cell with trisomy 21.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{94}$$", "id": "1522933"}, {"introduction": "Mitosis is not just a sequence of events, but a tightly regulated process controlled by molecular machinery. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1522926] delves into the critical transition from metaphase to anaphase by asking you to predict the outcome when a key protein, cohesin, cannot be broken down. This exercise highlights the importance of protein degradation in driving the cell cycle forward and demonstrates how a single molecular failure can halt the entire process.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying a novel, engineered eukaryotic cell line. In these cells, the cohesin protein complex, which is responsible for holding sister chromatids together after DNA replication, has been modified. Specifically, a key subunit of the complex has been mutated such that it is completely resistant to cleavage by the protease enzyme known as separase. Assume all other cellular machinery, including the spindle assembly checkpoint and the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), functions normally.\n\nIf these engineered cells are allowed to enter the mitotic cycle, at which of the following stages will the cell cycle permanently arrest?\n\nA. Prophase\n\nB. Metaphase\n\nC. Anaphase\n\nD. Telophase\n\nE. Interphase", "solution": "1) State the normal roles and sequence of mitotic regulators. After S phase, sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex. During mitosis, arm cohesin is largely removed in prophase/prometaphase, while centromeric cohesin remains to maintain sister chromatid cohesion at kinetochores. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) permits activation of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) only when all kinetochores are properly attached and under tension. Upon SAC satisfaction, APC/C ubiquitinates securin and cyclin B, leading to securin degradation and activation of separase. Activated separase cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin, releasing cohesion and triggering the onset of anaphase.\n\n2) Apply the engineered modification to this sequence. The engineered mutation renders a key cohesin subunit completely resistant to separase cleavage. Therefore, even when APC/C is activated and separase is fully active (normal APC/C and SAC assumed), separase cannot cleave cohesin at centromeres. Sister chromatid cohesion thus persists.\n\n3) Infer the stage at which progression fails. Without cohesin cleavage, sister chromatids cannot separate, which is the defining event for anaphase onset. Although chromosomes can align at the metaphase plate with proper bipolar attachment and tension (thus satisfying the SAC), the mechanical separation that initiates anaphase cannot occur.\n\n4) Conclude the arrest point. Because anaphase onset strictly requires cohesin cleavage by separase, and that cleavage is impossible in these cells, the cell cannot transition out of metaphase. Therefore, the cell will arrest in metaphase rather than progressing to anaphase, telophase, or returning to interphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1522926"}, {"introduction": "The dramatic separation of chromosomes during anaphase is driven by two distinct, coordinated mechanical processes. This problem [@problem_id:1522887] uses a hypothetical drug to selectively inhibit one of these processes, allowing you to clearly distinguish between the poleward movement of chromosomes (anaphase A) and the elongation of the spindle (anaphase B). By analyzing the outcome, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the complex choreography of microtubules and motor proteins required for successful chromosome segregation.", "problem": "In a typical animal cell undergoing mitosis, the separation of sister chromatids during anaphase is a two-part process. The first part, often called anaphase A, involves the shortening of kinetochore microtubules, which pulls the newly separated chromosomes toward the spindle poles. The second part, anaphase B, involves the elongation of the entire cell as motor proteins slide interpolar microtubules past one another, pushing the spindle poles farther apart.\n\nImagine a specialized drug is applied to a culture of dividing cells. This drug selectively and completely inhibits the function of the motor proteins that act on the interpolar microtubules, but has no effect on the machinery responsible for shortening the kinetochore microtubules. Which of the following descriptions most accurately represents the observable state of a cell treated with this drug as it attempts to proceed through anaphase?\n\nA. Sister chromatids would fail to separate, and the chromosomes would remain aligned at the metaphase plate.\n\nB. The chromosomes would separate into two groups and move towards the spindle poles, but the overall cell would not elongate, resulting in the two groups of chromosomes being closer together than in a normal anaphase.\n\nC. The spindle poles would move significantly farther apart, but the sister chromatids would fail to separate and would be stretched between the two poles.\n\nD. The chromosomes would decondense, and a nuclear envelope would reform around a single, tetraploid nucleus at the cell's center.\n\nE. Both sister chromatid separation and spindle pole separation would occur as normal, but cytokinesis would be blocked, resulting in a single large cell with two distinct nuclei.", "solution": "Identify the two mechanical components of anaphase based on established cell biology principles:\n- Anaphase A is driven by the shortening (depolymerization) of kinetochore microtubules, which pulls sister chromatids toward opposite spindle poles.\n- Anaphase B is driven by motor proteins (e.g., kinesin motors) that slide antiparallel interpolar microtubules past one another and by associated forces that push spindle poles apart, thereby elongating the spindle and the cell.\n\nInterpret the drugâ€™s specificity:\n- The drug selectively and completely inhibits motor proteins that act on interpolar microtubules. Therefore, the sliding of interpolar microtubules that produces spindle elongation in anaphase B is blocked.\n- The drug does not affect the machinery responsible for shortening kinetochore microtubules. Therefore, the force-generating depolymerization at kinetochores (and associated poleward flux) remains intact, so anaphase A proceeds.\n\nDeduce the observable consequences:\n- Because anaphase A proceeds, sister chromatids will separate at anaphase onset and move poleward along kinetochore microtubules.\n- Because anaphase B is inhibited, the spindle poles will not be pushed farther apart via interpolar sliding; thus, the spindle will not elongate as it normally does, and the cell as a whole will not elongate.\n\nMap to the provided options:\n- Option A is inconsistent because failure to separate would require blocking kinetochore function or separase activation, neither of which is affected by the drug.\n- Option C reverses the expected effects: it predicts pole separation without chromatid separation, contradicting the stated drug action.\n- Option D describes events of telophase without proper segregation pattern and is unrelated to the specific inhibition described.\n- Option E claims normal anaphase A and B but blocked cytokinesis, which is not targeted by the drug as described.\n- Option B correctly states that chromosomes separate and move toward poles (anaphase A intact), but the cell does not elongate (anaphase B blocked), leaving the two chromosome groups closer together than in a normal anaphase.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1522887"}]}
