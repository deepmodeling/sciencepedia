This first practice focuses on quantifying the products of DNA replication, a key event of the S phase. By calculating the number of sister chromatids present in the G2 phase [@problem_id:1526038], you will reinforce the essential distinction between a chromosome and a chromatid, a concept crucial for tracking genetic information through cell division.", "problem": "A cytogeneticist is studying a newly discovered species of deep-sea cephalopod. Microscopic analysis of a somatic cell in the G1 phase of the cell cycle reveals that the diploid number of chromosomes (2n) for this species is 38. Another somatic cell from the same animal is isolated and observed at a later stage, specifically during the G2 phase, just before the onset of mitosis. How many sister chromatids are present in this single cell during the G2 phase?", "solution": "The diploid number is given as $2n=38$ in G1, so the haploid number is $n=\\frac{2n}{2}=19$. During S phase, DNA replication produces two sister chromatids per chromosome, but the chromosome number (counted by centromeres) remains $2n$. Therefore, at G2 each of the $2n$ chromosomes consists of two sister chromatids, so the total number of sister chromatids is $2 \\times (2n)=4n$. Substituting $n=19$ gives $4 \\times 19=76$. Hence, the single cell in G2 contains $76$ sister chromatids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{76}$$", "id": "1526038"}, {"introduction": "The cell cycle isn't just a sequence of events, but a tightly regulated process controlled by molecular checkpoints. This problem explores the critical role of protein degradation in orchestrating the exit from mitosis. You will analyze a hypothetical scenario involving a non-degradable mitotic cyclin to understand how the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) ensures a clean and irreversible transition out of M phase [@problem_id:1526054].", "problem": "A research team is investigating the regulation of the cell cycle in a cultured line of eukaryotic cells. They genetically engineer these cells to express a mutant form of mitotic cyclin. This mutant cyclin is fully capable of binding to and activating its partner cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), triggering the cell's entry into mitosis. However, the gene for this cyclin has been altered such that the protein it codes for is missing the \"destruction box\" (D-box), a short amino acid sequence that normally targets the protein for degradation by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) during late mitosis. Assume that all other cellular components, including securin (which also possesses a D-box), are normal and functional.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the terminal phenotype of a cell expressing only this mutant form of mitotic cyclin as it attempts to progress through mitosis?\n\nA. The cell will arrest at the metaphase-anaphase transition because the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) cannot be activated.\n\nB. The cell will arrest in metaphase with its chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate, as the sister chromatids will fail to separate.\n\nC. The cell will proceed through anaphase, separating its sister chromatids, but will then arrest with condensed chromosomes and will fail to undergo telophase and cytokinesis.\n\nD. The cell will fail to enter mitosis because the mutant cyclin cannot form a functional complex with its cyclin-dependent kinase.\n\nE. The cell will complete mitosis and cytokinesis normally, but will be unable to enter the G1 phase and will immediately re-replicate its DNA.", "solution": "Normal mitotic control logic:\n1) Entry into mitosis requires active mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes (e.g., cyclin B-CDK1, often termed MPF). These promote chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindle assembly.\n2) The metaphase-anaphase transition requires activation of APC/C bound to Cdc20. When the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, APC/C targets D-box-containing substrates for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Two key APC/C substrates are securin and mitotic cyclins.\n3) Degradation of securin releases separase, which cleaves cohesin to trigger sister chromatid separation (anaphase). Degradation of mitotic cyclin inactivates CDK activity, which is necessary to exit mitosis: spindle disassembly, chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reformation, cytokinesis, and resetting to G1.\n\nEffect of the engineered mutation:\n1) The mutant mitotic cyclin binds and activates CDK normally, so mitotic entry occurs.\n2) The mutant lacks the D-box, so APC/C cannot ubiquitinate and degrade this cyclin; therefore CDK activity remains high.\n3) Securin is normal and contains a D-box, so upon APC/C activation at the metaphase-anaphase transition, securin is degraded, separase is activated, and sister chromatids separate; thus anaphase proceeds.\n4) Because mitotic cyclin persists, CDK activity does not drop. High CDK activity blocks mitotic exit programs (chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reassembly, cytokinesis) and prevents transition to G1.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because APC/C can be activated; its activation does not require cyclin degradation and, in fact, cyclin-CDK activity helps prime APC/C.\n- B is incorrect because securin is degradable; separase activation allows chromatid separation.\n- D is contradicted by the premise that the mutant activates CDK.\n- E is incorrect because mitotic exit requires cyclin degradation; with sustained CDK activity, the cell fails to complete telophase and cytokinesis and also cannot license replication origins for re-replication.\n\nTherefore, the terminal phenotype is progression into anaphase followed by arrest with condensed chromosomes and failure of telophase and cytokinesis, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526054"}, {"introduction": "Critical cell-fate decisions, like committing to a new round of DNA replication, often rely on biochemical \"switches.\" This advanced practice uses a simplified mathematical model to demonstrate how the regulatory network at the G1/S checkpoint functions as a bistable switch. By finding the steady states of this system [@problem_id:1526069], you will see how positive feedback can create an all-or-none response, ensuring the decision to enter S phase is both decisive and irreversible.", "problem": "The transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is a critical decision point for a cell, committing it to DNA replication. This transition is governed by a complex regulatory network. A core component of this network involves the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), the E2F transcription factor, and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) complexes, particularly Cyclin E/CDK2. In its active, hypophosphorylated state, Rb binds to and sequesters E2F, preventing the transcription of genes required for S phase. Mitogenic signals trigger the initial phosphorylation of Rb by Cyclin D/CDK4/6, which causes a partial release of E2F. This released E2F then initiates a positive feedback loop by transcribing its own activator, Cyclin E. The resulting Cyclin E/CDK2 complex further phosphorylates Rb, leading to a massive release of E2F and a full, switch-like commitment to S phase.\n\nTo investigate the quantitative nature of this switch, a simplified model is proposed. Let $A$ represent the effective concentration of the active E2F-CyclinE/CDK2 signaling axis. The time evolution of this activity is described by the following ordinary differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\sigma + \\frac{V_{max} A^2}{K^2 + A^2} - k_{deg} A $$\n\nHere, $\\sigma$ is a parameter representing the strength of the external mitogenic signal, $V_{max}$ is the maximum rate of the autocatalytic positive feedback, $K$ is the activation coefficient for the feedback loop, and $k_{deg}$ is the degradation rate constant for the activity $A$.\n\nConsider a cell where the system parameters have the following values, expressed in a consistent set of units for concentration and time:\n- $\\sigma = \\frac{36}{49}$\n- $V_{max} = \\frac{650}{49}$\n- $K = 7$\n- $k_{deg} = 1$\n\nFor the cell to maintain a stable state, such as G1 arrest (low activity) or S-phase commitment (high activity), the system must be at a steady state where the net rate of change of activity is zero. Several such steady states may exist for a given set of parameters. Determine all possible steady-state concentrations of activity $A$ under these conditions.
