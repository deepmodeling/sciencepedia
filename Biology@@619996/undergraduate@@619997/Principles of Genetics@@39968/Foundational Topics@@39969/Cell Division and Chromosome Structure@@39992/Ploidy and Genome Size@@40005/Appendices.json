This foundational exercise [@problem_id:1510103] provides practice in calculating this number, a crucial first step in genetic analysis. By working backward from the total chromosome count in a somatic cell and its known ploidy level, you will develop a clear grasp of the terminology that underpins all discussions of genome size and structure.", "problem": "A plant geneticist is studying a new cultivar of the garden strawberry (*Fragaria Ã— ananassa*), noted for its exceptionally large fruit. Through cytological analysis of the plant's root tip cells, which are somatic cells, the geneticist determines that this cultivar is an autooctoploid. This means each somatic cell contains eight complete sets of chromosomes, all derived from a single ancestral species. If the total number of chromosomes counted in a single one of these somatic cells is 56, what is the basic (or monoploid) chromosome number, denoted as $x$, for this strawberry?", "solution": "Let $x$ be the basic (monoploid) chromosome number. An autooctoploid has eight complete sets of chromosomes in its somatic cells, so the somatic chromosome number is given by\n$$8x.$$\nGiven that a somatic cell contains $56$ chromosomes, we set\n$$8x=56.$$\nSolving for $x$ by dividing both sides by $8$ gives\n$$x=\\frac{56}{8}=7.$$\nThus, the basic chromosome number is $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1510103"}, {"introduction": "While knowing the static chromosome number is important, a deeper understanding comes from tracking how genetic material is distributed during cell division. This problem [@problem_id:1510075] challenges you to apply your knowledge of meiosis to quantify both the chromosome number ($n$) and the DNA content (C-value) in the products of oogenesis. Mastering this helps in predicting the genetic makeup of gametes and understanding the mechanisms that ensure the correct transmission of a species' genome to the next generation.", "problem": "In a genetics laboratory, a researcher is studying oogenesis in a female house mouse (*Mus musculus*).
