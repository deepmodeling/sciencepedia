This first practice challenges you to apply the concepts of haploid ($n$) and diploid ($2n$) sets of chromosomes to a classic example of interspecies hybridization. By calculating the chromosome number in a mule, you will solidify your understanding of how genetic material is transmitted from parents to offspring, even across different species.", "problem": "In a selective breeding program focused on creating robust hybrid animals, geneticists are studying the cross between a domestic horse (*Equus caballus*) and a domestic donkey (*Equus asinus*). A somatic cell, which is any cell of a living organism other than the reproductive cells, from a horse is found to have a diploid chromosome number of $2n = 64$. A somatic cell from a donkey has a diploid chromosome number of $2n = 62$. The hybrid offspring, known as a mule, is produced by the fertilization of a female horse's gamete (egg cell) by a male donkey's gamete (sperm cell). A gamete is a reproductive cell containing a haploid number of chromosomes.\n\nAssuming normal meiotic division in both parent animals and subsequent fertilization, calculate the total number of chromosomes you would expect to find in a single somatic cell of the resulting mule.", "solution": "A somatic cell is diploid, so the given values are $2n_{\\text{horse}}=64$ and $2n_{\\text{donkey}}=62$. By the meiotic principle that gametes are haploid, each parent’s gamete carries half the diploid number:\n$$\nn_{\\text{horse}}=\\frac{2n_{\\text{horse}}}{2}=\\frac{64}{2}=32,\\qquad n_{\\text{donkey}}=\\frac{2n_{\\text{donkey}}}{2}=\\frac{62}{2}=31.\n$$\nFertilization combines one haploid gamete from each parent, so the mule zygote has\n$$\nN_{\\text{zygote}}=n_{\\text{horse}}+n_{\\text{donkey}}=32+31=63.\n$$\nSomatic cells arise by mitosis, which preserves chromosome number; therefore the mule’s somatic cells have\n$$\nN_{\\text{somatic}}=N_{\\text{zygote}}=63.\n$$\nHence, a single somatic cell of the mule contains $63$ chromosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63}$$", "id": "1476703"}, {"introduction": "An incorrect chromosome number, or aneuploidy, is a major source of genetic disorders. This problem takes you into the cellular mechanics of meiosis to explore how such errors can occur. By comparing the outcomes of nondisjunction in meiosis I versus meiosis II, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the precision required in cell division and the specific consequences when it fails.", "problem": "In human genetics, aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a leading cause of miscarriages and genetic disorders. It often arises from a meiotic error called nondisjunction, where chromosomes fail to separate properly during cell division. Consider a single pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid human primary meiocyte entering meiosis. We will compare the consequences of a single nondisjunction event occurring at two different stages.\n\nScenario 1: Nondisjunction of the homologous chromosomes occurs during meiosis I.\nScenario 2: Nondisjunction of the sister chromatids occurs in just one of the two secondary meiocytes during meiosis II.\n\nAssuming meiosis is completed in both scenarios, which of the following statements correctly compares the resulting sets of four gametes produced from these two events? Let $n$ represent the haploid number of chromosomes. Aneuploid gametes are those with a chromosome number other than $n$ (e.g., $n+1$ or $n-1$).\n\nA. Nondisjunction in meiosis I results in 50% aneuploid gametes, while nondisjunction in meiosis II results in 100% aneuploid gametes.\n\nB. Nondisjunction in meiosis I results in 100% aneuploid gametes, while nondisjunction in meiosis II results in 50% aneuploid gametes.\n\nC. Nondisjunction in meiosis I produces only $n+1$ gametes, while nondisjunction in meiosis II produces only $n-1$ gametes.\n\nD. Both nondisjunction in meiosis I and meiosis II result in 100% aneuploid gametes.\n\nE. Both nondisjunction in meiosis I and meiosis II result in 50% aneuploid gametes.", "solution": "Let $n$ denote the haploid number of chromosomes, and assume that only a single chromosome pair is affected while all other chromosomes segregate normally. A gamete is euploid if it has $n$ chromosomes and aneuploid if it has a number different from $n$, such as $n+1$ or $n-1$.\n\nScenario 1 (nondisjunction in meiosis I): In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are supposed to segregate to opposite poles. A nondisjunction event means both homologs migrate to the same pole at anaphase I. Consequently, after meiosis I, one secondary meiocyte is disomic for the affected chromosome (it contains both homologs) and the other secondary meiocyte is nullisomic (it contains none). In meiosis II, sister chromatids separate within each secondary meiocyte. From the disomic secondary meiocyte, each of its two daughter gametes receives one chromatid from each homolog, yielding gametes that carry two copies of that chromosome, i.e., $n+1$. From the nullisomic secondary meiocyte, each of its two daughter gametes receives no copy of that chromosome, yielding $n-1$. Therefore, the four gametes are two $n+1$ and two $n-1$, so all four are aneuploid, i.e., the aneuploid fraction is $1$.\n\nScenario 2 (nondisjunction in meiosis II in just one secondary meiocyte): In meiosis I, homologs segregate normally, producing two secondary meiocytes each with one homolog of the affected pair. In meiosis II, sister chromatids should separate. A nondisjunction event in only one of the two secondary meiocytes causes its sister chromatids of the affected chromosome to migrate together to one pole. Thus, that abnormal secondary meiocyte produces one gamete with two copies of the chromosome ($n+1$) and one gamete with none ($n-1$). The other, normal secondary meiocyte produces two euploid gametes ($n$) because its sister chromatids separate properly. Therefore, among the four gametes, there are two euploid ($n$) and two aneuploid ($n+1$ and $n-1$), so the aneuploid fraction is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nComparing the two scenarios: meiosis I nondisjunction yields a $100\\%$ aneuploid fraction (all four gametes aneuploid), while meiosis II nondisjunction in one secondary meiocyte yields an aneuploid fraction of $50\\%$.

Arm ratio of 0.60, Metacentric", "solution": "The problem asks for the new arm ratio and morphology of a chromosome after a pericentric inversion. We are given the initial lengths of the p-arm and q-arm, the locations of the breakpoints, and the classification scheme for chromosome morphology.\n\nFirst, let's identify the initial state of the chromosome.\nThe initial length of the short arm (p-arm) is $L_{p, \\text{initial}} = 3.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe initial length of the long arm (q-arm) is $L_{q, \\text{initial}} = 7.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe initial arm ratio is $R_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{L_{q, \\text{initial}}}{L_{p, \\text{initial}}} = \\frac{7.0}{3.0} \\approx 2.33$.\nAccording to the classification ($1.70 \\le 2.33 < 3.00$), the chromosome is indeed submetacentric, as stated in the problem.\n\nA pericentric inversion is a chromosomal rearrangement where a segment that includes the centromere is excised and reinserted in the reverse orientation. The breakpoints are given at distances $d_p = 2.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$ from the centromere on the p-arm and $d_q = 4.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$ from the centromere on the q-arm.\n\nLet's break down each arm into two segments: the proximal segment (from the centromere to the breakpoint) which will be part of the inversion, and the distal segment (from the breakpoint to the telomere) which will not.\n\nFor the p-arm:\n- Length of the proximal segment (to be inverted): $d_p = 2.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Length of the distal segment (not inverted): $L_{p, \\text{distal}} = L_{p, \\text{initial}} - d_p = 3.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} - 2.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} = 1.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFor the q-arm:\n- Length of the proximal segment (to be inverted): $d_q = 4.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Length of the distal segment (not inverted): $L_{q, \\text{distal}} = L_{q, \\text{initial}} - d_q = 7.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} - 4.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} = 3.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nDuring the pericentric inversion, the segment containing the centromere, bounded by the two breakpoints, is flipped. This means that the proximal segment of the p-arm (length $d_p$) gets attached to the distal segment of the q-arm, and the proximal segment of the q-arm (length $d_q$) gets attached to the distal segment of the p-arm.\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the two new arms. We will call them Arm 1 and Arm 2 for now.\n\nThe new length of the arm on the original \"p-side\" (Arm 1) is composed of the original distal p-segment and the inverted proximal q-segment:\n$L_{\\text{Arm 1}} = L_{p, \\text{distal}} + d_q = 1.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} + 4.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} = 5.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nThe new length of the arm on the original \"q-side\" (Arm 2) is composed of the original distal q-segment and the inverted proximal p-segment:\n$L_{\\text{Arm 2}} = L_{q, \\text{distal}} + d_p = 3.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} + 2.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m} = 5.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nAfter the inversion, both arms have a length of $5.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nNow, we apply the convention that the p-arm is the short arm and the q-arm is the long arm. Since the new arms are of equal length, it does not matter which we call p or q.\nLet the new p-arm length be $L_{p, \\text{new}} = 5.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\nLet the new q-arm length be $L_{q, \\text{new}} = 5.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nThe new arm ratio is calculated as:\n$R_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{L_{q, \\text{new}}}{L_{p, \\text{new}}} = \\frac{5.0}{5.0} = 1.00$.\n\nFinally, we use the given classification to determine the new morphology. The metacentric range is defined as $1.00 \\le R < 1.70$. Since our new ratio $R_{\\text{new}} = 1.00$, the chromosome is now classified as metacentric.\n\nThe result is an arm ratio of 1.00 and a metacentric morphology.
