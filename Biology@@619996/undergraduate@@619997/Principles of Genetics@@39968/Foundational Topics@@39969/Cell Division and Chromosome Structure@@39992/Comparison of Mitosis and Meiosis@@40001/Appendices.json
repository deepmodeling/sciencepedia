We apply standard chromosome and DNA accounting rules across cell cycle stages and meiotic divisions.\n\nA. A somatic skin cell in G1 has not yet undergone DNA replication. In G1, the number of chromosomes equals the diploid number:\n$$C_{\\text{G1}}=2n=28.$$\n\nB. A primary spermatocyte is a diploid cell that has completed S phase and is entering meiosis I. After S phase, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so the number of DNA molecules (each chromatid corresponds to one DNA double helix) doubles relative to G1. Thus, the chromosome count remains $2n$, but the DNA molecule count is $4C$ (where C is the DNA content of a haploid cell), equivalent to the DNA content of $2 \\times (2n)$ chromosomes from G1:\n$$D_{\\text{primary spermatocyte}}=2 \\times 2n = 56.$$\n\nC. A secondary oocyte is produced after meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes segregate into different cells.

A human diploid cell has $2n=46$ chromosomes; thus $46$ individual chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, align independently.\n- In meiosis I (metaphase I), homologous chromosomes pair to form tetrads (bivalents); therefore, there are $n=23$ aligned structures, each a homologous pair (tetrad), with two chromosomes (four chromatids) per structure.\n\nTherefore:\n- Cell A is in metaphase of mitosis (because it shows $46$ individually aligned replicated chromosomes).\n- Cell B is in metaphase I of meiosis (because it shows $23$ tetrads/bivalents).\n\nNow determine the outcomes upon completion of the respective full division processes.\n\nFor Cell A (mitosis):\n- Anaphase separates sister chromatids, distributing one chromatid from each chromosome to opposite poles.\n- Telophase and cytokinesis produce two daughter cells, each with the same chromosome number as the parent, i.e., $2n=46$. Immediately after division, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid; after S phase in the next cycle, chromosomes will replicate again.\n- The two daughter cells are genetically identical to each other (barring mutation), because mitosis preserves the genome without recombination or independent assortment.\n\nFor Cell B (meiosis, starting at metaphase I):\n- Anaphase I separates homologous chromosomes; sister chromatids remain together.\n- Telophase I and cytokinesis produce two cells that are haploid in chromosome set (each has $n=23$ chromosomes), but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids.\n- Meiosis II then separates sister chromatids, producing a total of four haploid cells, each with $n=23$ chromosomes, each chromosome now consisting of a single chromatid.\n- Due to independent assortment and crossing over in meiosis I, the final products are genetically distinct from each other.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n- A: False. Mitosis yields diploid daughters with $2n=46$, not haploid $23$.\n- B: False. Meiosis yields haploid products; not diploid $46$.\n- C: True. Mitosis (Cell A) produces genetically identical daughters; meiosis (Cell B), after its full process, produces genetically distinct haploid cells.\n- D: False. Mitosis produces two cells; meiosis produces four.\n- E: False.

Consequently, after Meiosis I, the two secondary meiocytes have chromosome counts $n+1$ and $n-1$, respectively, because one received both homologs and the other received none. Meiosis II proceeds normally (sister chromatids separate), so each secondary meiocyte produces two gametes reflecting its own chromosome count.
