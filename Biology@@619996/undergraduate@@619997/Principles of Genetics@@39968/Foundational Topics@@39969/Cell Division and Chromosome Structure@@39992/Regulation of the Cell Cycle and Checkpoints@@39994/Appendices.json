{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Foundational discoveries in cell biology often come from clever experiments that reveal underlying control mechanisms. This first practice places you in the role of an early cell cycle researcher, using a classic cell fusion thought experiment. By predicting the outcome when a G1 phase cell is fused with an S phase cell, you can deduce the existence and dominant nature of diffusible factors in the cytoplasm that actively promote DNA replication [@problem_id:2312612].", "problem": "In a series of landmark cell fusion experiments, researchers investigated the cytoplasmic signals that regulate the progression of the cell cycle. Consider a population of actively dividing mammalian somatic cells in culture. The cell cycle for these cells consists of four distinct phases: G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), G2 (second gap), and M (mitosis). Using techniques for inducing cell fusion, a single cell in the G1 phase is fused with a single cell in the S phase, creating a single, larger cell with two distinct nuclei in a shared cytoplasm.\n\nBased on the known principles of cell cycle control, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of the nucleus that was originally in the G1 phase?\n\nA. The G1 nucleus will immediately enter S phase and begin DNA replication.\n\nB. The G1 nucleus will remain in the G1 phase until the S-phase nucleus has completed DNA replication.\n\nC. The G1 nucleus will skip the S and G2 phases and proceed directly into mitosis, leading to premature chromosome condensation.\n\nD. The S-phase nucleus will halt its DNA replication and revert to the G1 phase to synchronize with the G1 nucleus.\n\nE. Both nuclei will be arrested in their respective phases, and the fused cell will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to conflicting regulatory signals.", "solution": "The solution to this problem lies in understanding that the cell cycle is driven by diffusible regulatory proteins in the cytoplasm. The presence or absence of these factors at different stages dicates the transitions between phases.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key regulatory state of the fused cells.\nThe problem describes the fusion of a G1-phase cell and an S-phase cell. The G1-phase cell is prepared for DNA replication but has not yet received the signal to begin. The S-phase cell is actively replicating its DNA. This active state is maintained by specific cytoplasmic factors.\n\nStep 2: Characterize the cytoplasmic environment of the S-phase cell.\nA cell in S phase has a high concentration of S-phase promoting factors. These are primarily complexes of specific cyclins (S-cyclins) and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs). These S-Cdk complexes are active and are responsible for initiating and maintaining DNA synthesis by phosphorylating various proteins, including those that form the pre-replicative complexes at origins of replication.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the consequences of cell fusion.\nWhen the G1 cell and the S cell fuse, their cytoplasms mix. The S-phase promoting factors (the active S-Cdk complexes) from the S-phase cell's cytoplasm become distributed throughout the shared cytoplasm of the newly formed hybrid cell. These factors can then diffuse into the nucleus that came from the G1 cell.\n\nStep 4: Determine the effect of S-phase factors on the G1 nucleus.\nThe nucleus from the G1 cell has already passed the restriction point (or START point), meaning it is committed to division and has assembled pre-replicative complexes on its DNA. It is essentially \"licensed\" for replication and is waiting for the go-ahead signal. The active S-Cdk complexes from the S-phase cytoplasm provide this signal. They phosphorylate the necessary targets within the G1 nucleus, activating the origins of replication and initiating DNA synthesis. Therefore, the G1 nucleus is immediately driven into S phase.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n- Option A: \"The G1 nucleus will immediately enter S phase and begin DNA replication.\" This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The diffusible S-phase promoting factors in the shared cytoplasm act on the G1 nucleus, inducing it to enter S phase. This is the correct outcome.\n\n- Option B: \"The G1 nucleus will remain in the G1 phase until the S-phase nucleus has completed DNA replication.\" This is incorrect. There is no known mechanism that would inhibit the active S-phase factors from acting on the receptive G1 nucleus. The signals are \"dominant\" and act immediately.\n\n- Option C: \"The G1 nucleus will skip the S and G2 phases and proceed directly into mitosis...\" This describes what happens when an interphase cell (G1, S, or G2) is fused with a cell in M-phase. The M-phase cell contains active M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF), which causes premature chromosome condensation. The S-phase cell does not have active MPF, so this outcome will not occur.\n\n- Option D: \"The S-phase nucleus will halt its DNA replication and revert to the G1 phase...\" This is incorrect. The cell cycle is a tightly regulated and unidirectional process. Active S-phase factors cannot be \"overridden\" by the G1 state, and an S-phase nucleus cannot revert to G1.\n\n- Option E: \"Both nuclei will be arrested... and the fused cell will undergo apoptosis...\" While severe cellular stress can trigger apoptosis, this specific experimental fusion is a classic demonstration of a fundamental regulatory mechanism. The signals are not \"conflicting\" in a way that causes cell death; rather, the S-phase signals are dominant and induce a state change in the G1 nucleus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312612"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of dominant cytoplasmic regulators, this exercise explores the master switch for entering mitosis. Here, we simulate another landmark experiment: injecting cytoplasm from a cell in mitosis into a cell resting in the G2 phase. This practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF) to predict the dramatic and immediate changes it induces, reinforcing the concept of a command-and-control signal for cell division [@problem_id:2312641].", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a classic experiment is performed to investigate the regulation of the cell cycle. A researcher isolates cytoplasm from a donor vertebrate cell that is actively undergoing mitosis, specifically in metaphase. This cytoplasm is then carefully injected into a recipient cell from the same cell line, which has been synchronized and is confirmed to be in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Assuming the volume of cytoplasm injected is sufficient to induce a cellular response, which of the following choices most accurately describes the immediate and primary consequences observed in the nucleus of the recipient cell?\n\nA. The nuclear envelope will break down, and the chromatin will begin to condense into distinct chromosomes.\n\nB. The cell will immediately enter S phase, and DNA replication will be re-initiated.\n\nC. The sister chromatids will separate and begin migrating towards opposite poles of the cell.\n\nD. The cell will become permanently arrested in the G2 phase, unable to proceed with division.\n\nE. The chromatin will decondense, and a new nuclear envelope will form around it.", "solution": "We are asked about the immediate and primary consequences in the nucleus of a G2-phase recipient cell after injection of cytoplasm from a metaphase cell. The key principle from classic cell fusion and cytoplasmic transfer experiments (e.g., Masui and Markert, Xenopus egg assays; Rao and Johnson) is that mitotic cytoplasm contains a diffusible activity that can drive a G2 cell into mitosis. This activity is the M-phase promoting factor, MPF, which is the active Cyclin B-Cdk1 complex.\n\nLogical steps:\n1. A G2-phase cell has not yet activated Cdk1 with Cyclin B to high MPF activity. Its nuclear envelope is intact, and chromatin is decondensed.\n2. Metaphase cytoplasm contains high MPF activity. Injecting sufficient metaphase cytoplasm into a G2 cell effectively raises the MPF activity in the recipient cell to mitotic levels.\n3. Active MPF phosphorylates numerous substrates that execute mitotic entry. Two primary nuclear targets are:\n   - Nuclear lamins: MPF-dependent phosphorylation of lamins disrupts the nuclear lamina, causing nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD).\n   - Chromatin-associated proteins: MPF activates condensins and leads to phosphorylation of histones (for example, histone H3), promoting chromatin condensation into distinct mitotic chromosomes.\n4. Therefore, the immediate and primary nuclear consequences are nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin condensation, which correspond to early mitotic events (prophase/prometaphase).\n\nExcluding the other options:\n- Option B is incorrect because MPF drives mitotic entry, not S phase. DNA replication is driven by G1/S cyclins and S-phase Cdks and is actively inhibited by high MPF.\n- Option C is incorrect because sister chromatid separation requires activation of the anaphase-promoting complex, APC/C, to ubiquitinate securin and Cyclin B, activating separase. Metaphase cytoplasm is characterized by high MPF and an active spindle checkpoint that restrains APC/C; thus, anaphase onset is not the immediate consequence of MPF addition to a G2 cell.\n- Option D is incorrect because MPF does not arrest cells in G2; it triggers the G2 to M transition.\n- Option E is incorrect because chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope reassembly occur during mitotic exit, when MPF activity falls due to Cyclin B degradation; injected metaphase cytoplasm raises, rather than lowers, MPF activity.\n\nHence, the correct immediate nuclear response is nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin condensation into chromosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312641"}, {"introduction": "Moving from experimental manipulations to genetic analysis is a crucial step in understanding any biological pathway. This final practice presents a complex scenario involving a cell with two engineered mutations that create conflicting signals in the cell cycle control system. By dissecting the roles of the Wee1 kinase and Cyclin B, you will learn to logically determine which molecular block is dominant, a skill essential for predicting the consequences of genetic defects and for designing targeted therapies [@problem_id:2312647].", "problem": "In a typical eukaryotic cell, the transition from the G2 phase to the M phase (mitosis) is driven by an increase in the activity of a protein complex called Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF). MPF is a dimer composed of a regulatory subunit, Cyclin B, and a catalytic subunit, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (Cdk1).\n\nThe activity of MPF is tightly regulated through several mechanisms:\n1.  **Cyclin B Accumulation**: The concentration of Cyclin B gradually increases during the S and G2 phases, allowing it to bind to and form a complex with Cdk1.\n2.  **Inhibitory Phosphorylation**: The Cdk1 subunit within the MPF complex is phosphorylated by an enzyme called Wee1 kinase at an inhibitory site. This phosphorylation keeps the MPF complex inactive, even as Cyclin B levels rise.\n3.  **Activation**: To enter mitosis, a phosphatase (Cdc25) removes the inhibitory phosphate from Cdk1, leading to a sharp spike in MPF activity.\n4.  **Inactivation**: To exit mitosis and enter the subsequent G1 phase, the Cyclin B subunit is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by a large protein complex known as the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). The destruction of Cyclin B leads to a collapse in MPF activity.\n\nConsider a line of laboratory-cultured cells that has been engineered to carry two distinct mutations:\n- **Mutation 1**: A gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Wee1 kinase, which results in the enzyme being constitutively hyperactive.\n- **Mutation 2**: A mutation in the gene encoding Cyclin B that modifies the protein by removing its destruction box sequence, rendering it completely resistant to degradation by the APC/C.\n\nAssuming these cells were synchronized and allowed to proceed through the cell cycle, at which specific phase would this population of double-mutant cells predominantly arrest?\n\nA. G1 phase\n\nB. S phase\n\nC. G2 phase\n\nD. M phase\n\nE. The cells will cycle normally and not arrest.\n\nF. The cells will undergo apoptosis immediately after DNA replication.", "solution": "Define $A_{\\mathrm{MPF}}$ as the activity of the Cyclin B:Cdk1 complex. MPF activation requires both Cyclin B binding and removal of the inhibitory phosphate on Cdk1 by Cdc25. Let $\\phi_{\\mathrm{inh}} \\in [0,1]$ denote the fraction of Cdk1 in the inhibitory phosphorylated state imposed by Wee1. Then, schematically,\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{MPF}} \\propto [\\mathrm{CycB{:}Cdk1}] \\cdot \\left(1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{inh}}\\right).\n$$\nHigh $[\\mathrm{CycB}]$ increases $[\\mathrm{CycB{:}Cdk1}]$, but if $\\phi_{\\mathrm{inh}}$ is near $1$, MPF remains inactive.\n\nMutation 1 (constitutively hyperactive Wee1) drives inhibitory phosphorylation persistently, so $\\phi_{\\mathrm{inh}} \\to 1$ despite Cyclin B accumulation. As a result,\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{MPF}} \\to 0,\n$$\nand the G2-to-M transition fails, causing arrest before mitotic entry (G2 checkpoint is not passed).\n\nMutation 2 (Cyclin B lacking the destruction box) would prevent APC/C-mediated Cyclin B degradation and thus block exit from mitosis only if cells had already entered mitosis and activated APC/C. However, because $A_{\\mathrm{MPF}}$ does not rise due to Mutation 1, cells do not enter M phase, so APC/C action and Cyclin B degradation status are functionally irrelevant in this double mutant context.\n\nTherefore, the earliest and dominant block is at the G2-to-M transition, yielding a predominant arrest in the G2 phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2312647"}]}
