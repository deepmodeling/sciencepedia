{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise provides a fundamental check on your understanding of chromosome numbers and structure during meiosis II. By starting with the diploid number, $2n$, of an organism, you will practice calculating the number of chromatids present in a cell at metaphase II. This practice reinforces the key concept that meiosis I is a reductional division while meiosis II is an equational one, a foundational skill for any further genetic analysis [@problem_id:1522580].", "id": "1522580", "problem": "A genetic researcher is studying gametogenesis in a newly discovered mammal. Through cytological analysis of its somatic cells, the researcher determines that the diploid chromosome number for this species is $2n=46$. The study then focuses on observing cells undergoing meiosis. For a single cell that has completed meiosis I and is now progressing through meiosis II, what is the total number of chromatids that will be aligned along the equatorial plate during the metaphase II stage?\n\n", "solution": "We are given that the species has diploid chromosome number $2n=46$. By definition, the haploid number is $n$, so from $2n=46$ it follows that\n$$\nn=\\frac{2n}{2}=\\frac{46}{2}=23.\n$$\nKey meiotic principles:\n- Meiosis I is a reductional division: homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number from $2n$ to $n$, but sister chromatids remain joined at their centromeres. Therefore, after meiosis I, each daughter cell contains $n$ chromosomes, each still composed of two sister chromatids.\n- In metaphase II, these $n$ chromosomes align individually along the equatorial plate; separation of sister chromatids has not yet occurred.\n\nHence, in a single cell at metaphase II:\n- Number of chromosomes aligned $=n=23$.\n- Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so the total number of chromatids present (and associated with the aligned chromosomes) is\n$$\n2 \\times n = 2 \\times 23 = 46.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of chromatids aligned along the equatorial plate during metaphase II is $46$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{46}$$"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've established the chromosomal counts, let's explore the genetic consequences of meiosis. This problem asks you to predict the genotypes of spermatids resulting from a single meiotic event, connecting the mechanical process of chromosome segregation to Mendel's laws. By considering the outcomes for a dihybrid individual with genotype $AaBb$, this exercise highlights how independent assortment in meiosis I sets the stage for the final separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II, ultimately determining the genetic makeup of gametes [@problem_id:1522565].", "id": "1522565", "problem": "In a particular animal species, a primary spermatocyte is heterozygous for two unlinked genes that control fur color (Gene A) and tail length (Gene B). The genotype of this cell is $AaBb$. This single primary spermatocyte undergoes meiosis to produce four spermatids. Assume that no crossing over occurs between these genes and their respective centromeres, and that the process of meiosis is completed without any errors like nondisjunction.\n\nWhich of the following options represent a complete and possible set of haploid genotypes for the four spermatids resulting from this single meiotic event? This is a multiple-choice question where one or more options may be correct. Select all valid options.\n\nA. The set of four genotypes is $\\{AB, AB, ab, ab\\}$.\nB. The set of four genotypes is $\\{Ab, Ab, aB, aB\\}$.\nC. The set of four genotypes is $\\{AB, Ab, aB, ab\\}$.\nD. The set of four genotypes is $\\{Aa, Aa, Bb, Bb\\}$.\nE. The set of four genotypes is $\\{A, a, B, b\\}$.\nF. The set of four genotypes is $\\{AaBb, AaBb, AaBb, AaBb\\}$.\n\n", "solution": "We begin with a single primary spermatocyte of genotype $AaBb$. By the law of segregation, each gamete must receive exactly one allele from each homologous pair, so each haploid product must carry one allele at locus $A$ (either $A$ or $a$) and one allele at locus $B$ (either $B$ or $b$). Because the two genes are unlinked, the homologous chromosome pairs for $A$ and $B$ assort independently at meiosis I.\n\nThe statement \"no crossing over occurs between these genes and their respective centromeres\" implies that, for each locus, the allele carried by a chromatid remains fixed relative to its centromere; hence, sister chromatids are identical with respect to $A$ and to $B$. Therefore, after meiosis I, each secondary spermatocyte carries duplicated chromosomes whose sister chromatids are identical at $A$ and at $B$. Consequently, meiosis II will separate identical sister chromatids and produce two identical haploid spermatids from each secondary spermatocyte.\n\nThere are exactly two possible orientations (independent assortment outcomes) at meiosis I:\n1. The $A$ and $B$ homologs move to the same pole, and the $a$ and $b$ homologs move to the opposite pole. This yields two secondary spermatocytes carrying $AB$ and two carrying $ab$. After meiosis II, the four spermatids are\n$$\n\\{AB, AB, ab, ab\\},\n$$\nwhich matches option A.\n\n2. The $A$ homolog moves with the $b$ homolog to one pole, and the $a$ homolog moves with the $B$ homolog to the opposite pole. This yields two secondary spermatocytes carrying $Ab$ and two carrying $aB$. After meiosis II, the four spermatids are\n$$\n\\{Ab, Ab, aB, aB\\},\n$$\nwhich matches option B.\n\nOption C, $\\{AB, Ab, aB, ab\\}$, would require both independent assortment orientations to be realized within a single meiosis or require crossing over between the genes and their centromeres to create all four combinations from one alignment. Since a single meiosis I event chooses only one orientation and no crossing over is allowed as stated, C is not possible from a single meiotic division.\n\nOptions D, E, and F are invalid because each spermatid must be haploid for the entire genome and must carry exactly one allele at each locus. Specifically:\n- In D, $\\{Aa, Aa, Bb, Bb\\}$ lists genotypes that are diploid at a single locus and fails to provide complete haploid genotypes for both loci per spermatid.\n- In E, $\\{A, a, B, b\\}$ lists single alleles rather than complete haploid genotypes $(\\text{one of } \\{A,a\\}) \\times (\\text{one of } \\{B,b\\})$ for each spermatid.\n- In F, $\\{AaBb, AaBb, AaBb, AaBb\\}$ are diploid genotypes; spermatids must be haploid.\n\nTherefore, the only complete and possible sets of haploid genotypes from this single meiosis are those in options A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from observing the process of meiosis to understanding its underlying molecular control. It presents a hypothetical scenario where a critical enzyme, separase, is non-functional, challenging you to predict the outcome of anaphase II. This thought experiment will deepen your understanding of how molecular machinery drives chromosome segregation and why the precise regulation of proteins like separase is essential for successful gamete formation [@problem_id:1522587].", "id": "1522587", "problem": "In a research project focused on cell cycle regulation, a line of germ cells from a diploid organism is genetically modified. The modification results in a complete loss of function for the enzyme separase, a protease crucial for chromosome segregation. These engineered cells are then induced to undergo meiosis. Assuming that meiosis I proceeds without error and generates two haploid secondary gametocytes, each of which then enters meiosis II, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of one of these cells at the conclusion of the time period normally allocated for anaphase II?\n\nA. The chromosomes, each still composed of two sister chromatids held together at the centromere, will be aligned at the metaphase plate.\nB. Sister chromatids will have separated, and sets of single-chromatid chromosomes will be found clustered at the opposite poles of the cell.\nC. Homologous chromosome pairs will be randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, having failed to segregate during meiosis I.\nD. The cell will contain double the haploid number of single-chromatid chromosomes, all located within a single nucleus, due to a failure in cytokinesis.\nE. The chromosomes, each consisting of only a single chromatid, will be aligned at the metaphase plate.\n\n", "solution": "Separase is a protease that triggers chromatid or homolog separation by cleaving cohesin. In meiosis I, separase cleaves cohesin along chromosome arms to allow homologous chromosomes to segregate, while centromeric cohesin is protected by shugoshin; in meiosis II, separase must cleave the remaining centromeric cohesin so that sister chromatids can separate at anaphase II.\n\nThe problem stipulates a complete loss of separase function but also assumes that meiosis I proceeds without error to produce haploid secondary gametocytes; this premise is accepted as given. Each haploid secondary gametocyte then enters meiosis II with chromosomes still composed of two sister chromatids held together at the centromere by cohesin.\n\nIn meiosis II, metaphase II is characterized by bi-orientation of sister kinetochores to opposite spindle poles, aligning the chromosomes at the metaphase plate while cohesin at centromeres maintains sister chromatid cohesion. Transition to anaphase II normally requires activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, degradation of securin, and activation of separase, which cleaves centromeric cohesin to allow sister chromatids to disjoin and move to opposite poles.\n\nWith separase nonfunctional, centromeric cohesin cannot be cleaved. Consequently, even if spindle attachments create tension and the cell enters the time window corresponding to anaphase II, sister chromatids remain physically linked at their centromeres and cannot move to opposite poles. They therefore fail to segregate and remain aligned at the metaphase plate as intact chromosomes composed of two sister chromatids.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A correctly states that chromosomes, each still with two sister chromatids joined at the centromere, remain aligned at the metaphase plate.\n- B describes the normal outcome of anaphase II and is impossible without separase.\n- C contradicts the given assumption that meiosis I succeeded.\n- D attributes the outcome to failed cytokinesis and incorrectly describes single-chromatid chromosomes in one nucleus.\n- E claims single-chromatid chromosomes at the metaphase plate, which would require centromeric cohesin cleavage that cannot occur without separase.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}]}
