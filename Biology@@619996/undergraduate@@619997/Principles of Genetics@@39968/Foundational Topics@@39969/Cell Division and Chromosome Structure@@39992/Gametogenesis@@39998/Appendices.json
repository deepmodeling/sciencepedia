This first practice provides a foundational exercise in calculating the potential genetic diversity of gametes produced by a single individual. By applying this principle to a hypothetical trihybrid organism, you will master a fundamental skill for predicting the variety of outcomes in genetic crosses [@problem_id:1489535].", "problem": "In a newly discovered species of bioluminescent fungus, three distinct genes control its observable traits. The first gene, located on chromosome 1, determines the color of the glow (alleles $A$ for aqua and $a$ for amber). The second gene, on chromosome 2, governs the pulsation pattern of the light (alleles $B$ for blinking and $b$ for steady). The third gene, on chromosome 3, controls the presence of a supportive stalk (alleles $C$ for stalked and $c$ for stalkless).\n\nAn individual fungus has the genotype $AaBbcc$. Assuming that the three genes assort independently during meiosis, calculate the total number of genetically distinct gametes this individual can produce.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of unique gamete types that can be produced by an individual with the genotype $AaBbcc$. The key principle to apply is Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, which states that alleles for different genes—located on different chromosomes—are passed to offspring independently of one another. We can determine the total number of unique gametes by considering each gene locus separately and then combining the possibilities.\n\nLet's analyze the genotype locus by locus:\n\n1.  **Gene for Glow Color (Genotype $Aa$)**: This gene locus is heterozygous. During meiosis, the homologous chromosomes carrying these alleles will segregate. As a result, a gamete can receive either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele. This gives 2 distinct possibilities for this gene.\n\n2.  **Gene for Pulsation Pattern (Genotype $Bb$)**: This gene locus is also heterozygous. Similar to the first gene, the alleles $B$ and $b$ will segregate into different gametes. This also gives 2 distinct possibilities ($B$ or $b$) for this gene.\n\n3.  **Gene for Stalk Presence (Genotype $cc$)**: This gene locus is homozygous recessive. The individual only possesses the $c$ allele for this trait. Therefore, every gamete produced must contain the $c$ allele. This gives only 1 possibility for this gene.\n\nTo find the total number of unique combinations of alleles in the gametes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each gene.\n\nTotal unique gametes = (possibilities from gene A) $\\times$ (possibilities from gene B) $\\times$ (possibilities from gene C)\nTotal unique gametes = $2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4$\n\nThe four genetically distinct gametes that can be produced are: $ABc$, $Abc$, $aBc$, and $abc$.\n\nAlternatively, one can use the general formula $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of heterozygous gene pairs. In the genotype $AaBbcc$, there are two heterozygous pairs ($Aa$ and $Bb$). The $cc$ pair is homozygous and does not contribute to the variety of gametes.\nSo, $n=2$.\nThe number of unique gametes is $2^n = 2^2 = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1489535"}, {"introduction": "Beyond tracking alleles, understanding gametogenesis requires visualizing the journey of chromosomes through the two stages of meiosis. This process systematically reduces chromosome number, ensuring the resulting gametes are haploid. This next exercise challenges you to quantify the changes in chromosome and chromatid numbers during meiosis I, reinforcing your understanding of reductional division and the state of genetic material in a secondary spermatocyte [@problem_id:1708251].", "problem": "In a particular species of mammal, somatic cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are diploid and contain 24 chromosomes ($2n = 24$). A researcher is studying spermatogenesis in a male from this species. A single primary spermatocyte, after completing the S phase of interphase, enters meiosis.

A primary spermatocyte arises as a diploid cell and, after completing S phase, each chromosome has replicated into two sister chromatids while the chromosome number remains unchanged. Therefore, immediately after S phase, the primary spermatocyte has $2n=24$ chromosomes and $2$ chromatids per chromosome, for a total of $2 \\times 24=48$ chromatids.\n\nMeiosis I separates homologous chromosomes (reductional division) but does not separate sister chromatids. Thus, at the completion of meiosis I, each secondary spermatocyte is haploid in terms of chromosome number, containing $n=12$ chromosomes, with each chromosome still consisting of two sister chromatids. Therefore, each secondary spermatocyte has $12$ chromosomes and $2 \\times 12=24$ chromatids.\n\nHence, the correct choice is $12$ chromosomes and $24$ chromatids, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1708251"}, {"introduction": "While the meiotic process is remarkably precise, errors can occur, leading to significant genetic consequences. One such error is nondisjunction, the failure of chromosomes or chromatids to separate properly. This final practice explores the specific outcome of a nondisjunction event during meiosis II, allowing you to trace the consequences of a molecular mistake to the final chromosomal makeup of the gametes and link the mechanisms of meiosis to the origins of aneuploid conditions [@problem_id:1489538].", "problem": "In human females, oogenesis is the process of producing a mature ovum. This process begins in a diploid primary oocyte with a chromosomal constitution of (46,XX). Consider a specific oocyte that undergoes a normal Meiosis I, resulting in a secondary oocyte and a first polar body. Subsequently, during Meiosis II, the secondary oocyte experiences a single error: a nondisjunction event where the sister chromatids of the X chromosome fail to separate during anaphase II.

The first polar body likewise contains $n=23$ with one $X$ (sister chromatids).\n\nMeiosis II normally separates sister chromatids. Here, the specified single error is a nondisjunction of the sister chromatids of the $X$ chromosome during anaphase II in the secondary oocyte. All autosomal chromatids segregate normally. Therefore, during Meiosis II:\n- For the $22$ autosomes: each product receives exactly one chromatid of each autosome, giving $22$ autosomes in both the ovum and the second polar body.\n- For the $X$ chromosome: both sister chromatids go to the same pole (nondisjunction), so one product receives $XX$ (two chromatids that become two separate $X$ chromosomes in the products), and the other product receives no $X$ (denoted $O$).\n\nHence, the two products of Meiosis II (the mature ovum and the second polar body) must be one of each:\n$$22 + XX \\Rightarrow (24,XX), \\quad 22 + O \\Rightarrow (22,O).$$\nEither the ovum can be $(24,XX)$ with the second polar body $(22,O)$, or the ovum can be $(22,O)$ with the second polar body $(24,XX)$.
