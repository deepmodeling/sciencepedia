These primary oocytes enter meiosis but are arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division (Prophase I) until puberty. Assuming a typical human karyotype, what is the total number of chromatids present in a single human primary oocyte while it is arrested in Prophase I?\n\nA. 23\n\nB. 46\n\nC. 92\n\nD. 184", "solution": "A primary oocyte is a diploid germ cell that has entered meiosis I and is arrested in Prophase I. Before entering meiosis, DNA replication occurs during the premeiotic S phase. The key principles are:\n- In humans, the diploid chromosome number is $2n=46$.\n- After DNA replication, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\n- The number of chromosomes does not change with replication, but the number of chromatids doubles.\n\nTherefore, in a primary oocyte arrested in Prophase I, the chromosome count remains $46$, and each chromosome has $2$ sister chromatids. The total number of chromatids is:\n$$\n\\text{chromatids} = 2 \\times \\text{chromosomes} = 2 \\times 46 = 92.\n$$\nHence, the correct option is the one corresponding to $92$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1501000"}, {"introduction": "Life cycles are remarkably diverse, and many organisms have evolved strategies that differ from the familiar animal model. This practice explores the fascinating phenomenon of heterokaryosis in fungi, where genetically distinct nuclei coexist and cooperate within a shared cytoplasm. By analyzing a classic complementation test, you will learn how organisms can achieve a functional, prototrophic state without nuclear fusion, showcasing the direct link between gene expression and phenotype. [@problem_id:1500993]", "problem": "In a genetics laboratory, a researcher is working with two mutant strains of a haploid filamentous fungus, commonly used as a model organism. Strain X is an auxotroph that cannot synthesize the amino acid arginine and thus has the genotype `arg− pro+`. Strain Y is another auxotroph that cannot synthesize the amino acid proline and has the genotype `arg+ pro−`. The corresponding wild-type fungus (`arg+ pro+`) is prototrophic, meaning it can synthesize all its required amino acids and grow on a minimal medium (MM) that contains only a basic carbon source, inorganic salts, and essential vitamins.\n\nThe researcher allows the filamentous hyphae of Strain X and Strain Y to undergo plasmogamy (cytoplasmic fusion), which results in the formation of a heterokaryon. A heterokaryon is a single mycelium containing a mixed population of genetically distinct, haploid nuclei within a common, shared cytoplasm. When a fragment of this heterokaryotic mycelium is transferred to a new petri dish containing only minimal medium, robust growth is observed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate genetic explanation for why the heterokaryon can grow on minimal medium?\n\nA. The `arg+` allele from Strain Y and the `pro+` allele from Strain X act as dominant alleles over their mutant counterparts, allowing the resulting fused diploid nucleus to function correctly.\n\nB. The physical DNA of the two nuclear types undergoes a high frequency of somatic recombination, creating a large number of recombinant `arg+ pro+` nuclei that support the growth of the mycelium.\n\nC. The nucleus from Strain X directs the synthesis of proline, and the nucleus from Strain Y directs the synthesis of arginine. These amino acids are then exchanged between the separate nuclei, enabling them to function.\n\nD. In the common cytoplasm, the functional `pro+` gene from the Strain X nuclei is transcribed and translated to produce proline-synthesis enzymes, while the functional `arg+` gene from the Strain Y nuclei is transcribed and translated to produce arginine-synthesis enzymes. The sharing of these functional enzymes allows the entire mycelium to become prototrophic.\n\nE. The presence of both mutant alleles, `arg−` and `pro−`, in the same cytoplasm triggers a cellular stress response that activates a universal repair mechanism, correcting the mutations in both types of nuclei.", "solution": "We identify the genetic background: Strain X is arg− pro+ (cannot synthesize arginine but can synthesize proline), and Strain Y is arg+ pro− (cannot synthesize proline but can synthesize arginine). Each strain is haploid and auxotrophic for one amino acid. The wild-type arg+ pro+ is prototrophic and grows on minimal medium.\n\nThe experimental manipulation is plasmogamy between Strain X and Strain Y to form a heterokaryon. By definition, a heterokaryon contains genetically distinct haploid nuclei coexisting in a shared cytoplasm without karyogamy; thus, no fused diploid nucleus is formed. Transcription occurs in each nucleus; mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm and translated by ribosomes located in the common cytoplasm. The resulting proteins and metabolites diffuse throughout the cytoplasm of the mycelium.\n\nKey genetic principle: Heterokaryotic complementation. When different nuclei in a shared cytoplasm each carry a functional allele for different pathways, their gene products (enzymes) can complement one another. In this case, nuclei from Strain X encode functional proline biosynthesis enzymes (pro+) and nuclei from Strain Y encode functional arginine biosynthesis enzymes (arg+). These enzymes are synthesized and function in the common cytoplasm, producing both required amino acids for the entire mycelium. Therefore, the heterokaryon becomes effectively prototrophic and grows on minimal medium.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because heterokaryons do not require or imply nuclear fusion to a diploid state; dominance in a single diploid nucleus is not the mechanism.\n- Option B is incorrect because high-frequency somatic recombination creating numerous arg+ pro+ nuclei is not necessary; growth occurs immediately via complementation of gene products. While rare recombination can occur, it is not the primary or required explanation.\n- Option C is misleading because it frames the process as nuclei exchanging amino acids between themselves, rather than expression in separate nuclei followed by diffusion of gene products and metabolites in a shared cytoplasm. The standard and most accurate explanation emphasizes enzyme complementation in the common cytoplasm.\n- Option D correctly states that in the common cytoplasm, functional genes in their respective nuclei are transcribed and translated to produce the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes, and the sharing of these enzymes in the cytoplasm complements the auxotrophies, yielding prototrophy.\n- Option E is incorrect; there is no universal stress-triggered repair that corrects both mutations upon coexistence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is enzyme complementation in the shared cytoplasm as described in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1500993"}, {"introduction": "Plant life cycles, characterized by an alternation of generations, provide a rich context for exploring the fate of genetic mutations. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario involving a somatic mutation in a fern, a model for understanding the interplay between development and inheritance. To solve it, you must trace the mutation's path from a single meristem through the sporophyte generation to the resulting spores, integrating concepts of Mendelian segregation with plant biology.

This rhizome has a total of $M$ distinct and functionally equivalent apical meristems, with each meristem destined to produce exactly one frond.

This exposure is precise enough to induce a somatic mutation in all the cells of exactly one of these $M$ meristems.
