By convention, $C$ denotes the DNA mass of a haploid genome, so a diploid G1 cell has $2n$ chromosomes (one chromatid per chromosome) and DNA content $2C$.\n\nA germline cell that enters meiosis first passes through interphase, including S-phase, before meiosis I. During S-phase, DNA replication doubles the DNA content without changing the chromosome number, because sister chromatids are joined at a single centromere and are counted as one chromosome until they separate. Therefore, after S-phase and entering prophase I and metaphase I:\n- DNA content: $2C \\to 4C$ due to replication.\n- Chromosome number: remains $2n$ because homologous chromosomes are still paired as bivalents, and sister chromatids have not separated.\n\nAt metaphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes (each consisting of two sister chromatids) are aligned as bivalents; the reduction in chromosome number occurs at anaphase I when homologs separate.

This set of chromosomes consists of homologous pairs, with one chromosome of each pair inherited from the paternal parent and the other from the maternal parent. During meiosis I, these homologous chromosomes segregate to form secondary gametocytes. Assuming that no crossing over occurs and that the orientation of each homologous pair at the metaphase I plate is random and independent of all other pairs, what is the probability that a single secondary gametocyte, chosen at random after the completion of meiosis I, will contain a set of chromosomes that are exclusively of paternal origin?\n\nExpress your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a daughter cell after meiosis I contains only chromosomes from the paternal parent.\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of homologous chromosome pairs in the organism. The diploid number of chromosomes is given as $2n = 8$. This means the haploid number is $n = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the organism has 4 pairs of homologous chromosomes. In each pair, one chromosome is of paternal origin and one is of maternal origin.\n\nDuring anaphase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes of each pair separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. The orientation of each pair at the metaphase plate is random. For any single homologous pair, there is an equal chance that the paternal chromosome will move to one pole and the maternal chromosome to the other.\n\nLet's consider one specific daughter cell that will be formed. For the first homologous pair, the probability that this cell receives the paternal chromosome is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability it receives the maternal chromosome is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the orientation of each homologous pair is independent of the others. This is the principle of independent assortment. To find the probability that the daughter cell receives the paternal chromosome from *all* pairs, we must multiply the individual probabilities for each pair.\n\nThere are $n=4$ homologous pairs. The probability of receiving the paternal chromosome from a single pair is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Since the events are independent, the probability of receiving the paternal chromosome from all 4 pairs is:\n\n$$P(\\text{all paternal}) = P(\\text{paternal from pair 1}) \\times P(\\text{paternal from pair 2}) \\times P(\\text{paternal from pair 3}) \\times P(\\text{paternal from pair 4})$$\n\n$$P(\\text{all paternal}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4$$\n\nCalculating this value gives:\n\n$$P(\\text{all paternal}) = \\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nThus, the probability that a single secondary gametocyte will contain only chromosomes of paternal origin is $\\frac{1}{16}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$$", "id": "1522290"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the shuffling of whole chromosomes, Meiosis I generates further novelty through crossing over, the physical exchange of segments between non-sister chromatids of a homologous pair.

One homologous chromosome consists of two chromatids both carrying the $A$ allele, and the other homologous chromosome consists of two chromatids both carrying the $a$ allele.\n\nB. Each of the two homologous chromosomes that form the bivalent is composed of one chromatid carrying the $A$ allele and one chromatid carrying the $a$ allele.\n\nC. All four chromatids of the bivalent are genetically identical, each carrying a mix of parental genetic information that cannot be simplified to a single allele.\n\nD. Two chromatids carry the $A$ allele, and two chromatids carry the $a$ allele, but these are randomly distributed such that one homologous chromosome could have two $A$ alleles and the other could have two $a$ alleles.\n\nE.

By definition of crossing over, the exchange swaps chromatid segments distal to the crossover point. Because the locus lies distal to the crossover point, the locus is included in the exchanged segment.\n\nChoose the participating chromatids to be $A_{1}$ and $a_{1}$. After the crossover:\n- $A_{1}$ acquires the distal segment from $a_{1}$, so at the locus $A_{1}$ now carries allele $a$.\n- $a_{1}$ acquires the distal segment from $A_{1}$, so at the locus $a_{1}$ now carries allele $A$.\n- The non-participating chromatids $A_{2}$ and $a_{2}$ retain their original alleles $A$ and $a$, respectively.\n\nGrouping by homolog (centromere identity):\n- On the homolog with centromere $C_{A}$, the two sister chromatids are $A_{1}$ (now carrying $a$ at the locus) and $A_{2}$ (carrying $A$), so one chromatid carries $A$ and one carries $a$.\n- On the homolog with centromere $C_{a}$, the two sister chromatids are $a_{1}$ (now carrying $A$ at the locus) and $a_{2}$ (carrying $a$), so one chromatid carries $A$ and one carries $a$.\n\nTherefore, as the bivalent aligns at the metaphase plate in metaphase I, each homologous chromosome is composed of one chromatid carrying the $A$ allele and one chromatid carrying the $a$ allele.
