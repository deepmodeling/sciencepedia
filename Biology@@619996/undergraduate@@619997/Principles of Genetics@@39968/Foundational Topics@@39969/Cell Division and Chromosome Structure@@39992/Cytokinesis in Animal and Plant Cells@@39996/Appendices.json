This exercise presents a classic scenario where a hypothetical drug induces a telling phenotype in cultured animal cells. By analyzing the resulting cellular structure—a large cell containing two nuclei—you can deduce the precise stage of cell division that was disrupted. This practice hones your ability to link a macroscopic observation to the failure of a specific molecular machine, namely the acto-myosin contractile ring, which is responsible for physically cleaving the cell in two [@problem_id:1480856].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a newly synthesized compound, \"Cytoblock-D,\" for its potential as a therapeutic agent. They add the compound to a culture of rapidly proliferating human fibroblasts, a type of animal cell. After a 24-hour incubation period, they analyze the cells using fluorescence microscopy. They observe that a large fraction of the cell population has become unusually large. These large cells are characterized by the presence of two distinct, well-formed nuclei, each containing decondensed chromatin, all enclosed within a single, continuous cytoplasm.\n\nBased on this specific cellular phenotype, which of the following molecular processes is the most direct and specific target of Cytoblock-D?\n\nA. The polymerization of tubulin to form the mitotic spindle.\n\nB. Centrosome duplication during the G1/S transition.\n\nC. The formation and constriction of the acto-myosin contractile ring.\n\nD. The synthesis of cyclin B, which is required for entry into mitosis.\n\nE. The assembly of the phragmoplast and subsequent formation of a cell plate.", "solution": "The observations specify animal fibroblasts that, after treatment, become unusually large and contain two distinct, well-formed nuclei with decondensed chromatin within a single, continuous cytoplasm. This phenotype is diagnostic of successful karyokinesis (segregation and reformation of two nuclei, with chromatin decondensed as in telophase or G1) coupled with failed cytokinesis (no physical cleavage of the cell into two daughters).\n\nCytokinesis in animal cells requires the formation and constriction of the actin- and myosin II–based contractile ring at the cell equator. If this process is directly inhibited, the cell proceeds through mitosis, segregates chromosomes, reassembles nuclear envelopes to yield two nuclei, and decondenses chromatin, but fails to complete cleavage furrow ingression and abscission, yielding a single, enlarged, binucleated cell. Therefore, the most direct and specific target consistent with the observed phenotype is inhibition of the formation and constriction of the acto-myosin contractile ring.\n\nRuling out alternatives:\n- Inhibition of tubulin polymerization and mitotic spindle formation (choice A) would block chromosome alignment and segregation, typically causing a prometaphase or metaphase arrest with condensed chromosomes, not two decondensed nuclei in one cytoplasm.\n- Inhibition of centrosome duplication (choice B) disrupts spindle bipolarity, leading to mitotic defects or arrest, not a consistent binucleated state with decondensed chromatin.\n- Inhibition of cyclin B synthesis (choice D) prevents entry into mitosis; cells would not undergo nuclear division and would not become binucleated.\n- Assembly of the phragmoplast and cell plate (choice E) is a plant-specific cytokinetic mechanism and is not applicable to animal fibroblasts.\n\nThus, the specific molecular process directly targeted by the compound, given the phenotype, is the formation and constriction of the acto-myosin contractile ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1480856"}, {"introduction": "In stark contrast to the inward \"pinching\" of an animal cell, a plant cell divides by constructing a new wall, the cell plate, from the center outwards. This process is like an assembly line, powered by motor proteins that transport vesicles filled with building materials. This problem asks you to build a simple mathematical model connecting the performance of individual motor proteins to the overall rate of cell plate expansion. Tackling this quantitative challenge will help you appreciate how the microscopic dynamics of molecular machines dictate the speed and efficiency of macroscopic cellular events [@problem_id:1480841].", "problem": "In plant cell cytokinesis, a structure called the cell plate forms at the cell's equator and grows centrifugally. This growth is driven by the transport and fusion of vesicles originating from the Golgi apparatus. The vesicles are transported along microtubule tracks by motor proteins.\n\nConsider a hypothetical plant cell where this transport is mediated by two distinct subtypes of kinesin motor proteins, Kinesin-$\\alpha$ and Kinesin-$\\beta$, which operate in parallel. In a wild-type (WT) plant cell, 75% of the total vesicle population is transported by Kinesin-$\\alpha$ motors, which travel at a velocity $v_{\\alpha}$. The remaining 25% of the vesicles are transported by Kinesin-$\\beta$ motors, which travel at a velocity $v_{\\beta}$. In these WT cells, the velocity of the faster motor is twice that of the slower one, such that $v_{\\alpha} = 2v_{\\beta}$.\n\nA researcher introduces a specific genetic mutation that impairs the motor domain of Kinesin-$\\alpha$, reducing its transport velocity by 80%. This mutation does not affect the velocity of Kinesin-$\\beta$ motors, nor does it alter the proportion of vesicles carried by each motor subtype.\n\nAssume that the rate of the cell plate's radial expansion, denoted by $E$, is directly proportional to the average transport velocity of the entire population of vesicles arriving at the growing edge of the plate. Based on this model, calculate the ratio of the cell plate expansion rate in the mutant cell ($E_{\\text{mutant}}$) to the expansion rate in the wild-type cell ($E_{\\text{WT}}$).\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the fractions of vesicles transported by each motor subtype be $p_{\\alpha}=\\frac{3}{4}$ and $p_{\\beta}=\\frac{1}{4}$. Let the Kinesin-$\\beta$ velocity be $v_{\\beta}=v$ and, using the given relation for wild type, $v_{\\alpha}=2v$.\n\nBy the assumption that the expansion rate $E$ is directly proportional to the average velocity of the vesicle population, we write for the wild type:\n$$\nv_{\\text{avg,WT}}=p_{\\alpha}v_{\\alpha}+p_{\\beta}v_{\\beta}=\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot 2v+\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot v=\\frac{7}{4}v,\n$$\nand hence $E_{\\text{WT}}\\propto \\frac{7}{4}v$.\n\nThe mutation reduces Kinesin-$\\alpha$ velocity by 80 percent, i.e., to a factor of $\\frac{1}{5}$ of its original value. Therefore,\n$$\nv_{\\alpha,\\text{mut}}=\\frac{1}{5}v_{\\alpha}=\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 2v=\\frac{2}{5}v,\n$$\nwhile $v_{\\beta,\\text{mut}}=v_{\\beta}=v$, and the fractions $p_{\\alpha},p_{\\beta}$ are unchanged.

This problem explores the fascinating genetic concept of a \"maternal effect,\" where the phenotype of an embryo is determined by the mother's genotype, not its own. You will investigate why a homozygous recessive embryo, which is genetically unable to perform cytokinesis, can nonetheless survive through several rounds of division. This exercise seamlessly integrates principles of genetics, developmental biology, and cell biology, revealing how stored maternal products ensure the successful launch of a new life [@problem_id:1480877].", "problem": "In the fictional diploid aquatic invertebrate, *Aquaformis simplex*, the gene *dividin-1* (`dvd-1`) is essential for successful cell division. The protein product of the wild-type allele, `D`, is a crucial component of the contractile ring that facilitates cytokinesis. A rare, recessive allele, `d`, produces a non-functional protein. Consequently, the homozygous recessive genotype, `dd`, is lethal.\n\nGeneticists perform an experiment where they intercross two heterozygous individuals (`Dd`). According to Mendelian genetics, they expect a 1:2:1 ratio of `DD`:`Dd`:`dd` genotypes in the resulting zygotes. Observation of the F1 generation embryos reveals that while all zygotes begin to divide, approximately 25% of the embryos uniformly cease development and die after reaching the 64-cell stage. Microscopic analysis of these arrested embryos shows large, multinucleated cells, confirming a failure in cytokinesis.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for why the lethal phenotype of the `dd` genotype is delayed, allowing embryos to survive to the 64-cell stage before dying?\n\nA. The oocyte from the heterozygous (`Dd`) mother contains a pre-loaded supply of functional `dvd-1` protein or mRNA, which is sufficient to support the first several rounds of cell division.\n\nB. The `dvd-1` gene is not required for cytokinesis during the first six cell divisions (up to the 64-cell stage); other redundant genes handle this process in early development.\n\nC. The sperm from the heterozygous (`Dd`) father contributes a small but sufficient amount of functional `dvd-1` protein during fertilization, which becomes depleted by the 64-cell stage.\n\nD. The `dd` genotype results in a partially functional protein that allows for a limited number of cell divisions before it ultimately fails, a phenomenon known as incomplete penetrance.\n\nE. The developing embryos are able to absorb essential molecules from their aquatic environment that temporarily bypass the need for the `dvd-1` protein.", "solution": "We denote the wild-type functional allele as `D` and the null allele as `d`. A cross $Dd \\times Dd$ produces zygotic genotypes in the Mendelian ratio $DD:Dd:dd = 1:2:1$, so the expected fraction of `dd` zygotes is $\\frac{1}{4}$. The observation that approximately $\\frac{1}{4}$ of embryos die uniformly after the same number of cleavage cycles implicates the `dd` genotype as the lethal class.\n\nEarly embryonic cleavages proceed through repeated cycles of mitosis and cytokinesis. The protein product of the `D` allele, required for the contractile ring, is necessary for cytokinesis at every division. The key developmental principle is maternal provisioning: oocytes from a mother that carries at least one functional allele can deposit functional mRNA and/or protein into the egg cytoplasm prior to fertilization. After fertilization, early cleavages can be driven by these maternally supplied products until they are depleted or until zygotic transcription becomes necessary.\n\nIn this cross, all embryos, including those with the `dd` genotype, develop from oocytes produced by a `Dd` mother. Therefore, `dd` embryos initially inherit a maternal supply of functional `D` protein and/or `dvd-1` mRNA from the oocyte cytoplasm. This supply can support a finite number of cytokinetic events. Once the maternally deposited pool is exhausted, `dd` embryos cannot synthesize new functional protein because their zygotic genotype lacks a functional `D` allele; cytokinesis then fails, producing multinucleated cells and developmental arrest. The uniform arrest around the $64$-cell stage is consistent with depletion after approximately $n$ cleavages where $2^{n}=64$, i.e., $n=6$ divisions, matching the reported stage.\n\nEvaluation of alternatives:\n- Option A matches the maternal provisioning mechanism described above and explains both the $\\frac{1}{4}$ lethality and the delayed arrest at a stereotyped stage.\n- Option B is inconsistent with the role of the contractile ring in all cytokinetic events and with the observed failure of cytokinesis; no evidence supports early redundancy that is lost precisely at the $64$-cell stage.\n- Option C is implausible because sperm contribute negligible cytoplasm and therefore negligible protein; moreover, `dd` embryos receive a `d` allele from the father, so paternal gametes in these cases would not carry functional `D` product.\n- Option D contradicts the definition of the `d` allele as producing a non-functional protein and misuses the term incomplete penetrance; the phenotype is fully penetrant but delayed due to maternal supply.\n- Option E is biologically implausible because a specific contractile ring component cannot be substituted by environmental uptake.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that maternally deposited functional `dvd-1` product from the heterozygous mother supports early divisions until it is depleted, after which `dd` embryos fail cytokinesis and die.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1480877"}]}
