This practice problem focuses on a fundamental technique: creating a genetically uniform generation of offspring. By determining the specific parental cross required to produce an entire generation of heterozygotes, you will solidify your understanding of terms like \"true-breeding\" (homozygous) and lay the groundwork for analyzing how traits are passed down [@problem_id:1497840].", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying the genetics of a fictional deep-sea jellyfish, *Chrysaora noctiluca*. They observe that the jellyfish's bell can have one of two textures: smooth or gelatinous. This trait is determined by a single gene that follows simple Mendelian inheritance patterns. The allele for a smooth bell ($S$) is completely dominant over the allele for a gelatinous bell ($s$).\n\nThe research team wants to conduct a specific cross to produce a new generation of jellyfish (the F1 generation) that are all genetically uniform for this bell texture gene. Furthermore, if any two individuals from this F1 generation are crossed with each other, they must be capable of producing offspring with both smooth and gelatinous bells.\n\nWhich of the following parental crosses is required to reliably produce an F1 generation that meets these specific criteria?\n\nA. A cross between a jellyfish with a smooth bell and a jellyfish with a gelatinous bell.\n\nB. A cross between two jellyfish, both of which have a smooth bell but had one parent with a gelatinous bell.\n\nC. A cross between a true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish and a true-breeding gelatinous-belled jellyfish.\n\nD. A cross between two true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the specific parental cross that will produce an F1 generation where all individuals are genetically identical for the bell-texture gene, and which, when interbred, can produce offspring of both phenotypes. Let's analyze the genetics of the system first.\n\nThe gene for bell texture has two alleles:\n- $S$: The dominant allele for a smooth bell.\n- $s$: The recessive allele for a gelatinous bell.\n\nThe possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n- $SS$: Homozygous dominant, resulting in a smooth bell.\n- $Ss$: Heterozygous, also resulting in a smooth bell due to the dominance of the $S$ allele.\n- $ss$: Homozygous recessive, resulting in a gelatinous bell.\n\nThe term \"true-breeding\" means an organism is homozygous for a particular trait. Therefore:\n- A true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish has the genotype $SS$.\n- A true-breeding gelatinous-belled jellyfish has the genotype $ss$.\n\nThe problem has two conditions for the F1 generation:\n1. All individuals must be genetically uniform (have the same genotype for this gene).\n2. When interbred, they must be able to produce offspring with both smooth ($S\\_$) and gelatinous ($ss$) phenotypes.\n\nFor the second condition to be met, the F1 individuals must be able to produce gametes carrying the $s$ allele. If an F1 individual were $SS$, it could only produce $S$ gametes and could never have $ss$ offspring. Therefore, the F1 individuals must carry the $s$ allele. They must also carry the $S$ allele to potentially produce smooth-belled offspring. The only genotype that satisfies this is the heterozygous genotype, $Ss$. A cross between two heterozygous individuals ($Ss \\times Ss$) produces offspring with genotypes $SS$, $Ss$, and $ss$ in a 1:2:1 ratio, which corresponds to smooth and gelatinous phenotypes.\n\nThus, the goal is to find a parental cross that guarantees 100% of the offspring will have the heterozygous genotype ($Ss$). Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **A cross between a jellyfish with a smooth bell and a jellyfish with a gelatinous bell.**\nThe smooth-belled parent could be $SS$ or $Ss$. The gelatinous-belled parent must be $ss$.\n- If the cross is $SS \\times ss$, all offspring will be $Ss$. This meets the condition.\n- If the cross is $Ss \\times ss$, the offspring will be 50% $Ss$ and 50% $ss$. This does not produce a genetically uniform F1 generation.\nSince this cross does not *guarantee* the desired outcome, option A is incorrect.\n\nB. **A cross between two jellyfish, both of which have a smooth bell but had one parent with a gelatinous bell.**\nA jellyfish with a smooth bell that had a parent with a gelatinous bell ($ss$) must have inherited an $s$ allele from that parent. To have a smooth bell, it must also have an $S$ allele. Therefore, both parents in this cross are heterozygous ($Ss$).\n- The cross is $Ss \\times Ss$.\n- The offspring genotypes are 25% $SS$, 50% $Ss$, and 25% $ss$. This F1 generation is not genetically uniform. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. **A cross between a true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish and a true-breeding gelatinous-belled jellyfish.**\nThis explicitly defines the genotypes of the parents.\n- The true-breeding smooth parent is $SS$.\n- The true-breeding gelatinous parent is $ss$.\n- The cross is $SS \\times ss$.\nThe $SS$ parent can only produce gametes containing the $S$ allele. The $ss$ parent can only produce gametes containing the $s$ allele. Upon fertilization, all offspring will have the genotype $Ss$. This F1 generation is 100% heterozygous and thus genetically uniform. As established, these $Ss$ individuals can produce offspring with both phenotypes when interbred. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nD. **A cross between two true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish.**\nThis means crossing two homozygous dominant individuals.\n- The cross is $SS \\times SS$.\n- All offspring will have the genotype $SS$. While this F1 generation is genetically uniform, these individuals can only produce gametes with the $S$ allele. If interbred ($SS \\times SS$), they can only produce $SS$ offspring. They cannot produce offspring with the gelatinous ($ss$) phenotype. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only the cross described in option C guarantees an F1 generation that meets both specified criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1497840"}, {"introduction": "Once a heterozygous individual is produced, its true genetic potential lies in the diversity of gametes it can create. This exercise challenges you to quantify that potential by calculating the number of unique gametes formed by an organism heterozygous for multiple, independently assorting genes. Mastering this helps in appreciating the source of genetic variation and is a critical step towards predicting the outcomes of complex crosses [@problem_id:1497837].", "problem": "A plant geneticist is studying a newly cultivated variety of pea plant.

During the formation of gametes (pollen and ovules), these alleles are segregated. Calculate the total number of unique gamete genotypes that this single plant can produce with respect to these four genes.", "solution": "The plant has genotype $RrYyPpTt$, meaning it is heterozygous at four loci that assort independently because each gene is on a different chromosome. By Mendel's law of segregation, each gamete receives one allele from each gene pair. Because each locus is heterozygous, there are exactly $2$ allele options per locus for any given gamete.\n\nBy the multiplication principle for independent choices, if there are $2$ independent choices at each of $4$ loci, the total number of distinct gamete genotypes is\n$$\nN=\\prod_{i=1}^{4} 2=2^{4}.\n$$\nEvaluating this power gives\n$$\n2^{4}=16.\n$$\nTherefore, the plant can produce $16$ unique gamete genotypes with respect to these four genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1497837"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates the previous concepts to make quantitative predictions, a core task in genetics.

The cross produces a large F1 generation consisting of 2400 individual plants.\n\nAs part of a statistical analysis to verify Mendelian inheritance patterns, the breeder needs to calculate the expected number of offspring for a specific genotype. What is the expected number of F1 generation plants that are heterozygous for the flower color gene but homozygous recessive for the plant height gene?", "solution": "Each parent is $CcTt$, and the two genes assort independently (Mendelâ€™s law of independent assortment).
