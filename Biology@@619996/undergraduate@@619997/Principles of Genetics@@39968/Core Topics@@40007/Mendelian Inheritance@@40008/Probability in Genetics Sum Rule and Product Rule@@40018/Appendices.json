The condition is caused by a recessive allele, which we will denote as $p$. The dominant allele, $P$, leads to a normal phenotype. Therefore, individuals with the genotype $pp$ have PKU, while individuals with genotypes $PP$ or $Pp$ are phenotypically normal.\n\nA couple consists of two phenotypically normal individuals who are both known to be heterozygous carriers ($Pp$) for the PKU allele. They have a child who is also phenotypically normal.

For leaf shape, the allele for broad leaves, $L$, is dominant over the allele for narrow leaves, $l$.\n\nA parent plant that is heterozygous for both genes, having the genotype $SsLl$, is chosen for a self-pollination experiment.
