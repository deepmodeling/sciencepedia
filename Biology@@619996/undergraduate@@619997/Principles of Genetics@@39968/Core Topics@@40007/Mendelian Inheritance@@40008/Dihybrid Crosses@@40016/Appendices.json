For petal color, the allele for red petals (R) is completely dominant to the allele for white petals (r). For pollen color, the allele for yellow pollen (Y) is completely dominant to the allele for green pollen (y). The genes for petal color and pollen color are located on different chromosomes and therefore assort independently.\n\nA plant with the genotype $RRYy$ is crossed with a plant that has the genotype $rrYy$.

Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The genes are on different chromosomes, so the segregation at the $R/r$ locus is independent of the segregation at the $Y/y$ locus. Therefore, the probability of an offspring with genotype $RrYy$ is the product of the probabilities for each locus:\n$$\nP(RrYy)=P(Rr)\\cdot P(Yy).\n$$\nFor the $R/r$ locus: the cross is $RR \\times rr$. The $RR$ parent contributes $R$ in every gamete, and the $rr$ parent contributes $r$ in every gamete, so every offspring is $Rr$.
