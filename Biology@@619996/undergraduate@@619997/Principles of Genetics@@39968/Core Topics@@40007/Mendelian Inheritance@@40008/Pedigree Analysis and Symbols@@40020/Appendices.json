You will apply the principles of autosomal recessive inheritance to a multi-generational family tree, deducing which individuals *must* be carriers based on the relationships and phenotypes presented. Mastering this deductive process is a cornerstone of genetic risk assessment [@problem_id:1507959].", "problem": "A genetic counselor is analyzing a family's history for a rare metabolic disorder known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The analysis centers on a three-generation family.\n\nThe first generation consists of two founding families. The first family is headed by Charles and Anna. The second family is headed by David and Beth. A key piece of information is that Anna and Beth are sisters. For the purpose of this analysis, assume any individual marrying into this extended family is homozygous for the dominant, non-disease allele, given the rarity of the disorder.\n\nIn the second generation, Anna and Charles have a son, Edward, and a daughter, Helen. Beth and David have one child, a daughter named Fiona. A consanguineous marriage occurs in this generation: Edward and Fiona, who are first cousins, marry each other. Separately, Helen marries an unrelated man named Ian.\n\nIn the third generation, the pedigree's proband is identified. The proband is Grace, the first and only child of Edward and Fiona, who is diagnosed with the metabolic disorder. Meanwhile, Helen and Ian have had two children: a set of phenotypically normal monozygotic twin boys.\n\nBased on this family history, determine the total number of individuals within this three-generation pedigree who are obligate heterozygous carriers of the allele for the metabolic disorder. An obligate carrier is an individual who, based on the pedigree structure, must carry the recessive allele. The pedigree in question consists of all named individuals: Charles, Anna, David, Beth, Edward, Helen, Ian, Fiona, Grace, and the two twin boys.", "solution": "Let's denote the dominant allele for the normal phenotype as $A$ and the recessive allele for the metabolic disorder as $a$. Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, an individual must have the genotype $aa$ to be affected. Heterozygous individuals ($Aa$) are carriers but are phenotypically normal. Homozygous dominant individuals ($AA$) are also phenotypically normal.\n\nThe solution requires systematically determining the genotype of each individual based on the provided family history.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the proband, Grace.\nGrace is in the third generation and is affected by the disorder. She is the proband. Her genotype must therefore be $aa$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the genotypes of Grace's parents, Edward and Fiona.\nGrace ($aa$) inherited one $a$ allele from her father, Edward, and one $a$ allele from her mother, Fiona. Since Edward and Fiona are phenotypically normal (unaffected), they cannot be $aa$. Therefore, both Edward and Fiona must be heterozygous carriers. Their genotype is $Aa$. This identifies our first two obligate carriers.\n- Edward: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 1)\n- Fiona: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 2)\n\nStep 3: Determine the genotypes of Edward's parents, Charles and Anna.\nEdward ($Aa$) is the son of Charles and Anna. He must have inherited his $a$ allele from one of them. The problem states that Charles married into the family and should be assumed to be homozygous dominant due to the rarity of the disorder. So, Charles's genotype is $AA$. For Edward to be $Aa$, he must have inherited the $a$ allele from his mother, Anna. Therefore, Anna must be a heterozygous carrier.\n- Charles: $AA$\n- Anna: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 3)\n\nStep 4: Determine the genotypes of Fiona's parents, David and Beth.\nFiona ($Aa$) is the daughter of David and Beth. She must have inherited her $a$ allele from one of them. David married into the family and is assumed to be homozygous dominant ($AA$). Therefore, Fiona must have inherited the $a$ allele from her mother, Beth. Beth and her sister, Anna, are thus both carriers, which is consistent with them inheriting the allele from one of their parents (in generation zero).\n- David: $AA$\n- Beth: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 4)\n\nStep 5: Analyze the remaining individuals in the pedigree.\n- Helen is the daughter of Charles ($AA$) and Anna ($Aa$). The cross is $AA \\times Aa$. Helen has a $1/2$ probability of being $AA$ and a $1/2$ probability of being $Aa$. Since her genotype is not certain, she is a possible carrier, but not an *obligate* carrier.\n- Ian is Helen's husband who married into the family. His genotype is assumed to be $AA$.\n- The monozygotic twin boys are the children of Helen and Ian. Since they are monozygotic, they have the same genotype. Their father Ian is $AA$. Their mother Helen is either $AA$ or $Aa$.\n    - If Helen is $AA$, the twins will be $AA$.\n    - If Helen is $Aa$, the twins have a $1/2$ chance of being $AA$ and a $1/2$ chance of being $Aa$.\n    In either case, it is not certain that they carry the $a$ allele. They are not obligate carriers.\n- Grace has genotype $aa$. She is affected, not a heterozygous carrier.\n\nStep 6: Tally the obligate carriers.\nBased on the deductions above, the individuals who are obligate heterozygous carriers ($Aa$) are:\n1.  Edward (Generation II)\n2.  Fiona (Generation II)\n3.  Anna (Generation I)\n4.  Beth (Generation I)\n\nThe total count of obligate heterozygous carriers in the described pedigree is 4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1507959"}, {"introduction": "A crucial aspect of scientific reasoning is falsification—the ability to prove a hypothesis wrong.

The information, transcribed from old medical records, is provided below.

However, the provided family history contains a significant inconsistency that invalidates this hypothesis.

For X-linked recessive inheritance:\n- Males are hemizygous: an affected male has genotype $X^{a}Y$ and receives his single X chromosome only from his mother.\n- Females require two mutant alleles to be affected: an affected female has genotype $X^{a}X^{a}$; a carrier female has genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$ and is typically unaffected.\n- Fathers transmit $X$ only to daughters and $Y$ only to sons; hence a father’s X chromosome never goes to his sons.\n\nGeneration I: I-2 is an affected female, so $X^{a}X^{a}$. I-1 is an unaffected male, so $X^{A}Y$.\nTheir cross is:\n$$X^{A}Y \\times X^{a}X^{a}.$$\nGametes: I-1 produces $X^{A}$ or $Y$; I-2 produces only $X^{a}$. Therefore:\n- Sons receive $Y$ from I-1 and $X^{a}$ from I-2, yielding $X^{a}Y$ (all affected).\n- Daughters receive $X^{A}$ from I-1 and $X^{a}$ from I-2, yielding $X^{A}X^{a}$ (all carrier, unaffected).\nThus II-1 as an affected male ($X^{a}Y$) and II-2 as an unaffected carrier female ($X^{A}X^{a}$) are both expected and biologically possible. I-2 being an affected female is also possible (though rare), so A, B, and C are consistent.\n\nGeneration II to III: II-1 is affected male $X^{a}Y$. II-3 is an unaffected female confirmed not a carrier, so $X^{A}X^{A}$. Their cross is:\n$$X^{a}Y \\times X^{A}X^{A}.$$\nGametes: II-1 produces $X^{a}$ or $Y$; II-3 produces only $X^{A}$. Therefore:\n- Sons receive $Y$ from II-1 and $X^{A}$ from II-3, yielding $X^{A}Y$ (all unaffected).\n- Daughters receive $X^{a}$ from II-1 and $X^{A}$ from II-3, yielding $X^{A}X^{a}$ (all carriers, unaffected).\nHence an affected male child in Generation III from this mating is biologically impossible under X-linked recessive inheritance. The impossibility lies with III-1 being affected, since a son cannot inherit the father’s $X^{a}$ and must receive a normal $X^{A}$ from the non-carrier mother.\n\nTherefore, the inconsistent individual is III-1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1507920"}, {"introduction": "Real-world genetic analysis often involves uncertainty, especially with limited data.

Father is $X^{A}Y$ if unaffected. Mother must be $X^{A}X^{a}$ (carrier) to have any affected sons.\n- Sons inherit their single X from the mother: from $X^{A}X^{a}$ mother, sons are $\\frac{1}{2}X^{A}Y$ (unaffected) and $\\frac{1}{2}X^{a}Y$ (affected).\n- Daughters inherit $X^{A}$ from the father and either $X^{A}$ or $X^{a}$ from the mother, yielding $\\frac{1}{2}X^{A}X^{A}$ (unaffected) and $\\frac{1}{2}X^{A}X^{a}$ (unaffected carrier).

With complete penetrance, any $D\\_$ individual is affected.\n- Both parents are phenotypically normal, so under AD without invoking new mutation, they must be $dd$. Their children must be $dd$ (all unaffected). An affected child would require a de novo mutation.\n- Based solely on the pedigree without assuming de novo events, AD is not supported.\nConclusion: AD is not consistent on pedigree grounds without invoking de novo mutation.\n\n4) Test X-linked dominant (XLD).\n- With complete penetrance, unaffected parents imply mother $X^{A}X^{A}$ and father $X^{A}Y$.
