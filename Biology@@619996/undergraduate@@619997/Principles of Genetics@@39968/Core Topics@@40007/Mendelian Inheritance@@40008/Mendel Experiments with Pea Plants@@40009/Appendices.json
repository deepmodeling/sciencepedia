Two genes, which are located on different chromosomes, are of particular interest. The first gene, for herbicide resistance, has a dominant allele ($G$) that confers resistance and a recessive allele ($g$) that results in susceptibility. The second gene, for drought tolerance, has a dominant allele ($W$) that confers high tolerance and a recessive allele ($w$) that results in normal tolerance.\n\nTo begin their experiment, the scientists cross a true-breeding plant that is herbicide-resistant and has high drought tolerance with a true-breeding plant that is herbicide-susceptible and has normal drought tolerance. This initial cross produces the F1 generation. Subsequently, one of the F1 plants is allowed to self-pollinate, producing the F2 generation.\n\nAssuming independent assortment of these two genes, what is the probability that a randomly selected F2 offspring will be heterozygous for one gene but homozygous for the other?

The allele for large seeds, *B*, is completely dominant over the allele for small seeds, *b*.\n- The third gene determines maturation time. The allele for early maturation, *C*, is completely dominant over the allele for late maturation, *c*.\n\nTwo parent plants, both heterozygous for all three genes (genotype *AaBbCc*), are crossed, producing a large number of offspring seeds. These seeds are planted, and the resulting plants are allowed to grow. For the next stage of breeding, a geneticist selects *only* those plants that exhibit all three dominant phenotypes: pest resistance, large seeds, and early maturation.\n\nFrom this selected group of phenotypically superior plants, what fraction is expected to have the genotype *AaBbCc*?

The results from the described test cross defy the predictions of independent assortment, pushing you to deduce an alternative genetic mechanism. This exercise powerfully illustrates how deviations from expected Mendelian ratios can reveal more complex phenomena, such as gene linkage, where genes are inherited together because they reside on the same chromosome [@problem_id:1502467].", "problem": "In an experimental study on a newly discovered plant species, *Genetica mirabilis*, a researcher identifies four distinct traits, each controlled by a single gene with a dominant and a recessive allele:\n- Petal Color: Purple (*P*) is dominant to white (*p*).\n- Stem Height: Tall (*H*) is dominant to short (*h*).\n- Seed Texture: Smooth (*S*) is dominant to wrinkled (*s*).\n- Leaf Margin: Serrated (*M*) is dominant to smooth (*m*).\n\nA single plant is found that exhibits the dominant phenotype for all four traits (Purple petals, Tall stem, Smooth seeds, and Serrated leaf margin). To determine its genotype, the researcher performs a test cross, mating this plant with another plant that is homozygous recessive for all four traits (white petals, short stem, wrinkled seeds, and smooth leaf margin).\n\nThe cross produces 200 offspring. The progeny are observed to fall into only two phenotypic classes in approximately equal numbers:\n1.  102 offspring with Purple petals, Tall stem, Smooth seeds, and Serrated leaf margin.\n2.  98 offspring with white petals, short stem, wrinkled seeds, and smooth leaf margin.\n\nNo other combination of these four traits is observed in the progeny. For the purposes of this problem, assume that the genes are completely linked if they are on the same chromosome, meaning no crossing over occurs. The notation `ABCD/abcd` indicates that alleles `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` are on one chromosome and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are on the homologous chromosome.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the genotype of the original parent plant that had all dominant phenotypes?\n\nA.

For $n=4$, this would be $2^{4}=16$ classes, not just two. Therefore any option claiming independent assortment is incompatible with the observation of only two classes.\n\nPrinciple 2 (complete linkage without crossing over): If several loci are completely linked on the same chromosome and there is no crossing over, a heterozygote in coupling phase (e.g., `ABCD/abcd`) produces only two gamete types, $ABCD$ and $abcd$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. A test cross with $abcd/abcd$ then yields only two progeny classes, $ABCD/abcd$ (all dominant phenotypes) and $abcd/abcd$ (all recessive phenotypes), in a $1:1$ ratio.\n\nFrom the data:\n- The progeny comprise only two phenotypic classes, approximately equal in number: all dominant or all recessive.\n- The appearance of fully recessive progeny (white, short, wrinkled, smooth) requires that the dominant-phenotype parent carry recessive alleles at all four loci; hence it must be heterozygous at each locus. Therefore the genotype must be *PpHhSsMm*.\n\nNow evaluate each option using these principles:\n\n- Option A (independent assortment with *PpHhSsMm*): Would produce $2^{4}=16$ phenotypic classes in a test cross, not observed.

Reject.\n\n- Option C (*PPHHSsMm* with independent assortment): Being homozygous dominant at *P* and *H* would prevent any white or short offspring in a test cross, contradicting the observed all-recessive class. Reject.\n\n- Option D (*PpHhSsMm* with complete linkage in repulsion `PHsm/phSM`): With complete linkage and no recombination, the only gametes would be $PHsm$ and $phSM$. In a test cross to $phsm$, the progeny would be $PHsm/phsm$ (Purple, Tall, wrinkled, smooth) and $phSM/phsm$ (white, short, Smooth, Serrated), i.e., two mixed classes, not the observed all-dominant and all-recessive classes.

The test cross to $phsm/phsm$ yields progeny $PHSM/phsm$ (all dominant phenotypes) and $phsm/phsm$ (all recessive phenotypes) in a $1:1$ ratio, exactly matching the observations.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with the data is complete linkage of all four genes in coupling phase with genotype *PpHhSsMm* and arrangement `PHSM/phsm`, which is Option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1502467"}]}
