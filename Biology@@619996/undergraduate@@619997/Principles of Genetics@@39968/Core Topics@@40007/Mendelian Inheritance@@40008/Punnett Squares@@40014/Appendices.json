Toxin Resistance: The dominant allele 'T' confers resistance to a prevalent neurotoxin found in their hydrothermal vent habitat, while the recessive allele 't' results in susceptibility.\n2.  Gill Structure: The dominant allele 'G' leads to the development of highly filamentous gills, which are efficient at oxygen exchange in a low-oxygen environment. The recessive allele 'g' results in simpler, less-branched gills.\n3.  Bioluminescence: The dominant allele 'F' codes for a functional fluorescent protein, causing the crustacean to glow. The recessive allele 'f' does not produce this protein.\n\nAssume these three genes assort independently.

This gene, named *Vita*, plays a crucial role in early embryonic development.\n\nThe dominant allele, $V$, allows for normal development and results in a nematode with a characteristic vibrant blue glow under ultraviolet light. A recessive allele, $v$, has been identified. While heterozygotes ($Vv$) are phenotypically indistinguishable from homozygous dominant ($VV$) individuals, homozygous recessive ($vv$) embryos fail to develop past the gastrulation stage and are therefore non-viable.\n\nA cross is performed between two nematodes that are both heterozygous for the *Vita* gene.

Define events: $S$ = survives to be observed as offspring, $C$ = carrier ($Vv$), and $B$ = exhibits the blue glow. Since both $VV$ and $Vv$ are viable and both exhibit the blue glow, and $vv$ is non-viable and absent, we have $S$ and $B$ equivalent for observed offspring. Thus conditioning on “a surviving offspring that exhibits the blue glow” is equivalent to conditioning on $S$.\n\nThe probability a randomly selected surviving offspring is a carrier is\n$$\nP(C \\mid S)=\\frac{P(C \\cap S)}{P(S)}.\n$$\nAll carriers survive, so $P(C \\cap S)=P(C)=\\frac{1}{2}$.
