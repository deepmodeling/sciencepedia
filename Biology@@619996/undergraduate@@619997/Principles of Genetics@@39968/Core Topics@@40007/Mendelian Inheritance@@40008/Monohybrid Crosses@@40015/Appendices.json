In this particular species, plant height is determined by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele $T$, which codes for a tall phenotype, and a recessive allele $t$, which codes for a dwarf phenotype. The botanist begins with a single parent plant that is known to be heterozygous ($Tt$) for the height gene. This plant is allowed to self-pollinate, and its seeds are collected. After planting all the collected seeds, a total of 1316 offspring plants successfully germinate and grow to maturity. Assuming that this trait follows standard Mendelian inheritance patterns and that all genotypes have equal viability, calculate the expected number of offspring that will be tall.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of tall offspring from a self-pollination of a heterozygous pea plant. We can solve this by first determining the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring and then applying this ratio to the total number of offspring.\n\nStep 1: Identify the parental cross.\nThe parent plant is heterozygous, with genotype $Tt$. It self-pollinates, which means the cross is between two individuals with the same genotype. Therefore, the cross is $Tt \\times Tt$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the gametes produced by the parent.\nA heterozygous individual ($Tt$) produces two types of gametes. According to Mendel's Law of Segregation, these alleles separate during gamete formation. Thus, 50% of the gametes will carry the dominant allele ($T$) and 50% will carry the recessive allele ($t$).\n\nStep 3: Use a Punnett square to find the genotypes of the offspring.\nWe can combine the gametes from the self-pollination in a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the F1 generation.\n\n| | $T$ | $t$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **$T$** | $TT$ | $Tt$ |\n| **$t$** | $Tt$ | $tt$ |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring are $TT$, $Tt$, and $tt$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.\nThe genotypic ratio is the ratio of the different genotypes produced. By counting the squares, we find the ratio is 1 $TT$ : 2 $Tt$ : 1 $tt$.\n\nThe phenotype is the observable trait. The allele for tallness ($T$) is dominant over the allele for dwarfness ($t$).\n-   Offspring with genotype $TT$ will be tall.\n-   Offspring with genotype $Tt$ will be tall (due to dominance).\n-   Offspring with genotype $tt$ will be dwarf.\n\nTherefore, the number of \"tall\" outcomes is the sum of the $TT$ and $Tt$ genotypes (1 + 2 = 3), and the number of \"dwarf\" outcomes is from the $tt$ genotype (1). The expected phenotypic ratio is 3 tall : 1 dwarf.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the expected number of tall offspring.\nThe phenotypic ratio of 3 tall : 1 dwarf means that out of every 4 offspring, we expect 3 to be tall. So, the expected fraction of tall offspring is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe total number of offspring plants is given as 1316. To find the expected number of tall plants, we multiply the total number of offspring by the fraction expected to be tall:\n\nExpected number of tall plants = Total offspring $\\times$ Fraction of tall offspring\nExpected number of tall plants = $1316 \\times \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFirst, divide 1316 by 4:\n$1316 \\div 4 = 329$\n\nNext, multiply this result by 3:\n$329 \\times 3 = 987$\n\nSo, the expected number of tall plants in the offspring generation is 987.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{987}$$", "id": "1504300"}, {"introduction": "While we observe phenotypes, genetics is driven by the underlying genotypes. This next problem challenges you to think like a geneticist by looking past the observable traits to deduce the hidden genetic makeup [@problem_id:1504288].

The resulting offspring, known as the F1 generation, are then allowed to interbreed freely to produce the F2 generation.\n\nAfter the F2 generation hatches, an automated sorting mechanism isolates all individuals that exhibit the dominant phenotype (bright stripes).
