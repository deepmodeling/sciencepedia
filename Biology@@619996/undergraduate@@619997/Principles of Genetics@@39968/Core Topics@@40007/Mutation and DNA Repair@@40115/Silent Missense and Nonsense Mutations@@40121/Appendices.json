The original, functional version of the gene contains a specific triplet on its Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) template strand with the sequence 3'-GGC-5'. The mutation causes this triplet to change to 3'-GAC-5'. This change occurs at a position critical for the enzyme's active site.\n\nYour task is to determine the consequence of this single-base substitution on the protein synthesized by a ribosome.\n\nBelow is a partial table of Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) codons and the amino acids they specify.

This problem challenges you to connect genotype to phenotype by evaluating the likely severity of different mutations. You will rank silent, conservative missense, and nonsense mutations based on their probability of causing a null phenotype—a complete loss of protein function—thereby deepening your understanding of how genetic changes translate into tangible biological consequences [@problem_id:1520503].", "problem": "A researcher is studying a eukaryotic gene, *ENZ4*, which encodes a critical 500-amino-acid enzyme essential for a specific metabolic pathway.

We compare the three point mutations by their typical molecular consequences and their likelihood to abolish enzymatic function.\n\nA nonsense mutation in exon 1 introduces a premature termination codon very early in the coding sequence. Such a premature stop typically triggers nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA if it is located sufficiently upstream of the final exon-exon junction, markedly reducing transcript abundance. Even if any truncated polypeptide were produced, it would lack most domains of a 500-amino-acid enzyme and almost certainly be catalytically inactive. Therefore, Mutation 1 is most likely to produce a null phenotype.\n\nA conservative missense mutation replaces one amino acid with another of similar biochemical properties. Such substitutions are often tolerated, especially outside of active or binding sites, and are less likely to abolish function than a premature stop. While some conservative changes in critical residues can impair activity, their overall probability of yielding a null phenotype is lower than that of a nonsense mutation. Thus, Mutation 2 is less likely than Mutation 1 to cause a null phenotype.\n\nA silent (synonymous) mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence. Although rare exceptions exist where synonymous changes affect splicing, mRNA stability, or translation kinetics, these are the least commonly associated with complete loss of function compared to nonsense or even conservative missense variants. Hence, Mutation 3 is least likely to cause a null phenotype.\n\nRanking from most to least likely to cause a null phenotype is $1 > 2 > 3$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1520503"}]}
