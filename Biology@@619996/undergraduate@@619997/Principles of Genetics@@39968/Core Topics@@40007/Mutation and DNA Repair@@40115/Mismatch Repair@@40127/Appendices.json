This foundational exercise asks you to act as a molecular detective, tracing the fate of a single replication error that evades repair. By applying the principle of semi-conservative DNA replication, you will see how a transient mismatch is converted into a permanent mutation, forever altering the genetic code of a cell lineage [@problem_id:1503270].", "problem": "In a somatic cell, a DNA replication error results in a single G:T base pair mismatch at a specific locus. The original, correct base pair at this position was a Guanine-Cytosine (G:C) pair. Assume that the cell's mismatch repair system completely fails to detect or correct this G:T mismatch before the cell proceeds through the next S-phase (synthesis phase) and subsequent mitosis. After this single round of DNA replication and cell division, two daughter cells are formed.\n\nConsidering the semi-conservative nature of DNA replication, what will be the genotypes at this specific locus for the two resulting daughter cells?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will have the G:T mismatch.\n\nB. Both daughter cells will have the correct G:C base pair.\n\nC. Both daughter cells will have a mutant Adenine-Thymine (A:T) base pair.\n\nD. One daughter cell will have the correct G:C base pair, and the other will have a mutant A:T base pair.\n\nE. One daughter cell will have the G:T mismatch, and the other will have the correct G:C base pair.", "solution": "We begin with a single locus that originally had a correct $G:C$ base pair. Due to a replication error in a prior cycle, the duplex now contains a single $G:T$ mismatch: one strand carries $G$ (the original template strand), and the opposite strand carries $T$ (a misincorporated base replacing the original $C$). Mismatch repair fails to correct this before the next S phase.\n\nBy the principle of semi-conservative replication, each existing strand serves as a template in the next S phase, and by Watson-Crick base-pairing rules, $G$ templates $C$, and $T$ templates $A$.\n\nTherefore:\n- The strand carrying $G$ will direct incorporation of $C$ on the new complementary strand, yielding a duplex with $G:C$ at that locus (restoring the original pairing).\n- The strand carrying $T$ will direct incorporation of $A$ on the new complementary strand, yielding a duplex with $T:A$ at that locus (fixing a mutation relative to the original).\n\nAfter replication, the two sister chromatids thus carry $G:C$ and $T:A$, respectively. Mitosis segregates these chromatids to two daughter cells, so one daughter cell inherits the correct $G:C$ base pair, and the other inherits the mutant $A:T$ base pair.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that one daughter cell has $G:C$ and the other has $A:T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1503270"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've seen the outcome of a failed repair, let's investigate the elegant mechanism that prevents it. A central challenge for the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system is distinguishing the original template strand from the newly synthesized, error-prone strand. This practice uses a hypothetical bacterial mutant lacking DNA methylation to explore how the cell uses chemical labels to direct the repair machinery, and what happens when that crucial information is lost [@problem_id:1503252].", "problem": "The Mismatch Repair (MMR) system in bacteria is a critical post-replication mechanism that ensures high fidelity of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. To correct errors, the MMR system must distinguish the original template strand from the newly synthesized daughter strand. In many bacteria like *E. coli*, this discrimination is based on the methylation status of the DNA. The enzyme Dam methylase adds a methyl group to the adenine base in GATC sequences. Following replication, the template strand is methylated, while the newly synthesized strand remains temporarily unmethylated. This difference allows the MMR proteins to identify and correct errors on the new strand.\n\nConsider a special laboratory strain of bacteria that has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Dam methylase, rendering the enzyme completely inactive. As a result, after DNA replication, neither the template strand nor the newly synthesized strand carries any methylation marks.\n\nSuppose that during a single round of replication in this mutant strain, a base incorporation error occurs, creating a G-T mismatch. The MMR machinery successfully recognizes the mismatch. However, due to the complete absence of methylation signals, the repair system cannot distinguish the template strand from the new strand. It proceeds to select one of the two strands for excision and repair with equal likelihood.\n\nWhat is the probability that this repair event will incorrectly use the erroneous new strand as a template, thereby permanently establishing the replication error as a mutation in the DNA sequence? Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "Let's analyze the scenario step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A replication error has occurred, resulting in a G-T mismatch. Let's denote the original template strand as the \"parent\" strand and the newly synthesized strand as the \"daughter\" strand. The correct base pair in the original DNA was G-C. During replication of the G-containing parent strand, a T was incorrectly incorporated into the daughter strand instead of a C.\n    -   Parent Strand: ... G ...\n    -   Daughter Strand: ... T ...\n\n2.  **Goal of Repair:** The goal of a proper Mismatch Repair (MMR) event is to restore the original G-C base pair. This would involve excising the 'T' from the daughter strand and replacing it with a 'C'.\n\n3.  **The Problem in the Mutant Strain:** In a normal (wild-type) cell, the parent strand would be methylated, and the daughter strand would be unmethylated. The MMR system would recognize the unmethylated strand as the new, error-prone strand and correctly repair the T to a C. However, in the provided `dam-` mutant strain, neither strand is methylated. The MMR system recognizes the G-T mismatch but has no information to determine which base is the original and which is the error.\n\n4.  **The Random Choice:** The problem states that the MMR system chooses one of the two strands for repair with equal likelihood. This means there are two possible outcomes, each with a probability of $1/2$.\n\n5.  **Outcome 1: The MMR system chooses the daughter strand for repair.**\n    -   Probability: $1/2$\n    -   The system identifies the strand containing the T as the one to be repaired. It excises the incorrect T.\n    -   It uses the parent strand, which contains the correct base G, as the template.\n    -   A new base, C, is synthesized to pair with G.\n    -   The final base pair is G-C.\n    -   **Result:** The error is correctly repaired, and the original genetic information is restored. No mutation is established.\n\n6.  **Outcome 2: The MMR system chooses the parent strand for repair.**\n    -   Probability: $1/2$\n    -   The system identifies the strand containing the G as the one to be repaired. It incorrectly assumes the T on the daughter strand is the \"correct\" template base.\n    -   It excises the original base G from the parent strand.\n    -   It uses the daughter strand, which contains the erroneous base T, as the template.\n    -   A new base, A, is synthesized to pair with T.\n    -   The final base pair is A-T.\n    -   **Result:** The original G-C pair has now been converted to an A-T pair. The replication error has been \"repaired\" into a permanent mutation that will be passed on to subsequent generations of cells.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the probability that the repair event will permanently establish the mutation. This corresponds exactly to Outcome 2. Therefore, the probability is $1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "1503252"}, {"introduction": "The molecular principles of MMR have tangible, observable consequences that can be identified in the laboratory. A breakdown in this repair system leads to a dramatically increased rate of spontaneous mutation, creating a \"mutator\" phenotype. This final practice moves from theory to application, challenging you to design a classic genetics experiment to screen for and identify an MMR-deficient bacterial strain based on its higher mutation frequency [@problem_id:1503214].", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating a newly isolated bacterial strain, designated `Strain P`, which is hypothesized to have a faulty Mismatch Repair (MMR) system. For a control, the geneticist uses a standard laboratory strain, `Strain C`, which is known to possess a fully functional MMR system. Both strains are auxotrophic for the amino acid leucine, meaning their genotype is `leu-` and they are unable to synthesize leucine on their own. Consequently, they can only grow on a medium that is supplemented with this amino acid.\n\nThe researcher has access to two types of growth media:\n1.  **Rich Medium:** A complete medium containing all necessary nutrients for bacterial growth, including leucine.\n2.  **Minimal Medium:** A medium containing only the essential salts and a carbon source, but specifically lacking leucine.\n\nThe goal is to design a single experiment that provides the most direct and conclusive evidence regarding the functional status of the MMR system in `Strain P` compared to `Strain C`. Which of the following experimental plans would be the most effective for testing the hypothesis that `Strain P` has a deficient MMR system?\n\nA. Grow liquid cultures of `Strain C` and `Strain P` to the same cell density in Rich Medium. Plate an equal, large number of cells from each culture onto separate Minimal Medium plates. Incubate the plates and compare the number of colonies that form.\n\nB. Streak `Strain C` and `Strain P` on a single Rich Medium plate. After incubation, compare the average size of the colonies formed by each strain.\n\nC. Inoculate two flasks of Rich Medium, one with `Strain C` and one with `Strain P`. Monitor the optical density of both cultures over time to determine and compare their growth rates.\n\nD. Plate a large number of `Strain P` cells onto a Minimal Medium plate. If any colonies grow, it confirms that `Strain P` has a deficient MMR system.\n\nE. Expose a liquid culture of `Strain P` to a chemical mutagen and a separate culture of `Strain C` to the same mutagen. Plate cells from both cultures onto separate Rich Medium plates and count the total number of surviving colonies.", "solution": "We are given two strains that are both $\\mathrm{leu}^{-}$ (cannot synthesize leucine), and two media: Rich Medium (contains leucine) and Minimal Medium (lacks leucine). The hypothesis is that Strain P has a deficient Mismatch Repair (MMR) system, which would increase its spontaneous mutation rate relative to Strain C.\n\nPrinciple 1: A defective MMR system increases the spontaneous mutation rate. Denote the per-cell mutation rate to a selectable phenotype as $\\mu$. The hypothesis implies $\\mu_{P}>\\mu_{C}$ for the reversion or suppression from $\\mathrm{leu}^{-}$ to a phenotype that can grow without leucine (operationally denoted $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$ or an equivalent suppressor).\n\nPrinciple 2: Minimal Medium lacking leucine selects for $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$ revertants (or suppressors). Only cells that have acquired a mutation restoring leucine prototrophy will form colonies. Therefore, when plating a large number $N$ of cells on Minimal Medium, the number of colonies $M$ observed reflects the number of $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$ mutants present in the inoculum. Under matched conditions and equal $N$, a higher mutation rate yields, on average, a higher $M$.\n\nDefine $N_{C}=N_{P}$ as the equal, large number of cells plated from Strain C and Strain P, respectively. Let $M_{C}$ and $M_{P}$ be the observed number of colonies on Minimal Medium from Strain C and Strain P plates. If $\\mu_{P}>\\mu_{C}$ due to MMR deficiency, then, controlling for equal $N$, we expect $M_{P}>M_{C}$ on average. Growing both strains first in Rich Medium ensures that both reach the same cell density regardless of auxotrophy, and plating onto Minimal Medium ensures stringent selection for revertants only.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\n- Option A grows both strains to the same density in Rich Medium, plates equal large numbers $N_{C}=N_{P}$ onto Minimal Medium, and compares $M_{C}$ versus $M_{P}$. This directly operationalizes the test above: greater $M_{P}$ relative to $M_{C}$ indicates a higher spontaneous mutation frequency consistent with MMR deficiency. This is the most direct and conclusive among the listed single experiments.\n\n- Option B compares colony size on Rich Medium. Colony size reflects growth rate and fitness in nutrient-replete conditions, not specifically mutation rate or MMR function; it is not a direct test of MMR deficiency.\n\n- Option C compares bulk growth rates in Rich Medium via optical density. Growth rate is not a direct readout of MMR status; many factors influence it, and MMR defects do not necessarily alter growth kinetics under non-stress conditions.\n\n- Option D plates only Strain P on Minimal Medium and infers MMR deficiency if any colonies appear. The presence of any revertant colonies is not diagnostic, because even an MMR-proficient strain can yield rare revertants; without comparison to Strain C and without controlling $N$, this is not conclusive.\n\n- Option E treats both strains with a chemical mutagen and counts surviving colonies on Rich Medium. This measures survival after DNA damage, which conflates damage tolerance and repair processes and does not directly quantify spontaneous mutation rates or MMR function. Plating on Rich Medium does not select for a specific mutation, so survival is not a direct metric of MMR deficiency.\n\nTherefore, the experimental plan that most directly tests the hypothesis that Strain P has a deficient MMR system, using the selectable $\\mathrm{leu}^{-}\\to\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$ phenotype and controlling for equal plated numbers, is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1503214"}]}
