This first exercise [@problem_id:1483559] challenges you to predict the consequences of deleting a key enzyme in this pathway, AP endonuclease. By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will develop a concrete understanding of how the failure of a single molecular step can lead to profound cellular sensitivity to specific types of DNA damage.", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The BER pathway is crucial for correcting single-base DNA damage. A key enzyme in this pathway is AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) endonuclease, which recognizes a site in the DNA backbone where a base is missing (an AP site) and initiates the repair process by cleaving the DNA strand at that location.\n\nThe geneticist creates a mutant yeast strain with a complete deletion of the gene encoding AP endonuclease. This mutant strain and a wild-type (non-mutant) strain are cultured separately. Both cultures are then exposed to a chemical mutagen that significantly increases the rate of spontaneous depurination, a process where a purine base (adenine or guanine) is cleaved from the deoxyribose sugar, leaving behind an AP site in the DNA.\n\nAfter a period of exposure to this mutagen, the two cultures are plated on nutrient agar to assess cell viability. Which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected phenotype of the AP endonuclease-deficient mutant strain when compared to the wild-type strain?\n\nA. The mutant strain will be highly resistant to the mutagen because the inability to cleave the DNA at AP sites prevents the formation of potentially lethal single-strand breaks.\n\nB. The mutant strain will exhibit a survival rate similar to the wild-type, but will display a much higher frequency of C-to-A transversion mutations.\n\nC. The mutant strain will be hypersensitive to the mutagen, showing a significantly lower survival rate than the wild-type strain.\n\nD. The mutant strain will be unaffected by the mutagen, as the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway will fully compensate for the loss of AP endonuclease function.\n\nE. The mutant strain will grow faster than the wild-type, as it does not expend energy on repairing the AP sites.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the phenotype of a yeast strain lacking AP endonuclease when exposed to an agent that creates apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. To solve this, we must understand the role of AP endonuclease within the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway and the consequences of its absence.\n\n1.  **Identify the Damage and the Primary Repair Pathway:** The chemical agent causes depurination, creating AP sites. This type of damage, involving a missing base without major distortion of the DNA helix, is primarily repaired by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway.\n\n2.  **Outline the Steps of the BER Pathway:**\n    *   **Step A: Damage Recognition and Base Removal:** In many cases, BER starts with a DNA glycosylase recognizing and removing a damaged or incorrect base (e.g., uracil). This action creates an AP site. In this problem's scenario, the mutagen directly creates the AP site, so the pathway effectively begins at the next step.\n    *   **Step B: AP Site Processing:** An AP endonuclease recognizes the sugar-phosphate backbone at the baseless site. Its critical function is to incise the phosphodiester backbone, typically on the 5' side of the AP site. This creates a nick in the DNA, which is an essential prerequisite for the subsequent repair steps.\n    *   **Step C: Synthesis and Ligation:** A DNA polymerase uses the intact opposite strand as a template to insert the correct nucleotide at the nick. The same polymerase or another enzyme then removes the baseless sugar-phosphate remnant. Finally, DNA ligase seals the nick in the backbone, restoring the integrity of the DNA strand.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Consequence of the Mutation:** The mutant strain has a complete deletion of the gene for AP endonuclease. This means that Step B of the BER pathway is completely blocked. When the mutagen creates AP sites in the DNA of this mutant, the cell is unable to incise the backbone at these locations.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cellular Fate:** The AP sites themselves are highly toxic lesions. They do not contain any genetic information and thus block the progression of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. When a replication fork encounters an unrepaired AP site, it can stall and collapse. This collapse often leads to the formation of more complex and lethal DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks. The accumulation of these unrepaired AP sites and the subsequent replication-dependent damage leads to widespread genomic instability and ultimately triggers apoptosis or cell death.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A. The mutant strain will be highly resistant...:** This is incorrect. The AP site itself is the primary problem. Preventing its repair by removing AP endonuclease does not confer resistance; it makes the cell unable to resolve the toxic lesion, leading to increased sensitivity.\n    *   **B. The mutant strain will exhibit a similar survival rate but higher mutation frequency...:** This is incorrect. The primary consequence of numerous AP sites is not a specific type of point mutation, but rather replication fork collapse and cell death. Therefore, the survival rate will be drastically lower, not similar. Certain error-prone polymerases can insert a base (often an 'A') opposite an AP site (the 'A-rule'), but the sheer number of sites created by the mutagen would overwhelm this system and lead to lethality.\n    *   **C. The mutant strain will be hypersensitive...:** This is correct. The inability to repair the flood of AP sites leads to the accumulation of toxic lesions, replication fork collapse, and catastrophic DNA damage, resulting in a very low survival rate compared to the wild-type, which can efficiently repair these sites.\n    *   **D. The mutant strain will be unaffected...:** This is incorrect. The Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway primarily recognizes and repairs bulky lesions that distort the DNA helix (e.g., thymine dimers caused by UV light). While there can be minor overlaps, NER is not the primary pathway for AP sites and cannot efficiently compensate for a complete loss of the essential BER enzyme, AP endonuclease.\n    *   **E. The mutant strain will grow faster...:** This is incorrect. DNA repair is a fundamental process for survival. The energy cost is negligible compared to the lethal consequences of unrepaired DNA damage. The mutant strain will experience severe stress and cell cycle arrest, not faster growth.\n\nTherefore, the loss of AP endonuclease function renders the cell unable to complete the BER pathway, leading to the accumulation of toxic AP sites and profound sensitivity to agents that cause this type of damage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1483559"}, {"introduction": "Next, we turn our attention to the most severe type of DNA lesion: the double-strand break (DSB). This problem [@problem_id:1483613] presents a fascinating case where the primary repair pathway, canonical Non-Homologous End Joining (c-NHEJ), is inactive. By analyzing the molecular 'scars' left behind after repair, you are tasked with deducing the identity of a crucial backup pathway, highlighting the cell's redundant and adaptive strategies for preserving genomic integrity.", "problem": "In molecular biology research, understanding how cells respond to DNA damage is critical. The most dangerous form of DNA damage is the Double-Strand Break (DSB), which can lead to cell death or chromosomal rearrangements if not repaired correctly. Mammalian cells primarily use two major pathways to repair DSBs: the high-fidelity Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway, and the faster but more error-prone canonical Non-Homologous End Joining (c-NHEJ) pathway.\n\nAn experiment is conducted using a specially engineered human cell line that has a complete knockout of the gene encoding the Ku70 protein. The Ku70 protein, along with its partner Ku80, forms a heterodimer that is the first sensor of a DSB in the c-NHEJ pathway, binding to the broken DNA ends and recruiting the rest of the repair machinery.\n\nThese Ku70-deficient cells are exposed to a controlled dose of ionizing radiation to induce DSBs. Subsequent analysis reveals that while the cells are more sensitive to radiation than wild-type cells, a significant fraction survive, indicating that an alternative repair mechanism is active. To characterize this repair, the genomic DNA at numerous repaired break sites is sequenced. The analysis reveals a highly consistent repair signature: nearly all repaired junctions exhibit deletions of the original sequence, with the deletion size typically ranging from 5 to 25 base pairs. Furthermore, the newly formed junction is always located at a site where short (2-5 base pair) identical sequences, known as microhomologies, were present on the DNA strands on either side of the original break.\n\nBased on this specific molecular signature of deletions templated by short flanking identical sequences, identify the primary DSB repair pathway that is compensating for the loss of c-NHEJ in these Ku70-deficient cells.\n\nA. Homologous Recombination (HR)\n\nB. Base Excision Repair (BER)\n\nC. Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)\n\nD. Mismatch Repair (MMR)\n\nE. Microhomology-Mediated End Joining (MMEJ)", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the DNA repair pathway responsible for a specific repair signature observed in cells lacking the canonical Non-Homologous End Joining (c-NHEJ) protein, Ku70. The key features of this signature are (1) the repair of Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs), (2) the presence of deletions ranging from 5 to 25 base pairs, and (3) the use of short 2-5 base pair microhomologies to mediate the repair.\n\nFirst, we must recognize that the absence of Ku70 cripples the canonical NHEJ pathway, as Ku70/Ku80 is the primary sensor of broken ends for this process. Therefore, the cell must rely on alternative or backup pathways. We will evaluate each option based on the observed molecular signature.\n\nA. Homologous Recombination (HR): HR is a high-fidelity DSB repair pathway that uses a long, intact homologous DNA sequence as a template, typically from a sister chromatid. This process is generally error-free and does not result in deletions at the repair site. Its mechanism involves extensive end resection, strand invasion into the template, DNA synthesis, and ligation. It does not rely on short microhomologies located directly at the breakpoint. Thus, the observed deletion-prone repair is inconsistent with HR.\n\nB. Base Excision Repair (BER): BER is a pathway that corrects damage to a single nitrogenous base (e.g., deamination or oxidation). It acts on single-strand lesions, not DSBs. Its mechanism involves a DNA glycosylase removing the damaged base, followed by an AP endonuclease cutting the DNA backbone, and then polymerase/ligase action. Since the initial damage is a DSB, BER is not the relevant pathway.\n\nC. Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER): NER is designed to remove bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation or large chemical adducts. NER excises a short oligonucleotide containing the lesion and resynthesizes the gap. Like BER, it is not a primary pathway for repairing DSBs.\n\nD. Mismatch Repair (MMR): MMR corrects errors introduced during DNA replication, such as base-base mismatches or small insertion/deletion loops. The MMR system recognizes the distortion in the DNA helix caused by the mismatch and preferentially corrects the newly synthesized strand. It does not operate on DSBs generated by extrinsic factors like ionizing radiation.\n\nE. Microhomology-Mediated End Joining (MMEJ): MMEJ, also known as alternative-NHEJ (alt-NHEJ), is a DSB repair pathway that is distinct from c-NHEJ and HR. It is often considered a backup pathway that becomes more active when c-NHEJ is deficient. The mechanism of MMEJ perfectly matches the observed signature. First, the 5' ends of the DSB are resected by nucleases, creating 3' single-stranded overhangs. The cell then searches these overhangs for short regions of microhomology (typically 2-5 bp or more). Once found, these microhomologous sequences anneal. This alignment brings the two broken ends together, but leaves non-homologous single-stranded flaps of DNA. These flaps, along with any intervening DNA between the microhomology sites, are excised by endonucleases. Finally, DNA polymerase fills in any remaining small gaps, and DNA ligase seals the final nicks. The critical consequence of this mechanism is the deletion of the DNA sequence that was originally between the two microhomology blocks, which perfectly explains the observed 5-25 base pair deletions.\n\nTherefore, the molecular signature of small deletions flanked by microhomologies is the hallmark of the MMEJ pathway. This pathway is compensating for the loss of c-NHEJ in the Ku70-deficient cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1483613"}, {"introduction": "Finally, let's quantify the incredible power of DNA repair systems in maintaining genomic fidelity during replication.

In this `mutL-` strain, the efficiency of the MMR system is reduced to $E'_{MMR} = 0.600$ (i.e., 60.0%), while the DNA polymerase's intrinsic error rate and proofreading efficiency remain unchanged.\n\nA single `mutL-` bacterium is used to inoculate a fresh culture medium.
