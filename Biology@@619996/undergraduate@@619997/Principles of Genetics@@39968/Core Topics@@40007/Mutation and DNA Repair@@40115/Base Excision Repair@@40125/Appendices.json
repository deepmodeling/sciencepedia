This first exercise simulates a classic laboratory experiment to help you visualize the initial steps of this process. By predicting the outcome of an in vitro repair reaction, you will explore how the initial enzymatic activities of BER physically alter the structure of a DNA molecule, a change that can be detected using gel electrophoresis [@problem_id:2305493].", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the initial steps of the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway in a bacterial cell extract. Researchers prepare a large quantity of a standard 4.5 kilobase-pair (kbp) circular plasmid. In its native state, this plasmid is supercoiled. A single uracil (U) base is incorporated into one strand of this double-stranded plasmid, opposite a guanine (G), creating a single U:G mispair.\n\nTwo separate reaction mixtures are prepared in identical buffer conditions suitable for DNA repair enzymes.\n- **Tube A**: Contains the uracil-containing plasmid and a cell-free extract from a wild-type bacterial strain. This extract contains all the necessary enzymes for DNA repair, including Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG).\n- **Tube B**: Contains the uracil-containing plasmid and a cell-free extract from a mutant bacterial strain that has a null mutation in the gene for UDG, meaning it completely lacks functional UDG enzyme. This extract is otherwise identical to the wild-type extract.\n\nAfter incubation for a time sufficient for the initial enzymatic steps of repair to occur, the contents of both tubes are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. On such a gel, the supercoiled plasmid migrates the fastest, the linear form migrates at an intermediate rate, and the nicked (open circular) form migrates the slowest.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the predominant form of the plasmid you would expect to observe in each tube?\n\nA. Tube A: Supercoiled; Tube B: Supercoiled\n\nB. Tube A: Nicked circular; Tube B: Supercoiled\n\nC. Tube A: Linear; Tube B: Nicked circular\n\nD. Tube A: Supercoiled; Tube B: Nicked circular\n\nE. Tube A: Nicked circular; Tube B: Nicked circular", "solution": "The plasmid starts as a covalently closed circular DNA that is supercoiled. A single-strand break (nick) is sufficient to relax supercoiling, converting it to the nicked (open circular) form, which migrates slowest on agarose gels, while the supercoiled form migrates fastest. The linear form would require a double-strand break, which is not generated by the initial steps of base excision repair.\n\nBase Excision Repair of a U:G mispair proceeds initially as follows:\n1) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) removes the uracil base from the DNA, creating an abasic (AP) site in the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n2) An AP endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at the AP site, generating a single-strand break (nick).\n3) DNA polymerase performs gap filling, and DNA ligase seals the nick; however, until ligation occurs, the DNA remains nicked and thus open circular.\n\nTube A contains UDG and all other BER enzymes. Therefore:\n- UDG excises U to form an AP site.\n- AP endonuclease incises at the AP site, producing a nick.\n- During the time window described as sufficient for initial steps, ligation is not assumed to be complete; thus the predominant product is nicked (open circular) DNA.\n\nTube B lacks UDG but is otherwise identical. Therefore:\n- No U excision occurs, no AP site is formed, and AP endonuclease has no substrate.\n- The plasmid remains covalently closed and supercoiled.\n\nLinear DNA is not expected in either tube because the initial BER steps create only a single-strand break, not a double-strand break.\n\nThus, Tube A will predominantly contain nicked circular plasmid, and Tube B will predominantly contain supercoiled plasmid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2305493"}, {"introduction": "The BER pathway is a highly coordinated sequence of events, where each enzyme prepares the DNA substrate for the next. This problem challenges you to dissect this sequence by considering a hypothetical scenario where a key enzyme, AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1), is non-functional. This thought experiment will clarify the specific role of APE1 and reinforce the concept that repair is a stepwise process where the failure of one step halts the entire downstream pathway [@problem_id:2305512].", "problem": "Base Excision Repair (BER) is a critical cellular mechanism for correcting single-base DNA damage. The process is initiated by a DNA glycosylase, which recognizes and removes the damaged or incorrect base by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond, leaving behind an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, commonly known as an abasic (AP) site. The next step is carried out by an enzyme called AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1), which nicks the phosphodiester backbone immediately 5' to the AP site, creating a single-strand break that is a substrate for subsequent repair enzymes.\n\nConsider a human cell line that has a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding for APE1, rendering the protein completely non-functional. However, all other DNA repair proteins, including various DNA glycosylases, are fully functional. A C:G base pair in the DNA of one of these cells undergoes spontaneous deamination, converting the cytosine base to a uracil base.\n\nWhat will be the most likely state of the DNA at this specific site after the cell's BER machinery has had an opportunity to act?\n\nA. The DNA will contain a uracil base paired with a guanine base, as the repair pathway cannot be initiated.\n\nB. The DNA will have a single-strand break (a nick) in the phosphodiester backbone, and the abasic site will have been removed.\n\nC. The DNA will contain an abasic site where the uracil was, and the phosphodiester backbone will be intact at that location.\n\nD. The DNA strand will be fully repaired, with a normal cytosine base correctly paired with the guanine.\n\nE. The DNA will suffer a double-strand break at the site of the damage.", "solution": "1) Spontaneous deamination converts a cytosine in a C:G pair to uracil, producing a U:G mispair.\n\n2) BER initiation is performed by a DNA glycosylase specific for uracil (e.g., uracil DNA glycosylase). This enzyme recognizes the U:G mispair and cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of uracil, removing the base and leaving an abasic (AP) site. As a monofunctional glycosylase, it does not incise the phosphodiester backbone.\n\n3) In normal BER, the next step requires AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) to incise the DNA backbone immediately 5' to the AP site, generating a single-strand nick with a 3'-OH and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate. This incision is essential to allow polymerase and ligase to complete repair.\n\n4) In the given cell, APE1 is completely non-functional. Therefore, the AP site generated by the glycosylase cannot be incised. No nick is formed, and downstream steps (gap filling and ligation) cannot proceed.\n\n5) Consequently, the most likely state of the lesion after the BER machinery acts is an intact phosphodiester backbone containing an unrepaired AP site at the position formerly occupied by uracil.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is that the DNA contains an abasic site with an intact backbone at that location.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2305512"}, {"introduction": "After exploring the mechanism of BER, it's crucial to understand why this pathway is essential for maintaining genomic integrity. This final practice problem shifts focus from the repair process itself to the ultimate consequences of its failure. By tracing the fate of a single damaged base through DNA replication in a repair-deficient cell, you will discover how a common chemical event, if left uncorrected, leads directly to a permanent and heritable mutation [@problem_id:1471574].", "problem": "In the genome of a bacterium, a specific locus initially contains a Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) base pair. Through spontaneous chemical decay, the cytosine (C) residue on one of the strands undergoes deamination, converting it into a uracil (U) residue. This creates a G-U mismatch. This particular bacterium is a mutant strain that completely lacks a functional Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG) enzyme, which is the primary enzyme responsible for initiating the Base Excision Repair (BER) of uracil in DNA.\n\nAssuming no other repair mechanisms act on this mismatch, the cell proceeds to undergo exactly one complete round of semi-conservative DNA replication and subsequent cell division. What will be the base pairs found at this specific nucleotide position in the genomes of the two resulting daughter cells?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will have a G-C pair.\n\nB. Both daughter cells will have an A-T pair.\n\nC. One daughter cell will have a G-C pair, and the other will have an A-U pair.\n\nD. One daughter cell will have a G-C pair, and the other will have an A-T pair.\n\nE. Both daughter cells will retain the G-U mismatch.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the genetic outcome of a specific DNA lesion in a repair-deficient cell after one round of replication.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial state and the DNA damage.\nThe starting point is a normal Watson-Crick G-C base pair. Let's denote the two strands as Strand 1 and Strand 2.\nStrand 1: ... G ...\nStrand 2: ... C ...\n\nThe cytosine (C) on Strand 2 undergoes spontaneous deamination to become uracil (U).\nStrand 1: ... G ...\nStrand 2: ... U ...\nThis creates a non-canonical G-U mismatch in the DNA duplex.\n\nStep 2: Consider the effect of the enzyme deficiency.\nThe cell lacks functional Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG). UDG is the enzyme that recognizes uracil in DNA and cleaves the N-glycosidic bond between the uracil base and the deoxyribose sugar, initiating Base Excision Repair (BER). Since UDG is absent, the G-U mismatch is not recognized or repaired and will persist until DNA replication occurs.\n\nStep 3: Model one round of semi-conservative DNA replication.\nDuring DNA replication, the two strands of the parent DNA molecule separate, and each serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.\n\nStep 4: Trace the fate of Strand 1.\nStrand 1, containing the original guanine (G), serves as a template. According to the standard base-pairing rules (Watson-Crick), DNA polymerase will read the G and incorporate a cytosine (C) into the newly synthesized strand.\nTemplate Strand 1: ... G ...\nNew Strand 2':      ... C ...\nThe resulting DNA duplex in one of the daughter cells will consist of Strand 1 and New Strand 2', forming a G-C pair. This restores the original, wild-type sequence.\n\nStep 5: Trace the fate of Strand 2.\nStrand 2, which now contains the uracil (U), serves as the other template. DNA polymerase reads the bases on this template. Uracil has the same base-pairing properties as thymine (T). Therefore, the DNA polymerase will read the U on the template strand and incorporate an adenine (A) into the newly synthesized strand.\nTemplate Strand 2: ... U ...\nNew Strand 1':      ... A ...\nThe resulting DNA duplex in the second daughter cell will consist of New Strand 1' and Strand 2, forming an A-U pair at the locus.\n\nStep 6: Conclude the state of the two daughter cells.\nAfter one round of replication and cell division, the two daughter cells will have different genotypes at this specific locus.\n- Daughter Cell 1 will contain a DNA molecule with a G-C base pair.\n- Daughter Cell 2 will contain a DNA molecule with an A-U base pair.\n\nThis process illustrates how a deamination event can lead to a mutation if not repaired. The original G-C pair has been segregated into one G-C pair and one A-U pair. If the second cell were to replicate again, the A-U pair would yield one daughter with an A-U pair and another with a permanent A-T pair, completing the C-to-T transition mutation in that lineage.\n\nStep 7: Match the conclusion with the given options.\nThe outcome is that one daughter cell has a G-C pair and the other has an A-U pair. This corresponds to option C.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because replication of the U-containing strand leads to a mutation.\n- Option B is incorrect because this represents the final state after two rounds of replication for the mutated lineage, not one.\n- Option D is incorrect because after one round of replication, the uracil is paired with adenine, resulting in an A-U pair, not an A-T pair. The U has not been replaced with a T.\n- Option E is incorrect because replication is a process that resolves the mismatch into two different, fully base-paired duplexes in the daughter cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1471574"}]}
