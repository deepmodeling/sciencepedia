Since the genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets, not every deletion or insertion will disrupt the reading frame. This first exercise [@problem_id:2296661] uses a key example from human genetics to challenge you to apply the 'rule of three' and distinguish a true frameshift from an in-frame mutation, a critical distinction for understanding a mutation's impact.", "problem": "In molecular genetics, the sequence of nucleotides in a gene's coding region is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three, known as codons. This establishes a \"reading frame\" for protein synthesis. A medical research team is studying a genetic disorder and sequences the responsible gene from an affected individual. They compare it to the gene from a healthy individual and find a single, specific mutation: a deletion of exactly three consecutive base pairs from the middle of an exon. Analysis of the protein produced from the mutated gene reveals that it is missing a single amino acid compared to the normal protein, but the entire amino acid sequence following the deletion site is identical to the normal protein.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements most accurately classifies this genetic event?\n\nA. This is a frameshift mutation because the deletion of nucleotides has altered the gene's sequence.\n\nB. This is a nonsense mutation because the deletion of an entire codon has resulted in a nonfunctional protein.\n\nC. This is a silent mutation because the amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation is unaffected.\n\nD. This is not a frameshift mutation; it is an in-frame deletion because the number of bases deleted is a multiple of three, thus preserving the downstream reading frame.\n\nE. This is an in-frame insertion, which is a type of frameshift mutation, that coincidentally restored the original reading frame.", "solution": "The genetic code is read in non-overlapping codons of length $3$. A frameshift mutation arises when an insertion or deletion changes the number of nucleotides by a value not divisible by $3$, thereby shifting the reading frame and altering all downstream codons and the amino acid sequence after the mutation site.\n\nIn the described case, exactly $3$ consecutive base pairs are deleted from the coding region. Deleting $3$ nucleotides removes exactly one codon but preserves the original reading frame for all downstream codons. The observed protein phenotype—loss of a single amino acid with an otherwise identical downstream amino acid sequence—matches this principle: an in-frame deletion of one codon.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A (frameshift) is incorrect because the deletion is a multiple of $3$, and the downstream reading frame and sequence are preserved.\n- Option B (nonsense) is incorrect because a nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon, producing a truncated protein, which is not observed.\n- Option C (silent) is incorrect because a silent mutation does not change the amino acid sequence; here, one amino acid is missing.\n- Option D correctly identifies this as an in-frame deletion that preserves the reading frame.\n- Option E is incorrect because the event is not an insertion and, moreover, in-frame insertions or deletions are not frameshifts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate classification is an in-frame deletion that is not a frameshift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2296661"}, {"introduction": "Once a reading frame is shifted, is the genetic message downstream permanently lost? This problem [@problem_id:1489000] presents a fascinating thought experiment where a second mutation is introduced to counteract a first. It requires you to think about the mathematical nature of the genetic code and how multiple frameshift events can interact, sometimes leading to a surprising restoration of the original reading frame.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the `bacR` gene in a bacterium, which is responsible for conferring resistance to a novel antibiotic. The coding sequence of the wild-type `bacR` gene is known to be 1200 base pairs long, producing a fully functional resistance protein.\n\nA non-resistant mutant strain, designated `M1`, is found to have a single nucleotide insertion (+1 frameshift) at nucleotide position 301 of the `bacR` coding sequence. This mutation renders the protein non-functional.\n\nIn an attempt to restore function, the biologist introduces a second, independent mutation into the `M1` strain, creating the `M2` strain. This second mutation is an insertion of two adjacent nucleotides (+2 frameshift) that occurs 60 base pairs downstream from the site of the first insertion, corresponding to position 361 of the original wild-type gene's coding sequence.\n\nAssuming that no new stop codons are generated within the altered sequence between the two mutation sites, which of the following statements most accurately describes the protein produced by the `M2` strain when compared to the wild-type protein?\n\nA. The protein produced by `M2` will have an altered amino acid sequence only in the region between the two insertion sites and will be one amino acid longer overall than the wild-type protein. The amino acid sequence downstream of the second insertion will be identical to that of the wild-type.\n\nB. The protein produced by `M2` will be three amino acids longer than the wild-type protein, but its amino acid sequence will be otherwise identical.\n\nC. The protein produced by `M2` will be completely non-functional as the reading frame is permanently shifted after the first insertion, and the second insertion only further disrupts the sequence.\n\nD. The protein produced by `M2` will be identical in both length and amino acid sequence to the wild-type protein because the two insertions have a mutually canceling effect.\n\nE. The protein produced by `M2` will have the same length as the wild-type protein, but the 20 amino acids encoded by the region between the two mutations will be incorrect.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Translation reads nucleotides in non-overlapping codons of length $3$; thus $3$ nucleotides encode $1$ amino acid.\n- A frameshift caused by an insertion of length $k$ shifts the reading frame by $k \\pmod{3}$. Two independent frameshifts combine additively modulo $3$.\n- If the net frameshift modulo $3$ is zero, the original reading frame is restored downstream of the second event. The total coding length changes by the net number of inserted nucleotides.\n\nWild-type gene:\n- Coding sequence length $L=1200$ nucleotides. Number of codons $= \\frac{1200}{3}=400$ amino acids.\n\nM1 mutation:\n- First insertion: $+1$ nucleotide at position $301$. Frame shift change $=1 \\pmod 3$, so the reading frame is shifted by $+1$ from position $301$ onward.\n\nM2 second-site mutation:\n- Second insertion: $+2$ nucleotides at position $361$ of the wild-type coordinate, which is $60$ nucleotides downstream of the first site.\n- Net frameshift from both insertions: $1+2=3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so the original reading frame is restored immediately downstream of the second insertion.\n\nEffect on sequence segments and length:\n- Upstream of position $301$: no change, amino acid sequence identical to wild-type.\n- Between the two insertions: the reading frame is shifted by $+1$; hence codons in this interval are altered. The wild-type interval length is $361-301=60$ nucleotides, which encodes $\\frac{60}{3}=20$ amino acids. In M2, this interval contains the original $60$ nucleotides plus $1+2=3$ inserted nucleotides, totaling $60+3=63$ nucleotides, which encodes $\\frac{63}{3}=21$ amino acids. Under the assumption that no new stop codons arise in this interval, translation proceeds through it, producing an altered stretch of amino acids.\n- Downstream of the second insertion: frame is restored ($0 \\pmod{3}$ net shift), so codon boundaries match wild-type and the amino acid sequence is identical to wild-type from that point to the end.\n- Total coding length in M2: $1200 + (1+2)=1203$ nucleotides, yielding $\\frac{1203}{3}=401$ codons, i.e., one more amino acid than wild-type.\n\nConclusion:\n- The protein from M2 differs from wild-type only in the region between the two insertions, is one amino acid longer overall, and matches wild-type downstream of the second insertion.

Eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated quality control systems to protect themselves from potentially harmful, non-functional proteins. This final practice problem [@problem_id:1488967] moves beyond the sequence itself to explore a crucial cellular response, Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), which often determines the ultimate fate of a transcript carrying a frameshift-induced premature stop codon.", "problem": "A researcher is studying a newly discovered human gene, `GENE-X`, which is found to contain 10 exons. In a patient with a genetic disorder, sequencing reveals a single nucleotide deletion at the beginning of exon 2. This deletion causes a frameshift, which in turn creates a premature termination codon (PTC) shortly after the site of the mutation, still within the sequence of exon 2. Assume that the promoter and other regulatory regions are unaffected, allowing for normal transcription of the gene into pre-mRNA, and that the pre-mRNA is processed by the spliceosome correctly.\n\nBased on your understanding of eukaryotic gene expression and its quality control mechanisms, which of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of the protein product from this mutated allele?\n\nA. A full-length, but non-functional, protein will be synthesized.\n\nB. A stable, truncated protein will be synthesized, corresponding to the sequence of exon 1 and the beginning of exon 2.\n\nC. A protein with a single incorrect amino acid will be synthesized, but it will be full-length.\n\nD. No protein will be synthesized because the mutation will prevent the transcription of the gene.\n\nE. It is highly unlikely that any protein will be synthesized because the faulty messenger RNA (mRNA) will be targeted for degradation.", "solution": "A single-nucleotide deletion at the beginning of exon 2 shifts the reading frame from that point onward. By definition, a frameshift alters all downstream codons and typically introduces an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC) shortly thereafter. The problem states that the PTC lies within exon 2.\n\nBecause the promoter and other regulatory regions are intact and the spliceosome processes the pre-mRNA correctly, a mature mRNA will be produced that contains a PTC in exon 2. In eukaryotes, transcripts harboring a PTC located upstream of at least one downstream exon–exon junction are recognized by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway during the pioneer round of translation. Mechanistically, exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited upstream of exon–exon junctions during splicing and are normally removed by a translating ribosome. If translation terminates prematurely at a PTC that lies upstream of any remaining EJCs, the persistence of downstream EJCs recruits NMD factors (such as UPF proteins), which trigger rapid mRNA degradation through deadenylation, decapping, and exonucleolytic decay.\n\nIn this case, the PTC resides in exon 2 of a 10-exon transcript, so multiple exon–exon junctions remain downstream. Thus, during the pioneer round, termination at the PTC will occur while downstream EJCs are still present, efficiently activating NMD. As a result, the faulty mRNA will be degraded and it is highly unlikely that a stable truncated protein accumulates. Although a ribosome may initiate translation before decay is completed, the surveillance mechanism greatly reduces the steady-state level of the mRNA and prevents accumulation of a truncated protein product.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is incorrect because a full-length protein cannot be made once a PTC is introduced early.\n- B is unlikely because a stable truncated protein typically appears when the PTC is in the last exon or not sufficiently upstream of a downstream exon–exon junction; here, the PTC is in exon 2 with many downstream junctions, so NMD will dominate.\n- C is incorrect because a frameshift does not yield a single-amino-acid substitution; it changes the reading frame and introduces an early stop.\n- D is incorrect because transcription is unaffected, as stated.\n\nThe most accurate choice is that the mRNA is targeted for degradation and little to no protein is synthesized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1488967"}]}
