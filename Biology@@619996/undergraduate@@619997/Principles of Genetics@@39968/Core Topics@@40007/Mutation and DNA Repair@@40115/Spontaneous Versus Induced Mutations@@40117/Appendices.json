{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise plunges you into the role of a microbial geneticist trying to solve a puzzle. By using mutagens with known mechanisms of action—one causing base-pair substitutions and the other causing frameshifts—you can work backward from the results of a reversion experiment to deduce the original genetic mistake. This practice sharpens your understanding of how different mutagens interact with DNA and how reversion analysis serves as a powerful diagnostic tool in genetics [@problem_id:2081880].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the nature of mutations in an *Escherichia coli* strain. The investigation begins with a wild-type strain, known as a prototroph, which is capable of synthesizing all its required amino acids and can grow on a minimal medium. The microbiologist isolates a mutant derivative of this strain that is an auxotroph for the amino acid arginine. This auxotrophic strain, designated `arg-`, fails to grow on the minimal medium unless it is supplemented with arginine.\n\nTo characterize the genetic basis of this `arg-` phenotype, the microbiologist conducts a reversion experiment. The goal is to see if the `arg-` strain can be mutated back to a prototrophic (`$arg^{+}$`) state. A large population of `arg-` cells is plated onto two different types of agar plates. Both types of plates contain minimal medium, which lacks arginine, meaning only revertant `$arg^{+}$` cells can form colonies.\n\n- **Plate 1** contains the chemical mutagen 2-aminopurine, which is known to act as a base analog.\n- **Plate 2** contains the chemical mutagen proflavin, which is known to act as an intercalating agent.\n\nAfter incubation, a high frequency of `$arg^{+}$` revertant colonies is observed on Plate 1. In contrast, Plate 2 shows a very low frequency of colonies, comparable to the spontaneous reversion rate observed on a control plate with no mutagen.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what was the most probable type of base-pair change that caused the original `arg-` mutation?\n\nA. A transition mutation.\nB. A frameshift mutation.\nC. A transversion mutation.\nD. A large deletion of the gene.\nE. An inversion of a segment of the gene.", "solution": "The experimental design uses selection on minimal medium to allow growth only of revertant $arg^{+}$ cells. The two mutagens applied have distinct, well-characterized mutational spectra:\n\n1. 2-aminopurine is a base analog that substitutes for adenine and can mispair; it predominantly induces transition mutations by causing $A\\!:\\!T \\leftrightarrow G\\!:\\!C$ changes through tautomerization-dependent mispairing. Thus, if the original $arg^{-}$ lesion is a base-pair substitution that can be corrected by a transition, exposure to 2-aminopurine during selection will substantially elevate the frequency of true revertants (or intragenic suppressors that restore function via a compatible transition).\n\n2. Proflavin is an intercalating agent that inserts between base pairs and primarily induces single-base insertions or deletions, i.e., frameshift mutations, especially within homopolymeric runs. Consequently, proflavin strongly elevates the reversion frequency only if the original mutation is itself a frameshift that can be compensated by an opposite frameshift nearby, restoring the reading frame.\n\nThe observations are: a high frequency of $arg^{+}$ revertant colonies on the 2-aminopurine plate, but only a low, near-spontaneous frequency on the proflavin plate. This pattern indicates that the mutation is readily reverted by transitions but not by frameshift events. Therefore, the original $arg^{-}$ change was most probably a base-pair substitution of the transition type.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the data: a frameshift mutation would show elevated reversion with proflavin; a transversion would not be efficiently reverted by 2-aminopurine, which does not predominantly induce transversions; large deletions or inversions would very rarely revert to wild type at high frequency under any mutagen and would not be specifically favored by 2-aminopurine.\n\nHence, the most probable original base-pair change is a transition mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2081880"}, {"introduction": "Next, we move from a basic research question to a critical application in toxicology: safety testing. The Ames test is a cornerstone for screening chemicals for mutagenic potential, which is often correlated with carcinogenicity. This problem asks you to interpret the results of a hypothetical Ames test, including the crucial step of metabolic activation using the S9 mix, teaching you how to draw sound conclusions about a compound's safety based on quantitative data [@problem_id:1522063].", "problem": "A team of genetic toxicologists is evaluating the mutagenic potential of a newly synthesized chemical, designated \"Compound X,\" using the Ames test. The test utilizes a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine (*his-*), meaning it cannot produce its own histidine and will not grow on a minimal medium lacking it. The test measures the frequency of reversion mutations, where a mutation restores the function of the histidine synthesis gene, allowing the bacteria to grow into visible colonies on a histidine-lacking plate.\n\nThe experiment consists of three conditions:\n1.  **Control Plate:** Bacteria are plated on a minimal medium. This plate measures the spontaneous reversion rate.\n2.  **Test Plate A:** Bacteria are plated on a minimal medium containing Compound X. This tests for direct mutagenic activity.\n3.  **Test Plate B:** Bacteria are plated on a minimal medium containing Compound X and a rat liver extract (known as S9 mix). The S9 mix contains metabolic enzymes that can convert non-mutagenic precursor molecules (pro-mutagens) into active mutagens, simulating metabolic processes in mammals.\n\nAfter incubation, the following colony counts were observed:\n-   **Control Plate:** 21 colonies\n-   **Test Plate A:** 24 colonies\n-   **Test Plate B:** 19 colonies\n\nBased on these results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete conclusion about Compound X?\n\nA. Compound X is a potent pro-mutagen, but the enzymes in the S9 mix successfully detoxified it, preventing it from causing mutations.\nB. Compound X is a weak, direct-acting mutagen, as shown by the slight increase in colonies on Test Plate A compared to the control.\nC. The experiment is invalid because the growth of colonies on the control plate indicates a contamination of the minimal medium with histidine.\nD. Compound X is not a direct-acting mutagen, nor is it a pro-mutagen that is activated by the enzymes present in the S9 mix.\nE. Compound X exhibits anti-mutagenic properties, as evidenced by the decrease in colonies on Test Plate B compared to both the control and Test Plate A.", "solution": "The Ames test measures mutagenicity by comparing the number of revertant colonies in treated conditions to a spontaneous background on a minimal medium. Key principles:\n- A his- strain yields a spontaneous reversion count on a control plate; this is expected and does not indicate contamination.\n- A direct-acting mutagen increases revertants relative to control without metabolic activation.\n- A pro-mutagen requires S9 metabolic activation to increase revertants.\n- Conclusions are based on statistically significant increases (often at least a doubling) and/or clear dose-response; small fluctuations consistent with counting noise are not evidence of mutagenicity. Colony counts are well modeled by a Poisson process with variance equal to the mean, so the standard deviation for a mean count $\\lambda$ is $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$.\n\nLet the observed counts be $n_{C}=21$ (control), $n_{A}=24$ (Compound X without S9), and $n_{B}=19$ (Compound X with S9). Consider both ratios and simple Poisson-based deviations from control.\n\nRatios relative to control:\n$$\nr_{A}=\\frac{n_{A}}{n_{C}}=\\frac{24}{21}<2, \\quad r_{B}=\\frac{n_{B}}{n_{C}}=\\frac{19}{21}<1.\n$$\nThere is no doubling in either case, so no strong mutagenic signal.\n\nDifferences from control and their scale relative to Poisson variation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{A}=n_{A}-n_{C}=3, \\quad \\Delta_{B}=n_{B}-n_{C}=-2.\n$$\nUnder a Poisson model, a reasonable estimate of the standard deviation is $\\sigma\\approx\\sqrt{n_{C}}=\\sqrt{21}$. We observe\n$$\n|\\Delta_{A}|=3<\\sqrt{21}, \\quad |\\Delta_{B}|=2<\\sqrt{21},\n$$\nso both differences are well within one standard deviation of the control background, indicating no statistically meaningful change.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: A “potent pro-mutagen” should show increased revertants with S9, not a slight decrease. Moreover, the S9 mix is used to activate pro-mutagens, not specifically to detoxify them in this assay context. Data do not support potency or S9-dependent activation.\n- B: The slight increase on Test Plate A is within expected background variation and far from a doubling; calling this a weak direct-acting mutagen is not justified.\n- C: Control colonies reflect spontaneous reversions; their presence does not imply histidine contamination. The experiment is not invalid on this basis.\n- D: No significant increase with or without S9; thus Compound X is not a direct-acting mutagen and is not activated by S9 under these conditions. This matches the data and test logic.\n- E: A small decrease with S9 does not establish anti-mutagenic properties; anti-mutagenicity is typically inferred by suppression of mutations induced by a known mutagen in co-treatment, which is not tested here, and the decrease is within expected fluctuation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete conclusion is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1522063"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice shifts focus from induced mutations to the spontaneous mutations that are the raw material of evolution.
