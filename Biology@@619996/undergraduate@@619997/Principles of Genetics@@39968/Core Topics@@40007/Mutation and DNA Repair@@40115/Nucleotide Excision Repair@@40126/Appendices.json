{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our genome is constantly under assault, and cells have evolved a sophisticated toolkit of repair systems, each specialized for a different type of damage. A key skill for any geneticist is to diagnose which system has failed based on the type of DNA damage that accumulates. This first practice problem [@problem_id:1506454] challenges you to act like a molecular detective, using experimental evidence from a classic genetic disorder to distinguish a failure in Nucleotide Excision Repair from defects in other major pathways.", "problem": "A clinical geneticist is investigating a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and a predisposition to skin cancer. To understand the molecular basis of the disease in this patient, the geneticist cultures skin fibroblasts from the patient and performs two experiments.\n\nIn the first experiment, the cultured cells are exposed to a dose of UV radiation known to induce the formation of pyrimidine dimers, which are bulky, helix-distorting lesions. The geneticist observes that the patient's cells are unable to efficiently remove these dimers from their DNA.\n\nIn the second experiment, the cells are treated with a mutagen that causes single base-pair mismatches during DNA replication (e.g., a G-T mispairing instead of a correct G-C pair). The geneticist finds that the patient's cells are able to identify and correct these mismatches at a rate comparable to that of cells from a healthy individual.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following general DNA repair systems is most likely deficient in this patient's cells?\n\nA. Mismatch Repair\n\nB. Base Excision Repair\n\nC. Nucleotide Excision Repair\n\nD. Homologous Recombination\n\nE. Non-Homologous End Joining", "solution": "We analyze the lesion types and the corresponding DNA repair pathways to identify the deficient system.\n\nFirst, ultraviolet radiation induces bulky, helix-distorting lesions, specifically pyrimidine dimers such as thymine dimers. The canonical pathway that recognizes and removes bulky DNA adducts that distort the double helix is nucleotide excision repair. The core principles of nucleotide excision repair include damage recognition of helix distortion, dual incisions flanking the lesion on the damaged strand, excision of a short oligonucleotide containing the lesion, gap filling by a DNA polymerase using the undamaged strand as a template, and sealing by DNA ligase. The observation that the patient’s cells are unable to efficiently remove UV-induced pyrimidine dimers directly indicates a defect in nucleotide excision repair.\n\nSecond, the mutagen that induces single base-pair mismatches during DNA replication generates errors such as G-T mispairs. The pathway specialized for recognizing and correcting replication-associated base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops is mismatch repair. The experimental finding that the patient’s cells correct these mismatches at a normal rate indicates that mismatch repair is intact.\n\nTo exclude other pathways: base excision repair primarily handles small, non-bulky base lesions (e.g., deamination, oxidation, alkylation) and abasic sites via glycosylase-mediated base removal, end processing, gap filling, and ligation, and is not primarily responsible for bulky UV photoproducts. Homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are pathways for double-strand break repair and are not implicated by the described experiments. The clinical context of xeroderma pigmentosum classically results from defects in nucleotide excision repair components, consistent with the observed UV sensitivity and failure to remove pyrimidine dimers.\n\nTherefore, the most likely deficient DNA repair system in this patient is nucleotide excision repair.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1506454"}, {"introduction": "Once damage is detected, Nucleotide Excision Repair proceeds like a coordinated assembly line involving a cascade of specialized proteins. This exercise zooms in on a critical player, the TFIIH complex, whose helicase activity is essential for prying open the DNA double helix around the lesion. By analyzing the consequences of a non-functional helicase [@problem_id:2327230], you will gain a deeper understanding of how the 'repair bubble' is formed, a pivotal step that grants other enzymes access to the damaged site.", "problem": "The Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway is a critical cellular mechanism for removing bulky DNA lesions, such as pyrimidine dimers caused by ultraviolet radiation. The process involves several protein complexes that act in a coordinated sequence. A key player in this pathway is Transcription Factor II H (TFIIH), a large multi-subunit complex. For the NER pathway, the helicase activity of TFIIH is essential for locally unwinding the DNA double helix around the site of damage.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell line that harbors a specific mutation. This mutation renders the helicase subunits of the TFIIH complex completely non-functional. However, all other proteins involved in the NER pathway, and all other functional domains of the TFIIH complex itself, are normal. If these mutant cells are exposed to UV radiation, thereby inducing pyrimidine dimers, which of the following statements describes the most direct and immediate consequence of the defective TFIIH helicase during the subsequent attempt at NER?\n\nA. The initial recognition of the pyrimidine dimer by the damage-sensing protein complex will fail.\n\nB. The DNA duplex around the lesion will not be unwound, preventing the formation of a stable, open \"repair bubble\".\n\nC. The phosphodiester backbone of the damaged strand will be incised, but the resulting oligonucleotide fragment containing the lesion will fail to be removed.\n\nD. DNA polymerase will successfully fill the gap created by lesion removal, but DNA ligase will be unable to seal the final nick in the repaired strand.\n\nE. The TFIIH complex will be unable to bind to the DNA at the site of the damage.", "solution": "In eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER), the canonical sequence of events is:\n- Damage recognition by XPC-HR23B in global genome repair (or by a stalled RNA polymerase with CSA/CSB in transcription-coupled repair), which recruits TFIIH.\n- Local DNA unwinding by TFIIH, mediated by its helicase subunits (XPB and XPD), to generate an open repair bubble spanning the lesion.\n- Verification and stabilization of the opened region by XPA and RPA.\n- Dual incision of the damaged strand by structure-specific endonucleases: XPF-ERCC1 on the 5-prime side and XPG on the 3-prime side, excising an oligonucleotide containing the lesion.\n- Gap filling by DNA polymerase and sealing by DNA ligase.\n\nGiven the mutation renders the TFIIH helicase subunits non-functional while all other components are intact, the earliest step that directly depends on helicase activity is the local unwinding of DNA. Recognition (XPC/CSA-CSB) and recruitment of TFIIH can still occur through protein-protein interactions despite loss of helicase activity. However, without TFIIH helicase function, the DNA duplex cannot be unwound to form a stable open repair bubble. Without this bubble, RPA/XPA stabilization and the subsequent endonuclease incisions cannot proceed.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because initial damage recognition does not require TFIIH helicase activity.\n- B is correct: the DNA will not be unwound, preventing formation of the repair bubble.\n- C is incorrect because dual incision requires the opened bubble; it would not proceed without unwinding.\n- D is incorrect because polymerase and ligase steps occur only after successful excision; they would not be reached.\n- E is incorrect because TFIIH binding/recruitment can occur independently of its helicase activity; the defect specifically prevents unwinding, not initial binding.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is failure to unwind the DNA and form the repair bubble.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2327230"}, {"introduction": "After the damaged segment is excised and a new, correct sequence is synthesized by a polymerase, one final action is required to complete the repair. This practice problem [@problem_id:2327238] focuses on that crucial last step: ligation. By exploring a hypothetical scenario where the DNA ligase enzyme is inhibited, you will appreciate its indispensable role as the 'molecular glue' that seals the final nick in the DNA backbone, fully restoring the chromosome's integrity.", "problem": "Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is a crucial DNA repair mechanism that cells use to correct bulky, helix-distorting lesions, such as thymine dimers caused by ultraviolet radiation. The process can be broadly divided into four main stages: (1) recognition of the DNA damage, (2) excision of a short single-stranded segment containing the lesion by nucleases, (3) synthesis of a new DNA segment to fill the gap using the undamaged strand as a template by a DNA polymerase, and (4) ligation of the newly synthesized segment to the existing DNA strand.\n\nConsider a laboratory experiment involving a culture of human cells. These cells are treated with a newly developed chemotherapeutic agent that acts as a highly specific and potent inhibitor of the enzyme DNA ligase. All other cellular machinery, including the enzymes required for the first three stages of NER, remain fully functional. Subsequently, the cell culture is exposed to a brief pulse of UV light, inducing the formation of a thymine dimer in the DNA of one cell. The NER pathway is immediately initiated to repair this damage.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the final state of the DNA molecule at the site of the thymine dimer after the other functional NER enzymes have completed their respective tasks?\n\nA. The DNA molecule is completely restored to its original, undamaged state with the thymine dimer successfully replaced and the backbone sealed.\n\nB. The thymine dimer remains in the DNA strand because the repair pathway is stalled at the very first step due to feedback inhibition from the non-functional ligase.\n\nC. The segment containing the thymine dimer is removed and the resulting gap is filled with new, correct nucleotides, but this new segment is not covalently joined to the original DNA strand at one end.\n\nD. The segment containing the thymine dimer is successfully removed by nucleases, but the resulting gap remains empty and single-stranded.\n\nE. The recognition of the unligated segment triggers a cellular apoptosis signal, leading to the complete degradation of the entire chromosome.", "solution": "The NER pathway consists of four ordered activities: damage recognition, dual incision and removal of a short single-stranded oligomer containing the lesion, gap filling DNA synthesis templated by the undamaged strand, and ligation to seal the final nick in the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\nGiven the stated conditions, proceed step by step:\n\n1) Recognition: UV exposure produces a thymine dimer. NER damage recognition proteins detect the helix-distorting lesion. This step does not require DNA ligase, so recognition proceeds normally.\n\n2) Excision: Structure-specific endonucleases execute dual incisions flanking the lesion, removing a short oligonucleotide that contains the thymine dimer. The excision generates a gap with a free $3^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl at the upstream end and a $5^{\\prime}$-phosphate at the downstream end. These chemical end groups are the canonical substrates for subsequent synthesis and ligation.\n\n3) Gap filling synthesis: A DNA polymerase uses the intact complementary strand as a template and extends from the available $3^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl, incorporating correct deoxyribonucleotides to replace the excised segment. Because the polymerase and associated factors are functional, the base sequence across the gap is restored by templated synthesis. After this step, the only discontinuity remaining is a single-strand break (a nick) between the $3^{\\prime}$ end of the newly synthesized patch and the adjacent $5^{\\prime}$ phosphate of the pre-existing DNA downstream (or, depending on directionality, between the patch and upstream DNA), i.e., there is one missing phosphodiester bond.\n\n4) Ligation: DNA ligase catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation between a $3^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl and an adjacent $5^{\\prime}$-phosphate, using ATP, schematically:\n$$\n3^{\\prime}\\text{-OH} + 5^{\\prime}\\text{-P} \\xrightarrow{\\text{DNA ligase, ATP}} \\text{phosphodiester bond}.\n$$\nBecause the chemotherapeutic agent specifically inhibits DNA ligase, this reaction cannot occur. Consequently, the nick remains unsealed: the bases are correctly replaced and base-paired, but the sugar-phosphate backbone is not covalently continuous at one end of the repaired patch.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because ligation is required to seal the backbone, and ligase is inhibited.\n- B is incorrect because NER initiation does not require ligase, and there is no stated feedback preventing recognition.\n- C correctly states that the damaged segment is removed, the gap is filled by polymerase, but the new segment is not covalently joined at one end (a persistent nick).\n- D is incorrect because polymerase function is intact, so the gap does not remain empty.\n- E is not an immediate deterministic consequence of an unligated nick and overstates the outcome relative to the described immediate NER events.\n\nTherefore, the final state is a repaired sequence with an unsealed nick at one end of the newly synthesized patch.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2327238"}]}
