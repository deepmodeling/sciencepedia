This first practice challenges you to interpret a classic positive result, where a test compound causes a dramatic increase in revertant colonies compared to a control. Mastering this fundamental analysis is the first step toward using the Ames test for genetic toxicology screening [@problem_id:1525594].", "problem": "A biotechnologist is evaluating the potential mutagenicity of a newly synthesized water-soluble compound, \"Compound Alpha,\" intended for use as an agricultural fungicide. The assessment is conducted using the Ames test. The test utilizes a specialized strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine (genotype `$his^-$`), meaning it cannot synthesize histidine and requires it in the growth medium to survive.\n\nTwo types of agar plates are prepared, both containing a minimal medium that lacks histidine. A standard, high concentration of the `$his^-$` bacterial cells is spread evenly across the surface of each plate.\n\n*   **Plate 1 (Control):** This plate contains only the minimal medium and the bacterial lawn. It serves to measure the spontaneous reversion rate from `$his^-$` to the wild-type `$his^+$` phenotype.\n*   **Plate 2 (Test):** This plate is identical to the control, but a small, sterile paper disk saturated with a solution of Compound Alpha is placed in the center of the bacterial lawn.\n\nAfter a 48-hour incubation period, the plates are examined. The biotechnologist observes that only bacteria that have undergone a reverse mutation (a reversion) to `$his^+$` are able to grow and form visible colonies. The results are as follows:\n\n*   Plate 1 (Control) shows 34 colonies.\n*   Plate 2 (Test) shows approximately 1,150 colonies, with the highest density of colonies forming a ring around the paper disk.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. The spontaneous mutation rate of the *Salmonella* strain from `$his^-$` to `$his^+$` is approximately 1,150 events per plate.\n\nB. Compound Alpha is not mutagenic, and the high number of colonies on Plate 2 is likely due to bacterial contamination.\n\nC. The experiment is inconclusive because it did not include a component for metabolic activation, such as a liver extract.\n\nD. Compound Alpha is a mutagen that directly increases the rate of reversion from `$his^-$` to `$his^+$` in *Salmonella typhimurium*.\n\nE. The `$his^-$` *Salmonella* strain is naturally resistant to the effects of Compound Alpha, allowing it to grow on the test plate.", "solution": "Principle of the Ames test: A strain of bacteria auxotrophic for histidine, denoted $his^-$, cannot grow on minimal medium lacking histidine. Only cells that undergo a reverse mutation restoring function to $his^+$ can form colonies. Therefore, on minimal medium plates without histidine, each colony corresponds to at least one reversion event to $his^+$.\n\nControl plate interpretation: The control plate, without Compound Alpha, establishes the baseline number of spontaneous revertants. The observed 34 colonies reflect the spontaneous reversion events expected under these conditions.\n\nTest plate interpretation: The test plate contains a disk with Compound Alpha. A markedly higher number of colonies (approximately 1,150) indicates that, in the presence of Compound Alpha, the frequency of reversion to $his^+$ is greatly increased relative to the spontaneous baseline. The formation of a ring with highest colony density around the disk is characteristic of a diffusible mutagen producing a concentration gradient: very high concentrations near the disk can be cytotoxic (suppressing colony formation), with an annulus at intermediate concentrations maximizing mutagenic events and, at greater distances, concentrations too low to significantly elevate reversion rates. This spatial pattern is a classic positive result in the Ames test for a direct-acting mutagen.\n\nEvaluation of answer choices:\n- A is incorrect because the spontaneous mutation rate is reflected by the control plate (34 colonies), not the test plate with Compound Alpha.\n- B is unlikely: contamination on minimal medium lacking histidine would not produce growth of $his^-$ cells, and contamination typically causes confluent growth or random distribution, not a ring pattern centered on the compound disk.\n- C is incorrect: while metabolic activation (e.g., liver S9) is useful to detect pro-mutagens, a strong positive result without S9 indicates direct mutagenicity in bacteria. Lack of S9 may cause false negatives for pro-mutagens but does not invalidate a clear positive result.\n- D is correct: the data show that Compound Alpha increases the reversion rate from $his^-$ to $his^+$ in Salmonella typhimurium, consistent with a direct-acting mutagen.\n- E is incorrect: “resistance” is irrelevant here; $his^-$ strains cannot grow on minimal medium unless they revert to $his^+$, so the observed colonies must be revertants, not resistant $his^-$ cells.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Compound Alpha is a mutagen that directly increases the reversion rate to $his^+$ in Salmonella typhimurium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1525594"}, {"introduction": "Identifying a substance as mutagenic is critical, but for risk assessment, we often need to know *how* mutagenic it is. This exercise moves beyond a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer, asking you to quantify and compare the potencies of two different compounds. By learning to isolate the number of induced mutations from the background spontaneous rate, you will develop a crucial skill for ranking chemical hazards [@problem_id:1525538].", "problem": "A research laboratory is conducting a toxicological screening of two novel chemical compounds, designated Compound A and Compound B, to assess their potential mutagenicity using the Ames test. The Ames test utilizes a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine; it cannot synthesize its own histidine and requires it in the growth medium to survive. Mutagenic chemicals can cause a reverse mutation (reversion) in this strain, restoring its ability to synthesize histidine (a state known as prototrophy) and thus allowing it to grow and form colonies on a histidine-lacking medium.\n\nIn the experiment, three conditions were tested:\n1.  **Control:** The *Salmonella* strain was plated on a histidine-lacking medium with only the solvent used to dissolve the compounds. This plate serves to measure the rate of spontaneous reversion. An average of 20 revertant colonies were observed.\n2.  **Compound A:** The *Salmonella* strain was plated on a histidine-lacking medium with Compound A added at a specific concentration. An average of 50 revertant colonies were observed.\n3.  **Compound B:** The *Salmonella* strain was plated on a histidine-lacking medium with Compound B added at the same concentration as Compound A. An average of 500 revertant colonies were observed.\n\nThe total number of revertant colonies observed in the presence of a test chemical is the sum of spontaneous reversions and reversions induced by the chemical. Based on these results, calculate the relative mutagenic strength of Compound B compared to Compound A. This is defined as the ratio of the number of mutations induced by Compound B to the number of mutations induced by Compound A.", "solution": "In the Ames test, the observed total number of revertant colonies with a test compound equals the sum of spontaneous reversions and chemically induced reversions. Let $S$ denote spontaneous reversions (control), and let $T_{A}$ and $T_{B}$ denote the total revertants observed with Compound A and Compound B, respectively. Let $I_{A}$ and $I_{B}$ denote the induced mutations for A and B. The governing relation is\n$$\nT_{X} = S + I_{X},\n$$\nfor $X \\in \\{A,B\\}$, hence\n$$\nI_{X} = T_{X} - S.\n$$\nFrom the data, $S=20$, $T_{A}=50$, and $T_{B}=500$. Therefore,\n$$\nI_{A} = 50 - 20 = 30,\\quad I_{B} = 500 - 20 = 480.\n$$\nThe relative mutagenic strength of Compound B compared to Compound A is defined as the ratio\n$$\nR = \\frac{I_{B}}{I_{A}} = \\frac{480}{30} = 16.\n$$\nThus, Compound B induces 16 times as many mutations as Compound A under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1525538"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, chemicals rarely have a single, clean effect; some are both mutagenic and toxic to the test organisms. This advanced practice presents a scenario where a compound creates a 'zone of inhibition,' a clear area where bacteria cannot grow due to toxicity. Your task is to untangle the evidence for toxicity from the evidence for mutagenicity, a key skill for interpreting complex toxicological data and avoiding mischaracterization of a substance's effects [@problem_id:1525591].", "problem": "A researcher is conducting an Ames test to evaluate the properties of a novel chemical, designated Compound Y. The test utilizes a strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is auxotrophic for histidine ($his^-$), meaning it cannot synthesize this essential amino acid. A sterile filter paper disc is saturated with a solution of Compound Y and placed at the center of a petri dish. The dish contains a minimal agar medium, which lacks histidine but is supplemented with a trace amount, just enough to permit the initial bacterial population to undergo a few rounds of cell division. The plate is then incubated under appropriate conditions.\n\nAfter incubation, the researcher observes two key features. First, there is a distinct, clear, circular zone immediately surrounding the filter paper disc. Within this zone, no bacterial growth of any kind is visible; the faint, uniform \"background lawn\" of `$his^-$` bacteria seen on the rest of the plate is completely absent. Second, in the area just outside this clear zone, the density of revertant (`$his^+$`) colonies is approximately the same as the density of spontaneous revertant colonies observed on a negative control plate (which was treated with a sterile solvent).\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of Compound Y's primary effect at the high concentration found near the disc?\n\nA. Compound Y is a potent mutagen that also requires a high cell density to induce reversion, a condition not met near the disc.\n\nB. Compound Y is strongly bacteriostatic, arresting cell division and thus preventing the formation of both the background lawn and revertant colonies.\n\nC. Compound Y is strongly bactericidal, creating a zone of lethality that kills the bacteria before they can divide or undergo reversion.\n\nD. Compound Y specifically interferes with the DNA repair mechanisms that lead to reversion, but it does not otherwise affect bacterial viability.\n\nE. The test is flawed because the trace amount of histidine was degraded by Compound Y, preventing any bacterial growth in its vicinity.", "solution": "The Ames test uses a $his^-$ strain of Salmonella that cannot grow on minimal medium without histidine. A trace amount of histidine is added so that the $his^-$ bacteria can undergo a few rounds of division; during these early divisions, spontaneous or chemically induced mutations can generate $his^+$ revertants, which then form visible colonies on the histidine-free background. Therefore:\n- A mutagen increases the number of $his^+$ revertant colonies above the spontaneous baseline.\n- A toxic compound at high concentration produces a zone of inhibition around the disc where the bacterial population cannot generate the initial background lawn or revertants.\n\nIn the observation:\n1) There is a distinct, clear, circular zone immediately surrounding the disc with no visible bacterial growth at all. This indicates that at the high local concentration near the disc, Compound Y prevents any detectable growth. A crisp, completely clear zone in a disc-diffusion context is classically interpreted as a bactericidal effect, meaning cells are killed before they can undergo even the initial divisions permitted by the trace histidine, thereby preventing both the faint background lawn and any revertant colonies.\n\n2) Just outside this clear zone, the density of revertant colonies is approximately equal to the spontaneous revertant density on the negative control. This indicates Compound Y does not increase mutation (i.e., is not detectably mutagenic) at concentrations compatible with growth.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because no increase in revertants is observed even where bacteria do grow; invoking a requirement for high cell density does not explain the completely clear lethal zone nor the lack of mutagenic signal outside it.\n- B is less accurate than C: while a bacteriostatic agent could prevent visible growth, a distinct, clear zone with complete absence of growth most directly supports bactericidal action at high concentration in standard disc-diffusion interpretations.\n- C best matches the observed clear zone: high concentrations are bactericidal, producing a zone where bacteria are killed before division or reversion.\n- D is incorrect because specific interference with repair without affecting viability would not eliminate the background lawn; viability is clearly compromised near the disc.\n- E is unlikely and unnecessary to explain the results; histidine degradation is not required to account for a standard zone of inhibition, and the pattern outside the zone shows no mutagenic effect rather than a methodological failure.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation of Compound Y’s primary effect at high concentration near the disc is that it is strongly bactericidal, creating a lethal zone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1525591"}]}
