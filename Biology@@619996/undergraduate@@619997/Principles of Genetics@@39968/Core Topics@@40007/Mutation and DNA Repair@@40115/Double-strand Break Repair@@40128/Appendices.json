When faced with a dangerous double-strand break (DSB), a cell must choose between two primary toolkits: the quick and direct Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or the precise, template-guided Homologous Recombination (HR). This exercise [@problem_id:1484595] challenges you to predict which pathway dominates in a specific cellular context—the G1 phase of the cell cycle—forcing you to connect the molecular requirements of each pathway to the physical state of the cell's chromosomes.", "problem": "A research team is investigating the mechanisms of genome integrity in the diploid budding yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. In their experiment, they use a chemical agent to synchronize a population of yeast cells, arresting them in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Subsequently, they expose the synchronized culture to a low dose of ionizing radiation, which is known to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cells have two major pathways for repairing DSBs:\n1.  **Homologous Recombination (HR)**: A high-fidelity pathway that uses an undamaged, homologous DNA sequence as a template to accurately repair the break. The ideal template for this process is an identical sister chromatid.\n2.  **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**: A pathway that directly processes and ligates the two broken DNA ends back together without the need for a template. This process is often error-prone, potentially leading to small insertions or deletions at the break site.\n\nGiven that the cells are arrested in the G1 phase, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the dominant repair pathway that will be utilized and provides the correct underlying reason?\n\nA. Homologous Recombination (HR) will be dominant because it is the most accurate repair mechanism, and the cell will prioritize error-free repair above all else.\n\nB. Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) will be dominant because the enzymes responsible for HR are transcriptionally repressed during the G1 phase.\n\nC. Both pathways will be equally active to ensure the rapid repair of potentially lethal DNA damage, maximizing cell survival.\n\nD. Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) will be dominant because sister chromatids are not available to serve as templates for repair prior to DNA replication.\n\nE. Homologous Recombination (HR) will be dominant because the yeast cell is diploid, and the homologous chromosome can serve as a readily available template for repair.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which major Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair pathway, Homologous Recombination (HR) or Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), will be predominantly active in a yeast cell during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the state of the cell's genetic material in the G1 phase. The cell cycle consists of four main phases: G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), G2 (Gap 2), and M (Mitosis). The G1 phase occurs before DNA replication (S phase). During G1, each chromosome in the nucleus consists of a single DNA molecule, also known as a chromatid. Only after the S phase, when the DNA has been replicated, does each chromosome consist of two identical sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The cell remains in this duplicated state through G2 and the beginning of M phase.\n\nNext, let's consider the requirements of the two repair pathways.\nHomologous Recombination (HR) is a high-fidelity repair system that requires a template to restore the original DNA sequence at the break site. The most effective and preferred template is the identical sister chromatid, which is present immediately adjacent to the break. While a diploid organism like the yeast in this problem also has homologous chromosomes (one inherited from each parent), using them as a template for HR is much less efficient and is generally suppressed to avoid potential genetic rearrangements or loss of heterozygosity. The primary mechanism of HR relies on the sister chromatid.\n\nNon-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) functions by directly ligating the broken ends of the DNA. This pathway does not require a template. Because of this, NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle. Its main drawback is its propensity for errors, as the processing of the DNA ends before ligation can result in small insertions or deletions (indels).\n\nNow, we can synthesize this information to determine the predominant pathway in G1. Since the cells are in the G1 phase, DNA replication has not yet occurred. This means there are no sister chromatids available in the cell. The absence of this preferred template severely restricts the activity of the HR pathway. The machinery for NHEJ, however, is available and does not require a template, making it the primary and most active pathway for repairing DSBs during G1. The cell must use NHEJ to repair the damage and survive, accepting the risk of minor mutations. If the break occurred in S or G2, the presence of a sister chromatid would make HR the dominant pathway.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect. While HR is the most accurate pathway, it is functionally unavailable in G1 due to the lack of a sister chromatid template.\n- B is incorrect. While there is cell cycle regulation of HR proteins, the primary limiting factor in G1 is the physical absence of the sister chromatid template, not just the absence of the enzymes.\n- C is incorrect. The choice of repair pathway is not random or equal; it is tightly regulated by the cell cycle and the availability of the required components.\n- D is correct. It accurately states that NHEJ will be dominant and provides the correct fundamental reason: the absence of sister chromatids before DNA replication makes the primary HR pathway non-functional.\n- E is incorrect. Although a homologous chromosome is present in a diploid cell, it is not the preferred template for HR. Sister chromatid-templated repair is far more efficient and is the mechanism that dominates when available (in S/G2). Relying on the homologous chromosome is a much less frequent event. Therefore, its presence in G1 does not make HR the dominant pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1484595"}, {"introduction": "Having established that pathway choice is context-dependent, we now explore the stark consequences when a critical repair tool is missing. Homologous Recombination relies on a team of proteins, with the recombinase RAD51 playing an indispensable role. This practice [@problem_id:1484630] asks you to predict the outcome for a cell line engineered to lack functional RAD51, linking a specific molecular defect directly to a large-scale, observable phenotype: survival after DNA damage. This will solidify your understanding of why the high-fidelity HR pathway is so crucial for cellular viability.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most dangerous forms of DNA damage. They can be induced by agents such as ionizing radiation. To maintain genomic integrity, cells have evolved two major pathways to repair DSBs:\n\n1.  **Homologous Recombination (HR):** This is a high-fidelity repair process that uses an undamaged homologous DNA sequence, typically the sister chromatid, as a template to accurately restore the original sequence at the break site. This pathway is most active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. A central protein in this pathway is RAD51, a recombinase that is absolutely essential for searching for the homologous template and facilitating strand invasion.\n\n2.  **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ):** This is a more rapid repair process that directly ligates the two broken DNA ends together. While fast, this pathway is error-prone and frequently results in small insertions or deletions of base pairs at the junction site. NHEJ can operate throughout the entire cell cycle.\n\nA researcher is studying two human cell lines.\n- **Cell Line WT:** This is a wild-type cell line with fully functional HR and NHEJ pathways.\n- **Cell Line MUT:** This cell line is genetically identical to Cell Line WT, except that it carries a mutation rendering the RAD51 protein completely non-functional. All other cellular proteins, including those required for NHEJ, are normal.\n\nBoth cell lines are cultured under identical conditions and exposed to a single, identical dose of ionizing radiation. Following the exposure, the researcher measures the fraction of surviving cells for each line to determine their relative sensitivity. Based on the roles of the repair pathways described, which of the following outcomes is the most likely?\n\nA. Cell Line MUT will be significantly more sensitive to the radiation than Cell Line WT.\n\nB. Cell Line MUT will be significantly more resistant (less sensitive) to the radiation than Cell Line WT.\n\nC. There will be no discernible difference in radiation sensitivity between Cell Line WT and Cell Line MUT.\n\nD. Cell Line MUT will be more resistant than Cell Line WT, because the error-prone NHEJ pathway is more efficient at promoting cell survival than the slower HR pathway.\n\nE. Cell Line MUT's sensitivity will be identical to Cell Line WT's, but it will accumulate mutations at a higher rate.", "solution": "We analyze double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway function and its consequences for cell survival after ionizing radiation.\n\nPrinciple 1: Ionizing radiation induces a number of DSBs, denoted $N_{\\text{DSB}}$, in both cell lines under identical exposure. Thus, the initial damage burden is equivalent in Cell Line WT and Cell Line MUT.\n\nPrinciple 2: DSB repair pathways and outcomes.\n- Homologous recombination (HR) is high-fidelity and uses a homologous template. RAD51 is essential for HR; without functional RAD51, HR is effectively abolished. HR is primarily active in S and G2 phases.\n- Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is template-independent, fast, and error-prone. It operates throughout the cell cycle.\n\nDefine the following symbolic quantities for a single DSB in a given cell-cycle context:\n- $p_{\\text{HR}}$: probability that HR correctly repairs the break when HR is available and appropriate (S/G2).\n- $p_{\\text{NHEJ}}$: probability that NHEJ repairs the break in a manner compatible with survival.\n- $q_{\\text{mis}}$: probability that a repair attempt yields a lethal misrepair (e.g., large deletion, translocation) or that the break remains unrepaired and lethal.\nThese probabilities satisfy, for a given DSB, that the sum of mutually exclusive outcomes is $1$.\n\nIn WT cells:\n- In G1, repair uses NHEJ with survival-compatible probability $p_{\\text{NHEJ}}^{\\text{G1}}$.\n- In S/G2, HR is available and high-fidelity, contributing a survival-compatible probability $p_{\\text{HR}}$, and NHEJ may also contribute when chosen, with probability $p_{\\text{NHEJ}}^{\\text{S/G2}}$.\nEmpirically and mechanistically, HR reduces lethal outcomes relative to NHEJ in S/G2, implying\n$$\np_{\\text{HR}} > p_{\\text{NHEJ}}^{\\text{S/G2}},\n$$\nand consequently the lethal-probability per DSB in S/G2 is lower when HR is available:\n$$\nq_{\\text{mis}}^{\\text{WT,S/G2}}  q_{\\text{mis}}^{\\text{NHEJ-only,S/G2}}.\n$$\n\nIn MUT cells (RAD51 non-functional):\n- HR is unavailable in all phases. All DSBs, including those arising in S/G2 where HR would normally act, are processed by NHEJ or related end-joining. Moreover, resection initiated in S/G2 without RAD51-mediated strand invasion can generate toxic intermediates that are poor substrates for classical NHEJ, further increasing $q_{\\text{mis}}$ and unrepaired outcomes.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{S/G2}}$ denote the fraction of DSBs arising or persisting into S/G2.

This final practice moves into a more advanced scenario to explore how the repair process itself can alter the genetic makeup of future cell generations. By analyzing a specific, but biologically relevant, case of Homologous Recombination in a heterozygous ($B/b$) cell, you will trace the flow of genetic information through DNA repair and mitosis. This exercise [@problem_id:1484603] provides a hands-on look at the molecular basis of \"Loss of Heterozygosity\" (LOH), a phenomenon with significant implications in fields like cancer genetics.", "problem": "Consider a single somatic cell from a diploid organism that is heterozygous for a gene controlling pigment production. The allele $B$ results in a functional enzyme leading to blue pigment, while the allele $b$ is non-functional, leading to a lack of pigment (white). The cell, with genotype $B/b$, is in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. A single Double-Strand Break (DSB) occurs within the coding region of this gene on one of the four chromatids present. The cell repairs this break via homologous recombination. Unusually, but as a known biological phenomenon, the repair machinery uses a chromatid from the homologous chromosome as the template for repair, rather than the identical sister chromatid. Assuming the repair process is completed flawlessly and the cell subsequently undergoes a normal mitotic division, which of the following genotypes could be found in the resulting two daughter cells?\n\nSelect all that apply.\n\nA. $B/B$ (homozygous dominant)\n\nB. $B/b$ (heterozygous)\n\nC. $b/b$ (homozygous recessive)\n\nD. $B/B/b$ (aneuploid)\n\nE. $B/0$ (hemizygous)", "solution": "The problem asks for the possible genotypes of daughter cells following a specific Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair event in a heterozygous ($B/b$) parent cell.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genetic state of the cell when the break occurs. The cell is in the G2 phase, which means DNA replication has already occurred during the preceding S phase. The original diploid cell had one chromosome with the $B$ allele and one homologous chromosome with the $b$ allele. After replication, the cell contains two pairs of sister chromatids. One pair consists of two chromatids both carrying the $B$ allele, and the other pair consists of two chromatids both carrying the $b$ allele. Therefore, the total genetic content for this gene in the G2 nucleus is four copies: $B, B, b, b$.\n\nA single DSB occurs on one of these four chromatids. There are two possible scenarios for which chromatid is broken: a chromatid carrying the $B$ allele or a chromatid carrying the $b$ allele. The problem states that the repair occurs via homologous recombination using a chromatid from the *homologous chromosome* as a template.\n\n**Scenario 1: The DSB occurs on a chromatid carrying the $B$ allele.**\n\nThe initial state of the chromatids is ($B_1, B_2, b_1, b_2$), where the subscripts denote sister chromatids. Let's say the break happens on chromatid $B_1$. According to the problem, the template for repair is a chromatid from the homologous chromosome, which carries the $b$ allele (either $b_1$ or $b_2$).\n\nDuring homologous recombination, the broken ends of $B_1$ are processed, and one end invades the homologous template ($b_1$, for instance). New DNA is synthesized using the $b$ allele's sequence as the template. This process, known as gene conversion, effectively copies the information from the template chromatid to the broken chromatid. Consequently, the original $B$ allele on the broken chromatid is replaced by a $b$ allele. After repair, the chromatid that was originally $B_1$ is now a $b$ chromatid.\n\nThe set of four chromatids in the cell before mitosis is now ($B_2, B_1', b_1, b_2$), where $B_1'$ is the repaired chromatid that now carries the $b$ allele. The total genetic content is effectively $B, b, b, b$.\n\nThe cell now proceeds to mitosis. During anaphase, sister chromatids separate.\n- The undamaged homologous pair consists of two sister chromatids, $b_1$ and $b_2$. One ($b_1$) will go to one daughter cell, and the other ($b_2$) will go to the second daughter cell.\n- The homologous pair that experienced the break now consists of one chromatid with the $B$ allele ($B_2$) and one chromatid with the $b$ allele ($B_1'$). These will also segregate to opposite poles. One daughter cell will receive $B_2$ and the other will receive $B_1'$.\n\nLet's trace the segregation to the two daughter cells:\n- Daughter Cell 1 receives: chromatid $b_1$ and chromatid $B_2$. Its resulting diploid genotype is $B/b$.\n- Daughter Cell 2 receives: chromatid $b_2$ and chromatid $B_1'$ (which is now $b$). Its resulting diploid genotype is $b/b$.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the two daughter cells have genotypes $B/b$ and $b/b$. This means homozygous recessive ($b/b$) and heterozygous ($B/b$) are possible outcomes.\n\n**Scenario 2: The DSB occurs on a chromatid carrying the $b$ allele.**\n\nLet's say the break happens on chromatid $b_1$. The repair template is a chromatid from the homologous chromosome, which carries the $B$ allele ($B_1$ or $B_2$).\n\nThrough gene conversion, the $b$ allele on the broken chromatid is replaced by a $B$ allele, copied from the template. The chromatid that was originally $b_1$ is now a $B$ chromatid.\n\nThe set of four chromatids in the cell before mitosis is now ($B_1, B_2, b_1', b_2$), where $b_1'$ is the repaired chromatid that now carries the $B$ allele. The total genetic content is effectively $B, B, B, b$.\n\nThe cell now proceeds to mitosis.\n- The undamaged homologous pair consists of two sister chromatids, $B_1$ and $B_2$. One ($B_1$) will go to one daughter cell, and the other ($B_2$) will go to the second daughter cell.\n- The homologous pair that experienced the break now consists of one chromatid with the $B$ allele ($b_1'$) and one chromatid with the $b$ allele ($b_2$).

Its resulting diploid genotype is $B/b$.\n- Daughter Cell 2 receives: chromatid $B_2$ and chromatid $b_1'$ (which is now $B$). Its resulting diploid genotype is $B/B$.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the two daughter cells have genotypes $B/b$ and $B/B$. This means heterozygous ($B/b$) and homozygous dominant ($B/B$) are possible outcomes.\n\nCombining the outcomes of both scenarios, the possible genotypes that can appear in the daughter cells are $B/B$, $B/b$, and $b/b$. This process, where a heterozygous cell gives rise to a homozygous daughter cell, is a mechanism for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The options $D$ and $E$ correspond to aneuploidy and chromosome loss, respectively, which would result from errors in mitotic segregation (nondisjunction or anaphase lag), not from the specified flawless repair and normal mitosis.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are all possible genotypes for the daughter cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "1484603"}]}
