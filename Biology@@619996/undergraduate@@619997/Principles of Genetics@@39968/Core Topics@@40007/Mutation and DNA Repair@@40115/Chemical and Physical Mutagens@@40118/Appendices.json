{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding mutagenesis begins at the molecular level. This exercise walks you through the step-by-step process of how a common chemical mutagen, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), creates a specific DNA lesion and how cellular replication machinery then converts this damage into a permanent, heritable point mutation. By tracing this pathway, you will gain a concrete understanding of how G:C to A:T transitions, a classic mutation type, arise from chemical exposure [@problem_id:1474238].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a critical enzyme and wants to investigate the function of a specific amino acid, aspartic acid, at a particular position. The codon for this aspartic acid on the coding strand of the gene is $5'$-GAC-$3'$. The researcher decides to induce mutations using the chemical agent Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). EMS is an alkylating agent known to primarily add an ethyl group to the O-6 position of guanine residues. This chemical modification alters the hydrogen-bonding properties of guanine, causing it to preferentially base-pair with thymine instead of its normal partner, cytosine, during DNA replication.\n\nAssume a single, successful alkylation event occurs on the guanine base of the specified $5'$-GAC-$3'$ codon on the coding strand. Following this event, the cell undergoes two complete and error-free rounds of DNA replication. What will be the final sequence of this specific codon on the coding strand in the resulting mutated DNA molecule? Express your answer as a three-letter sequence in the $5'$ to $3'$ direction.", "solution": "We begin with the original double-stranded DNA at the codon, where the coding (sense) strand is $5'$-GAC-$3'$ and the template (antisense) strand is $3'$-CTG-$5'$, consistent with Watson-Crick base pairing (G with C, A with T, C with G).\n\nEthyl methanesulfonate (EMS) alkylates the O-6 position of guanine on the coding strand, converting that guanine to an O-6-ethylguanine (denote it as G*). This modification alters pairing specificity so that, during replication, G* preferentially pairs with T instead of C.\n\nRound 1 of replication:\n- When the damaged coding strand $5'$-G*AC-$3'$ is used as template, the polymerase incorporates T opposite G*, and normal pairing for the remaining bases yields a newly synthesized complementary strand $3'$-TTG-$5'$.\n- When the undamaged template strand $3'$-CTG-$5'$ is used as template, normal pairing yields a newly synthesized coding strand $5'$-GAC-$3'$.\n\nThus, after the first round, one daughter duplex contains a T opposite the lesion (mismatch relative to the original), and the other daughter duplex remains unchanged at this site.\n\nRound 2 of replication:\n- Replicating the strand that contains T at this position ($3'$-TTG-$5'$ as template) produces a new strand with A opposite T, yielding a daughter strand $5'$-AAC-$3'$.\n- Replicating the damaged strand again continues to place T opposite G*, but in the complementary branch where the T-containing strand serves as template, the A:T pair becomes fixed. This is the canonical fixation of a GC to AT transition caused by EMS.\n\nThe final, stably inherited mutation after two error-free rounds is therefore a G:C to A:T transition at the first position of the codon on the coding strand, changing $5'$-GAC-$3'$ to $5'$-AAC-$3'$.\n\nHence, the final sequence of the codon on the coding strand in the mutated DNA molecule is AAC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AAC}$$", "id": "1474238"}, {"introduction": "Not all mutations are simple base substitutions. Intercalating agents like proflavin work by inserting themselves between the 'rungs' of the DNA ladder, causing insertions or deletions that disrupt the genetic reading frame. This practice explores the profound consequences of such frameshift mutations and introduces the elegant concept of intragenic suppression, where a second mutation in the same gene can restore function by correcting the reading frame [@problem_id:1474259]. This thought experiment is rooted in classic genetic discoveries that first illuminated the triplet nature of the genetic code.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a bacterial gene, *cryP*, which encodes a protein essential for the formation of a crystalline toxin. Wild-type bacteria containing the *cryP* gene produce visible intracellular crystals. To study the gene's function, the biologist treats a culture of the wild-type bacteria with proflavin, a chemical mutagen known to act as an intercalating agent, causing the insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide base pair.\n\nFrom this treated culture, a mutant strain is isolated that fails to produce any crystals, indicating a complete loss of function of the CryP protein. This mutant strain is then sub-cultured for many generations, allowing for the accumulation of spontaneous mutations. The biologist screens this large population and successfully isolates a rare \"revertant\" colony that has regained the ability to produce crystals, although the crystals are noted to be smaller and less abundant than in the wild-type strain.\n\nUpon sequencing the *cryP* gene from this revertant strain, the biologist confirms that the original proflavin-induced mutation is still present. However, a new, single-point mutation has occurred at a different location (a \"second site\") within the coding region of the same *cryP* gene.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular description for this second-site suppressor mutation?\n\nA. A base pair substitution that creates a new, functional start codon (AUG) just downstream of the original mutation.\n\nB. A precise and exact deletion of the single base pair that was originally inserted by the proflavin.\n\nC. A deletion of a single base pair located a short distance away from the site of the original mutation.\n\nD. A base pair substitution that converts a premature stop codon, generated by the first mutation, back into a codon for an amino acid.\n\nE. The insertion of exactly two new base pairs adjacent to the site of the original mutation.", "solution": "The core physical principle is the reading frame of translation, which is defined by grouping mRNA bases into codons of length $3$. An intercalating agent like proflavin induces single base pair insertions or deletions that cause frameshift mutations. A frameshift changes the grouping of all downstream codons, often resulting in many incorrect amino acids and premature stop codons, typically causing loss of function.\n\nStep 1: Identify the nature of the first mutation. Proflavin commonly induces a $+1$ (insertion) or $-1$ (deletion) frameshift. The mutant shows complete loss of function, consistent with a frameshift in the coding region.\n\nStep 2: Interpret the revertant data. The revertant regains function partially (smaller, less abundant crystals), and sequencing shows the original proflavin-induced mutation is still present. Therefore, the second-site change did not revert the original mutation; instead, it must be a suppressor that compensates for its effect.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principle of intragenic suppression of frameshifts. A second frameshift of the opposite sign can restore the original reading frame downstream if the net shift is $0$ modulo $3$:\n- If the original change is $+1$, then a $-1$ elsewhere yields $(+1)+(-1)=0$ modulo $3$, restoring the reading frame downstream of the second site.\n- Conversely, if the original change is $-1$, then a $+1$ elsewhere yields $(-1)+(+1)=0$ modulo $3$.\nThis restoration produces a protein with an internal stretch of incorrect amino acids between the two sites but correct sequence downstream, explaining partial function.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each option against these principles and the sequencing result.\n- A: Creating a new start codon downstream would bypass the frameshift by reinitiating translation, but internal initiation in bacteria generally requires a ribosome-binding site, which a single base substitution is unlikely to create. It would also produce an N-terminally truncated protein. Less plausible than a classic frameshift suppressor.\n- B: Exact deletion of the originally inserted base would be a true reversion at the original site. This contradicts the data that the original mutation remains.\n- C: Deletion of a single base pair a short distance away is the canonical intragenic suppressor of a frameshift, giving net shift $0$ modulo $3$ and restoring the reading frame downstream, consistent with the observed partial phenotype.\n- D: Converting a premature stop codon to an amino acid by base substitution would not fix the frameshift; the reading frame would remain incorrect and additional stops are likely. Implausible given the original frameshift remains.\n- E: Inserting exactly two base pairs near the original site could, in the specific case of an original $+1$ insertion, yield $(+1)+(+2)=+3\\equiv 0$ modulo $3$, restoring the frame. However, this contradicts the description of the second change as a “single-point mutation” and is less typical than a single-base compensatory deletion. Furthermore, the option specifies two base pairs, not a single-base change.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible molecular description for the second-site suppressor is a single-base deletion nearby that restores the reading frame downstream, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1474259"}, {"introduction": "Cells are not passive victims of DNA damage; they possess sophisticated repair pathways to defend their genetic integrity. This problem challenges you to think quantitatively about the dynamic interplay between DNA damage, repair efficiency, and mutation frequency. Using hypothetical experimental data from a DNA repair-deficient yeast strain, you will predict how a cell's genetic background can dramatically amplify the effects of a mutagen, highlighting the critical role of pathways like Base Excision Repair (BER) in preventing mutations [@problem_id:1474248].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the effects of oxidative DNA damage in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The focus is on the lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which, if unrepaired before DNA replication, can pair with adenine, leading to a G:C to T:A transversion mutation after a subsequent round of replication. The primary defense against this lesion is the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway, initiated by the DNA glycosylase OGG1.\n\nTwo yeast strains are used in a reversion assay. The first is a wild-type (WT) strain with a functional BER pathway. The second is an *ogg1Δ* mutant strain, which completely lacks the OGG1 enzyme and thus has a non-functional repair pathway for 8-oxoG. Both strains carry a `his3` mutation that can be reverted to the `HIS+` phenotype by a specific G:C to T:A transversion. The mutation frequency is measured as the number of `HIS+` revertant colonies per viable cell plated.\n\nThe experiment yields the following data:\n1.  The spontaneous mutation frequency in the WT strain is $2.0 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n2.  The spontaneous mutation frequency in the *ogg1Δ* strain is $2.0 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n3.

The OGG1-mediated repair in the WT strain is not 100% efficient, meaning some fraction of lesions escape repair even in the WT.
