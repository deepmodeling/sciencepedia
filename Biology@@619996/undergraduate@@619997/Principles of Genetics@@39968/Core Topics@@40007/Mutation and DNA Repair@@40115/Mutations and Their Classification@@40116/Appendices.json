{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding genetic mutations begins at the smallest scale: the single nucleotide point mutation. These changes are not all chemically equivalent; they are categorized based on whether the substitution swaps a base for one of a similar chemical structure or a different one. This first practice challenges you to apply this fundamental classification, distinguishing between a transition (purine-to-purine/pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine) and a transversion (purine-to-pyrimidine or vice-versa), a key skill for analyzing DNA sequence data [@problem_id:1505597].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a gene in a newly discovered species of archaea. The wild-type version of this gene contains the following short Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence on its template strand:\n\n5' - GAC TGG CAT TCG - 3'\n\nIn a non-functional variant of the gene, a point mutation was identified, altering the sequence to:\n\n5' - GAC TGG CAA TCG - 3'\n\nFor reference, in DNA, Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are classified as purines, while Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) are classified as pyrimidines.\n\nHow would this specific nucleotide substitution be classified?\n\nA. Transition\nB. Transversion\nC. Frameshift\nD. Inversion\nE. Deletion", "solution": "We compare the wild-type template-strand sequence 5' - GAC TGG CAT TCG - 3' to the mutant 5' - GAC TGG CAA TCG - 3' to identify the precise change. The sequences are identical except at the third triplet, where \"CAT\" becomes \"CAA\". Thus, the single-nucleotide substitution is at the third position of that triplet on the template strand: T is replaced by A, i.e., T → A.\n\nUsing the given classification, Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are purines, while Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) are pyrimidines. Therefore, the change T → A is a pyrimidine → purine substitution.\n\nBy definition:\n- A transition is a substitution within the same base class (purine ↔ purine or pyrimidine ↔ pyrimidine), i.e., A ↔ G or C ↔ T.\n- A transversion is a substitution between different base classes (purine ↔ pyrimidine), i.e., A or G ↔ C or T.\n\nSince T (pyrimidine) → A (purine) changes base class, it is a transversion. It is not a frameshift because the sequence length is unchanged (no insertion or deletion), not an inversion because no segment is reversed, and not a deletion because no nucleotide is removed.\n\nTherefore, the substitution is classified as a transversion, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1505597"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the chemical change, the true significance of a mutation lies in its effect on the final protein product. A single nucleotide substitution can alter the genetic code in several ways, with dramatically different functional outcomes. This next exercise explores one of the most severe consequences: the creation of a premature stop signal, known as a nonsense mutation, which truncates the protein and almost always abolishes its function [@problem_id:1505658].", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying a heritable disorder that leads to the production of a truncated and non-functional protein. Their investigation focuses on the gene responsible for this protein. Through sequence analysis of the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced in affected individuals, they pinpoint a single nucleotide substitution as the cause. In the corresponding gene sequence from healthy individuals, a specific codon is `5'-UGG-3'`, which directs the ribosome to incorporate the amino acid Tryptophan. However, in individuals with the disorder, this codon has been altered to `5'-UGA-3'`. The `5'-UGA-3'` codon is one of the canonical termination codons that signal the ribosome to stop protein synthesis.\n\nBased on its functional consequence on the resulting polypeptide chain, which of the following best classifies this specific mutation?\n\nA. Missense mutation\nB. Frameshift mutation\nC. Silent mutation\nD. Nonsense mutation\nE. Samesense mutation", "solution": "We identify the molecular event described. The healthy codon is 5'-UGG-3', which encodes the amino acid tryptophan. In affected individuals, this codon is altered to 5'-UGA-3', which is one of the standard stop codons. This change is a single nucleotide substitution that converts a sense codon into a termination codon.\n\nThe functional consequence of substituting a sense codon with a stop codon is premature termination of translation, yielding a truncated polypeptide. By definition, a single-base substitution that produces a premature stop codon is a nonsense mutation.\n\nTo exclude the other options:\n- A missense mutation changes a codon to one that specifies a different amino acid, not a stop codon; this does not apply here because 5'-UGA-3' does not encode an amino acid.\n- A frameshift mutation results from insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in multiples of three, altering the reading frame; no insertion or deletion is described.\n- A silent mutation (synonymous) changes a codon without altering the encoded amino acid; here, the amino acid is replaced by a stop signal, so it is not silent.\n- \"Samesense mutation\" is not a standard classification distinct from synonymous/silent changes and does not fit the introduction of a stop codon.\n\nTherefore, the best classification of this specific mutation, based on its consequence of creating a premature stop codon and truncating the protein, is a nonsense mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1505658"}, {"introduction": "Mutations are not limited to single nucleotides; they can also occur on a much grander scale, affecting entire chromosomes or even an organism's complete set of chromosomes. Such large-scale changes, known as chromosomal abnormalities, are powerful drivers of genetic diversity and disease. This final practice asks you to analyze a scenario involving an error in meiosis that results in a change in ploidy level, and to correctly classify this change as a specific type of autopolyploidy [@problem_id:1505600].", "problem": "A botanist studying the genetics of a particular species of flowering plant, which is normally diploid (possessing two sets of chromosomes), observes an unusual phenomenon. A malfunction during the second meiotic division in a pollen parent plant results in the formation of a viable diploid pollen grain. This diploid pollen grain subsequently fertilizes a normal, haploid ovule from a plant of the same species. The resulting zygote successfully develops into a mature offspring with distinct characteristics.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following terms most precisely describes the chromosomal condition of this offspring?\n\nA. Trisomy\nB. Pericentric Inversion\nC. Autopolyploidy\nD. Allopolyploidy\nE. Monosomy", "solution": "Let the species’ somatic chromosome number be $2n$. In normal meiosis, gametes are haploid with $n$ chromosomes.\n\nGiven: A meiotic II malfunction in the pollen parent produces a viable diploid pollen grain, i.e., a male gamete with $2n$. This $2n$ pollen fertilizes a normal haploid ovule with $n$.\n\nTherefore, the resulting zygote has chromosome number:\n$$\n2n + n = 3n.\n$$\nThis is a whole-genome increase to a triploid level, not the gain or loss of a single chromosome. Hence:\n- Not trisomy ($2n+1$) because $3n$ represents an entire extra set, not a single extra chromosome.\n- Not monosomy ($2n-1$) for the same reason.\n- Not a pericentric inversion, which is a structural rearrangement within a chromosome without changing total chromosome number.\n- Not allopolyploidy, which requires combining chromosome sets from different species.\n\nBecause the extra set(s) come from the same species, the condition is polyploidy arising within a single species, i.e., autopolyploidy. Specifically, a triploid autopolyploid ($3n$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1505600"}]}
