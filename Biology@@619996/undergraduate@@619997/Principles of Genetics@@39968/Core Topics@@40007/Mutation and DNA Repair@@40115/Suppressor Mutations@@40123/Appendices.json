This first exercise explores a classic scenario: a recessive suppressor that masks the phenotype of another recessive mutation.

The first gene has a dominant allele, $M$, which confers a smooth leaf surface, and a recessive allele, $m$, which results in a crinkled leaf surface. The second gene acts as a genetic suppressor. The recessive allele $s$ of this second gene can suppress the crinkled-leaf phenotype, meaning that plants with the genotype $m/m ; s/s$ exhibit smooth leaves. The dominant allele $S$ has no suppressive effect.\n\nA true-breeding plant with crinkled leaves is crossed with a true-breeding, smooth-leaved plant that is homozygous for the suppressor allele.

A geneticist isolates a true-breeding strain with white flowers and determines it is caused by a single autosomal recessive mutation in a gene designated $c$, with the wild-type allele being $C$. Thus, the white-flowered plants have a genotype of $c/c$.\n\nThrough mutagenesis of the white-flowered $c/c$ strain, the geneticist discovers a true-breeding line that has reverted to the wild-type red flower phenotype. Further analysis reveals that the original $c/c$ mutation is still present and that the reversion is caused by a second, unlinked, autosomal recessive mutation called a suppressor, designated $s$. The wild-type allele at this second locus is $S$. Therefore, the genotype of this reverted-red strain is $c/c ; s/s$.\n\nThe geneticist now wishes to determine if the suppressor mutation $s$ has its own observable phenotype when present in a homozygous state ($s/s$) in an otherwise wild-type genetic background (i.e., in a plant with at least one $C$ allele).

This problem shifts our focus from eukaryotes to bacteria and from prediction to experimental design [@problem_id:1524076]. By interpreting the results of a P1 transduction experiment, you'll see how geneticists use the principles of gene linkage and recombination to distinguish between these fundamentally different molecular events.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying an *Escherichia coli* strain that is auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine, meaning it cannot synthesize its own histidine and requires it in the growth medium. This phenotype is caused by a mutation in the $hisD$ gene, making the strain's genotype $hisD^-$. After treating a culture of this auxotroph with a mutagen, the geneticist isolates a \"revertant\" colony that is now prototrophic (phenotype His$^+$), meaning it can grow on a Minimal Medium (MM) lacking histidine.\n\nThere are two primary hypotheses for the genetic basis of this His$^+$ revertant:\n1.  **True Reversion:** A back-mutation occurred at the original site, restoring the wild-type gene. The isolate's genotype is $hisD^+$.\n2.  **Intergenic Suppression:** The original mutation is still present, but a new mutation in a different gene, called a suppressor, compensates for the defect. The isolate's genotype is $hisD^- supE^+$, where $supE^+$ is the suppressor allele. The suppressor gene $supE$ is known to be **unlinked** to the $hisD$ gene on the bacterial chromosome.\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, the geneticist performs a P1 phage transduction experiment. The His$^+$ revertant isolate is used as the donor strain. This donor strain is also engineered to be resistant to the antibiotic streptomycin, conferred by a resistance allele $str^R$ that is very closely linked to the $hisD$ gene. The recipient strain is the original $hisD^-$ auxotroph, which is sensitive to streptomycin ($str^S$).\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows: P1 phage is grown on the donor strain (His$^+$, $str^R$), and the resulting phage lysate is used to infect a culture of the recipient strain ($hisD^-$, $str^S$). The mixture is then plated on two different types of agar plates.\n\n-   **Plate 1:** Complete medium (containing histidine) supplemented with streptomycin.\n-   **Plate 2:** Minimal medium (lacking histidine) supplemented with streptomycin.\n\nAfter incubation, the geneticist observes that 1,200 colonies grew on Plate 1. Assuming the **Intergenic Suppression hypothesis** is correct, approximately how many colonies would you expect to grow on Plate 2?\n\nA. 1,200\n\nB. 900\n\nC. 600\n\nD. 300\n\nE. Close to 0", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the two hypotheses about the donor genotype and the selection design.\n\nUnder the Intergenic Suppression hypothesis, the donor strain is genotypically $hisD^- supE^+ str^R$. The recipient strain is $hisD^- supE^- str^S$. The P1 phage packages a single, short, contiguous fragment of donor DNA; therefore, co-transduction occurs only for loci that are closely linked on the chromosome. The marker $str^R$ is stated to be very closely linked to $hisD$, while the suppressor gene $supE$ is unlinked to $hisD$. Thus, the probability of co-transducing $supE$ with $str^R$ and/or $hisD$ in a single transducing particle is effectively zero.\n\nPlate 1 (complete medium with streptomycin) selects only for acquisition of streptomycin resistance, so the number of colonies on Plate 1 (1,200) equals the number of $str^R$ transductants recovered. Because histidine is supplied, these transductants can grow regardless of their $hisD$ or $supE$ status. Therefore, Plate 1 gives 1,200 $str^R$ transductants.\n\nPlate 2 (minimal medium lacking histidine, with streptomycin) imposes two simultaneous requirements for growth: streptomycin resistance and the His$^+$ phenotype. For a recipient cell to grow on Plate 2, it must (i) acquire $str^R$ to survive the antibiotic and (ii) become His$^+$. Under the Intergenic Suppression hypothesis, the donor does not carry $hisD^+$, only $hisD^-$, so co-transduction of $str^R$ with $hisD$ cannot restore the His$^+$ phenotype. The only route to become His$^+$ is acquisition of the unlinked suppressor $supE^+$.\n\nBecause P1 transduces a single contiguous fragment, selection for $str^R$ enriches for donor fragments from the str-his region. The unlinked $supE^+$ cannot be co-transduced with $str^R$ in the same transducing particle. The only way a cell could obtain both $str^R$ and $supE^+$ would be through two independent transduction events into the same cell, one delivering $str^R$ (linked to $hisD^-$) and a separate one delivering $supE^+$. The probability of this double event under standard transduction conditions is negligibly small. Let the probability that a selected $str^R$ transductant also acquires $supE^+$ via a second, independent event be denoted by $\\epsilon$, with $\\epsilon \\approx 0$. Then the expected number of colonies on Plate 2 is\n$$\n1200 \\times \\epsilon \\approx 0.\n$$\nTherefore, under the Intergenic Suppression hypothesis, essentially no colonies are expected on Plate 2.\n\nThis reasoning matches option E (Close to 0).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1524076"}]}
