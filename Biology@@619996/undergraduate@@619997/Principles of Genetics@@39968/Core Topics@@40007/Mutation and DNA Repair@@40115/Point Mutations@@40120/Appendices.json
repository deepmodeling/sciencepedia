The purines are Adenine (A) and Guanine (G). The pyrimidines are Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T).\n\nA point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide. Point mutations are classified as follows:\n- A **transition** is a substitution of one purine for another purine (A ↔ G) or one pyrimidine for another pyrimidine (C ↔ T).\n- A **transversion** is a substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine, or a pyrimidine for a purine (e.g., A ↔ C, A ↔ T, G ↔ C, G ↔ T).\n\nNow, let's align the two sequences and compare them base by base. We number the positions from left to right, starting at 1.\n\nPosition:      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nWild-type:  5'-T  A  C  G  G  T  C  C  A  G  A  G  T  T  A-3'\nMutant:     5'-T  A  C  G  G  T  C  A  A  G  A  G  T  T  A-3'\n\nBy comparing the two sequences, we can see that they are identical at all positions except for position 8. At position 8, the wild-type sequence has a Cytosine (C), while the mutant sequence has an Adenine (A).\n\nThe mutation is a change from C to A at position 8.\n- Cytosine (C) is a pyrimidine.\n- Adenine (A) is a purine.\n\nSince the substitution is from a pyrimidine (C) to a purine (A), this type of mutation is classified as a **transversion**.\n\nTherefore, the mutation is a transversion at position 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. A transition at position 8: The position is correct, but the classification is wrong. It's a transversion, not a transition.\nB. A transversion at position 9: The classification is correct, but the position is wrong. The mutation is at position 8.\nC. A transition at position 9: Both the classification and the position are wrong.\nD. A transversion at position 8: Both the classification (transversion) and the position (8) are correct.\nE. A frameshift mutation at position 8: A frameshift mutation is caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides, not a substitution. Since one base was substituted for another, this is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nThe correct description is a transversion at position 8.

This practice problem simulates a common task in genomics: analyzing *de novo* mutations found by comparing a child's genome to their parents'.

Any Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), a variation at a single position in a DNA sequence, found in the child but absent in both parents is considered a *de novo* mutation.\n\nThese mutations can be classified based on the type of nucleotide substitution. The four DNA bases are categorized into two groups: purines (Adenine, A, and Guanine, G) and pyrimidines (Cytosine, C, and Thymine, T).

This exercise highlights the crucial link between the molecular nature of a mutation and the logic of its experimental detection.", "problem": "In molecular genetics, point mutations are categorized based on the type of base substitution. A **transition** is a substitution of a purine for another purine (Adenine ↔ Guanine) or a pyrimidine for another pyrimidine (Cytosine ↔ Thymine). A **transversion** is a substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine or vice versa (e.g., Adenine ↔ Cytosine).\n\nA genetics student is using the Ames test to screen a new chemical, Compound Z, for mutagenic properties. The test utilizes a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is an auxotroph for histidine, meaning it cannot grow on a medium lacking this amino acid. This auxotrophic phenotype is the result of a single point mutation in the *hisD* gene. The wild-type gene at this position contains the codon 5'-GGC-3' (encoding the amino acid Glycine), which is part of the active site of the enzyme. The student's tester strain has suffered a G-to-T transversion at the first position of this codon, creating the mutant codon 5'-TGC-3' (encoding Cysteine). This single amino acid change completely inactivates the enzyme.\n\nThe student's research suggests that if Compound Z is mutagenic, it exclusively causes transition mutations. Assuming that only a true reversion of the mutant Cysteine codon back to the wild-type Glycine codon can restore enzyme function and thus allow the bacteria to grow on the histidine-lacking medium, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate for the student to draw about the expected outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. Compound Z will be identified as a potent mutagen because a transition mutation on the template strand will restore the original GGC codon.\n\nB. Compound Z will not be identified as a mutagen using this specific tester strain, as a transition mutation cannot cause the necessary T-to-G reversion.\n\nC. The test will be inconclusive because the rate of spontaneous reversion from TGC back to GGC is high enough to mask any effect from Compound Z.\n\nD. Compound Z will be identified as a weak mutagen because a transition at the third position of the codon (C to T) could potentially restore enzyme function.\n\nE. The Ames test is not suitable because Compound Z causes transitions, which are generally less harmful than transversions and do not typically lead to prototrophic reversion.", "solution": "A transition is a base substitution within the same class: purine to purine (A ↔ G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (C ↔ T). A transversion is a base substitution between classes: purine to pyrimidine or pyrimidine to purine (A or G ↔ C or T).\n\nThe wild-type coding-strand codon is 5'-GGC-3' (Gly). The tester strain’s mutant coding-strand codon is 5'-TGC-3' (Cys), produced by a G-to-T transversion at the first position relative to the wild type. To achieve a true reversion restoring enzyme function under the stated assumption, the mutant codon 5'-TGC-3' must be changed back exactly to 5'-GGC-3'.\n\nComparing 5'-TGC-3' to 5'-GGC-3':\n- Second position: G → G, already identical.\n- Third position: C → C, already identical.\n- First position: T must change to G.\n\nThe required change at the first position is T → G. Since T is a pyrimidine and G is a purine, T → G is a transversion, not a transition.\n\nBecause Compound Z is assumed to cause exclusively transitions, it cannot effect the necessary T → G transversion. Therefore, under the stated condition that only a true reversion to 5'-GGC-3' restores function, Compound Z will not produce revertants and will not be identified as a mutagen using this tester strain.\n\nAddressing the distractors:\n- Option A incorrectly claims a transition on the template strand could restore the original codon. The template of TGC is ACG; reverting to GGC requires template CCG, which at the first position is A → C, a purine-to-pyrimidine transversion, not a transition.\n- Option C is unjustified; spontaneous true reversion rates at a specific base are typically low and cannot be assumed to mask effects, especially when the mutagen cannot cause the required change.\n- Option D suggests a transition at the third position (C → T) could restore function. Changing TGC to TGT is still Cys, not Gly, and thus does not restore function; moreover, the problem stipulates only true reversion to GGC restores activity.\n- Option E is incorrect in its rationale; the key issue is not the general severity of transitions but the specificity that only a transversion (T → G) can achieve the required true reversion here.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is that Compound Z will not be identified as a mutagen with this tester strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1510353"}]}
