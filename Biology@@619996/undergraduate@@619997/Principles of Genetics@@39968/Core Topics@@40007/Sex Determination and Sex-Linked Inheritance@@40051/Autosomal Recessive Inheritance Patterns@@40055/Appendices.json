This first practice provides a classic scenario in genetic counseling where you'll apply Mendel's Law of Segregation to a direct cross.

[@problem_id:1470360]", "problem": "A couple is seeking genetic counseling regarding the risk of their future children inheriting Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited metabolic disorder. PKU is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning it only manifests in individuals who are homozygous for the recessive allele. Let's denote the dominant allele, which allows for normal phenylalanine metabolism, as $P$, and the recessive allele, which causes PKU, as $p$.\n\nThe man is known to be heterozygous for the gene ($Pp$). The woman has PKU. They plan to have a child. Assuming Mendelian inheritance patterns, calculate the following two probabilities:\n1. The probability that their child will be born with Phenylketonuria.\n2. The probability that their child will be a carrier of the PKU allele but will not have the condition (i.e., will be heterozygous).\n\nExpress your answers as two decimal fractions. The first value in your answer should correspond to the probability of the child having PKU, and the second value should correspond to the probability of the child being a carrier.", "solution": "PKU is autosomal recessive, so the phenotype appears only in homozygotes for the recessive allele $p$. Thus, individuals with genotype $pp$ have PKU, while $Pp$ are unaffected carriers and $PP$ are unaffected non-carriers.\n\nGiven the man is $Pp$ and the woman is $pp$, apply Mendel’s law of segregation to determine gamete distributions:\n- From the man: $P$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $p$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- From the woman: $p$ with probability $1$ (the only allele she can pass).\n\nCompute offspring genotype probabilities by combining gametes:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(\\text{child } Pp) &= \\Pr(\\text{father } P)\\cdot \\Pr(\\text{mother } p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2},\\\\\n\\Pr(\\text{child } pp) &= \\Pr(\\text{father } p)\\cdot \\Pr(\\text{mother } p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNo $PP$ offspring can result from this mating.\n\nMap genotypes to the asked probabilities:\n- Probability the child has PKU (genotype $pp$): $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$.\n- Probability the child is a carrier but unaffected (genotype $Pp$): $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.50 & 0.50\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1470360"}, {"introduction": "While Mendelian ratios provide a powerful predictive framework, real biological systems often introduce complexities that modify these expectations. This exercise explores the concept of a recessive lethal allele, where one of the expected genotypes is non-viable and therefore absent from the live-born population.

The dominant allele, denoted by $A$, results in a dark grey coat, which is the wild-type phenotype. The recessive allele, denoted by $a$, is associated with a condition called Alabaster Fur Syndrome. Individuals homozygous for the recessive allele ($aa$) fail to develop properly and are non-viable, dying during embryonic development. Heterozygous individuals ($Aa$) are phenotypically indistinguishable from homozygous dominant individuals ($AA$), both exhibiting a dark grey coat, but the heterozygotes are carriers of the Alabaster Fur allele.\n\nTwo heterozygous Shadow Voles ($Aa$) are mated.
