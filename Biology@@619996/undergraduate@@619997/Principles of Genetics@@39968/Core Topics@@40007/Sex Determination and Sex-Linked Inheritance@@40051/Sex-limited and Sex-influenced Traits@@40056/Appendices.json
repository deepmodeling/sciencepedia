These traits are controlled by autosomal genes, but their expression is modified by the sex hormones of the individual, leading to different phenotypic outcomes in males and females with the same genotype.

The allele for a long, curved \"Saber\" horn is denoted by $H^S$, and the allele for a short, straight \"Spike\" horn is denoted by $H^k$. The expression of these alleles is sex-influenced.\n\nIn males, the Saber allele ($H^S$) is dominant over the Spike allele ($H^k$). Therefore, males with genotypes $H^S H^S$ or $H^S H^k$ exhibit Saber horns, while only males with the $H^k H^k$ genotype exhibit Spike horns.\n\nIn females, the dominance is reversed. The Spike allele ($H^k$) is dominant over the Saber allele ($H^S$). Consequently, females with genotypes $H^k H^k$ or $H^S H^k$ exhibit Spike horns, and only females with the $H^S H^S$ genotype exhibit Saber horns.\n\nA heterozygous male is crossed with a heterozygous female.
