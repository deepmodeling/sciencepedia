{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In the study of genetics, observing an organism's phenotype—its visible traits—doesn't always reveal its underlying genotype. This is especially true for dominant traits, where an individual could be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous. The test cross is a foundational experimental technique designed to resolve this uncertainty by crossing the individual of unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive partner, a method you will explore in this problem [@problem_id:1470129]. Mastering this concept is crucial for understanding how geneticists decipher the hereditary makeup of organisms.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a newly discovered species of bioluminescent beetle, *Lampyris eximius*. In this species, the trait for abdomen color is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a green abdomen, denoted by $G$, is autosomal dominant over the allele for a yellow abdomen, denoted by $g$. The geneticist has captured a male beetle with a green abdomen from the wild and wishes to determine its exact genotype to establish a pure-breeding (homozygous) line for laboratory studies. The lab has a large stock of beetles that are known to be pure-breeding for the yellow abdomen phenotype. Which of the following experimental crosses would be the most direct and conclusive method for determining if the captured green male is homozygous dominant ($GG$) or heterozygous ($Gg$)?\n\nA. Cross the green male with a female beetle that also has a green abdomen.\n\nB. Cross the green male with a female beetle from the lab's stock of yellow-abdomen beetles.\n\nC. Cross the green male with a yellow female, and then allow the first-generation offspring to interbreed among themselves.\n\nD. Cross the green male with one of its own female offspring produced from an initial cross with a yellow-abdomened female.", "solution": "We are told that abdomen color is determined by a single autosomal gene with two alleles, where $G$ (green) is completely dominant over $g$ (yellow). A green male could therefore be either $GG$ (homozygous dominant) or $Gg$ (heterozygous). The goal is to determine which genotype the green male has in the most direct and conclusive way.\n\nPrinciple: Under simple Mendelian inheritance with complete dominance, the standard method to determine the genotype of an individual showing the dominant phenotype is a test cross, i.e., crossing the individual with a homozygous recessive ($gg$) tester. The phenotypes of the offspring reveal the genotype of the tested parent.\n\nLet the captured male be either $GG$ or $Gg$. The lab has pure-breeding yellow beetles, which are $gg$.\n\nCase 1: If the male is $GG$, then crossing with a $gg$ female yields:\n- Male gametes: only $G$.\n- Female gametes: only $g$.\n- Offspring: all $Gg$.\nFormally,\n$$\nGG \\times gg \\rightarrow \\text{offspring all } Gg \\ (\\text{probability } 1),\n$$\nso all offspring are green.\n\nCase 2: If the male is $Gg$, then crossing with a $gg$ female yields:\n- Male gametes: $G$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $g$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Female gametes: only $g$.\n- Offspring genotypes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\ Gg \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\ gg,\n$$\nso half of the offspring are green and half are yellow in expectation. The appearance of any yellow offspring implies the male is $Gg$; if all offspring are green (with sufficient sample size), that supports $GG$.\n\nTherefore, crossing the green male with a known $gg$ female is both direct and conclusive in a single generation. This corresponds to option B.\n\nWhy the other options are not as direct or conclusive:\n- Option A: Crossing with a green female (unknown genotype) is inconclusive because a green female could be $GG$ or $Gg$, producing multiple possible outcomes that do not uniquely identify the male’s genotype.\n- Option C: Crossing with a yellow female and then interbreeding the first-generation offspring adds an unnecessary extra generation; the initial test cross already distinguishes $GG$ from $Gg$ directly.\n- Option D: Crossing the male with one of its own female offspring from an initial cross with a yellow female is less direct and depends on the genotype of that offspring (which could be $Gg$ or $gg$), again adding unnecessary steps compared to the immediate test cross with $gg$.\n\nThus, the most direct and conclusive cross is with a homozygous recessive yellow female from the lab stock.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1470129"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand how to determine parental genotypes, we can begin to make powerful quantitative predictions about their potential offspring. This practice moves beyond simple Mendelian ratios to address more realistic questions, such as calculating the probability of a specific combination of traits in a family [@problem_id:1470147]. Applying principles of binomial probability to inheritance patterns is an essential skill for genetic counselors and researchers who need to assess the likelihood of genetic outcomes.", "problem": "A genetic counselor is advising a couple. One partner has been diagnosed with Cerebellar Hyperexcitability Syndrome (CHS), a rare neurological condition. CHS is known to be caused by a single autosomal dominant allele, and it exhibits complete penetrance, meaning anyone with the allele will express the disorder. The affected partner's father also had CHS, but their mother was unaffected. The other partner is unaffected by CHS and has no family history of the disorder.\n\nThe couple plans to have three children. Assuming the gender of the children has no bearing on the outcome, calculate the probability that they will have exactly two children affected with CHS and one unaffected child. The order of birth for the affected and unaffected children does not matter.\n\nExpress your final answer as a fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "Let $A$ denote the autosomal dominant allele causing CHS and $a$ denote the normal allele. Because CHS has complete penetrance, any individual with genotype containing at least one $A$ is affected, and unaffected individuals must be $aa$.\n\nThe affected partner’s mother is unaffected, hence her genotype is $aa$ and she contributes only the $a$ allele to her offspring. Since the affected partner is affected, they must have received an $A$ allele from their affected father. Therefore, the affected partner’s genotype is $Aa$.\n\nThe other partner is unaffected and, given complete penetrance, must have genotype $aa$. Thus the mating is $Aa \\times aa$.\n\nFor each child, the affected parent transmits $A$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $a$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, while the unaffected parent always transmits $a$. Therefore, the probability a child is affected is\n$$\np=\\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nand the probability a child is unaffected is $1-p=\\frac{1}{2}$. The outcomes for different children are independent.\n\nThe probability of having exactly $k=2$ affected children in $n=3$ total children is given by the binomial distribution:\n$$\nP=\\binom{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3-2}\n=\\binom{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3}\n=3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8}\n=\\frac{3}{8}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "1470147"}, {"introduction": "While Mendel's laws provide a fundamental framework, the expression of genes can be more complex. Some dominant alleles, when present in a homozygous state ($AA$), can be so detrimental that they are embryonic lethal. This exercise explores how such lethal alleles alter the expected statistical outcomes among surviving offspring, leading to modified phenotypic ratios that differ from the standard 3:1 pattern [@problem_id:1470106]. Understanding this phenomenon is key to interpreting real-world inheritance patterns where certain expected genotypes are conspicuously absent.", "problem": "A fictional genetic condition known as Hyper-Photonic Retinal Response (HPRR) is an autosomal dominant disorder in humans. The allele for HPRR is designated as $A$, while the allele for a normal phenotype is designated as $a$. Extensive genetic studies have revealed a critical detail about this disorder: the homozygous dominant genotype ($AA$) is embryonic lethal, resulting in the non-viability of the embryo.\n\nConsider a scenario where two individuals, both of whom are heterozygous for HPRR, plan to have children. Assuming Mendelian inheritance patterns for the alleles, what is the expected phenotypic ratio of their surviving offspring?\n\nA. 1 affected with HPRR : 2 unaffected\n\nB. 2 affected with HPRR : 1 unaffected\n\nC. 3 affected with HPRR : 1 unaffected\n\nD. 1 affected with HPRR : 1 unaffected\n\nE.
