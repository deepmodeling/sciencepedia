{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding sex determination often begins with the familiar human XY system, a classic example of a genetic switch where a single gene can initiate an entire developmental cascade. This exercise [@problem_id:1519681] presents a thought experiment in which you predict the outcome of a critical failure within this system. By doing so, you will solidify your understanding of the *SRY* gene's pivotal role as the master switch for male development and the fundamental concept of a default female pathway in mammals.", "problem": "In human development, the pathway to either male or female primary sexual characteristics is initiated by specific genetic triggers. The default developmental pathway is female. The presence of a functional Sex-determining Region Y (*SRY*) gene on the Y chromosome acts as a master switch that diverts this pathway toward male development. Consider a human zygote with a 46,XY karyotype. However, due to a spontaneous mutation, the *SRY* gene on its Y chromosome is completely non-functional, meaning it fails to produce its corresponding protein product. Assuming all other genes related to sexual development are normal and there are no other chromosomal abnormalities, which of the following outcomes best describes the primary sexual characteristics that will develop in this individual?\n\nA. Typical male internal reproductive structures (testes, vas deferens) and typical male external genitalia.\n\nB. Typical female internal reproductive structures (ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes) and typical female external genitalia.\n\nC. A mix of undeveloped male and female internal structures, leading to ambiguous external genitalia.\n\nD. Male internal reproductive structures (testes) but female external genitalia due to an inability of cells to respond to androgens.\n\nE. Lack of gonadal development (streak gonads) and absence of both Müllerian and Wolffian duct internal structures.", "solution": "Principles:\n- In the indifferent gonad, expression of a functional *SRY* gene drives differentiation into testes. Testes contain Sertoli cells that secrete anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), causing regression of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts, and Leydig cells that secrete testosterone, maintaining the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts and, via dihydrotestosterone (DHT), inducing male external genitalia.\n- In the absence of functional *SRY*, the bipotential gonad does not differentiate into testes. Without testes, there is no AMH and no androgen production, so the default pathway proceeds.\n\nApply to the scenario:\n- *SRY* is non-functional, so testes do not form. Therefore Sertoli cells are absent and AMH production is absent, so $AMH=0$. Without AMH, Müllerian ducts persist and develop into uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina.\n- Leydig cells are absent, so $T=0$ and $DHT=0$. Without testosterone, Wolffian ducts regress, so male internal structures (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles) do not develop. Without DHT, external genitalia follow the default female pathway, yielding female external genitalia.\n\nGonadal status note:\n- In a 46,XY individual lacking *SRY*, the typical clinical outcome is complete gonadal dysgenesis (streak gonads) with persistent Müllerian structures and female external genitalia. Among the provided options, none states “streak gonads with Müllerian structures present,” but the option that best captures the resultant primary sexual characteristics (internal and external) is the presence of typical female internal reproductive structures and typical female external genitalia.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1519681"}, {"introduction": "While the XY system is well-known, nature employs a variety of strategies for determining sex. In birds, some reptiles, and certain insects, the roles are reversed in the ZW system, where females are the heterogametic sex ($ZW$) and males are homogametic ($ZZ$). This practice [@problem_id:1519749] challenges you to apply the principles of sex-linked inheritance to this alternative system, strengthening your analytical skills by demonstrating their use in a different, yet equally important, biological context.", "problem": "In a species of parrot, sex is determined by the ZW system, where males are the homogametic sex (ZZ) and females are the heterogametic sex (ZW). A single Z-linked gene controls feather coloration. The dominant allele, denoted as $A$, results in green feathers, while the recessive allele, denoted as $a$, results in yellow feathers.\n\nA male parrot that is heterozygous for the feather color gene is crossed with a female parrot that has green feathers. An egg from this pairing hatches, and the resulting chick is observed to have yellow feathers.\n\nBased on this observation, determine the sex of the yellow-feathered chick.\n\nA. Male\n\nB. Female\n\nC. It could be either male or female with a 50% probability for each.\n\nD. The sex cannot be determined without knowing the genotype of the female parent's father.", "solution": "In the ZW system, males are homogametic ($ZZ$) and females are heterogametic ($ZW$). A Z-linked dominant allele $A$ confers green feathers; the recessive allele $a$ confers yellow feathers. Because females have only one $Z$ chromosome, their phenotype directly reflects the single $Z$-linked allele they carry: $Z^{A}W$ is green and $Z^{a}W$ is yellow. Males, being $ZZ$, express green if at least one $A$ is present and yellow only if both alleles are $a$.\n\nThe male is heterozygous, so his genotype is $Z^{A}Z^{a}$. The green female must be $Z^{A}W$ (since she has only one $Z$).\n\nGametes:\n- Male produces $Z^{A}$ or $Z^{a}$.\n- Female produces $Z^{A}$ or $W$.\n\nPossible zygotes and phenotypes:\n1. $Z^{A}$ (egg) with $Z^{A}$ (sperm) $\\Rightarrow Z^{A}Z^{A}$ (male), green.\n2. $Z^{A}$ (egg) with $Z^{a}$ (sperm) $\\Rightarrow Z^{A}Z^{a}$ (male), green.\n3. $W$ (egg) with $Z^{A}$ (sperm) $\\Rightarrow Z^{A}W$ (female), green.\n4. $W$ (egg) with $Z^{a}$ (sperm) $\\Rightarrow Z^{a}W$ (female), yellow.\n\nThe only way to obtain a yellow-feathered chick is the genotype $Z^{a}W$, which is female.

The fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, employs a \"genic balance\" system where the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes ($X:A$) triggers a sophisticated cascade of gene regulation. This problem [@problem_id:1519704] delves into this elegant pathway, showing how a single mutation in a key regulatory gene can uncouple chromosomal sex from phenotypic sex, providing deep insight into the logic of genetic hierarchies.", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, sex is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X:A ratio). This ratio governs the activity of a cascade of regulatory genes. A key gene in this pathway is *Sex-lethal* (*Sxl*), which is activated in flies with an X:A ratio of 1.0 (females) and remains inactive in flies with an X:A ratio of 0.5 (males). Functional *Sxl* protein, which is a Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) splicing factor, directs the splicing of the pre-messenger RNA from the *transformer* (*tra*) gene to produce a functional *Tra* protein. In the absence of *Sxl* protein, the *tra* gene produces a non-functional protein. The *Tra* protein, in turn, directs the female-specific splicing of the pre-messenger RNA from the *doublesex* (*dsx*) gene, leading to the production of the *Dsx-F* protein that promotes female development. In the absence of functional *Tra* protein, *dsx* undergoes default splicing to produce the *Dsx-M* protein, which promotes male development.\n\nA geneticist is studying a strain of *Drosophila* that carries a recessive, loss-of-function mutation in the *transformer* gene, denoted as $tra^{-}$. An individual fly that is chromosomally female (XX) and homozygous for this mutation ($tra^{-}/tra^{-}$) is produced from a cross. Based on the genetic pathway described, what will be the sexual phenotype of this fly?\n\nA. A normal, fertile female\n\nB. A sterile male\n\nC. An intersex individual with a mosaic of male and female tissues\n\nD. A non-viable individual that dies during development\n\nE. A normal, fertile male", "solution": "- The chromosomal constitution is XX, so the primary signal is $X:A=1.0$. By the pathway rule, $X:A=1.0$ activates *Sxl*, so functional *Sxl* protein is produced.\n\n- Functional *Sxl* normally directs the female-specific splicing of *transformer* (*tra*) pre-mRNA to yield functional *Tra* protein. However, the genotype is a loss-of-function and homozygous ($tra^{-}/tra^{-}$), so no functional *Tra* protein can be produced, irrespective of *Sxl* activity.\n\n- In the absence of functional *Tra*, *doublesex* (*dsx*) pre-mRNA follows the default splicing pattern to produce the male isoform *Dsx-M*, which directs male somatic development.\n\n- Therefore, the XX; $tra^{-}/tra^{-}$ fly will develop as a phenotypic male. In Drosophila, the Y chromosome is not required for male somatic development but is required for spermatogenesis. An XX individual lacks the Y chromosome, so it will be male in appearance but sterile.\n\n- Hence, the sexual phenotype is a sterile male.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1519704"}]}
