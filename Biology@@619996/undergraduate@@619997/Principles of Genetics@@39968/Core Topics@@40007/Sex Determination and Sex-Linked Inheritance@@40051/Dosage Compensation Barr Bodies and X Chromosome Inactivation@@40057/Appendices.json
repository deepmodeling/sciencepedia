This exercise explores the consequences when this critical 'master switch' is missing from one of the X chromosomes. By working through this problem, you will solidify your understanding of why *XIST* is essential for inactivation and how its absence can lead to a predictable, skewed inactivation pattern across all of an individual's cells [@problem_id:1484351].", "problem": "In human females, dosage compensation for X-linked genes is achieved by the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in somatic cells, a process that forms a visible Barr body. This inactivation is initiated by a region on the X chromosome called the X-Inactivation Center (XIC), which contains the *XIST* (X-inactive specific transcript) gene. The *XIST* gene produces a non-coding RNA that coats the chromosome from which it is transcribed, leading to its condensation and silencing.\n\nConsider a female individual with a rare chromosomal constitution. Her karyotype is found to be $46,X,r(X)$, meaning she has one normal X chromosome and one ring X chromosome, denoted $r(X)$. Detailed genetic analysis reveals that the ring X chromosome, $r(X)$, has a deletion that completely removes the *XIST* gene locus, while the normal X chromosome is structurally and genetically intact. Assuming that survival of the cell requires proper dosage compensation (i.e., the inactivation of one X chromosome), which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of X-inactivation in this individual's somatic cells?\n\nA. The normal X chromosome will be preferentially inactivated in all somatic cells.\n\nB. The ring X chromosome, $r(X)$, will be preferentially inactivated in all somatic cells because it is abnormal.\n\nC. Inactivation will be random, with some cells inactivating the normal X and other cells inactivating the ring X.\n\nD. Neither X chromosome will be inactivated, resulting in cells with a double dose of most X-linked genes.\n\nE. Both X chromosomes will be partially inactivated to compensate for the abnormal chromosome structure.", "solution": "Principle of X-chromosome inactivation: In mammalian females, dosage compensation is achieved by inactivating one X chromosome per somatic cell. Initiation requires the X-Inactivation Center (XIC), which includes the gene *XIST*. *XIST* produces a non-coding RNA that acts in cis to coat the chromosome from which it is transcribed, initiating its condensation and silencing. The chromosome that expresses *XIST* becomes the inactive X (Barr body). A chromosome lacking a functional *XIST* locus cannot initiate its own inactivation.\n\nGiven karyotype $46,X,r(X)$ with one normal X and one ring X, and the ring X has a deletion completely removing the *XIST* locus:\n1. The $r(X)$ cannot express *XIST*, so it cannot be inactivated in cis. Therefore, it is not a viable candidate for the inactive X.\n2. The cellular counting mechanism still requires that one X be inactivated for proper dosage compensation. With two X chromosomes present, the system will initiate inactivation on a chromosome capable of doing so.\n3. The only chromosome capable of inactivation is the normal X, which retains an intact XIC and *XIST*. Thus, the normal X will express *XIST*, be coated by its RNA, and become the inactive X (Barr body).\n4. This choice occurs early in development and is clonally propagated, so somatic cells will show skewed inactivation, with the normal X preferentially inactivated in essentially all cells.\n\nEliminating the options:\n- B is incorrect because $r(X)$ lacks *XIST* and cannot be inactivated despite being structurally abnormal.\n- C is incorrect because random choice requires both X chromosomes to be competent for inactivation; here only the normal X is competent.\n- D is incorrect because the counting mechanism enforces inactivation of one X, and the normal X can fulfill this.\n- E is incorrect because X-inactivation is not partial on both chromosomes; it is an all-or-none cis process requiring *XIST* on the inactivated chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the normal X will be preferentially inactivated in all somatic cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1484351"}, {"introduction": "Dosage compensation is a robust process that must account for the cell's overall chromosome content, not just the number of X chromosomes. This advanced problem challenges the simplistic '$N_X - 1$' rule by presenting a hypothetical tetraploid hybrid cell, which contains multiple sets of autosomes. To find the correct number of active and inactive X chromosomes, you must apply the more fundamental principle of maintaining a constant ratio of active X chromosomes to autosomal sets [@problem_id:1484313].", "problem": "In a cellular biology research project, a stable hybrid cell line is created by fusing a somatic cell from a human female with a 48,XXXX karyotype with a somatic cell from a normal human male with a 46,XY karyotype.

Because inactivation occurs early and is passed down through cell division, it creates a mosaic of cells in heterozygous females that can be used as a lineage tracer.

This individual is heterozygous for an X-linked housekeeping gene, `GENEX`. The two alleles present are `GENEX-A` and `GENEX-B`, which produce distinct mRNA transcripts.

In this specific case, it is assumed that the progenitor cell had its X-chromosome carrying the `GENEX-B` allele inactivated, and this inactivation pattern was stably inherited by all subsequent tumor cells. A biopsy is taken, and it consists of a mixture of these monoclonal tumor cells and contaminating healthy somatic cells.\n\nAn analysis of the total mRNA extracted from the entire biopsy sample reveals that 72.0% of the `GENEX` transcripts are of the `GENEX-A` type and 28.0% are of the `GENEX-B` type.
