This first practice presents a common experimental failure—the use of an inactive enzyme—to test your grasp of the ligase's primary role.

The circular plasmid vector is 4.5 kilobase pairs (kb) in size and contains a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme BamHI. The Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragment to be inserted is 1.2 kb and has been engineered to have BamHI recognition sites at both ends.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  The circular plasmid vector is completely digested with BamHI, resulting in a linearized vector.\n2.  The 1.2 kb DNA insert is also treated with BamHI to ensure it has compatible \"sticky\" ends.\n3.  The linearized plasmid vector and the prepared DNA insert are mixed in an appropriate molar ratio in a ligation buffer.\n4.  An enzyme, DNA ligase, is added to the mixture to catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds, intending to create a recombinant plasmid.\n\nHowever, the student unknowingly uses a batch of DNA ligase that was previously left at a high temperature for an extended period, causing it to be completely denatured and non-functional. The student proceeds with the experiment and then analyzes the final product of this reaction on an agarose gel. What is the expected primary result that will be observed in the lane corresponding to the reaction mixture?\n\nA. A single band at approximately 5.7 kb, representing the correctly formed circular recombinant plasmid.\n\nB.

The insert DNA of size $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ is also digested with BamHI, producing a linear $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragment with the same sticky ends.\n\nDNA ligase catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between a $3'$-hydroxyl and a $5'$-phosphate at DNA strand breaks. With the ligase completely denatured, the reaction rate for phosphodiester bond formation is effectively zero, so no covalent joining occurs.

This exercise delves into the substrate specificity of the enzyme by exploring a scenario where the DNA insert is missing the crucial $5'$-phosphate group. Analyzing this situation will clarify why successful ligation is not just about compatible ends, but also about the precise chemical structure at the nick [@problem_id:1482686].", "problem": "A researcher is performing a molecular cloning experiment to insert a specific Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragment into a plasmid vector. The plasmid vector, of length $L_v$, carries a single gene for ampicillin resistance. It has been linearized by a restriction enzyme, creating compatible ends that each possess a $5'$-phosphate group and a $3'$-hydroxyl group.\n\nThe DNA insert, of length $L_i$, was prepared using a non-standard enzymatic method. As a result, both ends of the double-stranded insert possess $5'$-hydroxyl groups and $3'$-hydroxyl groups.\n\nThe researcher sets up a ligation reaction in a single tube containing the linearized vector, the defective DNA insert, ATP, and a suitable buffer with T4 DNA Ligase. After the reaction, the entire mixture is used to transform a population of competent *E. coli* bacteria that are sensitive to ampicillin. The transformed bacteria are then plated onto nutrient agar plates containing ampicillin and incubated to allow for colony growth.\n\nAssuming the transformation procedure is successful and that linear DNA is rapidly degraded within the *E. coli* cells, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. A large number of ampicillin-resistant colonies will form, and subsequent analysis would show that most of these colonies contain the plasmid vector with the correctly integrated DNA insert.\n\nB. A moderate number of ampicillin-resistant colonies will form, and subsequent analysis would show that all of these colonies contain the re-circularized plasmid vector without the DNA insert.\n\nC.

No ampicillin-resistant colonies will form because the absence of a 5'-phosphate on the insert prevents any form of ligation, leaving all vectors linear and thus unable to confer resistance.\n\nE. A small number of ampicillin-resistant colonies will form, and they will contain a mix of re-circularized vectors and vectors with a tandem array of inserts ligated together.", "solution": "We analyze the ligation chemistry and the consequences for transformation and colony phenotypes step by step.\n\n1) T4 DNA ligase reaction requirements. T4 DNA ligase forms a phosphodiester bond only when a $3'$-hydroxyl attacks an adjacent $5'$-phosphate at a nick that has properly base-paired ends. Thus, for each nick to be sealed, the $5'$ terminus at that nick must carry a phosphate. If the $5'$ end carries a hydroxyl instead of a phosphate, T4 DNA ligase cannot seal that nick.\n\n2) End chemistries of the reactants. The linearized vector has, at each end, a $5'$-phosphate and a $3'$-hydroxyl. Therefore, the two nicks created when its compatible sticky ends anneal (during intramolecular ligation for re-circularization) both present $5'$-phosphate termini, allowing T4 DNA ligase to seal both strands and regenerate a covalently closed circular plasmid. The insert has, at both ends, $5'$-hydroxyl and $3'$-hydroxyl; therefore, at any junction where the insert contributes the $5'$ end, the nick cannot be sealed by T4 DNA ligase.\n\n3) Vector self-ligation outcome. Because both vector ends possess $5'$-phosphate, intramolecular re-circularization of the vector is fully supported. Annealing of the compatible ends followed by ligation seals both complementary nicks at that single vector-vector junction, yielding a covalently closed circular plasmid that efficiently transforms and confers ampicillin resistance.\n\n4) Vector-insert ligation topology. When the insert anneals into the vector, there are two vector-insert junctions. At each junction, there are two nicks (one in each strand). At each junction, exactly one of the two $5'$ ends is contributed by the vector (phosphorylated) and the other by the insert (dephosphorylated). T4 DNA ligase can therefore seal only the nick where the vector provides the $5'$-phosphate; the other nick at that junction (where the insert provides the $5'$ end) cannot be sealed in vitro. Consequently:\n- If both junctions anneal and the ligase seals the two nicks that have vector $5'$-phosphate, the product is a circular duplex with one remaining nick at each junction (two single-strand nicks total). Such nicked circles can, in principle, transform and be repaired in vivo, but their formation requires two independent ligation events (one at each junction) and proceeds with much lower efficiency than vector self-ligation.\n- Any partial product in which only one junction has ligated is linear overall and will be rapidly degraded in the cell, as stipulated.\n\n5) Insert-insert ligation is disallowed. A tandem array of inserts would require ligation at a junction where both $5'$ ends are from the insert; with both ends lacking $5'$-phosphate, neither nick at such a junction can be sealed by T4 DNA ligase, so covalent insert-insert concatemers do not form.\n\n6) Expected transformants. Because covalently closed circular plasmids transform most efficiently and because vector self-ligation is fully enabled whereas vector-insert circularization is kinetically disfavored (requiring two separate ligations and yielding only a nicked circle), the overwhelming and practically exclusive product that yields colonies is the re-circularized vector without the insert. Therefore:\n- Option A is incorrect: efficient insertion is not expected with a non-phosphorylated insert, and most colonies will not carry the correct insert.\n- Option C is mechanistically plausible for a minority species (nicked insert-containing circles), but describing the colonies as containing insert as a rule is inaccurate; in practice, the background of empty vector dominates.\n- Option D is incorrect: the vector’s phosphorylated ends allow self-ligation; thus ampicillin-resistant colonies will form.\n- Option E is incorrect: tandem arrays of inserts cannot form without $5'$-phosphates on insert ends; the surviving population will not contain such concatemers.\n\nHence, the most accurate description among the options is that ampicillin-resistant colonies arise from re-circularized vector lacking the insert, as stated in option B (the qualifier “moderate number” reflects typical yields relative to highly efficient transformations with pre-closed plasmids and the competition with degradation of any linear species).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1482686"}, {"introduction": "To complete the picture of the ligation reaction, we must also consider the $3'$ end of the DNA strand. This practice problem introduces a DNA fragment with a chemically blocked $3'$ terminus, which lacks the essential $3'$-hydroxyl ($3'$-OH) group.

The circular plasmid is first linearized using a restriction enzyme, creating two compatible ends, each possessing a $5'$-phosphate group on one strand and a $3'$-hydroxyl group on the other.\n\nThe synthetic DNA fragment is designed to have ends compatible with the linearized plasmid. However, due to a synthesis error, the fragment is structurally imperfect. At one terminus of the fragment, the $3'$ end of one of the two DNA strands is capped with a 2',3'-dideoxyribonucleotide (ddNTP), which lacks a hydroxyl group at the $3'$ carbon position. The other strand at this terminus has a normal $5'$-phosphate group. The other terminus of the DNA fragment is normal, with a standard $3'$-hydroxyl group on one strand and a $5'$-phosphate group on the complementary strand.\n\nThe linearized plasmid and the defective DNA fragment are mixed in the presence of DNA ligase and all necessary cofactors (e.g., ATP). The reaction is allowed to proceed to completion. Assuming conditions that favor the formation of products containing both the plasmid and the insert, which of the following options most accurately describes the predominant resulting molecular structure?\n\nA. A covalently closed circular plasmid containing the inserted DNA fragment, with both strands fully sealed at both insertion junctions.\n\nB. A circularized plasmid containing the insert, but with a single-strand break (a nick) in the phosphodiester backbone at one of the two junctions.\n\nC. A linear molecule where the fragment is ligated to only one end of the linearized plasmid, leaving the other end of the plasmid unattached.\n\nD. No reaction occurs; the final mixture contains only the original linear plasmid and the linear DNA fragment.\n\nE. The plasmid self-ligates to re-form a circle without the insert, and the defective fragments are left unreacted in the solution.", "solution": "DNA ligase forms a phosphodiester bond specifically between a $3^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl and a $5^{\\prime}$-phosphate via an adenylylated $5^{\\prime}$ intermediate, with the $3^{\\prime}$-OH serving as the nucleophile. Therefore, a free $3^{\\prime}$-OH is strictly required on the joining strand for ligation to occur at each junction.\n\nIn this setup, the linearized plasmid provides ends bearing a $5^{\\prime}$-phosphate on one strand and a $3^{\\prime}$-OH on the complementary strand at each end. The insert has two termini: one normal terminus (both strands present standard $3^{\\prime}$-OH and $5^{\\prime}$-phosphate ends in the proper orientation) and one defective terminus where one strand’s $3^{\\prime}$ end is a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-dideoxyribonucleotide lacking the $3^{\\prime}$-OH, while the other strand at that same terminus has a normal $5^{\\prime}$-phosphate.\n\nAt the normal terminus of the insert, both strands can be ligated to the plasmid ends because both required pairs ($3^{\\prime}$-OH/$5^{\\prime}$-phosphate) are present, yielding a fully sealed junction there.\n\nAt the defective terminus, only one of the two strands can be ligated: the strand that encounters a proper $3^{\\prime}$-OH/$5^{\\prime}$-phosphate pair will be sealed, but the strand whose $3^{\\prime}$ end is capped with a dideoxynucleotide lacks the $3^{\\prime}$-OH and thus cannot form the phosphodiester bond. DNA ligase cannot bypass this absence, and no polymerase activity is provided to replace the dd-terminated nucleotide. Consequently, after the reaction proceeds to completion under conditions favoring insert-containing products, the plasmid and insert will be joined at both ends to form a circle, but there will remain a single-strand break (a nick) at the junction corresponding to the ddNTP-terminated strand.\n\nTherefore, the predominant product is a circular plasmid containing the insert with one nick at one of the two insertion junctions. This excludes:\n- A, because full covalent closure at both junctions on both strands is impossible without a $3^{\\prime}$-OH.\n- C, because both ends of the plasmid can be joined to the insert (at least on one strand at the defective junction), yielding a circular, nicked molecule rather than a linear partial ligation.\n- D, because one bond at the defective junction and both bonds at the normal junction can form.\n- E, because conditions are stated to favor insert-containing products; while self-ligation can occur in general, it would not predominate here.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the circularized insert-containing plasmid with a single nick at one junction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1482694"}]}
