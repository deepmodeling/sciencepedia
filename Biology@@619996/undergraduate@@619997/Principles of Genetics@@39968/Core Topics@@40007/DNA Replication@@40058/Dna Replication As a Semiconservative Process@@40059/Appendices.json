The fundamental principle governing this process is the semiconservative model of DNA replication. This model states that a parent DNA double helix unwinds, and each of its two strands serves as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand.\n\nLet's denote an original strand, labeled with `${}^{15}\\text{N}$`, as `$S_{15}$`, and a newly synthesized strand, made with `${}^{14}\\text{N}$`, as `$S_{14}$`.\n\n**Generation 0 (Initial State):**\nWe begin with one bacterial cell.
