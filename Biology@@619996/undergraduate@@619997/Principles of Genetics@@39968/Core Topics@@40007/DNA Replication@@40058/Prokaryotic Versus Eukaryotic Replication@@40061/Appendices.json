This strain contains its main circular chromosome and a small, high-copy-number circular plasmid. The chromosome has a length of $L_c = 4.6 \\times 10^6$ base pairs (bp), while the plasmid has a length of $L_p = 5.0 \\times 10^3$ bp. In this organism, DNA exists as a double helix with a pitch of $h = 10.5$ bp per turn.

This reduces the overall gyrase activity within the cells to a level where the enzyme can no longer fully relieve the topological stress generated during DNA replication. The continuous unwinding of the parental DNA by helicase at the replication forks generates an accumulation of positive supercoils in the unreplicated template DNA.
