This problem challenges you to apply the core principles of replication initiation to a hypothetical, yet conceptually powerful, scenario. By calculating the number of primers required in a cell with multiple origins of replication, you will solidify your understanding of bidirectional replication and the specific role primers play in starting the synthesis of leading strands [@problem_id:1512961].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is engineering a novel prokaryotic organism for bioremediation purposes. They have designed its genome to be a single, circular chromosome. To accelerate the organism's growth rate, they have incorporated three distinct and equally spaced origins of replication into this circular chromosome. In this organism, as in all known life, DNA replication is initiated by the enzyme primase, which synthesizes a short RNA primer. DNA polymerase then extends this primer. From each origin, replication proceeds bidirectionally, forming two replication forks that travel in opposite directions along the chromosome.\n\nConsidering the simultaneous initiation of replication at all three origins, what is the total number of RNA primers required to start the replication of the two leading strands at each of these origins?", "solution": "DNA replication initiates at each origin when primase synthesizes an RNA primer that DNA polymerase extends. In bidirectional replication from a single origin, two replication forks are formed, moving in opposite directions. At each replication fork, there is exactly one leading strand, which is synthesized continuously and requires exactly one RNA primer to start.\n\nTherefore, per origin:\n- number of replication forks $= 2$,\n- RNA primers needed to start the two leading strands $= 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nWith $n_{\\text{origins}} = 3$ origins initiating simultaneously, the total number of RNA primers required to start all leading strands is\n$$\nN_{\\text{primers}} = n_{\\text{origins}} \\times 2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n$$\n\nLagging strands are not counted here because they require multiple primers for Okazaki fragments, and the question explicitly asks only for the primers to start the leading strands.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1512961"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've established the necessity of primers for initiation, let's delve into their biochemical composition. This thought experiment explores what happens when a key ingredient for RNA synthesis is missing. By analyzing a cell deficient in Uridine Triphosphate (UTP), you will discover why primase's ability to synthesize RNA is non-negotiable for DNA replication, affecting both the leading and lagging strands equally and demonstrating the fundamental dependence of DNA polymerase on RNA primers [@problem_id:1512941].", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell undergoing DNA replication. The cell has an abundant supply of all necessary enzymes (such as helicase, DNA polymerases, and ligase) and all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). However, due to a specific metabolic defect, the cell's pool of ribonucleoside triphosphates is altered. It has a plentiful supply of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Cytidine Triphosphate (CTP), and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), but is completely deficient in Uridine Triphosphate (UTP).\n\nAssuming this is the only limiting factor, which of the following statements most accurately describes the effect on DNA replication in this cell?\n\nA. Leading strand synthesis would proceed normally, but lagging strand synthesis would be completely inhibited.\n\nB. Both leading and lagging strand synthesis would proceed, but the rate of synthesis on the lagging strand would be significantly slower.\n\nC. Both leading and lagging strand synthesis would be completely inhibited.\n\nD. DNA synthesis would proceed on both strands, but Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand could not be joined together.\n\nE. DNA synthesis would initiate normally, but the resulting strands would contain a high frequency of mutations.", "solution": "DNA replication requires a pre-existing primer with a free $3^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl because DNA polymerases cannot initiate synthesis de novo; they only extend an existing strand. In eukaryotes, primers are synthesized by the primase activity of the DNA polymerase $\\alpha$-primase complex, which lays down short RNA primers composed of ribonucleotides. Therefore, RNA primer synthesis requires all four ribonucleoside triphosphates: ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, because the primer sequence must be complementary to the template DNA and will necessarily include U residues opposite template A residues.\n\nGiven that UTP is completely absent while ATP, CTP, and GTP are abundant, primase cannot incorporate U residues. Because template DNA contains A bases at non-negligible frequency, the primase will be unable to synthesize functional RNA primers of the requisite length on either template strand. Without RNA primers, neither the leading strand (which needs one primer at origin) nor the lagging strand (which needs frequent primers for each Okazaki fragment) can be initiated.\n\nOther replication enzymes are not limiting here: helicase activity can proceed using ATP; DNA ligase I in eukaryotes uses ATP (not UTP) for sealing nicks; and dNTP pools are adequate for elongation. However, elongation cannot occur without primers. Therefore, both leading and lagging strand synthesis would be completely inhibited.\n\nBy elimination:\n- A is incorrect because the leading strand also requires an initial RNA primer.\n- B is incorrect because the absence of UTP prevents primer synthesis altogether, not merely slowing it.\n- D is incorrect because ligation uses ATP, not UTP.\n- E is incorrect because the issue is failure to initiate synthesis, not increased mutation rate.\n\nThus, the most accurate statement is that both leading and lagging strand synthesis would be completely inhibited.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1512941"}, {"introduction": "The life cycle of a primer involves both its synthesis and its eventual removal. This final practice problem explores the critical, and highly specific, process of primer removal by examining a mutant primase that synthesizes primers from DNA building blocks (dNTPs) instead of RNA building blocks (rNTPs). This scenario will challenge you to think about the entire replication process, revealing how the cell distinguishes and removes primers to create a final, seamless DNA molecule and underscoring the importance of the primer's chemical identity for the completion of replication [@problem_id:1512951].", "problem": "In a hypothetical prokaryotic organism, a researcher identifies a strain with a mutation in the gene encoding primase. This mutant primase exhibits an unusual activity: it frequently incorporates deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) into the primers it synthesizes, instead of the canonical ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs). Assume all other components of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication machinery, including DNA Polymerase I, DNA Polymerase III, and DNA ligase, are wild-type and fully functional. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this mutation on the synthesis of the lagging strand?\n\nA. DNA Polymerase III will be unable to initiate synthesis from these mutant primers, preventing the formation of Okazaki fragments.\n\nB. The mutant DNA-based primers will be more rapidly degraded by cellular nucleases, leading to incomplete DNA replication.\n\nC. The leading strand will be synthesized normally, but the lagging strand will fail to be synthesized entirely.\n\nD. The mutant primers will be incorporated into the lagging strand but will fail to be removed by DNA Polymerase I, resulting in a chimeric DNA strand.\n\nE. DNA ligase will be unable to join the Okazaki fragments because it cannot recognize the junctions containing the mutant primers.", "solution": "In wild-type bacterial lagging-strand synthesis, primase synthesizes short RNA primers using rNTPs. DNA Polymerase III extends each primer because a pre-existing base-paired primer with a free 3' hydroxyl is the only requirement for synthesis; the chemical identity of the primer as RNA versus DNA is not required for extension. After DNA Polymerase III completes an Okazaki fragment, RNA primers are removed primarily during Okazaki fragment processing: in canonical textbook descriptions, RNase H degrades RNA in RNA–DNA hybrids and DNA Polymerase I removes the remaining primer region via its 5' to 3' exonuclease while simultaneously filling in with DNA. DNA ligase then seals the remaining nick once a 3' hydroxyl and a 5' phosphate are properly aligned.\n\nIn the mutant described, primase frequently incorporates dNTPs, generating DNA-based primers. The immediate consequences follow from the above principles:\n\n1) DNA Polymerase III initiation from the primer: DNA Polymerase III requires only a base-paired 3' hydroxyl to initiate extension. A DNA primer supplies this just as well as an RNA primer. Therefore, initiation and extension to form Okazaki fragments will proceed; this rules out statement A and, by extension, rules out C, which asserts a complete failure of lagging-strand synthesis.\n\n2) Stability of the primer: DNA is chemically more stable than RNA in cells because RNA’s 2' hydroxyl promotes backbone cleavage and is a target for RNases that specifically recognize RNA. There is no basis to assert DNA primers would be more rapidly degraded; thus B is inaccurate.\n\n3) Okazaki fragment processing and primer removal: Primer removal in normal cells is driven by enzymes that specifically target RNA in RNA–DNA hybrids (e.g., RNase H) and by the 5' to 3' exonuclease-coupled nick translation of DNA Polymerase I that, in canonical descriptions, is highlighted for removal of RNA primers. If primers are DNA rather than RNA, they will not be substrates for RNase H, and the specific RNA-targeted removal pathway is not engaged. Consequently, the most accurate outcome among the choices is that the DNA primers will be incorporated and will fail to be removed by the standard RNA-primer removal machinery, leaving primer-derived sequences in the lagging strand; this corresponds to a chimeric lagging strand in which primer-derived DNA persists. This matches statement D better than any other option.\n\n4) DNA ligase action: DNA ligase seals nicks between DNA segments after primer removal and gap filling; there is no inherent inability to recognize junctions simply because the primer was DNA, and thus E is not the primary consequence.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best answer is that the mutant DNA primers will be incorporated and will fail to be removed by DNA Polymerase I during the usual RNA-primer removal process, producing a chimeric DNA strand, which corresponds to D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1512951"}]}
