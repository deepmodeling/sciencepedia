This enzyme is known to introduce negative supercoils into the DNA. It accomplishes this by passing one segment of the DNA double helix through another, a process that consumes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and changes the linking number by -2 for each complete catalytic cycle.\n\nAfter the reaction is allowed to proceed, the biochemist determines that the enzyme has completed exactly 15 catalytic cycles before it is inactivated.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1530185] challenges you to predict the outcome of a classic molecular biology technique—agarose gel electrophoresis—used to analyze DNA topoisomers. Understanding why supercoiled and relaxed DNA molecules migrate differently is crucial for interpreting experimental data and appreciating the physical consequences of topological changes.", "problem": "A molecular biology researcher isolates a pure, covalently closed, circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid from a bacterial culture. Due to the action of cellular enzymes, this plasmid is in a negatively supercoiled conformation. The researcher divides the plasmid sample into two aliquots, labeled Sample A and Sample B.\n\n- Sample A serves as the untreated control.\n- Sample B is treated with an appropriate concentration of a purified enzyme, Topoisomerase I. This enzyme functions by creating a transient single-stranded nick in the DNA backbone, allowing the DNA to unwind and relieve torsional stress, before resealing the nick. This process changes the linking number of the circular DNA.\n\nAfter the enzymatic reaction in Sample B is complete, both Sample A and Sample B are loaded into separate lanes of an agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Agarose gel electrophoresis separates DNA molecules based on their properties, with more compact structures migrating faster through the gel matrix than less compact structures of the same mass.\n\nWhich of the following statements best predicts the appearance of the DNA on the gel after visualization?\n\nA. Sample B will display a single, sharp band that has migrated farther down the gel (faster) than the main band in Sample A.\n\nB. Sample B will display a single, sharp band that has migrated a shorter distance down the gel (slower) than the main band in Sample A.\n\nC. The DNA in Sample B will appear as a ladder of distinct bands, with the entire group of bands migrating, on average, a shorter distance down the gel (slower) than the main band in Sample A.\n\nD. Both samples will appear identical because Topoisomerase I only changes the topology of the DNA, not its molecular weight, which is the sole determinant of migration speed.\n\nE. The lane for Sample B will be empty because Topoisomerase I is a nuclease that completely degrades circular DNA into small fragments.", "solution": "We begin with the topology of covalently closed circular DNA. For a closed circular duplex with no strand breaks, the linking number $Lk$ is a topological invariant and satisfies the relation $Lk = Tw + Wr$, where $Tw$ is the twist (helical winding of the two strands around each other) and $Wr$ is the writhe (superhelical coiling of the duplex axis). The relaxed linking number is $Lk_{0}$, and negative supercoiling corresponds to $Wr < 0$ such that $Lk < Lk_{0}$.\n\nIn Sample A (untreated), the plasmid remains negatively supercoiled. Negative supercoiling increases compaction because writhe introduces plectonemic superhelices, making the DNA more compact. In agarose electrophoresis, for DNA molecules of identical mass, more compact conformations migrate faster; therefore, negatively supercoiled DNA migrates farther (faster) than relaxed closed circular or nicked open circular forms.\n\nTopoisomerase I acts by making a transient single-strand break, permitting controlled rotation that changes $Tw$ and $Wr$, and thereby changes $Lk$ in integer steps of $\\Delta Lk = \\pm 1$ per catalytic cycle, before resealing the nick. Because $Lk$ can change by single units, the enzyme progressively relieves the negative supercoiling, driving $Lk$ toward $Lk_{0}$ (relaxed). The outcome after reaction is not a single unique $Lk$ species but a population of closed circular topoisomers with $Lk$ values differing by integers clustered around $Lk_{0}$. These topoisomers, having different degrees of residual supercoiling (with $Wr$ near $0$ for the most relaxed), have distinct mobilities and can resolve into a ladder of bands on agarose gels. Relative to the negatively supercoiled form, these relaxed and near-relaxed topoisomers are less compact and therefore migrate more slowly (shorter distance) than the main supercoiled band in the untreated sample.\n\nTherefore:\n- Sample A: predominantly negatively supercoiled, fast-migrating band.\n- Sample B: a ladder of topoisomers centered near relaxed $Lk_{0}$, each less compact than the supercoiled form, so the group migrates, on average, a shorter distance than Sample A’s main band.\n\nThus, the best prediction is that Sample B appears as a ladder of bands migrating overall more slowly than Sample A, which matches option C. Options A and B incorrectly predict faster migration or a single sharp band, respectively; D is incorrect because conformation (not only mass) affects mobility; E is incorrect because Topoisomerase I is not a nonspecific nuclease and does not degrade DNA into small fragments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1530185"}, {"introduction": "Finally, let's apply our knowledge to a critical biological context to understand *why* cells invest energy in maintaining a specific level of DNA supercoiling. This problem [@problem_id:1530176] uses a hypothetical biophysical model to link the superhelical density ($\\sigma$) of a chromosome to the rate of DNA replication initiation. By calculating the impact of reduced supercoiling, you will gain insight into the essential role of enzymes like DNA gyrase in fundamental cellular processes.", "problem": "In a laboratory study of bacterial DNA replication, a strain of bacteria possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene for DNA gyrase, a type of topoisomerase crucial for managing DNA topology.
