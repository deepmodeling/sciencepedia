{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The process of DNA replication begins with the unwinding of the double helix, a task performed by an enzyme called helicase. This action creates the replication fork but is not without cost; it requires a significant energy investment in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). This first exercise allows you to calculate the energetic toll of unwinding a bacterial plasmid, connecting the molecular action of helicase to the macroscopic requirements of replicating an entire piece of DNA. [@problem_id:1517713]", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the energetic cost of DNA replication for a newly discovered circular plasmid in a bacterial species. The plasmid, designated pBio-1, has a total length of 4,850 base pairs (bp). Replication of this plasmid is known to initiate at a single origin of replication and proceed bidirectionally, forming two replication forks that travel in opposite directions around the plasmid until they meet. The primary enzyme that unwinds the DNA double helix at each fork is a helicase. Experimental measurements have determined that this specific helicase hydrolyzes exactly two molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) for each base pair it separates.\n\nAssuming that the activity of the helicase is the sole contributor to the ATP consumption for unwinding the DNA, calculate the total number of ATP molecules required by the helicase enzymes to complete the replication of one entire pBio-1 plasmid molecule.", "solution": "Let the plasmid length be $L=4850$ base pairs. Replication initiates at a single origin and proceeds bidirectionally, creating two forks. Each base pair is unwound exactly once in total, so the total number of base pairs separated during one complete round of replication is $L$.\n\nThe helicase hydrolyzes $c=2$ ATP molecules per base pair separated. Therefore, the total ATP molecules hydrolyzed by helicase activity to unwind the entire plasmid is\n$$\nN_{\\text{ATP}}=c \\times L.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nN_{\\text{ATP}}=2 \\times 4850=9700.\n$$\nEquivalently, viewing the bidirectional forks explicitly: each fork unwinds $L/2$ base pairs, consuming $c \\times \\frac{L}{2}$ ATP; with two forks, the total is $2 \\times c \\times \\frac{L}{2}=cL$, which yields the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9700}$$", "id": "1517713"}, {"introduction": "At each replication fork, the two new DNA strands are synthesized differently due to the antiparallel nature of the template and the strict 5' to 3' directionality of DNA polymerase. While the leading strand is made continuously, the lagging strand is assembled in short, discontinuous pieces called Okazaki fragments. This practice will help you quantify the scale of this complex process by estimating the total number of Okazaki fragments produced during the replication of a eukaryotic chromosome.

Consider a single, linear chromosome from a hypothetical organism that has a length of 150 million base pairs (bp). DNA replication in this organism initiates at multiple Origins of Replication (ORIs) along the chromosome and proceeds bidirectionally from each origin. Due to the antiparallel nature of the DNA double helix and the constraint that DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in the 5' to 3' direction, one new strand (the leading strand) is synthesized continuously at each replication fork, while the other new strand (the lagging strand) is synthesized discontinuously as a series of short fragments known as Okazaki fragments. These fragments are subsequently ligated to form a continuous strand.\n\nGiven that the average length of an Okazaki fragment in this organism is 200 nucleotides, calculate the total number of Okazaki fragments generated during the complete replication of this single chromosome.", "solution": "Let the chromosome length be $L=150 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs. Replicating a double-stranded DNA molecule of length $L$ bp produces two daughter strands, totaling $2L$ nucleotides of newly synthesized DNA. At every replication fork, one daughter strand is synthesized as a leading strand and the other as a lagging strand; therefore, exactly half of the newly synthesized nucleotides are made via lagging-strand synthesis. Hence, the total number of nucleotides synthesized as lagging strand is $L$.\n\nLet the average Okazaki fragment length be $\\ell=200$ nucleotides. The total number of Okazaki fragments produced is the total lagging-strand nucleotides divided by the average fragment length:\n$$\nN=\\frac{L}{\\ell}=\\frac{150 \\times 10^{6}}{200}.\n$$\nSimplifying,\n$$\nN=\\frac{150}{2} \\times 10^{6-2}=75 \\times 10^{4}=7.5 \\times 10^{5}.\n$$\nThus, the total number of Okazaki fragments generated is $7.5 \\times 10^{5}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.5 \\times 10^{5}}$$", "id": "1517700"}, {"introduction": "Most organisms, from bacteria to humans, employ a bidirectional replication strategy where two replication forks move in opposite directions from an origin of replication.
