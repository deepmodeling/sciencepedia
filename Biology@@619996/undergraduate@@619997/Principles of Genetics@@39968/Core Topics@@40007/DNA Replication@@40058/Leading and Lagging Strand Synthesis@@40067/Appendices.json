Because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the $3'$ end of a growing strand, and the two parental strands are antiparallel, synthesis must proceed differently on each template. This exercise [@problem_id:2321129] challenges you to visualize a replication bubble and apply the core principles of directionality to determine which parental strands serve as the template for continuous, or \"leading,\" strand synthesis at each of the two advancing replication forks.", "problem": "A biologist is studying the genome of a newly discovered virus, which consists of a single, linear, double-stranded molecule of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). For ease of analysis, the two strands are designated as the \"top strand\" and the \"bottom strand\". The top strand is oriented 5' to 3' when read from left to right along the molecule. Consequently, the bottom strand, being antiparallel, is oriented 3' to 5' when read from left to right.\n\nDNA replication in this virus initiates at a single origin located exactly at the molecule's midpoint. This initiation event unwinds the DNA, creating a replication bubble. From this bubble, two replication forks emerge and proceed in opposite directions: one fork moves towards the right end of the molecule (the rightward-moving fork), and the other moves towards the left end (the leftward-moving fork).\n\nNew DNA strands are synthesized within this bubble, using the parental strands as templates. Given the fundamental enzymatic properties of DNA polymerases, which of the following choices correctly identifies the parental strand(s) used as a template for *leading strand synthesis*?\n\nA. Leading strand synthesis occurs on the top strand template for both the leftward-moving and rightward-moving forks.\n\nB. Leading strand synthesis occurs on the bottom strand template for both the leftward-moving and rightward-moving forks.\n\nC. Leading strand synthesis uses the top strand as a template for the leftward-moving fork and the bottom strand as a template for the rightward-moving fork.\n\nD. Leading strand synthesis uses the bottom strand as a template for the leftward-moving fork and the top strand as a template for the rightward-moving fork.", "solution": "First, recall the enzymatic and directional rules governing DNA synthesis:\n- DNA polymerases synthesize new DNA only in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction while reading the template strand in the $3' \\to 5'$ direction.\n- The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork; the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in the direction opposite to fork movement.\n\nNext, establish the polarity of the parental strands along the molecule from left to right:\n- The top strand is oriented $5' \\to 3'$ (left to right).\n- The bottom strand is oriented $3' \\to 5'$ (left to right).\n\nConsider the rightward-moving fork (advancing to the right):\n- Leading strand synthesis must proceed to the right. For a polymerase to move rightward while reading the template $3' \\to 5'$, the template must itself be oriented $3' \\to 5'$ from left to right. This matches the bottom strand. Therefore, at the rightward fork, the bottom strand is the template for leading strand synthesis.\n\nConsider the leftward-moving fork (advancing to the left):\n- Leading strand synthesis must proceed to the left. For a polymerase to move leftward while reading the template $3' \\to 5'$, the template must present $3'$ toward the origin and $5'$ toward the left. Reading the top strand from right to left follows $3' \\to 5'$ (since the top strand is $5' \\to 3'$ left to right). Therefore, at the leftward fork, the top strand is the template for leading strand synthesis.\n\nThus, leading strand synthesis uses the top strand as template at the leftward-moving fork and the bottom strand as template at the rightward-moving fork, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321129"}, {"introduction": "While the leading strand is synthesized in one continuous piece, the lagging strand is built from many small Okazaki fragments that must be stitched together perfectly. This maturation process requires a coordinated effort from several enzymes, with DNA Polymerase I playing a key role in prokaryotes. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2321161] explores the consequences of a specific mutation in DNA Polymerase I, pushing you to deduce the function of its different enzymatic activities by predicting the molecular structure that would accumulate when one of them is disabled.", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a researcher has created a mutant strain of *Escherichia coli* with a specific defect in its Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication machinery. The mutation is in the *polA* gene, which encodes for DNA Polymerase I. This particular mutation completely inactivates the 5'→3' exonuclease activity of the enzyme but leaves its 5'→3' polymerase activity and its 3'→5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity fully intact. All other replication enzymes, such as DNA Polymerase III, primase, helicase, and DNA ligase, are normal.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best characterizes the molecular intermediate that would most likely accumulate at the replication fork in these mutant cells during lagging strand synthesis?\n\nA. Fully synthesized Okazaki fragments separated from each other by gaps of single-stranded DNA where the RNA primers have been removed.\n\nB.

A buildup of free, unincorporated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) as DNA synthesis is completely halted on both the leading and lagging strands.", "solution": "The question asks to identify the specific molecular structure that would accumulate during lagging strand DNA synthesis in an *E. coli* mutant where DNA Polymerase I lacks its 5'→3' exonuclease activity. To solve this, we must analyze the specific roles of the enzymes involved in processing Okazaki fragments.\n\n**Step 1: Review of Normal Lagging Strand Synthesis**\n\nFirst, let's review the normal sequence of events for joining Okazaki fragments in wild-type *E. coli*:\n1.  **Priming and Elongation**: The enzyme primase synthesizes a short RNA primer on the lagging strand template. DNA Polymerase III then binds to the primer and elongates it by adding deoxyribonucleotides in the 5'→3' direction, creating an Okazaki fragment. This synthesis continues until DNA Pol III encounters the 5' end of the RNA primer from the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment.\n2.  **Primer Removal and Gap Filling**: DNA Polymerase III dissociates. DNA Polymerase I then binds to the junction. Its role here is twofold, in a process often called nick translation:\n    *   The **5'→3' exonuclease** activity removes the ribonucleotides of the RNA primer of the preceding fragment one by one.\n    *   Simultaneously, the **5'→3' polymerase** activity fills the resulting gap with the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides.\n3.  **Ligation**: After DNA Polymerase I has replaced all the RNA with DNA, a single phosphodiester bond is missing between the 3'-hydroxyl end of the newly synthesized DNA and the 5'-phosphate end of the preceding Okazaki fragment. This \"nick\" is sealed by the enzyme **DNA ligase**, which creates the final phosphodiester bond, resulting in a continuous DNA strand.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Effect of the Mutation**\n\nThe problem states that the mutant DNA Polymerase I has lost its **5'→3' exonuclease** activity, but its 5'→3' polymerase and 3'→5' proofreading activities are intact.\n*   The synthesis of Okazaki fragments by primase and DNA Polymerase III (Step 1) is unaffected. A new Okazaki fragment will be synthesized correctly up to the RNA primer of the previous fragment.\n*   At this point, the mutant DNA Polymerase I will bind to the site. However, because its 5'→3' exonuclease activity is missing, it **cannot remove the RNA primer** of the preceding fragment.\n*   Since the primer is not removed, there is no gap for the 5'→3' polymerase activity of the enzyme to fill. The polymerase function is intact but has no template gap to work on.\n*   Consequently, the RNA primer remains in place. DNA ligase cannot function here because its substrate is a nick between two DNA strands (a 3'-OH on one DNA strand and a 5'-monophosphate on the adjacent DNA strand). It cannot ligate a DNA strand to an RNA strand.\n*   Therefore, the replication process on the lagging strand stalls at this step. The result is the accumulation of fully synthesized but unjoined Okazaki fragments. Each fragment consists of its DNA segment ending right next to the intact RNA primer of the fragment ahead of it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A. Fully synthesized Okazaki fragments separated from each other by gaps of single-stranded DNA where the RNA primers have been removed.** This is incorrect. This structure would accumulate if the 5'→3' exonuclease of DNA Pol I was functional (to remove the primer) but its 5'→3' polymerase activity was defective (unable to fill the gap). This is the opposite of the specified mutation.\n*   **B. A continuous, covalently sealed lagging strand that contains short segments of RNA interspersed within the DNA backbone.** This is incorrect. DNA ligase cannot seal the nick when an RNA primer is present. Therefore, the strand would not be continuous or covalently sealed.\n*   **C. Unprocessed Okazaki fragments, where the DNA of one fragment is adjacent to the intact RNA primer of the preceding fragment, and the two are not covalently joined.** This is the correct description. The DNA of the newly made fragment (let's call it fragment n+1) stops at the 5' end of the RNA primer of the previous fragment (fragment n). Because the 5'→3' exonuclease is inactive, this RNA primer is not removed, and because the primer is not removed, ligation cannot occur. This is the exact intermediate that will accumulate.\n*   **D. A buildup of free, unincorporated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) as DNA synthesis is completely halted on both the leading and lagging strands.** This is incorrect. Leading strand synthesis is continuous and does not require Okazaki fragment processing, so it is largely unaffected by this specific Pol I defect. On the lagging strand, DNA synthesis by Pol III still occurs to create the fragments. The halt is specific to fragment processing, not the initial synthesis, so a general buildup of all dNTPs due to a complete halt is not the primary outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321161"}, {"introduction": "The intricate dance of proteins at the replication fork is not only a feat of molecular choreography but also a significant energetic expense for the cell. On the lagging strand, every single Okazaki fragment requires its own setup, including the loading of a sliding clamp to keep DNA polymerase tethered to the template.

The synthesis of the lagging strand is discontinuous, proceeding via short segments known as Okazaki fragments. Each fragment's synthesis is initiated from an RNA primer, and processivity is ensured by a ring-shaped sliding clamp protein that encircles the DNA. This clamp is loaded onto each new primer-template junction by a multi-protein complex called the clamp loader. The loading process is an active, energy-dependent mechanism.\n\nExperimental data from *B. quanticus* shows that the clamp loader hydrolyzes exactly 3 molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to ADP and inorganic phosphate for each successful loading of a sliding clamp onto the DNA.\n\nConsider a segment of the *B. quanticus* chromosome where a 100 kilobase (kb) long region is being replicated. You are asked to determine the total energetic cost, in terms of ATP molecules hydrolyzed by the clamp loader, specifically for the complete synthesis of the lagging strand corresponding to this 100 kb region. Assume that the average length of an Okazaki fragment in this organism is 200 base pairs (bp).\n\nCalculate the total number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed by the clamp loader to facilitate the synthesis of this entire 100 kb lagging strand. Your final answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "The lagging strand is synthesized as Okazaki fragments, each initiated at a primer-template junction. For each fragment, a sliding clamp must be loaded once, and the clamp loader hydrolyzes exactly 3 ATP per successful loading event. Therefore, the total ATP hydrolyzed equals the number of Okazaki fragments multiplied by 3.\n\nLet the replicated length be $L$ and the average fragment size be $s$. Given $L=10^{5}\\,\\text{bp}$ and $s=200\\,\\text{bp}$, the number of fragments is\n$$\nn=\\frac{L}{s}=\\frac{10^{5}}{200}=\\frac{10^{5}}{2\\cdot 10^{2}}=\\frac{10^{3}}{2}=500.\n$$\nWith 3 ATP hydrolyzed per fragment, the total ATP count is\n$$\nN_{\\text{ATP}}=3\\times n=3\\times 500=1500.\n$$\nThus, the clamp loader hydrolyzes 1500 ATP molecules to facilitate synthesis of the 100 kb lagging strand region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1500}$$", "id": "2055314"}]}
