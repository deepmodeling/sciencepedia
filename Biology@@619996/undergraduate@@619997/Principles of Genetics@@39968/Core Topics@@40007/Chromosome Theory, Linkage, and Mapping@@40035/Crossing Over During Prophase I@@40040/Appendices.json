An individual is produced from a cross between two homozygous parents, one with genotype $AAbb$ and the other with genotype $aaBB$. This F1 individual, which has the genotype $Ab/aB$, undergoes meiosis.

Each contributes one homologous chromosome to the F1. The F1 receives the chromosome carrying $Ab$ from the $AAbb$ parent and the chromosome carrying $aB$ from the $aaBB$ parent, giving the F1 genotype $Ab/aB$. \n\nBefore meiosis I, during S phase, each homolog replicates to form two identical sister chromatids. Thus, prior to crossing over, the tetrad contains four chromatids: two sister chromatids with $Ab$ and two sister chromatids with $aB$.\n\nA single crossover between loci $A$ and $B$ occurs during prophase I and involves only two nonsister chromatids. Because the exchange is between the loci $A$ and $B$, the allelic segments distal to the crossover point are swapped between the participating chromatids. This produces two recombinant chromatids and leaves the two nonparticipating chromatids unchanged.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The two chromatids that do not participate in the crossover remain parental: one $Ab$ and one $aB$.\n- The two chromatids that participate in the crossover exchange the segments between $A$ and $B$, producing recombinants: one $AB$ and one $ab$.\n\nTherefore, after a single crossover between $A$ and $B$, the four resulting chromatids in the tetrad are $Ab$, $aB$, $AB$, and $ab$.
