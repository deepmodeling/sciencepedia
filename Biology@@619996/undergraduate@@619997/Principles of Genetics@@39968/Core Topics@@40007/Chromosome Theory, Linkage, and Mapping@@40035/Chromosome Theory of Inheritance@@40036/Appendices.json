This practice [@problem_id:1476986] anchors this theory in a tangible biological context, the alternation of generations in ferns. By tracking the chromosome number from the diploid ($2n$) sporophyte to the haploid ($n$) gametophyte and back to the zygote, you will solidify your understanding of how meiosis and fertilization maintain the characteristic chromosome count of a species.", "problem": "A botanist specializing in paleobiology is studying a newly discovered species of living fossil fern. Through karyotyping, it is determined that the somatic cells, taken from the fronds of the mature fern (the sporophyte stage), contain 84 chromosomes. The life cycle of this fern follows the typical pattern of alternation of generations. The diploid sporophyte ($2n$) produces haploid spores ($n$) through the process of meiosis. These spores, when they land on a suitable substrate, germinate and grow into a small, independent, heart-shaped organism called a gametophyte. The gametophyte is haploid ($n$) and produces gametes (egg and sperm) via mitosis. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell, forming a diploid zygote ($2n$), which then develops into a new sporophyte, completing the cycle.\n\nBased on this complete biological description, determine the number of chromosomes you would expect to find in a single cell of the fern's gametophyte and in the zygote, respectively. Your answer should be a pair of integers.", "solution": "The problem states that the somatic cells of the mature fern (the sporophyte, which is diploid) contain 84 chromosomes. By definition of diploidy in this life cycle, the sporophyte has chromosome number $2n$, so:\n$$\n2n = 84.\n$$\nSolving for the haploid number $n$ gives:\n$$\nn = \\frac{84}{2} = 42.\n$$\nIn alternation of generations, meiosis in the diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores, so the gametophyte that develops from these spores is haploid with $n$ chromosomes. Therefore, a single cell of the gametophyte has:\n$$\nn = 42 \\text{ chromosomes}.\n$$\nGametes are produced by mitosis in the haploid gametophyte and thus are also $n=42$. At fertilization, fusion of two haploid gametes restores diploidy, producing a zygote with:\n$$\n2n = 84 \\text{ chromosomes}.\n$$\nThus, the expected chromosome numbers are $42$ for the gametophyte cell and $84$ for the zygote.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}42 & 84\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1476986"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful predictions of the Chromosome Theory is that the frequency of recombination between linked genes reflects their physical distance on a chromosome. This exercise [@problem_id:1477007] provides a classic hands-on opportunity to apply this principle. You will analyze data from a dihybrid test cross to translate offspring phenotypes into a quantitative measure of genetic distance, taking your first step into the world of gene mapping.", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the gene for body color and the gene for wing shape are located on the same chromosome. The allele for a wild-type gray body ($b^{+}$) is dominant over the allele for a black body ($b$), and the allele for wild-type normal wings ($vg^{+}$) is dominant over the allele for vestigial wings ($vg$).\n\nTo investigate the genetic linkage between these two genes, a geneticist performs a cross. A female fly, which was produced from the mating of a pure-breeding gray-bodied, normal-winged fly with a pure-breeding black-bodied, vestigial-winged fly, is mated with a black-bodied, vestigial-winged male fly. This cross produces 1000 offspring with the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- 382 flies with gray bodies and normal wings\n- 378 flies with black bodies and vestigial wings\n- 121 flies with gray bodies and vestigial wings\n- 119 flies with black bodies and normal wings\n\nBased on these results, calculate the genetic map distance between the body color gene and the wing shape gene.

This advanced practice [@problem_id:1477013] challenges you not only to determine the order of three linked genes but also to investigate the relationship between crossover events. By calculating genetic interference, you will explore the fascinating biological reality that the formation of one crossover can influence the probability of another nearby, revealing deeper insights into the physical mechanics of recombination.", "problem": "In an agricultural genetics program, researchers are studying three linked genes in a novel plant species, *Solanum fictitium*.

The resulting F1 trihybrid progeny were then test-crossed with a plant expressing all three recessive phenotypes (smooth leaves, yellow fruit, smooth stem). A total of 2000 offspring were produced from this test cross, with the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Jagged leaves, purple fruit, hairy stem: 759\n- smooth leaves, yellow fruit, smooth stem: 759\n- Jagged leaves, yellow fruit, hairy stem: 141\n- smooth leaves, purple fruit, smooth stem: 141\n- Jagged leaves, purple fruit, smooth stem: 91\n- smooth leaves, yellow fruit, hairy stem: 91\n- Jagged leaves, yellow fruit, smooth stem: 9\n- smooth leaves, purple fruit, hairy stem: 9\n\nBased on these data, a crossover event in one region appears to influence the probability of a crossover in the adjacent region.
