They have discovered a new recessive mutation, designated $hps$, which confers higher protein content in the seeds but unfortunately also leads to a slightly brittle stalk. They wish to map this new gene relative to two well-characterized marker genes on chromosome 3H. The first marker gene controls awn length, with the dominant allele $L$ resulting in long awns and the recessive allele $l$ resulting in short awns. The second marker gene affects leaf color, with the dominant allele $Y$ producing yellow-green leaves and the recessive allele $y$ producing dark green leaves. The wild-type allele for the new gene is $hps^+$, which corresponds to normal protein content.\n\nTo initiate the mapping, a true-breeding barley plant with long awns, yellow-green leaves, and normal protein content was crossed with a true-breeding plant with short awns, dark green leaves, and high protein content.
