An individual plant that is heterozygous for all three genes is crossed with a plant that is homozygous recessive for all three genes. The heterozygous parent has the genotype `D F s / d f S`, meaning the alleles `D`, `F`, and `s` are on one chromosome, and `d`, `f`, and `S` are on the homologous chromosome.\n\nGenetic mapping has established that the gene order is D-F-S. The distance between gene `D` and gene `F` is 15 map units (m.u.), and the distance between gene `F` and gene `S` is 10 m.u. Assume that there is no chromosomal interference.

For s C L versus S C L, only the S locus differs; for S c l versus s c l, only the S locus differs. Thus, the middle gene is S, giving the order C - S - L.\n\nWith order C - S - L, the crossover classes are:\n- Single crossover (SCO) in C-S: C s l and c S L with counts 44 and 46.\n- Single crossover (SCO) in S-L: C S l and c s L with counts 48 and 52.\n- Double crossovers (DCO): C s L and c S l with counts 6 and 4.\n\nLet the total progeny be $N=1000$.

The largest classes are $a^{+}b^{+}c^{+}$ (690) and $abc$ (670), so the F1 gametes are in coupling as $[a^{+}b^{+}c^{+}]/[abc]$.\n\nDouble crossovers (DCO) are identified by the rule that, relative to a parental gamete, only the middle gene changes in a DCO. There are two candidate reciprocal low-count pairs:\n- $a^{+}b^{+}c$ (33) and $ab c^{+}$ (37) differ from $a^{+}b^{+}c^{+}$ and $abc$ only at $c$, implying $c$ would be the middle gene if these were DCO.\n- $a^{+}b c^{+}$ (26) and $ab^{+}c$ (24) differ from $a^{+}b^{+}c^{+}$ and $abc$ only at $b$, implying $b$ would be the middle gene if these were DCO.\n\nTo decide definitively, test each hypothesis for consistency of single-crossover (SCO) versus DCO frequencies in each interval.

Hence, $b$ is definitively the middle gene and the gene order is $a$-$b$-$c$.\n\nWith $b$ in the middle, the recombination fraction between $b$ and $c$ is computed by adding the SCO in the $b$–$c$ interval and the DCO:\n$$\nr_{bc} \\;=\\; \\frac{(33+37) + (26+24)}{2000} \\;=\\; \\frac{120}{2000} \\;=\\; 0.06.\n$$\nExpressed as a map distance, this is $0.06 \\times 100=6.00$ map units, rounded to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.00}$$", "id": "1529959"}]}
