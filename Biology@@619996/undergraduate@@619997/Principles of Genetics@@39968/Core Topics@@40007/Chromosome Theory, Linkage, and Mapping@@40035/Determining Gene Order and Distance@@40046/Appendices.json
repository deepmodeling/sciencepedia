They are investigating the genetic linkage between two traits: the color and the intensity of the light produced.\n\nThe gene for color has two alleles: a dominant allele $C$ which results in a cool blue glow, and a recessive allele $c$ which results in a warm yellow glow. The gene for intensity also has two alleles: a dominant allele $I$ which produces a bright light, and a recessive allele $i$ which produces a dim light.\n\nTo map these genes, a test cross is performed. A fungal individual that is heterozygous for both genes ($CcIi$) is crossed with an individual that is homozygous recessive for both genes ($ccii$). This cross yields 1752 offspring colonies. The phenotypes of these colonies are categorized as follows:\n\n- 715 colonies exhibit a cool blue, bright glow.\n- 721 colonies exhibit a warm yellow, dim glow.\n- 155 colonies exhibit a cool blue, dim glow.\n- 161 colonies exhibit a warm yellow, bright glow.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the recombination frequency between the gene for color ($C/c$) and the gene for intensity ($I/i$).
