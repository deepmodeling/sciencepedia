{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The study of genetics in fungi like *Sordaria* or *Neurospora* offers a unique window into the process of meiosis. Because the spores are held in a sac, or ascus, in the precise order they were created, we can directly observe the segregation of alleles. This first practice challenges you to visualize the fundamental outcomes for a single gene, distinguishing between patterns that arise with and without crossing over between the gene and the centromere [@problem_id:1525397]. Mastering these basic patterns is the first step toward using tetrad analysis for genetic mapping.", "problem": "In the Ascomycete fungus *Sordaria fimicola*, a cross between two haploid strains can produce a diploid zygote. This zygote is contained within a sac-like structure called an ascus. The zygote undergoes meiosis, followed by a single round of mitosis, to produce eight haploid ascospores, arranged linearly in what is known as an ordered octad. The linear arrangement of these spores directly reflects the segregation of chromosomes during the two meiotic divisions.\n\nConsider a cross between a wild-type strain that produces black ascospores (allele $B$) and a mutant strain that produces tan ascospores (allele $b$). The resulting diploid zygote has the genotype $Bb$. The different linear arrangements of black and tan spores in the octad are determined by whether a crossover event occurs between the gene locus and the centromere.\n\nAn analysis of the progeny from such a cross reveals a set of distinct patterns of black (B) and tan (T) spores within the octads.

The zygote undergoes meiosis I (MI), meiosis II (MII), and then a single mitosis, yielding eight spores arranged linearly. Two key constraints follow from these processes:\n\n1) Post-meiotic mitosis creates adjacent identical sister spores. Therefore, any valid octad pattern must be composed of adjacent identical pairs.\n\n2) With a single gene and no gene conversion (the problem specifies segregation patterns determined by crossover between the gene and centromere, not conversion), the total numbers must be four $B$ spores (black) and four $T$ spores (tan).\n\nSegregation relative to the centromere yields two classes:\n\n- First-division segregation (FDS), when there is no crossover between the gene and the centromere, places the two alleles into different halves at MI. After MII and mitosis, this yields a $4:4$ arrangement, in two orientations:\n  - `BBBBTTTT`\n  - `TTTTBBBB`\n\n- Second-division segregation (SDS), when there is a crossover between the gene and the centromere, yields patterns in which alleles segregate at MII.

You will explore what happens in the extreme case where a gene is located precisely at its centromere [@problem_id:1525413]. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you will clarify the crucial role that chromosomal crossover plays in generating second-division segregation (SDS) patterns, a key principle in calculating gene-to-centromere distances.", "problem": "In fungal genetics, the analysis of ordered asci, such as those produced by the fungus *Neurospora crassa*, provides a direct way to observe the results of meiosis. A cross is performed between two haploid strains of a fungus: one with the genotype for spore color determined by allele $G$ (black) and the other by allele $g$ (gray). After meiosis and a subsequent round of mitosis, a diploid zygote produces an ascus containing eight ordered ascospores. The arrangement of these spores can reveal the segregation pattern of the alleles.\n\nA pattern of four adjacent black spores and four adjacent gray spores (e.g., `GGGGgggg` or `ggggGGGG`) is known as First-Division Segregation (FDS). Any other arrangement, such as `GGggGGgg` or `ggGGggGG`, is known as Second-Division Segregation (SDS). The occurrence of SDS depends on crossing over between the gene's locus and the centromere of the chromosome.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where the gene for spore color ($G/g$) is located precisely at the centromere of its chromosome, meaning the distance between the gene locus and the centromere is effectively zero. Based on this information, what is the expected frequency of asci that will exhibit Second-Division Segregation (SDS)? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We consider the definition of segregation patterns in ordered octads. First-Division Segregation (FDS) yields a $4:4$ block pattern, while Second-Division Segregation (SDS) yields any non-$4:4$ pattern. SDS arises only when there is at least one crossover between the gene locus and the centromere during meiosis.\n\nLet the distance between the gene and the centromere be denoted by $d$. The fraction of SDS asci, denoted $f_{\\text{SDS}}$, is proportional to the probability of a crossover in the interval between the gene and the centromere. In standard ordered tetrad analysis, the gene-centromere distance in map units is related to the SDS frequency by\n$$\nd (\\text{in cM}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\% \\text{SDS asci}\n$$\nEquivalently, using first principles, if the locus lies exactly at the centromere, the length of the interval between the gene and the centromere is zero, so the probability of a crossover in that interval is\n$$\nP(\\text{CO between gene and centromere})=0.\n$$\nSince SDS patterns require such a crossover, it follows that the frequency of SDS asci must be zero.\n$$\nf_{\\text{SDS}}=0.\n$$\nTherefore, when the gene is located precisely at the centromere, all asci exhibit FDS and none exhibit SDS.\n\nHence, the expected frequency of SDS asci is $0$ (as a decimal).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1525413"}, {"introduction": "Now we move from theory into practice by simulating the analysis of real experimental data from the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
