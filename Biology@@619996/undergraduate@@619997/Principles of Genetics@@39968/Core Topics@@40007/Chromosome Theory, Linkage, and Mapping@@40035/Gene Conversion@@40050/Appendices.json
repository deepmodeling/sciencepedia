This exercise provides a fundamental exercise in quantitative genetics, demonstrating how to calculate the frequency of gene conversion directly from the raw counts of aberrant asci observed in a fungal cross. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward understanding the population-level impact of this important molecular process [@problem_id:1490077].", "problem": "A fungal geneticist is studying a locus that controls mycelium pigmentation in a hypothetical haploid ascomycete fungus. This fungus undergoes meiosis to produce unordered tetrads, where each ascus contains four haploid spores that are the direct products of a single meiotic division. A cross is performed between a wild-type strain carrying the allele $C^+$ (which yields a dark pigment) and a mutant strain carrying the allele $c$ (which results in an albino, unpigmented phenotype).\n\nThe progeny from this $C^+ \\times c$ cross are analyzed by dissecting individual asci and culturing the four spores from each to observe their resulting phenotypes. From a large sample, a total of 800 complete asci are successfully analyzed. The vast majority of these display the expected Mendelian segregation of 2 dark : 2 albino spores. However, the researcher identifies 4 asci that display an aberrant ratio of 1 dark : 3 albino spores.\n\nAssuming these aberrant asci are the result of gene conversion events where a $C^+$ allele was converted to a $c$ allele during meiosis, calculate the frequency of gene conversion per meiosis at this locus. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We define the total number of meioses analyzed as the number of complete asci, $N = 800$. The number of asci showing aberrant 1 dark : 3 albino segregation, attributed to gene conversion of a $C^+$ allele to $c$, is $n = 4$. In unordered tetrad analysis, a 3:1 phenotype ratio indicates a gene conversion event at the locus in that meiosis. Therefore, the gene conversion frequency per meiosis, $f$, is the proportion of meioses exhibiting such an event:\n$$\nf = \\frac{n}{N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values yields\n$$\nf = \\frac{4}{800} = \\frac{1}{200} = 0.005.\n$$\nThus, the frequency of gene conversion per meiosis at this locus is $0.005$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.005}$$", "id": "1490077"}, {"introduction": "The non-Mendelian ratios characteristic of gene conversion are a direct consequence of events at the DNA level, specifically the formation of heteroduplex DNA and the action of the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system. This thought experiment explores a hypothetical scenario where the MMR system is disabled, allowing us to directly observe the consequences of an unrepaired mismatch through meiosis and a subsequent mitosis. Understanding this phenomenon, known as post-meiotic segregation, is key to grasping the core molecular mechanism of gene conversion [@problem_id:1490076].", "problem": "In the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, meiosis is typically followed by one round of mitosis, resulting in an ordered ascus containing eight spores, known as an octad. Consider a diploid yeast strain that is heterozygous for a nutritional marker, with genotype *HIS4*⁺/*his4*⁻. The *HIS4*⁺ allele allows growth on a medium lacking histidine, while the *his4*⁻ allele does not. This strain is also engineered to be completely deficient in the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system.\n\nThe diploid cell enters meiosis. During prophase I, a gene conversion event is initiated. This event involves a short segment of a DNA strand from a chromatid carrying the *his4*⁻ allele invading and replacing the corresponding segment on a non-sister chromatid carrying the *HIS4*⁺ allele. This process creates a region of heteroduplex DNA on the formerly *HIS4*⁺ chromatid. Due to the MMR deficiency, the resulting base pair mismatch in this heteroduplex region is not repaired and persists through the completion of meiosis.\n\nAssuming this is the only recombination event affecting this locus, and that the segregation of chromosomes is otherwise normal, what will be the ratio of *HIS4*⁺ to *his4*⁻ spores in the resulting octad?\n\nA. 4 *HIS4*⁺ : 4 *his4*⁻\n\nB. 2 *HIS4*⁺ : 6 *his4*⁻\n\nC. 5 *HIS4*⁺ : 3 *his4*⁻\n\nD. 3 *HIS4*⁺ : 5 *his4*⁻\n\nE. 6 *HIS4*⁺ : 2 *his4*⁻", "solution": "Start with a diploid that is heterozygous at the *HIS4* locus: two sister chromatids carrying *HIS4*⁺ on one homolog and two sister chromatids carrying *his4*⁻ on the other homolog. Because the strain lacks Mismatch Repair (MMR), any base-pair mismatch created in heteroduplex DNA will not be corrected.\n\nDuring meiotic prophase I, a recombination event occurs in which a short segment from a strand of a *his4*⁻ chromatid invades and replaces the corresponding segment on a non-sister *HIS4*⁺ chromatid. As stated, this creates a region of heteroduplex DNA on the formerly *HIS4*⁺ chromatid, containing a base-pair mismatch at the *HIS4* site. The other three chromatids at this locus remain homoduplex: one *HIS4*⁺ sister chromatid unaffected, and the two *his4*⁻ chromatids unaffected.\n\nWith normal chromosomal segregation, each of the four chromatids proceeds into a different product of meiosis II (the four spores of a tetrad). In yeast octads, each of these four spores undergoes one mitotic division to yield a pair of cells, producing eight spores total. At this post-meiotic mitosis:\n- The spore that received the heteroduplex chromatid replicates that mismatched duplex and segregates the two sequence-different strands into different daughter cells, yielding one *HIS4*⁺ and one *his4*⁻ spore (post-meiotic segregation).\n- The spore that received the intact *HIS4*⁺ homoduplex chromatid produces two *HIS4*⁺ spores.\n- Each of the two spores that received a *his4*⁻ homoduplex chromatid produces two *his4*⁻ spores.\n\nTallying the eight spores:\n- From the heteroduplex-bearing spore: $1$ *HIS4*⁺ and $1$ *his4*⁻.\n- From the *HIS4*⁺ homoduplex spore: $2$ *HIS4*⁺.\n- From the two *his4*⁻ homoduplex spores: $2 + 2 = 4$ *his4*⁻.\n\nTherefore, the total is $3$ *HIS4*⁺ and $5$ *his4*⁻ spores, i.e., a $3:5$ ratio, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1490076"}, {"introduction": "In experimental genetics, it is crucial to distinguish between different molecular events that can sometimes produce similar outcomes. This problem challenges you to act as a geneticist, using data from a three-point cross with flanking markers to differentiate between a gene conversion event and a closely spaced double crossover. This exercise hones analytical skills and illustrates the power of thoughtfully designed genetic crosses in uncovering the precise mechanisms of recombination [@problem_id:1490056].", "problem": "In a genetics experiment with a haploid fungus that produces unordered tetrads, a wild-type strain is crossed with a triple mutant strain. The three genes involved are linked on the same chromosome. The parental genotypes are $a\\ M\\ b$ (wild-type for gene `M`, mutant for genes `a` and `b`) and $A\\ m\\ B$ (wild-type for genes `A` and `B`, mutant for gene `m`). The known gene order is $A - M - B$.\n\nAfter meiosis and sporulation, thousands of tetrads are analyzed. Most tetrads show expected Mendelian segregation patterns for parental, single crossover, or double crossover events. However, a small number of rare, \"aberrant\" tetrads are also recovered. One such class of aberrant tetrad, which we will call Tetrad Class X, is found to contain spores with the following genotypes:\n\n($A\\ m\\ B, A\\ M\\ B, a\\ M\\ b, a\\ M\\ b$)\n\nTwo competing models are proposed to explain the origin of Tetrad Class X:\n\n*   **Model 1 (Gene Conversion):** This model posits that Tetrad Class X results from a gene conversion event at the `M/m` locus during meiosis, without an associated crossover of the flanking regions.\n*   **Model 2 (Double Crossover):** This model argues that Tetrad Class X is the result of a standard double crossover event where the two crossovers are very close to, and flank, the `M/m` locus.\n\nBy analyzing the allelic composition of the spores in Tetrad Class X, determine which model provides a more parsimonious and mechanistically sound explanation. Select the statement below that best justifies the correct conclusion.\n\nA. Model 2 is correct because the formation of an $A\\ M\\ B$ spore from the given parents necessitates a crossover event between the `A` and `M` loci and another between the `M` and `B` loci.\n\nB. Model 1 is correct. A double crossover event cannot produce the observed 1:3 segregation ratio for the `M/m` alleles. Furthermore, the flanking markers `A/a` and `B/b` exhibit a parental ditype pattern, indicating no exchange between them, which is inconsistent with most double crossover events and consistent with a gene conversion event not accompanied by crossing over.\n\nC. Both models are equally unlikely. The 1:3 segregation ratio for `M/m` and the 2:2 ratio for `A/a` and `B/b` within the same tetrad are contradictory and most likely indicate sample contamination or scoring error.\n\nD. Model 2 is correct. The tetrad represents a two-strand double crossover, which produces parental genotypes for the flanking markers, and the aberrant 1:3 ratio for the central marker is likely due to a new point mutation at the `M` locus that occurred after the primary meiotic exchange.\n\nE. Model 1 is correct, but the event must have included an associated crossover. A gene conversion event that also involves a crossover of the flanking markers is the only way to generate a spore with the $A\\ M\\ B$ genotype from the $A\\ m\\ B$ parental background.", "solution": "1. Parental genotypes and gene order: Parents are $a\\ M\\ b$ and $A\\ m\\ B$ with order $A - M - B$. Thus the flanking markers $A/a$ and $B/b$ are in repulsion with respect to the central $M/m$.\n\n2. Observed tetrad class X: $(A\\ m\\ B,\\ A\\ M\\ B,\\ a\\ M\\ b,\\ a\\ M\\ b)$. Tallying alleles across the four spores:\n- For $A/a$: $A$ appears $2$ times and $a$ appears $2$ times $\\Rightarrow 2:2$.\n- For $B/b$: $B$ appears $2$ times and $b$ appears $2$ times $\\Rightarrow 2:2$.\n- For $M/m$: $M$ appears $3$ times and $m$ appears $1$ time $\\Rightarrow 3:1$.\n\n3. Key principles for unordered tetrads:\n- In the absence of gene conversion, any locus segregates $2:2$ in a tetrad; simple crossing over (single or double) redistributes alleles among chromatids but does not change the $2:2$ allele count at any given locus.\n- A $3:1$ (or $1:3$) allele ratio at a locus within a tetrad is a hallmark of gene conversion (or post-meiotic segregation), often arising from mismatch repair within heteroduplex DNA at the site of recombination.\n- For the flanking markers $A$ and $B$, the presence of only $AB$ and $ab$ spores (no $Ab$ or $aB$) is a parental ditype, consistent with no exchange between $A$ and $B$. While a very specific two-strand double crossover can also yield parental ditype for the flanks, most double crossovers give tetratype or nonparental ditype, and in all cases without gene conversion the central locus still shows $2:2$.\n\n4. Evaluation of Model 2 (double crossover flanking $M$):\n- Any standard double crossover, regardless of which chromatids participate, preserves a $2:2$ ratio at each locus in the absence of gene conversion. Therefore, it cannot on its own produce the observed $3:1$ at $M/m$.\n- Although a two-strand double crossover could yield parental ditype for $A$ and $B$, this does not solve the fundamental incompatibility with the $3:1$ at $M$. Introducing an ad hoc new mutation at $M$ post-meiosis to explain the $3:1$ is less parsimonious and mechanistically unnecessary.\n\n5. Evaluation of Model 1 (gene conversion at $M$ without associated crossover):\n- A gene conversion event converting $m \\rightarrow M$ in one chromatid of the $A\\ m\\ B$ parental chromosome directly yields an $A\\ M\\ B$ spore without any crossover of flanking regions.\n- This produces the observed $3:1$ at $M/m$ while leaving the flanking markers $A/a$ and $B/b$ in a parental ditype configuration (only $AB$ and $ab$), exactly as observed.\n\n6. Conclusion: The simultaneous presence of $3:1$ at the central marker and $2:2$ parental ditype at the flanking markers is the classic signature of a gene conversion event at the central locus without associated crossing over. Thus Model 1 is the more parsimonious and mechanistically sound explanation.
