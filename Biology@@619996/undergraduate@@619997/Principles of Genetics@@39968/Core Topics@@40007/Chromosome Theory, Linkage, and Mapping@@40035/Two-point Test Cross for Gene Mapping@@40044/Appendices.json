The first gene influences kernel texture, with the allele for smooth kernels ($S$) being dominant over the allele for shrunken kernels ($s$). The second gene affects kernel color, with the allele for colored kernels ($C$) being dominant over the allele for colorless kernels ($c$).\n\nThe geneticist performs a standard dihybrid cross. A true-breeding plant with smooth, colored kernels is crossed with a true-breeding plant with shrunken, colorless kernels. The resulting F1 progeny, which are heterozygous for both genes, are then used in a test cross with a plant that has shrunken, colorless kernels.\n\nPrevious genetic mapping experiments have determined that the gene for kernel texture and the gene for kernel color are 16 map units apart on the same chromosome.\n\nWhat is the expected proportion of offspring from this test cross that will exhibit a parental phenotype (i.e., either smooth and colored kernels, or shrunken and colorless kernels)?

Let the two loci be $S/s$ (kernel texture) and $C/c$ (kernel color), with $S$ and $C$ dominant.

In a testcross, each offspringâ€™s phenotype directly reflects the gamete contributed by the heterozygous parent, because the tester contributes only recessive alleles.\n\nGiven that the loci are $16$ map units apart, the recombination fraction between the loci is\n$$\nr = 0.16.\n$$\nBy definition, the total frequency of recombinant gametes from the heterozygote is $r$, and the total frequency of parental (nonrecombinant) gametes is $1 - r$. The parental gametes here are $S C$ and $s c$, while the recombinant gametes are $S c$ and $s C$.\n\nBecause each parental class shares the total parental fraction equally, each parental gamete occurs with frequency $(1 - r)/2$, and together they account for a total parental-phenotype proportion of\n$$\n1 - r.\n$$\nSubstituting $r = 0.16$ gives\n$$\n1 - r = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84.\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures leaves $0.84$ unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the expected proportion of offspring exhibiting a parental phenotype (smooth colored or shrunken colorless) is $0.84$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.84}$$", "id": "1533844"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's reverse the process and perform the foundational task of gene mapping.
