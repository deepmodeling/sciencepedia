Their corresponding gametes from the F1 parent are the parental gametes.\n*   Non-luminous, crinkled margin, smooth stem (`LcV` gamete from F1): 352\n*   Luminous, smooth margin, velvety stem (`lCv` gamete from F1): 346\nTotal NCO progeny = 352 + 346 = 698.\nThe F1 parent's chromosomes, inherited from the true-breeding parents, must therefore be `LcV` and `lCv`.\n\nThe double crossover (DCO) classes are the two least frequent phenotypes.\n*   Non-luminous, smooth margin, velvety stem (`LCv` gamete from F1): 9\n*   Luminous, crinkled margin, smooth stem (`lcV` gamete from F1): 9\nThe observed number of DCO progeny is 9 + 9 = 18.\nThe observed DCO frequency is $\\frac{18}{1000} = 0.018$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the order of the three genes on the chromosome.\nThe gene order can be determined by comparing the parental gamete genotypes with the double crossover (DCO) gamete genotypes. A double crossover event swaps the middle gene relative to the two outer genes.\n*   Parental gametes: `LcV` and `lCv`\n*   DCO gametes: `LCv` and `lcV`\n\nLet's compare one of the parental gametes, `LcV`, with the DCO gametes. The DCO gamete `lcV` differs from the parental `LcV` only by the allele for the luminescence gene (`L/l`). The other two genes (`c` and `V`) are in the same configuration. This indicates that the luminescence gene (`L/l`) is the middle gene. Let's confirm this with the other pair. The parental gamete `lCv` differs from the DCO gamete `LCv` only by the `l/L` allele. This confirms that the `L/l` gene is in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the correct gene order is `C-L-V` (or `V-L-C`, which is equivalent). The F1 parent's chromosomes can be written as `c L V` and `C l v`.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the recombination frequencies for the two intervals.\nBased on the gene order `C-L-V`, there are two regions where single crossovers (SCOs) can occur: Region 1 (between `C` and `L`) and Region 2 (between `L` and `V`).\n\nSCO in Region 1 (between `C` and `L`) results in gametes `CLV` and `clv`.\n*   Progeny from `CLV` gamete (non-luminous, smooth, smooth): 50\n*   Progeny from `clv` gamete (luminous, crinkled, velvety): 52\nTotal SCO in Region 1 = 50 + 52 = 102.\n\nSCO in Region 2 (between `L` and `V`) results in gametes `cLv` and `ClV`.\n*   Progeny from `cLv` gamete (non-luminous, crinkled, velvety): 93\n*   Progeny from `ClV` gamete (luminous, smooth, smooth): 89\nTotal SCO in Region 2 = 93 + 89 = 182.\n\nThe recombination frequency for an interval is the sum of the SCOs in that interval plus all DCOs, divided by the total progeny.\nRecombination Frequency (Region 1, C-L) = $\\frac{\\text{SCO}_{\\text{C-L}} + \\text{DCO}}{\\text{Total}} = \\frac{102 + 18}{1000} = \\frac{120}{1000} = 0.12$.\nRecombination Frequency (Region 2, L-V) = $\\frac{\\text{SCO}_{\\text{L-V}} + \\text{DCO}}{\\text{Total}} = \\frac{182 + 18}{1000} = \\frac{200}{1000} = 0.20$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the coefficient of coincidence (C.C.).\nThe expected frequency of double crossovers is the product of the recombination frequencies of the two adjacent regions, assuming no interference.\nExpected DCO frequency = (Freq. Recomb. C-L) $\\times$ (Freq. Recomb.
