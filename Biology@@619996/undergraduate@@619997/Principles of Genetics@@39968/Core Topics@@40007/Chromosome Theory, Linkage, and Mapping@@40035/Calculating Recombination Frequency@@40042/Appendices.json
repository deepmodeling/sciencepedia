{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Calculating recombination frequency is a fundamental skill in genetics, allowing us to map the relative positions of genes on a chromosome. This first exercise provides a classic scenario: a test cross involving a dihybrid organism. By analyzing the phenotypic counts of the offspring, you can directly determine the frequencies of parental and recombinant gametes produced by the heterozygous parent, offering the most straightforward path to calculating the genetic distance between two genes [@problem_id:1472899].", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, two genes located on the same autosome control wing texture and eye color. The allele for jagged wings ($J$) is dominant over the allele for smooth wings ($j$), and the allele for garnet-colored eyes ($G$) is dominant over the allele for white eyes ($g$).\n\nA biologist performs a cross between a pure-breeding fly with jagged wings and garnet eyes and a pure-breeding fly with smooth wings and white eyes. The resulting F1 dihybrid female flies are then test-crossed with males that have smooth wings and white eyes.\n\nThe progeny from this test cross are collected and sorted by phenotype, with the following counts:\n- Jagged wings, garnet eyes: 882\n- Smooth wings, white eyes: 891\n- Jagged wings, white eyes: 115\n- Smooth wings, garnet eyes: 112\n\nCalculate the recombination frequency between the gene for wing texture and the gene for eye color. Express your answer as a decimal value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $J$ and $j$ denote the alleles for wing texture (jagged dominant to smooth), and let $G$ and $g$ denote the alleles for eye color (garnet dominant to white). The parental cross is between pure-breeding $JJGG$ (jagged, garnet) and $jjgg$ (smooth, white), producing F1 females with genotype $JjGg$.\n\nBecause the F1 females were produced from $JJGG \\times jjgg$, their coupling phase is $JG/jg$. These F1 females are test-crossed to $jjgg$ males. In such a test cross, each progeny’s phenotype directly reflects the gamete contributed by the F1 female. The parental gametes $JG$ and $jg$ yield parental phenotypes (jagged, garnet) and (smooth, white), while the recombinant gametes $Jg$ and $jG$ yield recombinant phenotypes (jagged, white) and (smooth, garnet).\n\nGiven counts:\n- Parental: jagged, garnet $=882$; smooth, white $=891$.\n- Recombinant: jagged, white $=115$; smooth, garnet $=112$.\n\nCompute totals:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=882+891+115+112=2000,\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{recombinant}}=115+112=227.\n$$\n\nBy definition, the recombination frequency is\n$$\nr=\\frac{N_{\\text{recombinant}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}=\\frac{227}{2000}=0.1135.\n$$\n\nRounded to three significant figures, this is\n$$\n0.114.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.114}$$", "id": "1472899"}, {"introduction": "Real-world genetic analysis requires careful interpretation of data. This practice builds upon the basic test cross by introducing a key variable: the linkage phase of the alleles in the heterozygous parent. Here, the parental cross creates a dihybrid in \"repulsion\" (or trans configuration), where each parental chromosome carries one dominant and one recessive allele. This problem will sharpen your ability to correctly identify parental and recombinant progeny based on their frequencies, a critical step before calculating the recombination frequency [@problem_id:1472929].", "problem": "In maize (corn), two genes affect the kernel phenotype. The first gene determines aleurone color, with the dominant allele $C$ for colored aleurone and the recessive allele $c$ for colorless aleurone. The second gene affects endosperm shape, with the dominant allele $Sh$ for plump kernels and the recessive allele $sh$ for shrunken kernels. These two genes are linked on the same chromosome.\n\nA plant breeder starts with two pure-breeding parental lines: one with colored aleurone and shrunken kernels, and another with colorless aleurone and plump kernels. A cross between these two lines produces an F1 generation plant that is heterozygous for both genes. This F1 plant is then used in a test cross with a plant that has colorless aleurone and shrunken kernels.\n\nThe test cross produces a large number of progeny kernels with the following phenotypes:\n\n- 815 colored, shrunken kernels\n- 825 colorless, plump kernels\n- 185 colored, plump kernels\n- 175 colorless, shrunken kernels\n\nCalculate the recombination frequency between the $C$ and $Sh$ genes based on these results.

The two pure-breeding parents are $CC shsh$ (colored, shrunken) and $cc ShSh$ (colorless, plump). The F1 from this cross is $Cc Shsh$ with the parental haplotypes in repulsion: one homolog carries $C$ with $sh$ and the other carries $c$ with $Sh$, so the F1 phase is $(C sh)/(c Sh)$. \n\nA testcross with $cc shsh$ reveals the F1 gametes directly in the progeny phenotypes. The nonrecombinant (parental) gametes from the F1 are $C sh$ and $c Sh$, producing colored shrunken and colorless plump progeny, respectively. The recombinant gametes are $C Sh$ and $c sh$, producing colored plump and colorless shrunken progeny, respectively.\n\nFrom the data: nonrecombinant classes are colored shrunken $(815)$ and colorless plump $(825)$, while recombinant classes are colored plump $(185)$ and colorless shrunken $(175)$. The recombination frequency $r$ is defined as\n$$\nr=\\frac{\\text{number of recombinant progeny}}{\\text{total progeny}}=\\frac{185+175}{815+825+185+175}=\\frac{360}{2000}=0.18.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.180$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.180}$$", "id": "1472929"}, {"introduction": "While the test cross is a powerful tool, it's not always the experimental design used. This advanced problem challenges you to deduce recombination frequency from the results of an F1 self-cross. By understanding how gamete frequencies relate to offspring proportions in a dihybrid cross, you can work backward from the observed frequency of a single F2 phenotype—the double homozygous recessive—to estimate the recombination frequency, $r$. This demonstrates the predictive power of genetic principles and their application in more complex breeding scenarios [@problem_id:1472883].", "problem": "In a genetic study of a fictional flowering plant, *Aetheria bloom*, two genes are investigated. The first gene controls petal color, where the allele for purple petals ($P$) is completely dominant over the allele for white petals ($p$).

The resulting F1 generation all have purple petals and smooth stems.\n\nOne of the F1 plants is then self-pollinated to produce a large F2 generation. Upon analyzing the F2 population, it is found that the proportion of plants exhibiting the double recessive phenotype (white petals and hairy stems) is exactly 0.04.\n\nBased on this data, calculate the recombination frequency between the petal color gene and the stem texture gene. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Purple petals are dominant ($P$) and white petals are recessive ($p$); smooth stems are dominant ($S$) and hairy stems are recessive ($s$). A true-breeding purple, hairy plant has genotype $PP ss$, and a true-breeding white, smooth plant has genotype $pp SS$.

An F1 individual of genotype $Ps/pS$ produces the following gametes:\n- Nonrecombinants $Ps$ and $pS$ with frequency $(1 - r)/2$ each.\n- Recombinants $PS$ and $ps$ with frequency $r/2$ each.\n\nSelfing this F1 produces F2 by random union of these gametes. The double recessive phenotype ($ppss$) requires receiving the haplotype $ps$ from both gametes. Therefore, the probability of a double recessive F2 is\n$$\nP(ppss) = \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{r^{2}}{4}.\n$$\nGiven that the observed proportion of double recessive individuals is $0.04$, we set\n$$\n\\frac{r^{2}}{4} = 0.04 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r^{2} = 0.16 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = 0.4,\n$$\ntaking the nonnegative solution appropriate for a frequency.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency between the two genes is $0.4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4}$$", "id": "1472883"}]}
