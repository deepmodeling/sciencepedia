A female fly heterozygous for three linked autosomal genes—cinnabar eyes (*cn*), scute bristles (*sc*), and vestigial wings (*vg*)—is crossed with a male fly that is homozygous recessive for all three traits. The resulting progeny are sorted by phenotype and counted. The notation `+` is used to represent the wild-type allele for a given gene.
