A primary germline cell from a heterozygous plant ($Pp$) enters meiosis to produce four gametes. For the purpose of this question, assume that no new mutations arise during the process. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the specific meiotic event that is the physical basis for the segregation of the $P$ and $p$ alleles into different gametes, as predicted by the chromosomal theory of inheritance?\n\nA.

The separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I.\n\nC. The alignment of individual chromosomes along the metaphase plate during metaphase II.\n\nD.

The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes (crossing over) during prophase I.", "solution": "We consider a single locus with two alleles, $P$ (dominant) and $p$ (recessive), in a heterozygous plant with genotype $Pp$. Under the chromosomal theory of inheritance, each allele resides on one member of a homologous chromosome pair: one homolog carries the $P$ allele and the other homolog carries the $p$ allele.\n\nBefore meiosis, during the S phase, each chromosome is replicated so that each homolog becomes two sister chromatids. Specifically, the $P$-bearing chromosome becomes two sister chromatids both carrying $P$, and the $p$-bearing chromosome becomes two sister chromatids both carrying $p$. This DNA replication duplicates alleles but does not separate them into different cells, so it is not the physical basis of segregation. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nDuring meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair in prophase I and align as bivalents at the metaphase plate in metaphase I. The key event for Mendelâ€™s law of segregation is anaphase I, when homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. At this moment, the $P$-bearing homolog and the $p$-bearing homolog are physically segregated into different daughter cells. This separation of homologs is the physical basis for the segregation of alleles into different gametes as predicted by the chromosomal theory. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the event.\n\nBy contrast, metaphase II involves the alignment of individual chromosomes (each typically with two sister chromatids) at the metaphase II plate, but alignment itself does not effect segregation of alleles; hence option C does not describe the basis of segregation.\n\nAnaphase II is the separation of sister chromatids. In a standard meiosis without recombination within the locus, the two sister chromatids of a given chromosome carry the same allele at that locus (both $P$ or both $p$), so their separation does not constitute the initial segregation of the $P$ and $p$ alleles. Even if crossing over occurred between the locus and the centromere, the law of segregation still fundamentally arises from the separation of homologs in anaphase I; anaphase II resolves sister chromatids. Therefore, option D is not the primary physical basis of segregation.\n\nCrossing over during prophase I (option E) exchanges genetic material between homologs and increases genetic variation by recombining linked loci, but it is not necessary for nor does it constitute the segregation of alleles at a single locus. Segregation occurs whether or not crossing over takes place. Thus, option E is not correct.\n\nHence, the specific meiotic event that physically underlies allele segregation is the separation of homologous chromosomes in anaphase I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1524330"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basis for allele segregation, we now turn to Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, which describes how different genes are inherited independently of one another. This principle is physically explained by the random and independent orientation of different homologous chromosome pairs at the metaphase plate during Meiosis I.

Genetic analysis reveals that this organism is heterozygous for two unlinked genes: one controlling flower color and the other controlling plant height. The alleles for flower color are $C$ (for crimson) and $c$ (for white), and the alleles for plant height are $H$ (for high) and $h$ (for low). The genotype of this specific organism is $CcHh$.

The genes for color ($C/c$) and height ($H/h$) are stated to be on different chromosomes (unlinked). This scenario is a direct application of Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, which is explained mechanistically by the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis, as proposed by the Sutton-Boveri chromosome theory of inheritance.\n\nFirst, let's understand the chromosomal basis of the given genotype. The organism is diploid ($2n=4$), meaning it has two pairs of homologous chromosomes. Let's call them Pair 1 and Pair 2.\n- Since the genes are unlinked, one gene is on Pair 1 and the other is on Pair 2.\n- Let's assign the flower color gene to Pair 1. The organism's genotype is $Cc$, so one chromosome of Pair 1 carries the $C$ allele, and its homolog carries the $c$ allele.\n- Let's assign the plant height gene to Pair 2. The organism's genotype is $Hh$, so one chromosome of Pair 2 carries the $H$ allele, and its homolog carries the $h$ allele.\n\nDuring Meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then align at the metaphase plate. The key principle is that the orientation of each homologous pair is random and independent of the orientation of other pairs. With two pairs of homologous chromosomes, there are two possible ways they can align at the metaphase I plate.\n\n**Case 1: First Possible Alignment**\nThe chromosome with the $C$ allele and the chromosome with the $H$ allele orient towards one pole of the cell, while their homologs, carrying the $c$ and $h$ alleles respectively, orient towards the opposite pole.\n- After Meiosis I, two secondary cells are formed. One cell receives the chromosomes with the $C$ and $H$ alleles. The other cell receives the chromosomes with the $c$ and $h$ alleles.\n- During Meiosis II, the sister chromatids of these chromosomes separate.\n- The first cell produces two gametes, both with the genotype $CH$.\n- The second cell produces two gametes, both with the genotype $ch$.\n\n**Case 2: Second Possible Alignment**\nThe chromosome with the $C$ allele and the chromosome with the $h$ allele orient towards one pole, while their homologs, carrying the $c$ and $H$ alleles, orient towards the opposite pole.\n- After Meiosis I, one secondary cell is formed with the chromosomes carrying the $C$ and $h$ alleles. The other cell receives the chromosomes carrying the $c$ and $H$ alleles.\n- During Meiosis II, sister chromatids separate.\n- The first cell produces two gametes, both with the genotype $Ch$.\n- The second cell produces two gametes, both with the genotype $cH$.\n\nSince both alignment cases are equally probable, the organism will produce all four types of gametes over many meiotic events. The complete set of possible gamete genotypes is therefore {$CH$, $ch$, $Ch$, $cH$}.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- A. $CH$, $ch$: This would be the result if the genes were completely linked and in the coupling (cis) configuration. It ignores the possibility of independent assortment.\n- B. $Cc$, $Hh$: This option incorrectly lists diploid genotypes. Gametes are haploid; they should contain only one allele for each gene.\n- C. $CH$, $Ch$, $cH$, $ch$: This correctly lists all four possible combinations of alleles resulting from the independent assortment of the two homologous chromosome pairs.\n- D. $C$, $c$, $H$, $h$: This lists the individual alleles but not the combinations as they would exist in a gamete. A gamete must contain one allele for the color gene *and* one allele for the height gene.\n- E. $CcHh$: This is the diploid genotype of the parent organism, not a possible haploid gamete.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C, as it represents all the possible outcomes of independent assortment for these two genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1524336"}, {"introduction": "The concept of 'independent' assortment has powerful quantitative implications.
