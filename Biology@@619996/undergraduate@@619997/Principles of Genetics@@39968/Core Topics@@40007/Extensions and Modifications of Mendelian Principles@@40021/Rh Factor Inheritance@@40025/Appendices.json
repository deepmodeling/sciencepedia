This first practice serves as a fundamental building block, challenging you to deduce an individual's genotype from their phenotype and family history.

This man and an Rh-negative woman are planning to have a child.

Phenotypes follow Mendelian dominance: individuals with genotypes $DD$ or $Dd$ are Rh-positive, and individuals with genotype $dd$ are Rh-negative.\n\nThe man is Rh-positive and his father is Rh-negative. A Rh-negative person must have genotype $dd$, so the father is $dd$. The man must have inherited a $d$ allele from his father. Since the man is Rh-positive, his genotype cannot be $dd$, so it must be $Dd$. Therefore, the man’s genotype is $Dd$.\n\nThe woman is Rh-negative, so her genotype is $dd$.\n\nWe consider the cross $Dd \\times dd$.

This problem presents a scenario that appears to contradict the basic rules of Rh-based Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), forcing a deeper look into the molecular biology of the $RHD$ antigen. By exploring the concept of 'partial D' alleles, you will learn why an Rh-positive mother can, in rare cases, produce antibodies against an Rh-positive fetus, highlighting the critical link between gene structure and immune response. [@problem_id:1518234]", "problem": "In human genetics, the Rh blood group system is of major clinical importance, particularly concerning Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). The primary determinant of Rh status is the RHD gene. Individuals with at least one dominant \"D\" allele are Rh-positive, expressing the RhD antigen on their red blood cells. Individuals with a homozygous recessive \"dd\" genotype lack the RHD gene entirely and are Rh-negative.\n\nA common simplification states that only Rh-negative mothers are at risk of developing anti-D antibodies and causing Rh-based HDN in an Rh-positive fetus. However, consider a rare clinical case: A woman who has always tested as Rh-positive gives birth to her second child. Both the mother and the newborn test as Rh-positive. The father is also Rh-positive. Despite this, the newborn develops symptoms of HDN, and laboratory tests confirm the cause is maternal anti-D antibodies attacking the newborn's red blood cells.\n\nGenetic analysis reveals that rare alleles of the RHD gene exist. These alleles, known as \"partial D\" alleles, contain mutations that result in the expression of an altered RhD protein. This altered protein is still detected as \"positive\" in standard blood typing but is structurally different from the \"standard\" RhD antigen produced by the most common D allele.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios provides the most plausible genetic explanation for this case of HDN in the child of an Rh-positive mother?\n\nA. The mother possesses a \"partial D\" allele, while the fetus inherited a \"standard D\" allele from the father. The mother's immune system recognized the component of the standard D antigen that she lacks as foreign.\n\nB. The mother is heterozygous (Dd). During pregnancy, her immune system spontaneously lost tolerance to the D antigen and began producing antibodies against her own red blood cells as well as the fetus's.\n\nC. Both parents are heterozygous (Dd) for the RHD gene. The child is homozygous dominant (DD), and the \"double dose\" of the D antigen triggered an immune response from the heterozygous mother.\n\nD. A laboratory error occurred, and the mother is actually Rh-negative (dd). Her positive test result was a false positive.\n\nE. The HDN was caused by an incompatibility in a different blood group system, like Kell or Duffy, and the presence of anti-D antibodies is a coincidental finding unrelated to the disease.", "solution": "1) Define the immunohematologic baseline. The RHD gene encodes the D antigen on red blood cells. Individuals with at least one functional D allele ($D$) are typically typed as Rh-positive; individuals with $dd$ are Rh-negative. Immune tolerance prevents an individual from mounting an antibody response against self antigens present on their own red cells.\n\n2) Introduce the variant-allele principle relevant to the case. Certain rare $RHD$ alleles encode a structurally altered D protein (so-called partial D). These partial D antigens lack one or more epitopes present on the common or “standard” D antigen, yet agglutination with standard reagents in routine testing usually leads to an Rh-positive result. Therefore, such individuals are phenotypically Rh-positive by routine typing but are not immunologically tolerant to the epitopes they do not express.\n\n3) Apply the alloimmunization mechanism. When a partial D mother is exposed to red cells expressing the full complement of D epitopes (e.g., from a fetus who inherited a standard $D$ allele from the father), the maternal immune system can recognize the missing D epitopes as non-self and mount an alloimmune response, producing anti-D antibodies directed specifically against those absent epitopes. Sensitization can occur during a prior pregnancy or fetomaternal hemorrhage, explaining why the second child is affected.\n\n4) Connect to Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). Maternal IgG anti-D alloantibodies cross the placenta and bind fetal red cells expressing the full D epitopes, causing hemolysis and HDN. This mechanism is fully consistent with: (i) the mother typing Rh-positive by standard methods, (ii) the fetus also typing Rh-positive, and (iii) laboratory confirmation that maternal anti-D antibodies are the cause of hemolysis.\n\n5) Exclude alternatives by immunologic principles of tolerance and antigen dose:\n- Against B: A heterozygous $Dd$ mother expresses the standard D antigen and is immunologically tolerant to D epitopes; spontaneous loss of tolerance would produce autoantibodies against her own D, leading to maternal hemolysis, and would not typically be classified as allo-anti-D causing HDN in this specific pattern. The case specifies allo-anti-D as the cause.\n- Against C: Antigen dose (“double dose” in $DD$) does not break tolerance to self; a $Dd$ mother’s D epitopes are the same as those on $DD$ fetal cells, so no alloimmune response is expected purely from dosage.\n- Against D: A laboratory false positive converting an Rh-negative ($dd$) mother to Rh-positive in repeated testing is unlikely and does not account for the explicit finding of anti-D in a mother typed as Rh-positive; moreover, the clinical vignette emphasizes the recognized partial D mechanism.\n- Against E: The case states laboratory confirmation that anti-D is causative. Therefore, attributing HDN to another blood group while calling anti-D coincidental contradicts the given data.\n\n6) Conclusion. The mechanism that aligns with established immunohematology, the Rh typing results, and the confirmed causative antibody is that the mother carries a partial D allele, and exposure to a fetus with a standard D antigen elicited allo-anti-D to the missing epitopes, resulting in HDN.

This thought experiment challenges the core assumption that monozygotic twins are genetically identical in every cell, introducing the concept of somatic mosaicism. You will reason through various molecular events to pinpoint the most plausible explanation, gaining insight into how genetic changes after fertilization can lead to surprising developmental outcomes. [@problem_id:1518166]", "problem": "In human genetics, identical (monozygotic) twins are derived from a single zygote and are therefore expected to share the exact same genetic information. The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system is a critical factor in blood transfusions and pregnancy. The Rh-positive phenotype is determined by the expression of the D antigen, encoded by the dominant allele of the RHD gene. The Rh-negative phenotype results from being homozygous for a recessive allele, $d$, which in most cases corresponds to a complete deletion of the RHD gene.\n\nConsider a case involving a pair of healthy monozygotic twin boys, Twin A and Twin B. Their father is Rh-negative (genotype $d/d$), and their mother is Rh-positive. Genetic analysis of the mother's somatic cells reveals she is heterozygous for the RHD gene (genotype $D/d$). Surprisingly, a blood test reveals that Twin A is Rh-positive, while Twin B is Rh-negative. This discordance suggests that a genetic or epigenetic alteration occurred in a single cell after fertilization but before the complete development of the twins.\n\nAssuming the original zygote had the expected genotype $D/d$, which of the following post-zygotic events represents the most plausible molecular explanation for the Rh-negative phenotype observed in Twin B?\n\nA. A large somatic deletion of the entire RHD gene locus on the maternally-inherited chromosome, which occurred in an early embryonic cell that subsequently gave rise to the hematopoietic stem cell lineage of Twin B.\n\nB. A gain-of-function point mutation in the promoter of the RHCE gene in Twin B, causing it to suppress the expression of the nearby RHD gene.\n\nC. Epigenetic silencing via hypermethylation of the paternal $d$ allele in all somatic cells of Twin B.\n\nD. A meiotic nondisjunction event in the mother's germline, resulting in an egg that lacked the chromosome carrying the RHD gene.\n\nE. A somatic frameshift mutation in a non-coding intron of the RHD gene, occurring in the hematopoietic stem cells of Twin B.\n\nF. Aneuploidy for chromosome 1 (where the RHD gene is located), resulting from mitotic nondisjunction during the first cell division of the zygote, leading to Twin B's cell lineage being monosomic for this chromosome.", "solution": "The initial zygote, formed from a father with genotype $d/d$ (RHD gene deleted) and a mother with genotype $D/d$, must be $D/d$. In this configuration, only the maternally inherited $D$ allele provides functional RHD, because the paternal $d$ allele corresponds to a deletion or null allele. Therefore, to produce an Rh-negative phenotype ($d/d$ functionally) in one monozygotic twin post-zygotically, the sole functional $D$ allele must be inactivated in the lineage giving rise to that twin’s hematopoietic cells.\n\nEvaluate each option against this requirement and known biology of the RHD locus:\n\n- Option A: A somatic deletion of the maternal $D$ allele in an early embryonic cell that seeds Twin B’s hematopoietic lineage would convert $D/d$ to a functional $d/d$ (no intact RHD gene), producing an Rh-negative phenotype specifically in blood. This is mechanistically sound, consistent with the common molecular basis of $d$ alleles (deletions), and matches the lineage-restricted presentation observed in monozygotic twin discordance.\n\n- Option B: A gain-of-function mutation in the RHCE promoter suppressing RHD is not a recognized regulatory mechanism; a promoter of a neighboring gene acting in trans to suppress RHD is highly implausible and not supported by known cis-regulatory architecture of the RHD/RHCE locus. It also does not specifically explain a complete loss of D antigen expression.\n\n- Option C: Hypermethylation of the paternal $d$ allele is irrelevant because the paternal allele already lacks functional RHD; silencing a null allele cannot yield Rh-negative. Rh-negative would require silencing or deletion of the maternal $D$ allele.\n\n- Option D: A meiotic nondisjunction in the mother is a pre-zygotic event that would affect both twins equally and, if it removed an entire chromosome harboring RHD, would lead to monosomy of chromosome 1 in the zygote, which is not compatible with healthy development.\n\n- Option E: A frameshift mutation in a non-coding intron is generally not impactful on protein coding unless it disrupts essential splice sites or regulatory elements, and a generic “frameshift in an intron” does not abrogate gene function. This is far less plausible than a gene deletion for producing a null RHD allele.\n\n- Option F: Monosomy for chromosome 1 arising from mitotic nondisjunction would be lethal or cause severe abnormalities; healthy monozygotic twins with isolated Rh discordance do not fit this scenario.\n\nThus, the most plausible molecular explanation is a somatic deletion of the maternal RHD allele in the hematopoietic lineage of Twin B, producing a functional $d/d$ genotype in blood.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1518166"}]}
