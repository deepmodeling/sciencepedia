This practice problem sharpens that analytical skill. Instead of predicting offspring from known parents, you are given the phenotypic ratio of an F1 generation and must infer the parental genotypes, a process akin to genetic detective work. This exercise [@problem_id:1498882] provides a foundational test of your understanding of how alleles segregate and combine in a simple monohybrid cross involving incomplete dominance.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the inheritance of flower color in a particular species of night-blooming cactus. The color is determined by a single gene with two alleles. It is known from previous experiments that plants homozygous for one allele produce vibrant magenta flowers, while plants homozygous for the other allele produce pure white flowers. Heterozygous plants are found to express an intermediate phenotype, producing pale lilac flowers.\n\nIn a new experiment, the geneticist performs a cross between two parent cactus plants of unknown genotypes. After the seeds germinate and the offspring mature, the observed phenotypic ratio in the F1 generation is approximately 1 plant with vibrant magenta flowers for every 1 plant with pale lilac flowers. No plants with pure white flowers are observed among the hundreds of offspring grown.\n\nLet the allele for magenta color be denoted by $C^M$ and the allele for white color be denoted by $C^W$. Based on the experimental results, determine the genotypes of the two parent plants that were crossed.\n\nA. $C^M C^M$ and $C^W C^W$\n\nB. $C^M C^W$ and $C^M C^W$\n\nC. $C^M C^M$ and $C^M C^W$\n\nD. $C^M C^W$ and $C^W C^W$\n\nE. $C^W C^W$ and $C^W C^W$", "solution": "First, we must establish the relationship between genotype and phenotype based on the information provided. The problem describes a pattern of incomplete dominance.\n- A plant with vibrant magenta flowers is homozygous for the magenta allele. Its genotype is $C^M C^M$.\n- A plant with pure white flowers is homozygous for the white allele. Its genotype is $C^W C^W$.\n- A plant with pale lilac flowers has an intermediate phenotype, which means it is heterozygous. Its genotype is $C^M C^W$.\n\nNext, we analyze the phenotypes of the offspring from the experimental cross. The offspring population consists of two groups in a 1:1 ratio:\n- Phenotype 1: Vibrant magenta flowers (genotype $C^M C^M$)\n- Phenotype 2: Pale lilac flowers (genotype $C^M C^W$)\n\nThe fact that there are offspring with the genotype $C^M C^M$ means that each of the two parents must have been able to contribute a $C^M$ allele. This is because a $C^M C^M$ individual is formed by the fusion of one gamete carrying a $C^M$ allele and another gamete also carrying a $C^M$ allele.\n\nThe presence of offspring with the genotype $C^M C^W$ means that one parent must have contributed a $C^M$ allele and the other parent must have contributed a $C^W$ allele.\n\nLet's combine these deductions to determine the parental genotypes.\nLet the genotypes of the parents be Parent 1 and Parent 2.\nFrom the $C^M C^W$ offspring, we know that the parental gamete pool must contain both $C^M$ and $C^W$ alleles. This means at least one parent must have the $C^W$ allele.\nFrom the $C^M C^M$ offspring, we know that both parents must be capable of producing $C^M$ gametes. This means both parents must have at least one $C^M$ allele in their genotype.\n\nSo, one parent must contribute a $C^W$ allele, and both parents must contribute a $C^M$ allele.\n- For Parent 1 to contribute a $C^M$ allele, its genotype could be $C^M C^M$ or $C^M C^W$.\n- For Parent 2 to contribute a $C^M$ allele, its genotype could be $C^M C^M$ or $C^M C^W$.\n- For the parental pair to produce a $C^W$ gamete, at least one of them must have the genotype $C^M C^W$.\n\nLet's assume one parent is heterozygous, $C^M C^W$. This parent can produce both $C^M$ and $C^W$ gametes. To get both $C^M C^M$ and $C^M C^W$ offspring, the other parent must provide a $C^M$ gamete. If the other parent were also $C^M C^W$, the cross would produce $C^W C^W$ offspring, which were not observed. Therefore, the other parent must be homozygous for the $C^M$ allele, i.e., $C^M C^M$. This parent can only produce $C^M$ gametes.\n\nLet's verify this proposed parental cross: $C^M C^M \\times C^M C^W$. We can use a Punnett square to predict the offspring.\nParent 1 ($C^M C^M$) produces only one type of gamete: $C^M$.\nParent 2 ($C^M C^W$) produces two types of gametes in equal proportion: $C^M$ and $C^W$.\n\nThe resulting F1 generation genotypes would be:\n- Fertilization of a $C^W$ gamete (from Parent 2) by a $C^M$ gamete (from Parent 1) results in $C^M C^W$.\n- Fertilization of a $C^M$ gamete (from Parent 2) by a $C^M$ gamete (from Parent 1) results in $C^M C^M$.\n\nThe expected genotypic ratio is 1 $C^M C^M$ : 1 $C^M C^W$.\nThe corresponding phenotypic ratio is 1 vibrant magenta : 1 pale lilac.\n\nThis matches the experimental observation of a 1:1 ratio. We can now check the given options:\nA. $C^M C^M \\times C^W C^W$ would yield 100% $C^M C^W$ (pale lilac) offspring. Incorrect.\nB. $C^M C^W \\times C^M C^W$ would yield a 1 $C^M C^M$ : 2 $C^M C^W$ : 1 $C^W C^W$ ratio (1 magenta : 2 lilac : 1 white).

This problem [@problem_id:1498907] requires you to simultaneously apply the principles of incomplete dominance for one trait and complete dominance for another.

The allele for a black pigment, denoted $C^B$, and the allele for a white pigment, denoted $C^W$, exhibit incomplete dominance. An individual with the genotype $C^B C^B$ has black skin, an individual with $C^W C^W$ has white skin, and a heterozygous individual ($C^B C^W$) has gray skin.\n\nThe second gene controls scale texture. The allele for smooth scales, $S$, is completely dominant over the allele for rough scales, $s$. Therefore, individuals with genotypes $SS$ or $S s$ have smooth scales, while only individuals with genotype $ss$ have rough scales.\n\nA biologist performs a cross between a true-breeding black drake with smooth scales and a true-breeding white drake with rough scales to produce an F1 generation. Two individuals from this F1 generation are then selected and crossed with each other. Assuming the two genes assort independently, what is the probability of producing an offspring in the F2 generation that has gray skin and rough scales?

A true-breeding black, smooth drake must be homozygous at both loci, so its genotype is $C^{B}C^{B}SS$. A true-breeding white, rough drake must be $C^{W}C^{W}ss$. By the law of segregation, each P parent produces only one type of gamete: the black, smooth parent produces $C^{B}S$ and the white, rough parent produces $C^{W}s$. Therefore, all F1 offspring are $C^{B}C^{W}Ss$, which phenotypically are gray (incomplete dominance at the $C$ locus) and smooth (dominance at the $S$ locus).\n\nTwo F1 individuals are crossed: $C^{B}C^{W}Ss \\times C^{B}C^{W}Ss$. Because the loci are unlinked, they assort independently (law of independent assortment), so the probability for the combined phenotype is the product of the probabilities at each locus.\n\nAt the color locus, the cross $C^{B}C^{W} \\times C^{B}C^{W}$ yields genotypes $C^{B}C^{B}$, $C^{B}C^{W}$, and $C^{W}C^{W}$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, respectively, by the law of segregation.

The color of the light emitted by this fungus is determined by a single gene with two alleles.

The geneticist observes that when a pure-breeding blue-light fungus is crossed with a pure-breeding green-light fungus, all offspring emit an aqua-colored light. This suggests a pattern of incomplete dominance.\n\nTo investigate this further, the geneticist performs a cross between two fungi that both exhibit the aqua-colored bioluminescence.
