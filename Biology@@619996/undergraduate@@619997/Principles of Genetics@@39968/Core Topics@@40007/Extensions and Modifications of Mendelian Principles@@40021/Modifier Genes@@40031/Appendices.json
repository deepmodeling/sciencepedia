One gene controls the primary pigment, with the allele for red eyes being completely dominant to the allele for yellow eyes. A second gene can modify the expression of the first. When an individual is homozygous recessive for this second gene, the red pigment is transformed, resulting in orange eyes. This modifying effect does not happen in the presence of a dominant allele for the second gene, and it has no effect on individuals that would otherwise have yellow eyes.\n\nA biologist performs a cross between a true-breeding frog with orange eyes and a true-breeding frog with yellow eyes. All of the resulting F1 generation offspring are found to have red eyes. These F1 frogs are then interbred to produce an F2 generation.\n\nWhat fraction of the F2 generation is expected to have orange eyes? Express your answer as a simple fraction.", "solution": "Let the primary pigment gene be $R/r$, where $R$ is dominant for red and $r$ yields yellow when homozygous. Let the modifier gene be $M/m$, where only $mm$ transforms red pigment to orange, has no effect in the presence of $M$, and has no effect when the primary genotype is $rr$ (which is yellow regardless).\n\nThus, the phenotype mapping is:\n- $R\\_\\ M\\_$ gives red,\n- $R\\_\\ mm$ gives orange,\n- $rr$ with any $M/m$ genotype gives yellow.\n\nA true-breeding orange frog must be $RR\\,mm$.

The first gene, with alleles `K` and `k`, primarily determines the tail's shape. The dominant allele `K` results in a kinked tail, while the recessive allele `k` results in a normal, straight tail.\n\nA second gene, with alleles `E` and `e`, has a more complex, pleiotropic role. The recessive genotype `ee` acts as a modifier for the first gene, enhancing the tail defect; mice with a genotype of `K_ ee` exhibit a \"severely kinked\" tail. Mice with at least one `E` allele do not show this enhancement. Independently, the `ee` genotype also reduces embryonic viability. Specifically, only 60% of zygotes with the `ee` genotype survive to be born. Zygotes with at least one `E` allele (`EE` or `Ee`) have normal viability.\n\nA geneticist starts with two true-breeding lines: one with genotype `KK EE` and another with genotype `kk ee`. These are crossed to produce an F1 generation.

However, this resistance comes at a price: in an environment free of the pesticide, any individual carrying at least one 'R' allele has its relative fitness reduced by a factor $1-s$, where $s$ is a positive constant representing the fitness cost.\n\nAfter a long period of pesticide use, the frequency of the 'R' allele is high. The pesticide is then permanently withdrawn, and the population begins to evolve in response to the fitness cost of the 'R' allele.\n\nSimultaneously, a rare recessive allele 'm' at a second, unlinked genetic locus acts as a modifier. Individuals with the genotype 'mm' have their fitness restored to normal (relative fitness of 1), even if they carry the 'R' allele. The initial frequency of this 'm' allele in the population is $q_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nDepending on the initial frequency of the resistance allele, $p_0$, the population can evolve towards one of two long-term outcomes: the 'R' allele is either purged from the population by selection, or it is 'rescued' by the spread of the 'm' allele and maintained.
