{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Genes often work together in biochemical pathways, and the interaction between them can lead to surprising inheritance patterns that modify classic Mendelian ratios. This first practice explores a common example: recessive epistasis, which is often revealed by a 9:3:4 phenotypic ratio in a dihybrid cross. By analyzing this ratio and performing a subsequent test cross, you will learn to deduce the underlying genetic pathway where a recessive genotype at one locus masks the expression of another gene [@problem_id:1490916].", "problem": "In a particular species of legume, seed coat pattern is determined by the interaction of two independently assorting genes, which we will denote as gene A and gene B. A geneticist performs a cross between a true-breeding plant that produces spotted seeds and a true-breeding plant that produces plain seeds. All of the resulting F1 generation plants produce spotted seeds.

Instead, a 9:3:4 ratio is observed. This modified ratio is a classic indicator of a specific type of gene interaction, namely recessive epistasis.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the F2 ratio to determine the genotype-phenotype relationship.\nThe standard 9:3:3:1 ratio corresponds to the genotypes $A\\_B\\_$ (9/16), $A\\_bb$ (3/16), $aaB\\_$ (3/16), and aabb (1/16).\nThe observed 9:3:4 ratio indicates that two of the genotypic classes are producing the same phenotype. The \"4\" in the ratio comes from combining the \"3\" and \"1\" classes of the standard ratio (3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16). This means that the genotypes $aaB\\_$ and aabb produce the same \"plain\" phenotype. The homozygous recessive genotype at the 'a' locus (aa) masks the expression of the 'B' gene.\n\nTherefore, the genotype-to-phenotype map is as follows:\n-   Genotype $A\\_B\\_$ produces the **spotted** phenotype (frequency 9/16).\n-   Genotype $A\\_bb$ produces the **dotted** phenotype (frequency 3/16).\n-   Genotypes $aaB\\_$ and aabb both produce the **plain** phenotype (frequency 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16).\n\nStep 2: Determine the genotypes of the individuals in the test cross.\nThe F1 generation resulted from a cross between two true-breeding parents and produced all spotted offspring. Since spotted is the $A\\_B\\_$ phenotype, the parents must have been AABB (true-breeding spotted) and aabb (true-breeding plain). This is consistent with the problem which states one parent was true-breeding spotted and the other was true-breeding plain.\nThe cross is AABB x aabb.\nThe resulting F1 individuals all have the genotype AaBb. The problem asks to use an F1 individual for the test cross, so its genotype is AaBb.\n\nA test cross involves crossing an individual with an unknown or heterozygous genotype to a homozygous recessive individual. The problem specifies that the test cross partner is a true-breeding plain-seeded plant \"known to have the genotype of the original plain-seeded parent stock.\" As we determined, this genotype is aabb.\n\nSo, the test cross is: AaBb x aabb.\n\nStep 3: Predict the offspring of the test cross.\nWe can use a Punnett square to determine the genotypes and their frequencies in the progeny. The AaBb parent can produce four types of gametes: AB, Ab, aB, and ab. The aabb parent can only produce one type of gamete: ab.\n\nThe cross produces the following offspring genotypes in equal proportions:\n-   AaBb x aabb -> 1/4 AaBb\n-   AaBb x aabb -> 1/4 Aabb\n-   AaBb x aabb -> 1/4 aaBb\n-   AaBb x aabb -> 1/4 aabb\n\nThe expected genotypic ratio of the offspring is 1 AaBb : 1 Aabb : 1 aaBb : 1 aabb.\n\nStep 4: Convert the offspring genotypes to phenotypes.\nUsing the genotype-phenotype map from Step 1, we can determine the phenotype of each offspring genotype:\n-   AaBb -> Spotted (has at least one A and one B)\n-   Aabb -> Dotted (has at least one A but is bb)\n-   aaBb -> Plain (is aa, which is epistatic)\n-   aabb -> Plain (is aa, which is epistatic)\n\nStep 5: Determine the final phenotypic ratio.\nBy combining the phenotypes, we get the final expected ratio:\n-   Spotted: 1 part\n-   Dotted: 1 part\n-   Plain: 1 part (aaBb) + 1 part (aabb) = 2 parts\n\nThe final expected phenotypic ratio is 1 spotted : 1 dotted : 2 plain.

Here, a single dominant allele at one gene locus is sufficient to mask the phenotype of a second locus, characteristically producing a 12:3:1 ratio in the F2 generation. This exercise will sharpen your ability to identify different forms of epistasis from experimental data and predict the outcomes of genetic crosses involving these interactions [@problem_id:1490866].", "problem": "A botanist studying a newly discovered plant species, *Fructus novus*, observes that its fruit can have one of three distinct shapes: flat, round, or long. In an initial experiment, a true-breeding plant that produces flat fruits is crossed with a true-breeding plant that produces round fruits. All of the resulting F1 generation plants produce flat fruits.\n\nThese F1 plants are then allowed to self-pollinate, producing an F2 generation. Out of a total of 432 plants in the F2 generation, the botanist counts 324 plants with flat fruits, 81 plants with round fruits, and 27 plants with long fruits.\n\nFor a follow-up experiment, the botanist performs a test cross by taking one of the F1 plants and crossing it with a plant that produces long fruits.

With totals $324$ flat, $81$ round, and $27$ long, dividing each by $27$ gives $12:3:1$. The ratio $12:3:1$ is characteristic of dominant epistasis involving two genes. Let two loci, $A$ and $B$, determine shape with the following scheme:\n- Any genotype with $A\\_$ is flat (dominant epistasis of $A$).\n- Genotype $aaB\\_$ is round.\n- Genotype $aabb$ is long.\n\nThis scheme yields $12$ flat, $3$ round, and $1$ long among the $16$ genotypes from a dihybrid self, consistent with the observed F2.\n\nIdentify parental genotypes consistent with the initial cross. A true-breeding flat that is epistatic can be $AAbb$, and a true-breeding round must be $aaBB$. Crossing $AAbb \\times aaBB$ yields F1 $AaBb$, all flat, matching the observation. Selfing $AaBb$ produces the $12:3:1$ F2, confirming the model.\n\nFor the test cross, cross an F1 plant with a long-fruit plant. The F1 is $AaBb$. Long fruits require $aabb$, so the tester is $aabb$. By Mendelian segregation and independent assortment, the F1 produces four gametes $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$, while the $aabb$ parent produces only $ab$ gametes. The zygotes and their probabilities are:\n- $AB/ab \\rightarrow AaBb$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $Ab/ab \\rightarrow Aabb$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $aB/ab \\rightarrow aaBb$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $ab/ab \\rightarrow aabb$ with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nMap genotypes to phenotypes using the epistasis scheme:\n- $AaBb$ and $Aabb$ are $A\\_$, hence flat.\n- $aaBb$ is $aaB\\_$, hence round.\n- $aabb$ is long.\n\nThus the phenotypic probabilities are $\\frac{1}{2}$ flat, $\\frac{1}{4}$ round, and $\\frac{1}{4}$ long, which simplifies to the ratio $2:1:1$.\n\nComparing to the options, this corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1490866"}, {"introduction": "Real-world genetics often involves multiple layers of complexity, where different inheritance patterns intersect within a single biological system.

The first gene controls wing size and exhibits incomplete dominance. The allele $L$ results in large wings, while the allele $l$ results in small wings. Heterozygous individuals ($Ll$) possess wings of a medium size. The second gene affects wing texture. The dominant allele $C$ allows for normal wing development according to the size gene.
