This practice problem models a classic genetic experiment, allowing you to see how codominance produces phenotypic ratios distinct from those of complete dominance. By tracking the inheritance of two codominant alleles ($L^{S}$ and $L^{P}$) for leaf patterns, you will calculate the expected outcomes in the $F_2$ generation and solidify your understanding of how both parental traits can be expressed simultaneously in a heterozygote [@problem_id:1477625].", "problem": "In the study of a fictional ornamental plant, *Pictoria variegata*, the gene for leaf pattern has two codominant alleles. One allele, denoted as $L^{S}$, results in a striped leaf pattern. The other allele, $L^{P}$, results in a spotted leaf pattern. Due to codominance, heterozygous plants ($L^{S} L^{P}$) exhibit leaves that are simultaneously striped and spotted.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist begins an experiment by crossing a pure-breeding plant with striped leaves with a pure-breeding plant with spotted leaves. The resulting offspring are then allowed to self-pollinate to produce a second generation.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance, what is the expected phenotypic ratio in this second generation? Express your answer as three numbers in a row matrix representing the ratio in the order of (Striped : Spotted : Striped-and-Spotted).", "solution": "Let the two codominant alleles be $L^{S}$ (striped) and $L^{P}$ (spotted). Under codominance, the heterozygote $L^{S}L^{P}$ expresses both patterns simultaneously.\n\nParental generation: a pure-breeding striped plant has genotype $L^{S}L^{S}$ and a pure-breeding spotted plant has genotype $L^{P}L^{P}$. Crossing these yields:\n$$L^{S}L^{S} \\times L^{P}L^{P} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{F}_{1}: \\; \\text{all } L^{S}L^{P}$$\nby Mendel’s law of segregation, since each parent contributes one allele to the offspring.\n\nThe $\\text{F}_{1}$ plants are all $L^{S}L^{P}$ and self-pollinate. Each $L^{S}L^{P}$ individual produces gametes $L^{S}$ and $L^{P}$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$, respectively, by the law of segregation.

This next exercise builds upon the basics by incorporating two different genes—one displaying codominance and the other complete dominance.

This is a crucial skill for understanding the complex inheritance patterns of multiple traits at once [@problem_id:1477668].", "problem": "In an exotic species of plant, the \"Stardust Orchid,\" two independently assorting genes control petal coloration and plant height.\n\nThe first gene controls the petal color.
