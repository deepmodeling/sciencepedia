This first exercise provides a direct application of this principle. By examining a list of which mutant pairs fail to complement, you will practice the core skill of sorting individual mutants into complementation groups, where each group corresponds to a single gene in the biological pathway being studied [@problem_id:1478595].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a biosynthetic pathway in the baker's yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Seven independent, recessive, haploid mutant strains that are auxotrophic (unable to produce a required nutrient) have been isolated. These strains, labeled `mut1` through `mut7`, are unable to grow on a minimal medium (MM) but can grow if the medium is supplemented with the pathway's final product.\n\nTo determine how many different genes are represented by this collection of mutations, complementation tests are performed. Diploid cells are created by mating pairs of the haploid mutant strains. The resulting diploid's phenotype is then scored by its ability to grow on MM. Growth on MM indicates that complementation has occurred, while no growth indicates a failure to complement.\n\nAs expected, when any mutant strain is crossed with the wild-type strain, the resulting diploid grows on MM. Also, when any mutant strain is crossed with itself, the resulting diploid fails to grow on MM. The crucial results come from crosses between different mutant strains. The following pairs of different mutant strains failed to complement (i.e., the resulting diploid did not grow on MM):\n- `mut1` and `mut4`\n- `mut2` and `mut5`\n- `mut3` and `mut7`\n- `mut1` and `mut6`\n- `mut4` and `mut6`\n\nAll other pairwise crosses between different mutant strains resulted in complementation, meaning the diploid cells were able to grow on MM.\n\nBased on these results, how many distinct genes are represented by this collection of seven mutants?", "solution": "Principle: In a complementation test between recessive mutations, a diploid that grows on minimal medium indicates complementation, meaning the two mutations are in different genes (each gene has at least one functional copy). Failure to grow indicates failure to complement, meaning the two mutations are in the same gene (no functional copy is present for that gene in the diploid).\n\nApply the principle to the given non-complementing pairs:\n- mut1 fails with mut4 and with mut6; additionally, mut4 fails with mut6. By transitivity, mut1, mut4, and mut6 define one complementation group (one gene).\n- mut2 fails with mut5. This defines a second complementation group (a second gene).\n- mut3 fails with mut7. This defines a third complementation group (a third gene).\n\nThe statement that all other pairwise crosses complement confirms there are no further overlaps among these groups. Thus, the seven mutants partition into three distinct complementation groups corresponding to three different genes:\n- Gene A: mut1, mut4, mut6\n- Gene B: mut2, mut5\n- Gene C: mut3, mut7\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct genes represented is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1478595"}, {"introduction": "Geneticists often organize the results of pairwise crosses into a compact format known as a complementation grid.

The logic of a complementation test rests on a critical assumption about the nature of the mutations being studied. This final practice challenges you to think like an experimental geneticist and identify the essential control cross required to validate this assumption, ensuring that your conclusions are unambiguous and scientifically rigorous [@problem_id:1478597].", "problem": "A genetics researcher is studying the developmental pathway for eye color in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. Wild-type flies have red eyes. The researcher has isolated four different true-breeding mutant strains, each of which displays an identical bright orange eye color. The strains are named `mut1`, `mut2`, `mut3`, and `mut4`.\n\nTo determine how many different genes are represented by these four mutations, the researcher performs a series of complementation tests by systematically crossing the mutant strains to each other. The F1 progeny from each cross are scored for their eye color phenotype. Some of the initial results are as follows:\n\n- A cross between a `mut1` fly and a `mut2` fly yields F1 progeny that all have orange eyes.\n- A cross between a `mut1` fly and a `mut3` fly yields F1 progeny that all have red (wild-type) eyes.\n\nBased on these results, the researcher tentatively concludes that `mut1` and `mut2` are mutations in the same gene, while `mut1` and `mut3` are mutations in different genes. However, before proceeding, the researcher realizes that a critical set of control crosses was omitted. Without this control, the interpretation of the results is potentially invalid because a key assumption of the complementation test has not been verified.\n\nWhich of the following describes the essential control cross that must be performed for *each* of the four mutant strains to ensure the results of the complementation test can be interpreted unambiguously?\n\nA. Cross each mutant strain to a different, unrelated mutant strain (e.g., a strain with a wing-development defect).\n\nB. Cross each mutant strain to a true-breeding wild-type strain.\n\nC. Self-cross flies from each of the mutant strains.\n\nD. Perform reciprocal crosses for each pair of mutants (e.g., `mut1` female x `mut2` male and `mut2` female x `mut1` male).\n\nE. Backcross the F1 progeny from the `mut1` x `mut3` cross to the `mut1` parental strain.", "solution": "We apply the principles of the classical complementation test. The key logic is as follows:\n\n1) Principle of complementation for recessive mutations:\n- If two homozygous recessive mutants affect different genes, then crossing them should produce F1 that are heterozygous at each gene and thus carry at least one wild-type allele at each locus, yielding a wild-type phenotype.\n- If two homozygous recessive mutants affect the same gene, then crossing them produces F1 that are compound heterozygotes at that gene (e.g., $m_{1}/m_{2}$ at the same locus), lacking a functional wild-type allele, and thus show the mutant phenotype.\n\n2) Essential assumption that must be verified:\n- The above interpretation strictly requires that each mutant allele is recessive to a wild-type allele. Formally, for each mutant strain carrying $m/m$ at the causal locus, a cross to $+/+$ wild type must yield F1 of genotype $+/m$ with the wild-type phenotype, which demonstrates that $+$ is dominant to $m$.\n- If a mutant is dominant, semidominant, or haploinsufficient, then even if two mutations are in different genes, their F1 could exhibit a mutant phenotype, falsely suggesting noncomplementation. Therefore, verifying recessivity against wild type is the critical control.\n\n3) The necessary control cross:\n- For each mutant strain, cross the mutant ($m/m$) to a true-breeding wild type ($+/+$). The expected F1 genotype is $+/m$, which must display the wild-type phenotype if the mutant is recessive. Observing wild-type F1 in this control confirms the key assumption needed to interpret pairwise mutant-by-mutant crosses.\n\n4) Why the other options are insufficient:\n- A: Crossing to an unrelated mutant at an unrelated trait does not test recessivity of the eye-color mutation.\n- C: Self-crossing a true-breeding mutant yields only mutant progeny and provides no information about dominance relative to wild type.\n- D: Reciprocal crosses can reveal sex linkage or maternal effects but do not directly test the recessivity of each mutant to wild type, which is the core assumption for complementation interpretation.\n- E: A backcross from one successful complementation pair tests segregation or mapping features, not the global assumption of recessivity required for all strains.\n\nTherefore, the essential control is to cross each mutant strain to a true-breeding wild-type strain to confirm that each mutation is recessive to wild type, enabling unambiguous interpretation of the complementation results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1478597"}]}
