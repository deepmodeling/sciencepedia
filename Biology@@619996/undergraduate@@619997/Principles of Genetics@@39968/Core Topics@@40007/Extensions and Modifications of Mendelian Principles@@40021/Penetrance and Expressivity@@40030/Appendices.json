{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding penetrance begins with a simple but crucial calculation: determining the expected number of individuals in a population who carry a specific genotype but do not show the corresponding phenotype. This exercise provides a foundational scenario to practice this core concept. By working through it, you'll solidify your grasp of what a penetrance value, such as 86%, tangibly means for a group of organisms [@problem_id:1508242].", "problem": "In the field of genetics, penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant of a gene (genotype) that also express an associated trait (phenotype). A newly discovered deep-sea crustacean, *Cryoluxa profunda*, possesses a dominant allele, $F$, which is responsible for producing a fluorescent protein that makes the organism glow under specific frequencies of blue light. However, this trait exhibits incomplete penetrance.\n\nA research team is studying a captive population of *Cryoluxa profunda*. They have genetically screened a sample of 350 individuals and confirmed that every one of them carries at least one copy of the dominant $F$ allele. Previous large-scale studies have established that the penetrance for the fluorescence phenotype associated with the $F$ allele is 86%. It is also noted that among the crustaceans that do fluoresce, the intensity of the glow varies significantly from one individual to another.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the number of individuals in the screened sample that are expected to show no fluorescence.", "solution": "Penetrance is the probability that a carrier of the allele expresses the phenotype. Let $p$ denote the penetrance for fluorescence among carriers of the dominant $F$ allele. From the problem, $p=0.86$. The fraction of carriers who do not express the phenotype is therefore $1-p$, which equals $1-0.86=0.14$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of genetically confirmed carriers in the sample. From the problem, $N=350$. The expected number of non-fluorescent individuals is then given by the product of the total number of carriers and the non-expression fraction:\n$$\nN_{\\text{non-fluorescent}}=N\\,(1-p)=350\\times 0.14.\n$$\nCarrying out the multiplication,\n$$\n350\\times 0.14=49.\n$$\nTherefore, the expected number of individuals showing no fluorescence is $49$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{49}$$", "id": "1508242"}, {"introduction": "Genetic traits are rarely isolated. This practice challenges you to integrate the concept of incomplete penetrance with a classic Mendelian dihybrid cross, demonstrating how penetrance modifies expected phenotypic ratios. This requires a two-step approach: first, determining the genotypic probabilities from the cross, and second, applying the probability of expression to those genotypes. This skill is essential for predicting outcomes in more realistic genetic scenarios [@problem_id:1508239].", "problem": "In a genetic study of a fictional species, the Glimmerwing Butterfly (*Luminoptera ficta*), researchers are investigating two distinct, independently assorting traits: bioluminescence and wing pattern.\n\nThe ability to produce bioluminescence is controlled by the Lumi-1 gene. The dominant allele, $L$, confers the potential for luminescence, while the recessive allele, $l$, does not. However, the expression of the dominant allele is subject to incomplete penetrance. An individual with at least one $L$ allele (genotypes $LL$ or $Ll$) has a probability $P_L = 0.75$ of actually being luminescent. Individuals with the $ll$ genotype are never luminescent.\n\nThe wing pattern is controlled by the Stripe-Gene, which exhibits complete Mendelian dominance. The allele for striped wings, $S$, is dominant to the allele for solid-colored wings, $s$.\n\nTwo butterflies, both heterozygous for both genes (genotype $LlSs$), are crossed. Assuming the two genes are located on different chromosomes, what is the probability that an offspring from this cross will be non-luminescent and have striped wings? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let the two loci assort independently.

With incomplete penetrance, an $\\text{L-}$ individual is luminescent with probability $P_{L}$ and non-luminescent with probability $1-P_{L}$, while an $ll$ individual is always non-luminescent.

This problem introduces a powerful application of conditional probability, asking you to calculate the chance that a phenotypically healthy individual is a 'silent' carrier of a dominant allele. Mastering this type of calculation, which uses Bayesian reasoning, is key to understanding how geneticists assess risk in real-world family contexts [@problem_id:1508271].", "problem": "Crantz-Feldman Syndrome (CFS) is a rare, late-onset neurological disorder caused by a single autosomal dominant allele. However, not everyone who inherits the allele develops the disorder, a phenomenon known as incomplete penetrance.

The mother has no family history of CFS and is thus assumed to be homozygous for the recessive, normal allele. They have a child who has grown into adulthood and is phenotypically normal, showing no signs of CFS.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance patterns, determine the probability that this phenotypically normal child is a non-penetrant carrier of the dominant CFS allele.
