One such case is the existence of lethal alleles, which cause the death of an organism that carries them in a certain combination. This first exercise explores a classic scenario involving a recessive lethal allele, which only exerts its fatal effect in the homozygous state, leading to a modified genotypic ratio among the surviving progeny. By working through this problem [@problem_id:1500742], you will practice calculating the expected proportions of genotypes when one of the expected classes is entirely eliminated from the population.", "problem": "In a particular strain of ornamental corn, the gene for chlorophyll production has two alleles. The dominant allele, denoted by $G$, results in the normal green pigment. The recessive allele, denoted by $g$, leads to a lack of pigment, resulting in an albino phenotype. This recessive allele is also a recessive lethal allele, as albino seedlings are unable to perform photosynthesis and die a few days after germination.\n\nA plant geneticist takes a single heterozygous green corn plant ($Gg$) and allows it to self-pollinate, producing hundreds of seeds. These seeds are then planted in a greenhouse under ideal growing conditions. After two weeks, the surviving seedlings are counted and analyzed.\n\nWhat proportion of these surviving seedlings is expected to be true-breeding for the green color? Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proportion of surviving F2 generation seedlings that are true-breeding green, resulting from the self-pollination of a heterozygous ($Gg$) parent plant.\n\nFirst, we establish the parental cross. Since the plant is self-pollinating, the cross is $Gg \\times Gg$.\n\nNext, we determine the possible gametes produced by the heterozygous parent. Each parent produces two types of gametes, $G$ and $g$, in equal proportions (a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each).\n\nWe can use a Punnett square to find the expected genotypic ratio of the offspring at fertilization.\n\n| | $G$ ($\\frac{1}{2}$) | $g$ ($\\frac{1}{2}$) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **$G$ ($\\frac{1}{2}$)** | $GG$ ($\\frac{1}{4}$) | $Gg$ ($\\frac{1}{4}$) |\n| **$g$ ($\\frac{1}{2}$)** | $Gg$ ($\\frac{1}{4}$) | $gg$ ($\\frac{1}{4}$) |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the expected genotypic ratio at fertilization is:\n$\\frac{1}{4} GG : \\frac{1}{2} Gg : \\frac{1}{4} gg$.\nThis is the standard 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio.\n\nThe problem states that the homozygous recessive genotype, $gg$, is lethal. This means that any seedlings with this genotype will not survive. Therefore, we must exclude the $gg$ individuals when considering the population of \"surviving seedlings\".\n\nThe initial proportions of genotypes are:\n- $P(GG) = \\frac{1}{4}$ (Green, survives)\n- $P(Gg) = \\frac{1}{2}$ (Green, survives)\n- $P(gg) = \\frac{1}{4}$ (Albino, dies)\n\nThe total proportion of surviving seedlings is the sum of the proportions of the viable genotypes:\n$P(\\text{survivor}) = P(GG) + P(Gg) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe question asks for the proportion of *surviving* seedlings that are true-breeding. A \"true-breeding\" organism is homozygous for the trait in question. In this case, a true-breeding green plant must have the genotype $GG$.\n\nWe need to find the conditional probability of a seedling being $GG$, given that it has survived. This is calculated as:\n$P(GG | \\text{survivor}) = \\frac{P(GG \\cap \\text{survivor})}{P(\\text{survivor})}$\nSince all $GG$ individuals are survivors, the intersection $P(GG \\cap \\text{survivor})$ is simply $P(GG)$.\n$P(GG | \\text{survivor}) = \\frac{P(GG)}{P(\\text{survivor})} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4}$\n\n$P(GG | \\text{survivor}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the ratio of the surviving genotypes. The initial ratio of fertilized zygotes is $1 GG : 2 Gg : 1 gg$. After the $gg$ individuals die, the ratio among the survivors becomes $1 GG : 2 Gg$.\n\nThe total number of \"parts\" in this surviving population is $1 (\\text{for } GG) + 2 (\\text{for } Gg) = 3$.\nThe number of \"parts\" corresponding to true-breeding green plants ($GG$) is 1.\nTherefore, the proportion of surviving seedlings that are true-breeding green is $\\frac{1}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "1500742"}, {"introduction": "A key consequence of recessive lethal alleles is that they can 'hide' in a population within healthy, heterozygous individuals who act as carriers. This allows the allele to persist across generations, even though it is fatal in the homozygous state. This practice problem [@problem_id:1515938] challenges you to apply conditional probability to determine the likelihood that a phenotypically normal individual from a specific cross is, in fact, a carrier of a hidden lethal allele. This skill is fundamental to genetic counseling and understanding the dynamics of inherited diseases.", "problem": "In the field of developmental genetics, researchers are studying a newly discovered gene in a model organism, the bioluminescent nematode *Caelus elegans*. This gene, named *Vita*, plays a crucial role in early embryonic development.\n\nThe dominant allele, `V`, allows for normal development and results in a nematode with a characteristic vibrant blue glow under ultraviolet light. A recessive allele, `v`, has been identified. While heterozygotes (`Vv`) are phenotypically indistinguishable from homozygous dominant (`VV`) individuals, homozygous recessive (`vv`) embryos fail to develop past the gastrulation stage and are therefore non-viable.\n\nA cross is performed between two nematodes that are both heterozygous for the *Vita* gene.

Define events: $S$ = survives to be observed as offspring, $C$ = carrier ($Vv$), and $B$ = exhibits the blue glow. Since both $VV$ and $Vv$ are viable and both exhibit the blue glow, and $vv$ is non-viable and absent, we have $S$ and $B$ equivalent for observed offspring. Thus conditioning on “a surviving offspring that exhibits the blue glow” is equivalent to conditioning on $S$.\n\nThe probability a randomly selected surviving offspring is a carrier is\n$$\nP(C \\mid S)=\\frac{P(C \\cap S)}{P(S)}.\n$$\nAll carriers survive, so $P(C \\cap S)=P(C)=\\frac{1}{2}$.
