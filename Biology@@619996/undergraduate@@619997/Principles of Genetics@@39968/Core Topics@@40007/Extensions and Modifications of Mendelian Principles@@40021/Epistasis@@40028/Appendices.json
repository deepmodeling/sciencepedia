A geneticist performs a cross between a pure-breeding plant with blue petals and a pure-breeding plant with white petals. The blue-flowered parent has genotype $AABB$ and the white-flowered parent has genotype $aabb$. All offspring in the resulting F1 generation have blue petals.\n\nSubsequently, an F1 individual is subjected to a testcross with a white-flowered plant of genotype $aabb$.

The `a` allele is recessive, and the `aa` genotype is epistatic to the `B/b` locus. This occurs because Gene A is required to produce a precursor pigment that Gene B then modifies.\nB. The `A` allele is dominant and epistatic to the `B/b` locus. This occurs because Gene A produces an inhibitor that prevents the expression of any color.\nC. Recessive alleles at either locus (`aa` or `bb`) can produce a white phenotype, representing a case of complementary gene action where both dominant alleles are required for color.\nD. The two genes assort independently with no epistasis. The three phenotypes arise because the B/b locus exhibits incomplete dominance.\nE. The two genes are linked on the same chromosome, and the observed phenotypic ratio results from a specific recombination frequency between them.", "solution": "The problem asks us to deduce the genetic interaction between two genes, A/a and B/b, based on the results of a series of crosses.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial cross and the F1 generation.**\nThe parental (P) cross is between a pure-breeding blue plant ($AABB$) and a pure-breeding white plant ($aabb$).\nP cross: $AABB$ (Blue) × $aabb$ (White)\nThe F1 generation is the offspring of this cross. The gamete from the first parent is $AB$, and the gamete from the second parent is $ab$.\nF1 genotype: $AaBb$\nThe problem states that all F1 individuals have blue petals. Therefore, the genotype $AaBb$ corresponds to the blue phenotype.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the testcross and its expected progeny.**\nAn F1 individual ($AaBb$) is testcrossed with a homozygous recessive individual ($aabb$).\nTestcross: $AaBb$ × $aabb$\nSince the genes are unlinked, the $AaBb$ parent produces four types of gametes in equal proportions: $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$ (each with a frequency of 1/4). The $aabb$ parent produces only one type of gamete: $ab$.\nThe resulting progeny genotypes will be in the following proportions:\n- $1/4 AaBb$\n- $1/4 Aabb$\n- $1/4 aaBb$\n- $1/4 aabb$\nIf there were no gene interaction (epistasis) and each genotype produced a unique phenotype, we would expect a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the expected genotypic ratio to the observed phenotypic ratio.**\nThe observed phenotypic ratio is 1 blue : 1 yellow : 2 white. This can be written as fractions of the total progeny:\n- $1/4$ Blue\n- $1/4$ Yellow\n- $2/4$ (or $1/2$) White\n\nWe must now map the four equally likely genotypes from Step 2 to these three phenotypes.\n- From Step 1, we know $AaBb$ results in a blue phenotype. This accounts for the $1/4$ Blue progeny.\n- This leaves the genotypes $Aabb$, $aaBb$, and $aabb$ to account for the $1/4$ Yellow and $2/4$ White progeny.\n- To get a $1/4$ proportion for the yellow phenotype, it must correspond to a single genotypic class. Let's assign $Aabb$ to the yellow phenotype.\n- This leaves the remaining two genotypes, $aaBb$ and $aabb$, to account for the $2/4$ white progeny. This is consistent, as $1/4 aaBb + 1/4 aabb = 2/4$ of the progeny. So, both $aaBb$ and $aabb$ must produce the white phenotype.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce the type of gene interaction.**\nLet's summarize our genotype-phenotype map:\n- $AaBb$ -> Blue\n- $Aabb$ -> Yellow\n- $aaBb$ -> White\n- $aabb$ -> White\n\nFrom this mapping, we can see that whenever the genotype is homozygous recessive for the A gene ($aa$), the phenotype is white, regardless of the alleles at the B locus ($B\\_$ or $bb$). This is the definition of **recessive epistasis**, where the recessive genotype at one locus ($aa$) masks the expression of the other locus ($B/b$).\n\nThis interaction can be explained by a biochemical pathway:\n1.  A colorless precursor is converted into a yellow pigment by the enzyme encoded by the dominant allele $A$.\n2.  The yellow pigment is then converted into a blue pigment by the enzyme encoded by the dominant allele $B$.\n- $A\\_B\\_$ (like $AaBb$): Both enzymes are functional. Precursor -> Yellow -> Blue. Phenotype: Blue.\n- $A\\_bb$ (like $Aabb$): Only the first enzyme is functional. Precursor -> Yellow. The second step is blocked. Phenotype: Yellow.\n- $aa\\_\\_$ (like $aaBb$ and $aabb$): The first enzyme is non-functional. The precursor is not converted to yellow. The second enzyme has no yellow substrate to act upon. Phenotype: White.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A:** States that `$aa$` is epistatic to `$B/b$`, which is exactly what we deduced. It also provides the correct biochemical rationale: Gene A produces a precursor for Gene B. This statement is correct.\n- **B:** Describes dominant epistasis, where a dominant allele `$A$` would mask the `$B/b$` locus. If this were true, `$AaBb$` and `$Aabb$` would share the same phenotype, which contradicts the data (one is blue, the other is yellow). This is incorrect.\n- **C:** Describes duplicate recessive epistasis (`9:7` F2 ratio from a dihybrid cross), where being homozygous recessive at *either* locus (`$aa$` or `$bb$`) gives the same phenotype. This would mean `$Aabb$` (due to `$bb$`) would also be white, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1 Blue : 3 White in the testcross. This is incorrect.\n- **D:** Claims no epistasis. The 1:1:2 ratio clearly indicates a gene interaction is occurring, as it deviates from the expected 1:1:1:1 non-epistatic testcross ratio. Incomplete dominance at one locus would still result in four distinct phenotypic classes if the other gene acts independently (e.g., Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, Green from `$AaBb$`, `$Aabb$`, `$aaBb$`, `$aabb$`). This is incorrect.\n- **E:** Proposes linkage as the explanation. Linkage alters the frequency of gametes produced by the F1, thus changing the progeny genotypic ratios from 1:1:1:1. However, it does not explain why two different genotypes (`$aaBb$` and `$aabb$`) produce the same phenotype. The collapsing of genotypic classes into a smaller number of phenotypic classes is the result of epistasis. Therefore, epistasis must be involved.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement A provides the only accurate description of the genetic system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1486198"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of genetics becomes more powerful when we can synthesize multiple principles to solve complex problems.
