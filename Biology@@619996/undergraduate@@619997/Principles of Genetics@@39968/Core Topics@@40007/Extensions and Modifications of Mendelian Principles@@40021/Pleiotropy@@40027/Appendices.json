The allele $V$ is dominant and results in a variegated leaf pattern, while the recessive allele $v$ results in normal green leaves. However, the homozygous dominant genotype $VV$ is lethal during the embryonic stage, and individuals with this genotype do not survive to germination.\n\nThe second gene controls fruit color. The allele $R$ is dominant for red fruit, while the recessive allele $r$ results in yellow fruit.\n\nTwo parent plants, both with the genotype $VvRr$, are crossed.

Under normal conditions, these wild-type (`WT`) cells proliferate with a consistent cell cycle time.\n\nGeneticists discover a dominant, gain-of-function mutation in the `PKX1` gene, denoted `pkx1-D`. This mutation renders the kinase constitutively active, leading to severe pleiotropic effects. Cells with the `pkx1-D` genotype (`pkx1-D/pkx1-D`) are unable to divide due to a permanent cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, they exhibit a high rate of apoptosis; specifically, 50% of the `pkx1-D` cell population dies during the time it takes a `WT` cell to complete one division cycle.\n\nFurther investigation reveals that a complete loss-of-function (null) allele of the substrate gene, `sub1-Δ`, acts as a suppressor. Cells homozygous for both mutations (`pkx1-D/pkx1-D`; `sub1-Δ/sub1-Δ`) are phenotypically indistinguishable from `WT` cells, exhibiting a normal cell cycle and viability.\n\nA competition experiment is initiated in a liquid culture with equal numbers of three cell types:\n1.

Solving this challenge requires a careful integration of pleiotropy with the concepts of incomplete penetrance and gene interaction, reflecting the intricate, interconnected nature of genetic networks.", "problem": "In a hypothetical diploid fungus, cellular architecture and development are governed by a complex network of proteins. A key scaffolding protein, encoded by the `SCAF` gene, is crucial for organizing two distinct cellular processes. A temperature-sensitive point mutation in this gene gives rise to the `scaf_ts` allele. At the permissive temperature of 22°C, the `scaf_ts` allele functions identically to the wild-type `SCAF+` allele. However, at the restrictive temperature of 35°C, the `scaf_ts/scaf_ts` homozygous genotype exhibits a pleiotropic effect.\n\nFirst, due to a loss of proper interaction with cytoskeletal components, it causes a \"Filamentation Defect\" (FD) phenotype. This FD phenotype has a penetrance of 80%.\n\nSecond, the mutation paradoxically stabilizes the scaffolding protein's interaction with a specific kinase complex, leading to a \"Spore Discoloration\" (SD) phenotype. The penetrance of this SD phenotype is dependent on a second, unlinked gene called `KREG`. In the presence of at least one wild-type `KREG+` allele, the SD phenotype has a penetrance of 60%. However, in a `kreg-/kreg-` homozygous recessive background, the kinase complex is less active, and the penetrance of the SD phenotype is reduced to 30%. The Filamentation Defect (FD) phenotype is not affected by the `KREG` gene.\n\nAssume that for any given individual, the occurrence of the FD phenotype and the SD phenotype are independent events.\n\nA true-breeding strain with the genotype `scaf_ts/scaf_ts ; KREG+/KREG+` is crossed with a true-breeding wild-type strain `SCAF+/SCAF+ ; kreg-/kreg-`.
