This practice challenges you to apply the fundamental rules of molecular recognition that govern this process. By determining the correct anticodon and its associated amino acid [@problem_id:1531712], you will solidify your understanding of base-pairing and the antiparallel nature of nucleic acid interactions, which form the bedrock of the genetic code.", "problem": "During an *in vitro* study of translation elongation, a researcher uses ribosomal profiling to determine the precise location of a ribosome on a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The analysis reveals that the codon currently positioned in the aminoacyl (A) site of the ribosome is 5'-CGA-3'. A pool of charged transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules is available in the system.\n\nYour task is to determine which tRNA will be recruited to the A site and the amino acid it carries. The anticodon of the tRNA must be written in the standard 5' to 3' orientation.

The tRNA anticodon must pair with this codon by Watson-Crick base pairing and in antiparallel orientation. Using the base-pairing rules (C pairs with G, G pairs with C, A pairs with U), the anticodon sequence that pairs with 5'-CGA-3' is written antiparallel as 3'-GCU-5'. To express the anticodon in the required 5' to 3' orientation, reverse this sequence to obtain 5'-UCG-3'.\n\nNext, identify the amino acid encoded by the codon CGA using the standard genetic code. The codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG all encode arginine.

This problem explores the critical role of elongation factors, specifically by presenting a hypothetical scenario with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog. Investigating how this modification arrests the ribosome [@problem_id:2346195] will help you dissect the intricate molecular mechanism of tRNA delivery and accommodation, revealing why GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu is an essential checkpoint for moving the cycle forward.", "problem": "An *in vitro* prokaryotic translation system is reconstituted from purified components. The system contains 70S ribosomes, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, all necessary charged transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and the required protein elongation factors. The ribosome has successfully initiated translation, with the initiator tRNA carrying N-formylmethionine (fMet-tRNA) properly positioned in the P site. The A site is currently vacant and positioned over the second codon of the mRNA.\n\nFor the elongation phase to proceed, this system is supplied with all the required components, except that the standard Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is completely replaced with GTPγS, a synthetic analog that can bind to GTP-binding proteins but cannot be hydrolyzed.\n\nGiven this setup, at which of the following stages will the translation elongation cycle be terminally arrested?\n\nA. The ribosome remains with a vacant A site because the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA complex cannot bind.\n\nB. An aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the A site, and the fMet is successfully transferred to it forming a dipeptide, but the ribosome is unable to translocate.\n\nC. The Elongation Factor G (EF-G)-GTPγS complex binds to the ribosome, but translocation fails to occur, freezing the ribosome in a pre-translocation state.\n\nD. The ternary complex, consisting of Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu), GTPγS, and an aminoacyl-tRNA, binds to the A site but cannot dissociate, preventing peptide bond formation.\n\nE. The ribosome undergoes one full round of elongation and translocation, but becomes stalled when EF-G-GTPγS remains bound to the ribosome after translocation, blocking the next cycle.", "solution": "The elongation cycle on a bacterial 70S ribosome proceeds through these obligatory steps once initiation has placed fMet-tRNA in the P site and the A site is positioned over the second codon:\n\n1) Delivery and initial selection: EF-Tu bound to GTP forms a ternary complex with an aminoacyl-tRNA. This ternary complex binds to the A site and samples codon-anticodon pairing. Correct pairing stimulates EF-Tu GTPase activity.\n\n2) GTP hydrolysis and accommodation: Hydrolysis of GTP on EF-Tu induces a conformational change that lowers EF-Tu’s affinity for tRNA and the ribosome, allowing EF-Tu-GDP to dissociate. Only after EF-Tu release can the aminoacyl-tRNA fully accommodate into the peptidyl transferase center (A/A state). This accommodation is a prerequisite for peptidyl transfer.\n\n3) Peptidyl transfer: The ribosomal peptidyl transferase catalyzes peptide bond formation between the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site. This chemistry does not require GTP hydrolysis, but it strictly requires that the A-site tRNA be accommodated, which in turn requires prior EF-Tu GTP hydrolysis and release.\n\n4) Translocation: EF-G bound to GTP binds the pre-translocation ribosome and, upon GTP hydrolysis, drives movement of the tRNAs and mRNA to the next register, freeing the A site for the next cycle.\n\nNow replace GTP with the nonhydrolyzable analog GTP$\\gamma$S. GTP$\\gamma$S can bind GTPases (EF-Tu, EF-G) but cannot be hydrolyzed. Applying this to each step:\n\n- Step 1 proceeds: EF-Tu-GTP$\\gamma$S forms a ternary complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and can bind the A site with proper codon recognition.\n- Step 2 fails: Because GTP$\\gamma$S cannot be hydrolyzed, EF-Tu cannot undergo the hydrolysis-driven conformational change required for release. Consequently, the ternary complex remains ribosome-bound in the A/T state, and the aminoacyl-tRNA cannot accommodate into the peptidyl transferase center. Without accommodation, peptidyl transfer cannot occur.\n- Steps 3 and 4 therefore cannot be reached; EF-G action is irrelevant because the block occurs earlier.\n\nThis mechanistic analysis eliminates:\n- A: incorrect, because the ternary complex can bind the A site with GTP$\\gamma$S.\n- B: incorrect, because peptidyl transfer cannot occur without EF-Tu hydrolysis and release-driven accommodation.\n- C and E: incorrect, because the cycle stalls before EF-G engagement; EF-G-dependent translocation is never reached.\n\nThe stall point corresponds to the ternary complex binding but being unable to dissociate and permit accommodation, thereby preventing peptide bond formation, which matches option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2346195"}, {"introduction": "How does the ribosome achieve such remarkable accuracy, distinguishing correct from incorrect tRNAs that may differ by only a single hydrogen bond?
