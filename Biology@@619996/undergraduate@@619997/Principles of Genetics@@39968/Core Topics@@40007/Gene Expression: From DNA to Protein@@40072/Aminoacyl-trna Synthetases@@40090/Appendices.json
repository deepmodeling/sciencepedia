This first exercise [@problem_id:1468663] explores a hypothetical scenario where this translation is fundamentally altered, challenging you to predict the immediate consequence. By considering a mutation that changes the synthetase's amino acid preference, you can clarify the distinct roles of the synthetase and the ribosome in maintaining translational fidelity.", "problem": "In the process of protein synthesis, the fidelity of translation is critically dependent on the accuracy of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Each of these enzymes is responsible for attaching a specific amino acid to its corresponding set of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. This \"charging\" reaction creates an aminoacyl-tRNA, which then participates in translation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell line in which a mutation has occurred in the gene encoding seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS). This mutation alters the amino acid binding pocket of the SerRS enzyme, causing it to lose its ability to recognize its normal substrate, the amino acid serine. Instead, the mutated enzyme now exclusively recognizes and binds the amino acid threonine. However, the mutation does not affect the enzyme's ability to recognize and bind its cognate tRNAs, the seryl-tRNAs ($\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}}$). All other components of the translational machinery, including the threonyl-tRNA synthetase, threonine codons, and serine codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs), are normal.\n\nWhat would be the most direct and immediate consequence for proteins synthesized in this cell line?\n\nA. Threonine would be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at positions specified by serine codons.\n\nB. Serine would be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at positions specified by threonine codons.\n\nC. Translation would halt at serine codons because the ribosome would reject the incorrectly charged tRNA.\n\nD. The seryl-tRNA's anticodon would be modified by the mutated synthetase to match a threonine codon.", "solution": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure translational fidelity by attaching the correct amino acid to its cognate tRNA; the ribosome then selects tRNAs based on codon-anticodon base pairing without checking the attached amino acid. Normally, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) catalyzes the reaction\n$$\n\\text{Ser} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Ser-tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_\\text{i}\n$$\nIn the mutant described, the enzyme’s amino acid recognition pocket has switched specificity from serine to threonine while retaining recognition of $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}}$. Therefore, the charging reaction becomes\n$$\n\\text{Thr} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Thr-tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_\\text{i}\n$$\nBecause codon recognition during translation depends on the anticodon of the tRNA, $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}}$ will still base pair with serine codons on mRNAs. However, these $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}}$ molecules now carry threonine. The ribosome does not proofread the amino acid on the tRNA; it accepts any amino acid attached to a tRNA whose anticodon correctly pairs with the codon. Consequently, at positions in the polypeptide specified by serine codons, threonine will be incorporated.\n\nAll other possibilities are inconsistent with these principles: serine will not be redirected to threonine codons (the mutated enzyme does not charge $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Thr}}$), translation will not halt at serine codons because the ribosome does not reject misacylated tRNAs based on amino acid identity, and the synthetase does not modify tRNA anticodons to change codon specificity.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is incorporation of threonine at positions specified by serine codons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1468663"}, {"introduction": "While the synthetase selects the correct amino acid, it must also correctly identify its partner tRNA from a large, structurally similar pool. This practice [@problem_id:2030990] investigates this recognition process by altering a tRNA's anticodon, the part that interacts with the mRNA template. This classic thought experiment reveals that tRNA identity is determined by specific structural features across the molecule, often called the \"second genetic code,\" not just by the anticodon loop.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment aiming to investigate the specificity of the translational machinery, a researcher modifies the gene for an alanine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), denoted as $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$. The modification is highly specific: the nucleotide triplet in the anticodon loop of $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ is altered to become the anticodon for the amino acid cysteine. This engineered tRNA is then introduced into a cell-free in vitro translation system, which is fully equipped for protein synthesis. The system contains functional ribosomes, a pool of all 20 standard amino acids (including alanine and cysteine), all necessary enzymatic factors, a complete set of functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and a synthetic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) template that includes multiple codons for cysteine.\n\nIt is given that the modification of the anticodon does not significantly alter the overall three-dimensional structure of the tRNA molecule, allowing its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to still recognize and charge it with an amino acid. Which amino acid will be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain when the ribosome encounters a cysteine codon on the mRNA template?\n\nA. Cysteine\n\nB. Alanine\n\nC. Methionine\n\nD. No amino acid will be incorporated, causing translation to stall.\n\nE. Both Cysteine and Alanine, with equal probability.", "solution": "Key principle: Translational fidelity is enforced primarily at the aminoacylation step by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which recognize identity elements in the tRNA and attach the corresponding amino acid. The ribosome monitors codon-anticodon pairing but does not verify the amino acid attached to the tRNA.\n\nApply to the scenario:\n1. The engineered tRNA is derived from $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ but has its anticodon altered to pair with a cysteine codon. It is given that this change does not disrupt the tRNA identity elements or overall structure required for recognition by its cognate alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS).\n2. Therefore, AlaRS will charge this modified tRNA with alanine, not cysteine, because aaRS recognition depends on tRNA identity elements (often in the acceptor stem and elsewhere), not solely on the anticodon.\n3. In the ribosome, when a cysteine codon appears in the A site, the modified tRNA with the cysteine-recognizing anticodon will base-pair correctly with that codon and be accepted.\n4. The ribosome will incorporate the amino acid attached to this tRNA into the growing polypeptide. Because the tRNA was charged by AlaRS, the attached amino acid is alanine.\n5. Thus, alanine is incorporated at positions specified by cysteine codons. Translation does not stall, and cysteine is not incorporated, because the ribosome does not check the amino acid.\n\nConclusion: The amino acid incorporated is alanine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2030990"}, {"introduction": "How do cells achieve near-perfect accuracy when some amino acids are almost chemically identical to each other? This final practice [@problem_id:2303560] introduces the crucial concept of enzymatic proofreading, a second chance for the synthetase to correct its own mistakes. By examining the impact of a disabled editing domain, you will understand how this two-step verification process is essential for preventing misincorporation and maintaining a high-fidelity proteome.", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is critically dependent on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), enzymes that catalyze the attachment of a specific amino acid to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is called tRNA charging. Some aaRS enzymes possess a hydrolytic editing domain that acts as a proofreading mechanism to remove incorrectly attached amino acids.\n\nA well-studied example is isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which is responsible for charging isoleucine (Ile) onto its cognate tRNA, $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$. Due to the high structural similarity between isoleucine and valine (Val), IleRS occasionally binds valine by mistake in its activation site.\n\nConsider a bacterial strain with a mutation that renders the hydrolytic editing domain of its IleRS enzyme completely non-functional. However, the domains responsible for amino acid activation and tRNA charging remain fully active. What is the most likely consequence of this mutation on proteins synthesized within these bacterial cells?\n\nA. Valine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where isoleucine is specified by the genetic code.\n\nB. Isoleucine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where valine is specified by the genetic code.\n\nC. Protein synthesis will be significantly reduced or halted because $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$ cannot be properly charged.\n\nD. The ribosome will reject the incorrectly charged $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$, preventing any errors in the final protein sequence.\n\nE. Leucine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where isoleucine is specified by the genetic code.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) determine the amino acid identity attached to a given tRNA; the ribosome selects tRNAs based on codon-anticodon pairing, not by verifying the attached amino acid.\n- IleRS normally activates isoleucine but can misactivate valine due to structural similarity. An editing (hydrolytic) domain proofreads by hydrolyzing misactivated valine or mischarged valyl-tRNA to prevent errors.\n- If the editing domain is non-functional while activation and charging remain intact, mischarged tRNAs will accumulate.\n\nMechanism:\n1. Normal charging reaction (intended):\n$$\n\\text{Ile} + \\text{ATP} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{IleRS}} \\text{Ile-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_\\text{i}\n$$\n2. Erroneous activation that occurs due to amino acid similarity:\n$$\n\\text{Val} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{IleRS activation site}} \\text{Val-AMP} + \\text{PP}_\\text{i}\n$$\n3. With a functional editing domain, the enzyme performs pre-transfer or post-transfer hydrolysis to remove valine:\n- Pre-transfer editing: hydrolysis of $\\text{Val-AMP}$.\n- Post-transfer editing: hydrolysis of $\\text{Val-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$.\n4. In the mutant lacking hydrolytic editing, step 3 fails. Consequently, the enzyme proceeds to mischarge:\n$$\n\\text{Val} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{IleRS (no editing)}} \\text{Val-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}\n$$\n5. During translation, the ribosome accepts $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$ at isoleucine codons (AUU, AUC, AUA) based on correct anticodon pairing. The ribosome does not verify the attached amino acid, so the amino acid delivered by $\\text{Val-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$ at these codons will be valine.\n\nConsequences and option analysis:\n- A: Valine will be incorporated at positions where isoleucine is specified. This follows directly from steps 4–5.\n- B: Incorrect; this would require mischarging of $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Val}}$ with isoleucine, which is not implied by an IleRS editing defect.\n- C: Incorrect; activation and charging domains are intact, so $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$ will still be charged (albeit sometimes with valine), and translation will proceed.\n- D: Incorrect; the ribosome does not reject correctly base-paired tRNAs based on their amino acid cargo.\n- E: Incorrect; leucine is handled by leucyl-tRNA synthetase; the specificity issue in IleRS concerns valine, not leucine.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is misincorporation of valine at isoleucine codons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2303560"}]}
