The concept of signal peptides acting as molecular \"zip codes\" is central to solving this complex logistical problem. This exercise provides a classic test of this principle, exploring the idea that a signal sequence is not only necessary but also sufficient for targeting. By hypothetically attaching a mitochondrial \"zip code\" to a protein that normally resides in the cytosol, you can directly probe the power and specificity of these essential targeting signals. [@problem_id:1515383]", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying protein localization in a eukaryotic cell line. They focus on two proteins: Protein A, an enzyme that is normally found and functions in the cytosol, and Protein B, a component of the electron transport chain that resides within the mitochondrial matrix. Genetic analysis reveals that Protein A lacks any N-terminal or C-terminal targeting signals. In contrast, Protein B has a specific N-terminal amino acid sequence that acts as a mitochondrial targeting signal.\n\nThe biologist performs a genetic engineering experiment to create a new fusion gene. This fusion gene consists of the DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal from Protein B, ligated directly to the full coding sequence of Protein A. This new gene is then introduced into the eukaryotic cells, where it is successfully transcribed and translated.\n\nAssuming the fusion protein folds correctly and the targeting signal remains functional, in which cellular compartment would you predominantly expect to find the newly synthesized fusion protein?\n\nA. In the cytosol\n\nB. In the nucleus\n\nC. Secreted outside the cell\n\nD. In the mitochondrial matrix\n\nE. In the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum", "solution": "The problem asks where a fusion protein will localize when an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) from a known mitochondrial matrix protein (Protein B) is fused to a normally cytosolic protein (Protein A), assuming correct folding and a functional targeting signal.\n\nRelevant cell biological principles:\n1) Default localization: In the absence of any targeting signal, nuclear-encoded proteins synthesized on free ribosomes remain in the cytosol. Protein A lacks targeting signals in its native form and therefore is normally cytosolic.\n2) Mitochondrial targeting presequences: Proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix typically contain an N-terminal, positively charged, amphipathic helix (the MTS). This presequence is recognized post-translationally by receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane (e.g., TOM complex).\n3) Import pathway to the matrix: The MTS directs the protein through the TOM complex across the outer membrane and then through the TIM23 complex across the inner membrane. Translocation is driven by the membrane potential across the inner membrane and ATP-dependent chaperones. Once in the matrix, the MTS is usually cleaved by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, yielding the mature protein localized in the matrix.\n4) Specificity of other pathways:\n- Nuclear localization requires a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is not provided by a mitochondrial presequence.\n- Entry into the secretory pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum lumen requires an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by the signal recognition particle and the Sec61 translocon; a mitochondrial presequence does not serve this role.\n- Secretion outside the cell proceeds via the ER-Golgi pathway and likewise requires an ER signal peptide.\n\nApplication to the fusion:\n- The fusion places the N-terminal MTS of Protein B at the N-terminus of Protein A. This positioning is critical because mitochondrial presequences function at the N-terminus.\n- Protein A is a soluble cytosolic enzyme without membrane-spanning segments; adding only an MTS and no additional hydrophobic stop-transfer domains will target it for complete translocation into the mitochondrial matrix rather than integration into membranes or retention in the intermembrane space.\n- Therefore, the functional MTS is sufficient to reroute the fusion protein from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nThus, the newly synthesized fusion protein would predominantly localize to the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nElimination of options:\n- A (cytosol): Incorrect, because the added MTS redirects import to mitochondria.\n- B (nucleus): Incorrect, no NLS present.\n- C (secreted): Incorrect, no ER signal peptide; mitochondrial presequences are not recognized by SRP.\n- D (mitochondrial matrix): Correct, fits the import mechanism for N-terminal presequences without stop-transfer segments.\n- E (ER lumen): Incorrect, requires an ER signal peptide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1515383"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply arriving at the correct organelle, many proteins must be precisely woven into a membrane in a specific orientation.

An N-terminal signal sequence, which directs the protein to the ER and is subsequently cleaved by signal peptidase in the ER lumen.\n2.  A region of the polypeptide chain designated as Loop 1.\n3.

Let's trace this process step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initiation of Translocation:** Protein synthesis begins on a free ribosome in the cytosol. As the N-terminus of the polypeptide emerges, the N-terminal signal sequence is exposed. This sequence is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which temporarily halts translation and targets the entire ribosome-mRNA-polypeptide complex to the ER membrane. The complex docks with the translocon (Sec61 channel).\n\n2.  **First Translocation and Cleavage:** Translation resumes, and the polypeptide chain is threaded through the translocon into the ER lumen, N-terminus first. The N-terminal signal sequence enters the lumen and is cleaved by signal peptidase. This cleavage event releases the original N-terminus. The portion of the protein immediately following the cleavage site becomes the new, mature N-terminus. This mature N-terminus is now located inside the ER lumen.\n\n3.  **Action of the Stop-Transfer Sequence:** Translation continues, and the polypeptide chain, including the region \"Loop 1\", is fed into the ER lumen. When the internal, hydrophobic stop-transfer anchor sequence is synthesized and enters the translocon, it acts as a halt signal. The translocon channel closes, and the stop-transfer sequence slides laterally out of the channel to become embedded in the lipid bilayer as the first transmembrane helix. This event halts the translocation process.\n\n4.  **Cytosolic Synthesis:** With translocation stopped, the ribosome (which is still attached to the outside of the translocon) continues to synthesize the remainder of the protein. The portion of the polypeptide immediately C-terminal to the stop-transfer sequence, which is \"Loop 2\", is synthesized into the cytosol.\n\n5.  **Action of the Start-Transfer Sequence:** Synthesis proceeds in the cytosol until the internal, hydrophobic start-transfer sequence is produced. This sequence functions as a new signal peptide. It directs the ribosome and the polypeptide chain to a new or the same translocon and initiates a second round of translocation. The start-transfer sequence itself inserts into the membrane, becoming the second transmembrane helix. The portion of the polypeptide C-terminal to this sequence is threaded through the translocon into the ER lumen.\n\n6.  **Completion of Synthesis:** The final C-terminal region of the protein is synthesized and translocated completely into the ER lumen. Translation terminates, the ribosome dissociates, and the C-terminus of the mature protein is released into the ER lumen.\n\n**Summary of Final Topology:**\n- The N-terminal signal sequence is gone.\n- The mature N-terminus is in the ER lumen.\n- The stop-transfer sequence forms the first transmembrane domain.\n- The \"Loop 2\" segment connects the two transmembrane domains and is located in the cytosol.\n- The start-transfer sequence forms the second transmembrane domain.\n- The C-terminus is in the ER lumen.\n\nTherefore, the mature MP-7 protein is a double-pass (two transmembrane domains) protein with both its mature N-terminus and its C-terminus located in the ER lumen.

This advanced exercise places you in the role of a research scientist, tasking you not with applying a known rule, but with deducing a new one. By interpreting a series of experimental results, you will piece together a model for a novel, regulated targeting pathway, honing your skills in scientific reasoning and data synthesis. [@problem_id:1515340]", "problem": "A virologist is investigating how a newly discovered viral protein, VEP-X, is targeted to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) of its host cell. It is known that VEP-X possesses an N-terminal sequence that resembles a canonical ER signal peptide. The virologist hypothesizes that the targeting process is regulated by a specific cytosolic host protein, which she names Host Chaperone Factor 1 (HCF-1). To test this hypothesis, a series of experiments are conducted, yielding the following observations:\n\n1.  **In Vitro Translocation Assay 1:** When mRNA for VEP-X is translated in an *in vitro* system containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreatic microsomes (ER-derived vesicles), the newly synthesized VEP-X protein does not translocate into the microsomes and is fully degraded when a protease is added to the system.\n\n2.  **In Vitro Translocation Assay 2:** The experiment is repeated, but this time, purified HCF-1 protein is also added to the *in vitro* system. In this case, the VEP-X protein is successfully translocated into the microsomes. This is confirmed by its resistance to externally added protease and by a shift to a slightly lower molecular weight on a gel, consistent with signal peptide cleavage.\n\n3.  **Cellular Localization of a Fusion Protein:** A genetic construct is created that fuses the coding sequence of the VEP-X N-terminal signal peptide directly to the N-terminus of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a reporter protein. When this `SignalPeptide-GFP` construct is expressed in the host cells (which naturally contain HCF-1), fluorescence is observed in a reticular pattern characteristic of the ER.\n\n4.  **Effect of HCF-1 Depletion:** Another genetic construct encoding the full-length VEP-X protein fused to GFP (`VEP-X-GFP`) is expressed in host cells. In normal host cells, the fusion protein localizes to the ER. However, when the same `VEP-X-GFP` construct is expressed in host cells where HCF-1 has been depleted using RNA interference (RNAi), the fusion protein shows diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, failing to localize to the ER.\n\nBased on these four experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive model for the ER targeting of VEP-X?\n\nA. The VEP-X signal peptide is intrinsically functional but is sequestered in a non-functional conformation within the full-length protein. Binding of HCF-1 to the VEP-X protein induces a conformational change that exposes the signal peptide, allowing it to be recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) for ER targeting.\n\nB. HCF-1 is a universal co-factor for the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) in this host organism, and all ER-targeted proteins require HCF-1 for their translocation.\n\nC. The VEP-X signal peptide is non-functional. HCF-1 mediates an alternative, signal peptide-independent pathway for targeting VEP-X to the ER translocon.\n\nD. HCF-1 is a transcription factor required for the expression of essential components of the ER translocation machinery. Its depletion indirectly prevents VEP-X from being imported.\n\nE. HCF-1 functions by binding directly to the mRNA of VEP-X, altering its secondary structure to ensure the signal peptide is translated in a manner that is immediately accessible to the ER import machinery.", "solution": "We begin with the core principles of cotranslational ER targeting. A classical ER signal peptide at the nascent chain N-terminus is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) during translation in the cytosol. SRP pauses elongation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the ER membrane via the SRP receptor, engaging the Sec61 translocon. Upon insertion, a lumenal signal peptidase cleaves the signal peptide, and proteins that have reached the microsomal lumen are protected from externally added protease.\n\nObservation 1 shows that in a standard cell-free system (rabbit reticulocyte lysate plus canine pancreatic microsomes), VEP-X fails to translocate and is fully degraded by added protease. Because these systems contain SRP, SRP receptor, and Sec61 competent for many substrates, the failure of VEP-X to translocate implies that, in this context, the VEP-X signal peptide is not being recognized or is not accessible to SRP in the full-length protein. The complete protease sensitivity indicates the polypeptide remains cytosolic or peripherally associated, not delivered into the microsomal lumen.\n\nObservation 2 shows that adding purified HCF-1 to the same in vitro system restores successful translocation of VEP-X, evidenced by protease protection and the characteristic slight reduction in apparent molecular weight consistent with signal peptide cleavage. Because this rescue occurs upon addition of purified HCF-1 to a cell-free translation/translocation reaction, it strongly supports a direct role for HCF-1 in enabling the ER targeting/translocation of VEP-X rather than an indirect role via gene expression.\n\nObservation 3 shows that the VEP-X N-terminal signal peptide, when fused directly to GFP, targets GFP to the ER in cells that naturally contain HCF-1. This demonstrates that the VEP-X signal peptide is intrinsically functional as a targeting signal in vivo. Therefore, the failure in Observation 1 is not due to an inherently nonfunctional signal peptide, but rather due to its context or accessibility within the full-length VEP-X protein.\n\nObservation 4 shows that full-length VEP-X fused to GFP localizes to the ER in normal cells but fails to do so when HCF-1 is depleted by RNAi, producing diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence. This indicates that HCF-1 is required in vivo for proper ER targeting of full-length VEP-X.\n\nIntegrating these findings:\n- The intrinsic functionality of the signal peptide is supported by the successful targeting of SignalPeptide-GFP in cells with HCF-1 present (Observation 3).\n- The specific requirement for HCF-1 for full-length VEP-X translocation is demonstrated both in vitro (rescue by purified HCF-1; Observation 2) and in vivo (loss of targeting upon HCF-1 depletion; Observation 4).\n- The failure of the full-length protein to translocate in the standard in vitro system lacking HCF-1 (Observation 1), despite that system’s competence for canonical SRP-mediated targeting, points to a problem of signal accessibility in the full-length context rather than a global defect of SRP or the ER machinery.\n\nThe most parsimonious model is that the VEP-X signal peptide is masked or sequestered in the native full-length conformation, preventing SRP recognition unless a specific cofactor exposes it. HCF-1 serves as that cofactor, binding to VEP-X and inducing or stabilizing a conformational change that renders the N-terminal signal peptide accessible to SRP, thereby enabling standard cotranslational targeting, translocation through Sec61, and signal peptide cleavage within the ER. This model explains all four observations.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A precisely states that the signal peptide is intrinsically functional but sequestered in the full-length protein and that HCF-1 exposure of the signal peptide permits SRP-mediated targeting. This accounts for Observations 1–4.\n- Option B claims universality of HCF-1 for all ER-targeted proteins, which is not supported and contradicts the established sufficiency of SRP/translocon systems for many substrates without such a factor.\n- Option C claims a signal peptide-independent pathway, contradicted by the successful targeting of SignalPeptide-GFP (Observation 3) and the signal peptide cleavage shift in vitro (Observation 2).\n- Option D posits HCF-1 as a transcription factor indirectly affecting ER import. The cell-free rescue by purified HCF-1 (Observation 2) argues against this.\n- Option E proposes mRNA binding and translation modulation. There is no evidence for mRNA-dependent action; the data are fully explained by protein-level conformational exposure, and the signal peptide is already at the N-terminus, which is normally accessible during translation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive model is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1515340"}]}
