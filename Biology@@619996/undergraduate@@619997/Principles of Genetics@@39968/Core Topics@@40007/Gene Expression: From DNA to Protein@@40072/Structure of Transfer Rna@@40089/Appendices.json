However, the pairing between the third position of the codon (at the 3' end) and the first position of the anticodon (at the 5' end) is less strict, a phenomenon known as \"wobble.\"\n\nA special modified base, inosine (I), is sometimes found at the first position of the tRNA anticodon.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1523872] explores what happens when the first checkpoint fails, presenting a hypothetical scenario where a synthetase incorrectly charges a tRNA. By tracing the fate of this mischarged tRNA, you will critically examine where the ultimate responsibility for accuracy lies in the protein synthesis machinery.", "problem": "In the intricate process of protein synthesis, the fidelity of translation is paramount. This accuracy relies on the precise function of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell where a mutation has occurred in the gene encoding alanyl-tRNA synthetase, the enzyme that normally charges tRNA molecules for alanine (Ala). This defective enzyme now mistakenly attaches the amino acid serine (Ser) to every tRNA molecule that has the anticodon for alanine (tRNA-Ala). All other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the cell function correctly.\n\nThis cell begins to translate a short messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule with the following sequence:\n`5'-AUG-GCA-UGG-UCU-UAA-3'`\n\nGiven the standard genetic code assignments below, determine the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide that will be produced.\n\n- `AUG`: Methionine (Met) / Start\n- `GCA`: Alanine (Ala)\n- `UGG`: Tryptophan (Trp)\n- `UCU`: Serine (Ser)\n- `UAA`: Stop\n\nWhich of the following represents the final polypeptide chain?\n\nA.

Met-Ala-Trp-Ala", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the sequence of a polypeptide synthesized under a specific error-prone condition. The core of the problem lies in understanding the respective roles of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and the ribosome in maintaining translational fidelity.\n\nStep 1: Understand the roles in standard translation.\nProtein synthesis involves the ribosome moving along an mRNA template, reading codons three bases at a time. For each codon, a specific tRNA molecule with a complementary anticodon is recruited. This tRNA carries an amino acid, which is then added to the growing polypeptide chain. The enzyme responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to the correct tRNA is the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The accuracy of this \"charging\" step is critical.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the specific defect.\nThe problem states that the alanyl-tRNA synthetase is defective. Instead of attaching alanine (Ala) to tRNA molecules meant for alanine (tRNA-Ala), it attaches serine (Ser). This means that every tRNA-Ala in the cell is actually an aminoacyl-tRNA of the form Ser-tRNA-Ala. All other synthetases, including the seryl-tRNA synthetase that charges tRNA for serine (tRNA-Ser), are functioning normally.\n\nStep 3: Consider the ribosome's function.\nA crucial principle of translation is that the ribosome itself does not \"proofread\" the amino acid attached to the tRNA. The ribosome's role is to ensure correct base pairing between the mRNA codon and the tRNA's anticodon. If the codon-anticodon match is correct, the ribosome will accept the tRNA and incorporate its attached amino acid into the polypeptide, regardless of whether that amino acid is the \"correct\" one.\n\nStep 4: Trace the translation of the given mRNA sequence `5'-AUG-GCA-UGG-UCU-UAA-3'`.\n\n- **Codon 1: `AUG`**\n  This is the start codon, which codes for Methionine (Met). The methionyl-tRNA synthetase is normal, so a correctly charged Met-tRNA-Met binds. The first amino acid is Methionine.\n  Polypeptide so far: `Met`\n\n- **Codon 2: `GCA`**\n  This codon normally codes for Alanine (Ala). The ribosome looks for a tRNA with an anticodon complementary to `GCA`. This is tRNA-Ala. Due to the specified defect, all tRNA-Ala molecules are carrying Serine. The ribosome recognizes the correct anticodon of tRNA-Ala and accepts it. Consequently, the Serine attached to this tRNA is incorporated into the chain.\n  Polypeptide so far: `Met-Ser`\n\n- **Codon 3: `UGG`**\n  This codon codes for Tryptophan (Trp). The tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is normal, so a correctly charged Trp-tRNA-Trp binds. Tryptophan is added to the chain.\n  Polypeptide so far: `Met-Ser-Trp`\n\n- **Codon 4: `UCU`**\n  This codon codes for Serine (Ser). The ribosome looks for a tRNA with an anticodon for Serine, which is tRNA-Ser. The seryl-tRNA synthetase functions normally, so tRNA-Ser is correctly charged with Serine. Serine is added to the chain.\n  Polypeptide so far: `Met-Ser-Trp-Ser`\n\n- **Codon 5: `UAA`**\n  This is a stop codon. It does not code for an amino acid. Instead, a protein called a release factor binds to the ribosome, causing the termination of translation and the release of the completed polypeptide chain.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the final sequence.\nThe final polypeptide sequence produced is Met-Ser-Trp-Ser. This corresponds to option A. The other options represent common misconceptions:\n- Option B (Met-Ala-Trp-Ser) is the sequence that would be produced without the defect.\n- Option C (Met-Ser-Trp-Ala) incorrectly assumes that if tRNA-Ala is mischarged with Ser, then tRNA-Ser must be mischarged with Ala.\n- Option D (Met) incorrectly assumes that the ribosome detects the mismatched amino acid and stalls translation.\n- Option E (Met-Ala-Trp-Ala) misinterprets the error, likely by swapping the outcome for the UCU codon instead of the GCA codon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1523872"}, {"introduction": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are not only responsible for charging tRNAs but also for correcting their own mistakes, a crucial feature for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code. This problem [@problem_id:1523884] focuses on the enzyme's internal proofreading mechanism by examining the consequences of a defective editing domain in Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. This practice will deepen your understanding of how these remarkable enzymes achieve their high degree of accuracy by discriminating between structurally similar amino acids.", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is critically dependent on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). These enzymes perform a two-step function: first, they catalyze the attachment of a specific amino acid to its corresponding set of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (a process called tRNA charging), and second, many possess a proofreading mechanism to correct errors.\n\nA researcher is studying a mutant strain of bacteria that has a specific genetic defect in the gene encoding Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS). This enzyme is responsible for charging tRNA molecules that have an anticodon corresponding to Isoleucine (abbreviated tRNA^Ile) with the amino acid Isoleucine (Ile). The mutation completely inactivates the hydrolytic editing domain of the IleRS enzyme but leaves the primary amino acid activation and tRNA-binding/charging domains functionally intact.\n\nThe amino acid Valine (Val) is structurally very similar to Isoleucine, differing only by a single methyl group, and can occasionally be activated and mistakenly attached to tRNA^Ile by the synthetic active site of a normal IleRS enzyme.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, what is the most likely and immediate consequence on the process of translation in these bacteria?\n\nA. tRNA^Ile molecules will frequently be charged with Valine instead of Isoleucine, and this incorrect Valine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where Isoleucine is coded.\n\nB. The IleRS enzyme will be completely unable to bind to or charge any tRNA^Ile molecules, halting the synthesis of all proteins containing Isoleucine.\n\nC. The ribosome will recognize the mischarged Val-tRNA^Ile complex and reject it during the elongation phase of translation, thus preserving protein accuracy at the cost of translation speed.\n\nD. The cell will rapidly upregulate the expression of a different synthetase to compensate for the defective IleRS, leading to no significant change in the final protein sequences.\n\nE. The synthetic active site of the mutated IleRS will lose its specificity, causing tRNA^Ile molecules to be charged with a wide variety of random amino acids from the cytoplasm.", "solution": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases achieve fidelity by a two-tier mechanism: a synthetic (activation) site that selects the correct amino acid and an editing (hydrolytic) site that removes near-cognate amino acids that pass the first sieve. For IleRS, the synthetic site preferentially activates Isoleucine, but due to the close structural similarity of Valine and Isoleucine, Valine can occasionally be misactivated and even transferred to tRNA^{Ile}. The hydrolytic editing domain performs pre-transfer and post-transfer editing to hydrolyze Val-AMP and Val-tRNA^{Ile}, respectively, thereby preventing misincorporation.\n\nIn the described mutant, the hydrolytic editing domain is completely inactivated while the activation and tRNA charging functions remain intact. Therefore, the baseline rate of Valine misactivation by the synthetic site persists, but the essential corrective pathway is lost. As a result, Val-tRNA^{Ile} accumulates.\n\nDuring translation, the ribosome monitors codon-anticodon base pairing in the decoding center and does not directly verify the identity of the attached amino acid. Elongation factor and ribosomal checkpoints are largely blind to the amino acid moiety itself; thus, a correctly paired anticodon on tRNA^{Ile} will be accepted at Ile codons regardless of whether the attached amino acid is Isoleucine or Valine. Consequently, Valine attached to tRNA^{Ile} will be delivered to the A site at Ile codons and incorporated into the growing polypeptide in place of Isoleucine.\n\nTherefore, the immediate and most likely consequence is increased mistranslation specifically at Ile codons by incorporation of Valine due to loss of IleRS editing, consistent with option A. Options B and E contradict the stated retention of activation and charging specificity; option C is incorrect because the ribosome does not proofread the amino acid; option D is incorrect because there is no alternative synthetase that can compensate for IleRS specificity in a way that preserves accurate Ile incorporation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1523884"}]}
