This strain has a targeted deletion of the final 9 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the gene that codes for the 16S ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA).

Identify the molecular alteration: the mutation removes the final 9 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the 16S rRNA in the 30S small ribosomal subunit. This region of 16S rRNA normally contains the anti–Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence.\n2. State the relevant principle of prokaryotic translation initiation: in bacteria, the ASD sequence at the 3' end of 16S rRNA base-pairs with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence on the mRNA, aligning the start codon in the P site of the 30S subunit and enabling proper formation of the 30S initiation complex with initiator fMet-tRNA and initiation factors.\n3. Infer the functional consequence of the deletion: deleting the terminal 9 nucleotides at the 3' end removes or severely disrupts the ASD, abolishing or greatly weakening SD–ASD base pairing. This directly impairs start-site selection and 30S initiation complex formation, leading to a dramatic reduction in initiation efficiency.\n4. Exclude other stages by mechanism: elongation primarily depends on the decoding center within 16S rRNA (internal helices such as h44) and 50S peptidyl-transferase activity, not on the extreme 3' tail; termination depends on release factors and functions at the A site; tRNA charging is catalyzed by aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases and is independent of ribosomal rRNA. Given all other components are normal and the 30S subunit assembles, the most direct and severe defect is in initiation.\n5.

Its specificity arises from its ability to bind to a distinct pocket within the 30S ribosomal subunit, primarily involving specific nucleotides of the 16S ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA). The eukaryotic 80S ribosome is naturally resistant to streptomycin because the homologous site on its 18S rRNA (within the 40S subunit) possesses key structural differences that preclude effective binding.\n\nImagine you are a molecular engineer tasked with modifying a eukaryotic ribosome to make it susceptible to streptomycin. Your goal is to identify the minimal set of nucleotide substitutions required to transform the eukaryotic 18S rRNA decoding center into a functional streptomycin-binding pocket.\n\nBased on high-resolution structural data, the core streptomycin-binding site in the prokaryotic (*E. coli*) 16S rRNA is primarily defined by three elements in helix h44:\n1.
