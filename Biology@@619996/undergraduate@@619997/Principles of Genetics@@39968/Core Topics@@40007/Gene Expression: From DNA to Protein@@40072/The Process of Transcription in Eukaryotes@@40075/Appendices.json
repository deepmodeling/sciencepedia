Mastering this calculation is the first step toward understanding how genetic information is prepared for translation.", "problem": "In a laboratory study of gene expression in a eukaryotic cell, a specific gene is found to be composed of three exons and two introns, arranged sequentially. The gene is transcribed into a primary transcript, or pre-mRNA. The lengths of these segments are as follows:\n- Exon 1: 127 nucleotides\n- Intron 1: 258 nucleotides\n- Exon 2: 310 nucleotides\n- Intron 2: 195 nucleotides\n- Exon 3: 242 nucleotides\n\nThis pre-mRNA molecule undergoes standard post-transcriptional processing to become a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, which is then exported to the cytoplasm for translation. The processing includes the addition of a 5' cap, which consists of a single modified guanine nucleotide, and the addition of a 3' poly-A tail, which consists of 210 adenine nucleotides.\n\nWhat is the total length, in nucleotides, of the final, mature mRNA molecule?\n\nA. 679\n\nB. 890\n\nC. 1122\n\nD. 1333\n\nE. 453", "solution": "In eukaryotic mRNA processing, introns are removed by splicing, leaving only exons in the coding transcript. Additionally, a single modified guanine nucleotide is added as a 5' cap, and a poly-adenine tail of specified length is added at the 3' end.

This drug is found to specifically target the activity of RNA polymerase II. Subsequent analysis reveals that RNA polymerase II can still assemble with general transcription factors at gene promoters and begin synthesizing RNA. However, the polymerase complex consistently stalls and dissociates from the DNA template after transcribing only about 25 to 30 nucleotides.

RNA Processing", "solution": "The process of eukaryotic transcription by RNA polymerase II is divided into distinct phases:\n\n1) Initiation: General transcription factors and RNA polymerase II assemble at the promoter to form the pre-initiation complex, the DNA at the transcription start site is melted, and the polymerase synthesizes the first few nucleotides. Successful initiation includes assembly at the promoter and synthesis of short nascent RNA.\n\n2) Promoter clearance and transition to productive elongation: After synthesis of approximately 20 to 30 nucleotides, RNA polymerase II clears the promoter region. This transition requires factors that relieve promoter-proximal pausing and convert the polymerase into a processive elongation complex.\n\n3) Elongation: RNA polymerase II moves along the template, synthesizing the full-length pre-mRNA, coordinated with RNA processing events such as capping, splicing, and polyadenylation.\n\n4) Termination: Transcription ends downstream of the polyadenylation site through mechanisms that disengage RNA polymerase II from the DNA template.\n\nGiven the evidence: RNA polymerase II assembles with general transcription factors at promoters and begins RNA synthesis, but repeatedly stalls and dissociates after producing only about 25 to 30 nucleotides, and no full-length pre-mRNA is produced. This pattern indicates that initiation occurs successfully (assembly and start of RNA synthesis are intact), but the polymerase fails at or just after promoter clearance, a hallmark of defective transition into productive elongation and promoter-proximal pausing control. Termination is not relevant because it occurs at the end of genes, and RNA processing is downstream and would not by itself prevent synthesis past 25 to 30 nucleotides if transcriptional elongation were intact.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental phase most directly inhibited is elongation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1528121"}, {"introduction": "Modern genetics reveals that transcription is not a simple, constant process but often occurs in stochastic bursts. This advanced practice invites you to step into the role of a molecular biologist analyzing single-cell data to understand gene regulation. Using a quantitative model of transcriptional bursting, you will interpret hypothetical experimental results to determine how a mutation in an enhancer affects gene expression, distinguishing between changes in burst frequency ($k_{on}$) and burst size ($b$) [@problem_id:1528149]. This exercise bridges theoretical models with the analysis of cutting-edge experimental data.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the function of a distal enhancer for a gene named *Gene-Z*. It is hypothesized that this enhancer primarily influences the frequency at which the *Gene-Z* promoter is activated. To test this, the biologist utilizes a diploid human cell line where one allele of *Gene-Z* has the wild-type enhancer (WT), and the other allele carries a specific mutation in the enhancer sequence (MUT).\n\nThe process of transcription for *Gene-Z* can be modeled using a two-state model, where the gene's promoter stochastically switches between an active 'ON' state and an inactive 'OFF' state. The rate of switching from 'OFF' to 'ON' is $k_{on}$, and the rate of switching from 'ON' to 'OFF' is $k_{off}$. While in the 'ON' state, messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts are initiated at a rate of $k_{init}$.\n\nFor many genes regulated by distal enhancers, the promoter activation is a rare event, meaning the promoter spends most of its time in the 'OFF' state. This corresponds to the kinetic condition $k_{on} \\ll k_{off}$. In this regime, transcription occurs in stochastic bursts. The theoretical model provides the following relationships for the mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$) of the mRNA copy number distribution measured across a cell population:\n1.  Mean: $\\mu = k_{on} \\cdot b \\cdot \\tau_{mRNA}$\n2.  Variance: $\\sigma^{2} = \\mu(1+b)$\n\nHere, $b = k_{init}/k_{off}$ is defined as the average transcriptional burst size (the mean number of transcripts produced during a single 'ON' event), and $\\tau_{mRNA}$ is the average lifetime of a *Gene-Z* mRNA molecule.\n\nThe biologist performs an experiment using single-molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH), a technique that allows for the precise counting of individual mRNA molecules from each allele within single cells. After analyzing thousands of cells, the following statistics were obtained for the steady-state mRNA distributions:\n\n-   **Wild-Type (WT) Allele**:\n    -   Mean mRNA count, $\\mu_{WT} = 8.4$ transcripts/cell\n    -   Variance of mRNA count, $\\sigma^{2}_{WT} = 79.8$ (transcripts/cell)$^2$\n-   **Mutant (MUT) Allele**:\n    -   Mean mRNA count, $\\mu_{MUT} = 2.1$ transcripts/cell\n    -   Variance of mRNA count, $\\sigma^{2}_{MUT} = 19.95$ (transcripts/cell)$^2$\n\nThe central hypothesis is that the enhancer mutation exclusively affects the promoter activation rate ($k_{on}$) and does not alter the burst size ($b$) or the mRNA lifetime ($\\tau_{mRNA}$).\n\nBased on the provided data and the transcriptional bursting model, calculate the ratio of the wild-type promoter activation rate to the mutant promoter activation rate, $k_{on,WT} / k_{on,MUT}$. Report your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The two-state transcriptional bursting model in the rare-activation regime provides the relationships\n$$\\mu = k_{on}\\,b\\,\\tau_{mRNA}, \\quad \\sigma^{2} = \\mu(1+b),$$\nwhere $b = k_{init}/k_{off}$ is the burst size and $\\tau_{mRNA}$ is the mRNA lifetime. The hypothesis states that the enhancer mutation affects only $k_{on}$ and leaves $b$ and $\\tau_{mRNA}$ unchanged between alleles.\n\nFirst, use the variance relation to infer the burst size from each allele:\n$$b = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\mu} - 1.$$\n\nFor the WT allele:\n$$b_{WT} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{WT}}{\\mu_{WT}} - 1 = \\frac{79.8}{8.4} - 1 = 9.5 - 1 = 8.5.$$\n\nFor the MUT allele:\n$$b_{MUT} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{MUT}}{\\mu_{MUT}} - 1 = \\frac{19.95}{2.1} - 1 = 9.5 - 1 = 8.5.$$\n\nThus $b_{WT} = b_{MUT}$, consistent with the hypothesis that $b$ is unchanged.
