Continuing past the deletion, the template bases after the initial TAC are now CGA ATG CT..., which transcribe to mRNA bases GCU UAC GA..., so the mutated mRNA from the start reads: 5'-AUG GCU UAC GA...-3'.\n- Grouping into codons from the AUG start: AUG | GCU | UAC | GA..., which differs from the original AUG | GGC | UUA | CGA....\n- This is a frameshift beginning at the second codon: every downstream codon is altered, and a premature stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is likely to appear shortly thereafter, producing a truncated, misfolded, and almost certainly non-functional enzyme. Because this frameshift occurs near the start, the truncation will be early and severe.\n\nAnalyze Mutation 2 (deletion of the entire second template codon CCG):\n- Removing the template 3'-CCG-5' yields the template: 3'-TAC AAT GCT...-5'.\n- The corresponding mRNA is 5'-AUG UUA CGA...-3'.\n- Translation from the start gives AUG (Met), UUA (Leu), CGA (Arg), ...; the reading frame is preserved, and the only change is the loss of the glycine residue encoded by the deleted codon. The remainder of the protein sequence is unchanged.\n- An in-frame single-amino-acid deletion can affect function if the residue is critical, but in general it is far less disruptive than an early frameshift that scrambles the sequence and causes early termination.\n\nComparison and conclusion:\n- Mutation 1 causes a frameshift near the start, altering all downstream amino acids and likely introducing an early stop codon, producing a severely truncated, non-functional enzyme.\n- Mutation 2 removes one amino acid but preserves the reading frame; the rest of the protein sequence is maintained, so the functional impact is typically less severe than a frameshift.\n- Therefore, the most accurate statement is that Mutation 1 is likely to have a more severe effect than Mutation 2 for the reasons above.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342150"}, {"introduction": "A key property of the genetic code is its degeneracy, a form of redundancy where multiple codons can specify the same amino acid.
