[@problem_id:1467433]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the 5' end of a newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcript undergoes a crucial modification process known as 5' capping. This process is essential for mRNA stability, efficient splicing, nuclear export, and initiation of translation. The capping process is a coordinated series of three enzymatic reactions that occur co-transcriptionally.\n\n1.  **Phosphatase activity**: An RNA triphosphatase enzyme removes the terminal (gamma) phosphate from the 5' triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA.\n2.  **Transferase activity**: A guanylyltransferase enzyme catalyzes the addition of a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) moiety, derived from a Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) molecule, to the 5' diphosphate end of the transcript. This forms an unusual 5'-to-5' triphosphate linkage.\n3.  **Methylase activity**: A methyltransferase enzyme adds a methyl group to the nitrogen at position 7 of the newly added guanine base, forming the final 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap structure.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment involving a mutant strain of yeast. This strain possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene that encodes the RNA triphosphatase enzyme, rendering it completely inactive. However, the guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase enzymes are present and fully functional. Assume that transcription by RNA Polymerase II initiates normally in this strain, producing a pre-mRNA with a triphosphate group at its 5' end.\n\nWhich one of the following options best represents the chemical structure that would be found at the 5' end of the majority of pre-mRNA transcripts after they are synthesized and subjected to the available capping machinery in these mutant cells?\n\nFor the options below, let $N$ represent the first nucleotide of the transcript, $G$ represent the added guanosine, $m^7G$ represent the 7-methylguanosine, $p$ represent a phosphate group, $pp$ a diphosphate, etc. The notation `(5')ppp(5')` signifies a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage.\n\nA. $m^7G(5')ppp(5')N$\n\nB. $pppN$\n\nC. $ppN$\n\nD. $m^7G(5')pppp(5')N$\n\nE. $G(5')ppp(5')N$", "solution": "The normal 5' capping pathway on a nascent pre-mRNA synthesized by RNA Polymerase II proceeds via three co-transcriptional enzymatic steps:\n\n1) RNA triphosphatase removes the terminal gamma phosphate from the 5' end of the transcript. If the nascent RNA begins with a 5' triphosphate (denoted pppN, where N is the first nucleotide), this step converts $pppN \\to ppN$.\n\n2) Guanylyltransferase adds GMP from GTP to the 5' diphosphate end of the RNA through a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. Mechanistically, the enzyme first forms a covalent enzyme–GMP intermediate from GTP with release of pyrophosphate, then transfers GMP to the RNA 5' diphosphate. This step requires a 5' diphosphate end as the acceptor and converts $ppN \\to G(5')ppp(5')N$.\n\n3) Methyltransferase methylates the added guanine at the N7 position, converting $G(5')ppp(5')N \\to m^7G(5')ppp(5')N$.\n\nIn the mutant strain described, the RNA triphosphatase is completely inactive, while guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase are fully functional. Therefore:\n\n- The initial 5' end produced by RNA Polymerase II is $pppN$.\n- Without triphosphatase activity, the conversion $pppN \\to ppN$ cannot occur. Thus, the RNA 5' end remains triphosphorylated and never becomes the required 5' diphosphate acceptor for guanylyltransferase.\n- Guanylyltransferase cannot add GMP to a 5' triphosphate end; its substrate requirement is a 5' diphosphate RNA. Therefore, no cap structure is formed.\n- Methyltransferase requires the guanosine cap substrate for N7 methylation; in the absence of a transferred G cap, it has no substrate and cannot act.\n\nBy elimination of the options:\n\n- A ($m^7G(5')ppp(5')N$) requires successful guanylyltransferase addition and subsequent methylation, which cannot occur because the 5' end is not converted to a diphosphate.\n- B ($pppN$) corresponds to the unchanged 5' triphosphate on the nascent transcript and matches the biochemical block.\n- C ($ppN$) would be the product of triphosphatase alone; this enzyme is inactive here.\n- D ($m^7G(5')pppp(5')N$) is not produced in canonical capping and also requires an initial transfer reaction that cannot proceed.\n- E ($G(5')ppp(5')N$) is the unmethylated cap; it still requires guanylyltransferase action on a 5' diphosphate, which is unavailable.\n\nTherefore, the majority of pre-mRNA 5' ends remain as the original triphosphate, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1467433"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the sequence of events, a true grasp of a biochemical pathway comes from being able to trace the fate of individual atoms through each reaction.

Yes, because the alpha phosphate from the capping GTP is retained and forms part of the 5'-5' triphosphate bridge.\n\nB. No, because the capping enzyme, guanylyltransferase, cleaves off the alpha phosphate from GTP before attaching the guanosine to the pre-mRNA.\n\nC.

In eukaryotes, initiation begins when the cap-binding protein eIF4E recognizes and binds the 5' cap structure of mature mRNA, which is a 7-methylguanosine linked by a triphosphate bridge to the first nucleotide (commonly denoted as $m^7GpppN$). eIF4E is a subunit of the eIF4F complex (with eIF4G and eIF4A). eIF4G also binds PABP at the 3' poly(A) tail to promote mRNA circularization, and eIF3 links the eIF4F-bound mRNA to the 43S preinitiation complex.

The immediate biochemical consequence depends on competitive interactions at the cap-binding step. eIF4E specifically recognizes the methylated guanine moiety of the cap. A free cap analog such as 7-mGMP can occupy the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E and thereby competitively inhibit eIF4E binding to the authentic 5' cap on mRNAs. At sufficiently high concentration, the analog sequesters eIF4E away from capped mRNAs, preventing the formation of the eIF4F complex on the mRNA and blocking recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex. This disrupts initiation at the earliest cap recognition step.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A states that eIF4E will bind the free 7-mGMP, preventing its association with the 5' end of mature mRNAs. This precisely describes the immediate competitive sequestration of eIF4E by the cap analog, blocking cap-dependent initiation.\n- Option B suggests direct blockade of the eIF4G–PABP interaction by 7-mGMP; this is a protein–protein interaction not directly targeted by a cap analog.\n- Option C suggests binding of 7-mGMP to the 3' poly(A) tail; this is incorrect both in specificity and mechanism.\n- Option D describes failure of subunit joining at the start codon, which is a downstream step; the immediate effect occurs earlier at cap recognition.\n- Option E posits inhibition of RNA Polymerase II, which is irrelevant in a translation-only cell-free system supplied with mature mRNAs and not the direct target of 7-mGMP.\n\nTherefore, the immediate molecular event is the sequestration of eIF4E by the cap analog, preventing eIF4E from binding the mRNA 5' cap, as in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1467472"}]}
