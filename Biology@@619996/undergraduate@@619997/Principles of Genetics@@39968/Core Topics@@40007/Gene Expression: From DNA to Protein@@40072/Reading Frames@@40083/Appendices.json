Your task is to determine the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide that will be produced.\n\nUse the provided subset of the genetic code to perform the translation:\n- `ACU`: Threonine (Thr)\n- `AGA`: Arginine (Arg)\n- `AUG`: Methionine (Met)\n- `CGC`: Arginine (Arg)\n- `GAC`: Aspartic acid (Asp)\n- `GCA`: Alanine (Ala)\n- `GUA`: Valine (Val)\n- `UGG`: Tryptophan (Trp)\n- `UAA`: STOP\n- `UAC`: Tyrosine (Tyr)\n- `UUA`: Leucine (Leu)\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide?

The stop codon does not code for an amino acid.\n\nGiven mRNA: 5'-AUGACUUACGCAUGGUAA-3'. Initiation is at the very first nucleotide, so the reading frame is fixed starting at the first base.\n\nPartition into codons from the start:\nAUG | ACU | UAC | GCA | UGG | UAA.\n\nTranslate each codon using the provided code:\n- AUG → Methionine (Met).\n- ACU → Threonine (Thr).\n- UAC → Tyrosine (Tyr).\n- GCA → Alanine (Ala).\n- UGG → Tryptophan (Trp).\n- UAA → STOP (termination; no amino acid added).\n\nTherefore, the polypeptide produced, from N-terminus to C-terminus, is Met-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Trp, and translation stops at UAA. This corresponds to option A.\n\nChecks against other options:\n- B reflects a different reading frame and is not applicable because initiation is fixed at the first nucleotide.\n- C omits the initial Met, which must be included since AUG is the start codon.\n- D truncates before encountering the stop codon, which is incorrect.\n- E includes Glu, which is not encoded by any codon in the given frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1516650"}, {"introduction": "Having established the rules of translation, we now explore the consequences of breaking them.
