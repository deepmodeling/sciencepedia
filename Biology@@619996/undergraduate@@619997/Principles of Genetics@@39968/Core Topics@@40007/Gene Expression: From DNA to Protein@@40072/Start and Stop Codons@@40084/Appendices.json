This final exercise [@problem_id:1523154] explores a fascinating and biologically important exception to the standard rules known as \"leaky scanning,\" a common phenomenon in eukaryotes. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation, you will discover how ribosomes can sometimes initiate translation at imperfect start codons, a mechanism that can lead to the production of multiple protein variants from a single messenger RNA and adds a rich layer of regulatory control.", "problem": "In a eukaryotic cell line, a researcher is studying a gene called `Gene-Z`. The messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the wild-type allele of `Gene-Z` begins with the canonical start codon, AUG. A mutation is identified where a single nucleotide substitution changes this start codon from AUG to ACG. Experimental analysis of the protein products from cells expressing only the mutant allele reveals two distinct, stable protein species. The first species is a full-length protein, identical in size to the wild-type protein, but it is produced at a very low level. The second species is a shorter, N-terminally truncated protein, which is produced in greater abundance than the mutant full-length protein. It is confirmed that the `Gene-Z` mRNA contains another in-frame AUG codon downstream of the original start site. Which of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular explanation for the production of these two protein variants from the single mutant mRNA?\n\nA. The ACG codon is now efficiently recognized as the sole start codon, but it triggers a ribosomal frameshift, which results in a premature stop codon and the production of the shorter protein. The full-length protein is a result of rare frameshift correction.\n\nB. The mutation created a premature stop codon, leading to the truncated protein. The small amount of full-length protein is synthesized when a suppressor transfer RNA (tRNA) allows the ribosome to read through this stop codon.\n\nC. The ribosome completely fails to recognize the mutated ACG codon. It initiates translation exclusively at the downstream AUG codon, creating the shorter protein. The observed full-length protein is an unrelated protein that cross-reacts with the detection antibody.\n\nD. The ribosome's scanning mechanism allows for two primary outcomes: some ribosomes initiate translation inefficiently at the mutated ACG codon (a 'near-cognate' start codon), producing a small amount of full-length protein. Other ribosomes bypass this weak start site and initiate at the next, stronger, in-frame AUG codon, producing the more abundant, shorter protein.\n\nE. The ACG mutation signals for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mRNA. The shorter protein is a result of truncated translation on the few mRNAs that escape NMD, and the full-length protein is from a different gene.", "solution": "1) State the core mechanistic framework: In eukaryotes, translation initiation follows the scanning model. The 40S ribosomal subunit binds the capped 5' end and scans in the 5' to 3' direction for a start codon, preferentially an AUG in a favorable Kozak context. However, near-cognate non-AUG codons that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide (e.g., ACG, CUG, GUG, UUG, AUA, AUC, AUU) can be used as weak start codons with low efficiency.\n\n2) Apply to the mutation: The wild-type start codon AUG was mutated to ACG. ACG is a near-cognate start codon that can occasionally be recognized by the initiation machinery using initiator Met-tRNA, yielding initiation at the original site but at low efficiency. This explains the presence of a small amount of full-length protein. Because initiator Met-tRNA is used at initiation, initiation at a near-cognate start codon produces a protein of the same length as the wild type; the N-terminus is typically still methionine (and may be post-translationally processed), so the observed size matches the wild-type protein.\n\n3) Explain the more abundant truncated species: Because ACG is a weak start site, many scanning ribosomes bypass it (leaky scanning) and continue to the next downstream AUG. If that downstream AUG is in-frame, initiation there produces an N-terminally truncated protein that lacks the segment encoded between the original AUG and the downstream AUG. Since AUG is a strong start codon, initiation at this site is efficient, leading to higher abundance of the truncated protein compared to the weakly initiated full-length protein.\n\n4) Exclude alternatives:\n- A is implausible because initiation-induced frameshifting is not a typical mechanism at start codons, and a consistent, in-frame downstream AUG fully explains the shorter product without invoking frameshifts.\n- B is incorrect because ACG is not a stop codon; no premature termination codon is created by AUG→ACG.\n- C is unlikely because the data specify two species produced from cells expressing only the mutant allele, and near-cognate initiation is well-established; cross-reactivity is not needed to explain the low-level full-length species.\n- E is incorrect because nonsense-mediated decay requires a premature stop codon upstream of an exon junction complex; the AUG→ACG change does not create a stop codon, and NMD is not triggered by a start codon mutation per se.\n\n5) Conclude: The scanning ribosome initiates inefficiently at the a near-cognate ACG to yield a small amount of full-length protein, and more frequently bypasses it to initiate at the downstream in-frame AUG, producing a more abundant N-terminally truncated isoform.
