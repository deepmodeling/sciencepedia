The gene is composed of two exons, Exon 1 and Exon 2, which are separated by a single intron, Intron 1. The known lengths of these regions are:\n- Exon 1: 210 base pairs (bp)\n- Intron 1: 550 bp\n- Exon 2: 340 bp\n\nTo investigate the expression and processing of `GEN-Y`, the researcher isolates total messenger RNA (mRNA) from cells and performs a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiment. A pair of DNA primers is used for this analysis. The forward primer is designed to anneal to a sequence located entirely within Exon 1, and the reverse primer is designed to anneal to a sequence located entirely within Exon 2.\n\nAs a control, the researcher also uses the same primer pair to perform a standard PCR using genomic DNA as the template. This control experiment produces a DNA fragment of 780 bp.\n\nAssuming that Intron 1 is completely and correctly removed from the pre-mRNA to form the mature mRNA in these cells, calculate the expected size of the DNA fragment that will be produced by the RT-PCR experiment. Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "The RT-PCR experiment uses mature mRNA as a template, in which the intron has been spliced out. The standard PCR uses genomic DNA, which includes the intron. Both reactions use the same primers, meaning they amplify the same exonic regions but differ by the presence or absence of the intron.\n\nThe length of the amplified fragment from the RT-PCR can be calculated by subtracting the length of the removed intron from the length of the genomic PCR product:\n$$\nL_{\\text{RT-PCR}} = L_{\\text{genomic}} - L_{\\text{intron}}\n$$\nGiven the values from the problem description:\n- $L_{\\text{genomic}} = 780 \\text{ bp}$ (from the control experiment)\n- $L_{\\text{intron}} = 550 \\text{ bp}$\n\nThe expected size of the RT-PCR product is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{RT-PCR}} = 780 \\text{ bp} - 550 \\text{ bp} = 230 \\text{ bp}\n$$\nThis result represents the combined length of the amplified segments from Exon 1 and Exon 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{230}$$", "id": "1511942"}, {"introduction": "The regulation of splicing is incredibly complex, with signals that extend beyond the simple intron-exon boundaries. This problem explores how a single nucleotide change within an exon can create a regulatory element known as an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS), leading to a common splicing defect called exon skipping. By working through this scenario [@problem_id:1511952], you will see how the cell's interpretation of what constitutes an \"exon\" can be altered, with significant consequences for the final mRNA product.", "problem": "A hypothetical human gene, designated *CELLREG1*, plays a role in cell cycle regulation. The pre-mRNA transcript of the wild-type *CELLREG1* gene consists of three exons and two introns, arranged in the following order from 5' to 3': Exon 1, Intron 1, Exon 2, Intron 2, Exon 3. In a healthy individual, the spliceosome correctly processes this pre-mRNA by removing both introns and ligating the three exons together to form the mature mRNA.\n\nResearchers have identified a patient with a rare genetic disorder linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the *CELLREG1* gene. This SNP is located within the sequence of Exon 2. This single base-pair change does not introduce a stop codon, but it creates a potent Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS). An ESS is a cis-regulatory element that, when present within an exon, recruits specific inhibitory proteins. In this case, the binding of these proteins to the newly formed ESS in Exon 2 sterically interferes with the ability of the spliceosome to recognize the canonical splice sites immediately flanking Exon 2.\n\nAssuming this interference is highly effective, which of the following statements most accurately describes the predominant structure of the mature *CELLREG1* mRNA transcript produced from this mutated allele?\n\nA. The mature mRNA will consist of Exon 1 joined directly to Exon 3.\n\nB. The mature mRNA will be identical to the wild-type mRNA, but its translation will be terminated prematurely.\n\nC. The mature mRNA will contain Exon 1, Intron 1, and Exon 2, as the silencer prevents the removal of the first intron.\n\nD. The mature mRNA will contain all three exons and both introns, as the entire splicing process is inhibited.\n\nE. The pre-mRNA will be completely degraded, and no mature mRNA will be produced.\n\nF. The mature mRNA will consist of Exon 1 and Exon 2, with Exon 3 being excluded.", "solution": "The pre-mRNA is arranged as Exon 1, Intron 1, Exon 2, Intron 2, Exon 3. In normal splicing, both introns are removed and Exons 1, 2, and 3 are ligated to form the mature mRNA. An Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS) within Exon 2 recruits inhibitory splicing factors, such as hnRNP proteins, that block spliceosome access to the canonical splice sites flanking Exon 2 (both the upstream 3' splice site at the end of Intron 1 and the downstream 5' splice site at the start of Intron 2). When this interference is highly effective, the spliceosome fails to recognize Exon 2 as an exon, resulting in exon skipping. In exon skipping, the spliceosome pairs the 5' splice site upstream of Exon 2 (at the end of Exon 1) with the 3' splice site downstream of Exon 2 (at the start of Exon 3), thereby excising Intron 1, Exon 2, and Intron 2 together as a single unit and ligating Exon 1 directly to Exon 3.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A describes exon skipping of Exon 2, which is the expected outcome of a strong ESS within Exon 2 that blocks recognition of its flanking splice sites.\n- B is incorrect because the SNP does not introduce a stop codon; the primary effect is on splicing, not on translation termination.\n- C is incorrect because the ESS does not specifically prevent removal of Intron 1; instead, it causes failure to include Exon 2, not intron retention.\n- D is incorrect because a global inhibition of all splicing does not follow from an ESS localized to Exon 2.\n- E is incorrect because pre-mRNA is not necessarily degraded; a predominant mature isoform via exon skipping is expected.\n- F is incorrect because exclusion of Exon 3 would not result from an ESS in Exon 2; the typical consequence is skipping of Exon 2.\n\nTherefore, the predominant mature mRNA consists of Exon 1 joined directly to Exon 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1511952"}, {"introduction": "What happens when splicing goes wrong and creates a message that would produce a truncated, potentially harmful protein? Eukaryotic cells have evolved a sophisticated quality control system called Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) to handle such errors. This exercise will guide you through the logic of NMD, which relies on molecular \"bookmarks\" left behind by the splicing machinery to identify and eliminate flawed transcripts [@problem_id:1511965].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, a crucial quality control mechanism known as Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) identifies and degrades messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts that contain a Premature Termination Codon (PTC). This process prevents the synthesis of potentially harmful truncated proteins. The cell distinguishes a PTC from a legitimate stop codon based on its position relative to Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs), which are protein assemblies deposited on the mRNA during splicing.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, we will model this complex biological process with a simplified but effective rule, often referred to as the \"50-nucleotide rule\". According to this rule, a termination codon is recognized as premature and the corresponding mRNA is targeted for degradation if, and only if, the codon is located more than 50 nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction in the coding sequence. Stop codons found within 50 nucleotides of the final exon-exon junction, or located anywhere in the terminal exon, are considered legitimate and do not trigger NMD.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic gene, designated `GENE-X`, which is composed of 5 exons. The lengths of these exons are as follows:\n- Exon 1: 120 base pairs (bp)\n- Exon 2: 80 bp\n- Exon 3: 150 bp\n- Exon 4: 100 bp\n- Exon 5: 200 bp\n\nAssume that pre-mRNA processing occurs perfectly, excising all introns and ligating the exons in sequential order to form the mature mRNA. The translation initiation codon (AUG) is located at the very beginning of Exon 1, and the gene's natural termination codon resides within Exon 5.\n\nSeveral different single-nucleotide mutations have been identified in `GENE-X`, each creating a PTC at a specific location. The locations are specified by the exon number and the nucleotide position within that exon, using 1-based indexing (i.e., the first nucleotide of an exon is at position 1).\n\nWhich of the following mutational scenarios would result in the degradation of the `GENE-X` mRNA transcript via the NMD pathway?\n\nA. A PTC is created at position 75 within Exon 1.\n\nB. A PTC is created at position 50 within Exon 3.\n\nC. A PTC is created at position 90 within Exon 4.\n\nD. A PTC is created at position 110 within Exon 5.\n\nE. A PTC is created at position 20 within Exon 4.", "solution": "The problem is solved by applying the \"50-nucleotide rule\" for each mutation. A transcript is targeted for NMD if its Premature Termination Codon (PTC) is located more than 50 nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction. In this gene, the final junction is between Exon 4 and Exon 5. We calculate the distance ($d$) from the PTC to this junction for each case. The rule is: NMD is triggered if $d > 50$.\n\nGiven exon lengths $L_{1}=120$, $L_{2}=80$, $L_{3}=150$, $L_{4}=100$, and $L_{5}=200$.\n\nThe distance for a PTC at position $p$ within an exon is calculated as follows:\n- PTC in Exon 1: $d=(L_{1}-p)+L_{2}+L_{3}+L_{4}$\n- PTC in Exon 3: $d=(L_{3}-p)+L_{4}$\n- PTC in Exon 4: $d=(L_{4}-p)$\n- PTC in Exon 5 (terminal exon): NMD is never triggered.\n\nLet's evaluate each scenario:\nA.
