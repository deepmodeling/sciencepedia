The initial construct, plasmid `pWT`, produces the protein at a low level. To improve this, the biologist creates a new construct, `pOPT`, by performing \"codon optimization.\" This involves making synonymous mutations (changing the DNA sequence without altering the resulting amino acid sequence) to match the codons to those most frequently used by *E. coli*. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the target protein is Met-Gly-Val.\n\nThe 5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR) of the mRNA, which lies upstream of the protein-coding sequence, is identical for both constructs. It contains a key sequence, `5'-CACCC-3'`, located just before the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS). The protein Coding Sequence (CDS) begins immediately after the 5' UTR with the start codon `AUG`.\n\nThe specific codon changes are as follows:\n- **`pWT` construct:** Uses the codons `GGU` for Glycine and `GUU` for Valine.\n- **`pOPT` construct:** Uses the optimized codons `GGG` for Glycine and `GUG` for Valine.\n\nCounter-intuitively, the biologist observes that the `pOPT` construct produces significantly *less* protein than the `pWT` construct. The suspected cause is the unintended formation of a stable mRNA hairpin loop that sequesters the RBS, preventing translation initiation.\n\nA simplified model is proposed to assess the stability of this potential hairpin. A stem can form via an intramolecular interaction between the `5'-CACCC-3'` sequence in the 5' UTR and the corresponding five-nucleotide sequence in the CDS starting at the +4 position (where the A of the `AUG` start codon is position +1).\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of formation for the 5-base-pair stem, $\\Delta G_{stem}$, is the sum of the energies of the individual pairs:\n- Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pair: $\\Delta G_{GC} = -3.4 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Adenine-Uracil (A-U) pair: $\\Delta G_{AU} = -2.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Guanine-Uracil (G-U) wobble pair: $\\Delta G_{GU} = -1.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Mismatched pairs contribute $0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ to the stability.\n\nCalculate the change in hairpin stem stability resulting from the codon optimization, defined as $\\Delta (\\Delta G_{stem}) = \\Delta G_{stem, pOPT} - \\Delta G_{stem, pWT}$.
