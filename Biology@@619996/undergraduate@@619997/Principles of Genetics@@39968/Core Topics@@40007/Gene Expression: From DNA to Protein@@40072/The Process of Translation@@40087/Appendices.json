This exercise provides a quantitative look at this cost by breaking down translation into its four main stages: initiation, amino acid activation, elongation, and termination. By calculating the energy expended to synthesize proteins of different lengths, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the molecular accounting involved and see how the efficiency of translation relates to polypeptide size [@problem_id:1528596].", "problem": "In a hypothetical prokaryotic system, the synthesis of a protein via translation incurs energetic costs in the form of high-energy phosphate bond hydrolysis from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The total cost can be determined by summing the costs of the four main stages of translation, which are defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiation**: The assembly of the ribosomal subunits on the messenger RNA (mRNA) and the binding of the initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) costs a total of 3 high-energy phosphate bonds. This is a fixed cost incurred once per protein.\n2.  **Amino Acid Activation**: Before an amino acid can be incorporated into the protein, it must be attached to its corresponding tRNA molecule. This activation process consumes energy equivalent to 2 high-energy phosphate bonds for each amino acid.\n3.  **Elongation**: For each subsequent amino acid added to the growing polypeptide chain after the first one, a cycle of reactions occurs. This cycle consumes a total of 2 high-energy phosphate bonds for tRNA delivery and ribosome translocation.\n4.  **Termination**: The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of 1 high-energy phosphate bond.\n\nConsider two different proteins synthesized in this system: Protein A, which is 100 amino acids long, and Protein B, which is 200 amino acids long.

This problem explores the consequences of a nonsense mutation and a fascinating cellular response involving a \"suppressor tRNA\". By analyzing the competition between the termination machinery and this mutant tRNA, you will unravel how the cell can sometimes read through erroneous stop signals, providing a powerful example of genetic suppression in action [@problem_id:1528644].", "problem": "In a particular eukaryotic cell line, the gene for a structural protein called \"Stabilitin\" encodes a polypeptide that is normally 350 amino acids long. A spontaneous mutation occurs in this gene, changing the 100th codon from CAG, which codes for the amino acid glutamine, to UAG, which is a stop codon.\n\nIndependently, a second mutation arises in the same cell line. This mutation affects a gene encoding a specific transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA). The tRNA that normally carries the amino acid serine (tRNA-Ser) and has the anticodon 3'-UCG-5' is altered. The mutation changes its anticodon to 3'-AUC-5', allowing it to recognize the UAG stop codon. The cell contains a population of both the normal tRNA-Ser and this new mutant \"suppressor\" tRNA-Ser.\n\nAssuming the ribosome encounters the mutant Stabilitin messenger RNA (mRNA) in this cell, which of the following choices best describes the protein products that will be synthesized?\n\nA. Only a truncated Stabilitin protein of 99 amino acids.\n\nB. Only a full-length Stabilitin protein of 350 amino acids, with serine at position 100.\n\nC.

A mixture of a 99-amino-acid truncated protein and a full-length 350-amino-acid protein with glutamine at position 100.\n\nE. No Stabilitin protein will be produced, as the suppressor tRNA will be sequestered at the premature stop codon, halting all translation of this mRNA.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the outcome of translating a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell that contains both a premature stop codon in the mRNA and a suppressor transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial mutation in the Stabilitin gene. The normal protein is 350 amino acids long. A mutation changes codon 100 from CAG (glutamine) to UAG (a stop codon). This type of mutation is called a nonsense mutation. In a normal cell without any other mutations, when the ribosome translating the Stabilitin mRNA reaches codon 100 (UAG), it will not recruit a tRNA. Instead, a protein known as a release factor will bind to the stop codon in the A-site of the ribosome. This binding triggers the hydrolysis of the bond linking the polypeptide chain to the tRNA in the P-site, causing the release of the newly synthesized, but incomplete, polypeptide. The ribosome then dissociates from the mRNA. The resulting protein would be a truncated version of Stabilitin, containing only the first 99 amino acids.\n\nNext, we must consider the effect of the second mutation, which creates a suppressor tRNA. A gene for a tRNA that normally carries serine (tRNA-Ser) has been mutated. The crucial point about tRNA function is that the amino acid is attached to the tRNA by an enzyme called an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme recognizes the overall three-dimensional structure of its specific tRNA, not just the anticodon sequence. Therefore, despite the mutation in its anticodon, this suppressor tRNA will still be charged with the amino acid serine. The mutation changes the anticodon from 3'-UCG-5' (which pairs with the serine codon 5'-AGC-3') to 3'-AUC-5'. This new anticodon, 3'-AUC-5', is complementary to the stop codon 5'-UAG-3'.\n\nNow, we combine these two events. The ribosome begins translating the mutant Stabilitin mRNA. When it arrives at codon 100, which is UAG, the A-site is presented with a stop codon. At this point, there is a competition between two possible events:\n\n1.  **Termination:** The protein release factor can bind to the UAG codon, leading to the termination of translation and the release of a truncated 99-amino-acid polypeptide, just as it would in a cell without the suppressor tRNA.\n\n2.  **Suppression:** The mutant suppressor tRNA-Ser, which now has an anticodon (3'-AUC-5') that can pair with the UAG codon, can bind to the A-site. If it binds, the ribosome treats it like any other codon-anticodon pairing. It catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond, adding a serine to the growing polypeptide chain. Translation then continues along the mRNA until the ribosome reaches the original, true stop codon at the end of the gene (after codon 350). This process results in a full-length, 350-amino-acid Stabilitin protein. However, this protein is not identical to the wild-type; it has serine at position 100 instead of the original glutamine.\n\nSince the cell contains both the protein release factors and the suppressor tRNA, these two events (termination and suppression) will both occur, competing with each other at the UAG stop codon. The efficiency of suppression is never 100%. Consequently, the cell will not produce only one type of protein product from this mRNA. Instead, it will produce a mixture of two distinct polypeptide chains: the 99-amino-acid truncated protein resulting from termination, and the full-length 350-amino-acid protein (with serine at position 100) resulting from suppression.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the outcome is a mixture of the truncated protein and the full-length, altered protein. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect because it ignores the presence and function of the suppressor tRNA.\n- Option B is incorrect because it assumes suppression is 100% efficient, which is not the case. There is always competition from release factors.\n- Option D is incorrect because the suppressor tRNA is a modified tRNA-Ser and thus inserts serine, not the original amino acid glutamine. The translational machinery has no \"memory\" of the original genetic code at that position.\n- Option E is incorrect. While the suppressor tRNA binds to the UAG codon, it does not permanently halt translation; rather, it allows translation to continue, and it does not prevent termination from occurring in other instances.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1528644"}, {"introduction": "Modern genetics moves beyond static textbook diagrams to dynamic, genome-wide snapshots of molecular processes. This practice challenges you to interpret data from a powerful technique called ribosome profiling, which maps the precise location of ribosomes on mRNA. The data presents a puzzle where translation appears to halt abruptly mid-gene, a phenomenon that cannot be explained by the standard model. Your task is to act as a molecular detective, analyzing the evidence to deduce a sophisticated regulatory event known as programmed ribosomal frameshifting and see how scientists uncover complex biological mechanisms [@problem_id:1528605].", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the translation of a newly discovered eukaryotic gene, which they have named `Fictitin`. They employ a technique called Ribosome Profiling, which maps the exact positions of all translating ribosomes on messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts at a single-nucleotide resolution. The output of this experiment is a plot of ribosome footprint density versus nucleotide position along the mRNA. A higher density at a particular location indicates a higher probability of finding a ribosome at that site.\n\nThe coding sequence (CDS) of the `Fictitin` mRNA begins at nucleotide +1 (the first nucleotide of the start codon) and is predicted to end at a UAG stop codon starting at nucleotide +900. The experimental results reveal two key features:\n\n1.  Across most of the CDS, from the start codon to roughly position +299, the ribosome footprint density shows a distinct, robust periodic pattern with high-density peaks occurring every three nucleotides.\n2.  At nucleotide position +300, a GGG codon is located. Immediately following this codon, from nucleotide +301 onwards, the ribosome footprint density drops abruptly to nearly zero and remains at this low level for the rest of the CDS, all the way to the predicted stop codon at +900.\n\nFurther bioinformatic analysis of the `Fictitin` mRNA sequence reveals the presence of a TAA codon beginning at nucleotide position +304.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the most likely molecular event occurring at or near the GGG codon at position +300?\n\nA. The ribosome stalls permanently on the GGG codon, creating a \"traffic jam\" that prevents trailing ribosomes from proceeding.\n\nB. The GGG codon is misread as a termination signal by a eukaryotic release factor, causing premature termination.\n\nC. The mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease enzyme that specifically recognizes the sequence including the GGG codon, degrading the transcript downstream of this point.\n\nD. The ribosome experiences a +1 programmed ribosomal frameshift, causing it to read a new frame that contains a premature stop codon.\n\nE. A specialized regulatory protein binds to the GGG codon, physically dislodging the ribosome from the mRNA template.", "solution": "We reason from first principles of translation elongation and ribosome profiling.\n\n1) In canonical elongation, a translating ribosome advances by codons, three nucleotides at a time. In ribosome profiling, this produces a characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity in ribosome-protected fragments mapped along the coding sequence. Therefore, a robust, triplet-periodic footprint density from the start codon through roughly position +299 indicates that ribosomes translate in a single, stable reading frame across that region.\n\n2) An abrupt, near-complete loss of ribosome footprints starting immediately after a specific site implies that ribosomes largely do not proceed beyond that site. The most direct mechanistic causes for this are either termination of translation (leading to ribosome dissociation) or irreversible stalling followed by clearance rather than continued elongation.\n\n3) Evaluate option A (permanent stall at GGG with traffic jam): A permanent stall at the GGG codon would be expected to produce an accumulation (pileup) of footprints at and upstream of the stall site, often with increased density just 5' to the stall, because trailing ribosomes queue behind the blocked ribosome. The description highlights a robust periodic pattern up to approximately +299 and then a sharp drop to near-zero from +301 onward, without indicating a prominent pileup at the stall site. Moreover, a permanent stall with queuing would not necessarily drive the downstream density to nearly zero in a manner consistent with immediate dissociation; rather, the hallmark is elevated upstream density, which is not the salient feature described. Thus A is not the best explanation.\n\n4) Evaluate option B (misreading GGG as a stop by eukaryotic release factor): In eukaryotes, eRF1 recognizes the three stop codons UAA, UAG, and UGA. A GGG codon encodes glycine and is not recognized as a termination signal by release factors. Therefore, B is mechanistically implausible.\n\n5) Evaluate option C (endonucleolytic cleavage at a GGG-recognized site): While endonucleolytic cleavage can occur during quality control pathways such as No-Go Decay when a ribosome stalls, there is no general, sequence-specific endonuclease in eukaryotic cytosolic translation that specifically recognizes a simple GGG triplet to cleave mRNA. Furthermore, the observation of a nearby TAA codon at +304 offers a more direct and canonical explanation linked to translation itself. C is thus unlikely compared with a translation-based mechanism.\n\n6) Evaluate option E (protein dislodging the ribosome upon binding GGG): There is no established general mechanism in eukaryotic translation where a regulatory protein binds an internal sense codon such as GGG and directly dislodges ribosomes. This is speculative and lacks support relative to known mechanisms.\n\n7) Evaluate option D (+1 programmed ribosomal frameshift leading to a premature stop): Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a well-established mechanism in which the ribosome shifts reading frame, often at specific “slippery” sequences, and frequently terminates soon thereafter if the new frame contains a stop codon. The key observations strongly support this:\n- The robust three-nucleotide periodicity up to the region encompassing the GGG codon is consistent with normal elongation in the annotated frame.\n- The abrupt and persistent drop in downstream footprint density indicates that ribosomes typically do not continue elongation past this site, consistent with termination shortly after the event.\n- The presence of a TAA codon beginning at +304 in an alternative frame provides an immediate termination signal if the ribosome undergoes a +1 frameshift near the GGG codon. After shifting +1, the ribosome would encounter a stop codon almost immediately, dissociate, and thus produce negligible footprint density from +301 onward through the rest of the CDS.\n\nTaken together, the most parsimonious and mechanistically grounded explanation is a +1 programmed ribosomal frameshift at or near the GGG codon that moves the ribosome into a reading frame containing a premature stop codon at +304, causing early termination and the observed loss of ribosome footprints downstream.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1528605"}]}
