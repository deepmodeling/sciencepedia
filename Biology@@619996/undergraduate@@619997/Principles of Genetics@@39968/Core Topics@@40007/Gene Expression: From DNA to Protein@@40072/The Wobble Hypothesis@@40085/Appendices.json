This first exercise strips the concept down to its core, tasking you with applying the fundamental rules of antiparallel alignment and \"wobble\" pairing. Mastering this practice [@problem_id:1529620] will help you build a solid foundation for understanding how a limited set of tRNAs can read the entire genetic code.", "problem": "In a genetics research laboratory, a team is studying the mechanism of protein synthesis in a specific archaeon. They have isolated a transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA) that is charged with the amino acid glutamine. Through sequencing, they determine that the anticodon of this glutamine-specific tRNA is 5'-CUG-3'. The team knows that in this organism, glutamine is encoded by two possible codons on a messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcript: 5'-CAA-3' and 5'-CAG-3'.\n\nThe central principle of codon-anticodon recognition involves antiparallel alignment and base pairing. Standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules are G with C, and A with U. However, the pairing between the third base of the mRNA codon (at the 3' end) and the first base of the tRNA anticodon (at the 5' end) is less stringent and is governed by what is known as the wobble hypothesis.\n\nBased on these principles, determine which of the two glutamine codons will be recognized by the tRNA with the anticodon 5'-CUG-3', and select the option that provides the correct justification.\n\nA. The codon 5'-CAG-3' is recognized because the anticodon aligns antiparallelly, and the cytosine (C) at the 5' \"wobble\" position of the anticodon specifically pairs only with the guanine (G) at the 3' position of the codon.\n\nB. The codon 5'-CAA-3' is recognized because the guanine (G) at the 3' end of the anticodon can \"wobble\" to form a non-standard pair with the adenine (A) at the 5' end of the codon.\n\nC. Both 5'-CAA-3' and 5'-CAG-3' are recognized because the cytosine (C) at the 5' \"wobble\" position of the anticodon is capable of pairing with either adenine (A) or guanine (G).\n\nD. The codon 5'-CAG-3' is recognized because the middle base of the anticodon, uracil (U), stabilizes the wobble interaction at the third position.\n\nE. Neither codon is recognized because perfect Watson-Crick pairing is required at all three positions for a stable interaction, and the CUG anticodon does not perfectly match either codon.", "solution": "Anticodon-codon pairing is antiparallel: the tRNA anticodon written $5^{\\prime}\\to 3^{\\prime}$ pairs with the mRNA codon written $5^{\\prime}\\to 3^{\\prime}$ in opposite orientation. The given anticodon is $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CUG-}3^{\\prime}$, which in the $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ orientation is $3^{\\prime}\\text{-GUC-}5^{\\prime}$. The reverse complement that would pair under standard Watson-Crick rules is therefore $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CAG-}3^{\\prime}$, since C pairs with G and U pairs with A at the first two positions (codon positions $1$ and $2$), which generally require strict pairing.\n\nWobble applies at the third position of the codon (the $3^{\\prime}$ end of the codon) and the first position of the anticodon (the $5^{\\prime}$ end of the anticodon). The wobble pairing rules for the $5^{\\prime}$ anticodon base include: C pairs only with G; A pairs only with U; U pairs with A or G; G pairs with U or C; I pairs with U, C, or A. Here, the $5^{\\prime}$ base of the anticodon is C, so at the wobble position it can pair only with G in the codonâ€™s $3^{\\prime}$ position.\n\nAmong the two glutamine codons, $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CAG-}3^{\\prime}$ has G at the $3^{\\prime}$ position and satisfies the wobble constraint with anticodon $5^{\\prime}$-C. The codon $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CAA-}3^{\\prime}$ has A at the $3^{\\prime}$ position, which cannot pair with C at the anticodon $5^{\\prime}$ position. Therefore, only $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CAG-}3^{\\prime}$ is recognized, and the correct justification is that the $5^{\\prime}$ C of the anticodon pairs specifically with the codon $3^{\\prime}$ G under wobble rules.\n\nOption A states exactly this antiparallel alignment and wobble specificity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1529620"}, {"introduction": "Now that you've practiced the basic pairing rules, we can explore the \"why\" behind the wobble hypothesis: cellular efficiency. This problem challenges you to think like a bioengineer optimizing a cell's resources by determining the theoretical minimum number of tRNAs required to decode all codons for a single amino acid. This exercise [@problem_id:1529655] reveals how wobble pairing allows the cell to economize its translational toolkit.", "problem": "In the intricate process of protein synthesis, the genetic information encoded in messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) is translated into a sequence of amino acids. This translation is mediated by transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA) molecules, which act as adaptors. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon loop that recognizes a specific three-nucleotide codon on the mRNA and carries the corresponding amino acid.\n\nThe genetic code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. This degeneracy is partly explained by the \"wobble hypothesis,\" which allows for non-standard base pairing between the third nucleotide of the mRNA codon (at the 3' end) and the first nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon (at the 5' end).\n\nConsider the amino acid proline, which is encoded by the four codons: CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG. Assuming a hypothetical biological system utilizes the standard set of wobble pairing rules listed below, determine the theoretical minimum number of distinct tRNA species required to recognize all four proline codons.\n\nThe wobble pairing rules are as follows (5' base of anticodon pairing with 3' base of codon):\n- **G** can pair with **U** or **C**.\n- **C** can pair with **G**.\n- **A** can pair with **U**.\n- **U** can pair with **A** or **G**.\n- **I** (Inosine, a modified purine) can pair with **A**, **C**, or **U**.", "solution": "We need to recognize all four mRNA codons for proline, which are CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG. The first two positions are fixed as C and C, so by standard Watson-Crick pairing, the anticodon positions complementary to these must be G and G. Writing the anticodon 5' to 3' as $XGG$, the variable $X$ at the 5' end of the anticodon is the wobble position that pairs with the 3' base of the codon.\n\nDefine the set of third bases to be covered as $T=\\{U,C,A,G\\}$. By the given wobble rules, the coverage sets for the 5' anticodon base $X$ are:\n$$\nW(G)=\\{U,C\\}, \\quad W(U)=\\{A,G\\}, \\quad W(I)=\\{A,C,U\\}, \\quad W(C)=\\{G\\}, \\quad W(A)=\\{U\\}.\n$$\nA single tRNA species corresponds to one choice of $X$ and can cover at most $|W(X)|$ third bases. Since $\\max_{X}|W(X)|=3$ (achieved by $X=I$ with $W(I)=\\{A,C,U\\}$, which omits $G$), no single tRNA can cover $T$. Therefore, at least two distinct tRNA species are required.\n\nTwo tRNAs suffice. For example, choose $X_{1}=G$ and $X_{2}=U$:\n$$\nW(G)\\cup W(U)=\\{U,C\\}\\cup\\{A,G\\}=\\{U,C,A,G\\}=T.\n$$\nThus, the theoretical minimum number of distinct tRNA species needed to recognize all four proline codons is $2$.

Through a hypothetical scenario involving a mutation, you will see how the modified base inosine ($I$) dramatically improves translational efficiency.

This number is minimized by the \"wobble\" phenomenon, where a single tRNA anticodon can recognize multiple mRNA codons. Central to this is the modified base inosine (I), which is created by enzymatic modification of adenosine at the first position (the 5' end) of some tRNA anticodons.\n\nConsider a hypothetical bacterium whose genetic code deviates from the standard code for three specific amino acids: Proline, Threonine, and Isoleucine. In this organism, each of these amino acids is encoded by a unique set of three codons:\n- **Proline (Pro)**: CCU, CCC, CCA\n- **Threonine (Thr)**: ACU, ACC, ACA\n- **Isoleucine (Ile)**: AUU, AUC, AUA\n\nA biochemist creates a mutant strain of this bacterium that lacks the adenosine deaminase enzyme, rendering it incapable of synthesizing inosine for its tRNAs.
