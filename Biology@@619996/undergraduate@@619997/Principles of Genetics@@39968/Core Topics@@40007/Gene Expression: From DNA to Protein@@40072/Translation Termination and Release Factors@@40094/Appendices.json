In prokaryotic translation termination, a specific set of proteins, known as release factors, is required to recognize stop signals and free the newly synthesized polypeptide. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2079225] asks you to assemble the complete \"toolkit\" of release factors needed to ensure termination can occur for any possible stop codon, a crucial first step in mastering the mechanics of this pathway.", "problem": "A researcher is working with a prokaryotic cell-free translation system designed to synthesize a library of peptides. The synthetic messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) templates in this library are varied, and as a whole, they utilize all three canonical stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) to signal the end of translation. To ensure the translational machinery can correctly terminate polypeptide synthesis for any template in the library, the system must be supplemented with the appropriate set of prokaryotic Release Factors (RFs). Assuming all other components of the translational apparatus are present and fully functional, which of the following options lists the minimal set of release factors required for both the recognition of all three stop codons and the subsequent recycling of the termination factors?\n\nA. RF1 and RF2\n\nB. RF1 and RF3\n\nC. RF2 and RF3\n\nD. RF1, RF2, and RF3\n\nE. RF3 only", "solution": "In prokaryotes, translation termination at stop codons is mediated by class I release factors that directly recognize stop codons in the A site and catalyze peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, and a class II release factor that promotes factor recycling. RF1 recognizes UAA and UAG, while RF2 recognizes UAA and UGA. Thus, to ensure recognition of all three canonical stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) across the mRNA library, both RF1 and RF2 are required, since RF1 alone cannot recognize UGA and RF2 alone cannot recognize UAG.\n\nAfter peptide release by RF1 or RF2, RF3, a GTPase, facilitates the dissociation and recycling of the class I release factors from the ribosome, thereby preparing the system for subsequent rounds of termination events. Because the problem explicitly requires both recognition of all three stop codons and subsequent recycling of the termination factors, the minimal set must include RF1 and RF2 for comprehensive stop codon recognition and RF3 for recycling.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set is RF1, RF2, and RF3, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2079225"}, {"introduction": "Scientists often use molecular tools that act as inhibitors to dissect complex biochemical pathways. By observing where a process gets stuck, we can deduce the function of specific steps, such as those that require energy. This problem [@problem_id:1532246] presents a thought experiment using a non-hydrolyzable analog of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to probe the translation termination cycle, challenging you to identify the exact moment where energy from GTP hydrolysis is indispensable.", "problem": "In a cell-free *in vitro* prokaryotic translation system, ribosomes are actively translating an mRNA molecule that codes for a specific polypeptide. This system contains all necessary components: ribosomes, mRNA, charged tRNAs, and all required protein factors for initiation, elongation, and termination. A researcher introduces Guanosine 5'-[$\\beta,\\gamma$-imido]triphosphate (GMP-PNP) into the system. GMP-PNP is a non-hydrolyzable analog of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP); it can bind to GTP-binding sites but cannot be hydrolyzed to release energy. Assuming translation proceeds until a ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAG), which of the following events describes the most immediate step at which the termination process will be arrested due to the presence of GMP-PNP?\n\nA. The class I release factor (RF1), which recognizes the UAG stop codon, will be unable to bind to the ribosomal A-site.\n\nB. The peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome will be unable to catalyze the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the completed polypeptide chain to the tRNA in the P-site.\n\nC. The class II release factor (RF3) will be unable to bind to the ribosome-RF1 complex.\n\nD. Both the class I (RF1) and class II (RF3) release factors will become trapped on the ribosome after the polypeptide has been released.\n\nE. The Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) will be unable to promote the dissociation of the 70S ribosome into its 30S and 50S subunits.", "solution": "We begin by enumerating the mechanistic steps of bacterial translation termination and marking which steps require GTP binding and/or hydrolysis:\n\n1. Stop codon recognition: When a UAG stop codon enters the ribosomal A site, the class I release factor RF1 binds directly to the A site by codon recognition. This binding does not require GTP binding or hydrolysis.\n\n2. Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis: RF1, via its conserved GGQ motif, stimulates the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit to catalyze hydrolysis of the ester bond between the completed polypeptide and the P-site tRNA. This chemistry does not require GTP hydrolysis.\n\n3. Class II release factor action: The class II release factor RF3 is a translational GTPase. RF3 in its GTP-bound form binds to the post-release ribosome in complex with RF1. The binding step requires that the GTP-binding site of RF3 be occupied by a GTP-like ligand; a nonhydrolyzable analog such as GMP-PNP can bind and support this association because it mimics GTP binding, although it cannot be hydrolyzed.\n\n4. Release factor dissociation driven by RF3: RF3 uses the energy of GTP hydrolysis to drive factor turnover. In the canonical description, GTP hydrolysis by RF3 is required to promote dissociation of release factors from the ribosome and to permit RF3 itself to dissociate. Therefore, hydrolysis at this step is essential for clearing RF1 and RF3 from the ribosome.\n\n5. Ribosome recycling: After factor dissociation, RRF and EF-G (another translational GTPase) use GTP hydrolysis to split the 70S ribosome into subunits. This occurs after the release factors have been cleared.\n\nNow we analyze the effect of GMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog:\n\n- Since RF1 binding to the A site (step 1) and catalysis of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (step 2) do not require GTP hydrolysis, these steps proceed normally. Thus options A and B are incorrect.\n\n- RF3 requires a GTP-like ligand to bind, and GMP-PNP can occupy the GTP-binding pocket and permit RF3 to bind to the ribosome-RF1 complex. Therefore RF3 binding itself is not blocked; option C is incorrect.\n\n- The first step that specifically requires GTP hydrolysis is the RF3-driven turnover of release factors (step 4). Because GMP-PNP cannot be hydrolyzed, RF3 cannot perform the hydrolysis-driven dissociation step. As a consequence, the termination complex is arrested with release factors remaining bound to the ribosome after the polypeptide has been released. This corresponds to both RF1 and RF3 becoming trapped on the ribosome. Thus option D describes the most immediate arrest point caused by GMP-PNP.\n\n- Ribosome recycling (option E) also requires GTP hydrolysis (by EF-G), but it occurs later than the RF3-mediated release factor turnover; therefore it is not the most immediate arrest point.\n\nHence, the earliest termination step that is arrested by GMP-PNP is the RF3-dependent, GTP-hydrolysis-driven dissociation of the release factors, resulting in trapping of RF1 and RF3 on the ribosome after peptide release.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1532246"}, {"introduction": "Inside a cell, molecular events are rarely unopposed; they are often a matter of kinetic competition.

Experimental analysis of this strain reveals that when a ribosome encounters a UAG codon, translational readthrough (the insertion of an amino acid) occurs in 15.0% of events. The remaining events result in normal translation termination. This termination is mediated by Release Factor 1 (RF1), which competes with the suppressor tRNA for binding to the ribosomal A-site.\n\nA researcher then introduces a second, independent mutation into the *prfA* gene, which encodes the RF1 protein. This new mutation impairs the ability of RF1 to bind to the ribosome, reducing its effective association rate constant (on-rate) for the A-site to 35.0% of the original, wild-type rate.\n\nAssuming that the intracellular concentrations of the suppressor tRNA and the mutant RF1 protein remain unchanged from their original levels, and that the kinetics of the suppressor tRNA binding are unaffected by the RF1 mutation, calculate the new ratio of terminated protein products to readthrough protein products in this double-mutant strain.\n\nExpress your answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $k_{\\text{t}}$ be the effective association rate constant for the suppressor tRNA binding to the A-site, and let $k_{\\text{RF1}}$ be the corresponding rate for RF1.
