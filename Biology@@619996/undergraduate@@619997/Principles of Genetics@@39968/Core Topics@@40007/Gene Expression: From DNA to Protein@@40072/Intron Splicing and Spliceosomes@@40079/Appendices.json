[@problem_id:1499672]", "problem": "A molecular biology researcher is studying pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in a cell-free system derived from eukaryotic nuclei. A specific pre-mRNA molecule, which is known to contain a single intron flanked by two exons, is synthesized with a radioactive label to allow for its tracking. This labeled pre-mRNA is added to the nuclear extract, which contains all the necessary components for splicing, including the spliceosome. After an incubation period sufficient for the splicing reaction to complete, the researcher isolates all the resulting RNA molecules. To confirm the successful excision of the intron, the researcher must identify the RNA molecule that corresponds to the released intron.\n\nWhich of the following unique chemical structures or covalent linkages is the definitive signature of a fully excised intron lariat, distinguishing it from the pre-mRNA, the mature mRNA, and other cellular RNA molecules?\n\nA. A 2',5'-phosphodiester bond\n\nB. A 5' to 5' triphosphate bridge\n\nC. A 3',5'-phosphodiester bond\n\nD. A glycosidic bond between a ribose sugar and a guanine base\n\nE. A peptide bond", "solution": "The process of removing introns from pre-mRNA is called splicing, and it is carried out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. The mechanism of splicing involves two sequential chemical reactions known as transesterification reactions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the standard structure of an RNA molecule. Nucleotides are linked together by 3',5'-phosphodiester bonds, where the phosphate group on the 5' carbon of one ribose sugar forms a bond with the hydroxyl group on the 3' carbon of the adjacent ribose sugar.\n\nThe splicing process begins with the first transesterification reaction. Within the intron, there is a conserved adenosine nucleotide known as the branch point. The 2'-hydroxyl (2'-OH) group of this branch point adenosine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site (the boundary between the upstream exon and the intron). This attack breaks the standard 3',5'-phosphodiester bond at the 5' end of the intron.\n\nCrucially, this reaction forms a new, unconventional covalent bond: a 2',5'-phosphodiester bond. This bond links the 5' guanosine of the intron to the 2' carbon of the branch point adenosine. The formation of this bond results in the intron curling back on itself to form a loop structure, which is called a lariat.\n\nThe second transesterification reaction then occurs. The now-free 3'-OH group of the upstream exon attacks the 3' splice site (the boundary between the intron and the downstream exon). This reaction joins the two exons together, forming a continuous coding sequence (the mature mRNA), and simultaneously releases the intron in its lariat form.\n\nTherefore, the fully excised intron is characterized by this lariat structure, which contains one unique 2',5'-phosphodiester bond in addition to its standard 3',5'-phosphodiester bonds. This makes the 2',5'-phosphodiester bond the definitive signature of the excised intron.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- **B. A 5' to 5' triphosphate bridge:** This is the characteristic structure of the 5' cap added to the beginning of eukaryotic mRNA molecules, not a feature of the excised intron.\n- **C. A 3',5'-phosphodiester bond:** This is the standard bond that links nucleotides in all RNA and DNA molecules. While the excised intron contains many of these bonds, it is not a unique or distinguishing feature.\n- **D. A glycosidic bond:** This bond links the ribose sugar to the nitrogenous base in every nucleotide. It is a fundamental component of all RNA, not a unique feature of the splicing product.\n- **E. A peptide bond:** This is the covalent bond that links amino acids together to form proteins. It is not found in RNA.\n\nThus, the only unique chemical linkage that identifies the excised intron lariat is the 2',5'-phosphodiester bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1499672"}, {"introduction": "While the splicing reaction itself involves the formation and breaking of phosphodiester bonds, the assembly of the spliceosome machinery to carry out this task is a highly dynamic and energy-intensive process. The spliceosome is not a pre-formed entity but rather a complex that assembles and remodels itself on the pre-mRNA substrate, a process driven by ATP hydrolysis. This problem presents a classic experimental scenario, asking you to predict the consequences of blocking this energy supply, thereby revealing a critical, energy-dependent checkpoint in spliceosome assembly.

They prepare an in vitro splicing reaction containing a purified pre-mRNA substrate with two exons and one intron, along with a nuclear extract that provides all necessary splicing factors, including small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The standard reaction buffer includes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source.\n\nTo investigate the role of ATP hydrolysis, the researcher sets up a parallel experiment where ATP is completely replaced by an equimolar concentration of adenosine 5'-[$\\gamma$-thio]triphosphate (ATP-$\\gamma$-S). This molecule is an analog of ATP where one of the oxygen atoms on the terminal phosphate group is replaced by a sulfur atom. ATP-$\\gamma$-S can be bound by most ATP-dependent enzymes but cannot be hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).\n\nThe assembly of the catalytic spliceosome proceeds through a series of defined complexes:\n- **E (Early) complex:** U1 snRNP binds to the 5' splice site of the intron.\n- **A complex:** U2 snRNP is recruited to and stably binds the branch point sequence within the intron.\n- **B complex:** The pre-assembled U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP joins the A complex, forming the pre-catalytic spliceosome.\n- **C complex:** Major rearrangements occur, releasing U1 and U4 snRNPs and forming the catalytically active core for the first chemical step.\n\nGiven this experimental setup, at which of the following stages will the splicing process be arrested?\n\nA.

The first transesterification reaction (branch point attack on the 5' splice site).", "solution": "The key constraint is that ATP-$\\gamma$-S can bind ATP-dependent enzymes but cannot be hydrolyzed to ADP, so any step that requires ATP hydrolysis will fail, whereas steps that only require binding or are ATP independent can proceed.\n\nApply this principle stepwise to spliceosome assembly:\n1. E complex formation: U1 snRNP recognition of the 5' splice site is ATP independent. Therefore, E complex formation proceeds without hydrolysis.\n2. A complex formation: Stable recruitment and base pairing of U2 snRNP to the branch point requires ATP hydrolysis, driven by DExD/H-box ATPases (for example, Prp5) to remodel RNA-protein interactions and displace branch-point binding proteins. With ATP-$\\gamma$-S present, hydrolysis cannot occur, so this stabilization step fails.\n3. B complex formation: Recruitment of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP requires a properly formed A complex. Even if this joining per se does not strictly require hydrolysis, it cannot occur without A complex formation first.\n4. C complex formation: Activation steps including release of U1 and U4 and unwinding of U4/U6 by the helicase Brr2 require ATP hydrolysis; these steps are downstream and would also be blocked, but only after A complex formation.\n5. First transesterification reaction: This chemical step requires prior ATP-dependent rearrangements to form the catalytically active center; thus it is also downstream of A complex formation and would not be reached.\n\nTherefore, the earliest arrest point under ATP-$\\gamma$-S is the stable binding of U2 to form the A complex.\n\nBy matching to the options, the arrest occurs at the stage of stable U2 snRNP binding to form the A complex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1499685"}, {"introduction": "The components of the splicing machinery are themselves encoded by genes, creating a fascinating web of self-regulation and dependence. What would happen if a gene encoding a vital part of the spliceosome itself required splicing to become functional? This advanced problem explores such a scenario, testing your ability to think at a systems level and predict the cascading, transcriptome-wide effects of a single point mutation in a critical gene, highlighting the profound interconnectedness of gene expression. [@problem_id:1499678]", "problem": "In a eukaryotic organism, the spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for removing introns from pre-messenger RNA transcripts. A key component of the major spliceosome is the U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which recognizes and binds to the branch point sequence within an intron to initiate the splicing process. Intriguingly, the gene that encodes the U2 snRNA itself contains a single, U2-dependent intron.\n\nConsider a specific mutation in a diploid cell line where both alleles of the U2 snRNA gene have been altered. The mutation is a single nucleotide substitution that changes the crucial branch point adenosine (A) within the U2 pre-snRNA's own intron to a guanosine (G). Assuming the cell survives the initial period after this mutation becomes active, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary, transcriptome-wide consequence of this specific mutation?\n\nA. The cell will exhibit a global failure in splicing for the vast majority of introns, leading to the accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs for many different genes.\n\nB. Only the U2 pre-snRNA will fail to be spliced, but splicing of other pre-mRNAs will proceed normally using the existing pool of U2 snRNA.\n\nC. The minor spliceosome (U12-dependent) will compensate for the defect, taking over the splicing of all introns normally processed by the major spliceosome.\n\nD. The mutation will cause the spliceosome to incorrectly recognize and remove exons instead of introns from all pre-mRNAs.\n\nE. Transcription of all protein-coding genes will be immediately halted as a direct feedback response to the splicing defect.", "solution": "1) Biological principle: In the major spliceosome, U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) base-pairs with the intronic branch point sequence such that the branch point adenosine is unpaired (bulged) and positioned for the first transesterification reaction of splicing. In this first step, the 2'-hydroxyl of the branch point adenosine attacks the phosphate at the 5' splice site to form the lariat intermediate. The identity of the branch point nucleotide as adenosine is required both for correct U2 recognition and for proper catalysis.\n\n2) Given: The U2 snRNA gene itself has a U2-dependent intron. A mutation changes the branch point adenosine in this intron to guanosine on both alleles in a diploid cell. This directly disrupts recognition by U2 and the formation of the bulged branch point adenosine required for catalysis, so the U2 pre-snRNA intron cannot be spliced by the major spliceosome. Therefore, new mature U2 snRNA molecules cannot be produced from either allele.\n\n3) Immediate versus primary consequence: There is an existing pool of mature U2 snRNA pre-mutation. The prompt states the cell survives the initial period after the mutation becomes active, implying that this pre-existing pool temporarily sustains splicing. However, without new production, U2 snRNA levels will decline due to normal turnover. As U2 snRNA is an essential core component of the major spliceosome, depletion of U2 leads to failure of splicing for U2-type introns, which constitute the vast majority of introns in the transcriptome.\n\n4) Transcriptome-wide outcome: As U2 becomes limiting and then depleted, splicing of most pre-mRNAs stalls, causing accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs across many genes. The minor spliceosome (U12-dependent) processes only a small subset of introns and cannot substitute for U2-dependent splicing. There is no mechanism whereby this specific mutation would cause the spliceosome to remove exons globally, nor is there an immediate, universal halt of transcription as a direct feedback to this splicing defect.\n\n5) Option analysis:\n- A: Predicts global failure of splicing for the vast majority of introns with accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs. This matches the depletion of an essential U2 component.\n- B: Incorrect because the inability to produce new U2 snRNA will, after the initial period, impair splicing of other pre-mRNAs transcriptome-wide.\n- C: Incorrect; the U12-dependent (minor) spliceosome cannot take over the bulk U2-type introns.\n- D: Incorrect; the mutation specifically blocks U2 production rather than globally redirecting splice site choice to exons.\n- E: Incorrect; splicing defects do not directly and immediately halt transcription of all protein-coding genes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1499678"}]}
