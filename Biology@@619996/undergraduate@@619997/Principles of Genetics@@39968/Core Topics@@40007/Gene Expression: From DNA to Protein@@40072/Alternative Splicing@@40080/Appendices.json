{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in studying alternative splicing is often to simply see if different mRNA versions of a gene exist. This exercise simulates the interpretation of a classic molecular biology experiment, Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), a powerful tool for visualizing and comparing the lengths of mRNA transcripts from different tissues. By analyzing the hypothetical results from this experiment, you will practice the fundamental skill of deducing the size of a cassette exon, directly linking an experimental outcome to the underlying splicing event [@problem_id:1468340].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the expression of a newly identified gene, which we will call Gene-X, in different mammalian tissues. It is hypothesized that Gene-X undergoes alternative splicing, a process where different combinations of exons are joined together from the initial pre-mRNA transcript, leading to different protein variants in different cell types.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the biologist isolates messenger RNA (mRNA) from brain tissue and from lung tissue. Using these mRNA samples, they perform a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiment. The primers used for the PCR step are designed to be complementary to sequences within two specific exons that are believed to be \"constitutive,\" meaning they are always included in the final mRNA. These two constitutive exons are separated by a single \"cassette exon,\" which may be either included or excluded during splicing.\n\nAfter running the RT-PCR products on an electrophoresis gel, the biologist observes a single, distinct band for each tissue sample. The product amplified from the brain tissue mRNA is 450 base pairs (bp) in length. The product amplified from the lung tissue mRNA is 300 bp in length.\n\nAssuming the difference in size is due solely to the inclusion or exclusion of the single cassette exon, calculate the size of this alternatively spliced cassette exon. Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "The problem asks for the size of an alternatively spliced cassette exon based on the results of a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiment.\n\nFirst, let's understand the experimental setup. RT-PCR is a two-step process used to detect and quantify messenger RNA (mRNA). In the first step, Reverse Transcription, mRNA is converted into its complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence. In the second step, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify a specific segment of this cDNA. The size of the final amplified DNA product, visualized as a band on a gel, corresponds to the length of the mRNA segment between the sites where the primers bind.\n\nThe gene in question, Gene-X, has two constitutive exons with a single cassette exon located between them. The primers for the PCR step are designed to bind within these two constitutive exons. Let's denote the length of the amplified region, excluding the cassette exon, as $L_{const}$. This length is composed of the parts of the two constitutive exons that lie between the primer binding sites.\n\nAlternative splicing can lead to two different mature mRNA transcripts from the same pre-mRNA:\n1.  A transcript that includes the cassette exon.\n2.  A transcript that excludes (splices out) the cassette exon.\n\nLet the size of the cassette exon be $L_{cassette}$.\n\nWhen the cassette exon is included in the mature mRNA, the total length of the region amplified by the primers will be the sum of the constant part and the cassette exon part.\n$$L_{long} = L_{const} + L_{cassette}$$\n\nWhen the cassette exon is excluded from the mature mRNA, the two constitutive exons are spliced directly together. The total length of the region amplified by the primers will then just be the constant part.\n$$L_{short} = L_{const}$$\n\nThe experiment yields two products of different sizes from two different tissues:\n-   From brain tissue, the product size is 450 bp.\n-   From lung tissue, the product size is 300 bp.\n\nSince the inclusion of the exon results in a longer transcript, the 450 bp product must correspond to the mRNA species that includes the cassette exon, and the 300 bp product must correspond to the species that excludes it.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equations:\n$$450 \\text{ bp} = L_{long} = L_{const} + L_{cassette}$$\n$$300 \\text{ bp} = L_{short} = L_{const}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the size of the cassette exon, $L_{cassette}$. We can substitute the value of $L_{const}$ from the second equation into the first equation:\n$$450 \\text{ bp} = 300 \\text{ bp} + L_{cassette}$$\n\nSolving for $L_{cassette}$:\n$$L_{cassette} = 450 \\text{ bp} - 300 \\text{ bp}$$\n$$L_{cassette} = 150 \\text{ bp}$$\n\nThus, the size of the alternatively spliced cassette exon is 150 base pairs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{150}$$", "id": "1468340"}, {"introduction": "Once we observe that an exon can be skipped, the next crucial question is what this means for the final protein product. This thought experiment challenges you to connect the process of alternative splicing with the fundamental rules of protein translation, specifically the concept of the reading frame [@problem_id:1468325]. Understanding this connection is vital, as it explains why the precise length of an exon is a critical factor that determines whether a functional, albeit different, protein is produced or if the result is a nonfunctional, truncated protein due to a frameshift.", "problem": "In a particular line of eukaryotic cells, a gene responsible for producing a cytoskeletal protein called \"Structrin\" is actively transcribed. The initial transcript, or pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), contains five exons. In most cell types, all five exons are spliced together to produce a functional mRNA sequence. However, in response to a specific signaling molecule, a specialized splicing factor causes Exon 4 to be excluded from the final mature mRNA transcript. This alternatively spliced mRNA is then translated into a variant of the Structrin protein. The length of Exon 4 is exactly 50 nucleotides.\n\nAssuming that the splicing of Exon 3 to Exon 5 is successful and does not introduce or remove any additional nucleotides at the splice junction, which of the following statements describes the most direct and certain consequence for the reading frame of the mature mRNA?\n\nA. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 16 amino acids.\nB. The reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction.\nC. The reading frame will be unaffected because the ribosome can skip over the altered splice junction.\nD. Splicing will be completely blocked, as exons that are not a multiple of three nucleotides in length cannot be removed.\nE. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 17 amino acids.", "solution": "The central principle required to solve this problem is the nature of the genetic code and the concept of a reading frame. The genetic code is a triplet code, meaning that the sequence of nucleotides in a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three. Each group of three nucleotides is called a codon, and it specifies a particular amino acid (or a stop signal).\n\nThe reading frame is the specific way in which the sequence of nucleotides is partitioned into codons. A continuous coding sequence is established when the ribosome initiates translation at a start codon (usually AUG) and reads in triplets from that point onwards.\n\nIn this problem, a gene's pre-mRNA is processed. The process of splicing removes introns and joins exons together to form the mature mRNA. In the standard case, all five exons are joined, creating a continuous reading frame. In the case of alternative splicing described, Exon 4 is skipped. This means that Exon 3 is ligated directly to Exon 5.\n\nThe length of the skipped Exon 4 is 50 nucleotides. For the reading frame to be maintained across the new splice junction (between Exon 3 and Exon 5), the number of nucleotides removed must be an integer multiple of 3. If a multiple of 3 nucleotides is removed, an integer number of codons is removed, and the reading frame downstream of the deletion remains aligned as before.\n\nLet's analyze the number of nucleotides removed: 50. We check if 50 is a multiple of 3.\n$$\n\\frac{50}{3} = 16.666...\n$$\nSince 50 is not an integer multiple of 3, removing this exon will cause a frameshift mutation. After Exon 3, the ribosome will continue reading in triplets, but because 50 nucleotides are missing, the grouping of nucleotides into codons will be shifted. For example, if the original sequence was `...AAA GGG CCC TTT...` where `AAA` is the last codon in Exon 3 and `GGG` is the first codon in Exon 4, and let's say after 50 nucleotides the sequence at the start of Exon 5 is `UUU`, the new sequence becomes `...AAA UUU...`. However, the shift is more complex. The removal of 50 nucleotides means the removal of 16 full codons and 2 extra nucleotides ($50 = 16 \\times 3 + 2$). This 2-nucleotide deficit will cause all subsequent codons to be read out of frame. This altered sequence of codons will almost certainly code for a completely different sequence of amino acids. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation very often introduces a premature stop codon, leading to the synthesis of a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option claims the reading frame is preserved. This is incorrect, as 50 is not a multiple of 3. The calculation of 16 amino acids comes from $50 \\div 3 \\approx 16$, which ignores the remainder and its effect on the reading frame.\n\nB. This option correctly states that the reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction. This is the direct and unavoidable consequence of deleting a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of 3.\n\nC. This option suggests the ribosome can compensate for the change. Ribosomes do not have such a mechanism; they slavishly read the mRNA in triplets from the start codon. They cannot \"skip over\" or correct a frameshift in the mRNA template.\n\nD. This option claims splicing is blocked. This is incorrect. The splicing machinery recognizes specific sequences at the exon-intron boundaries (splice donor and acceptor sites), not the length of the exon in relation to the genetic code. Alternative splicing is a regulated process that allows for the skipping of exons regardless of their length.\n\nE. This option, like A, incorrectly claims the reading frame is preserved. The calculation of 17 amino acids is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and certain consequence is a shift in the reading frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468325"}, {"introduction": "Splicing is not a random process; it is tightly regulated by specific sequence elements within the gene itself. This practice explores the sophisticated layer of splicing regulation by examining how a seemingly minor change in the DNA, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), can have a dramatic effect [@problem_id:1468318]. You will analyze a fascinating scenario where a 'silent' mutation—one that does not change the amino acid sequence—disrupts a critical regulatory signal called an Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE), leading to exon skipping and a dysfunctional protein.", "problem": "A human gene, designated *SDR1* (Splicing Disruption Regulator 1), encodes a critical signaling protein. The gene consists of three exons and two introns. In its normal, wild-type form, the mature messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from this gene is translated into a protein that is 150 amino acids long. Exon 1 codes for the first 50 amino acids, Exon 2 for the next 40 amino acids, and Exon 3 for the final 60 amino acids.\n\nA genetic screening identifies an individual with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the *SDR1* gene. The DNA sequence of the coding strand for a small segment within Exon 2 is compared between a wild-type individual and the affected individual:\n\n- **Wild-Type Sequence:** `... GGT ACA CCA TGG ...`\n- **Patient's Sequence:** `... GGT ACA CCG TGG ...`\n\nFurther molecular analysis has established that the sequence motif `ACACCA` within Exon 2 functions as an Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE). ESEs are sequences within exons that recruit splicing factors to promote the accurate removal of adjacent introns and the inclusion of the exon in the final mRNA.\n\nAssume the following partial genetic code, where codons are written in their mRNA form (`U` replaces `T`):\n- **Threonine (Thr):** ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG\n- **Proline (Pro):** CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG\n\nBased on this information, what is the most likely composition of the SDR1 protein produced in the patient?\n\nA. The patient produces a normal, full-length SDR1 protein of 150 amino acids.\nB. The patient produces a truncated SDR1 protein due to a premature stop codon introduced by the SNP.\nC. The patient produces an SDR1 protein that is 40 amino acids shorter than the normal version.\nD. The patient produces an SDR1 protein with a single amino acid substitution.\nE. The patient fails to produce any SDR1 protein because the SNP blocks transcription initiation.", "solution": "First, interpret the provided DNA coding-strand segment as codons. The wild-type coding sequence segment is written with codons as 3-base units: `... GGT ACA CCA TGG ...`. The corresponding mRNA codons are obtained by replacing `T` with `U`, so the wild-type mRNA segment is `... GGU ACA CCA UGG ...`. Using the provided genetic code, these encode Gly (GGU), Thr (ACA), Pro (CCA), and Trp (UGG).\n\nIn the patient, the coding-strand segment is `... GGT ACA CCG TGG ...`, giving mRNA `... GGU ACA CCG UGG ...`. The codon change is from `CCA` to `CCG`. Both `CCA` and `CCG` encode Proline (Pro), so the SNP is synonymous at the level of codon translation and does not introduce a missense or nonsense mutation. Therefore, there is no direct amino acid substitution and no premature stop codon from the codon change itself.\n\nHowever, the sequence motif `ACACCA` within Exon 2 is specified to be an Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE). In the wild type, the contiguous bases `ACA` followed by `CCA` form `ACACCA`. In the patient, the SNP changes `CCA` to `CCG`, converting `ACACCA` to `ACACCG`, thereby disrupting the ESE. Loss of an ESE decreases recruitment of splicing factors necessary for exon inclusion and commonly leads to exon skipping of the affected exon during pre-mRNA splicing.\n\nGiven that Exon 2 normally contributes 40 amino acids to the open reading frame, skipping Exon 2 would remove exactly those 40 amino acids if the reading frame is preserved across the Exon 1–Exon 3 junction. The problem statement partitions the protein as Exon 1: 50 amino acids, Exon 2: 40 amino acids, Exon 3: 60 amino acids, totaling 150 amino acids. This framing implies that exons are in-frame and their direct junction preserves the reading frame. Therefore, exon skipping of Exon 2 would yield a mature mRNA encoding Exon 1 plus Exon 3, for a total length of 50 + 60 = 110 amino acids, which is 40 amino acids shorter than the normal 150-amino-acid SDR1 protein.\n\nThus, the most likely composition of the SDR1 protein produced in the patient is a protein 40 amino acids shorter than normal.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1468318"}]}
