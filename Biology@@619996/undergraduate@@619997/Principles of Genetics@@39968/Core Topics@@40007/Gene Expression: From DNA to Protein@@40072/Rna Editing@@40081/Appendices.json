A single nucleotide change can be silent, or it can drastically alter the protein's fate. This problem lets you explore how a C-to-U editing event can change a codon's meaning, linking a specific post-transcriptional modification directly to its profound impact on protein translation [@problem_id:1518563].", "problem": "In certain eukaryotic organisms, a post-transcriptional modification process known as RNA editing can alter the sequence of an mRNA molecule. One common type is Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing, where a cytidine (C) nucleotide in the RNA is enzymatically converted to a uridine (U).\n\nConsider a hypothetical gene whose mRNA transcript contains the codon `5'-CGA-3'` at a critical position. During protein synthesis, this unedited codon is translated into an amino acid. However, if a C-to-U editing event occurs at the first position of this specific codon, it results in a non-synonymous change in the polypeptide chain.\n\nGiven the following partial genetic code table where codons are written 5' to 3':\n- `CGA`: Arginine\n- `UGG`: Tryptophan\n- `CUA`: Leucine\n- `UGA`: Stop\n\nWhat is the specific consequence of this C-to-U editing event at the first position of the `CGA` codon on the resulting polypeptide?\n\nA. A synonymous change, where the codon still codes for Arginine.\n\nB. A non-synonymous change, resulting in the incorporation of a Tryptophan residue.\n\nC. A non-synonymous change, resulting in the incorporation of a Leucine residue.\n\nD. A non-synonymous change, leading to premature termination of translation.\n\nE. A frameshift mutation, altering the entire downstream amino acid sequence.", "solution": "The problem asks for the consequence of a specific RNA editing event on protein synthesis. We can determine the outcome by following these steps.\n\nStep 1: Identify the original mRNA codon and the amino acid it codes for.\nThe problem states that the original codon in the mRNA sequence is `5'-CGA-3'`. According to the provided genetic code table, the codon `CGA` codes for the amino acid Arginine.\n\nStep 2: Determine the change that occurs due to RNA editing.\nThe editing process is described as Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing at the first position of the codon. This means the first base, Cytidine (C), is converted into Uridine (U).\n\nStep 3: Determine the new codon after the editing event.\nThe original codon is `CGA`. Changing the first base from C to U results in the new codon `5'-UGA-3'`.\n\nStep 4: Determine the meaning of the new, edited codon.\nWe refer to the provided genetic code table to find what the `UGA` codon specifies. The table indicates that `UGA` is a stop codon.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the consequence of the change from an amino acid-coding codon to a stop codon.\nThe original codon `CGA` would have led to the incorporation of an Arginine amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain. The new codon `UGA` is a termination signal. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it does not incorporate an amino acid; instead, it releases the polypeptide chain, terminating the process of translation. This leads to a truncated (shortened) protein, which is almost always non-functional. This type of mutation, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon, is called a nonsense mutation.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- Option A is incorrect. The change is from Arginine to a stop signal, which is a non-synonymous change, not a synonymous one.\n- Option B is incorrect. The edited codon is `UGA`, not `UGG` (which codes for Tryptophan).\n- Option C is incorrect. The edited codon is `UGA`, not `CUA` (which codes for Leucine).\n- Option D is correct. The change from an Arginine codon (`CGA`) to a stop codon (`UGA`) results in premature termination of translation. This is a type of non-synonymous change.\n- Option E is incorrect. A frameshift mutation is caused by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which shifts the reading frame. This event is a single-base substitution, which does not cause a frameshift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1518563"}, {"introduction": "RNA editing mechanisms are remarkably diverse, extending beyond simple base substitutions. In organisms like *Trypanosoma*, the process involves a complex and extensive insertion and deletion of uridine nucleotides, guided by a template molecule. This fascinating practice allows you to simulate this process, using a guide RNA (gRNA) to reconstruct the sequence of a mature mRNA, revealing the elegant complexity of this post-transcriptional editing system [@problem_id:1518587].", "problem": "In the kinetoplasts of protozoans like *Trypanosoma*, a unique form of post-transcriptional modification known as RNA editing occurs. This process involves the insertion or deletion of uracil (U) nucleotides in a pre-edited messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) to create a functional, mature mRNA. This editing is directed by a small guide RNA (gRNA).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1. The gRNA contains an 'anchor' sequence at its 3' end that is perfectly complementary to an 'anchor site' on the 3' portion of the pre-mRNA, allowing the gRNA to bind.\n2. The region of the gRNA upstream (5') of its anchor is the 'template region'. The region of the pre-mRNA upstream (5') of its anchor site is the 'pre-editing region'.\n3. The editing process modifies the pre-editing region to create a sequence that is fully complementary to the gRNA's template region. The established base pairing rules are A-U and G-C, with the allowance of a G-U 'wobble' pair. The anchor site region of the mRNA remains unchanged.\n\nYou are given the following sequences for a pre-mRNA and its corresponding gRNA.\n\n**pre-mRNA:** 5'-GGACAGAGCU-AGGAUCU-3'\n**gRNA:** 3'-UUCGUCUCGU-UCCUAGA-5'\n\nDetermine the full sequence of the mature, edited mRNA.

The gRNA is 3'-UUCGUCUCGU-UCCUAGA-5', whose anchor segment \"UCCUAGA\" is complementary to the mRNA anchor site \"AGGAUCU\" (A-U, G-C pairing for each position), confirming the correct anchor pairing.\n\nThe gRNA template region is therefore the segment \"UUCGUCUCGU\". To make the pre-editing region of the mRNA fully complementary to this template, we assign each position by Watson-Crick pairing rules (A-U and G-C, with G-U wobble allowed but not needed here).
