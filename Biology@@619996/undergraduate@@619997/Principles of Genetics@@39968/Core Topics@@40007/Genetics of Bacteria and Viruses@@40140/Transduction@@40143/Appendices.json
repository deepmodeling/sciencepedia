{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In the study of bacterial genetics, identifying the precise mechanism of gene transfer is a foundational skill. This exercise presents a classic experimental scenario and asks you to deduce whether conjugation, transformation, or transduction is at play. By carefully analyzing the role of experimental controls like filtration and DNase treatment, you will practice the critical thinking required to interpret microbiological data and distinguish between different pathways of horizontal gene transfer [@problem_id:1531208].", "problem": "A microbiology student is investigating horizontal gene transfer between two strains of bacteria. The donor strain, designated `Staphylococcus aureus strain D`, is known to be resistant to the antibiotic novobiocin (`Nov-R`). The recipient strain, `*Staphylococcus aureus* strain R`, is sensitive to novobiocin (`Nov-S`).\n\nThe experiment is conducted as follows:\n1.  A liquid culture of `strain D` (`Nov-R`) is infected with a lytic bacteriophage known to infect this bacterial species. The culture is incubated long enough for the phages to replicate and lyse the host cells, creating a lysate.\n2.  This lysate is passed through a sterile filter with a pore size of 0.22 micrometers. This filter size is small enough to block all bacterial cells but allows the much smaller bacteriophage particles to pass through into the filtrate.\n3.  The resulting bacteria-free filtrate is then treated with a sufficient concentration of DNase, an enzyme that degrades all forms of free, extracellular DNA.\n4.  This DNase-treated filtrate is then added to a fresh, growing liquid culture of `strain R` (`Nov-S`).\n5.  After a period of incubation, a sample of the `strain R` culture is spread onto an agar plate containing a selective concentration of novobiocin.\n\nThe student observes a significant number of `strain R` colonies growing on the novobiocin-containing plate, indicating they have acquired resistance.\n\nBased on the described experimental procedure and its outcome, which of the following is the most likely mechanism of genetic transfer that conferred novobiocin resistance to `strain R`?\n\nA. Conjugation\n\nB. Transformation\n\nC. Transduction\n\nD. Spontaneous Mutation\n\nE. Transposition", "solution": "We begin by identifying the experimental manipulations and the biological principles they test. A lytic bacteriophage was used to infect a donor culture carrying novobiocin resistance (Nov-R), followed by filtration through a pore size that removes bacterial cells but not phage particles, followed by DNase treatment to destroy any extracellular DNA, and finally addition of the filtrate to a recipient culture that is novobiocin sensitive (Nov-S). After incubation, resistant colonies arise on novobiocin plates. We evaluate each candidate mechanism against these constraints.\n\nConjugation requires direct cell-to-cell contact mediated by conjugative pili between a donor and a recipient. The sterile filtration step physically removes all bacterial cells from the lysate, leaving only phage particles in the filtrate. Therefore, no donor cells remain to engage in conjugation, ruling out option A.\n\nTransformation requires recipient uptake of free, extracellular DNA. The filtrate was explicitly treated with DNase, which degrades extracellular DNA. Thus any naked DNA present after lysis would be destroyed before exposure to the recipient. Therefore, transformation is ruled out by the DNase treatment, eliminating option B.\n\nTransduction is phage-mediated gene transfer. In a lytic cycle, bacteriophages can accidentally package fragments of the host (donor) bacterial chromosome, including genes conferring antibiotic resistance, producing transducing particles. DNA packaged inside a phage capsid is protected from DNase digestion. After the DNase-treated filtrate (containing phage and any transducing particles) is added to the recipient culture, infection can deliver the donor DNA into recipient cells, where it can be maintained (e.g., by homologous recombination), producing novobiocin-resistant progeny. The use of a lytic phage, the filtration that removes cells but retains phage, and the DNase-resistance of DNA protected in capsids together make transduction the mechanism consistent with the observed acquisition of resistance. This supports option C.\n\nSpontaneous mutation could in principle generate novobiocin-resistant colonies, but the frequency of spontaneous resistance mutations is typically low, and the observation of a significant number of resistant colonies specifically after addition of the phage lysate, combined with the designed controls that exclude other mechanisms, strongly argues against spontaneous mutation as the primary explanation. Thus option D is unlikely.\n\nTransposition refers to movement of transposable elements within or between replicons inside a cell; by itself it does not mediate DNA transfer between donor and recipient cells. Even if the resistance determinant resides on a transposon, its movement between strains in this setup would still depend on a transfer vehicle, which here is the bacteriophage. Therefore the intercellular transfer mechanism is transduction, not transposition, ruling out option E.\n\nGiven these constraints and outcomes, the most likely mechanism is phage-mediated transduction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1531208"}, {"introduction": "Once a gene has been transferred, the next challenge for a geneticist is to isolate the rare cells that successfully incorporated it from a vast population. This practice problem requires you to design an experiment to select for specific transductants [@problem_id:1531200]. Success hinges on applying your knowledge of selective media, auxotrophy, and antibiotic resistance to create an environment where only the cells with the desired genetic modification can survive and grow.", "problem": "An experiment in bacterial genetics aims to transfer a gene for histidine biosynthesis using generalized transduction. The donor bacterial strain is $his^+ leu^+ str^S$, meaning it can synthesize its own histidine and leucine (it is prototrophic for these amino acids) but is sensitive to the antibiotic streptomycin. The recipient strain is $his^- leu^- str^R$, meaning it is auxotrophic for histidine and leucine (it requires them in its growth medium) but is resistant to streptomycin.\n\nA generalized transducing bacteriophage is first used to infect the donor strain. The resulting phage lysate, containing phage particles that may carry fragments of the donor's chromosome, is then harvested and used to infect a culture of the recipient strain. To isolate the $his^+$ transductants (recipient cells that have successfully incorporated the $his^+$ gene), the mixture of phage and recipient cells is plated onto a selection medium.\n\nAssume that \"minimal medium\" is a solid agar medium containing only a suitable carbon source (glucose) and essential inorganic salts, but no amino acids.

Therefore:\n   - If histidine is absent, only $his^{+}$ cells can grow.\n   - If leucine is absent, only $leu^{+}$ cells can grow.\n2) Supplementing a required amino acid in the medium complements auxotrophy for that amino acid, allowing $...^{-}$ strains to grow with respect to that requirement.\n3) Streptomycin in the medium kills $str^{S}$ cells and permits growth of $str^{R}$ cells. Therefore, adding streptomycin counterselects donor survivors ($str^{S}$) while allowing recipients and their transductants ($str^{R}$).\n\nGoal for isolating $his^{+}$ transductants:\n- Do not add histidine, so that only $his^{+}$ cells can grow.\n- Do add leucine, so that $his^{+}$ transductants that remain $leu^{-}$ (the common outcome, since co-transduction of $leu^{+}$ is not assured) can still grow.\n- Do add streptomycin, to eliminate any surviving donor ($str^{S}$) cells.\n\nEvaluate each medium:\nA) Minimal medium + glucose + histidine + leucine:\n- Both histidine and leucine are supplied; $his^{-} leu^{-}$ recipients can grow. No streptomycin, so donors can also grow. Not selective for $his^{+}$ transductants.\n\nB) Minimal medium + glucose:\n- Requires $his^{+}$ and $leu^{+}$ simultaneously. This would exclude most $his^{+}$ transductants that remain $leu^{-}$ and would allow donor $his^{+} leu^{+}$ to grow (no streptomycin present). Not effective.\n\nC) Minimal medium + glucose + leucine + streptomycin:\n- Histidine absent: selects for $his^{+}$.\n- Leucine present: permits growth of $leu^{-}$ recipients that have acquired $his^{+}$.\n- Streptomycin present: kills donor $str^{S}$ cells; recipients and their transductants are $str^{R}$ and survive.\n- This specifically selects $his^{+} str^{R}$ transductants and excludes original $his^{-}$ recipients and donor survivors.\n\nD) Rich nutrient medium (all amino acids) + streptomycin:\n- All auxotrophies are complemented; both original recipients ($str^{R}$) and $his^{+}$ transductants grow. Not selective for $his^{+}$.\n\nE) Minimal medium + glucose + histidine + streptomycin:\n- Histidine present and leucine absent: selection is for $leu^{+}$, not $his^{+}$. This would isolate rare co-transductants that acquired $leu^{+}$ (and, if present, remain $str^{R}$), not specifically $his^{+}$ alone.
