This exercise challenges you to act as a bioinformatic detective, sifting through DNA sequence data to find the characteristic molecular fingerprints of a retrotransposon. By learning to distinguish features like long terminal repeats (LTRs) and genes for specific enzymes, you will develop the crucial skill of classifying mobile elements based on their structural evidence [@problem_id:1532914].", "problem": "A team of plant geneticists is studying the genetic basis of petal color in the fictional flower species *Petunia hypothetica*. In the wild-type plant, a functional gene, which they name `Colorin-1` (`CLR1`), produces a red pigment, resulting in red flowers. The team discovers a rare, naturally occurring mutant plant that produces pure white flowers.\n\nUpon sequencing the genomes of both the wild-type and the white-flowered mutant, they find that the mutant's `CLR1` gene has been disrupted. A large, contiguous block of DNA, approximately 6,000 base pairs in length, has been inserted directly into the protein-coding region of the `CLR1` gene. The researchers hypothesize that this insertion is a retrotransposon, a type of mobile genetic element that moves via an RNA intermediate.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the team performs a detailed bioinformatic analysis of the inserted DNA sequence and the regions of the `CLR1` gene immediately flanking the insertion. Which of the following potential findings would, if observed, provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the insertion is a retrotransposon? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The ends of the inserted element itself consist of several-hundred-base-pair-long sequences that are identical and oriented in the same 5'-to-3' direction.\n\nB. A gene sequence found within the insertion encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to transposase, an enzyme that recognizes, cuts, and re-ligates DNA sequences.\n\nC. A gene sequence found within the insertion encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that synthesizes DNA from an RNA template.\n\nD. The inserted element is flanked on both sides by a short, 5-base-pair direct repeat of the original `CLR1` gene's sequence, which exists as only a single copy at the insertion site in the wild-type plant.\n\nE. The ends of the inserted element itself consist of short sequences (typically 15-25 base pairs) that are nearly perfect inverted complements of one another.", "solution": "A retrotransposon is a mobile genetic element that transposes via an RNA intermediate and is copied back into DNA by reverse transcriptase before integration into a new genomic location. Hallmark features include: (i) an internal open reading frame encoding reverse transcriptase (often within a larger pol polyprotein that may also include RNase H and integrase), (ii) in the LTR subclass, long terminal repeats at both ends that are direct, same-orientation repeats of several hundred base pairs, and (iii) short target site duplications (direct repeats) flanking the insertion, generated during the integration process. By contrast, DNA (cut-and-paste) transposons typically encode a transposase and have short terminal inverted repeats at their ends.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Ends that are several-hundred-base-pair-long sequences that are identical and oriented in the same 5'-to-3' direction are characteristic of long terminal repeats, the defining boundary elements of LTR retrotransposons. This provides strong, specific evidence for an LTR retrotransposon.\n\nB. A gene with high similarity to transposase indicates a DNA transposon, not a retrotransposon. This does not support the retrotransposon hypothesis.\n\nC. A gene with high similarity to reverse transcriptase is a hallmark of retrotransposons (both LTR and non-LTR). This provides strong evidence for a retrotransposon.\n\nD. Short direct repeats of the target site flanking the insertion (target site duplications) are produced during integration by retrotransposons. Although DNA transposons can also generate target site duplications, their presence is expected for retrotransposons and supports the hypothesis that the insertion event is transposon-mediated via integration. Thus, this finding supports (though is not uniquely diagnostic for) a retrotransposon.\n\nE. Short terminal inverted repeats are typical of DNA transposons, not retrotransposons. This would argue against a retrotransposon.\n\nTherefore, the findings that provide strong support for a retrotransposon are A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "1532914"}, {"introduction": "Once a transposable element is identified, the next question is how it moves. This problem explores the fundamental mechanistic difference between the two major classes of transposons: retrotransposons (Class I) and DNA transposons (Class II). By predicting the effect of a specific enzyme inhibitor, you will practice applying your knowledge of their distinct molecular toolkits—one reliant on an RNA intermediate and reverse transcriptase, the other on a DNA-cutting transposase [@problem_id:1532880].", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the mechanisms of genome rearrangement in two different model systems. In one experiment, they are studying the mobilization of the human Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1). In a parallel experiment, they are studying the mobilization of the *Ac* (Activator) element in maize (*Zea mays*). Both cell cultures are treated with a newly developed chemical compound that has been shown to be a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Assuming the compound effectively penetrates the cells and reaches its target in both systems, what is the expected outcome on the frequency of transposition for these two elements?\n\nA. Transposition of both the LINE-1 and *Ac* elements would be inhibited.\n\nB. Transposition of the LINE-1 element would be inhibited, but the transposition of the *Ac* element would be unaffected.\n\nC. Transposition of the *Ac* element would be inhibited, but the transposition of the LINE-1 element would be unaffected.\n\nD. Transposition of neither the LINE-1 nor the *Ac* element would be affected.\n\nE. Transposition of both the LINE-1 and *Ac* elements would be enhanced.", "solution": "To determine the effect of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor, we must first understand the distinct mobilization mechanisms of the two transposable elements mentioned: the human LINE-1 element and the maize *Ac* element.\n\nTransposable elements are broadly categorized into two classes based on their mode of transposition.\n\nClass I elements are known as retrotransposons. They utilize a \"copy-and-paste\" mechanism. The process begins with the transcription of the retrotransposon's DNA into an RNA intermediate. This RNA molecule is then used as a template by the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize a new DNA copy of the element. This new DNA copy is subsequently inserted into a different location in the genome. Therefore, the mobilization of Class I elements is critically dependent on the activity of reverse transcriptase. The human LINE-1 element is a canonical example of an autonomous Class I retrotransposon, as it encodes its own reverse transcriptase.\n\nClass II elements are known as DNA transposons. They typically move via a \"cut-and-paste\" mechanism. This process is mediated by an enzyme called transposase, which is often encoded by the transposon itself. The transposase enzyme recognizes the ends of the DNA transposon, excises the entire DNA element from its original location, and inserts it into a new target site in the genome. This mechanism involves only DNA and protein enzymes (transposase); it does not involve an RNA intermediate or the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The maize *Ac* element is a classic example of an autonomous Class II DNA transposon.\n\nThe problem states that the cells are treated with a specific inhibitor of reverse transcriptase.\n\n- For the human LINE-1 element (a Class I retrotransposon), its transposition cycle requires reverse transcriptase to create a new DNA copy from its RNA intermediate. By inhibiting this enzyme, the chemical will block this essential step, thereby preventing the mobilization and insertion of new LINE-1 elements. Thus, LINE-1 transposition will be inhibited.\n\n- For the maize *Ac* element (a Class II DNA transposon), its transposition is catalyzed by the enzyme transposase and does not involve reverse transcriptase. Since the inhibitor is specific to reverse transcriptase, it will have no effect on the function of transposase or any other part of the *Ac* element's transposition cycle. Thus, *Ac* transposition will be unaffected.\n\nCombining these two outcomes, the inhibitor will inhibit the transposition of the LINE-1 element but will not affect the transposition of the *Ac* element. This corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1532880"}, {"introduction": "Transposable elements are powerful drivers of genetic and phenotypic variation, and their activity during an organism's development can have striking visual consequences. This classic genetics problem, based on Barbara McClintock's Nobel Prize-winning work in maize, connects the molecular event of transposon excision to a macroscopic phenotype. You will explore how the timing of transposition—early versus late in development—directly determines the size and number of colored spots on a corn kernel, illustrating the principle of somatic mosaicism [@problem_id:1532887].", "problem": "In maize (corn), the coloration of kernels is controlled by a set of genes. The allele *C* is required for the production of purple anthocyanin pigment, while the recessive allele *c* results in colorless (yellow) kernels. The Activator-Dissociation (Ac-Ds) system is a family of transposable elements that can affect this gene's expression. The Dissociation (*Ds*) element is a non-autonomous transposable element that can insert itself into other genes, disrupting their function. However, *Ds* can only be excised from a gene in the presence of an autonomous Activator (*Ac*) element, which produces the necessary transposase enzyme.\n\nConsider a maize plant with the genotype $C^{Ds}/C$, where one copy of the pigment-producing gene *C* has a *Ds* element inserted within it, rendering it non-functional. This plant also carries a single *Ac* element elsewhere in its genome. During the development of a kernel on this plant, the *Ac* element can trigger the excision of the *Ds* element from the $C^{Ds}$ allele, restoring the function of the *C* allele. This event and all subsequent cell divisions from the restored cell create a patch of pigmented tissue.\n\nHow would the visible phenotype of the kernels, specifically the pattern of purple spots on a colorless background, differ if the *Ds* excision events predominantly occur very early in kernel development compared to a scenario where they predominantly occur much later in development?\n\nA. Early excision results in many small purple spots, while late excision results in a few large purple spots.\n\nB. Early excision results in a few large purple spots, while late excision results in many small purple spots.\n\nC. The timing of excision affects the intensity of the purple color in the spots, with early excision causing darker spots and late excision causing lighter spots.\n\nD. The timing of excision has no effect on the size or number of spots, only on their location on the kernel.\n\nE. Early excision results in completely purple kernels, while late excision results in completely colorless kernels.", "solution": "The pigment-producing allele *C* is rendered nonfunctional when interrupted by a *Ds* insertion, yielding colorless tissue. In the presence of an *Ac* element, *Ds* can excise; when excision restores the reading frame of the $C^{Ds}$ allele in a somatic cell, that cell and all of its descendants produce anthocyanin, forming a purple clonal sector (spot).\n\nLet kernel tissue development proceed through $d$ rounds of mitosis from the initial progenitor to maturity. Let $i$ index the developmental stage at which a $Ds$ excision occurs, with $i=0$ early and $i=d$ late. If an excision occurs at stage $i$, the number of remaining divisions is $d-i$, so the expected size (cell count) of the resulting clone is\n$$\nS(i)\\propto 2^{d-i}.\n$$\nAt stage $i$, the number of cells present is\n$$\nN(i)=2^{i}.\n$$\nIf the per-cell probability of excision during that stage is $p$, then the expected number of independent spots initiated at stage $i$ is proportional to\n$$\n\\text{spots}(i)\\propto p\\,2^{i}.\n$$\nTherefore:\n- Early excision (small $i$) yields few initiating events (small $2^{i}$) but each produces a large clonal sector (large $2^{d-i}$), giving a few large spots.\n- Late excision (large $i$) yields many initiating events (large $2^{i}$) but each produces a small clonal sector (small $2^{d-i}$), giving many small spots.\n\nThe intensity of pigmentation within a spot is governed by restoration of *C* function rather than timing; timing primarily controls clone size. Hence, the correct description is that early excision produces a few large purple spots, whereas late excision produces many small purple spots.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1532887"}]}
