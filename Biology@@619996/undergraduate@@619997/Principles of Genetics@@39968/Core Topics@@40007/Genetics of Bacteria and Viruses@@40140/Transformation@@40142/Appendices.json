The pRESIST plasmid contains a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin (`amp^R`). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic instructions. Three different agar plates are prepared and inoculated:\n\n1.  **+DNA Plate:** Competent *E. coli* cells are mixed with the pRESIST plasmid and plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar containing ampicillin.\n2.  **-DNA Plate (Negative Control):** Competent *E. coli* cells are treated identically but without the addition of the pRESIST plasmid, then plated on LB agar containing ampicillin.\n3.  **Viability Plate (Positive Control):** Competent *E. coli* cells are plated on LB agar without ampicillin.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the student observes the following results:\n*   The **+DNA Plate** shows hundreds of colonies.\n*   The **Viability Plate** shows a uniform, dense lawn of bacterial growth.\n*   The **-DNA Plate** also shows a uniform, dense lawn of bacterial growth, a result that invalidates the experiment.\n\nFrom the choices below, select all options that represent a plausible primary cause for the observed result on the -DNA Plate.\n\nA.

A lawn indicates that the antibiotic selection failed to inhibit growth across the plate. We analyze each option:\n\nA. Exceptionally low transformation efficiency would reduce colony numbers on the +DNA plate, not cause growth on the -DNA plate. The -DNA plate does not depend on transformation; thus low efficiency cannot produce a lawn there. Moreover, the +DNA plate shows hundreds of colonies, inconsistent with exceptionally low efficiency. Therefore, A is not a plausible primary cause.\n\nB. Inactive, expired, or omitted ampicillin means no effective selection on the -DNA plate, allowing all cells to grow as a lawn. This directly explains the dense lawn on the -DNA plate. The +DNA plate could still show many colonies rather than a lawn if the plating density was lower, but in any case, growth would not be inhibited. Therefore, B is a plausible primary cause.\n\nC. Contamination of the -DNA sample with a small volume of the pRESIST plasmid solution would not itself confer resistance to the entire population; only a small number of cells would transform, producing isolated colonies rather than a uniform lawn. Plasmid DNA does not inactivate ampicillin. A uniform lawn implies global loss of selection or pre-existing resistance, not minor plasmid contamination. Therefore, C is not a plausible primary cause for a lawn.\n\nD. If the initial stock culture was already resistant to ampicillin prior to the experiment, then both +DNA and -DNA plates on ampicillin would show growth. The -DNA lawn is explained because all cells can grow without selection pressure. The +DNA plate showing hundreds of colonies is consistent with growth on ampicillin by an already resistant strain (colony morphology may depend on plating density). Therefore, D is a plausible primary cause.\n\nE. Incorrect incubation temperature preventing expression of `amp^R` would reduce or eliminate growth on the +DNA plate, not cause growth on the -DNA plate. It cannot explain a -DNA lawn under ampicillin. Therefore, E is not a plausible primary cause.\n\nTherefore, the plausible primary causes for the -DNA lawn are B and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "1531474"}, {"introduction": "Transformation is more than just a technique for inserting plasmids; it is a powerful tool for dissecting the very architecture of a genome. The principle of cotransformation states that genes located close together on a chromosome are more likely to be transferred together on a single fragment of DNA.

They aim to determine the linkage relationship between three genes involved in synthesizing essential nutrients: `zynA`, `zynB`, and `zynC`. To do this, they perform a transformation experiment. They culture a triple auxotrophic recipient strain, which has the genotype `zynA- zynB- zynC-` and cannot grow on minimal medium. They introduce fragmented chromosomal DNA from a wild-type prototrophic strain (`zynA+ zynB+ zynC+`) into the recipient culture.\n\nAfter transformation, the bacteria are plated on various selective media. By first selecting for transformants of a single gene and then screening those colonies for the presence of the other two wild-type alleles, the researchers determine the cotransformation frequencies for each pair of genes.
