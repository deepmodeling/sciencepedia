The order and direction of gene transfer from an Hfr donor to an F− recipient are not random; they are determined by the specific location and orientation of the integrated F factor within the donor's chromosome. This first practice problem [@problem_id:1478916] challenges you to predict the outcome of a change in F factor orientation, a core concept that lays the groundwork for interpreting data from interrupted mating experiments.", "problem": "In bacterial genetics, a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) strain is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid, known as the Fertility factor (F factor), integrated into its main circular chromosome. During conjugation, the Hfr cell can transfer its chromosome to a recipient (F−) cell, starting from a specific point called the origin of transfer (oriT) located within the integrated F factor.\n\nAn *E. coli* chromosome is known to contain a set of genes in the following clockwise circular order: `... -> proC -> leuA -> argB -> hisG -> metE -> ...`, where each symbol represents a gene locus.\n\nA researcher isolates an Hfr strain, designated `Hfr-1`. Through an interrupted mating experiment with an F− recipient that is auxotrophic for all five markers, the researcher determines that the first three genes transferred from `Hfr-1` are, in order, `proC`, `leuA`, and `argB`.\n\nSubsequently, a second strain, `Hfr-2`, is isolated. Genetic mapping reveals that the F factor in `Hfr-2` is integrated at the exact same chromosomal locus as in `Hfr-1`, but with the opposite orientation.\n\nWhat will be the predicted order of the first three genes transferred from the `Hfr-2` strain to an F− recipient?\n\nA. `proC -> leuA -> argB`\n\nB. `metE -> hisG -> argB`\n\nC. `argB -> leuA -> proC`\n\nD. `metE -> proC -> leuA`\n\nE. `argB -> hisG -> metE`", "solution": "The key physical principle is that in an Hfr strain, chromosomal DNA transfer starts at the origin of transfer (oriT) within the integrated F factor and proceeds in a direction determined by the orientation of the integrated F element. Reversing the orientation reverses the direction of transfer along the chromosome while keeping the integration site the same.\n\nGiven the known clockwise gene order on the circular chromosome: proC -> leuA -> argB -> hisG -> metE.\n\nFrom the interrupted mating with Hfr-1, the first three transferred genes are proC, leuA, argB. This implies that for Hfr-1 the transfer direction across these markers is clockwise, encountering proC first among the five markers, then leuA, then argB.\n\nFor Hfr-2, the F factor is integrated at the same locus but with the opposite orientation, so the transfer direction is reversed relative to Hfr-1. Therefore, among these five markers, the earliest encountered in the reverse (counterclockwise) direction will follow the reverse order of the listed clockwise sequence, namely metE first, then hisG, then argB.\n\nThus, the predicted order of the first three markers transferred from Hfr-2 is metE -> hisG -> argB, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1478916"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, genetic mapping experiments are only as good as their design.

Two selection constraints must be satisfied simultaneously:\n\n1) Exclude/kill donor cells: The donor is `$str^{S}$` (streptomycin sensitive) and the recipient is `$str^{R}$` (streptomycin resistant). Therefore, adding streptomycin to the plating medium will kill `$str^{S}$` donors and allow only `$str^{R}$` recipients (including exconjugants) to grow. Principle: antibiotic selection—`$str^{S}$` cells are inhibited by streptomycin; `$str^{R}$` cells survive.\n\n2) Select specifically for `$pro^{+}$` among recipients: The recipient is `$pro^{-} met^{-} his^{-} arg^{-}$`, so without supplements it requires all four amino acids to grow. To detect acquisition of only `$pro^{+}$`, the medium must require proline prototrophy (i.e., omit proline) but must supply the other three amino acids ($met$, $his$, $arg$), so that growth depends solely on having received `$pro^{+}$` via recombination. Principle: nutritional selection—supplement all other auxotrophic requirements except the one being selected.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A (minimal + methionine, histidine, arginine): Lacks streptomycin, so `$str^{S}$` donors would also grow and swamp the selection. Not acceptable.\n- B (minimal + methionine, histidine, arginine + streptomycin): Satisfies both constraints: kills `$str^{S}$` donors and selects for `$pro^{+}$` among `$str^{R}$` recipients by providing $met$, $his$, $arg$ but not proline. Correct.\n- C (complete + streptomycin): Does not select for `$pro^{+}$`, since complete medium supplies proline; any `$str^{R}$` recipient grows regardless of recombination at `pro`.\n- D (minimal + streptomycin): Overly stringent; it would require recipients to have acquired `$pro^{+}$` and also `$met^{+}$`, `$his^{+}$`, `$arg^{+}$`. This would undercount `$pro^{+}$` exconjugants and not measure entry time for `pro` properly.\n- E (minimal): Lacks streptomycin and all amino acids; donors can grow and recipients would require multiple markers, defeating specific selection for `$pro^{+}$`.\n\nThus, the correct selective medium is minimal medium supplemented with methionine, histidine, arginine, and streptomycin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1478920"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of gene transfer and selection, this final practice problem presents a sophisticated genetic engineering challenge. It requires you to synthesize your knowledge to design a multi-step protocol for isolating a very rare bacterial strain with a specific, engineered genotype. This exercise [@problem_id:1478877] introduces the power of combining positive selection (selecting *for* a trait) with counter-selection (selecting *against* a trait) to achieve a precise genetic outcome, mirroring the elegant strategies used in modern molecular biology labs.", "problem": "A geneticist is working with two strains of *Escherichia coli* to study homologous recombination.\n\nThe donor strain, Strain D, has a chromosome that is `$lacZ^{-}$` (making it unable to metabolize lactose) and `$str^{S}$` (making it sensitive to the antibiotic streptomycin). Strain D harbors a specialized F-prime plasmid, designated F'128. This plasmid carries a functional `$lacZ^{+}$` allele, a gene conferring resistance to kanamycin (`kanR`), and a counter-selectable marker, `sacB`. The `sacB` gene, originally from *Bacillus subtilis*, is lethal to *E. coli* in the presence of sucrose.\n\nThe recipient strain, Strain R, is an F− cell with the chromosomal genotype `$lacZ^{-}$` and `$str^{R}$` (resistant to streptomycin).\n\nThe goal of the experiment is to isolate a rare, stable `$lacZ^{+}$` derivative of Strain R. This requires two sequential events: first, the `$lacZ^{+}$` allele from the F'128 plasmid must replace the `$lacZ^{-}$` allele on the recipient's chromosome via homologous recombination. Second, the modified cell must subsequently lose the F'128 plasmid entirely.\n\nWhich of the following multi-step protocols describes the most effective positive selection strategy to isolate only these desired final cells?\n\nA.\n1.

Isolate colonies that grow on the lactose plate but fail to grow on the sucrose plate.", "solution": "The objective is to isolate a rare bacterial cell that has undergone two specific events: homologous recombination to integrate the `$lacZ^{+}$` allele into its chromosome, and subsequent loss of the F'128 plasmid.\n\nLet's define the genotypes of the key cells in this process:\n- **Donor (Strain D):** Chromosome: `$lacZ^{-} str^{S}` / Plasmid: F'128(`$lacZ^{+} `kanR` `sacB``)\n- **Recipient (Strain R):** Chromosome: `$lacZ^{-} str^{R}` / No Plasmid\n- **Desired Final Cell:** Chromosome: `$lacZ^{+} str^{R}` / No Plasmid\n\nWe need to evaluate each proposed protocol. The correct protocol must first select for cells that have successfully received the plasmid (transconjugants), then allow for the rare recombination and plasmid loss events to occur, and finally, positively select for the cells that have the desired final genotype.\n\n**Analysis of Protocol A:**\n\n**Step 1: Mix Strain D and Strain R and plate on minimal medium + kanamycin + streptomycin.**\nThis is the initial selection step after mating.\n- The medium contains streptomycin, which will kill the `$str^{S}$` donor cells (Strain D).\n- The medium contains kanamycin, which will kill the recipient cells (Strain R) as they lack the `kanR` gene.\n- Only recipient cells that have successfully received the F'128 plasmid from the donor will survive. These cells, known as transconjugants, are `$str^{R}$` from their chromosome and `$kan^{R}$` from the newly acquired plasmid.\n- The genotype of these selected transconjugants is: Chromosome: `$lacZ^{-} str^{R}` / Plasmid: F'128(`$lacZ^{+} `kanR` `sacB``).\n- This step successfully isolates the initial transconjugants.\n\n**Step 2: Grow the resulting colonies in non-selective rich broth.**\nThe transconjugant cells are grown in a nutrient-rich medium without any selective pressure (no antibiotics, no sucrose). This allows the bacterial population to grow for many generations. During this growth phase, rare events can occur and accumulate in the population:\n- **Homologous Recombination:** A double crossover event swaps the `$lacZ^{+}$` on the plasmid with the `$lacZ^{-}$` on the chromosome. This creates a cell with genotype: Chromosome(`$lacZ^{+} str^{R}`)/Plasmid(F'128(`$lacZ^{-} `kanR` `sacB``)).\n- **Plasmid Curing:** The F'128 plasmid is spontaneously lost during cell division. This can happen to either the original transconjugant or the recombinant cell.\nThis step is crucial for generating the desired rare cells.\n\n**Step 3: Plate the culture onto minimal medium + lactose + sucrose.**\nThis is the final positive selection step. Let's analyze the components of this medium.\n- **Minimal Medium with Lactose as sole carbon source:** To grow on this medium, a cell must be able to metabolize lactose, which requires a functional `$lacZ^{+}$` allele. This selects for cells that either have the `$lacZ^{+}$` on the plasmid or have recombined it into their chromosome.\n- **Sucrose:** The medium is supplemented with sucrose. Cells containing the F'128 plasmid also carry the `sacB` gene. The `sacB` gene product will convert sucrose into a lethal compound, killing the cell. Therefore, only cells that have lost the F'128 plasmid can survive in the presence of sucrose.\n\nCombining these two selective pressures: a cell must be `$lacZ^{+}$` **AND** must have lost the F'128 plasmid.\nLet's consider the possible cells in the culture from Step 2:\n1.  **Original Transconjugant:** Chromosome(`$lacZ^{-} str^{R}`)/Plasmid(`$lacZ^{+} `kanR` `sacB``). Phenotype: `$Lac^{+}$`, `$Kan^{R}$`, `$Suc^{S}$`. It will die due to sucrose.\n2.  **Recombinant with Plasmid:** Chromosome(`$lacZ^{+} str^{R}`)/Plasmid(`$lacZ^{-} `kanR` `sacB``). Phenotype: `$Lac^{+}$`, `$Kan^{R}$`, `$Suc^{S}$`. It will die due to sucrose.\n3.  **Cured, Non-recombinant:** Chromosome(`$lacZ^{-} str^{R}`). Phenotype: `$Lac^{-}$`, `$Kan^{S}$`, `$Suc^{R}$`. It cannot grow because it is `$lacZ^{-}$` and cannot use lactose.\n4.  **Desired Final Cell:** Chromosome(`$lacZ^{+} str^{R}`). Phenotype: `$Lac^{+}$`, `$Kan^{S}$`, `$Suc^{R}$`. It is `$lacZ^{+}$` from the recombination and can use lactose. It has lost the plasmid, so it is not killed by sucrose. This is the only cell type that will survive and form colonies.\n\nTherefore, Protocol A is a correct and effective positive selection strategy.\n\n**Analysis of other options:**\n\n- **Protocol B:** The initial selection on lactose + streptomycin is flawed; the `$lacZ^{+}$` donor strain would survive. The final selection on glucose + kanamycin selects for cells that are `$kan^{R}$` (have the plasmid) and doesn't test for the `$lacZ^{+}$` trait.\n- **Protocol C:** The final selection step uses lactose + kanamycin. This selects for cells that are `$lacZ^{+}$` and have kept the plasmid (`$kan^{R}$`). This isolates the recombinant cells that have not lost the plasmid, not the desired final product.\n- **Protocol D:** The initial selection on streptomycin alone is insufficient; it only kills the donor but allows the original recipient population to overgrow the transconjugants. The final selection on sucrose + kanamycin makes no sense, as it selects for cells that have lost the plasmid (`$Suc^{R}$`) but also kept it (`$kan^{R}$`), which is a contradiction.\n- **Protocol E:** This protocol describes a screening method (replica plating), not a positive selection strategy. In a positive selection, only the desired cells grow. In this screening method, undesired cells also grow on the master plate and one of the replica plates. While a valid laboratory technique, it does not fit the requirement of a \"positive selection strategy\".\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Protocol A is the only one that correctly combines selection and counter-selection to positively isolate the specific target cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1478877"}]}
