{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Transposable elements are broadly categorized into two major classes based on their mechanism of movement. Class I elements, or retrotransposons, use a \"copy-and-paste\" strategy involving an RNA intermediate, while Class II elements, or DNA transposons, typically move directly as DNA. This fundamental difference in their biochemical pathways provides a powerful way for researchers to distinguish them. This first exercise [@problem_id:1502181] challenges you to act like a molecular detective, using the outcome of an experiment with a specific enzyme inhibitor to deduce the class of an unknown mobile element.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the genetic underpinnings of a newly identified heritable cancer syndrome. Their analysis reveals that in patients with the syndrome, a critical tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated by the insertion of a previously unknown mobile genetic element. To understand the propagation mechanism of this element, the researchers establish a cell culture line from a patient's tumor tissue. They then treat these cells with a specific therapeutic compound known to be a potent Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI). The experiment's key result is that the presence of this NRTI completely halts any new insertion events of the mobile element within the host cell's genome.\n\nBased purely on this experimental observation, which of the following classifications most accurately describes this mobile genetic element?\n\nA. Retrotransposon\n\nB. DNA Transposon\n\nC. Episome\n\nD. Prion", "solution": "We begin by identifying the mechanistic implication of the experimental result. The compound used is a Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI). By definition, NRTIs are nucleoside analogs that inhibit reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that synthesizes DNA using an RNA template. They act primarily by being incorporated into nascent DNA and causing chain termination, thereby blocking reverse transcription.\n\nGiven observation: the presence of the NRTI completely halts new insertion events of the mobile element into the host genome. Therefore, for insertion to occur, the element’s life cycle must require reverse transcription. This implies that the mobile element moves through an RNA intermediate that must be converted back to DNA prior to integration into the genome.\n\nWe now classify mobile genetic elements based on whether they require reverse transcriptase:\n- Retrotransposons transpose via a “copy-and-paste” mechanism using an RNA intermediate. They encode or utilize reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA back into DNA, which then integrates into the genome. Because their transposition depends on reverse transcription, they are susceptible to inhibition by NRTIs. Hence, the observed blockade of insertion by an NRTI is diagnostic of a retrotransposon.\n- DNA transposons move via a “cut-and-paste” mechanism directly as DNA using a transposase. This process does not require reverse transcription, so NRTIs should not abolish their insertion events.\n- Episomes are extrachromosomal DNA elements (e.g., plasmids) that can sometimes integrate, but their maintenance and propagation do not classically depend on reverse transcription.\n- Prions are misfolded proteins lacking nucleic acids and do not integrate into genomes via reverse transcription.\n\nTherefore, the only classification consistent with insertion being completely halted by inhibition of reverse transcriptase is a retrotransposon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1502181"}, {"introduction": "Having distinguished between RNA-mediated and DNA-mediated transposition, we now zoom in on the fascinating diversity within DNA transposons themselves. These elements can mobilize through two distinct strategies: a conservative \"cut-and-paste\" mechanism where the element moves to a new location, or a replicative \"copy-and-paste\" mechanism where the original element remains in place while a new copy integrates elsewhere. In the following scenario [@problem_id:1502164], your task is to analyze the results of a classic genetics experiment to determine which of these two mechanisms is at play.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a mobile genetic element, the Tn3 transposon, in a bacterial system. The experiment begins with a strain of *Escherichia coli* whose chromosome is known to lack the Tn3 transposon. This bacterial strain is then transformed with a small, circular piece of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) called a plasmid, which carries a single copy of the Tn3 transposon. After allowing the bacteria to grow for several generations, the researcher isolates both the plasmids and the main bacterial chromosomes from the culture. Through DNA analysis, the researcher makes a key observation: the original population of plasmids still contains the Tn3 transposon, and a copy of the Tn3 transposon is now also found integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, which of the following biological mechanisms best describes the movement of the Tn3 transposon in this system?\n\nA. Replicative transposition\n\nB. Conservative transposition\n\nC. Retrotransposition\n\nD. Homologous recombination\n\nE. Conjugation", "solution": "We begin by restating the experimental setup and outcome. The bacterial chromosome initially lacks Tn3. A plasmid carrying a single copy of Tn3 is introduced into this bacterium. After growth, DNA analysis shows that the plasmid population still harbors Tn3 and, additionally, a copy of Tn3 is now integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nTo determine the mechanism, we compare the defining predictions of each listed process with the observations:\n\n1) Replicative transposition is a copy-and-paste mechanism of transposition. In replicative transposition, the transposable element is duplicated during the transposition event. Mechanistically, a donor with the transposon and a target DNA form a cointegrate intermediate mediated by the transposase. Resolution of the cointegrate (for Tn3, by a dedicated resolvase acting at the res site) yields one copy of the transposon remaining at the donor site and a second copy inserted at the target site. Prediction: after transposition, the donor molecule retains the element and the target acquires an additional copy. Observation: the plasmid still contains Tn3 and the chromosome has gained Tn3. This matches replicative transposition. Moreover, Tn3 is a canonical replicative transposon employing a transposase and resolvase, reinforcing this mechanism.\n\n2) Conservative transposition is a cut-and-paste mechanism. The transposable element is excised from the donor DNA and inserted into the target DNA without creating a duplicate. Prediction: the donor molecule loses the element at the original site. Observation: the plasmid population retains Tn3, which contradicts a single cut-and-paste event removing the only copy from the donor molecule. While plasmid replication could, in principle, complicate interpretations, the explicit observation that the original population of plasmids still contains Tn3 (i.e., the donor site is preserved) aligns with copy-and-paste, not cut-and-paste.\n\n3) Retrotransposition requires an RNA intermediate and a reverse transcriptase, typically characteristic of eukaryotic retrotransposons. Tn3 does not use an RNA intermediate and is not a retrotransposon. Prediction: not applicable to Tn3 in bacteria. Observation: inconsistent with retrotransposition.\n\n4) Homologous recombination requires substantial sequence homology between donor and recipient DNA segments to facilitate recombination. Transposon insertion does not require preexisting homology at the insertion site. Prediction: homologous recombination would not explain the acquisition of a transposon copy at a new chromosomal site while also retaining the original donor copy, unless flanking homologies existed and duplication occurred by a different pathway, which is not indicated here. Observation: consistent with transposition, not homologous recombination.\n\n5) Conjugation is cell-to-cell transfer of DNA through a pilus; it explains horizontal transfer between cells, not the intramolecular or intermolecular movement of a transposon within a single cell’s DNA molecules. Prediction: not a mechanism for the observed intragenomic movement. Observation: irrelevant to the described event.\n\nTherefore, the observation that the donor plasmid retains Tn3 while the chromosome gains a new copy is the signature of a copy-and-paste event, i.e., replicative transposition. Note: the prompt contains a minor typographical error in the string “Tn't'ransposon,” which we interpret as “Tn3 transposon”; this does not affect the biological reasoning or conclusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1502164"}, {"introduction": "The movement of transposable elements can have profound consequences for the host genome, often acting as a major source of mutation. The process is not always perfect; when a DNA transposon excises from a gene, the cellular machinery that repairs the break can be imprecise, sometimes leaving behind a small DNA sequence known as a \"footprint\". This final practice [@problem_id:1502209] explores the functional impact of such an event, requiring you to bridge your understanding of transposition with core principles of gene expression and the genetic code to predict the fate of a protein.", "problem": "In a study of maize genetics, a wild-type allele of a gene, `GluS`, is responsible for producing a functional enzyme called Glucuronidase-S. The 5' end of the `GluS` gene's coding DNA strand begins with the sequence:\n\n`5'-ATG GCT TAC CGA GTC AAC TGG...-3'`\n\nA plant homozygous for this wild-type `GluS` allele exhibits the expected enzymatic activity. A spontaneous mutation occurs, resulting in a null allele, `glus-m1`, where a Dissociation (*Ds*) transposable element has inserted itself into the sixth codon of the `GluS` gene. This insertion disrupts the gene's reading frame and leads to a complete loss of enzyme function.\n\nLater, in the presence of an active Transposase enzyme produced by an Activator (*Ac*) element, the *Ds* element from the `glus-m1` allele excises from the gene, creating a new revertant allele called `GluS-rev`. However, the excision is imprecise. The repair process leaves behind an 8-base-pair \"footprint\" of foreign DNA at the exact site of the original insertion. The sequence of this 8-bp footprint is `5'-TTCAGGAC-3'`.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the protein product of the `GluS-rev` allele?\n\n**Genetic Code Table (RNA Codons):**\n- **A:** Ala (GCN), Arg (CGN, AGA, AGG)\n- **C:** Cys (UGU, UGC)\n- **D:** Asp (GAU, GAC)\n- **E:** Glu (GAA, GAG)\n- **F:** Phe (UUU, UUC)\n- **G:** Gly (GGN)\n- **H:** His (CAU, CAC)\n- **I:** Ile (AUU, AUC, AUA)\n- **K:** Lys (AAA, AAG)\n- **L:** Leu (UUA, UUG, CUN)\n- **M:** Met (AUG)\n- **N:** Asn (AAU, AAC)\n- **P:** Pro (CCN)\n- **Q:** Gln (CAA, CAG)\n- **R:** Arg (see A)\n- **S:** Ser (UCN, AGU, AGC)\n- **T:** Thr (ACN)\n- **V:** Val (GUN)\n- **W:** Trp (UGG)\n- **Y:** Tyr (UAU, UAC)\n- **Stop:** UAA, UAG, UGA\n(where N = any base A, U, C, or G)\n\nA.

The GluS-rev protein will contain an insertion of two or three amino acids but will likely retain most of its original function.\n\nC. The GluS-rev protein will be produced, but its amino acid sequence will be completely different from the wild-type sequence starting from the point of the footprint, leading to a loss of function.\n\nD. The gene will fail to be transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) because the footprint damages the promoter region.\n\nE. The excision event perfectly restores the original DNA sequence, but epigenetic modifications silence the gene permanently.", "solution": "The provided coding DNA sequence for the wild-type allele is 5'-ATG GCT TAC CGA GTC AAC TGG...-3'. Translating in-frame from the start codon, the codons are:\n1: ATG (Met), 2: GCT (Ala), 3: TAC (Tyr), 4: CGA (Arg), 5: GTC (Val), 6: AAC (Asn), 7: TGG (Trp), etc. Thus, the sixth codon is AAC.\n\nIn the null allele glus-m1, a Ds element inserted into the sixth codon, disrupting the reading frame and abolishing function. Upon excision mediated by Ac transposase, the revertant GluS-rev is formed, but an 8-base-pair footprint, 5'-TTCAGGAC-3', remains at the exact site of the original insertion. This footprint is an insertion within the coding region, specifically within the sixth codon.\n\nTranslation proceeds in triplets. Any insertion whose length is not a multiple of 3 causes a frameshift at the insertion point. Here, the net change is an insertion of 8 bp, and $8 \\bmod 3 = 2$, which is not zero. Therefore, the reading frame is shifted starting at the footprint. As a result, the N-terminus up to part of the sixth codon remains as in the wild type, but from the footprint onward, the amino acid sequence will differ from the wild type due to the altered reading frame. In the new frame, a premature stop codon is typically encountered soon downstream, producing a truncated and nonfunctional protein.\n\nThis rules out identity with wild type (A), a small in-frame insertion (B), promoter damage preventing transcription (D), and a perfect excision with epigenetic silencing (E). The correct description is that the protein will be produced but, from the footprint onward, its sequence will be different from the wild type due to a frameshift, causing loss of function.\n\nTherefore, option C best describes the protein product of the GluS-rev allele.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1502209"}]}
