By analyzing the interaction between a wild-type allele and a dominant 'super-repressor' allele, you will practice applying the concepts of trans-acting factors and their impact on gene expression across different DNA molecules within the same cell [@problem_id:1470924].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic system for studying gene regulation. Its components are encoded by distinct genetic loci: the gene for the repressor protein (*I*), the promoter site (*P*), the operator site (*O*), and the structural gene for the enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase (*Z*).\n\nA geneticist constructs a special strain of *E. coli* that is a partial diploid, also known as a merodiploid. This strain contains its own chromosome and an F' plasmid, which is a small circular piece of DNA carrying a second copy of the *lac* operon region. The genotype of this merodiploid strain is $I^s P^+ O^+ Z^+ / I^+ P^+ O^+ Z^+$.\n\nThe alleles are defined as follows:\n- $I^+$: Encodes a wild-type repressor protein that is responsive to an inducer.\n- $I^s$: Encodes a \"super-repressor\" protein that cannot bind to the inducer and thus remains perpetually active.\n- $P^+$: A functional promoter sequence that allows RNA polymerase to bind.\n- $O^+$: A functional operator sequence to which the repressor protein can bind.\n- $Z^+$: Encodes a functional $\\beta$-galactosidase enzyme.\n\nPredict the expression pattern of $\\beta$-galactosidase in this merodiploid strain.\n\nA.

The strain will not produce $\\beta$-galactosidase under either condition (uninducible expression).\n\nD. The strain will produce $\\beta$-galactosidase only in the absence of the inducer.", "solution": "We use the standard regulatory model of the lac operon: a repressor encoded by $I$ acts in trans by diffusing and binding the operator $O$ to block RNA polymerase at $P$, thereby preventing transcription of structural genes such as $Z$. An inducer binds the wild-type repressor $I^{+}$ to inactivate it, allowing transcription. The $I^{s}$ allele encodes a super-repressor that binds $O$ but cannot bind the inducer; thus it remains repressive under all conditions. Operator ($O$) and promoter ($P$) elements act in cis; the repressor acts in trans.\n\nGiven the merodiploid genotype $I^{s} P^{+} O^{+} Z^{+} / I^{+} P^{+} O^{+} Z^{+}$:\n- Both copies have $P^{+}$ and $O^{+}$, so they are capable of regulation via repressor binding.\n- One copy produces $I^{s}$ repressor; the other produces $I^{+}$ repressor. Because the repressor protein is diffusible, the $I^{s}$ product acts in trans and can bind the $O^{+}$ site on either operon.\n- In the absence of inducer, both $I^{+}$ and $I^{s}$ repressors bind $O^{+}$ and block transcription of $Z$ on both copies.\n- In the presence of inducer, the $I^{+}$ repressor is inactivated by inducer binding, but the $I^{s}$ repressor cannot be inactivated and continues to bind $O^{+}$, preventing transcription on both copies.\n- There is no $O^{c}$ (operator-constitutive) mutation to prevent repressor binding in cis, and no defective $P$ allele preventing polymerase binding; thus repression by $I^{s}$ is effective on both operons under all conditions.\n\nTherefore, $\\beta$-galactosidase ($Z^{+}$) is not expressed in either the absence or presence of inducer (uninducible).

High-frequency recombination (Hfr) conjugation offers a way to map gene locations on a bacterial chromosome by exploiting the timed, linear transfer of DNA. This problem asks you to analyze the results of a hypothetical Hfr mating experiment, connecting the theoretical principles of gene transfer to a quantitative outcome and reinforcing why the full donor status is rarely co-transferred with distant genes [@problem_id:1470893].", "problem": "In a bacterial genetics experiment, a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) strain of *E. coli* is mated with an F- recipient strain. The Hfr strain is prototrophic for all required nutrients and sensitive to the antibiotic streptomycin ($Str^s$). Its chromosome transfers genes in a specific linear sequence, starting from an origin of transfer, `oriT`. For this particular Hfr strain, the gene order is `oriT`...*leu*...*trp*...*his*...`F-factor`. The F-factor, which contains the genes for donor ability, is the terminal segment to be transferred. The F- recipient strain is auxotrophic for leucine, tryptophan, and histidine ($leu^-$, $trp^-$, $his^-$) and is resistant to streptomycin ($Str^r$).\n\nThe two strains are mixed and allowed to conjugate for 120 minutes. After this incubation, the Hfr donor cells are selectively killed by adding streptomycin to the culture. The remaining cells, which are potential recombinants, are then plated on a minimal medium containing streptomycin and supplemented with leucine and tryptophan, but lacking histidine. This selective plating strategy ensures that only recipient cells that have incorporated the $his^+$ gene and are resistant to streptomycin ($Str^r\\ his^+$) can form colonies.\n\nFrom this procedure, a total of 625 $Str^r\\ his^+$ recombinant colonies were counted. To determine the frequency of donor conversion, a sample of these 625 colonies was then individually tested for fertility by checking their ability to transfer genetic material to a new F- strain. This detailed analysis revealed that only 4 of these $Str^r\\ his^+$ colonies had successfully received the F-factor and were converted into donor cells.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the probability that a recipient cell that has successfully integrated the $his^+$ gene marker also becomes a donor cell. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are asked for the probability that a recipient cell which has successfully integrated the $his^{+}$ marker also becomes a donor (i.e., received the F-factor). The experimental selection ensures that only recipient-derived $Str^{r} his^{+}$ recombinants form colonies.
