{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Specific transcription factors are elegant molecular machines, often built from distinct functional modules. A fundamental concept in gene regulation is the separation of duties between the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which locates the correct address on the genome, and the activation domain (AD), which recruits the machinery to initiate transcription. This exercise, [@problem_id:1492220], explores the critical consequences of disrupting this partnership, challenging you to predict the outcome when a transcription factor can bind to its target but can no longer activate it.", "problem": "In a hypothetical eukaryotic organism, the transcription of a gene called `Glyco-Regulator` ($GR$) is tightly controlled. Under normal conditions, in the presence of the sugar molecule trehalose, a specific activator protein known as Trehalose Response Factor 1 (TRF1) binds to a DNA sequence called the Trehalose Response Element (TRE), which functions as an enhancer for the $GR$ gene. TRF1 is a modular protein with two key functional parts: a DNA-binding domain that recognizes the TRE sequence and an activation domain that interacts with the general transcription machinery to recruit RNA Polymerase II and initiate transcription.\n\nA researcher discovers a mutant strain of this organism. In this strain, a mutation has occurred in the gene encoding the TRF1 protein. The resulting mutant protein, `TRF1_mut`, has a perfectly functional DNA-binding domain but completely lacks its activation domain. Assume that the cell only produces this `TRF1_mut` protein and no functional TRF1 protein is present.\n\nWhat is the most likely effect on the transcription of the $GR$ gene in these mutant cells when trehalose is present?\n\nA. Transcription of the $GR$ gene will be significantly reduced to basal or near-basal levels, because the mutant protein occupies the enhancer but cannot recruit the transcription machinery.\n\nB. Transcription of the $GR$ gene will proceed at its normal, fully activated rate, as the binding of the protein to the enhancer is the only event necessary for activation.\n\nC. The `TRF1_mut` protein will be unable to bind to the TRE enhancer, leaving the $GR$ gene's transcription at its uninduced, basal level.\n\nD. Transcription of the $GR$ gene will be intermediate, approximately half of the fully activated rate, since one of the two protein domains is still functional.", "solution": "We identify the key regulatory elements and their functions. The TRE is an enhancer for the gene $GR$. The activator TRF1 is modular with two functional domains: (i) a DNA-binding domain that specifically recognizes and binds the TRE; (ii) an activation domain that interacts with coactivators (such as Mediator) and the general transcription machinery to facilitate recruitment and stabilization of RNA Polymerase II at the promoter, thereby increasing transcription above basal levels in response to trehalose.\n\nWe analyze the mutant scenario. The mutant protein TRF1_mut retains an intact DNA-binding domain but completely lacks the activation domain. By construction, the cell produces only TRF1_mut and no wild-type TRF1. In the presence of trehalose, TRF1_mut will still bind the TRE due to its functional DNA-binding domain. However, without the activation domain, TRF1_mut cannot perform the essential coactivator interactions required to recruit or stabilize the preinitiation complex and RNA Polymerase II at the promoter.\n\nWe infer the transcriptional consequence. Since the enhancer is occupied by a DNA-bound protein that lacks activation capacity, the enhancer cannot transmit an activating signal to the transcription machinery. Moreover, TRF1_mut binding to TRE blocks access by any potential functional activator (even hypothetical), and there is explicitly no wild-type TRF1 present. Therefore, the enhancer is effectively silenced by dominant-negative occupancy. The expected transcriptional output of $GR$ remains at basal or near-basal levels, driven only by the core promoter and general transcription factors in the absence of enhancer-mediated activation.\n\nWe evaluate the options. Option B is incorrect because mere DNA binding without an activation domain is insufficient for activation. Option C is incorrect because the DNA-binding domain is intact, so binding occurs. Option D is incorrect because there is no mechanistic basis for intermediate activation; the activation domain is necessary for enhancer function. Option A correctly states that transcription is reduced to basal or near-basal levels because the mutant occupies the enhancer but cannot recruit the transcription machinery.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect is as described in A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1492220"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond a simple \"on/off\" view, modern biology recognizes that gene expression is often stochastic, occurring in bursts. This exercise, [@problem_id:1492176], introduces a quantitative model that connects the molecular properties of a transcription factor to the dynamics of transcriptional bursting. By analyzing how mutations in the DNA-binding and activation domains separately affect burst frequency and burst size, you will gain a deeper, more dynamic understanding of how these domains control the timing and output of gene expression.", "problem": "In eukaryotic gene regulation, transcription often occurs in stochastic bursts. A simplified biophysical model describes this phenomenon by considering a gene's promoter to switch between an \"OFF\" state and an \"ON\" state. The binding of a specific transcription factor (TF) to a regulatory element controls this switching.\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical TF that promotes the expression of a target gene. This TF has a DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) and an Activation Domain (AD). The dynamics of transcription can be described by the following parameters:\n- The rate of the promoter switching from OFF to ON is given by $k_{on} = k_{a} [\\text{TF}]$, where $k_{a}$ is the association rate constant of the TF to its DNA target site and $[\\text{TF}]$ is the concentration of the active TF.\n- The rate of the promoter switching from ON back to OFF is given by $k_{off} = k_d$, where $k_d$ is the dissociation rate constant of the TF from its DNA target site.\n- While in the ON state, transcripts are synthesized at a constant rate $k_{tx}$.\n\nFrom this model, two key properties of transcriptional bursting can be defined:\n1.  **Burst Frequency ($f$)**: The rate at which transcriptional bursts are initiated, which corresponds to the rate of the promoter switching from the OFF to the ON state. Thus, $f = k_{on}$.\n2.  **Burst Size ($B$)**: The average number of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules produced during a single ON event. This is the product of the transcription rate and the average duration of the ON state. Thus, $B = k_{tx} / k_{off}$.\n\nYou are studying two different mutant versions of this TF, comparing them to the wild-type (WT) version. All experiments are conducted under conditions where $[\\text{TF}]$ is constant.\n\n-   **Wild-Type (WT)**: The TF has rate constants $k_{a,WT}$, $k_{d,WT}$, and $k_{tx,WT}$. Its bursting dynamics are characterized by frequency $f_{WT}$ and size $B_{WT}$.\n-   **Mutant 1 ($M_{DBD}$)**: This mutant has a single amino acid substitution in its DNA-Binding Domain (DBD). This change weakens its interaction with DNA, causing its association rate constant to decrease by a factor of 4 and its dissociation rate constant to increase by a factor of 2, compared to WT.\n-   **Mutant 2 ($M_{AD}$)**: This mutant has a mutation in its Activation Domain (AD). This change impairs its ability to recruit the transcription machinery, reducing the rate of transcript synthesis by a factor of 5, compared to WT.\n\nLet the burst frequency and size for the mutants be denoted as $f_{DBD}$, $B_{DBD}$, $f_{AD}$, and $B_{AD}$.
