This strain is a partial diploid (merozygote), containing a copy of the bacterial chromosome and an F' plasmid which carries a segment of the *lac* operon. The complete genotype of this strain with respect to the *lac* operon is given as:\n\nchromosome: $\\text{lacI}^+ \\text{lacP}^+ \\text{lacO}^+ \\text{lacZ}^-$ / F' plasmid: $\\text{lacI}^- \\text{lacP}^+ \\text{lacO}^+ \\text{lacZ}^+$\n\nHere, the symbols represent the following genetic elements:\n- *lacI*: The gene encoding the lac repressor protein.

Functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is not produced under any condition because both DNA molecules have a defective component.\n\nB.

Functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced inducibly, meaning its synthesis occurs only when lactose is added to the growth medium.\n\nD. The system is uninducible; no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced even in the presence of lactose because the functional repressor permanently shuts down the system.", "solution": "We analyze regulation of the lac operon in a merozygote by applying the principles that *lacI* encodes a diffusible, trans-acting repressor, while *lacP* and *lacO* act in cis on their linked structural genes. A functional *lacI* allele ($\\text{lacI}^+$) produces repressor that can diffuse in the cytoplasm and bind to any functional operator ($\\text{lacO}^+$) regardless of which DNA molecule carries it. The operator and promoter are cis-regulatory sites; here all are wild type ($\\text{lacP}^+$, $\\text{lacO}^+$), so both operons are responsive to the repressor and to inducer.\n\nGiven the genotype:\n- Chromosome: $\\text{lacI}^+ \\text{lacP}^+ \\text{lacO}^+ \\text{lacZ}^-$,\n- F' plasmid: $\\text{lacI}^- \\text{lacP}^+ \\text{lacO}^+ \\text{lacZ}^+$,\n\nStep 1: Determine repressor status. The chromosome has $\\text{lacI}^+$, producing functional repressor. The F' plasmid has $\\text{lacI}^-$, which does not produce functional repressor. Because *lacI* is trans-acting, the functional repressor from the chromosome will regulate both the chromosomal and plasmid operons by binding their $\\text{lacO}^+$ sites.\n\nStep 2: Behavior in absence of inducer (no lactose). Functional LacI repressor binds to $\\text{lacO}^+$ on both operons and prevents RNA polymerase action at $\\text{lacP}^+$, thereby repressing transcription of lacZYA. Thus, the plasmid $\\text{lacZ}^+$ is not expressed, and the chromosome $\\text{lacZ}^-$ cannot make functional enzyme regardless.\n\nStep 3: Behavior in presence of inducer (lactose, via allolactose). Inducer binds to the functional LacI repressor, reducing its affinity for $\\text{lacO}^+$; the repressor dissociates, and RNA polymerase can initiate transcription at both $\\text{lacP}^+$ promoters. The chromosomal operon produces a nonfunctional LacZ due to $\\text{lacZ}^-$, but the plasmid operon produces functional $\\beta$-galactosidase from $\\text{lacZ}^+$. Therefore, functional enzyme is produced only when inducer is present.\n\nStep 4: Exclude incorrect options.\n- A is incorrect because the plasmid carries $\\text{lacZ}^+$, and regulation is intact; functional enzyme can be made upon induction.\n- B is incorrect because the presence of a functional trans-acting $\\text{lacI}^+$ prevents constitutive expression; repression occurs without inducer.\n- D is incorrect because the functional repressor is inducible and does not permanently shut down expression; inducer alleviates repression.\n\nTherefore, functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced inducibly in this strain, only when lactose is present.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335670"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of *trans*-acting factors, we now investigate elements that work differently. This problem presents another merozygote, this time containing a mutation in a regulatory DNA sequenceâ€”the operator. This practice is designed to illustrate the nature of *cis*-acting elements, which only influence the expression of genes located immediately adjacent on the same DNA strand, providing a crucial contrast to the diffusible proteins we examined earlier.

The operon consists of several components: the repressor gene (*lacI*), the promoter (*P*), the operator (*lacO*), and three structural genes, *lacZ*, *lacY*, and *lacA*.\n\nThe function of these components is as follows:\n- *lacI* (*I*): This gene encodes the *lac* repressor protein. The wild-type allele, $I^+$, produces a functional repressor that can bind to the operator.\n- *lacO* (*O*): This is a DNA sequence that acts as the binding site for the repressor protein. The wild-type operator, $O^+$, can be bound by the repressor. A constitutive mutant operator, $O^c$, has a sequence change that prevents the repressor from binding to it. The operator is a *cis*-acting element, meaning it only affects the transcription of genes on the same DNA strand.\n- *lacZ* (*Z*): This gene encodes the enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase. The wild-type allele, $Z^+$, produces a functional enzyme.\n- *lacY* (*Y*): This gene encodes the enzyme lactose permease. The wild-type allele, $Y^+$, produces a functional enzyme.\n\nThrough bacterial conjugation, it is possible to create a partial diploid cell, also known as a merozygote, which contains the bacterial chromosome and a separate piece of DNA called an F' plasmid.\n\nConsider a merozygote with the following genotype:\n$I^+ O^+ Z^+ Y^- / I^+ O^c Z^- Y^+$\n\nWhich of the following describes the synthesis of functional enzymes in this cell when it is grown in a medium that **lacks** lactose (the inducer)?\n\nA.

In the absence of inducer (lactose), the repressor binds to $O^{+}$ and blocks transcription.\n- $O$ is a cis-acting DNA site. The mutant $O^{c}$ cannot bind the repressor, so the structural genes downstream on the same DNA are transcribed constitutively regardless of the presence of repressor.\n\nIn the merozygote $I^+ O^+ Z^+ Y^- / I^+ O^c Z^- Y^+$ grown without lactose, the repressor made from either $I^+$ allele is active and will bind to any $O^+$ operator, repressing transcription from that operon. Thus, on the $I^+ O^+ Z^+ Y^-$ chromosome, $O^+$ is occupied by repressor, so *Z* and *Y* are not transcribed; therefore, no $\\beta$-galactosidase or permease is produced from this copy (and even if transcribed, $Y^-$ cannot produce functional permease).\n\nOn the $I^+ O^c Z^- Y^+$ F' plasmid, $O^c$ cannot bind the repressor, so transcription is constitutive. This yields expression of $Z^-$ (nonfunctional $\\beta$-galactosidase) and $Y^+$ (functional permease).

Its expression is controlled by two key factors: the availability of lactose and the availability of glucose. In a wild-type cell, the system operates as follows:\n\n1.  A repressor protein, encoded by the *lacI* gene, binds to a region called the operator in the absence of lactose's metabolite, allolactose. This binding blocks transcription of the operon's structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*). When lactose is present, allolactose binds to the repressor, inactivating it and allowing transcription to proceed. This is a form of negative control.\n2.  A protein called the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) enhances transcription when glucose is scarce. Low glucose levels lead to high intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP-CAP complex binds to a site near the promoter, greatly increasing the promoter's affinity for RNA polymerase, leading to high-level transcription. When glucose is abundant, cAMP levels are low, CAP is inactive, and transcription occurs only at a low, basal level (assuming the repressor is also inactive). This is a form of positive control.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a specific mutation in the gene encoding CAP. This mutated CAP protein binds constitutively to its DNA binding site near the *lac* promoter, meaning its ability to bind is completely independent of the intracellular concentration of cAMP.\n\nFor this mutant strain, predict the expression level of the *lac* structural genes.

Glucose present, Lactose absent: repressor active and bound; CAP active but repression dominates operator occlusion. Expression is Off.\n2.
