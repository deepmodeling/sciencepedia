The *lac* operon is a classic model for this interplay, controlled by both a repressor (LacI) that stops transcription and an activator (CAP) that enhances it. This first exercise [@problem_id:1473438] challenges you to untangle these two systems by predicting the behavior of mutants lacking either the repressor or the activator, providing a clear picture of how positive and negative control work together to fine-tune gene expression.", "problem": "The *lac* operon in *Escherichia coli* is a canonical system for studying gene regulation. It comprises a set of genes required for lactose metabolism, including `lacZ`, which encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase. The expression of this operon is tightly controlled by the availability of sugars in the environment.\n\nTwo key regulatory genes are involved:\n1.  The `lacI` gene, which is located outside the operon, codes for the LacI repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, the LacI protein binds to a region of the operon called the operator, physically blocking transcription. When lactose is present, it is converted to allolactose, which binds to the LacI protein and prevents it from binding to the operator.\n2.  The `crp` gene codes for the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). This protein acts as an activator. When glucose levels in the cell are low, CAP binds to a signaling molecule and then to a site near the operon's promoter, significantly enhancing the rate of transcription. When glucose levels are high, CAP remains inactive and does not bind to the DNA.\n\nConsider two different mutant strains of *E. coli*:\n-   **Strain 1:** A `crp-` mutant, which has a loss-of-function mutation in the `crp` gene and cannot produce a functional CAP protein.\n-   **Strain 2:** A `lacI-` mutant, which has a loss-of-function mutation in the `lacI` gene and cannot produce a functional LacI repressor protein.\n\nFor each mutant, predict the level of β-galactosidase expression when grown in four different media.

When lactose is present, it is converted to allolactose, which inactivates LacI so the repressor does not bind.\n- The CAP activator enhances transcription only when glucose is low; this requires functional CRP (the product of the crp gene). When glucose is high, CAP is inactive and does not enhance transcription.\n- Therefore:\n  - If the repressor is bound (no lactose and functional LacI), expression is None.\n  - If the repressor is not bound but CAP is inactive (high glucose or no functional CRP), expression is Basal.\n  - If the repressor is not bound and CAP is active (low glucose and functional CRP), expression is High.\n\nApply this to each mutant.\n\nStrain 1: crp- (loss of functional CAP)\n- CAP activation cannot occur regardless of glucose. Thus High expression is impossible.\n- If lactose is absent, the repressor binds and expression is None.\n- If lactose is present, the repressor is off, but without CAP activation the expression is Basal.\n- Hence:\n  - + Glucose, - Lactose: None\n  - + Glucose, + Lactose: Basal\n  - - Glucose, - Lactose: None\n  - - Glucose, + Lactose: Basal\n\nStrain 2: lacI- (loss of functional repressor)\n- The repressor is never bound regardless of lactose, so repression is absent in all conditions.\n- Expression level depends only on CAP:\n  - With high glucose, CAP is inactive, giving Basal expression.\n  - With low glucose, CAP is active (assuming CRP is functional), giving High expression.\n- Lactose presence is irrelevant in this mutant.\n- Hence:\n  - + Glucose, - Lactose: Basal\n  - + Glucose, + Lactose: Basal\n  - - Glucose, - Lactose: High\n  - - Glucose, + Lactose: High\n\nComparing these predictions with the options, only option A matches both strains across all conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473438"}, {"introduction": "The activity of regulatory proteins like CAP is often controlled by small signaling molecules that reflect the cell's internal state. For catabolite repression, this messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). This problem [@problem_id:1473490] presents a thought experiment where a cell unable to produce its own cAMP is 'rescued' by supplying it externally, allowing you to isolate and confirm the specific role of this molecule in the activation pathway.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the `lac` operon is a classic example of gene regulation. Its expression is controlled by two main factors: the presence of lactose and the absence of glucose. The effect of glucose is mediated by a mechanism called catabolite repression. When glucose levels are low, the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) rises. This cAMP molecule binds to the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP), forming a CAP-cAMP complex that acts as a transcriptional activator for the `lac` operon. The enzyme responsible for synthesizing cAMP is adenylate cyclase, which is encoded by the `cyaA` gene.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has a non-functional `cyaA` gene (genotype `cyaA-`). This strain is placed in a growth medium where lactose is the only available carbon source. After a period of growth, a high concentration of cAMP is artificially added to the medium, and it is readily taken up by the cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the level of transcription of the `lac` operon immediately after the addition of cAMP?\n\nA. Transcription will be high because the added cAMP compensates for the `cyaA` mutation, allowing the CAP-cAMP complex to form and activate the operon.\n\nB. Transcription will remain at a very low basal level because the presence of lactose is insufficient for activation without a functional adenylate cyclase enzyme.\n\nC. Transcription will be repressed because high levels of cAMP mimic the presence of glucose, leading to catabolite repression.\n\nD. Transcription will not occur because the `lac` repressor protein will remain bound to the operator, and the presence of cAMP does not affect the repressor.", "solution": "The regulatory logic of the lac operon requires two conditions for high transcription: (i) the LacI repressor must be inactivated by the inducer (allolactose, derived from lactose), which removes the repressor from the operator; and (ii) the CAP activator must be in its active form, which requires binding to cyclic AMP. Under low glucose, intracellular cyclic AMP is normally synthesized by adenylate cyclase, encoded by the cyaA gene. In a cyaA- mutant, endogenous cAMP synthesis is impaired, so even in the presence of lactose, activation by CAP is absent unless cAMP is provided exogenously.\n\nIn the scenario described, lactose is the only carbon source, so the inducer is present and the LacI repressor is not bound to the operator, removing repression. Upon the artificial addition and uptake of cAMP, the cAMP binds CAP to form the CAP–cAMP complex, which binds the CAP site upstream of the lac promoter and recruits RNA polymerase, strongly increasing transcription. Thus, exogenous cAMP functionally bypasses the requirement for adenylate cyclase and restores positive control.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that added cAMP compensates for the cyaA mutation, allowing CAP–cAMP to activate transcription to a high level in the presence of lactose.\n- B is incorrect because a functional adenylate cyclase enzyme is not required if cAMP is supplied and taken up; lactose alone removes repression, but activation requires cAMP, which is now provided.\n- C is incorrect because catabolite repression correlates with low cAMP (high glucose), not high cAMP; high cAMP signals low glucose and supports activation.\n- D is incorrect because in the presence of lactose, the repressor does not remain bound; cAMP affects activation, not repressor binding.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that transcription will be high immediately after cAMP addition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473490"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a biological process allows scientists to design powerful experiments.

To facilitate their research, they are using MacConkey agar, a special type of differential growth medium. On MacConkey agar, colonies of bacteria that are actively fermenting lactose produce acidic byproducts, which cause the pH indicator in the medium to turn red. Consequently, lactose-fermenting colonies appear red. Bacteria that do not ferment lactose form pale or colorless colonies.\n\nThe microbiologist has a large population of *E. coli* that has been exposed to a mutagen to induce a wide variety of random mutations. The primary goal is to isolate rare mutants that are specifically defective in catabolite repression. A defect in catabolite repression means that the mutant bacteria will express the *lac* operon genes (and thus ferment lactose) even when glucose, the preferred sugar, is present in the environment.\n\nWhich of the following experimental strategies provides the most direct and effective single-step method for screening and identifying these specific catabolite repression mutants from the mutagenized population?\n\nA.

Plate the mutagenized culture on MacConkey agar containing both glucose and lactose. Select the red colonies that grow.\n\nE. Plate the mutagenized culture on a minimal medium agar containing lactose as the sole carbon source. Select any colonies that fail to grow.", "solution": "Catabolite repression in Escherichia coli operates via low intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the presence of glucose, preventing cAMP–CAP activation of the lac operon. Therefore, in wild-type cells when glucose is present, lac operon expression is repressed even if lactose is available, so lactose is not fermented.\n\nMacConkey agar differentiates lactose fermenters (red colonies due to acidification) from non-fermenters (pale/colorless). To directly screen for mutants defective in catabolite repression, the selective condition must include glucose to invoke repression in wild-type cells, and lactose to reveal fermentation by mutants that inappropriately express the lac operon despite glucose.\n\nUnder these conditions:\n- Wild-type cells on MacConkey agar with both glucose and lactose will be pale/colorless because they do not ferment lactose due to catabolite repression.\n- Mutants defective in catabolite repression will ferment lactose even in the presence of glucose and thus form red colonies.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA. Lactose only selects for general lactose-fermenters, including wild-type; not specific for catabolite repression defects.\nB. Glucose and lactose selecting pale colonies enriches wild-type and lac-defective mutants; this is the opposite of the goal.\nC. Glucose only does not test lactose fermentation via the lac operon on MacConkey agar; not informative for the desired phenotype.\nD. Glucose and lactose selecting red colonies directly enriches mutants that ferment lactose despite glucose; this is the most direct single-step screen.\nE. Minimal medium with lactose selecting non-growers isolates lac- mutants, not catabolite repression mutants.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective single-step screening strategy is to plate on MacConkey agar containing both glucose and lactose and select red colonies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1473436"}]}
