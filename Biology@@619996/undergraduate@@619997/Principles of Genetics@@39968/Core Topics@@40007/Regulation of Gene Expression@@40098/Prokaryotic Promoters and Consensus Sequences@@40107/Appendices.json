The spacer between these two boxes most commonly consists of 17 to 19 base pairs.\n\nBy identifying the -10 box of this synthetic promoter on the coding strand, determine the corresponding sequence of the -10 box on the template strand, written in the 5' to 3' direction.", "solution": "The given DNA sequence is the 5' to 3' coding (non-transcribed) strand:\n5'-AGCTTGCATTGTCACGATATTGCAGGTCAATTACAATGCTAGCTC-3'.\n\nIn Escherichia coli, promoters have a -35 box near the consensus 5'-TTGACA-3' and a -10 box near the consensus 5'-TATAAT-3', with a spacer of 17 to 19 base pairs between the two boxes. To identify the -10 box on the coding strand, first locate a plausible -35-like hexamer and then check for a -10-like hexamer 17 to 19 bases downstream.\n\nScanning the coding strand for a -35-like sequence, the hexamer at positions 9 to 14 (counting from the 5' end of the coding strand) is:\npositions 9–14: TTGTCA,\nwhich differs from the consensus 5'-TTGACA-3' by a single base and is therefore a reasonable -35 candidate.\n\nWith a spacer of 17 bases, the first base of the -10 box would be at position $14+17+1=32$.

This final problem explores the critical importance of the spacer DNA that separates the $-35$ and $-10$ boxes. Through a thought experiment comparing different mutations, you will discover how the helical structure of DNA imposes strict spatial constraints on protein binding, revealing a deeper layer of elegance in the architecture of gene control [@problem_id:1514220].", "problem": "In prokaryotic genetics, the promoter is a crucial DNA sequence that initiates transcription of a gene. A typical prokaryotic promoter contains two short consensus sequences, the -35 box (consensus: 5'-TTGACA-3') and the -10 box (or Pribnow box, consensus: 5'-TATAAT-3'), which are recognized by the sigma ($\\sigma$) factor subunit of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. These two boxes are separated by a \"spacer\" region. For most strong promoters in *E. coli*, the optimal length of this spacer is 17 base pairs (bp). Assume the DNA double helix completes one full turn approximately every 10.5 bp.\n\nA molecular biology student is studying the expression of a gene `xenC` in a newly discovered bacterium. The `xenC` gene has a promoter with an optimal 17 bp spacer. The student creates two different mutations in the promoter region to study their effects on `xenC` transcription:\n\n*   **Mutation 1 (M1):** An insertion of 3 bp into the middle of the spacer region, changing its length to 20 bp.\n*   **Mutation 2 (M2):** Three different single base-pair substitutions are made at various positions within the 17 bp spacer region, leaving its length unchanged.\n\nExperimental results show that Mutation 1 almost completely abolishes transcription of the `xenC` gene, while Mutation 2 has only a minor effect on the transcription rate.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The specific nucleotide sequence of the spacer region is critical for direct binding of the sigma factor, and the three substitutions in M2 coincidentally created a weaker, but still functional, binding sequence.\n\nB. The 3 bp insertion in M1 rotationally misaligns the -35 and -10 boxes on opposite faces of the DNA helix, preventing the sigma factor from binding to both sites simultaneously, whereas the M2 substitutions do not affect this alignment.\n\nC. The insertion of 3 bp in M1 significantly destabilizes the local DNA double helix, preventing the initial strand separation (melting) required for transcription, an effect not caused by simple substitutions.\n\nD. The 20 bp spacer in M1 is energetically unfavorable and causes the DNA to form a secondary structure, such as a hairpin loop, that physically blocks the RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter.\n\nE. The sigma factor has a fixed size and the 20 bp spacer in M1 makes the distance between the -35 and -10 boxes too great for the protein to span, while the 17 bp distance in M2 remains within the acceptable range.", "solution": "Transcription initiation by the bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme requires simultaneous recognition of the promoter’s $-35$ and $-10$ elements by the sigma factor. The physical requirement is that these two hexamer elements be presented on approximately the same face of the DNA helix and at an appropriate center-to-center distance. The rotational register along B-form DNA is set by the helical repeat, assumed here to be one full turn per $10.5$ base pairs, so the twist per base pair is\n$$\n\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}\\ \\text{radians per bp}.\n$$\nLet the optimal spacer length be $n=17$ bp. If the spacer is changed to $n^{\\prime}=20$ bp (Mutation 1), the rotational offset of the $-10$ box relative to the $-35$ box, compared to the optimal geometry, changes by\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi=(n^{\\prime}-n)\\,\\omega=3\\cdot\\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}=\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\ \\text{radians}.\n$$\nFor simultaneous sigma-factor binding to both promoter elements, the angular register must satisfy $\\Delta \\phi\\approx 2\\pi m$ for some integer $m$ (i.e., the elements should remain on the same helical face). The value $\\Delta \\phi=\\frac{4\\pi}{7}$ is far from any multiple of $2\\pi$, corresponding to a large misalignment that places the two elements on different helical faces. This rotational misalignment disrupts the ability of sigma to contact both sites concurrently, thereby abolishing transcription despite only a modest change in linear distance. By contrast, Mutation 2 leaves the spacer length unchanged at $17$ bp, so its rotational phase remains optimal ($\\Delta \\phi\\approx 0$), and because sigma-factor recognition tolerates diverse spacer sequences (the spacer is not a direct sigma recognition element), such substitutions typically have only minor effects, aside from small changes in DNA stiffness or bendability.\n\nAlternative explanations are less consistent with the physics: direct sigma recognition of the spacer sequence is not the primary determinant (contradicting A), small insertions do not uniquely destabilize the helix beyond effects also possible with substitutions (contradicting C), hairpin formation in a short double-stranded spacer without inverted repeats is not expected (contradicting D), and the dominant effect is rotational phasing rather than absolute span, as the polymerase-sigma complex tolerates moderate span variation if phasing is preserved (contradicting E).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is the rotational misalignment caused by the $3$ bp insertion, while single substitutions that preserve spacer length preserve alignment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1514220"}]}
