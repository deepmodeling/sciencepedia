By analyzing a gene's regulatory architecture, including its promoter elements, enhancers, and ultimate RNA product, you can precisely identify the RNA polymerase responsible for its transcription. This exercise is fundamental to connecting gene structure with the specific enzymatic pathways of eukaryotic gene expression. [@problem_id:1487015]", "problem": "A team of geneticists is characterizing a newly identified gene in the mouse genome. Their analysis reveals several key features of its regulatory architecture. The gene possesses a core promoter containing a TATA box, located just upstream of the transcription start site. Further analysis uncovers multiple promoter-proximal elements within 200 base pairs of the promoter. Additionally, a strong enhancer sequence that significantly boosts gene expression is found approximately 10 kilobases (kb) upstream. The transcribed product of this gene is a messenger RNA (mRNA) destined for translation into a critical enzyme for glycolysis.\n\nBased on this detailed description, which of the following enzymes is responsible for transcribing this gene?\n\nA. RNA Polymerase I\n\nB. RNA Polymerase II\n\nC. RNA Polymerase III\n\nD. DNA Polymerase III\n\nE. Telomerase", "solution": "The gene is in a eukaryote (mouse) and produces an mRNA that will be translated into a protein (a glycolytic enzyme). In eukaryotes, the enzyme responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes into mRNA is RNA polymerase II.\n\nThe presence of a TATA box in the core promoter indicates binding by TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is a component of TFIID, a general transcription factor that assembles with RNA polymerase II to form the preinitiation complex. Promoter-proximal elements within roughly 200 base pairs of the promoter are characteristic binding sites for transcription factors that regulate RNA polymerase II transcription. A strong enhancer located approximately 10 kilobases upstream is also a hallmark of RNA polymerase II-regulated genes; enhancers can act at long distances and in an orientation-independent manner by looping to interact with the mediator complex and the RNA polymerase II machinery.\n\nBy contrast, RNA polymerase I transcribes most ribosomal RNA (28S, 18S, 5.8S), RNA polymerase III transcribes tRNAs and 5S rRNA (and some small RNAs), DNA polymerase III is a prokaryotic DNA replication enzyme, and telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that extends telomeres, not a nuclear RNA polymerase for mRNA synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the enzyme responsible for transcribing this gene is RNA polymerase II.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487015"}, {"introduction": "Our next challenge delves into the unique mechanics of RNA Polymerase III through a thought-provoking experimental scenario. You are presented with a surprising result: a transfer RNA (tRNA) gene is transcribed even after its entire upstream promoter region is deleted. This puzzle forces you to look for promoter elements in an unexpected place, revealing the clever and efficient strategy of internal control regions used by this polymerase. [@problem_id:1487022]", "problem": "A molecular biology student is investigating the transcriptional regulation of a gene encoding a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) in a eukaryotic system. Using recombinant DNA technology, the student creates a mutant version of this gene where the entire 5' flanking region, extending several hundred base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, has been completely deleted. This modified DNA is then used as a template in a cell-free in vitro transcription assay, which includes purified RNA Polymerase III, all the necessary general transcription factors (TFs), and a supply of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs). To the student's surprise, the assay successfully produces tRNA transcripts of the expected length.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this observation?\n\nA. RNA Polymerase III does not require a promoter and can initiate transcription at any random position on the DNA template.\n\nB. The essential promoter elements required for the initiation of transcription by RNA Polymerase III for this gene are located within the DNA sequence that is transcribed into RNA.\n\nC. The general transcription factors for RNA Polymerase III bind to the 3' untranscribed region downstream of the gene, recruiting the polymerase from that end.\n\nD. In the absence of the normal promoter, RNA Polymerase II first transcribes the gene, and the resulting precursor RNA is then processed to form the mature tRNA.\n\nE. The purified RNA Polymerase III enzyme preparation was contaminated with a DNA repair enzyme that reconstructed the missing 5' promoter sequence in the test tube.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: In eukaryotes, most tRNA genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase III using internal promoter elements embedded within the transcribed region of the gene. Specifically, these are the A box and B box internal control regions. The general transcription factor TFIIIC recognizes and binds these internal elements, then recruits TFIIIB to a site upstream of the transcription start site, assembling a preinitiation complex that positions RNA Polymerase III for accurate initiation.\n\nLogical steps applied to the experiment:\n1. The student deleted the entire 5' flanking region upstream of the transcription start site. If initiation required an external upstream promoter, transcription would fail.\n2. However, tRNA genes use internal promoters within the coding region; thus the necessary promoter elements remain intact despite removal of the 5' flanking DNA.\n3. The in vitro system supplied RNA Polymerase III and its general transcription factors, enabling TFIIIC to bind the internal A and B boxes and recruit TFIIIB and RNA Polymerase III for initiation at the correct site, producing correctly sized tRNA transcripts.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because RNA Polymerase III requires promoter elements; it does not initiate randomly.\n- B is correct because the essential promoter elements for tRNA genes are within the transcribed region.\n- C is incorrect because, for tRNA genes, promoter control is internal to the transcribed region, not in the 3' untranscribed downstream region.\n- D is incorrect because tRNA genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase III, not RNA Polymerase II.\n- E is implausible and unnecessary given the established internal promoter mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that the essential promoter elements reside within the transcribed region of the tRNA gene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487022"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates our understanding from qualitative identification to quantitative application, addressing a critical aspect of cellular logistics: the coordinated production of components for a complex molecular machine. To ensure the proper assembly of ribosomes, the cell must precisely balance the outputs of RNA Polymerase I and RNA Polymerase III.

An 80S eukaryotic ribosome is composed of a small (40S) subunit and a large (60S) subunit. The 40S subunit contains a single 18S rRNA molecule, while the 60S subunit contains one 28S rRNA, one 5.8S rRNA, and one 5S rRNA molecule.\n\nThe genes for 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA are co-transcribed by RNA Polymerase I as a single 45S pre-rRNA transcript, which is then processed to yield exactly one molecule of each of the three rRNAs. Assume this processing step is 100% efficient. Separately, the gene for 5S rRNA is transcribed by RNA Polymerase III.\n\nDue to factors including sequence-specific pausing and local chromatin environment, the transcription of the 5S rRNA gene by RNA Polymerase III is not perfectly efficient. It is observed that only 80.0% of transcriptional initiation events on the 5S rRNA gene result in a stable, full-length functional 5S rRNA molecule. The other 20.0% of initiated transcripts are prematurely terminated and subsequently degraded.\n\nTo ensure a balanced supply of all components for the assembly of complete 80S ribosomes, the cell must maintain a specific ratio of activity between these polymerases.

Therefore, the production rate of each of these three rRNAs equals $r_{\\mathrm{I}}$.\n\nEach RNA Polymerase III initiation on the 5S rRNA gene yields a functional 5S rRNA with probability $0.800$, so the functional 5S rRNA production rate is $0.800\\,r_{\\mathrm{III}}$.\n\nBalanced assembly of ribosomes requires equal production rates of all required rRNAs (one of each per ribosome).
