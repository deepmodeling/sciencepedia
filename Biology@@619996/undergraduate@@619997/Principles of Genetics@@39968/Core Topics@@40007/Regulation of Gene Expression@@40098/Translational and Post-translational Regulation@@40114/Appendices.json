The enzyme's product, a small vitamin molecule, can directly bind to a specific structure within the 5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR) of the enzyme's messenger RNA (mRNA). In the absence of the vitamin, the 5' UTR adopts a conformation that permits efficient initiation of translation by the ribosome. When the vitamin binds to the 5' UTR, it induces a conformational change that stalls the ribosome, effectively halting the synthesis of the enzyme. This binding process is reversible.\n\nLet the dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the binding of the vitamin to the mRNA's 5' UTR be $45.5$ nM. Assuming this binding reaction is at equilibrium within the cell, calculate the intracellular concentration of the vitamin that would reduce the rate of enzyme synthesis to exactly 20% of its maximum possible rate (i.e., the rate observed in the complete absence of the vitamin).\n\nExpress your answer in nanomolar (nM), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $M$ denote the mRNA 5' UTR, $L$ the vitamin, and $ML$ the bound complex.
