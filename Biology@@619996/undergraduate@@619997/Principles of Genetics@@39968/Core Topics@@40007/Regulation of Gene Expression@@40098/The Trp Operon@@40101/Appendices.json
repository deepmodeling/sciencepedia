This first exercise [@problem_id:1529120] challenges you to predict the outcome of a specific mutation that disrupts the interaction between the repressor protein and its corepressor, tryptophan, providing a solid foundation for understanding how this fundamental 'off' switch operates.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon, a classic example of a repressible genetic system. The operon consists of five structural genes (*trpE, D, C, B, A*) that code for enzymes in the synthesis pathway, along with a promoter and an operator sequence. A separate regulatory gene, *trpR*, located elsewhere on the chromosome, codes for the trp repressor protein.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the trp repressor protein is synthesized in an inactive form (an apo-repressor) that cannot bind to the operator. When intracellular levels of tryptophan are high, tryptophan molecules act as a corepressor, binding to the apo-repressor. This binding event causes a conformational change in the repressor protein, activating it. The active repressor-tryptophan complex then binds to the operator sequence, physically blocking RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes, thus halting tryptophan synthesis.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a specific mutation in the *trpR* gene. This mutation alters the allosteric site of the trp repressor protein, making it incapable of binding to tryptophan. However, the DNA-binding domain of the repressor protein remains unaltered and is functional in principle.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the phenotype of this mutant strain regarding the expression of the *trp* operon?\n\nA. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be permanently repressed, and the cell will be unable to synthesize tryptophan.\n\nB.

The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed continuously, regardless of the intracellular concentration of tryptophan.\n\nD. The *trp* operon will behave like an inducible system, with transcription occurring only when tryptophan is present in the medium.", "solution": "The problem asks for the phenotype of an *E. coli* strain with a specific mutation in the *trpR* gene, which prevents the resulting repressor protein from binding to its corepressor, tryptophan.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Wild-Type Regulation of the *trp* Operon**\nIn a wild-type cell, the *trp* operon's expression is regulated by the intracellular concentration of tryptophan.\n- The regulatory gene, *trpR*, produces an inactive repressor protein called an apo-repressor.\n- This apo-repressor, by itself, cannot bind to the operator region of the *trp* operon.\n- When tryptophan is scarce, the apo-repressor remains inactive. RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes, leading to the synthesis of enzymes that produce tryptophan.\n- When tryptophan is abundant, it acts as a corepressor. It binds to the allosteric site of the apo-repressor.\n- This binding event induces a conformational change in the repressor protein, converting it into an active repressor-corepressor complex.\n- This active complex has a high affinity for the operator sequence (*trpO*) and binds to it, physically obstructing RNA polymerase and thereby repressing transcription of the operon.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Specific Mutation**\nThe mutation described is in the *trpR* gene. The resulting mutant repressor protein has a defective allosteric site and cannot bind to tryptophan. Its DNA-binding domain is normal.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the State of the Mutant Repressor Protein**\nThe key to activating the trp repressor is the binding of the corepressor, tryptophan. It is this binding that causes the conformational change allowing the repressor to bind to the operator's DNA sequence.\nIn the mutant strain, the repressor protein is unable to bind tryptophan. Therefore, the repressor can never undergo the necessary conformational change to become active. It will permanently exist in the apo-repressor state, which is the inactive form.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Interaction with the Operator**\nSince the mutant repressor protein is permanently locked in its inactive conformation, it will never be able to bind to the operator sequence (*trpO*). This is true regardless of whether tryptophan is present or absent in the cell. The functionality of the DNA-binding domain is irrelevant if the protein can never adopt the correct shape to use it.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Phenotype of the Operon**\nWith the operator site perpetually unbound by a repressor, there is no mechanism to block RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter and initiating transcription. Consequently, the structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed continuously. This mode of expression, where genes are always \"on\", is known as constitutive expression. The cell will continuously synthesize the enzymes for the tryptophan pathway and thus produce tryptophan, even when external tryptophan is readily available.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n- **A. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be permanently repressed, and the cell will be unable to synthesize tryptophan.** This is incorrect. Repression requires an active repressor, which cannot be formed. The genes will be expressed, not repressed.\n- **B. The *trp* operon will function like a wild-type operon, with transcription being repressed only in the presence of tryptophan.** This is incorrect. It describes the wild-type phenotype, but the mutation prevents the wild-type regulatory mechanism from functioning.\n- **C. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed continuously, regardless of the intracellular concentration of tryptophan.** This is correct. The inability of the repressor to bind its corepressor (tryptophan) means it can never become active and bind the operator, leading to constitutive transcription.\n- **D. The *trp* operon will behave like an inducible system, with transcription occurring only when tryptophan is present in the medium.** This is incorrect. It describes the opposite logic of a repressible system and is characteristic of inducible systems like the *lac* operon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1529120"}, {"introduction": "Beyond a simple on/off switch, the *trp* operon employs a second, more elegant layer of control known as attenuation, which acts like a dimmer switch to fine-tune expression. This mechanism cleverly links the rate of transcription to the rate of translation of a short leader peptide. This problem [@problem_id:1529113] explores a hypothetical scenario where the key tryptophan-sensing codons in the leader sequence are altered, allowing you to deconstruct the ingenious molecular logic of attenuation.", "problem": "In *Escherichia coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon. This system employs two layers of control: repression and attenuation. This problem focuses on the attenuation mechanism, which fine-tunes the expression of the structural genes (*trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, trpA*).\n\nAttenuation occurs in the leader region (*trpL*), located upstream of the structural genes. This leader sequence contains four distinct regions (1, 2, 3, and 4) that can form alternative stem-loop secondary structures in the transcribed mRNA. The formation of a stem-loop between regions 2 and 3 acts as an anti-terminator, allowing transcription to proceed. Conversely, the formation of a stem-loop between regions 3 and 4 acts as a rho-independent terminator, halting transcription prematurely.\n\nCrucially, the leader sequence also contains a short open reading frame that codes for a 14-amino-acid leader peptide. Within the coding sequence for this peptide are two adjacent codons for tryptophan. The rate of translation of this leader peptide dictates which stem-loop structure forms.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mutant strain of *E. coli*. In this strain, the two adjacent tryptophan codons in the *trpL* gene have been mutated to codons that specify the amino acid alanine. The primary repression system, involving the Trp repressor protein and the operator sequence, remains fully functional. Assuming that the cellular concentration of charged tRNA for alanine (tRNA$^{Ala}$) is always high and not a limiting factor for translation, what is the most likely consequence of this mutation on the regulation of the *trp* operon?\n\nA. The expression of the *trp* structural genes will be significantly reduced under all tryptophan concentrations due to constitutive attenuation.\n\nB. The expression of the *trp* structural genes will be constitutively high, regardless of tryptophan concentration, as attenuation will be completely abolished.\n\nC. The attenuation mechanism will not be affected, and the expression of the structural genes will continue to be regulated by tryptophan levels.\n\nD. The mutation will prevent the Trp repressor protein from binding to the operator, leading to constitutive expression of the operon.\n\nE. The expression of the *trp* operon will now be regulated by the intracellular concentration of alanine instead of tryptophan.", "solution": "We analyze attenuation in the trp operon by tracking how ribosome position on the leader mRNA dictates which RNA secondary structure forms.\n\n1) Wild-type attenuation logic:\n- The leader mRNA has regions 1, 2, 3, 4 that can pair to form either the 2-3 antiterminator or the 3-4 terminator.\n- Translation of the leader peptide begins while transcription proceeds. The leader peptide includes two adjacent Trp codons.\n- If $[\\text{Trp}]$ is high, charged $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Trp}}$ is abundant, the ribosome translates through the two Trp codons without stalling, moves into and covers region 2, thereby preventing 2-3 pairing. Consequently, regions 3 and 4 pair to form the intrinsic terminator, and transcription terminates prematurely. Symbolically: high $[\\text{Trp}] \\Rightarrow$ no stall at Trp codons $\\Rightarrow$ 2 is occluded $\\Rightarrow$ 3-4 forms $\\Rightarrow$ termination.\n- If $[\\text{Trp}]$ is low, charged $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Trp}}$ is scarce, the ribosome stalls at the two Trp codons in region 1, leaving region 2 free. Regions 2 and 3 pair to form the antiterminator, allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the structural genes. Symbolically: low $[\\text{Trp}] \\Rightarrow$ stall at Trp codons in 1 $\\Rightarrow$ 2 free $\\Rightarrow$ 2-3 forms $\\Rightarrow$ readthrough.\n\n2) Effect of the mutation:\n- In the mutant, the two Trp codons in *trpL* are replaced by Ala codons. By assumption, the cellular concentration of charged $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ is always high and not limiting.\n- Therefore, the ribosome will not stall at these positions regardless of $[\\text{Trp}]$; translation of the leader peptide proceeds rapidly through the region that normally senses tryptophan.\n- As in the high-tryptophan wild-type scenario, the ribosome will enter and occlude region 2, preventing 2-3 pairing and favoring 3-4 terminator formation. This yields constitutive attenuation.\n- Thus, attenuation becomes insensitive to $[\\text{Trp}]$ and is effectively “always on,” reducing transcription into the structural genes at all tryptophan levels, provided transcription initiates.\n\n3) Role of the primary repression system:\n- The Trp repressor-operator system remains intact and will still repress when $[\\text{Trp}]$ is high. However, under low $[\\text{Trp}]$, although repression would normally be relieved, the constitutive attenuation in the mutant will still cause premature termination, keeping expression low.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A matches the prediction: constitutive attenuation leads to significantly reduced expression under all tryptophan concentrations.\n- B is incorrect: abolishing attenuation would require preventing 3-4 formation or otherwise ensuring stable 2-3 formation; replacing Trp codons with Ala codons that are efficiently translated does the opposite.\n- C is incorrect: the attenuation mechanism is altered and no longer responds to $[\\text{Trp}]$.\n- D is incorrect: the mutation is in the leader peptide coding region, not the operator; repressor binding is unaffected.\n- E is incorrect: although attenuation can be sensitive to the availability of the cognate charged tRNA for the codons in the leader, the assumption explicitly states $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ is always abundant, so regulation does not switch to alanine; moreover, the primary repression remains tryptophan-dependent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1529113"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative understanding to quantitative prediction is a crucial step in molecular and synthetic biology.

The expression of this operon is controlled by two primary mechanisms: repression and attenuation.\n\n1.  **Repression**: In the presence of high intracellular Trp concentrations, the TrpR repressor protein, activated by Trp, binds to the operator site (*trpO*). This binding reduces the transcription initiation rate by a repression factor, $F_{rep}$.\n2.  **Attenuation**: A secondary mechanism involves a leader sequence (*trpL*) that can terminate transcription prematurely. When Trp is abundant, a fraction $f_{term}$ of initiated transcripts are successfully completed, while the rest are terminated. When Trp is scarce, this termination is relieved, and a larger fraction $f_{cont}$ of transcripts are completed.\n\nThe overall rate of synthesis of the Trp-biosynthesis enzymes is directly proportional to the rate of successful transcription of the operon.\n\nThe engineer compares a wild-type (WT) strain to a mutant (MUT) strain.
