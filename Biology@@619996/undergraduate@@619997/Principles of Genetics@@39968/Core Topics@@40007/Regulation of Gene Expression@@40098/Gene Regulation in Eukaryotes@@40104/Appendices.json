{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled at many levels, starting with the very structure of the chromatin itself. This first practice problem explores the epigenetic layer of regulation, where chemical marks on DNA can dictate which genes are silenced or available for transcription. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the enzymes that maintain these marks are inhibited, you will unpack the dynamic and critical role of DNA methylation in maintaining cellular identity and gene expression patterns across cell divisions [@problem_id:1491191].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying a human cancer cell line known for its extremely high rate of proliferation. They are interested in the role of epigenetics in controlling the gene expression profile of these cells. A key epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation, where a methyl group is added to cytosine bases, particularly in regions called CpG islands found within the promoters of many genes. This methylation is generally associated with transcriptional silencing. The enzymes responsible for adding and maintaining these methylation patterns are known as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).\n\nTo investigate this, the researchers treat a culture of these rapidly dividing cells with a newly developed, highly potent drug that completely inhibits the activity of all DNMTs. The cells are cultured for a period sufficient to allow for several complete cell divisions in the continuous presence of the inhibitor.\n\nAssuming the drug has no other off-target effects, what would be the most likely global effect on the gene expression patterns in this cell line?\n\nA. Widespread and non-specific activation of many previously silenced genes.\n\nB. A general shutdown of all gene transcription, leading to rapid cell cycle arrest.\n\nC. No significant change in the overall gene expression profile, as existing methylation patterns are chemically stable and do not require active maintenance.\n\nD. Specific activation of only a small, select group of genes responsible for initiating apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nE. An increase in the methylation of histone proteins to compensate for the lack of DNA methylation, resulting in selective silencing of different gene sets.", "solution": "DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands is generally associated with transcriptional repression because methylated CpGs recruit methyl-CpG binding proteins and corepressor complexes that compact chromatin and reduce accessibility to transcriptional machinery. In proliferating cells, the maintenance of these methylation patterns during DNA replication is performed primarily by DNMT1, which recognizes hemimethylated CpG dyads generated after semiconservative DNA replication and restores full methylation on the nascent strand. De novo methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) establish new methylation marks but are not required for copying existing patterns.\n\nIf all DNMT activity is completely inhibited and cells undergo several rounds of DNA replication, each replication event converts fully methylated CpG sites into hemimethylated sites, and without DNMT1 activity, these sites are not remethylated on the daughter strands. With successive divisions, this leads to passive demethylation, progressively erasing DNA methylation marks across the genome, including at promoter CpG islands that were previously methylated and silenced.\n\nLoss of promoter DNA methylation removes a key repressive epigenetic mark, decreases recruitment of methyl-binding repressors, favors a more open chromatin configuration, and thereby derepresses transcription. Because the inhibition is global and sustained across multiple cell cycles, the effect is expected to be widespread and relatively non-specific, leading to activation of many genes that had been silenced by DNA methylation.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is correct: broad, non-specific derepression of many previously silenced genes is the expected global outcome.\n- B is incorrect: DNA methylation inhibition does not cause a general shutdown; if anything, it tends toward increased transcriptional permissiveness.\n- C is incorrect: maintenance is required every S phase; without DNMT1, methylation patterns are not stably retained and are diluted with replication.\n- D is incorrect: activation would not be limited specifically to apoptosis genes; the effect is not that selective.\n- E is incorrect: while there is crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation, there is no mechanism ensuring a compensatory global increase in histone methylation that selectively silences different sets to restore the original pattern.\n\nThus, the most likely global effect is widespread activation of previously silenced genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1491191"}, {"introduction": "Once a gene is accessible within the chromatin, its transcription often requires the action of specific transcription factors. However, the function of these proteins depends critically on their ability to reach their DNA targets inside the nucleus. This exercise examines the consequences of a mutation that removes a protein's \"zip code\" for nuclear entry, the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), providing a clear illustration of how cellular compartmentalization is fundamental to gene regulation [@problem_id:1491178].", "problem": "In a particular eukaryotic cell line, the production of an enzyme called Metabolase-X is induced by the hormone Cortistatin. The mechanism involves Cortistatin binding to a cell surface receptor, which initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately activates a protein called Gene Regulatory Factor Alpha (GRF-α). Activated GRF-α then functions as a transcription factor, increasing the transcription rate of the gene that codes for Metabolase-X.\n\nResearchers have created a mutant version of this cell line. In these mutant cells, the gene encoding GRF-α has a small, in-frame deletion that completely removes the sequence corresponding to the protein's Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), but leaves the rest of the protein sequence, including its DNA-binding domain, intact.\n\nIf these mutant cells are treated with an optimal concentration of Cortistatin, which of the following outcomes is expected? For the purpose of this question, \"Basal\" refers to the low, uninduced level of transcription, and \"High\" refers to the significantly elevated level of transcription seen in hormone-treated wild-type cells.\n\nA. Location of GRF-α: Nucleus; Level of *Metabolase-X* gene transcription: High.\n\nB. Location of GRF-α: Cytoplasm; Level of *Metabolase-X* gene transcription: High.\n\nC. Location of GRF-α: Cytoplasm; Level of *Metabolase-X* gene transcription: Basal.\n\nD. Location of GRF-α: Nucleus; Level of *Metabolase-X* gene transcription: Basal.", "solution": "Cortistatin binds a cell surface receptor and triggers a signaling cascade that activates GRF-α. In wild-type cells, activated GRF-α translocates to the nucleus via its Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), where it binds DNA and increases transcription of the Metabolase-X gene.\n\nIn the mutant cells, the in-frame deletion removes the NLS but leaves the DNA-binding domain intact. The NLS is required for active nuclear import through the importin-mediated pathway; without an NLS, a typical transcription factor remains in the cytoplasm because it cannot be efficiently transported through the nuclear pore complex. Although GRF-α can still be activated by the signaling cascade and retains DNA-binding capability, it cannot access chromosomal DNA in the nucleus if it cannot enter the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, upon Cortistatin treatment, GRF-α will localize to the cytoplasm, and the Metabolase-X gene will not be transcriptionally upregulated by GRF-α. Transcription will remain at the basal level seen in the absence of nuclear GRF-α.\n\nConsequently, the expected outcome is: Location of GRF-α: Cytoplasm; Level of Metabolase-X gene transcription: Basal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1491178"}, {"introduction": "The cell's regulatory oversight continues even after a gene is successfully transcribed into messenger RNA. To prevent the production of potentially harmful truncated proteins, cells employ sophisticated quality control systems like Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) to find and destroy faulty transcripts. This problem delves into the ingenious molecular logic of the NMD pathway, revealing how the position of an error relative to the mRNA's structure determines whether the transcript is targeted for degradation [@problem_id:1491172].", "problem": "In a study of eukaryotic gene expression, a research team investigates a hypothetical human gene called `STAB`, which is composed of four exons and three introns. The normal function of the `STAB` protein is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. The team creates two distinct mutant cell lines, each with a single point mutation that introduces a Premature Termination Codon (PTC).\n\n- **Mutant A**: The PTC is located in the middle of exon 2.\n- **Mutant B**: The PTC is located near the beginning of exon 4, which is the final exon of the gene.\n\nAfter culturing the cells, the researchers measure the steady-state levels of the `STAB` mRNA. They find that in Mutant A cells, the `STAB` mRNA is nearly undetectable. However, in Mutant B cells, the `STAB` mRNA is present at levels comparable to the wild-type, although the truncated protein produced is non-functional.\n\nBased on the canonical model of messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance in eukaryotes, which of the following statements provides the most accurate mechanistic explanation for why the transcript from Mutant B evades Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD), the primary pathway for degrading transcripts with PTCs?\n\nA. The NMD pathway requires the presence of an Exon Junction Complex (EJC) downstream of the termination codon. Since the PTC in Mutant B is in the final exon, there are no downstream exon-exon junctions and thus no downstream EJCs to trigger NMD.\n\nB. The PTC in Mutant B is located very close to the natural termination codon, and the Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) interacting with the poly(A) tail stabilizes the terminating ribosome, preventing the recruitment of NMD factors.\n\nC. The mutation in exon 4 disrupts an essential Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) sequence, causing exon 4 to be skipped during splicing. This results in a stable, alternative transcript that lacks the PTC.\n\nD. Ribosomes that translate the Mutant B transcript dissociate so rapidly at the PTC that the NMD machinery does not have sufficient time to recognize the stalled complex and initiate degradation.\n\nE. The presence of a PTC in the final exon activates a compensatory feedback loop that dramatically upregulates the transcription rate of the `STAB` gene, masking the effects of NMD-mediated degradation.", "solution": "The canonical eukaryotic NMD model relies on the position of the termination codon relative to downstream exon-exon junctions marked by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC). During pre-mRNA splicing, EJCs are deposited upstream of exon-exon junctions and are normally removed by the pioneering round of translation as the ribosome traverses the coding sequence. If translation terminates prematurely at a PTC that lies more than approximately $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of at least one exon-exon junction, a downstream EJC remains bound and interacts with NMD factors (notably UPF proteins), which triggers decay of the transcript. In contrast, if the termination codon lies in the final exon, there is no exon-exon junction downstream and thus no downstream EJC to recruit the NMD machinery, so the transcript generally evades NMD.\n\nApplying this to the mutants: In Mutant A, the PTC in exon $2$ leaves multiple downstream exon-exon junctions (for example, between exons $2$ and $3$, and between exons $3$ and $4$), so at least one EJC remains downstream at the time of premature termination. This fits the EJC-dependent trigger for NMD and explains the nearly undetectable steady-state mRNA. In Mutant B, the PTC is in exon $4$, the final exon. There are no exon-exon junctions downstream of exon $4$, so no downstream EJC can persist to recruit NMD factors when termination occurs at the PTC. Therefore, the transcript evades NMD and accumulates to near wild-type levels, even though it encodes a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nEvaluating the options mechanistically: Option A correctly states the EJC-dependent requirement for a downstream exon-exon junction and explains why a PTC in the final exon typically escapes NMD. Option B invokes stabilization via Poly(A)-Binding Protein due to proximity to the natural stop codon; however, the prompt places the PTC near the beginning of exon $4$, not close to the natural stop codon near the end of exon $4$, so this is not the most accurate explanation for this case. Options C, D, and E are inconsistent with the canonical NMD model and the described observations. Hence, A is the most accurate explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1491172"}]}
