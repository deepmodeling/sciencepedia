By calculating the resulting chromosome number in a carrier, you will practice the basic principles of cytogenetic counting that form the foundation for analyzing more complex chromosomal abnormalities. [@problem_id:1532629]", "problem": "In human genetics, a normal diploid somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes. Certain chromosomes, known as acrocentric chromosomes, have their centromere located very near one end. In humans, chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 are acrocentric. A Robertsonian translocation is a specific type of chromosomal rearrangement involving the fusion of the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes to form a single, large derivative chromosome. This process typically results in the loss of the short arms, which contain non-essential genetic material, so the carrier remains phenotypically normal.\n\nAn individual is identified as a healthy carrier of a balanced Robertsonian translocation. Cytogenetic analysis confirms that one of their copies of chromosome 14 has fused with one of their copies of chromosome 21. All other chromosomes are normal in number and structure.\n\nWhat is the total number of chromosomes in a single somatic cell of this individual?", "solution": "A normal human diploid somatic cell contains $N_{0} = 46$ chromosomes.\n\nA Robertsonian translocation fuses the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes into a single derivative chromosome and results in the loss of the short arms. Counting principle: two separate chromosomes are replaced by one fused chromosome, so the total chromosome number decreases by one. Hence the net change in chromosome count is\n$$\n\\Delta N = 1 - 2 = -1.\n$$\nIn this case, one chromosome $14$ and one chromosome $21$ fuse. Originally, the cell had two copies each of chromosomes $14$ and $21$, totaling $4$ chromosomes among these two types. After translocation, the cell has one normal $14$, one normal $21$, and one derivative $\\operatorname{der}(14;21)$, totaling $3$ chromosomes among these types. All other chromosomes remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the total chromosome number becomes\n$$\nN = (46 - 4) + 3 = 45,\n$$\nequivalently,\n$$\nN = N_{0} + \\Delta N = 46 - 1 = 45.\n$$\nThus, a healthy carrier of a balanced Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes $14$ and $21$ has $45$ chromosomes in each somatic cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{45}$$", "id": "1532629"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the static chromosome count, the true genetic impact of a translocation is revealed during meiosis. This problem explores how a reciprocal translocation heterozygote forms a quadrivalent structure and how different segregation patterns can lead to either balanced or unbalanced gametes. Focusing on adjacent-1 segregation helps demystify how a phenotypically normal individual can have an increased risk of producing offspring with genetic imbalances. [@problem_id:1532694]", "problem": "An individual human is heterozygous for a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 3 and chromosome 7. Let us denote the normal chromosomes as `N3` and `N7`, and the translocated chromosomes as `T3` (containing the centromere of chromosome 3 and a distal segment of chromosome 7) and `T7` (containing the centromere of chromosome 7 and a distal segment of chromosome 3). During meiosis in this individual, a synaptonemal complex forms a characteristic quadrivalent structure involving all four chromosomes.\n\nAssuming that meiosis proceeds and segregation occurs via the **adjacent-1 pattern**, what are the resulting chromosomal combinations that will be found in the gametes?\n\nA.

(`N3`, `N7`) and (`N3`, `T3`)", "solution": "We are given a reciprocal translocation heterozygote with four participating chromosomes: the normal chromosomes $N3$ and $N7$, and the translocated chromosomes $T3$ (with the centromere of chromosome $3$ and a distal segment of chromosome $7$) and $T7$ (with the centromere of chromosome $7$ and a distal segment of chromosome $3$). During meiosis, these form a quadrivalent.\n\nKey meiotic segregation patterns for a reciprocal translocation quadrivalent are:\n- Alternate segregation: diagonally opposite centromeres go to the same pole, producing balanced gametes containing either both normal (N3,N7) or both translocated (T3,T7).\n- Adjacent-1 segregation: homologous centromeres separate to opposite poles (the usual rule), so the two chromosomes that go to any one pole carry different centromeres (nonhomologous centromeres). This yields one normal chromosome together with the translocated chromosome carrying the other centromere.\n- Adjacent-2 segregation: homologous centromeres go to the same pole (rare), yielding pairs (N3,T3) and (N7,T7).\n\nApplying the definition of adjacent-1 segregation to the present case:\n- One pole receives $N3$ (centromere $3$) together with $T7$ (centromere $7$), giving the gametic combination (N3,T7).\n- The other pole receives $N7$ (centromere $7$) together with $T3$ (centromere $3$), giving the gametic combination (N7,T3).\n\nThus, adjacent-1 segregation produces the unbalanced gametes (N3,T7) and (N7,T3), which corresponds to option B.

This practice challenges you to compare two hypothetical cases of partial monosomy that are identical in physical length but differ in gene density. This exercise bridges the gap between cytogenetics and molecular genetics, illustrating the crucial principle that phenotypic severity is directly related to gene dosage and the functional importance of the affected genomic region. [@problem_id:1532680]", "problem": "A clinical geneticist is analyzing karyotypes from two unrelated infants, Patient A and Patient B, both presenting with distinct congenital anomalies. In both cases, the anomalies are traced to an unbalanced product of a parental reciprocal translocation, leading to a partial monosomy (a terminal deletion of a chromosome segment).\n\nHigh-resolution cytogenetic analysis and genomic mapping provide the following data:\n- **Patient A**: Has a terminal deletion on the p-arm of a chromosome. The deleted segment is 5.0 Megabases (Mb) in length. This region is known to be particularly gene-rich, with an average density of 24 protein-coding genes per Mb.\n- **Patient B**: Has a terminal deletion on the q-arm of a different chromosome. The deleted segment is also precisely 5.0 Mb in length. This region is part of a large heterochromatic block and is relatively gene-poor, with an average density of 7 protein-coding genes per Mb.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of gene dosage and chromosomal abnormalities, what is the most likely prediction regarding the relative phenotypic severity in these two patients?\n\nA. The phenotype of Patient A is likely to be more severe than the phenotype of Patient B.\n\nB. The phenotype of Patient B is likely to be more severe than the phenotype of Patient A.\n\nC. The phenotypes are expected to be of equal severity because the physical length of the deleted DNA is identical.\n\nD. The phenotypes are expected to be of equal severity because any partial monosomy is typically lethal regardless of the specific genes involved.\n\nE. It is impossible to make any prediction about relative severity from the information given.", "solution": "Principle: In partial monosomy due to a terminal deletion, phenotypic severity is largely driven by gene dosage effects, especially loss of dosage-sensitive (haploinsufficient) genes. For segments of equal physical length, a region with higher protein-coding gene density is expected to remove more genes, on average increasing the likelihood and breadth of developmental consequences. Heterochromatic regions are typically gene-poor and often contain repetitive, noncoding DNA; their deletion usually removes fewer protein-coding genes and is therefore generally less severe, all else being equal.\n\nCompute the expected number of protein-coding genes deleted in each patient:\nFor Patient A (gene-rich p-arm region):\n$$\nN_{A} = \\left(5.0 \\,\\text{Mb}\\right) \\times \\left(24 \\,\\text{genes} \\,\\text{Mb}^{-1}\\right) = 120 \\,\\text{genes}.\n$$\nFor Patient B (heterochromatic, gene-poor q-arm region):\n$$\nN_{B} = \\left(5.0 \\,\\text{Mb}\\right) \\times \\left(7 \\,\\text{genes} \\,\\text{Mb}^{-1}\\right) = 35 \\,\\text{genes}.\n$$\nSince $N_{A} > N_{B}$, Patient A is predicted to have lost more protein-coding genes, increasing the risk of haploinsufficiency for essential genes and thus greater phenotypic severity.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Consistent with gene dosage principles and the calculations above.\n- B: Inconsistent; Patient B loses fewer genes in a gene-poor region.\n- C: Incorrect; equal physical length does not imply equal gene content or severity.\n- D: Incorrect; many partial monosomies are compatible with postnatal survival and have variable severity depending on gene content (e.g., 5p deletion syndrome).\n- E: Incorrect; the information given (gene density and size) permits a reasonable prediction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely prediction is that Patient A will have a more severe phenotype than Patient B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1532680"}]}
