This exercise guides you through the fundamental arithmetic of allopolyploidy, allowing you to calculate the somatic chromosome number of a newly formed fertile hybrid. Mastering this is a crucial first step in analyzing any polyploid organism [@problem_id:1511141].", "problem": "A plant breeder is engaged in a project to create a new, hardy species of ornamental flower by hybridizing two different diploid species. The first parent, Species A, has a diploid somatic chromosome number of $2n=8$. The second parent, Species B, has a diploid somatic chromosome number of $2n=10$.\n\nThe breeder successfully crosses Species A and Species B, producing a viable hybrid offspring. However, this hybrid plant is sterile because its chromosomes, derived from two different species, fail to form homologous pairs during meiosis. To restore fertility, the breeder applies a chemical treatment to the hybrid seedling, which induces a doubling of the entire chromosome set within its somatic cells. This process creates a new, fertile plant species known as an allopolyploid.\n\nWhat is the diploid somatic chromosome number ($2n$) of this new, fertile allopolyploid plant?", "solution": "Let the diploid somatic chromosome numbers of the parents be denoted by $2n_{A}$ and $2n_{B}$, where:\n$$2n_{A}=8 \\implies n_{A}=4,$$\n$$2n_{B}=10 \\implies n_{B}=5.$$\n\nA hybrid formed by crossing these species receives one haploid set from each parent, so its somatic chromosome number is the sum of the parental haploid numbers:\n$$\\text{Hybrid somatic number} = n_{A} + n_{B} = 4 + 5 = 9.$$\nThis hybrid is sterile because the chromosomes from the two species lack homologs for proper pairing during meiosis.\n\nInducing chromosome doubling in the hybrid duplicates the entire set, creating an allopolyploid in which each chromosome now has a homolog from its duplicated subgenome. The resulting somatic chromosome number is:\n$$2(n_{A} + n_{B}) = 2(4 + 5) = 18.$$\n\nTherefore, the diploid somatic chromosome number of the new, fertile allopolyploid is $18$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "1511141"}, {"introduction": "Once a polyploid organism is formed, how are its alleles passed to the next generation?
