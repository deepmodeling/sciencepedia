This change in gene quantity, or \"gene dosage,\" can have direct and measurable effects on an organism's phenotype. This practice problem provides a clear, quantitative exercise to explore the fundamental concept of gene dosage, demonstrating how a simple duplication can lead to a predictable change in protein levels [@problem_id:1475933].", "problem": "In a particular metabolic pathway, the rate-limiting step is catalyzed by the enzyme Glucuronosyltransferase B (GTB).

A chromosomal inversion, which reverses a segment of a chromosome, can create significant challenges for a cell attempting to produce viable gametes. This exercise guides you through the consequences of a crossover event within a paracentric inversion loop, revealing the formation of abnormal chromosome structures that help explain why individuals heterozygous for such inversions often exhibit reduced fertility [@problem_id:1475890].", "problem": "In a hypothetical plant species, *Genetica flores*, a specific chromosome is being studied. The standard, or wild-type, chromosome has a sequence of gene loci arranged in the order: **cen-R-G-B-Y-P-M-tel**, where 'cen' is the centromere and 'tel' is the telomere. An agronomist discovers a population that is heterozygous for a structural rearrangement on this chromosome. In this individual, one homologous chromosome is the wild-type, while the other carries a paracentric inversion, resulting in the gene order: **cen-R-Y-B-G-P-M-tel**.\n\nDuring meiosis in this heterozygous plant, a single crossover event occurs between two non-sister chromatids. The crossover point is precisely between the 'B' and 'Y' loci within the inverted region. Assuming meiosis completes, which of the following options correctly describes the genetic content of the four resulting gametes?\n\nA. One gamete with the wild-type chromosome, one gamete with the inverted chromosome, and two non-viable gametes containing chromosomes with significant deletions.\n\nB. Two gametes with the wild-type chromosome and two gametes with the inverted chromosome.\n\nC. Four non-viable gametes, each containing a chromosome with a unique combination of duplications and deletions.\n\nD. One gamete with the wild-type chromosome, one gamete with the inverted chromosome, one gamete with the gene order **cen-R-G-B-G-P-M-tel**, and one gamete with the gene order **cen-R-Y-B-Y-P-M-tel**.\n\nE. One gamete with a dicentric (two centromeres) chromosome, one gamete with an acentric (no centromere) chromosome fragment, one wild-type gamete, and one inverted gamete.", "solution": "The wild-type homolog has the order cen-R-G-B-Y-P-M-tel, and the inverted homolog has the order cen-R-Y-B-G-P-M-tel. The inversion is paracentric because the centromere (cen) is outside the inverted block; specifically, the block G-B-Y is inverted between R and P.\n\nIn meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair by forming an inversion loop to align homologous loci. A single crossover between two non-sister chromatids within the inverted region (explicitly between loci B and Y) produces the canonical paracentric inversion crossover products:\n1) Two chromatids that did not participate in the crossover remain nonrecombinant: one retains the wild-type order and one retains the inverted order.\n2) The two chromatids that participated in the crossover become recombinant with abnormal structure: one recombinant chromatid is dicentric (it acquires two centromeres), and the other is acentric (it lacks a centromere). These carry complementary duplications and deletions spanning the crossover region due to the inversion-loop configuration.\n\nAt anaphase I, the dicentric chromatid forms a bridge that typically breaks, and the acentric fragment is not pulled to a pole because it lacks a centromere. Consequently, the two recombinant chromatids lead to gametes with large deletions and duplications and are non-viable. By contrast, the two nonrecombinant chromatids (one wild-type, one inverted) segregate normally and yield viable gametes.\n\nTherefore, after meiosis completes, the four resulting gametes consist of one carrying the wild-type chromosome, one carrying the inverted chromosome, and two non-viable gametes containing chromosomes with significant deletions. This matches option A. Option E incorrectly describes immediate products of crossing over (dicentric and acentric) as if they were final gametes; such products do not persist as viable gametes after meiosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1475890"}, {"introduction": "Structural abnormalities can also serve as powerful tools in genetic analysis. Reciprocal translocations, where segments are exchanged between non-homologous chromosomes, create unique segregation patterns during meiosis that geneticists can exploit. This problem puts you in the role of a researcher, using a known translocation stock in a classic experimental design to determine the chromosomal location of a new mutation, a phenomenon known as pseudolinkage [@problem_id:1475922].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a newly discovered autosomal recessive mutation, `pale eyes` (`pe`), in a fictional diploid insect, the Crimson Beetle (*Coleoptera sanguinea*). The wild-type allele, `pe+`, confers the normal crimson eye color. The beetle has four pairs of chromosomes (2n=8), which are numbered 1 through 4.\n\nTo determine which chromosome carries the `pe` gene, the geneticist utilizes a true-breeding stock that is homozygous for a known balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of Chromosome 2 and Chromosome 3. This stock is denoted as `T(2;3)` and has a wild-type crimson eye phenotype.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  A true-breeding beetle with pale eyes and a normal karyotype (no translocation) is crossed with a beetle from the true-breeding `T(2;3)` stock (which has crimson eyes).\n2.  The resulting F1 progeny, all of which exhibit crimson eyes, are then testcrossed to beetles from the original pale-eyed, normal karyotype stock.\n\nThe F1 female meiosis produces gametes that result in viable offspring only when a balanced set of chromosomal material is segregated (a pattern known as alternate segregation). Gametes resulting from other segregation patterns are assumed to produce non-viable embryos.\n\nUpon analyzing a large number of the testcross progeny, the geneticist observes a distinct pattern: all offspring exhibiting pale eyes are found to possess a normal, non-translocated karyotype. Conversely, all offspring exhibiting the wild-type crimson eyes are found to be heterozygous for the `T(2;3)` translocation.\n\nBased on this evidence, what is the most precise conclusion about the chromosomal location of the `pe` gene?\n\nA. The `pe` gene is located on Chromosome 1.\n\nB. The `pe` gene is located on Chromosome 2.\n\nC. The `pe` gene is located on Chromosome 3.\n\nD. The `pe` gene is located on either Chromosome 2 or Chromosome 3.\n\nE. The `pe` gene is located on Chromosome 4.", "solution": "Define the allele symbols: $pe^{+}$ is wild type (crimson), $pe$ is recessive (pale). The pale-eyed stock is true-breeding and normal karyotype, so its genotype is $pe/pe$ on all homologs with normal chromosomes. The $T(2;3)$ stock is true-breeding for the balanced reciprocal translocation and has crimson eyes, so its genotype is $pe^{+}/pe^{+}$ with both homologs carrying the translocated arrangement for Chromosomes $2$ and $3$.\n\nCross 1 (parental cross): normal $pe/pe$ (no translocation) $\\times$ $pe^{+}/pe^{+}$ (homozygous $T(2;3)$).\n- For Chromosomes $2$ and $3$, the F1 are translocation heterozygotes because they receive one normal set $(N2,N3)$ from the normal parent and the two reciprocal translocation derivatives $(T2',T3')$ from the $T(2;3)$ parent, forming the standard quadrivalent at meiosis.\n- For the $pe$ locus, if it lies on Chromosome $2$ or $3$, the alleles in the F1 are in coupling with the karyotype sets: the $pe$ allele resides on the normal homolog(s) $(N2$ or $N3)$ inherited from the pale-eyed parent, and the $pe^{+}$ allele resides on the translocated homolog(s) $(T2'$ or $T3')$ inherited from the $T(2;3)$ parent. The F1 are $pe^{+}/pe$ and thus phenotypically crimson, consistent with the observation.\n\nPrinciple of segregation in a translocation heterozygote: At meiosis in the F1, the reciprocal translocation between Chromosomes $2$ and $3$ produces a quadrivalent. Under the stated assumption, only alternate segregation yields balanced gametes that are viable; adjacent segregation products are inviable. The two balanced gamete types from alternate segregation are:\n- The normal set: $(N2+N3)$ together.\n- The translocated set: $(T2'+T3')$ together.\nThese are the only viable gametes contributed by the F1.\n\nTestcross: Each F1 is testcrossed to a pale-eyed, normal karyotype parent $pe/pe$ with $(N2,N3)$.\n- If $pe$ is on Chromosome $2$ or $3$, then:\n  - F1 gamete of type $(N2+N3)$ carries the $pe$ allele (from the pale-eyed normal parent). The zygote receives $pe$ from the F1 and $pe$ from the tester, giving $pe/pe$ (pale). Its karyotype for $2$ and $3$ is normal (both parents contribute normal chromosomes for these), matching the observed class: all pale-eyed offspring are normal karyotype.\n  - F1 gamete of type $(T2'+T3')$ carries the $pe^{+}$ allele (from the translocation parent). The zygote is $pe^{+}/pe$ (crimson). Its karyotype for $2$ and $3$ is heterozygous for $T(2;3)$ (inherits translocated derivatives from the F1 and normal from the tester), matching the observed class: all crimson-eyed offspring are $T(2;3)$ heterozygotes.\n\nThus, when the $pe$ locus is on either Chromosome $2$ or $3$, the only viable progeny classes exactly reproduce the observed association: pale phenotype always with a normal karyotype, and crimson phenotype always with translocation heterozygosity.\n\nNow consider the alternative that $pe$ lies on a chromosome not involved in the translocation (Chromosome $1$ or $4$). In that case, the F1 are $pe^{+}/pe$ on Chromosome $1$ or $4$, and the $pe$ locus segregates independently of the $T(2;3)$ quadrivalent on Chromosomes $2$ and $3$. Among the viable offspring (from alternate segregation), both karyotype classes (normal and $T(2;3)$ heterozygote) would occur with both eye colors because the $pe$ allele assortment would be independent. This contradicts the complete association observed between eye color and $T(2;3)$ karyotype.\n\nTherefore, the data exclude Chromosomes $1$ and $4$ and place $pe$ on a chromosome involved in the $T(2;3)$ translocation. The reciprocal translocation involves both Chromosomes $2$ and $3$, and the observed pattern cannot distinguish whether $pe$ resides on Chromosome $2$ or on Chromosome $3$. Hence the most precise conclusion is that $pe$ is located on either Chromosome $2$ or Chromosome $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1475922"}]}
