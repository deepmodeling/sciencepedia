This first practice presents a foundational scenario to track the consequences of a single mistake during meiosis. By working through what happens when a pair of homologous chromosomes fails to separate during the first meiotic division, you will build a clear model of how chromosomally imbalanced gametes—some with an extra chromosome ($n+1$) and some missing one ($n-1$)—are formed [@problem_id:1469112].", "problem": "A research team is studying the genetics of a novel model organism, a species of fruit fly named *Drosophila experimentum*. The normal somatic cells of this fly are diploid and contain a total of 8 chromosomes ($2n=8$). During a cytological analysis of gametogenesis in one particular male, the team identifies an error in a single primary spermatocyte. In this cell, one pair of homologous chromosomes fails to separate during the anaphase of the first meiotic division. All other aspects of both the first and second meiotic divisions proceed without any further errors.\n\nWhich of the following sets correctly represents the chromosome numbers of the four spermatids that would result from this single, aberrant meiotic event?\n\nA. {5, 5, 3, 3}\n\nB. {4, 4, 5, 3}\n\nC. {4, 4, 4, 4}\n\nD. {9, 9, 7, 7}\n\nE. {6, 6, 2, 2}", "solution": "The organism has diploid somatic cells with $2n=8$, so the normal haploid number is $n=4$. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. A nondisjunction in anaphase I for one homologous pair means both homologs of that pair migrate to the same pole. Consequently, after meiosis I, the two secondary spermatocytes will have chromosome numbers:\n- One with $n+1=4+1=5$ chromosomes (received both homologs of the nondisjoined pair plus one of each of the remaining pairs).\n- The other with $n-1=4-1=3$ chromosomes (received neither homolog of the nondisjoined pair but one of each of the remaining pairs).\n\nMeiosis II proceeds normally, separating sister chromatids. Normal meiotic division II does not change the chromosome count category derived from meiosis I; it simply segregates sister chromatids of each chromosome to different cells. Therefore:\n- The secondary spermatocyte with $5$ chromosomes yields two spermatids with $5$ chromosomes each.\n- The secondary spermatocyte with $3$ chromosomes yields two spermatids with $3$ chromosomes each.\n\nThus, the four spermatids have chromosome numbers $\\{5,5,3,3\\}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1469112"}, {"introduction": "Now let's apply our understanding to a realistic human genetic puzzle. This exercise combines the concepts of sex-chromosome aneuploidy (Klinefelter syndrome) and X-linked inheritance (colorblindness) to demonstrate how observable traits can act as clues [@problem_id:1469154]. By carefully analyzing the parents' and child's genotypes and phenotypes, you can deduce the precise parental and meiotic origin of the nondisjunction event, a skill central to genetic counseling.", "problem": "In humans, red-green colorblindness is a recessive trait carried on the X chromosome. The allele for normal color vision is denoted by $X^C$, and the allele for colorblindness is denoted by $X^c$. A man who is colorblind and a woman with normal color vision have a child. The woman's father was also colorblind. Their son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, a condition where an individual has the sex chromosomes $XXY$, and is found to have normal color vision.\n\nAssuming the son's aneuploidy is the result of a single nondisjunction event during gametogenesis in one of the parents, which of the following statements correctly identifies the meiotic event responsible?\n\nA. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis I in the father.\n\nB. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis II in the father.\n\nC. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis I in the mother.\n\nD. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis II in the mother.", "solution": "Let the X-linked alleles be $X^{C}$ (normal) and $X^{c}$ (colorblind). The father is colorblind, so his genotype is $X^{c}Y$. The woman has normal vision but her father was colorblind, so she is an obligate carrier: $X^{C}X^{c}$. The son has Klinefelter syndrome ($XXY$) and normal vision.\n\nA son with Klinefelter syndrome ($XXY$) can be produced by either an $XX$ egg fertilized by a $Y$ sperm (maternal nondisjunction) or an $X$ egg fertilized by an $XY$ sperm (paternal nondisjunction).

Neither can result in an $XXY$ son.\n*   **Option A (Paternal Meiosis I)** is possible. An $X^c Y$ sperm fertilizing a maternal $X^C$ egg would result in an $X^C X^c Y$ son with normal vision.\n*   **Option D (Maternal Meiosis II)** is possible. An $X^C X^C$ egg fertilizing a paternal $Y$ sperm would result in an $X^C X^C Y$ son with normal vision.\n*   **Option C (Maternal Meiosis I)** is possible. An $X^C X^c$ egg fertilizing a paternal $Y$ sperm would result in an $X^C X^c Y$ son with normal vision.\n\nBased on the analysis, paternal Meiosis I (A), maternal Meiosis I (C), and maternal Meiosis II (D) are all possible explanations. However, the question asks to identify the single responsible event. In genetic analysis, an error in Meiosis I in a heterozygous parent (like the mother, $X^C X^c$) is confirmed by finding that the child has inherited both different alleles (heterodisomy). In this case, that would mean the son is $X^C X^c Y$. This specific outcome is a direct and complete consequence of a maternal Meiosis I error. While the other scenarios are possible, they depend on which gamete is involved. Therefore, maternal Meiosis I nondisjunction is considered the most definitive explanation and is the standard intended answer for this type of problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1469154"}, {"introduction": "While phenotypic traits provide valuable clues, molecular markers offer a more precise way to pinpoint the origin of aneuploidy. This final practice challenges you to use DNA allele data to distinguish between a nondisjunction event in Meiosis I versus Meiosis II [@problem_id:1469095]. Mastering this distinction is crucial, as it highlights the difference between inheriting two distinct homologous chromosomes (heterodisomy from a Meiosis I error) and two identical sister chromatids (isodisomy from a Meiosis II error), a key principle in genetic diagnostics.", "problem": "In a clinical genetics investigation, a child is diagnosed with a trisomy for a specific autosome.

If the nondisjoining parent is homozygous at the marker, both MI and MII produce the same disomic alleles and the stage cannot be distinguished from a single marker.\n\nWe test each option by constructing the child’s trisomic genotype as the multiset union of the disomic gamete from the nondisjoining parent and the haploid gamete from the other parent.\n\nA.
