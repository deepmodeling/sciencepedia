Both mutations will lead to the deletion of a single amino acid from the polypeptide, resulting in two different, but likely functional, proteins.", "solution": "We treat the given 5' to 3' coding-strand DNA sequence as providing the same codon order as the mRNA (with T replaced by U), and translation begins at the first base. The original coding DNA is:\n5' - ATG GTC AAG CTT GGG TGA - 3'.\nReplacing T with U gives the mRNA:\n5' - AUG GUC AAG CUU GGG UGA - 3'.\nUsing the given codon table, the wild-type translation is:\nAUG (Met), GUC (Val), AAG (Lys), CUU (Leu), GGG (Gly), UGA (Stop),\nso the peptide is Met-Val-Lys-Leu-Gly, then translation terminates at the stop.\n\nFor Mutation 1, a single nucleotide at position 10 is deleted. Deleting one nucleotide within a coding sequence shifts the reading frame from that point forward. Concretely, the original reading-frame grouping is ATG|GTC|AAG|CTT|GGG|TGA; deleting the nucleotide at position 10 (the first base of CTT) yields ATG|GTC|AAG|TTG|GGT|..., demonstrating a frameshift at codon 4. A frameshift alters all downstream codons and typically introduces a stop codon in the new frame relatively soon, leading to premature termination and a truncated protein. Thus, Mutation 1 causes a frameshift and a likely premature stop, producing a severely truncated, nonfunctional protein.\n\nFor Mutation 2, the three-nucleotide codon AAG at positions 7 through 9 is deleted. This is an in-frame deletion of exactly one codon, which preserves the reading frame for all subsequent codons. Specifically, removing AAG from ATG|GTC|AAG|CTT|GGG|TGA gives ATG|GTC|CTT|GGG|TGA, which translates to Met-Val-Leu-Gly-Stop. The protein is missing exactly one amino acid (the Lys) but is otherwise unchanged, and it may retain some function depending on the role of that residue.\n\nComparing to the options, the accurate description is that Mutation 1 causes a frameshift with a premature stop and severe truncation, and Mutation 2 causes an in-frame deletion of one amino acid with possible retention of function.
