This exercise provides a straightforward scenario to solidify your grasp of key vocabulary like aneuploidy, monosomy, and tetrasomy. By calculating the total number of chromosomes based on the haploid number $n$, you will practice applying these core definitions, a crucial first step in mastering the genetics of chromosome number [@problem_id:1475652].", "problem": "In the field of cytogenetics, scientists study the chromosomal makeup of organisms. A research team has recently characterized the genome of a newly discovered species of desert-dwelling rodent. Karyotyping reveals that the haploid number of chromosomes for this species is $n=14$. In a normal, healthy individual, somatic cells are diploid ($2n$). However, errors during meiosis can lead to aneuploidy, a condition where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes.\n\nCalculate the total number of chromosomes that would be found in a somatic cell of two different aneuploid individuals of this species:\nA) An individual with monosomy for one of its autosomes.\nB) An individual with tetrasomy for one of its autosomes.\n\nProvide your answers as an ordered pair of integers $(A, B)$, where $A$ is the chromosome count for the monosomic individual and $B$ is the chromosome count for the tetrasomic individual.", "solution": "The haploid number is given as $n=14$. In a normal somatic cell, the diploid number is $2n$, so the baseline chromosome count is\n$$\n2n=2\\times 14=28.\n$$\nMonosomy for one autosome means one homolog is missing relative to the diploid set, so the total chromosome number becomes\n$$\nA=2n-1=28-1=27.\n$$\nTetrasomy for one autosome means there are four copies of one chromosome instead of two, which is an addition of two chromosomes relative to diploidy, so the total chromosome number becomes\n$$\nB=2n+2=28+2=30.\n$$\nTherefore, the ordered pair is $(27,30)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(27, 30)}$$", "id": "1475652"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying an aneuploidy, geneticists can often pinpoint its origin using molecular tools. This practice problem presents a realistic clinical scenario involving Trisomy 21 and challenges you to act as a genetic analyst, using DNA marker data to deduce when and in which parent the meiotic error occurred [@problem_id:1475621]. This exercise demonstrates the powerful logic of using marker inheritance to distinguish between failures in Meiosis I and Meiosis II, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical diagnostics.", "problem": "A genetic counselor is analyzing a case of Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), a condition caused by the presence of three copies of chromosome 21. To determine the origin of the extra chromosome, a specific DNA marker locus, known to be very close to the centromere of chromosome 21, is analyzed. The analysis reveals the following genotypes for the family:\n\n- Father's genotype: $M_1M_1$\n- Mother's genotype: $M_1M_2$\n- Child's genotype: $M_1M_2M_2$\n\nAssuming this trisomy arose from a single nondisjunction event during gametogenesis in one of the parents, what was the parental origin and meiotic stage of this error?\n\nA. Paternal, Meiosis I\nB. Paternal, Meiosis II\nC. Maternal, Meiosis I\nD. Maternal, Meiosis II\nE. The origin cannot be determined from the information provided.", "solution": "We analyze nondisjunction using the principle that a centromere-proximal marker reflects the type of meiotic error: nondisjunction in meiosis I yields heterodisomy (both homologs present) at centromeric loci, whereas nondisjunction in meiosis II yields isodisomy (two sister chromatids from the same homolog) at centromeric loci. Thus:\n- Meiosis I error in a heterozygous parent produces two different alleles at the centromeric marker.\n- Meiosis II error in a heterozygous parent produces two identical alleles at the centromeric marker.\n\nGiven the genotypes:\n- Father: $M_{1}M_{1}$ (homozygous)\n- Mother: $M_{1}M_{2}$ (heterozygous)\n- Child: $M_{1}M_{2}M_{2}$ (trisomic at the marker)\n\nFirst determine parental origin. The father can contribute only $M_{1}$. A paternal disomic gamete (from either meiosis I or II error) would be $M_{1}M_{1}$ at this locus. Combining with a maternal haploid gamete ($M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$) yields child genotypes $M_{1}M_{1}M_{1}$ or $M_{1}M_{1}M_{2}$. The observed $M_{1}M_{2}M_{2}$ cannot arise from a paternal error because it contains two $M_{2}$ alleles, which the father cannot supply. Therefore, the error is maternal.\n\nNow distinguish meiosis I versus meiosis II for the mother. If the maternal error were meiosis I, the disomic egg would carry both homologs at the centromere, i.e., $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ (heterodisomy). Fertilization by the paternal $M_{1}$ sperm would yield $M_{1}M_{1}M_{2}$ at the marker, which does not match the observed $M_{1}M_{2}M_{2}$. If the maternal error were meiosis II, the disomic egg would carry two sister chromatids from the same homolog at the centromere, i.e., either $M_{1}M_{1}$ or $M_{2}M_{2}$ (isodisomy). Fertilization by the paternal $M_{1}$ sperm would yield either $M_{1}M_{1}M_{1}$ or $M_{1}M_{2}M_{2}$. The observed child genotype $M_{1}M_{2}M_{2}$ matches the latter case. The statement that the marker is very close to the centromere justifies using these centromere-phase patterns without confounding by recombination.\n\nTherefore, the nondisjunction was maternal and occurred in meiosis II.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1475621"}, {"introduction": "Modern genetics uses powerful experimental systems and quantitative analysis to understand the functional consequences of aneuploidy on a genome-wide scale. In this problem, you will step into the role of a researcher analyzing data from a sophisticated yeast experiment designed to measure the fitness effects of losing specific chromosomes under stress [@problem_id:1475647]. The key challenge lies in interpreting the data to isolate the *environment-specific* effects from general fitness costs, a skill essential for drawing accurate conclusions from complex biological datasets.", "problem": "A team of geneticists is investigating the impact of aneuploidy on cellular stress response in the diploid yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. They have engineered a collection of 16 specialized strains. In each strain, a different one of the 16 yeast chromosomes (labeled I to XVI) has had its centromere (`CEN`) sequence flanked by `loxP` recombination sites. All strains also contain the gene for Cre recombinase under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter (`GAL1`). When these strains are grown in a medium containing galactose, Cre recombinase is expressed, which then excises the `CEN` sequence from the targeted chromosome. The resulting acentric chromosome is rapidly lost during cell division, efficiently generating a population of cells that are monosomic for that specific chromosome.\n\nTo quantify the fitness effects, the researchers performed the following experiment. They first induced chromosome loss in all 16 strains, as well as in a wild-type (WT) diploid control strain that lacks any `loxP` sites. The resulting cell populations were then plated onto two different solid media types: a standard rich medium (Control) and an identical medium supplemented with a high concentration of Sodium Chloride (Stress). After 48 hours of incubation, the average colony area was measured for each strain on each medium type, serving as a proxy for cellular fitness. The collected data are presented in the table below.\n\nYour task is to analyze this dataset to determine which chromosome, when lost, causes the most significant *salt-specific* fitness defect. A salt-specific defect is a reduction in fitness under salt stress that is disproportionately larger than any general fitness reduction observed under control conditions.\n\n| Chromosome (Monosomy) | Average Colony Area (Control, mm²) | Average Colony Area (Stress, mm²) |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| WT Diploid              | 100.0                                | 80.0                              |\n| I                       | 95.2                                 | 72.4                              |\n| II                      | 88.6                                 | 60.3                              |\n| III                     | 91.5                                 | 68.6                              |\n| IV                      | 85.1                                 | 54.5                              |\n| V                       | 90.3                                 | 69.1                              |\n| VI                      | 82.8                                 | 51.3                              |\n| VII                     | 89.9                                 | 63.8                              |\n| VIII                    | 93.1                                 | 71.2                              |\n| IX                      | 70.5                                 | 14.8                              |\n| X                       | 86.4                                 | 58.8                              |\n| XI                      | 92.2                                 | 65.5                              |\n| XII                     | 45.3                                 | 31.7                              |\n| XIII                    | 87.7                                 | 61.4                              |\n| XIV                     | 94.0                                 | 73.3                              |\n| XV                      | 84.6                                 | 52.4                              |\n| XVI                     | 90.8                                 | 66.3                              |\n\nBased on your analysis of the provided data, which monosomy results in the most severe salt-specific fitness defect?\n\nA.
