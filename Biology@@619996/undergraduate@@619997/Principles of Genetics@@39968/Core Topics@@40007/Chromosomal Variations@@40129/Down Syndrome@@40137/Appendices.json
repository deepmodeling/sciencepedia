[@problem_id:1484880]", "problem": "A diploid human germ-line cell, which contains 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, is set to undergo meiosis to produce four gametes. For the purposes of this problem, let's focus on chromosome 21. The first meiotic division (Meiosis I) proceeds perfectly, resulting in two intermediate cells. Following this, only one of these two intermediate cells experiences a single nondisjunction event during the second meiotic division (Meiosis II), where the sister chromatids of chromosome 21 fail to separate properly. The other intermediate cell completes Meiosis II without any errors.\n\nAneuploidy is defined as the state of possessing an abnormal number of copies of a particular chromosome. Considering all four final gametes produced from this single initial cell, what fraction of them are aneuploid for chromosome 21?\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes; with perfect Meiosis I, each of the two intermediate cells receives one homolog of chromosome 21, still composed of two sister chromatids.\n\nIn Meiosis II, sister chromatids are supposed to separate. In the intermediate cell that undergoes nondisjunction for chromosome 21, both sister chromatids go to the same pole. This yields two gametes:\n- one gamete with two copies of chromosome 21 (disomic for 21; aneuploid),\n- one gamete with zero copies of chromosome 21 (nullisomic for 21; aneuploid).\n\nIn the other intermediate cell, Meiosis II proceeds normally, yielding two gametes each with exactly one copy of chromosome 21 (euploid for 21).\n\nThus, among the four total gametes, exactly two are aneuploid for chromosome 21.

Meiosis II nondisjunction; crossover between D21S12 and D21S13.\n\nF. Meiosis I nondisjunction; no crossover occurred.\n\nG. Meiosis II nondisjunction; no crossover occurred.", "solution": "We first restate the marker order on chromosome 21: Centromere -- D21S11 -- D21S12 -- D21S13. The father is homozygous at all three STRs, so the non-paternal (third) allele at each locus in the child must come from the duplicated maternal chromatids. The observed genotypes are:\n- D21S11: mother (1, 2), child (1, 1, 7). The two maternal alleles in the child are both 1 (isodisomy).\n- D21S12: mother (3, 4), child (3, 4, 8). The two maternal alleles in the child are 3 and 4 (heterodisomy).\n- D21S13: mother (5, 6), child (5, 6, 9). The two maternal alleles in the child are 5 and 6 (heterodisomy).\n\nPrinciple relating nondisjunction stage to disomy patterns:\n- In meiosis I nondisjunction (failure of homologs to segregate), the ovum receives two different maternal homologs. Therefore, at loci near the centromere (where no recombination can make sister chromatids differ), the duplicated maternal alleles are typically different (heterodisomy).\n- In meiosis II nondisjunction (failure of sister chromatids to segregate), the ovum receives two sister chromatids from the same homolog. Sister chromatids are identical at and around the centromere, so the duplicated maternal alleles are the same (isodisomy) at centromere-proximal loci. If a crossover occurred in meiosis I between homologs, the two sister chromatids differ distal to the crossover point, yielding heterodisomy distal to the crossover and isodisomy proximal to it.\n\nApply this to the data:\n- At the most centromere-proximal marker D21S11, the child shows maternal isodisomy (both maternal alleles are 1). This pattern at a centromere-proximal locus is diagnostic of meiosis II nondisjunction.\n- At the distal markers D21S12 and D21S13, the child shows maternal heterodisomy (3 and 4; 5 and 6). In meiosis II nondisjunction, this indicates that a crossover occurred in meiosis I between the centromere and the first locus that shows heterodisomy.\n\nLocalizing the crossover:\n- The transition from isodisomy at D21S11 to heterodisomy at D21S12 implies that the single crossover occurred between D21S11 and D21S12. If the crossover had been between D21S12 and D21S13, we would expect isodisomy at D21S12 and a possible change at D21S13, which is not observed. If no crossover had occurred, we would observe isodisomy at all loci, which is contradicted by heterodisomy at D21S12 and D21S13.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is meiosis II nondisjunction with a single crossover between D21S11 and D21S12.
