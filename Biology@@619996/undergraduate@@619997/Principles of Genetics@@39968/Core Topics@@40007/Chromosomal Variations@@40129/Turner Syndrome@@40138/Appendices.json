{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the origin of a genetic condition is a fundamental skill in clinical genetics. This problem challenges you to act like a genetic counselor, using information about an X-linked trait—color vision—within a family to determine whether the meiotic error leading to Turner syndrome occurred in the mother or the father. This practice sharpens your ability to apply the principles of X-linked inheritance and nondisjunction to solve a real-world diagnostic puzzle [@problem_id:1533575].", "problem": "In a clinical genetics consultation, a family's genetic makeup is analyzed to understand the origin of their daughter's condition. The daughter has been diagnosed with Turner syndrome, a condition characterized by the presence of a single X chromosome and the absence of a second sex chromosome (genotype $XO$).\n\nFor a particular X-linked gene related to red-green color vision, there are two alleles: a dominant allele for normal color vision, denoted $X^{CV}$, and a recessive allele for color blindness, denoted $X^{cv}$.\n\nGenetic testing and phenotype analysis reveal the following:\n- The father has normal color vision.\n- The mother is colorblind.\n- The daughter, who has Turner syndrome, is also colorblind.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly identifies the origin of the chromosomal error?\n\nA. The nondisjunction event occurred in the mother.\nB. The nondisjunction event occurred in the father.\nC. The nondisjunction could have occurred in either parent; the provided information is insufficient to distinguish.\nD. A mitotic error occurred in the zygote after fertilization, not a meiotic error in a parent.\nE. The nondisjunction occurred in both parents simultaneously.", "solution": "We use principles of X-linked inheritance and meiotic nondisjunction.\n\nLet the X-linked alleles be $X^{CV}$ (dominant, normal vision) and $X^{cv}$ (recessive, colorblind). Because the father is a phenotypically normal male, his genotype must be $X^{CV}Y$. Because the mother is a colorblind female, she must be homozygous recessive, $X^{cv}X^{cv}$.\n\nThe daughter has Turner syndrome, so her karyotype is $XO$. She is colorblind, so the single X she carries must be $X^{cv}$. Therefore, the daughter’s genotype is $X^{cv}O$. This immediately implies that the X chromosome present in the daughter is maternal (since the father’s only X is $X^{CV}$, which would confer normal vision if present).\n\nHence, the missing sex chromosome must have been the paternal contribution. We analyze which parental nondisjunction can produce an $XO$ zygote with the observed phenotype:\n\n1) Maternal nondisjunction: A nondisjunction in the mother can produce eggs that are $XX$ or $O$. For an $XO$ daughter to result from maternal nondisjunction, the $O$ egg must be fertilized by a paternal $X$ sperm, yielding $X^{CV}O$. This would produce a Turner daughter with normal color vision, contradicting the observation of color blindness. Therefore, maternal nondisjunction cannot explain the observed $X^{cv}O$ colorblind Turner daughter given a normal-vision father.\n\n2) Paternal nondisjunction: A nondisjunction in the father can produce sperm that are $XY$ or $O$. Fertilization of a normal maternal $X^{cv}$ egg by an $O$ sperm yields $X^{cv}O$, precisely matching the daughter’s Turner karyotype and colorblind phenotype. Thus, the data are consistent with paternal nondisjunction producing a nullisomic ($O$) sperm.\n\n3) Post-zygotic mitotic error: A mitotic error after fertilization starting from a zygote with two sex chromosomes typically produces mosaicism (e.g., $XO/XX$), not a uniform $XO$ line in all cells; furthermore, starting from $X^{CV}X^{cv}$, loss of the paternal $X^{CV}$ in all cells to produce uniform $X^{cv}O$ is not the expected outcome and is not required to explain the data. The straightforward and sufficient explanation is paternal meiotic nondisjunction.\n\nTherefore, the nondisjunction event occurred in the father.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533575"}, {"introduction": "The clinical features of Turner syndrome arise from an abnormal dose of specific genes. This exercise explores the molecular consequences of having a single X chromosome by focusing on a gene located in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1), an area that normally escapes X-inactivation. By calculating the expected gene expression level, you will gain a quantitative understanding of haploinsufficiency—the concept that having only a single functional copy of a gene can be insufficient for normal function—which is a key molecular mechanism underlying the syndrome's phenotype [@problem_id:1533557].", "problem": "In human genetics, a key mechanism for dosage compensation between sexes is X-chromosome inactivation, where one of the two X chromosomes in a 46,XX female is randomly and largely silenced. However, certain regions of the X chromosome escape this inactivation. One such region is the Pseudoautosomal Region 1 (PAR1), which is homologous to a region on the Y chromosome and is crucial for proper chromosome pairing during meiosis. Genes located in PAR1 are expressed from both X chromosomes in females.\n\nConsider a typical diploid somatic cell. A standard autosomal gene (a gene not on a sex chromosome) is present in two copies (alleles), and their combined activity results in a normalized expression level of 100 arbitrary units. Now, consider a hypothetical gene, which we will call `Dosage-Sensitive Kinase` (`DSK`), located within the PAR1 region of the X chromosome. Assume that the expression level per active allele of `DSK` is identical to the expression level per active allele of a standard autosomal gene.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the predicted total expression level of the `DSK` gene in a somatic cell from an individual with Turner syndrome, whose karyotype is 45,X. Express your answer in arbitrary units.", "solution": "Define the per-allele expression of any gene as $E_{\\text{allele}}$. By assumption, a standard autosomal gene has two active alleles whose combined expression is $100$ arbitrary units. Therefore,\n$$\n2\\,E_{\\text{allele}}=100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_{\\text{allele}}=\\frac{100}{2}=50.\n$$\nFor the gene $DSK$ in PAR1:\n- PAR1 escapes X inactivation, so each present allele is active.\n- In a 45,X individual, there is only one X chromosome and no Y chromosome, hence only one PAR1 copy of $DSK$ is present and active.\n\nThus, the total $DSK$ expression is the number of active alleles times the per-allele expression:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}}=1 \\times E_{\\text{allele}}=1 \\times 50=50.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$", "id": "1533557"}, {"introduction": "Turner syndrome encompasses a range of chromosomal findings beyond the classic 45,X karyotype. This problem introduces a common structural variant, the isochromosome $i(Xq)$, which involves the loss of the short arm (Xp) and duplication of the long arm (Xq). Analyzing the gene dosage in an individual with a $46,X,i(Xq)$ karyotype will challenge you to think beyond simple monosomy and appreciate how different structural arrangements can create complex imbalances, resulting in both monosomy for some genes and trisomy for others on the very same chromosome [@problem_id:1533609].", "problem": "In human genetics, the short arm of a chromosome is designated as the 'p' arm (from the French *petit*), and the long arm is the 'q' arm.

Classic Turner syndrome results from a 45,X karyotype, where an individual has only one X chromosome.\n\nA significant variant of Turner syndrome involves the formation of an isochromosome. An isochromosome is an abnormal chromosome with two identical arms (either two short arms or two long arms) due to a transverse, rather than longitudinal, division of the centromere during cell division.\n\nConsider an individual with a karyotype of $46,X,i(Xq)$.
