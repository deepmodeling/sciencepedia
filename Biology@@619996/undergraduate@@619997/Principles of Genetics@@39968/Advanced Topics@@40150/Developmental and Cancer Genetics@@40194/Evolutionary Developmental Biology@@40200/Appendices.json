{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The blueprint for an animal's body is established by a set of master control genes, known as homeotic or *Hox* genes, which assign a unique identity to each segment along the body axis. This exercise explores the profound consequences of altering the expression domains of these powerful genes. By predicting the outcome of a \"gain-of-function\" mutation, you will engage with the core principle of homeotic transformation, a fundamental mechanism driving the evolution of diverse body plans [@problem_id:1487558].", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of insect, *Coleoptera imaginarium*, the body plan is segmented along an anterior-posterior axis into a head, a three-segment thorax (T1, T2, T3), and an abdomen. The development of each segment's unique structures is controlled by a family of homeotic genes.\n\nOne of these genes, which we will call *Mesothorax-identity* (*Mti*), is normally expressed exclusively in the second thoracic segment (T2). The function of the *Mti* gene is to direct the development of the primary pair of wings and a pair of walking legs characteristic of the T2 segment. The head contains a segment which, under normal development, gives rise to a pair of sensory antennae.\n\nA geneticist discovers a dominant, gain-of-function mutation in the regulatory region of the *Mti* gene. This mutation causes the *Mti* gene to be ectopically expressed in the developing head segment that normally forms antennae, in addition to its normal expression in the T2 segment. Assuming the resulting organism is viable and develops to the adult stage, what is the most likely morphological outcome of this mutation?\n\nA. The insect will develop an additional, non-functional head where the T2 segment should be.\n\nB. The T2 segment will fail to develop legs and wings, as the gene product is diluted by being expressed in two locations.\n\nC. The insect will be born without antennae, as the ectopic gene expression is lethal to the cells of the antennal imaginal disc.\n\nD. The insect will develop a pair of legs on its head in place of the normal antennae.\n\nE. The insect will develop a second pair of wings on its head.", "solution": "Homeotic genes specify segment identity along the anterior-posterior axis; when such a gene is ectopically expressed (gain-of-function in a novel domain), it can homeotically transform the affected segment toward the identity normally specified by that gene. The given gene, Mti, is normally expressed in T2 and directs the development of T2-specific structures: the primary pair of wings and a pair of walking legs. The mutation causes Mti to be expressed ectopically in the head segment that normally forms antennae, without removing its normal expression in T2.\n\nBy the principle of homeotic transformation, ectopic Mti in the antennal segment will impose T2 identity programs onto the antennal primordium. In insects, the antennal appendage is developmentally homologous to a leg primordium; ectopic expression of a T2 identity gene in the antennal disc is known to convert antennae into legs, as classically observed for Antennapedia misexpression. There is no reason to expect loss of function in T2 due to “dilution,” since regulatory gain-of-function in the head does not necessarily reduce transcription in T2. Ectopic expression is not inherently lethal to the antennal disc; rather, it redirects fate. Although T2 identity includes wings, wings originate from a dorsal thoracic wing field that is absent from the head; wing development requires additional regional selector inputs and imaginal disc context that the head does not provide. Therefore, the realistic transformation is legs in place of antennae, not a second pair of wings or an extra head.\n\nThus, the most likely morphological outcome is the development of a pair of legs on the head in place of normal antennae.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1487558"}, {"introduction": "Evolution doesn't always require inventing new genes; often, it's about teaching old genes new tricks by changing where and when they are turned on. This practice examines how two species can have identical proteins yet display different physical traits, a common theme in evolution. You will need to deduce the most likely molecular mechanism by distinguishing between changes to a gene's protein-coding sequence and its non-coding regulatory regions, such as enhancers [@problem_id:1686135].", "problem": "Two closely related species of fruit fly, *Drosophila picta* and *Drosophila unicolor*, inhabit the same island chain. Males of *D. picta* exhibit distinct, dark spots on the tips of their wings, which are used in courtship displays. Males of *D. unicolor* lack these wing spots entirely. Genetic analysis reveals that the dark pigment is produced by a single gene, which we will call the *pigmentin* gene. Further sequencing shows that the protein-coding sequences of the *pigmentin* gene in both species are 100% identical. The Pigmentin protein is also known to be expressed in the abdomen of both species, where it contributes to typical body coloration.\n\nWhich of the following provides the most direct and parsimonious explanation for why *D. picta* has wing spots while *D. unicolor* does not?\n\nA. A mutation in the core promoter region of the *pigmentin* gene in *D. unicolor* prevents the gene from being transcribed in any tissue.\n\nB. A mutation occurred in a protein-coding exon of the *pigmentin* gene in *D. unicolor*, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nC. A change occurred in a non-coding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence that functions as a wing-specific enhancer for the *pigmentin* gene, rendering it inactive in *D. unicolor*.\n\nD. A mutation arose in a completely different gene that codes for a master transcription factor responsible for wing development, causing a cascade of defects including the loss of pigment in *D. unicolor*.\n\nE. The two species utilize different alternative splicing pathways for the *pigmentin* gene, and the splice variant produced in the wings of *D. unicolor* is non-functional.", "solution": "We are told that males of D. picta have wing spots while males of D. unicolor do not, that a single gene (pigmentin) produces the pigment, that the protein-coding sequences of pigmentin are 100% identical between the two species, and that Pigmentin is expressed in the abdomen of both species. From these data, we infer the following: since the coding sequence is identical, options that require a change in the protein sequence (such as a truncation or loss of function due to a coding mutation) are inconsistent with the evidence. Additionally, since Pigmentin is expressed in the abdomen of both species, the gene is transcriptionally active in at least one tissue in both species, which argues against changes that globally abolish transcription in all tissues.\n\nEvaluate option A: a mutation in the core promoter preventing transcription in any tissue contradicts the observation that Pigmentin is expressed in the abdomen of both species. Therefore A is inconsistent with the data.\n\nEvaluate option B: a mutation in a protein-coding exon causing a truncated, non-functional protein contradicts the statement that the protein-coding sequences are 100% identical between species. Therefore B is excluded by the evidence.\n\nEvaluate option C: a change in a non-coding DNA sequence functioning as a wing-specific enhancer that renders pigmentin inactive in wings of D. unicolor would specifically abolish wing expression while leaving abdominal expression intact and is fully compatible with identical coding sequences. This is a direct, cis-regulatory, tissue-specific explanation that fits all observations and is parsimonious.\n\nEvaluate option D: a mutation in a master transcription factor for wing development would be expected to cause pleiotropic defects beyond pigment loss, making it less parsimonious for a trait difference restricted to pigmentation, and it is a more indirect explanation than a cis-regulatory change at the pigmentin locus.\n\nEvaluate option E: distinct alternative splicing pathways could, in principle, generate a non-functional wing isoform in D. unicolor while preserving abdominal function. However, this requires more complex, tissue-specific splicing regulation changes and is less parsimonious than a single cis-regulatory enhancer change that toggles expression on or off in wings. Moreover, the problem emphasizes identical protein-coding sequences, and the simplest interpretation consistent with both identical coding sequence and preserved abdominal expression is a tissue-specific enhancer change rather than altered splicing leading to a non-functional protein.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and parsimonious explanation is a change in a wing-specific enhancer of the pigmentin gene, as in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1686135"}, {"introduction": "The diverse beak shapes of Darwin's finches are a classic example of adaptive radiation, but what are the precise genetic changes that drive this evolution? This problem places you in the role of a researcher tasked with interpreting a set of complementary experiments. By synthesizing data from gene expression analysis, sequence comparison, and functional tests, you will learn how scientists build a robust argument for the role of regulatory evolution in shaping organismal form [@problem_id:1487583].", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the molecular basis for the evolution of different beak shapes in two species of finches, Species A and Species B. Species A possesses a short, deep beak, ideal for cracking large seeds. Species B possesses a long, pointed beak, suited for probing flowers for nectar. Previous studies have identified two key genes involved in beak development: Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (*Bmp4*), associated with beak depth and width, and Calmodulin (*CaM*), associated with beak length. To determine whether the evolutionary divergence was driven by changes in the protein-coding regions or the non-coding regulatory regions of these genes, the researchers conducted a series of experiments.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Gene Expression Analysis**: Using a technique that measures the amount and location of messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), the researchers found that during a critical stage of embryonic development, Species A (short, deep beak) shows significantly higher levels of *Bmp4* mRNA expression in the developing beak compared to Species B. Conversely, Species B (long, pointed beak) shows significantly higher levels of *CaM* mRNA expression compared to Species A.\n\n2.  **Sequence Comparison**: The researchers sequenced the entire protein-coding regions of both the *Bmp4* and *CaM* genes from multiple individuals of both species. The analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid sequences for the Bmp4 protein are 100% identical between Species A and Species B. The sequences for the CaM protein are also identical between the two species.\n\n3.  **Reciprocal Gene Expression Experiment**: Using a harmless viral vector, the researchers misexpressed the *Bmp4* gene from Species A in the developing beaks of Species B embryos, forcing its expression level to match that typically seen in Species A. The resulting Species B chicks developed beaks that were substantially shorter and deeper than is normal for their species, closely resembling the beak morphology of Species A.\n\nBased on the combined results of these three experiments, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the molecular evolution of beak shape in these finches?\n\nA. The divergence in beak shape is primarily caused by mutations in the coding regions of *Bmp4* and *CaM*, leading to proteins with different functions in each species.\n\nB. The observed beak differences are driven by evolutionary changes in the non-coding regulatory regions that control the expression levels and timing of the *Bmp4* and *CaM* genes.\n\nC. A novel, unidentified gene, not *Bmp4* or *CaM*, is the true cause of the beak differences, and the expression changes in *Bmp4* and *CaM* are merely correlational.\n\nD. Post-translational modifications of the Bmp4 and CaM proteins, which are not detectable by gene sequencing, are responsible for the different beak morphologies.\n\nE. The functions of the Bmp4 and CaM proteins have switched between the two species, such that *Bmp4* now controls length in Species B and *CaM* controls depth in Species A.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the most plausible molecular mechanism for beak shape evolution in the two finch species by synthesizing evidence from three different experiments. The central question is whether the evolution occurred in the coding regions of genes (affecting protein structure/function) or in the regulatory regions (affecting gene expression).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the evidence from each experiment.\n\nExperiment 1: Gene Expression Analysis.\nThis experiment measures the levels of *Bmp4* and *CaM* mRNA. A higher level of mRNA for a particular gene leads to the production of more of its corresponding protein. The finding that Species A (deep beak) has more *Bmp4* mRNA and Species B (long beak) has more *CaM* mRNA establishes a strong correlation between the expression level of these specific genes and the resulting physical trait (phenotype). Differences in mRNA levels between species for the same gene are typically caused by differences in the non-coding regulatory regions (e.g., enhancers, promoters) that control when, where, and how much a gene is transcribed into mRNA. This result strongly points towards regulatory evolution.\n\nExperiment 2: Sequence Comparison.\nThis experiment examines the protein-coding regions of the genes to see if the proteins themselves have changed. The result shows that the amino acid sequences for both the Bmp4 and CaM proteins are identical in both species. This means the \"blueprints\" for the protein machinery are the same. If the proteins themselves have not changed, then it is highly unlikely that differences in their intrinsic function are responsible for the different beak shapes. This result argues strongly against evolution in the coding regions.\n\nExperiment 3: Reciprocal Gene Expression Experiment.\nThis experiment directly tests for causality and the conservation of protein function. By forcing the *Bmp4* gene from Species A to be expressed at high levels in Species B, researchers are essentially asking: \"If we change the *regulation* of the gene in Species B to mimic Species A, do we get Species A's beak?\" The result is that Species B embryos develop a beak resembling Species A's. This is a crucial finding for two reasons:\n1.  It demonstrates a causal link: The level of *Bmp4* expression directly causes a change in beak depth. This refutes the idea that the gene is merely correlated with the trait.\n2.  It shows that the Bmp4 protein's *function* is conserved. The protein made in Species B (from its own gene, but just expressed highly due to the virus) acts to increase beak depth, the same function associated with it in Species A. If the protein functions had diverged, expressing the gene would not be expected to produce the other species' phenotype so cleanly.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this synthesis:\n\nA. The divergence is caused by mutations in coding regions leading to different protein functions. This is directly contradicted by Experiment 2, which found identical protein sequences.\n\nB. The divergence is driven by changes in non-coding regulatory regions controlling gene expression. This is strongly supported by all three experiments. Experiment 1 shows a difference in expression. Experiment 2 shows no difference in protein sequence, pointing away from the coding region. Experiment 3 confirms that changing only the expression level is sufficient to change the phenotype, confirming that regulation is the key. This is the most likely conclusion.\n\nC. A novel, unidentified gene is the true cause. This is contradicted by Experiment 3, which establishes a causal role for *Bmp4*. By manipulating *Bmp4* expression alone, the researchers were able to change the phenotype, showing it is a causative agent, not just a bystander.\n\nD. Post-translational modifications are responsible. While post-translational modifications can affect protein function, there is no evidence presented in the problem to support this hypothesis. The principle of parsimony suggests we should favor the explanation for which we have strong positive evidence. The evidence for regulatory change is direct and compelling, making this speculative alternative less likely.\n\nE. The functions of the proteins have switched. This is contradicted by Experiment 3. When *Bmp4* is overexpressed in Species B, it makes the beak deeper, which is its \"normal\" associated function in Species A. It does not affect length. This shows the function is conserved, not switched.\n\nTherefore, the combined evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the evolution of different beak shapes was driven by changes in the regulatory DNA that controls the amount of *Bmp4* and *CaM* protein produced, rather than changes in the proteins themselves.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487583"}]}
