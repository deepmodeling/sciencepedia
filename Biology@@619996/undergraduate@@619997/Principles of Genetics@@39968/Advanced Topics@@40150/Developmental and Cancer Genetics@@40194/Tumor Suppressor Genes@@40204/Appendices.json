{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp the function of tumor suppressor genes, we can start with one of the most well-studied examples: the Retinoblastoma protein ($Rb$). It acts as a critical gatekeeper, preventing cells from progressing from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle unless conditions are right. This exercise [@problem_id:1533322] employs a thought experiment involving a hypothetical, permanently active $Rb$ protein to challenge your understanding of this molecular 'brake' and its interaction with key cell cycle regulators.", "problem": "The cell cycle is a tightly regulated process ensuring faithful replication and division. A crucial control point is the G1/S checkpoint, which governs the transition from the cell growth phase (G1) to the DNA synthesis phase (S). A key protein in this process is the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a product of the *RB1* tumor suppressor gene. In its active, hypophosphorylated state, Rb binds to and sequesters the transcription factor E2F. This prevents E2F from activating the transcription of genes essential for S phase entry. For a cell to proceed into S phase, Rb must be inactivated via phosphorylation by cyclin/CDK complexes, causing it to release E2F.\n\nImagine a research team discovers a cell line with a specific point mutation in the *RB1* gene. This mutation leads to the production of an Rb protein that is permanently unable to be phosphorylated, even in the presence of active cyclin/CDK complexes.\n\nWhat is the most direct and immediate consequence for a cell carrying only this specific mutation?\n\nA. The cell will be arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\n\nB. The cell will proceed through the G1/S checkpoint and undergo uncontrolled proliferation.\n\nC. The expression of E2F target genes will be constitutively active, regardless of growth signals.\n\nD. The M-phase checkpoint will be activated, causing an arrest in mitosis.\n\nE. The cell will immediately enter apoptosis due to aberrant signaling.", "solution": "Principle: In G1, hypophosphorylated Rb binds E2F and represses transcription of S-phase genes. Passage through the G1/S checkpoint requires phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin/CDK complexes, which inactivates Rb, causing release of E2F and activation of genes necessary for DNA synthesis.\n\nGiven mutation: Rb is permanently unable to be phosphorylated. Functionally, this locks Rb in its active, E2F-binding state. Because cyclin/CDK complexes cannot phosphorylate Rb, they cannot relieve E2F repression. As a result, E2F remains sequestered, transcription of S-phase genes remains off, and the G1/S transition cannot occur.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is correct: the cell cannot pass the G1/S checkpoint because E2F remains inhibited, leading to G1 arrest.\n- B is incorrect: uncontrolled proliferation would require constitutive E2F activity (e.g., Rb loss-of-function or inability to bind E2F), not non-phosphorylatable Rb that continuously suppresses E2F.\n- C is incorrect: E2F target gene expression would be constitutively repressed, not active.\n- D is incorrect: the M-phase checkpoint pertains to spindle assembly and chromosome attachment, not G1/S control.\n- E is incorrect as the most direct and immediate effect; while prolonged arrest can trigger senescence or apoptosis via pathways such as p53, the immediate consequence is G1 arrest.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is arrest in G1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1533322"}, {"introduction": "The discovery of tumor suppressor genes led to the 'two-hit hypothesis,' which posits that both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated for a cell to become cancerous. While the first 'hit' can be an inherited mutation, the second often occurs through a specific genetic event in a somatic cell. This next practice [@problem_id:1533319] delves into the diverse molecular and chromosomal mechanisms that can cause this 'Loss of Heterozygosity' (LOH), turning a predisposed heterozygous cell into one that has lost its critical protection.", "problem": "Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder characterized by the early onset of colon cancer. It is caused by a germline mutation in the *Adenomatous Polyposis Coli* (*APC*) gene, a tumor suppressor located on chromosome 5. According to the two-hit hypothesis, an individual who inherits one non-functional allele ($APC^-$) is heterozygous ($APC^+/APC^-$) in all their somatic cells and is predisposed to cancer. For a tumor to develop in a colon cell, the second, functional allele ($APC^+$) must also be inactivated, a process known as Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).\n\nWhich of the following genetic or chromosomal events, occurring during somatic cell division in a colon cell, could lead to Loss of Heterozygosity for the *APC* gene? Select all options that apply.\n\nA. Mitotic recombination between the centromere of chromosome 5 and the *APC* gene locus.\n\nB. A new frameshift mutation occurring within a non-coding intron of the functional $APC^+$ allele.\n\nC. Nondisjunction of chromosome 5, leading to the loss of the chromosome carrying the $APC^+$ allele, followed by a duplication of the remaining chromosome 5.\n\nD. A reciprocal translocation event that moves the entire functional $APC^+$ allele and its surrounding chromosomal region to chromosome 12.\n\nE. An interstitial deletion event that removes the portion of chromosome 5 containing the functional $APC^+$ allele.\n\nF. A global, genome-wide increase in DNA methylation that does not target any specific gene promoter.", "solution": "We begin with the two-hit tumor suppressor model: an individual with a germline $APC$ mutation is $APC^{+}/APC^{-}$ in all somatic cells. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the $APC$ locus in a colon cell is achieved when the $APC^{+}$ allele is no longer present as a distinct allele in that cell, yielding either $APC^{-}/APC^{-}$ (homozygosity of the mutant allele) or $APC^{-}/-$ (hemizygosity for the mutant allele). By definition, LOH is a genetic event that reduces heterozygosity at polymorphic markers around the locus, typically via deletion, mitotic recombination, gene conversion, or chromosomal loss with reduplication.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Mitotic recombination between the centromere of chromosome 5 and the $APC$ locus can produce reciprocal products such that one daughter cell becomes $APC^{-}/APC^{-}$ for the region distal to the crossover. Starting from $APC^{+}/APC^{-}$, a crossover between centromere and $APC$ can segregate alleles so that one cell inherits two copies of the chromosome arm bearing $APC^{-}$ and loses the $APC^{+}$ arm at that region. This is classical LOH by mitotic recombination. Therefore A leads to LOH.\n\nB. A new frameshift mutation within a non-coding intron of the $APC^{+}$ allele does not alter the coding sequence unless it disrupts essential splicing signals; as stated, it is within a non-coding intron and thus typically does not inactivate the allele. Even if the mutation did inactivate $APC^{+}$, the result would be compound heterozygosity ($APC^{-}$ with a different mutant on the other chromosome), which is not LOH, since heterozygosity at surrounding markers remains. Therefore B does not cause LOH.\n\nC. Nondisjunction that results in loss of the chromosome carrying $APC^{+}$, followed by duplication of the remaining chromosome 5, converts $APC^{+}/APC^{-}$ into $APC^{-}/APC^{-}$ via uniparental disomy. This eliminates the $APC^{+}$ allele and reduces heterozygosity across the chromosome. Therefore C causes LOH.\n\nD. A reciprocal translocation moving the entire intact $APC^{+}$ allele and its surrounding region to chromosome 12 preserves the allele and its function if the region is intact. The cell remains $APC^{+}/APC^{-}$ (heterozygous), just with the $APC^{+}$ segment relocated. This does not reduce heterozygosity at markers flanking $APC$ and is not LOH. Therefore D does not cause LOH.\n\nE. An interstitial deletion that removes the portion of chromosome 5 containing $APC^{+}$ converts $APC^{+}/APC^{-}$ to $-/APC^{-}$ (hemizygosity for the mutant allele), which is LOH for $APC$. Therefore E causes LOH.\n\nF. A global, genome-wide increase in DNA methylation not targeted to specific promoters is an epigenetic change and is not, by itself, a targeted second hit at $APC$. LOH is a genetic loss; non-targeted methylation does not specifically inactivate $APC^{+}$ nor does it reduce heterozygosity at the locus. Therefore F does not cause LOH.\n\nThus, the events that can lead to LOH for $APC$ are A, C, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "1533319"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the cellular level to the whole organism, the distinction between a germline and a somatic mutation has profound consequences for an individual's health and their family. How does inheriting one faulty allele of a tumor suppressor gene from birth compare to acquiring the same mutation in a single skin cell decades later? This final exercise [@problem_id:1533349] presents a scenario that directly contrasts these two situations, allowing you to apply the two-hit model to assess long-term cancer risk and the principles of heritability.", "problem": "The *PTEN* gene is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. Its protein product acts as a phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and preventing uncontrolled cell growth. Loss-of-function mutations in *PTEN* are strongly associated with an increased susceptibility to various types of cancer.\n\nConsider two individuals, Alex and Ben, who are genetically unrelated.\n\n*   **Alex** is born with a germline mutation that inactivates one of his two *PTEN* alleles. This mutation is present in every cell of his body.\n*   **Ben**, who was born with two functional *PTEN* alleles, acquires a somatic mutation at age 30 that inactivates one *PTEN* allele in a single skin cell on his arm due to excessive sun exposure.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately contrasts the long-term cancer risk and heritability for Alex and Ben?\n\nA. Alex has a significantly elevated lifetime risk for a wide spectrum of cancers (e.g., breast, thyroid, endometrial) and has a 50% chance of passing the mutated allele to each of his children. Ben's increased cancer risk is localized primarily to the skin tissue on his arm, and he cannot pass this mutation to his offspring.\n\nB. Both Alex and Ben have an equally elevated risk of developing cancer, as both now have only one functional copy of the *PTEN* gene. The primary difference is that Alex's mutation is heritable, while Ben's is not.\n\nC. Ben has a higher immediate risk of developing skin cancer than Alex has of developing any cancer, because the somatic mutation occurred in a high-risk tissue (sun-exposed skin). Alex's body has compensatory mechanisms in other tissues that reduce his overall risk.\n\nD. Because Alex's mutation is present from birth, his immune system has likely developed a tolerance to the mutated cells, reducing his cancer risk compared to Ben, whose newly mutated cells will be targeted by the immune system.\n\nE. Both Alex and Ben can pass their respective mutations to their offspring through their gametes. However, the penetrance of the cancer phenotype will be higher in Alex's offspring.", "solution": "Tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN follow Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis: at the level of an individual cell, loss-of-function of both alleles is typically required to abrogate tumor suppressor function and drive tumorigenesis. For a germline heterozygous carrier, the first “hit” is present in all cells; any cell needs only one additional somatic event (second “hit,” such as a mutation, deletion, or loss of heterozygosity) to inactivate PTEN completely, thereby substantially increasing cancer risk across many tissues over a lifetime. Germline pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with respect to predisposition, so each child of a heterozygous carrier has probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the mutant allele.\n\nApplying these principles:\n- Alex carries a germline inactivating mutation in one PTEN allele in every cell. This provides the first “hit” everywhere, so the required second hit can arise in many tissues over time, markedly elevating lifetime risk for a broad spectrum of cancers (e.g., breast, thyroid, endometrial) characteristic of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes. Because the variant is germline and the predisposition is autosomal dominant, each child has probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the mutant allele.\n- Ben acquired a somatic mutation in one PTEN allele in a single skin cell at age 30. This provides the first “hit” only in that specific cell lineage; to cause cancer, that clone would still need a second hit. The increased risk is therefore localized to that cell’s descendants in the affected skin region, not systemic. Because the mutation is not present in the germline, Ben cannot transmit it to offspring.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states Alex’s elevated, systemic lifetime risk and $\\frac{1}{2}$ transmission risk, and correctly limits Ben’s risk to the affected skin tissue while noting non-heredity.\n- B is incorrect because Alex’s systemic first hit in all cells confers a far higher lifetime risk than Ben’s single-cell somatic event; their risks are not equal.\n- C is incorrect because a single heterozygous somatic hit in one skin cell does not outweigh the systemic, lifelong elevated risk from a germline first hit across all tissues.\n- D is incorrect because immune tolerance to a germline variant is not the determinant of comparative cancer risk here; the two-hit model and tissue ubiquity of the first hit are.\n- E is incorrect because Ben’s somatic mutation in skin is not heritable.\n\nThus, A is the most accurate contrast of long-term cancer risk and heritability for Alex and Ben.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1533349"}]}
