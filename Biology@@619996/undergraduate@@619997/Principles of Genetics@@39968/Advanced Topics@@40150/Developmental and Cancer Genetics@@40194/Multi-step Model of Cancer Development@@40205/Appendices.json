By calculating the probabilities involved, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why inheriting a single faulty gene provides a crucial \"head start\" on the path to cancer.", "problem": "The Retinoblastoma ($Rb$) gene produces a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell division. For a retinal cell to become cancerous and initiate a tumor, it must lose the function of all its copies of the Rb protein. This requires that every functional wild-type allele ($Rb^{+}$) of the gene within that cell be mutated into a non-functional allele ($Rb^{-}$).\n\nConsider two individuals. Person A has a genotype of $Rb^{+}/Rb^{+}$, meaning both alleles of the $Rb$ gene are wild-type. Person B has a genotype of $Rb^{+}/Rb^{-}$, having inherited one functional and one non-functional allele.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that a single somatic mutation event occurs and inactivates one specific $Rb^{+}$ allele in a single retinal cell over the course of an individual's lifetime. Assume that the mutation events affecting the two alleles in a cell are statistically independent. Furthermore, assume that the probability of a non-functional $Rb^{-}$ allele reverting to a functional $Rb^{+}$ allele is negligible.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the probability that a single retinal cell in Person B will become cancerous to the probability that a single retinal cell in Person A will become cancerous. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $p$.", "solution": "A retinal cell becomes cancerous when all functional $Rb^{+}$ alleles in that cell are inactivated. Let $p$ denote the probability that a given $Rb^{+}$ allele is inactivated by a somatic mutation over a lifetime, and assume independence between alleles with negligible reversion of $Rb^{-}$ to $Rb^{+}$.\n\nFor Person A ($Rb^{+}/Rb^{+}$): both alleles are initially functional. Let $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ be the events that the first and second $Rb^{+}$ alleles are inactivated, respectively. By the definition of $p$ and independence,\n$$\n\\Pr(A_{1})=p,\\quad \\Pr(A_{2})=p,\\quad \\Pr(A_{1}\\cap A_{2})=p^{2}.\n$$\nThus, the probability that a single retinal cell becomes cancerous in Person A is\n$$\nP_{A}=p^{2}.\n$$\n\nFor Person B ($Rb^{+}/Rb^{-}$): only the single functional allele needs to be inactivated. Let $B$ be the event that this $Rb^{+}$ allele is inactivated. Then\n$$\nP_{B}=\\Pr(B)=p.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of probabilities (Person B to Person A) is\n$$\n\\frac{P_{B}}{P_{A}}=\\frac{p}{p^{2}}=\\frac{1}{p}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{p}}$$", "id": "1504874"}, {"introduction": "If cancer requires multiple mutations, what happens when the cell's own quality control machinery breaks down? This practice investigates the concept of a \"mutator phenotype,\" where a defect in a \"caretaker\" gene, like one involved in DNA repair, dramatically accelerates the rate of future mutations. You will analyze a hypothetical scenario to understand how genomic instability can propel a cell much more quickly down the path of malignant transformation.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the principles of carcinogenesis using two cultured human cell lines.\n\n*   **Cell Line A** is the wild-type control, possessing functional copies of all its genes.\n*   **Cell Line B** is genetically identical to Cell Line A, except it harbors a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the *MSH2* gene. The *MSH2* gene product is an essential protein in the DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) system, which corrects errors made during DNA replication.\n\nBoth cell lines are cultured under identical conditions that allow for many generations of cell division. The researcher is interested in the rate at which new, spontaneous mutations will appear in two other genes critical for cancer development: the proto-oncogene *KRAS* and the tumor suppressor gene *TP53*.\n\nBased on your understanding of the multi-step model of cancer and the function of the DNA Mismatch Repair system, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed?\n\nA. There will be no significant difference in the mutation rates of *KRAS* and *TP53* between Cell Line A and Cell Line B, as the MMR system only corrects inherited mutations, not spontaneous ones.\n\nB. Cell Line B will exhibit a significantly increased rate of mutations in *KRAS* and *TP53* compared to Cell Line A.\n\nC. Cell Line B will exhibit a decreased rate of mutation in *KRAS* and *TP53* because the initial *MSH2* defect will trigger permanent cell cycle arrest, preventing new mutations from occurring.\n\nD. Cell Line B will show an increased mutation rate specifically in other DNA repair genes, but the mutation rates in *KRAS* and *TP53* will remain the same as in Cell Line A.\n\nE. Both cell lines will accumulate mutations at an equally high rate, as the absence of environmental mutagens means all mutations are solely due to the inherent fallibility of DNA polymerase.", "solution": "The multi-step model of carcinogenesis posits that cancer arises through the sequential accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The rate at which these driver mutations arise depends not only on exposure to mutagens but also on the fidelity of DNA replication and the efficiency of DNA repair systems. Caretaker genes, such as those in the DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, maintain genomic integrity by correcting replication errors; loss of caretaker function increases the genome-wide mutation rate, thereby accelerating the acquisition of driver mutations.\n\nThe MMR system corrects base-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops introduced by the inherent error rate of DNA polymerases during replication. The MSH2 protein forms part of the MutS complexes that recognize mismatches and initiate repair. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation in *MSH2* abrogates MMR function, leading to unrepaired replication errors, microsatellite instability, and a global increase in spontaneous mutation rate across the genome. This directly contradicts the claim that MMR acts only on inherited mutations; instead, it acts primarily on spontaneous replication errors.\n\nApplying this to the two cell lines:\n- Cell Line A (wild-type) has intact MMR, so many replication errors are detected and repaired, keeping the spontaneous mutation rate low.\n- Cell Line B (*MSH2*-deficient) lacks MMR activity, so replication errors persist and become fixed as mutations during subsequent cell divisions. This increased error fixation occurs genome-wide and therefore elevates the mutation rates in any gene, including the proto-oncogene *KRAS* and the tumor suppressor *TP53*.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because MMR corrects spontaneous replication errors, not just inherited lesions; intact MMR reduces mutation rates relative to MMR deficiency.\n- Option B is correct: MSH2 loss produces a mutator phenotype with a significantly increased mutation rate in *KRAS* and *TP53* compared to wild-type.\n- Option C is incorrect: MMR deficiency does not intrinsically trigger permanent cell cycle arrest; MMR-deficient cells typically continue proliferating, accumulating mutations.\n- Option D is incorrect: the mutation rate increase is not limited to other DNA repair genes; it is genome-wide and includes *KRAS* and *TP53*.\n- Option E is incorrect: even without environmental mutagens, polymerase errors occur; with intact MMR (Cell Line A) many are repaired, whereas in *MSH2*-deficient cells (Cell Line B) they are not, yielding different mutation rates.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that Cell Line B exhibits a significantly increased rate of mutations in *KRAS* and *TP53* compared to Cell Line A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1504879"}, {"introduction": "The multi-step model is not just about accumulating mutations; it's also a story of Darwinian evolution playing out within our tissues. This exercise shifts the focus to clonal expansion, the process by which a single cell with a growth advantage can give rise to a large population. By applying a simple fitness model, you will calculate the number of generations needed for a mutant lineage to begin its takeover, illustrating a critical step in the formation of a detectable tumor.", "problem": "In the context of cancer biology, the multi-step model of tumorigenesis often begins with a single cell acquiring a mutation that provides a growth advantage. Consider a simplified model for the initial clonal expansion of such a cell within a tissue.\n\nA particular tissue is composed of a large, stable population of $N_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}$ normal (wild-type) cells. At generation $g=0$, a single cell in this population acquires a mutation. Assume the cells proliferate in discrete, non-overlapping generations. The mutation confers a small selective advantage, $s = 0.015$, over the wild-type cells. This advantage is modeled by assigning a relative fitness of $w_m = 1+s$ to the mutant cells and a relative fitness of $w_w = 1$ to the wild-type cells. In each subsequent generation, the number of progeny produced by each cell type is directly proportional to its current population size and its relative fitness.\n\nCalculate the number of generations, $g$, required for the population of mutant cells to constitute exactly 50% of the total cell population.
