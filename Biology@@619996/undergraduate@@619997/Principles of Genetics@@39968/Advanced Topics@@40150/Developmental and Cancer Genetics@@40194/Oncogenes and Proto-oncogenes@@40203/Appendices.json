This practice simulates the classic transfection experiment that first answered this question, providing definitive proof for the existence of dominant-acting human oncogenes. By interpreting the results of this foundational assay, you will develop an understanding of cellular transformation and the experimental logic used to identify genes that drive cancer [@problem_id:1507154].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the genetic basis of a highly aggressive form of human bladder carcinoma. The primary hypothesis is that the cancer is driven by a single, dominant, activated oncogene. To test this, the biologist prepares two samples of genomic Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA):\n1.  `T-DNA`: DNA extracted from the cancerous bladder tumor cells.\n2.  `N-DNA`: DNA extracted from normal, non-cancerous bladder tissue from a healthy donor.\n\nThe biologist uses a well-characterized mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH/3T3, for the experiment. These cells normally exhibit contact inhibition, meaning they grow in a flat, single layer (a monolayer) and stop dividing once they cover the surface of the culture dish. The loss of contact inhibition, leading to cells piling up and forming dense clumps known as foci, is a hallmark of cancerous transformation.\n\nThree parallel cultures of NIH/3T3 cells are prepared:\n-   **Culture 1**: Transfected with the `T-DNA`.\n-   **Culture 2**: Transfected with the `N-DNA`.\n-   **Culture 3**: Subjected to a mock transfection procedure (all steps are followed, but no DNA is added).\n\nThe cells are then allowed to grow for several weeks. Assuming the initial hypothesis is correct, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected macroscopic appearance of the three cultures?\n\nA. All three cultures will form uniform monolayers with no foci.\n\nB. All three cultures will show the formation of multiple foci.\n\nC. Culture 1 will form a uniform monolayer, while Cultures 2 and 3 will show the formation of multiple foci.\n\nD. Culture 1 will show the formation of multiple foci, while Cultures 2 and 3 will form uniform monolayers.\n\nE. Cultures 1 and 2 will show the formation of multiple foci, while Culture 3 will form a uniform monolayer.", "solution": "The experimental setup uses NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which are contact-inhibited and thus form a uniform monolayer under normal conditions. Transformation by an activated oncogene leads to loss of contact inhibition, producing macroscopic foci. The hypothesis states that the tumor is driven by a single dominant activated oncogene. Dominant in this context means that introduction of a single active copy into a recipient cell is sufficient to confer a transformed phenotype. Genomic DNA from tumor cells (T-DNA) is therefore expected to contain fragments harboring the activated oncogene such that, upon transfection, a subset of NIH/3T3 cells will integrate and express the oncogene, become transformed, and form foci. Because only a fraction of cells will receive and express the oncogenic fragment, the culture will not be uniformly transformed but will exhibit multiple discrete foci against a background monolayer.\n\nIn contrast, genomic DNA from normal tissue (N-DNA) lacks an activated oncogene; its transfection into NIH/3T3 should not induce transformation, so the culture will retain contact inhibition and remain a uniform monolayer. The mock transfection introduces no DNA, so it also yields a uniform monolayer. Therefore, under the stated hypothesis, only Culture 1 (transfected with T-DNA) is expected to show multiple foci, while Cultures 2 and 3 form uniform monolayers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1507154"}, {"introduction": "Once an oncogene is identified, the next step is to determine how its activity was unleashed. This exercise explores gene amplification, a common mechanism where a proto-oncogene's copy number increases dramatically, through the lens of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), a powerful cytogenetic technique. You will practice interpreting real-world diagnostic data, learning to distinguish true gene amplification from changes in whole chromosome number, a critical skill in molecular pathology [@problem_id:1507203].", "problem": "In molecular oncology, the conversion of a proto-oncogene into an oncogene can drive uncontrolled cell proliferation. One common mechanism for this conversion is gene amplification, where the copy number of a specific proto-oncogene is significantly increased. A pathologist is analyzing a breast cancer biopsy to determine the status of the *ERBB2* gene, a proto-oncogene located on chromosome 17.\n\nTo do this, the pathologist uses a technique called Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This method uses fluorescently labeled Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) probes that bind to specific target sequences on chromosomes within the cell nucleus. For this analysis, two distinct probes are used simultaneously on the interphase nuclei of the tumor cells:\n1. A probe that emits a red signal when bound to the *ERBB2* gene locus.\n2. A control probe that emits a green signal when bound to the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17). The centromere probe is used to count the number of copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n\nA normal, non-cancerous human somatic cell is diploid and is expected to have two copies of chromosome 17. The pathologist examines numerous cells from the biopsy under a fluorescence microscope. Which of the following observations would be the definitive evidence for *ERBB2* gene amplification, as opposed to other chromosomal abnormalities like polysomy (an increase in the number of whole chromosomes)?\n\nA. The majority of cells display exactly 2 red signals and 2 green signals.\n\nB. The majority of cells display approximately 15 red signals and 2 green signals.\n\nC. The majority of cells display 0 red signals and 2 green signals.\n\nD. The majority of cells display exactly 4 red signals and 4 green signals.\n\nE. The majority of cells display 1 red signal and 1 green signal.", "solution": "The goal of this Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis is to determine if the *ERBB2* proto-oncogene has undergone amplification. This requires distinguishing between an increase in the number of genes due to the duplication of the gene itself (amplification) and an increase in the number of genes due to the duplication of the entire chromosome (polysomy).\n\nLet's break down the experimental setup:\n- The red probe targets the *ERBB2* gene. The number of red signals corresponds to the total number of copies of the *ERBB2* gene.\n- The green probe targets the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17). The number of green signals corresponds to the total number of copies of chromosome 17.\n\nA normal diploid cell has two copies of chromosome 17. Therefore, a normal cell would show 2 red signals (for the two copies of the *ERBB2* gene) and 2 green signals (for the two copies of chromosome 17). The ratio of *ERBB2* signals to CEP17 signals is $2/2 = 1.0$.\n\n*ERBB2* gene amplification is characterized by a significant increase in the copy number of the *ERBB2* gene *relative to* the copy number of its host chromosome, chromosome 17. This means we are looking for a scenario where the ratio of red signals to green signals is significantly greater than 1.0.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The majority of cells display exactly 2 red signals and 2 green signals. This pattern represents a normal, diploid cell with no amplification and no chromosomal abnormality. The ratio of red to green signals is $2/2 = 1.0$. This is the baseline for a healthy cell.\n\nB. The majority of cells display approximately 15 red signals and 2 green signals. In this case, the cell contains two copies of chromosome 17 (as indicated by the 2 green signals), but it has about 15 copies of the *ERBB2* gene (as indicated by the 15 red signals). The ratio of red to green signals is approximately $15/2 = 7.5$. This ratio is much greater than 1.0, indicating that the *ERBB2* gene has been selectively and extensively duplicated on the existing chromosomes. This is the definition of gene amplification.\n\nC. The majority of cells display 0 red signals and 2 green signals. This would indicate that the cell has two copies of chromosome 17, but both copies have lost the *ERBB2* gene locus. This represents a homozygous deletion, not amplification.\n\nD. The majority of cells display exactly 4 red signals and 4 green signals. Here, there are four copies of the *ERBB2* gene and four copies of chromosome 17. The ratio of red to green signals is $4/4 = 1.0$. This indicates that the cell has four complete copies of chromosome 17, a condition known as tetrasomy (a specific type of polysomy). While the absolute number of *ERBB2* genes is elevated, it is due to an increase in the chromosome number, not selective amplification of the gene itself. Therefore, this is evidence for polysomy, not gene amplification.\n\nE. The majority of cells display 1 red signal and 1 green signal. This would indicate that the cells are monosomic for chromosome 17, meaning they have only one copy of this chromosome. This is a chromosomal number abnormality, but not amplification.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only observation that definitively indicates *ERBB2* gene amplification is a high number of red signals paired with a normal or low number of green signals, resulting in a significantly elevated red-to-green signal ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1507203"}, {"introduction": "The activation of an oncogene is not always a simple on/off switch; often, the *amount* of oncogene expression determines its effect. This problem delves into this dose-dependent nature by combining cutting-edge CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with the gold-standard measurement technique of RT-qPCR. By analyzing hypothetical experimental data using the delta-delta Ct ($\\Delta\\Delta C_t$) method, you will practice the quantitative skills needed to determine the precise expression threshold required for an oncogene like *MYC* to trigger malignant transformation [@problem_id:1507145].", "problem": "A molecular biology research team is investigating the quantitative relationship between the expression level of the *MYC* proto-oncogene and the induction of a cancerous phenotype. They utilize a non-transformed human fibroblast cell line that has been engineered to stably express a dCas9-VPR protein complex for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), a method for increasing the expression of a target gene.\n\nThe team transduces these cells with a library of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). A portion of this library consists of sgRNAs designed to target the promoter region of the *MYC* gene, while another portion consists of non-targeting control (NTC) sgRNAs that do not bind anywhere in the human genome.\n\nAfter transduction, the entire cell population is plated in soft agar. This is an anchorage-independent growth assay where only cells that have undergone malignant transformation can proliferate and form colonies. After a three-week incubation period, a population of cells from the smallest visible colonies is isolated. This population is considered to represent cells that have just crossed the threshold for transformation.\n\nTo quantify the change in gene expression, Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is performed on two groups:\n1.  **Control Group**: The original cells transduced with NTC sgRNAs.\n2.  **Transformed Group**: The cells isolated from the smallest soft agar colonies.\n\nThe expression of *MYC* is measured relative to *GAPDH*, a housekeeping gene whose expression is assumed to be constant. The average Cycle threshold (Ct) values from the RT-qPCR experiment are as follows:\n\n- **Control Group:**\n  - *MYC* average Ct: 28.30\n  - *GAPDH* average Ct: 20.50\n\n- **Transformed Group:**\n  - *MYC* average Ct: 24.15\n  - *GAPDH* average Ct: 20.65\n\nBased on these data, calculate the minimum fold-change in *MYC* gene expression that is required to induce cellular transformation.
