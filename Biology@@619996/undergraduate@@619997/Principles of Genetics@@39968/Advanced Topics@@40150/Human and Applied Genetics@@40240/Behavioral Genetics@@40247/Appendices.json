This exercise [@problem_id:1472111] demonstrates how these classic rules can be applied to understand the inheritance of a behavioral trait. By analyzing a straightforward genetic cross in *C. elegans*, you will practice determining dominance and predicting the phenotypic ratios for a single gene that governs foraging behavior.", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, a single gene is hypothesized to control a key foraging behavior. One allele results in a \"solitary\" phenotype, where individuals feed alone, while the other allele results in a \"clumping\" phenotype, where individuals aggregate on a food source.\n\nTo investigate the genetic basis of this behavior, a researcher performs a controlled cross. A pure-breeding line of nematodes exhibiting the solitary feeding phenotype is crossed with a pure-breeding line exhibiting the clumping phenotype. This initial cross is designated as the parental (P) generation.\n\nAll of the resulting offspring in the first filial (F1) generation display the solitary feeding phenotype. These F1 individuals are then allowed to self-fertilize to produce a second filial (F2) generation.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the dominance relationship between the alleles and predicts the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation?\n\nA. The clumping allele is dominant to the solitary allele, and the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 1 solitary : 3 clumping.\n\nB. The solitary allele is dominant to the clumping allele, and the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 3 solitary : 1 clumping.\n\nC. The alleles show incomplete dominance, and the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 1 solitary : 2 intermediate : 1 clumping.\n\nD. The solitary allele is dominant to the clumping allele, and the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 1 solitary : 1 clumping.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine the dominance relationship from the information provided.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the dominance relationship of the alleles for feeding behavior and to predict the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation based on the results of the given genetic cross.\n\n**Step 1: Define Alleles and Parental Genotypes**\nLet's assign symbols to the alleles. Let $S$ represent one allele and $s$ represent the other. We do not yet know which allele corresponds to which phenotype or which is dominant.\n\nThe problem states that the parental (P) generation consists of two pure-breeding lines. \"Pure-breeding\" means that the individuals are homozygous for the gene in question.\n- The pure-breeding solitary line has a genotype we can denote as $S_1S_1$.\n- The pure-breeding clumping line has a genotype we can denote as $S_2S_2$.\n\nThe parental cross is: $S_1S_1 \\times S_2S_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the F1 Generation to Determine Dominance**\nAll offspring from the P cross form the F1 generation. According to the principles of Mendelian inheritance, all F1 individuals will be heterozygous, receiving one allele from each parent. Therefore, the genotype of all F1 individuals is $S_1S_2$.\n\nThe problem states that all F1 individuals exhibit the solitary feeding phenotype. Since the F1 heterozygotes ($S_1S_2$) express only the solitary phenotype, the allele for solitary feeding must be dominant over the allele for clumping behavior. The clumping allele is, therefore, recessive.\n\nLet's refine our allele symbols based on this finding. By convention, the dominant allele is represented by an uppercase letter and the recessive allele by a lowercase letter.\n- Let $S$ be the dominant allele for solitary feeding.\n- Let $s$ be the recessive allele for clumping.\n\nNow we can write the genotypes for the P and F1 generations using these new symbols:\n- P generation (solitary): $SS$\n- P generation (clumping): $ss$\n- F1 generation (all solitary): $Ss$\n\nThe cross is $SS \\text{ (solitary)} \\times ss \\text{ (clumping)} \\rightarrow \\text{All } Ss \\text{ (solitary)}$. This confirms that the solitary allele ($S$) is dominant over the clumping allele ($s$).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the F2 Generation Phenotypic Ratio**\nThe F2 generation is produced by self-fertilization of the F1 individuals. This is equivalent to a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous individuals:\nCross: $Ss \\times Ss$\n\nTo find the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation, we can use a Punnett square.\n\n| | $S$ | $s$|\n|---|---|---|\n|**$S$**| $SS$ | $Ss$|\n|**$s$**| $Ss$ | $ss$|\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the expected genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is:\n1 $SS$ : 2 $Ss$ : 1 $ss$\n\nNow, we determine the phenotype for each genotype:\n- $SS$: Homozygous dominant, exhibits the solitary phenotype.\n- $Ss$: Heterozygous, exhibits the dominant solitary phenotype.\n- $ss$: Homozygous recessive, exhibits the clumping phenotype.\n\nCombining the genotypes that produce the same phenotype:\n- Solitary phenotype: $SS$ and $Ss$. The proportion is $1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4$.\n- Clumping phenotype: $ss$. The proportion is $1/4$.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3 solitary : 1 clumping.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Option**\nWe have determined two key pieces of information:\n1.  The solitary allele is dominant to the clumping allele.\n2.  The expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 3 solitary : 1 clumping.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. The clumping allele is dominant... (Incorrect)\nB. The solitary allele is dominant to the clumping allele, and the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 3 solitary : 1 clumping. (Correct)\nC. The alleles show incomplete dominance... (Incorrect, as the F1 phenotype was fully solitary, not an intermediate)\nD. The solitary allele is dominant..., and the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 1 solitary : 1 clumping. (Incorrect ratio, this would result from a test cross, i.e., $Ss \\times ss$)\nE. It is impossible to determine... (Incorrect, the information is sufficient)\n\nThe correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1472111"}, {"introduction": "While many traits follow simple Mendelian patterns, inheritance can be more complex, especially when genes are located on sex chromosomes. This problem [@problem_id:1472104] presents a puzzle involving the inheritance of a male-specific cricket mating call. Your task is to act as a genetic detective, using the pedigree information to deduce the most likely mode of inheritance, a key skill for analyzing real-world genetic data.", "problem": "An entomologist is studying a newly discovered species of cricket in a remote jungle. She observes a very specific, complex chirping pattern that serves as a mating call. Through meticulous observation and controlled breeding experiments, she determines the following:\n\n1.  The complex mating call is produced exclusively by males of the species. Females are physically capable of chirping but never produce this specific complex pattern.\n2.  In a controlled cross, a male exhibiting the complex call is mated with a female from a population where this call has never been observed (assume this female's lineage is homozygous for the wild-type, non-calling trait).\n3.  All of their direct female offspring (F1 generation) are phenotypically normal and do not produce the call, but when these F1 females are subsequently crossed with wild-type males, approximately 50% of their male offspring (F2 generation) produce the complex mating call.\n4.  None of the direct male offspring (F1 generation) from the initial cross ever produce the complex call.\n\nBased on this inheritance pattern, which of the following is the most likely mode of inheritance for this behavioral trait?\n\nA. Autosomal dominant\n\nB. Autosomal recessive\n\nC. Y-linked inheritance\n\nD. X-linked recessive\n\nE. X-linked dominant\n\nF. Mitochondrial inheritance", "solution": "Let the presence of the complex call be determined by a single locus with Mendelian segregation. We test each listed mode of inheritance against the stated crosses, using the law of segregation and sex-chromosome transmission rules.\n\n1) X-linked recessive model:\n- Let $X^{c}$ denote the mutant allele that causes the call and $X^{+}$ the wild-type allele. Assume recessive expression in females (so females require $X^{c}X^{c}$ to express), while hemizygous males $X^{c}Y$ express the trait.\n- Initial cross: affected male $X^{c}Y$ mated with homozygous wild-type female $X^{+}X^{+}$.\n  - F1 daughters: all $X^{+}X^{c}$ (carriers), phenotypically normal (no call).\n  - F1 sons: all $X^{+}Y$, phenotypically normal (no call).\n  This matches the observation that none of the direct male offspring (F1) produce the call and that all F1 females are normal.\n- F1 carrier females $X^{+}X^{c}$ crossed with wild-type males $X^{+}Y$:\n  - Sons receive $Y$ from the father and either $X^{+}$ or $X^{c}$ from the mother with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ each, yielding $\\frac{1}{2}$ $X^{c}Y$ (affected) and $\\frac{1}{2}$ $X^{+}Y$ (unaffected).\n  Hence, $\\frac{1}{2}$ of F2 males produce the call, as observed.\nThus, X-linked recessive explains all observations.\n\n2) Y-linked inheritance:\n- An affected father would transmit the causal allele on $Y$ to all sons; therefore, all F1 males would be affected. The observation that no F1 male produces the call contradicts this. Excluded.\n\n3) Autosomal recessive:\n- Let $a$ be the mutant allele and $A$ the wild-type. Father $aa$ (affected), mother $AA$ (homozygous wild-type).\n- All F1 are $Aa$ (unaffected). Crossing F1 females $Aa$ with wild-type males $AA$ produces sons that are $AA$ or $Aa$, never $aa$, so no F2 males would be affected. This contradicts the observed $\\frac{1}{2}$ affected F2 males. Excluded.\n\n4) Autosomal dominant:\n- An affected father ($Aa$ or $AA$) crossed with a wild-type mother would yield some affected F1 (in either sex if not sex-limited). The observation that none of the F1 males are affected contradicts this; even with male-limited expression, an $Aa$ father would produce $\\frac{1}{2}$ affected F1 sons, which is not observed. Excluded.\n\n5) X-linked dominant:\n- An affected father $X^{D}Y$ crossed with a wild-type mother $X^{+}X^{+}$ gives daughters $X^{D}X^{+}$ who would be affected if dominance is expressed in females. The observation states all F1 females are phenotypically normal. To reconcile this with X-linked dominant would require invoking strict male-limited expression in females, which is not necessary under the X-linked recessive model. Moreover, the canonical pattern observed (affected father, normal mother → no F1 affected; carrier daughters → $\\frac{1}{2}$ affected sons) is the classic X-linked recessive signature.\n\n6) Mitochondrial inheritance:\n- Fathers do not transmit mitochondria to offspring; an affected father would not produce any affected F1 by mitochondrial transmission. The observed sex-specific and generation-specific pattern does not fit mitochondrial inheritance.\n\nConclusion: The only mode that parsimoniously and canonically fits all the stated observations without additional assumptions is X-linked recessive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1472104"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most critical concept in modern behavioral genetics is that genes do not operate in a vacuum; their effects are often modulated by the environment.
