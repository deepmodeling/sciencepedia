Many genetic counseling scenarios involve calculating the likelihood of an individual being a carrier, especially when family history provides crucial clues. This first practice problem [@problem_id:1521062] challenges you to apply the concept of conditional probability to a classic case of autosomal recessive inheritance, an essential skill for assessing genetic risk within a family.", "problem": "A genetic disorder known as Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is a severe progressive encephalopathy that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to be affected by the disease. Consider a couple where both the male and female partners are phenotypically normal. They have a child who is diagnosed with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. They later have a daughter who is phenotypically normal. What is the probability that this phenotypically normal daughter is a heterozygous carrier of the allele for the syndrome?\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is autosomal recessive, so an affected child must have genotype $aa$. For a child to be $aa$, each parent must contribute an $a$ allele, which implies both parents are obligate carriers with genotype $Aa$. This conclusion follows from Mendelian inheritance for autosomal loci.\n\nGiven both parents are $Aa$, by Mendelian segregation each child’s genotype distribution is:\n$$\nP(AA)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Aa)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(aa)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nLet $C$ be the event “child is a carrier,” i.e., genotype $Aa$, and let $N$ be the event “child is phenotypically normal,” i.e., genotype not $aa$. We seek $P(C\\mid N)$.\n\nUsing conditional probability,\n$$\nP(C\\mid N)=\\frac{P(C\\cap N)}{P(N)}.\n$$\nSince carriers ($Aa$) are phenotypically normal in an autosomal recessive condition, $C\\subset N$, so $P(C\\cap N)=P(C)$. Also,\n$$\nP(N)=P(AA)+P(Aa)=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{4},\\quad P(C)=P(Aa)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nP(C\\mid N)=\\frac{P(C)}{P(N)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}}=\\frac{2}{3}.\n$$\nSex does not affect autosomal inheritance, so this applies to the phenotypically normal daughter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "1521062"}, {"introduction": "While Mendelian genetics uses symbols to represent dominant and recessive alleles, the molecular mechanisms behind these patterns are key to a deeper understanding. This exercise [@problem_id:1521030] explores the concept of a \"dominant-negative\" mutation, where a faulty protein subunit can \"poison\" a larger complex. By calculating the fraction of functional proteins in a heterozygous individual, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for how genotype translates into molecular phenotype.", "problem": "A fictional recessively inherited neurodevelopmental condition, known as \"Synaptinopathy,\" is caused by a loss of function in the Synaptin protein. This protein is crucial for neuronal signaling and functions as a homotetramer, a complex made of four identical subunits.\n\nA different, more severe neurodegenerative disorder, \"Kaelan's Syndrome,\" is caused by a distinct dominant-negative mutation in the same gene. In an individual who is heterozygous for this dominant-negative allele, two types of Synaptin subunits are produced: the wild-type subunit ($S_{wt}$) and a mutant, \"poison\" subunit ($S_{mut}$). The incorporation of even a single $S_{mut}$ subunit into the tetramer is sufficient to render the entire protein complex non-functional.\n\nDue to differences in messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency, the two alleles are not expressed at equal levels. In the cellular pool of subunits available for assembly in a heterozygous individual, the molar ratio of wild-type subunits ($S_{wt}$) to poison subunits ($S_{mut}$) is maintained at a constant $3:2$. Assuming that subunits are drawn randomly and independently from this pool to form the tetramers, calculate the fraction of fully functional Synaptin protein complexes in an individual heterozygous for Kaelan's Syndrome.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The Synaptin complex is a homotetramer, so four subunits are drawn independently from a pool. In the heterozygote, the molar ratio of wild-type to mutant subunits is $3:2$, so the probability of selecting a wild-type subunit on any draw is\n$$\np_{wt}=\\frac{3}{3+2}=\\frac{3}{5}.\n$$\nA tetramer is fully functional only if all four selected subunits are wild-type. Because draws are independent, the probability that all four are wild-type is the product of individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{functional})=p_{wt}^{4}=\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{4}=\\frac{81}{625}=0.1296.\n$$\nRounding this decimal to three significant figures yields $0.130$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.130}$$", "id": "1521030"}, {"introduction": "Genes located on the same chromosome do not always assort independently, a principle known as genetic linkage. Understanding linkage and recombination is critical for gene mapping and for using molecular markers to track disease alleles through a family. This final practice problem [@problem_id:1521084] places you in the role of a geneticist, using recombination frequency to predict the outcome of a cross and determine the probability of a child inheriting a specific combination of linked traits.", "problem": "In a clinical genetics study, a late-onset autosomal dominant neurological disorder, Cerebellar Hypoplasia Type 7 (CH7), is under investigation. The disease-causing allele is denoted by $D$, and the corresponding healthy allele is $d$. A molecular marker, located on the same chromosome as the CH7 gene, is used for tracking inheritance. This marker has two codominant alleles: one detectable by a probe, which we denote as $M$, and one that is not, denoted as $m$. Consequently, an individual with genotype $MM$ or $Mm$ will test positive for the marker, while an individual with genotype $mm$ will test negative.\n\nA couple seeks genetic counseling. The male partner is affected with CH7 and is heterozygous for the disease gene ($Dd$). Genetic analysis also reveals he is heterozygous for the marker ($Mm$). Through family history analysis, it is determined that his chromosome arrangement is in the coupling (or cis) configuration, meaning his genotype is $D M / d m$. The female partner is phenotypically healthy, is unaffected by CH7, and tests negative for the marker, indicating her genotype is $d m / d m$.\n\nThrough extensive population data, the recombination frequency between the CH7 gene locus and the molecular marker locus has been accurately determined to be 8.0%.\n\nWhat is the probability that this couple will have a child who eventually develops CH7 but tests negative for the molecular marker? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The father’s two loci are in coupling (cis) phase, $D M / d m$, and the mother is $d m / d m$.
