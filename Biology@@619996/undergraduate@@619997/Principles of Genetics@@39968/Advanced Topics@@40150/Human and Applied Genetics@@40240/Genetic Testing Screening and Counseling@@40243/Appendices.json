This exercise will guide you through a fundamental application of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle, a cornerstone of population genetics. By using the known incidence of an autosomal recessive disorder, you will learn how to calculate the probability that a healthy individual from that population is a heterozygous carrier, a key piece of information for risk assessment and counseling [@problem_id:1493252].", "problem": "Renshaw's Myopathy (RM) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. It is known to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In a large, isolated island population, epidemiological studies have determined that the incidence of RM at birth is 1 in 4,900. A healthy young adult from this population, with no known family history of the disorder, is curious about their genetic status.\n\nAssuming this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the RM gene locus, what is the probability that this healthy individual is a heterozygous carrier for Renshaw's Myopathy?\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Let the normal allele be $A$ with frequency $p$ and the disease allele be $a$ with frequency $q$. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:\n- Allele frequencies satisfy $p+q=1$.\n- Genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^{2}$ for $aa$.\n\nSince Renshaw's Myopathy is autosomal recessive, the incidence at birth equals the homozygous recessive frequency:\n$$\nq^{2}=\\frac{1}{4900} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad q=\\frac{1}{70}, \\quad p=1-q=\\frac{69}{70}.\n$$\nThe probability that a randomly chosen individual is a heterozygous carrier is $2pq$. However, the individual is known to be healthy (not affected), so we need the conditional probability of being a carrier given being unaffected. The unaffected genotypes are $AA$ and $Aa$, with total frequency $p^{2}+2pq=1-q^{2}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{carrier} \\mid \\text{healthy})=\\frac{2pq}{1-q^{2}}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p=\\frac{69}{70}$ and $q=\\frac{1}{70}$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{2\\left(\\frac{69}{70}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{70}\\right)}{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{4900}\\right)}\n=\\frac{\\frac{138}{4900}}{\\frac{4899}{4900}}\n=\\frac{138}{4899}.\n$$\nSimplifying,\n$$\n138=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 23,\\quad 4899=3\\cdot 23\\cdot 71 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\frac{138}{4899}=\\frac{2}{71}.\n$$\nThus, the probability that this healthy individual is a heterozygous carrier is $\\frac{2}{71}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{71}}$$", "id": "1493252"}, {"introduction": "The development of genetic screening tests has revolutionized medicine, but interpreting their results requires careful statistical reasoning.
