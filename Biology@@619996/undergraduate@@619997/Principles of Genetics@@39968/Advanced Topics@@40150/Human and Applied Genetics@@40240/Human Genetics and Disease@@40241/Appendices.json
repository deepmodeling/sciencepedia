The inheritance pattern for DMD is X-linked recessive.\n\nConsider a family where a phenotypically normal woman has a brother affected by DMD.

For an X-linked recessive disorder:\n- An affected male has genotype $X^{m}Y$ and must have inherited the mutant $X^{m}$ from his mother.\n- A son inherits $Y$ from his father and his single $X$ chromosome from his mother; thus, a son’s risk depends only on the mother’s carrier status and her transmission.\n\nGiven that the woman’s brother is affected and both parents are phenotypically normal, the mother is a carrier under standard Mendelian assumptions. Let the mother be $X^{m}X^{N}$ and the father $X^{N}Y$. For the phenotypically normal daughter in question:\n- She receives $X^{N}$ from her father with probability $1$.\n- From her carrier mother, she receives $X^{m}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $X^{N}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the probability that the woman is a carrier is\n$$\nP(\\text{woman is carrier})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nShe is expecting a son with a phenotypically normal man. For a son:\n- If the woman is a carrier, the probability she transmits the mutant $X^{m}$ to her son is $\\frac{1}{2}$, yielding an affected $X^{m}Y$ son.\n- If she is not a carrier, the probability is $0$.\n\nBy the law of total probability,\n$$\nP(\\text{affected son})=P(\\text{woman is carrier})\\times P(\\text{transmit }X^{m}\\mid \\text{carrier})=\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nThus, the correct choice is the option corresponding to $\\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1498100"}, {"introduction": "While Mendel's laws provide the foundation for inheritance, real-world genetics includes many fascinating variations. This exercise explores the concept of a lethal allele, where certain genetic combinations are not viable and thus not observed in live births. By studying a scenario involving achondroplasia, you will practice adjusting classical Mendelian ratios to account for this critical factor, refining your understanding of probability in genetics [@problem_id:1498086].", "problem": "Achondroplasia is a common form of short-limbed dwarfism in humans. The condition is caused by a single autosomal dominant allele. Extensive genetic studies have shown that individuals who are homozygous for the dominant allele that causes achondroplasia do not survive embryonic development and are never born.\n\nConsider a couple where both individuals have achondroplasia. Since they are alive, it can be inferred that they are both heterozygous for this trait. They plan to have a child.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance patterns, calculate the probability that their first live-born child will be of average stature (i.e., phenotypically unaffected by achondroplasia). Express your answer as a single fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "Let the dominant allele for achondroplasia be $A$ and the normal allele be $a$. Each parent is heterozygous $Aa$ because homozygous dominant $AA$ is embryonically lethal.\n\nUnder Mendelian inheritance for $Aa \\times Aa$, the genotypic probabilities at conception are:\n$$P(AA)=\\frac{1}{4}, \\quad P(Aa)=\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(aa)=\\frac{1}{4}.$$\n\nOnly $Aa$ and $aa$ genotypes are viable (live-born). Thus the probability of being live-born is:\n$$P(\\text{live})=P(Aa)+P(aa)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}.$$\n\nWe seek the conditional probability that the first live-born child is of average stature, i.e., genotype $aa$ given live birth:\n$$P(aa \\mid \\text{live})=\\frac{P(aa \\cap \\text{live})}{P(\\text{live})}=\\frac{P(aa)}{P(\\text{live})}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}}=\\frac{1}{3}.$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that their first live-born child is of average stature is $\\frac{1}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "1498086"}, {"introduction": "Beyond individual families, geneticists often study entire populations to understand the prevalence and spread of genetic traits. The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a mathematical model to estimate allele and genotype frequencies under specific conditions of equilibrium.
