They are using the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle, a fundamental iterative process in engineering biology.\n\n*   **Design:** The team designed a metabolic pathway introducing three enzymes (A, B, and C) intended to convert a native *E. coli* metabolite into vanillin. The planned sequence is: Native Metabolite $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme A}}$ Intermediate 1 $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme B}}$ Protocatechuic Acid $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme C}}$ Vanillin.\n*   **Build:** They successfully synthesized the genes for enzymes A, B, and C, assembled them into a plasmid, and transformed the plasmid into an *E. coli* host strain.\n*   **Test:** The engineered bacteria were cultured in a growth medium that should induce the expression of the new enzymes. The team observed that the cell culture grew poorly and then lysed (burst). Chemical analysis of the culture supernatant revealed a high concentration of protocatechuic acid, but no detectable vanillin. Further research confirms that protocatechuic acid is toxic to *E. coli* at the concentrations measured.\n\nBased on these observations, the results from which phase of the DBTL cycle revealed the critical flaw in the engineered system, and what is the immediate next phase the team should enter to address the problem?\n\nA.

During Design, the pathway architecture was proposed, but no empirical flaw can be revealed without implementation and measurement. During Build, the genes were synthesized, assembled, and transformed; successful construction does not expose functional toxicity or pathway bottlenecks by itself. During Test, the engineered cells were induced and phenotypic and chemical measurements were made. The observed poor growth, lysis, and chemical profile showing accumulation of protocatechuic acid with no vanillin directly reveal a functional flaw: the pathway stalls at the step catalyzed by Enzyme C, causing buildup of a toxic intermediate. This flaw is an empirical outcome of testing. By definition of the DBTL cycle order (Design → Build → Test → Learn), the immediate next phase after Test is Learn, where results are analyzed to generate hypotheses (e.g., Enzyme C expression/activity is insufficient; cofactor or transport limitations; need to mitigate intermediate toxicity) that inform a revised design for the next iteration. Therefore, the Test phase revealed the flaw, and the next phase should be Learn.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1524586"}, {"introduction": "A key goal in synthetic biology is the creation of 'minimal genomes'—cellular chassis containing only the essential genes for life, providing a simplified and predictable background for engineered circuits. The first step towards this goal is experimentally mapping which genes are non-essential under specific conditions. This practice introduces transposon mutagenesis, a powerful high-throughput technique for this purpose, and challenges you to interpret its results to define the non-essential gene set of a hypothetical bacterium [@problem_id:1524622].", "problem": "A research team in synthetic biology is working to engineer a minimal genome for a novel bacterium, *Bacillus syntheticus*, which currently has a genome containing 4,100 distinct protein-coding genes. Their goal is to identify all non-essential genes that can be removed without compromising the organism's viability on a specific rich nutrient medium.\n\nTo achieve this, they employ a technique called transposon mutagenesis. They introduce a transposon, which carries a gene for kanamycin resistance, into a large population of *B. syntheticus*. The transposon inserts itself quasi-randomly into the bacterial chromosome. The entire bacterial population is then grown on the rich nutrient medium supplemented with kanamycin. Only cells that have successfully incorporated a transposon can survive this selection.\n\nAfter cultivation, the researchers collect millions of surviving cells and use high-throughput sequencing to identify the precise genomic location of the transposon insertion in each cell. By compiling the data from the entire surviving population, they find that the transposon had inserted into and disrupted a total of 3,280 different protein-coding genes. Each of these 3,280 genes was disrupted in at least one surviving bacterium.\n\nBased on the results of this large-scale screen, calculate the proportion of protein-coding genes in *B. syntheticus* that are considered non-essential under these specific growth conditions.

This 'metabolic burden' can limit the performance of the circuit and the health of the cell by diverting essential machinery like ribosomes away from native functions.

The production pathway involves the massive overexpression of a single, large, non-essential protein. While the protein itself is harmless, its high rate of synthesis places a significant metabolic burden on the cell by sequestering ribosomes, thereby reducing the resources available for synthesizing essential endogenous proteins required for growth and division.\n\nThe team observes a distinct \"toxicity threshold\": when the expression of the synthetic protein is induced beyond a certain level, the cell's growth rate plummets. This threshold is defined as the point where the cell's machinery is allocating the bare minimum number of ribosomes to endogenous protein synthesis that is required to complete one cell division. At this specific threshold, the total number of ribosomes actively translating the synthetic protein's messenger RNA (mRNA) is exactly half the total number of ribosomes translating all the various endogenous protein mRNAs.\n\nYour task is to model this resource allocation problem.
