The genes encoding HLA proteins are located on chromosome 6 and are highly polymorphic. For this problem, we will consider the HLA-A and HLA-B loci. These two genetic loci are so closely linked on the chromosome that they are almost always inherited together as a single block known as a haplotype.\n\nA prospective mother has the HLA genotype (A1-B8 / A2-B5), meaning she inherited the haplotype (A1-B8) from one of her parents and (A2-B5) from her other parent.

The HLA system is broadly divided into two main classes, each with a distinct role in activating a specific branch of the T-cell army. This practice [@problem_id:1498377] uses a thought experiment based on a real immunodeficiency to explore the functional consequences of losing all HLA class II molecules, helping to solidify the connection between HLA class II and the activation of $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes.", "problem": "A rare genetic disorder, known as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome, Type II, is characterized by a failure of cells to express any Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II molecules on their surface. Cells like macrophages, which are professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs), are therefore unable to present antigens via the class II pathway. Despite this defect, the expression and function of HLA class I molecules are entirely normal. Patients with this condition suffer from severe immunodeficiency.\n\nConsidering the specific roles of different immune cell populations in a typical adaptive immune response, which of the following cell types would be most directly and fundamentally unable to be activated and perform its primary function in an individual with this specific genetic defect?\n\nA. Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes\n\nB. Helper T Lymphocytes\n\nC. Natural Killer (NK) cells\n\nD. Plasma Cells\n\nE. Neutrophils", "solution": "We identify the molecular defect: Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type II is characterized by an absence of HLA class II expression on professional antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, while HLA class I expression is normal.\n\nWe apply the core principles of antigen presentation:\n- HLA class II molecules present exogenous peptides to $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes. Activation of $CD4^{+}$ T cells requires T cell receptor recognition of a peptide–HLA class II complex plus costimulation; without HLA class II on APCs, this signal cannot occur, so $CD4^{+}$ T cells cannot be activated.\n- HLA class I molecules present endogenous peptides to $CD8^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In this scenario, HLA class I expression and function are normal, so $CD8^{+}$ T cells can still receive their antigen-specific activation signal, though optimal priming and memory may be impaired due to absent $CD4^{+}$ T cell help; this is an indirect effect, not a fundamental inability of $CD8^{+}$ T cells to be activated by HLA class I.\n- Natural killer cells do not require HLA class II for activation; they are regulated largely by the presence or absence of HLA class I and other ligands. With normal HLA class I, NK cell regulation is not directly compromised by the lack of HLA class II.\n- Plasma cells arise from B cells; T-dependent antibody responses require $CD4^{+}$ T cell help (e.g., CD40L–CD40 interactions and cytokines), so class switching and affinity maturation are severely impaired. However, B cells can still respond to T-independent antigens and differentiate into IgM-secreting plasma cells; thus plasma cells are not intrinsically unable to function, but are indirectly affected.\n- Neutrophils are innate effector cells whose activation and function do not depend on HLA class II; they are not directly affected by this defect.\n\nTherefore, the cell population most directly and fundamentally unable to be activated and perform its primary function in the absence of HLA class II is the $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes.\n\nThere is no mistake in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1498377"}, {"introduction": "Having explored HLA inheritance and class-specific function, we now zoom in to the molecular level of antigen presentation.

This exercise [@problem_id:1498357] simulates the process of predicting peptide binding by using a simplified scoring model, which illustrates how specific \"anchor\" amino acids on a peptide fit into the binding groove of an HLA molecule, providing insight into the foundation of T-cell recognition and the principles of vaccine design.", "problem": "In human immunology, cell-surface proteins encoded by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA), play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. MHC class I molecules survey a cell's internal protein content by binding to short peptides derived from intracellular proteins. If the peptide originates from a virus, the MHC-peptide complex is displayed on the cell surface, flagging the infected cell for destruction by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.\n\nThe binding affinity of a peptide to a specific HLA allele is determined by 'anchor' residues within the peptide that fit into pockets of the HLA binding groove.

The total binding score for a peptide is the sum of the scores from individual amino acid positions according to the following rules. A higher total score correlates with stronger predicted binding.\n\n**Scoring Rules for HLA-B*27:05:**\n1.  **Primary Anchor (P2):** An Arginine (R) at this position contributes +10 to the score. A Lysine (K) contributes +3.\n2.  **Primary Anchor (P9):** An Arginine (R) or a Lysine (K) at the C-terminus contributes +5. A Leucine (L), Valine (V), or Isoleucine (I) contributes +3.
