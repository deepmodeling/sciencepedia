A PRS is calculated by summing the effects of numerous genetic variants, often Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), that have been associated with a disease through a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\nConsider a fictional neurodegenerative condition known as \"Cerebral Hypometabolism Syndrome.\" A recent GWAS has published data on three SNPs significantly associated with this syndrome. The effect size, $\\beta$, for each SNP is given as the natural logarithm of the odds ratio per copy of the risk allele.\n\nThe data for the three SNPs are as follows:\n- **SNP `rs11218`:** Alleles are A and G.

Their relative risk of developing T2D compared to the general population.\n2. Their absolute lifetime risk of developing T2D.\n\nExpress your answer as two numbers in a single response, with the relative risk first, followed by the absolute risk. Both values must be expressed as decimals.", "solution": "The problem asks for two distinct but related values concerning risk assessment using a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS): the relative risk and the absolute risk for an individual in the highest-risk group.\n\nLet's first define and identify the parameters given in the problem statement.\nThe baseline absolute risk for the general population, which we can denote as $R_{pop}$, is the lifetime prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in the population. The problem states this is 8.0%. As a decimal, this is:\n$$R_{pop} = 0.08$$\n\nThe high-risk group is defined as the top quintile of the PRS distribution.\nThe problem provides the relative risk for this group. The relative risk ($RR$) compares the risk in an exposed or high-risk group to the risk in an unexposed or baseline group. Here, the high-risk group (top quintile) is being compared to the general population. The problem explicitly states that individuals in the top quintile have a relative risk of 2.5. We can denote this as $RR_{top}$.\n$$RR_{top} = 2.5$$\n\nNow, we can address the two parts of the question.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the relative risk for the top quintile.**\nThe problem statement directly gives this value. It states, \"...individuals in the top quintile... have a relative risk of developing T2D that is 2.5 times greater than the baseline risk for the general population.\" This means the relative risk for an individual in this group is simply 2.5. This part of the question tests the ability to correctly identify and interpret the definition of relative risk from the provided text.\nSo, the first value is 2.5.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the absolute lifetime risk for the top quintile.**\nThe absolute risk ($AR$) is an individual's actual probability of developing a disease over a specified time period. The relative risk relates the absolute risk of one group to another. The relationship is defined as:\n$$RR = \\frac{AR_{group}}{AR_{baseline}}$$\nIn our case, the baseline risk is the population risk, $R_{pop}$. So, the absolute risk for the top quintile, $AR_{top}$, can be calculated by rearranging this formula:\n$$AR_{top} = RR_{top} \\times AR_{baseline}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$AR_{top} = RR_{top} \\times R_{pop}$$\n$$AR_{top} = 2.5 \\times 0.08$$\n$$AR_{top} = 0.20$$\n\nSo, the absolute lifetime risk for an individual in the top PRS quintile is 0.20, or 20%.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two requested values are the relative risk and the absolute risk for the top quintile.\nRelative Risk = 2.5\nAbsolute Risk = 0.20\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as two decimal numbers, with the relative risk first.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.5 & 0.20 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1510576"}, {"introduction": "While polygenic risk scores are revolutionary for understanding complex traits, it is crucial to recognize their scope and limitations. Standard PRS models are built from common genetic variants with small effects and may not capture the impact of rare, high-impact mutations that can cause disease through a more Mendelian mechanism. This quantitative exercise [@problem_id:1510624] directly contrasts the risk conferred by a typical PRS with that from a single potent but rare mutation, illustrating why different genetic testing strategies are needed for different types of inherited risk.", "problem": "A Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) is a metric used to estimate an individual's genetic predisposition to a disease based on the cumulative effect of many common genetic variants. Consider a hypothetical neurological condition, Hypersomnia Syndrome (HS). A standard PRS for HS has been developed from large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).\n\nThis PRS is calculated based on $N=100$ independent, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). For simplicity, assume that for each of these SNPs, the risk allele has an identical effect size, conferring an odds ratio ($OR_{common}$) of 1.1 for developing HS. The polygenic odds are calculated based on a baseline odds of 1 for an individual who has zero risk alleles across all 100 SNPs. The total odds are found by multiplying this baseline odds by $OR_{common}$ for every individual risk allele the person carries. For instance, an individual who is heterozygous at one risk SNP and homozygous for the non-risk alleles at all others has one risk allele, and their polygenic odds would be $1 \\times (OR_{common})^{1}$.\n\nNow, consider an individual named Alex. Genotyping reveals that for the 100 SNPs in the PRS panel, Alex is heterozygous for 30 of them and homozygous for the non-risk allele for the remaining 70.\n\nUnrelated to the common variants used in the PRS, a rare, high-impact dominant mutation in a gene called *DREAM1* is known to segregate in Alex's family. This mutation is so rare that it was not detected by the original GWAS and is therefore not included in the standard PRS calculation. The presence of a single copy of this *DREAM1* mutation is known to confer an odds ratio ($OR_{rare}$) of 50.0 for developing HS. Alex has been genetically tested and is confirmed to carry this *DREAM1* mutation.\n\nTo illustrate the limitation of the standard PRS in this specific case, calculate the ratio of the disease odds conferred by the single rare *DREAM1* mutation to the disease odds predicted by the standard polygenic risk score for Alex.
