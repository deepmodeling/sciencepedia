The protocol involves amplifying several Short Tandem Repeat (STR) loci from the DNA sample using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The resulting mixture contains DNA fragments of various sizes corresponding to the different STR alleles. To separate these fragments, the student uses agarose gel electrophoresis. The standard procedure is to place the agarose gel in a chamber filled with an ionic buffer solution, load the DNA sample into wells at one end of the gel, and apply an electric field across the gel.\n\nHowever, the student makes a critical error. They place the gel into the electrophoresis chamber such that the wells containing the DNA sample are positioned at the end of the gel nearest to the positive electrode (anode), while the opposite end of the gel is near the negative electrode (cathode). The student then turns on the power supply and runs the gel for the standard duration, after which they stain the gel with a DNA-binding dye to visualize the results.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes will the student most likely observe?\n\nA. The DNA fragments will remain in the wells and will not have migrated.\n\nB. The gel will appear empty, with no DNA bands visible anywhere between the wells and the far end of the gel.\n\nC. The DNA fragments will have separated by size, but the migration pattern will be reversed: the largest fragments will be farthest from the wells and the smallest fragments will be closest.\n\nD. The DNA fragments will have migrated \"backwards\" through the gel towards the negative electrode, separating by size in that direction.\n\nE. The DNA fragments will have denatured due to the incorrect polarity and will appear as a single, large smear near the wells.", "solution": "DNA molecules possess a negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone under the near-neutral pH conditions of standard electrophoresis buffers. Let the net charge on a DNA fragment be denoted by $q$, with $q0$. When an electric field $\\vec{E}$ is applied, the electric force on the DNA is given by the fundamental relation of electrostatics:\n$$\n\\vec{F} = q \\vec{E}.\n$$\nBy convention, $\\vec{E}$ points from the positive electrode (anode) to the negative electrode (cathode). Because $q0$, the force $\\vec{F}$ on DNA points opposite to $\\vec{E}$, that is, toward the anode. The drift velocity in an electrophoretic medium is proportional to the mobility $\\mu$ and the field:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{d} = \\mu \\vec{E}, \\quad \\mu = \\frac{q}{f},\n$$\nwhere $f>0$ is the frictional coefficient set by the sieving matrix (agarose). Since $q0$, $\\mu0$, and therefore $\\vec{v}_{d}$ points toward the anode.\n\nIn the standard, correct setup for agarose gel electrophoresis, the sample wells are placed near the cathode so that DNA, driven toward the anode, migrates into and through the gel, separating by size due to size-dependent friction in the agarose matrix. In the erroneous setup described, the wells are near the anode and the far end of the gel is near the cathode. The electric field direction remains from anode to cathode, so DNA still migrates toward the anode. Consequently, immediately upon application of the field, the DNA will move out of the wells in the direction of the anode-side buffer reservoir rather than into the body of the gel. Because the wells are at the anode end, the DNA will quickly exit the gel and enter the buffer at the anode, preventing size-dependent separation within the gel.\n\nAfter running for the standard duration and staining the gel, there will be no DNA bands visible within the gel between the wells and the far end. Any DNA would have migrated out of the gel into the buffer near the anode, leaving the gel appearing empty. Therefore, the most likely observed outcome is that no bands are visible in the gel.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1488276"}, {"introduction": "Moving from technique to interpretation, this practice immerses you in the complexities of real-world forensic data. Crime scene samples are rarely pristine; they are often mixtures of DNA from multiple individuals. This exercise [@problem_id:1488267] requires you to analyze a mixed DNA profile from an electropherogram, applying standardized rules to distinguish true alleles from technical artifacts like stutter and to deduce the genetic profile of an unknown contributor by subtracting a known profile. It's a practical simulation of the methodical work forensic analysts perform daily.", "problem": "In the investigation of an art heist, forensic scientists recovered a faint \"touch DNA\" sample from the surface of a priceless manuscript. Analysis of this sample at a specific Short Tandem Repeat (STR) locus, D8S1179, revealed a mixture of DNA from at least two individuals. A reference DNA sample was obtained from the museum curator, who had legitimate access to the manuscript. The laboratory's electropherogram data for the D8S1179 locus from the mixture sample is provided below. The peak heights are given in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).\n\n| Allele Number | Peak Height (RFU) |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| 12            | 80                |\n| 13            | 500               |\n| 14            | 300               |\n| 15            | 450               |\n\nThe laboratory follows standard interpretation guidelines:\n1.  **Analytical Threshold (AT):** A signal is only considered a potential allele if its peak height is at or above 50 RFU.\n2.  **Stutter Threshold:** A peak located at one repeat unit smaller than a larger adjacent peak (an $n-1$ position) is classified as a stutter artifact if its height is 15% or less than the height of the main ($n$) peak. Stutter artifacts are not considered true alleles for mixture deconvolution.\n\nThe genotype of the known contributor (the curator) at the D8S1179 locus is (13, 14). Your task is to act as the forensic analyst. Based on the provided data and guidelines, determine the obligate alleles of the unknown contributor (the presumed thief) at this locus. An obligate allele is an allele that must be part of the unknown contributor's genotype to explain the observed mixture profile.\n\nList the numerical values of the obligate alleles in increasing order.", "solution": "Apply the analytical threshold: each observed peak is considered only if its height is at least 50 RFU. The observed peaks at alleles 12, 13, 14, and 15 have heights 80, 500, 300, and 450 RFU, respectively, all satisfying the threshold, so all four are potential alleles unless excluded as stutter.\n\nApply the stutter rule: a peak at position $n-1$ relative to a larger adjacent peak at $n$ is classified as stutter if its height is at most $0.15$ times the height of the main peak. Evaluate each relevant adjacent pair:\n\n1) Allele $12$ as potential stutter of allele $13$:\nCompute the ratio $r_{12|13} = \\frac{80}{500} = 0.16$. Since $0.16  0.15$, the peak at $12$ is not stutter and must be treated as a true allele.\n\n2) Allele $13$ as potential stutter of allele $14$:\nCompute $r_{13|14} = \\frac{500}{300} = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.666\\ldots$. This exceeds $0.15$, and moreover the “main” peak at $14$ is not larger than the $13$ peak, so the condition of a smaller stutter under a larger adjacent peak is not met. Therefore, the peak at $13$ is not stutter and is a true allele.\n\n3) Allele $14$ as potential stutter of allele $15$:\nCompute $r_{14|15} = \\frac{300}{450} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666\\ldots$. Since $0.666\\ldots  0.15$, the peak at $14$ is not stutter and is a true allele.\n\n4) Allele $15$ as potential stutter would require a main peak at $16$, which is not observed. Therefore, the peak at $15$ cannot be classified as stutter and is a true allele.\n\nThus, all four observed peaks at $12$, $13$, $14$, and $15$ are treated as true alleles. The known contributor (curator) has genotype $(13, 14)$, which fully accounts for alleles $13$ and $14$. The remaining true alleles, $12$ and $15$, cannot be attributed to the known contributor or to stutter artifacts under the laboratory’s rules. Therefore, they must have been contributed by at least one unknown individual and are obligate alleles of the unknown contributor.\n\nList the obligate alleles in increasing order: $12$, $15$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12  15 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1488267"}, {"introduction": "Once a DNA profile is identified, its true power lies in its rarity.
