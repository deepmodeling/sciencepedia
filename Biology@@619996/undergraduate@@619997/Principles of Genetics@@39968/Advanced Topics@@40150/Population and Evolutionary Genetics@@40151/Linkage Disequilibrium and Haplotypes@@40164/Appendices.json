This exercise models the decay of LD over generations, a predictable process that depends on the recombination frequency, $c$, between the loci [@problem_id:1501176]. Understanding this dynamic relationship, described by the formula $D_n = D_0 (1-c)^n$, is crucial for applications such as gene mapping and inferring the history of populations.", "problem": "A plant geneticist aims to develop a new variety of wheat that combines high yield with resistance to a specific fungal pathogen. They begin with two pure-breeding (homozygous) parental lines. The first parental line, P1, has the genotype $Ab/Ab$, conferring high yield (allele $A$) but susceptibility to the fungus (allele $b$). The second parental line, P2, has the genotype $aB/aB$, which results in low yield (allele $a$) but carries the resistance allele ($B$).\n\nThe geneticist crosses P1 and P2 to create a hybrid F1 generation. All individuals in the F1 generation are then allowed to randomly mate amongst themselves, and this process of random mating is continued for subsequent generations. This allows for recombination between the yield locus ($A/a$) and the resistance locus ($B/b$).\n\nThe degree of non-random association between alleles at these two loci is measured by the coefficient of linkage disequilibrium, $D$. The value of $D$ is expected to decay over generations of random mating according to the relationship $D_n = D_0 (1-c)^n$, where $D_n$ is the linkage disequilibrium after $n$ generations, $D_0$ is the initial linkage disequilibrium in the population derived from the F1 gametes, and $c$ is the recombination frequency between the loci.\n\nThrough genetic mapping, the recombination frequency between the yield locus and the resistance locus is determined to be $c = 0.02$. The geneticist considers the linkage between the two traits to be effectively broken when the magnitude of the linkage disequilibrium has decayed to less than 1% of its initial magnitude. Calculate the minimum integer number of generations of random mating required for this condition to be met.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of generations, $n$, required for the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium, $|D_n|$, to be less than 1% of its initial magnitude, $|D_0|$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial state of the population. The F1 generation is produced by crossing a parental line $Ab/Ab$ with a parental line $aB/aB$. Every individual in the F1 generation will therefore have the genotype $Ab/aB$. This means that the F1 population is composed of individuals who inherited an $Ab$ haplotype from one parent and an $aB$ haplotype from the other.\n\nThe initial linkage disequilibrium, $D_0$, is calculated from the frequencies of the haplotypes in the gene pool. For the F1 generation, the only existing haplotypes are $Ab$ and $aB$. Let's denote the frequencies of the four possible haplotypes ($AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, $ab$) as $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, respectively. In the F1 population, the frequencies are:\n$x_1 = f(AB) = 0$\n$x_2 = f(Ab) = 0.5$\n$x_3 = f(aB) = 0.5$\n$x_4 = f(ab) = 0$\n\nThe coefficient of linkage disequilibrium, $D$, is defined by the equation $D = x_1 x_4 - x_2 x_3$. We can calculate the initial linkage disequilibrium, $D_0$, using the initial haplotype frequencies:\n$$D_0 = (0)(0) - (0.5)(0.5) = -0.25$$\nThe initial magnitude of the linkage disequilibrium is $|D_0| = |-0.25| = 0.25$.\n\nThe problem states that the linkage disequilibrium decays over generations according to the formula $D_n = D_0 (1-c)^n$. We are interested in the magnitude, so we can write $|D_n| = |D_0| (1-c)^n$, since the recombination frequency $c$ is between 0 and 0.5, making $(1-c)$ positive.\n\nWe need to find the minimum integer $n$ for which the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium is less than 1% of its initial magnitude. This can be expressed as the inequality:\n$$|D_n| < 0.01 |D_0|$$\nSubstituting the decay formula into this inequality gives:\n$$|D_0| (1-c)^n < 0.01 |D_0|$$\nSince $D_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $|D_0|$ without changing the inequality:\n$$(1-c)^n < 0.01$$\nThe problem provides the recombination frequency $c = 0.02$. Substituting this value:\n$$(1 - 0.02)^n < 0.01$$\n$$(0.98)^n < 0.01$$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides.\n$$\\ln((0.98)^n) < \\ln(0.01)$$\n$$n \\ln(0.98) < \\ln(0.01)$$\nNow, we must solve for $n$. To do this, we divide by $\\ln(0.98)$. It is important to note that since $0.98 < 1$, the value of $\\ln(0.98)$ is negative. When dividing an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign must be reversed.\n$$n > \\frac{\\ln(0.01)}{\\ln(0.98)}$$\nNow, we can evaluate the expression:\n$$n > \\frac{-4.60517...}{-0.02020...}$$\n$$n > 227.94...$$\nSince the number of generations, $n$, must be an integer, the smallest integer value of $n$ that satisfies this condition is 228.\n\nTherefore, a minimum of 228 generations of random mating are required for the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium to fall below 1% of its initial value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{228}$$", "id": "1501176"}, {"introduction": "While the coefficient $D$ measures the absolute deviation from equilibrium, its range is constrained by the allele frequencies at the loci.
