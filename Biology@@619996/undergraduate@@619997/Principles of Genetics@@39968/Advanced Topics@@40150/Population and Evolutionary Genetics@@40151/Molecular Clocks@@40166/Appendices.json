Biologists hypothesize that these two populations diverged from a common ancestral population when the underground river system connecting the caves collapsed. To estimate when this separation occurred, they sequenced a specific non-coding region of DNA from several individuals in both populations.\n\nThe comparison of these sequences reveals an average of 3.5% divergence; that is, 3.5% of the nucleotide sites differ between the two populations. Based on studies of related species and geological dating, the substitution rate for this particular DNA region is estimated to be constant at $r = 2.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nAssuming this substitution rate has been constant for both lineages since their split, calculate the time that has passed since the two populations diverged.
