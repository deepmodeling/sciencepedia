This exercise [@problem_id:1481987] provides a practical application of this concept, modeling how environmental change can shift a trait in a predictable direction. By using the breeder's equation, $R = h^2 S$, you will calculate the evolutionary response to selection, connecting the heritability of a trait and the strength of selection to predict the next generation's phenotype.", "problem": "A population of a hypothetical wind-pollinated plant, *Ventus seminare*, grows in a stable, dense forest. The mass of the pollen grains produced by this population is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 50.0 picograms (pg). Following extensive deforestation in the region, the habitat becomes much more open and is subjected to persistent, strong winds. In this new environment, successful pollination and reproduction occur overwhelmingly among those plants that produce lighter pollen grains, which are more easily carried over long distances by the wind. A study of the successfully reproducing plants in this first generation reveals their mean pollen mass to be 42.0 pg. The narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) for pollen mass in this species is known to be 0.65.\n\nAssuming this selection pressure remains constant, calculate the expected mean pollen mass for the subsequent generation of *Ventus seminare*. Express your answer in picograms (pg), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected mean pollen mass in the next generation after a single generation of selection. This is a classic quantitative genetics problem that can be solved using the breeder's equation.\n\nFirst, we identify the key parameters given in the problem:\n- The mean pollen mass of the original population, $\\mu_0 = 50.0$ pg.\n- The mean pollen mass of the selected parents (those that successfully reproduced), $\\mu_s = 42.0$ pg.\n- The narrow-sense heritability of the trait (pollen mass), $h^2 = 0.65$.\n\nThe change in a trait's mean value from one generation to the next due to selection is called the response to selection, denoted by $R$. The response to selection is related to the selection differential, $S$, and the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, by the breeder's equation:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\n\nThe selection differential, $S$, is the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the mean of the entire population before selection.\n$$S = \\mu_s - \\mu_0$$\n\nWe can calculate the selection differential using the given values:\n$$S = 42.0 \\text{ pg} - 50.0 \\text{ pg} = -8.0 \\text{ pg}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that selection is favoring a smaller trait value (lighter pollen). This type of selection, where an extreme phenotype is favored and the population mean shifts over time, is known as directional selection.\n\nNow, we can calculate the response to selection, $R$:\n$$R = h^2 S = 0.65 \\times (-8.0 \\text{ pg})$$\n$$R = -5.2 \\text{ pg}$$\n\nThe expected mean pollen mass of the next generation, $\\mu_1$, is the mean of the original population plus the response to selection:\n$$\\mu_1 = \\mu_0 + R$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\mu_1 = 50.0 \\text{ pg} + (-5.2 \\text{ pg})$$\n$$\\mu_1 = 44.8 \\text{ pg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Our calculated value, 44.8 pg, already has three significant figures.

This practice [@problem_id:1482003] explores a classic scenario where heterozygotes have the highest fitness, a mechanism known as overdominance. You will analyze how this form of selection impacts allele frequencies in a population, demonstrating how genetic variation can be preserved around an optimal average.", "problem": "In a specific valley, a population of pine trees is subject to two major environmental pressures: intense competition for sunlight and frequent strong winds. The number of large branches a tree develops is a critical trait for its survival and reproductive success. Trees with a low number of branches are often shaded by competitors and have low photosynthetic output. Trees with a high number of branches are more susceptible to wind-induced structural failure. Consequently, trees with an intermediate number of branches exhibit the highest fitness.\n\nThis branching trait is found to be determined by a single gene with two codominant alleles, `B` and `b`. The genotype-phenotype relationship is as follows:\n- `BB`: High number of branches\n- `bb`: Low number of branches\n- `Bb`: Intermediate number of branches\n\nAn initial census of 10,000 zygotes at the start of a generation reveals the following distribution: 2,500 `BB` individuals, 5,000 `Bb` individuals, and 2,500 `bb` individuals. Due to the environmental pressures, the relative fitnesses associated with each genotype are `W_{BB} = 0.70`, `W_{Bb} = 1.00`, and `W_{bb} = 0.40`.\n\nAssuming that the survivors mate randomly to produce the next generation, which of the following statements most accurately describes the type of selection and the frequency of the `b` allele in the new generation of zygotes?\n\nA. The process is stabilizing selection, and the new allele frequency for `b` will be approximately 0.452.\n\nB.

The site consists of two distinct types of soil patches of equal area: Patch A, with a high concentration of toxic heavy metals, and Patch B, with uncontaminated soil.

The values are given as follows:\n\nIn Patch A (high metal concentration):\n- Fitness of `T_HT_H` genotype: `w_{HH, A} = 1.00`\n- Fitness of `T_HT_L` genotype: `w_{HL, A} = 0.40`\n- Fitness of `T_LT_L` genotype: `w_{LL, A} = 0.10`\n\nIn Patch B (uncontaminated soil):\n- Fitness of `T_HT_H` genotype: `w_{HH, B} = 0.30`\n- Fitness of `T_HT_L` genotype: `w_{HL, B} = 0.50`\n- Fitness of `T_LT_L` genotype: `w_{LL, B} = 1.00`\n\nAn initial, large population of seedlings is distributed evenly across both patch types.
