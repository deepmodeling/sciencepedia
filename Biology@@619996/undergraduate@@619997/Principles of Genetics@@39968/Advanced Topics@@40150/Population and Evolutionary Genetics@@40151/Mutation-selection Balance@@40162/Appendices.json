This first exercise provides a foundational calculation for the mutation-selection balance, focusing on the simplest case: a fully recessive and lethal allele.

A new spontaneous mutation is identified that results in a condition termed \"Fragmented Wing Syndrome\". The allele responsible, designated `fw`, is found to be completely recessive to the wild-type allele, `FW`. Individuals homozygous for the `fw` allele (`fw`/`fw`) fail to develop complete wings and are non-viable, dying shortly after eclosion. Through careful molecular analysis, the rate of forward mutation from the `FW` allele to the `fw` allele is determined to be $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ per generation.

Under random mating, genotype frequencies before selection are Hardy–Weinberg proportions: $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$. Because $fw/fw$ is lethal, assign fitnesses $W_{FW/FW}=1$, $W_{FW/fw}=1$, and $W_{fw/fw}=1-s$ with $s=1$.
