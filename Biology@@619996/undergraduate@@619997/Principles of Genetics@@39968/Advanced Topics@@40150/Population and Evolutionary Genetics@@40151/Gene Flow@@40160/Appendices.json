To understand its impact, we can start with a simple, foundational model.

Mastering this calculation is the first step toward quantifying the homogenizing effect of gene flow.", "problem": "A population of an endangered bird species, the Azure-Crested Warbler, lives in an isolated wildlife sanctuary. Genetic analysis reveals that the frequency of a particular allele, $R$, which provides resistance to a prevalent fungal pathogen, is currently at a frequency of $p_{sanctuary} = 0.30$ within this sanctuary population.\n\nTo bolster the genetic health and disease resistance of this isolated group, a conservation program introduces a number of birds from a large, stable continental population. The frequency of the same $R$ allele in the continental population is $P_{continental} = 0.80$.\n\nAfter the introduction event, the newly arrived birds from the continent make up a fraction $m = 0.05$ of the total sanctuary population in the next generation. Assuming random mating occurs within the mixed population, what will be the new frequency of the $R$ allele in the sanctuary population in the single generation immediately following this gene flow event?\n\nProvide your answer as a decimal value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p_{t}$ denote the allele frequency of $R$ in the sanctuary after the migration event but before selection. Under the standard one-generation migration (gene flow) model, when a fraction $m$ of the next generation consists of migrants with allele frequency $P_{continental}$ and the remaining fraction $1 - m$ comes from residents with allele frequency $p_{sanctuary}$, the new allele frequency is given by the weighted average:\n$$\np_{t} = (1 - m)\\,p_{sanctuary} + m\\,P_{continental}.\n$$\nThis follows from the principle that allele frequencies in the mixed population are the sum of contributions from residents and migrants weighted by their proportions. Random mating within the mixed population does not change allele frequencies across a single generation in the absence of selection, mutation, or drift (Hardy–Weinberg principle), so the allele frequency among zygotes remains $p_{t}$.\n\nSubstitute the given values $p_{sanctuary} = 0.30$, $P_{continental} = 0.80$, and $m = 0.05$:\n$$\np_{t} = (1 - 0.05)\\times 0.30 + 0.05 \\times 0.80\n= 0.95 \\times 0.30 + 0.05 \\times 0.80\n= 0.285 + 0.040\n= 0.325.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.325$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.325}$$", "id": "1490576"}, {"introduction": "While predicting the outcome of gene flow is useful, population geneticists often work in reverse, using observed genetic changes to infer past evolutionary events.

The captive-bred population has been managed to have a high frequency of this allele, specifically $p_{captive} = 0.75$. After the release, the populations are assumed to mix completely. In the next generation, a genetic survey of the combined population reveals that the frequency of the same allele has risen to $p'_{new} = 0.28$.\n\nAssuming this change is due solely to the introduction of the captive-bred individuals (i.e., this is a one-way migration event and we can ignore the effects of selection and genetic drift for this single generation), calculate the proportion of the new, combined population that consists of the introduced captive-bred possums.
