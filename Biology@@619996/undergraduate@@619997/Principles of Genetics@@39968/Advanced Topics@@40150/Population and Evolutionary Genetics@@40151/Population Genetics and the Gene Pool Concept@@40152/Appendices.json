This equilibrium links allele frequencies to genotype frequencies under specific conditions of random mating and the absence of evolutionary forces.

A key survival trait of this organism is its ability to synthesize a complex antifreeze protein, a characteristic governed by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for high-efficiency protein synthesis, denoted by $A$, is completely dominant over the allele for low-efficiency synthesis, $a$. The low-efficiency phenotype ($aa$) is easily identifiable in culture due to a slower growth rate at freezing temperatures.\n\nIn a large, stable, isolated sample population containing 7,200 individual organisms, the biologists identify 530 individuals that exhibit the low-efficiency phenotype. Assuming the population is mating randomly and is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the expected frequency of organisms in this population that are heterozygous carriers of the low-efficiency allele.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $a$.

This exercise moves us from a static to a dynamic model by introducing natural selection, one of the primary mechanisms of evolution.
