The ability to produce a bright, continuous glow is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a bright glow ($G$) is dominant over the allele for a faint, pulsating glow ($g$). A large, isolated population of these organisms is studied by marine biologists. It is assumed that the population mates randomly and is not subject to mutation, gene flow, or natural selection with respect to this trait.
