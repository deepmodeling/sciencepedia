This practice focuses on the crucial distinction between orthologs, which arise from speciation events, and paralogs, which arise from gene duplication events.

These homologs can be further classified into two distinct categories: orthologs and paralogs. Consider the $\\beta$-globin gene, which codes for a subunit of hemoglobin. Both humans and gorillas possess a functional $\\beta$-globin gene in their genomes. A student is asked to determine the evolutionary relationship between the human $\\beta$-globin gene and the gorilla $\\beta$-globin gene.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately classifies this pair of genes and provides the correct evolutionary justification?\n\nA. They are orthologs because they exist in different species (human and gorilla) and originated from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of these two species. Their divergence is the result of a speciation event.\n\nB. They are paralogs because, while they share a common ancestor, they have diverged in function slightly between humans and gorillas. Their divergence is the result of a gene duplication event in the last common ancestor.\n\nC. They are orthologs because the $\\beta$-globin gene is part of the larger globin gene family, which arose through multiple rounds of gene duplication.\n\nD. They are paralogs because they are found in two different, albeit closely related, species. Their divergence is the result of a speciation event that separated the human and gorilla lineages.", "solution": "I begin by recalling the standard definitions in evolutionary genetics. Homologous genes are genes that share a common evolutionary ancestor. Among homologs, orthologs are homologous genes found in different species that diverged following a speciation event from a single gene present in the last common ancestor of those species. Paralogs are homologous genes that arise within a lineage due to a gene duplication event; their divergence is attributed to duplication, not speciation.\n\nThe $\\beta$-globin gene in humans and the $\\beta$-globin gene in gorillas are corresponding genes at the same locus in their respective genomes. Both derive from the $\\beta$-globin gene present in the last common ancestor of humans and gorillas. The divergence between the human and gorilla versions occurred when the human and gorilla lineages split; this is a speciation event. Therefore, by definition, these two genes are orthologs.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the relationship among different members of the globin gene family (such as $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$), which arose through gene duplication events. Those relationships (for example, human $\\beta$ versus human $\\delta$) are paralogous. However, comparing the same gene copy across species (human $\\beta$ versus gorilla $\\beta$) reflects orthology, not paralogy.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A correctly states that the human and gorilla $\\beta$-globin genes are orthologs, tracing to a single ancestral gene in their last common ancestor, with divergence due to speciation. This matches the definition.\n- Option B incorrectly classifies them as paralogs and attributes divergence to gene duplication in the last common ancestor. That mechanism would produce paralogs within a genome, not orthologs across species.\n- Option C gives an incorrect justification: while the globin family arose via duplications, that fact supports paralogy among different globin copies, not orthology of the same gene across species.\n- Option D misdefines paralogs and incorrectly attributes their divergence to speciation, which is contradictory since speciation defines orthology.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification and justification are given in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1494077"}, {"introduction": "Why do some parts of the genome barely change over millions of years? This exercise explores the concept of purifying selection by examining a highly conserved non-coding DNA sequence. As you analyze this scenario, you'll learn how to identify the signature of functional importance, where evolution works not to create change, but to prevent it, preserving sequences with critical biological roles [@problem_id:1494092].", "problem": "Genomic comparison studies have revealed a fascinating phenomenon. A specific 250 base-pair non-coding DNA sequence is found to be 100% identical in the genomes of humans, lizards, and frogs. The last common ancestor of these three groups is estimated to have lived over 300 million years ago. Given that non-coding DNA is generally thought to evolve more freely than protein-coding DNA because it is not constrained by the need to produce a functional protein, this extreme conservation is remarkable.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most scientifically plausible explanation for why this 250 base-pair non-coding region has remained unchanged across such vast evolutionary timescales?\n\nA. The region is under strong positive selection, which has prevented any changes from occurring.\n\nB. The identity of the sequence is purely coincidental, a result of random chance and genetic drift over millions of years.\n\nC. This specific region of the genome has a natural mutation rate of zero, making it immune to evolutionary change.\n\nD. The sequence is maintained by ongoing lateral gene transfer events between the modern species.\n\nE. The region is under strong purifying selection, suggesting it has a critical biological function that is intolerant to mutation.", "solution": "We begin with the neutral theory baseline. Let the per-site mutation rate be $\\mu$ per generation and let $t_{h}$, $t_{l}$, and $t_{f}$ denote the numbers of generations since the last common ancestor along the human, lizard, and frog lineages, respectively. Under neutrality and ignoring back-mutation for a conservative upper bound on identity, the probability that a single site remains unchanged along a single lineage of length $t$ is approximately $\\exp(-\\mu t)$. Because the three lineages evolve independently after divergence, the probability that a single site remains unchanged in all three is $\\exp(-\\mu (t_{h}+t_{l}+t_{f}))$. For $L=250$ independent sites, the probability that all sites remain identical is\n$$\n\\left[\\exp(-\\mu (t_{h}+t_{l}+t_{f}))\\right]^{L}=\\exp\\left(-L\\,\\mu\\,(t_{h}+t_{l}+t_{f})\\right).\n$$\nFor any $\\mu>0$ and large $t_{h}+t_{l}+t_{f}$ (hundreds of millions of years worth of generations), this probability becomes vanishingly small. Therefore, option B (pure chance under drift) is not a plausible explanation.\n\nConsider strong positive selection (option A). Positive selection increases the fixation probability of novel mutations and typically accelerates the rate of substitution. Sustained positive selection would drive repeated adaptive changes, not long-term stasis. Thus, positive selection does not preserve perfect identity across deep time.\n\nConsider a zero mutation rate in this region (option C). There is no known genomic region with exactly zero mutation rate; replication and chemical processes impose a nonzero baseline $\\mu$. Even with highly efficient repair or chromatin context reducing $\\mu$, setting $\\mu=0$ is biologically untenable. Hence, option C is implausible.\n\nConsider ongoing lateral gene transfer between these vertebrates (option D). Horizontal gene transfer among vertebrates is exceedingly rare and cannot reasonably account for precise maintenance of a 250 base-pair identity across three distantly related lineages separated for over three hundred million years. Moreover, it would require recurrent transfer events maintaining perfect sequence identity without detection of flanking signatures, which is not supported by vertebrate genomic patterns.\n\nFinally, consider strong purifying selection (option E). If the region has a critical function (for example, as a regulatory element such as an enhancer or other conserved non-coding element), most mutations would be deleterious with selection coefficient $s<0$, leading to near-zero fixation probability for such variants. Under purifying selection, the expected substitution rate is suppressed well below $\\mu$, and the probability that sites remain unchanged over long time becomes high relative to the neutral expectation. The observation of complete identity across deep divergence is a hallmark of ultraconserved non-coding elements constrained by essential biological function. Therefore, strong purifying selection is the most scientifically plausible explanation.\n\nThus, the best choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1494092"}, {"introduction": "Genome evolution leaves behind clues that can be used to reconstruct the past. This advanced practice invites you to act as a molecular detective, dating a complex gene duplication event using DNA sequence data. By applying different 'molecular clock' rates to a functional gene and its non-functional pseudogene counterpart, you will synthesize multiple evolutionary concepts to solve for an unknown time, demonstrating a powerful quantitative approach in genomics [@problem_id:1494053].", "problem": "A team of molecular evolutionists is investigating the origin of a lectin gene in a species of flowering plant. The gene, which we will call `G_plant`, encodes a protein with two structural domains, `A` and `B`. In related fungal species, the homologous lectin protein is encoded by a gene `G_fungus` and has its domains arranged in the order `N-terminus -- A -- B -- C-terminus`. However, in the plant, the gene `G_plant` encodes a protein with a circularly permuted structure, `N-terminus -- B -- A -- C-terminus`.\n\nThe prevailing hypothesis for this rearrangement is a tandem duplication event of an ancestral gene (`G_anc`, identical in structure to `G_fungus`) that occurred at a time `T_event` in the past within the plant lineage. This duplication created a `[Domain A] - [Domain B] - [Domain A] - [Domain B]` sequence on the chromosome. Subsequently, mutations to transcriptional and translational signals caused a new functional gene, `G_plant`, to be expressed from the central `[Domain B] - [Domain A]` segment.\n\nThe original outermost domains from the duplicated segment—the first `Domain A` and the last `Domain B`—were not incorporated into the new gene. These segments became non-functional \"fossil\" sequences known as pseudogenes, `psi_A` and `psi_B`, which can still be found flanking the active `G_plant` gene.\n\nThe functional domains within `G_plant` (`A_func` and `B_func`) are under purifying selection and accumulate nucleotide substitutions at a suppressed rate of $r_s = 2.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year. The pseudogene `psi_A`, being free from selective pressure, accumulates substitutions at the higher neutral rate of $r_n = 6.5 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nBy sequencing and comparing the DNA of the functional domain `A_func` with its corresponding pseudogene `psi_A`, the researchers have measured the total nucleotide divergence between them to be $K = 0.535$ substitutions per site. Assume that the divergence $K$ between two DNA sequences that diverged $T$ years ago and evolved at respective rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ is given by the formula $K = (r_1 + r_2)T$. At the moment of duplication, the sequences for `A_func` and `psi_A` were identical.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the time `T_event` when the gene duplication event occurred. Express your answer in millions of years, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are told that at the duplication time, the sequences that became the functional domain $A_{\\text{func}}$ and the pseudogene $\\psi_{A}$ were identical. After duplication, they accumulated substitutions independently at rates $r_{s}$ (purifying selection on $A_{\\text{func}}$) and $r_{n}$ (neutral evolution on $\\psi_{A}$). The total divergence between them after time $T_{\\text{event}}$ is given by the additivity of rates:\n$$\nK=(r_{1}+r_{2})T,\n$$\nwith $r_{1}=r_{s}$ and $r_{2}=r_{n}$.
