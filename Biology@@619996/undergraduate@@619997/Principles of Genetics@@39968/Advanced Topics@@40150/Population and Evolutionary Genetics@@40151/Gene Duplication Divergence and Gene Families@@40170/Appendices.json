Its blood contains a family of antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) proteins that prevent the formation of ice crystals. Genetic analysis of this species has identified two closely related paralogous genes, `AFGP-alpha` and `AFGP-beta`, which are believed to have arisen from a single gene duplication event.\n\nA comparison of the coding sequences of these two genes reveals that they have a sequence divergence of 8.4%. The estimated rate of neutral nucleotide substitution for this lineage of fish has been determined to be $2.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nAssuming that the observed sequence divergence is entirely due to the accumulation of neutral mutations after the duplication event, calculate how long ago this duplication occurred. Express your answer in millions of years, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks us to calculate the time since a gene duplication event occurred, given the percentage of sequence divergence between the two resulting paralogous genes and the neutral mutation rate. This can be solved using the principles of the molecular clock.\n\nThe core idea is that the amount of genetic divergence between two sequences is proportional to the time since they last shared a common ancestor. In this case, the common ancestor is the single gene right before the duplication event.\n\nLet $D$ be the sequence divergence, which is the fraction of sites that differ between the two genes.\nLet $\\mu$ be the neutral mutation rate per site per year.\nLet $T$ be the time in years since the duplication event.\n\nAfter the duplication, two separate gene lineages are created (`AFGP-alpha` and `AFGP-beta`). Both of these lineages accumulate mutations independently for a time $T$. Therefore, the total evolutionary time separating the two present-day genes is the sum of the time along both branches, which is $T + T = 2T$.\n\nThe total divergence $D$ is the product of the mutation rate $\\mu$ and this total evolutionary time ($2T$). The relationship is given by the formula:\n$$D = 2 \\mu T$$\nWe need to solve for $T$. Rearranging the formula, we get:\n$$T = \\frac{D}{2 \\mu}$$\nNow, we can substitute the a given values into this equation.\n\nThe sequence divergence is given as 8.4%. As a fraction, this is:\n$$D = 8.4\\% = 0.084$$\nThe neutral mutation rate is:\n$$\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ substitutions per site per year}$$\nNow, we substitute these values into our rearranged formula for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{0.084}{2 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ year}^{-1})}$$\n$$T = \\frac{0.084}{4.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ year}^{-1}}$$\n$$T = 2.1 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ years}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in millions of years. Since $1 \\text{ million} = 10^6$, we can convert our result:\n$$T = 2.1 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ years} = 21 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ years} = 21 \\text{ million years}$$\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

A key question is to determine what kind of evolutionary pressure is acting on this new gene. By comparing the rate of protein-altering (nonsynonymous) mutations to silent (synonymous) mutations, we can calculate the $d_N/d_S$ ratio, a powerful indicator of selective pressure. This exercise [@problem_id:1490351] challenges you to interpret a specific $d_N/d_S$ value to diagnose a case of positive selection, the driving force behind the evolution of new gene functions, known as neofunctionalization.", "problem": "Gene duplication is a major evolutionary mechanism for the creation of new genes. Following a duplication event, one copy of the gene is free from the selective pressures that constrained the original, single-copy gene. This allows it to evolve in different ways. Molecular evolutionary geneticists often infer the type of selection acting on a gene by comparing the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site ($d_N$), which alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, to the rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ($d_S$), which do not alter the amino acid sequence.\n\nImagine a gene, `ToxR`, which encodes a protein that helps an insect neutralize a specific plant toxin, has recently undergone a duplication event. One copy, `ToxR-A`, remains identical to the ancestral gene. The second copy, `ToxR-B`, begins to accumulate mutations. After several hundred generations, genomic analysis of the `ToxR-B` gene lineage shows that the ratio $d_N/d_S$ is 2.1.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following describes the most probable evolutionary fate of the `ToxR-B` gene?\n\nA. Pseudogenization, where the gene has accumulated random mutations and is no longer functional.\n\nB. Neofunctionalization, where the gene is under positive selection to acquire a new or modified function.\n\nC. Subfunctionalization, where the gene has lost part of its original function, which is now solely performed by the `ToxR-A` copy.\n\nD. Strong purifying selection, where the gene is being maintained to perform the exact same function as the `ToxR-A` copy.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definitions and standard interpretations in molecular evolution. Let $d_{N}$ denote the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site and $d_{S}$ denote the rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. The ratio $d_{N}/d_{S}$ is interpreted as follows:\n- If a gene is under strong purifying selection preserving protein function, then nonsynonymous changes are deleterious and removed, so $d_{N} < d_{S}$ and $d_{N}/d_{S} < 1$.\n- If a gene evolves neutrally (e.g., after loss of function), then nonsynonymous and synonymous changes are both effectively neutral, so $d_{N} \\approx d_{S}$ and $d_{N}/d_{S} \\approx 1$.\n- If a gene is under positive selection for altered protein function, advantageous nonsynonymous changes are fixed more rapidly than synonymous changes, so $d_{N} > d_{S}$ and $d_{N}/d_{S} > 1$.\n\nAfter duplication, possible fates include:\n- Pseudogenization: loss of function with neutral evolution, predicting $d_{N}/d_{S} \\approx 1$.\n- Subfunctionalization: partitioning of ancestral functions between duplicates, typically maintaining function under constraint within each subfunction, predicting $d_{N}/d_{S} \\leq 1$ overall.\n- Neofunctionalization: acquisition of a new or modified function driven by adaptive changes, predicting $d_{N}/d_{S} > 1$.\n\nIn the given case for the duplicated gene copy $ToxR$-$B$, the observed value is $d_{N}/d_{S} = 2.1$. Since $2.1 > 1$, this indicates an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions relative to synonymous ones, the hallmark of positive selection on protein sequence. Therefore, the most probable evolutionary fate is neofunctionalization.\n\nThis rules out the alternatives:\n- A (pseudogenization) would predict $d_{N}/d_{S} \\approx 1$, not $2.1$.\n- C (subfunctionalization) would generally maintain constraint with $d_{N}/d_{S} \\leq 1$.\n- D (strong purifying selection) explicitly requires $d_{N}/d_{S} < 1$.\n\nHence, the correct choice is neofunctionalization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1490351"}, {"introduction": "The history of a gene family across multiple species is often more complex than the history of the species themselves, due to a messy record of gene duplications and subsequent losses.

The accepted species phylogeny, representing the evolutionary history of the species themselves, is described by the notation `(A, (B, (C, (D, E))))`. This notation indicates that the lineage leading to Species A split from the common ancestor of B, C, D, and E; subsequently, the lineage to B split from the ancestor of C, D, and E, and so on.\n\nAfter sequencing, the biologist identifies several members of the RF gene family in these species. The gene copies are designated by the species letter followed by a number (e.g., `gA1` is the first RF gene copy found in Species A). A phylogenetic analysis of these gene sequences yields the following gene tree: `(((gA1, gB1), gD1), (gC1, (gE1, (gC2, gE2))))`.\n\nThe structure of this gene tree is incongruent with the species tree. Such incongruence can be explained by a history of gene duplication and subsequent gene loss events within the different species lineages.
