This exercise examines the theoretical maximum genetic diversity that can possibly survive a severe bottleneck, reinforcing the fundamental constraints imposed by the diploid nature of an organism. By establishing this upper limit, we can better appreciate the probabilistic genetic losses that are characteristic of such events [@problem_id:1488789].", "problem": "A catastrophic wildfire sweeps through a remote island, decimating the population of a rare, endemic species of flightless bird. This event represents a severe population bottleneck. Conservation biologists manage to rescue just two survivors, one male and one female, to start a captive breeding program. Assuming this bird species is diploid and reproduces sexually, what is the theoretical maximum number of distinct alleles for a single autosomal gene that could be present in this founding population of two individuals?\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 4\n\nE. 8", "solution": "A diploid organism carries two homologous copies of each autosomal locus, so each individual contributes two alleles for a single autosomal gene. Let the ploidy be $p=2$ and the number of founding individuals be $n=2$. The total number of allele copies present at the locus in the founding population is\n$$\nC = p n = 2 \\times 2 = 4.\n$$\nThe number of distinct alleles $A$ present cannot exceed the number of allele copies, so $A \\leq C$. The theoretical maximum is achieved when every allele copy is different. This is possible by assigning the male genotype $A_{1}/A_{2}$ and the female genotype $A_{3}/A_{4}$ with $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},A_{4}$ all distinct, which is compatible with an autosomal locus in a diploid species. Therefore,\n$$\nA_{\\max} = 4.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1488789"}, {"introduction": "Founder events are fundamentally about sampling, where a new population inherits only a subset of the genetic variation from its larger source. This practice uses a hypothetical conservation scenario to quantify the significant probability that rare alleles are lost entirely during this random sampling process. This highlights a core consequence of the founder effect: the unpredictable and often substantial loss of genetic diversity [@problem_id:1488762].", "problem": "A conservation team is planning to reintroduce the fictional Azure-Spotted Fritillary butterfly to a protected island sanctuary. The source population on the mainland is very large and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Within this source population, there exists a rare, recessive allele that results in a pale blue spot coloration instead of the usual deep azure. Genetic analysis of the mainland population has determined that the frequency of this recessive pale-blue allele is $q = 0.01$. The conservation team captures 15 diploid butterflies to establish the new founding population on the island. Assuming the captured butterflies represent a random sample from the mainland population, calculate the probability that the pale-blue allele is completely absent in this founding group. Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The source population is assumed very large and in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with recessive allele frequency $q$. For a random sample of $N$ diploid individuals, there are $2N$ independent allele draws from the gene pool (valid under the large-population assumption). Let $X$ be the number of pale-blue alleles among the $2N$ sampled alleles. Then $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(2N, q)$.\n\nThe probability that the pale-blue allele is completely absent in the founding group is the probability of zero successes:\n$$\nP(X=0)= (1-q)^{2N}.\n$$\n\nHere, $N=15$ and $q=0.01$, so\n$$\nP=(1-0.01)^{2\\cdot 15} = 0.99^{30}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n0.99^{30} \\approx 0.739700373\\ldots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.7397$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7397}$$", "id": "1488762"}, {"introduction": "While losing specific alleles is a key concern, population geneticists often measure the impact of a bottleneck by its effect on overall genetic diversity, which is commonly quantified by average heterozygosity. This exercise provides a direct comparison showing how the severity of a bottleneck—specifically the effective population size ($N_e$)—influences the rate at which heterozygosity is lost. This reveals a critical principle in conservation genetics: even a brief reduction in population size can have a lasting impact on a population's genetic health [@problem_id:1488783].", "problem": "A conservation program for the critically endangered Sky-Horned Antelope establishes two new, isolated populations, Population A and Population B, from a large and genetically diverse captive-bred stock.
