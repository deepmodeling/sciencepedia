The neutral theory provides a powerful framework for understanding this journey when the mutation offers no selective advantage or disadvantage.

The population size has remained stable for many generations at 400 diploid individuals. Through genetic sequencing, they identify a novel allele that has just arisen from a single, new mutation in one individual. Subsequent studies confirm that this new allele is selectively neutral; it provides no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage to the organism. Assuming genetic drift is the sole evolutionary mechanism influencing the fate of this allele, calculate the initial probability that this new neutral allele will eventually spread through the entire population and become fixed.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The key population-genetic principle for a selectively neutral allele in a Wright–Fisher population is that its probability of eventual fixation equals its initial allele frequency. Let $N$ denote the number of diploid individuals, so there are $2N$ gene copies at the locus.\n\nA single new mutation appears in one gene copy, so the initial allele count is $1$ and the initial allele frequency is\n$$\nx_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nFor a neutral allele, the fixation probability is\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}=x_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nWith $N=400$ diploid individuals,\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}=\\frac{1}{2\\times 400}=\\frac{1}{800}=0.00125.\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal to three significant figures, this is $0.00125$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00125}$$", "id": "1527875"}, {"introduction": "Not all mutations are perfectly neutral; many might be slightly deleterious. The fate of such an allele depends on a tug-of-war between weak natural selection, aiming to remove it, and random genetic drift. A key insight of population genetics is that in small populations, drift can be powerful enough to overwhelm weak selection, allowing a slightly harmful allele to behave as if it were neutral. This practice problem quantitatively explores this critical relationship between population size $N_e$ and the selection coefficient $s$, demonstrating how \"effective neutrality\" is a context-dependent property [@problem_id:1972587].", "problem": "In population genetics, the fate of a new mutation is determined by the interplay of genetic drift and natural selection. While beneficial mutations are favored by selection and strongly deleterious ones are quickly eliminated, the outcome for slightly deleterious mutations is more subtle and depends heavily on population size.\n\nThe fixation probability ($P_{fix}$), which is the probability that a new allele will eventually spread to 100% frequency in a population, can be modeled mathematically. For a new mutation in a diploid population with an effective size of $N_e$ and a selection coefficient of $s$, the fixation probability is given by:\n$$ P_{fix} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4N_e s)} $$\nFor the special case of a strictly neutral mutation ($s=0$), this probability simplifies to $P_{fix, neutral} = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.\n\nConsider a slightly deleterious mutation that arises in a small, isolated population of a diploid species. The selection coefficient for this mutation is $s = -1.25 \\times 10^{-4}$, and the effective population size is $N_e = 2000$.\n\nTo quantify the extent to which genetic drift can overwhelm weak selection in this scenario, calculate the ratio $R = \\frac{P_{fix}}{P_{fix, neutral}}$. This ratio compares the fixation probability of the deleterious allele to that of a completely neutral one.\n\nCalculate the value of this ratio $R$.
