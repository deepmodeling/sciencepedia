In special cases like incomplete dominance, each genotype corresponds to a unique, observable phenotype, which allows us to determine the genetic makeup of individuals directly. This exercise with snapdragons [@problem_id:1472676] provides a concrete foundation for understanding what an allele frequency represents before we move on to scenarios where genotypes are not as easily distinguished.", "problem": "A field biologist is studying the genetics of flower color in a wild population of snapdragons (*Antirrhinum majus*). In this species, flower color is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, $C^R$ and $C^W$, which exhibit incomplete dominance. The genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are as follows: plants with the $C^R C^R$ genotype produce red flowers, plants with the $C^W C^W$ genotype produce white flowers, and heterozygous plants ($C^R C^W$) produce pink flowers.\n\nDuring a field survey, the biologist counted the number of plants with each flower color in a large, isolated meadow. The survey recorded 85 plants with red flowers, 150 plants with pink flowers, and 65 plants with white flowers.\n\nCalculate the frequencies of the $C^R$ and $C^W$ alleles in this population. Present your answer as two numbers: the frequency of the $C^R$ allele first, followed by the frequency of the $C^W$ allele.

Since there are only two alleles at this locus, $p+q=1$.\n\nBecause the alleles $C^R$ and $C^W$ exhibit incomplete dominance, each phenotype corresponds uniquely to a genotype: red $\\leftrightarrow$ $C^R C^R$, pink $\\leftrightarrow$ $C^R C^W$, white $\\leftrightarrow$ $C^W C^W$.

In these common situations, the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle becomes an essential tool, serving as a baseline model for a population that is not evolving.

The ability for a firefly to perfectly synchronize its flash with the group is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele 'S' for synchronized flashing and a recessive allele 's' for sporadic, unsynchronized flashing. An individual will only exhibit the sporadic flashing phenotype if it has the homozygous recessive genotype ($ss$). Field biologists observe that 45 individuals in this population exhibit sporadic flashing. Assuming this population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), calculate the number of individuals that are expected to be heterozygous ($Ss$).", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of allele $S$ and $q$ the frequency of allele $s$, with Hardy-Weinberg conditions implying $p+q=1$ and genotype frequencies $p^2$ for $SS$, $2pq$ for $Ss$, and $q^2$ for $ss$.\n\nSporadic flashing occurs only in $ss$, so the observed fraction of sporadic individuals equals $q^2$.

This advanced practice explores such a deviation by introducing the concept of inbreeding and its quantification through the inbreeding coefficient, $F$.

A sample of the population is collected, and genotyping reveals the following counts for the three possible genotypes: 105 individuals are homozygous for allele $A_1$ ($A_1A_1$), 30 are heterozygous ($A_1A_2$), and 65 are homozygous for allele $A_2$ ($A_2A_2$).\n\nIn a population at equilibrium under a mixed-mating system, the proportion of heterozygotes is reduced compared to a randomly mating population.
