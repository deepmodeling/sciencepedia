The selection coefficient, denoted by $s$, provides a precise measure of the selective disadvantage of a particular genotype compared to the most fit genotype in the population. This exercise provides foundational practice in calculating $s$ directly from survival data, a core skill for quantifying the evolutionary pressures at play in a given environment.

The allele $A$ is completely dominant and results in a thick shell, while the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$, results in a thin shell. A new crab predator has been introduced into the snails' habitat. This crab preys on the snails by crushing their shells.\n\nTo study the impact of this new selective pressure, biologists observed a large cohort of newborn snails. They found that for every 100 individuals with thick shells (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) that survive to reach reproductive maturity, only 98 individuals with thin shells (genotype $aa$) survive to the same stage.\n\nAssuming survival to maturity is the only factor determining fitness in this context, calculate the selection coefficient, $s$, acting against the thin-shelled ($aa$) genotype. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "The first step is to determine the relative fitness ($w$) of each genotype. Relative fitness is a measure of the reproductive success of a genotype compared to the most successful genotype in the population. By convention, the most successful genotype is assigned a fitness value of $w=1$.\n\nIn this scenario, the snails with thick shells (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) have the highest survival rate. We can set their survival rate as the reference. Let's denote the survival rate of thick-shelled snails as $S_{A-}$. The survival rate of thin-shelled snails is $S_{aa}$. The problem states that the ratio of survival is $S_{aa} / S_{A-} = 98/100 = 0.98$.\n\nWe assign the relative fitness of the most successful genotypes ($AA$ and $Aa$) to be 1.\n$$w_{AA} = 1$$\n$$w_{Aa} = 1$$\n\nThe relative fitness of the less successful genotype ($aa$) is calculated by comparing its survival rate to that of the most successful genotype.\n$$w_{aa} = \\frac{\\text{Survival rate of } aa}{\\text{Survival rate of } A-}$$\nGiven the data, for every 100 surviving thick-shelled snails, there are 98 surviving thin-shelled snails. This directly gives us the relative survival rate.\n$$w_{aa} = \\frac{98}{100} = 0.98$$\n\nThe selection coefficient, $s$, quantifies the strength of natural selection against a specific genotype. It is defined as the reduction in fitness relative to the most fit genotype. The formula for the selection coefficient is:\n$$s = 1 - w$$\nWe are asked to find the selection coefficient acting against the thin-shelled ($aa$) genotype. Using the relative fitness $w_{aa}$ we calculated:\n$$s_{aa} = 1 - w_{aa}$$\nSubstituting the value of $w_{aa}$:\n$$s_{aa} = 1 - 0.98$$\n$$s_{aa} = 0.02$$\nThus, the selection coefficient against the homozygous recessive genotype is 0.02.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02}$$", "id": "1505884"}, {"introduction": "Once we can quantify selection, we can begin to predict its evolutionary consequences.
