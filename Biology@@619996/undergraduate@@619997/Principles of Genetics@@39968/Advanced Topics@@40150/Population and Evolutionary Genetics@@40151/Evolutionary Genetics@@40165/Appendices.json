The disorder is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: the dominant allele for the normal phenotype, denoted as $X^A$, and the recessive allele causing the disorder, denoted as $X^a$. The population is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to this X-linked locus. A comprehensive genetic survey of the population's gene pool reveals that the frequency of the recessive disorder-causing allele ($X^a$) is 0.04.\n\nCalculate the expected frequencies of all possible genotypes for both females and males in this population.
