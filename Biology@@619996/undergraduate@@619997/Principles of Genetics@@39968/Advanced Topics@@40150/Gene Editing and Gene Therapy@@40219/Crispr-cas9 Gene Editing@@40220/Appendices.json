The gene's DNA sequence is provided below, with the top strand being the coding strand. The gene contains two exons and one intron. The first exon spans from nucleotide position 1 to 30, and the second exon begins at nucleotide position 61.\n\n5'- AATTGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGATTACAGATTACAGATTACAGGCTATAGCTAGCTAGCTA -3'\n3'- TTAACCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCCATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACCTAATGTCTAATGTCTAATGTCCTGATATCGATCGATCGAT -5'\n\nTo disrupt this gene, the biologist plans to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). This system employs a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific location in the genome. The targeting specificity is determined by two factors: a 20-nucleotide sequence within the sgRNA and a DNA motif called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nThe rules for SpCas9 targeting are as follows:\n1.  The Cas9 enzyme first recognizes the PAM sequence on the DNA. For SpCas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases (A, T, C, G).\n2.  The PAM sequence must be present on the non-template strand (the strand that is not used as a template for gRNA binding).\n3.  The 20-nucleotide target site, known as the protospacer, is the sequence on the non-template strand located immediately upstream (to the 5' side) of the PAM sequence.\n4.  The 20-nucleotide guide portion of the sgRNA must have a sequence that is complementary to the template strand at the target site. This is equivalent to saying the sgRNA sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence, with all instances of Thymine (T) replaced by Uracil (U).\n\nYour task is to design a 20-nucleotide sgRNA sequence that will direct the Cas9 nuclease to cut as close as possible to the beginning of the second exon.\n\nProvide the sequence of this 20-nucleotide guide RNA in the 5' to 3' orientation.", "solution": "We are given that the top strand is the coding strand and that exon 2 begins at nucleotide position 61. For SpCas9, the targeting rules to apply are:\n- The PAM must be 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand.\n- The 20-nt protospacer is immediately upstream (5' side) of the PAM on the same non-template strand.\n- The sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence with all T replaced by U (RNA), and is written 5' to 3'.\n\nIndex the provided top-strand sequence and mark the exon boundary at position 61. The intron spans positions 31 to 60, so the second exon begins at position 61. We search for the nearest PAM 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand as close as possible to position 61. Taking the top strand as the non-template strand for a potential target, scan for NGG near position 61. In the second exon region, the first occurrence of NGG on the top strand is at positions 81–83, which is 5'-AGG-3'.\n\nBy rule, the corresponding 20-nt protospacer on the non-template (top) strand is the sequence immediately upstream of that PAM, i.e., positions 61 through 80 inclusive. Reading the top strand from position 61 to 80 gives the 20-nt protospacer:\nGATTACAGATTACAGATTAC.\n\nThis site places the protospacer starting exactly at the beginning of exon 2 (position 61), and the PAM-adjacent cut by SpCas9 would occur upstream of the PAM, keeping the cleavage close to the exon start. Checking the opposite orientation (PAM on the bottom strand), which would require a 5'-CCN-3' motif on the top strand near position 61, reveals no CCN motif close enough to yield a cut closer to position 61 than the top-strand PAM at 81–83. Therefore, the top-strand PAM at 81–83 provides the closest feasible cut to the beginning of exon 2.\n\nThe sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer with T replaced by U, written 5' to 3'.

This practice delves into the crucial issue of off-target effects by challenging you to evaluate the specificity of different guide RNA designs [@problem_id:1480232]. You will apply the concept of the \"seed region\"—the critical portion of the guide RNA adjacent to the PAM—to predict which design carries a higher risk of causing unwanted mutations.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is planning an experiment using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* to functionally inactivate a gene of interest, \"Gene X\", in a human cell line. The inactivation will be achieved by introducing a double-strand break, leading to a frameshift mutation via non-homologous end joining.\n\nThe system works as follows: The Cas9 nuclease is directed to a specific DNA target sequence by a guide RNA (gRNA). The spacer region of the gRNA is complementary to one of the DNA strands (the target strand). For the Cas9 protein to bind and cleave the DNA, the target sequence must be immediately followed by a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) on the non-target DNA strand. For *S. pyogenes* Cas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where N can be any nucleotide.\n\nThe researcher is concerned about potential \"off-target\" effects, where the gRNA-Cas9 complex might cleave an unintended location in the genome. An off-target cleavage event in an essential gene, \"Gene Y\", would be lethal to the cells. It is known that the tolerance for mismatches between the gRNA spacer and the DNA is not uniform; mismatches in the 8-10 nucleotides at the 3' end of the gRNA spacer (the \"seed region,\" which is adjacent to the PAM) are much more likely to abolish binding than mismatches located further away from the PAM.\n\nThe researcher has found a potential off-target site within the coding sequence of the essential Gene Y. The sequence of the non-target DNA strand in this region is:\n**Gene Y site:** `5'-...AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACCTGG...-3'`\n\nThe researcher has designed two possible gRNAs to target Gene X. The spacer sequences for these two gRNAs (written as their DNA equivalents, 5' to 3') are:\n\n**gRNA Spacer A:** `5'-AGAGATTGCTCGGACATGCACC-3'`\n**gRNA Spacer B:** `5'-TACCATTGCTAGGACAGGGGCC-3'`\n\nBased on the principles of CRISPR-Cas9 targeting and the potential for a lethal off-target effect at the given site in Gene Y, which of the two gRNA spacers represents a poorer design choice?\n\nA. gRNA Spacer A\n\nB. gRNA Spacer B", "solution": "Principle of targeting: For Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, cleavage requires a 5'-NGG-3' PAM on the non-target DNA strand, with the protospacer immediately upstream (5' of the PAM) on that same non-target strand. The gRNA spacer base-pairs to the opposite (target) strand and is therefore identical in sequence to the non-target protospacer (both written 5' to 3'), aside from any mismatches. Off-target risk is dominated by complementarity in the seed region, the approximately 8 to 10 nucleotides at the 3' end of the spacer adjacent to the PAM; mismatches in this seed region strongly reduce binding and cleavage, whereas mismatches far from the PAM (at the 5' end of the spacer) are more readily tolerated.\n\nIdentify the potential off-target site in Gene Y: The non-target strand given is 5'-...AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACCTGG...-3'. The substring 5'-TGG-3' is a valid PAM (NGG), so the sequence immediately upstream, 5'-AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC-3', is the protospacer on the non-target strand. Thus, a gRNA spacer that closely matches this protospacer, especially in its 3' seed region, poses a higher off-target risk.\n\nCompare gRNA Spacer A to the Gene Y protospacer. Write both 5' to 3':\nGene Y protospacer: AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC\ngRNA Spacer A:      AGAGATTGCTCGGACATGCACC\nAligning position by position from the 5' end, the two sequences have a single mismatch at position 11 (Gene Y has A, Spacer A has C). This mismatch is located outside the critical seed region (the ~8-10 nt at the 3' end adjacent to the PAM). Consequently, Spacer A exhibits perfect identity across the seed region and only one distal mismatch, a pattern known to be compatible with efficient off-target binding and cleavage.\n\nCompare gRNA Spacer B to the Gene Y protospacer:\nGene Y protospacer: AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC\ngRNA Spacer B:      TACCATTGCTAGGACAGGGGCC\nPosition-by-position comparison shows multiple mismatches, including at the 5' (distal) end and, critically, several mismatches within the seed region near the PAM. These multiple mismatches, especially those in the seed region, are expected to strongly reduce or abolish off-target binding and cleavage at this Gene Y site.\n\nGiven that the Gene Y site presents a valid PAM and that off-target lethality would occur if cleavage happens there, the poorer design is the gRNA whose spacer most closely matches the Gene Y protospacer in the seed region. Spacer A, with perfect seed complementarity and only a single non-seed mismatch, represents a substantially higher off-target risk than Spacer B, which carries multiple seed mismatches. Therefore, the poorer design choice is gRNA Spacer A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1480232"}, {"introduction": "After performing a gene editing experiment, researchers must analyze the results to determine its success. This final practice simulates this critical step by asking you to interpret the output from a common type of sequencing analysis used to assess CRISPR-mediated knockouts [@problem_id:1480229]. By analyzing metrics such as editing efficiency and the diversity of mutations, you will learn to recognize the expected molecular signature of successful gene disruption via the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair pathway.", "problem": "A molecular genetics researcher is attempting to create a knockout of the *mNeonGreen* gene in a human cell line using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The goal is to disrupt the fluorescent signal produced by the mNeonGreen protein. The strategy involves a single guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 nuclease to cut within the first exon of the *mNeonGreen* coding sequence.\n\nAfter transfection and cell culture, the researcher isolates genomic DNA from the edited cell population and performs Sanger sequencing on the targeted region. The sequencing data is analyzed using a tool analogous to Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE), which compares the edited sequence traces to an unedited control. The analysis provides the following key results:\n\n1.  **Editing Efficiency:** 95% of the sequenced alleles show evidence of insertions or deletions (indels).\n2.  **Knockout-Score:** The software calculates a \"knockout-score\" of 88%. This score represents the proportion of alleles in the total population that are predicted to have a loss-of-function mutation.\n3.  **Indel Profile:** The analysis reveals a highly heterogeneous mixture of indel sequences. The most common specific indel is a 1-base pair insertion, but it is present in only 12% of the edited alleles. The remaining edited alleles consist of over 50 different unique indel sequences, with sizes ranging from 1 to 15 base pairs.\n\nFor context, the CRISPR-Cas9 system creates a double-strand break (DSB) at a specific DNA location. In the absence of a repair template, the cell's primary repair mechanism is Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), an error-prone process that often introduces small, random indels at the break site. An indel that is not a multiple of three base pairs within a protein-coding sequence typically causes a frameshift mutation, leading to a premature stop codon and a non-functional, truncated protein.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion about the experiment?\n\nA. The experiment was unsuccessful because the lack of a dominant indel sequence indicates the Cas9 nuclease is not working efficiently.\n\nB. The diversity of indels suggests that the gRNA has many off-target binding sites, leading to a misleadingly high knockout-score.\n\nC. The experiment successfully generated a high frequency of loss-of-function mutations. The heterogeneity of indel sequences is an expected consequence of the NHEJ repair mechanism, and the knockout-score correctly quantifies the proportion of alleles likely to contain frameshift or other disruptive mutations.\n\nD. The experiment failed to produce a reliable knockout because only 12% of the cells share the same mutation, making the resulting cell population unsuitable for further experiments.\n\nE. The 7% difference between the editing efficiency (95%) and the knockout-score (88%) represents cells where the Cas9 enzyme cut the DNA, but the NHEJ process perfectly repaired the break back to the original wild-type sequence.", "solution": "Let the total allele population be normalized to 1. Define the following from the analysis:\n- Editing efficiency: a fraction of alleles with indels, denoted by $p_{\\text{edit}}=0.95$.\n- Knockout-score: a fraction of alleles predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF), denoted by $p_{\\text{KO}}=0.88$.\n\nFirst, relate the LOF fraction among edited alleles. The conditional probability that an edited allele is LOF is\n$$\nP(\\text{LOF} \\mid \\text{edited})=\\frac{p_{\\text{KO}}}{p_{\\text{edit}}}=\\frac{0.88}{0.95}=\\frac{88}{95}.\n$$\nThis shows that the vast majority of edits are predicted LOF. This is consistent with the known principle that in the absence of a repair template, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) yields a distribution of indel sizes in a coding sequence in which indels not divisible by $3$ produce frameshifts, leading to premature stop codons and non-functional proteins. Although a purely random distribution of indel sizes would suggest an approximate frameshift probability near $\\frac{2}{3}$, the observed $\\frac{88}{95}$ can be higher because many in-frame edits near the start codon can still disrupt protein function (e.g., by deleting essential residues or altering the reading context), and because predictive algorithms may classify certain in-frame events as disruptive.\n\nSecond, analyze the heterogeneity of indels. The data report a highly heterogeneous mixture with the most common specific indel being a $1$-base insertion present in only $0.12$ of edited alleles. The fraction of the total population carrying this specific indel is\n$$\np_{\\text{common}}=p_{\\text{edit}}\\times 0.12=0.95\\times 0.12=0.114.\n$$\nTherefore, only $0.114$ of all alleles share the most common indel. This heterogeneity is an expected hallmark of NHEJ, which introduces a spectrum of small insertions and deletions at the double-strand break site, rather than a single uniform mutation. Thus, the lack of a dominant indel does not imply inefficiency of Cas9; rather, the high $p_{\\text{edit}}$ shows efficient cutting and mutagenic repair.\n\nThird, interpret the difference between editing efficiency and knockout-score. The difference\n$$\np_{\\text{edit}}-p_{\\text{KO}}=0.95-0.88=0.07\n$$\nrepresents the fraction of total alleles that are edited but not predicted to be LOF (for example, in-frame indels that preserve function or other edits predicted to be non-disruptive). The fraction of edited alleles that are non-LOF is\n$$\n\\frac{p_{\\text{edit}}-p_{\\text{KO}}}{p_{\\text{edit}}}=\\frac{0.07}{0.95}=\\frac{7}{95}.\n$$\nThis difference does not indicate perfect repair back to wild type; perfect repair would yield no indel and would fall into the unedited category, which is $1-p_{\\text{edit}}=0.05$.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles:\n- Option A is incorrect because high $p_{\\text{edit}}=0.95$ indicates efficient Cas9 activity, and indel heterogeneity is expected under NHEJ.\n- Option B is incorrect because heterogeneity at the on-target site reflects NHEJ outcomes, not off-target activity; moreover, on-target trace decomposition does not report off-target sites.\n- Option C is correct: the experiment generated a high frequency of LOF mutations ($p_{\\text{KO}}=0.88$), heterogeneity is expected from NHEJ, and the knockout-score appropriately quantifies the predicted LOF fraction.\n- Option D is incorrect because a pooled knockout does not require a single shared mutation; diverse frameshift/disruptive alleles suffice for loss of function.\n- Option E is incorrect because the $0.07$ difference corresponds to edited but non-LOF alleles, not perfect repair, which would be categorized as unedited.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1480229"}]}
