This changes a $G \\cdot C$ base pair in a healthy individual to an $A \\cdot T$ base pair in an affected individual. A research team aims to develop a gene therapy to correct this mutation using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based base editing.\n\nThey have two types of base editors available:\n1.  **Adenine Base Editor (ABE):** A fusion protein containing a Cas9-nickase and an adenine deaminase enzyme. This editor targets a specific adenine (A) within a DNA double helix and chemically converts it to inosine (I). The cellular DNA replication and repair machinery then recognizes inosine as guanine (G). The net effect is the conversion of an $A \\cdot T$ base pair to a $G \\cdot C$ base pair.\n2.  **Cytosine Base Editor (CBE):** A fusion protein containing a Cas9-nickase and a cytosine deaminase enzyme.

An ABE should be used because it will target the adenine on the mutated coding strand, converting it to an inosine, which ultimately results in a $G \\cdot C$ pair after DNA repair.\n\nB.

A CBE should be used because it can reverse its normal function to convert the adenine on the coding strand back to a guanine.\n\nE. Either editor can be used, as both are capable of correcting any single base pair mutation.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the correct strategy for correcting a pathogenic G-to-A mutation using either an Adenine Base Editor (ABE) or a Cytosine Base Editor (CBE).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the state of the DNA at the mutation site.\nIn a healthy individual, the base pair is $G \\cdot C$. Let's denote the coding strand as the top strand and the template (non-coding) strand as the bottom strand.\nHealthy DNA:\n5' ... G ... 3' (Coding strand)\n3' ... C ... 5' (Template strand)\n\nThe pathogenic mutation is a \"G-to-A\" transition on the coding strand. This means the G on the coding strand is replaced by an A. Consequently, during DNA replication, the complementary C on the template strand will be replaced by a T.\nMutated DNA:\n5' ... A ... 3' (Coding strand)\n3' ... T ... 5' (Template strand)\n\nThe goal of the therapy is to reverse this mutation, i.e., to convert the $A \\cdot T$ base pair back to the original $G \\cdot C$ base pair.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two available tools based on their defined functions.\n\n**Evaluation of the Cytosine Base Editor (CBE):**\nThe problem states that a CBE converts a $C \\cdot G$ base pair into a $T \\cdot A$ base pair. It does this by targeting a cytosine (C) and converting it to uracil (U), which is then treated as thymine (T). To correct the mutated $A \\cdot T$ pair, we need to convert it to a $G \\cdot C$ pair. The CBE's function is the opposite of what is required; it creates $T \\cdot A$ pairs, it does not correct them. Furthermore, at the site of the mutation (an $A \\cdot T$ pair), there is no cytosine (C) for the CBE to target. Therefore, a CBE is not the appropriate tool for this correction.\n\n**Evaluation of the Adenine Base Editor (ABE):**\nThe problem states that an ABE converts an $A \\cdot T$ base pair into a $G \\cdot C$ base pair. It achieves this by targeting an adenine (A) and converting it to inosine (I). The cell's machinery reads 'I' as guanine (G).\nLet's apply this to the mutated DNA:\nMutated DNA:\n5' ... A ... 3' (Coding strand)\n3' ... T ... 5' (Template strand)\n\nAn ABE can be designed with a guide RNA that directs it to the mutated 'A' on the coding strand. The ABE's deaminase enzyme will then act on this adenine, converting it to inosine (I).\nIntermediate state:\n5' ... I ... 3'\n3' ... T ... 5'\n\nThe cellular repair machinery recognizes the $I-T$ mismatch. It identifies 'I' as a 'G' and \"corrects\" the 'T' on the complementary strand to a 'C'.\nFinal corrected DNA:\n5' ... G ... 3' (Coding strand)\n3' ... C ... 5' (Template strand)\n\nThis perfectly restores the original, healthy $G \\cdot C$ base pair. Thus, the ABE is the correct tool for the job.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\nA. **An ABE should be used because it will target the adenine on the mutated coding strand, converting it to an inosine, which ultimately results in a $G \\cdot C$ pair after DNA repair.** This statement accurately describes the mechanism and outcome of using an ABE to correct the specified mutation.\n\nB. **A CBE should be used because it will target the thymine on the template strand, converting it to a cytosine, which restores the original $G \\cdot C$ pair.** This is incorrect. CBEs target cytosine, not thymine.\n\nC. **An ABE should be used because it will target the thymine on the template strand and convert it to a guanine, which will then pair with cytosine.** This is incorrect. ABEs target adenine, not thymine.\n\nD. **A CBE should be used because it can reverse its normal function to convert the adenine on the coding strand back to a guanine.** This is incorrect. Base editors have specific enzymatic functions and cannot simply reverse them. A CBE specifically deaminates cytosine.\n\nE. **Either editor can be used, as both are capable of correcting any single base pair mutation.** This is incorrect. Base editors are highly specific. ABEs mediate $A \\cdot T$ to $G \\cdot C$ conversions, while CBEs mediate $C \\cdot G$ to $T \\cdot A$ conversions. They are not interchangeable.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement A provides the only correct rationale.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1480032"}, {"introduction": "Gene editing is a science of precision, but the tools have their own rules and limitations. This practice problem [@problem_id:1480067] explores two such critical constraints: the \"editing window\" and \"bystander editing.\" Understanding these concepts is essential for designing effective guide RNAs and anticipating potential unintended consequences of an experiment.", "problem": "Cytosine Base Editors (CBEs) are precision gene-editing tools derived from the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. A typical CBE consists of a Cas9 nickase (nCas9), which is engineered to cut only one strand of the DNA, fused to a cytosine deaminase enzyme. A guide RNA (gRNA) directs this fusion protein to a specific locus in the genome. Upon binding and unwinding of the DNA, the deaminase can chemically convert a cytosine (C) to a uracil (U) within a small, single-stranded DNA region. The cell's repair mechanisms then predominantly interpret this U as a thymine (T), resulting in a permanent $C-G$ to $T-A$ base pair change.\n\nA critical feature of CBEs is that the deaminase's activity is spatially limited to a specific \"editing window.\" For the particular CBE system being used in an experiment, this window includes positions 4 through 8 of the 20-nucleotide protospacer sequence. The positions are numbered 1 to 20, starting from the end most distant from the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nA researcher aims to introduce a specific $C$-to-$T$ mutation at position 13 of a target gene to model a disease. They design a gRNA that binds to a protospacer sequence containing their target cytosine at position 13. The sequence also happens to contain another cytosine at position 6. Assume the gRNA perfectly matches the protospacer and the necessary PAM site is correctly located.\n\nGiven this setup, what is the most likely outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. The experiment will be successful, and a $C$-to-$T$ mutation will be introduced at position 13.\n\nB. The CBE complex will fail to bind to the target DNA, and no editing will occur.\n\nC. The cytosine at position 13 will be unchanged, but an unintended $C$-to-$T$ \"bystander\" mutation will be introduced at position 6.\n\nD. The system will cause a double-strand break at the target site, leading to random insertions or deletions (indels).", "solution": "- The stated CBE has an editing window limited to positions 4 through 8 of the 20-nucleotide protospacer, numbered from the end most distant from the PAM (position 1) toward the PAM-proximal end (position 20).\n- The designed gRNA perfectly matches the protospacer, and the PAM is correctly positioned; therefore, the CBE complex will bind the target DNA and unwind it at the protospacer site as intended.\n- The cytosine deaminase fused to nCas9 acts only within the accessible single-stranded region corresponding to the defined editing window. Thus, only cytosines located at positions 4 through 8 are susceptible to deamination under this CBE configuration.\n- The researcher’s intended target cytosine is at position 13, which lies outside the 4–8 editing window. Therefore, the deaminase cannot efficiently deaminate the cytosine at position 13, so the desired $C$-to-$T$ conversion at position 13 is unlikely to occur.\n- The protospacer also contains a cytosine at position 6, which lies within the 4–8 editing window. This cytosine is therefore susceptible to deamination to uracil. Cellular repair processes will predominantly interpret U as T during replication/repair, yielding a permanent $C-G$ to $T-A$ change at position 6.\n- nCas9 introduces only a single-strand nick, not a double-strand break; thus, random indels from a double-strand break are not the expected outcome in this setup.\n- Evaluating choices:\n  - A is unlikely because position 13 is outside the editing window.\n  - B is incorrect because binding occurs with a perfect gRNA and correct PAM.\n  - C matches the expected bystander editing at position 6, with position 13 unchanged.\n  - D is incorrect because nCas9 does not produce a double-strand break in this system.\n- Therefore, the most likely outcome is an unintended $C$-to-$T$ “bystander” edit at position 6, with no edit at position 13.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1480067"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply changing a base, a key goal of gene therapy is to achieve a therapeutic effect at the cellular population level.
