{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A successful scientific experiment is built upon a foundation of well-designed controls. In RNA interference studies, it is crucial to demonstrate that an observed phenotype is a direct result of silencing your target gene, and not an unintended artifact of the technique itself. This first practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist by designing a critical negative control to distinguish specific gene knockdown effects from a general stress response, a common concern when introducing foreign RNA into cells [@problem_id:1518876].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the function of a newly discovered gene in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, which they have named `cruci-wing` (`crw`). They hypothesize that the `crw` gene is essential for the proper formation of wings during metamorphosis. To test this hypothesis, they plan to use RNA interference (RNAi), a technique that can silence the expression of a target gene.\n\nThe experimental plan involves synthesizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with a sequence complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of the `crw` gene. This `crw`-dsRNA will be injected into early-stage fly embryos. The development of these embryos will be monitored, and the wings of the resulting adult flies will be examined for defects.\n\nThe researcher is aware that the act of injecting a foreign substance, particularly a long dsRNA molecule, can trigger a generic cellular stress response in the embryo. This stress response could, in itself, cause developmental abnormalities, including wing malformations, independent of the silencing of the `crw` gene. Such an effect would act as a confounding variable, making it impossible to conclude that any observed wing defects are specifically due to the loss of `crw` function.\n\nWhich of the following experimental procedures would serve as the most appropriate negative control to specifically address the concern that the observed phenotype might be a result of a non-specific stress response to the dsRNA molecule itself?\n\nA. Injecting a separate group of embryos with a dsRNA molecule of similar length and concentration to the `crw`-dsRNA, but with a sequence that has no significant similarity to any known gene in the *Drosophila* genome.\n\nB. Injecting a separate group of embryos with the saline buffer solution that was used to dissolve the `crw`-dsRNA, but containing no dsRNA.\n\nC. Observing a separate group of wild-type embryos that receive no injection and are allowed to develop normally.\n\nD. Injecting a separate group of embryos with a dsRNA molecule designed to target a different, well-characterized *Drosophila* gene that is known to be required for eye development, not wing development.", "solution": "1. State the concern and what a proper negative control must address: The researcher is worried that long dsRNA itself (independent of its sequence) could trigger a generic stress response that leads to wing defects. Therefore, the negative control must replicate all aspects of the manipulation that could cause non-specific effects (injection, presence of long dsRNA, similar length and concentration), while removing the specific, sequence-dependent RNAi effect against the target gene.\n\n2. Define the specific variable to isolate: RNA interference is sequence-specific. The causal factor to be tested is whether sequence complementarity to the target mRNA (crw) is required for the phenotype. Non-specific stress due to dsRNA depends on the presence and physical properties of dsRNA, not its sequence complementarity.\n\n3. Evaluate each proposed control against these criteria:\n- Option A: A dsRNA of similar length and concentration, lacking significant homology to any known Drosophila gene, preserves injection and dsRNA-associated non-specific effects, but removes sequence-specific silencing. If wing defects still occur, they are attributable to dsRNA-induced stress; if not, defects in the experimental group are more likely due to crw knockdown. This directly addresses the stated concern.\n- Option B: Buffer-only controls for injection and vehicle but omits dsRNA. It does not test whether dsRNA itself elicits a stress response, so it is insufficient for the specific concern.\n- Option C: No-injection controls for baseline development only. It neither controls for injection nor for dsRNA-associated stress, thus it is inadequate for the stated concern.\n- Option D: A dsRNA targeting a different gene (eye development) introduces sequence-specific knockdown of another gene and could produce its own phenotypes. It cannot isolate non-specific dsRNA stress and is not a negative control for the concern at hand.\n\n4. Conclusion: The control that best and specifically tests for non-specific dsRNA-induced stress effects, while eliminating sequence-specific RNAi against crw, is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1518876"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable utility of RNAi as a research tool stems from its high degree of sequence specificity. The machinery of gene silencing is precisely guided to its target mRNA by a small RNA molecule. This exercise explores the consequences of disrupting this perfect molecular recognition, asking you to predict the outcome when a mutation appears in the target sequence [@problem_id:1518847]. Your reasoning will test your understanding of the fundamental pairing rules that govern RNAi efficacy.", "problem": "A molecular genetics lab is investigating the function of a newly discovered gene, `ChromaG`, in a line of insect cells. When expressed, the `ChromaG` gene produces a stable green fluorescent protein, causing the cells to glow green under ultraviolet light. To study the effects of losing this protein, the researchers decide to use RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the gene's expression.\n\nThey design a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a short double-stranded RNA molecule, that is perfectly complementary to a specific 21-nucleotide sequence within the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the `ChromaG` gene. When this siRNA is introduced into the insect cells, it successfully binds to and leads to the degradation of the `ChromaG` mRNA, resulting in a near-complete loss of green fluorescence.\n\nLater, the lab receives a second culture of the same insect cell line which, due to a spontaneous mutation, now carries a variant allele of the `ChromaG` gene. This variant contains a single-nucleotide substitution (a point mutation) located in the central part of the 21-nucleotide sequence targeted by the original siRNA. The mutation does not alter the reading frame or create a stop codon, so the cells still produce a functional and stable green fluorescent protein.\n\nThe researchers repeat the experiment by introducing the same, original siRNA into this new, mutated cell line. What is the most probable outcome for the green fluorescence in these mutated cells?\n\nA. The green fluorescence will be silenced, but to a lesser degree than in the original, non-mutated cells.\n\nB. The green fluorescence will be completely unaffected, and the cells will fluoresce with the same intensity as mutated cells that were not treated with siRNA.\n\nC. The green fluorescence will be silenced even more efficiently than in the original cells due to enhanced binding.\n\nD. The cells will produce a non-fluorescent, truncated version of the ChromaG protein.\n\nE. The siRNA will now target and degrade the cell's ribosomal RNA, leading to cell death.", "solution": "1) RNA interference with siRNA proceeds via loading of one strand (the guide) into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing a slicer Argonaute. Target mRNA degradation (slicing) requires near-perfect complementarity between the guide and the target, especially in the central region of the guide-mRNA duplex. Argonaute-catalyzed cleavage occurs between positions 10 and 11 from the guide strand 5' end and is exquisitely sensitive to mismatches in this central region.\n\n2) In the original cells, the siRNA is perfectly complementary to a 21-nucleotide segment of the ChromaG mRNA, enabling stable duplex formation and precise slicing at the central site, which leads to mRNA degradation and loss of green fluorescence.\n\n3) In the mutated cells, a single-nucleotide substitution lies in the central part of the siRNA target site. This introduces a mismatch at or near the cleavage site, which is known to abolish or drastically reduce Argonaute slicing. Without efficient slicing, the targeted mRNA is not degraded. While imperfect pairing can sometimes lead to mild translational repression (miRNA-like), siRNA-directed silencing in insects relies on central complementarity for cleavage; a central mismatch typically prevents effective knockdown.\n\n4) Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the original siRNA fails to silence ChromaG in the mutant cells, and green fluorescence remains at the level seen in untreated mutant cells.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Less silencing is unlikely when the mismatch is central; slicing is largely abolished rather than merely reduced.\n- B: Consistent with loss of slicing due to a central mismatch; fluorescence remains unaffected.\n- C: Enhanced binding is contradicted by the introduced mismatch.\n- D: RNAi does not cause truncation of the coding sequence; it degrades mRNA.\n- E: Off-target cleavage of ribosomal RNA by this siRNA is not expected.\n\nHence, the best choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1518847"}, {"introduction": "After meticulously designing and executing an RNAi experiment, the final step is to quantify its success by measuring the amount of remaining target mRNA.
