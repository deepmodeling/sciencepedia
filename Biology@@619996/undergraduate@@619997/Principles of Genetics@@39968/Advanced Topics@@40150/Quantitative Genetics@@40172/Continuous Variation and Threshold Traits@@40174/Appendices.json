{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the genetic basis of continuous traits, like height or weight, begins with separating the influences of 'nature' (genetics) and 'nurture' (environment). A classic experimental approach involves comparing populations with different levels of genetic variation. This practice will guide you through a common scenario where phenotypic variance is measured in a genetically uniform F1 generation and a segregating F2 generation, allowing us to isolate the genetic component of variation and calculate the broad-sense heritability ($H^2$) [@problem_id:1479738].", "problem": "A team of agronomists is studying the genetic basis of plant height, a quantitative trait, in a specific cultivar of commercial maize (Zea mays). Their experiment begins with two true-breeding parental lines that differ significantly in height; one line is consistently short, and the other is consistently tall. They cross these two parental lines to produce a genetically uniform F1 generation. Subsequently, they allow the F1 plants to self-pollinate, which results in a genetically segregating F2 generation. Both the F1 and F2 populations are cultivated in a single, homogeneous field to ensure that all plants experience nearly identical environmental conditions.\n\nAfter the plants reach maturity, the final height of a large and representative sample from each population is measured. From these measurements, the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for plant height is calculated for each generation. The phenotypic variance for the genetically uniform F1 generation is found to be $8.50 \\text{ cm}^2$. The phenotypic variance for the genetically variable F2 generation is $42.5 \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nUsing this data, calculate the broad-sense heritability ($H^2$) of plant height for this maize population.
