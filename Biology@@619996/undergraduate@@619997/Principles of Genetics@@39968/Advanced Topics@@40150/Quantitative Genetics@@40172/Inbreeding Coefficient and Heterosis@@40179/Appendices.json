They are concerned about the effects of inbreeding on the genetic diversity of this endangered species. Their research focuses on a specific gene locus that influences immune response. This locus has two alleles, a dominant allele `R` and a recessive allele `r`.\n\nFrom extensive genetic sampling, the biologists have determined that the frequency of the dominant allele `R` is $p = 0.80$ and the frequency of the recessive allele `r` is $q = 0.20$. Due to the population's isolation, a significant level of inbreeding occurs. The average inbreeding coefficient ($F$) for this population has been estimated to be $0.25$.\n\nCalculate the expected frequency of heterozygous individuals (`Rr`) in this population, taking into account the effects of inbreeding.

Let allele frequencies be $p$ for $R$ and $q$ for $r$, with $p+q=1$, and let the inbreeding coefficient be $F$.\n\nUnder random mating (Hardy–Weinberg), the heterozygote frequency is $2pq$. Inbreeding reduces heterozygosity by a factor of $(1-F)$, yielding the standard result\n$$\nP(Rr)=2pq(1-F).\n$$\nThis follows from the partition of genotypes into those formed by alleles identical by descent (with probability $F$, which cannot form heterozygotes) and those formed by independent sampling (with probability $1-F$), which follows Hardy–Weinberg proportions.\n\nSubstitute the given values $p=0.80$, $q=0.20$, and $F=0.25$:\n$$\nP(Rr)=2(0.80)(0.20)\\bigl(1-0.25\\bigr)=0.32\\times 0.75=0.24.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.240$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.240}$$", "id": "1498636"}, {"introduction": "Now that we understand the consequences of inbreeding, it's essential to master the skill of calculating the inbreeding coefficient, $F$, from a family tree. This exercise [@problem_id:1498662] moves beyond simple cases and challenges you with a 'double first cousin' pedigree, a classic scenario in human and animal genetics. By systematically applying the path-counting method, you will learn to trace gene flow through multiple common ancestors to determine the precise level of inbreeding for an individual.", "problem": "In a small, isolated community, there is a traditional marriage pattern involving two families, Family A and Family B, that are initially unrelated.

The second couple produces a child, named Child 2. These two children, who are known as double first cousins, later marry and have a child of their own, designated as Individual X.\n\nYou are given that the four founding grandparents (the parents of the siblings in Family A and the parents of the siblings in Family B) are all non-inbred and entirely unrelated to one another.\n\nYour task is to determine the probability that for any single genetic locus, the two alleles present in Individual X are identical by descent.
