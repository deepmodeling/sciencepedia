By calculating broad-sense heritability ($H^2$), you will quantify the overall genetic contribution to a trait, a crucial first step in assessing a population's potential for breeding or adaptation.", "problem": "An agricultural research team is studying a newly developed strain of a biofuel crop, *Helianthus oleum*, to assess the genetic potential for improving its seed oil content. The team measures the oil content (in milligrams per gram of seed weight) across a large, genetically diverse population of plants grown in a standard field environment. They quantify the total observed variation, known as the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$), and find it to be $42.5 \\, (\\text{mg/g})^2$.\n\nTo isolate the effect of environmental factors, the researchers then grow a set of genetically identical plants (clones) in the same field conditions. Since all individuals in this second group are genetically uniform, any variation in their oil content is attributable solely to micro-environmental differences. This environmental variance ($V_E$) is measured to be $15.3 \\, (\\text{mg/g})^2$.\n\nAssuming that the total phenotypic variance is the sum of genetic and environmental variance, calculate the proportion of the total phenotypic variance in the original, diverse population that can be attributed to genetic differences among the plants.
