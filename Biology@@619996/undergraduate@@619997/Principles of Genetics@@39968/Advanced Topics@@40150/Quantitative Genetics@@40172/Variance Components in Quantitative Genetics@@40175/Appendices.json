The equation relating them is:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E + V_{G \\times E}$$\nThe problem states that we can assume the genotype-by-environment interaction ($V_{G \\times E}$) is zero. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E$$\n\nFirst, we analyze the data from the controlled greenhouse environment.

For a genetically uniform population, there is no genetic variation among individuals, so the genetic variance ($V_G$) is zero by definition.
