A significant challenge is contamination from modern DNA, for instance, from archaeologists or lab technicians. One method to estimate this contamination involves sequencing the DNA from a skeleton that has been morphologically identified as female. The presence of DNA sequences mapping to the Y-chromosome is a direct indicator of male DNA contamination.\n\nAn ancient human skeleton, determined to be female through osteological analysis, is subjected to shotgun DNA sequencing. The resulting sequence reads are aligned to the human reference genome. The analysis yields a total of $N_{auto} = 5,800,000$ reads uniquely aligning to the autosomal chromosomes (chromosomes 1-22). A smaller number of reads, $N_Y = 1,425$, are found to uniquely align to the Y chromosome.\n\nAssume for this analysis that the effective haploid length of the autosomal genome is $L_{auto} = 2.90 \\times 10^9$ base pairs and the effective length of the Y chromosome is $L_Y = 5.70 \\times 10^7$ base pairs. Also, assume that sequencing coverage is uniform across the genome and the contaminant is a single modern male.\n\nBased on these data, calculate the minimum level of modern male DNA contamination.
