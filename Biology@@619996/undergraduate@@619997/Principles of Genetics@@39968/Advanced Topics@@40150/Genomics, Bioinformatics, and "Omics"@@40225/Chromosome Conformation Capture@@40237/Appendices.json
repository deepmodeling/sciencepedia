One of the most significant discoveries enabled by Hi-C is the existence of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which appear as distinct square-like regions of high interaction frequency along the map's diagonal. This exercise challenges you to think like a molecular biologist by exploring the biological basis of these structures. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the key architectural protein CTCF is absent, you can deduce the protein's critical role as an insulator that defines TAD boundaries and organizes the genome's local folding patterns [@problem_id:1476537].", "problem": "In the field of genomics, the three-dimensional organization of the genome is studied using techniques like Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C). A Hi-C experiment produces a 2D heatmap where the intensity of a signal at any point represents the frequency of physical interaction between two corresponding segments of a chromosome. A key feature observed on these maps are Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which are genomic regions where the DNA interacts much more frequently with itself than with sequences outside the region. On a Hi-C map, TADs appear as distinct, high-interaction squares along the diagonal of the map.\n\nThe formation and maintenance of TAD boundaries are critically dependent on architectural proteins. One of the most important of these is CTCF, a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences and is known to be highly enriched at TAD boundaries, acting as an insulator.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a cell line is engineered to have a complete knockout of the gene that codes for the CTCF protein. A Hi-C experiment is then performed on these CTCF-null cells. Compared to the Hi-C map of normal, wild-type cells, which of the following outcomes would be the most likely observation for the map from the CTCF-null cells?\n\nA. The square patterns representing TADs would become more sharply defined and smaller, indicating a finer-grained and more rigid compartmentalization of the genome.\n\nB. The Hi-C map would be largely indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells, suggesting that other proteins can fully compensate for the absence of CTCF.\n\nC. The square patterns corresponding to TADs would largely disappear. This would be observed as a loss of the distinct boundaries between TADs, leading to increased interaction frequencies between regions that were previously in separate, adjacent domains.\n\nD. The Hi-C map would show a complete reversal, where interactions within the former TAD regions are eliminated, and only strong, long-range interactions between distant parts of the chromosome are established.", "solution": "TADs are genomic regions with elevated self-interactions that appear as squares along the diagonal of a Hi-C map. Their boundaries are strongly enriched for CTCF binding sites, and the predominant mechanistic model posits that cohesin extrudes chromatin loops until halted by CTCF bound at convergently oriented motifs, thereby sharpening and maintaining TAD boundaries and specific loops.\n\nIn the absence of CTCF, loop extrusion is no longer anchored at defined boundary sites. Consequently, the insulation at TAD boundaries is lost or markedly weakened. Polymer-physics constraints still favor local contacts, so short-range interactions do not vanish, and A/B compartmentalization generally persists or may even strengthen, but the hallmark squares of TADs become blurred as interactions spread across former boundaries. This leads to increased interaction frequencies between regions that were previously separated by TAD boundaries.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: boundaries do not become sharper or smaller; they weaken.\n- B is incorrect: while some organization persists (e.g., compartments), TAD boundaries and CTCF-anchored loops are not preserved, so the map is not indistinguishable.\n- C is correct: TAD squares largely disappear due to loss of distinct boundaries, with more cross-boundary interactions.\n- D is incorrect: local interactions are not eliminated; the map does not invert to only long-range contacts.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is the loss of distinct TAD boundaries with increased interdomain interactions, as described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1476537"}, {"introduction": "Building on the knowledge that proteins like CTCF shape genome architecture, we can use formal models to make precise, quantitative predictions. The \"loop extrusion\" model provides a powerful framework for explaining how TADs are formed, proposing that cohesin complexes actively extrude chromatin loops until they are halted by CTCF proteins in specific orientations. This advanced problem asks you to apply the rules of this model to a hypothetical genomic region, calculating how a targeted mutation—the inversion of a single CTCF binding site—alters the TAD landscape and changes the interaction frequency between two specific points. This practice sharpens your problem-solving skills and illustrates how theoretical models are used to understand the dynamic mechanisms of gene regulation [@problem_id:1476487].", "problem": "The spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome is crucial for gene regulation. Techniques like High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C) have revealed that chromosomes are partitioned into self-interacting genomic regions known as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). The formation of these domains is largely explained by the loop extrusion model.\n\nConsider a simplified loop extrusion model with the following principles:\n1.  Cohesin complexes act as molecular motors that bidirectionally extrude loops of chromatin.\n2.  The genome is interspersed with binding sites for the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Each CTCF site has a specific orientation, either \"Forward\" (F) or \"Reverse\" (R).\n3.  Loop extrusion is halted when a cohesin motor encounters a CTCF-bound site in a convergent orientation. Specifically, a rightward-moving motor is blocked by an R-oriented site, and a leftward-moving motor is blocked by an F-oriented site.\n4.  A stable TAD is formed by a loop anchored by a pair of convergently-oriented CTCF sites (an F site followed by an R site somewhere downstream). Non-convergent pairs (e.g., F...F, R...R, or R...F) do not form stable TAD boundaries.\n\nNow, consider a 650 kilobase (kb) region of a wild-type chromosome with the following CTCF binding sites, specified by their position and orientation:\n- Site A: 50 kb, Forward (F)\n- Site B: 200 kb, Reverse (R)\n- Site C: 250 kb, Forward (F)\n- Site D: 450 kb, Reverse (R)\n- Site E: 500 kb, Forward (F)\n- Site F: 600 kb, Reverse (R)\n\nFor a simplified analysis, assume that the long-range interaction frequency between any two genomic loci, as would be measured by Hi-C, depends on the TAD architecture. The interaction frequency for two loci within the same TAD is a constant value $F$. The interaction frequency for loci in adjacent TADs is $I_{adj} = F/4$. The interaction frequency for loci in non-adjacent TADs (i.e., separated by at least one intervening TAD) is $I_{non-adj} = F/16$.\n\nA specific mutation occurs that precisely inverts the DNA sequence of the CTCF binding site C, changing its orientation from Forward (F) to Reverse (R), while leaving all other sites unchanged.\n\nLet $I_{WT}$ be the interaction frequency between a locus at position P=100 kb and a locus at position Q=550 kb in the wild-type genome.
