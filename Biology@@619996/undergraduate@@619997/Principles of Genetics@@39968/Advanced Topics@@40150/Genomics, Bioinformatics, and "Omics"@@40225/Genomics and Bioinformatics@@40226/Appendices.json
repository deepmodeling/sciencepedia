Understanding how the two strands of the double helix relate to each other is a non-negotiable first step. This exercise [@problem_id:1494888] focuses on the fundamental concept of the reverse complement, which arises from the antiparallel orientation of the DNA strands and the strict base-pairing rules ($A$ with $T$, and $G$ with $C$). Mastering this simple operation is crucial for countless applications, from designing primers for PCR to interpreting the output of DNA sequencing machines.", "problem": "In molecular biology, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a fundamental technique used to amplify a specific segment of a DNA molecule. The process relies on a pair of short, single-stranded DNA sequences known as primers. These primers are designed to be complementary to the start and end of the target DNA region, allowing DNA polymerase to initiate synthesis.\n\nA crucial aspect of primer design is understanding the structure of DNA. A DNA strand has a direction, indicated by its 5' (five-prime) and 3' (three-prime) ends. Two complementary strands in a DNA double helix are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. The base pairing rules dictate that Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C).\n\nFor PCR, a \"reverse\" primer must bind to one of the template strands. To do so, its sequence must be the reverse complement of its target site on that strand.\n\nSuppose a target region on a single DNA strand has the following sequence, read from 5' to 3':\n$$5'\\text{-AGCTTCG-3'}$$\nDetermine the sequence of the corresponding reverse primer that would bind to this site. Provide the primer sequence written in the standard 5' to 3' direction.", "solution": "Principles:\n- DNA strands are antiparallel: one runs 5' to 3', the complementary strand runs 3' to 5'.\n- Base pairing rules: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.\n- A reverse primer must be the reverse complement of the target site so that it can bind antiparallel to the template.\n\nGiven target site on one strand: $5'\\text{-AGCTTCG-}3'$.\nStep 1 (complement, preserving left-to-right order): A→T, G→C, C→G, T→A, T→A, C→G, G→C, yielding the complementary sequence written antiparallel as $3'\\text{-TCGAAGC-}5'$.\nStep 2 (reverse to write the primer 5' to 3'): reversing $3'\\text{-TCGAAGC-}5'$ gives $5'\\text{-CGAAGCT-}3'$.\n\nTherefore, the reverse primer sequence (written 5' to 3') is CGAAGCT.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CGAAGCT}$$", "id": "1494888"}, {"introduction": "From the single DNA molecule, we now scale up to an entire genome. Modern sequencing technologies do not read a chromosome from end to end; instead, they generate millions of short fragments that are later reassembled. This practice [@problem_id:1494867] introduces the critical concept of sequencing \"coverage\" or \"depth,\" a key metric that quantifies the redundancy and reliability of a sequencing experiment. By working through this calculation, you will gain a tangible sense of the immense scale of data involved in genomics and understand the direct relationship between genome size, desired coverage, and total sequencing output.", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is conducting a whole-genome sequencing project on a newly discovered species of archaea, *Methanopyrus kandleri 2.0*, which thrives near deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The primary goal is to assemble its complete circular chromosome to study its unique metabolic pathways. The estimated size of the genome for this organism is 2.1 Megabases (Mb). For the purpose of this calculation, you can assume that 1 Mb is exactly one million base pairs.\n\nTo achieve a high-quality genome assembly, the sequencing experiment was designed to generate a very high average sequencing depth, also known as coverage. The final dataset achieved an average coverage of 150X. Sequencing coverage (e.g., 150X) is defined as the average number of times each nucleotide in the genome is read during the sequencing process.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of nucleotide bases that were sequenced and generated by the sequencing machine in this experiment.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of nucleotide bases produced during a sequencing experiment. We are given the genome size and the average sequencing coverage.\n\nFirst, let's identify the given quantities.\nThe genome size, $G$, is 2.1 Megabases (Mb).\nThe average sequencing coverage, $C$, is 150X.\n\nThe term \"coverage\" in genomics refers to the average number of times a given nucleotide in the genome is sequenced. Therefore, to find the total number of bases sequenced, we need to multiply the size of the genome by the average coverage.\n\nThe formula is:\nTotal Bases Sequenced = Genome Size $\\times$ Coverage\n\nFirst, we must express the genome size in the fundamental unit of base pairs (bp), not Megabases (Mb). The problem states that 1 Mb = 1,000,000 bp.\nSo, we convert the genome size $G$ to base pairs:\n$G = 2.1 \\text{ Mb} \\times \\frac{1,000,000 \\text{ bp}}{1 \\text{ Mb}} = 2,100,000 \\text{ bp}$\n\nNow we can use the formula.

This task is profoundly complicated by the fact that genomes are filled with repetitive sequences. This \"thought experiment\" [@problem_id:1494878] challenges you to determine the minimum sequencing read length required to resolve an array of identical repeats. This exercise develops crucial problem-solving skills and provides a clear, intuitive understanding of why the development of long-read sequencing technologies has been a game-changer for bioinformatics and our ability to construct complete, accurate genomes.", "problem": "A bioinformatician is studying genome assembly challenges using a simplified model chromosome. The model consists of a 5.0 kilobase (kb) unique sequence `U_A`, followed by three identical tandem copies of a 4.0 kb Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) element, and finally a 5.0 kb unique sequence `U_B`. The sequences `U_A`, `U_B`, and the LTR sequence are all distinct from one another.\n\nFor an assembler to correctly determine the copy number and arrangement of the repeats, it must be able to distinguish the junction between the first and second LTR copy from the junction between the second and third LTR copy. This requires sequencing reads that can be uniquely assigned to one junction but not the other. A read is considered uniquely assignable to a specific location if its sequence does not occur anywhere else in the genome.\n\nAssuming reads can start at any base position in the genome, what is the absolute minimum length a single sequencing read must have to guarantee that it can uniquely resolve the junction between the first and second LTR copies? Express your answer in base pairs.", "solution": "Let the chromosome be $U_{A}$ (unique, length $5{,}000$ bp), followed by three identical tandem LTR copies each of length $R$ bp, and then $U_{B}$ (unique, length $5{,}000$ bp), with $R=4{,}000$ bp. We need the absolute minimum read length that guarantees a single read can uniquely resolve (i.e., be uniquely assignable to) the LTR1–LTR2 junction rather than the LTR2–LTR3 junction. A read is uniquely assignable if its sequence occurs only once in the genome.\n\nKey principle: Any read whose sequence consists solely of LTR sequence and spans only one LTR–LTR junction will occur identically at both LTR1–LTR2 and LTR2–LTR3, because the LTR copies are identical. Therefore, such reads are not unique. To be unique, a read spanning LTR1–LTR2 must either:\n- include flanking unique sequence ($U_{A}$ to the left or $U_{B}$ to the right), or\n- include both LTR–LTR junctions (which occurs only once in the array).\n\nCompute the minimal lengths for each strategy:\n1) Include $U_{A}$ and span LTR1–LTR2. The read must contain at least one base in $U_{A}$, all of LTR1 to reach the junction, and at least one base into LTR2 to cross the junction. Hence\n$$\nL_{\\text{left}}=1+R+1=R+2.\n$$\n2) Include $U_{B}$ and span LTR1–LTR2. The read must include at least one base in LTR1 (to be on the left of the LTR1–LTR2 junction), then all of LTR2 and LTR3 to reach $U_{B}$, and at least one base into $U_{B}$. Hence\n$$\nL_{\\text{right}}=1+R+R+1=2R+2.\n$$\n3) Span both LTR–LTR junctions (LTR1–LTR2 and LTR2–LTR3). The two junctions are separated by exactly one full LTR of length $R$. To include at least one base on each side of both junctions, the minimal length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{both}}=R+2.\n$$\n\nFor uniqueness and minimality we take the minimum of these options:\n$$\nL_{\\min}=\\min\\{L_{\\text{left}},L_{\\text{right}},L_{\\text{both}}\\}=\\min\\{R+2,2R+2,R+2\\}=R+2.\n$$\n\nSubstituting $R=4{,}000$ bp gives\n$$\nL_{\\min}=4{,}000+2=4{,}002\\ \\text{bp}.\n$$\n\nNo shorter read can be unique while spanning only one LTR–LTR junction, because any read of length $L\\leq R+1$ that crosses LTR1–LTR2 but does not include unique flanking sequence has an identical occurrence crossing LTR2–LTR3 (by identical tandem copies), violating uniqueness. Therefore, $4{,}002$ bp is the absolute minimum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4002}$$", "id": "1494878"}]}
