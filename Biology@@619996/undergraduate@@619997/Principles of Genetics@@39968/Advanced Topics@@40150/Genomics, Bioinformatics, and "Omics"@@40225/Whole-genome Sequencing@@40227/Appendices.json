K-mer analysis is a powerful, assembly-free technique that provides a rapid diagnostic profile of your dataset. This exercise challenges you to interpret a k-mer frequency histogram, a common output of this analysis, to diagnose a potential sample contamination issue—a crucial real-world skill for ensuring the integrity of downstream genomic analyses [@problem_id:1534597].", "problem": "A genomics researcher is conducting a Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) experiment on a liquid culture that is presumed to contain a pure strain of the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*. As a preliminary quality control step before genome assembly, the researcher performs a k-mer analysis on the raw sequencing reads. For this analysis, a k-mer length of 21 is used.\n\nThe analysis generates a frequency histogram where the x-axis represents the number of times a specific 21-mer sequence appears in the dataset (its frequency), and the y-axis represents the count of distinct 21-mers that have that frequency. The histogram reveals two clear, distinct, and approximately bell-shaped peaks. The first major peak is centered at a frequency of approximately 30, and a second, larger peak is centered at a frequency of approximately 90. A much smaller, sharp peak at a frequency of 1, corresponding to sequencing errors, is also present but can be disregarded for this analysis.\n\nAssuming the genomes of any bacteria present are of a similar size and complexity, which of the following statements provides the most plausible explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The *Vibrio cholerae* genome contains a large family of repetitive elements that are present, on average, in three copies throughout the genome.\n\nB. The culture is contaminated with a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria), and the abundance of phage particles is three times greater than the abundance of *Vibrio cholerae* cells.\n\nC.

The culture is contaminated with another bacterial species, and the abundance of the *Vibrio cholerae* is approximately one-third the abundance of the contaminant species.", "solution": "A k-mer histogram plots, for each k-mer, its count in the read dataset (x-axis) versus the number of distinct k-mers having that count (y-axis). For a single, non-redundant genome sequenced uniformly, the distribution of counts for unique k-mers is approximately bell-shaped around the mean coverage. If a k-mer appears in the genome with copy number $r$, its expected count is multiplied by $r$, producing a peak near $rC$, where $C$ is the mean coverage for unique sequence.\n\nFor a mixture of genomes, each genome $i$ contributes its own peak at a mean k-mer count $\\mu_{i}$ proportional to its sequencing coverage. Let $B$ be the total number of sequenced bases, $f_{i}$ the fraction of those bases originating from genome $i$, and $G_{i}$ the genome size. The mean depth (and hence the mean 21-mer count for unique k-mers) for genome $i$ is\n$$\n\\mu_{i} = \\frac{B f_{i}}{G_{i}}.\n$$\nTherefore, for two genomes $1$ and $2$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{2}}{\\mu_{1}} = \\frac{f_{2} G_{1}}{f_{1} G_{2}}.\n$$\nUnder the assumption in the problem that any bacterial genomes present are of similar size and complexity, we take $G_{1} \\approx G_{2}$, which yields\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{2}}{\\mu_{1}} \\approx \\frac{f_{2}}{f_{1}}.\n$$\nThe observed peaks at approximately $30$ and $90$ imply\n$$\n\\frac{90}{30} \\approx 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{f_{\\text{higher}}}{f_{\\text{lower}}} \\approx 3,\n$$\ni.e., one bacterial species is present at about three times the abundance of the other.\n\nMoreover, for each species, the area under its peak (the total number of distinct 21-mers contributed) scales with the genome size and complexity; with $G_{1} \\approx G_{2}$, the peak areas are similar. Because the variance of k-mer counts for a given mean $\\mu$ is approximately $\\mu$ (Poisson-like sampling), the distribution with larger $\\mu$ is narrower (standard deviation $\\sqrt{\\mu}$), so for similar area its peak appears taller. Thus the taller peak at $90$ corresponds to the more abundant species.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- A: Three-copy repeats would produce a secondary peak near $3C$ for the repeated k-mers, but the unique portion would still produce a major peak at $C$. For the $3C$ peak to be larger than the $C$ peak, the majority of distinct 21-mers would have to come from three-copy repeats, which is implausible for a typical bacterial genome and would also often produce additional peaks at other multiplicities. This is less plausible than a mixed-species explanation.\n\n- B: A bacteriophage has a much smaller genome and is not covered by the “similar size and complexity” assumption for bacteria. A threefold difference in particle abundance does not straightforwardly produce the observed two major bacterial-like peaks in the k-mer histogram; the phage would contribute far fewer distinct k-mers, making it unlikely to generate a major peak comparable to a bacterium.\n\n- C: Sequencing the forward and reverse strands at different depths would not produce two distinct k-mer coverage peaks because k-mer counting generally aggregates counts across strands (and often canonicalizes reverse complements). Strand-specific depth imbalance does not split the k-mer histogram into two separate peaks at different multiplicities.\n\n- D and E: A mixture of two bacterial species of similar genome size naturally yields two peaks at mean counts proportional to their relative abundances. The ratio $90/30 \\approx 3$ indicates a threefold abundance difference, and the taller peak at $90$ must be the more abundant species. In a culture intended to be a pure strain of Vibrio cholerae, the most plausible scenario is that Vibrio cholerae remains the majority and a contaminant is present at roughly one-third its abundance. This maps directly to statement D.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation consistent with the histogram, the abundance ratio implied by the peak positions, and the assumption of similar genome sizes is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1534597"}, {"introduction": "The process of genome assembly often produces a complex graph structure that holds clues about the underlying biology of the organism.
