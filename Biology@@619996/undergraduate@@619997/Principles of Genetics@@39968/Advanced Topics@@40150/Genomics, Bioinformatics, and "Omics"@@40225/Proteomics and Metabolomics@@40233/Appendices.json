By understanding how a metabolic block affects the concentration of compounds upstream and downstream of a non-functional enzyme, you will develop a core skill for interpreting metabolomic data and linking genotype to phenotype.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the biosynthesis of a red floral pigment in the fictional plant *Petalus extraordinarius*. The synthesis occurs via a linear metabolic pathway starting from a colorless precursor, which is always abundant. The pathway involves three intermediate compounds: Citronin (yellow), Aurantin (orange), and Rubidin (deep red-orange), before the final stable Red Pigment is produced. The enzymes catalyzing each conversion are named sequentially.\n\nThe pathway is as follows:\nColorless Precursor $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 1}}$ Citronin $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 2}}$ Aurantin $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 3}}$ Rubidin $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 4}}$ Final Red Pigment\n\nWild-type flowers are deep red. The geneticist isolates a mutant strain that produces pure white flowers. A metabolomics analysis is performed on the petal tissue of both the wild-type and the white-flowered mutant. The relative concentrations of the intermediates are recorded. The analysis reveals that in the white-flowered mutant, the concentration of Aurantin is exceptionally high, while the concentrations of Citronin, Rubidin, and the Final Red Pigment are all very low or undetectable.\n\nBased on this metabolomic profile, which enzyme is most likely non-functional due to a mutation in the white-flowered strain?\n\nA. Enzyme 1\n\nB. Enzyme 2\n\nC. Enzyme 3\n\nD. Enzyme 4\n\nE. All enzymes in the pathway are non-functional.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the defective enzyme in a linear metabolic pathway based on the accumulation and depletion of specific metabolites in a mutant organism.\n\nThe fundamental principle for analyzing such pathways is that a non-functional enzyme creates a \"metabolic block.\" This block has two main consequences:\n1.  The substrate of the defective enzyme cannot be converted into its product, causing the substrate to accumulate to a higher-than-normal concentration.\n2.  The product of the defective enzyme (and all subsequent compounds in the pathway) cannot be synthesized, leading to their depletion or absence.\n\nLet's analyze the given pathway:\nColorless Precursor $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 1}}$ Citronin $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 2}}$ Aurantin $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 3}}$ Rubidin $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 4}}$ Final Red Pigment\n\nThe experimental data for the white-flowered mutant are:\n-   Concentration of Citronin: Low\n-   Concentration of Aurantin: Exceptionally high\n-   Concentration of Rubidin: Very low\n-   Concentration of Final Red Pigment: Very low (consistent with the white flower phenotype)\n\nWe can now evaluate the state of the pathway step-by-step based on this data.\n-   The concentration of Aurantin is exceptionally high. According to our principle, this means Aurantin is the substrate that is accumulating because its corresponding enzyme is non-functional. The enzyme that uses Aurantin as a substrate is Enzyme 3.\n-   The concentrations of Rubidin and the Final Red Pigment are very low. Rubidin is the direct product of the reaction catalyzed by Enzyme 3. Its low concentration is consistent with Enzyme 3 being non-functional. Since Rubidin is not being produced, the subsequent Final Red Pigment also cannot be produced.\n-   The low concentration of Citronin indicates that the pathway leading *up to* the block is functioning. Enzyme 2 is converting Citronin into Aurantin. The reason Citronin is low is likely because it is being efficiently converted to Aurantin, which then cannot be processed further and accumulates.\n\nLet's consider the other possibilities to confirm our conclusion:\n-   If Enzyme 1 were defective, Citronin would not be produced. Consequently, all subsequent compounds (Aurantin, Rubidin, and the Final Pigment) would be low or absent. This contradicts the observation of high Aurantin.\n-   If Enzyme 2 were defective, Citronin would accumulate, and Aurantin would be low. This contradicts the observations.\n-   If Enzyme 4 were defective, Rubidin would accumulate because it could not be converted to the Final Red Pigment. This contradicts the observation of low Rubidin.\n-   If all enzymes were non-functional, no intermediates would be synthesized from the precursor, and all would be found in very low concentrations. This contradicts the finding of high Aurantin.\n\nTherefore, the only hypothesis that fits all the data is that there is a metabolic block at the step where Aurantin is converted to Rubidin. This reaction is catalyzed by Enzyme 3. The mutation must be in the gene encoding Enzyme 3, rendering it non-functional.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1515614"}, {"introduction": "Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) is a classic proteomics technique that separates proteins based on two independent properties: their isoelectric point ($pI$) and molecular weight. In this exercise [@problem_id:1515651], you will analyze a common experimental observation—a shift in a protein's position on a gel—to deduce the underlying biochemical change. This practice is key to understanding how proteomics reveals the dynamic regulation of proteins through post-translational modifications, which are often activated by cellular signaling.", "problem": "In a proteomics experiment, researchers are studying the effects of a newly discovered growth factor on a cell line. They use 2-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2D-GE) to analyze the cellular proteome. In 2D-GE, proteins are first separated in a horizontal dimension based on their isoelectric point (pI), which is the pH at which a protein has no net electrical charge. The pH gradient in this first dimension runs from acidic (low pH) on the left to basic (high pH) on the right. Subsequently, proteins are separated in a vertical dimension based on their molecular weight, with heavier proteins at the top and lighter ones at the bottom.\n\nTwo identical cell cultures are prepared. The 'control' culture is left untreated, while the 'treated' culture is exposed to the growth factor for a short period. Protein extracts from both cultures are run on separate 2D gels.\n\nUpon comparing the two gels, the researchers identify a protein spot, which they call 'Protein Z'. In the control gel, Protein Z is clearly visible. In the treated gel, the spot corresponding to Protein Z is observed to have shifted horizontally towards the acidic end of the pH gradient, while its vertical position (indicative of molecular weight) remains essentially unchanged.\n\nGiven that growth factor signaling pathways frequently activate specific enzymes that modify proteins, which of the following post-translational modifications is the most likely biochemical explanation for the observed shift of Protein Z?\n\nA. Glycosylation with a neutral sugar, such as mannose.\n\nB. Formation of an internal disulfide bond between two cysteine residues.\n\nC. Phosphorylation of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue.\n\nD. Deamination of an asparagine residue to an aspartate residue.\n\nE. Proteolytic cleavage that removes a small, highly basic peptide fragment.", "solution": "We use the definition of isoelectric point: for a given protein, let $Q(\\mathrm{pH})$ denote its net charge as a function of pH. The isoelectric point $pI$ satisfies $Q(pI)=0$. Because deprotonation increases with pH, $Q(\\mathrm{pH})$ is a monotonically decreasing function of pH, i.e., $dQ/d(\\mathrm{pH})<0$.\n\nObservation from the 2D-GE:\n- Horizontal shift toward the acidic end means the protein focuses at a lower pH after treatment, so its $pI$ has decreased: if the untreated protein has $pI$, the treated one has $pI^{\\prime}$ with $pI^{\\prime}<pI$.\n- Vertical position (indicative of molecular weight in SDS-PAGE) remains essentially unchanged, so the modification must not appreciably alter the apparent molecular weight.\n\nA post-translational modification that adds a negative charge shifts the net charge function to $Q^{\\prime}(\\mathrm{pH})=Q(\\mathrm{pH})-\\delta$ with $\\delta>0$. The new $pI^{\\prime}$ satisfies $Q^{\\prime}(pI^{\\prime})=0$, i.e., $Q(pI^{\\prime})=\\delta>0$. Since $Q$ decreases with pH, achieving a positive value $\\delta$ requires a lower pH than $pI$, hence $pI^{\\prime}<pI$. This exactly matches the observed leftward (acidic) shift. If the modification does not substantially change molecular weight, the vertical position should remain essentially unchanged, also matching the observation.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A. Glycosylation with a neutral sugar does not alter net charge, so $Q^{\\prime}(\\mathrm{pH})=Q(\\mathrm{pH})$ and $pI^{\\prime}=pI$, meaning no horizontal shift. It increases mass, so a vertical shift would be expected instead. Not consistent.\n- B. Formation of an internal disulfide bond changes neither net charge nor mass; moreover SDS-PAGE is typically performed under reducing conditions, eliminating disulfides. No horizontal shift expected. Not consistent.\n- C. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group that contributes negative charge at physiological pH values relevant for isoelectric focusing, so $Q^{\\prime}(\\mathrm{pH})=Q(\\mathrm{pH})-\\delta$ with $\\delta>0$, yielding $pI^{\\prime}<pI$ (leftward shift). The mass change is small relative to typical protein masses, so vertical mobility is essentially unchanged. This matches both observations and aligns with growth factor signaling, which commonly activates kinases. Consistent.\n- D. Deamination of asparagine to aspartate converts a neutral amide to a negatively charged carboxylate, also decreasing $pI$ and producing a leftward shift with minimal mass change. While biophysically plausible, this reaction is typically spontaneous or slow and is not a canonical acute response to growth factor signaling. Less consistent with the stated context.\n- E. Proteolytic cleavage that removes a basic peptide would decrease positive charge (acidify the pI) but would also reduce molecular weight, leading to a noticeable vertical shift, which was not observed. Not consistent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely biochemical explanation, especially in the context of acute growth factor signaling, is phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1515651"}, {"introduction": "A central goal of proteomics is to map where proteins reside within a cell, as location is inextricably linked to function.

A key first step in their investigation is to create a comprehensive inventory of all proteins present within the peroxisomes of healthy liver cells. This \"proteomic map\" will serve as a reference to compare against diseased cells. The team plans to use a mass spectrometry-based approach.\n\nWhich of the following experimental workflows is the most direct and accurate method for comprehensively identifying the proteins located specifically within the peroxisomes of liver cells?\n\nA. Homogenize liver cells to release intact organelles. Perform differential and density gradient centrifugation to isolate a highly purified peroxisome fraction.

The essential requirements are (i) organelle-level specificity (to ensure proteins are truly peroxisomal), (ii) high purity of the organelle fraction to minimize contamination, and (iii) a proteomic workflow with broad coverage and accurate identification.\n\nPrinciples and methodological considerations:\n- Subcellular fractionation by differential and density gradient centrifugation separates organelles based on size and buoyant density, enabling enrichment of peroxisomes to high purity. This increases specificity for peroxisomal proteins by physically isolating peroxisomes from other organelles.\n- Bottom-up proteomics (proteins digested with trypsin, peptides analyzed by LC-MS/MS, identifications via database search) is the standard, comprehensive, and accurate approach for complex proteomes, providing broad dynamic range and high identification depth.\n- Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has limited dynamic range, poor representation of hydrophobic and very large/small proteins, and lacks organelle specificity unless starting from an enriched fraction.\n- Transcriptomics does not measure proteins and peroxisomes do not contain genomes or their own mRNA; mRNA localization does not equate to protein localization. Thus RNA-Seq on peroxisomal material is inappropriate for proteome mapping.\n- FACS typically sorts cells, not intracellular organelles. An antibody applied to intact cells cannot label the peroxisome membrane because it is not exposed to the extracellular environment; labeling would require permeabilization and organelle isolation. While flow sorting of organelles can be done in specialized workflows, the stated approach is not the most direct or standard for high-purity peroxisome proteomics.\n- NMR spectroscopy is not suitable for identifying the complex mixture of proteins in an organelle lysate due to sensitivity and spectral complexity; it is not a standard proteome-wide identification method.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A: Uses differential and density gradient centrifugation to obtain a highly purified peroxisomal fraction, followed by standard bottom-up LC-MS/MS and database searching. This directly targets the peroxisomal compartment with a widely accepted, accurate, and comprehensive proteomic workflow. This meets all criteria of specificity, accuracy, and coverage.\n- Option B: Starts from whole-cell lysate, so lacks organelle specificity; 2D gels are less comprehensive and biased against many protein classes. Not suitable for specifically mapping the peroxisomal proteome.\n- Option C: Attempts transcriptomics from peroxisomes; peroxisomes lack mRNA and transcriptomics does not provide protein localization. Not appropriate.\n- Option D: Proposes antibody labeling of peroxisomes in intact cells followed by FACS; the peroxisome membrane is internal and inaccessible to extracellular antibodies without permeabilization, and FACS is not the standard for organelle sorting in this context. Not the most direct or accurate method described.\n- Option E: NMR is not an appropriate comprehensive protein identification method for complex organelle lysates.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the most direct and accurate method to comprehensively identify proteins specifically within peroxisomes of liver cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1515618"}]}
