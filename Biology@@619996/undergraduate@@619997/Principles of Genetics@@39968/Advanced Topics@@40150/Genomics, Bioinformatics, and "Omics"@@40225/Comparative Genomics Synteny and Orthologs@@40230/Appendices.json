The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the workhorse for this task, but its output of statistical scores requires careful interpretation. This exercise challenges you to act as a bioinformatician, using the key metrics from a BLAST report—the bit-score and E-value—to distinguish a true evolutionary counterpart from spurious matches and identify the most likely ortholog from a list of candidates [@problem_id:1478177].", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating a human gene, *FIBRONEX*, known to be critical for the formation of extracellular matrix proteins. To identify a potential functional counterpart in the mouse genome for future experimental studies, the researcher uses the human *FIBRONEX* protein sequence as a query in a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search against the entire mouse proteome. The search returns several potential matches, and the top three hits are summarized below.\n\n| Hit | Mouse Protein | Bit-Score | E-value | Chromosomal Location |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | M-Fibron | 850 | 1e-180 | Chr 2 |\n| 2 | Cohesin-B | 150 | 0.05 | Chr 11 |\n| 3 | FBN-mouse | 420 | 3e-95 | Chr 11 |\n\nBased on the principles of comparative genomics and the interpretation of BLAST results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the likely ortholog of human *FIBRONEX*?\n\nA. M-Fibron is the most likely ortholog because its name is the most similar to the human query gene, suggesting a shared origin.\n\nB. Cohesin-B is the most likely ortholog because it shares a chromosomal location with FBN-mouse, indicating a region of conserved synteny.\n\nC. M-Fibron is the most likely ortholog because it has the highest bit-score and the lowest E-value, indicating the most statistically significant sequence similarity.\n\nD. FBN-mouse is the most likely ortholog because its bit-score is moderately high while its E-value is significantly low, representing a balance between alignment quality and statistical significance.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine the most likely ortholog, as both M-Fibron and FBN-mouse have E-values so low they are effectively zero, making them equally likely candidates.", "solution": "The goal is to identify the most likely ortholog for the human gene *FIBRONEX* among the provided mouse protein hits from a BLAST search. Orthologs are genes in different species that originated from a single gene in the last common ancestor of those species. They are typically identified through significant sequence similarity. Let's analyze the key metrics from the BLAST results: Bit-Score and E-value.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Bit-Score**: The bit-score is a measure of the quality of the alignment between the query sequence (human *FIBRONEX*) and the subject sequence (the mouse protein hit). It is derived from a scoring matrix and is independent of the database size. A higher bit-score indicates a better alignment, meaning more matching amino acids and fewer gaps.\n\n2.  **Understanding the E-value (Expect value)**: The E-value represents the number of alignments with a score at least as high as the observed one that would be expected to occur purely by chance when searching a database of a particular size. A lower E-value indicates that the alignment is more statistically significant and less likely to be a random coincidence. An E-value close to zero (e.g., `1e-180`) means it is extremely unlikely that the observed similarity is due to chance.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each hit:\n-   **Hit 1 (M-Fibron)**: This hit has a bit-score of 850 and an E-value of `1e-180`. This is an extremely high bit-score and an extremely low (effectively zero) E-value. This combination signifies a very high-quality alignment that is exceptionally statistically significant.\n-   **Hit 2 (Cohesin-B)**: This hit has a very low bit-score of 150 and a relatively high E-value of 0.05. An E-value of 0.05 means that one might expect to see an alignment this good by chance 0.05 times (or 1 in 20 times) in a database of this size. This is generally considered a weak or borderline-significant hit and is unlikely to represent a true ortholog.\n-   **Hit 3 (FBN-mouse)**: This hit has a bit-score of 420 and an E-value of `3e-95`. While the E-value is also extremely low, indicating high statistical significance, its bit-score of 420 is substantially lower than M-Fibron's score of 850. This means the alignment quality of M-Fibron to the human query is much better than that of FBN-mouse.\n\nFinally, we analyze the options based on this understanding:\n\n-   **A. M-Fibron is the most likely ortholog because its name is the most similar...**: This is incorrect. Gene nomenclature can be arbitrary and is not a reliable scientific basis for determining evolutionary relationships. The primary evidence is sequence data.\n-   **B. Cohesin-B is the most likely ortholog because it shares a chromosomal location with FBN-mouse...**: This reasoning is flawed. The concept mentioned is synteny (genes located on the same chromosome). While conserved synteny can be supporting evidence for orthology, it is secondary to sequence similarity. Furthermore, the shared location of two *different* mouse genes does not strengthen the case for either being the ortholog of a *human* gene. Also, Cohesin-B itself is an extremely weak hit based on its score and E-value.\n-   **C. M-Fibron is the most likely ortholog because it has the highest bit-score and the lowest E-value...**: This is the correct reasoning. The combination of the highest bit-score (best alignment quality) and the lowest E-value (highest statistical significance) provides the strongest evidence for a true homologous relationship. In a cross-species comparison like this, this relationship is interpreted as orthology.\n-   **D. FBN-mouse is the most likely ortholog because its bit-score is moderately high...**: This is incorrect. While FBN-mouse is a significant hit, it is not the *best* hit. In ortholog identification, we look for the \"reciprocal best hit\", and M-Fibron is clearly a superior match based on both score and significance compared to FBN-mouse. There is no reason to prefer a \"balanced\" hit over the objectively best one.\n-   **E. It is impossible to determine... as both M-Fibron and FBN-mouse have E-values so low they are effectively zero...**: This is incorrect. While both E-values are very low, the bit-score provides a crucial, non-redundant piece of information about the quality of the alignment itself. An E-value depends on both the bit-score and the database size. Since the database size is constant for all hits, the higher bit-score of M-Fibron directly translates to a better sequence match, making it the more likely ortholog.\n\nTherefore, the best evidence points to M-Fibron as the most likely ortholog.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1478177"}, {"introduction": "While a one-way BLAST search can identify similar sequences, it doesn't guarantee a true one-to-one evolutionary relationship needed to define orthologs. To build a stronger case, researchers often use the Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH) method, a more rigorous two-way verification process.

We assume exactly one chromosomal rearrangement event caused the difference and seek the most parsimonious explanation.\n\nKey principle: A single inversion of a contiguous chromosomal segment reverses the order of the genes within that segment while leaving flanking regions unchanged. If we invert the segment containing genes B and C, the segment B-C becomes C-B, and the full order changes from A-B-C-D to A-C-B-D. This requires exactly two double-strand breakpoints at the boundaries of the inverted segment (between A|B and C|D), satisfying the single-event assumption with minimal breakpoints.\n\nWe now evaluate the options under the single-event and parsimony criteria:\n\n- Option D (inversion of the segment containing genes B and C): Inverting the contiguous block B-C transforms A-B-C-D into A-C-B-D in one event with two breakpoints.

Under a breakpoint parsimony criterion, this is less parsimonious than a two-breakpoint inversion.\n\n- Option B (deletion of the segment containing gene B): This would remove B entirely, giving A-C-D, not A-C-B-D; it contradicts the preservation of all four orthologs.\n\n- Option C (reciprocal translocation exchanging C-D with a segment from a non-homologous chromosome): This involves exchange with another chromosome and would disrupt the syntenic block and does not parsimoniously produce A-C-B-D within the same block in a single event.\n\n- Option E (tandem duplication of gene B): This would yield A-B-B-C-D or a related duplication configuration, not A-C-B-D.\n\nTherefore, the single, most parsimonious rearrangement that explains the observed change is an inversion of the chromosomal segment containing genes B and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1478172"}]}
