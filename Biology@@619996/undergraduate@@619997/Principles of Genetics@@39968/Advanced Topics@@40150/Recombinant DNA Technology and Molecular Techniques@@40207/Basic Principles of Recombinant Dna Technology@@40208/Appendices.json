The total size of this circular plasmid is 5.0 kilobase pairs (kb). The plasmid map reveals the presence of unique recognition sites for three different restriction enzymes: *EcoRI*, *BamHI*, and *HindIII*. The positions of these sites are mapped relative to the *EcoRI* site, which is designated as the 0 kb reference point. The *BamHI* site is located at the 1.5 kb mark, and the *HindIII* site is at the 4.0 kb mark.\n\nA sample of the pGEN101 plasmid is subjected to a double digestion, meaning it is incubated with both *EcoRI* and *BamHI* enzymes simultaneously until the reaction goes to completion.

This exercise challenges you to think beyond simple molecular weight and predict how different forms of the same plasmid—supercoiled, linear, and nicked-circular—will separate during electrophoresis, a key skill for accurately diagnosing the state of a DNA sample.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is tasked with verifying the integrity of a new plasmid preparation. The plasmid is a circular, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with a total size of 5,000 base pairs (bp). Using this preparation, the student creates three distinct samples to be analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, a technique that separates molecules in a porous gel matrix under an electric field primarily based on their size and conformation.\n\n*   **Sample 1:** Contains the plasmid in its native, **supercoiled** form, which is a tightly wound and compact structure.\n*   **Sample 2:** Contains the plasmid after it has been completely digested with a restriction enzyme that cuts at only one specific site, converting all the circular plasmids into a **linearized** form.\n*   **Sample 3:** Contains the plasmid after treatment with a nicking agent that introduces a single-strand break in the DNA backbone of each plasmid, causing it to unwind into a relaxed, **nicked-circular** form.\n\nAll three forms of the plasmid have the same molecular weight since they all consist of 5,000 bp.

Define the mobility $\\mu$ and velocity $v$ under electric field $E$ by\n$$\n\\mu=\\frac{v}{E},\\qquad \\mu=\\frac{q}{f},\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the effective charge and $f$ is the frictional coefficient that depends on molecular conformation and hydrodynamic radius in the porous gel matrix. For DNA, the charge density per base pair is approximately uniform; therefore for plasmid forms with the same length $L$ (here $L=5000$ base pairs), the effective charge $q$ is the same across all three samples. Consequently, differences in mobility arise from differences in $f$ due to conformation.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{sc}}$, $f_{\\text{lin}}$, and $f_{\\text{nc}}$ denote the frictional coefficients of supercoiled, linearized, and nicked-circular (relaxed open-circle) forms, respectively.

This advanced problem challenges you to think like a synthetic biologist, combining molecular tools like split-inteins and Cre recombinase to engineer a selection system for a multi-part assembly [@problem_id:1471868]. Solving this requires you to integrate several principles to create a system where survival is contingent on a precisely ordered genetic construct, illustrating the power and creativity of modern genetic engineering.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is developing a novel multi-fragment Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) assembly strategy. Their goal is to ensure that only bacterial colonies containing a plasmid with three specific inserts (Insert 1, Insert 2, and Insert 3), assembled in the precise order `1-2-3` and correct orientation, can survive. This process constitutes a positive selection system.\n\nThe team has the following molecular components at their disposal:\n1.  **Vector Backbone**: A plasmid vector that contains a strong constitutive prokaryotic promoter (`P_strong`) followed by a Ribosome Binding Site (`RBS`) and a cloning site for Insert 1. Elsewhere on the plasmid is a lethal gene cassette consisting of the `ccdB` gene (which is toxic to the host bacteria) flanked by two `loxP` recombination sites: `...loxP - ccdB - loxP...`.\n2.  **Cre Recombinase System**: The Cre recombinase protein, which specifically recognizes `loxP` sites and excises the intervening DNA sequence. The team can use the full coding sequence for Cre or split it into two non-functional halves: an N-terminal fragment (`N-Cre`) and a C-terminal fragment (`C-Cre`).\n3.  **Split Intein System**: A protein splicing element, split into two parts: `IntN` (the N-terminal fragment of the intein) and `IntC` (the C-terminal fragment). When `IntN` and `IntC` are part of the same polypeptide chain and are adjacent to each other, they will excise themselves and ligate the flanking N-terminal and C-terminal protein sequences (exteins) with a peptide bond. For example, a protein `(Extein1)-(IntN)-(IntC)-(Extein2)` will be processed into a single functional protein `(Extein1)-(Extein2)` and the excised `(IntN)-(IntC)` fragment.\n4.  **Target Inserts**: Three DNA fragments, Insert 1, Insert 2, and Insert 3, which must be assembled in that specific order. The cloning methodology ensures directional ligation (e.g., the end of Insert 1 can only ligate to the start of Insert 2, etc.), so fragment orientation within a correct assembly is guaranteed. The design must, however, select against incorrect orderings (e.g., `1-3-2`).\n\nThe overall principle is that successful assembly must lead to the expression of a functional Cre recombinase, which will then excise the lethal `ccdB` gene, allowing the cell to survive. Assume translation proceeds through all assembled fragments unless a stop codon is encountered.\n\nWhich of the following designs for the coding regions of the three inserts will achieve the desired selection?\n\nA.\n- Insert 1: Contains the coding sequence for `N-Cre`. It lacks a stop codon.\n- Insert 2: Contains the coding sequence for `IntN`. It lacks a stop codon.\n- Insert 3: Contains the coding sequence for `IntC` fused in-frame to the coding sequence for `C-Cre`, followed by a stop codon.\n\nB.\n- Insert 1: Contains the coding sequence for `N-Cre-IntN`. It lacks a stop codon.\n- Insert 2: Contains the coding sequence for `IntC-C-Cre`, followed by a stop codon.\n- Insert 3: A non-coding \"stuffer\" fragment.\n\nC.\n- Insert 1: Contains the coding sequence for `N-Cre`. It lacks a stop codon.\n- Insert 2: Contains the coding sequence for `IntC-C-Cre`. It lacks a stop codon.\n- Insert 3: Contains the coding sequence for `IntN`, followed by a stop codon.\n\nD.\n- Insert 1: Contains its own promoter and RBS, and the coding sequence for `N-Cre`, followed by a stop codon.\n- Insert 2: Contains the gene of interest, with a stop codon.\n- Insert 3: Contains its own promoter and RBS, and the coding sequence for `C-Cre`, followed by a stop codon.\n\nE.\n- Insert 1: Contains the coding sequence for the entire Cre recombinase, followed by a stop codon.\n- Insert 2: Contains the coding sequence for `IntN`. It lacks a stop codon.\n- Insert 3: Contains the coding sequence for `IntC` fused to an inhibitor of Cre, followed by a stop codon.", "solution": "The selection mechanism requires that only the correct 1-2-3 assembly produces a functional Cre recombinase. The underlying rules are:\n1) Transcription and translation initiate from the vector’s $P_{\\text{strong}}$ and RBS upstream of Insert 1 and proceed through all inserts in-frame until a stop codon is encountered.\n2) The lethal $ccdB$ cassette, flanked by $loxP$ sites, is excised only if a functional Cre recombinase is expressed; only those cells survive.\n3) Split intein splicing requires that $IntN$ and $IntC$ be directly adjacent within the same polypeptide. When adjacent, they excise themselves and ligate the flanking exteins into a single polypeptide. Therefore, to reconstruct full Cre, the polypeptide must contain the order $(\\text{N-Cre})-(IntN)-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})$ with no stop codon until after $(\\text{C-Cre})$.\n4) Directional ligation enforces orientation but not order. Thus, the design must ensure that only the 1-2-3 order yields the required adjacency of $IntN$ and $IntC$ with $(\\text{N-Cre})$ and $(\\text{C-Cre})$ as exteins, and that incorrect orders either introduce an early stop or disrupt adjacency, preventing Cre formation.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nOption A:\nInsert 1 has N-Cre (no stop); Insert 2 has IntN (no stop); Insert 3 has IntC fused in-frame to C-Cre with a stop. In the correct 1-2-3 order, translation produces $(\\text{N-Cre})-(IntN)-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})$-stop. $IntN$ and $IntC$ are adjacent; intein splicing removes them and ligates N-Cre to C-Cre, yielding full Cre, which excises $ccdB$ and allows survival. For incorrect orders:\n- 1-3-2 yields $(\\text{N-Cre})-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})$-stop; no adjacency with $IntN$, so no splicing and no Cre.\n- 2-1-3 yields $IntN-(\\text{N-Cre})-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})$-stop; $IntN$ and $IntC$ are not adjacent, so no splicing.\n- 2-3-1 yields $IntN-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})$-stop; $IntN$ and $IntC$ are adjacent, but the exteins flanking the intein are not $(\\text{N-Cre}, \\text{C-Cre})$ (N-Cre is downstream of the stop and not translated), so splicing cannot produce full Cre.\n- Any order starting with Insert 3 introduces an early stop before N-Cre is translated. Hence only 1-2-3 yields functional Cre. Option A satisfies the selection criterion.\n\nOption B:\nInsert 1 has N-Cre-IntN (no stop); Insert 2 has IntC-C-Cre-stop; Insert 3 is a non-coding stuffer. In the 1-2-3 order, $(\\text{N-Cre})-(IntN)-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})$-stop forms and splices to full Cre. However, in the 3-1-2 order, translation starts at the stuffer (assumed in-frame, no stop specified), then continues into N-Cre-IntN and then IntC-C-Cre; $IntN$ and $IntC$ are adjacent and splice to give full Cre. This incorrect order would also yield Cre and allow survival, violating the requirement. Therefore B fails.\n\nOption C:\nInsert 1 has N-Cre (no stop); Insert 2 has IntC-C-Cre (no stop); Insert 3 has IntN-stop. In the 1-2-3 order, the polypeptide is $(\\text{N-Cre})-(IntC)-(\\text{C-Cre})-(IntN)$-stop, where $IntN$ and $IntC$ are not adjacent. No splicing occurs and no Cre is formed. The correct order does not yield Cre, so C fails.\n\nOption D:\nEach of Insert 1 and Insert 3 carries its own promoter and RBS and encodes N-Cre and C-Cre, respectively, each with a stop; Insert 2 is unrelated. Split N-Cre and C-Cre expressed separately do not yield functional Cre without intein-mediated splicing (or another reconstitution strategy), which is absent here. Thus even the correct order would not produce functional Cre, and order dependence is not enforced. D fails.\n\nOption E:\nInsert 1 encodes full Cre with a stop; Inserts 2 and 3 encode intein parts, with Insert 3 also encoding a Cre inhibitor. Because Insert 1 alone produces full Cre (translation terminates at its stop), any order containing Insert 1 will produce Cre irrespective of the positions of Inserts 2 and 3, defeating order-based selection. E fails.\n\nTherefore, only Option A ensures that functional Cre is produced exclusively when the inserts are assembled in the correct 1-2-3 order, enabling positive selection via $ccdB$ excision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1471868"}]}
