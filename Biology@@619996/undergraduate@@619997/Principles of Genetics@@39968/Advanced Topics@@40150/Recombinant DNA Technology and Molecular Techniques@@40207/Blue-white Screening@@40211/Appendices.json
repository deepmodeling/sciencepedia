The vector contains an ampicillin resistance gene (`ampR`) and a `lacZα` gene fragment, which includes a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) within its coding sequence. The student's goal is to insert a specific DNA fragment into the MCS.\n\nThe cloning procedure involves the following steps:\n1.  A ligation reaction is performed to insert the DNA fragment into the plasmid vector. The reaction mixture contains a mixed population of plasmids: non-recombinant (original, self-ligated vector) and recombinant (vector with the DNA insert).\n2.  The resulting plasmids are used to transform a competent *E. coli* host strain. This host strain is `lacZ`-deficient but is capable of α-complementation.\n3.  The transformed bacteria are plated onto a growth medium containing agar, nutrients, ampicillin, and the chromogenic substrate X-gal.\n\nHowever, the student makes a critical error: they forget to add Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the growth medium. Assuming the transformation and ligation steps were partially successful (i.e., some bacteria were transformed with either recombinant or non-recombinant plasmids), what would be the predicted appearance of the bacterial colonies on the plates after incubation?\n\nChoose the single best description from the options below.\n\nA.

Only blue colonies will grow, and there will be no white colonies.", "solution": "Blue-white screening relies on the following principles:\n- Selection: The plasmid carries an ampicillin resistance gene, so only transformed bacteria harboring a plasmid (recombinant or non-recombinant) will form colonies on ampicillin-containing plates.\n- Screening: The plasmid also carries a `lacZα` fragment with an MCS. In a `lacZ`-deficient host capable of α-complementation, an intact `lacZα` on the plasmid complements the host to produce functional β-galactosidase, which cleaves X-gal to yield a blue product. Disruption of `lacZα` by insertion of foreign DNA prevents complementation and yields white colonies.\n\nGene expression requirement:\n- Expression of `lacZα` from the `lac` promoter requires induction. IPTG is a gratuitous inducer that relieves `LacI` repression and drives expression of `lacZα`. X-gal is only a chromogenic substrate; it does not induce expression.\n\nConsequences of omitting IPTG:\n- Recombinant plasmids (insert disrupts `lacZα`): No functional β-galactosidase is produced, so colonies are white irrespective of IPTG.\n- Non-recombinant plasmids (intact `lacZα`): Without IPTG, the `lac` promoter remains repressed by `LacI`, so `lacZα` is not appreciably expressed. Consequently, there is insufficient β-galactosidase activity to cleave X-gal, and colonies appear white.\n\nTherefore, on ampicillin/X-gal plates lacking IPTG, all viable transformants (both recombinant and non-recombinant) will appear white, making blue-white discrimination ineffective.

This plasmid contains an ampicillin resistance gene (*ampR*) and a *lacZα* gene. The *lacZα* gene encodes the alpha-peptide fragment of the enzyme β-galactosidase and contains a multiple cloning site (MCS) within its coding sequence. The student ligates a fragment of foreign DNA into the MCS of pVector and then attempts to transform a host strain of *Escherichia coli* with the ligation mixture.\n\nFollowing the transformation, the student plates the bacteria on an agar medium containing ampicillin, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal).

No colonies will grow on the plate.", "solution": "1) Define the vector and markers: The plasmid pVector carries two markers: ampicillin resistance (`ampR`) and `lacZα` containing a multiple cloning site (MCS). Insertion of foreign DNA into the MCS disrupts `lacZα`, preventing production of the alpha fragment.\n\n2) Standard blue-white principle (reference): In the usual host with a defective chromosomal `lacZ` lacking `lacZα` (e.g., `lacZΔM15`), functional β-galactosidase forms only when plasmid-encoded `lacZα` complements the host’s omega fragment. Thus:\n- Non-recombinant plasmid (intact `lacZα`) leads to functional enzyme and blue colonies on IPTG/X-gal.\n- Recombinant plasmid (disrupted `lacZα`) leads to no functional enzyme and white colonies.\n\n3) Given host genotype in this problem: The host strain has a complete, wild-type chromosomal `lacZ`. Therefore, it produces full-length β-galactosidase independently of any plasmid-encoded `lacZα`. The presence or disruption of plasmid `lacZα` is irrelevant for β-gal activity in this host.\n\n4) Role of plate components:\n- Ampicillin selects for cells that carry the plasmid (`ampR`); non-transformed cells die and do not form colonies.\n- IPTG induces expression of `lac` operon, increasing β-galactosidase production from the chromosomal `lacZ`.\n- X-gal is a chromogenic substrate cleaved by β-galactosidase to produce a blue product.\n\n5) Expected phenotype: All ampicillin-resistant colonies (i.e., transformants with either recombinant or non-recombinant plasmids) will express chromosomal β-galactosidase when induced by IPTG and will cleave X-gal, yielding blue colonies. The plasmid’s `lacZα` status does not affect colony color in this host.\n\n6) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. White colonies would not appear, because chromosomal `lacZ` makes all transformants blue.\n- B: Incorrect. Although a mixture is not expected, and plasmid insert status does not dictate blue/white in this host.\n- C: Correct. All colonies appear blue; distinguishing recombinant from non-recombinant by color is impossible.\n- D: Incorrect. The host’s functional `lacZ` does not inhibit plasmid `lacZα`; rather, it renders α-complementation unnecessary and masks differences.\n- E: Incorrect.

This problem [@problem_id:1472403] presents a fascinating exception to the rule, where a plasmid containing an insert unexpectedly gives rise to a blue colony. Analyzing this scenario will challenge you to think beyond simple insertional inactivation and consider the profound impact of the genetic code's reading frame on protein function.", "problem": "A student is performing a gene cloning experiment using blue-white screening. The plasmid vector used contains a multiple cloning site (MCS) embedded within the coding sequence of the *lacZα* gene, which is essential for α-complementation. The student ligates a 72 base pair (bp) synthetic DNA fragment into the MCS of the plasmid. This particular 72 bp fragment has been designed to have no internal translational stop codons.\n\nAfter transforming competent *Escherichia coli* cells (which express the omega fragment of β-galactosidase but lack the *lacZα* gene) with the ligation products, the student plates the bacteria on agar plates containing an antibiotic, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal).\n\nUpon incubation, the student observes the expected white colonies (indicating successful insertion) and some blue colonies (typically indicating plasmids without an insert). However, upon further analysis of several blue colonies, the student is surprised to find that they do, in fact, contain the 72 bp insert.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most scientifically plausible explanation for why these colonies with the insert are blue?\n\nA. The 72 bp insert is too small to disrupt the function of the β-galactosidase enzyme.\n\nB. The insert was ligated in-frame with the *lacZα* gene, and the resulting fusion protein retained its α-complementation activity.\n\nC. The *E. coli* host strain mutated to produce its own functional *lacZα* gene, rendering the screening process ineffective.\n\nD. The X-gal substrate was contaminated, causing a blue color to develop regardless of enzyme activity.\n\nE. The IPTG failed to induce the expression of the *lacZα* gene, leading to an ambiguous result.", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding the mechanism of blue-white screening and the consequences of inserting DNA into a coding sequence.\n\n1.  **Principle of Blue-White Screening:** Blue-white screening is based on the phenomenon of α-complementation. The host *E. coli* strain is engineered to produce a non-functional, mutant form of the β-galactosidase enzyme (the omega fragment). The plasmid vector carries the *lacZα* gene, which codes for a small peptide (the alpha fragment). When expressed, the alpha fragment complements the omega fragment, forming a functional β-galactosidase enzyme. IPTG is an inducer that turns on the expression of the *lacZα* gene. The functional enzyme can then cleave the colorless substrate X-gal, which produces a blue-colored insoluble product, turning the colony blue.\n\n2.  **Insertional Inactivation:** The multiple cloning site (MCS) is located within the coding sequence of the *lacZα* gene. When a foreign DNA fragment is successfully ligated into the MCS, it typically disrupts the gene's reading frame. A frameshift mutation alters the sequence of amino acids coded for downstream of the insertion and often introduces a premature stop codon. The resulting α-peptide is non-functional and cannot perform α-complementation. Therefore, no functional β-galactosidase is formed, X-gal is not cleaved, and the colony remains white. This is why white colonies are selected as containing the desired insert.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the \"Exception\":** The problem states that blue colonies were found to contain the insert. We need to find a reason why the insertion did not lead to inactivation. The crucial information is that the insert is 72 base pairs long and contains no internal stop codons.\n\n4.  **The Role of the Reading Frame:** The genetic code is read in triplets, or codons, where three base pairs code for one amino acid. The length of the insert, 72 bp, is an exact multiple of three ($72 / 3 = 24$). If such an insert is ligated into the *lacZα* gene in the correct orientation and starting at the correct position (i.e., *in-frame*), it will not disrupt the translational reading frame of the gene.\n\n5.  **Formation of a Fusion Protein:** Because the reading frame is maintained and the insert lacks stop codons, the ribosome will translate the a portion of the *lacZα* gene, proceed to translate the 24 amino acids encoded by the 72 bp insert, and then continue translating the rest of the *lacZα* gene. This process creates a single, larger polypeptide: a \"fusion protein\" consisting of the LacZα peptide with a 24-amino-acid sequence inserted into its middle.\n\n6.  **Functionality of the Fusion Protein:** The observation of a blue color means that this fusion protein must still be functional. It is still able to fold correctly and interact with the omega fragment to form an active β-galactosidase enzyme. This implies that the inserted 24-amino-acid sequence acts as a flexible linker or a domain that does not interfere with the critical structural elements of the α-peptide required for complementation.\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. The 72 bp insert is too small to disrupt the function of the β-galactosidase enzyme.** This is incorrect. The size is less important than the effect on the reading frame. An insert of just 4 bp would cause a frameshift and almost certainly inactivate the protein, while this 72 bp insert does not. Thus, size alone is not the explanation.\n    *   **B. The insert was ligated in-frame with the *lacZα* gene, and the resulting fusion protein retained its α-complementation activity.** This is the correct explanation. It accounts for the length being a multiple of three (preserving the reading frame) and correctly deduces that the resulting fusion protein must be functional to produce the blue color.\n    *   **C. The *E. coli* host strain mutated to produce its own functional *lacZα* gene.** While reversion mutations can happen, it is a rare event. It is a far less probable explanation than the direct consequence of an in-frame insertion. Moreover, this would not explain why only some colonies with inserts are blue; it would likely affect colonies randomly.\n    *   **D. The X-gal substrate was contaminated.** If the X-gal was faulty, it would likely affect the entire plate, causing all colonies (with or without inserts) to be blue or have an odd color. It would not selectively affect only those colonies with an in-frame insert.\n    *   **E. The IPTG failed to induce the expression of the *lacZα* gene.** If IPTG failed, the *lacZα* gene would not be expressed. In this case, no α-peptide would be made, and all colonies would be white, regardless of whether they contained an insert or not. This contradicts the observation of both blue and white colonies.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the in-frame insertion of the DNA fragment, which results in a functional fusion protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1472403"}]}
