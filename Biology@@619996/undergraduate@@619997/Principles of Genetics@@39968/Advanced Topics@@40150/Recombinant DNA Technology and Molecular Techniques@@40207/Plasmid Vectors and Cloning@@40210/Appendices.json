While lab protocols may specify amounts in nanograms, it is the molecular or molar ratio of insert to vector that dictates the efficiency of the reaction. This fundamental practice [@problem_id:1509578] illustrates a common but critical error, challenging you to perform the quantitative conversion between mass and moles for DNA of different lengths and understand its dramatic impact on experimental outcomes.", "problem": "In a molecular cloning experiment, a student aims to ligate a small DNA fragment (the insert) into a circular plasmid (the vector). The vector is 5.0 kilobase pairs (kb) in length, where 1 kb = 1000 base pairs (bp). The insert is 500 bp in length. For optimal ligation, a molar ratio of 3:1 (insert:vector) is typically recommended. However, the student misunderstands the protocol and instead, mixes equal *mass* amounts of the vector and the insert in the ligation reaction buffer. Assuming the average molar mass of a DNA base pair is constant, calculate the resulting molar ratio of insert to vector molecules in the student's reaction mixture. Express your answer as a single number representing the ratio (e.g., for a 10:1 ratio, the answer is 10).", "solution": "Let $L_{v}$ and $L_{i}$ denote the lengths (in base pairs) of the vector and insert, respectively.

A pure sample of uncut plasmid DNA can surprisingly resolve into multiple bands, a phenomenon that often puzzles students. This exercise [@problem_id:1509553] will guide you through understanding how a plasmid's three-dimensional shape, or topology, influences its migration through a gel, enabling you to identify the supercoiled, relaxed circular, and linear forms that are essential for diagnosing plasmid integrity.", "problem": "A molecular biology student has successfully isolated a circular plasmid from a bacterial culture. The plasmid has a total size of 5000 base pairs. To verify the presence and quality of the plasmid, the student loads a small amount of the purified, uncut plasmid sample into a well of an agarose gel and performs gel electrophoresis. After staining, the student observes three distinct bands of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) on the gel. The bands are labeled based on their migration distance from the loading well: Band 1 migrated the farthest, Band 2 migrated an intermediate distance, and Band 3 migrated the shortest distance.\n\nAssuming that the three bands are all different conformations of the same 5000 base pair plasmid, which of the following options correctly identifies the molecular form corresponding to each band?\n\nA.

The three common topological forms present in such a sample are:\n1) Covalently closed circular (supercoiled) DNA, which is torsionally strained and highly compact.\n2) Nicked open circular (relaxed circular) DNA, which has at least one strand nick and adopts an expanded, relaxed conformation.\n3) Linear DNA, which may arise from accidental double-strand breaks during handling.\n\nIn agarose gel electrophoresis at a given agarose concentration and buffer, DNA molecules migrate according to both size and conformation. For DNA of identical length (here, all are the same 5000 base pairs), the key determinant is hydrodynamic volume and topology:\n- Supercoiled DNA is the most compact, thus experiences less frictional drag and migrates the fastest (farthest from the well).\n- Linear DNA has an intermediate effective volume for a given length and migrates at an intermediate distance.\n- Relaxed circular (nicked) DNA has the largest hydrodynamic radius among these forms and thus migrates the slowest (shortest distance from the well).\n\nTherefore, mapping the observed migration distances to conformations:\n- Band 1 (farthest migration) corresponds to supercoiled DNA.\n- Band 2 (intermediate migration) corresponds to linear DNA.\n- Band 3 (shortest migration) corresponds to relaxed circular DNA.\n\nComparing with the provided options, this ordering matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1509553"}, {"introduction": "Successful molecular cloning requires not only precise execution but also sharp troubleshooting skills for when experiments deviate from the expected path.

By integrating your knowledge of vector design, restriction digests, ligation artifacts, and reporter gene function, you will develop the critical thinking needed to diagnose common issues encountered in the lab.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is performing a cloning experiment to insert a gene of interest into a plasmid vector, pClone101. The pClone101 vector is 3.0 kilobases (kb) in size, carries an ampicillin resistance gene (`ampR`), and contains a `lacZ` gene encoding the alpha-fragment of the enzyme β-galactosidase. Within the `lacZ` gene is a unique Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) containing a recognition site for the restriction enzyme EcoRI.\n\nThe gene of interest is 1.2 kb in size and is flanked by EcoRI sites. The experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  Both the pClone101 vector and the DNA containing the gene of interest are digested with EcoRI.\n2.  The digested vector and insert are mixed together with DNA ligase.\n3.  The ligation mixture is used to transform competent *E. coli* cells that lack a functional `lacZ` gene on their chromosome.\n4.  The transformed cells are plated on nutrient agar containing ampicillin, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal).\n\nAfter incubation, both blue and white colonies appear on the plates. The student selects a single white colony, grows it in a liquid culture with ampicillin, and performs a plasmid miniprep to isolate the plasmid DNA. The isolated plasmid is then digested with EcoRI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel reveals a single, distinct DNA band corresponding to a size of 3.0 kb.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible explanation for this set of observations?\n\nA. The ligation step failed, and the colony grew from a cell that took up an original, undigested pClone101 plasmid.\n\nB. The insert DNA was successfully cloned into the plasmid, but a spontaneous mutation occurred in the ampicillin resistance gene (`ampR`), which also inactivated the `lacZ` gene.\n\nC. The vector was digested correctly, but re-ligated to itself without the insert. During this process, a small number of base pairs were deleted from the MCS, causing a frameshift mutation that inactivated the `lacZ` gene.\n\nD. The colony grew from a non-transformed bacterial cell that had a spontaneous mutation conferring ampicillin resistance.\n\nE. The X-gal in the agar medium was defective, causing all colonies that contain the pClone101 plasmid to appear white.", "solution": "We begin by applying the principles of blue-white screening and restriction analysis.\n\n- The pClone101 vector has size $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$, carries $ampR$, and a $lacZ\\alpha$ gene with an EcoRI site in the MCS.\n- The insert is $1.2\\ \\text{kb}$, flanked by EcoRI sites.\n\nBlue-white screening logic:\n- Functional $lacZ\\alpha$ on the plasmid complements the host to produce beta-galactosidase in the presence of IPTG and X-gal, yielding blue colonies.\n- Disruption of $lacZ\\alpha$ (typically by insertion into the MCS) yields white colonies.\n\nRestriction analysis expectations after EcoRI digestion:\n- If the insert is cloned into the EcoRI site, the recombinant plasmid size is $3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2\\ \\text{kb}$. Because EcoRI sites are regenerated at both junctions when ligating EcoRI-compatible ends, digesting with EcoRI should yield two bands: one at $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$ (vector backbone) and one at $1.2\\ \\text{kb}$ (insert).\n- If the vector self-ligates without the insert, the plasmid remains $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$. EcoRI digestion yields a single band at $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$.\n\nObserved data:\n- The selected colony is white.\n- EcoRI digestion of the miniprepped plasmid yields a single band at $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$.\n\nInterpretation:\n- The single $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$ band shows the plasmid lacks the $1.2\\ \\text{kb}$ insert; thus, the plasmid is effectively empty vector.\n- The white color requires inactivation of $lacZ\\alpha$. Since there is no insert, a plausible cause is a small deletion or frameshift in the MCS that disrupts $lacZ\\alpha$ during re-ligation.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Uptake of undigested, intact pClone101 would retain functional $lacZ\\alpha$, giving blue colonies; this contradicts the white colony observed.\n- B: Successful cloning would produce a $4.2\\ \\text{kb}$ plasmid and, upon EcoRI digestion, two bands ($3.0\\ \\text{kb}$ and $1.2\\ \\text{kb}$). Also, a mutation in $ampR$ would not inactivate $lacZ$, and the colony grew on ampicillin, implying $ampR$ is functional.\n- C: Correct digestion of vector followed by self-ligation without insert, accompanied by a small deletion in the MCS causing a frameshift in $lacZ\\alpha$, explains both the white colony and the single $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$ band after EcoRI digestion.\n- D: A non-transformed cell with spontaneous ampicillin resistance would not yield plasmid DNA on miniprep, and the gel would not show a defined $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$ plasmid band; this is implausible given the observed plasmid band.\n- E: X-gal cannot be globally defective because both blue and white colonies appeared; thus, X-gal was functional.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is that the vector re-ligated without the insert, and a small deletion in the MCS inactivated $lacZ\\alpha$, yielding a white colony and a single $3.0\\ \\text{kb}$ band upon EcoRI digestion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1509573"}]}
