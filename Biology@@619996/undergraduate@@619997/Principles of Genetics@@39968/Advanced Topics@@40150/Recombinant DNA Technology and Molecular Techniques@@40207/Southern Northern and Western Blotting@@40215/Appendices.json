The analysis focuses on a 20 kilobase (kb) region of the human genome that contains the entire coding sequence for a gene of interest. In the wild-type allele, this region is characterized by having recognition sites for the restriction enzyme HindIII at the following positions, measured from the left end of the region: 0 kb, 12 kb, and 20 kb. For the analysis, a labeled DNA probe is used that is complementary to a unique sequence located from position 2 kb to position 3 kb within this region.\n\nIn affected individuals, a single point mutation is consistently observed. This mutation creates a new HindIII recognition site at the 8 kb position. This change in the DNA sequence that results in a different pattern of restriction fragments is a type of Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).\n\nA DNA sample is obtained from an individual who is heterozygous for this mutation, meaning they have one wild-type allele and one mutant allele.

Southern blot detects only those restriction fragments that contain the sequence complementary to the probe. The probe hybridizes to the genomic interval from 2 kb to 3 kb, which we model as the interval $[2,3]$ measured from the left end of the 20 kb region.\n\nLet the set of HindIII cut positions (in kb) be $S$. The resulting fragments are the consecutive intervals determined by $S$, and each fragment length equals the difference of adjacent cut positions.

This problem presents a common experimental observation that requires careful biological interpretation: a single gene producing multiple distinct mRNA bands. Solving this puzzle will deepen your understanding of fundamental regulatory mechanisms like alternative splicing, which vastly expands the proteomic potential of the genome. [@problem_id:1521635]", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the expression of a newly characterized gene, which we will call `Gene Z`, in human pancreatic cells. It has been confirmed through genome sequencing that `Gene Z` exists as a single copy within the human genome. To analyze its transcription, the biologist isolates total ribonucleic acid (RNA) from a culture of these cells. A Northern blot is then performed using a radioactive probe that is complementary to the full-length coding sequence of `Gene Z`. The results of the blot reveal two distinct bands: one major band corresponding to a transcript size of 3.2 kilobases (kb) and a second, less intense band at 2.7 kb.\n\nAssuming the experiment was performed correctly and there are no technical artifacts, which of the following is the most plausible biological explanation for the presence of two distinct mRNA bands originating from a single-copy gene?\n\nA. The protein product of `Gene Z` undergoes post-translational cleavage, resulting in two protein isoforms of different molecular weights.\n\nB. The two homologous chromosomes in the diploid pancreatic cells contain different alleles of `Gene Z` that are transcribed into different-sized RNAs.\n\nC. The primary transcript of `Gene Z` undergoes alternative splicing, generating two distinct mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules of different lengths.\n\nD. The `Gene Z` locus is susceptible to somatic mutation, and a subpopulation of the cultured cells has acquired a large deletion within the gene.\n\nE. `Gene Z` is transcribed from two different promoter sites, leading to two primary transcripts with different 5' untranslated regions.", "solution": "We start from the experimental readout: a Northern blot detects RNA species by size through hybridization of a labeled probe to complementary RNA and separation by gel electrophoresis. A single gene can yield multiple mRNA bands if there are distinct RNA isoforms differing in length, arising from transcriptional start site variation, alternative splicing, or alternative polyadenylation. The probe here is complementary to the full-length coding sequence, so any transcript that includes the coding region will be detected regardless of differences in untranslated regions.\n\nEvaluate each option against what a Northern blot reveals:\n- Option A concerns post-translational protein cleavage. Northern blot measures RNA, not protein; post-translational events cannot create multiple RNA bands. Thus A does not explain the observation.\n- Option B posits different alleles on homologous chromosomes producing different-sized RNAs. While allelic variation can alter transcript length, large differences of approximately 0.5 kilobases in mature mRNA are less common from simple allelic variation. Moreover, a diploid cell line expressing both alleles typically yields comparable band intensities if expression is not allele-biased; the observed one major and one minor band pattern is more characteristic of regulated isoform abundance than of two alleles of a single-copy locus. This makes B less plausible than regulated processing mechanisms.\n- Option D invokes somatic mutation generating a deleted transcript in a subpopulation. A consistent, discrete 0.5 kilobase shorter band across the culture is unlikely to be due to random somatic deletion events; such deletions often disrupt probe binding if within the coding region or trigger nonsense-mediated decay, and would not reproducibly produce a defined shorter transcript in a stable proportion. This is less plausible than regulated RNA processing.\n- Option E suggests transcription from two promoters leading to different 5' untranslated regions. This can indeed generate different primary transcript lengths, and because the probe targets the coding sequence, both would be detected on a Northern blot. However, promoter choice alone does not necessitate a 0.5 kilobase difference unless there are markedly different 5' UTRs; while possible, a more common and broadly applicable mechanism for generating multiple mature mRNA sizes from a single gene is alternative splicing.\n- Option C states that the primary transcript undergoes alternative splicing to yield two mature mRNA molecules of different lengths. This is a canonical and common mechanism for producing multiple discrete mRNA bands from a single-copy gene and readily explains a major and a minor band corresponding to differently spliced isoforms.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible biological explanation for two distinct mRNA bands from a single-copy gene on a Northern blot with a coding-sequence probe is alternative splicing of the primary transcript.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1521635"}, {"introduction": "Completing the journey from gene to function, Western blotting allows us to detect and characterize specific proteins.

Sequence analysis suggests that the single polypeptide chain (monomer) of GRF1 has a molecular weight of 42.5 kilodaltons (kDa).

From the problem statement, $M_{\\text{mono}} = 42.5$ kDa.\n\nPrinciple 1 (SDS effect): Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) denatures proteins and imposes a nearly uniform charge-to-mass ratio, so migration in SDS-PAGE depends primarily on size (apparent molecular weight). SDS disrupts noncovalent interactions but does not reduce disulfide bonds.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Reducing agent effect): A strong reducing agent such as $\\beta$-mercaptoethanol reduces disulfide bonds, converting covalently linked subunits into separate polypeptide chains.\n\nGiven that GRF1 is a covalently linked homodimer in its functional cellular state via intermolecular disulfide bonds, the dimeric molecular weight is\n$$\nM_{\\text{dimer}} = 2 M_{\\text{mono}}.\n$$\n\nSample A (no reducing agent): Disulfide bonds remain intact during SDS treatment, so the protein remains as a covalently linked homodimer.
