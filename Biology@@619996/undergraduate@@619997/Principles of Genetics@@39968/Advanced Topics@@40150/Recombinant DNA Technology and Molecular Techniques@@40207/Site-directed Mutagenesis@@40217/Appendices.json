Before designing primers or running a PCR, a scientist must be able to predict the molecular consequence of altering the DNA sequence. This first exercise [@problem_id:1521291] tests your ability to apply the principles of the genetic code to a hypothetical mutation, solidifying the crucial link between a change in a gene and its ultimate impact on the protein product.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a critical enzyme involved in cellular metabolism. The gene encoding this enzyme contains a specific codon at position 152 that reads `5'-AAA-3'` on the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) coding strand, which specifies the amino acid lysine. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the researcher introduces a single-base substitution, changing this codon to `5'-TAA-3'`. Assuming this mutation occurs far from the end of the gene's coding sequence, which of the following statements best classifies the mutation and predicts its most direct consequence on the synthesis of the final polypeptide?\n\nA. This is a silent mutation, and it will have no effect on the final polypeptide chain.\n\nB. This is a missense mutation, and a different amino acid will be incorporated in place of lysine.\n\nC. This is a nonsense mutation, and translation will terminate prematurely.\n\nD. This is a frameshift mutation, and all amino acids downstream of position 152 will be incorrect.\n\nE. This is a missense mutation, and the ribosome will stall indefinitely at this position.", "solution": "Principle: The DNA coding (sense) strand has the same 5' to 3' sequence as the mRNA except that thymine (T) in DNA is replaced by uracil (U) in RNA. During translation, codons in the mRNA are read to specify amino acids; special stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, `UGA`) do not encode amino acids but are recognized by release factors to terminate translation.\n\nOriginal codon analysis: The coding strand at position 152 is `5'-AAA-3'`. The corresponding mRNA codon is `5'-AAA-3'`, which specifies lysine in the standard genetic code.\n\nMutation analysis: The single-base substitution changes the coding-strand triplet to `5'-TAA-3'`. The corresponding mRNA codon is `5'-UAA-3'`. `UAA` is a stop codon.\n\nClassification and consequence: A point mutation that converts a sense codon (for lysine) into a stop codon (`UAA`) is a nonsense mutation. Because the mutation is far from the normal end of the coding sequence, the presence of `UAA` causes premature termination of translation at this position via release factor binding, producing a truncated polypeptide.\n\nExclusion of other options:\n- Not silent: the encoded product changes from lysine to termination, altering the polypeptide length.\n- Not missense: no alternative amino acid is incorporated; translation stops.\n- Not frameshift: there is no insertion or deletion; reading frame is unchanged.\n- No ribosomal stalling: stop codons trigger termination, not indefinite stalling.\n\nTherefore, the best classification and consequence are a nonsense mutation with premature termination of translation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1521291"}, {"introduction": "Once a target mutation is identified, the next practical step is to design the molecular tool that introduces this specific change: the mutagenic primer.

The mutagenesis primer must be a forward primer identical to the desired mutated coding strand (complementary to the template strand), so we must replace only the $ATG$ codon in the coding-strand context while keeping the flanking sequence unchanged.\n\nAmong Leu codons, choosing $CTG$ changes only the first base of $ATG$ (from $A$ to $C$), minimizing the number of mismatches while preserving the reading frame.

This final practice problem [@problem_id:1521319] delves into the elegant selection mechanism that makes this possible, focusing on the role of the DpnI enzyme. By analyzing a common troubleshooting scenario—what happens if you forget this critical step?—you will gain a deeper, practical understanding of how to ensure that the colonies you screen actually contain your desired mutation.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is performing a site-directed mutagenesis experiment to introduce a point mutation into a gene of interest cloned within a plasmid. The protocol involves the following key steps:\n1.  Using the original, wild-type plasmid (which was isolated from a dam+ *E. coli* strain, meaning its DNA is methylated at GATC sequences) as a template.\n2.  Performing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with primers that contain the desired mutation. This reaction synthesizes new DNA strands incorporating the mutation, using the original plasmid strands as templates.\n3.  Digesting the PCR product with the DpnI restriction enzyme, which specifically recognizes and cleaves methylated DNA.\n4.  Transforming chemically competent *E. coli* cells with the DpnI-treated product.\n5.

Assuming the PCR and transformation steps are otherwise successful, which of the following outcomes is the most probable?\n\nA. No bacterial colonies will grow on the selective plate because the unmethylated, newly synthesized DNA is recognized as foreign and degraded by the *E. coli* host.\n\nB. All of the resulting colonies will contain the plasmid with the desired mutation, as the PCR successfully amplified the mutated version.\n\nC. A mixture of colonies will be obtained, but the vast majority will contain the original, unmutated wild-type plasmid.\n\nD. The resulting colonies will contain a roughly equal mixture of wild-type plasmids and plasmids with the desired mutation.\n\nE. The transformation efficiency will be extremely low, but the few colonies that do grow will exclusively contain the plasmid with the desired mutation.", "solution": "- The starting template plasmid prepared from a dam+ strain is methylated at GATC sites. During the mutagenesis PCR, primers carrying the desired base change anneal to the methylated parental template and a high-fidelity polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands that incorporate the mutation. The newly synthesized DNA is unmethylated because the methylation state is not copied by the polymerase; methylation would only occur after successful replication in a host cell.\n\n- After PCR, the reaction mixture contains: \n  1) the original, intact, supercoiled, methylated parental plasmid (wild type), and \n  2) newly synthesized mutant plasmid DNA that is typically nicked circular or otherwise less supercoiled and unmethylated. The parental plasmid remains present because it served as the template and is not consumed.\n\n- The purpose of DpnI digestion (the omitted Step 3) is to selectively cleave methylated DNA at GATC sites, thereby destroying the parental template while leaving the unmethylated PCR-derived mutant molecules intact. Skipping DpnI therefore leaves a mixture dominated by the intact, supercoiled, methylated parental plasmid plus the less efficiently transformable mutant products.\n\n- Upon transformation into standard laboratory strains of chemically competent Escherichia coli, unmethylated plasmid DNA is not inherently rejected; such strains generally lack active restriction barriers against unmethylated DNA. However, transformation efficiency strongly favors intact, supercoiled plasmid DNA over nicked or linear DNA. Therefore, in the absence of DpnI digestion, the parental supercoiled wild-type plasmid will transform at much higher efficiency than the nicked/unmethylated mutant PCR product. Consequently, most colonies will arise from cells that received the wild-type parental plasmid, with only a minority (if any) containing the intended mutation.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  A is incorrect because unmethylated plasmid DNA is routinely accepted by laboratory E. coli strains; no global degradation of unmethylated DNA prevents colony growth.\n  B is incorrect because the parental template remains and transforms more efficiently, so not all colonies will carry the mutation.\n  C is correct: skipping DpnI leaves both parental and mutant molecules present, and the supercoiled parental plasmid dominates transformation, yielding mainly wild-type colonies with at best a small fraction of mutants.\n  D is unlikely because the efficiency difference between supercoiled parental and nicked mutant DNA prevents a roughly equal mixture.\n  E is incorrect because transformation will not be extremely low due to the presence of the intact parental plasmid, and colonies will not be exclusively mutant.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcome is that the vast majority of colonies will carry the original wild-type plasmid, with at most a minority carrying the desired mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1521319"}]}
