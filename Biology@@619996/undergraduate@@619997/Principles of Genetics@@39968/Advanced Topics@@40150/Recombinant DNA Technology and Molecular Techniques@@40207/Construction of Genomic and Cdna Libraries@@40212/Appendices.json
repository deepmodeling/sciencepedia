This exercise challenges you to think critically about the connection between fundamental cell biology and the practical requirements of molecular genetics. By considering why a common and abundant cell type is unsuitable, you will reinforce your understanding of what a \"genome\" truly represents and where it is located within an organism's cells [@problem_id:1479480].", "problem": "A research team is planning to construct a human genomic library, which is a collection of DNA fragments representing the entire genome of an individual, cloned into a vector for propagation and analysis. One junior scientist suggests using mature, circulating red blood cells (erythrocytes) as the source material, arguing that they are the most abundant cell type in a blood sample and are easy to purify. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed and will not yield a representative genomic library. Which of the following statements provides the primary and most accurate biological reason for this failure?\n\nA. The high concentration of hemoglobin protein in red blood cells interferes with the enzymes used for DNA extraction and cloning.\n\nB. Genomic libraries are constructed from messenger RNA (mRNA), and mature red blood cells lack the transcriptional machinery to produce mRNA.\n\nC. Mature red blood cells are anucleated; they lack a nucleus and, consequently, the chromosomal DNA that constitutes the vast majority of the genome.\n\nD. During maturation, the DNA in red blood cells is permanently and irreversibly condensed, making it impossible to fragment with restriction enzymes.", "solution": "A genomic library is a collection of DNA fragments that together represent the entire nuclear genome of an organism. Constructing such a library requires isolation of chromosomal DNA from cells that contain a nucleus. Mature human erythrocytes lack a nucleus due to enucleation during erythropoiesis; therefore, they contain essentially no chromosomal DNA. Consequently, there is no source of nuclear genomic DNA to fragment and clone, making it impossible to produce a representative genomic library from mature red blood cells.\n\nOption A is not the primary reason: although hemoglobin is abundant, proteins can be removed during nucleic acid purification, and the absence of DNA is the fundamental problem. Option B is incorrect because genomic libraries are made from genomic DNA, not messenger RNA; cDNA libraries use mRNA. Option D is incorrect because human erythrocytes do not retain irreversibly condensed DNA; rather, they expel the nucleus entirely, leaving no chromosomal DNA behind.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most accurate reason is that mature erythrocytes are anucleated and lack chromosomal DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1479480"}, {"introduction": "A successful molecular biology experiment relies on every reagent performing its specific function. This thought experiment presents a common lab scenario—an omitted reagent—to test your understanding of the step-by-step process of cDNA library construction. By diagnosing the outcome of this error, you will clarify the indispensable role of reverse transcriptase in converting the transient information in mRNA into stable, clonable DNA [@problem_id:1479493].", "problem": "A molecular biology student is tasked with creating a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) library to study gene expression in a specific type of plant leaf tissue. The process begins with isolating all messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from the tissue. The standard protocol then involves using the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize a single strand of cDNA from the mRNA templates. Following this, DNA polymerase is used to create double-stranded DNA molecules, which are then cut with a restriction enzyme and ligated into a plasmid vector. This plasmid vector contains a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\n\nIn a critical error, the student forgets to add reverse transcriptase to the initial reaction mixture. Unaware of the mistake, they proceed with all subsequent steps of the protocol, including the addition of DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, and finally, the transformation of the resulting plasmids into a competent strain of *E. coli*. The bacteria are then plated on a nutrient agar medium containing ampicillin.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most probable result of this experiment?\n\nA. No bacterial colonies will grow on the ampicillin plate.\n\nB. A large number of bacterial colonies will grow, and screening will show that they form a successful cDNA library representing the plant's leaf transcriptome.\n\nC. The bacterial colonies that grow will contain plasmids with the original mRNA molecules directly ligated into the vector.\n\nD. A large number of bacterial colonies will grow, but screening will reveal their plasmids are \"empty\" and do not contain any cDNA inserts.\n\nE. The bacterial colonies that grow will contain plasmids with inserts derived from the plant's genomic DNA rather than cDNA.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the outcome of a cDNA library construction experiment where the enzyme reverse transcriptase is omitted. Let's analyze the process step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Objective of cDNA Library Construction**: The goal is to convert the population of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecules (the transcriptome) from a specific tissue into a stable collection of double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules, which are then inserted into plasmids.\n\n2.  **Role of Reverse Transcriptase**: The first and most crucial step in this process is reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that synthesizes a single-stranded DNA molecule (called complementary DNA, or cDNA) using an RNA molecule as a template. In this experiment, the isolated plant mRNA is the intended template.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Error**: The student forgot to add reverse transcriptase. Without this enzyme, the conversion of mRNA to cDNA cannot occur. The reaction tube for the first step will simply contain the original mRNA, primers (typically oligo-dT to bind to the poly-A tails of eukaryotic mRNA), dNTPs, and buffer, but no new DNA will be synthesized.\n\n4.  **Impact on Subsequent Steps**:\n    *   **Second Strand Synthesis**: The next step is to use DNA polymerase to create a double-stranded DNA molecule. DNA polymerase requires a DNA template to synthesize a new DNA strand. Since the first step failed to produce any single-stranded cDNA, the DNA polymerase has no template to work with. Consequently, no double-stranded DNA fragments corresponding to the mRNA are generated.\n    *   **Ligation**: The protocol involves cutting the plasmid vector with a restriction enzyme and then ligating the double-stranded DNA fragments into it using DNA ligase. Since no double-stranded DNA fragments were created, there are no inserts to be ligated into the plasmids. The plasmid vectors are cut, but in the absence of inserts, the most likely reaction catalyzed by DNA ligase is the re-ligation of the plasmid's own \"sticky ends,\" reforming the original, \"empty\" plasmid.\n\n5.  **Transformation and Plating**:\n    *   **Transformation**: The mixture containing the re-ligated (empty) plasmids is then used to transform competent *E. coli* cells.\n    *   **Selection**: The plasmid vector contains a gene for ampicillin resistance. Any bacterium that successfully takes up a plasmid (even an empty one) will be able to survive and multiply on an agar plate containing ampicillin.\n    *   **Outcome**: Therefore, many bacterial cells will be successfully transformed with the empty plasmids and will form colonies on the ampicillin-containing medium.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A. No bacterial colonies will grow on the ampicillin plate.** This is incorrect. Transformation with self-ligated plasmids that carry the ampicillin resistance gene will allow bacteria to grow.\n    *   **B. A large number of bacterial colonies will grow, and screening will show that they form a successful cDNA library...** This is incorrect. The library construction failed at the very first step because no cDNA was synthesized.\n    *   **C. The bacterial colonies that grow will contain plasmids with the original mRNA molecules directly ligated into the vector.** This is incorrect. Standard DNA ligase joins DNA ends, not RNA to DNA. Furthermore, mRNA is single-stranded and would not have the correct structure to be ligated into a double-stranded plasmid vector.\n    *   **D. A large number of bacterial colonies will grow, but screening will reveal their plasmids are \"empty\" and do not contain any cDNA inserts.** This is the correct outcome. The bacteria are transformed with self-ligated, empty plasmids, conferring antibiotic resistance and allowing them to form colonies. However, these plasmids lack the desired cDNA inserts from the plant leaf tissue.\n    *   **E. The bacterial colonies that grow will contain plasmids with inserts derived from the plant's genomic DNA rather than cDNA.** This is incorrect. The starting material for the entire procedure was purified mRNA, not genomic DNA.
