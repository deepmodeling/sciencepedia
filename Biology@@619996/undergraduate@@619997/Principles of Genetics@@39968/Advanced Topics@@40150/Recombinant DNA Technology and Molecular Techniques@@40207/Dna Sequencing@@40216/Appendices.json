This first practice presents a thought experiment where a crucial ingredient is mistakenly left out of the reaction. By working through the consequences of this error [@problem_id:1484088], you will sharpen your understanding of the distinct functions of deoxynucleoside triphosphates ($dNTPs$) for chain extension and dideoxynucleoside triphosphates ($ddNTPs$) for chain termination, the core principle that made reliable DNA sequencing possible.", "problem": "A researcher is using the Sanger dideoxy method to sequence a short, single-stranded DNA template. The sequence of the template strand is `3'-CGT ATG GCT AAG CAT-5'`. A primer with the sequence `5'-GCA TAC-3'` is used to initiate DNA synthesis.\n\nThe experiment is set up with four reaction tubes. Each tube contains the DNA template, the primer, DNA polymerase, and a small amount of one of the four chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs): one tube has ddATP, another ddGTP, another ddCTP, and the last has ddTTP. A master mix containing the necessary building blocks, the standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), is prepared and added to all four tubes. However, due to a laboratory error, the dATP was completely omitted from this master mix, which therefore contains only dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP.\n\nAfter the reactions are run, the DNA fragments from each tube are separated by size on a polyacrylamide gel, with one lane for each of the four reactions. Which of the following statements best describes the expected result on the sequencing gel?\n\nA. A clear sequencing ladder is produced, allowing the sequence to be read up to the first position that requires the missing nucleotide, after which the gel is blank for any longer fragments.\n\nB. All four lanes show a single, intense band at the same position, corresponding to the sequence immediately preceding the first position that requires the missing nucleotide.\n\nC. No DNA fragments longer than the 6-nucleotide primer are synthesized, resulting in only a single band corresponding to the primer's length appearing in all four lanes.\n\nD. The lane corresponding to the reaction with ddATP is entirely blank, while the other three lanes appear to show a normal sequencing ladder.\n\nE. A random smear of DNA fragments appears in all four lanes because the polymerase cannot function correctly without all four dNTPs.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the outcome of a Sanger sequencing experiment where one of the standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), specifically dATP, is missing.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the site of primer binding and the sequence to be synthesized.**\nThe template strand has the sequence `3'-CGT ATG GCT AAG CAT-5'`.\nThe primer has the sequence `5'-GCA TAC-3'`.\nWe check for complementarity to find the binding site. The primer's complementary sequence is `3'-CGT ATG-5'`. This sequence is present at the 5' end of the template DNA.\n\nTemplate: `3'-CGT ATG GCT AAG CAT-5'`\nPrimer:   `5'-GCA TAC-3'`\n\nSynthesis by DNA polymerase proceeds from the 3' end of the primer, reading the template in its 3'-to-5' direction. The template sequence immediately following the primer binding site is `3'-GCT AAG CAT-5'`.\nThe polymerase will synthesize a new strand with the complementary sequence, which is `5'-CGA TTC GTA-3'`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the missing dATP on DNA synthesis.**\nThe reaction mix contains dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, but is missing dATP. The polymerase will add nucleotides one by one.\n- **Position 1 (opposite template 'G'):** The polymerase needs to add a Cytosine (C). `dCTP` is available in the mix. Synthesis can proceed. The fragment length becomes primer length + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- **Position 2 (opposite template 'C'):** The polymerase needs to add a Guanine (G). `dGTP` is available. Synthesis can proceed. The fragment length becomes 6 + 2 = 8.\n- **Position 3 (opposite template 'T'):** The polymerase needs to add an Adenine (A). The necessary building block, `dATP`, is missing from the reaction mix. Therefore, synthesis cannot proceed past position 2. Every DNA strand that successfully incorporates the `G` at position 2 will be permanently stalled.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the bands in each of the four sequencing lanes.**\nThe final gel shows bands corresponding to fragments whose synthesis was terminated. Termination can occur in two ways in this experiment: (1) incorporation of a ddNTP, or (2) stalling due to the lack of dATP.\n\n- **Lane 'C' (containing ddCTP):** At position 1, the polymerase adds a 'C'. Some fraction of the strands will incorporate the chain-terminating `ddCTP` instead of the standard `dCTP`. This will produce a population of fragments of length 7. These fragments will appear as a band in Lane 'C' at the position corresponding to 7 nucleotides. The strands that incorporate a normal `dCTP` will continue to the next step.\n\n- **Lane 'G' (containing ddGTP):** Strands that successfully passed position 1 will now be at position 2, where a 'G' is to be added. Some fraction will incorporate `ddGTP`, terminating synthesis and producing fragments of length 8. These will create a band in Lane 'G' at the position for 8 nucleotides.\n\n- **Lane 'T' (containing ddTTP) and Lane 'A' (containing ddATP):** In these lanes, synthesis proceeds normally through positions 1 and 2, as no 'T' or 'A' needs to be added. All strands that reach position 3 will stall because `dATP` is not available. This means no fragments longer than 8 nucleotides will be produced in any lane. No ddNTP-specific termination occurs at positions 1 or 2 in these lanes.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the overall pattern and choose the best description.**\nLet's assemble the pattern on the gel, reading from smaller fragments (bottom) to larger fragments (top):\n- At length 7, there is a band in Lane 'C'.\n- At length 8, there is a band in Lane 'G'.\n- There are no bands for any fragment length greater than 8 in any lane.\n\nThis pattern allows a researcher to correctly read the first two bases of the new sequence: 'C' (from the band at position 7 in the 'C' lane) and 'G' (from the band at position 8 in the 'G' lane). The sequencing ladder is thus clear for the sequence 'CG', but it abruptly stops there. Beyond this point, the gel is blank for longer fragments.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n- **A. A clear sequencing ladder is produced, allowing the sequence to be read up to the first position that requires the missing nucleotide, after which the gel is blank for any longer fragments.** This exactly matches our analysis. We can read 'CG', and then the ladder stops.\n- **B. All four lanes show a single, intense band at the same position...** This is incorrect. We expect a band at length 7 in Lane 'C' and a band at length 8 in Lane 'G'.\n- **C. No DNA fragments longer than the 6-nucleotide primer are synthesized...** This is incorrect. Synthesis proceeds for two nucleotides before stalling.\n- **D. The lane corresponding to the reaction with ddATP is entirely blank...** This is incorrect. This lane will contain stalled fragments of length 8 (and unextended primers). This option confuses the roles of dNTPs and ddNTPs.\n- **E. A random smear of DNA fragments appears...** This is incorrect. The stall is at a very specific, deterministic point.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1484088"}, {"introduction": "Once individual DNA fragments are sequenced, the next challenge is to piece them together.

This merges to A followed by E with the overlap collapsed: A + E gives ACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCG.\n- Read E ends with AAATTGCG, and read B begins with AAATTGCG, so E overlaps B on the length-$8$ suffix/prefix AAATTGCG.

This final practice explores how a powerful next-generation sequencing strategy, paired-end reading, provides the long-range information needed to solve these puzzles [@problem_id:1484098]. You will analyze how the fixed distance and orientation between paired reads allow researchers to confidently order and orient contigs across genomic gaps.", "problem": "A genome scientist is working on the assembly of a eukaryotic genome. After an initial assembly, two large contigs, named `Contig_1` and `Contig_2`, both over 50 kilobases in length, are identified as being adjacent. Further analysis reveals they are separated by a single copy of a known repetitive element that is exactly 350 bp long. To determine the correct order and relative orientation of these two contigs, the scientist uses data from a paired-end sequencing library. This library was prepared with a mean DNA fragment insert size of 700 bp, and the sequencing produces reads that are 150 bp long from each end of the fragment.\n\nThe mapping of the paired-end reads against the two contigs provides a crucial piece of evidence: a significant number of read pairs are found where one read of the pair maps uniquely to the final 600 bp of `Contig_1` and its mate maps uniquely to the initial 600 bp of `Contig_2`. The analysis of these spanning read pairs reveals a consistent pattern: the read mapping to `Contig_1` is a forward read, while the mate read mapping to `Contig_2` is a reverse read.\n\nBased on this evidence, which of the following four proposed scaffold structures represents the correct genomic arrangement? Note that `_rc` denotes the reverse complement of a contig.\n\nA. `Contig_1` -- (350 bp gap) -- `Contig_2`\n\nB. `Contig_1` -- (350 bp gap) -- `Contig_2_rc`\n\nC. `Contig_2` -- (350 bp gap) -- `Contig_1`\n\nD. `Contig_2` -- (350 bp gap) -- `Contig_1_rc`", "solution": "Define the library parameters and geometry. Let the mean fragment length (insert size) be $L=700$ bp, the read length be $r=150$ bp for each end, and the known inter-contig repeat gap be $g=350$ bp. For a standard paired-end library (not a mate-pair), the expected orientation upon mapping to the correct reference order is inward-facing: the left (upstream) read maps to the forward strand and the right (downstream) read maps to the reverse strand. The unsequenced inner distance between the aligned reads (from the end of the left read to the start of the right read along the reference) is\n$$\nL-2r=700-2\\times 150=400 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\n\nRelate the spanning geometry to the contig ends. Let the read mapping to the final 600 bp of Contig\\_1 be positioned such that its $3^{\\prime}$ end is $x$ bp upstream of the Contig\\_1 right end. Let its mate, mapping to the initial 600 bp of Contig\\_2, start $y$ bp downstream of the Contig\\_2 left end. If the contigs are in the correct left-to-right order across a gap $g$, then the inner distance between the read alignments equals\n$$\ng+x+y.\n$$\nEquating to the library expectation gives\n$$\ng+x+y=L-2r \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad x+y=(L-2r)-g=400-350=50,\n$$\nwhich is readily satisfied with $x,y\\geq 0$ and consistent with mappings within 600 bp of the contig ends. Thus the distance evidence supports adjacency separated by a 350 bp element.\n\nUse the observed read orientations to determine order and strand. The data show that, among the spanning pairs:\n- the read on Contig\\_1 is forward;\n- its mate on Contig\\_2 is reverse;\n- the Contig\\_1 alignments lie near the right end, and the Contig\\_2 alignments lie near the left end.\n\nFor a standard paired-end (FR) library aligned to the correct scaffold, the left read (upstream) must be forward and the right read (downstream) must be reverse. Therefore:\n- If Contig\\_1 is left of Contig\\_2 in the scaffold and both are in forward orientation, then a spanning pair has the forward read in the terminal region of Contig\\_1 and the reverse read in the initial region of Contig\\_2, exactly as observed. This is consistent.\n- If the order were reversed (Contig\\_2 left of Contig\\_1; options C or D), then a pair spanning from Contig\\_2 to Contig\\_1 would have the rightmost read on Contig\\_1 and thus should be reverse on Contig\\_1; however, the observation is forward on Contig\\_1. Hence C and D are inconsistent with the FR pattern.\n- To distinguish between Contig\\_2 forward (A) versus reverse-complemented (B), note that in an FR configuration across the junction, the right read must be reverse with respect to the scaffold reference. In option B the right contig is Contig\\_2\\_rc; a reverse-oriented mapping on Contig\\_2\\_rc corresponds to a forward-oriented mapping on the original Contig\\_2 sequence. The observed mapping on Contig\\_2 is reverse, so it would be forward relative to Contig\\_2\\_rc, contradicting the required FR pattern on the scaffold. Therefore B is inconsistent.\n\nThus only the scaffold Contig\\_1 -- (350 bp gap) -- Contig\\_2 (both in forward orientation) matches both the orientation and distance constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1484098"}]}
