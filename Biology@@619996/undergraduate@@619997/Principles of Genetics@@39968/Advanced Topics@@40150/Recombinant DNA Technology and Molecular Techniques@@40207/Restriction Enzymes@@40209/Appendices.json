The total size of the plasmid is determined to be 9 kilobase pairs (kb). To create a map of the plasmid, a series of restriction enzyme digestions are performed. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  Complete digestion with the restriction enzyme *Sac*I produces two DNA fragments with lengths of 6 kb and 3 kb.\n2.  Complete digestion with the restriction enzyme *Xho*I produces a single linear DNA fragment of 9 kb.\n3.  A double digestion with both *Sac*I and *Xho*I simultaneously produces three DNA fragments with lengths of 5 kb, 3 kb, and 1 kb.\n\nBased on these results, there must be two *Sac*I sites and one *Xho*I site on the plasmid.

This problem delves into the strategic subtleties of molecular cloning by introducing isoschizomers—enzymes that recognize the same sequence but cut it differently. You will determine the compatibility of blunt versus sticky ends for ligation, a crucial consideration that dictates success or failure in creating recombinant DNA [@problem_id:1518001].", "problem": "A molecular biology student is working on a cloning project to insert a gene of interest into a plasmid vector. The student has successfully isolated the gene and the plasmid DNA.\n\nTo excise the gene from its source DNA, the student used the restriction enzyme **SmaI**.\nTo linearize the plasmid vector at the cloning site, the student used the restriction enzyme **XmaI**.\n\nThese two enzymes are isoschizomers, meaning they recognize the same 6-base pair sequence, 5'-CCCGGG-3'. However, they cut the DNA in different ways:\n- **SmaI** creates blunt ends: 5'-CCC|GGG-3'\n- **XmaI** creates sticky ends: 5'-C|CCGGG-3', resulting in a 4-base 5' overhang.\n\nThe student then proceeds with a ligation reaction, intending to insert the SmaI-digested gene fragment into the XmaI-digested vector. The protocol involves using *DNA ligase* and any necessary auxiliary enzymes (like *DNA polymerase*) to make the DNA ends compatible for joining.\n\nAssuming the ligation reaction is successful, which of the following statements accurately describes the newly formed DNA sequence at the junctions where the gene was inserted into the vector?\n\nA. Ligation is impossible because the ends are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nB. Ligation is possible, and the resulting hybrid sites can be cut by both SmaI and XmaI.\n\nC.

Ligation is possible, but the resulting hybrid sites can be cut by neither SmaI nor XmaI.", "solution": "Both *Sma*I and *Xma*I recognize the same palindromic hexamer 5'-CCCGGG-3', but they cleave differently. By definition of isoschizomers, their recognition sequence is identical, while their cleavage pattern may differ. *Sma*I cleaves to produce blunt ends at 5'-CCC|GGG-3'. *Xma*I cleaves to produce 5' cohesive ends; as given, the cut is 5'-C|CCGGG-3' and yields a 4-nucleotide 5' overhang that corresponds to the top-strand sequence CCGG.\n\nA blunt-ended *Sma*I insert cannot directly ligate to an *Xma*I-generated sticky end because *DNA ligase* requires either cohesive base-pairing to juxtapose the 3'-OH and 5'-phosphate termini or a flush blunt-blunt interface; a sticky-blunt junction without processing lacks base pairing and thus is not a substrate for ligation. Therefore, to achieve ligation, the *Xma*I 5' overhangs must be made blunt, which can be done in two standard ways consistent with the protocol’s allowance for auxiliary enzymes:\n- Fill-in synthesis: a *DNA polymerase* with 5' to 3' polymerase activity extends the recessed 3' ends using the 5' overhang as a template, converting the 4-nucleotide 5' overhang (CCGG) into a flush blunt end.\n- Chew-back: an enzyme with single-strand nuclease or 3' to 5' exonuclease activity removes the 5' overhang, again yielding a blunt end.\n\nAfter either end-polishing method, the vector ends are blunt and can be ligated to the blunt *Sma*I insert using *DNA ligase*. However, in both cases the sequence at the junction is altered such that the original uninterrupted 5'-CCCGGG-3' recognition site is not reconstituted across the ligation boundary:\n- With fill-in, four nucleotides complementary to the 5' overhang are newly synthesized at the vector end, so the ligation junction splits and extends the original site; the palindromic hexamer is no longer present as a continuous unit across the junction.\n- With chew-back, part of the recognition sequence is removed from the vector end, so the palindromic site is truncated and cannot be present at the junction.\n\nBecause both *Sma*I and *Xma*I require the intact, continuous 5'-CCCGGG-3' sequence on both strands to bind and cleave, and because the ligation junction is a hybrid that lacks this uninterrupted site, neither enzyme can cleave at the newly formed junctions. Therefore, ligation is possible after end polishing, but the hybrid sites are not cut by *Sma*I or *Xma*I.\n\nThe correct choice is that ligation is possible, but the resulting hybrid sites can be cut by neither enzyme.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1518001"}]}
