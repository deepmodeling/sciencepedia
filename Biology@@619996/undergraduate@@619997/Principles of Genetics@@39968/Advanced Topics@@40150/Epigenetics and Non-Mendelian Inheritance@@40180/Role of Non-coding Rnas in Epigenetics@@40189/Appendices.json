{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "X-chromosome inactivation is a paradigmatic example of large-scale epigenetic silencing orchestrated by a long non-coding RNA. The process is remarkably precise, ensuring that in cells with multiple X chromosomes, all but one are silenced to achieve dosage compensation. This exercise [@problem_id:1519177] challenges you to look beyond the simple rule for counting Barr bodies ($N - 1$) and focus on the indispensable molecular initiator of this process: the *XIST* non-coding RNA. By considering a scenario where this key player is absent, you can solidify your understanding of its causal role in establishing the silent state.", "problem": "In mammalian females, dosage compensation for X-linked genes is achieved through a process called X-chromosome inactivation. This epigenetic process involves the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in each somatic cell, leading to its condensation into a compact structure known as a Barr body. The initiation of this inactivation is critically dependent on the expression of the X-inactive specific transcript (*XIST*) gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The *XIST* gene produces a long non-coding RNA that coats the chromosome from which it is transcribed, triggering its silencing and compaction.\n\nConsider a hypothetical, viable human cell line that has been engineered to have a 47,XXX karyotype (i.e., three X chromosomes). In this specific cell line, a mutation has been introduced that renders the *XIST* gene completely non-functional on all three of the X chromosomes. Based on your understanding of the mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation, determine the number of Barr bodies you would expect to observe in a typical somatic cell from this cell line.", "solution": "We proceed from first principles of X-chromosome inactivation and Barr body formation.\n\n1. Definition of a Barr body: A Barr body is the cytologically visible condensed form of an inactivated X chromosome in somatic cells. Therefore, the number of Barr bodies equals the number of inactivated X chromosomes. Symbolically, let $N_{X}$ be the number of X chromosomes and $N_{\\text{inactive}}$ the number of inactivated X chromosomes; then the number of Barr bodies is\n$$\nN_{\\text{Barr}} = N_{\\text{inactive}}.\n$$\n\n2. Mechanism of inactivation: In mammalian females, X-chromosome inactivation is initiated by expression of the $XIST$ gene from the X chromosome that will become inactive. The $XIST$ RNA coats the chromosome in cis, triggering its heterochromatinization and silencing. Hence, functional $XIST$ expression on a chromosome is necessary for initiating its inactivation and Barr body formation.\n\n3. Usual rule and its assumption: In typical karyotypes with intact $XIST$, one X remains active and all supernumerary X chromosomes are inactivated, leading to the empirical rule $N_{\\text{Barr}} = N_{X} - 1$. For a 47,XXX cell with functional $XIST$, this would yield $N_{\\text{Barr}} = 3 - 1 = 2$. However, this rule presumes that $XIST$ is functional on at least the chromosomes that become inactive.\n\n4. Impact of non-functional $XIST$ on all X chromosomes: In the given engineered 47,XXX cell line, $XIST$ is completely non-functional on all three X chromosomes. Without functional $XIST$, initiation of X inactivation cannot occur on any X chromosome. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{\\text{inactive}} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N_{\\text{Barr}} = 0.\n$$\n\n5. Conclusion under the stated viability assumption: Although such a cell would ordinarily face severe dosage imbalance, the problem stipulates a viable cell line; the mechanistic consequence regarding Barr bodies remains that none can form without $XIST$-mediated initiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1519177"}, {"introduction": "The \"scaffold\" or \"guide\" function of the *XIST* RNA is not unique; it represents a general mechanism employed by many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to regulate gene expression. These lncRNAs act as molecular platforms, recruiting protein complexes with specific enzymatic activities to target locations in the genome. This problem [@problem_id:1519130] asks you to apply this principle to predict the direct epigenetic consequence of disrupting such a lncRNA-protein interaction, reinforcing the link between a specific lncRNA, a recruited \"writer\" enzyme, and the resulting repressive histone mark.", "problem": "In a particular line of mammalian cells, the expression of a gene encoding a potent tumor suppressor protein is tightly regulated. This regulation is mediated by a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which we will call `ChronoSilencer`. The `ChronoSilencer` RNA transcript specifically binds to the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene. This binding event serves as a scaffold, facilitating the recruitment of a histone methyltransferase (HMT) enzyme complex. The action of this recruited HMT complex results in the stable transcriptional repression of the tumor suppressor gene.\n\nA team of geneticists engineers a new cell line by using CRISPR-Cas9 to create a complete deletion of the gene that codes for the `ChronoSilencer` lncRNA. They then compare the epigenetic landscape at the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene in these knockout cells with that of the original, unmodified cells.\n\nWhich of the following epigenetic marks would you most likely expect to be significantly decreased or absent at the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene specifically in the `ChronoSilencer` knockout cell line?\n\nA. H3K27me3 (trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3)\n\nB. H3K4me3 (trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3)\n\nC. H3K9ac (acetylation of lysine 9 on histone H3)\n\nD. DNA methylation at CpG islands\n\nE. H4K20me1 (monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4)", "solution": "- The problem states that the lncRNA ChronoSilencer binds to the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene and acts as a scaffold to recruit a histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex. The result of this recruitment is stable transcriptional repression of the gene.\n- Histone methyltransferases catalyze the addition of methyl groups to specific lysine residues on histone tails. Different methylation marks have distinct functional consequences for chromatin state:\n  - H3K27me3 is a well-established repressive mark deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), whose catalytic subunit (e.g., EZH2) is an HMT. This mark is classically associated with stable, facultative heterochromatin and promoter repression.\n  - H3K4me3 is an active promoter mark linked to transcription initiation and is deposited by SET1/COMPASS-like HMTs; it correlates with gene activation, not repression.\n  - H3K9ac is an acetylation mark associated with open chromatin and active transcription; it is not a methylation mark and is not deposited by HMTs.\n  - DNA methylation at CpG islands is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, not HMTs; while it is repressive, it is not the direct product of the recruited HMT complex described.\n  - H4K20me1 is often associated with chromatin compaction and cell cycle regulation, with H4K20me3 more strongly linked to constitutive heterochromatin; moreover, promoter-centric stable silencing via lncRNA scaffolding is most canonically linked to H3K27me3 rather than H4K20me1.\n- Therefore, in cells lacking ChronoSilencer, the recruitment of the HMT complex to the promoter would be lost, and the specific repressive histone methylation mark it deposits would be significantly decreased or absent.\n- Among the listed options, the repressive methylation mark most classically deposited by an HMT complex recruited by lncRNAs to mediate stable promoter repression is H3K27me3.\n- Consequently, the expected decrease or absence at the promoter in the ChronoSilencer knockout is H3K27me3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1519130"}, {"introduction": "Our focus now shifts from establishing epigenetic marks to the critical process of maintaining them, and from lncRNAs to another class of non-coding RNAs: small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Epigenetic patterns, like DNA methylation, must be faithfully inherited through cell division, a task performed by \"maintenance\" enzymes. This practice problem [@problem_id:1519188] utilizes a common and powerful laboratory technique, RNA interference (RNAi), to explore the system-wide consequences of disrupting the maintenance of the DNA methylome. It provides a practical look at how these small RNAs can be used as tools to dissect epigenetic pathways.", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a researcher is investigating epigenetic inheritance in a line of actively dividing human cancer cells. The experiment involves the use of RNA interference (RNAi), a cellular mechanism for gene silencing. The researcher introduces a high concentration of a synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the cell culture. This siRNA is specifically designed to be perfectly complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of the gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). DNMT1 is the primary enzyme responsible for maintaining existing DNA methylation patterns following DNA replication. Assuming the siRNA is successfully delivered and functional within the cells, what is the most likely and immediate consequence for the genome of the daughter cells produced after several rounds of cell division?\n\nA. A progressive and widespread loss of DNA methylation across the genome (global hypomethylation).\n\nB. A progressive and widespread increase in DNA methylation across the genome (global hypermethylation).\n\nC. Targeted methylation and silencing of the DNMT1 gene itself, with no effect on the rest of the genome.\n\nD. A significant increase in histone acetylation, leading to more open chromatin structure, but no change in DNA methylation.\n\nE. The specific degradation of all methylated DNA sequences, leading to chromosome fragmentation.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the effect of inhibiting the production of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) enzyme in actively dividing cells using a small interfering RNA (siRNA).\n\nStep 1: Understand the function of each component.\n- **DNA methylation:** This is an epigenetic mark where a methyl group is added to a DNA molecule, typically at a CpG dinucleotide. High levels of methylation in a gene's promoter region are generally associated with transcriptional repression or gene silencing.\n- **DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1):** This enzyme is known as a \"maintenance\" methyltransferase. During DNA replication, the original parent DNA strand retains its methylation pattern, while the newly synthesized daughter strand is initially unmethylated. The resulting DNA duplex is \"hemi-methylated\". The primary role of DNMT1 is to recognize these hemi-methylated sites and add a methyl group to the corresponding cytosine on the new strand. This process ensures that the epigenetic methylation pattern is faithfully copied and passed on to daughter cells during cell division.\n- **small interfering RNA (siRNA):** This is a short, double-stranded RNA molecule that functions within the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. When introduced into a cell, an siRNA is incorporated into the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). The RISC then uses the siRNA strand as a guide to find and bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that have a complementary sequence. Upon binding, the RISC cleaves the target mRNA, leading to its degradation.\n\nStep 2: Trace the molecular pathway initiated by the experiment.\n1.  The synthetic siRNA, designed to be complementary to `DNMT1` mRNA, is introduced into the cells.\n2.  The cell's RISC complex utilizes this siRNA to target the `DNMT1` mRNA transcripts.\n3.  The targeted `DNMT1` mRNA is cleaved and degraded.\n4.  Since the mRNA template for the DNMT1 protein is being destroyed, the translation of new DNMT1 protein at the ribosomes is severely inhibited. This leads to a significant decrease in the cellular concentration of the DNMT1 enzyme.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the consequence of DNMT1 depletion in dividing cells.\n1.  The cells in the culture are actively dividing, which means their DNA is continuously undergoing replication.\n2.  After each replication cycle, the cell contains newly formed hemi-methylated DNA.\n3.  In a normal cell, DNMT1 would methylate the new strands to maintain the original methylation pattern.\n4.  However, in the experimental cells, the concentration of DNMT1 is low. The maintenance methylation process is therefore inefficient or fails to occur.\n5.  As a result, with each subsequent round of cell division, the original methylation marks are diluted. The newly formed daughter cells inherit DNA that has progressively fewer methylated sites than the parent cell. This is often called \"passive demethylation.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options based on this conclusion.\n-   **A. A progressive and widespread loss of DNA methylation across the genome (global hypomethylation).** This matches our conclusion. The failure of the maintenance function of DNMT1 leads to a genome-wide reduction in methylation levels over successive cell divisions.\n-   **B. A progressive and widespread increase in DNA methylation across the genome (global hypermethylation).** This is incorrect. Depleting the enzyme responsible for *adding* methyl groups cannot lead to an *increase* in methylation.\n-   **C. Targeted methylation and silencing of the `DNMT1` gene itself, with no effect on the rest of the genome.** This is incorrect. The siRNA targets the `DNMT1` mRNA in the cytoplasm for degradation. It does not directly affect the `DNMT1` gene's DNA in the nucleus or its methylation state. The effect is on the protein level, which then affects the entire genome.\n-   **D. A significant increase in histone acetylation, leading to more open chromatin structure, but no change in DNA methylation.** This is incorrect. While DNA methylation and histone modifications are often linked, the direct and primary effect of depleting DNMT1 is on DNA methylation patterns. A change in histone acetylation would be a secondary, indirect effect, not the primary consequence. The statement that there would be \"no change in DNA methylation\" is definitively false.\n-   **E. The specific degradation of all methylated DNA sequences, leading to chromosome fragmentation.** This is incorrect. The RNAi machinery targets RNA, not DNA. Furthermore, the loss of methylation does not cause the DNA molecule itself to be degraded.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate prediction is a global loss of DNA methylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1519188"}]}
