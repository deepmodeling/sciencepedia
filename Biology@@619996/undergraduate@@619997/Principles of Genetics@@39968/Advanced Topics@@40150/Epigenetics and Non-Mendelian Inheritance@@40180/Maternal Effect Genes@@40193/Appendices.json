In maternal effect inheritance, the phenotype of an organism is determined not by its own genotype, but by the genotype of its mother.\n\nA geneticist performs a cross between a female from a true-breeding clockwise-coiling strain and a male from a true-breeding counter-clockwise-coiling strain.

This problem presents a classic case where an individual's phenotype directly contradicts its own genotype, a situation that is impossible under standard Mendelian rules.

[@problem_id:1501926]", "problem": "In the freshwater snail *Lymnaea peregra*, the direction of shell coiling is determined by a maternal effect gene. The allele for dextral (right-handed) coiling, denoted by $D$, is dominant to the allele for sinistral (left-handed) coiling, denoted by $d$. The phenotype of any individual snail is not determined by its own genotype but is instead exclusively dictated by the genotype of its mother (the egg-producing parent).\n\nA geneticist isolates a single, self-fertilizing hermaphroditic snail that has a dextral-coiled shell. This snail is allowed to self-fertilize, and it subsequently produces a large brood of offspring. Upon examining the offspring, the geneticist finds that all of them exhibit sinistral-coiled shells.\n\nBased on these observations, what are the respective genotypes of the original parent snail and its entire brood of offspring?\n\nA.

Here, $D$ (dextral) is dominant to $d$ (sinistral), so a mother with genotype $D/D$ or $D/d$ produces dextral offspring, whereas a mother with genotype $d/d$ produces sinistral offspring.\n\nObservation: the self-fertilizing parent has a dextral shell but produces a large brood in which all offspring are sinistral. Because the offspring phenotype is set by the mother’s genotype, the fact that all offspring are sinistral implies that the mother’s genotype must be $d/d$. If the mother carried any $D$ allele (i.e., were $D/D$ or $D/d$), all offspring would be dextral, which contradicts the observation.\n\nConsistency with the parent’s phenotype: the parent being dextral despite having genotype $d/d$ is entirely consistent with a maternal-effect gene, because the parent’s phenotype is determined by its own mother’s genotype. Thus, the parent could be $d/d$ in genotype but dextral in phenotype if its mother had at least one $D$ allele (i.e., was $D/D$ or $D/d$).\n\nPredicted offspring genotypes under selfing: a $d/d$ hermaphrodite produces only $d$ gametes, so all selfed offspring are $d/d$. This matches the complete sinistral phenotype observed (since their mother is $d/d$).\n\nTherefore, the original parent’s genotype is $d/d$, and all offspring are $d/d$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1501926"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand maternal effects, we must look beyond abstract genetic crosses to the molecular mechanisms at play. This thought experiment explores the role of gene products, like mRNA, that the mother deposits into the egg.

[@problem_id:1501972]", "problem": "In a species of hypothetical aquatic crustacean, the formation of the larval carapace (the protective outer shell) is governed by a maternal effect gene known as *carapax*. The wild-type allele, $C$, is dominant and results in a normal, hardened carapace. The recessive allele, $c$, results in a soft, non-protective carapace, which is ultimately lethal to the larva. The phenotype of the larva is determined solely by the gene products (mRNA and proteins) deposited by the mother into the egg during oogenesis; the larva's own genotype does not influence its carapace phenotype.\n\nA female crustacean with genotype $cc$ is mated with a male of genotype $CC$. An egg laid by this female is immediately isolated. Before fertilization can occur with sperm from the $CC$ male, a geneticist injects a purified solution of functional mRNA transcribed from the wild-type $C$ allele directly into the egg's cytoplasm.

Let the maternal genotype be $G_{m}$ and the larval (zygotic) genotype be $G_{z}$. For the gene $carapax$, the wild-type allele $C$ produces a functional mRNA and protein that confer a hardened carapace, and the recessive allele $c$ does not produce functional product, yielding a soft, lethal carapace.\n\nDefine $m_{C}$ as the amount of functional $C$-derived mRNA present in the egg cytoplasm at the time when the phenotype is specified, and $P_{C}$ as the corresponding functional protein translated from $m_{C}$. The phenotype can be represented by a threshold model:\n$$\n\\text{Hardened carapace} \\iff [P_{C}] \\ge \\theta, \\quad \\text{Soft carapace} \\iff [P_{C}] < \\theta,\n$$\nfor some threshold $\\theta$ required for normal development. Because the trait is maternal-effect, the relevant $[P_{C}]$ arises from maternal deposition into the egg, not from zygotic expression.\n\nIn the unmanipulated case with $G_{m} = cc$, the mother deposits no functional $C$-product into the egg, so $m_{C} = 0$ and hence $[P_{C}] = 0 < \\theta$, yielding a soft, lethal carapace.\n\nIn the experiment, before fertilization, the egg (from a $cc$ mother) is directly injected with functional mRNA transcribed from the wild-type $C$ allele. This changes the egg’s initial condition to $m_{C} > 0$. Translation in the egg produces functional protein $P_{C}$, so that\n$$\nm_{C} > 0 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; [P_{C}] > 0.\n$$\nGiven dominance of $C$ and the maternal-effect nature, the presence of sufficient $P_{C}$ to exceed $\\theta$ yields the hardened phenotype. The problem states a direct injection of functional $C$ mRNA explicitly intended to supply the missing maternal product, and there is no indication that the manipulation is lethal. Therefore, it is standard to infer that the injection provides enough functional product to meet or exceed $\\theta$, leading to a normal, hardened carapace.\n\nAfter injection, the egg is fertilized by sperm from a $CC$ male; the zygote will be $G_{z} = Cc$. However, by the problem’s premise, the larva’s own genotype does not influence its carapace phenotype; only the maternal (or experimentally supplied) products present in the egg matter for this trait. Thus, the injection rescues the phenotype to normal.\n\nTherefore, the resulting larva will have a normal, hardened carapace.\n\nNo inconsistencies or mistakes in the problem statement affect this conclusion.\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1501972"}]}
