To appreciate the efficiency of this process, we can begin by quantifying the very first level of chromatin organization. This exercise [@problem_id:1475361] invites you to calculate the DNA compaction ratio, providing a tangible metric for how effectively DNA is condensed from its linear form into the fundamental 'beads-on-a-string' fiber.", "problem": "In the eukaryotic nucleus, the immense length of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is systematically compacted to fit within a small volume. The primary level of this organization is the formation of the \"beads-on-a-string\" structure, where DNA wraps around histone protein complexes to form nucleosomes.\n\nConsider a typical segment of this structure. The DNA is in its B-form, which has a length of 0.34 nanometers (nm) for every base pair (bp). Each repeating unit in the chromatin fiber consists of a nucleosome core particle and an adjacent stretch of linker DNA. The DNA wrapped around a single nucleosome core particle is 147 bp long. The stretch of linker DNA that connects this nucleosome to the next one is 53 bp long. The nucleosome core particle itself can be modeled as a cylindrical disc with a diameter of 11.0 nm. When these nucleosomes pack together to form the 10-nm fiber, the length contributed by each repeating unit along the fiber's axis is approximately equal to the diameter of one nucleosome core particle.\n\nCalculate the DNA compaction ratio for this first level of organization. The compaction ratio is defined as the total length of the extended B-form DNA divided by the length of the resulting chromatin fiber. Express your final answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The compaction ratio is defined as the extended B-form DNA length per repeating unit divided by the axial length contributed by that unit in the chromatin fiber.\n\nEach repeating unit contains $147$ bp wrapped on the nucleosome plus $53$ bp of linker DNA, for a total of\n$$\nN_{\\text{bp}}=147+53=200 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\nB-form DNA has a contour length of $0.34 \\text{ nm}$ per base pair, so the extended DNA length per repeating unit is\n$$\nL_{\\text{DNA}}=N_{\\text{bp}}\\times 0.34 \\text{ nm/bp}=200\\times 0.34 \\text{ nm}=68 \\text{ nm}.\n$$\nThe axial length contributed by one repeating unit in the 10-nm fiber is approximately the nucleosome core diameter,\n$$\nL_{\\text{fiber}}=11.0 \\text{ nm}.\n$$\nThus, the compaction ratio is\n$$\n\\text{Compaction ratio}=\\frac{L_{\\text{DNA}}}{L_{\\text{fiber}}}=\\frac{68}{11.0}=6.1818\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $6.18$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.18}$$", "id": "1475361"}, {"introduction": "Chromatin's structure is not static; it is a dynamic landscape that is constantly reshaped to regulate gene access. A key mechanism involves the chemical modification of histone proteins, which function as a complex system of switches for gene activity. In this conceptual practice [@problem_id:1475342], you will explore the consequences of inhibiting histone deacetylation, a process that directly links the electrostatic interactions between proteins and DNA to chromatin's physical state and its potential for transcription.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in a eukaryotic cell line. The DNA in these cells is tightly packaged around proteins called histones, forming a complex called chromatin. The N-terminal tails of histone proteins are subject to various post-translational modifications that influence chromatin structure and gene activity. One such modification is the acetylation of lysine residues. Lysine is an amino acid with a positively charged side chain under physiological conditions. The addition of an acetyl group to lysine is catalyzed by enzymes called Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs), while the removal of acetyl groups is performed by Histone Deacetylases (HDACs).\n\nThe researcher decides to treat the cells with Trichostatin A, a well-known and potent inhibitor of HDAC enzyme activity. Assuming that the cellular HATs continue to function normally, what is the most likely immediate effect of this treatment on the chromatin state and its availability for gene transcription?\n\nA. The chromatin will become more condensed because the inhibitor helps histones bind more tightly to the negatively charged DNA, decreasing accessibility for transcription factors.\n\nB. There will be no change in DNA accessibility, as HDAC inhibitors primarily affect the process of DNA replication, not transcription.\n\nC. The overall positive charge of the histone tails will increase, leading to a more compact heterochromatin structure that physically blocks transcription factors.\n\nD. The histone tails will accumulate acetyl groups, reducing their net positive charge and leading to a more relaxed chromatin structure that is more accessible to transcription factors.\n\nE. The inhibitor will cause widespread de-methylation of the DNA, which is a competitive process to histone acetylation, resulting in decreased accessibility for transcription factors.", "solution": "Trichostatin A (TSA) is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs remove acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone N-terminal tails, while histone acetyltransferases (HATs) add acetyl groups. With HAT activity maintained and HDAC activity inhibited, the balance of modification shifts toward increased acetylation.\n\nLet $A(t)$ denote the extent of histone acetylation at time $t$. A simple kinetic description is\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{\\text{HAT}} - k_{\\text{HDAC}} A,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{HAT}}$ is the effective acetylation rate and $k_{\\text{HDAC}}$ is the effective deacetylation rate constant. Under TSA treatment, $k_{\\text{HDAC}} \\approx 0$, so\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} \\approx k_{\\text{HAT}} > 0,\n$$\nimplying a net accumulation of acetyl groups on histone tails.\n\nLysine side chains on histone tails are normally protonated and positively charged under physiological conditions. Acetylation converts the $\\epsilon$-amino group to a neutral amide, decreasing the net positive charge on histone tails. The DNA backbone is negatively charged due to phosphate groups. The electrostatic interaction energy between charges satisfies\n$$\nU \\propto q_{\\text{histone}} \\, q_{\\text{DNA}}.\n$$\nReducing $q_{\\text{histone}}$ (the positive charge on histone tails) lowers the magnitude of attractive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA, weakening histone-DNA binding and loosening nucleosome packing. This yields a more relaxed, open chromatin (euchromatin) conformation, which increases accessibility to transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery, leading to enhanced transcriptional potential as an immediate effect.\n\nEliminating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because increased acetylation reduces, rather than strengthens, histone-DNA interactions; chromatin becomes less condensed, not more.\n- Option B is incorrect because HDAC inhibitors directly affect chromatin acetylation status and thus transcriptional accessibility; they do not primarily target DNA replication.\n- Option C is incorrect because acetylation decreases, not increases, the positive charge of histone tails.\n- Option E is incorrect because TSA does not cause DNA demethylation; DNA methylation is regulated by distinct enzymes and is not a competitive process with histone acetylation in the manner described.\n\nTherefore, the immediate effect is accumulation of acetyl groups on histone tails, reduced net positive charge, relaxed chromatin, and increased accessibility for transcription factors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1475342"}, {"introduction": "Modern genomics allows scientists to 'read' the functional state of the genome by interpreting patterns of histone modifications, often referred to as the histone code. Different patterns, or 'marks,' act as signposts that distinguish different types of regulatory elements, such as active promoters and enhancers.

To determine where GREAP1 binds in the genome of human liver cells and to infer the function of these binding sites, they perform a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment. After identifying several thousand high-confidence GREAP1 binding sites, they analyze the co-occurrence of specific histone modifications at these locations using publicly available ChIP-seq data for the same cell type. Their analysis reveals a strong, statistically significant enrichment for monomethylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1) and a concurrent, significant depletion of trimethylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) precisely at the center of the GREAP1 binding sites.\n\nBased on this specific combination of histone mark enrichment and depletion, what is the most likely class of cis-regulatory element to which GREAP1 is binding?\n\nA. Active promoters\n\nB. Constitutive heterochromatin\n\nC. Transcriptional silencers\n\nD. Enhancers\n\nE. Telomeric regions", "solution": "We use the principle that distinct histone modification patterns mark different classes of cis-regulatory elements.\n1) Promoters, especially active promoters at transcription start sites, are characterized by a strong peak of H3K4me3 and comparatively less H3K4me1 at the center of the TSS.\n2) Enhancers, particularly distal enhancers, are characterized by enrichment of H3K4me1 and relative depletion of H3K4me3 at the enhancer center; active enhancers often also show H3K27ac, but the defining distinction from promoters is H3K4me1 high and H3K4me3 low at the site.\n3) Constitutive heterochromatin is typically marked by H3K9me3 (and H4K20me3), not by H3K4 methylation.\n4) Transcriptional silencers are commonly associated with repressive marks such as H3K27me3 rather than H3K4me1 enrichment.\n5) Telomeric regions are enriched for heterochromatic features (e.g., H3K9me3) and lack the enhancer-like H3K4me1 signature.\n\nGiven the reported pattern—significant enrichment of H3K4me1 and concurrent depletion of H3K4me3 precisely at GREAP1 binding centers—this matches the canonical enhancer signature and argues against promoters (which would show the opposite H3K4me3 peak), heterochromatin, silencers, or telomeric regions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely class is enhancers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1475355"}]}
