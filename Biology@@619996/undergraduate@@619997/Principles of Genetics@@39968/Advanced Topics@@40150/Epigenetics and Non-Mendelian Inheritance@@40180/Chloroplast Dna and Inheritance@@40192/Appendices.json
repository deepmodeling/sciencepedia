The fundamental technique of a reciprocal cross is the key to distinguishing between maternal, paternal, and biparental inheritance of organelles. By using molecular markers—in this hypothetical case, easily distinguishable DNA fragment sizes—you can deduce the inheritance pattern with clarity, a method central to modern genetic analysis. [@problem_id:1474527]", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating the inheritance of chloroplasts in a newly discovered plant species, *Ficticia undulata*. They identify two distinct populations, P1 and P2, which are morphologically identical but have a detectable polymorphism in a non-coding region of their chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). Using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify this region, the geneticist finds that all plants from population P1 yield a DNA fragment of 350 base pairs (bp), while all plants from population P2 yield a fragment of 500 bp.\n\nTo determine the mode of inheritance, the geneticist performs two reciprocal crosses:\n\n1.  **Cross A**: A plant from population P1 was used as the female (ovule donor) and was crossed with a plant from population P2, which was used as the male (pollen donor).\n2.  **Cross B**: A plant from population P2 was used as the female and was crossed with a plant from population P1, which was used as the male.\n\nThe F1 progeny from both crosses were grown, and their cpDNA was analyzed using the same PCR method. The results were as follows:\n\n-   All F1 progeny from Cross A showed only the 350 bp DNA fragment.\n-   All F1 progeny from Cross B showed only the 500 bp DNA fragment.\n\nBased solely on these experimental results, what is the mode of inheritance for chloroplasts in *Ficticia undulata*?\n\nA. Paternal inheritance, where chloroplasts are inherited exclusively from the male parent.\n\nB. Biparental inheritance, where chloroplasts from both parents are contributed to the offspring.\n\nC. Maternal inheritance, where chloroplasts are inherited exclusively from the female parent.\n\nD. Mendelian inheritance, where the 350 bp allele is dominant to the 500 bp allele.\n\nE. The inheritance pattern is random and cannot be determined from the given data.", "solution": "We formalize the cpDNA marker state as a maternally informative, non-recombining cytoplasmic polymorphism whose PCR amplicon length reflects the chloroplast genotype: population P1 has a fragment of length $350$ bp, and population P2 has a fragment of length $500$ bp. In reciprocal crosses, the diagnostic pattern of cytoplasmic inheritance is inferred by whether the F1 progeny carry the cpDNA type of the female or the male parent, or both.\n\nConsider the predictions under different inheritance modes:\n- Maternal inheritance: all F1 inherit chloroplasts exclusively from the female parent; hence the F1 fragment length equals the female parent’s fragment length in each reciprocal cross.\n- Paternal inheritance: all F1 inherit chloroplasts exclusively from the male parent; hence the F1 fragment length equals the male parent’s fragment length in each reciprocal cross.\n- Biparental inheritance: both parental chloroplasts are transmitted; in F1 one would expect either detection of both $350$ and $500$ bp bands (heteroplasmy) or a variable mixture among offspring due to segregation/drift, not a uniform single band matching only one parent across all F1 in both crosses.\n- Mendelian (nuclear) inheritance with dominance: reciprocal crosses would yield the same F1 genotype distributions if nuclear, and a single-band outcome cannot be explained by nuclear dominance because the cpDNA band length is not encoded by a nuclear locus; furthermore, the reciprocal crosses give different F1 outcomes, implicating cytoplasmic (non-Mendelian) inheritance.\n\nNow compare the observations:\n- Cross A (P1 female, P2 male) yields F1 with only the $350$ bp band, which matches the female parent (P1).\n- Cross B (P2 female, P1 male) yields F1 with only the $500$ bp band, which matches the female parent (P2).\n\nThese results match exactly the prediction for maternal inheritance and contradict paternal inheritance (which would have produced the male parent’s band in each cross), biparental inheritance (which would have produced both bands or variable mixtures), and Mendelian nuclear dominance (which would not depend on the direction of the cross and does not apply to an organellar marker). Therefore, the mode of inheritance for chloroplasts in this species is maternal inheritance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1474527"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to identify maternal inheritance, we now explore one of its most classic phenotypic consequences: variegation. This exercise uses the four-o'clock plant, *Mirabilis jalapa*, to illustrate how a single parent plant with mixed chloroplast types (a state called heteroplasmy) can produce offspring with three different phenotypes. This practice is crucial for understanding the concept of somatic segregation, where random partitioning of organelles during cell division creates diverse outcomes from a single genetic source. [@problem_id:1474502]", "problem": "In the four-o'clock plant, *Mirabilis jalapa*, leaf color variegation is a well-known phenomenon. This trait is controlled by the type of plastids present in the cytoplasm of the cells. There are two types of plastids: normal chloroplasts, which are green and photosynthetically active, and mutant plastids, which are white and non-photosynthetic. The phenotype of any given plant tissue is determined by the plastids it contains. This trait exhibits a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern where the plastids are inherited exclusively through the cytoplasm of the egg cell; the pollen contributes no plastids to the zygote.\n\nConsider a flower that develops on a variegated branch, which contains a mix of green and white tissue. This flower is self-pollinated to produce seeds. Assuming the random segregation of plastids during the formation of the egg cells, which of the following choices best describes the phenotypes expected among the offspring that grow from these seeds?\n\nA. Offspring that are entirely green, offspring that are entirely white, and offspring that are variegated.\n\nB. Offspring displaying a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of green to variegated.\n\nC. Only variegated offspring, as this trait is passed on directly from the parent branch.\n\nD. A mix of green and white offspring, with the phenotype determined by the plastids contributed by the pollen.\n\nE. Only green offspring, as the white plastids represent a non-heritable somatic mutation.", "solution": "Principle: In Mirabilis jalapa, plastids are inherited cytoplasmically and maternally: the egg provides the plastids to the zygote, while pollen contributes no plastids. Therefore, the offspring phenotype depends solely on the plastid composition of the egg cell from which the zygote forms.\n\nStarting condition: A flower on a variegated branch has tissues containing a mixture of green (functional chloroplast) and white (mutant, non-photosynthetic) plastids. During ovule and egg formation, plastids segregate randomly among daughter cells.\n\nConsequence of random segregation: The eggs can become:\n- Homoplasmic green (only green plastids),\n- Homoplasmic white (only white plastids),\n- Heteroplasmic (a mixture of green and white plastids).\n\nFertilization effect: Because pollen contributes no plastids, self-pollination does not alter the plastid composition of the zygote. Thus:\n- A homoplasmic green egg yields an entirely green offspring.\n- A homoplasmic white egg yields an entirely white offspring (typically non-viable long-term but phenotypically white).\n- A heteroplasmic egg yields a variegated offspring due to sorting-out and differential proliferation of plastids during development.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the three possible maternal plastid states (green, white, variegated).\n- B invokes a Mendelian 3:1 ratio, which does not apply to cytoplasmic inheritance.\n- C is incorrect because heteroplasmic eggs are not guaranteed; homoplasmic eggs can occur.\n- D is incorrect because pollen contributes no plastids; paternal plastids do not determine phenotype.\n- E is incorrect because white plastids in this context are heritable via the egg cytoplasm, not merely a non-heritable somatic mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is the presence of all three phenotypes: entirely green, entirely white, and variegated offspring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1474502"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice challenges you to integrate Mendelian genetics with cytoplasmic inheritance, reflecting the complex reality of cellular genetics.
