This exercise introduces a classic and powerful laboratory technique that uses methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to probe the status of specific DNA sites [@problem_id:1482939]. By comparing the digestion patterns produced by a pair of isoschizomers—enzymes that recognize the same DNA sequence but differ in their sensitivity to methylation—we can deduce whether a target site is methylated or not based on simple gel electrophoresis results.", "problem": "In molecular biology, DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that often occurs at CpG dinucleotides (a cytosine nucleotide followed by a guanine nucleotide). This modification can alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. To investigate the methylation status of a specific gene, researchers often use a pair of restriction enzymes called isoschizomers, which recognize the same DNA sequence but have different sensitivities to methylation.\n\nConsider the isoschizomers HpaII and MspI, both of which recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG-3'. HpaII is methylation-sensitive and will not cut the DNA if the internal cytosine of the recognition sequence is methylated. In contrast, MspI is methylation-insensitive and will cut the sequence regardless of the methylation status of that same cytosine.\n\nA geneticist is studying a specific 1000 base pair (bp) linear DNA fragment isolated from two different sources: Tissue A and Tissue B. This fragment is known to contain exactly one 5'-CCGG-3' recognition site, located 300 bp from one of the ends. For each tissue source, the purified DNA is divided into three samples.\n- Sample 1: No enzyme is added (Control).\n- Sample 2: The DNA is digested with the enzyme HpaII.\n- Sample 3: The DNA is digested with the enzyme MspI.\n\nAll samples are then analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis, a technique that separates DNA fragments by size. The results are as follows:\n\n**Results for Tissue A:**\n- Control sample: Shows a single DNA band at 1000 bp.\n- HpaII-digested sample: Shows a single DNA band at 1000 bp.\n- MspI-digested sample: Shows two DNA bands, one at 700 bp and one at 300 bp.\n\n**Results for Tissue B:**\n- Control sample: Shows a single DNA band at 1000 bp.\n- HpaII-digested sample: Shows two DNA bands, one at 700 bp and one at 300 bp.\n- MspI-digested sample: Shows two DNA bands, one at 700 bp and one at 300 bp.\n\nBased on these experimental outcomes, determine the methylation status of the CCGG site in the DNA from Tissue A and Tissue B.\n\nA. The site is methylated in Tissue A and methylated in Tissue B.\n\nB. The site is unmethylated in Tissue A and unmethylated in Tissue B.\n\nC. The site is methylated in Tissue A and unmethylated in Tissue B.\n\nD. The site is unmethylated in Tissue A and methylated in Tissue B.\n\nE. The experiment is inconclusive because the enzymes did not function as expected.\n\nF. The site is partially methylated in both tissues.", "solution": "The problem requires us to interpret the results of a restriction enzyme digest experiment to determine the DNA methylation status at a specific site in two different tissues.\n\nFirst, let's establish the principles of the assay and the expected outcomes under different conditions.\nThe DNA fragment is linear and 1000 base pairs (bp) long. It contains a single 5'-CCGG-3' recognition site located 300 bp from one end.\nIf an enzyme successfully cuts the DNA at this site, it will cleave the 1000 bp fragment into two smaller fragments: one of length 300 bp and another of length $1000 - 300 = 700$ bp.\nIf an enzyme fails to cut the DNA, the fragment will remain intact at its original length of 1000 bp.\n\nThe key to the experiment lies in the differential sensitivity of the enzymes HpaII and MspI to methylation at the internal cytosine of the CCGG site.\n- MspI is methylation-insensitive. It will always cut the CCGG site if it is present. Therefore, the MspI digest acts as a positive control, confirming the presence of the site and the enzyme's activity.\n- HpaII is methylation-sensitive. It will only cut the CCGG site if the internal cytosine is *unmethylated*. It will not cut if the site is methylated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the results for each tissue.\n\n**Analysis of Tissue A:**\n- The control sample shows a 1000 bp band. This is expected and confirms the starting size of the DNA fragment.\n- The MspI-digested sample shows two bands at 700 bp and 300 bp. This indicates that MspI successfully cut the DNA. This result confirms that the CCGG site is indeed present at the expected location and that the general conditions for enzyme digestion were met.\n- The HpaII-digested sample shows a single band at 1000 bp. This means that HpaII failed to cut the DNA. Since we know from the MspI result that the site is present and accessible, the only possible reason for HpaII's failure to cut is that the internal cytosine of the CCGG site is methylated.\n- Conclusion for Tissue A: The CCGG site is methylated.\n\n**Analysis of Tissue B:**\n- The control sample shows a 1000 bp band, which is the expected result.\n- The MspI-digested sample shows two bands at 700 bp and 300 bp. As with Tissue A, this confirms the presence of the CCGG site and the activity of the MspI enzyme.\n- The HpaII-digested sample also shows two bands at 700 bp and 300 bp. This result indicates that HpaII successfully cut the DNA at the CCGG site.\n- Conclusion for Tissue B: For HpaII to be able to cut the site, the site must be unmethylated.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy combining the analysis of both tissues, we conclude that the CCGG site is methylated in the DNA from Tissue A and unmethylated in the DNA from Tissue B.

The next critical question is to determine the underlying cause of this specificity. This problem challenges you to think like a geneticist and devise a way to distinguish between two major hypotheses: genomic imprinting, where methylation is determined by parental origin, and a cis-acting genetic polymorphism, where the DNA sequence itself dictates the methylation state [@problem_id:1482929]. Solving this requires careful analysis of inheritance patterns to uncover the rules governing the epigenetic mark.", "problem": "In the study of allele-specific gene expression, researchers investigate a human gene, *Synaptic Plasticity Regulator 15* (SPR15). This gene has two common alleles in the population, distinguished by a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in its promoter region: one allele has a thymine (T) and the other has a cytosine (C) at this position. Initial studies on a small cohort of heterozygous (TC) individuals consistently reveal a specific pattern of DNA methylation: the promoter region of the `T` allele is always methylated, while the promoter of the `C` allele is always unmethylated. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this allele-specific methylation:\n\n1.  **Genomic Imprinting Hypothesis:** The *SPR15* gene is subject to genomic imprinting, where the methylation state is determined by the parent of origin. Specifically, the allele inherited from the mother is always methylated, and the allele inherited from the father is always unmethylated. The initial observation is presumed to be a coincidence where, in the individuals studied, the `T` allele was always inherited maternally.\n\n2.  **Cis-acting Polymorphism Hypothesis:** The SNP itself, or a closely linked sequence variant, directly influences methylation. The sequence context of the `T` allele recruits DNA methyltransferases, leading to its methylation, whereas the sequence context of the `C` allele does not. In this model, the `T` allele is always methylated and the `C` allele is always unmethylated, irrespective of parental origin.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, researchers analyze the inheritance and methylation patterns in an extended family. Which of the following potential findings would provide the most conclusive evidence uniquely supporting the **Genomic Imprinting Hypothesis** as described above?\n\nA. An individual with genotype TC is identified, where the paternally-inherited `T` allele is found to be methylated and the maternally-inherited `C` allele is unmethylated.\n\nB. An individual with genotype TC is identified, where the maternally-inherited `T` allele is found to be methylated and the paternally-inherited `C` allele is unmethylated.\n\nC. An individual with genotype CC is identified, and both `C` alleles, one from each parent, are found to be unmethylated.\n\nD. An individual with genotype TC is identified, where the paternally-inherited `T` allele is found to be unmethylated and the maternally-inherited `C` allele is methylated.\n\nE. An individual with genotype TT is identified, and one of the two `T` alleles is found to be methylated while the other is unmethylated.", "solution": "Define the two hypotheses as testable rules for methylation patterns:\n- Genomic Imprinting Hypothesis (GIH): methylation state depends only on parent of origin. Prediction: the maternally inherited allele is methylated (M) and the paternally inherited allele is unmethylated (U), irrespective of whether the allele is T or C. Symbolically, for any genotype XY with maternal X and paternal Y, the pattern is maternal M, paternal U.\n- Cis-acting Polymorphism Hypothesis (CIS): methylation state depends only on the SNP identity. Prediction: T is always methylated (M) and C is always unmethylated (U), irrespective of parental origin. Symbolically, T → M, C → U for all parental origins.\n\nEvaluate each proposed finding against these predictions:\nA. TC individual with paternal T methylated and maternal C unmethylated: Under GIH, paternal should be U and maternal M, so this contradicts GIH. Under CIS, T → M and C → U, which matches. Therefore A supports CIS and refutes GIH; not uniquely supporting GIH.\nB. TC individual with maternal T methylated and paternal C unmethylated: Under GIH, maternal M and paternal U; under CIS, T → M and C → U. Both hypotheses predict this; not distinguishing and thus not uniquely supporting GIH.\nC. CC individual with both C alleles unmethylated: Under GIH, one should be M (maternal) and the other U (paternal), so not both U; this contradicts GIH. Under CIS, C → U for both, which matches. Not supporting GIH.\nD. TC individual with paternal T unmethylated and maternal C methylated: Under GIH, paternal U and maternal M regardless of allele identity; this matches. Under CIS, T must be M and C must be U; here T is U and C is M, contradicting CIS. This pattern uniquely supports GIH by demonstrating parent-of-origin control independent of allele identity.\nE. TT individual with one T methylated and one T unmethylated: Under GIH, maternal M and paternal U would produce exactly one M and one U, so this is consistent. Under CIS, both T alleles should be M, which is contradicted. However, without assigning parental origin, this does not directly demonstrate the parent-of-origin rule; while it disfavors CIS, it is less conclusive than D for uniquely supporting GIH.\n\nTherefore, the most conclusive evidence uniquely supporting the Genomic Imprinting Hypothesis is finding D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1482929"}, {"introduction": "Modern genetic engineering has given us the remarkable ability to not just observe, but to actively manipulate the epigenome. This problem explores a cutting-edge technique using a dCas9-TET1 fusion protein to perform targeted DNA demethylation, effectively 'erasing' a specific epigenetic mark [@problem_id:1482955]. By predicting the consequences of this intervention on the expression of imprinted genes, you will gain insight into how scientists can directly test the functional role of DNA methylation in regulating complex gene networks.", "problem": "In a hypothetical diploid mammalian species, a critical imprinted locus on an autosome contains two genes, *Gene-ALPHA* and *Gene-BETA*, which are essential for embryonic development. Their expression is regulated by an adjacent DNA element known as an Imprinted Control Region (ICR). The regulatory logic of this locus, which includes a distal enhancer and a specific Insulator Protein (IP), is as follows:\n\n1.  On the paternally inherited chromosome, the ICR is hypermethylated. This methylation prevents the IP from binding to the ICR. Consequently, the distal enhancer is able to interact with and strongly activate the promoter of *Gene-ALPHA*. The promoter of *Gene-BETA*, which is part of the methylated ICR, is silenced.\n2.  On the maternally inherited chromosome, the ICR is unmethylated. The IP binds to this unmethylated ICR, creating an insulator boundary that physically blocks the distal enhancer from accessing the *Gene-ALPHA* promoter, thus silencing it. However, the unmethylated ICR itself functions as an active promoter for *Gene-BETA*.\n\nIn wild-type diploid cells, the total cellular expression level from both alleles for *Gene-ALPHA* is denoted as `E_A`, and for *Gene-BETA* is `E_B`. Both `E_A` and `E_B` are non-zero.\n\nA team of genetic engineers performs an experiment on a culture of these wild-type cells. They introduce a custom-designed fusion protein, dCas9-TET1. Here, dCas9 refers to nuclease-dead Cas9, which can bind to a specific DNA sequence guided by an RNA molecule but cannot cleave the DNA. TET1 (Ten-eleven translocation 1) is an enzyme that initiates the process of active DNA demethylation. A guide RNA is co-expressed that specifically targets the dCas9-TET1 protein exclusively to the ICR on the paternally inherited chromosome. The experiment is successful, and the targeted paternal ICR is completely demethylated in all treated cells.\n\nAssuming the expression level from a single active allele is consistent, what are the new total cellular expression levels for *Gene-ALPHA* and *Gene-BETA* in the treated cells, expressed as a pair of ratios relative to their normal wild-type levels (New *Gene-ALPHA* Level / `E_A`, New *Gene-BETA* Level / `E_B`)?\n\nA.

Let the transcriptional output from a single active *Gene-ALPHA* allele be `x` and from a single active *Gene-BETA* allele be `y`.\n\n- **Maternal Allele (Wild-Type):** The Imprinted Control Region (ICR) is unmethylated. The Insulator Protein (IP) binds. This blocks the enhancer, so *Gene-ALPHA* is OFF. The unmethylated ICR acts as a promoter for *Gene-BETA*, so *Gene-BETA* is ON.\n  - Contribution to total expression: *Gene-ALPHA* = 0, *Gene-BETA* = `y`.\n\n- **Paternal Allele (Wild-Type):** The ICR is methylated. The IP cannot bind. The enhancer activates *Gene-ALPHA*, so *Gene-ALPHA* is ON. The methylated ICR silences *Gene-BETA*, so *Gene-BETA* is OFF.\n  - Contribution to total expression: *Gene-ALPHA* = `x`, *Gene-BETA* = 0.\n\n- **Total Wild-Type Expression (`E_A`, `E_B`):** We sum the contributions from both alleles.\n  - Total *Gene-ALPHA* expression, `E_A` = (Maternal contribution) + (Paternal contribution) = 0 + `x` = `x`.\n  - Total *Gene-BETA* expression, `E_B` = (Maternal contribution) + (Paternal contribution) = `y` + 0 = `y`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the state of the cell after the experimental treatment. The dCas9-TET1 fusion protein, guided by a specific RNA, demethylates the ICR on the paternal chromosome. The maternal chromosome is unaffected.\n\n- **Maternal Allele (Treated Cell):** Unchanged. The ICR remains unmethylated. *Gene-ALPHA* is OFF, and *Gene-BETA* is ON.\n  - Contribution to total expression: *Gene-ALPHA* = 0, *Gene-BETA* = `y`.\n\n- **Paternal Allele (Treated Cell):** The ICR has been demethylated by TET1. This makes its state identical to that of a normal maternal ICR.\n  - Since the paternal ICR is now unmethylated, the Insulator Protein (IP) will bind to it.\n  - The bound IP will create an insulator, blocking the enhancer from activating *Gene-ALPHA*. Therefore, *Gene-ALPHA* on the paternal allele is now OFF.\n  - The now-unmethylated paternal ICR will function as a promoter for *Gene-BETA*. Therefore, *Gene-BETA* on the paternal allele is now ON.\n  - Contribution to total expression: *Gene-ALPHA* = 0, *Gene-BETA* = `y`.\n\nNow, we calculate the new total cellular expression levels in the treated cells by summing the contributions from the (unchanged) maternal allele and the (modified) paternal allele.\n\n- **New Total *Gene-ALPHA* Expression:** (Maternal contribution) + (Treated Paternal contribution) = 0 + 0 = 0.\n- **New Total *Gene-BETA* Expression:** (Maternal contribution) + (Treated Paternal contribution) = `y` + `y` = `2y`.\n\nFinally, we need to express these new levels as ratios relative to the original wild-type levels, `E_A` and `E_B`.\nRecall that `E_A = x` and `E_B = y`.\n\n- **Ratio for *Gene-ALPHA*:** (New *Gene-ALPHA* Level) / `E_A` = `0 / x` = 0.\n- **Ratio for *Gene-BETA*:** (New *Gene-BETA* Level) / `E_B` = `2y / y` = 2.\n\nThe resulting pair of ratios is (0, 2).
