This first practice explores the fundamental 'recruitment-then-action' principle, where a specific histone mark serves as a beacon for a remodeling complex. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation [@problem_id:1475095], you will sharpen your understanding of how reader domains, such as bromodomains, are essential for linking histone modifications to gene activation.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the regulation of gene expression is tightly linked to the dynamic structure of chromatin. For a gene to be transcribed, the surrounding chromatin must typically be in a relaxed state, known as euchromatin, allowing transcription factors and RNA polymerase to access the DNA. One critical mechanism for achieving this is histone modification.\n\nConsider a specific gene, designated Gene G, which is normally silent but becomes actively transcribed in response to an external hormonal signal. The activation pathway is as follows:\n1. The hormone binds its receptor, initiating a signaling cascade that activates a specific Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT).\n2. The activated HAT adds acetyl groups to the lysine residues on the tails of histone proteins in the nucleosomes surrounding the promoter of Gene G.\n3. A multi-protein machine called the Chromatin Accessibility Complex (CAC) contains a subunit with a specialized \"bromodomain,\" which specifically recognizes and binds to these acetylated histone tails.\n4. Upon binding, the CAC utilizes the energy from ATP hydrolysis to physically reposition or eject nucleosomes, thereby exposing the promoter sequence of Gene G.\n5. With the promoter now accessible, transcription factors and RNA polymerase can bind, leading to the robust transcription of Gene G.\n\nNow, imagine a cell line is engineered with a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the bromodomain-containing subunit of the CAC. This mutation completely abolishes the ability of the bromodomain to bind to acetylated histones, but has no effect on the ATP-hydrolyzing, nucleosome-sliding function of the complex itself.\n\nWhat is the most likely outcome for the expression of Gene G in these mutant cells when they are treated with the hormonal signal, as compared to normal, wild-type cells?\n\nA. Gene G will be constitutively transcribed at a high level, even in the absence of the hormone.\n\nB. The expression level of Gene G will be significantly lower or completely absent, because the chromatin at its promoter will remain inaccessible.\n\nC. The expression of Gene G will be unaffected by the mutation, as histone acetylation is the primary and sufficient step for transcriptional activation.\n\nD. The histone proteins around Gene G will become hyper-acetylated because the CAC can no longer bind and trigger downstream deacetylation events.\n\nE. Gene G will be transcribed, but the resulting messenger RNA (mRNA) will be immediately targeted for degradation due to a faulty transcription process.", "solution": "The activation mechanism for Gene G relies on a sequence of recruitment and remodeling steps:\n\n1. Hormone-bound receptor activates a Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT), which acetylates lysine residues on histone tails near the promoter of Gene G. Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge of lysines, modestly weakening histone-DNA interactions and, critically, creates binding sites for acetyl-lysine reader domains such as bromodomains.\n\n2. The Chromatin Accessibility Complex (CAC) contains a bromodomain that specifically recognizes and binds acetylated histone tails. This recognition event is a targeting step that recruits CAC to the acetylated nucleosomes at the promoter.\n\n3. Once localized, the CAC uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to reposition or eject nucleosomes, thereby exposing the promoter. Promoter exposure is required for transcription factor and RNA polymerase recruitment and robust transcription.\n\nIn the mutant cells, the point mutation abolishes the bromodomainâ€™s ability to bind acetylated histones, while leaving the ATP-dependent remodeling activity of the CAC intact. The key consequence is a failure of specific recruitment of CAC to the acetylated promoter nucleosomes of Gene G. Without bromodomain-mediated targeting, the CAC cannot efficiently localize to the acetylated chromatin created by HAT activity. Although acetylation still occurs, this modification alone is typically not sufficient for robust promoter opening; ATP-dependent remodeling is needed to slide or evict nucleosomes at the promoter, and that remodeling depends on proper recruitment.\n\nTherefore, upon hormonal stimulation, the promoter of Gene G remains largely occluded by nucleosomes, preventing effective binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase. The predicted outcome is that Gene G expression will be significantly reduced or absent compared to wild-type cells.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because loss of bromodomain recognition removes a key recruitment step and would not cause constitutive activation.\n- C is incorrect because histone acetylation alone is generally not sufficient; ATP-dependent remodeling recruited via bromodomains is often required for robust activation.\n- D is incorrect because CAC is a remodeling complex, not a deacetylase; its failure to bind does not inherently cause hyper-acetylation.\n- E is incorrect because the mutation affects chromatin targeting, not transcription fidelity or mRNA stability.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is significantly lower or absent expression of Gene G upon hormonal signaling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1475095"}, {"introduction": "Chromatin remodelers don't just act on single nucleosomes; their collective action shapes the architecture of entire chromosomal regions. This exercise [@problem_id:1475052] connects the microscopic, ATP-dependent activity of the ISWI remodeler family to the macroscopic organization of regularly spaced nucleosomes. You will practice predicting the outcome of a classic biochemical experiment, Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) digestion, learning how we experimentally visualize the consequences of lost remodeler function.", "problem": "A molecular biology researcher is investigating the role of chromatin structure in a eukaryotic cell line. The researcher compares two cultures: a wild-type (WT) cell line and a mutant cell line. The mutant line possesses a critical loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the core ATPase subunit of an Imitation Switch (ISWI) family chromatin remodeling complex. This mutation renders the ISWI complex completely non-functional.\n\nTo analyze the bulk chromatin organization, the researcher isolates nuclei from both WT and mutant cells and subjects them to a limited digestion with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase). MNase is an endonuclease that preferentially digests the linker DNA that connects nucleosome core particles, while the DNA wrapped around the histone octamer is protected. The resulting DNA fragments from both samples are then purified and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nBased on the established function of ISWI family complexes in organizing chromatin, which of the following outcomes describes the most likely difference to be observed between the fragmentation patterns of the WT and mutant DNA on the electrophoresis gel?\n\nA. The WT sample will show a distinct ladder of DNA fragments with regular size intervals, while the mutant sample will show a diffuse smear of DNA fragments lacking a clear laddering pattern.\n\nB. The WT sample will show a diffuse smear of DNA fragments, while the mutant sample will show a highly distinct and sharp ladder pattern, indicating more ordered chromatin.\n\nC. The DNA from the mutant sample will be almost completely digested into fragments the size of a single nucleotide, while the WT sample will show a ladder of larger fragments.\n\nD. The DNA from the mutant sample will be almost entirely resistant to MNase digestion, remaining as a single band of very high molecular weight, while the WT sample shows a ladder of digested fragments.\n\nE. Both samples will show a ladder pattern, but the spacing between the rungs of the ladder will be significantly smaller in the mutant sample compared to the WT.", "solution": "Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) preferentially cleaves linker DNA, while DNA wrapped around the histone octamer is protected. Let the protected nucleosomal DNA length be denoted by $l_{core}$ and the average linker DNA length by $L$. In a regularly spaced nucleosome array, the nucleosome repeat length is $R = l_{core} + L$. Limited MNase digestion of such arrays generates DNA fragments corresponding to mono-, di-, tri- and higher-order nucleosomes with sizes $R, 2R, 3R, \\dots$, which appear as a distinct ladder of bands on an agarose gel.\n\nISWI family chromatin remodelers use ATP-dependent sliding to organize and space nucleosomes into regular arrays. In wild-type (WT) cells with functional ISWI, nucleosomes are more regularly spaced, so $L$ is relatively uniform genome-wide, producing discrete fragment sizes $nR$ and a sharp nucleosomal ladder upon MNase digestion.\n\nIn the mutant with a loss-of-function in the ISWI ATPase, nucleosome spacing becomes irregular due to failure of the spacing activity. This can be represented as linker lengths $L_{i}$ that vary widely across loci, so fragments after MNase digestion have sizes $l_{core} + L_{i}$ and sums thereof for oligonucleosomes, yielding a broad distribution rather than discrete multiples of a single $R$. On a gel, this manifests as a diffuse smear or a markedly less distinct ladder compared to WT.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is that the WT shows a distinct nucleosomal ladder with regular spacing, whereas the ISWI-deficient mutant shows a diffuse smear lacking clear laddering.\n\nOption checks:\n- A matches the expected effect of losing a nucleosome-spacing remodeler.\n- B reverses the expected outcome.\n- C is incorrect because MNase does not digest to single nucleotides under limited digestion, and nucleosomal DNA is protected.\n- D is incorrect because the mutant chromatin is not globally resistant to MNase; if anything, irregular spacing yields more heterogeneous digestion.\n- E is unlikely because loss of ISWI increases heterogeneity in $L$ rather than causing a consistent decrease in nucleosome repeat length; the dominant change is loss of regularity, not a systematic shift to smaller spacing.\n\nThus, A is the best answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1475052"}, {"introduction": "In the complex environment of the nucleus, cellular tasks are often accomplished by teams of proteins, not just single players.
