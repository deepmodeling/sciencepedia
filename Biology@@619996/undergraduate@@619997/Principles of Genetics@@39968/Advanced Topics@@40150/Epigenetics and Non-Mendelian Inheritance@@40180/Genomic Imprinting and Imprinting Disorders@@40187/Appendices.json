By comparing the outcomes of two reciprocal crosses, you will practice predicting non-Mendelian inheritance patterns and solidify your understanding of how paternal imprinting works at a fundamental level.", "problem": "In mammalian genetics, some genes are subject to genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon where the expression of an allele depends on its parental origin. A research team is investigating a gene in mice called Placental Growth Factor 2 (PGF2), which is crucial for the formation of a healthy placenta. Their studies have confirmed that the `PGF2` gene is paternally expressed, meaning that only the allele inherited from the father is transcribed, while the maternal allele is transcriptionally silent.\n\nThe team has identified a null allele, denoted as `pgf2-`, which fails to produce a functional protein. The corresponding wild-type allele is denoted as `PGF2+`. To understand the inheritance pattern of the associated placental defect, the researchers perform two reciprocal crosses using true-breeding wild-type mice (`PGF2+/PGF2+`) and mice heterozygous for the null allele (`PGF2+/pgf2-`).\n\n- **Cross 1:** A wild-type male (`PGF2+/PGF2+`) is crossed with a heterozygous female (`PGF2+/pgf2-`).\n- **Cross 2:** A heterozygous male (`PGF2+/pgf2-`) is crossed with a wild-type female (`PGF2+/PGF2+`).\n\nAssuming the null allele results in a visibly defective, smaller-than-normal placenta, which of the following outcomes is expected?\n\nA.

A placental defect will be observed in 25% of the offspring from both Cross 1 and Cross 2.\n\nD. A placental defect will be observed in all offspring from both crosses because the null allele is present in the parental generation.\n\nE. No placental defect will be observed in any offspring because a wild-type allele is always present in at least one parent of each cross.", "solution": "Key genetic principle: PGF2 is paternally expressed due to genomic imprinting, so only the paternally inherited allele is transcribed; the maternally inherited allele is transcriptionally silent. Therefore, the placental phenotype depends solely on the allele contributed by the father. Let the null allele be denoted as $pgf2^{-}$ (nonfunctional) and the wild-type allele as $PGF2^{+}$ (functional). A placental defect occurs if and only if the paternally inherited allele is $pgf2^{-}$.\n\nCross 1: Male $PGF2^{+}/PGF2^{+}$ crossed with female $PGF2^{+}/pgf2^{-}$. The paternal gametes are all $PGF2^{+}$. The maternal gametes are $PGF2^{+}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $pgf2^{-}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. All zygotes inherit a paternal $PGF2^{+}$ allele, which is the only expressed allele; the maternal allele (whether $PGF2^{+}$ or $pgf2^{-}$) is silent. Thus, the probability of a defect is\n$$\nP(\\text{defect})=P(\\text{paternal allele}=pgf2^{-})=0.\n$$\n\nCross 2: Male $PGF2^{+}/pgf2^{-}$ crossed with female $PGF2^{+}/PGF2^{+}$. The paternal gametes are $PGF2^{+}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $pgf2^{-}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The maternal gametes are all $PGF2^{+}$. Offspring that inherit a paternal $PGF2^{+}$ allele are normal; offspring that inherit a paternal $pgf2^{-}$ allele are defective because the only expressed allele is nonfunctional, and the maternal $PGF2^{+}$ is silent. Thus,\n$$\nP(\\text{defect})=P(\\text{paternal allele}=pgf2^{-})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, a placental defect is expected in $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the offspring only in Cross 2. Options C, D, and E contradict the imprinting rule that only the paternal allele determines expression, and option A is incorrect because the father in Cross 1 contributes only $PGF2^{+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1494640"}, {"introduction": "Understanding genomic imprinting is not just an academic exercise; it has critical applications in biomedical research and medicine.

You will need to apply the rules of imprinting to decide on the correct breeding strategy, demonstrating how this knowledge is essential for accurately modeling human diseases.", "problem": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon where the expression of certain genes is determined by their parent of origin. In specific tissues, one parental allele (either maternal or paternal) is selectively silenced, meaning only the other parental allele is expressed.\n\nA researcher aims to create a mouse model for Angelman syndrome, a human neurodevelopmental disorder. This disorder is caused by the loss of function of the UBE3A gene. In humans, and similarly in mice, the UBE3A gene is subject to genomic imprinting specifically in neurons of the brain. In these critical cells, the allele inherited from the father is naturally transcriptionally silenced, while the allele inherited from the mother is normally expressed.\n\nTo create the model, the researcher uses genetic engineering to generate a non-functional, or \"knockout,\" allele for the UBE3A gene. A mouse carrying this knockout allele will be bred with a wild-type (normal) mouse. To ensure the resulting offspring exhibit the neurological characteristics of Angelman syndrome, which of the following breeding strategies must be employed?\n\nA. The knockout allele must be inherited from the father.\n\nB. The knockout allele must be inherited from the mother.\n\nC.

The knockout allele must be inherited from the father, and the mother must be from a different mouse strain.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the necessary parental origin of a non-functional UBE3A allele to create a mouse model of Angelman syndrome.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the key information provided about the genetics of the UBE3A gene. The problem states that in the relevant brain neurons, the UBE3A gene is subject to genomic imprinting. Specifically, the paternal allele (the copy inherited from the father) is transcriptionally silenced. This means that, under normal circumstances, the only functional copy of the UBE3A gene in these neurons is the one inherited from the mother. The protein product of the UBE3A gene is therefore exclusively produced from the maternal allele in these cells.\n\nAngelman syndrome arises from a loss of function of UBE3A. To model this syndrome in a mouse, we need to create a situation where the mouse's brain neurons lack any functional UBE3A protein.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios for an offspring mouse inheriting one knockout UBE3A allele, which we will denote as $UBE3A^{-}$, and one wild-type allele, denoted as $UBE3A^{+}$.\n\nCase 1: The knockout allele is inherited from the father.\nThe offspring's genotype is paternal $UBE3A^{-}$ / maternal $UBE3A^{+}$.\nIn the brain neurons, the paternal allele is silenced due to imprinting. So, the $UBE3A^{-}$ from the father would be silent anyway. The maternal allele, $UBE3A^{+}$, is active. Therefore, the neuron will produce functional UBE3A protein from the maternal allele. This mouse would not exhibit the Angelman syndrome phenotype and would likely be healthy. This invalidates option A.\n\nCase 2: The knockout allele is inherited from the mother.\nThe offspring's genotype is paternal $UBE3A^{+}$ / maternal $UBE3A^{-}$.\nIn the brain neurons, the paternal allele ($UBE3A^{+}$) is silenced by the natural imprinting process. The maternal allele ($UBE3A^{-}$) is the one that would normally be expressed, but it is non-functional (a knockout). As a result, the neuron has no source of functional UBE3A protein. This absence of the essential protein will lead to the neurological deficits characteristic of Angelman syndrome. This scenario successfully models the disease. This confirms option B is the correct strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options to be thorough.\nOption C states that the parent of origin does not matter. Our analysis of Case 1 and Case 2 directly contradicts this. The parent of origin is critical due to imprinting.\nOption D suggests the mouse must be homozygous recessive ($UBE3A^{-}$ / $UBE3A^{-}$). While such a mouse would certainly lack functional UBE3A and exhibit the syndrome, it is not the necessary condition. As shown in Case 2, inheriting just one knockout allele from the correct parent is sufficient to cause the syndrome. The question asks what must be employed, and a heterozygous mouse following Case 2 will show the phenotype. Therefore, homozygosity is not a requirement.\nOption E adds an irrelevant condition about the mother's strain. The mechanism of imprinting described is a property of the gene itself, not dependent on the mouse strain in this context. This option is a distractor.\n\nTherefore, to create a mouse model for Angelman syndrome, the non-functional knockout allele must be inherited from the mother.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1494652"}, {"introduction": "Genomic imprinting can create inheritance scenarios that seem to defy simple genetic rules, a common source of confusion in genetic counseling. This final practice [@problem_id:1494658] delves into one such paradox: an individual who is phenotypically normal can be a carrier and pass on a disorder like Angelman syndrome to their children. Working through this problem will challenge you to synthesize concepts of imprinting, gamete formation, and the resetting of parental marks between generations, providing insight into the complex reality of clinical genetics.", "problem": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon where the expression of a gene depends on whether it was inherited from the mother or the father. This parent-of-origin effect means that for certain genes, only one of the two parental alleles is expressed, while the other is silenced.\n\nAngelman Syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from a lack of function of the gene *UBE3A* in specific regions of the brain. The imprinting pattern of *UBE3A* is such that in these critical brain regions, the copy of the gene inherited from the father (the paternal allele) is silenced, and only the copy inherited from the mother (the maternal allele) is expressed.\n\nConsider a woman who is phenotypically normal. Genetic testing reveals that she has a microdeletion on one of her copies of chromosome 15 that completely inactivates the *UBE3A* gene. Family history analysis confirms that she inherited this deletion-carrying chromosome from her father. Her other copy of chromosome 15, inherited from her mother, has a fully functional *UBE3A* gene.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly explains both why this woman is phenotypically normal AND why any child she conceives has a 50% risk of being affected with Angelman Syndrome?\n\nA. She is phenotypically normal because the functional maternal allele is dominant, masking the effect of the recessive paternal deletion. Her child has a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion, which will cause the syndrome regardless of the allele inherited from the child's father.\n\nB. She is phenotypically normal because in her brain, the paternal copy of *UBE3A* (which carries the deletion) is silenced by imprinting, and her functional maternal copy is expressed. Her child has a 50% risk of AS because if the child inherits her deletion-carrying chromosome, it becomes the child's maternal chromosome, and the copy from the child's father will be silenced, leaving no functional *UBE3A* in the brain.\n\nC. She is phenotypically normal because the body can repair such deletions during development. Her child has a 50% risk of AS because this repair mechanism fails in 50% of gametes.\n\nD. She is phenotypically normal because the paternal allele is the one that is normally expressed, and she inherited the deletion from her father. Her child has a 50% risk of AS because the imprint can switch during meiosis, making the maternal allele the one that is silenced.\n\nE. She is phenotypically normal because the functional allele from her mother compensates for the paternal deletion. Her child has a 50% risk of being a carrier like her, but will only be affected with AS if the child's father also provides a non-functional *UBE3A* allele.", "solution": "Genomic imprinting in the relevant brain regions for the gene UBE3A imposes parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression. The governing principle here is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{brain}}(\\text{UBE3A}) = \\text{expression from the maternal allele only}, \\quad \\text{paternal allele is silenced}.\n$$\nTherefore, the phenotype depends solely on the functional status of the maternally derived allele in the brain.\n\nIn the woman described, her two chromosome 15 alleles at UBE3A are:\n- Maternal chromosome: functional UBE3A (denote as $U$).\n- Paternal chromosome: deletion/inactivation of UBE3A (denote as $D$), inherited from her father.\n\nBecause in her brain the paternal allele is silenced by imprinting, the expressed dosage is\n$$\nE_{\\text{mother}} = U_{\\text{maternal}} + 0_{\\text{paternal}} = U,\n$$\nwhich is functional, so she is phenotypically normal.\n\nFor transmission to offspring, by Mendel’s law of segregation, each gamete carries either her $U$ or her $D$ allele with probability\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{transmit } U) = \\Pr(\\text{transmit } D) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nIn any child, the allele the child receives from the father will be the paternal allele and will be silenced in the child’s brain for UBE3A.
