Consider a biologist studying a simplified system consisting of a set of four viruses, $U = \\{V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4\\}$, and a set of six human proteins they target, $V = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6\\}$. An edge exists between a virus $v \\in U$ and a protein $p \\in V$ if viral protein $v$ interacts with human protein $p$. The observed interactions are as follows:\n\n- Virus $V_1$ targets proteins $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$.\n- Virus $V_2$ targets proteins $P_2$, $P_3$, and $P_4$.\n- Virus $V_3$ targets proteins $P_4$ and $P_5$.\n- Virus $V_4$ targets proteins $P_1$, $P_4$, and $P_6$.\n\nFrom this bipartite network, two single-mode projected networks can be constructed:\n\n1.  A **virus-projected network**, $G_V$, where the nodes are the viruses. An edge exists between two distinct viruses if they target at least one common human protein. The weight of an edge between two viruses is defined as the total number of common protein targets they share.\n\n2.  A **protein-projected network**, $G_P$, where the nodes are the human proteins. An edge exists between two distinct proteins if they are targeted by at least one common virus. In this network, the degree of a protein node is defined simply as the number of other protein nodes it is connected to (i.e., we count the number of edges, not their weights).\n\nYour task is to calculate two quantities:\n- Let $W_{12}$ be the weight of the edge connecting virus $V_1$ and virus $V_2$ in the virus-projected network $G_V$.\n- Let $K_{P4}$ be the degree of protein $P_4$ in the protein-projected network $G_P$.\n\nDetermine the ordered pair $(W_{12}, K_{P4})$.", "solution": "The problem asks for two values, $W_{12}$ and $K_{P4}$, derived from two different projections of a given bipartite network of virus-protein interactions. We will solve for each value step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's represent the bipartite network by listing the set of protein targets for each virus:\n- Targets of $V_1$: $T(V_1) = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$\n- Targets of $V_2$: $T(V_2) = \\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$\n- Targets of $V_3$: $T(V_3) = \\{P_4, P_5\\}$\n- Targets of $V_4$: $T(V_4) = \\{P_1, P_4, P_6\\}$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $W_{12}$ from the Virus-Projected Network ($G_V$)**\n\nThe virus-projected network $G_V$ has viruses as nodes. The weight of an edge between two viruses is the number of common protein targets. We need to find $W_{12}$, the weight of the edge between $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\nTo find this weight, we need to identify the common targets of $V_1$ and $V_2$.

An edge exists between two proteins if they are targeted by at least one common virus. The degree of a protein node, $K_{P4}$, is the number of other proteins connected to $P_4$.\n\nTo find the neighbors of $P_4$, we first need to identify which viruses target $P_4$. From the problem statement:\n- $V_2$ targets $P_4$.\n- $V_3$ targets $P_4$.\n- $V_4$ targets $P_4$.\n\nSo, the set of viruses targeting $P_4$ is $\\{V_2, V_3, V_4\\}$.\nA protein $P_j$ (where $j \\neq 4$) is connected to $P_4$ if it is also targeted by at least one of these viruses ($V_2$, $V_3$, or $V_4$). Let's find all proteins targeted by these three viruses.\n\n- Proteins targeted by $V_2$: $T(V_2) = \\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$\n- Proteins targeted by $V_3$: $T(V_3) = \\{P_4, P_5\\}$\n- Proteins targeted by $V_4$: $T(V_4) = \\{P_1, P_4, P_6\\}$\n\nLet's identify the neighbors of $P_4$:\n- Because $P_2$ and $P_3$ are also targeted by $V_2$, edges $(P_4, P_2)$ and $(P_4, P_3)$ exist in $G_P$.\n- Because $P_5$ is also targeted by $V_3$, an edge $(P_4, P_5)$ exists in $G_P$.\n- Because $P_1$ and $P_6$ are also targeted by $V_4$, edges $(P_4, P_1)$ and $(P_4, P_6)$ exist in $G_P$.\n\nThe set of proteins connected to $P_4$ is the union of all proteins co-targeted with $P_4$ by any of the viruses $V_2, V_3, V_4$, excluding $P_4$ itself.\n- Co-targets with $V_2$: $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$\n- Co-targets with $V_3$: $\\{P_5\\}$\n- Co-targets with $V_4$: $\\{P_1, P_6\\}$\n\nThe set of neighbors of $P_4$ is the union of these sets: $\\{P_2, P_3\\} \\cup \\{P_5\\} \\cup \\{P_1, P_6\\} = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_5, P_6\\}$.\n\nThe degree $K_{P4}$ is the number of nodes in this set of neighbors.\nThe neighbors are $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_5, P_6$. There are 5 such proteins.\nTherefore, the degree of protein $P_4$ is 5.\n$$ K_{P4} = 5 $$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have calculated both values: $W_{12} = 2$ and $K_{P4} = 5$.\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair $(W_{12}, K_{P4})$.\n\nThe final answer is $(2, 5)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1450018"}, {"introduction": "In modern systems biology, we rarely rely on a single source of evidence; instead, we integrate data from multiple experiments to build a more complete picture.
