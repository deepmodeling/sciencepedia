A classic example is the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) found in mitochondria and bacteria, which is essential for cellular respiration. Consider a simplified model where an electron is passed between two protein complexes within the ETC. Due to the potential difference between these complexes, the electron acquires a kinetic energy of $K = 0.150$ eV.\n\nGiven the following physical constants:\n- Mass of an electron, $m_e = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C (note that 1 eV = $1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ J)\n\nFirst, calculate the de Broglie wavelength of this electron.
