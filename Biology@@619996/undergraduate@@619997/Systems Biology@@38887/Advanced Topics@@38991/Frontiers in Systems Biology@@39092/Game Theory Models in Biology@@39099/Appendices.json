[@problem_id:1435527]", "problem": "In a spatially confined habitat, two recently hatched sibling insect larvae compete for a single, indivisible food item. The food provides a fitness benefit of $V$ to the larva that consumes it. Each larva can adopt one of two strategies: 'Fight' (the Hawk strategy) or 'Share' (the Dove strategy).\n\nIf both larvae choose to 'Fight', they engage in combat. There is an equal probability of winning, and the winner consumes the food. The loser incurs a fitness cost $C$ due to injury, while the winner is unharmed. If one larva chooses 'Fight' and the other chooses 'Share', the fighter easily takes the food without a struggle, and the sharer receives no benefit and no cost. If both larvae choose to 'Share', they divide the resource equally, each gaining a fitness benefit of $V/2$.\n\nThe larvae are siblings with a coefficient of relatedness $r$, where $0 < r < 1$. An individual's success is measured by its inclusive fitness, which is the sum of its own fitness payoff and the fitness payoff of its opponent multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness $r$. A strategy is considered an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), a central concept in game theory, if a population of individuals using that strategy cannot be invaded by a small number of individuals (mutants) adopting an alternative strategy.\n\nAssuming that the benefit of winning $V$ is greater than the cost of injury $C$, determine the minimum value for the benefit-to-cost ratio, $V/C$, for the 'Fight' strategy to be a pure ESS in this sibling rivalry.

If both Share (D vs D), each gets $V/2$.\n\nInclusive fitness for a focal individual is its own direct payoff plus $r$ times the opponent’s direct payoff.
