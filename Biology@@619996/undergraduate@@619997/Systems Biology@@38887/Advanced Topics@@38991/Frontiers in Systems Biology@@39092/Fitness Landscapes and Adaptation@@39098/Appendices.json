Understanding the size of this space is a fundamental first step in analyzing concepts like fitness landscapes and evolutionary pathways.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the development of drug resistance in a virus. The resistance phenotype is determined by mutations at a specific number of locations, known as loci, within the viral genome. At each of these loci, we assume there are exactly two possible variants, or alleles: the original, susceptible \"wild-type\" allele and a new, resistant \"mutant\" allele. A system with two possible alleles at each locus is called biallelic. The virus's specific combination of alleles across all relevant loci defines its genotype.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of unique genotypes possible for a simple viral strain where resistance is governed by $L_1 = 3$ independent biallelic loci.\n\nSecond, calculate the total number of unique genotypes for a more complex viral strain where resistance involves $L_2 = 10$ independent biallelic loci.\n\nYour final answer should be two integers, corresponding to the number of genotypes for the $L_1$ and $L_2$ cases, respectively.", "solution": "Each genotype is a choice of one allele at each locus.
