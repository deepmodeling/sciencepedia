Consider a simplified model where the locations of four key signaling proteins have been identified using super-resolution microscopy. The proteins, labeled P1, P2, P3, and P4, are treated as points in a 2D plane with the following coordinates (in nanometers, nm):\n- P1: (0, 0)\n- P2: (3, 0)\n- P3: (0, 4)\n- P4: (3, 4)\n\nTo analyze the clustering of these proteins, we can construct a sequence of simplicial complexes known as a Vietoris-Rips filtration. A simplicial complex is a collection of points (0-simplices), edges connecting pairs of points (1-simplices), filled triangles connecting triples of points (2-simplices), and their higher-dimensional counterparts.\n\nFor a given radius $\\epsilon$, the Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex is constructed as follows: a set of $k+1$ protein locations forms a $k$-simplex if and only if the Euclidean distance between any two locations in the set is less than or equal to $2\\epsilon$. The filtration is the sequence of VR complexes generated by gradually increasing $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe topology of each complex in the filtration can be characterized by its Betti numbers. For our purposes, we are interested in:\n- $\\beta_0$: The number of connected components in the complex.\n- $\\beta_1$: The number of one-dimensional loops or \"holes\" in the complex.\n\nFor the three specific filtration values $\\epsilon_1 = 1.6 \\text{ nm}$, $\\epsilon_2 = 2.1 \\text{ nm}$, and $\\epsilon_3 = 2.6 \\text{ nm}$, determine the Betti numbers $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ for the resulting Vietoris-Rips complex at each step.\n\nProvide your six results as a single row matrix in the order $(\\beta_0(\\epsilon_1), \\beta_1(\\epsilon_1), \\beta_0(\\epsilon_2), \\beta_1(\\epsilon_2), \\beta_0(\\epsilon_3), \\beta_1(\\epsilon_3))$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the Betti numbers $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ of the Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex constructed from four points at three different radii $\\epsilon$. The four points are P1(0, 0), P2(3, 0), P3(0, 4), and P4(3, 4).\n\nFirst, we calculate the pairwise Euclidean distances between all points. Let $d(Pi, Pj)$ be the distance between protein $i$ and protein $j$.\n- $d(P1, P2) = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n- $d(P1, P3) = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$\n- $d(P1, P4) = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\n- $d(P2, P3) = \\sqrt{(0-3)^2 + (4-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\n- $d(P2, P4) = \\sqrt{(3-3)^2 + (4-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$\n- $d(P3, P4) = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (4-4)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nThe set of unique distances is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$. According to the definition of the VR complex, an edge (1-simplex) exists between two points if their distance $d$ is less than or equal to the diameter $2\\epsilon$. A triangle (2-simplex) exists on three points if all three pairwise distances are $\\le 2\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis for $\\epsilon_1 = 1.6$ nm**\n\nThe condition for forming simplices is $d \\le 2\\epsilon_1 = 2 \\times 1.6 = 3.2$.\nWe check which pairwise distances satisfy this condition:\n- $d(P1, P2) = 3 \\le 3.2$ (Edge P1-P2 forms)\n- $d(P3, P4) = 3 \\le 3.2$ (Edge P3-P4 forms)\n- All other distances (4 and 5) are greater than 3.2.\n\nThe complex at $\\epsilon_1=1.6$ consists of the four vertices (0-simplices) and two edges (1-simplices): {P1, P2} and {P3, P4}.\n- To find $\\beta_0$, we count the number of connected components. The points form two separate components: one containing {P1, P2} and the other containing {P3, P4}. Thus, $\\beta_0(\\epsilon_1) = 2$.\n- To find $\\beta_1$, we look for 1D holes (cycles). There are no cycles in the complex. Thus, $\\beta_1(\\epsilon_1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis for $\\epsilon_2 = 2.1$ nm**\n\nThe condition for forming simplices is $d \\le 2\\epsilon_2 = 2 \\times 2.1 = 4.2$.\nWe check which pairwise distances satisfy this condition:\n- Distances of 3: $d(P1, P2)$ and $d(P3, P4)$ are $\\le 4.2$.\n- Distances of 4: $d(P1, P3)$ and $d(P2, P4)$ are $\\le 4.2$.\n- Distances of 5: $d(P1, P4)$ and $d(P2, P3)$ are $> 4.2$.\n\nThe edges that form are (P1, P2), (P3, P4), (P1, P3), and (P2, P4).\n- To find $\\beta_0$, we check connectivity. The edge (P1, P3) connects the two components from the previous step. For example, P1 is connected to P3, which is connected to P4, which is connected to P2 (via P1 and P3). All four points are now in a single connected component. Thus, $\\beta_0(\\epsilon_2) = 1$.\n- To find $\\beta_1$, we look for holes. The four edges form a cycle: P1-P3-P4-P2-P1. This is a potential 1D hole. A hole exists if this cycle is not the boundary of a collection of 2-simplices (triangles). We need to check if any triangles have formed.\n    - Triangle {P1, P2, P3}? Requires $d(P2, P3) = 5$, which is $> 4.2$. No.\n    - Triangle {P1, P3, P4}? Requires $d(P1, P4) = 5$, which is $> 4.2$. No.\n    - Triangle {P1, P2, P4}? Requires $d(P1, P4) = 5$, which is $> 4.2$. No.\n    - Triangle {P2, P4, P3}? Requires $d(P2, P3) = 5$, which is $> 4.2$. No.\nSince no 2-simplices are formed, the cycle is not filled in. It represents a genuine 1D hole. Thus, $\\beta_1(\\epsilon_2) = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis for $\\epsilon_3 = 2.6$ nm**\n\nThe condition for forming simplices is $d \\le 2\\epsilon_3 = 2 \\times 2.6 = 5.2$.\nWe check which pairwise distances satisfy this condition:\n- Distances of 3, 4, and 5 are all $\\le 5.2$.\nThis means all possible pairs of points are connected by an edge. The graph is the complete graph $K_4$.\n- Since the graph is connected, $\\beta_0(\\epsilon_3) = 1$.\n- To find $\\beta_1$, we check if the hole from the previous step has been filled. We look for 2-simplices.\n    - Triangle {P1, P2, P3}: Distances are {3, 4, 5}. All are $\\le 5.2$. This 2-simplex forms.\n    - Triangle {P1, P3, P4}: Distances are {4, 5, 3}. All are $\\le 5.2$. This 2-simplex forms.\n    - Triangle {P2, P4, P3}: Distances are {4, 5, 3}. All are $\\le 5.2$. This 2-simplex forms.\n    - Triangle {P1, P2, P4}: Distances are {3, 5, 4}. All are $\\le 5.2$. This 2-simplex forms.\nThe cycle P1-P3-P4-P2-P1 from the previous step is now filled. For example, the cycle can be seen as the boundary of the union of the two triangles {P1, P3, P4} and {P1, P4, P2}. Since the cycle is now a boundary of a 2-chain (a sum of 2-simplices), it no longer represents a hole in homology. In fact, the four points and all their connecting edges and faces form a tetrahedron (a 3-simplex), which is contractible and has no holes. Thus, $\\beta_1(\\epsilon_3) = 0$.\n\nSummary of results:\n- For $\\epsilon_1 = 1.6$: $(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = (2, 0)$\n- For $\\epsilon_2 = 2.1$: $(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = (1, 1)$\n- For $\\epsilon_3 = 2.6$: $(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = (1, 0)$\n\nThe requested final answer is the row matrix $(\\beta_0(\\epsilon_1), \\beta_1(\\epsilon_1), \\beta_0(\\epsilon_2), \\beta_1(\\epsilon_2), \\beta_0(\\epsilon_3), \\beta_1(\\epsilon_3))$.\nThis corresponds to $(2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1457473"}, {"introduction": "While building a filtration step-by-step is instructive, in practice, the entire process is summarized in a persistence barcode.

To simplify the model, the spatial location is represented by a single coordinate $x$ in kilometers along a transportation corridor, and time $t$ is measured in days from the first observation. The five cases, labeled $P_1$ through $P_5$, are given by the following $(x, t)$ coordinates:\n$P_1 = (1, 2)$\n$P_2 = (3, 1)$\n$P_3 = (10, 8)$\n$P_4 = (8, 10)$\n$P_5 = (6, 6)$\n\nTo quantify the clustering of these cases, you will perform a persistent homology analysis on this dataset. The \"distance\" between any two cases, $P_i=(x_i, t_i)$ and $P_j=(x_j, t_j)$, is defined using the Chebyshev distance (or max-norm), given by $d(P_i, P_j) = \\max(|x_i - x_j|, |t_i - t_j|)$.\n\nThe analysis focuses on 0-dimensional homology features ($H_0$), which correspond to connected components.

When a new edge connects two previously disconnected components, they merge. To maintain a clear lineage, a standard rule is applied: the component associated with the higher-indexed point merges into the component associated with the lower-indexed point. For example, if an edge connects the component containing $P_3$ to the component containing $P_5$, the component of $P_5$ dies and merges with that of $P_3$. The \"death\" time of the dying component is the value of $\\epsilon$ at which the merger occurs.\n4.  One component, associated with the lowest-indexed point of the final merged set, will never die.
