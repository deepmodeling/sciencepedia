One of the simplest measures is degree centrality, defined as the total number of direct connections (edges) a node has to other nodes in the network. A node with a high degree is often considered a \"hub\" and can be critical to the network's function.\n\nConsider a highly simplified model of a small neural circuit composed of seven distinct neurons, labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.

This question is at the heart of the Barabási-Albert model, which proposes a \"rich-get-richer\" growth mechanism known as preferential attachment. This practice allows you to simulate network growth step-by-step, calculating the probability of new connections based on existing node degrees [@problem_id:1464920]. By doing so, you will gain an intuitive feel for the dynamic process that gives rise to the hubs observed in many real-world biological and social networks.", "problem": "The growth of many complex networks, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, can be modeled using a \"preferential attachment\" mechanism, famously captured by the Barabási-Albert model. In this model, new nodes are added to an existing network and are more likely to form links with nodes that already have a high number of connections (high degree).\n\nConsider a small, developing PPI network. Initially, the network consists of a seed of three proteins: P1, P2, and P3. The interactions are such that P1 is connected only to P2, and P3 is connected only to P2, forming a linear chain P1-P2-P3.\n\nNow, two new proteins, P4 and P5, are introduced into the system and integrate into the network *sequentially*. First, P4 is added, and then P5 is added to the resulting network. Each new protein forms exactly one interaction ($m=1$) with one of the proteins already present. The probability that a new protein will connect to an existing protein $i$ is directly proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that protein (i.e., the number of interactions it already has). This probability can be expressed as $P_i = \\frac{k_i}{\\sum_j k_j}$, where the sum is over all proteins $j$ currently in the network.\n\nCalculate the exact probability that after both P4 and P5 have been added to the network, the protein P2 has a final degree of 4. Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "Initially the network is the chain P1–P2–P3 with degrees $k_{1}=1$, $k_{2}=2$, $k_{3}=1$. The total degree is $\\sum_{j}k_{j}=4$. Under preferential attachment with $m=1$, the probability that a new node connects to node $i$ is $P_{i}=\\frac{k_{i}}{\\sum_{j}k_{j}}$.\n\nFor P4’s attachment:\n- $P(\\text{P4}\\to\\text{P2})=\\frac{k_{2}}{4}=\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo end with $\\deg(\\text{P2})=4$, P2 must receive both new links, since P2 starts with degree $2$ and each of P4 and P5 contributes exactly one edge. Therefore the required event is that P4 connects to P2 and, subsequently, P5 connects to P2.\n\nCondition on P4 having attached to P2. After this, degrees become $k_{1}=1$, $k_{2}=3$, $k_{3}=1$, $k_{4}=1$, so the total degree is $\\sum_{j}k_{j}=6$. Then for P5’s attachment:\n- $P(\\text{P5}\\to\\text{P2}\\mid \\text{P4}\\to\\text{P2})=\\frac{k_{2}}{6}=\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus the exact probability that both P4 and P5 attach to P2, yielding final $\\deg(\\text{P2})=4$, is\n$$\nP=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nNo other sequence of attachments can raise P2’s degree from $2$ to $4$ with only two new edges, so this result is exact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1464920"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of scale-free networks is that their degree distribution follows a power law, often expressed as $P(k) \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$.

The degree distribution, $P(k)$, is the fraction of all employees in the network that have a degree of $k$.\n\nFor many complex networks, it is hypothesized that the degree distribution follows a specific pattern.
