The local clustering coefficient for a given neuron is defined as the number of actual connections that exist between its neighbors, divided by the maximum possible number of connections that could exist between them.\n\nExpress your final answer as a fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "Each neuron has degree $k=20$, connecting to the $m=10$ nearest neighbors on each side along the ring. For the local clustering coefficient of an arbitrary neuron, we need:\n1) the maximum possible number of connections among its $k$ neighbors, and\n2) the actual number of connections among those neighbors in this lattice.\n\nThe maximum possible number of connections among $k$ neighbors is\n$$\nE_{\\text{max}}=\\binom{k}{2}=\\binom{20}{2}=190.\n$$\n\nTo count the actual number $E_{\\text{actual}}$ of connections among the neighbors, label the neighbors by offsets relative to the focal neuron as $\\{-10,-9,\\dots,-1,1,2,\\dots,10\\}$. In this ring lattice, two neighbors at offsets $a$ and $b$ are connected if and only if their ring distance is at most $m=10$. Because $N=500$ is much larger than $k$, the relevant ring distance between two neighbors is simply $|a-b|$.

It is assumed that $N$ is large, $k$ is an even integer, and $N > k$.\n\nThe rewiring process is then applied as follows: for each node $i$ (from $i=0$ to $N-1$), every edge connecting it to its $k/2$ clockwise neighbors is considered one at a time. Each of these edges is rewired with a probability $p$. If an edge $(i, j)$ is chosen for rewiring, it is replaced with a new edge $(i, m)$, where the new target node $m$ is chosen uniformly at random from all possible nodes, with the constraints that $m \\neq i$ and that a duplicate edge $(i, m)$ is not created.
