This process incurs a metabolic cost $c > 0$. The total amount of nutrient made available by a single producer's enzymatic action corresponds to a benefit $b > 0$.\n2.  **Cheaters (C):** These bacteria do not produce the enzyme and thus incur no cost. They can, however, consume the nutrient made available by Producers.\n\nWe model the interaction between any two bacteria in the population. The benefit from the breakdown of the polymer is distributed as follows: a fraction $\\alpha$ (where $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$) of the benefit generated by a producer is private and consumed only by that producer. The remaining fraction $(1-\\alpha)$ becomes a public good, shared equally between the two interacting individuals.\n\nThe payoff for an individual is defined as the total benefit it receives minus any cost it incurs.

For the 'Producer' strategy to be an ESS, the cost-to-benefit ratio, $c/b$, must be strictly less than a certain threshold value, which may depend on the privacy factor $\\alpha$.\n\nDetermine this threshold value for the cost-to-benefit ratio, $c/b$.

This prevents initial invasion of the mutant. The second condition covers the case where the mutant performs equally well against the ESS population, and requires that the ESS strategy must do better against the mutant than the mutant does against itself.\n\nLet's check these conditions for strategy P against the mutant strategy C.\n\n**Check Condition 1:**\nWe test if $E(P, P) > E(C, P)$.\n$$b - c > \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\alpha)b$$\nWe want to find the condition on the cost-to-benefit ratio, $c/b$. Rearranging the inequality:\n$$b - \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\alpha)b > c$$\n$$b \\left(1 - \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2}\\right) > c$$\n$$b \\left(\\frac{2 - 1 + \\alpha}{2}\\right) > c$$\n$$b \\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}\\right) > c$$\nDividing by $b$ (which is positive):\n$$\\frac{c}{b}  \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$$\nIf this strict inequality holds, strategy P is an ESS. The problem asks for the threshold value which $c/b$ must be less than. This threshold is $\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the boundary case**\nFor completeness, let's analyze what happens when the first condition is not strictly met, i.e., when $E(P, P) = E(C, P)$. This occurs when $\\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$.\nIn this case, we must check Condition 2: $E(P, C) > E(C, C)$.\n$$E(P, C) = \\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}\\right)b - c$$\nSince we are at the boundary where $\\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$, we can substitute $c = (\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2})b$:\n$$E(P, C) = \\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}\\right)b - \\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}\\right)b = 0$$\nAnd we know $E(C, C) = 0$.\nSo, at the boundary, $E(P, C) = E(C, C)$. The strict inequality required by Condition 2 is not met. Therefore, P is not an ESS when $\\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$.\n\nThus, for P to be an ESS, the ratio $c/b$ must be strictly less than $\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$. The threshold value is therefore this expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}}$$", "id": "1432865"}, {"introduction": "Real biological interactions are often more complex than two-player duels with discrete choices.

Each individual $i$ can choose to contribute a fraction $x_i$ of its resources, where $x_i \\in [0, 1]$, to the production of a public good. The cost to an individual for making a contribution $x_i$ is linear and given by $C(x_i) = c x_i$, where $c$ is a positive constant representing the per-unit cost of contribution.\n\nThe contributions from all individuals in the population are pooled, resulting in a total contribution $X = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_j$. The benefit from this public good is shared equally among all $N$ individuals. This benefit exhibits saturation, meaning its effect diminishes as the total contribution increases.

This means that if the resident strategy is $x_r = x^*$, then the strategy $x_m$ that maximizes the mutant's payoff must be $x_m = x^*$. To find the optimal strategy for the mutant, we need to maximize $W(x_m, x_r)$ with respect to $x_m$.
