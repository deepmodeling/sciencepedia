This exercise [@problem_id:1433024] provides a quantitative foundation for understanding how selective pressures in the environment drive the rise and fall of genetic traits within a population.", "problem": "A population of bacteria is growing in a culture. The population consists of two strains: a wild-type strain (W) and a strain (P) that carries a plasmid.\n\nThe wild-type strain W has an intrinsic growth rate of $r_0$.\nThe P strain's plasmid imposes a metabolic burden, reducing its intrinsic growth rate by a constant amount $c$. Hence, its growth rate is $r_0 - c$. Both $r_0$ and $c$ are positive constants, with $r_0 > c$.\n\nAn antibiotic is introduced into the culture. This antibiotic has no effect on the P strain, as the plasmid provides complete resistance. However, it induces a constant death rate, $d_a$, for the wild-type W strain. The net growth rate of a strain is its intrinsic growth rate minus any death rate.\n\nLet $N_W(t)$ and $N_P(t)$ be the number of bacteria of the W and P strains at time $t$, respectively. The evolutionary success of the P strain can be measured by the change in its proportion within the total population, $f_P(t) = \\frac{N_P(t)}{N_W(t) + N_P(t)}$.\n\nAssuming that at $t=0$, both strains are present ($N_W(0) > 0$ and $N_P(0) > 0$), determine the critical value of the death rate $d_a$ above which the proportion of the P strain, $f_P(t)$, is guaranteed to increase over time.

The wild-type strain W experiences intrinsic growth rate $r_{0}$ and an antibiotic-induced death rate $d_{a}$, so its net growth rate is $r_{W}=r_{0}-d_{a}$. The plasmid-bearing strain P has intrinsic growth rate reduced by $c$, no antibiotic effect, so its net growth rate is $r_{P}=r_{0}-c$. By assumption, $r_{0}>c>0$.\n\nWith constant per capita rates, each subpopulation follows exponential growth:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{W}}{dt}=r_{W}N_{W},\\quad \\frac{dN_{P}}{dt}=r_{P}N_{P}.\n$$\nSolving these with $N_{W}(0)>0$ and $N_{P}(0)>0$ gives\n$$\nN_{W}(t)=N_{W}(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big((r_{0}-d_{a})t\\big),\\quad\nN_{P}(t)=N_{P}(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big((r_{0}-c)t\\big).\n$$\n\nDefine the proportion $f_{P}(t)=\\frac{N_{P}(t)}{N_{W}(t)+N_{P}(t)}$.
