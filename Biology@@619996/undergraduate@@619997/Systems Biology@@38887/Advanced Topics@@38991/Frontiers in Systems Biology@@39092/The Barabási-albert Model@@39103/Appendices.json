The Barabási-Albert (BA) model is a well-known algorithm for generating random scale-free networks that exhibit properties observed in many natural systems. This model works by a process of incremental growth, where new nodes are added one by one.\n\nAccording to the BA model, when a new node is added to the network, the probability $\\Pi_i$ that it will connect to an existing node $i$ is directly proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that node. The degree of a node is the number of links it has to other nodes.\n\nConsider a small, hypothetical PPI network that is in an early stage of development. It currently consists of four proteins: P1, P2, P3, and P4. The degrees of these proteins are $k_1 = 4$, $k_2 = 3$, $k_3 = 2$, and $k_4 = 1$, respectively.\n\nA new protein, P5, is introduced and will form exactly one connection to one of the four existing proteins, following the rules of the BA model.\n\nCalculate the probability that this new protein, P5, will connect to protein P1.

New nodes form connections to existing nodes based on the principle of preferential attachment. Specifically, the probability $P(i)$ that a new node will connect to an existing node $i$ is proportional to the degree $k_i$ (the number of connections) of that node, given by the formula:\n$$P(i) = \\frac{k_i}{\\sum_{j} k_j}$$\nwhere the sum is over all nodes $j$ already in the network.\n\nConsider a network that starts at time $t=0$ with an initial set of $m_0 = 3$ nodes, labeled 1, 2, and 3. These nodes are connected in a linear chain, meaning Node 1 is connected to Node 2, and Node 2 is connected to Node 3.\n\nThe network then evolves over two time steps. At $t=1$, a new node, Node 4, is added and forms exactly $m=1$ connection to one of the existing nodes. At $t=2$, another new node, Node 5, is added and also forms exactly $m=1$ connection. In each step, the connection is chosen according to the preferential attachment rule described above, based on the degrees of the nodes present just before the new connection is made.\n\nCalculate the numerical probability that after these two steps are complete, the final network has the exact set of edges {(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)}.

Hence the degrees are $k_{1}=1$, $k_{2}=2$, $k_{3}=1$, and the total degree is $\\sum_{j}k_{j}=4$.\n\nAt $t=1$, Node 4 chooses a node to attach to with probabilities proportional to degree.

The simulation starts with a small, connected network of initial papers. At each time step, a new paper is added, and it forms a single citation link to one of the existing papers. The core principle of the model is preferential attachment: the probability that the new paper cites an existing paper is proportional to the number of citations that existing paper already has (its in-degree).\n\nSuppose the simulation has reached a state where there are four existing papers in the network, which we will call P1, P2, P3, and P4.
