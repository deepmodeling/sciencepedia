The topology of such a network can determine its robustness, which is its ability to maintain function despite the failure or removal of some of its components. Many biological networks exhibit a structure characterized by the presence of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many nodes with few connections. This structure can make them resilient to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks on their hubs.\n\nConsider a hypothetical PPI network consisting of ten proteins, represented by the set of nodes $V = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6, P_7, P_8, P_9, P_{10}\\}$.
