In pharmacology, dose-response curves for viability versus concentration are typically sigmoidal when plotted against the logarithm of concentration. This arises from standard receptor or enzyme inhibition models such as the Hill equation,\n$$\nE(C) = E_{\\min} + \\frac{E_{\\max} - E_{\\min}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{IC_{50}}\\right)^{n}},\n$$\nwhich, when viewed as a function of $\\log_{10}(C)$, produces an S-shaped curve that spreads informative regions across the range of concentrations.\n\nThe experimental concentrations span orders of magnitude, specifically $0.01$, $0.1$, $1$, $10$, and $100$, which cover four decades on the concentration axis. Using a linear x-axis would cluster most points near zero and obscure differences at low concentrations, whereas a logarithmic x-axis $\\log_{10}(C)$ spaces these values evenly and reveals the characteristic sigmoidal transition and the relative potency (shift along the x-axis) for each cell line.\n\nFor the y-axis representing cell viability, a linear scale is appropriate because the measured quantity is bounded between $0$ and $100$ and may approach $0$, for which a logarithmic scale would be undefined and distort comparisons near low viability. A linear y-axis preserves direct interpretability of differences in viability across concentrations.\n\nTo compare multiple cell lines within a single plot, each cell line must be visually distinguishable. This requires plotting each as a separate series with distinct colors and marker styles, and including a legend to identify them. Without such differentiation, the points would be conflated and the comparative analysis would be impaired.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A uses a logarithmic x-axis for concentration and a linear y-axis for viability, plots each cell line as a distinct series with unique color and marker, and includes a legend. This adheres to the principles above and is the most informative.\n- Option B uses linear scales on both axes, which is suboptimal given the multiple orders of magnitude in concentration and the sigmoidal nature of dose-response curves versus $\\log_{10}(C)$.\n- Option C uses a logarithmic x-axis but fails to distinguish the three cell lines by using the same color and marker and omitting a legend, which prevents effective comparison.\n- Option D uses a grouped bar chart, which is not appropriate for a continuous dose variable, hides the sigmoidal trend, and adds clutter.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and informative method is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1426469"}, {"introduction": "For a measurement to be considered quantitative, its signal must be directly proportional to the amount of substance being measured.
