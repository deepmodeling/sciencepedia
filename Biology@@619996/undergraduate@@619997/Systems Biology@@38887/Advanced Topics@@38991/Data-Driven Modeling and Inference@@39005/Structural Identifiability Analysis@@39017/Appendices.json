This exercise explores one of the simplest and most common forms of structural non-identifiability, where the mathematical structure of the model equation itself makes it impossible to distinguish between individual parameters. By analyzing a simple bimolecular reaction, you will discover the concept of a \"lumped parameter,\" a composite term that is identifiable even when its individual components are not [@problem_id:1468734].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is characterizing a simple engineered gene circuit in a bacterium. In this circuit, an activator protein, denoted as $A$, binds to a specific promoter region, denoted as $P$, on a plasmid. This binding event initiates the transcription of a reporter gene, producing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The rate of transcription initiation, $v$, is assumed to follow a simple bimolecular law:\n$$v = k \\cdot c_A \\cdot c_P$$\nwhere $k$ is the intrinsic association rate constant, $c_A$ is the intracellular concentration of the activator protein $A$, and $c_P$ is the intracellular concentration of the promoter region $P$.\n\nThe biologist can design an experiment where the concentration of the activator, $c_A$, can be precisely controlled and varied. The resulting transcription rate, $v$, can be measured by observing the rate of increase in fluorescence. However, the concentration of the promoter, $c_P$, while constant throughout the experiment (as it is determined by the stable plasmid copy number in the cell population), is unknown and difficult to measure directly.\n\nThe primary goal of the experiment is to determine the value of the intrinsic rate constant $k$. Based on this experimental setup—where $c_A$ is the independent variable and $v$ is the measured dependent variable—which of the following statements about the determination of $k$ is correct?\n\nA. The constant $k$ can be uniquely determined from the experimental data.\n\nB. Neither $k$ nor any combination of parameters involving $k$ can be determined.\n\nC. The constant $k$ cannot be uniquely determined, but the product $k \\cdot c_P$ can be determined as a single lumped parameter.\n\nD. The constant $k$ cannot be uniquely determined, but the ratio $\\frac{k}{c_P}$ can be determined as a single lumped parameter.\n\nE. The constant $k$ can be determined only if the experiment is repeated at two different but known temperatures.", "solution": "We begin with the stated mass-action kinetics for transcription initiation under a simple bimolecular association between activator $A$ and promoter $P$:\n$$\nv = k \\, c_{A} \\, c_{P},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the intrinsic association rate constant, $c_{A}$ is the controllable intracellular concentration of activator $A$, and $c_{P}$ is the (unknown) but constant intracellular concentration of promoter $P$ during the experiment.\n\nBecause $c_{A}$ is varied by design and $v$ is measured, while $c_{P}$ remains constant but unknown, we can rearrange the relationship as a linear function of $c_{A}$:\n$$\nv(c_{A}) = \\left(k \\, c_{P}\\right) \\, c_{A}.\n$$\nThis shows that $v$ is proportional to $c_{A}$ with slope equal to the lumped parameter $k \\, c_{P}$. Therefore, by fitting the measured $(c_{A}, v)$ data to a straight line through the origin, the experiment determines the slope\n$$\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{v}{c_{A}} = k \\, c_{P}.\n$$\nSince $c_{P}$ is unknown and not measured, the intrinsic constant $k$ itself cannot be uniquely determined from these data alone. However, the product $k \\, c_{P}$ is identifiable and can be determined as a single lumped parameter.\n\nTo assess alternative statements: \n- Unique identification of $k$ (option A) fails because $k$ and $c_{P}$ are confounded multiplicatively in the model.\n- The claim that no parameter combination is determinable (option B) is false because $k \\, c_{P}$ is directly determined as the slope.\n- The ratio $\\frac{k}{c_{P}}$ (option D) does not appear in the linear relation; instead, $\\frac{v}{c_{A}} = k \\, c_{P}$, so the ratio is not identifiable.\n- Repeating at two known temperatures (option E) would provide two slopes $s_{1} = k_{1} c_{P}$ and $s_{2} = k_{2} c_{P}$, which allows determining only the ratio $\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}} = \\frac{s_{1}}{s_{2}}$ under the assumption that $c_{P}$ is unchanged across temperatures, but not the absolute value of $k$ without independent knowledge of $c_{P}$ or an additional, independently calibrated relation (e.g., an Arrhenius law with known parameters). Thus, this does not enable unique determination of $k$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $k$ cannot be uniquely determined, but the product $k \\, c_{P}$ can be determined as a single lumped parameter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1468734"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how parameters can be unidentifiable, we now turn to a more optimistic scenario. Can we design experiments specifically to make parameters identifiable? This practice problem investigates this question using a classic Michaelis-Menten-like model for gene expression [@problem_id:1468728]. You will see that by applying a known, time-varying input and observing the system's response, it is possible to uniquely determine both the maximum reaction rate $k$ and the affinity constant $K$, demonstrating the power of thoughtful experimental design in overcoming identifiability challenges.", "problem": "A systems biologist is developing a mathematical model for gene expression. The synthesis of a protein product, $P$, is activated by a transcription factor (TF). The model proposes that the rate of production of $P$ follows a saturating kinetic law dependent on the concentration of the active form of the TF, denoted as $[TF]$. The governing differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \\frac{k \\cdot [TF]}{K + [TF]} $$\nHere, $[P]$ is the concentration of the protein product, $k$ is the maximum possible rate of protein synthesis, and $K$ is the Michaelis-like constant representing the concentration of the TF at which the synthesis rate is half of its maximum.\n\nIn an ideal experiment, a researcher can precisely control the concentration of the transcription factor over time, applying a known input perturbation $[TF](t)$. Simultaneously, they can measure the resulting concentration of the protein product, $[P](t)$, perfectly and continuously, without any noise. The goal is to determine the values of the model parameters $k$ and $K$ from these ideal measurements. This property is known as structural identifiability.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly assesses the structural identifiability of the parameters $k$ and $K$ under the conditions of this ideal experiment?\n\nA. Yes, both parameters are identifiable because a time-varying input allows observation of the production rate at multiple different concentrations of the transcription factor.\n\nB. No, only the ratio $k/K$ is identifiable. This is because at low concentrations of the transcription factor, the rate is approximately linear with a slope of $k/K$, and the experiment cannot distinguish the individual parameters beyond this ratio.\n\nC. No, neither parameter is identifiable, because measuring the product concentration $[P](t)$ only provides information about the integral of the synthesis rate, not the instantaneous rate itself.\n\nD. Yes, but only if the input perturbation $[TF](t)$ is specifically a sinusoidal function, as this is the only way to sufficiently excite all the system's dynamic modes.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine the identifiability without knowing the exact numerical values of $k$ and $K$ that govern the real biological system.", "solution": "We are given the model\n$$\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt}=\\frac{k\\,[TF](t)}{K+[TF](t)}.\n$$\nUnder ideal conditions, the input $[TF](t)$ is known and continuously controlled, and $[P](t)$ is measured perfectly and continuously. Because $[P](t)$ is known continuously and without noise, its time derivative is known exactly, so define\n$$\nr(t)=\\frac{d[P]}{dt},\n$$\nwhich is thus known for all $t$. Therefore, the observations provide the input-output relation\n$$\nr(t)=\\frac{k\\,u(t)}{K+u(t)},\\quad \\text{with }u(t)=[TF](t),\n$$\nfor all $t$. Hence, for every time $t$, we observe a pair $\\big(u(t),r(t)\\big)$ satisfying the algebraic Michaelis-Menten relation.\n\nTo assess structural identifiability, suppose two parameter sets $(k_{1},K_{1})$ and $(k_{2},K_{2})$ generate the same input-output relation for the same input $u(t)$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\frac{k_{1}\\,u(t)}{K_{1}+u(t)}=\\frac{k_{2}\\,u(t)}{K_{2}+u(t)}\\quad \\text{for all }t.\n$$\nAssume the experiment uses a time-varying input so that $u(t)$ takes infinitely many values and is not identically zero.

Therefore, the parameters are globally structurally identifiable from the input-output data, provided the input $u(t)$ takes more than one value (which the ideal, controllable, time-varying input guarantees).\n\nAn equivalent constructive argument comes from the linearizing transformation.

With a time-varying input producing multiple distinct $u$ values, both $k$ and $K$ are uniquely determined.\n\nTherefore, both parameters $k$ and $K$ are structurally identifiable under the stated ideal conditions. This directly supports option A, while:\n- Option B is incorrect because the intercept $1/k$ is identifiable, not only the ratio $k/K$.\n- Option C is incorrect because perfect continuous measurement makes $r(t)=d[P]/dt$ directly available.\n- Option D is incorrect because sinusoidal excitation is unnecessary; any sufficiently varying input providing multiple $u$ values suffices.\n- Option E is incorrect because structural identifiability does not depend on the specific numerical values of the parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1468728"}, {"introduction": "Our analysis so far has focused on the model's equations and the experimental inputs.
