The degradation of P is modeled using a first-order kinetic equation, where the concentration of the protein over time is described by $[P](t) = [P]_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{deg}} t)$. The crucial parameter in this model is the degradation rate constant, $k_{\\text{deg}}$.\n\nTo estimate $k_{\\text{deg}}$ and its uncertainty from experimental data, the researcher employs the method of profile likelihood. In practice, it is often more convenient to work with a chi-squared-like statistic derived from the profile likelihood (such as -2 log-likelihood), which is minimized at the best-fit value. We will denote this statistic as $PL(k_{\\text{deg}})$. The confidence interval for an estimated parameter can be determined from this profile. For a single parameter, the approximate 95% confidence interval is given by the set of parameter values $\\theta$ that satisfy the inequality $PL(\\theta) \\le PL(\\hat{\\theta}) + \\Delta_{\\alpha}$, where $PL(\\hat{\\theta})$ is the minimum value of this statistic (corresponding to the best-fit parameter estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$). The threshold $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$ is derived from the chi-squared distribution.
