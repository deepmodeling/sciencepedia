{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In high-throughput fields like genomics and proteomics, we often test thousands of hypotheses simultaneously. This massive number of tests dramatically increases the probability of finding 'significant' results purely by chance. This exercise introduces the Bonferroni correction, a foundational method for controlling the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)—the probability of making even a single false discovery. By working through this problem, you will gain a practical understanding of how to adjust significance thresholds in the face of multiple comparisons and appreciate the stringent nature of this classic approach [@problem_id:1450318].", "problem": "A team of pharmacologists is investigating the cellular response to a newly developed anti-cancer drug. They perform a large-scale quantitative proteomics experiment using mass spectrometry to compare protein expression levels in cancer cells treated with the drug versus a control group of untreated cells. The experiment simultaneously measures the abundance of 5,000 distinct proteins.\n\nFor each protein, a statistical test is conducted to determine if its expression level has changed significantly due to the drug treatment. The team wants to control the probability of making at least one false discovery (a Type I error) across all 5,000 tests. They decide to maintain a strict Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) of 0.05. To achieve this, they will use the Bonferroni correction to adjust the significance threshold for each individual protein test.\n\nCalculate the new significance threshold, often denoted as $\\alpha'$, that must be used for each of the 5,000 individual statistical tests. Express your answer in scientific notation, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We want to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) at level $\\alpha=0.05$ across $m=5000$ independent hypothesis tests.

To address this, scientists developed the concept of the False Discovery Rate (FDR), which aims to control the expected *proportion* of false positives among all significant findings. This exercise provides a hands-on walkthrough of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, a powerful and widely adopted method for controlling the FDR, allowing for a more balanced approach between discovery and error control [@problem_id:1450361].", "problem": "A systems biologist is conducting a metabolomics experiment to identify changes in metabolite concentrations in response to a new drug treatment.
