The proteins are: a regulatory Kinase Alpha (KA), an effector Kinase Beta (KB), a counteracting Phosphatase Gamma (PG), and a downstream Transcription Factor Delta (TFD). To infer the regulatory relationships, a Pearson correlation analysis was performed on the time-series activity data for each protein.

The hypothesis is that GENE1, which codes for a transcription factor, regulates the expression of GENE2. To test this, the researcher collects 10 pairs of simultaneous expression level measurements for both genes from 10 different cell cultures. After analyzing the data, the Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) between the expression levels of GENE1 and GENE2 is calculated to be $r = 0.720$.\n\nThe researcher decides to test the statistical significance of this correlation at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.
