This practice will reveal the fascinating phenomenon of \"explaining away,\" where evidence for one cause can reduce the likelihood of another.", "problem": "In systems biology, gene regulatory networks are often modeled using probabilistic graphical models. Consider a simple network motif known as a Coherent Type-1 Feed-Forward Loop (FFL), which involves three genes: a master regulator gene `A`, and two target genes, `B` and `C`. The regulatory interactions are as follows:\n1.  Gene `A` activates the expression of Gene `B`.\n2.  Gene `A` activates the expression of Gene `C`.\n3.  Gene `B` also activates the expression of Gene `C`.\n\nThe state of each gene can be either \"active\" (represented by 1) or \"inactive\" (represented by 0).

The joint probability of the three variables is given by:\n$$P(A, B, C) = P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A, B)$$\n\nUsing this structure, we can write the terms we need:\n-   For the case where all three are active:\n    $$P(A, B, C) = P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A, B)$$\n-   For the case where A and C are active, but B is inactive:\n    $$P(A, \\neg B, C) = P(A) P(\\neg B|A) P(C|A, \\neg B)$$\n\nNow we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $P(B | A, C)$:\n$$P(B | A, C) = \\frac{P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A, B)}{P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A, B) + P(A) P(\\neg B|A) P(C|A, \\neg B)}$$\n\nThe term $P(A)$, the prior probability of gene A being active, conveniently cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$P(B | A, C) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(C|A, B)}{P(B|A) P(C|A, B) + P(\\neg B|A) P(C|A, \\neg B)}$$\n\nWe are given the following values from the problem statement:\n-   $P(B|A) = P(B=1|A=1) = 0.80$\n-   $P(C|A, B) = P(C=1|A=1, B=1) = 0.95$\n-   $P(C|A, \\neg B) = P(C=1|A=1, B=0) = 0.50$\n\nWe also need $P(\\neg B|A)$, which is the probability that B is inactive given A is active. This can be calculated as:\n$$P(\\neg B|A) = P(B=0|A=1) = 1 - P(B=1|A=1) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into our final expression:\n$$P(B | A, C) = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.95}{(0.80 \\times 0.95) + (0.20 \\times 0.50)}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the products:\n-   Numerator: $0.80 \\times 0.95 = 0.76$\n-   Second term in the denominator: $0.20 \\times 0.50 = 0.10$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the fraction:\n$$P(B | A, C) = \\frac{0.76}{0.76 + 0.10} = \\frac{0.76}{0.86}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the decimal value and round to three significant figures:\n$$\\frac{0.76}{0.86} \\approx 0.8837209...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.884$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.884}$$", "id": "1418697"}]}
