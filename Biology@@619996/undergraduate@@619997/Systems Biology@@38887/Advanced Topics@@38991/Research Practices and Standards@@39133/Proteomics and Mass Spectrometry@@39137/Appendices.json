In this analytical technique, peptide molecules are ionized, typically by the addition of protons, and the resulting ions are separated by a mass spectrometer based on their mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$). The spectrum produced for this peptide displays a characteristic isotopic cluster. The most abundant peak in this cluster, which corresponds to the monoisotopic species (containing the most common isotopes like $^{12}\\text{C}$, $^{14}\\text{N}$, and $^{16}\\text{O}$), is observed at an $m/z$ value of $490.4698$.

Express your answer in Daltons (Da), rounded to six significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the monoisotopic mass of a neutral peptide from the mass-to-charge ratios ($m/z$) of two adjacent isotopic peaks observed in an Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) experiment.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the charge state, $z$, of the peptide ion. In ESI-MS, an isotopic cluster arises from the natural abundance of heavy isotopes (like $^{13}\\text{C}$). The $m/z$ separation between adjacent peaks in such a cluster is determined by the mass difference of the isotopes ($\\Delta M$) and the charge state ($z$) of the ion. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{\\Delta M}{z} $$\nIn this problem, the two adjacent peaks correspond to the monoisotopic peptide and the peptide with one $^{13}\\text{C}$ atom. Therefore, the mass difference $\\Delta M$ is the mass difference between a $^{13}\\text{C}$ and a $^{12}\\text{C}$ atom, which is given as $\\Delta m_C = 1.00335$ Da. The observed $m/z$ values for the monoisotopic peak and the first isotopic peak are $m_0/z = 490.4698$ and $m_1/z = 490.7206$, respectively.\n\nThe separation in $m/z$ is:\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = (m_1/z) - (m_0/z) = 490.7206 - 490.4698 = 0.2508 $$\nNow we can rearrange the separation formula to solve for the charge state $z$:\n$$ z = \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\Delta(m/z)} = \\frac{\\Delta m_C}{\\Delta(m/z)} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ z = \\frac{1.00335}{0.2508} \\approx 3.99900319 $$\nSince the charge state of an ion must be an integer, we round this value to the nearest integer, which gives $z = 4$.\n\nNext, we can determine the mass of the neutral peptide. The observed $m/z$ for an ion is related to its molecular mass ($M$) and charge ($z$). In ESI, ionization is achieved by adding $z$ protons (each with mass $m_p$) to the neutral molecule. Thus, the mass of the ion is $M_{\\text{ion}} = M_{\\text{neutral}} + z \\cdot m_p$. The mass-to-charge ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{M_{\\text{neutral}} + z \\cdot m_p}{z} $$\nWe can use the data for the monoisotopic peak, where $m/z = m_0/z = 490.4698$, and the mass is the monoisotopic mass of the neutral peptide, $M_{\\text{mono}}$.\n$$ 490.4698 = \\frac{M_{\\text{mono}} + 4 \\cdot m_p}{4} $$\nTo find $M_{\\text{mono}}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ M_{\\text{mono}} = 4 \\cdot (490.4698) - 4 \\cdot m_p $$\n$$ M_{\\text{mono}} = 4 \\cdot (490.4698 - m_p) $$\nSubstituting the value for the mass of a proton, $m_p = 1.00728$ Da:\n$$ M_{\\text{mono}} = 4 \\cdot (490.4698 - 1.00728) $$\n$$ M_{\\text{mono}} = 4 \\cdot (489.46252) $$\n$$ M_{\\text{mono}} = 1957.85008 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the answer to be rounded to six significant figures. The calculated value is $1957.85008$. The first six significant figures are 1, 9, 5, 7, 8, and 5.
