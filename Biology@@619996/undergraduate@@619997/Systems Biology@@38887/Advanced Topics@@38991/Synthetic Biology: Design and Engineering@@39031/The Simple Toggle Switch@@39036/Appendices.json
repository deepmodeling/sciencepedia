The concentration of Protein 1 is denoted by $P_1$ and the concentration of Protein 2 by $P_2$.\n\nIn a wild-type organism, the dynamics of the protein concentrations are well-described by the following system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dP_1}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha_1}{1 + (P_2/K_2)^{n}} - \\gamma_1 P_1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP_2}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha_2}{1 + (P_1/K_1)^{m}} - \\gamma_2 P_2\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are the maximal synthesis rates for Protein 1 and Protein 2.
