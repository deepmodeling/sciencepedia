The total concentration of this transcription factor, $TF_{tot} = TF_{i} + TF_{a}$, remains constant within the cell.\n\nThe dynamics of the circuit under continuous illumination are modeled by the following set of rules:\n\n1.  **Activation:** The inactive transcription factor $TF_{i}$ is converted to its active form $TF_{a}$ by light. This is a first-order process where the rate of formation of $TF_{a}$ is given by $k_{act} TF_{i}$. The constant $k_{act}$ depends on the intensity of the incident light.\n2.  **Reversion:** The active form $TF_{a}$ spontaneously reverts back to the inactive form $TF_{i}$ through a thermal process.

The concentration of GFP is denoted by $P$. The rate of synthesis of the protein is directly proportional to the concentration of the active transcription factor, given by $k_{p} TF_{a}$.\n4.  **Protein Removal:** The GFP is cleared from the cell through a combination of enzymatic degradation and dilution due to cell division.

This circuit utilizes a light-sensitive transcription factor that activates a promoter upon illumination with blue light, leading to the production of a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). The concentration of YFP, which serves as a reporter for gene expression, is assumed to be directly proportional to the measured fluorescence intensity of the bacterial culture at steady state.\n\nThe team performs a series of experiments to determine the input-output characteristics of the circuit. They obtain the following steady-state fluorescence measurements:\n\n1.  When the bacterial culture is maintained in complete darkness, the background fluorescence is measured to be $F_{dark}$. This value represents the basal or 'leaky' expression level of the circuit.\n2.  When the culture is illuminated with a very high intensity of blue light, such that the system is fully saturated and further increases in light intensity produce no additional fluorescence, the steady-state fluorescence is measured to be $F_{light}$.\n3.  As part of the characterization, a measurement is also taken at a moderate light intensity, $I_M$. At this intensity, the steady-state fluorescence is recorded as $F_M$, where it is known that $F_{dark} < F_M < F_{light}$.\n\nThe dynamic range is a crucial metric for evaluating the performance of such a switch-like system. It is defined as the ratio of the total expression level in the fully induced (light-saturated) state to the basal expression level in the uninduced (dark) state.\n\nBased on the experimental measurements, derive an expression for the dynamic range of this optogenetic system in terms of the parameters $F_{dark}$ and $F_{light}$.", "solution": "Let $D$ be the dynamic range of the optogenetic system.

Let $E$ be the expression level (YFP concentration) and $F$ be the measured fluorescence. We can write this proportionality as:\n$$\nE = kF\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant depends on factors like the quantum yield of the fluorophore and the specific settings of the measurement instrument.\n\nThe uninduced state corresponds to the condition of complete darkness.
