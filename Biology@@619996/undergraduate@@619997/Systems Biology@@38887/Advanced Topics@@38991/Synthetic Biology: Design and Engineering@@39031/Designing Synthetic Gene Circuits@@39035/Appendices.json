The experimental setup consists of a plasmid designed to express a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This plasmid contains a constitutive promoter with a constant transcription rate $\\alpha$. Downstream of the promoter is a cloning site where different RBSs from a library can be inserted, followed by the coding sequence for GFP.\n\nThe dynamics of the circuit within a host cell can be described by a simplified model for the concentration of the GFP messenger RNA (mRNA), denoted as $[m]$, and the concentration of the GFP protein, denoted as $[P]$:\n$$ \\frac{d[m]}{dt} = \\alpha - \\delta_m [m] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{TL} [m] - \\delta_p [P] $$\nHere, $\\delta_m$ is the effective degradation rate of the mRNA, and $\\delta_p$ is the effective degradation and dilution rate of the GFP protein.
