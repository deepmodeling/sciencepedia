The goal is to construct a bacterial biosensor. The design involves inserting a gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which will act as a reporter, into a commercially available plasmid vector named pEXPR. The pEXPR vector contains a gene *bla* that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\n\nThe experimental plan is as follows:\n1.  The pEXPR vector backbone is digested with two different restriction enzymes, EcoRI and BamHI, to create a linear piece of DNA with incompatible \"sticky ends\". This strategy is intended to prevent the vector from ligating back to itself.\n2.  The *gfp* gene is amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using primers that add an EcoRI site to one end and a BamHI site to the other end. This amplified DNA is called the \"insert\".\n3.  The insert is also digested with EcoRI and BamHI.\n4.  The digested vector and insert are mixed together with T4 DNA ligase to create the final circular plasmid.\n5.  The resulting ligation mixture is transformed into a strain of competent *E. coli* cells.\n6.  The cells are plated on a petri dish containing Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar and ampicillin for selection.\n\nThe student also prepares two controls: a \"positive control\" where un-digested pEXPR plasmid is transformed and plated on an identical LB-ampicillin plate, and a \"negative control\" where competent cells with no added DNA are plated on another identical LB-ampicillin plate.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the negative control plate has no colonies, and the positive control plate is covered in colonies, confirming the cells, the plasmid stock, and the selective plates are all functional. However, the experimental plate with the ligation mixture shows zero colonies.\n\nGiven these results, which of the following represents the most direct and likely cause for the complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment?\n\nA. The GFP gene insert was accidentally ligated into the vector in the reverse orientation.\nB. The heat shock step of the transformation protocol was performed at 37 °C instead of the optimal 42 °C.\nC. The T4 DNA ligase enzyme was inadvertently omitted from the ligation reaction mixture.\nD. The promoter sequence upstream of the GFP insertion site is specific to eukaryotes and is not recognized by *E. coli* RNA polymerase.\nE. A premature stop codon occurred during the PCR amplification of the GFP insert, creating a premature stop codon.", "solution": "We analyze the selection logic and the controls to identify the most direct cause of zero colonies in the experimental plate.\n\nFirst, on LB with ampicillin, only cells that acquire a circular plasmid carrying a functional ampicillin resistance gene (*bla*) will form colonies. Linear DNA is rapidly degraded in bacteria and does not replicate; hence, it does not confer stable ampicillin resistance.\n\nThe negative control (no DNA) yielding no colonies confirms that the antibiotic selection is effective and there is no contamination. The positive control (undigested pEXPR plasmid) yielding many colonies confirms that the competent cells, transformation workflow, recovery, and plates are functional.\n\nIn the main experiment, the vector was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, producing incompatible sticky ends to prevent self-ligation. The insert was PCR-amplified and digested with the same enzymes to produce matching ends for directional cloning. Successful colony formation therefore requires ligation to re-circularize the vector with the insert.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Reverse orientation of the insert would still produce a circular plasmid carrying *bla*. Even if GFP were nonfunctional or improperly expressed, the *bla* gene on the vector would confer ampicillin resistance, so colonies would still be expected. This cannot explain zero colonies.\n\nB. Performing heat shock at a suboptimal temperature could reduce transformation efficiency. However, the positive control produced many colonies under the same transformation pipeline, indicating that the transformation step was functional. Moreover, a suboptimal heat shock temperature would typically decrease, not abolish, transformants; complete absence of colonies is less directly explained than by a failed ligation.\n\nC. Omitting T4 DNA ligase prevents ligation of the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested vector to the similarly digested insert. Given that the vector ends are incompatible with each other, the vector cannot self-ligate without ligase; the reaction remains as linear DNA fragments. Linear DNA does not confer stable ampicillin resistance and is not maintained in Escherichia coli, so no colonies would be expected. This directly matches the observation and is fully consistent with functional controls.\n\nD. A eukaryotic promoter upstream of GFP would prevent GFP expression in Escherichia coli but does not affect the *bla* gene; colonies would still form, albeit non-fluorescent. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nE. A premature stop codon in the *gfp* insert affects only GFP expression, not *bla*. Colonies would still form. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely cause of complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment is omission of T4 DNA ligase from the ligation reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2074894"}, {"introduction": "Successfully building a plasmid is only half the battle; you must also verify that you have built the correct construct.

The goal is to insert a gene encoding a red fluorescent protein (RFP), which is 850 base pairs (bp) in length, into a pUC19-derived vector that is 2686 bp long. The cloning strategy involves a double restriction digest of both the vector and the *rfp* gene insert with the enzymes XbaI and PstI, followed by ligation.\n\nA successful ligation would result in a recombinant plasmid with a total size of 3536 bp. To verify the construction, the student performs a \"test\" by digesting the purified plasmid from a selected bacterial colony with the same two enzymes, XbaI and PstI. The expected result on an agarose gel would be two distinct bands: one at 2686 bp (the vector backbone) and one at 850 bp (the RFP insert).\n\nHowever, after running the digest and visualizing the DNA on an agarose gel, the student observes only a single, sharp band corresponding to a size of approximately 2700 bp. This result suggests a failure in the construction of the desired plasmid.\n\nBased on the principles of the design-build-test-learn cycle, which of the following options represents the most logical and efficient *next diagnostic step* to \"learn\" about the specific failure in the plasmid's structure before attempting a new \"build\"?\n\nA.

A correct ligation would yield a recombinant plasmid of total length\n$$\nL_{\\text{recombinant}}=2686+850=3536 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\nVerification by a double digest with XbaI and PstI should cut at the two engineered sites flanking the insert, producing two fragments:\n- a backbone fragment of $2686$ bp, and\n- an insert fragment of $850$ bp.\n\nThus, a correct construct should show two bands at $2686$ bp and $850$ bp on an agarose gel.\n\nThe observed outcome after digest is a single sharp band at approximately $2700$ bp. This implies that only one visible fragment is present. Consider the likely scenarios:\n\n1. Empty vector (no insert):\nLet $d$ denote the native distance (in bp) between the XbaI and PstI sites in the parental vector’s multiple cloning site. A double digest of an empty vector would produce two fragments of sizes $2686-d$ and $d$. If $d$ is small (typical for many MCS regions), the small fragment ($d$) would be too small to visualize under standard gel conditions, and the large fragment would run at approximately the vector length, i.e., close to $2686$ bp, commonly appearing near $2700$ bp. This matches the observation of a single band near $2700$ bp.\n\n2. Failed digest (inactive enzymes):\nIf both enzymes were inactive, most DNA would remain supercoiled/nicked circular, which typically migrates anomalously and does not present as a single sharp band at the expected linear size. The observation of a single sharp band near the linear size is more consistent with successful cutting of an empty vector (producing an invisible tiny fragment and a visible large fragment), not with enzyme failure.\n\n3. Successful recombinant:\nThis would require two bands at $2686$ bp and $850$ bp, which are not observed.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent interpretation is that the plasmid lacks the $850$ bp insert and that the double digest released only the small MCS fragment (invisible) plus the large backbone near $2686$ bp.\n\nThe next diagnostic step should efficiently and specifically determine whether the insert is present between the XbaI and PstI sites.

It is more informative than simply repeating the digest with fresh enzymes (the digest likely worked), and more targeted and efficient than restarting the entire cloning or sending the whole plasmid for full sequencing at this stage.\n\nHence, the most logical and efficient next diagnostic step is to perform PCR across the insertion site with flanking primers.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2074945"}, {"introduction": "The true power of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle shines when we move from simply making a system work to making it work well. This final practice problem addresses a common challenge in synthetic biology: a genetic circuit that is functional but performs poorly, in this case, a \"leaky\" genetic switch. Your task is to use the initial test results to \"Learn\" about the system's shortcomings and \"Design\" an intelligent modification for the next cycle, demonstrating how engineers iteratively refine and optimize biological devices [@problem_id:1428093].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biology students is in the \"Design-Build-Test-Learn\" cycle for creating a simple genetic switch in *E. coli*. Their goal is to have the bacteria produce a glowing protein only in the presence of a specific sugar.\n\n**Design/Build - Cycle 1:** The team constructed a plasmid containing a single transcriptional unit. This unit consists of an arabinose-inducible promoter (P_BAD) that controls the expression of a gene encoding a highly stable variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In principle, adding the sugar arabinose to the bacterial culture should induce the promoter, leading to GFP production and fluorescence. Removing arabinose should turn off the promoter, stopping GFP production.\n\n**Test - Cycle 1:** The team tested the circuit.\n-   **\"ON\" state:** When arabinose was added to the culture, the bacteria showed strong green fluorescence, as expected.\n-   **\"OFF\" state:** When the bacteria were grown in a medium without arabinose, they still exhibited a significant and easily measurable level of green fluorescence.\n\n**Learn - Cycle 1:** The team concluded that their switch is \"leaky.\" The P_BAD promoter has a low but non-zero level of basal transcription even without arabinose. Because the GFP variant they used is very stable (has a long half-life), this low-level leaky transcription leads to the accumulation of enough GFP protein to cause a noticeable background signal in the \"OFF\" state.\n\nFor the next \"Design/Build\" cycle, the team wants to implement a single, targeted modification to their existing plasmid to make the \"OFF\" state signal much lower (i.e., to create a \"tighter\" switch), while having a minimal negative impact on the maximum possible signal in the \"ON\" state. Which of the following strategies best addresses the specific problem of protein accumulation from a leaky promoter?\n\nA. Replace the gene for the stable GFP with a gene for a different fluorescent protein, such as mCherry (a red fluorescent protein), which is also highly stable.\nB. Increase the copy number of the plasmid in the *E. coli* cells.\nC. Modify the coding sequence of the *gfp* gene to add a short amino acid sequence to the C-terminus of the GFP protein that acts as a degradation tag, targeting a native *E. coli* protease.\nD. Mutate the promoter sequence to increase its binding affinity for the RNA polymerase.", "solution": "The core problem is that a stable protein product (GFP) accumulates to significant levels even when its gene is transcribed at a very low, \"leaky\" rate. The steady-state concentration of a protein is determined by the balance between its synthesis rate and its degradation/dilution rate. To lower the protein level in the \"OFF\" state, we must either decrease the synthesis rate or increase the degradation rate.\n\nLet's analyze the options in the context of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the root cause.**\nThe problem states that the P_BAD promoter is leaky, leading to basal transcription. This is the source of the synthesis in the \"OFF\" state. The problem is exacerbated by the high stability (low degradation rate) of the GFP protein, which allows it to accumulate. The goal is to reduce the steady-state protein level in the \"OFF\" state.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Option A.**\nThis option suggests replacing GFP with another stable fluorescent protein, mCherry. This only changes the color of the output signal. Since mCherry is also described as highly stable, it would accumulate from the leaky promoter in the same way GFP does. This strategy does not address the fundamental problem of protein accumulation and would likely result in a leaky red switch instead of a leaky green one. Therefore, this is an ineffective solution.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Option B.**\nThis option suggests increasing the plasmid copy number. The rate of gene transcription is proportional to the number of copies of that gene available. Increasing the plasmid copy number would increase the number of *gfp* gene templates in the cell. This would amplify the synthesis rate in both the \"ON\" state and the leaky \"OFF\" state. The background signal in the \"OFF\" state would become even higher, worsening the problem. Therefore, this is a counterproductive solution.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Option D.**\nThis option suggests mutating the promoter to increase its binding affinity for RNA polymerase. A promoter with a higher affinity for RNA polymerase is a \"stronger\" promoter, meaning it will initiate transcription more frequently. This would increase the transcription rate in both the induced \"ON\" state and the uninduced \"leaky\" state. Similar to option B, this would make the leakiness problem worse, not better. Therefore, this is a counterproductive solution.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Option C.**\nThis option suggests adding a degradation tag to the GFP protein. A degradation tag is a short peptide sequence that is recognized by cellular proteases, which then actively degrade the protein. This modification directly increases the degradation rate of the GFP protein.\n-   **In the \"OFF\" state:** The synthesis rate is very low due to leaky transcription. A high degradation rate will ensure that any GFP protein that is synthesized is quickly destroyed. This prevents accumulation and leads to a much lower steady-state protein level, resulting in a \"tighter\" OFF state.\n-   **In the \"ON\" state:** The synthesis rate is very high. While the degradation machinery is still active, the high rate of production can overwhelm it, allowing for a high steady-state level of GFP and a strong signal.\nThis strategy directly and effectively targets the identified problem of protein accumulation from a leaky promoter by manipulating the degradation side of the synthesis-degradation balance. It is a standard and powerful technique in synthetic biology to improve the dynamic range and responsiveness of genetic circuits.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAdding a degradation tag (Option C) is the only strategy listed that directly counteracts the accumulation of protein from a leaky promoter, thereby tightening the \"OFF\" state of the genetic switch without eliminating its function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1428093"}]}
