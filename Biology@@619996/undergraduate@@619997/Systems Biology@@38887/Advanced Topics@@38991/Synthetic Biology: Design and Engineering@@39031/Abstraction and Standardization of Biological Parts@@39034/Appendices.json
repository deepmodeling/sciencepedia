You'll practice applying systematic counting principles while also accounting for real-world biochemical incompatibilities, a critical skill for planning high-throughput experiments and building functional circuits.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) provides a standardized way to represent and exchange designs of genetic circuits. A core concept in SBOL is the `ComponentDefinition`, which represents a biological part like a promoter or a gene. These parts are assembled into larger functional units, like plasmids, by specifying their relative order.\n\nA synthetic biologist is designing a library of plasmids to express various proteins in a host organism. Each plasmid is designed as a simple expression cassette with a fixed architecture: one Promoter, followed by one Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), followed by one Coding Sequence (CDS), and finally one Terminator. A unique plasmid design is defined by the specific combination of these four parts.\n\nThe biologist has a library of characterized parts, categorized by their role:\n-   **Promoters (`P`):** A set of 5 distinct promoters, `{P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}`.\n-   **Ribosome Binding Sites (`RBS`):** A set of 4 distinct RBSs, `{R1, R2, R3, R4}`.\n-   **Coding Sequences (`CDS`):** A set of 6 distinct CDSs, `{C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6}`.\n-   **Terminators (`T`):** A set of 3 distinct terminators, `{T1, T2, T3}`.\n\nHowever, not all combinations of these parts are functional. The following compatibility constraints must be respected:\n\n1.  Due to molecular interactions, promoter `P1` is incompatible with RBS `R2`. Any cassette containing this specific promoter-RBS pair is invalid.\n2.  The protein encoded by `C3` is toxic at high expression levels. Therefore, `C3` must only be driven by a low-strength promoter. The set of low-strength promoters is `{P1, P2, P3}`. Any cassette where `C3` is preceded by a promoter not in this set is invalid.\n3.  Terminator `T1` is a highly specialized, ribozyme-based terminator that is engineered to function correctly only when it follows the specific coding sequence `C5`. Any cassette where `T1` follows a CDS other than `C5` is invalid.\n\nBased on the provided library of parts and the specified compatibility constraints, calculate the total number of unique, valid expression cassette designs that can be assembled.", "solution": "Let the sets of parts be $P=\\{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\\}$, $R=\\{R_{1},R_{2},R_{3},R_{4}\\}$, $C=\\{C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4},C_{5},C_{6}\\}$, and $T=\\{T_{1},T_{2},T_{3}\\}$. A design is a tuple $(p,r,c,t)\\in P\\times R\\times C\\times T$ subject to the constraints.\n\nConstraint 1 excludes exactly the pair $(P_{1},R_{2})$ independently of $c$ and $t$.

A key strategy to shorten the response time of a circuit is to enhance the degradation rate of its protein products.\n\nConsider a simple genetic circuit designed to produce a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) as a reporter. The production of RFP is initiated by an inducer molecule and proceeds at a constant rate, $\\alpha$. The RFP molecule itself is subject to a natural, intrinsic degradation process within the cell, which can be modeled as a first-order reaction with a rate constant $k_{nat}$.\n\nTo create a \"fast-off\" version of this circuit, a synthetic biologist fuses a protein degradation tag to the RFP. This tag is recognized by the cell's proteolytic machinery, introducing an additional, independent degradation pathway. This tag-mediated degradation is also a first-order process, characterized by a rate constant $k_{tag}$. The total degradation rate for the tagged protein is the sum of the natural and tag-mediated rates.\n\nLet's assume the circuit is allowed to run in the presence of the inducer until the RFP concentration reaches a steady state. At time $t=0$, the inducer is completely removed, and protein production instantly ceases. The \"turn-off time\" of the circuit is defined as the time it takes for the RFP concentration to fall to precisely $5\\%$ of its initial steady-state value.\n\nYour task is to quantify the performance improvement conferred by the degradation tag. Calculate the ratio of the turn-off time for the circuit with the tagged RFP to the turn-off time for the circuit with the untagged RFP.

While induced, production is at a constant rate $\\alpha$ and degradation is first order. For the untagged case the degradation rate constant is $k_{nat}$, and for the tagged case the total degradation rate constant is $k_{nat}+k_{tag}$ because independent first-order decay pathways add.\n\nUnder induction, the dynamics are\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\alpha-k x,\n$$\nwith $k=k_{nat}$ (untagged) or $k=k_{nat}+k_{tag}$ (tagged).

This practice highlights the necessity of characterizing part imperfections to design robust and reliable genetic systems.", "problem": "In synthetic biology, the design of reliable genetic logic gates is a fundamental challenge. Consider a two-input AND gate intended to control the expression of a reporter gene. The gate's logic is implemented on a plasmid, but due to a design oversight, one of the input-sensing modules is placed directly upstream of the output module.\n\nThis specific input module consists of a promoter, $P_A$, which is activated by an inducer molecule 'A', followed by a gene, $G_A$, and a terminator, $T_A$. The output module, located immediately downstream of $T_A$, consists of the AND-gate's output promoter, $P_{out}$, followed by the reporter gene. The promoter $P_{out}$ is only fully activated when the protein products from *both* input modules (the one described, and a second one not part of this leaky construct) are present.\n\nLet's model the transcription dynamics under the following parameters:\n- The transcription initiation rate from promoter $P_A$ is $k_A$ when inducer 'A' is present, and zero otherwise.\n- The terminator $T_A$ is \"leaky,\" with a termination efficiency of $\\eta$. This means a fraction $\\eta$ of RNA Polymerase (RNAP) molecules that transcribe $G_A$ will terminate correctly at $T_A$, while the remaining fraction will read through.\n- The output promoter $P_{out}$ has a basal transcription initiation rate of $k_{basal}$ when one or both of the required activating proteins are absent.\n- When both required activating proteins are present, the transcription initiation rate from $P_{out}$ is $k_{ON}$.\n\nAssume that the total transcription rate of the reporter gene is the sum of rates from all initiation and read-through events. Consider the specific \"OFF\" state where inducer 'A' is present, but the second inducer is absent. This state should ideally produce no output. Due to the design flaw, it produces a \"leaky\" output.\n\nCalculate the Gate Leakiness for this specific state. Gate Leakiness is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the total transcription rate of the reporter gene in this \"OFF\" state (inducer 'A' present, other absent) to the total transcription rate in the fully \"ON\" state (both inducers present).
