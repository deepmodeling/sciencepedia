It consists of three genes (Gene 1, Gene 2, Gene 3) that produce three corresponding proteins (Protein 1, Protein 2, Protein 3). These components form a cyclic negative feedback loop: Protein 1 represses the expression of Gene 2, Protein 2 represses the expression of Gene 3, and Protein 3 represses the expression of Gene 1.\n\nThe dynamics of the protein concentrations, denoted $p_1(t)$, $p_2(t)$, and $p_3(t)$, can be modeled by a system of differential equations. For each protein, its rate of change is the difference between its production rate and its degradation rate. All proteins are actively degraded by the cell at a rate proportional to their own concentration, with a common first-order rate constant $\\delta$.\n\nThe production of each protein is a regulated process. The rate of production of protein $i$ which is repressed by protein $j$ is described by a decreasing Hill function:\n$$ \\text{Production Rate} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (p_j/K)^n} $$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the maximum production rate (when the repressor concentration is zero), which is assumed to be the same for all three genes. $K$ is the repression coefficient, representing the concentration of repressor needed to halve the production rate. The parameter $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the steepness of the repression. Both $K$ and $n$ are assumed to be identical for all repressive interactions in the circuit.\n\nImagine that a specific mutation renders the promoter for Gene 2 completely inactive, meaning no transcription from Gene 2 can occur under any circumstances. The system is then allowed to evolve over a long period of time until it reaches a stable steady state.\n\nDetermine the final, steady-state concentration of Protein 3.

This means that the production term for Protein 2 becomes zero, as no transcription from Gene 2 can occur. The equation for the rate of change of $p_2$ is therefore modified to:\n\n$$ \\frac{dp_2}{dt} = 0 - \\delta p_2 = -\\delta p_2 $$\n\nWe are interested in the long-term, stable steady-state concentrations. At steady state, the concentrations of the proteins no longer change with time, so their time derivatives are zero. Let's denote the steady-state concentrations as $p_{1,ss}$, $p_{2,ss}$, and $p_{3,ss}$.\n\nFirst, we find the steady-state concentration of Protein 2 by setting its time derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dp_{2,ss}}{dt} = -\\delta p_{2,ss} = 0 $$\nSince the degradation rate constant $\\delta$ is a positive value, the only solution to this equation is $p_{2,ss} = 0$. This means that in the long run, any existing Protein 2 will be degraded, and without any production, its concentration will approach zero.\n\nNow, we can use this result to find the steady-state concentration of Protein 3. We look at the differential equation for $p_3$ at steady state:\n$$ \\frac{dp_{3,ss}}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (p_{2,ss}/K)^n} - \\delta p_{3,ss} = 0 $$\n\nWe substitute the steady-state value $p_{2,ss} = 0$ into this equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (0/K)^n} - \\delta p_{3,ss} = 0 $$\n\nSimplifying the denominator of the production term:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + 0} - \\delta p_{3,ss} = 0 $$\n$$ \\alpha - \\delta p_{3,ss} = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we solve for the steady-state concentration of Protein 3, $p_{3,ss}$:\n$$ \\delta p_{3,ss} = \\alpha $$\n$$ p_{3,ss} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta} $$\n\nThe result is independent of the Hill coefficient $n$ and the repression coefficient $K$. This is because the concentration of the repressor for Gene 3 (Protein 2) is zero, so Gene 3 is expressed at its maximum possible rate, $\\alpha$.

This odd-numbered negative feedback loop leads to sustained oscillations in the protein concentrations, making it a synthetic biological clock.\n\nConsider a hypothetical extension of this design to a four-node repressilator. In this circuit, four genes (1, 2, 3, 4) and their corresponding protein products ($p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$) are arranged in a ring of repression: protein $p_1$ represses gene 2, $p_2$ represses gene 3, $p_3$ represses gene 4, and $p_4$ represses gene 1.\n\nThe dynamics of the protein concentrations can be modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations.

At steady state, all time derivatives are zero. From any of the equations, we get:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (p^*/K)^n} - \\delta p^* $$\nWhile we do not need to solve this equation for $p^*$, its existence is guaranteed for positive parameters.\n\nTo analyze the stability of this steady state, we linearize the system around $(p^*, p^*, p^*, p^*)$. The stability is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ evaluated at this point. The Jacobian matrix is defined by:\n$$ J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial (dp_i/dt)}{\\partial p_j} $$\n\nLet $f_i(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)$ be the right-hand side of the equation for $dp_i/dt$.\nThe diagonal elements are:\n$$ J_{ii} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial p_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (p_j/K)^n} - \\delta p_i \\right) = -\\delta $$\nThe non-zero off-diagonal elements correspond to the repressive interactions.

This means $x$ must be one of the four 4th roots of $g^4$, which are $g, -g, ig, -ig$.\nRecalling $x = -(\\delta + \\lambda)$, we can find the four eigenvalues:\n1.  $-(\\delta + \\lambda_1) = g \\implies \\lambda_1 = - \\delta - g$\n2.  $-(\\delta + \\lambda_2) = -g \\implies \\lambda_2 = - \\delta + g$\n3.  $-(\\delta + \\lambda_3) = ig \\implies \\lambda_3 = - \\delta - ig$\n4.  $-(\\delta + \\lambda_4) = -ig \\implies \\lambda_4 = - \\delta + ig$\n\nNow we analyze the stability based on the real parts of these eigenvalues. The steady state is unstable if any eigenvalue has a positive real part.\n*   $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = -\\delta - g$. Since $\\delta>0$ and $g>0$, this is always negative.\n*   $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = g - \\delta$. This can be positive if $g > \\delta$.\n*   $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_3) = -\\delta$. This is always negative.\n*   $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_4) = -\\delta$. This is also always negative.\n\nSustained oscillations arise from a Hopf bifurcation, which occurs when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis into the right half-plane. This requires the real part of the complex pair to become positive, while the imaginary part is non-zero.\nIn our system, the complex eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{3,4} = -\\delta \\pm ig$. Their real part is $-\\delta$, which is strictly negative. Therefore, they can never cause an oscillatory instability.\n\nThe only eigenvalue that can become positive is $\\lambda_2 = g - \\delta$. This eigenvalue is purely real. An instability caused by a real eigenvalue crossing from negative to positive corresponds to a monotonic (non-oscillatory) divergence from the steady state. This type of bifurcation (a pitchfork or saddle-node bifurcation in this symmetric context) typically leads to the emergence of new stable states. In this circuit, it leads to bistability, where the system evolves to one of two asymmetric stable states (e.g., one state with high $p_1, p_3$ and low $p_2, p_4$, and another with the reverse).\n\nTherefore, the system can become unstable, but it will not exhibit sustained oscillations around the symmetric steady state. The instability is monotonic, leading to bistability. This matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1473538"}]}
