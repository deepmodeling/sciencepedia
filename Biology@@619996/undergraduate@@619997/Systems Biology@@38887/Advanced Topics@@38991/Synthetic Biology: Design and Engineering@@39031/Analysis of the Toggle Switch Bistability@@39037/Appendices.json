The protein U represses the gene that produces V, and conversely, V represses the gene that produces U. This mutual repression can lead to bistability, where the system has two stable steady states.\n\nA simplified mathematical model describing the time evolution of the concentrations of these two proteins, denoted by $u(t)$ and $v(t)$, is given by the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha_1}{1 + v^n} - \\delta_1 u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha_2}{1 + u^m} - \\delta_2 v\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are the maximal synthesis rates for U and V, respectively. $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are the effective degradation and dilution rates. The exponents $n$ and $m$ are Hill coefficients, which quantify the cooperativity of repression.

This exercise moves from a purely deterministic view to a more realistic scenario, asking you to predict the outcome for a population of cells initialized at the tipping point between the two stable states.

There also exists a third, unstable steady state where $u=v$.\n\nAn experiment is performed on a large, isogenic population of these cells. At time $t=0$, all cells are synchronized and initialized with identical concentrations of the two proteins, such that $u(0) = v(0) = u_{initial}$. The value $u_{initial}$ is precisely set to be the concentration at the system's unstable steady state. While the deterministic model above describes the average behavior, any real biological system is subject to intrinsic noise due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions, causing small, random fluctuations in the concentrations of U and V.\n\nAfter allowing the cells to grow and the circuit to evolve for a sufficiently long time, the final distribution of $(u,v)$ states across the entire cell population is measured.

The concentrations of both proteins in all cells decay to zero, as the inherent noise causes the circuit to fail.", "solution": "The problem asks for the long-term behavior of a population of cells containing a symmetric toggle switch, where all cells are initialized at the system's unstable steady state. The key to solving this problem is to understand the interplay between the deterministic dynamics of the system and the effects of stochastic noise.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the deterministic system described by the equations:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+v^n} - u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+u^n} - v\n$$\n\nThe steady states of the system are found by setting both derivatives to zero: $u = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+v^n}$ and $v = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+u^n}$. These equations define the nullclines of the system. The intersections of the nullclines in the $u-v$ phase plane correspond to the steady states.\n\nAs stated in the problem, for the given parameters, the system is bistable. This means there are three steady states:\n1.  A stable state $(u_{high}, v_{low})$ where $u$ is large and $v$ is small.\n2.  A stable state $(v_{low}, u_{high})$ where $u$ is small and $v$ is large. By symmetry, $u_{high}$ here is the same value as in the first state, and $v_{low}$ is the same.\n3.  An unstable state $(u^*, v^*)$ where $u^* = v^*$. This state lies on the line $u=v$. The problem specifies that the initial condition is $u(0)=v(0)=u_{initial}$, where $u_{initial}$ is this unstable steady-state concentration.\n\nIn a phase portrait of this system, the unstable steady state is a saddle point. The stable manifold of this saddle point is the line $u=v$. This line is also the separatrix, which divides the phase space into two basins of attraction. Any initial condition with $u > v$ will evolve towards the stable state $(u_{high}, v_{low})$. Conversely, any initial condition with $v > u$ will evolve towards the stable state $(v_{low}, u_{high})$.\n\nIn a purely deterministic world (i.e., without noise), a system initialized exactly on the separatrix, at $u(0)=v(0)$, would have its entire trajectory confined to this line. The system would evolve along the line $u=v$ and approach the unstable saddle point $(u^*, u^*)$. If initialized exactly at the unstable point, it would remain there forever. This scenario corresponds to option A.\n\nHowever, the problem explicitly mentions the presence of intrinsic noise. Biological systems are not deterministic. The concentrations of proteins are subject to random fluctuations due to the stochastic timing of transcription and translation events. This means the state of the system, $(u(t), v(t))$, does not follow the deterministic path perfectly but rather performs a random walk around it.\n\nWhen the system is initialized at the unstable steady state on the separatrix $(u_{initial}, u_{initial})$, it is in a precarious balance. Any small, random perturbation will push the cell's state off the separatrix $u=v$.\n- If a random fluctuation causes $u$ to become slightly greater than $v$, the cell's state $(u,v)$ will enter the basin of attraction for the $(u_{high}, v_{low})$ stable state. The deterministic dynamics will then take over and drive the system to this state.\n- If a random fluctuation causes $v$ to become slightly greater than $u$, the cell's state will enter the basin of attraction for the $(v_{low}, u_{high})$ stable state, and it will evolve towards that state.\n\nSince the system is perfectly symmetric (the equations for $u$ and $v$ are identical in form) and the intrinsic noise is random with no inherent bias, the probability of a fluctuation pushing the system into the $u>v$ region is equal to the probability of it being pushed into the $v>u$ region. Therefore, for a large population of cells all starting from the same unstable point, we expect approximately 50% of the cells to end up in the $(u_{high}, v_{low})$ state and the other 50% to end up in the $(v_{low}, u_{high})$ state.\n\nThis leads directly to the conclusion described in option B.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- A is incorrect because it describes the purely deterministic outcome, ignoring the crucial effect of noise on an unstable state.\n- C is incorrect because there is no mechanism for all cells to coordinate their random decision. The choice for each cell is an independent probabilistic event.\n- D is incorrect because this type of toggle switch architecture leads to bistability, not oscillations. Oscillatory systems typically require a negative feedback loop with a time delay or a combination of positive and negative feedback loops, which is not the structure here.\n- E is incorrect. The state $(0,0)$ is not a stable state for the given parameters. Noise drives the system from unstable states to stable states, not to a state of collapse, unless that state itself is stable.\n\nTherefore, the only physically realistic outcome for the population is a bifurcation into two distinct subpopulations corresponding to the two stable states of the switch.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1416600"}]}
