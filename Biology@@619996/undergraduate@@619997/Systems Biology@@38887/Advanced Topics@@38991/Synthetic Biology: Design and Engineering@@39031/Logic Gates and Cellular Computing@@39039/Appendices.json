This first practice challenges you to think like a synthetic biologist by designing a biological NAND gate, a universal gate from which all other logic functions can be built. By analyzing different configurations of promoters, repressors, and inducers, you will develop an intuition for how molecular interactions can be orchestrated to perform specific computations, translating abstract Boolean logic into tangible genetic reality [@problem_id:1443146].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, engineers design genetic circuits within cells to perform computations, analogous to electronic circuits. These circuits are built from basic components like promoters, which initiate gene expression, and regulatory proteins (repressors and activators) that modulate this expression in response to specific input molecules.\n\nConsider a simple computational task: implementing a NAND (\"Not AND\") logic gate. This gate takes two chemical inputs, Inducer 1 (In1) and Inducer 2 (In2), and produces an output, which is the expression of a reporter protein (e.g., Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)). The state \"1\" (or TRUE) corresponds to the presence of an inducer or high expression of the reporter, while \"0\" (or FALSE) corresponds to its absence or basal-level expression. The NAND gate's logic dictates that the output should be \"1\" in all cases, except when both inputs are \"1\", in which case the output is \"0\".\n\nYou are presented with four hypothetical designs for a genetic circuit intended to function as a NAND gate. Identify the design that correctly implements the specified logic.\n\nA. A single repressor protein, `R`, is constitutively expressed from a promoter `P_const`. This repressor has two distinct allosteric binding sites, one for In1 and one for In2. The repressor `R` only adopts an active conformation, allowing it to bind its target Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) operator site `O_R`, when *both* In1 and In2 are bound to it. The reporter gene is driven by a promoter `P_out` that is constitutively active but contains the operator site `O_R`.\n\nB. The reporter gene is controlled by a promoter `P_out` that has two separate operator sites, `O_1` and `O_2`. The cell constitutively produces two distinct repressor proteins, `R1` and `R2`. `R1` binds to `O_1` only in the presence of In1, and `R2` binds to `O_2` only in the presence of In2. Binding of either repressor is sufficient to halt transcription.\n\nC. The reporter gene is controlled by a special promoter, `P_and`, that requires the cooperative binding of two separate activator proteins, `A1` and `A2`, to initiate transcription. Both `A1` and `A2` are constitutively expressed. `A1` becomes an active activator only in the presence of In1, and `A2` becomes an active activator only in the presence of In2.\n\nD. The expression of a repressor protein `R` is driven by a promoter that is activated by In1. This repressor `R` is, in turn, allosterically inactivated by the binding of In2. The reporter gene is transcribed from a constitutively active promoter `P_out` that is repressed by the active form of `R`.", "solution": "Let the inputs be Boolean variables $x,y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ where $x=1$ denotes presence of In1 and $y=1$ denotes presence of In2. Let the output $f \\in \\{0,1\\}$ represent high reporter expression ($f=1$) or repression/basal expression ($f=0$). A NAND gate requires $f=\\neg(x \\land y)$.\n\nAnalyze each design:\n\nA. The repressor $R$ is active only when both In1 and In2 are bound. Thus the active repressor state is $R_{\\text{act}}=x \\land y$. Since $P_{\\text{out}}$ is repressed by active $R$, the output is\n$$\nf=\\neg R_{\\text{act}}=\\neg(x \\land y),\n$$\nwhich is exactly NAND.\n\nB. $R1$ binds only if $x=1$ and $R2$ binds only if $y=1$. Binding of either is sufficient to halt transcription, so transcription is on only if neither binds. Hence\n$$\nf=\\neg x \\land \\neg y=\\neg(x \\lor y),\n$$\nwhich is NOR, not NAND.\n\nC. Transcription from $P_{\\text{and}}$ requires both activators to be active; $A1$ active iff $x=1$ and $A2$ active iff $y=1$. Therefore\n$$\nf=x \\land y,\n$$\nwhich is AND, not NAND.\n\nD. $R$ expression is activated by In1, so $R$ is present when $x=1$. $R$ is allosterically inactivated by In2, so $R$ is active only if $x=1$ and $y=0$, i.e.,\n$$\nR_{\\text{act}}=x \\land \\neg y.\n$$\nSince $P_{\\text{out}}$ is repressed by active $R$, the output is\n$$\nf=\\neg(x \\land \\neg y)=\\neg x \\lor y,\n$$\nwhich is not NAND.\n\nOnly design A implements $f=\\neg(x \\land y)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct design is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1443146"}, {"introduction": "While we often describe genetic circuits using the binary language of $0$s and $1$s, biological reality is fundamentally analog. This exercise moves beyond simple on/off logic to explore the quantitative behavior of a genetic OR gate using a thermodynamic model of protein-DNA binding.

Consider a simple genetic OR gate constructed from a single gene, let's call it Gene Z, whose expression is controlled by two distinct activator transcription factors, TF-A and TF-B.\n\nThe promoter region of Gene Z has one binding site for TF-A and a separate, independent binding site for TF-B. The binding of each transcription factor to its respective site is a reversible process that can be described by a thermodynamic equilibrium model. We assume the following:\n1.  The binding of TF-A and TF-B are independent events. The binding of one factor does not alter the affinity of the promoter for the other.\n2.  The binding of TF-A to its site is characterized by a dissociation constant $K_A$, and the binding of TF-B to its site is characterized by a dissociation constant $K_B$. For simplicity in this specific design, these constants are identical, such that $K_A = K_B = K_d$.\n3.  The rate of transcription of Gene Z is directly proportional to the probability that the promoter is occupied by *at least one* transcription factor (either TF-A, TF-B, or both).

They are kept in this medium for a period long enough for the concentration of `Rep` to decay to a negligible level (i.e., you can assume `[Rep] = 0`).
