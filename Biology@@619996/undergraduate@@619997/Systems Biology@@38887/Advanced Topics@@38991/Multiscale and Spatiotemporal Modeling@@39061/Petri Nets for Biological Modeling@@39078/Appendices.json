The model represents a pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA) molecule being processed into one of two different final mRNA products, Product A or Product B, by the selective inclusion or exclusion of a single exon.\n\nThe Petri net is defined by a set of places and a set of transitions:\n\nThe places represent the different molecular species in the system:\n- $P_1$: The pool of available pre-mRNA molecules.\n- $P_2$: The pool of available Splicing Factor 1 (SF1), an enzyme that catalyzes the inclusion of the exon.\n- $P_3$: The pool of available Splicing Factor 2 (SF2), an enzyme that catalyzes the exclusion of the exon.\n- $P_4$: The pool of final mRNA Product A (exon included).\n- $P_5$: The pool of final mRNA Product B (exon excluded).\n\nThe transitions represent the possible biochemical reactions:\n- T1: This reaction represents the splicing process that produces Product A. For this reaction to occur, it requires one molecule of pre-mRNA (from $P_1$) and one molecule of SF1 (from $P_2$). Upon completion, the reaction consumes the pre-mRNA molecule, produces one molecule of Product A (into $P_4$), and returns the SF1 molecule to its pool (into $P_2$), ready for another catalytic cycle.\n- T2: This reaction represents the splicing process that produces Product B.

A transition 'fires' by consuming tokens from its input places and producing tokens in its output places, thereby modeling a chemical reaction.\n\nConsider the process of competitive enzyme inhibition, a fundamental mechanism of metabolic regulation. The process is described as follows:\n1.  An enzyme (E) reversibly binds to its substrate (S) at its active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES).\n2.  The enzyme-substrate complex (ES) can then undergo a catalytic step to release the original enzyme (E) and a product (P).\n3.  A competitive inhibitor molecule (I) is present. It is structurally similar to the substrate and can reversibly bind to the *same* active site on the free enzyme (E), forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI).\n4.  The enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) is catalytically inactive and cannot form a product.\n5.
