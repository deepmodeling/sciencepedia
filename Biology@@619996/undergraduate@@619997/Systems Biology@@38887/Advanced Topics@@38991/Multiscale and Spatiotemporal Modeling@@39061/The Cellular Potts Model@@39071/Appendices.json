By analyzing this simplified system, you will build a core intuition for how the CPM's energy minimization algorithm drives changes in cell shape [@problem_id:1471431].", "problem": "The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) is a computational framework used to simulate the collective behavior of cells. In a simplified 2D version of this model, a cell is represented as a collection of connected sites on a square lattice. The system evolves based on a series of pixel-copy attempts, where the probability of a change depends on the change in the total energy, or Hamiltonian ($H$), of the system.\n\nConsider a single cell in a large 2D lattice. Its energy is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n$$H = \\lambda_A (A - A_T)^2 + \\lambda_P P$$\nHere, $A$ is the current area of the cell (number of lattice sites it occupies) and $P$ is its current perimeter (number of edges adjacent to sites not belonging to the cell). The parameters $\\lambda_A$ and $\\lambda_P$ are positive constants representing the strengths of the area and perimeter constraints, respectively. $A_T$ is the target area for the cell.\n\nA specific simulation is configured such that the area constraint strength is set to zero, $\\lambda_A = 0$. The perimeter constraint strength $\\lambda_P$ remains a positive constant. Which of the following statements best describes the most likely long-term behavior of the single cell in this simulation?\n\nA. The cell will expand indefinitely to fill the entire simulation lattice.\n\nB. The cell will progressively shrink until it vanishes from the lattice.\n\nC. The cell will stabilize into a compact, roughly circular shape of a non-zero, constant area.\n\nD. The cell will continuously change shape and size in a random, unpredictable manner.\n\nE. The cell will break apart into many small, disconnected fragments.", "solution": "The Hamiltonian is given by\n$$H=\\lambda_{A}\\left(A-A_{T}\\right)^{2}+\\lambda_{P}P.$$\nWith the area constraint turned off, $\\lambda_{A}=0$, this reduces to\n$$H=\\lambda_{P}P,$$\nwith $\\lambda_{P}>0$. Thus the energy depends only linearly on the perimeter $P$ and is independent of the area $A$.\n\nIn a standard Cellular Potts Model dynamics with Metropolis updates, a proposed pixel-copy move that changes the energy by $\\Delta H$ is accepted with probability\n$$p=\\min\\left(1,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right),$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann’s constant and $T$ is the fluctuation (simulation) temperature. Therefore:\n- If a move reduces the perimeter, $\\Delta P<0$, then $\\Delta H=\\lambda_{P}\\Delta P<0$ and the move is accepted with probability $1$.\n- If a move increases the perimeter, $\\Delta P>0$, then $\\Delta H>0$ and the move is accepted with probability $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_{P}\\Delta P}{k_{B}T}\\right)<1$, hence it is exponentially suppressed.\n\nSince $H$ is minimized by minimizing $P$, the dynamics drives the system toward states with smaller perimeter. On a square lattice, any nonempty cell (a connected cluster of occupied sites) has strictly positive perimeter, with the minimal possible value $P\\geq 4$ for a single-site cell, whereas the empty state has $P=0$. Thus the global minimum of the Hamiltonian is\n$$P=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad H_{\\min}=0,$$\nwhich corresponds to the cell having vanished ($A=0$). Because $P\\ge 0$ for all configurations and $\\lambda_{P}>0$, any nonzero $P$ implies $H>0$, so there exists a strict energetic drive to reduce $P$ as long as the cell exists.\n\nMoreover, once the cell has vanished, there is no source label to copy from in standard CPM kinetics, so the $P=0$ state is absorbing. Thermal fluctuations at finite $T$ may transiently roughen the boundary, but there is no restoring area term to stabilize a nonzero $A$; the net drift is toward reducing $P$ and eventually eliminating the cell. Expansion (increasing $A$) generally increases the boundary length and hence $H$, and fragmenting into multiple pieces increases the total boundary length as well, thereby increasing $H$.\n\nTherefore, the most likely long-term behavior is that the cell progressively shrinks until it disappears.\n\nMapping to the options:\n- A is disfavored because expansion increases $P$ and hence $H$.\n- B is favored because minimizing $H$ means minimizing $P$, achieved at $P=0$ (vanishing cell).\n- C requires an area penalty to stabilize a finite $A$, which is absent when $\\lambda_{A}=0$.\n- D ignores the absorbing nature of the $P=0$ state and the energetic bias against increased $P$.\n- E increases $P$ and thus $H$, so it is not favored.\n\nHence the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1471431"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic principles of energy minimization, we now explore one of the most celebrated applications of the CPM: modeling the self-organization of tissues. This practice moves from a single isolated cell to a mixed population of interacting cells. You will investigate how simple, local rules governing the adhesion energies between different cell types, as described by the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, can give rise to complex, globally ordered structures. This classic cell-sorting simulation is a key example of how emergent biological patterns can be predicted and understood using the CPM framework [@problem_id:1676839].", "problem": "In a computational simulation based on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), a virtual culture is initiated with a randomly intermixed population of two distinct cell types, labeled type A and type B. The simulation models cell sorting behavior by iteratively adjusting cell boundaries to minimize the total interfacial energy of the system. This energy is governed by the adhesion strength between neighboring cells. The simulation defines a specific energy penalty, $J$, for each type of cell-cell contact. A lower $J$ value corresponds to a stronger, more energetically favorable adhesion.\n\nThe specific energy parameters for this system are set according to the following relationship:\n$$J_{AA} < J_{BB} < J_{AB}$$\nwhere $J_{AA}$ is the energy penalty for a contact between two type A cells, $J_{BB}$ is for a contact between two type B cells, and $J_{AB}$ is for a contact between a type A and a type B cell.\n\nAssuming the system is allowed to run until it reaches a stable, minimum-energy equilibrium state, which of the following descriptions accurately portrays the final spatial arrangement of the cells?\n\nA. The type A cells will form a single cohesive mass at the center, which is fully engulfed by the type B cells.\n\nB. The type B cells will form a single cohesive mass at the center, which is fully engulfed by the type A cells.\n\nC. The cells will remain in a randomly intermixed configuration, similar to the initial state.\n\nD. The two cell types will completely separate from each other, forming two distinct and adjacent spherical aggregates.\n\nE. The cells will arrange themselves into a stable, alternating checkerboard-like pattern.", "solution": "The Cellular Potts Model assigns an interfacial energy penalty $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ to every contact between neighboring cells of types $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, and the total energy is reduced by Monte Carlo updates that minimize the sum of these penalties over all interfaces. A lower $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ corresponds to stronger adhesion and therefore a more energetically favorable contact. The system evolves to minimize the total interfacial energy, so the equilibrium configuration is determined by how to arrange cells to reduce high-penalty contacts and, subject to that, to arrange domains so that the more cohesive tissue adopts the position that further lowers the total boundary energy.\n\nGiven\n$$\nJ_{AA} < J_{BB} < J_{AB},\n$$\nwe have the following implications:\n1. Because $J_{AB}$ is the largest, heterotypic A–B contacts carry the highest energy cost. Therefore, energy minimization drives a reduction of the total A–B interfacial area. This implies demixing (cell sorting), not maintenance of a random mixture; hence option C is incompatible with minimizing $J_{AB}$-weighted interfaces. Likewise, a checkerboard-like alternation (option E) would maximize the number of A–B contacts and is therefore energetically unfavorable when $J_{AB}$ is largest.\n\n2. Among homotypic contacts, $J_{AA} < J_{BB}$ means A–A adhesion is stronger (more favorable) than B–B. In the differential adhesion framework, each cell type behaves as a cohesive fluid with an effective tissue cohesivity (or surface tension analog) that increases with the strength of homotypic adhesion. Thus type A is more cohesive than type B.\n\n3. When two cohesivities differ and heterotypic contacts are unfavorable, the minimal-energy arrangement after demixing places the more cohesive tissue inside, fully surrounded by the less cohesive tissue. This configuration minimizes total interfacial energy by:\n   - Eliminating unnecessary A–B contacts (demixing);\n   - Positioning the more cohesive aggregate (type A) as an internal core so that the system avoids exposing the less cohesive tissue to high-energy configurations and achieves the liquid-like equilibrium mandated by the differential adhesion hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium arrangement is that type A forms a central cohesive mass that is engulfed by type B, which matches option A. Options B and D do not match the ordering $J_{AA} < J_{BB}$: if B were more cohesive, B would be inside, but here A is more cohesive; and two adjacent aggregates (D) do not capture the known engulfment outcome when cohesivities differ and heterotypic contacts are disfavored.\n\nHence the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1676839"}, {"introduction": "The CPM is not merely a tool for replicating known phenomena; it is a creative and flexible toolkit for testing new biological hypotheses.
