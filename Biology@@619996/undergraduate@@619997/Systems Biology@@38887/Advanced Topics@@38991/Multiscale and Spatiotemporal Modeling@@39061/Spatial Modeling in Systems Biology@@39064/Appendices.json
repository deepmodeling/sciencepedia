These gradients provide spatial information, telling cells where they are and what they should become. This first exercise explores a foundational model for how such a gradient can be robustly established and maintained through a balance of constant production, diffusion through tissue, and uniform degradation. By solving for the steady-state concentration profile, you will derive a key parameter known as the characteristic length, which defines the effective range of the morphogen signal [@problem_id:1467083].", "problem": "In developmental biology, the formation of complex patterns in an organism often relies on concentration gradients of signaling molecules called morphogens. Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of a developing tissue, represented as a semi-infinite line of cells extending from $x = 0$ to $x \\to \\infty$. A source at the boundary $x=0$ synthesizes a specific morphogen, maintaining a constant concentration $C_0$ at that point. As the morphogen molecules spread into the tissue, they diffuse with a diffusion coefficient $D$. Simultaneously, the morphogen is actively degraded by enzymes present uniformly throughout the tissue. This degradation process is assumed to follow first-order kinetics, meaning the rate of degradation at any point is proportional to the local morphogen concentration $C(x)$, with a rate constant $k$.\n\nAfter a sufficient amount of time, the system reaches a steady state, where the concentration profile of the morphogen, $C(x)$, no longer changes with time. A key property of this morphogen gradient is its characteristic length scale, which determines the effective range of the signal. We define this length scale as the distance from the source at which the morphogen concentration drops to $1/e$ of its value at the source, where $e$ is Euler's number.\n\nDetermine the analytical expression for this characteristic length scale in terms of the given parameters $D$ and $k$.", "solution": "Let $C(x,t)$ denote the morphogen concentration.

We will compare the mean search time for two different strategies.\n\n**Strategy 1: Pure 3D Diffusion**\nThe protein diffuses throughout the 3D cytoplasm with a diffusion coefficient $D_{3D}$ until it directly collides with the target.\n\n**Strategy 2: Combined 3D and 2D Diffusion (Facilitated Diffusion)**\nThe protein diffuses in the 3D cytoplasm. When it collides with any part of the membrane that is not the target, it binds non-specifically and begins to diffuse on the 2D surface of the membrane with a diffusion coefficient $D_{2D}$.
