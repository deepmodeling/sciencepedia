The process begins when planktonic (free-floating) bacteria from the surrounding environment attach to the surface. We assume that these bacteria attach at a constant rate, denoted by $\\alpha$ (cells per unit time). Once attached, the bacteria can also detach from the surface and return to the planktonic state. This detachment process is observed to be a first-order process, meaning the rate of detachment is directly proportional to the number of cells currently attached to the surface, $N(t)$. The proportionality constant for detachment is given by $k$ (per unit time).\n\nAssuming the surface is initially sterile at time $t=0$, derive an expression for the number of attached bacterial cells, $N(t)$, on the surface as a function of time.
