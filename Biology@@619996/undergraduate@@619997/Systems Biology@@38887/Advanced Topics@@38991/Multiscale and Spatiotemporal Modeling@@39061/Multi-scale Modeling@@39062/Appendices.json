The population consists of two types of bacteria: susceptible (plasmid-free), with concentration $S(t)$, and resistant (plasmid-bearing), with concentration $R(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the following principles:\n1.

The chemostat's dilution rate, $D$, which is the rate at which the culture is replaced, is set to be exactly equal to this growth rate, i.e., $D = \\mu$.\n3.

Consequently, the intrinsic growth rate of resistant bacteria is reduced to $\\mu(1-c)$, where $c$ is a dimensionless constant representing the fitness cost, with $0  c  1$.\n4.
