To understand how a group of cells coordinates its movement, we can build simplified physical models. This exercise explores a 'leader-follower' scenario, where one specialized cell guides a chain of others, teaching us how to apply force-balance principles in the low Reynolds number environment of biological systems and revealing how a single external force is distributed across an entire cellular collective. [@problem_id:1439756]", "problem": "In a simplified one-dimensional model of collective cell migration, such as during wound healing, a single 'leader' cell guides a train of $N$ 'follower' cells. The leader cell (indexed as cell 0) is the only one that responds to an external chemical cue, experiencing a constant forward propulsive force $F_{chem}$. The follower cells (indexed as cells 1 to $N$) are mechanically coupled to their neighbors but do not sense the external cue. All cells, including the leader, experience a drag force from the extracellular matrix, which is proportional to their velocity: $F_{drag} = -\\gamma v$, where $\\gamma$ is the drag coefficient which is assumed to be identical for all cells. The mechanical links between adjacent cells behave like ideal springs with a spring constant $k$ and an equilibrium length $L$.\n\nAfter an initial transient period, the entire chain of $N+1$ cells reaches a steady state, moving together with a constant velocity. Assume the motion is overdamped, meaning that inertial effects are negligible and the net force on each cell is zero at all times.\n\nDetermine the steady-state velocity, $v_{ss}$, of the cell chain. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "To determine the steady-state velocity of the cell chain, we will apply the condition of zero net force to each cell in the system. Let $x_i(t)$ be the position of the $i$-th cell at time $t$, where $i=0$ for the leader cell and $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$ for the follower cells. In the steady state, all cells move with the same constant velocity, $v_{ss}$. Therefore, the velocity of each cell is $v_i = \\dot{x}_i = v_{ss}$.\n\nThe forces acting on each cell are the driving chemotactic force (only on the leader), drag forces, and spring forces from adjacent cells. Since the motion is overdamped, the sum of forces on each cell is zero.\n\n**Step 1: Force balance on the leader cell (cell 0)**\nThe leader cell is subject to three forces:\n1.  The chemotactic force, $F_{chem}$.\n2.  The drag force, $-\\gamma v_0 = -\\gamma v_{ss}$.\n3.  The spring force from follower cell 1. The force exerted by a spring is $-k(\\text{extension})$. The extension is $(x_1 - x_0) - L$. So the force on cell 0 from cell 1 is $k(x_1 - x_0 - L)$.\n\nThe force balance equation for the leader cell is:\n$$F_{chem} + k(x_1 - x_0 - L) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\n\nLet $d_1 = x_1 - x_0$ be the separation between the leader and the first follower. The equation becomes:\n$$F_{chem} + k(d_1 - L) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n\n**Step 2: Force balance on an intermediate follower cell (cell $i$, where $1 \\le i < N$)**\nAn intermediate follower cell is subject to three forces:\n1.  The drag force, $-\\gamma v_i = -\\gamma v_{ss}$.\n2.  The spring force from the cell in front (cell $i-1$). The force on cell $i$ from cell $i-1$ is $k(x_{i-1} - x_i - (-L)) = k(x_{i-1} - x_i + L)$.\n3.  The spring force from the cell behind (cell $i+1$). The force on cell $i$ from cell $i+1$ is $k(x_{i+1} - x_i - L)$.\n\nThe force balance equation for cell $i$ is:\n$$k(x_{i-1} - x_i + L) + k(x_{i+1} - x_i - L) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\n$$k(x_{i-1} - 2x_i + x_{i+1}) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\n\nLet $d_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ be the separation between cells $i-1$ and $i$. Then $d_{i+1} = x_{i+1} - x_i$. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$$k((x_{i+1} - x_i) - (x_i - x_{i-1})) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\n$$k(d_{i+1} - d_i) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\n**Step 3: Force balance on the last follower cell (cell $N$)**\nThe last follower cell is subject to two forces:\n1.  The drag force, $-\\gamma v_N = -\\gamma v_{ss}$.\n2.  The spring force from the cell in front (cell $N-1$). The force on cell $N$ from cell $N-1$ is $k(x_{N-1} - x_N + L)$.\n\nThe force balance equation for cell $N$ is:\n$$k(x_{N-1} - x_N + L) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\nLet $d_N = x_N - x_{N-1}$. The equation becomes:\n$$k(-d_N + L) - \\gamma v_{ss} = 0 \\quad (3)$$\n\n**Step 4: Solving the system of equations**\nWe have a system of equations for the unknown velocity $v_{ss}$ and the unknown separations $d_i$. The key insight is that the entire system moves as one, driven by a single external force against the total drag.\n\nA more direct approach than solving for all $d_i$ is to sum the force balance equations for all $N+1$ cells.\nSumming the left-hand sides:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{N} (\\text{Net Force on cell } i) = 0$$\nThe sum includes the external forces ($F_{chem}$ and all drag forces) and the internal spring forces.\n$$\\left(F_{chem} + k(d_1 - L) - \\gamma v_{ss}\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\left(k(d_{i+1} - d_i) - \\gamma v_{ss}\\right) + \\left(k(L - d_N) - \\gamma v_{ss}\\right) = 0$$\n\nLet's examine the sum of the spring forces:\n$$k(d_1 - L) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} k(d_{i+1} - d_i) + k(L - d_N)$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (d_{i+1} - d_i)$ is a telescoping series:\n$$(d_2 - d_1) + (d_3 - d_2) + \\dots + (d_N - d_{N-1}) = d_N - d_1$$\nSo the total sum of spring terms is:\n$$k(d_1 - L) + k(d_N - d_1) + k(L - d_N) = k(d_1 - L + d_N - d_1 + L - d_N) = k(0) = 0$$\nThis is expected, as the spring forces are internal to the system, and by Newton's third law, their sum must be zero.\n\nNow, let's sum the remaining terms from the force balance equations:\n$$F_{chem} - \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\nThe sum is over all $N+1$ cells.\n$$F_{chem} - (N+1)\\gamma v_{ss} = 0$$\n\nSolving for the steady-state velocity $v_{ss}$:\n$$v_{ss} = \\frac{F_{chem}}{(N+1)\\gamma}$$\n\nThis result is physically intuitive: the single external driving force $F_{chem}$ is balanced by the total drag force of the entire chain, which is the sum of the individual drag forces on the $N+1$ cells. The internal spring properties, $k$ and $L$, do not affect the final steady-state velocity of the collective system, although they do determine the specific spacing between the cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{F_{chem}}{(N+1)\\gamma}}$$", "id": "1439756"}, {"introduction": "Why do cells in a dense tissue stop proliferating, a phenomenon known as contact inhibition?

The proposed mechanism involves a density-dependent inactivation of growth factor receptors. To model this, a simplified system is considered, governed by the following steady-state relationships:\n\n1.  A growth factor, L, binds to a free cell-surface receptor, R, to form an active signaling complex, C. The formation of this complex follows the law of mass action with a dissociation constant $K_D$. The steady-state concentration of the complex, $[C]$, is given by $[C] = \\frac{[L][R]}{K_D}$, where $[L]$ is the concentration of the growth factor and $[R]$ is the concentration of free, unbound receptors. The rate of cell proliferation is assumed to be directly proportional to $[C]$.\n\n2.  Due to close cell-cell contact in dense cultures, a fraction of the free receptors becomes reversibly inactivated. The concentration of these inactive receptors, $[R_{\\text{in}}]$, is modeled as being directly proportional to the concentration of free receptors: $[R_{\\text{in}}] = \\beta [R]$. Here, $\\beta$ is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the strength of this density-dependent inactivation.\n\n3.  The total concentration of receptor protein expressed by a cell, $[R_T]$, is constant and is distributed among the free, active complex, and inactive states: $[R_T] = [R] + [C] + [R_{\\text{in}}]$.\n\nThe sensitivity of the cells to the growth factor is often characterized by $[L]_{1/2}$, which is defined as the ligand concentration $[L]$ required to achieve a concentration of the active complex $[C]$ equal to half of its maximum possible value.\n\nThe biologist conducts experiments under two conditions: a sparse culture where cell-cell contacts are minimal, for which the inactivation parameter is found to be $\\beta_{sparse} = 0.05$; and a confluent monolayer, for which the inactivation parameter is $\\beta_{confluent} = 4.5$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the sensitivity in the confluent state to the sensitivity in the sparse state, $\\frac{[L]_{1/2, \\text{confluent}}}{[L]_{1/2, \\text{sparse}}}$.
