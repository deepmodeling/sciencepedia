The cells are genetically identical and are initially in a uniform, undifferentiated state. The biologist hypothesizes that two secreted signaling molecules, which we will call Morphogen A and Morphogen B, are responsible for spontaneous pattern formation via a Turing-style activator-inhibitor mechanism.\n\nIn a classic activator-inhibitor model, the activator molecule stimulates its own production (autocatalysis) as well as the production of the inhibitor. The inhibitor, in turn, suppresses the production of the activator. For spatial patterns to emerge from an initially uniform state, a crucial condition is that the inhibitor must diffuse through the medium significantly faster than the activator. This leads to the principle of \"local activation and long-range inhibition.\"\n\nThe biologist wants to design an experiment to test the hypothesis that Morphogen A is the short-range activator and Morphogen B is the long-range inhibitor. Which of the following experimental manipulations would provide the most direct and compelling evidence to support this specific hypothesis?\n\nA. Adding a high, uniform concentration of Morphogen A to the entire culture medium and observing if the concentration of Morphogen B increases everywhere.\n\nB.

Adding a substance to the culture medium that uniformly increases the degradation rate of Morphogen B and observing if this leads to the formation of patterns with a smaller characteristic wavelength (i.e., spots that are smaller and closer together).\n\nE.

A tiny, localized pulse of A at $t=0$ at the culture center provides an initial condition $a(x,0)=a_{0}+\\delta a\\,\\delta(x)$ and $b(x,0)=b_{0}$. The expected outcomes that jointly and directly test all required features are:\n- Local amplification of $a$ near the perturbation due to $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a}>0$ (autocatalysis), i.e., an increase of $a$ concentrated near the source (short-range activation).\n- Induction of $b$ by $a$ due to $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a}>0$, followed by rapid spatial spread of $b$ governed by $D_{b}\\gg D_{a}$; at early times diffusive spread scales as a width $\\sigma(t)\\propto\\sqrt{2Dt}$, so observing $\\sigma_{b}(t)\\gg\\sigma_{a}(t)$ directly supports long-range inhibition.\n- Suppression of $a$ at intermediate distances where $b$ has diffused but $a$ has not, consistent with $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b}<0$, producing the archetypal “local peak of $a$ with a broad halo of $b$ that inhibits $a$” pattern.\nThis single manipulation thus simultaneously assays the sign structure of the interactions and the crucial diffusion disparity, providing the most direct and compelling evidence for “local activation, long-range inhibition.”\n\nBy contrast:\n- Option A tests $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a}>0$ under uniform forcing but does not probe spatial ranges or inhibition.\n- Option B tests $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b}<0$ globally but not the diffusion disparity or locality of activation.\n- Option D perturbs the inhibitor lifetime, which changes its effective length scale $\\ell_{b}\\sim\\sqrt{D_{b}/\\mu_{b}}$; while a decrease in $\\ell_{b}$ often shifts the dominant wavelength $\\lambda^{*}=2\\pi/k^{*}$ smaller, this is an indirect, model-dependent signature rather than a direct demonstration of short-range versus long-range roles.\n- Option E tests uniform-state stability under uniform additions and is not diagnostic of the spatial roles.\n\nTherefore, introducing a localized pulse of A and measuring spatial distributions over time (Option C) is the most direct and compelling test of A as the short-range activator and B as the long-range inhibitor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1476627"}, {"introduction": "A key, and often counter-intuitive, requirement for Turing patterns is that the inhibitor molecule must diffuse significantly faster than the activator.
