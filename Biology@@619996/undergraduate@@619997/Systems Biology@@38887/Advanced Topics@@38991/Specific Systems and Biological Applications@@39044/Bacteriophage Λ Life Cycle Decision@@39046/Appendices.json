This exercise invites you to explore the very foundation of this switch: the competitive binding of these two proteins to specific operator DNA sequences. By analyzing their differential affinities for the operator sites, you can deduce how the system initiates its commitment to either a lytic or lysogenic fate, a critical skill for deciphering any genetic regulatory network. [@problem_id:1417384]", "problem": "The decision between the lytic and lysogenic life cycles in bacteriophage 位 is controlled by a genetic switch involving two key proteins, CI and Cro, which compete for binding to three operator sites in the right operator region: $O_{R1}$, $O_{R2}$, and $O_{R3}$. These sites regulate two promoters: $P_R$, which drives transcription of the *cro* gene and other lytic genes, and $P_{RM}$, the promoter for repressor maintenance, which drives transcription of the *cI* gene. The binding of proteins to the operator sites can either block or enhance the activity of these promoters.\n\nThe binding affinities of the CI and Cro protein dimers are ordered as follows:\n*   CI affinity: $O_{R1} > O_{R2} > O_{R3}$\n*   Cro affinity: $O_{R3} > O_{R2} > O_{R1}$\n\nFurthermore, the system has these properties:\n*   Binding of a protein to $O_{R1}$ blocks the promoter $P_R$.\n*   Binding of a protein to $O_{R2}$ can also block $P_R$.\n*   Binding of a protein to $O_{R3}$ blocks the promoter $P_{RM}$.\n*   A CI dimer bound at $O_{R2}$ acts as an activator for the promoter $P_{RM}$, enhancing the transcription of the *cI* gene.\n\nFollowing an initial infection where the concentrations of both CI and Cro are low, which of the following statements accurately describes the molecular events that initiate the commitment to the lysogenic pathway?\n\nA. Cro dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R1}$, blocking $P_R$ and allowing CI to accumulate.\n\nB. CI dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R3}$, blocking $P_{RM}$ and thereby auto-regulating its own concentration to a stable, low level.\n\nC. CI dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R1}$, which simultaneously blocks the production of Cro via $P_R$ and activates its own production via $P_{RM}$.\n\nD. Cro dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R3}$, blocking $P_{RM}$ and thus preventing the accumulation of the CI repressor.\n\nE. Both CI and Cro bind with similar affinity to $O_{R2}$, leading to a stochastic outcome where neither pathway is initially favored.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the initial molecular events that lead to the establishment of the lysogenic state, starting from a condition of low concentrations for both CI and Cro proteins. The lysogenic state is characterized by the stable expression of CI and the repression of Cro and other lytic genes.\n\nFirst, we must consider which binding events are most likely to occur at low protein concentrations. Proteins bind most readily to their highest-affinity sites. According to the problem statement:\n- The highest affinity site for CI is $O_{R1}$.\n- The highest affinity site for Cro is $O_{R3}$.\n\nThe question is about the *initiation of the lysogenic pathway*. This means we are looking for a set of events that promotes the accumulation of CI protein while suppressing the accumulation of Cro protein. Let's analyze each option based on the provided rules.\n\nOption A states that Cro dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R1}$. This is incorrect. The problem specifies that Cro's affinity for $O_{R1}$ is its lowest ($O_{R3} > O_{R2} > O_{R1}$). Therefore, this event is highly unlikely at low concentrations.\n\nOption B states that CI dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R3}$. This is also incorrect. CI's affinity for $O_{R3}$ is its lowest ($O_{R1} > O_{R2} > O_{R3}$). Binding to $O_{R3}$ only occurs at very high CI concentrations, where it serves as a negative feedback mechanism to shut off its own production from $P_{RM}$, thus maintaining a stable steady-state. This is a feature of lysogenic maintenance, not initiation.\n\nOption C states that CI dimers bind preferentially to $O_{R1}$. This is correct, as $O_{R1}$ is the highest affinity site for CI. The option then claims this binding has two effects: blocking the production of Cro via $P_R$ and activating its own production via $P_{RM}$. Let's verify this using the rules. The problem states that \"Binding of a protein to $O_{R1}$ blocks the promoter $P_R$.\" This action would repress the transcription of the *cro* gene. The problem also states that \"A CI dimer bound at $O_{R2}$ acts as an activator for the promoter $P_{RM}$.\" This action would enhance the transcription of the *cI* gene, leading to more CI protein. Although activation comes from $O_{R2}$, the initial step toward this outcome is binding at $O_{R1}$. Due to cooperative binding (an unstated but key feature of the real system), binding at $O_{R1}$ greatly facilitates binding at $O_{R2}$. Therefore, the entire cascade of events (repressing the lytic pathway and activating its own synthesis) is initiated by CI binding to $O_{R1}$, driving the system towards the lysogenic state. This statement accurately describes the positive feedback loop that establishes lysogeny.\n\nOption D describes an event that leads to the *lytic* pathway, not the lysogenic one. It correctly states that Cro binds preferentially to its highest affinity site, $O_{R3}$. Binding here blocks $P_{RM}$, as stated in the rules. This prevents the synthesis of CI. Without CI to repress $P_R$, Cro and other lytic genes are expressed, leading to lysis. While this is a possible outcome of the initial infection, it is the pathway that competes with and is opposite to the establishment of lysogeny.\n\nOption E claims that both proteins bind with similar affinity to $O_{R2}$. This is not supported by the affinity data. While $O_{R2}$ is an important site, at the initial low concentrations, binding will be dominated by the highest affinity sites, $O_{R1}$ for CI and $O_{R3}$ for Cro. The race to establish a stable state is primarily between CI occupying $O_{R1}$ and Cro occupying $O_{R3}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the initiation of the lysogenic state is the preferential binding of CI to $O_{R1}$, which creates a positive feedback for CI production and simultaneously represses Cro production.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1417384"}, {"introduction": "While the CI/Cro competition forms the core switch, the cell must first receive signals to 'throw' that switch towards lysogeny. This next practice examines the crucial role of the $P_{RE}$ promoter in establishing the lysogenic state, a process distinct from its long-term maintenance. By considering a mutation that removes this key promoter, you will gain insight into how genetic circuits are structured to respond to transient signals and make robust, long-term decisions. [@problem_id:1417345]", "problem": "Bacteriophage 位 is a virus that infects the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. Upon infection, the phage's genetic regulatory network decides between two distinct life cycles: lysis or lysogeny. The lytic cycle involves rapid replication of the phage, culminating in the destruction (lysis) of the host cell to release new phage particles. The lysogenic cycle involves the integration of the phage genome into the host's chromosome, where it remains dormant and is replicated along with the host's DNA.\n\nThe decision is governed by a small set of interacting genes and promoters. Here is a simplified description of the key components:\n- **CI and Cro proteins**: These are two repressor proteins that act as the core of the switch. High levels of CI protein favor lysogeny, while high levels of Cro protein favor lysis. They mutually repress each other's synthesis.\n- **CII protein**: This is an activator protein and a primary sensor of the cell's physiological state. High and stable levels of CII are required to initiate the lysogenic pathway.\n- **$P_L$ and $P_R$ promoters**: These are strong \"early\" promoters that are active immediately after infection. They drive the expression of genes necessary for both pathways, including the *cro* and *cII* genes.\n- **$P_{RM}$ (Promoter for Repressor Maintenance)**: This promoter controls the *cI* gene. It is responsible for maintaining a stable supply of CI protein during the lysogenic state. This promoter is weak and requires the CI protein itself for activation.\n- **$P_{RE}$ (Promoter for Repressor Establishment)**: This is another promoter that can drive the expression of the *cI* gene. This promoter is specifically and strongly activated by the CII protein. Its purpose is to produce a large, initial burst of CI protein to start the lysogenic cycle.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of bacteriophage 位 in which the DNA sequence for the $P_{RE}$ promoter has been completely deleted. This mutant phage infects a healthy *E. coli* cell. Based on the regulatory logic described, what is the most likely outcome of this infection?\n\nA. The infection will almost always lead to lysogeny.\n\nB. The infection will almost always lead to lysis.\n\nC. The phage will be unable to replicate its DNA or produce any proteins, resulting in a failed infection.\n\nD. The outcome will be random, with lysis and lysogeny occurring at roughly equal frequencies, similar to a wild-type phage.\n\nE. The phage will enter a permanent dormant state inside the host cell without integrating into the chromosome or lysing the cell.", "solution": "Immediately after infection by bacteriophage lambda, the early promoters $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$ are active by default. This drives transcription of early genes including $cro$ and $cII$ from $P_{R}$ and genes from $P_{L}$.\n\nIn the wild type, high and stable CII activates $P_{RE}$, which produces an initial burst of CI. This initial CI then activates $P_{RM}$ (which is weak on its own) to maintain CI at levels sufficient to repress $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$, thereby establishing and maintaining lysogeny.\n\nIn the mutant with $P_{RE}$ deleted:\n1. $P_{RE}$ cannot be activated by CII, so there is no CII-driven burst of $cI$ expression.\n2. $P_{RM}$ is weak and requires CI for activation; without pre-existing CI, $P_{RM}$ cannot produce enough CI to initiate its own positive feedback. Any basal $P_{RM}$ activity is further countered by Cro, which accumulates from $P_{R}$ early.\n3. Cro represses $P_{RM}$, preventing CI production, and modulates operator occupancy to favor the lytic gene expression program. As CII is inherently unstable in healthy cells, its temporary effects (including activation of other CII-responsive promoters) cannot compensate for the absence of CI establishment.\n4. Without CI, there is no repression of $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$ to establish lysogeny, and no maintenance pathway for lysogeny exists. Even if CII transiently activates integrase expression, the lack of CI precludes stable lysogen maintenance and immunity.\n\nTherefore, the regulatory logic shifts strongly toward Cro dominance and the lytic cycle. The most likely outcome is lysis in the vast majority of infections.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1417345"}, {"introduction": "Biological decision-making is rarely clean and deterministic; it occurs in a noisy cellular environment.

The state of this switch is primarily determined by the concentrations of two key repressor proteins: CI (denoted by $c$) and Cro (denoted by $r$). In the phase space of these concentrations, there exist two stable fixed points corresponding to the lysogenic state (high $c$, low $r$) and the lytic state (low $c$, high $r$).
