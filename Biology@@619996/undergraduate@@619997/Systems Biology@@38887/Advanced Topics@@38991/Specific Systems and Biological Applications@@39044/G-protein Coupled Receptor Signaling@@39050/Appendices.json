This binding event triggers a cascade that leads to the production of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial second messenger. The process unfolds in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Receptor Activation:** Under saturating hormone conditions, we assume all GPCRs on the cell surface become activated. Let an activated receptor be denoted by $R^*$.\n2.  **G-protein Activation:** An activated receptor, $R^*$, can catalytically activate G-proteins. This means a single $R^*$ can activate multiple G-proteins sequentially without being consumed in the process. An activated G-protein is denoted by $G^*$.\n3.  **Effector Activation:** An activated G-protein, $G^*$, binds to an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, $A$, to form a 1-to-1 active complex, $[G^*A^*]$. This complex is the species that produces cAMP.\n\nThe maximum possible rate of cAMP production in the cell is directly proportional to the maximum number of $[G^*A^*]$ complexes that can be formed simultaneously.\n\nA particular cell is found to contain a total of $1,000$ GPCR molecules, $10,000$ G-protein molecules, and $2,000$ adenylyl cyclase molecules.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a state where the number of active $[G^*A^*]$ complexes is maximized, which of the following components is the bottleneck that limits this maximum number?\n\nA.

Under saturating hormone, all receptors are activated, so $N_{R^{*}}=N_{R}$. Because $R^{*}$ acts catalytically and is not consumed when activating G-proteins, the number of activated G-proteins can, in principle, reach the total pool of G-proteins, hence the maximal number satisfies\n$$\nN_{G^{*}}^{\\max} \\leq N_{G}, \\quad \\text{and under maximal activation, } N_{G^{*}}^{\\max}=N_{G}.\n$$\nActive cAMP-producing complexes form by a $1{:}1$ binding of $G^{*}$ and $A$ to yield $[G^{*}A^{*}]$.
