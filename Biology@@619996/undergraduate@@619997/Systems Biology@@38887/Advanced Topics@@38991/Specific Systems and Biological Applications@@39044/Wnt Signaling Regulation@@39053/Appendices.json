Using a phase-based model, you will quantify the struggle between intercellular coupling, which promotes synchrony, and intrinsic noise, which disrupts it, providing insight into tissue-level coordination.", "problem": "In developmental biology, the Wnt signaling pathway is crucial for cell fate determination and tissue patterning. The activity of the key downstream transcription factor complex, T-Cell Factor/Lymphoid Enhancer-binding Factor (TCF/LEF), can exhibit oscillations in response to a constant Wnt stimulus. These oscillations are primarily driven by a negative feedback loop involving the target gene Axin2. In a multicellular tissue, the oscillations in neighboring cells are often synchronized through intercellular coupling. However, this synchrony can be disrupted by intrinsic noise inherent in gene expression.\n\nConsider a simplified model of two identical, coupled cells. The oscillatory state of each cell, $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, is described by a single phase variable $\\phi_i(t)$. In the absence of coupling and noise, each cell oscillates with a natural angular frequency $\\omega_0$.

This interaction is modeled using the Kuramoto form, where the coupling term for cell $i$ depends on the phase of its neighbor $j$. For the two-cell system, the coupling term for cell 1 is $\\Gamma \\sin(\\phi_2 - \\phi_1)$ and for cell 2 is $\\Gamma \\sin(\\phi_1 - \\phi_2)$. The parameter $\\Gamma$ is the positive coupling strength.\n\n2.  **Noise**: The dominant source of noise is the stochastic expression of the negative feedback regulator, Axin2. This is modeled as a stochastic force acting on the phase dynamics. The noise term for cell $i$ is $Z_Y(\\phi_i) \\sqrt{2D} \\eta_i(t)$, where:\n    *   $D$ is the noise intensity, representing the magnitude of fluctuations in Axin2 expression.\n    *   $\\eta_i(t)$ are independent Gaussian white noise sources for each cell, satisfying $\\langle \\eta_i(t) \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\eta_i(t) \\eta_j(t') \\rangle = \\delta_{ij} \\delta(t-t')$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta and $\\delta(t-t')$ is the Dirac delta function.\n    *   $Z_Y(\\phi)$ is the phase sensitivity function, which measures how a perturbation in the Axin2 concentration affects the oscillator's phase.
