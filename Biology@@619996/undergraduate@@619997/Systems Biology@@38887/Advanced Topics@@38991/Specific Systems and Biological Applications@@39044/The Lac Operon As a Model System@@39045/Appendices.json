By analyzing this scenario, you will solidify your grasp of negative control and the fundamental logic that governs gene expression in the absence of repression.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating gene regulation in *Escherichia coli* using the lac operon as a model system. The wild-type operon is inducible: in a growth medium where glucose is absent, the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) are transcribed at a high level only when lactose is present.\n\nThe biologist identifies a mutant strain that has a single point mutation in the operator region of the lac operon. This mutation is designated as $O^c$ (operator constitutive). This alteration to the DNA sequence of the operator prevents the LacI repressor protein, which is produced by the *lacI* gene, from binding to it. Assume all other components of the operon, including the promoter, the *lacI* gene itself, and the structural genes, are fully functional.\n\nThe biologist cultures this $O^c$ mutant strain in two different liquid media, both of which completely lack glucose.\n- **Condition 1:** The medium does not contain any lactose.\n- **Condition 2:** The medium contains a high concentration of lactose.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the expected level of transcription of the lac operon's structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) for this $O^c$ mutant strain in Condition 1 and Condition 2, respectively?\n\nA. Low transcription in Condition 1 / High transcription in Condition 2\n\nB. High transcription in Condition 1 / High transcription in Condition 2\n\nC. Low transcription in Condition 1 / Low transcription in Condition 2\n\nD. High transcription in Condition 1 / Low transcription in Condition 2\n\nE. No transcription in Condition 1 / No transcription in Condition 2", "solution": "Principle of lac operon control in wild type: Negative control by LacI repressor and positive control by CRP–cAMP. In the absence of lactose, LacI binds the operator and blocks RNA polymerase, yielding low transcription. In the presence of lactose, allolactose (inducer) binds LacI, preventing operator binding and relieving repression; when glucose is absent, cAMP is high, CRP–cAMP binds upstream and activates RNA polymerase for high transcription.\n\nDefinition of the $O^{c}$ mutation: A mutation in the operator that prevents LacI binding to the operator. Because the operator is the DNA site for repressor binding, an $O^{c}$ allele eliminates negative control by LacI regardless of inducer presence. The promoter, $lacI$, and structural genes are otherwise functional.\n\nApply to the two conditions (both lack glucose):\n- Condition 1 (no lactose): In $O^{c}$, LacI cannot bind the operator even without inducer, so there is no repression. Since glucose is absent, cAMP is high and CRP–cAMP activates transcription. Therefore, transcription of $lacZ$, $lacY$, and $lacA$ is high.\n- Condition 2 (high lactose): As above, the operator cannot bind LacI, so repression is absent. With glucose absent, CRP–cAMP activates transcription. Therefore, transcription is high.\n\nConclusion: High transcription in Condition 1 and High transcription in Condition 2, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1473268"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic principles of regulation, this problem explores how genetic components interact within a more complex cellular environment. The use of a partial diploid, or merodiploid, cell [@problem_id:1473290] requires you to apply the critical distinction between *cis*-acting DNA elements and *trans*-acting protein factors. Solving this puzzle is key to understanding genetic complementation tests and the modular nature of gene circuits used in synthetic biology.", "problem": "A bioengineering student is designing a synthetic gene circuit in *Escherichia coli* to control the production of an enzyme. The student creates a partial diploid strain of *E. coli* using an F' plasmid. The genotype of the bacterial chromosome is $I^+ O^+ Z^-$, while the genotype of the F' plasmid is $I^- O^+ Z^+$.\n\nThe components of this system are defined as follows:\n- The lacI gene ($I$) codes for a repressor protein. The allele $I^+$ produces a functional repressor, while $I^-$ produces a non-functional repressor.\n- The operator ($O$) is a segment of DNA to which the repressor protein binds. The allele $O^+$ is a normal operator site.\n- The lacZ gene ($Z$) codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase. The allele $Z^+$ produces functional β-galactosidase, while $Z^-$ produces a non-functional version of the enzyme.\n\nThe repressor protein binds to the operator to block transcription. Lactose (or its metabolite, allolactose) can bind to the functional repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator.\n\nBased on this genetic arrangement, which of the following statements correctly describes the production of functional β-galactosidase in this partial diploid cell?\n\nA. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose.\n\nB. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but its synthesis is constitutive (occurs regardless of the presence of lactose).\n\nC. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized under any condition.\n\nD. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized because the functional repressor protein produced from the $I^+$ allele can only act on the adjacent $Z^−$ gene on the chromosome.\n\nE. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but only in the absence of lactose.", "solution": "The chromosomal genotype is $I^{+} O^{+} Z^{-}$ and the F' plasmid genotype is $I^{-} O^{+} Z^{+}$. The molecular logic of the lac system required here is as follows: the product of $I$ (the LacI repressor) is a trans-acting diffusible protein; the operator $O$ is a cis-acting DNA site; a functional repressor (from $I^{+}$) binds to an $O^{+}$ operator to block transcription; lactose (or allolactose) binds a functional repressor to prevent its operator binding and thereby induces transcription. The $Z^{+}$ allele produces functional beta-galactosidase when transcribed, whereas $Z^{-}$ cannot produce functional enzyme.\n\nFrom $I^{+} O^{+} Z^{-}$ on the chromosome, a functional LacI repressor is produced. Because LacI is trans-acting, the repressor diffuses and can bind to any $O^{+}$ operator in the cell, including both the chromosomal $O^{+}$ and the plasmid $O^{+}$. The plasmid $I^{-}$ produces no functional repressor and does not interfere (there is no dominant negative specified). Therefore, in the absence of lactose, the functional repressor from $I^{+}$ binds both $O^{+}$ sites and blocks transcription from both operons. Under these conditions, the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ cannot produce functional enzyme regardless, and the plasmid $Z^{+}$ is repressed, so no functional beta-galactosidase is synthesized.\n\nIn the presence of lactose (or allolactose), the inducer binds the functional LacI repressor and prevents its binding to $O^{+}$. With the operators unoccupied, transcription proceeds from both operons. The chromosomal $Z^{-}$ still cannot produce functional enzyme, but the plasmid $Z^{+}$ is transcribed and translated into functional beta-galactosidase. Thus, functional enzyme is synthesized only when lactose is present, i.e., synthesis is inducible.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that functional beta-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose. This matches option A and rules out: B (would require $O^{c}$ or no functional $I$), C (contradicted by inducible expression from $Z^{+}$ on the plasmid), D (incorrectly asserts the repressor acts only in cis), and E (inverted regulation).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473290"}, {"introduction": "This practice shifts the focus from predicting outcomes to designing experiments. Presented with two mutant strains that cannot metabolize lactose [@problem_id:1473260], your task is to think like a scientist and devise a definitive test to identify the specific gene at fault. This problem emphasizes the importance of understanding the distinct functions of the lactose permease ($lacY$) and $\\beta$-galactosidase ($lacZ$) and how clever experimental tools can isolate their activities.", "problem": "A systems biology student is tasked with identifying two unknown mutant strains of *E. coli*, labeled Strain 1 and Strain 2. Both strains are lac-negative, meaning they cannot metabolize lactose. It is known that one strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the *lacZ* gene, which codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase, while the other has a loss-of-function mutation in the *lacY* gene, which codes for the lactose permease protein.\n\nTo distinguish between them, the student performs the following experiment. Both strains are cultured separately in a liquid growth medium that contains Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), a substance that induces the expression of the lac operon but is not broken down by β-galactosidase. After a period of growth, the cells from each culture are harvested and lysed to release their internal cellular contents into a buffer. Finally, ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside), a colorless chromogenic substrate, is added to each of the two cell lysates. β-galactosidase cleaves ONPG to produce galactose and o-nitrophenol, the latter of which is intensely yellow.\n\nAssuming the experiment is performed correctly, which of the following outcomes would correctly identify the genotypes of Strain 1 and Strain 2?\n\nA. The lysate from Strain 1 turns yellow, and the lysate from Strain 2 remains colorless. This indicates that Strain 1 has the *lacY* mutation and Strain 2 has the *lacZ* mutation.\n\nB. The lysate from Strain 1 remains colorless, and the lysate from Strain 2 turns yellow. This indicates that Strain 1 has the *lacZ* mutation and Strain 2 has the *lacY* mutation.\n\nC. The lysates from both Strain 1 and Strain 2 turn yellow. This indicates the experiment cannot distinguish between the two mutations.\n\nD. The lysates from both Strain 1 and Strain 2 remain colorless. This indicates a failure in the experimental procedure, such as inactive IPTG.", "solution": "We identify the logic of the assay by mapping genotype to enzyme presence and the need for transport:\n1) Gene functions:\n- lacZ encodes beta-galactosidase, the enzyme that cleaves ONPG to yield o-nitrophenol (yellow). Thus, functional lacZ is necessary and sufficient for yellow color in a lysate when ONPG is present.\n- lacY encodes lactose permease, which transports lactose (and facilitates IPTG uptake) into intact cells. In a lysate, substrate entry is no longer limited by membrane transport, so lacY is irrelevant to ONPG access to the enzyme after lysis.\n\n2) Induction with IPTG:\n- IPTG induces the lac operon. A strain with a functional lacZ gene will produce beta-galactosidase upon induction. A lacZ loss-of-function strain will not produce active enzyme regardless of induction.\n- The use of IPTG ensures that any strain with intact lacZ will express the enzyme before lysis. Whether IPTG uptake required lacY in intact cells is made immaterial for the readout, because the reaction measured occurs post-lysis.\n\n3) Readout with ONPG in lysate:\n- After lysis, ONPG is added directly to the cell extract. The permease is not needed because there is no membrane barrier. Therefore:\n  - If the strain is lacZ^{+} (and induced), the lysate contains active beta-galactosidase and turns yellow due to o-nitrophenol production.\n  - If the strain is lacZ^{-}, the lysate lacks active enzyme and remains colorless.\n\n4) Mapping outcomes to genotypes:\n- Yellow lysate implies functional lacZ; hence that strain must be the lacY mutant (lacY^{-}, lacZ^{+}).\n- Colorless lysate implies nonfunctional lacZ; hence that strain must be the lacZ mutant (lacZ^{-}).\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome-description pair is: the lysate from Strain 1 turns yellow and Strain 2 remains colorless, indicating Strain 1 is the lacY mutant and Strain 2 is the lacZ mutant, which corresponds to option A. Options C and D contradict the premise that exactly one strain is lacZ^{-} and the experiment is performed correctly, while option B inverts the genotype-color logic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473260"}]}
