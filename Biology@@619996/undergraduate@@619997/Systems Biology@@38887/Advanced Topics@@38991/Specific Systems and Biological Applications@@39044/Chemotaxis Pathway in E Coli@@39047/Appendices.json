This movement is achieved by rotating its flagella. A \"run\" consists of a period of smooth swimming, while a \"tumble\" is a brief, random reorientation event that changes the cell's direction. In a wild-type cell, the flagellar motors can switch between two rotational states to produce this pattern.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli*. In this strain, a specific mutation in the flagellar motor switch complex, which involves proteins like FliM, FliG, and FliN, has caused the motors to be permanently locked. The flagella can only rotate in the counter-clockwise (CCW) direction and can never switch to the clockwise (CW) direction.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the resulting motility of this mutant *E. coli* cell?\n\nA. The cell will only be able to tumble, constantly changing its direction without making significant forward progress.\n\nB.

The cell will alternate between rapid forward movement and rapid backward movement along a straight line.", "solution": "Wild-type peritrichous Escherichia coli swim by a run-and-tumble mechanism mediated by their flagellar motors:\n- When flagella rotate counter-clockwise (CCW), they form a coherent bundle that produces a smooth forward swim, called a run.\n- When one or more motors switch to clockwise (CW), the bundle flies apart, leading to an unbundled, reorienting state called a tumble. Switching between CCW and CW thus alternates runs and tumbles and enables random reorientation.\n\nIn the mutant described, the switch complex is locked so that the motors can only rotate CCW and never switch to CW. Therefore:\n- The flagella remain bundled continuously.\n- The cell will maintain smooth forward swimming without motor-driven reorientation because tumbles require CW rotation to disrupt the bundle.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is incorrect because exclusive tumbling requires CW rotation to disrupt the bundle; with only CCW, the cell cannot tumble.\n- B is correct: with only CCW rotation, the cell will run continuously without tumbling.\n- C is incorrect: CCW rotation alone is sufficient for motility; both directions are not required for movement.\n- D is incorrect: even in a uniform environment, wild-type cells still tumble intermittently, so the mutantâ€™s behavior (no tumbles) is distinguishable.\n- E is incorrect: peritrichous E. coli do not alternate rapid forward and backward movement along a straight line under CCW-only rotation; backward swimming in this form would require different bundle states not produced here.\n\nTherefore, the best description is continuous smooth swimming without reorientation events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1423133"}, {"introduction": "Having established the motor's function, we now move upstream to dissect the core signaling cascade that controls it. The proteins CheA and CheY form the critical link between sensory input and motor output. By predicting the behavior of cells missing one of these components, you will practice the classic genetic approach of using knockout mutants to uncover the logic of a biological pathway [@problem_id:1423161].", "problem": "The bacterium *Escherichia coli* navigates its environment using a \"run and tumble\" strategy, which is controlled by a renowned signal transduction pathway known as the chemotaxis pathway. The cell's movement is driven by rotating flagella. The default state of the flagellar motor is counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation, which results in the flagella forming a bundle that propels the cell forward in a smooth \"run.\"\n\nThe switch to a \"tumble\" is induced by a change in the motor's rotation to clockwise (CW), which causes the flagellar bundle to fly apart and the cell to reorient randomly. This switch is biochemically controlled. A sensory kinase, CheA, when active, autophosphorylates and subsequently transfers its phosphoryl group to a response regulator protein, CheY. This phosphorylated form, CheY-P, is the key signaling molecule. CheY-P binds to the switch complex of the flagellar motor, inducing the transition from CCW to CW rotation, thereby causing a tumble. In the absence of CheY-P binding, the motor spins CCW, resulting in a run.\n\nConsider two distinct mutant strains of *E. coli*.\n- **Mutant 1**: Has a null mutation in the gene encoding CheA (`cheA`). This strain, denoted $\\Delta$CheA, produces no functional CheA protein.\n- **Mutant 2**: Has a null mutation in the gene encoding CheY (`cheY`).

Both the $\\Delta$CheA and $\\Delta$CheY mutants will exhibit a normal run-and-tumble pattern, indistinguishable from wild-type.", "solution": "The chemotaxis motor logic is as follows: in the absence of CheY-P bound to the motor switch, the flagellar motor rotates CCW, producing a run; when CheY is phosphorylated to CheY-P and binds the motor, it induces CW rotation, producing a tumble. The biochemical generation of CheY-P requires the kinase CheA, which autophosphorylates and transfers the phosphoryl group to CheY, yielding CheY-P.\n\nFormally, the implications for motor state are:\n- If CheY-P is present and bound to the motor, then the motor rotates CW, leading to a tumble.\n- If CheY-P is absent, the motor defaults to CCW, leading to a run.\n\nFor the mutant strains:\n1) In the $\\Delta$CheA mutant, there is no functional CheA. Without CheA, there is no autophosphorylation of CheA and thus no phosphotransfer to CheY. Therefore, the production rate of CheY-P is effectively zero, resulting in no CheY-P at the motor. By the motor logic above, absence of CheY-P yields continuous CCW rotation and hence only runs.\n\n2) In the $\\Delta$CheY mutant, there is no functional CheY. Without CheY, there is no substrate to receive phosphate from CheA, so CheY-P cannot be produced regardless of CheA activity. Consequently, CheY-P is absent at the motor, and the motor remains in the default CCW state, producing only runs.\n\nTherefore, both $\\Delta$CheA and $\\Delta$CheY mutants exhibit run-only behavior.

Receptor clusters do not act as simple switches; they perform sophisticated signal integration, a behavior captured by the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. This problem challenges you to derive the activity of a receptor cluster, providing hands-on experience with the mathematical tools used to describe allosteric regulation in systems biology [@problem_id:1423148].", "problem": "In the study of bacterial chemotaxis, the behavior of receptor clusters is often described using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for allostery. Consider a simplified model of a receptor cluster, such as those formed by Methyl-accepting Chemotaxis Proteins (MCPs), that controls the activity of the histidine kinase CheA.\n\nThe entire cluster is treated as a single cooperative unit that can exist in two distinct conformational states: an active (ON) state and an inactive (OFF) state. The phosphorylation activity of CheA is directly proportional to the probability, $P_{ON}$, that the receptor cluster is in the ON state.\n\nThis receptor cluster has a total of $N$ identical and independent binding sites. In the absence of any bound signaling molecules (ligands), the free energy of the ON state is greater than that of the OFF state by an amount $F_0$. We define a dimensionless free energy difference $E = F_0 / (k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe cluster is situated in an environment containing two different attractant ligands, which we will call Ligand 1 and Ligand 2, at constant concentrations $[L_1]$ and $[L_2]$, respectively. These two ligands compete to bind to the same $N$ sites on the receptor cluster. The binding affinities depend on the conformational state of the cluster and are given by the following dissociation constants:\n-   $K_I^{(1)}$ and $K_A^{(1)}$: Dissociation constants for Ligand 1 binding to the cluster in the OFF and ON states, respectively.\n-   $K_I^{(2)}$ and $K_A^{(2)}$: Dissociation constants for Ligand 2 binding to the cluster in the OFF and ON states, respectively.\n\nDerive a self-contained, closed-form analytical expression for the steady-state probability, $P_{ON}$, that the receptor cluster is in the active state.
