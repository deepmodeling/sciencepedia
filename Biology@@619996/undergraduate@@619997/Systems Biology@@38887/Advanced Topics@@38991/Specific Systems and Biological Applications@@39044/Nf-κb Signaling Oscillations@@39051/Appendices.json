Its activity is tightly regulated by a family of inhibitory proteins, primarily the Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB).\n\nConsider a simplified model of this system in a typical mammalian cell:\n1.  In an unstimulated (resting) state, IκB binds to NF-κB, forming a complex. This binding masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, causing the complex to be retained in the cytoplasm.\n2.  Upon receiving a specific external stimulus, a signaling cascade is triggered that leads to the rapid degradation of the IκB protein.\n3.  The degradation of IκB frees NF-κB, unmasking its nuclear localization signal. This allows NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus.\n4.  Inside the nucleus, NF-κB functions as a transcription factor, activating a suite of genes. One of the essential genes that NF-κB activates is the gene that codes for the IκB protein itself. This newly synthesized IκB then enters the nucleus, binds to NF-κB, and shuttles it back to the cytoplasm, thereby downregulating the response.\n\nNow, consider a mutant cell line in which the gene encoding the IκB protein has been completely and permanently knocked out, meaning the cell is incapable of producing any IκB protein. Assuming a low, basal level of stimulus signaling is always present (enough to trigger the degradation pathway for IκB if it were present), predict the predominant steady-state subcellular localization of the NF-κB protein in this mutant cell.\n\nA.

Newly synthesized $\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}$ then enters the nucleus, binds $\\text{NF-}\\kappa\\text{B}$, and exports it to the cytoplasm, forming a negative feedback loop that can produce oscillations or transient nuclear localization in wild-type cells.\n\nSecond, in the mutant cell with a complete knockout of the $\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}$ gene, the synthesis rate of $\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}$ is zero and its concentration satisfies $[\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}]=0$ at steady state. The basal stimulus that would normally trigger $\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}$ degradation has no additional effect because there is no $\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}$ to degrade.\n\nThird, with $[\\text{I}\\kappa\\text{B}]=0$, the NLS of $\\text{NF-}\\kappa\\text{B}$ remains unmasked.

In a typical cell, most NF-κB is held inactive in the cytoplasm by binding to an inhibitor protein called Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα). When the cell is exposed to a specific stimulus, a signaling cascade is triggered that leads to the degradation of IκBα. This releases NF-κB, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus.\n\nOnce in the nucleus, NF-κB acts as a transcription factor, activating the expression of numerous genes. One of the primary genes it activates is the gene that codes for its own inhibitor, IκBα. The newly synthesized IκBα mRNA is translated into IκBα protein, which then enters the nucleus, binds to NF-κB, and exports the entire complex back into the cytoplasm. This removal of NF-κB from the nucleus terminates its activity and completes a negative feedback loop, which results in oscillations of nuclear NF-κB concentration over time.\n\nConsider a population of cells that are being continuously exposed to this stimulus, causing sustained oscillations in their nuclear NF-κB levels. At a time when the nuclear NF-κB concentration is near its peak, a potent drug that instantly and completely halts all gene transcription (i.e., the synthesis of mRNA from a DNA template) is introduced to the cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the subsequent behavior of the nuclear NF-κB concentration?\n\nA.

In typical NF-κB models, nuclear export and termination of nuclear activity largely require binding to newly synthesized IκBα; in the absence of transcription, that route is eliminated. Therefore, after any brief transient due to pre-existing $M$ and $I$, the system lacks the delayed negative feedback necessary for oscillations, and $N(t)$ approaches and remains at a high, sustained level determined by import and any residual, IκBα-independent losses. It neither continues oscillating (feedback removed), nor drops to a low level (export suppressed), nor immediately crashes to zero (NF-κB is not rapidly degraded by blocking transcription).\n\nHence, the nuclear NF-κB concentration will cease oscillating and remain high.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1454053"}, {"introduction": "Qualitative intuition about biological circuits can be made precise and predictive through mathematical modeling, a cornerstone of systems biology.
