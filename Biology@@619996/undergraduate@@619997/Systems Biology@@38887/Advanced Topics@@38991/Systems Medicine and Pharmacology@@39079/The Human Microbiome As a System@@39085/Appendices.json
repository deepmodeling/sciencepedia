The colon is treated as a single, well-mixed compartment. The nutrient, with a concentration denoted by $N(t)$ at time $t$, is continuously introduced into this compartment at a constant rate $I$, which represents the net effect of dietary intake and absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This nutrient is cleared from the compartment through two primary mechanisms. First, there is a constant fractional washout or dilution due to gut motility, which occurs at a rate proportional to the nutrient's current concentration $N(t)$, governed by a dilution rate constant $d$. Second, the nutrient is consumed by a specific bacterial species. The population of this bacterium is assumed to be large and stable, maintained at a constant density $B$. The rate of nutrient consumption by this bacterial population is jointly proportional to the nutrient concentration $N(t)$ and the bacterial density $B$, with a specific consumption rate constant $k$.\n\nBased on this model, determine the steady-state concentration of the nutrient, $N_{ss}$, in the colon.

This means our objective is to maximize $J_B = 1.3 v_B$. Maximizing $J_B$ is equivalent to maximizing the flux $v_B$.\n\nWe must consider the constraints on the system.\nFirst, the problem states that the system is at a steady state for the intermediate metabolite `M`. This means the total rate of production of `M` must equal the total rate of consumption of `M`.\n-   Rate of production of `M` comes from *Species A*'s reaction.
