This exercise [@problem_id:1448344] guides you through finding the \"pathogen-clearance\" or \"disease-free\" steady state, which represents the scenario where the host cell population fully recovers and the pathogen is eliminated. Understanding this baseline state is crucial as it defines the conditions under which an infection fails to establish itself, allowing the host population to return to its natural carrying capacity, $K$.", "problem": "A simplified model for the interaction between a lytic virus and a population of host cells in a culture is described by the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = r H \\left(1 - \\frac{H}{K}\\right) - \\beta H V\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = p \\beta H V - \\delta V\n$$\nHere, $H(t)$ is the concentration of healthy host cells and $V(t)$ is the concentration of free virus particles at time $t$. The parameters of the model are all positive real numbers:\n*   $r$: the intrinsic growth rate of the host cells.\n*   $K$: the carrying capacity of the cell culture environment.\n*   $\\beta$: the rate constant of infection.\n*   $p$: the burst size, representing the number of new virions released upon the lysis of a single infected cell.\n*   $\\delta$: the clearance rate of the virus particles.\n\nThere exists a steady-state solution to this system where the virus population is entirely cleared, but the host cell population survives. Determine the concentration of healthy host cells, $H^*$, for this \"pathogen-clearance\" steady-state.

This is the condition where the virus population is zero, so we set $V^* = 0$.\n\nLet's first analyze Equation (2) with $V^*=0$:\n$$\n0 = p \\beta H^* (0) - \\delta (0)\n$$\nThis simplifies to $0=0$. This equation is satisfied for any value of $H^*$ when $V^*=0$, so it does not constrain the value of $H^*$ for this steady state.\n\nNow, we substitute $V^*=0$ into Equation (1):\n$$\n0 = r H^* \\left(1 - \\frac{H^*}{K}\\right) - \\beta H^* (0)\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side disappears, leaving:\n$$\n0 = r H^* \\left(1 - \\frac{H^*}{K}\\right)\n$$\nSince $r$ is a positive constant, for this equation to hold, one of the other factors must be zero. This gives two possible solutions for $H^*$:\n1.  $H^* = 0$\n2.  $1 - \\frac{H^*}{K} = 0$\n\nLet's solve the second case for $H^*$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{H^*}{K}\n$$\n$$\nH^* = K\n$$\nThis gives us two possible steady-states where the virus is absent ($V^*=0$):\n*   State 1: $(H^*, V^*) = (0, 0)$. This is the trivial \"washout\" state where both the host cells and the virus have been eliminated from the system.\n*   State 2: $(H^*, V^*) = (K, 0)$. This is the state where the virus is absent, and the host cell population has grown to the environment's carrying capacity, $K$.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state where \"the host cell population survives\". This condition implies that $H^* > 0$. Therefore, we must choose the second solution, as the first solution corresponds to the extinction of the host cells.\n\nThus, the concentration of healthy host cells in the pathogen-clearance steady-state is $K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{K}$$", "id": "1448344"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of simple equilibria, we now explore the more complex and clinically relevant scenario of a persistent infection.
