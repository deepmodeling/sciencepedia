This capstone problem challenges you to build a coupled Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that connects a patient's unique genetics to their personal risk of drug-induced arrhythmia. By linking a drug's concentration profile to its effect on cardiac ion channels, you will quantify the total time a patient remains in a high-risk state, a prime example of predictive, personalized medicine [@problem_id:1457241].", "id": "1457241", "problem": "In the development of a novel pharmaceutical compound, a critical aspect of preclinical safety assessment is understanding its potential for causing cardiac arrhythmias. This risk is often associated with the drug's unintended inhibition of the hERG (human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene) potassium channel, which is crucial for cardiac repolarization. A personalized medicine approach aims to predict this risk by creating patient-specific Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models.\n\nConsider a patient who receives a single intravenous (IV) bolus dose, $D$, of this new drug. The drug's concentration in the plasma, $C(t)$, is well-described by a single-compartment PK model:\n$$C(t) = \\left(\\frac{D}{V_d}\\right) \\exp(-k_{el}t)$$\nwhere $V_d$ is the volume of distribution and $k_{el}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The value of $k_{el}$ is highly dependent on the patient's metabolic phenotype, governed by their Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme genetics.\n\nThe drug's primary pharmacodynamic effect of concern is the blockade of the hERG channel current, $I_{Kr}$. The fraction of channels blocked, $f_b$, at a given drug concentration $C(t)$ is modeled by a simple competitive binding equation:\n$$f_b(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{C(t) + K_i}$$\nwhere $K_i$ is the concentration at which 50% of the channels are inhibited. The value of $K_i$ can be altered by specific genetic variants in the KCNH2 gene, which encodes the hERG channel.\n\nThe blockade of the hERG channel prolongs the cardiac Action Potential Duration (APD).
