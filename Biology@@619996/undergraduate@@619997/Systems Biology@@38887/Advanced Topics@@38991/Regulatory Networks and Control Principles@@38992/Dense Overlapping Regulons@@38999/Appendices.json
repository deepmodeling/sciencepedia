{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The complexity of gene regulation often emerges from simple, elegant rules. At the heart of dense overlapping regulons is the concept of combinatorial control, where multiple transcription factors (TFs) integrate signals to determine a gene's fate. This first exercise allows you to practice translating a biological narrative of activation and repression into the precise language of Boolean logic, a foundational skill for modeling and designing genetic circuits. By determining the logical operation that governs a co-regulated gene, you are taking the first step in abstracting biological interactions into a formal, predictive model [@problem_id:1427524].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a bacterial gene responsible for producing a blue pigment is placed under the control of a synthetic promoter. This promoter's activity is regulated by two distinct Transcription Factors (TFs), TF-X and TF-Y, whose presence or absence can be controlled by the researchers. The regulatory logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **TF-X** is an **activator**. For the transcription of the pigment gene to begin, TF-X must be present and bound to its specific operator site on the promoter. In the absence of TF-X, the gene is silent.\n2.  **TF-Y** is a **repressor**. When TF-Y is present, it binds to a different operator site on the same promoter. This binding event physically obstructs the transcriptional machinery, preventing gene expression entirely, even if the activator TF-X is also present and bound.\n\nLet's represent the presence of a TF with the logical value `TRUE` (or `1`) and its absence with `FALSE` (or `0`). Similarly, let the expression of the blue pigment gene be represented by an output that is `TRUE` (`1`) when the pigment is produced (cell is blue) and `FALSE` (`0`) when it is not (cell is colorless).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following logical operations best describes the output (pigment production) as a function of the inputs (presence of TF-X and TF-Y)?\n\nA. X OR Y\n\nB. X AND Y\n\nC. (NOT X) AND Y\n\nD. X AND (NOT Y)\n\nE. X XOR Y", "solution": "Let the inputs be $X$ for the presence of TF-X and $Y$ for the presence of TF-Y, each taking values in $\\{0,1\\}$. Let the output be $O$, where $O=1$ indicates pigment expression and $O=0$ indicates no expression.\n\nBy the problem statement:\n- TF-X is required for activation. Thus, if $X=0$, the gene is silent regardless of $Y$, so $O=0$ whenever $X=0$.\n- TF-Y is a repressor that blocks expression even if TF-X is present. Thus, if $Y=1$, the gene is silent regardless of $X$, so $O=0$ whenever $Y=1$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the only case that yields expression is when $X=1$ and $Y=0$. Therefore,\n$$\nO = X \\land \\neg Y.\n$$\nComparing with the options, this corresponds to X AND (NOT Y), which is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1427524"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the logic at a single gene to a systems-level view, we often need to quantify the relationships between different regulators. When two TFs control overlapping sets of genes, how significant is this overlap? This practice introduces a cornerstone metric from ecology and data science—the Jaccard index—and applies it to quantify the similarity between two regulons. Mastering this calculation is essential for interpreting data from high-throughput experiments like ChIP-seq or RNA-seq, which aim to map the genome-wide reach of transcription factors [@problem_id:1427545].", "problem": "In systems biology, the study of gene regulatory networks often involves analyzing the overlap between sets of genes controlled by different Transcription Factors (TFs). A TF is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. The set of all genes regulated by a single TF is called its regulon.\n\nConsider a bacterium subjected to two different environmental stresses. The response to the first stress is primarily controlled by TF A, while the response to the second stress is controlled by TF B.\n- The regulon for TF A consists of 50 genes.\n- The regulon for TF B consists of 40 genes.\n- A detailed analysis reveals that 20 genes are common to both regulons, meaning they are co-regulated by both TF A and TF B.\n\nA common metric to quantify the similarity between these two regulons is the ratio of the size of their intersection (the number of co-regulated genes) to the size of their union (the total number of unique genes regulated by TF A, or TF B, or both).\n\nCalculate this similarity metric for the regulons of TF A and TF B. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We define the regulons as sets $A$ and $B$ with $|A|=50$, $|B|=40$, and intersection $|A \\cap B|=20$.

What happens when an activator and a repressor don't just signal their presence but actively compete for control of a promoter? This problem challenges you to develop a more sophisticated, mechanistic model based on the principles of chemical equilibrium. By deriving an expression for the gene's transcription rate under competitive binding, you will learn how to predict the quantitative output of a regulatory system, bridging the gap between simple logic gates and the continuous, analog nature of gene expression [@problem_id:1427556].", "problem": "A synthetic gene circuit is designed to control the expression of a reporter gene. The promoter of this gene contains a single operator site that can be bound by either an activator protein, which we will call $A$, or a repressor protein, which we will call $B$.
