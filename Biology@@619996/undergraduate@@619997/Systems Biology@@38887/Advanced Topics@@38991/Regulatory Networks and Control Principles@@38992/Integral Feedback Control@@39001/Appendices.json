This exercise challenges you to distinguish between proportional and integral feedback control based solely on how a system responds to a persistent disturbance. By analyzing the system's output, you will learn to identify the unique signature of integral feedback: its ability to achieve robust perfect adaptation, a fundamental property that makes it ubiquitous in biological homeostasis.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a strain of E. coli is engineered to produce a valuable metabolite, 'Metabolite X'. The genetic circuit is designed to maintain a homeostatic intracellular concentration of Metabolite X at a specific setpoint, $C_0$. Two potential designs for the regulatory feedback loop are being considered. The first is a proportional feedback controller, where the rate of synthesis of an enzyme that produces Metabolite X is adjusted in direct proportion to the difference between the setpoint $C_0$ and the current concentration $C(t)$. The second is an integral feedback controller, where the rate of synthesis of this enzyme is adjusted based on the accumulated (integrated) difference between $C_0$ and $C(t)$ over time.\n\nTo test the system's behavior, an experiment is performed. The cells are initially at a steady state with the concentration of Metabolite X at the setpoint $C_0$. At time $t=0$, a persistent perturbation is introduced by activating a gene for a transport protein that continuously pumps Metabolite X out of the cell at a constant rate. The concentration of Metabolite X, $C(t)$, is then monitored.\n\nBelow are four descriptions of the possible time evolution of the concentration $C(t)$ for $t > 0$. Which of these descriptions is uniquely characteristic of a system regulated by integral feedback control?\n\nA. The concentration $C(t)$ initially drops below $C_0$. The feedback system then activates, causing the concentration to increase, and after a period of adjustment, it returns precisely to the original setpoint concentration $C_0$.\n\nB. The concentration $C(t)$ initially drops below $C_0$. The feedback system then activates, causing the concentration to increase, but it stabilizes at a new, constant steady-state concentration $C_f$ that is strictly less than the original setpoint $C_0$.\n\nC. The concentration $C(t)$ begins to drop from $C_0$ and continues to decrease until it reaches a new, very low steady-state concentration, with the system showing no significant attempt to counteract the drop and return towards $C_0$.\n\nD. The concentration $C(t)$ initially drops below $C_0$, but the feedback system overcorrects, causing the concentration to rise above $C_0$, then fall below it again, leading to sustained oscillations around some value less than $C_0$.", "solution": "Let $C(t)$ denote the intracellular concentration of Metabolite X. Let the enzyme synthesis control input be $u(t)$, and let the persistent export perturbation (activated at $t=0$) be a constant $d>0$ representing an outflux rate. Consider a linearized plant model about the pre-perturbation steady state $C_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}=p\\,u-k\\,C-d,\n$$\nwhere $p>0$ maps enzyme synthesis rate to net production of Metabolite X and $k>0$ represents aggregate first-order loss or dilution. Before perturbation ($d=0$), the system is at steady state $C=C_{0}$ with some baseline input $u=u_{0}$ satisfying\n$$\n0=p\\,u_{0}-k\\,C_{0}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad u_{0}=\\frac{k}{p}C_{0}.\n$$\nDefine the deviations $x(t)=C(t)-C_{0}$ and $v(t)=u(t)-u_{0}$. Subtracting the pre-perturbation balance from the plant dynamics gives the deviation dynamics for $t\\geq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=p\\,v-k\\,x-d.\n$$\nLet the regulation objective be to maintain $C(t)\\to C_{0}$, equivalently $x(t)\\to 0$. Define the regulation error $e(t)=C_{0}-C(t)=-x(t)$.\n\nProportional control: $v(t)=K_{p}\\,e(t)=-K_{p}\\,x(t)$ with $K_{p}>0$. Substituting into the plant yields\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=p\\big(-K_{p}x\\big)-k\\,x-d=-(pK_{p}+k)\\,x-d.\n$$\nAt steady state, $dx/dt=0$ gives\n$$\n0=-(pK_{p}+k)\\,x_{\\text{ss}}-d\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x_{\\text{ss}}=-\\frac{d}{pK_{p}+k}.\n$$\nTherefore the steady-state error is\n$$\ne_{\\text{ss}}=-x_{\\text{ss}}=\\frac{d}{pK_{p}+k}>0,\n$$\nso $C_{\\text{ss}}=C_{0}-e_{\\text{ss}}<C_{0}$. Thus proportional control under a constant disturbance yields a nonzero steady-state error (adaptation is imperfect), matching description B.\n\nIntegral control: $v(t)$ is driven by the integral of the error, which can be written in differential form as\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt}=K_{i}\\,e(t)=-K_{i}\\,x(t),\n$$\nwith $K_{i}>0$. Consider the steady state of the closed loop. At steady state, $\\frac{dv}{dt}=0$ implies $e_{\\text{ss}}=0$, hence $x_{\\text{ss}}=0$ and therefore $C_{\\text{ss}}=C_{0}$. Consistency with the plant equation at steady state requires\n$$\n0=p\\,v_{\\text{ss}}-k\\,x_{\\text{ss}}-d=p\\,v_{\\text{ss}}-d\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v_{\\text{ss}}=\\frac{d}{p},\n$$\nwhich is finite. Thus the integral controller adjusts $u$ by a constant offset exactly sufficient to cancel the constant disturbance, achieving zero steady-state error, i.e., perfect adaptation back to $C_{0}$ after transients. This behavior is uniquely characteristic of integral feedback under constant disturbances, matching description A.\n\nFor completeness, with no effective feedback action one would have $v=0$ and\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=-k\\,x-d\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x_{\\text{ss}}=-\\frac{d}{k},\n$$\ncorresponding to a drop to a low steady state (description C). Sustained oscillations (description D) may arise from poorly tuned feedback of various kinds and are not uniquely indicative of integral control; moreover, integral controlâ€™s hallmark is zero steady-state error to constant disturbances, not persistent oscillations below the setpoint.\n\nTherefore, the uniquely characteristic description of integral feedback control is the return precisely to the original setpoint $C_{0}$ despite the constant perturbation, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1439507"}, {"introduction": "While recognizing the final outcome of integral control is crucial, understanding the journey to that new steady state is equally important.
