The rate of production of the response protein $R$ is directly proportional to the signal strength $S$, with a proportionality constant $k_p$.\n2. The protein $R$ is subject to a basal degradation, following first-order kinetics with a rate constant $d_R$. Additionally, the inhibitor $I$ enhances the degradation of $R$, with this enhanced degradation rate being proportional to the product of the concentrations of $R$ and $I$, with a constant $k_i$.\n3. The inhibitor protein $I$ is produced at a rate proportional to the concentration of the response protein $R$, with a constant $k_a$.\n4. The inhibitor protein $I$ is removed from the system through a zero-order process (i.e., at a constant rate), with a rate constant $k_d$. This zero-order removal is a key feature that enables perfect adaptation, meaning the steady-state concentration of $R$ in the WT organism is independent of the input signal strength $S$.\n\nNow, consider a mutant strain of the organism where the gene encoding the inhibitor protein $I$ has been completely removed (a \"knockout\"). As a result, the concentration of $I$ is always zero in this mutant.\n\nDetermine the steady-state concentration of the response protein $R$ in this mutant strain when it is subjected to a constant input signal of strength $S_{new}$.

The system's output is the concentration of an active response regulator, $R_p$, which we denote by $y$. The dynamics of this system can be modeled by the following set of interactions:\n\n1.  The active regulator, $R_p$, is produced by a sensor kinase whose activity is directly proportional to the ligand concentration $L$. This production rate is given by $k_1 L$, where $k_1$ is a rate constant.\n2.  A phosphatase, $P$, whose concentration is denoted by $p$, deactivates $R_p$. This deactivation process follows the rate law $k_2 p y$, where $k_2$ is a rate constant.\n3.  The synthesis of the phosphatase $P$ is stimulated by the active regulator $R_p$. The rate of synthesis is $k_3 y$, where $k_3$ is a rate constant.\n4.  The phosphatase $P$ is removed from the system at a constant rate $k_4$, in a process that is independent of any other species (a zero-order removal).\n\nInitially, the system is at a steady state with a constant ligand concentration of $L_0$. Then, a new drug is introduced into the environment. This drug acts as an inhibitor of the sensor kinase, reducing its effective activity by 25%. The system is allowed to reach a new steady state in the presence of the drug, while the external ligand concentration remains at $L_0$.\n\nFinally, after the system has equilibrated with the drug, the external ligand concentration is abruptly increased by a factor of 3, to a new level of $3L_0$.
