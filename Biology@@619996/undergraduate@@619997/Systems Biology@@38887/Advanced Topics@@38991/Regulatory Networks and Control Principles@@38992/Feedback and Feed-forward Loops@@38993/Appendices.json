Initial conditions at $t=0$ are low protein levels.\n\nAnalysis proceeds by timescale separation implied by the problem statement:\n\n1) Early time window $0<t<\\tau$. Because of the delay, $P_{B}(t)\\approx 0$ for $t<\\tau$, hence $f_{\\text{rep}}(P_{B}(t))\\approx 1$.

Since $f_{\\text{act}}(P_{A}(t))$ is increasing in $P_{A}(t)$, the production term for $P_{C}$ is positive and increases with time in this window. Consequently $P_{C}(t)$ increases rapidly toward the instantaneous quasi-steady level\n$$\nP_{C}^{*}(t)=\\frac{\\alpha_{C}}{\\delta_{C}} f_{\\text{act}}(P_{A}(t)),\n$$\nso $P_{C}$ rises from low initial values.\n\n2) Later time window $t\\gtrsim \\tau$.

This change converts the previous net positive right-hand side for $dP_{C}/dt$ into a negative one once $P_{B}$ is sufficiently large, causing $P_{C}(t)$ to decrease.\n\nAt steady state with constant $S_{0}$, the system satisfies\n$$\n\\bar{P}_{A}=\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{\\delta_{A}} f_{\\text{act}}(S_{0}),\\quad\n\\bar{P}_{B}=\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{\\delta_{B}} f_{\\text{act}}(\\bar{P}_{A}),\\quad\n\\bar{P}_{C}=\\frac{\\alpha_{C}}{\\delta_{C}} f_{\\text{act}}(\\bar{P}_{A}) f_{\\text{rep}}(\\bar{P}_{B}).\n$$\nBecause $P_{B}$ is a repressor and is activated by $P_{A}$, for sufficiently strong repression one has $f_{\\text{rep}}(\\bar{P}_{B})\\ll 1$, so $\\bar{P}_{C}$ is low despite the continuous presence of Stimulin.\n\nCombining these phases: immediately after induction, $P_{C}$ rises rapidly due to fast activation by $P_{A}$ and the absence of repression; after a delay, $P_{B}$ accumulates and represses $G_{C}$, reducing $P_{C}$ toward a low steady state. This produces a transient peak (overshoot) followed by a decline to a low steady level under sustained input. Such pulse-like dynamics are characteristic of an incoherent feed-forward motif with a delayed negative arm. Therefore, the correct qualitative description is that $P_{C}$ rapidly increases, reaches a peak, and then decreases back to a low steady-state level despite continuous Stimulin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1433955"}, {"introduction": "Positive feedback loops are central to creating biological switches that can exist in distinct 'ON' and 'OFF' states, a property known as bistability.
