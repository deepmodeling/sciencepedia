This highlights the core principle that network topology dictates biological behavior.", "problem": "In genetic regulatory networks, recurring patterns of interconnections known as network motifs perform specific information-processing tasks. Consider a Type 1 Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (I1-FFL), a common three-gene motif. In this motif, a master transcription factor, X, directly activates the expression of both a second transcription factor, Y, and a target gene, Z. The transcription factor Y, in turn, directly represses the expression of the target gene Z.\n\nImagine a mutational event occurs that completely eliminates the regulatory function of protein Y on gene Z, effectively removing that single interaction from the network. All other interactions remain unchanged.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the new network motif and accurately describes the primary change in the system's response to a sustained presence of input X?\n\nA. The motif becomes a Coherent Feed-Forward Loop (C1-FFL).

The motif becomes a Positive Feedback Loop. Its function changes from pulse generation to creating a bistable switch, where Z can exist in either a stable \"OFF\" or stable \"ON\" state.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the original motif. In a Type 1 Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (I1-FFL), $X$ activates $Y$ and $Z$, and $Y$ represses $Z$. Thus there are two paths from $X$ to $Z$: a direct activating path $X \\to Z$ and an indirect path $X \\to Y \\dashv Z$ that is overall repressive. For a step increase in $X$, the direct activation turns $Z$ on rapidly, while $Y$ accumulates more slowly and then represses $Z$, producing a transient pulse in $Z$ followed by adaptation or suppression under sustained $X$.\n\nThe mutation removes the regulatory function of $Y$ on $Z$, i.e., it deletes the edge $Y \\dashv Z$. All other edges remain: $X \\to Y$ and $X \\to Z$. As a consequence, the network no longer contains a feed-forward triangle because there is no path from $Y$ to $Z$. The resulting topology is one regulator $X$ controlling multiple targets ($Y$ and $Z$) in parallel. This is the defining structure of a Single Input Module (SIM).\n\nFunctionally, without the delayed repression from $Y$, the mechanism that converts a step in $X$ into a pulse in $Z$ is lost. Under sustained input $X$, $Z$ is directly activated by $X$ and remains expressed as long as $X$ is present, i.e., coordinated sustained activation rather than pulse generation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because there is no longer a feed-forward loop, let alone a coherent one; the $Y \\to Z$ edge is absent.\n- B is incorrect because there is no feedback loop; no edge closes a cycle back to an upstream node.\n- C is correct: the motif becomes a Single Input Module and the response changes from pulse generation to sustained activation during the presence of $X$.\n- D is incorrect because the interactions are not unlinked; they are coordinated by the common regulator $X$, which is precisely a SIM.\n- E is incorrect because there is no positive feedback; no edge creates a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1452405"}]}
