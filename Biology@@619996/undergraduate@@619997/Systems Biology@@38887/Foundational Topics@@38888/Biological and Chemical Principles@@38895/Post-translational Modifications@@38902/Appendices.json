Consider a hypothetical regulatory protein, \"Regulin,\" which plays a key role in a cellular signaling pathway. The activity of Regulin is controlled by PTMs at four specific amino acid residues.\n\nThe modifiable sites on Regulin are:\n- Two lysine residues, which we will label K1 and K2.\n- Two serine residues, which we will label S1 and S2.\n\nThe rules for modification at these sites are as follows:\n- Each lysine residue (K1 or K2) can exist in one of three states: unmodified, acetylated, or monomethylated. For a given lysine residue, acetylation and monomethylation are mutually exclusive.\n- Each serine residue (S1 or S2) can exist in one of two states: unmodified or phosphorylated.\n\nA proteoform of Regulin is defined by the specific combination of modification states across all four residues (K1, K2, S1, and S2). Calculate the total number of distinct proteoforms of Regulin that have exactly two modified residues.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of distinct proteoforms of the protein Regulin that have exactly two Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs). The protein has four potential modification sites in total: two lysine residues (K1, K2) and two serine residues (S1, S2).\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible states for each residue type.\nA lysine residue (K) can be unmodified, acetylated, or monomethylated. This means if a lysine residue is selected to be modified, there are 2 possible modification types (acetylation or monomethylation).\nA serine residue (S) can be unmodified or phosphorylated. This means if a serine residue is selected to be modified, there is only 1 possible modification type (phosphorylation).\n\nWe are looking for proteoforms with exactly two modified residues out of the four possible sites. We can solve this by considering all possible combinations of residue types for the two modifications. Let's break the problem down into mutually exclusive cases based on the types of the two modified residues.\n\nCase 1: Both modified residues are lysines.\nIn this case, we must choose 2 lysine residues to be modified from the 2 available lysine residues. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$. The two serine residues must remain unmodified.\nFor each of the two chosen lysine residues, there are 2 possible modifications (acetylation or monomethylation). Since the modifications on K1 and K2 are independent, the total number of modification patterns for the two chosen lysines is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\nThe total number of proteoforms for this case is the number of ways to choose the sites multiplied by the number of ways to modify them:\n$N_1 = \\binom{2}{2} \\times (2 \\times 2) = 1 \\times 4 = 4$.\n\nCase 2: Both modified residues are serines.\nIn this case, we choose 2 serine residues to be modified from the 2 available serine residues. The number of ways is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$. The two lysine residues must remain unmodified.\nFor each of the two chosen serine residues, there is only 1 possible modification (phosphorylation). The total number of modification patterns for the two chosen serines is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nThe total number of proteoforms for this case is:\n$N_2 = \\binom{2}{2} \\times (1 \\times 1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nCase 3: One modified residue is a lysine, and the other is a serine.\nIn this case, we must choose 1 lysine residue to be modified from the 2 available, and 1 serine residue to be modified from the 2 available.\nThe number of ways to choose 1 lysine residue is $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$.\nThe number of ways to choose 1 serine residue is $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$.\nThe total number of ways to choose this pair of sites (one lysine, one serine) is $\\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\nFor the chosen lysine residue, there are 2 possible modifications.\nFor the chosen serine residue, there is 1 possible modification.\nThe total number of proteoforms for this case is the product of the number of ways to choose the sites and the number of ways to modify them:\n$N_3 = \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nTo find the total number of proteoforms with exactly two modifications, we sum the numbers from these three mutually exclusive cases:\n$N_{total} = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 4 + 1 + 8 = 13$.\n\nTherefore, there are 13 distinct proteoforms of Regulin with exactly two modified residues.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13}$$", "id": "1459202"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical complexity to experimental evidence, this practice explores how scientists detect and quantify PTMs in the laboratory.

The first step is proteolytic cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide, and the second is phosphorylation.\n\nUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry, the mass of the inactive Pro-Regulin is measured. The protein is then treated with a specific protease that cleaves off the N-terminal dipeptide, Glycyl-Alanine (Gly-Ala). Following this cleavage, the protein is incubated in a solution containing a specific protein kinase and an excess of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), leading to phosphorylation.

In its basal state, CRF1 is inactive and retained in the cytoplasm. Upon cellular stress, a specific kinase phosphorylates a single, critical serine residue at position 152 (Ser-152) within a regulatory domain of CRF1. This phosphorylation event introduces a strong negative charge, inducing a conformational change that unmasks a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS). The unmasked NLS allows CRF1 to be imported into the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and activates gene transcription.\n\nA research team aims to create a mutant version of CRF1 that is constitutively active, meaning it is always localized in the nucleus and active as a transcription factor, even in the absence of cellular stress and kinase activity. To achieve this, they plan to use site-directed mutagenesis to replace Ser-152 with a different amino acid.\n\nWhich of the following single amino acid substitutions at position 152 would be most likely to produce a constitutively active CRF1 protein?\n\nA. Alanine (Ala)\n\nB. Lysine (Lys)\n\nC. Aspartic acid (Asp)\n\nD. Tyrosine (Tyr)\n\nE. Tryptophan (Trp)", "solution": "The central task is to identify an amino acid substitution that mimics the functional effect of phosphorylation at a serine residue. Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification where a phosphate group ($PO_4^{3-}$) is covalently attached to the hydroxyl group (-OH) of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the effect of phosphorylating Serine-152 on the CRF1 protein. The problem states that phosphorylation at Ser-152 activates the protein. At physiological pH (around 7.4), a phosphate group carries a significant negative charge (approximately -2). This introduction of a bulky, negatively charged moiety into the protein's structure at Ser-152 induces a conformational change. This change, in turn, unmasks the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), leading to nuclear import and activation of the transcription factor.\n\nThe goal is to create a \"phosphomimetic\" mutant. This means we need to replace the original serine with an amino acid whose side chain properties closely resemble those of a *phosphorylated* serine. The most critical property conferred by phosphorylation in this context is the strong negative charge, which drives the conformational change. Therefore, the ideal substitute would be an amino acid that has a negatively charged side chain at physiological pH.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on the properties of their side chains:\n\nA. **Alanine (Ala):** Alanine has a small, nonpolar methyl group (-CH$_3$) as its side chain. Substituting serine with alanine would remove the hydroxyl group necessary for phosphorylation. This would create a protein that can *never* be phosphorylated at that site, locking it in the inactive, cytoplasmic state. This is the opposite of the desired effect.\n\nB. **Lysine (Lys):** Lysine has a long side chain ending in an amino group (-NH$_2$). At physiological pH, this amino group is protonated to form -NH$_3^+$, giving lysine's side chain a positive charge. Introducing a positive charge is the electrostatic opposite of introducing the negative charge of a phosphate group. This substitution would likely disrupt the protein's function or keep it inactive, not mimic activation.\n\nC. **Aspartic acid (Asp):** Aspartic acid has a side chain containing a carboxyl group (-COOH). At physiological pH, this carboxyl group is deprotonated to form a carboxylate ion (-COO$^-$), which carries a negative charge. This negative charge can electrostatically mimic the negative charge of the phosphate group. The size of the aspartic acid side chain is also reasonably similar to that of a serine residue. This makes it an excellent candidate for a phosphomimetic mutation.\n\nD. **Tyrosine (Tyr):** Tyrosine, like serine, has a hydroxyl group and can be a target for phosphorylation. However, simply replacing serine with tyrosine does not create a constitutive \"on\" state. The resulting mutant protein would still require phosphorylation (on the new tyrosine residue) by a potentially different kinase to become active. It does not mimic the *already phosphorylated* state.\n\nE. **Tryptophan (Trp):** Tryptophan has a large, bulky, aromatic side chain that is nonpolar and uncharged. While it introduces significant bulk, it lacks the essential negative charge required to mimic the electrostatic effect of the phosphate group. The absence of the negative charge means it is unlikely to induce the correct conformational change for activation.\n\nComparing the options, Aspartic acid (Asp) is the most suitable choice. Its negatively charged carboxylate side chain is the best mimic for the negatively charged phosphate group among the options provided. This substitution is most likely to induce the required conformational change, unmask the NLS, and lead to a constitutively active CRF1 protein. Glutamic acid (Glu), which is not an option here, is another common choice for phosphomimetics for the same reason (a negatively charged side chain).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2309450"}]}
