The plasmid is a covalently closed-circular Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with a total length of 4200 base pairs (bp). Initially, the plasmid is in a fully relaxed state. In this state, it lies flat (i.e., it has no supercoiling) and adopts the standard B-form DNA structure, which has a helical repeat of 10.5 bp per turn.\n\nAn enzyme, DNA gyrase, is then introduced into the solution containing the plasmid. This enzyme acts on the plasmid, catalyzing a reaction that introduces two negative supercoils into its structure. The linking number, a topological property of the plasmid, is an integer that can only be changed by such enzymatic action involving the breaking and rejoining of the DNA backbone.\n\nCalculate the final linking number of the plasmid after the DNA gyrase has completed its action.", "solution": "The linking number of a covalently closed circular DNA is defined by the topological relation $Lk = Tw + Wr$, where $Tw$ is the twist (number of helical turns of the duplex) and $Wr$ is the writhe (supercoiling).
