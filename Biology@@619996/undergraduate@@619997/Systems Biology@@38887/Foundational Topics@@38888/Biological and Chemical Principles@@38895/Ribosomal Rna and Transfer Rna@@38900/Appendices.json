A crucial initial step is the \"charging\" of a specific type of transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA) with its cognate amino acid. This reaction is catalyzed by a dedicated enzyme known as an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS). The overall reaction consumes the amino acid, the tRNA, and an Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecule to produce the charged tRNA (aminoacyl-tRNA).\n\nThe experiment is set up under conditions where the concentrations of the amino acid and ATP are high enough to be considered saturating and non-limiting.

Assuming all other cellular machinery, including transcription and ribosome assembly, is initially functioning correctly, what would be the most direct and immediate consequence of this mutation on the process of protein synthesis in these cells?\n\nA.

The large and small ribosomal subunits will fail to assemble into a functional ribosome.\n\nD. The process of transcription, the synthesis of mRNA from a DNA template, will be globally inhibited.\n\nE.

The terminal adenosine’s 3' hydroxyl group within this CCA is the conserved attachment site for all amino acids during aminoacylation by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.\n\nStep 1: Loss of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase eliminates addition of the 3' CCA to all precursor tRNAs, leaving mature-length tRNAs without the CCA terminus.\n\nStep 2: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases require the intact 3' CCA, specifically the 3' hydroxyl of the terminal adenosine, to catalyze formation of the ester linkage between the amino acid and the tRNA. Without CCA, synthetases cannot charge tRNAs.\n\nStep 3: Uncharged tRNAs cannot be delivered to the ribosomal A site by elongation factors and cannot participate in initiation or elongation. Thus, translation rapidly stalls due to the absence of aminoacyl-tRNAs, halting protein synthesis.\n\nExclusions:\n- Option B is incorrect because codon recognition occurs via the anticodon loop, which is not directly affected by loss of CCA; the immediate block is inability to charge.\n- Option C is incorrect because ribosomal subunit assembly does not depend on tRNA CCA addition.\n- Option D is incorrect because transcription of mRNA is independent of tRNA CCA addition.\n- Option E is incorrect because translocation is not the primary defect; peptide bond formation cannot proceed without aminoacyl-tRNAs.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is that tRNAs cannot be charged, halting protein synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1463936"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's zoom out from a single reaction to the scale of the entire cell.
