{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey from a gene's DNA sequence to a functional protein is often depicted as a linear path, but in reality, it is a highly regulated and dynamic process. One crucial layer of regulation is RNA editing, where the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule is altered after transcription. This practice explores a common form of editing, Adenosine-to-Inosine conversion, demonstrating how this molecular change can recode the genetic message and produce a different protein than what was directly encoded in the DNA [@problem_id:1469228]. By working through the steps from transcription to translation, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how the proteome's diversity can be expanded post-transcriptionally.", "problem": "In many eukaryotic organisms, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is increased through a process called RNA editing. One common type is Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) editing, where an adenosine (A) nucleotide in a pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecule is enzymatically converted to inosine (I). For the purpose of protein synthesis, the translational machinery (the ribosome) recognizes inosine (I) as if it were a guanosine (G) nucleotide.\n\nConsider a small segment of the template DNA strand for a hypothetical gene:\n`3'-...CGG TAC GTC...-5'`\n\nAssume that a specific A-to-I editing enzyme targets the adenosine in the third codon of the corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence transcribed from this template.

Glutamine to Valine", "solution": "Principles:\n- Transcription produces mRNA antiparallel and complementary to the DNA template, using base-pairing rules: DNA T pairs with mRNA A, DNA A with mRNA U, DNA C with mRNA G, and DNA G with mRNA C. The mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction from the 3' to 5' DNA template.\n- Translation reads mRNA in codons (triplets) from 5' to 3'.\n- In A-to-I RNA editing, an adenosine in mRNA is deaminated to inosine; during translation, inosine is recognized as guanosine, so an edited A is effectively read as G in the codon.\n\nStep-by-step derivation:\n1) Given DNA template segment (3' to 5'): 3'-...CGG TAC GTC...-5'.\n2) Transcribe to mRNA (5' to 3') by complementarity:\n- Template 3'-C G G-5' gives mRNA 5'-G C C-3'.\n- Template 3'-T A C-5' gives mRNA 5'-A U G-3'.\n- Template 3'-G T C-5' gives mRNA 5'-C A G-3'.\nThus, the mRNA segment is 5'-...GCC AUG CAG...-3', partitioned into codons as GCC | AUG | CAG.\n\n3) Identify the third codon in this mRNA segment: CAG.\n\n4) Apply A-to-I editing to the adenosine within the third codon:\n- The codon CAG has an A in the second position.

This process allows a single pre-mRNA transcript to be pieced together in different ways, yielding multiple distinct protein isoforms from one gene. This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario where you must deduce the functional consequence of an alternative splicing event [@problem_id:1469238]. Your task is to connect the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons to the final subcellular destination of the protein, highlighting how RNA processing is a key determinant of a protein's ultimate role within the cell.", "problem": "A hypothetical gene in a eukaryotic cell, named `Regulin`, encodes a key signaling protein. The pre-mRNA transcript of the `Regulin` gene consists of four exons. Through alternative splicing, this single pre-mRNA can produce two distinct mature mRNA molecules, which are then translated into two protein isoforms, Regulin-alpha and Regulin-beta.\n\nThe splicing patterns and resulting protein domains are as follows:\n\n1.  **Regulin-alpha isoform**: The mature mRNA for this isoform is formed by splicing together Exon 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3. The stop codon is located within Exon 3.\n2.  **Regulin-beta isoform**: The mature mRNA for this isoform is formed by splicing together Exon 1, Exon 2, and Exon 4. In this case, Exon 3 is treated as an intron and is removed. The stop codon is located within Exon 4.\n\nFurther analysis of the protein domains reveals the following:\n- Exons 1 and 2, which are common to both isoforms, encode the N-terminal and central domains of the protein. Together, these domains form the primary functional site responsible for binding to a specific class of cell-surface receptors.\n- Exon 3 encodes a C-terminal peptide sequence that is sufficient to keep the protein in the cytoplasm.\n- Exon 4 encodes a C-terminal peptide sequence that contains a well-characterized Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements proposes the most direct and plausible functional difference between the Regulin-alpha and Regulin-beta protein isoforms?\n\nA. The two isoforms are targeted to different subcellular locations, allowing them to regulate distinct cellular pathways.\n\nB. The Regulin-beta isoform lacks enzymatic activity and functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the Regulin-alpha isoform.\n\nC. The primary purpose of this splicing event is to control mRNA stability; the Regulin-alpha transcript is targeted for rapid degradation, thus reducing overall protein output.\n\nD. The Regulin-alpha isoform is secreted from the cell, while the Regulin-beta isoform is imported into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nE. Both isoforms are catalytically identical and located in the cytoplasm, but the alpha isoform has a much lower binding affinity for its target receptors.", "solution": "We are given a single pre-mRNA with four exons that undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms:\n- Regulin-alpha includes Exons 1, 2, and 3; the stop codon lies in Exon 3.\n- Regulin-beta includes Exons 1, 2, and 4; Exon 3 is spliced out; the stop codon lies in Exon 4.\n\nDomain mapping indicates:\n- Exons 1 and 2 are shared and encode the N-terminal and central domains that together form the primary receptor-binding functional site. Therefore, both isoforms retain the same receptor-binding capacity encoded by these exons.\n- Exon 3 encodes a C-terminal peptide sufficient to keep the protein in the cytoplasm (a cytoplasmic retention determinant).\n- Exon 4 encodes a C-terminal peptide containing a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), which is a targeting sequence that mediates active nuclear import via importins and the nuclear pore complex.\n\nApplying the principles of protein targeting:\n- Proteins bearing an NLS are imported into the nucleus; proteins with cytoplasmic retention signals or lacking an NLS typically remain cytosolic.\n- Therefore, Regulin-alpha (with Exon 3) is predicted to be localized to the cytoplasm, while Regulin-beta (with Exon 4 containing an NLS) is predicted to be localized to the nucleus.\n\nBecause both isoforms retain the same receptor-binding site from Exons 1 and 2, there is no direct basis to conclude a loss of catalytic or binding activity in one isoform relative to the other. The most direct and plausible functional difference is subcellular localization, which would allow each isoform to act on different targets or pathways in distinct compartments.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Differential subcellular localization enabling regulation of distinct pathways is directly supported by the presence of a cytoplasmic retention sequence in Exon 3 and an NLS in Exon 4. This matches the mechanistic consequence of the alternative splicing.\n- B: Claims Regulin-beta lacks enzymatic activity and acts as a dominant-negative. There is no evidence that Exons 1 and 2 (shared) lose function in beta; the provided information focuses on localization signals, not catalytic site disruption.\n- C: Claims control of mRNA stability, with alpha targeted for rapid degradation. The stop codons are in the terminal exons of each isoform; there is no indication of a premature termination codon that would trigger nonsense-mediated decay or any stated destabilizing elements specific to alpha.\n- D: Claims alpha is secreted and beta is imported into mitochondria. No signal peptide for secretion or mitochondrial targeting sequence is described. In contrast, beta explicitly has an NLS, indicating nuclear, not mitochondrial, import.\n- E: Claims both are cytoplasmic with differing binding affinities. This contradicts the presence of an NLS in beta and provides no basis for altered binding affinity since Exons 1 and 2, which encode the binding site, are shared.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and plausible difference is differential subcellular localization as in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1469238"}, {"introduction": "The total amount of protein produced from a gene is not solely determined by how often it is transcribed; the lifespan and translational efficiency of its messenger RNA (mRNA) are equally critical. The poly(A) tail, a string of adenosine nucleotides added to the end of an mRNA, plays a key role in both its stability and its recruitment by the ribosome. This problem transitions from qualitative principles to quantitative modeling, asking you to calculate the overall impact of a shortened poly(A) tail on protein production [@problem_id:1469240]. By integrating the effects on mRNA half-life and translation rate, you will develop a quantitative appreciation for how post-transcriptional modifications directly control gene expression output.", "problem": "In a eukaryotic cell, the stability and translational efficiency of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule are critically influenced by the length of its polyadenylated, or poly(A), tail.

This shorter tail has two primary consequences:\n1.  The half-life of the mutant mRNA is only 25% of the half-life of the normal, wild-type mRNA.\n2.  The efficiency of translation initiation is reduced, causing the rate at which ribosomes synthesize the protein from the mutant mRNA to be 80% of the rate from the normal mRNA.\n\nAssuming that the decay of both mRNA species follows first-order kinetics, calculate the ratio of the total number of protein molecules synthesized from a single mutant mRNA molecule over its entire lifespan to the total number of protein molecules synthesized from a single normal mRNA molecule over its lifespan.
