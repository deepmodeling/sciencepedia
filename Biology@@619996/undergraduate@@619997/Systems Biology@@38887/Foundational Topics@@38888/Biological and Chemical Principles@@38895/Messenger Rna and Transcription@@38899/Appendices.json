In synthetic biology, a primary goal is to design and build genetic circuits that execute specific logical functions, much like electronic circuits. This practice challenges you to translate a desired regulatory logic—expression only when an activator is present AND a repressor is absent—into a predictive mathematical model for the production rate $v_Z$ using Hill functions, which are a cornerstone for quantitatively describing transcriptional control [@problem_id:1445085].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a genetic circuit in a bacterium to control the expression of a specific gene, `gene Z`, which codes for a protein product, $Z$. The circuit is designed so that `gene Z` is expressed, leading to the production of its messenger RNA (mRNA), only under a specific condition: when an inducer molecule, $I_A$, is present in the growth medium AND a second molecule, $I_B$, is absent.\n\nThis regulation is achieved through two Transcription Factor (TF) proteins: TF_A and TF_B.\n\n- **TF_A** is an activator. It becomes active in the presence of $I_A$. The concentration of its active form, which we denote as $[A]$, is directly proportional to the concentration of the inducer, $[I_A]$. This relationship is given by $[A] = c_A [I_A]$, where $c_A$ is a positive proportionality constant. The activation of transcription by TF_A follows a Hill function relationship with a half-saturation constant $K_A$ and a Hill coefficient $n_A$.\n\n- **TF_B** is a repressor. It becomes active in the presence of $I_B$. The concentration of its active form, which we denote as $[B]$, is directly proportional to the concentration of the inducer, $[I_B]$. This relationship is given by $[B] = c_B [I_B]$, where $c_B$ is a positive proportionality constant. The repression of transcription by TF_B also follows a Hill function relationship with a half-saturation constant $K_B$ and a Hill coefficient $n_B$.\n\nThe maximum possible production rate of protein $Z$ (achieved under maximum activation and zero repression) is $\\beta$.\n\nThe production of protein $Z$ is intended to occur only when TF_A is active and TF_B is inactive. Based on a standard phenomenological model for combined transcriptional regulation, derive an expression for the steady-state production rate of protein $Z$, $v_Z$. Your final expression should be in terms of the inducer concentrations $[I_A]$ and $[I_B]$, and the system parameters: $\\beta, c_A, c_B, K_A, K_B, n_A, n_B$.", "solution": "We use a standard phenomenological model in which independent transcriptional regulators combine multiplicatively to modulate the maximal production rate.

For an activator with Hill activation, the fractional activation is modeled by the Hill function\n$$\nH_{A}([A])=\\frac{[A]^{n_{A}}}{K_{A}^{n_{A}}+[A]^{n_{A}}},\n$$\nwhich tends to $0$ as $[A]\\to 0$ and to $1$ as $[A]\\to \\infty$.
