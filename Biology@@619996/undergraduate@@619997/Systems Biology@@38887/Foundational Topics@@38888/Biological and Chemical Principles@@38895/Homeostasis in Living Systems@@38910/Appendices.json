By analyzing the mathematical model of this two-gene network [@problem_id:1437926], you will uncover the critical parameters—such as the cooperativity of repression ($n$) and protein synthesis rate ($\\beta$)—that enable the system to achieve bistability, a form of cellular memory.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a genetic toggle switch in a bacterium. This switch consists of two genes, Gene 1 and Gene 2. The protein product of Gene 1 (P1) represses the transcription of Gene 2, and the protein product of Gene 2 (P2) represses the transcription of Gene 1. This mutual repression is intended to create a bistable system, a simple form of cellular memory where the cell maintains either a high P1/low P2 state or a low P1/high P2 state.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentrations of the two proteins, P1 and P2, can be described by a simplified dimensionless model:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_1}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + p_2^n} - p_1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_2}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + p_1^n} - p_2\n$$\nHere, $p_1$ and $p_2$ represent the normalized concentrations of P1 and P2, respectively, and $\\tau$ is dimensionless time. The parameter $\\beta > 0$ is a dimensionless measure of the maximum protein synthesis rate, and the Hill coefficient $n \\ge 1$ quantifies the \"steepness\" or cooperativity of the repression.\n\nThe system is considered a functional toggle switch if it exhibits bistability, meaning there are two distinct stable steady states. Based on a mathematical analysis of these equations, certain conditions must be met by the parameters $\\beta$ and $n$ for bistability to occur.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the requirements for this system to be bistable?\n\nA. Bistability is possible for any Hill coefficient $n \\ge 1$, as long as the synthesis rate $\\beta$ is sufficiently large.\n\nB. Bistability requires strong cooperativity ($n > 1$). For any given $n > 1$, there exists a minimum value of $\\beta$ below which the system is only monostable.\n\nC. Bistability is only possible if the synthesis rate is low ($\\beta < 1$). For any such $\\beta$, there exists a minimum value of $n$ above which the system becomes bistable.\n\nD. The system is always bistable, regardless of the values of $\\beta$ and $n$, due to the mutual repression architecture.\n\nE. Bistability requires non-cooperative repression ($n = 1$). For $n=1$, there exists a range of $\\beta$ values that allows for two stable states.", "solution": "Steady states satisfy $dp_{1}/d\\tau=0$ and $dp_{2}/d\\tau=0$, hence\n$$\np_{1}=\\frac{\\beta}{1+p_{2}^{n}},\\qquad p_{2}=\\frac{\\beta}{1+p_{1}^{n}}.\n$$\nBy symmetry there is always a symmetric steady state $p_{1}=p_{2}=p^{\\ast}$ with\n$$\np^{\\ast}=\\frac{\\beta}{1+(p^{\\ast})^{n}}\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad \\beta=p^{\\ast}+(p^{\\ast})^{n+1}.\n$$\nThe function $g(p)=p+p^{n+1}$ is strictly increasing for $p\\ge 0$, so this symmetric steady state exists and is unique for any $\\beta>0$ and $n\\ge 1$.\n\nTo determine when bistability arises, analyze the stability of the symmetric equilibrium.

For $n=1$ the equation reduces to $-S-1=0$, which has no positive solution, so no bifurcation occurs and the system remains monostable.\n\nFor $n>1$, the critical value of $\\beta$ at which the bifurcation occurs follows from $\\beta=p^{\\ast}+(p^{\\ast})^{n+1}$ with $S=(p^{\\ast})^{n}=1/(n-1)$, i.e., $p^{\\ast}=(n-1)^{-1/n}$:\n$$\n\\beta_{c}=p^{\\ast}+(p^{\\ast})^{n+1}=(n-1)^{-1/n}+(n-1)^{-(n+1)/n}=\\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1+1/n}}.\n$$\nBecause $g(p^{\\ast})=p^{\\ast}+(p^{\\ast})^{n+1}$ is strictly increasing in $p^{\\ast}$, increasing $\\beta$ increases $p^{\\ast}$ and hence increases $S$, so for any fixed $n>1$ one has that for $\\beta<\\beta_{c}$ the symmetric steady state is stable (monostable system), and for $\\beta>\\beta_{c}$ it becomes unstable and two stable asymmetric equilibria appear (bistability).\n\nThus, bistability requires strong cooperativity $n>1$, and for each $n>1$ there is a minimum synthesis rate $\\beta_{c}$ below which the system is only monostable.

They are removed from the surface through two distinct pathways: a basal, stimulus-independent internalization process with a first-order rate constant $k_{basal}$, and a stimulus-dependent internalization process whose rate is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors, $R_{bound}(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{int}$.\n\nThe number of bound receptors is described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics relating it to the total number of surface receptors $R(t)$ and the extracellular stimulus concentration $S$:\n$$R_{bound}(t) = R(t) \\frac{S}{K_D + S}$$\nwhere $K_D$ is the ligand-receptor dissociation constant.
