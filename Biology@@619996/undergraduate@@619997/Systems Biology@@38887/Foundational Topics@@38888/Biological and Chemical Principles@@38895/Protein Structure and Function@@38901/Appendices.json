A researcher plans to perform site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the principles of Ignisase's stability.

A mutation changes this by\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{WT}}.\n$$\nA larger positive $\\Delta \\Delta G$ indicates a more destabilizing mutation. For a residue fully buried in a hydrophobic core, stability is dominated by the hydrophobic effect and optimal packing of nonpolar side chains. Introducing a polar or charged group into the core incurs a large desolvation penalty and unsatisfied hydrogen-bond or charge interactions in a low dielectric environment, whereas maintaining hydrophobicity and packing tends to preserve stability.\n\nElectrostatic desolvation can be rationalized by the Born model for the solvation free energy of an ion of charge $q$ and effective radius $r$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\epsilon$:\n$$\nG_{\\text{solv}} = -\\frac{q^{2}}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}.\n$$\nRemoving a charged group from water (dielectric $\\epsilon_{\\text{water}}$) and burying it in the protein core (dielectric $\\epsilon_{\\text{core}}$) yields a penalty\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}} = \\frac{q^{2}}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{core}}} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{water}}} \\right) > 0,\n$$\nsince typically $\\epsilon_{\\text{core}} \\ll \\epsilon_{\\text{water}}$. This term strongly destabilizes the folded state if a charged residue is buried without a compensating interaction.\n\nEvaluate each option for a buried Val112:\n- Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Ile or Leu: both side chains are hydrophobic and of similar size and shape to Val, maintaining the hydrophobic effect and tight packing. These substitutions generally yield small $\\Delta \\Delta G$.\n- Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Ala: Alanine is hydrophobic but smaller, likely creating a cavity that reduces van der Waals contacts and hydrophobic packing. This is destabilizing, but it lacks the large electrostatic desolvation penalty associated with charged residues.\n- Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Phe: Phenylalanine is hydrophobic and larger; while it may introduce steric strain if the core cannot accommodate the bulk, it preserves hydrophobic character and can sometimes improve packing. Without specific steric constraints stated, its effect is less predictably and generally less severely destabilizing than burying a charge.\n- Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Asp: Aspartic acid introduces a carboxylate group that is typically negatively charged. Burying this charge in the low-dielectric core without compensatory interactions produces a large positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}$ and likely leaves hydrogen-bonding capacity unsatisfied, both significantly increasing $\\Delta \\Delta G$ and thus decreasing thermal stability.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mutation to cause a significant decrease in thermal stability is the introduction of a charged residue into the hydrophobic core: Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Asp.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1460300"}, {"introduction": "An enzyme’s power lies in its ability to both bind a specific substrate and accelerate its chemical transformation. This problem explores this dual function by examining the consequences of mutating a critical catalytic residue, linking a structural change to kinetic outcomes. By interpreting the resulting changes in Michaelis-Menten parameters, you'll learn to distinguish between the factors governing substrate affinity ($K_M$) and those controlling the catalytic turnover rate ($k_{\\text{cat}}$), a fundamental skill in enzymology [@problem_id:1460243].", "problem": "An enzyme, xylo-isomerase, catalyzes the conversion of xylose to xylulose. Its active site contains a critical histidine residue (His-101) which acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from the substrate to facilitate the isomerization reaction. A team of biochemists creates a mutant version of the enzyme by replacing this histidine with an alanine (a mutation denoted as H101A). They then perform kinetic assays on both the wild-type (WT) and the H101A mutant enzyme. The results show that the H101A mutant has a drastically reduced maximal velocity ($V_{max}$) but its Michaelis constant ($K_M$) is almost identical to that of the WT enzyme.\n\nGiven the standard Michaelis-Menten model where $k_{cat}$ is the turnover number and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, which of the following statements provides the most accurate biochemical explanation for these experimental findings?\n\nA. The histidine side chain is essential for the chemical steps of catalysis but plays a minor role in the initial non-covalent binding of the substrate. Replacing it with alanine, which has a non-functional side chain, severely impairs the rate of product formation ($k_{cat}$) but does not significantly alter the enzyme's affinity for its substrate ($K_M$).\n\nB. The mutation to alanine destabilizes the overall protein structure, causing global misfolding. This change in shape reduces the enzyme's catalytic efficiency ($k_{cat}$) but coincidentally preserves the geometry of the substrate binding pocket, leaving $K_M$ unchanged.\n\nC. The primary role of His-101 is to secure the substrate in the correct orientation for the reaction. The smaller alanine side chain cannot hold the substrate as effectively, which slows down the catalytic step ($k_{cat}$) and should also significantly increase $K_M$. The observation that $K_M$ is unchanged is likely an experimental artifact.\n\nD. Alanine binds the substrate xylose with much higher affinity than histidine does. This increased affinity traps the substrate in the active site in a non-productive state, lowering the turnover rate ($k_{cat}$) while also significantly lowering the measured $K_M$.\n\nE. The H101A mutation affects the rate of product release from the active site, not the catalytic step itself. Alanine causes the product, xylulose, to be released much more slowly, which appears as a decrease in the overall turnover number ($k_{cat}$) without affecting substrate binding ($K_M$).", "solution": "We model the enzyme-catalyzed reaction by the standard Michaelis–Menten scheme:\n$$\nE + S \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{cat}} E + P.\n$$\nUnder steady-state assumptions, the measurable kinetic parameters are\n$$\nV_{\\max} = k_{cat}[E]_{t}, \\quad K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_{1}}.\n$$\nThe experimental findings are:\n- The H101A mutant shows a drastically reduced $V_{\\max}$ relative to wild type.\n- The H101A mutant has $K_{M}$ almost identical to wild type.\n\nFrom $V_{\\max} = k_{cat}[E]_{t}$, using the same $[E]_{t}$ in assays, a drastic decrease in $V_{\\max}$ implies a drastic decrease in $k_{cat}$. This identifies the rate constant for the chemical conversion step $ES \\to E + P$ as the parameter most affected by the mutation.\n\nFrom $K_{M} = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})/k_{1}$, an unchanged $K_{M}$ indicates that the ratio $(k_{-1} + k_{cat})/k_{1}$ is nearly the same in wild type and mutant. If the mutation selectively perturbs the chemical step (i.e., $k_{cat}$) while leaving substrate binding and unbinding ($k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$) largely unchanged, then $K_{M}$ will remain nearly constant provided that either:\n- $k_{-1} \\gg k_{cat}$ in both wild type and mutant, so that $K_{M} \\approx k_{-1}/k_{1}$ reflects the equilibrium dissociation constant for $ES$ and is insensitive to changes in $k_{cat}$, or\n- the changes in $k_{cat}$ do not significantly alter $(k_{-1} + k_{cat})/k_{1}$ because $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ (affinity-determining parameters) are essentially unchanged.\n\nGiven that His-101 is described as a general base that abstracts a proton to facilitate isomerization, its primary role is in the chemical catalysis step contributing directly to $k_{cat}$. Replacing histidine with alanine removes the side-chain functionality required for general-base catalysis, thus severely reducing $k_{cat}$ and therefore $V_{\\max}$, while not substantially perturbing the noncovalent interactions that determine $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ and thus $K_{M}$.\n\nBy contrast:\n- A claim that substrate orientation is the primary role (and thus that $K_{M}$ should increase) contradicts the observed unchanged $K_{M}$.\n- A claim of much tighter binding by alanine would predict a markedly lower $K_{M}$, which is not observed.\n- A product-release effect would place the mutation’s impact on a step typically encompassed by $k_{cat}$ but is mechanistically inconsistent with removing a catalytic general base.\n- Global misfolding is an ad hoc explanation and would likely affect binding parameters ($k_{1}$, $k_{-1}$), making an unchanged $K_{M}$ unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biochemical explanation is that His-101 is essential for the chemical steps (affecting $k_{cat}$) but not for substrate binding (leaving $K_{M}$ essentially unchanged), which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1460243"}, {"introduction": "Modern biology increasingly relies on computational tools to analyze the vast amounts of structural data available, and a fundamental task is to identify a protein’s functional sites.
