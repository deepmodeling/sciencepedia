Consider one of the simplest such circuits, a \"constitutive gene expression\" module, implemented in a bacterium. In this module, a specific gene is continuously transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) at a constant rate, denoted by $k$. Simultaneously, the mRNA molecules are actively degraded by enzymes within the cell. This degradation process is modeled as a first-order reaction, meaning the rate of decay is directly proportional to the current concentration of the mRNA, $m(t)$. The proportionality constant for this degradation is $\\gamma$. The net rate of change of the mRNA concentration over time is thus governed by the differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = k - \\gamma m(t)\n$$\n\nAssuming $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants, determine the general solution for the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$.

This practice introduces a classic negative feedback motif, autorepression, where a protein $P$ inhibits its own production. This self-regulation leads to a non-linear differential equation, which is often more challenging to solve for the full time-dependent behavior. Instead of a full solution, this exercise [@problem_id:2045681] introduces the essential technique of steady-state analysis, where we find the equilibrium points of the system by setting the net rate of change to zero. This allows us to understand the long-term behavior of the circuit and how it depends on key parameters like the production rate $k$ and degradation rate $\\gamma$.", "problem": "In a synthetic gene circuit designed within a bacterium, a specific protein acts as a repressor for its own synthesis. This is a common negative feedback motif called autorepression. The concentration of this protein, denoted by $P$, evolves over time according to the following ordinary differential equation, which represents a simplified model of the system's dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\nIn this model, the term $\\frac{k}{1+P}$ describes the rate of protein production, which is repressed as the concentration $P$ increases. The term $-\\gamma P$ represents the first-order degradation and dilution of the protein. The parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants representing the maximum production rate and the degradation/dilution rate constant, respectively.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a stable configuration over time, find the symbolic expression for the physically meaningful (i.e., positive) steady-state concentration of the protein, $P_{ss}$, in terms of the parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$.", "solution": "The steady-state concentration of the protein, $P_{ss}$, is the concentration at which the rate of change of $P$ with respect to time is zero. Therefore, we must set $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$.\n\nStarting with the given differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\n\nAt steady state, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}} - \\gamma P_{ss}\n$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this algebraic equation for $P_{ss}$. We can rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}}\n$$\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by $(1+P_{ss})$ to clear the denominator. This is valid since protein concentration $P_{ss}$ must be non-negative, so $1+P_{ss}$ is strictly positive.\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} (1+P_{ss}) = k\n$$\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation gives:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} + \\gamma P_{ss}^2 = k\n$$\n\nTo solve for $P_{ss}$, we can arrange this into the standard form of a quadratic equation, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where our variable is $x = P_{ss}$:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss}^2 + \\gamma P_{ss} - k = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for $P_{ss}$ using the quadratic formula, $P_{ss} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a = \\gamma$, $b = \\gamma$, and $c = -k$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients into the quadratic formula:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{(\\gamma)^2 - 4(\\gamma)(-k)}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for the steady-state concentration:\n1.  $P_{ss,1} = \\frac{-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}$\n2.  $P_{ss,2} = \\frac{-\\gamma - \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}$\n\nWe must choose the physically meaningful solution.

The denominator $2\\gamma$ is positive. Thus, $P_{ss,2}$ is a negative value, which is not physically possible.\n\nFor the first solution, $P_{ss,1}$, let's analyze the term under the square root. Since $k > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the term $4\\gamma k$ is positive. Therefore, $\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k > \\gamma^2$, and taking the square root gives $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k} > \\sqrt{\\gamma^2} = \\gamma$. This means the numerator, $-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}$, is a positive value.
