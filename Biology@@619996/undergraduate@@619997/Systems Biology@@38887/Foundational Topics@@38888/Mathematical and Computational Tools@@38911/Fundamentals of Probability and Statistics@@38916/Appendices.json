A peptide is a chain of molecules called amino acids. The researcher plans to create peptide trimers, which are peptides consisting of exactly three amino acids linked in a sequence.\n\nThe pool of available building blocks for these trimers includes all 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids, plus an additional set of 6 non-standard amino acids that have been specially synthesized. Any amino acid from this combined pool can be used at any of the three positions in the trimer, and an amino acid can be used more than once in a single trimer. The biological function of a peptide is dependent on its sequence, meaning the order of the amino acids is critical (e.g., the trimer abbreviated Ala-Gly-Cys is distinct from Cys-Gly-Ala).\n\nCalculate the total number of unique peptide trimers that can be synthesized from this available pool of amino acids.", "solution": "We are forming ordered sequences (trimers) of length $3$ from an alphabet of size $26$ (the $20$ standard plus $6$ non-standard amino acids).

The number of mRNA molecules for a gene can vary significantly even among identical cells.

Using a hypothetical model for mRNA counts, you will practice calculating the expected value, $E[n]$, which represents the average number of molecules we would expect to find in a cell.
