This circuit is designed to produce Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under specific environmental conditions. The logic of the circuit is as follows: production of GFP is activated by the presence of an inducer molecule, Chemical X, but this activation is completely inhibited if a second molecule, Chemical Y, is also present. In essence, GFP is produced if and only if Chemical X is present and Chemical Y is absent.\n\nThe engineered bacteria are grown in a bioreactor. The culture contains a constant population of $N = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}$ cells. When the production condition is met, each cell synthesizes GFP at a constant rate of $R_p = 2.0$ arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) per cell per minute. When the condition is not met, GFP production is zero.\n\nAn experiment is conducted for a total duration of 65 minutes, during which the presence of Chemical X and Chemical Y in the culture medium is varied according to the following schedule:\n- From $t=0$ min to $t=15$ min: Chemical X is present, Chemical Y is present.\n- From $t=15$ min to $t=35$ min: Chemical X is present, Chemical Y is absent.\n- From $t=35$ min to $t=50$ min: Chemical X is absent, Chemical Y is absent.\n- From $t=50$ min to $t=65$ min: Chemical X is present, Chemical Y is absent.\n\nAssuming that GFP does not degrade over the course of the experiment, calculate the total accumulated amount of GFP in the entire culture at the end of the 65-minute experiment.

The circuit consists of three genes, which we will call `genA`, `genB`, and `genC`, and their corresponding protein products, `protA`, `protB`, and `protC`. The regulatory interactions are designed such that:\n- `protA` represses the expression of `genB`.\n- `protB` represses the expression of `genC`.\n- `protC` represses the expression of `genA`.\n\nThe team models the dynamics of this circuit using a discrete time-step simulation. The state of the system at any time step $t$ is defined by the concentrations of the three proteins, denoted as $([P_A]_t, [P_B]_t, [P_C]_t)$. The rules for updating the concentrations from time step $t$ to $t+1$ are as follows:\n\n1.  **Repression Check**: At the beginning of each time step, the concentrations from time step $t$ are used to determine which genes are repressed. A gene is considered repressed if the concentration of its specific repressor protein is strictly greater than a threshold value, $K$.\n2.  **Production**: If a gene is **not** repressed, its corresponding protein is produced, increasing its concentration by a fixed amount $p$ during the time step. If a gene **is** repressed, there is no production of its corresponding protein.\n3.  **Degradation**: In every time step, all proteins undergo degradation, causing the concentration of each protein (`protA`, `protB`, and `protC`) to decrease by a fixed amount $d$.\n4.  **Non-negativity**: Protein concentrations cannot be negative. If a calculation for a new concentration results in a negative value, the concentration is set to 0.\n\nThe simulation uses the following parameters, with concentrations given in arbitrary units (AU):\n- Initial concentrations at $t=0$: $([P_A]_0, [P_B]_0, [P_C]_0) = (90, 10, 10)$.\n- Production rate per time step: $p = 20$ AU.\n- Degradation rate per time step: $d = 5$ AU.\n- Repression threshold: $K = 50$ AU.\n\nBased on this model, determine the concentrations of `protA`, `protB`, and `protC` at time step $t=4$.
