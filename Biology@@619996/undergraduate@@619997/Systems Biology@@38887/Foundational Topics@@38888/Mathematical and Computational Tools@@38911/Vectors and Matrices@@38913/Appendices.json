This exercise introduces the concept of representing a drug's effect as a \"response vector\" in a high-dimensional space, and then uses the mathematical tool of linear independence to investigate their relationships. By testing if one drug's response can be described as a combination of others, you can make an evidence-based inference about whether their underlying mechanisms of action are distinct or overlapping [@problem_id:1477152].", "problem": "In a quantitative systems biology study, researchers are investigating the mechanisms of action for three novel drug compounds: Drug A, Drug B, and Drug C. They hypothesize that if the cellular responses to the drugs are linearly independent, the drugs likely operate through distinct biochemical pathways. Conversely, linear dependence suggests that at least one drug's effect can be replicated by a combination of the others, implying overlapping mechanisms.\n\nTo test this, the researchers measure the change in concentration of four specific regulatory proteins (P1, P2, P3, P4) within a cell culture after applying each drug. The results are captured as \"response vectors\" in a 4-dimensional protein concentration space, where each component of the vector represents the change in concentration for one of the proteins. The observed response vectors, denoted $v_A$, $v_B$, and $v_C$, are as follows:\n\n-   For Drug A: $v_A = (1, -2, 0, 3)$\n-   For Drug B: $v_B = (2, -3, 1, 8)$\n-   For Drug C: $v_C = (0, -1, -1, -2)$\n\nBased on the laboratory's working hypothesis, are the mechanisms of action for the three drugs distinct?\n\nA.

To test linear independence, we examine whether the only solution to $a v_{A} + b v_{B} + c v_{C} = 0$ is $a = b = c = 0$. If there exists a nontrivial solution, the vectors are linearly dependent.\n\nLet $v_{A} = (1,-2,0,3)$, $v_{B} = (2,-3,1,8)$, and $v_{C} = (0,-1,-1,-2)$.
