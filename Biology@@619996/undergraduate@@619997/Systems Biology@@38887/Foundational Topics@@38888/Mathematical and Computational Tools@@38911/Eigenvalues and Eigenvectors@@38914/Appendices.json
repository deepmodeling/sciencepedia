This practice focuses on interpreting the dominant eigenvalue, which often dictates the long-term fate of a biological system, such as population growth or decline. You will explore the critical difference in how we interpret this value for discrete-time models (e.g., non-overlapping generations) versus continuous-time models (e.g., microbial growth in a chemostat), a fundamental concept in quantitative biology [@problem_id:1430885].", "problem": "In quantitative biology, the long-term behavior of a population can often be predicted by analyzing the eigenvalues of a matrix that describes the system's dynamics. Consider two distinct biological systems modeled by two different research teams.\n\n**System A:** A team of entomologists models the population dynamics of a species of beetle with non-overlapping generations using a discrete-time model. The population is divided into several life stages (e.g., larva, pupa, adult), and the population vector $\\mathbf{n}_t$ at generation $t$ is related to the population vector at the next generation by the matrix equation $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = L \\mathbf{n}_t$, where $L$ is a constant projection matrix. After collecting field data, the team calculates the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix $L$ to be $\\lambda_A = 1.15$.\n\n**System B:** A team of microbiologists models the interaction of several species in a continuous-flow bioreactor. The population vector $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ at time $t$ evolves according to a system of linear ordinary differential equations, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M \\mathbf{x}$, where $M$ is the constant community matrix describing growth rates and interactions. The dominant eigenvalue of the matrix $M$, which has the largest real part, is found to be $\\lambda_B = 0.15$.\n\nBased on these dominant eigenvalues, which of the following statements correctly describes the long-term fate of the total population in each system?\n\nA. The total population in System A will grow, and the total population in System B will decline.\n\nB. The total population in System A will decline, and the total population in System B will grow.\n\nC. The total population in both System A and System B will grow.\n\nD.

If $\\rho(L)>1$, then $L^{t}$ grows in norm like $\\rho(L)^{t}$ (up to polynomial factors from possible Jordan blocks), so for any initial state with a nonzero component in the direction of the dominant eigenvector, the magnitude of $\\mathbf{n}_{t}$ diverges as $t\\to\\infty$. Given $\\lambda_{A}=1.15$, we have $\\rho(L)=1.15>1$, hence the total population grows asymptotically (indeed, $\\sum_{i} n_{t,i}$ grows proportionally to $\\lambda_{A}^{t}$ under the standard nonnegative and primitive assumptions for $L$).\n\nFor System B, the continuous-time linear model is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}=M\\mathbf{x}.\n$$\nThe solution is\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t)=\\exp(Mt)\\mathbf{x}(0).\n$$\nIf $\\lambda_{i}(M)$ are the eigenvalues of $M$, then the long-term growth or decay is determined by the spectral abscissa\n$$\n\\alpha(M)=\\max_{i}\\Re(\\lambda_{i}(M)).\n$$\nIf $\\alpha(M)>0$, then there exists a component of $\\exp(Mt)\\mathbf{x}(0)$ that grows like $\\exp(\\alpha(M)t)$ (again up to polynomial factors from Jordan blocks), and for generic initial conditions the norm of $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ grows without bound as $t\\to\\infty$.
