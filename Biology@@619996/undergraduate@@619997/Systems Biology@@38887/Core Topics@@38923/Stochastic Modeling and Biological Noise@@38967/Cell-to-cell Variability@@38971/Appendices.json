A simple but powerful model treats the production and degradation of a protein as a stochastic birth-death process. At steady state, the number of protein molecules, $n$, in a single cell can often be described by a Poisson distribution. A key property of a Poisson distribution with a mean value $\\mu$ is that its variance $\\sigma^2$ is equal to its mean, i.e., $\\sigma^2 = \\mu$.\n\nTo quantify and compare the relative variability between different proteins, biologists use the dimensionless Coefficient of Variation (CV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation $\\sigma$ to the mean $\\mu$, or $CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}$.\n\nConsider two different proteins within a cell, both of whose populations at steady state follow a Poisson distribution:\n1.  **Protein A**: A highly abundant housekeeping protein, essential for basic cell structure and metabolism. The average number of molecules of Protein A per cell is $\\langle n_A \\rangle = 10,000$.\n2.  **Protein T**: A rare transcription factor that regulates the expression of a specific set of genes. The average number of molecules of Protein T per cell is $\\langle n_T \\rangle = 16$.\n\nBased on the provided model, which of the following statements correctly compares their coefficients of variation and provides the correct underlying reason for the difference?\n\nA. The coefficient of variation for Protein T is 25 times larger than for Protein A. This is because for a process governed by Poisson statistics, the relative magnitude of random fluctuations is inherently larger for smaller average numbers.\n\nB. The coefficient of variation for Protein A is 625 times larger than for Protein T. This is because the larger number of housekeeping proteins leads to more frequent random degradation events, which dominates the total variability.\n\nC. The coefficients of variation are identical. Since both protein populations are at steady state, the production and degradation processes perfectly balance, resulting in the same relative variability regardless of the mean population size.\n\nD. The coefficient of variation for Protein T is 25 times larger than for Protein A. This is a direct consequence of transcription factors typically being smaller molecules, which diffuse more rapidly throughout the cytoplasm and thus exhibit larger local concentration fluctuations.\n\nE. The coefficients of variation are unpredictable from the given information, as the rates of transcription and translation are required to determine the noise characteristics of each protein.", "solution": "For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$, the variance equals the mean, so $\\sigma^{2}=\\mu$. Therefore the standard deviation is $\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\mu}$ and the coefficient of variation is\n$$\nCV=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu}}{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu}}.\n$$\nFor Protein A and Protein T with means $\\mu_{A}=\\langle n_{A}\\rangle=10000$ and $\\mu_{T}=\\langle n_{T}\\rangle=16$, their CVs satisfy\n$$\n\\frac{CV_{T}}{CV_{A}}=\\frac{1/\\sqrt{\\mu_{T}}}{1/\\sqrt{\\mu_{A}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{A}}{\\mu_{T}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{10000}{16}}=\\sqrt{625}=25.\n$$\nThus, Protein T has a coefficient of variation $25$ times larger than Protein A. The underlying reason is that, for Poisson statistics, the relative fluctuation level scales as $\\mu^{-1/2}$, so smaller average counts exhibit larger relative variability.\n\nOption A states both the correct numerical comparison and the correct reasoning. Options B and C are inconsistent with $CV=1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$, D gives the correct ratio but an incorrect reason unrelated to the Poisson model, and E is incorrect because the Poisson assumption suffices to determine the CVs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1421309"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems have evolved mechanisms to manage gene expression noise, and this practice [@problem_id:1421279] investigates one such strategy: gene dosage.

The cellular machinery and environment (e.g., ribosome concentration, cell volume, protein degradation rates) are identical for both haploid and diploid cells.
