A key challenge is managing the inherent stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. Consider a scenario where we want to control the expression of a protein, P, using transcription factors (TFs).

Thus, $\\eta_P^2 = \\eta_{int}^2 + \\eta_{prop}^2$. The production rate of protein P is linearly proportional to the total concentration of the activating TFs.
