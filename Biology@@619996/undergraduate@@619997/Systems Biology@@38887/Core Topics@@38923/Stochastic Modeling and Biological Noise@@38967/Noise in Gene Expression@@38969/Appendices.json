{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our practical exploration of gene expression noise, we must first understand its different origins. The total variation we observe in a protein's concentration across a population of identical cells is not monolithic; it arises from two fundamentally different categories of randomness. This exercise presents a classic thought experiment that helps dissect these sources, known as intrinsic and extrinsic noise, by comparing gene expression from low- and high-copy-number plasmids [@problem_id:1454589]. Working through this problem will build your intuition for how the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions (intrinsic noise) can be distinguished from fluctuations in the shared cellular environment (extrinsic noise).", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher designs two strains of *E. coli* to study the nature of noise in gene expression. Both strains are grown under identical, constant environmental conditions.\n\n*   **Strain L (Low-copy)**: This strain contains a plasmid that is maintained at a very low copy number, averaging just one copy per cell. This plasmid carries a gene encoding a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n*   **Strain H (High-copy)**: This strain contains a different plasmid, which is maintained at a high copy number, averaging 100 copies per cell. This plasmid carries the exact same gene for GFP, under the control of an identical promoter.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we define two categories of noise contributing to the cell-to-cell variation in GFP levels:\n*   **Intrinsic Noise**: Variation arising from the inherently random, stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (e.g., transcription and translation) occurring at the specific gene of interest.\n*   **Extrinsic Noise**: Variation arising from fluctuations in the abundance or state of other cellular components that are shared across the cell, such as the concentration of RNA polymerases, ribosomes, or energy molecules.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected difference in the *primary source* of noise between the two strains?\n\nA. The total noise will be identical in both strains because extrinsic noise, caused by the identical growth environment, is always the dominant factor.\n\nB. In Strain L, intrinsic noise will be a major contributor. In Strain H, the effects of intrinsic noise are averaged out across the many gene copies, making extrinsic noise the dominant contributor to the overall variation.\n\nC. Strain H will exhibit significantly more noise than Strain L. This is because having 100 copies of the gene leads to 100 independent sources of randomness, which sum up to a larger total fluctuation.\n\nD. In Strain H, intrinsic noise will be the primary contributor because the high rate of transcription from 100 gene copies saturates the shared cellular machinery, causing large fluctuations.\n\nE. In Strain L, extrinsic noise is the dominant factor because with only one gene copy, the cell can tightly regulate its expression, minimizing intrinsic randomness.", "solution": "Let $n$ denote the number of independent gene copies per cell expressing GFP under identical promoter control within a given cell. Let $X$ be the total GFP level in a cell. Define the coefficient of variation squared (noise) as $\\eta^{2}=\\mathrm{Var}(X)/\\mathbb{E}[X]^{2}$.\n\nIntrinsic noise scaling with copy number: Assume $X=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}$, where the $X_{i}$ are i.i.d. random variables representing expression from each gene copy, with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma_{\\text{int}}^{2}$, and intrinsic fluctuations are independent across copies. Then\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X]=n\\mu,\\qquad \\mathrm{Var}(X)=n\\sigma_{\\text{int}}^{2}.\n$$\nHence the intrinsic contribution to noise is\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{int}}^{2}(n)=\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\mathbb{E}[X]^{2}}=\\frac{n\\sigma_{\\text{int}}^{2}}{(n\\mu)^{2}}=\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{int}}^{2}}{\\mu^{2}}=\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\eta_{\\text{int}}^{2}(1).\n$$\nThus intrinsic noise decreases as $1/n$.\n\nExtrinsic noise and its independence of copy number: Model extrinsic fluctuations as a cell-wide random factor $E$ (e.g., reflecting RNA polymerase or ribosome abundance) that is shared by all copies and multiplicatively scales the expression level. Then the conditional mean satisfies $\\mathbb{E}[X\\,|\\,E]=n\\mu E$.

Therefore, the primary source of noise shifts from substantial intrinsic contribution at low copy to predominantly extrinsic at high copy, matching statement B and contradicting A, C, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1454589"}, {"introduction": "Having established the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic noise, we now turn to how cells can regulate the level of noise. This practice explores the crucial role of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, a key parameter that can be tuned to control cell-to-cell variability. By analyzing a quantitative model, you will investigate a fascinating scenario where two different genes are engineered to produce the same average amount of protein but exhibit different levels of noise due to their distinct mRNA lifetimes [@problem_id:1454579]. This exercise demonstrates a fundamental trade-off between transcription, translation, and degradation, revealing how evolution can shape not just the mean expression level, but also its variation.", "problem": "In the study of systems biology, a simple two-stage model is often used to describe the stochastic process of gene expression. In this model, messenger RNA (mRNA) is transcribed from a gene at a rate $k_m$ and degrades with a rate constant $\\gamma_m$. Each mRNA molecule is then translated into protein at a rate $k_p$, and the protein subsequently degrades with a rate constant $\\gamma_p$.\n\nThe inherent randomness in these processes leads to cell-to-cell variability, or \"noise,\" in the number of protein molecules, $P$. A common measure of this noise is the squared coefficient of variation, $CV_P^2 = \\sigma_P^2 / \\langle P \\rangle^2$, where $\\langle P \\rangle$ is the mean number of protein molecules and $\\sigma_P^2$ is the variance. For the model described, at steady state, this noise is given by the formula:\n$$CV_P^2 = \\frac{1}{\\langle P \\rangle} + \\frac{k_p}{(\\gamma_m + \\gamma_p) \\langle P \\rangle}$$\nThe steady-state mean protein level is given by $\\langle P \\rangle = \\frac{k_m k_p}{\\gamma_m \\gamma_p}$.\n\nThe total noise, $CV_P^2$, can be separated into two parts: an unavoidable Poisson term, $1/\\langle P \\rangle$, and an \"excess noise\" term, $\\eta = \\frac{k_p}{(\\gamma_m + \\gamma_p) \\langle P \\rangle}$, which captures the additional variability from the burst-like nature of gene expression.\n\nConsider two different genes, Gene 1 and Gene 2, existing within the same cellular environment.\n-   Both genes produce proteins that have identical structures and functions, and thus the same protein degradation rate, $\\gamma_p$.\n-   The promoters controlling the two genes have the same strength, resulting in the same transcription rate, $k_m$.\n-   However, the resulting mRNA transcripts have different stabilities due to their sequences, leading to different mRNA degradation rates, $\\gamma_{m1}$ and $\\gamma_{m2}$.\n-   Despite the difference in mRNA stability, the cell has evolutionarily adapted to produce the same steady-state average number of protein molecules from both genes, i.e., $\\langle P_1 \\rangle = \\langle P_2 \\rangle$.\n\nYour task is to determine the ratio of the excess noise from Gene 1 to that of Gene 2.
