One of the most common control mechanisms is negative regulation, where a repressor protein binds to DNA to block transcription. This first practice explores this core concept by asking you to compare two genes repressed by the same protein [@problem_id:1449200]. By analyzing how their protein output differs based on the repressor's binding affinity ($K_d$) for each gene's promoter, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how biophysical parameters can be tuned to achieve differential gene expression.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a genetic circuit within a bacterium. The circuit contains two distinct genes, Gene A and Gene B, which produce proteins $P_A$ and $P_B$, respectively. The expression of both genes is negatively regulated by a single repressor protein, whose intracellular concentration, $R$, is externally controlled and maintained at a constant level.\n\nThe production of each protein is modeled as a two-step process: transcription/translation, followed by degradation. The rate of production for each gene is proportional to the probability that its corresponding promoter site is unoccupied by the repressor. For a non-cooperative binding process (Hill coefficient $n=1$), this probability is given by $\\frac{K_d}{K_d + R}$, where $K_d$ is the dissociation constant of the repressor from the promoter.
