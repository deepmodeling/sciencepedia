This first exercise provides a practical application of the thermodynamic model of transcription, a powerful framework for quantifying gene expression based on the binding probabilities of regulatory proteins. By modeling a promoter controlled by both an activator and a repressor that bind to independent sites, you will learn to use statistical weights and the partition function to predict the resulting gene expression level [@problem_id:1475742].", "problem": "In the design of a synthetic genetic circuit, a promoter's activity is controlled by two Transcription Factors (TFs): an activator, $A$, and a repressor, $R$. These TFs bind to distinct, independent operator sites on the DNA. We can model the steady-state gene expression level using statistical mechanics, assuming the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe promoter can exist in one of four states:\n1.  Unbound (P).\n2.  Bound only by the activator (PA).\n3.  Bound only by the repressor (PR).\n4.  Bound by both the activator and the repressor simultaneously (PAR).\n\nTranscription occurs at a basal rate $g_0$ when the promoter is in the unbound state (P) and at an enhanced rate $g_A$ when in the activator-bound state (PA). When the repressor is bound (states PR and PAR), its effect is dominant, and transcription is completely silenced (rate is 0).\n\nThe binding of the TFs is characterized by their dissociation constants, $K_A$ and $K_R$. The binding of $A$ and $R$ are independent events.\n\nFor a specific bacterial culture, the intracellular concentrations of the TFs are measured to be $[A] = 2 K_A$ and $[R] = 3 K_R$. The activator is known to be potent, with $g_A = 50 g_0$.\n\nThe resulting total gene expression level, $G$, can be expressed as a multiple of the basal rate, i.e., $G = \\alpha g_0$.

Express your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the steady-state gene expression level, $G$, as a multiple of the basal rate, $g_0$. We can calculate this using a thermodynamic model of transcription regulation. The average expression level is the sum of the expression rate from each state multiplied by the probability of that state occurring.\n\nFirst, we define the statistical weight of each possible promoter state. Let $[A]$ and $[R]$ be the concentrations of the activator and repressor, and $K_A$ and $K_R$ be their respective dissociation constants.\n- The weight of the unbound state (P) is defined as 1.\n- The weight of the activator-bound state (PA) is $\\frac{[A]}{K_A}$.\n- The weight of the repressor-bound state (PR) is $\\frac{[R]}{K_R}$.\n- Since the binding sites are independent, the weight of the state with both bound (PAR) is the product of the individual weights: $\\frac{[A]}{K_A} \\frac{[R]}{K_R}$.\n\nThe probability of the promoter being in any given state is the statistical weight of that state divided by the partition function, $Z$, which is the sum of all statistical weights.\n$$Z = 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[R]}{K_R}$$\nSince the binding is independent, the partition function can be factored:\n$$Z = \\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{[R]}{K_R}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we write the expression for the average gene expression level, $G$. This is the sum of (rate from state) $\\times$ (probability of state).\n- State P: rate $g_0$, probability $\\frac{1}{Z}$. Contribution to $G$: $g_0 \\frac{1}{Z}$.\n- State PA: rate $g_A$, probability $\\frac{[A]/K_A}{Z}$. Contribution to $G$: $g_A \\frac{[A]/K_A}{Z}$.\n- State PR: rate 0. Contribution to $G$: 0.\n- State PAR: rate 0. Contribution to $G$: 0.\n\nSumming the contributions gives the total expression level:\n$$G = g_0 \\frac{1}{Z} + g_A \\frac{[A]/K_A}{Z} = \\frac{g_0 + g_A \\frac{[A]}{K_A}}{Z}$$\nSubstituting the factored form of $Z$:\n$$G = \\frac{g_0 + g_A \\frac{[A]}{K_A}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{[R]}{K_R}\\right)}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the specific values given in the problem:\n- $[A] = 2 K_A \\implies \\frac{[A]}{K_A} = 2$\n- $[R] = 3 K_R \\implies \\frac{[R]}{K_R} = 3$\n- $g_A = 50 g_0$\n\nLet's first calculate the numerator of the expression for $G$:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = g_0 + g_A \\frac{[A]}{K_A} = g_0 + (50 g_0)(2) = g_0 + 100 g_0 = 101 g_0 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the partition function $Z$:\n$$ Z = \\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{[R]}{K_R}\\right) = (1 + 2)(1 + 3) = (3)(4) = 12 $$\n\nNow we can find the expression level $G$:\n$$ G = \\frac{101 g_0}{12} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $\\alpha$ in the expression $G = \\alpha g_0$. By comparing our result with this form, we can see that:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{101}{12} $$\nThis fraction is already in its simplest form since 101 is a prime number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{101}{12}}$$", "id": "1475742"}, {"introduction": "While some transcription factors work cooperatively, many compete for access to DNA, a critical mechanism for fine-tuning gene activity.

Molecule X is also designed to bind to the promoter, with the intention of it acting as a transcriptional activator.\n\nHowever, a critical design flaw occurs: the binding site for molecule X on the promoter DNA perfectly overlaps with the binding site for RNAP. This physical occlusion means that it is impossible for both molecule X and RNAP to be bound to the promoter simultaneously.\n\nAssume the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium. The rate of transcription is directly proportional to the probability that the promoter is occupied by an RNAP molecule.

Consider a simplified model for such a system involving a hypothetical Biphasic Regulator protein (BiR), which controls the expression of a metabolic enzyme, Metabolase (MetE).\n\nThe promoter region of the MetE gene contains two distinct binding sites for the BiR protein: an activator site (A) and a repressor site (R).
