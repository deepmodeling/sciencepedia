A common model for this relationship is the Hill equation, which describes the fractional response $\\theta$ of a target (e.g., receptor activation) as a function of the ligand (drug) concentration $[L]$:\n$$ \\theta([L]) = \\frac{[L]^{n_H}}{K^{n_H} + [L]^{n_H}} $$\nIn this equation, $K$ is the effective concentration for 50% response ($EC_{50}$), a measure of the drug's potency. The Hill coefficient, $n_H$, is a measure of the steepness of the response curve, which reflects the degree of cooperative binding between the drug and its target.\n\nConsider two therapeutic drugs, Drug A and Drug B, designed to target the same receptor. Both drugs exhibit the same potency, with an identical half-maximal activation constant, $K$. However, they differ in their cooperativity: Drug A has a Hill coefficient of $n_{H,A} = 2$, while Drug B was engineered for a more switch-like behavior and has a Hill coefficient of $n_{H,B} = 4$.\n\nThe 'ultrasensitivity' or switch-like nature of a response can be quantified by the fold-change in concentration required to move the system from a low-activation state to a high-activation state.
