Consider a scenario where a signaling event at time $t=0$ causes a rapid, transient synthesis of cyclin protein, resulting in an initial concentration of free cyclin of $C_0$. After this initial burst, no more cyclin is produced.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are described by the following processes:\n1.  Free cyclin, with concentration $C(t)$, can be cleared from the cell through a basal degradation pathway with a first-order rate constant $k_{deg}$.\n2.  Free cyclin can bind to a constitutively available pool of its partner enzyme, a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK), to form an active complex. Let the concentration of this active complex be $A(t)$. We assume the pool of unbound CDK is large and its concentration remains effectively constant. Thus, the formation of the active complex occurs at a rate proportional to the free cyclin concentration, with an effective first-order rate constant $k_a$.\n3.  The active complex $A(t)$ is inherently unstable. It undergoes a conformational change that leads to the degradation of the cyclin component and the release of the unbound CDK.
