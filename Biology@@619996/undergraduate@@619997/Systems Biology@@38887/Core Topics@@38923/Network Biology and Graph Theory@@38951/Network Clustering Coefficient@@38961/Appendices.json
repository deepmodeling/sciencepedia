A Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network represents proteins as nodes and the physical interactions between them as edges, forming an undirected graph.

Experimental data has shown that SIPA directly interacts with exactly six other proteins: a kinase (K), a phosphatase (P), an adaptor protein (A), a transcription factor (T), a membrane receptor (R), and a scaffold protein (S). These six proteins are the only direct neighbors of SIPA in the network.\n\nFurther investigation into the sub-network formed by these six neighbors of SIPA reveals the following specific interactions among them:\n1.

You will explore the structural implications of a network where every node has a local clustering coefficient of zero, a condition that forbids the formation of any 'triangles'.

A key topological property of such a network is the local clustering coefficient of a node, which measures how tightly connected the neighbors of that node are. For a given node $i$ in an undirected network, its local clustering coefficient, $C_i$, is defined as:\n$$C_i = \\frac{2 E_i}{k_i(k_i - 1)}$$\nHere, $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$ (the number of edges connected to it), and $E_i$ is the actual number of edges that exist between the $k_i$ neighbors of node $i$. By convention, if a node has fewer than two neighbors ($k_i < 2$), its local clustering coefficient is defined to be 0.\n\nConsider a hypothetical, simple, undirected, and connected biological network composed of exactly $N=6$ nodes. The network is designed with a specific constraint: every single node in the network must have a local clustering coefficient of exactly zero. What is the maximum possible number of edges that this network can contain?", "solution": "By definition, for each node $i$ the local clustering coefficient is\n$$\nC_{i}=\\frac{2E_{i}}{k_{i}\\left(k_{i}-1\\right)},\n$$\nwith $C_{i}=0$ by convention if $k_{i}<2$. Requiring $C_{i}=0$ for all nodes implies that for every node with $k_{i}\\geq 2$, its neighbor set induces no edges, i.e., $E_{i}=0$. This is equivalent to the graph being triangle-free: if two neighbors of a node $i$ were connected by an edge, they together with $i$ would form a triangle, yielding $E_{i}\\geq 1$ and thus $C_{i}>0$. Conversely, if the graph has no triangle, then for any node $i$ no two of its neighbors can be adjacent, so $E_{i}=0$ and hence $C_{i}=0$ for all $i$ (including the cases $k_{i}<2$ by convention).\n\nThus the problem reduces to maximizing the number of edges in a simple, undirected, connected, triangle-free graph on $N=6$ vertices. By Mantel’s theorem (the $r=2$ case of Turán’s theorem), among all triangle-free simple graphs on $N$ vertices, the maximum number of edges is\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{N^{2}}{4}\\right\\rfloor,\n$$\nachieved by a complete bipartite graph with parts as equal as possible. For $N=6$,\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{6^{2}}{4}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{36}{4}\\right\\rfloor=9.\n$$\nThis bound is attained by the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$, which is connected and triangle-free. In $K_{3,3}$, the neighbors of any node are all in the opposite part and induce no edges, so $C_{i}=0$ for every node.
