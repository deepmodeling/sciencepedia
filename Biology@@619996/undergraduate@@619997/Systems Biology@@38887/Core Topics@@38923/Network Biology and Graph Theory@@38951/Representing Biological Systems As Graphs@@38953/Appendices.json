This problem challenges you to model a single signaling pathway from two different perspectives: one based on physical protein-protein interactions ($G_{PPI}$) and another on the flow of phosphorylation events ($G_{Phos}$). By comparing the resulting network structures, you will learn how the level of abstraction in your model highlights different aspects of the system's organization and function. [@problem_id:1462976]", "problem": "A hypothetical intracellular signaling pathway is initiated when a ligand binds to a transmembrane Receptor (R). This pathway involves four other proteins: an Adaptor protein (A), two kinases (K1 and K2), and a Transcription Factor (T). The sequence of events is as follows:\n\n1.  Upon ligand binding, the receptor R undergoes dimerization (interacts with another R molecule) and subsequent autophosphorylation.\n2.  The phosphorylated receptor, R, physically binds to the adaptor protein A. This binding event also leads to the phosphorylation of A by R.\n3.  The phosphorylated adaptor protein, A, then physically binds to kinase K1. This interaction induces a conformational change in K1 that activates it, but no phosphorylation of K1 occurs.\n4.  The now-active kinase K1 subsequently phosphorylates kinase K2. This catalytic event requires a transient physical interaction between K1 and K2.\n5.  Finally, the phosphorylated kinase K2 phosphorylates the transcription factor T, which then carries out its function. This also requires a transient physical interaction between K2 and T.\n\nYou are tasked with creating two different graph-based models of this pathway. In both models, the nodes of the graph are the five proteins: {R, A, K1, K2, T}.\n\n**Model 1: Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Graph ($G_{PPI}$)**\nThis model represents the physical interactome. It is an undirected graph where an edge is drawn between two distinct nodes if the corresponding proteins physically interact at any point in the pathway. An edge is drawn from a node to itself (a self-loop) if the protein interacts with itself (e.g., dimerization).\n\n**Model 2: Phosphorylation Cascade Graph ($G_{Phos}$)**\nThis model represents the flow of phosphate groups. It is a directed graph where a directed edge is drawn from a node U to a node V if protein U (or its activated form) is the kinase that directly phosphorylates protein V. Autophosphorylation is represented as a directed self-loop.\n\nA \"network module\" is defined as a connected component of a graph. For the directed graph $G_{Phos}$, a module is defined as a connected component of its underlying undirected graph (i.e., the graph that results from ignoring the direction of all edges).\n\nCalculate the ratio $M_{Phos} / M_{PPI}$, where $M_{Phos}$ is the number of network modules in the phosphorylation graph and $M_{PPI}$ is the number of network modules in the Protein-Protein Interaction graph.", "solution": "We label the vertex set as $V=\\{R,A,K1,K2,T\\}$.\n\nBy definition, $G_{PPI}$ is an undirected graph with an edge between two distinct proteins if they physically interact at any point, and a self-loop if a protein interacts with itself. From the pathway:\n- R dimerizes with R, so there is a self-loop at $R$.\n- R binds A, so there is an undirected edge $\\{R,A\\}$.\n- A binds K1, so there is an undirected edge $\\{A,K1\\}$.\n- K1 transiently interacts with K2 to phosphorylate it, so there is an undirected edge $\\{K1,K2\\}$.\n- K2 transiently interacts with T to phosphorylate it, so there is an undirected edge $\\{K2,T\\}$.\nThus the undirected edges (including a self-loop) form the chain $R-A-K1-K2-T$ with a self-loop at $R$. Therefore, the graph is connected. Hence,\n$$M_{PPI}=1.$$\n\nBy definition, $G_{Phos}$ is a directed graph with a directed edge from kinase to its phosphorylation target; autophosphorylation is a directed self-loop. From the pathway:\n- R autophosphorylates: directed self-loop $(R,R)$.\n- R phosphorylates A: edge $(R,A)$.\n- K1 phosphorylates K2: edge $(K1,K2)$.\n- K2 phosphorylates T: edge $(K2,T)$.\nNo phosphorylation of K1 occurs, so there is no edge into $K1$ from A. The underlying undirected graph of $G_{Phos}$ (ignoring directions) has undirected edges $\\{R,A\\}, \\{K1,K2\\}, \\{K2,T\\}$ (the self-loop at $R$ does not change connectivity). This yields two connected components: $\\{R,A\\}$ and $\\{K1,K2,T\\}$.
