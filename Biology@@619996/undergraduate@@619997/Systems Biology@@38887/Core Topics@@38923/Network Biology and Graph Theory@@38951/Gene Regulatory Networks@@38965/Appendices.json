Consider a simple gene regulatory motif where the expression level of a protein, $P$, is activated by a specific Transcription Factor (TF). The steady-state concentration of protein $P$, denoted as $[P]$, is a function of the concentration of the active form of the TF, denoted as $[TF]$. This relationship is described by the Hill equation:\n\n$$[P] = P_{max} \\frac{[TF]^n}{K^n + [TF]^n}$$\n\nHere, $P_{max}$ is the maximum possible concentration of protein $P$, $K$ is the TF concentration that yields half-maximal protein concentration, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which quantifies the cooperativity of the TF binding.\n\nA key characteristic of such a regulatory system is its \"dynamic range,\" which describes the span of input signal concentrations over which the system transitions from a low-output state to a high-output state. We can quantify this by defining an operational range of the TF concentration as the interval $[[TF]_{10}, [TF]_{90}]$. In this interval, $[TF]_{10}$ is the concentration that produces 10% of the maximum protein concentration ($[P] = 0.10 P_{max}$), and $[TF]_{90}$ is the concentration that produces 90% of the maximum concentration ($[P] = 0.90 P_{max}$).\n\nTo measure the breadth of this operational range, we use the ratio $R = \\frac{[TF]_{90}}{[TF]_{10}}$.

This circuit is designed to implement negative autoregulation, where a protein, which we will call the Repressor (R), inhibits the expression of its own gene. The concentration of the Repressor protein at time $t$ is denoted by $R(t)$. The dynamics of this system are modeled by the following principles:\n\n1.  **Production:** The rate of synthesis of the Repressor protein is described by a repressive Hill function. When the concentration of R is zero, its production rate is at a maximum value of $k_p$. As the concentration $R(t)$ increases, the protein binds to its own promoter region, inhibiting synthesis. This repression is characterized by a constant $K$, defined as the concentration of R that reduces the production rate to one-half of its maximum. The binding process is non-cooperative, corresponding to a Hill coefficient of $n=1$.\n\n2.  **Degradation:** The Repressor protein is continuously removed from the cell. This removal process follows first-order kinetics, characterized by a degradation rate constant $k_d$.\n\nAll parameters $k_p$, $k_d$, and $K$ are positive real constants.
