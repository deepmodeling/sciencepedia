{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding biological networks begins with correctly representing the nature of interactions between components. Some functional relationships are inherently symmetric, meaning the role of each partner in the interaction is reciprocal. This exercise uses the concept of synthetic lethality, a symmetric genetic relationship, to practice identifying when an undirected edge is the most accurate and logical choice in network construction [@problem_id:1429160].", "problem": "A systems biologist is constructing a genetic interaction network for a newly characterized bacterium. In this network, genes are represented as nodes, and functional relationships between them are represented as edges. The biologist performs a series of gene knockout experiments on two non-essential genes, `genX` and `genY`, to understand their relationship. The experimental observations are as follows:\n\n1.  The wild-type bacterium (with both `genX` and `genY` functional) is viable and grows normally.\n2.  A mutant strain with only `genX` deleted is viable.\n3.  A mutant strain with only `genY` deleted is viable.\n4.  A double-mutant strain with both `genX` and `genY` deleted is inviable (lethal).\n\nThis type of relationship, where the combination of two non-lethal mutations results in lethality, is known as a synthetic lethal interaction. The biologist must now decide how to represent this specific relationship between the `genX` and `genY` nodes in the interaction network.\n\nWhich of the following graphical representations is the most accurate and appropriate for this observed synthetic lethal interaction?\n\nA. A directed edge from `genX` to `genY`.\n\nB. A directed edge from `genY` to `genX`.\n\nC. An undirected edge between `genX` and `genY`.\n\nD. A pair of opposing directed edges, one from `genX` to `genY` and another from `genY` to `genX`.\n\nE. No edge between `genX` and `genY`, as the single knockouts are viable.", "solution": "Let the two genes be denoted by $X$ and $Y$, and let a genotype be represented by the set of functional genes. Thus, the wild type is $\\{X,Y\\}$, the single mutants are $\\{X\\}$ and $\\{Y\\}$, and the double mutant is $\\varnothing$. Define a viability function $V$ on these genotypes. The observations imply:\n- $V(\\{X,Y\\})$ is viable.\n- $V(\\{X\\})$ is viable.\n- $V(\\{Y\\})$ is viable.\n- $V(\\varnothing)$ is inviable.\n\nBy definition, a synthetic lethal interaction occurs when both single deletions are viable but the double deletion is lethal. This interaction reflects a genetic interaction that is symmetric in $X$ and $Y$: the joint absence of $X$ and $Y$ causes inviability, and this property does not depend on an ordering or direction between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nIn network semantics, directed edges are used to encode causal or regulatory influence (e.g., $X \\to Y$ implies a directional effect of $X$ on $Y$). The data do not establish such directionality; they only establish a pairwise genetic interaction that is symmetric. A pair of opposing directed edges suggests mutual regulation or feedback, not specifically the combinatorial dependency characteristic of synthetic lethality. Omitting the edge would fail to represent the observed interaction. Therefore, the appropriate representation is a single undirected edge between $X$ and $Y$, typically annotated as synthetic lethal in a genetic interaction network.\n\nHence, the most accurate choice is an undirected edge between the nodes representing $X$ and $Y$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1429160"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to symmetric interactions, many biological processes are defined by a clear direction of influence or causality. This practice explores epistasis, a classic example where one gene's function masks that of another, establishing a distinct hierarchy. Your task is to translate this directional genetic relationship into the appropriate directed graph representation, a fundamental skill for accurately mapping regulatory pathways and information flow in biological systems [@problem_id:1429173].", "problem": "In systems biology, gene interaction networks are often represented as graphs where genes are nodes and their functional relationships are edges. One crucial type of interaction is epistasis, where the phenotypic effect of a mutation at one gene locus is masked or modified by a mutation at another locus.\n\nConsider two genes, Gene X and Gene Y, involved in a metabolic pathway. The normal, unmutated state of these genes is referred to as \"wild-type\".\n- An organism with wild-type versions of both genes exhibits a normal phenotype.\n- A mutation in Gene X alone results in an observable abnormal phenotype, Phenotype Px.\n- A mutation in Gene Y alone results in a different observable abnormal phenotype, Phenotype Py.\n- An organism that has mutations in both Gene X and Gene Y (a double mutant) exhibits only Phenotype Px.

An undirected edge between node X and node Y.\n\nB. A directed edge from node X to node Y.\n\nC. A directed edge from node Y to node X.\n\nD. No edge between node X and node Y, as the interaction is indirect.\n\nE. Two directed edges, one from X to Y and one from Y to X.", "solution": "Identify the genetic relationship: epistasis occurs when the phenotype caused by a mutation in one gene masks or modifies the phenotype caused by a mutation in another gene. The gene whose mutation masks the effect is called epistatic; the gene whose effect is masked is hypostatic.\n\nApply to the given phenotypes: the double mutant exhibits only Phenotype Px (the phenotype of the Gene X mutant). Therefore, the mutation in Gene X masks the effect of the mutation in Gene Y. Hence, Gene X is epistatic to Gene Y, and Gene Y is hypostatic to Gene X.\n\nMap to network representation: to accurately capture the directionality of masking in an epistatic interaction, use a directed edge from the epistatic gene to the hypostatic gene. Thus, draw a directed edge from X to Y.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A (undirected) fails to capture directionality of masking.\n- B (X to Y) correctly encodes X epistatic to Y.\n- C (Y to X) would incorrectly imply Y is epistatic to X.\n- D (no edge) ignores the direct genetic interaction implied by epistasis.\n- E (bidirectional) would suggest mutual masking, which is not supported.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate representation is a directed edge from node X to node Y.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1429173"}, {"introduction": "The decision to use a directed or undirected edge is not merely a notational detail; it can fundamentally alter the predictions of a quantitative model. This advanced practice delves into the Lotka-Volterra competition model to demonstrate how representing an intrinsically asymmetric interaction (where species A affects B differently than B affects A) with a simplified, undirected graph leads to drastically different outcomes. By calculating the population equilibria for both a directed and an undirected model, you will see firsthand why capturing interaction asymmetry is critical for the predictive power of systems biology models [@problem_id:1429176].", "problem": "In systems biology, network graphs are used to model interactions between biological entities. The choice between a directed and an undirected graph has profound implications for the model's predictive power.

The interaction is asymmetric since $\\alpha_{XY} \\neq \\alpha_{YX}$.\n\nTwo different modeling approaches are proposed to represent this system as a graph:\n- **Model A (Directed Graph):** This model faithfully represents the asymmetry. It uses a graph with two nodes, X and Y, and two directed edges. The edge from Y to X has a weight corresponding to $\\alpha_{XY}$, and the edge from X to Y has a weight corresponding to $\\alpha_{YX}$. The dynamics are described by the Lotka-Volterra equations using the given asymmetric $\\alpha_{ij}$ values.\n- **Model B (Undirected Graph):** This model simplifies the interaction to be symmetric. It uses a graph with two nodes, X and Y, and a single undirected edge. This structure necessitates the use of a single, symmetric competition coefficient, $\\alpha_{sym}$, such that the effect of X on Y is assumed to be the same as the effect of Y on X.
