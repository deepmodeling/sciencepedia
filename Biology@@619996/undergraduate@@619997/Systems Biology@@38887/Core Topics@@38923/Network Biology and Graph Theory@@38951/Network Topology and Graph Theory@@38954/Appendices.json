Using the common scenario of a gene co-expression network, we move beyond simple binary links to edges with weights that represent the strength and nature of an interaction, such as a Pearson correlation coefficient.

To model their interactions, a gene co-expression network was constructed where each gene is a node. An edge exists between two nodes if the Pearson correlation coefficient of their expression profiles is statistically significant. The weight of each edge is defined as the value of this Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\nThe following significant correlations were determined from the experimental data:\n- The correlation between G1 and G2 is -0.75.\n- The correlation between G1 and G4 is 0.88.\n- The correlation between G2 and G3 is 0.92.\n- The correlation between G2 and G4 is -0.51.\n- The correlation between G3 and G5 is -0.64.\n- The correlation between G4 and G5 is 0.49.\n\nA key metric for a gene's potential influence in the network is its 'total interaction strength'. This quantity is defined as the weighted degree of the corresponding node, which is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the weights of all edges connected to that node.\n\nBased on the provided data, calculate the total interaction strength for the gene G4. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The objective is to calculate the 'total interaction strength' for the gene G4. The problem defines this quantity as the weighted degree of the node G4, calculated by summing the absolute values of the weights of all edges connected to it.\n\nFirst, we must identify all the edges in the network that are connected to the node G4. Based on the list of correlations provided in the problem statement, we can identify the following connections involving G4:\n1. The connection between G1 and G4.\n2. The connection between G2 and G4.\n3. The connection between G4 and G5.\n\nThe other listed correlations (G1-G2, G2-G3, G3-G5) do not involve G4 and are therefore not relevant for calculating its weighted degree.\n\nNext, we extract the weights for the relevant edges. The weight of an edge is given by the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n- The weight of the edge between G1 and G4 is $w_{1,4} = 0.88$.\n- The weight of the edge between G2 and G4 is $w_{2,4} = -0.51$.\n- The weight of the edge between G4 and G5 is $w_{4,5} = 0.49$.\n\nNow, we apply the definition of total interaction strength. We need to sum the absolute values of these weights. Let $S(\\text{G4})$ be the total interaction strength for gene G4.\n\n$$S(\\text{G4}) = |w_{1,4}| + |w_{2,4}| + |w_{4,5}|$$\n\nSubstitute the numerical values of the weights into this equation:\n\n$$S(\\text{G4}) = |0.88| + |-0.51| + |0.49|$$\n\nCalculate the absolute values:\n\n$$S(\\text{G4}) = 0.88 + 0.51 + 0.49$$\n\nPerform the summation:\n\n$$S(\\text{G4}) = 1.39 + 0.49$$\n$$S(\\text{G4}) = 1.88$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

If any of these steps are energetically driven (for example, coupled to ATP hydrolysis), sustained cycling can lead to net energy consumption without productive output.
