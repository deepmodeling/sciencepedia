These networks can be represented mathematically as directed graphs, where nodes represent genes or signaling molecules, and edges represent regulatory interactions (activation or repression). A common way to encode such a graph is through an adjacency matrix.\n\nConsider a synthetic biological circuit engineered in a cell. This circuit consists of four key components: an external signaling molecule `S`, two genes `A` and `B`, and a reporter gene `R` that produces a fluorescent protein. The interactions within this circuit are as follows:\n1.  The presence of the signaling molecule `S` activates the expression of gene `A`.\n2.  The protein product of gene `A` represses the expression of gene `B`.\n3.  The protein product of gene `B` represses the expression of gene `A`. This forms a \"toggle switch\" between A and B.\n4.  The protein product of gene `B` activates the expression of the reporter gene `R`.\n\nThere are no other direct interactions between these four components, and no component directly regulates itself.\n\nYou are tasked with constructing the adjacency matrix, `M`, for this GRN. The element $M_{ij}$ of the matrix should represent the influence of component `j` (the source) on component `i` (the target). Use the following convention for the values of the matrix elements:\n-   $M_{ij} = 1$ if component `j` activates component `i`.\n-   $M_{ij} = -1$ if component `j` represses component `i`.\n-   $M_{ij} = 0$ if component `j` has no direct regulatory influence on component `i`.\n\nThe rows and columns of the matrix `M` should correspond to the components in the specific order: (`S`, `A`, `B`, `R`). Determine the resulting $4 \\times 4$ adjacency matrix `M`.", "solution": "We label the components in the specified order as indices: $1 \\to S$, $2 \\to A$, $3 \\to B$, $4 \\to R$. By definition, $M_{ij}$ represents the influence of component $j$ (source) on component $i$ (target), with $M_{ij}=1$ for activation, $M_{ij}=-1$ for repression, and $M_{ij}=0$ otherwise.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n1. $S$ activates $A$, so $M_{2,1}=1$.\n2. $A$ represses $B$, so $M_{3,2}=-1$.\n3. $B$ represses $A$, so $M_{2,3}=-1$.\n4. $B$ activates $R$, so $M_{4,3}=1$.\n\nThere are no self-regulatory edges, so $M_{ii}=0$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. There are no other direct interactions, so all unspecified entries are zero.\n\nTherefore, in the ordered basis $(S,A,B,R)$ for both rows (targets) and columns (sources), the adjacency matrix is\n$$\nM=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&0\\\\1&0&-1&0\\\\0&-1&0&0\\\\0&0&1&0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1454315"}, {"introduction": "Once a network is represented as a matrix, the next step is to interpret that mathematical object to draw meaningful biological conclusions. This conceptual exercise [@problem_id:1454283] challenges you to work in reverse: starting from a simple adjacency matrix, you must deduce its implications for protein complex formation. This practice reinforces the fundamental link between the matrix's structure and the physical reality of the biological system it models.", "problem": "In systems biology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are often used to model the complex web of relationships between proteins in a cell. A researcher is investigating a set of five proteins, labeled P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, which are suspected to be involved in a particular cellular process. To understand their potential to form a multi-protein complex, the researcher maps their direct physical binding interactions.\n\nThis network is represented by a graph where each protein is a node, and an edge connects two nodes if and only if the corresponding proteins physically bind to each other. The structure of this network is captured in a 5x5 adjacency matrix $A$, where the entry $A_{ij}$ is 1 if protein Pi binds to protein Pj, and 0 otherwise. For this model, self-interactions are not considered, meaning the diagonal elements $A_{ii}$ are always 0.\n\nAfter conducting experiments, the researcher constructs the adjacency matrix and finds that all of its non-diagonal entries are zero. Based *only* on this information, what is the most accurate conclusion about the ability of these five proteins to form a multi-protein complex among themselves?\n\nA. The five proteins assemble into a single, stable pentameric complex.\n\nB. The proteins are organized in a linear chain, with P1 binding to P2, P2 to P3, P3 to P4, and P4 to P5.\n\nC. Each protein must be functioning in isolation or interacting with other proteins not included in this specific set of five.\n\nD. The experimental results are invalid, as a collection of proteins studied together must exhibit at least one interaction.\n\nE. Each protein binds only to itself, forming five distinct homodimers.", "solution": "Let the protein-protein interaction network be represented by a simple graph with vertex set $V=\\{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\\}$ and adjacency matrix $A\\in\\{0,1\\}^{5\\times 5}$, where $A_{ij}=1$ if and only if $P_{i}$ binds $P_{j}$ and $A_{ii}=0$ (no self-interactions). The experimental result states that all non-diagonal entries are zero, i.e., for all $i\\neq j$, $A_{ij}=0$. Therefore, the edge set is empty: $E=\\emptyset$. For each protein $P_{i}$, the degree is $d(P_{i})=\\sum_{j\\neq i}A_{ij}=0$, so every node is isolated.\n\nA multi-protein complex among these five proteins would require at least one edge (and typically a connected subgraph on at least two vertices). Since $E=\\emptyset$, no pair among $P_{1},\\dots,P_{5}$ binds, and hence they cannot form any multi-protein complex among themselves. This rules out a pentamer (A) and a linear chain (B). The data are not inherently invalid (D), as it is possible for a chosen set of proteins to have no pairwise interactions among themselves. Option (E) contradicts both the stated model (self-interactions not considered, so $A_{ii}=0$) and the observed matrix.\n\nThe only accurate conclusion based solely on the given adjacency matrix is that within this set there are no direct interactions; thus each protein is either functioning independently with respect to this set or interacts with proteins outside this set.
