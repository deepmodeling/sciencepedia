Based on a series of experiments, including Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), the following set of regulatory interactions among key transcription factor genes has been established:\n\n*   The gene GATA6 is a master regulator, controlling the expression of SOX17, FOXA2, NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and HHEX.\n*   The gene FOXA2 regulates the expression of GATA6, HHEX, and CER1.\n*   The gene SOX17 is found to be regulated by both GATA6 and FOXA2. In turn, SOX17 regulates CER1.\n*   The gene HHEX is a downstream target, regulated by both GATA6 and FOXA2.\n*   The pluripotency genes NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 all exert regulatory control over GATA6, a key step in exiting the pluripotent state.\n*   The gene CER1 is regulated by both FOXA2 and SOX17.\n\nThe biologist decides to model this system as an undirected network graph, where the genes are nodes and an edge exists between two genes if a regulatory interaction (in either direction) occurs between them. In network theory, the 'degree' of a node is defined as the total number of edges connected to it. Genes with a high degree are often identified as 'hubs', which can be critical for the stability and function of the network.\n\nIdentify the top three hub genes in this network, ordering them from the highest degree to the lowest.\n\nA.

This practice [@problem_id:1451886] explores the 'centrality-lethality' hypothesis, a key principle linking a protein's network position to its importance for survival. By analyzing a sample dataset, you will practice testing a foundational concept that connects abstract network topology to concrete biological outcomes.", "problem": "In the field of systems biology, the centrality-lethality hypothesis proposes a relationship between a protein's importance in a network and its necessity for an organism's survival. To investigate this, a research team studied the proteome of a newly discovered bacterium, *Exemplar microbium*. They constructed a protein-protein interaction network and determined the 'degree' of each protein, which is the number of other proteins it directly interacts with. They also performed gene knockout experiments to classify each protein as either 'essential' (its absence is lethal to the bacterium) or 'non-essential'.\n\nThe data for a sample of 12 proteins is provided below:\n- **Essential Proteins** and their corresponding degrees: P02 (25), P04 (19), P07 (31), P08 (12), P10 (22)\n- **Non-Essential Proteins** and their corresponding degrees: P01 (3), P03 (8), P05 (5), P06 (2), P09 (4), P11 (6), P12 (15)\n\nBased on a quantitative analysis of this dataset, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA) The data strongly supports the centrality-lethality hypothesis, as the average degree of essential proteins is more than three times the average degree of non-essential proteins.\n\nB) The data weakly supports the centrality-lethality hypothesis, as the average degree of essential proteins is only slightly greater than that of non-essential proteins.\n\nC) The data is inconclusive, as the average degrees for both essential and non-essential proteins are approximately equal.\n\nD) The data contradicts the centrality-lethality hypothesis, as the average degree of non-essential proteins is significantly higher than that of essential proteins.\n\nE) The data is flawed because there is a non-essential protein (P12) with a higher degree than an essential protein (P08), which invalidates the hypothesis.", "solution": "We formalize the problem by defining the two groups and computing their sample means. Let the essential-protein degrees be $E=\\{25,19,31,12,22\\}$ with sample size $n_{E}=5$, and the non-essential-protein degrees be $N=\\{3,8,5,2,4,6,15\\}$ with sample size $n_{N}=7$.\n\nThe sample mean of a set $\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}$ is $\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$.

Therefore, the average degree of essential proteins is more than three times the average degree of non-essential proteins. This supports the centrality-lethality hypothesis strongly for this sample.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is accurate: the computed ratio is greater than $3$, indicating strong support.\n- B is incorrect: the difference is not slight.\n- C is incorrect: the means are not approximately equal.\n- D is incorrect: non-essential proteins do not have a higher mean degree.\n- E is incorrect: a single non-essential protein exceeding a single essential protein does not invalidate a statistical hypothesis; the relevant comparison is between group means (or distributions), not pairwise extremes.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1451886"}, {"introduction": "The concept of a hub can be refined further, as not all hubs function identically; some anchor stable complexes ('party hubs') while others mediate multiple transient interactions ('date hubs'). This problem [@problem_id:1451884] introduces a sophisticated metric, the 'Partisanship Index' ($S_P$), which uses gene co-expression data to classify a hub on this spectrum. Calculating this index provides hands-on experience in how quantitative models are designed to uncover deeper functional insights from biological data.", "problem": "In systems biology, protein-protein interaction networks are often analyzed to understand cellular function. Proteins with a high number of connections, known as hubs, are critical for network stability. Hubs can be broadly classified into two types: 'party' hubs and 'date' hubs. 'Party' hubs interact with most of their partners simultaneously, acting as core components of stable protein complexes. 'Date' hubs, in contrast, interact with different partners at different times or locations, often mediating transient signaling pathways.\n\nA common proxy for simultaneous interaction is the co-expression of genes. The Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, between the expression profiles of a hub gene and a partner gene can be used to infer their functional relationship. High positive correlations suggest simultaneous activity.\n\nTo create a continuous scale from 'date'-like to 'party'-like behavior, a \"Partisanship Index\" ($S_P$) is proposed. This index is designed to be high for 'party' hubs (which exhibit consistent, strong positive co-expression with their partners) and low for 'date' hubs (which show more varied or less positive co-expression).\n\nThe Partisanship Index is defined as:\n$$S_P = f_{+} \\cdot \\langle r \\rangle_{+} \\cdot (1 - \\sigma_{r,+})$$\nwhere:\n- $N$ is the total number of interaction partners for the hub.\n- $N_{+}$ is the number of partners with a positive correlation coefficient ($r > 0$).\n- $f_{+} = N_{+}/N$ is the fraction of partners with positive correlation.\n- $\\langle r \\rangle_{+}$ is the arithmetic mean of the positive correlation coefficients only.\n- $\\sigma_{r,+}$ is the population standard deviation of the positive correlation coefficients only.\n- If $N_{+} = 0$, the index $S_P$ is defined to be $0$.\n- If $N_{+} = 1$, the standard deviation $\\sigma_{r,+}$ is defined to be $0$.\n\nConsider a newly discovered hub protein, \"Kinetex,\" which has 10 interaction partners.
