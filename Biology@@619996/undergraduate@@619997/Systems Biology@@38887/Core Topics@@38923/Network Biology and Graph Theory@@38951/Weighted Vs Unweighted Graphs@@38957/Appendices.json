The pathway is represented as a directed graph where proteins are nodes and interactions (e.g., phosphorylation events) are edges. The biologist considers two different models for this network.\n\n**Model 1: The Unweighted Network**\nIn this model, an edge exists from protein A to protein B if A is known to directly activate B. All edges are treated equally. The \"shortest path\" between two nodes in this network is defined as the path containing the minimum number of edges.\n\n**Model 2: The Weighted Network**\nThis model uses the same nodes and edges as Model 1.
