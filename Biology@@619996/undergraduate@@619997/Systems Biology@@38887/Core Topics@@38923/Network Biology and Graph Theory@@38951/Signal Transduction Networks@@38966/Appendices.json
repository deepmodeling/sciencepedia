The concentrations of the active forms of these proteins are denoted by $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z^*(t)$, respectively.\n\nThe production of both the activator $X$ and the inhibitor $Y$ is directly driven by the external nutrient signal, whose strength is denoted by $S$. The active proteins $X$ and $Y$ are cleared from the cell via first-order degradation processes.
