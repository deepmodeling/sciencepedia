This matrix provides a concise mathematical representation of all the reactions and metabolites within a biological system. By convention, the rows of the matrix correspond to the metabolites and the columns correspond to the reactions. The entries of the matrix, $S_{ij}$, represent the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$. A positive coefficient indicates that the metabolite is produced, while a negative coefficient indicates that it is consumed.\n\nConsider a simplified metabolic model for a hypothetical microorganism. The set of all metabolites considered in this model is: external Glucose (Glc_ext), Glucose (Glc), Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and Trehalose.\n\nThe network consists of the following four reactions:\n\n*   **R1:** Glc_ext $\\rightarrow$ Glc\n*   **R2:** Glc + ATP $\\rightarrow$ G6P + ADP\n*   **R3:** G6P $\\rightarrow$ Glc + Pi\n*   **R4:** 2 Glc $\\rightarrow$ Trehalose\n\nYour task is to determine the dimensions of the stoichiometric matrix $S$ for this network, which are the number of rows (metabolites) $m$ and the number of columns (reactions) $n$. Then, determine the specific row vector of $S$ that corresponds to the metabolite Glucose (Glc).\n\nPresent your final answer as a single row matrix containing the number of rows $m$, the number of columns $n$, and then the elements of the glucose row vector in order, corresponding to reactions R1 through R4.", "solution": "By definition, the stoichiometric matrix $S$ has rows corresponding to metabolites and columns corresponding to reactions, so if there are $m$ metabolites and $n$ reactions, then $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$.\n\nThe model lists the metabolites: Glc\\_ext, Glc, ATP, ADP, G6P, Pi, Trehalose. Therefore, the number of metabolites is $m=7$.\n\nThere are four reactions (R1 through R4), so the number of columns is $n=4$.\n\nWe need the row of $S$ corresponding to metabolite Glc. Using the sign convention (negative for consumption, positive for production), compute the stoichiometric coefficients of Glc in each reaction:\n- R1: Glc\\_ext $\\rightarrow$ Glc, so Glc is produced with coefficient $+1$, hence $S_{\\text{Glc},1}=1$.\n- R2: Glc $+$ ATP $\\rightarrow$ G6P $+$ ADP, so Glc is consumed with coefficient $-1$, hence $S_{\\text{Glc},2}=-1$.\n- R3: G6P $\\rightarrow$ Glc $+$ Pi, so Glc is produced with coefficient $+1$, hence $S_{\\text{Glc},3}=1$.\n- R4: $2$ Glc $\\rightarrow$ Trehalose, so Glc is consumed with coefficient $-2$, hence $S_{\\text{Glc},4}=-2$.\n\nThus, the Glc row vector, ordered by reactions R1 to R4, is $(1,-1,1,-2)$.\n\nCombining $m$, $n$, and the Glc row entries into a single row matrix yields $\\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 4 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 4 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1445738"}, {"introduction": "A metabolic network is not static; its capabilities are directly controlled by an organism's genes.

Consider a simplified metabolic pathway in an engineered bacterium designed for producing a biofuel precursor. A critical reaction, `R_ace`, which converts acetate to acetyl-CoA, is catalyzed by enzymes whose genetic basis is described by the following GPR rule:\n\n`(g0815 AND g0816) OR (g1701)`\n\nHere, `g0815` and `g0816` are two distinct genes that code for subunits of a multi-protein enzyme complex (Enzyme 1), meaning both genes must be present and functional to produce a working Enzyme 1. `g1701` is a separate gene coding for an entirely different, single-protein enzyme (Enzyme 2) that can catalyze the same reaction `R_ace` independently.
