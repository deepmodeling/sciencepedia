The enzyme's reaction kinetics are well-described by the Michaelis-Menten model. The reaction rate, $v$, is given by the equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nwhere $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction rate, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, which reflects the enzyme's affinity for the substrate.\n\nTo quantify the sensitivity of the reaction rate to variations in the enzyme's parameters, systems biologists use the concept of a parameter elasticity coefficient. The elasticity coefficient of a rate $v$ with respect to a parameter $p$, denoted $\\epsilon_{p}^{v}$, is defined as the fractional change in $v$ for an infinitesimal fractional change in $p$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{p}^{v} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{v} $$\nThe particular mutation being studied primarily alters the enzyme's substrate affinity, thereby changing the value of $K_m$, while leaving $V_{max}$ largely unaffected.
