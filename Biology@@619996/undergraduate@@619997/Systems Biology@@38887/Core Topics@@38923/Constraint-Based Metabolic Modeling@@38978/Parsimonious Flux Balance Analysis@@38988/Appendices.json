Its simplified core metabolism can be described by the following set of irreversible reactions, where $S_{ext}$ is the external substrate and A, B, and C are internal metabolites:\n- Reaction 1 ($R_1$): Substrate uptake, $S_{ext} \\xrightarrow{v_1} A$\n- Reaction 2 ($R_2$): Direct conversion, $A \\xrightarrow{v_2} B$\n- Reaction 3 ($R_3$): Alternative pathway start, $A \\xrightarrow{v_3} C$\n- Reaction 4 ($R_4$): Alternative pathway end, $C \\xrightarrow{v_4} B$\n- Reaction 5 ($R_5$): Biomass production, $B \\xrightarrow{v_5} \\text{Biomass}$\n\nThe organism operates at a steady state. The uptake of the substrate $S_{ext}$ is limited, such that the flux $v_1$ cannot exceed $10.0$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$.

While standard FBA can find a flux distribution that maximizes a specific objective, such as biomass production, there can be multiple, alternative flux distributions that achieve this same optimal objective value. Parsimonious Flux Balance Analysis (pFBA) is an extension of FBA that resolves this ambiguity. After finding the maximum objective value, pFBA performs a second optimization: it seeks the specific flux distribution that achieves this maximum objective while minimizing the total sum of all absolute flux values in the network. This \"parsimonious\" solution represents the most efficient use of the metabolic network.\n\nConsider a simplified, hypothetical metabolic network of a microorganism at steady-state. The network consists of the metabolites A, B, X, and Biomass, and is governed by the following reactions, where `v` represents the flux (reaction rate):\n\n1.  Nutrient Uptake (`R_in`): `Nutrient_ext -> A` with flux `v_in`\n2.  Pathway 1a (`R_1`): `A -> B` with flux `v_1`\n3.  Pathway 1b (`R_2`): `B -> X` with flux `v_2`\n4.  Pathway 2 (`R_3`): `A -> X` with flux `v_3`\n5.  Biomass Production (`R_bio`): `X -> Biomass` with flux `v_bio`\n\nAll fluxes are constrained to be non-negative. The cell is cultured in an environment where the nutrient uptake rate, `v_in`, is fixed at `10` arbitrary units. It has been determined that the maximum possible biomass production rate (`v_bio`) for this system is `10` units.\n\nTwo alternative flux distributions, which we will call Flux Profile Alpha and Flux Profile Beta, have been found. Both are valid steady-state solutions and both achieve the maximal biomass production rate of `10` units. The profiles are as follows:\n\n-   **Flux Profile Alpha:** `v_in = 10`, `v_1 = 8`, `v_2 = 8`, `v_3 = 2`, `v_bio = 10`\n-   **Flux Profile Beta:** `v_in = 10`, `v_1 = 1`, `v_2 = 1`, `v_3 = 9`, `v_bio = 10`\n\nBased on the principle of minimizing the total sum of absolute flux values, which of the following statements correctly identifies the pFBA solution?\n\nA. Flux Profile Alpha is the pFBA solution because its total sum of fluxes is lower.\n\nB. Flux Profile Beta is the pFBA solution because its total sum of fluxes is lower.\n\nC.
