FBA predicts the optimal steady-state reaction rates (fluxes) within the cell's metabolic network by maximizing a given biological objective. For this study, the objective is to maximize the flux through a special \"biomass reaction,\" which represents the production of all necessary cellular components for growth.\n\nThe student simulates the bacterium's growth in a defined minimal medium. The problem statement for the FBA is to maximize the biomass reaction flux subject to stoichiometric mass-balance constraints and reaction flux bounds. The model for *L. computerensis* reveals that it cannot produce the amino acid leucine *de novo* (from simpler precursors). Leucine is, however, a required component in the biomass reaction. Therefore, the bacterium must import leucine from its environment via a specific uptake reaction.\n\nIn one simulation, the student mistakenly configures the growth medium parameters. This error results in setting the upper bound for the leucine uptake reaction flux to exactly zero, while all other parameters remain at their standard values. What is the qualitative outcome for the value of the biomass objective function when the FBA simulation is run with this incorrect constraint?\n\nA. The predicted biomass production rate will decrease to a small, non-zero positive value.\n\nB. The predicted biomass production rate will be exactly zero.\n\nC.

Choosing $c$ so that $c_{bio}=1$ and all other entries are zero gives the objective $v_{bio}$, the biomass production rate.\n\nLet the intracellular leucine metabolite be denoted by $\\text{Leu}$. The biomass reaction consumes leucine with stoichiometric coefficient $-\\alpha$ where $\\alpha>0$, so in the leucine row of $S$ we have $S_{\\text{Leu},\\,\\text{bio}}=-\\alpha$. The organism cannot produce leucine de novo, so there are no internal reactions with $S_{\\text{Leu},\\,j}>0$ that are able to carry flux in steady state to produce leucine. The only source of leucine is the uptake reaction, denoted $\\text{upt}$, which contributes positively to the intracellular leucine balance, so $S_{\\text{Leu},\\,\\text{upt}}=1$.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance for leucine is therefore\n$$\nS_{\\text{Leu},\\,\\text{upt}}\\,v_{\\text{upt}} + S_{\\text{Leu},\\,\\text{bio}}\\,v_{\\text{bio}} + \\sum_{k\\in C} S_{\\text{Leu},\\,k}\\,v_{k} = 0,\n$$\nwhere the sum is over reactions that consume leucine (each term has $S_{\\text{Leu},\\,k}\\le 0$).
