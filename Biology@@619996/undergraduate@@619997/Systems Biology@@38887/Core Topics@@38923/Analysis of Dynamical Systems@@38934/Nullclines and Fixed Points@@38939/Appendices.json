The state of the cell is described by two variables: the concentration of an essential internal nutrient, $N(t)$, and the concentration of a specific transporter protein, $T(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the following interactions:\n1.  The transporter protein $T$ is synthesized at a constant rate $k_s$. It is also diluted due to cell growth. The cell's specific growth rate, $\\mu$, is found to be directly proportional to the internal nutrient concentration $N$, such that $\\mu = \\gamma N$, where $\\gamma$ is a positive constant.\n2.  The internal nutrient $N$ is actively imported into the cell by the transporter proteins. The rate of this import is proportional to the concentration of transporters, given by $k_{cat} T$, where $k_{cat}$ is a positive rate constant. The nutrient is simultaneously consumed by various cellular processes at a rate proportional to its own concentration, given by $k_{cons} N$, where $k_{cons}$ is a positive consumption rate constant.\n\nAll parameters $k_s, \\gamma, k_{cat}, k_{cons}$ are positive real constants.\n\nBased on these interactions, the system can be described by the following pair of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = k_s - \\gamma N T $$\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = k_{cat} T - k_{cons} N $$\n\nDetermine the symbolic expressions for the concentrations $N^*$ and $T^*$ at the non-trivial fixed point of this system, which is defined as the steady state where both concentrations are positive ($N^* > 0, T^* > 0$).
