This exercise explores the distinction between these behaviors—a stable node versus a stable spiral—by analyzing a fundamental linear signaling cascade. By determining the critical parameter value that separates these two regimes, you will gain insight into how a system's internal wiring dictates its dynamic response to signals [@problem_id:1458264].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a two-component signaling system within a cell, consisting of proteins X and Y. The concentration of the active form of protein X, denoted by $x(t)$, is increased by a constant upstream signal and is subject to both degradation and inhibition by the active form of protein Y, denoted by $y(t)$. The active form of protein Y is produced at a rate proportional to the concentration of active protein X and also undergoes degradation.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentrations are described by the following system of linear ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha - \\delta_x x - \\gamma_y y $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\beta x - \\delta_y y $$\nHere, $\\alpha$, $\\delta_x$, $\\gamma_y$, $\\beta$, and $\\delta_y$ are all positive real constants representing various rate parameters.
