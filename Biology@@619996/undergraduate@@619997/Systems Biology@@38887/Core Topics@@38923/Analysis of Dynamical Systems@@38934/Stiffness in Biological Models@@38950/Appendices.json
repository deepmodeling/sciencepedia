Consider a simplified scenario involving two competing bacterial species, Species A and Species B, whose populations are being modeled.

For the much slower-growing Species B, the doubling time is $T_B = 3$ hours.\n\nTo provide a preliminary measure of the system's stiffness, we can define a dimensionless \"Stiffness Index\" as the ratio of the larger intrinsic growth rate to the smaller one.

This collapse occurs with a first-order rate constant `k_f`. The trapped intermediate `I` is non-functional and can undergo one of two fates. It can be rescued into its final, functional native state `N` by an ATP-dependent chaperone protein (where ATP stands for Adenosine Triphosphate). This rescue process is slow and is modeled as a first-order reaction with rate constant `k_r`. Alternatively, the intermediate `I` can be targeted for destruction by the cellular degradation machinery, also a first-order process with rate constant `k_d`. The native state `N` is stable and does not revert or degrade.\n\nThe reaction scheme is as follows:\n1.  `U -> I` (fast collapse, rate constant `k_f`)\n2.  `I -> N` (slow rescue, rate constant `k_r`)\n3.  `I -> D` (degradation, rate constant `k_d`, where `D` is the degraded state)\n\nAssume that at time `t=0`, a population of newly synthesized polypeptides exists, such that the initial concentration of unfolded protein is `U_0`, and the initial concentrations of `I`, `N`, and `D` are all zero. The rate constants satisfy the condition `k_f \\gg k_r` and `k_f \\gg k_d`, reflecting the rapid collapse into the intermediate state compared to the subsequent slower processes.\n\nBased on this model, determine the long-term theoretical yield of the functional native protein.
