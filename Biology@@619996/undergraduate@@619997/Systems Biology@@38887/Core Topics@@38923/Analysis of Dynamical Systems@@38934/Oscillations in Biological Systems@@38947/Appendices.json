In this model, an activator protein, with concentration $x(t)$, promotes its own production in a process that is suppressed by an inhibitor protein with concentration $y(t)$. The activator also promotes the production of the inhibitor, which is then degraded. This forms a negative feedback loop built upon a positive, auto-catalytic feedback.\n\nThe dynamics of this system are governed by the following pair of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= \\frac{k_a x^{n}}{y} - d_x x \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} &= k_p x^{m} - d_y y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHere, $k_a$ is the activator synthesis rate constant, $k_p$ is the inhibitor synthesis rate constant, $d_x$ is the activator degradation rate, and $d_y$ is the inhibitor degradation rate. The exponents $n$ and $m$ are positive integer Hill coefficients representing the cooperativity of the underlying molecular interactions. Assume that the system operates in a parameter regime where a non-trivial steady state (i.e., where $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$) exists. Further, for oscillations to be possible in such a system, the parameters must satisfy $n > 1$ and $m > n-1$.\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions, the parameters are such that the system resides in a stable steady state, maintaining homeostasis. However, a specific mutation is known to reduce the degradation rate $d_y$ of the inhibitor. If $d_y$ drops below a certain critical value, the steady state loses its stability, and the system begins to exhibit sustained oscillations, leading to a pathological periodic behavior.\n\nYour task is to determine the analytical expression for this critical degradation rate, $d_y^{\\text{crit}}$, at which the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, marking the transition from a stable steady state to an oscillatory regime.
