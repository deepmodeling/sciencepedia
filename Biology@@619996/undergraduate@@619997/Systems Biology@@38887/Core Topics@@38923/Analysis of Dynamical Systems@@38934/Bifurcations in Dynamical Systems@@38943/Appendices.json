The population is subjected to a constant harvesting effort, which removes fish at a constant rate $h$. The model's long-term behavior is analyzed using a one-parameter bifurcation diagram, which plots the equilibrium population size, $N^*$, as a function of the harvesting rate, $h$.\n\nThe bifurcation diagram has the following characteristics:\n- The horizontal axis represents the harvesting rate, $h$.\n- The vertical axis represents the equilibrium population size, $N^*$.\n- For $h=0$, two equilibrium points exist: a stable one at $N^* = K$ and an unstable one at $N^* = 0$.\n- As $h$ is increased from zero, the curve of non-trivial equilibria forms a smooth arc. This arc is composed of two branches that meet at a single point.\n- The upper branch starts at $(h=0, N^*=K)$ and consists entirely of stable equilibria.\n- The lower branch starts at $(h=0, N^*=0)$ and consists entirely of unstable equilibria.\n- The upper and lower branches curve towards each other and meet at a critical point $(h_{crit}, N^*_{crit})$. At this point, the tangent to the curve is vertical.\n- For any harvesting rate $h > h_{crit}$, no non-zero equilibrium population exists, and the population inevitably collapses to extinction ($N^* = 0$).\n\nThe goal of the fishery is to achieve the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), which is defined as the largest harvesting rate $h$ that can be maintained indefinitely without depleting the fish population.
