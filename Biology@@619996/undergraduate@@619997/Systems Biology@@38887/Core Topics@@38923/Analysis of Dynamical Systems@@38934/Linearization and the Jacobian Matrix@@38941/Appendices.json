The concentration of this protein, $P(t)$, changes over time. Its dynamics can be described by a model that accounts for autocatalytic production, resource limitation, and protein removal. The rate of change of the protein concentration is given by the equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right) - \\delta P $$\nHere, $P$ is the protein concentration, $r$ is the intrinsic production rate constant, $K$ is the carrying capacity of the bioreactor related to nutrient and space limits, and $\\delta$ is an effective removal rate constant that combines protein degradation and outflow from the reactor. For this model to be physically meaningful with a persistent protein production, the parameters are positive constants satisfying $r > \\delta$.\n\nTo assess the stability of the production system, we analyze its behavior near a steady state. This involves linearizing the system, which for this one-dimensional case, means calculating the derivative of the rate function with respect to the concentration $P$.
