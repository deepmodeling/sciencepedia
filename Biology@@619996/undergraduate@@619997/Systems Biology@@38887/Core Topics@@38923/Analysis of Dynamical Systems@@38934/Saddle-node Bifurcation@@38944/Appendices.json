Consider a simple synthetic circuit designed to act as a switch. The concentration, $y$, of a specific protein produced by this circuit evolves over time according to the following differential equation, which models its self-activation and degradation:\n\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\mu - 3y + 2y^2 $$\n\nHere, $y$ represents the dimensionless concentration of the protein. The term $2y^2$ models the protein's cooperative auto-activation, while the term $-3y$ represents its linear degradation. The parameter $\\mu$ is a dimensionless control parameter, proportional to the concentration of an external inducer molecule that can be adjusted to turn the switch on or off.\n\nThe system exhibits switch-like behavior, meaning that below a certain critical value of the inducer concentration $\\mu$, the circuit is \"off\" (has no stable steady-state protein concentration), while above this value, it can be \"on\" (has a stable steady-state protein concentration). This transition point, where the number of possible steady states for the system changes, is of great practical importance for controlling the circuit.\n\nDetermine the exact critical value of the control parameter $\\mu$ at which this transition occurs.", "solution": "Steady states of the autonomous system are the constant solutions $y^{\\ast}$ that satisfy $\\frac{dy}{dt}=0$.

A saddle-node bifurcation typically creates a pair of steady states, one stable and one unstable, and this problem challenges you to think critically about the role of the unstable state in population dynamics [@problem_id:1464691]. By analyzing the system's behavior, you will discover that this unstable equilibrium is not a mere mathematical curiosity but represents a vital \"tipping point\" that can separate population recovery from collapse.", "problem": "In the study of population dynamics, a simple model can be used to describe a system that undergoes a sudden catastrophic shift. Consider a population of a certain species whose size, $N$, changes over time $t$ according to the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = h + rN - N^{2} $$\nHere, $N$ represents the population density, which must be non-negative. The parameter $r > 0$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the population, while the $-N^{2}$ term represents mortality due to intra-species competition. The parameter $h$ represents a constant rate of immigration into the population from an external source.\n\nFor certain values of the parameters $h$ and $r$, this system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation. Specifically, as the immigration rate $h$ is increased from a large negative value (representing a high emigration or death rate not related to population density), the system transitions from having no viable population (no steady states) to having two distinct non-negative steady states. One of these steady states is stable, representing a viable, self-sustaining population level. The other steady state is unstable.\n\nWhich of the following provides the most accurate biological interpretation of this unstable steady state?\n\nA. It represents the maximum possible population size, or carrying capacity, beyond which the population experiences a rapid decline.\n\nB. It represents a critical threshold or \"tipping point\" population size. If the population falls below this value, it will inevitably decline to extinction, but if it is above this value, it will grow towards the stable, viable population level.\n\nC. It represents the population size at which the population's per capita growth rate is at its maximum.\n\nD. It represents an average population size around which the actual population level will oscillate indefinitely due to seasonal changes.\n\nE. It represents the population size at which the birth rate exactly equals the death rate from competition, independent of immigration.", "solution": "We analyze equilibria and their stability for the autonomous one-dimensional model\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = f(N) = h + rN - N^{2}, \\quad r>0, \\quad N \\ge 0.\n$$\nSteady states satisfy $f(N^{*})=0$, i.e.\n$$\nh + rN^{*} - (N^{*})^{2} = 0 \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; (N^{*})^{2} - rN^{*} - h = 0.\n$$\nSolving the quadratic gives two real equilibria when the discriminant is positive:\n$$\n\\Delta = r^{2} + 4h > 0 \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; h > -\\frac{r^{2}}{4}, \\quad N_{\\pm} = \\frac{r \\pm \\sqrt{r^{2} + 4h}}{2}.\n$$\nFor $-r^{2}/4 < h \\le 0$, both $N_{-}$ and $N_{+}$ are non-negative.

Therefore:\n- If $N(0) < N_{-}$, then $dN/dt<0$ and $N(t)$ declines toward extinction.\n- If $N(0) > N_{-}$ but below $N_{+}$, then $dN/dt>0$ and $N(t)$ grows toward the stable equilibrium $N_{+}$.\n\nThus the unstable equilibrium $N_{-}$ acts as a critical threshold or tipping point: crossing it determines whether the population goes extinct or recovers to the viable stable state. In a one-dimensional autonomous system, there are no sustained oscillations, so the interpretation in terms of oscillations is invalid. The carrying capacity in this context corresponds to the stable upper equilibrium $N_{+}$, not the unstable one. The per capita growth rate $(h + rN - N^{2})/N$ is not maximized at the unstable equilibrium in general. At equilibrium $h + rN - N^{2}=0$, immigration $h$ explicitly enters, so it is not independent of immigration.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biological interpretation of the unstable steady state is as a tipping point threshold separating extinction from recovery to the stable population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1464691"}, {"introduction": "Systems approaching a critical transition often exhibit universal warning signals, and this practice explores one such key indicator: an extreme sensitivity to parameter changes [@problem_id:1464665].
