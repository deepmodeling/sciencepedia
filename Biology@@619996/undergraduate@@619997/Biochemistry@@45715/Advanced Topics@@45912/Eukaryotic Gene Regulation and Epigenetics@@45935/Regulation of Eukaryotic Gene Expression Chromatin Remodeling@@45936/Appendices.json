Their initial studies reveal that Lysinostat acts as a potent and highly specific inhibitor of all known cellular Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs). The researchers are planning to treat a culture of human cells with an effective concentration of Lysinostat and wish to predict the primary, direct consequence on the chromatin state.\n\nAssuming the activity of other chromatin-modifying enzymes like Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) remains constant, what is the expected net effect on the electrostatic charge of the N-terminal histone tails and the resulting accessibility of the associated DNA?\n\nA. The net charge on the histone tails will become more positive, leading to decreased DNA accessibility.\n\nB. The net charge on the histone tails will become more positive, leading to increased DNA accessibility.\n\nC. The net charge on the histone tails will become more negative, leading to decreased DNA accessibility.\n\nD. The net charge on the histone tails will become more negative, leading to increased DNA accessibility.\n\nE. The net charge on the histone tails will remain unchanged, but DNA accessibility will decrease due to direct binding of Lysinostat to DNA.", "solution": "HATs catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl–CoA to the side-chain amino group of lysine residues on histone N-terminal tails. This converts a positively charged lysine side chain (approximated as $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}$ at physiological pH) into a neutral amide (acetyl-lysine, $\\mathrm{NHCOCH}_{3}$), thereby reducing the net positive charge on histone tails. Reduced positive charge weakens electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone, increasing chromatin accessibility.\n\nLysinostat is specified to be a potent, specific inhibitor of all cellular HATs. With HAT activity inhibited and HDAC activity unchanged, the balance of modification shifts toward deacetylation: existing acetyl groups are removed by HDACs while new acetyl groups are not added. Consequently, histone lysines become deacetylated, restoring $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}$ groups and increasing the net positive charge on the histone tails.\n\nBy Coulombic principles, increasing the positive charge on histone tails strengthens attraction to the negatively charged DNA, tightening nucleosome–DNA interactions and decreasing DNA accessibility. Therefore, the net effect is an increase in positive charge and a decrease in DNA accessibility.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2069934"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple physical changes, histone modifications create a complex signaling language—the \"histone code\"—that is read by other cellular proteins. This exercise places you in the role of a molecular biologist deciphering this code through a classic domain-swapping experiment. You will interpret the results to determine if a specific protein domain is both necessary and sufficient for recognizing a histone mark, honing your skills in experimental design and logical reasoning [@problem_id:2069933].", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating how a novel chromatin-associated protein, named Transcription Factor Activator 1 (TFA1), is recruited to active gene promoters. Sequence analysis of TFA1 reveals the presence of a conserved Plant Homeodomain (PHD) finger. Prior studies have established that TFA1 localizes to genomic regions marked by trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), a hallmark of active promoters.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the PHD finger of TFA1 is directly responsible for its recruitment to H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes, the researchers design a domain-swapping experiment. They use another protein, Heterochromatin Protein Z (HPZ), which is known to bind to a different histone modification (H3K9me3) via its own distinct chromodomain and does not normally associate with H3K4me3.\n\nThey generate the following three protein constructs, each with a unique tag for antibody recognition, and express them in cultured human cells:\n1.  **WT-TFA1**: The full-length, wild-type TFA1 protein.\n2.  **TFA1-$\\Delta$PHD**: A mutant version of TFA1 from which the coding sequence for the PHD finger has been deleted.\n3.  **HPZ-PHD$_{\\text{TFA1}}$**: A chimeric protein consisting of the full-length HPZ protein, but its native chromodomain has been replaced with the PHD finger from TFA1.\n\nThe researchers then perform Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using antibodies specific to the tag on each construct. The amount of precipitated DNA corresponding to H3K4me3-marked promoter regions is quantified. The hypothetical results are summarized below:\n\n*   **WT-TFA1**: Strong enrichment of DNA from H3K4me3-marked promoters.\n*   **TFA1-$\\Delta$PHD**: No significant enrichment of DNA from H3K4me3-marked promoters compared to a negative control.\n*   **HPZ-PHD$_{\\text{TFA1}}$**: Strong enrichment of DNA from H3K4me3-marked promoters.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions about the role of the TFA1 PHD finger is the most accurate?\n\nA. The PHD finger is necessary for H3K4me3 binding, but it is not sufficient.\n\nB. The PHD finger is sufficient for H3K4me3 binding, but it is not necessary.\n\nC. The PHD finger is both necessary and sufficient for H3K4me3 binding.\n\nD. The PHD finger is neither necessary nor sufficient for H3K4me3 binding.\n\nE. The PHD finger is part of a larger binding module, and other domains in TFA1 are also required for recruitment to H3K4me3 sites.", "solution": "Define the propositions: let $P$ denote \"the PHD finger from TFA1 is present in the tested construct,\" and let $B$ denote \"the construct shows binding/enrichment at H3K4me3-marked promoters in ChIP.\" In this framework:\n- Necessity of the PHD finger for binding corresponds to $B \\implies P$ (if binding is observed, the PHD is required; conversely, removing the PHD abolishes binding).\n- Sufficiency of the PHD finger for binding corresponds to $P \\implies B$ when the PHD is placed in an otherwise nonbinding context (e.g., fusion to HPZ, which does not natively bind H3K4me3).\n\nEvaluate each construct:\n1. WT-TFA1: Strong enrichment at H3K4me3 promoters. This shows that full-length TFA1 can bind these sites but does not by itself establish necessity or sufficiency of the PHD finger.\n2. TFA1-$\\Delta$PHD: No significant enrichment relative to control. Removal of the PHD finger eliminates binding, which supports necessity: in the absence of $P$, $B$ is not observed, consistent with $B \\implies P$.\n3. HPZ-PHD$_{\\text{TFA1}}$: Strong enrichment at H3K4me3 promoters despite HPZ lacking native affinity for H3K4me3. Introduction of the TFA1 PHD into a heterologous scaffold confers binding, supporting sufficiency: the presence of $P$ in a nonbinding background yields $B$, consistent with $P \\implies B$.\n\nTogether, the loss-of-function (deletion) and gain-of-function (domain swap) results demonstrate that the TFA1 PHD finger is both necessary (its removal abolishes binding) and sufficient (its presence is enough to confer binding in another protein) for recruitment to H3K4me3-marked promoters. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the PHD finger is both necessary and sufficient for H3K4me3 binding.\n\nNote: Option B contains a minor typographical error (\"H3'K4me3\"); it is interpreted as H3K4me3 and does not affect the conclusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2069933"}, {"introduction": "The state of chromatin is not static but is the result of a continuous and dynamic \"tug-of-war\" between competing enzymes.
