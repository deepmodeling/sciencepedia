This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2063722] will solidify your understanding of the relationship between a primary transcript (pre-mRNA) and its final, mature form. By starting with the lengths of the initial and final RNA molecules, you will perform a quantitative analysis to deduce how many introns were spliced out, reinforcing the core principles of mRNA maturation.", "problem": "In a eukaryotic cell, the process of converting the genetic information from a gene into a functional protein involves several steps of messenger RNA (mRNA) processing. A researcher is studying a newly discovered gene, designated *XEL-1*, in a laboratory model organism. The primary transcript, or pre-mRNA, transcribed directly from the *XEL-1* gene in the nucleus is found to be 8,450 nucleotides long.\n\nThis pre-mRNA undergoes post-transcriptional processing before it is exported to the cytoplasm. This processing includes splicing to remove non-coding introns, the addition of a 5' cap (a single modified guanine nucleotide), and the addition of a poly-A tail to the 3' end. The final, fully processed mature mRNA that is actively translated in the cytoplasm has a total length of 2,121 nucleotides. Further analysis reveals that the poly-A tail added to the *XEL-1* transcript is consistently 250 nucleotides long, and that all introns within this gene are of a remarkably uniform length, averaging 940 nucleotides each.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of introns that were removed from the pre-mRNA transcript to form the mature mRNA.", "solution": "Let $L_{\\text{pre}}$ denote the pre-mRNA length, $L_{\\text{mature}}$ the mature mRNA length, $L_{\\text{cap}}$ the 5' cap length, $L_{\\text{polyA}}$ the poly-A tail length, $E$ the total exon length encoded in the pre-mRNA, and $L_{\\text{introns}}$ the total length of introns removed. The given data are:\n$$L_{\\text{pre}}=8450,\\quad L_{\\text{mature}}=2121,\\quad L_{\\text{cap}}=1,\\quad L_{\\text{polyA}}=250.$$\n\nPost-transcriptional processing principles:\n- The pre-mRNA consists of exons and introns, so\n$$L_{\\text{pre}}=E+L_{\\text{introns}}.$$\n- The mature mRNA retains only exons and gains a cap and a poly-A tail, so\n$$L_{\\text{mature}}=E+L_{\\text{cap}}+L_{\\text{polyA}}.$$\n\nSolve for $E$ using the mature mRNA relation:\n$$E=L_{\\text{mature}}-L_{\\text{cap}}-L_{\\text{polyA}}=2121-1-250=1870.$$\n\nCompute total intron length from the pre-mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{introns}}=L_{\\text{pre}}-E=8450-1870=6580.$$\n\nGiven each intron has uniform length $940$, the number of introns $n$ is\n$$n=\\frac{L_{\\text{introns}}}{940}=\\frac{6580}{940}=7.$$\n\nTherefore, the total number of introns removed is $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "2063722"}, {"introduction": "Beyond splicing, RNA editing encompasses a fascinating variety of mechanisms that actively alter the nucleotide sequence of a transcript. This problem [@problem_id:1518587] explores a remarkable example from protozoans like *Trypanosoma*, where guide RNAs (gRNAs) direct the modification of the transcript's sequence. By manually tracing this template-driven editing process, you will gain a concrete understanding of how a cell can construct a functional message from a pre-mRNA that would otherwise be untranslatable.", "problem": "In the kinetoplasts of protozoans like *Trypanosoma*, a unique form of post-transcriptional modification known as RNA editing occurs. This process uses the gRNA as a template to modify the sequence of a pre-edited messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), creating a functional, mature mRNA. This editing is directed by a small guide RNA (gRNA).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1. The gRNA contains an 'anchor' sequence at its 3' end that is perfectly complementary to an 'anchor site' on the 3' portion of the pre-mRNA, allowing the gRNA to bind.\n2. The region of the gRNA upstream (5') of its anchor is the 'template region'. The region of the pre-mRNA upstream (5') of its anchor site is the 'pre-editing region'.\n3. The editing process modifies the pre-editing region to create a sequence that is fully complementary to the gRNA's template region. The established base pairing rules are A-U and G-C, with the allowance of a G-U 'wobble' pair. The anchor site region of the mRNA remains unchanged.\n\nYou are given the following sequences for a pre-mRNA and its corresponding gRNA.\n\n**pre-mRNA:** 5'-GGACAGAGCU-AGGAUCU-3'\n**gRNA:** 3'-UUCGUCUCGU-UCCUAGA-5'\n\nDetermine the full sequence of the mature, edited mRNA. Present your answer as a single continuous RNA sequence from 5' to 3'.", "solution": "The gRNA binds the pre-mRNA via its anchor sequence to the anchor site on the 3' portion of the pre-mRNA, leaving the pre-editing region upstream to be edited so that it becomes fully complementary to the gRNA template region. According to the given sequences, the pre-mRNA is 5'-GGACAGAGCU-AGGAUCU-3', where the 3' anchor site is the unchanged segment \"AGGAUCU\". The gRNA is 3'-UUCGUCUCGU-UCCUAGA-5', whose anchor segment \"UCCUAGA\" is complementary to the mRNA anchor site \"AGGAUCU\" (A-U, G-C pairing for each position), confirming the correct anchor pairing.\n\nThe gRNA template region is therefore the segment \"UUCGUCUCGU\". To make the pre-editing region of the mRNA fully complementary to this template, we assign each position by Watson-Crick pairing rules (A-U and G-C, with G-U wobble allowed but not needed here). For gRNA 3'-UUCGUCUCGU-5', the complementary mRNA sequence in 5' to 3' orientation is:\nU → A,\nU → A,\nC → G,\nG → C,\nU → A,\nC → G,\nU → A,\nC → G,\nG → C,\nU → A,\nyielding \"AAGCAGAGCA\".\n\nTherefore, the mature edited mRNA is the edited pre-editing region \"AAGCAGAGCA\" followed by the unchanged anchor site \"AGGAUCU\", giving the full 5' to 3' sequence:\nAAGCAGAGCAAGGAUCU.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AAGCAGAGCAAGGAUCU}$$", "id": "1518587"}, {"introduction": "Post-transcriptional editing events are often not 100% efficient, a feature that provides a powerful layer of gene regulation. This practice [@problem_id:2063683] challenges you to translate the concept of editing efficiency into a quantitative prediction about the resulting protein population. By calculating the ratio of full-length to truncated proteins produced from a partially edited transcript pool, you will see how RNA editing can directly control the type and amount of protein synthesized from a single gene.", "problem": "In a specific line of cultured human neurons, the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript for a protein called Neuro-modulator Factor X (NMF-X) undergoes two independent post-transcriptional editing events mediated by distinct enzymes. The full-length NMF-X protein consists of 300 amino acids.\n\nThe first editing event is a Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) conversion at the first position of codon 125, mediated by an Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Enzyme, Catalytic Polypeptide-like (APOBEC) enzyme. This editing occurs with an efficiency of 28.0% in this cell line, changing the original codon CAG (encoding Glutamine) to UAG, which is a translation termination (stop) codon.\n\nThe second editing event is an Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) conversion within codon 250, mediated by an Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme. This editing has an efficiency of 65.0%. The ribosome interprets Inosine as Guanosine (G), which alters the encoded amino acid but does not terminate translation.\n\nAssuming that all mRNA species are translated with equal efficiency and that there is no Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) of transcripts containing premature stop codons, calculate the molar ratio of the total population of all full-length NMF-X proteins (both original and isoform) to the population of truncated NMF-X proteins.\n\nExpress your answer as a single real number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $S$ denote the event that the APOBEC-mediated C-to-U edit at codon 125 creates a stop codon, with probability $p_{S}=0.280$.

The two events are independent.\n\nA premature stop at codon 125 truncates translation regardless of $A$, while the $A$ event alone never causes truncation.
