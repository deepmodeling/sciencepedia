This first exercise provides a foundational challenge: to visualize the direct outcome of exon skipping, one of the most common alternative splicing events. By correctly assembling the final mature mRNA, you will reinforce the core principles of splicing—the removal of introns and the joining of exons while preserving their relative order—a crucial skill for interpreting gene structure and function [@problem_id:2063406].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the primary transcript of a gene, known as precursor-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA), undergoes several processing steps to become a mature messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) ready for translation. Consider a hypothetical gene, *Temporin*, whose pre-mRNA transcript has a linear structure consisting of four exons (E1, E2, E3, E4) and three introns (I1, I2, I3). The segments are arranged from the 5' end to the 3' end in the following order:\n\n5' - E1 - I1 - E2 - I2 - E3 - I3 - E4 - 3'\n\nIn most tissues, this pre-mRNA is processed through canonical splicing. However, in neuronal tissue, the processing involves a specific alternative splicing event where Exon 3 (E3) is selectively excluded from the final mature mRNA molecule. The relative order of the remaining exons is preserved.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the structure of the mature *Temporin* mRNA produced in neuronal tissue?\n\nA. 5' - E1 - E4 - E2 - 3'\n\nB. 5' - E1 - I1 - E2 - I2 - E4 - 3'\n\nC. 5' - E1 - E2 - E3 - E4 - 3'\n\nD. 5' - E1 - E2 - E4 - 3'\n\nE. 5' - I1 - I2 - I3 - 3'", "solution": "We start from the given pre-mRNA organization: 5' - E1 - I1 - E2 - I2 - E3 - I3 - E4 - 3'. In canonical splicing, introns are removed and exons are ligated in their genomic order, yielding a mature mRNA with exons E1, E2, E3, E4 in order.\n\nIn neuronal tissue, a specific alternative splicing event occurs: exon skipping of E3. Exon skipping means the designated exon (E3) is excluded from the mature mRNA, while the remaining exons are spliced together, preserving their relative order. Introns are still removed during splicing.\n\nTherefore, the mature neuronal mRNA must contain E1, E2, and E4 in order, with all introns removed. This corresponds to 5' - E1 - E2 - E4 - 3'.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A places E4 before E2, which violates the preserved order requirement.\n- B retains introns, which is incorrect for mature mRNA.\n- C includes E3, which contradicts the specified exon skipping.\n- D is 5' - E1 - E2 - E4 - 3', which matches exon 3 skipping with preserved order and intron removal.\n- E consists only of introns, which cannot form mature mRNA.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2063406"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic mechanics, we now delve into the molecular causes of splicing errors, which are common sources of genetic diseases. This practice explores the critical role of consensus sequences that guide the splicing machinery. You will analyze the effect of a single point mutation at a canonical 5' splice site, allowing you to connect a specific genetic change to its functional consequence—intron retention—and understand why such precision is vital for producing functional proteins [@problem_id:2063443].", "problem": "A hypothetical human gene, *ENZ-X*, codes for a critical metabolic enzyme. The pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript of this gene consists of three exons (Exon 1, Exon 2, Exon 3) and two introns (Intron 1, Intron 2) in the following arrangement: Exon 1 - Intron 1 - Exon 2 - Intron 2 - Exon 3. Normal processing of this transcript involves the removal of both Intron 1 and Intron 2 to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) that is translated into the functional enzyme.\n\nA severe genetic disorder is traced to a single-nucleotide G-to-A mutation on the DNA coding strand. This mutation is located at the very first nucleotide position of Intron 1.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most probable structure of the mature mRNA molecule produced from this mutated *ENZ-X* gene?\n\nA. The mRNA will consist of Exon 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3, identical to the wild-type mRNA.\n\nB. The mRNA will consist of Exon 1 and Exon 3, with Exon 2 having been skipped.\n\nC. The mRNA will consist of Exon 1, the entirety of Intron 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3.\n\nD. Transcription of the gene will be halted, resulting in no mRNA product.\n\nE. The mRNA will consist only of Exon 1, as splicing cannot proceed past the mutation.", "solution": "The normal arrangement is Exon 1 - Intron 1 - Exon 2 - Intron 2 - Exon 3. In eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing by the major spliceosome, the canonical 5' splice donor site at the exon-intron junction is defined by an invariant dinucleotide: on the DNA coding strand it is typically GT at the first two nucleotides of the intron, which corresponds to $\\text{GU}$ in the pre-mRNA. The 3' splice acceptor site at the intron-exon junction typically ends in AG on the DNA coding strand, corresponding to $\\text{AG}$ in the pre-mRNA. Recognition of the 5' splice site requires the $\\text{GU}$ at the start of the intron and binding by U1 snRNP; this $\\text{GU}$-$\\text{AG}$ rule is essential for correct intron removal via the two transesterification reactions.\n\nThe mutation described is a single-nucleotide G-to-A change on the DNA coding strand at the very first nucleotide of Intron 1. In the wild type, the first two nucleotides of Intron 1 on the coding strand are GT, which yields a $\\text{GU}$ in the pre-mRNA at the 5' splice donor site. After the mutation, the first nucleotide on the coding strand becomes A, changing GT to AT on DNA and thus $\\text{GU}$ to $\\text{AU}$ on the pre-mRNA at the 5' splice donor of Intron 1.\n\nDisruption of the invariant G at the 5' splice donor site abolishes the canonical $\\text{GU}$ required for U1 snRNP recognition and thus prevents normal splicing at the 5' end of Intron 1. Without a functional 5' donor, the spliceosome cannot excise Intron 1 by the normal pathway. The most probable outcome in the absence of an alternative nearby cryptic donor site is retention of the entirety of Intron 1 in the mature mRNA. This mutation does not halt transcription because transcription proceeds independently of splicing signals, and it does not preclude splicing of other introns whose splice sites remain intact; therefore, Intron 2 can still be removed normally, producing an mRNA that contains Exon 1, retained Intron 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely because the 5' splice donor site of Intron 1 is disrupted, so normal removal of Intron 1 will not occur.\n- B (skipping Exon 2) is not the expected consequence of destroying the 5' donor of Intron 1; the primary effect is failure to remove Intron 1, not skipping of Exon 2.\n- C matches the expected intron retention outcome: Exon 1, the entirety of Intron 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3.\n- D is incorrect because transcription is not halted by an intronic splice-site mutation.\n- E is incorrect because splicing can proceed for other introns (Intron 2), and the pre-mRNA will not consist only of Exon 1.\n\nTherefore, the most probable structure is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2063443"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we bridge theory with experimental practice by exploring how scientists detect and differentiate splice variants in the laboratory.
