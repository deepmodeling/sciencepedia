The cycle's intermediates are vital precursors for a vast range of biomolecules, from amino acids to lipids. This practice problem [@problem_id:2080519] challenges you to perform a complete energy audit, tracking the consumption of $ATP$ and $NADPH$ from the initial fixation of $CO_2$ to the synthesis of glycerol, a specialized molecule used for survival in some organisms. Mastering this type of metabolic accounting is a fundamental skill for understanding cellular efficiency and resource allocation.", "problem": "Certain extremophilic algae produce glycerol as an osmoprotectant to survive in high-salinity environments. This glycerol is synthesized from intermediates of the Calvin-Benson cycle.\n\nThe process of carbon fixation in these algae involves three main stages.\nFirst, in the **fixation** stage, three molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) are combined with an acceptor molecule.\nSecond, in the **reduction** stage, the products of fixation are converted into six molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This stage consumes six molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and six molecules of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).\nThird, in the **regeneration** stage, five of the six G3P molecules are used to regenerate the initial CO2 acceptor molecule, a process that consumes an additional three molecules of ATP. The single remaining G3P molecule represents the net product of one turn of the cycle that fixes three CO2 molecules.\n\nThe alga then synthesizes glycerol from this net G3P molecule. This conversion is a simplified two-step pathway:\n1.  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is reduced to glycerol-3-phosphate, a reaction that consumes one molecule of NADPH.\n2.  Glycerol-3-phosphate is then dephosphorylated to produce one molecule of glycerol, a step that does not consume any ATP or NADPH.\n\nDetermine the total number of ATP molecules and the total number of NADPH molecules that are consumed to synthesize one molecule of glycerol, starting from the initial fixation of CO2 molecules. Your answer should be two integers: the number of ATP molecules followed by the number of NADPH molecules, in that order.", "solution": "We track ATP and NADPH consumption from carbon fixation through glycerol synthesis, per the given stoichiometries.\n\nBy statement, one turn that fixes three molecules of carbon dioxide yields one net glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). The energetic cost within the Calvin-Benson cycle is partitioned as follows:\n- Reduction stage: consumes six ATP and six NADPH to convert the fixation products into six G3P.\n- Regeneration stage: consumes an additional three ATP to regenerate the CO2 acceptor from five G3P, leaving one net G3P.\n\nTherefore, per one net G3P exiting the cycle, the Calvin-Benson cycle consumes\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{ATP,Calvin}}=6+3=9, \\qquad n_{\\mathrm{NADPH,Calvin}}=6.\n$$\n\nThe conversion of this net G3P to glycerol proceeds via:\n1) G3P to glycerol-3-phosphate: consumes one NADPH and zero ATP, so\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{ATP,glycerol\\;path}}=0, \\qquad n_{\\mathrm{NADPH,glycerol\\;path}}=1.\n$$\n2) Dephosphorylation to glycerol: consumes zero ATP and zero NADPH.\n\nSumming Calvin-Benson and glycerol pathway costs gives the totals per one molecule of glycerol:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{ATP,tot}}=n_{\\mathrm{ATP,Calvin}}+n_{\\mathrm{ATP,glycerol\\;path}}=9+0=9,\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{NADPH,tot}}=n_{\\mathrm{NADPH,Calvin}}+n_{\\mathrm{NADPH,glycerol\\;path}}=6+1=7.\n$$\n\nThus, synthesizing one glycerol from CO2 fixation requires nine ATP and seven NADPH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}9 & 7\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2080519"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic pathways are not static blueprints; they are dynamic, responsive systems finely tuned to the cell's environment and energy status. This exercise [@problem_id:2080541] presents a classic thought experiment that explores the tight coupling between the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin-Benson cycle. By simulating an abrupt stop in the light-driven supply of $ATP$ and $NADPH$, you will predict and quantify the resulting shifts in the concentrations of key intermediates, gaining a deeper appreciation for the regulatory logic that governs photosynthetic carbon metabolism.", "problem": "A biochemist prepares a suspension of isolated, photosynthetically active chloroplasts in a buffer solution.

The RuBisCO reaction, however, proceeds at its initial steady-state rate.\n\nRuBisCO fixes carbon dioxide at a rate $v_{C}$ (given as constant), and due to the stoichiometry of the carboxylation reaction (RuBP + $CO_{2} \\rightarrow 2$ 3-PGA), the instantaneous production rate of 3-PGA is $2v_{C}$.
