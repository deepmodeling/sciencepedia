A biochemist isolates intact thylakoids from plant cells and performs the following procedure entirely in the dark:\n\nFirst, the thylakoid vesicles are incubated in a large volume of an acidic buffer solution at pH 4.0 until the internal pH of the thylakoid lumen equilibrates with the surrounding buffer.\n\nNext, the thylakoids are rapidly collected and transferred to a new, larger volume of a basic buffer solution at pH 8.0.

Consequences follow directly:\n\n1) No electrons can enter the linear (non-cyclic) electron transport chain from water. Hence, non-cyclic photophosphorylation, which requires PSII to deliver electrons through the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex to Photosystem I (PSI) and ultimately reduce $\\text{NADP}^+$ to $\\text{NADPH}$ while evolving $\\text{O}_2$, cannot proceed. This explains observations (2) and (3): no detectable $\\text{O}_2$ and no net increase in $\\text{NADPH}$.

Instead of reducing $\\text{NADP}^+$, electrons are routed back to the plastoquinone pool and the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex (via ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase or an NDH-like pathway), and then return to PSI.

Thus, option C is consistent with all data.\n\n4) Option D is excluded because cyanobacteria do not possess mitochondria; their respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport occur in thylakoid membranes, not mitochondrial membranes. Even aside from that, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation would require respiratory substrates and an external terminal electron acceptor; the experimental observations specifically point to a light-driven, photosynthetic source of $\\text{ATP}$ without $\\text{O}_2$ evolution.\n\n5) Option E (substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis) can produce $\\text{ATP}$, but it is not light-dependent and would not specifically account for the observed large increase in $\\text{ATP}$ upon illumination when PSII is blocked.
