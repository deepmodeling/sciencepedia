These two electrons are liberated by the oxidation of one molecule of water at the oxygen-evolving complex associated with Photosystem II (PSII), a reaction that also releases protons directly into the thylakoid lumen. The electrons are then passed along an electron transport chain to the cytochrome b6f complex.

This thought experiment requires you to dissect the contributions of the different components of the electron transport chain to the overall proton motive force.

A crucial component of this chain is the cytochrome b6f complex, which facilitates electron transfer and contributes to the transmembrane proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. This proton translocation is accomplished via the Q-cycle.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following for a standard, or \"wild-type,\" chloroplast:\n1.  The synthesis of one molecule of ATP by ATP synthase requires the translocation of $N_p$ protons across the thylakoid membrane, from the lumen to the stroma.\n2.  The oxidation of two water molecules to produce one molecule of O₂ releases four protons into the thylakoid lumen and provides four electrons to the electron transport chain.\n3.

In this mutant, the Q-cycle is completely disabled. The complex can still transfer electrons from plastoquinol (PQH₂) to plastocyanin, but it can no longer actively pump protons from the stroma. Instead, for every two electrons it processes, it simply facilitates the release of the two protons from one oxidized PQH₂ molecule into the thylakoid lumen.
