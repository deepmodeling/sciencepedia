These electrons are then passed through a series of carriers, including the cytochrome b6f complex, to Photosystem I (PSI), and ultimately used to reduce $\\text{NADP}^+$ to NADPH.\n\nDuring this process, a proton gradient is established across the thylakoid membrane, with protons accumulating in the thylakoid lumen.
