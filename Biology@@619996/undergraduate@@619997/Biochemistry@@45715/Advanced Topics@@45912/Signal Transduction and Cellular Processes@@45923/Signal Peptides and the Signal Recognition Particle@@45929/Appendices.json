This exercise explores the most fundamental principle of protein sorting by examining what happens when a protein lacks this critical ER-targeting signal. By predicting the outcome of a classic cell-free translation experiment, you will solidify your understanding of why the signal peptide is the non-negotiable first step in the secretory pathway [@problem_id:2076108].", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the mechanisms of protein sorting using a cell-free system. This system is prepared to contain all necessary components for in-vitro translation: functional ribosomes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), amino acids, and the required energy sources. The biochemist adds a purified messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes for lactate dehydrogenase, a protein that functions exclusively in the cytosol. To this translation-competent system, they also add a preparation of microsomes, which are small vesicles derived from the membrane of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and contain functional protein translocation machinery. After incubating the mixture under conditions that support protein synthesis, the final location of the newly synthesized lactate dehydrogenase protein is determined.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The lactate dehydrogenase protein will be synthesized, imported into the lumen of the microsomes, and its signal sequence will be cleaved.\n\nB. Translation will begin, but it will be permanently arrested after about 70 amino acids are polymerized because the ribosome cannot dock with the microsomes.\n\nC. The full-length lactate dehydrogenase protein will be synthesized and will be found exclusively in the solution outside of the microsomes.\n\nD. The lactate dehydrogenase protein will be partially synthesized on free ribosomes, then synthesis will halt and the incomplete polypeptide will be targeted to the microsomes for degradation.", "solution": "We identify the relevant cellular targeting principle: proteins destined for the ER lumen or secretory pathway possess an N-terminal signal sequence that is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding transiently pauses translation and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane via the SRP receptor, allowing co-translational translocation through the translocon. After insertion into the ER, the signal peptide is typically cleaved by signal peptidase in the ER lumen.\n\nWe apply this to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is a cytosolic protein. Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. LDH lacks an ER signal sequence because its final destination is the cytosol.\n2. In a cell-free translation system containing ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, and energy sources, translation of an mRNA lacking an ER signal sequence proceeds entirely on free ribosomes in the cytosolic phase of the mixture.\n3. The presence of microsomes (functional ER-derived vesicles) only affects proteins bearing ER-targeting signals, because SRP recognizes signal sequences and mediates docking to the microsomes. Without a signal sequence, SRP does not bind, there is no translational pause, and there is no docking to the microsomes.\n4. Therefore, translation of LDH will proceed to completion without SRP-mediated arrest or ER targeting, generating full-length LDH in the soluble fraction.\n5. Consequently, LDH will not be imported into the microsomes, and no signal peptide cleavage will occur, because there is no signal peptide present.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A is incorrect because LDH has no ER signal sequence; hence it will neither be imported into microsomes nor have a signal sequence cleaved.\n- Option B is incorrect because SRP-mediated translational arrest after synthesis of an N-terminal signal sequence occurs only when such a sequence exists; LDH lacks it, so translation is not arrested.\n- Option C is correct: the full-length LDH will be synthesized and found in the solution outside the microsomes.\n- Option D is incorrect because there is no mechanism to halt synthesis and target LDH to microsomes for degradation; cytosolic proteins simply complete translation on free ribosomes.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is that LDH is synthesized to completion and remains in the solution outside microsomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2076108"}, {"introduction": "Successful targeting to the ER is just the beginning of a protein's journey; it must also be correctly processed. One of the first modifications for many secretory proteins is the removal of the now-redundant signal peptide by an enzyme called signal peptidase. This practice challenges you to connect a molecular event to a tangible experimental result by predicting how this cleavage, or its absence, would be visualized using SDS-PAGE, a ubiquitous biochemical technique for separating proteins by size [@problem_id:2076087].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate the post-translational processing of a hypothetical secretory protein, which we will call \"prolactin-alpha\". The messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding prolactin-alpha codes for a precursor protein that is 310 amino acids in length. This precursor includes an N-terminal signal peptide of 25 amino acids that is essential for directing the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion.\n\nTo study its synthesis and processing, the mRNA for prolactin-alpha is translated in two different in-vitro (cell-free) systems.\n\n**System A:** A standard cell-free translation system containing ribosomes, amino acids, tRNAs, and all necessary protein factors. This system is supplemented with functional microsomes, which are vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that contain all the necessary machinery for protein translocation and processing, including an active signal peptidase enzyme.\n\n**System B:** A system identical to System A, but with one modification: the microsomes have been prepared in such a way that the signal peptidase enzyme is non-functional. All other microsomal functions, such as the protein translocation channel (translocon), remain fully intact.\n\nAfter the translation reaction is allowed to proceed to completion in both systems, the protein contents of each reaction are denatured with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a technique where smaller proteins migrate further through the gel than larger ones.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the expected outcome when comparing the protein bands corresponding to prolactin-alpha from System A and System B on the SDS-PAGE gel?\n\nA. The prolactin-alpha band from System B will migrate further down the gel than the band from System A.\n\nB. The prolactin-alpha bands from System A and System B will migrate to the same position on the gel.\n\nC.

The prolactin-alpha band from System A will migrate further down the gel than the band from System B.\n\nE. The prolactin-alpha band from System B will be completely absent, replaced by a smaller band corresponding to the 25-amino-acid signal peptide.", "solution": "The precursor polypeptide encoded by the mRNA is specified to be 310 amino acids long, including an N-terminal signal peptide of 25 amino acids.\n\nIn System A, microsomes contain functional signal peptidase. During cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase. Therefore, the mature secretory protein produced in System A has length\n$$L_{A} = 310 - 25 = 285 \\text{ amino acids}.$$\n\nIn System B, the microsomal translocon is functional, so the nascent chain is still translocated, but the signal peptidase is non-functional. Thus, the signal peptide is not cleaved, and the final product retains the extra 25 amino acids. Therefore, the product in System B has length\n$$L_{B} = 310 \\text{ amino acids}.$$\n\nSDS-PAGE separates denatured polypeptides primarily by molecular mass; smaller polypeptides migrate further down the gel than larger ones. Since $L_{A}  L_{B}$, the prolactin-alpha band from System A will migrate further than the band from System B.\n\nNo band will be absent in System B because translation and translocation still occur; there will also be no free 25-amino-acid signal peptide band in System B because cleavage does not occur there.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the prolactin-alpha band from System A migrates further down the gel than the band from System B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2076087"}, {"introduction": "Protein targeting is a highly dynamic process that must occur within a specific time window to be successful. This problem introduces the concept of kinetic competition, where ER targeting by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) must \"win\" a race against other intramolecular events, such as the protein folding into its compact tertiary structure. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving a rapidly folding protein domain, you will explore how the timing of molecular events is just as crucial as the presence of the correct signals for ensuring a protein reaches its final destination [@problem_id:2076138].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, proteins destined for secretion or for insertion into various membranes are typically directed to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) by an N-terminal signal peptide. This process is usually co-translational, involving the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP).\n\nA biochemist constructs a chimeric protein to study the kinetics of this targeting process. The protein consists of two parts:\n1.  An N-terminal signal peptide, 20 amino acids in length.\n2.  A specialized protein domain called `FoldFast`, 50 amino acids in length, fused immediately C-terminal to the signal peptide.\n\nThe synthesis and targeting process is governed by the following set of empirically determined rules:\n- The ribosome exit tunnel shields the most recently synthesized 30 amino acids of the nascent polypeptide chain from the cytosol.\n- Stable binding of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) to the ribosome-nascent chain complex, which is required to pause translation and target the complex to the ER, occurs only after the ribosome has polymerized a total of at least 85 amino acids.\n- The `FoldFast` domain is designed to collapse into a very stable and compact tertiary structure as it is being synthesized. This folding event happens almost instantaneously once the 30th amino acid residue of the `FoldFast` domain itself emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel.\n- Once folded, the `FoldFast` domain is too large to pass through the ER's translocon channel, and its compact structure completely and irreversibly obstructs the adjacent N-terminal signal peptide, preventing it from binding to SRP.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most likely primary subcellular localization of the newly synthesized chimeric protein?\n\nA. In the cytosol.\n\nB. In the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nC. Secreted from the cell.\n\nD. In the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nE. Embedded in the inner nuclear membrane.", "solution": "Define the relevant lengths and thresholds:\n- Signal peptide length $L_{S}=20$ (amino acids).\n- FoldFast domain length $L_{F}=50$.\n- Ribosome exit tunnel shielding length $L_{T}=30$.\n- Minimal nascent chain length for stable SRP binding $N_{\\text{SRP}}=85$.\n\nBy the exit tunnel rule, residue $i$ of the nascent chain emerges into the cytosol when the total polymerized length $N$ first satisfies $N \\geq i+L_{T}$. The FoldFast domain begins immediately after the signal peptide, so its $30$th residue is at overall position\n$$\ni_{\\text{30F}}=L_{S}+30=20+30=50.\n$$\nTherefore, the $30$th FoldFast residue emerges when\n$$\nN_{\\text{emerge}}=i_{\\text{30F}}+L_{T}=50+30=80.\n$$\nBy design, FoldFast collapses essentially instantaneously once its $30$th residue emerges; hence co-translational folding would initiate when $N \\geq 80$. Compare this to the SRP requirement: stable SRP binding occurs only when\n$$\nN \\geq N_{\\text{SRP}}=85.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nN_{\\text{emerge}}=80  N_{\\text{SRP}}=85,\n$$\nso even in any scenario where the chain extends beyond these lengths, FoldFast would fold before SRP could stably bind, obstructing the signal peptide and irreversibly preventing SRP engagement.\n\nFor the specific chimera here, the total length is\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=L_{S}+L_{F}=20+50=70,\n$$\nwhich also satisfies\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}  N_{\\text{SRP}}.\n$$\nTherefore, during translation of this construct, the threshold for stable SRP binding is never reached, so SRP cannot pause translation or target the complex to the ER. Translation will complete on free cytosolic ribosomes. Upon or after release, FoldFast will fold, further precluding any post-translational translocation through the ER translocon (it is too large to pass and blocks the adjacent signal peptide). Consequently, the protein remains in the cytosol rather than entering the secretory pathway.\n\nHence, the most likely primary subcellular localization is the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2076138"}]}
