An $\\alpha_{1}$-derived interior confers coupling to $G_{q/11}$ rather than $G_{s}$.\n\nUpon epinephrine binding, the receptor catalyzes nucleotide exchange on $G_{q}$:\n$$G_{q\\alpha}\\text{-GDP} \\rightarrow G_{q\\alpha}\\text{-GTP},$$\nleading to activation of phospholipase C$\\beta$ (PLC$\\beta$).

In contrast, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is the hallmark second messenger of $G_{s}$-coupled receptors (native $\\beta_{2}$), which is not expected here because the intracellular domains specify $G_{q/11}$ coupling.
