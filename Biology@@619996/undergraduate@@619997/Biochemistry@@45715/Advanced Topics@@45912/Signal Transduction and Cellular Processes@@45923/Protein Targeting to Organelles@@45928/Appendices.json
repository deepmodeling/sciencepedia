{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of a protein from its site of synthesis to its final destination is governed by a series of molecular zip codes, or targeting signals. This first exercise explores the fundamental mechanism of co-translational insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. By analyzing the interplay between a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence and a stop-transfer anchor sequence [@problem_id:2067160], you will predict the final orientation of a simple transmembrane protein, a topology known as Type I.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a newly discovered protein called \"Tectorin-A\". Their analysis of the protein's primary amino acid sequence reveals two key features:\n\n1.  An N-terminal, 20-amino-acid-long signal sequence that is recognized by the cellular machinery responsible for targeting proteins to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). This sequence is known to be cleaved off by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen.\n2.  A single, highly hydrophobic domain of 25 amino acids located centrally within the polypeptide chain. This domain functions as a stop-transfer anchor sequence.\n\nAssuming the protein is synthesized on a ribosome that becomes associated with the ER membrane, predict the final topology of the mature Tectorin-A protein with respect to the ER membrane and its surrounding compartments.\n\nA. The protein will be a single-pass transmembrane protein with its N-terminus in the ER lumen and its C-terminus in the cytosol.\n\nB. The protein will be a single-pass transmembrane protein with its C-terminus in the ER lumen and its N-terminus in the cytosol.\n\nC. The entire mature protein will be secreted into the ER lumen and will not be associated with the membrane.\n\nD. The entire protein will be synthesized and released into the cytosol, not entering the ER at all.\n\nE. The protein will span the membrane twice, with both its N-terminus and C-terminus located in the cytosol.", "solution": "Given an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER, the following sequence of events occurs:\n\n1) The N-terminal signal sequence is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) in the cytosol, which pauses translation and delivers the ribosome to the SRP receptor on the ER membrane. The ribosome engages the Sec61 translocon, and translation resumes with the growing polypeptide entering the translocon channel.\n\n2) Because the signal sequence is N-terminal and cleavable, it initiates translocation of the nascent chain into the ER lumen. A signal peptidase in the ER lumen cleaves the N-terminal signal sequence, leaving the new N-terminus of the protein in the ER lumen. At this stage, the polypeptide N-terminus is luminal.\n\n3) As translation continues, the central, highly hydrophobic 25-amino-acid domain reaches the translocon. This sequence acts as a stop-transfer anchor. By definition, a stop-transfer sequence halts further translocation of the polypeptide through the channel and causes lateral partitioning of the hydrophobic segment into the lipid bilayer, forming a single transmembrane helix.\n\n4) Once the stop-transfer anchor inserts into the membrane, portions of the polypeptide synthesized after this segment are not translocated into the lumen; instead, they remain on the cytosolic side. Thus, the C-terminal region resides in the cytosol.\n\n5) Topology prediction: The protein becomes a single-pass (single-spanning) transmembrane protein with its N-terminus in the ER lumen (due to initial translocation and signal peptide cleavage) and its C-terminus in the cytosol (due to the stop-transfer anchor halting translocation and anchoring the protein). This corresponds to a type I membrane protein topology.\n\n6) Exclusion of alternatives:\n- Option B would require a signal-anchor that orients the N-terminus to the cytosol, which is inconsistent with a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence.\n- Option C would require no stop-transfer/membrane anchor, contradicting the presence of the hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence.\n- Option D is incompatible with the presence of an N-terminal ER signal sequence.\n- Option E would require two transmembrane segments, but only one stop-transfer anchor is described.\n\nTherefore, the correct topology is a single-pass transmembrane protein with N-terminus in the ER lumen and C-terminus in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2067160"}, {"introduction": "After predicting topology from a protein's sequence, the next step in cell biology is often to verify it experimentally. This practice challenge puts you in the role of a biochemist interpreting a protease protection assay, a classic technique to map a protein's orientation across a membrane.

The full-length protein has a total molecular weight of 80 kDa. Based on sequence analysis, the protein is predicted to have seven transmembrane alpha-helices. The proposed topology begins with the N-terminus in the cytosol, followed by seven alternating transmembrane segments and extramembrane loops, resulting in the C-terminus being located in the ER lumen.\n\nThe predicted molecular weights of the distinct domains are as follows:\n- N-terminal cytosolic tail: 5 kDa\n- Transmembrane helices (TM1 through TM7): 3 kDa each\n- Lumenal loop 1 (between TM1 and TM2): 6 kDa\n- Cytosolic loop 2 (between TM2 and TM3): 10 kDa\n- Lumenal loop 3 (between TM3 and TM4): 8 kDa\n- Cytosolic loop 4 (between TM4 and TM5): 12 kDa\n- Lumenal loop 5 (between TM5 and TM6): 9 kDa\n- Cytosolic loop 6 (between TM6 and TM7): 4 kDa\n- C-terminal lumenal tail: 5 kDa\n\nTo verify this topology, the researchers perform an in vitro translation of Helicoidin-7 messenger RNA in the presence of ER-derived vesicles (microsomes). After translation and insertion are complete, the sample is divided into three aliquots and treated as follows:\n- **Condition A:** A protease, which cannot cross the lipid bilayer, is added to the microsome suspension.\n- **Condition B:** A non-ionic detergent is added to solubilize the microsomes, followed by the addition of the same protease.\n- **Condition C:** A buffer solution without protease is added (control).\n\nAll samples are then subjected to Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography to visualize the newly synthesized protein fragments.

This problem presents a clinical-style scenario involving the mis-sorting of a lysosomal enzyme, challenging you to deduce the underlying molecular defect [@problem_id:2067131]. This exercise illuminates the critical mannose-6-phosphate ($M6P$) pathway and highlights how protein structure, post-translational modification, and cellular trafficking are inextricably linked.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a soluble globular enzyme, which we will call Lysosomal Hydrolase X (LHX), normally found within the lysosomes of human fibroblasts. In healthy cells, LHX is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, transported through the Golgi apparatus, and correctly sorted to the lysosome. In a patient with a newly discovered metabolic disorder, researchers identify a single point mutation in the gene encoding LHX, resulting in a lysine to an asparagine substitution at position 287 (K287N).\n\nFurther characterization reveals the following:\n1.  The K287 residue is located on the surface of the folded protein but is not part of any known linear signal sequence (e.g., an N-terminal signal peptide or a C-terminal sorting motif). It is also distant in the primary amino acid sequence from any N-linked glycosylation sites.\n2.  The mutant K287N protein, when isolated from patient cells, is catalytically active, suggesting its overall tertiary structure is largely intact and it is not grossly misfolded.\n3.  Analysis of cultured patient fibroblasts shows that while the mutant LHX protein is synthesized at a normal rate, it does not accumulate in lysosomes. Instead, the active enzyme is found almost exclusively in the extracellular culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular explanation for this observed mis-sorting of the K287N mutant of LHX?\n\nA. The K287N mutation prevents the protein from binding to chaperone proteins in the Golgi, causing it to be prematurely secreted.\n\nB. The K287N mutation introduces a novel cleavage site for a protease, which fragments the protein in the trans-Golgi and leads to the secretion of the active fragment.\n\nC. The K287 residue is a critical part of a conformational signal patch necessary for the enzymatic addition of a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tag. The loss of this residue prevents M6P addition, shunting the protein into the default secretory pathway.\n\nD. The K287N mutation creates a new hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence that overrides the lysosomal sorting machinery and targets the protein for constitutive secretion.\n\nE. The K287 residue is essential for the protein to be packaged into COPII-coated vesicles for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, causing it to be rerouted for secretion via a non-canonical pathway.", "solution": "Lysosomal soluble enzymes synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum acquire N-linked oligosaccharides and are then modified in the cis-Golgi by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which recognizes a three-dimensional conformational signal patch on the folded protein surface. This enzyme transfers a phospho-N-acetylglucosamine to specific mannose residues; after uncovering, this yields mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). M6P is recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network, which package the enzyme into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to endosomes and lysosomes. In the absence of M6P addition or receptor recognition, the default pathway for a correctly folded soluble luminal protein is constitutive secretion to the extracellular space.\n\nApply the given findings to this pathway:\n1. The K287 residue is surface-exposed and not part of any linear targeting sequence and is distant in primary sequence from N-linked glycosylation sites. This is consistent with participation in a conformational signal patch, which is formed by spatially proximate but sequence-distant residues on the folded surface and is distinct from the consensus sequences of N-linked glycosylation.\n2. The K287N mutant is catalytically active, implying correct folding and preserved tertiary structure, which argues against gross misfolding or ER retention. Therefore, the defect likely affects a specific sorting step rather than folding.\n3. The mutant enzyme is made at normal rates yet accumulates extracellularly, which is the hallmark of failed M6P-dependent sorting: without M6P tagging or recognition, the enzyme proceeds by default into the constitutive secretory pathway and is secreted in active form.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A is unlikely because Golgi chaperone binding is not the principal determinant of lysosomal sorting for soluble enzymes; moreover, failure to bind a chaperone would more likely cause misfolding or degradation rather than a clean, active secretion pattern.\n- B posits novel proteolysis in the trans-Golgi leading to secretion of a fragment. The data show secretion of active enzyme without evidence of fragmentation; this is not a canonical lysosomal sorting failure mechanism.\n- C matches the canonical mechanism: K287 contributes to a conformational signal patch required for recognition by the phosphotransferase that installs the M6P marker. Disrupting this residue impairs M6P addition, so the enzyme is not captured by M6P receptors and is secreted by default.\n- D is implausible because an internal single amino acid substitution at position 287 cannot create a new hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence; signal peptides reside at the N-terminus and are defined by contiguous hydrophobic residues.\n- E is incorrect because soluble luminal cargo enter COPII vesicles primarily by bulk flow or via luminal cargo receptors, not via a specific surface lysine; a failure of COPII packaging would cause ER retention, not extracellular accumulation.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is that K287 participates in the conformational recognition patch necessary for M6P tagging; its substitution prevents M6P addition and causes default secretion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2067131"}]}
