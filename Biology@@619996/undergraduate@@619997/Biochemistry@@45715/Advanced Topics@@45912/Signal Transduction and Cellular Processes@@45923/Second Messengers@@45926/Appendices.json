Through a series of binding and activity assays, they determine that the receptor for hypotensin is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Further analysis reveals that upon hormone binding, this receptor exclusively associates with a heterotrimeric G-protein containing an inhibitory alpha subunit, denoted as $G\\alpha_i$. Given that the primary target of G-protein alpha subunits in this particular cell type is the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, what is the predicted immediate effect on the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) when the cell is stimulated by hypotensin?\n\nA) A significant increase.\n\nB) A significant decrease.\n\nC) No change.\n\nD) An initial, transient increase followed by a sharp decrease.\n\nE) A slow, oscillatory behavior.", "solution": "The question asks to predict the immediate effect of a hormone binding to a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is linked to an inhibitory G-protein alpha subunit ($G\\alpha_i$) on the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nStep 1: Understand the baseline state.\nIn a typical cell, there is a basal level of activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into cAMP. Simultaneously, another class of enzymes called phosphodiesterases constantly degrades cAMP into AMP. The balance between the synthesis by adenylyl cyclase and degradation by phosphodiesterases establishes a steady-state, basal concentration of intracellular cAMP.\n\nStep 2: Trace the signaling cascade upon hormone binding.\nThe signaling pathway is initiated when the hormone, hypotensin, binds to its specific GPCR on the cell surface.\n\nStep 3: G-protein activation.\nThe binding of the hormone induces a conformational change in the GPCR. This activated receptor now functions as a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) for its associated heterotrimeric G-protein. The G-protein consists of three subunits: $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$. In its inactive state, the $\\alpha$ subunit is bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP). The activated GPCR facilitates the release of GDP from the $\\alpha$ subunit and its replacement by Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), which is more abundant in the cytosol.\n\nStep 4: Subunit dissociation and effector interaction.\nThe problem states that the receptor is coupled to a $G\\alpha_i$ subunit. When $G\\alpha_i$ binds GTP, it undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from both the GPCR and the $\\beta\\gamma$ dimer. This free $G\\alpha_i$-GTP complex is now the active signaling molecule.\n\nStep 5: Effect on adenylyl cyclase.\nThe \"i\" in $G\\alpha_i$ stands for \"inhibitory\". The primary function of the activated $G\\alpha_i$-GTP complex is to bind to and inhibit the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.\n\nStep 6: Impact on cAMP levels.\nAdenylyl cyclase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing cAMP from ATP. By inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, the $G\\alpha_i$-GTP complex reduces the rate of cAMP production. While the degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterases continues at its normal rate, the synthesis is now suppressed.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\nThe net result of decreased synthesis and continued degradation is a rapid drop in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Therefore, the immediate effect of stimulating the cell with hypotensin is a significant decrease in cAMP levels.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA) A significant increase: This would occur if the receptor were coupled to a stimulatory alpha subunit, $G\\alpha_s$.\nB) A significant decrease: This is consistent with the inhibitory action of $G\\alpha_i$ on adenylyl cyclase.\nC) No change: This would imply that $G\\alpha_i$ does not interact with adenylyl cyclase, which is incorrect.\nD) An initial, transient increase followed by a sharp decrease: This describes a more complex feedback mechanism not indicated by the problem's immediate scope.\nE) A slow, oscillatory behavior: This is characteristic of other second messenger systems (like $Ca^{2+}$) and is not the primary, direct effect of a simple $G\\alpha_i$ pathway activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2074290"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the cAMP system, we now turn to the other major second messenger pathway initiated by phospholipase C.

By comparing the entire cycle from synthesis to termination, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the biochemical bookkeeping involved in cellular communication and the metabolic trade-offs of different signaling strategies.", "problem": "A hypothetical eukaryotic cell utilizes two distinct signaling pathways to regulate different downstream processes. The first pathway uses cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) to activate Protein Kinase A (PKA). The second pathway uses the cleavage of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) to generate Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and Diacylglycerol (DAG), which ultimately activate Protein Kinase C (PKC). Your task is to compare the total energetic cost, in Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) equivalents, for each pathway to generate its respective active kinase.\n\nAssume the following biochemical parameters and stoichiometries for the cell:\n\n**PKA Pathway (cAMP-dependent):**\n1.  **Synthesis:** The conversion of one molecule of ATP to one molecule of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase is accompanied by the production of pyrophosphate (PPi). The subsequent hydrolysis of PPi is energetically equivalent to the hydrolysis of one ATP. Therefore, the total cost for synthesizing one molecule of cAMP is 2 ATP equivalents.\n2.  **Activation:** The inactive PKA is a tetramer. The binding of four molecules of cAMP to this tetramer causes it to dissociate, releasing two separate, active catalytic subunits.\n3.  **Termination/Recycling:** To terminate the signal, each molecule of cAMP is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP). The cell then recycles AMP back into the ATP pool. The net energetic cost for this entire recycling process (from one cAMP back to a state of readiness) is 2 ATP equivalents per molecule of cAMP.\n\n**PKC Pathway ($IP_3$/DAG-dependent):**\n1.  **Synthesis:** The cell maintains a ready pool of Phosphatidylinositol (PI). The synthesis of one molecule of $PIP_2$ from one molecule of PI requires two sequential phosphorylation steps, each consuming one molecule of ATP.\n2.  **Activation:** An activated Phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolyzes one molecule of $PIP_2$ into one molecule of $IP_3$ and one molecule of DAG. The activation of one molecule of PKC requires the binding of precisely one molecule of DAG. The concurrent release of Ca²⁺ is also required, but DAG is the limiting factor for the number of PKC molecules activated.\n3.  **Termination/Recycling:**\n    a.  **Lipid Recycling:** To terminate the signal, each molecule of DAG is recycled back into PI. This multi-step process consumes a total of 3 ATP equivalents per molecule of DAG.\n    b.  **Calcium Pumping:** Each molecule of $IP_3$ generated binds to a receptor on the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), causing the release of exactly 100 calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) into the cytosol. To restore the ion gradient, these $Ca^{2+}$ ions are pumped back into the ER by the Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump, which expends one ATP for every two $Ca^{2+}$ ions it transports.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total energetic cost to produce $10^4$ active PKC molecules to the total energetic cost to produce $10^4$ active PKA catalytic subunits.
