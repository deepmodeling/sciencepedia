Under normal physiological conditions, Labyrinthin exists in a soluble, functional state that is predominantly alpha-helical. However, upon exposure to a specific environmental stressor, the protein undergoes a conformational change, leading to the formation of insoluble, non-functional aggregates. This aggregation process is characteristic of amyloidogenesis, resulting in a structure rich in beta-sheets.\n\nTo characterize this structural transition, the biochemist prepares two samples:\n- **Sample A**: Contains Labyrinthin in its native, soluble, alpha-helical state.\n- **Sample B**: Contains Labyrinthin that has been treated with the stressor, now existing as insoluble, beta-sheet-rich aggregates.\n\nThe scientist uses Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to analyze the secondary structure of the protein in both samples. CD spectroscopy measures the differential absorption of polarized light, and the resulting spectrum of mean residue ellipticity, $[\\theta]$, versus wavelength is highly indicative of protein secondary structure.
