This practice explores the critical role of second messengers like cyclic AMP ($cAMP$) by examining a familiar scenario: the effect of caffeine.

[@problem_id:2050636]", "problem": "A student, preparing for a final exam, has been studying for hours and has skipped a meal. This fasting state leads to a decrease in their blood glucose levels, triggering the release of the hormone glucagon. Glucagon acts on hepatocytes (liver cells) to counteract the drop in blood glucose. The student consumes a cup of coffee, which contains caffeine, a well-known inhibitor of the enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE).\n\nThe signaling pathway initiated by glucagon in hepatocytes involves the binding of glucagon to its cell surface receptor, which activates adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). The primary effect of cAMP is the activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA, in turn, regulates the key enzymes of glycogen metabolism—glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase—through phosphorylation.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence of caffeine's inhibition of PDE on the activity of these two enzymes in the student's liver cells?\n\nA. It leads to a decrease in the activity of both glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase.\n\nB. It leads to an increase in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase and a decrease in the activity of glycogen synthase.\n\nC. It leads to an increase in the activity of both glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase.\n\nD. It leads to a decrease in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase and an increase in the activity of glycogen synthase.\n\nE. It has no effect on these enzymes, as the primary effect of glucagon has already occurred.", "solution": "Glucagon binding to its hepatocyte receptor engages a heterotrimeric $G_{s}$ protein, which activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the formation of cyclic AMP from ATP, represented schematically as $ATP \\to \\mathrm{cAMP}$. The second messenger $\\mathrm{cAMP}$ activates protein kinase A (PKA) by binding to PKA regulatory subunits to release active catalytic subunits; thus PKA activity increases with $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$.\n\nUnder basal signaling, the intracellular level of $\\mathrm{cAMP}$ is set by its rate of synthesis by adenylyl cyclase and its rate of degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE), which catalyzes $\\mathrm{cAMP} \\to \\mathrm{AMP}$. This balance can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{cAMP}]}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{AC}} - v_{\\mathrm{PDE}},\n$$\nwhere $v_{\\mathrm{AC}}$ is the rate of adenylyl cyclase and $v_{\\mathrm{PDE}}$ is the rate of PDE. Caffeine inhibits PDE; inhibition reduces $v_{\\mathrm{PDE}}$, thereby increasing $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{cAMP}]}{dt}$ above zero until a higher steady-state $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ is reached. Consequently, PKA activity increases further or is prolonged.\n\nPKA then phosphorylates key enzymes of glycogen metabolism:\n- PKA phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase to its active form, which in turn phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase (converting the less active b form to the active a form), thereby increasing glycogen phosphorylase activity and promoting glycogenolysis.\n- PKA phosphorylates glycogen synthase, converting it from a more active to a less active form, thereby decreasing glycogen synthase activity and inhibiting glycogen synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence of PDE inhibition by caffeine in the presence of glucagon signaling is an increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity and a decrease in glycogen synthase activity. This corresponds to option B, and rules out options A, C, D, and E (E is incorrect because inhibition of PDE modulates the ongoing signal by elevating or prolonging $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ and PKA activity).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2050636"}, {"introduction": "A powerful way to understand any biological pathway is to analyze what happens when a crucial link is broken. This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario involving a non-functional Protein Kinase A ($PKA$) to test your understanding of its indispensable role in the glucagon signaling cascade. By predicting the metabolic state of a cell where $PKA$ cannot be activated, you will reinforce the specific sequence of events that connects the rise in $cAMP$ to the phosphorylation of downstream metabolic enzymes. [@problem_id:2050603]", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a genetically engineered hepatocyte (liver cell) line. This specific cell line expresses a mutant form of Protein Kinase A (PKA), an enzyme crucial for metabolic regulation. In this mutant version, the regulatory subunits have a structural defect that prevents them from binding to their allosteric activator, cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). However, these mutant regulatory subunits can still bind perfectly to the catalytic subunits, keeping them in an inhibited state.\n\nThe researchers first culture these cells in a medium rich with glucose to ensure their glycogen stores are full. They then switch the cells to a glucose-free medium that contains a physiological concentration of the hormone glucagon. After a sufficient incubation period to allow for a hormonal response, which of the following statements most accurately describes the metabolic state of glycogen regulation within these mutant hepatocytes?\n\nA. The rate of glycogenolysis will be significantly increased compared to its basal rate before glucagon addition.\n\nB. The enzyme glycogen phosphorylase will be predominantly in its active, phosphorylated form (phosphorylase *a*).\n\nC.

Active PKA phosphorylates multiple targets relevant to glycogen metabolism:\n- PKA phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase kinase, which in turn phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase $b$ to glycogen phosphorylase $a$ (the active, phosphorylated form), thereby increasing glycogenolysis.\n- PKA phosphorylates glycogen synthase, converting active synthase $a$ to inactive synthase $b$, thereby decreasing glycogen synthesis.\n- PKA phosphorylates inhibitor-1, which inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), reducing dephosphorylation of phosphorylase and synthase and thus reinforcing the phosphorylated state.\n\nIn the described mutant hepatocytes, the regulatory subunits of PKA cannot bind cAMP but still bind and inhibit the catalytic subunits. Therefore:\n1) Glucagon will still activate Gs and adenylate cyclase, so intracellular cAMP will rise normally; the mutation is downstream of cAMP generation and does not prevent its accumulation. Hence, cAMP will not remain low.\n2) Because the regulatory subunits cannot bind cAMP, the catalytic subunits of PKA will not be released and will remain inactive. Consequently, PKA-dependent phosphorylation cascades will not occur.\n3) Without PKA activity, phosphorylase kinase is not activated, so glycogen phosphorylase will not be driven into the phosphorylated active form (phosphorylase $a$). Instead, PP1 activity is unopposed by PKA (because inhibitor-1 is not phosphorylated), favoring dephosphorylation and thus the less active glycogen phosphorylase $b$.\n4) Similarly, without PKA to phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase, PP1 activity will favor the dephosphorylated, active form, synthase $a$.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A is false: glycogenolysis will not be significantly increased because PKA is inactive.\n- B is false: glycogen phosphorylase will not be predominantly in the active phosphorylated form $a$.\n- C is false: cAMP will rise with glucagon; it will not remain low.\n- D is true: glycogen synthase will be predominantly in its active, dephosphorylated form (synthase $a$).\n- E is false: PKA catalytic subunits remain bound to regulatory subunits and inactive because cAMP cannot bind the regulatory subunits.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2050603"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the complex signaling cascades initiated by glucagon and epinephrine serve a vital physiological purpose: managing the body's fuel supply.

This process releases glycerol and fatty acids into the bloodstream.

Calculate the net energetic cost, in ATP equivalents, for this cell to synthesize a single molecule of glucose from these two glycerol molecules.\n\nFor your calculation, use the following standard energy equivalences:\n- 1 molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is energetically equivalent to 1 molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n- The complete oxidation of one molecule of the reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) in the cytosol is assumed to yield 2.5 ATP equivalents.\n\nExpress your answer as a single integer.

Subsequent hydrolytic steps by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase remove phosphate groups to form glucose.
