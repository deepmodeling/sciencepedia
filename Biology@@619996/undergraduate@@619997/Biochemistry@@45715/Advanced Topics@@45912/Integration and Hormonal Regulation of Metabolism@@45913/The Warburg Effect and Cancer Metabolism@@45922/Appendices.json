[@problem_id:2085482]", "problem": "In advanced stages of cancer, many patients experience a metabolic syndrome known as cancer cachexia, characterized by systemic inflammation, loss of body mass, and a negative energy balance. A key contributor to this energy drain is a metabolic interplay between the tumor and the host's liver, which is a macroscopic manifestation of the Warburg effect.\n\nConsider a simplified model of this process. A tumor cell, relying heavily on anaerobic glycolysis, takes up one mole of glucose from the host's bloodstream and converts it into two moles of lactate. This lactate is then released back into the bloodstream and transported to the liver. In the liver, the two moles of lactate are used to resynthesize one mole of glucose via gluconeogenesis. This newly synthesized glucose is then released back into the bloodstream, potentially to be taken up again by the tumor, completing a futile cycle from the perspective of the host organism.\n\nBased on the established stoichiometry of these pathways:\n- The anaerobic conversion of one mole of glucose to two moles of lactate yields a net of two moles of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n- The synthesis of one mole of glucose from two moles of lactate consumes a total of six moles of ATP.\n\nCalculate the net energetic cost, in moles of ATP, to the host organism for each mole of glucose that completes this metabolic cycle. Provide your answer as a single integer.", "solution": "The cycle consists of two coupled processes with established stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, in the tumor, one mole of glucose undergoes anaerobic glycolysis to yield two moles of lactate and a net production of ATP:\n$\\text{glucose} \\to 2\\,\\text{lactate}, \\quad \\Delta n_{\\text{ATP,tumor}}=+2 \\text{ mol ATP per mol glucose}.$\n\nSecond, in the liver, two moles of lactate are converted back to one mole of glucose via gluconeogenesis at an ATP cost:\n$2\\,\\text{lactate} \\to \\text{glucose}, \\quad \\Delta n_{\\text{ATP,liver}}=-6 \\text{ mol ATP per mol glucose synthesized}.$\n\nFor one mole of glucose completing the full cycle, the net ATP change for the host organism is the sum of these contributions:\n$\\Delta n_{\\text{ATP,host}}=\\Delta n_{\\text{ATP,tumor}}+\\Delta n_{\\text{ATP,liver}}=2-6=-4.$\n\nInterpreting a negative net as an energetic cost to the host, the magnitude of the ATP drain is $4$ moles of ATP per mole of glucose cycled.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2085482"}, {"introduction": "Observing the Warburg effect in the lab requires quantitative methods to characterize a cell's metabolic phenotype. This problem guides you through the process of interpreting metabolic flux data, a common technique in cell biology research. Using fundamental principles of carbon conservation, you will calculate the fraction of consumed glucose that is secreted as lactate, providing a direct, quantitative measure of aerobic glycolysis.

At steady state, bulk extracellular measurements show a glucose uptake rate of $10$ nmol glucose per minute per $10^6$ cells and a lactate secretion rate of $18$ nmol lactate per minute per $10^6$ cells. Assume the following foundational biochemical facts: (i) one molecule of glucose contains $6$ carbon atoms, (ii) one molecule of lactate contains $3$ carbon atoms, (iii) in glycolysis, one molecule of glucose can be converted to at most two molecules of lactate with conservation of carbon atoms, and (iv) during the measurement interval there is negligible consumption of secreted lactate and negligible contributions from other extracellular carbon sources. Define the fraction $f$ of glucose-derived carbon that is excreted as lactate as the ratio of the total carbon-atom flux out of the cell as lactate to the total carbon-atom flux into the cell as glucose. Using only carbon conservation and the measured fluxes, compute $f$ and express it as a decimal number with no units. Then, based on first principles, briefly infer in your reasoning whether the data are consistent with aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) under normoxia. The final reported answer must be only the numerical value of $f$.", "solution": "We begin from carbon conservation and the stoichiometry of glycolysis. Each molecule of glucose has $6$ carbon atoms, and each molecule of lactate has $3$ carbon atoms.

This practice explores the concept of metabolic plasticity, a key mechanism by which cancer cells can develop resistance to drugs that inhibit their primary metabolic pathways. You will analyze how a hypothetical cancer cell might reprogram its fuel usage from glucose to fatty acids and glutamine to survive and continue to proliferate. [@problem_id:2085457]", "problem": "A particular cancer cell line, designated OncoCell-S, exhibits a strong Warburg effect, characterized by a high rate of aerobic glycolysis. These cells take up glucose at a constant rate of $R_{gluc}$. Under aerobic conditions, 85% of the consumed glucose is converted to lactate, while the remaining 15% is fully catabolized via the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle for maximal energy production.\n\nTo target this metabolic vulnerability, the cells are treated with a potent pharmacological inhibitor that completely blocks the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), thereby shutting down glycolysis entirely. A resistant variant, OncoCell-R, emerges that can proliferate in the presence of the inhibitor. This resistant line has reprogrammed its metabolism to rely exclusively on the catabolism of the fatty acid palmitate (C16:0) and the amino acid glutamine to fuel its TCA cycle.\n\nTo maintain cellular function, the OncoCell-R line adjusts its consumption rates of palmitate ($R_{palm}$) and glutamine ($R_{gln}$) to meet two conditions:\n1. The total rate of Acetyl-CoA production for the TCA cycle must be identical to the rate of Acetyl-CoA production that was being supplied by glucose in the original OncoCell-S line.\n2. The rate of Acetyl-CoA molecules produced from palmitate catabolism is precisely double the rate of Acetyl-CoA molecules produced from glutamine catabolism.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, use the following stoichiometric conversions:\n- The complete catabolism of one molecule of glucose that enters the oxidative pathway yields two molecules of Acetyl-CoA.\n- The beta-oxidation of one molecule of palmitate yields eight molecules of Acetyl-CoA.\n- The catabolism of one molecule of glutamine is assumed to yield one molecule of Acetyl-CoA.\n\nCalculate the required ratio of the rate of palmitate consumption to the rate of glutamine consumption, $\\frac{R_{palm}}{R_{gln}}$, in the drug-resistant OncoCell-R line.", "solution": "Let the glucose uptake rate in OncoCell-S be $R_{gluc}$.

Writing these as exact fractions, $0.85=\\frac{17}{20}$ and $0.15=\\frac{3}{20}$. Only the oxidative fraction produces Acetyl-CoA.
