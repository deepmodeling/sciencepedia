Amino acid analysis reveals that the single polypeptide chain of Cryoprotectin is composed of 94 amino acid residues. Further analysis shows it contains 5 lysine (Lys) residues and 3 arginine (Arg) residues. The C-terminal amino acid of the intact Cryoprotectin polypeptide is known to be an arginine residue.\n\nThe biochemist subjects a sample of Cryoprotectin to complete enzymatic digestion with trypsin. Trypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysine and arginine residues. Assume that no proline residues are present in positions that would inhibit cleavage.\n\nHow many peptide fragments will be generated from the complete trypsin digestion of one molecule of Cryoprotectin?", "solution": "Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysine and arginine residues, unless the next residue is proline; here, no inhibitory proline positions are present. Let $n_{K}$ be the number of lysine residues and $n_{R}$ be the number of arginine residues. Each internal $K$ or $R$ provides one cleavage site. A $K$ or $R$ at the C-terminus does not provide a cleavage site because there is no peptide bond after the terminal residue.\n\nStart with a single intact polypeptide chain; each cleavage increases the number of fragments by one. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{\\text{fragments}}=\\left(\\text{number of internal cleavage sites}\\right)+1.\n$$\nThe number of internal cleavage sites equals the total number of $K$ and $R$ residues minus any $K$ or $R$ at the C-terminus.

This practice problem [@problem_id:2066972] delves into a common real-world scenario where the sequencing reaction fails to start. By diagnosing the potential cause, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the chemistry of the Edman cycle and how post-translational modifications can render a protein resistant to this classic sequencing method.", "problem": "A researcher is studying 'Cryofungin', a short peptide isolated from an Antarctic fungus that confers frost resistance. To determine its primary sequence, the researcher employs automated Edman degradation. This technique sequentially removes N-terminal amino acid residues by first reacting the free $\\alpha$-amino group with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) under mildly alkaline conditions, and then cleaving the derivatized residue with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The released residue is then identified as a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid derivative.\n\nDespite verifying that the sequencing instrument is functioning correctly with a standard control peptide, the analysis of Cryofungin yields no PTH-amino acid derivative, even in the first cycle. This suggests that the N-terminus of the peptide is inaccessible to the PITC reagent. Which of the following post-translational modifications is the most likely reason for the failure of the Edman degradation procedure?\n\nA. The presence of an internal disulfide bond between two cysteine residues.\n\nB. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue's hydroxyl group.\n\nC. Amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl group.\n\nD.

Subsequent acid treatment (e.g., with trifluoroacetic acid) cleaves the N-terminal residue, which is then identified as a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid. If no PTH–amino acid is detected even in the first cycle, the most direct inference is that the N-terminal $\\alpha$-amino group is not accessible or is chemically blocked, preventing the initial PITC reaction.\n\nEvaluate each option with this requirement:\n\nA. An internal disulfide bond between cysteine residues affects the tertiary structure or stabilization but does not modify the N-terminus. It does not prevent the N-terminal $\\alpha$-amino group from reacting with PITC, so it is not a cause of failure at the first cycle.\n\nB. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine hydroxyl group is a side-chain modification that does not involve the N-terminal $\\alpha$-amino group. It would not block the initial PITC reaction.\n\nC. Amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl group modifies the C-terminus, not the N-terminus. Edman degradation proceeds from the N-terminus, so this would not prevent the first cycle.\n\nD. Acetylation of the N-terminal $\\alpha$-amino group converts the free amine into a neutral amide, eliminating the nucleophilic free $\\alpha$-amino functionality required to form the phenylthiocarbamoyl intermediate with PITC. This directly blocks the first step of Edman degradation and yields no PTH–amino acid in cycle one, matching the observation.\n\nE. Glycosylation of an asparagine side-chain amide (N-linked glycosylation) is a side-chain modification and does not alter the N-terminal $\\alpha$-amino group. It would not inherently prevent the initial PITC reaction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of failure is a blocked N-terminus due to N-terminal acetylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2066972"}, {"introduction": "Protein sequencing data is not always straightforward and can hold clues about a protein's higher-order structure. This problem [@problem_id:2066924] presents an intriguing experimental result: the detection of two different amino acids at each cycle of Edman degradation. Analyzing this outcome will challenge you to think beyond a single polypeptide chain and consider how the quaternary structure of a protein, such as a heterodimer, influences sequencing results.", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing a novel protein complex isolated from a deep-sea vent bacterium. The purification protocol, involving affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography, yields a sample that appears to be a highly purified, single molecular entity. To determine its primary structure, the biochemist subjects the protein to Edman degradation.\n\nThe process begins by reacting the protein with Phenylisothiocyanate (PITC). In the first cycle of degradation, analysis of the resulting Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives by high-performance liquid chromatography reveals the presence of approximately equal molar amounts of PTH-Leucine and PTH-Glycine. In the second cycle, approximately equal molar amounts of PTH-Alanine and PTH-Isoleucine are detected. This pattern, where two distinct PTH-amino acids are identified in a roughly 1:1 ratio, persists through several more cycles of the degradation process.\n\nAssuming the Edman degradation chemistry is proceeding correctly and the protein was not denatured into subunits before the analysis, which of the following statements provides the most plausible interpretation of these experimental results?\n\nA. The protein is a homodimer, composed of two identical polypeptide chains, but one of the chains has its N-terminus blocked by a post-translational modification.\n\nB. The Edman degradation reaction was inefficient, leading to incomplete cleavage in each cycle and causing a carry-over signal from the previous amino acid.\n\nC. The protein has a single polypeptide chain that contains a highly repetitive internal amino acid sequence.\n\nD. The protein is a non-covalent heterodimer, meaning it is a single functional complex composed of two different polypeptide chains.\n\nE. The protein preparation is an equimolar mixture of two entirely separate and unrelated monomeric proteins that coincidentally co-purified.", "solution": "Edman degradation removes and identifies the N-terminal residue of a polypeptide in successive cycles by forming and analyzing phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives. If a sample contains a single polypeptide species with one free N-terminus, each cycle yields a single PTH-amino acid corresponding to that position in the sequence.\n\nObservation: In cycle 1, approximately equal molar amounts of two distinct PTH-amino acids (PTH-Leucine and PTH-Glycine) are detected. In cycle 2, again two different PTH-amino acids (PTH-Alanine and PTH-Isoleucine) appear in roughly a 1:1 ratio, and this persists over several cycles. This pattern indicates that two N-termini are being sequenced in parallel in equal stoichiometry, with each cycle advancing both sequences by one residue and yielding two distinct residues per cycle.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A (homodimer with one N-terminus blocked): A homodimer has identical chains. If one N-terminus were blocked, only the unblocked chain would be sequenced, giving a single PTH-amino acid per cycle (at roughly half the expected total signal), not two different amino acids in 1:1 ratio. Thus A is inconsistent.\n- B (inefficient Edman causing carry-over): Incomplete cleavage leads to carry-over of previous residues, typically causing the previous cycle’s amino acid to reappear in subsequent cycles at reduced amounts. The observed pattern shows two different amino acids per cycle that change from cycle to cycle without repetition of the previous residues and stay at approximately equal molar amounts, which is not characteristic of carry-over. Thus B is inconsistent.\n- C (single chain with repetitive internal sequence): A single chain has only one N-terminus; Edman yields one PTH-amino acid per cycle regardless of internal repeats. Two distinct residues in each cycle cannot arise from one N-terminus. Thus C is inconsistent.\n- D (non-covalent heterodimer of two different polypeptides): A heterodimer presents two different N-termini in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Edman degradation on the intact complex would sequence both chains simultaneously, producing two distinct PTH-amino acids per cycle in approximately equal amounts, with each pair advancing in tandem across cycles. This matches the observation. The note that the protein was not denatured into subunits supports that both chains remained associated but still accessible to Edman chemistry.\n- E (equimolar mixture of two unrelated monomeric proteins): This could also produce two sequences in a 1:1 ratio. However, the purification yielded what appeared to be a single molecular entity after size-exclusion chromatography, arguing against an accidental equimolar co-purification of unrelated monomers. The consistent 1:1 ratio across cycles and the stated assumption of correct chemistry favor a defined complex with fixed stoichiometry over a coincidental mixture.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible interpretation is that the sample is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of two different polypeptide chains being sequenced in parallel, consistent with option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2066924"}]}
