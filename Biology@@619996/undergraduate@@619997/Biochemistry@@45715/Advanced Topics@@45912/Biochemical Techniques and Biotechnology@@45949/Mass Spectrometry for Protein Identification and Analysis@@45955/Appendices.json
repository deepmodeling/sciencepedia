A key step in this process is to compare experimentally measured masses with theoretically calculated masses of potential peptide sequences.\n\nImagine you are analyzing a protein digest and have identified a potential tetrapeptide with the sequence Ser-Thr-Tyr-Arg (STYR). Further experimental evidence strongly suggests that the serine (S) residue has undergone phosphorylation, a common Post-Translational Modification (PTM).\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, you must calculate the theoretical monoisotopic mass of this modified peptide. The monoisotopic mass is calculated using the masses of the most abundant naturally occurring stable isotopes of each element.\n\nYou are provided with the following data:\n1.
