The gene's DNA sequence is provided below, with the top strand being the coding strand. The gene contains two exons and one intron. The first exon spans from nucleotide position 1 to 30, and the second exon begins at nucleotide position 61.\n\n5'- AATTGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGATTACAGATTACAGATTACAGGCTATAGCTAGCTAGCTA -3'\n3'- TTAACCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCCATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACCTAATGTCTAATGTCTAATGTCCTGATATCGATCGATCGAT -5'\n\nTo disrupt this gene, the biologist plans to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). This system employs a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific location in the genome. The targeting specificity is determined by two factors: a 20-nucleotide sequence within the sgRNA and a DNA motif called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nThe rules for SpCas9 targeting are as follows:\n1.  The Cas9 enzyme first recognizes the PAM sequence on the DNA. For SpCas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases (A, T, C, G).\n2.  The PAM sequence must be present on the non-template strand (the strand that is not used as a template for gRNA binding).\n3.  The 20-nucleotide target site, known as the protospacer, is the sequence on the non-template strand located immediately upstream (to the 5' side) of the PAM sequence.\n4.  The 20-nucleotide guide portion of the sgRNA must have a sequence that is complementary to the template strand at the target site. This is equivalent to saying the sgRNA sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence, with all instances of Thymine (T) replaced by Uracil (U).\n\nYour task is to design a 20-nucleotide sgRNA sequence that will direct the Cas9 nuclease to cut as close as possible to the beginning of the second exon.\n\nProvide the sequence of this 20-nucleotide guide RNA in the 5' to 3' orientation.", "solution": "We are given that the top strand is the coding strand and that exon 2 begins at nucleotide position 61. For SpCas9, the targeting rules to apply are:\n- The PAM must be 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand.\n- The 20-nt protospacer is immediately upstream (5' side) of the PAM on the same non-template strand.\n- The sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence with all T replaced by U (RNA), and is written 5' to 3'.\n\nIndex the provided top-strand sequence and mark the exon boundary at position 61. The intron spans positions 31 to 60, so the second exon begins at position 61. We search for the nearest PAM 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand as close as possible to position 61. Taking the top strand as the non-template strand for a potential target, scan for NGG near position 61. In the second exon region, the first occurrence of NGG on the top strand is at positions 81–83, which is 5'-AGG-3'.\n\nBy rule, the corresponding 20-nt protospacer on the non-template (top) strand is the sequence immediately upstream of that PAM, i.e., positions 61 through 80 inclusive. Reading the top strand from position 61 to 80 gives the 20-nt protospacer:\nGATTACAGATTACAGATTAC.\n\nThis site places the protospacer starting exactly at the beginning of exon 2 (position 61), and the PAM-adjacent cut by SpCas9 would occur upstream of the PAM, keeping the cleavage close to the exon start. Checking the opposite orientation (PAM on the bottom strand), which would require a 5'-CCN-3' motif on the top strand near position 61, reveals no CCN motif close enough to yield a cut closer to position 61 than the top-strand PAM at 81–83. Therefore, the top-strand PAM at 81–83 provides the closest feasible cut to the beginning of exon 2.\n\nThe sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer with T replaced by U, written 5' to 3'.

By understanding how these molecular changes affect the size of a PCR product, you will learn to interpret gel electrophoresis data to screen for successful genome editing events.", "problem": "A researcher is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to create a knockout of a specific gene in a mammalian cell line. The strategy relies on the Cas9 nuclease to create a double-strand break at a target site within an exon. This break is subsequently repaired by the cell's Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway, an error-prone process that frequently introduces small insertions or deletions of nucleotides, collectively known as indels. These indels can cause a frameshift mutation, leading to a non-functional protein.\n\nTo screen for successful editing, the researcher designs a pair of primers for a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that flank the CRISPR target site. Amplification of the unedited, wild-type DNA sequence with these primers yields a PCR product of 310 base pairs (bp).\n\nAfter transfecting the cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 components, the researcher isolates a mixed population of cells. A portion of these cells remains unedited, while others have undergone repair via NHEJ. DNA analysis of the edited cells reveals two predominant types of mutations at the target locus:\n1.  A net deletion of 13 base pairs.\n2.  A net insertion of 5 base pairs.\n\nThe researcher then extracts genomic DNA from the entire mixed cell population (containing unedited, deletion-mutant, and insertion-mutant cells) and performs PCR using the aforementioned primers.

This problem [@problem_id:2038181] examines why a target site might be inaccessible to the Cas9 machinery, even if all sequence requirements are met. By considering the physical state of DNA packaging into chromatin, you will develop a more sophisticated understanding of the limitations of genome editing and the importance of target site accessibility.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to create a targeted mutation in a human cell line. The system utilizes the Cas9 nuclease and a synthesized single guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA is designed to be a perfect 20-nucleotide complement to a specific target sequence in the genome. The target DNA sequence is immediately followed by a 5'-NGG-3' Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), which is required for recognition by the *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9 protein being used.\n\nDespite multiple attempts and confirming the integrity of the delivered Cas9 protein and gRNA, the researchers observe no editing at the target locus. Further analysis using chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that the target DNA sequence is located within a region of densely packed heterochromatin, characterized by hypoacetylated histones and high levels of H3K9 trimethylation. In contrast, control experiments targeting a gene in a region of loosely packed euchromatin with a different gRNA are successful.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct biochemical explanation for the failure of the CRISPR-Cas9 system at the heterochromatin locus?\n\nA. The dense, compact structure of heterochromatin sterically hinders the large Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex from physically accessing and binding to its target DNA sequence.\n\nB.

The DNA in heterochromatin is predominantly in a single-stranded conformation, which cannot be recognized by the Cas9-gRNA complex that targets double-stranded DNA.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct biochemical reason why a perfectly designed CRISPR-Cas9 system fails to edit a target site located within a heterochromatin region. To solve this, we must understand the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 and the fundamental difference between heterochromatin and euchromatin.\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system works when the Cas9 protein, in a complex with a guide RNA (gRNA), scans the genome for a specific target sequence. This Cas9-gRNA complex is a large ribonucleoprotein. For it to function, it must first physically locate and bind to a short DNA sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). Upon binding the PAM, the Cas9 enzyme attempts to unwind the adjacent DNA double helix and match it with the sequence of the gRNA. If a match is found, Cas9 cleaves the DNA.\n\nThe key information provided is that the failed target site is in heterochromatin. Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into a structure called chromatin. Chromatin exists in two main states:\n1.  **Euchromatin**: This is a loosely packed form of chromatin that is rich in genes and is often under active transcription. The DNA is accessible to transcription factors, polymerases, and other DNA-binding proteins.\n2.  **Heterochromatin**: This is a tightly packed, condensed form of chromatin. It is generally transcriptionally inactive. The DNA is wound tightly around histone proteins, which are then further compacted into higher-order structures. This dense packaging serves to silence genes and maintain genomic stability.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these principles:\n\n**A. The dense, compact structure of heterochromatin sterically hinders the large Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex from physically accessing and binding to its target DNA sequence.**\nThis statement is the correct explanation. The Cas9-gRNA complex is a large molecular machine. Heterochromatin is, by definition, structurally dense and inaccessible. The DNA is so tightly wrapped and compacted that there is no physical space for the large Cas9 complex to diffuse into the structure, find its PAM sequence, and bind to the target DNA. This physical barrier, or steric hindrance, is the primary and most direct reason for the failure of genome editing in such regions. This is a well-documented challenge in the field of CRISPR-based therapeutics.\n\n**B. The gRNA molecule is chemically modified and inactivated by histone-modifying enzymes that are exclusively active within heterochromatin regions.**\nHistone-modifying enzymes (like histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases, methyltransferases, etc.) act on histone proteins, not on free RNA molecules like the gRNA. While there are RNA-modifying enzymes in the cell, there is no known mechanism by which histone-modifying enzymes would target and inactivate a gRNA. This statement misattributes the function of histone-modifying enzymes.\n\n**C. The high concentration of positive charges from histone proteins in heterochromatin electrostatically repels the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the gRNA, preventing it from approaching the DNA.**\nHistone proteins are rich in positively charged amino acids (lysine, arginine) which allow them to bind tightly to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. The gRNA is also negatively charged. However, the gRNA is part of the Cas9-gRNA complex. The primary interaction is between the entire complex and the chromatin structure. While electrostatic interactions are fundamental to chromatin structure itself, the argument that repulsion of the gRNA *alone* is the primary barrier is incorrect. The dominant effect is the overall physical inaccessibility of the entire DNA target, not a specific repulsion of the gRNA component. The Cas9 protein itself mediates the interaction with DNA.\n\n**D. The unique protein composition of heterochromatin alters the local pH to a level that is outside the optimal functional range of the Cas9 nuclease, causing the enzyme to misfold.**\nThe nucleus is a highly buffered environment, and significant, stable local pH gradients of the magnitude required to denature a protein like Cas9 do not exist within different chromatin domains. While the concentration of proteins and ions may vary slightly, it is not the mechanism of gene silencing in heterochromatin, nor is it a plausible reason for Cas9 failure.\n\n**E. The DNA in heterochromatin is predominantly in a single-stranded conformation, which cannot be recognized by the Cas9-gRNA complex that targets double-stranded DNA.**\nThis is factually incorrect. DNA in the cell, whether in euchromatin or heterochromatin, exists predominantly as a double-stranded helix. The process of transcription or replication involves local, transient unwinding, but the resting state of genomic DNA is double-stranded. The Cas9 system specifically functions by first recognizing a PAM in double-stranded DNA and then initiating the unwinding itself.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is the physical inaccessibility of the target site due to the compact nature of heterochromatin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2038181"}]}
