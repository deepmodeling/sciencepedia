Based on this resolution, which of the following descriptions best represents the level of structural detail that the scientists can reliably determine from their data?\n\nA. The precise positions of all individual atoms in the protein, including hydrogen atoms.\nB. The conformation of most amino acid side chains and the locations of ordered water molecules.\nC. The overall fold of the protein and the path of its polypeptide backbone.\nD. The exact covalent bond lengths and bond angles within the amino acid residues.\nE. The identity of individual metal ions chelated by the enzyme's active site.", "solution": "X-ray crystallographic resolution indicates the smallest interplanar spacing distinguished in the electron density; lower numerical values correspond to higher detail. Typical interpretability thresholds are:\n- Around 1.0–1.2 angstroms: individual atoms, including many hydrogen atoms, can be visualized; precise bond lengths and angles can be refined anisotropically.\n- Around 1.5–2.5 angstroms: most side chains are well resolved; ordered water molecules are visible; hydrogen atoms are generally not seen by X-ray.\n- Around 3.0–3.5 angstroms: main-chain trace is reliable; some large or constrained side chains can be placed, but many rotamers remain ambiguous; waters are generally not reliable.\n- Around 4.0 angstroms and worse: electron density supports the overall fold, secondary structure elements (alpha helices as rods and beta sheets as sheets), and a backbone trace, but side-chain conformations are poorly defined and solvent/precise geometry are not reliably determined.\n\nEvaluate each option at 4.0 angstroms:\n- A: Precise positions of all atoms including hydrogen atoms require near-atomic resolution around 1.0 angstrom; false.\n- B: Conformations of most side chains and ordered waters require about 2.0–2.5 angstroms or better; false.\n- C: Overall fold and backbone path are accessible at about 3.5–4.0 angstroms; true.\n- D: Exact bond lengths and angles require very high resolution near 1.2 angstroms; false.\n- E: Identity of a metal ion could sometimes be inferred using anomalous scattering or coordination chemistry, but at 4.0 angstroms the density alone is insufficient for reliable identification; not the best description based solely on resolution.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is the overall fold and backbone trace.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2087789"}, {"introduction": "NMR spectroscopy builds a molecular structure atom by atom through a process called resonance assignment. This practice tackles a common hurdle: severely overlapped signals in a standard two-dimensional spectrum that prevent unambiguous identification [@problem_id:2087750]. You will see how adding a third dimension of information, in this case based on $^{13}C$ chemical shifts, can decisively resolve this ambiguity, demonstrating a core strategy used to map out a protein's entire polypeptide chain.", "problem": "A structural biologist is using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of a small, $^{15}N$- and $^{13}C$-labeled protein. The first step in this process is to achieve sequence-specific resonance assignment, which involves linking the observed NMR signals to specific amino acids in the protein's primary sequence.\n\nThe biologist first records a two-dimensional $^{1}H-^{15}N$ Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum. In this spectrum, each non-proline amino acid residue should give rise to a single cross-peak corresponding to its backbone amide group. However, in a crowded central region of the spectrum, two distinct amide signals, designated Peak 1 and Peak 2, are found to be severely overlapped, preventing their unambiguous assignment.\n\nThe 2D coordinates ($^{1}H_N$ chemical shift, $^{15}N_H$ chemical shift) for these peaks are:\n- Peak 1: (8.31 ppm, 118.5 ppm)\n- Peak 2: (8.32 ppm, 118.6 ppm)\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, a three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH experiment is performed. This experiment correlates the amide $^{1}H$ and $^{15}N$ chemical shifts of a given residue (residue `i`) with the $^{13}C$ chemical shifts of the alpha-carbon ($C_\\alpha$) and beta-carbon ($C_\\beta$) of the *preceding* residue in the sequence (residue `i-1`).\n\nThe 3D experiment yields the following $C_\\alpha$ and $C_\\beta$ chemical shifts for the residue preceding the amide group of each peak:\n- For the amide group of Peak 1: The preceding residue shows $^{13}C$ shifts at 58.1 ppm and 64.2 ppm.\n- For the amide group of Peak 2: The preceding residue shows $^{13}C$ shifts at 53.0 ppm and 19.3 ppm.\n\nBelow is a table of characteristic backbone $C_\\alpha$ and $C_\\beta$ chemical shifts for several amino acid types.\n\n| Amino Acid | Characteristic $C_\\alpha$ Shift (ppm) | Characteristic $C_\\beta$ Shift (ppm) |\n|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Alanine    | 53                                    | 19                                    |\n| Serine     | 58                                    | 64                                    |\n| Valine     | 62                                    | 33                                    |\n| Threonine  | 62                                    | 70                                    |\n\nBased on the provided 3D NMR data, what is the identity of the amino acid residue that immediately precedes the residue corresponding to Peak 2?\n\nA.

The relevant principle is that CBCA(CO)NH correlates the amide of residue $i$ to the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ and $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\beta}$ chemical shifts of the preceding residue $i-1$. Thus, for each amide peak, the two observed $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ shifts correspond to $\\delta(\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha})$ and $\\delta(\\mathrm{C}_{\\beta})$ of residue $i-1$.\n\nFor Peak 2, the preceding residue shows $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ shifts at $53.0\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $19.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.

All available biophysical data from solution-based experiments, including size-exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering, consistently show that Regulin exists as a stable 25 kDa monomer. However, a high-resolution crystal structure obtained via X-ray crystallography reveals two molecules of Regulin in the asymmetric unit, forming a tightly packed dimer. To determine if this dimer is a biologically meaningful assembly or merely a non-physiological artifact of crystal packing (a \"crystal contact\"), a series of computational analyses are performed on the dimer interface.\n\nWhich one of the following hypothetical findings from the computational analysis provides the strongest evidence that the observed dimer is a non-physiological crystal contact?\n\nA.

The total solvent-accessible surface area buried upon dimer formation is calculated to be 1850 Å².\nC.

The central physical principle is thermodynamic stability of association in solution: a biologically relevant dimer must have a favorable interaction free energy upon association. If the interaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, the interface will not be populated in solution and is likely a crystal packing artifact.\n\nThe relevant thermodynamic condition is that the standard free energy of binding must be negative for spontaneous association in solution. Writing the binding free energy as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{bind}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{bind}},\n$$\na biologically relevant interface satisfies $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}<0$. Computational interface assessment tools often report an interface solvation free energy gain, commonly denoted $\\Delta G^{\\text{int}}$, where a negative value indicates a favorable stabilization upon interface formation and a positive value indicates unfavorable energetics.\n\nEvaluate each option against this criterion and other well-established heuristics for biological versus crystal contacts:\n- Option A: Two-fold rotational symmetry is common in physiological homodimers. Symmetry alone does not diagnose a crystal contact; thus it is not strong evidence for an artifact.\n- Option B: A buried solvent-accessible surface area near $1850 \\text{ \\AA}^{2}$ lies within the range often seen for physiological interfaces (typically exceeding $10^{3} \\text{ \\AA}^{2}$). Crystal contacts are frequently smaller. This is not strong evidence for a non-physiological contact.\n- Option C: The presence of multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges generally supports interface specificity and stability; it does not provide strong evidence for an artifact.\n- Option D: High conservation of interface residues across orthologs implies evolutionary selection for that interface, supporting biological relevance rather than a crystal artifact.\n- Option E: A calculated interface solvation free energy gain $\\Delta G^{\\text{int}}=+3.1 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$ is positive, i.e., unfavorable. This directly indicates that forming the interface is not thermodynamically favorable in solution. Therefore, this provides strong evidence that the observed dimer is a non-physiological crystal contact.\n\nBy the thermodynamic criterion $\\Delta G^{\\text{int}}>0 \\implies$ unfavorable association in solution, Option E provides the strongest evidence that the dimer is a crystal packing artifact, consistent with the solution biophysical data indicating a monomeric 25 kDa species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2087788"}]}
