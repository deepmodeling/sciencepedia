The isoelectric point (pI) of FumC is 5.7.

The pI is the pH at which the protein has a net charge of zero.\n- If pH < pI, the solution is more acidic than the protein's neutral point. The protein will accept protons and have a net positive charge.\n- If pH > pI, the solution is more basic than the protein's neutral point. The protein will donate protons and have a net negative charge.\n- If pH = pI, the protein has a net charge of zero.\n\nCation-exchange chromatography uses a negatively charged resin. Due to electrostatic attraction, this resin will bind positively charged molecules (cations).\n\nThe protein mixture is loaded onto the column at a buffer pH of 5.2. We must determine the net charge of each protein at this pH:\n- **Fumarase C (FumC):** pI = 5.7. The buffer pH (5.2) is less than the pI (5.7). Therefore, FumC will have a net positive charge and will **bind** to the negatively charged resin.\n- **Thioredoxin (TrxA):** pI = 4.7. The buffer pH (5.2) is greater than the pI (4.7). Therefore, TrxA will have a net negative charge. It will be repelled by the resin and will **not bind**, appearing in the flow-through fraction.\n- **Alkaline Phosphatase (PhoA):** pI = 9.2. The buffer pH (5.2) is less than the pI (9.2). Therefore, PhoA will have a net positive charge and will **bind** to the resin.\n\nBased on this analysis, only TrxA will be found in the flow-through. This immediately eliminates options C, D, and E. We are left to decide between A and B, which differ only in the elution order.\n\n**Part 2: Elution Order**\n\nThe proteins that are bound to the column (FumC and PhoA) are eluted using a gradient of increasing pH. As the pH of the buffer passing through the column rises, the net positive charge on the bound proteins will decrease. A protein will elute from the column when its net charge approaches zero (i.e., when the buffer pH approaches the protein's pI). At its pI, the protein has no net charge and thus no electrostatic attraction to the resin, causing it to unbind and be washed off the column.\n\nWe have two bound proteins: FumC (pI = 5.7) and PhoA (pI = 9.2).\n- As the pH gradient starts to increase from 5.2, it will first reach the pI of FumC at pH 5.7. At this point, FumC will become neutral and elute from the column.\n- The pH must continue to rise significantly higher to reach the pI of PhoA at pH 9.2. Only then will PhoA become neutral and elute from the column.\n\nTherefore, the elution order of the bound proteins is FumC first, followed by PhoA.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe flow-through fraction contains TrxA, and the bound proteins elute in the order of FumC then PhoA.
