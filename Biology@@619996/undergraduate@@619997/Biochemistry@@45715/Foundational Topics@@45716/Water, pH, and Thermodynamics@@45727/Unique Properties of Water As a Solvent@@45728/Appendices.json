{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental skill in biochemistry is predicting a molecule's behavior in water based on its structure. This exercise challenges you to analyze a hypothetical drug molecule and determine its solubility by weighing the contributions of its polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) components. Mastering this balance is key to understanding drug delivery and molecular interactions in a biological context. [@problem_id:2087234]", "problem": "A pharmaceutical research team has synthesized a novel organic compound, named \"Glycobenzene,\" as a potential drug candidate. The molecular structure of Glycobenzene consists of a single, nonpolar benzene ring to which a polar, linear three-carbon chain is attached. Each of the three carbon atoms in this chain is bonded to one hydroxyl group ($-OH$). The drug is designed for intravenous administration, which requires it to be readily soluble in the aqueous environment of the bloodstream.\n\nBased on the principles of molecular interactions in aqueous solutions, predict the likely solubility of Glycobenzene in water. Choose the option below that provides the most accurate prediction and correct reasoning.\n\nA. Glycobenzene is likely to be insoluble in water. The large, nonpolar benzene ring creates a significant hydrophobic effect that prevents the molecule from dissolving, overriding any potential interactions from the hydroxyl groups.\n\nB. Glycobenzene is likely to be soluble in water. The three polar hydroxyl groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules, and this strong hydrophilic interaction is sufficient to overcome the hydrophobic nature of the single benzene ring.\n\nC. Glycobenzene is likely to be insoluble in water. The hydroxyl groups on the carbon chain will primarily form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with each other, shielding their polarity and preventing favorable interactions with water.\n\nD. Glycobenzene is likely to be soluble in water. The flat structure of the benzene ring allows it to easily integrate into the hydrogen-bonded network of water without causing significant disruption.", "solution": "We model the solubility of a solute in water by the sign of the Gibbs free energy of solvation, with $\\Delta G_{\\text{sol}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{sol}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{sol}}$. Favorable solubility requires sufficiently negative enthalpic contributions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions) to compensate for any entropic penalties (e.g., structuring of water around hydrophobic moieties) and for disruption of the water hydrogen-bond network.\n\nGlycobenzene has a single nonpolar benzene ring (hydrophobic) and a linear three-carbon chain bearing three hydroxyl groups, one on each carbon (a triol, strongly hydrophilic). Each hydroxyl group can donate one hydrogen bond and accept one hydrogen bond, allowing multiple strong solute-water hydrogen bonds. Thus, the triol chain provides substantial favorable $\\Delta H_{\\text{sol}}$ via hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions with water.\n\nThe benzene ring contributes a hydrophobic penalty through poor enthalpic interaction with water and an unfavorable entropic term due to water structuring. However, a single benzene ring is a relatively modest hydrophobic unit compared to long alkyl chains, whereas three hydroxyl groups constitute a strong hydrophilic handle. Empirically and conceptually, polyols (e.g., glycerol) are highly water-soluble; appending a single phenyl group reduces, but does not eliminate, water solubility when multiple hydroxyl groups are present. Therefore, the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the triol side chain is sufficient to overcome the hydrophobicity of one benzene ring, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{sol}}$ negative.\n\nThe alternative rationales are less consistent with molecular principles. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding among vicinal hydroxyls in a flexible three-carbon chain is limited and readily competed out by water; even if transient intramolecular hydrogen bonds form, they cannot fully sequester all three hydroxyl groups without significant strain, and water forms strong, competitive hydrogen bonds. Therefore, claiming insolubility due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding is not supported. Furthermore, benzene does not integrate into water’s hydrogen-bond network; it neither donates nor accepts hydrogen bonds, so the suggestion that planarity enables seamless integration is incorrect.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction and reasoning is that Glycobenzene is likely to be soluble in water because the three hydroxyl groups provide sufficient hydrophilic, hydrogen-bonding interactions to outweigh the hydrophobic effect of a single benzene ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2087234"}, {"introduction": "The hydrophobic effect not only governs solubility but also drives the spontaneous self-assembly of complex structures like cell membranes and micelles. This thought experiment probes the fundamental principles of this effect by asking you to predict what happens when a micelle is moved from water to a nonpolar solvent. Your reasoning will reveal whether you are applying a flexible, environment-dependent thermodynamic principle rather than relying on fixed labels. [@problem_id:2087251]", "problem": "Amphipathic molecules, such as fatty acids, possess both a polar, hydrophilic \"head\" group and a long, nonpolar, hydrophobic \"tail\". When dispersed in an aqueous solution above a certain concentration, these molecules spontaneously self-assemble into spherical structures known as micelles. In a standard micelle formed in water, the hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the core, and the hydrophilic heads form the outer shell, interacting with the surrounding water molecules.\n\nConsider a stable suspension of such micelles that was initially prepared in water. This entire suspension is then transferred and thoroughly mixed into a large volume of a nonpolar organic solvent, such as liquid hexane ($C_{6}H_{14}$), and the water is subsequently removed. Predict the most thermodynamically stable conformation that the amphipathic molecules will adopt in the new nonpolar solvent environment.\n\nSelect the most accurate description from the options below.\n\nA. The micelle structures will remain unchanged, with the hydrophobic tails in the core and the hydrophilic heads on the surface.\n\nB. The amphipathic molecules will completely dissociate from one another and become individually solvated, dispersing randomly throughout the hexane.\n\nC. The molecules will reassemble into \"reverse micelles,\" where the hydrophilic heads form a shielded inner core and the hydrophobic tails project outward into the hexane solvent.\n\nD. The molecules will lose their ordered structure and aggregate into a large, disordered, solid precipitate.\n\nE. The molecules will rearrange to form an extended, flat bilayer sheet, with two layers of molecules oriented tail-to-tail.", "solution": "We seek the conformation with the lowest Gibbs free energy in the new solvent. The thermodynamic criterion is minimization of the Gibbs free energy,\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S,\n$$\nfor the ensemble of amphipathic molecules and solvent. The key contributions are the enthalpic penalty of unfavorable polar–nonpolar contacts and the solvent entropy associated with structuring around solute surfaces.\n\nIn water, normal micelles form because exposing nonpolar tails to water imposes a large enthalpic penalty and decreases water entropy by ordering solvent around hydrophobic surfaces. Aggregation into micelles sequesters hydrophobic tails in the core and presents hydrophilic heads at the interface with water, minimizing the area of unfavorable tail–water contact and maximizing the entropy of the surrounding water.\n\nAfter transfer into a large volume of a nonpolar solvent (hexane) and removal of water, the situation inverts. The hydrophobic tails are now well solvated with hexane, while the polar head groups make unfavorable contacts with hexane. To minimize the interfacial free energy penalty, the system reduces the area of head–hexane contact. The interfacial contribution to the free energy can be written schematically as\n$$\nG_{\\text{int}} = \\gamma_{\\text{head-hexane}} A_{\\text{head-hexane}} + \\gamma_{\\text{tail-hexane}} A_{\\text{tail-hexane}},\n$$\nwith $\\gamma_{\\text{head-hexane}} \\gg \\gamma_{\\text{tail-hexane}}$, so minimizing $A_{\\text{head-hexane}}$ is favored. Aggregation of head groups into an interior domain, with tails extending into the nonpolar solvent, accomplishes this while also increasing the entropy of the bulk solvent by reducing the structuring around isolated polar groups.\n\nThe most favorable finite aggregate that minimizes exposure of head groups and avoids edge exposure is a reverse (inverted) micelle: hydrophilic heads form a shielded inner core, and hydrophobic tails contact the hexane. This is the well-established behavior of amphiphiles in nonpolar media.\n\nRuling out alternatives:\n- A is unfavorable because it maximizes polar head–hexane contact at the surface.\n- B is unfavorable because complete dissociation exposes every head group to hexane, increasing $\\Delta H$ and decreasing solvent entropy.\n- D is not required; ordered aggregates reduce interfacial penalties more effectively than a large disordered precipitate, especially at low amphiphile concentrations in a large solvent volume.\n- E (flat bilayer) would have exposed edges with head groups in contact with hexane unless it closes. In dilute nonpolar solvent, single-chain amphiphiles preferentially form reverse micelles rather than extended bilayers due to packing constraints and edge energy; closure would lead to reverse vesicles, but the simplest, most common, and thermodynamically favored small aggregate is the reverse micelle.\n\nTherefore, the molecules will reassemble into reverse micelles in hexane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2087251"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the hydrophobic effect, water's remarkably high dielectric constant is another of its defining features as a biological solvent.
