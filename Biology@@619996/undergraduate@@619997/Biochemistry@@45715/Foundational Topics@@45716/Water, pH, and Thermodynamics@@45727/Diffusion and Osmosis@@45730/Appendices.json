We can solve this by following these steps: first, determine the initial concentration of the external sucrose solution required for osmotic equilibrium. Second, use the Staverman equation for effective osmotic pressure with the new reflection coefficients.\n\nStep 1: Determine the initial state and external sucrose concentration.\nThe cell is initially in osmotic equilibrium. This means the total osmolarity inside the cell, $\\text{Osmol}_{\\text{in}}$, is equal to the total osmolarity outside the cell, $\\text{Osmol}_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nThe internal solute is potassium phosphate, $\\text{K}_2\\text{HPO}_4$, at a concentration $C_{\\text{in}} = 115$ mM.
