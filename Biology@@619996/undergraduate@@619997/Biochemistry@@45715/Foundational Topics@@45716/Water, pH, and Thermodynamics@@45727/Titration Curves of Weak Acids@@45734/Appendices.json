A specific volume of KOH added during the titration, $V = 17.75$ mL, at which the $\\text{pH}$ was measured.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these two volumes. We can see that:\n$$\nV = 17.75 \\text{ mL} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 35.50 \\text{ mL} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{eq}\n$$\nThis means the point where the $\\text{pH}$ was measured to be $4.85$ is the half-equivalence point.\n\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of added base are equal to the initial moles of the acid.\n$$\n\\text{moles of } \\text{HA}_{\\text{initial}} = \\text{moles of } \\text{OH}^-_{\\text{added at equivalence}}\n$$\nAt the half-equivalence point, half the volume of base needed for equivalence has been added.
