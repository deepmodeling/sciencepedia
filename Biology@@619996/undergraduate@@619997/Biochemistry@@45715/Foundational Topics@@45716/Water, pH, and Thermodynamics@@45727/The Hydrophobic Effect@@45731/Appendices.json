The interior of the protein, which is largely shielded from the surrounding water molecules, is designated as the protein 'core'. In contrast, the 'surface' of the protein is the region that remains exposed to the aqueous solvent. This protein's primary sequence contains both tryptophan and arginine residues. Based on the fundamental principles governing protein folding in an aqueous solution, which of the following statements best describes the most thermodynamically favorable location for these two types of amino acid residues?\n\nA. Both tryptophan and arginine are most likely to be found on the protein's surface.\n\nB. Tryptophan is most likely to be found on the protein's surface, while arginine is most likely to be found in the protein's core.\n\nC.

In an aqueous environment, folded protein stability is governed by the hydrophobic effect, solvation energetics, and specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. The free energy change for relocating a side chain from one environment to another can be expressed qualitatively as a transfer free energy. Denote the free energy for transferring residue $X$ from water to the hydrophobic protein core as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\mathrm{water} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{core}}(X)$. The thermodynamically favored location minimizes the overall free energy.\n\nFor hydrophobic residues with large nonpolar surface area, burying them in the core reduces the ordering of surrounding water molecules, increasing solvent entropy. This hydrophobic effect lowers free energy:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{solvent}}(\\text{bury hydrophobe}) > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\text{ decreases.}\n$$\nEquivalently,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\mathrm{water} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{core}}(\\text{hydrophobe})  0.\n$$\nTryptophan is predominantly hydrophobic due to its large indole ring, despite possessing one indole N–H that can donate a hydrogen bond. Its large apolar surface area makes exposure to water entropically costly, so burial in the protein core is favored:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\mathrm{water} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{core}}(\\mathrm{Trp})  0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\mathrm{Trp} \\text{ prefers the core.}\n$$\n\nFor charged or strongly polar residues, water provides favorable solvation via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Removing such groups from water incurs a large desolvation penalty unless compensated by strong internal interactions (e.g., a buried salt bridge).
