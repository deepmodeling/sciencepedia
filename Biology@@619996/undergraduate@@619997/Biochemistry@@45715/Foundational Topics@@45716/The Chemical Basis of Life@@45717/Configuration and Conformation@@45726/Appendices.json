This initial exercise challenges you to apply the core definitions of stereoisomerism to a biologically relevant molecule, the amino acid isoleucine. By determining the relationship between two of its stereoisomers, you will solidify your grasp on the critical distinction between diastereomers and enantiomers, a concept essential for understanding molecular recognition and protein structure [@problem_id:2139350].", "problem": "The amino acid isoleucine has the chemical formula $C_{6}H_{13}NO_{2}$. Its structure possesses two chiral centers: the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) and the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$) located within its side chain. The 'L' and 'D' notation for amino acids refers to the absolute configuration at the $C_{\\alpha}$. The naturally occurring form incorporated into proteins is L-isoleucine. A different, non-proteinogenic stereoisomer is L-alloisoleucine.\n\nBoth L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine share the same 'L' configuration at the alpha-carbon. However, they possess opposite configurations at the beta-carbon. Given this information, determine the precise stereochemical relationship between L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine.\n\nA. Enantiomers\n\nB. Diastereomers\n\nC. Constitutional isomers\n\nD. Identical compounds\n\nE. Conformational isomers", "solution": "The problem asks for the stereochemical relationship between L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine, given that they both have two chiral centers and specific information about their configurations.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the types of isomerism presented in the options.\n- **Constitutional isomers** (or structural isomers) are molecules that have the same molecular formula but different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded in a different order).\n- **Stereoisomers** are molecules that have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms. Stereoisomers can be further classified.\n- **Enantiomers** are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. For a molecule with multiple chiral centers, its enantiomer has the opposite configuration at *every* chiral center.\n- **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs in compounds with two or more chiral centers when they have different configurations at some, but not all, of the corresponding chiral centers.\n- **Conformational isomers** (or conformers) are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. They are not different compounds.\n- **Identical compounds** have the same structure and configuration and are superimposable.\n\nStep 2: Apply the definitions to the molecules in the problem.\nThe problem states that L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine are stereoisomers of isoleucine. This means they have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity. This fact immediately eliminates option C, \"Constitutional isomers.\" Since they are described as different stereoisomers, option D, \"Identical compounds,\" is also incorrect. Conformational isomers are not distinct compounds, but rather different rotational states of the same molecule, so option E is also incorrect. The relationship must be either enantiomers or diastereomers.\n\nStep 3: Distinguish between enantiomers and diastereomers based on the provided information.\nIsoleucine has two chiral centers: the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) and the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$). Let's denote the configuration at these centers as a pair, $(C_{\\alpha}, C_{\\beta})$.\n- The problem states that both molecules are 'L' isomers. This means they have the same configuration at the alpha-carbon. Let's represent this configuration as 'L-config'.\n- The problem states they have opposite configurations at the beta-carbon. Let's call the configuration for L-isoleucine 'config-1' and for L-alloisoleucine 'config-2', where 'config-2' is the opposite of 'config-1'.\n\nSo, we can represent the configurations as:\n- L-isoleucine: (L-config, config-1)\n- L-alloisoleucine: (L-config, config-2)\n\nStep 4: Determine if they are enantiomers.\nFor two molecules to be enantiomers, they must be non-superimposable mirror images. In terms of configuration at chiral centers, this means that every chiral center must be inverted. The enantiomer of L-isoleucine would have the configuration (D-config, config-2), where 'D-config' is the opposite of 'L-config'.\nThe configuration of L-alloisoleucine is (L-config, config-2). Comparing this to the enantiomer of L-isoleucine, (D-config, config-2), we see they are not the same. Therefore, L-alloisoleucine is not the enantiomer of L-isoleucine. This eliminates option A.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the relationship.\nL-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. By definition, such molecules are diastereomers. They have one stereocenter in common (the $C_{\\alpha}$) and one that is different (the $C_{\\beta}$). This is the characteristic feature of a diastereomeric relationship in molecules with two chiral centers.\n\nTo be more rigorous using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) notation:\n- The L-configuration at the alpha-carbon corresponds to the (S) configuration for almost all amino acids, including isoleucine. So, both molecules are (S) at $C_{\\alpha}$ (which is carbon-2).\n- The two possible configurations at the beta-carbon (carbon-3) are (S) and (R).\n- L-isoleucine is specifically (2S, 3S)-isoleucine.\n- L-alloisoleucine is (2S, 3R)-isoleucine.\n- The enantiomer of L-isoleucine, (2S, 3S), would be D-isoleucine, which is (2R, 3R).\n- Since L-alloisoleucine (2S, 3R) is not the same as L-isoleucine (2S, 3S) and not its enantiomer (2R, 3R), they must be diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2139350"}, {"introduction": "Moving from static configuration to dynamic conformation, this practice explores how a molecule's fixed stereochemistry influences its preferred shape.

A key question is whether this hetero-chiral polymer can adopt a stable, regular secondary structure like an $\\alpha$-helix.\n\nFor this analysis, you are given the following information and a simplified model for torsional strain energy:\n\n1.  The canonical right-handed $\\alpha$-helix, the most common secondary structure element in natural proteins, is formed from L-amino acids and is characterized by ideal backbone torsion angles of $(\\phi, \\psi) = (-57^{\\circ}, -47^{\\circ})$.\n2.  L-amino acids can also form a less common left-handed $\\alpha$-helix, which has ideal torsion angles of $(\\phi, \\psi) = (+57^{\\circ}, +47^{\\circ})$.\n3.  A fundamental principle of stereochemistry dictates that a D-amino acid residue within a polypeptide of a certain helical handedness (e.g., right-handed) is energetically equivalent to an L-amino acid residue in a helix of the opposite handedness (e.g., left-handed).\n4.  The torsional strain energy for a single amino acid residue being forced into a non-ideal conformation can be approximated by the harmonic potential function:\n    $$E_{strain} = k [(\\phi_{actual} - \\phi_{ideal})^{2} + (\\psi_{actual} - \\psi_{ideal})^{2}]$$\n    where $(\\phi_{actual}, \\psi_{actual})$ are the angles the residue is forced to adopt, and $(\\phi_{ideal}, \\psi_{ideal})$ are the residue's ideal angles for that specific helical fold.

The first reaction involves the oxidation of a synthetic substrate which possesses a prochiral center $R\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}R'$. A specially prepared version of this substrate is used, where the *pro-R* hydrogen atom has been replaced with a deuterium atom (D).

By definition, on a prochiral methylene $R\\text{-}CH_{2}\\text{-}R'$, the two hydrogens are enantiotopic: replacing the pro-R hydrogen by a higher-priority substituent would give an $R$ configuration at that center.\n- Dehydrogenase-1 is *pro-R* specific with respect to the substrate; therefore, it removes the pro-R hydrogen. Since that position is deuterated, the enzyme transfers $D^{-}$ to the nicotinamide cofactor.\n- Dehydrogenase-1 is a Class A dehydrogenase, which (by the standard Cornforth/Kahn-Ingold-Prelog mapping) transfers hydride to the *re* face of the NAD+ nicotinamide ring. Thus, the hydride (here $D^{-}$) adds to the *re* face at C4 of NAD+, generating NADH in which the deuterium occupies the 4-*pro-R* position of NADH. In short: Class A implies *re*-face addition, and *re*-face addition installs the label at the 4-*pro-R* position of NADH.\n\n2) Transfer from NADH to pyruvate:\n- The resulting deuterated NADH is used by Dehydrogenase-2, which is *pro-R* specific with respect to NADH. Therefore, it removes the 4-*pro-R* hydrogen from C4 of NADH. Since the first enzyme installed D specifically at the 4-*pro-R* position, Dehydrogenase-2 removes that D and delivers it to pyruvate in the reduction step.\n- Dehydrogenase-2 stereospecifically produces $(S)$-lactate from pyruvate. Hence, the hydride (here $D^{-}$) is delivered to the face of pyruvate that yields the $(S)$ configuration at C2 in lactate.\n\n3) Configuration at lactate C2 in the labeled product:\n- The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority order given for the lactate C2 substituents is $-OH > -COO^{-} > -CH_{3} > -D$. This places D as the lowest among the four substituents under consideration, so the handedness determined by the arrangement of $-OH$, $-COO^{-}$, and $-CH_{3}$ directly sets the absolute configuration.\n- Since Dehydrogenase-2 is known to form $(S)$-lactate, replacing the prochiral hydrogen by D does not change the assignment: with $-OH > -COO^{-} > -CH_{3} > -D$, the center is $(S)$.\n\nConclusion:\n- The deuterium label is transferred from the substrate to NADH at the 4-*pro-R* position (by the Class A, *re*-face addition), and then from NADH to pyruvate (by the *pro-R* specific Dehydrogenase-2), producing $(S)$-lactate bearing deuterium at C2.
