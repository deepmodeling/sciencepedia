It performs glycolysis followed by standard ethanol fermentation. The complete anaerobic catabolism of glucose in the WT strain yields a net total of 2 moles of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) for every mole of glucose consumed. The fermentation steps are essential for regenerating the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ($NAD^+$) that is converted to its reduced form (NADH) during glycolysis, thus allowing glycolysis to continue.\n\nThe second strain is an engineered mutant (EM). This strain has been genetically modified and cannot perform ethanol fermentation. To survive anaerobically, it utilizes a novel, synthetic metabolic pathway to process the products of glycolysis. This synthetic pathway successfully regenerates all the $NAD^+$ required to maintain glycolytic flux. A key feature of this engineered pathway is that, through its unique biochemical steps, it achieves an additional net synthesis of 1 mole of ATP for every 1 mole of glucose that is initially broken down by glycolysis.\n\nAn experiment is conducted in an anaerobic bioreactor containing the EM strain. The bioreactor is supplied with an initial amount of glucose, $G_0 = 15.0$ moles, and the culture is grown until all the glucose is consumed.\n\nGiven that the molar mass of ATP is $M_{ATP} = 507.18$ g/mol, calculate the total net mass of ATP produced in the bioreactor by the EM strain.
