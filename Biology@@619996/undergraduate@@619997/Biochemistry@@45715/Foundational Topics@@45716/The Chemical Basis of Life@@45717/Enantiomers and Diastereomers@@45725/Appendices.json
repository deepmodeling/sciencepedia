This first practice challenges you to classify pairs of common sugars, such as D-glucose and D-fructose, which share the molecular formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$. By distinguishing between constitutional isomers, enantiomers, and diastereomers, you will build a solid foundation for analyzing the subtle but critical structural differences that dictate the unique biological roles of these essential molecules [@problem_id:2042427].", "problem": "In the study of carbohydrates, isomerism plays a critical role in determining their biological function and chemical properties. Many simple sugars share the same molecular formula but differ in their structural arrangement. Consider the following three pairs of common hexose monosaccharides, all of which have the molecular formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$:\n\n*   **Pair I:** D-glucose and D-fructose\n*   **Pair II:** D-glucose and L-glucose\n*   **Pair III:** D-glucose and D-galactose\n\nBased on your understanding of stereochemistry, determine the correct isomeric relationship for each pair.

Epimers, Constitutional Isomers, Enantiomers\n\nF. All three pairs represent different types of Diastereomers.", "solution": "All three pairs share the molecular formula $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, so any differences arise from connectivity (constitutional isomers) or spatial arrangement (stereoisomers). By definition, constitutional isomers have different connectivity, whereas stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in configuration. Among stereoisomers, enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images differing at all stereocenters, while diastereomers are non-mirror-image stereoisomers; epimers are a specific type of diastereomer that differ at exactly one stereocenter.\n\nFor Pair I (D-glucose and D-fructose), D-glucose is an aldohexose (carbonyl at C-1) and D-fructose is a ketohexose (carbonyl at C-2). The position of the carbonyl group changes the connectivity of atoms, so these are constitutional isomers.\n\nFor Pair II (D-glucose and L-glucose), the D/L designation indicates configurations that are mirror images at all chiral centers of the same sugar. Thus D-glucose and L-glucose have identical connectivity but opposite configurations at every stereocenter, making them enantiomers.\n\nFor Pair III (D-glucose and D-galactose), these sugars differ only at the configuration of C-4 among their stereocenters. They are therefore epimers at C-4, which are a subset of diastereomers. Among the given options, the classification that lists Pair III as diastereomers (recognizing that epimers are diastereomers) together with the correct identifications for Pairs I and II is the option that reads: Constitutional Isomers, Enantiomers, Diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2042427"}, {"introduction": "Once you can classify isomers, the next step is to rigorously determine their absolute configurations.

Priorities at $C_{2}$ are: $1=\\text{OH}$ (oxygen), $2=\\text{CHO}$ (the $C_{1}$ carbon has set $\\{\\text{O,O,H}\\}$), $3=\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ (the $C_{3}$ carbon has set $\\{\\text{O,H,H}\\}$), $4=\\text{H}$.

With $4=\\text{H}$ on a horizontal position (toward the viewer), determine the $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ order on the 2D Fischer cross: right (OH) to top (CHO) to bottom ($\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$) traces a counterclockwise path. Because the lowest priority is toward the viewer, invert the sense to obtain $C_{2}=\\text{R}$. Therefore statement A, claiming S, is false.\n\nDetermine configurations of Compound A. At $C_{2}$ in A, the pattern is identical to D-glyceraldehyde (OH right, H left; top CHO, bottom rest), so $C_{2}=\\text{R}$ by the same reasoning. At $C_3$ in A, priorities are $1 = \\text{OH}$ and $4 = \\text{H}$ (on a horizontal, toward the viewer). Between the vertical substituents, the top group (containing C-2) outranks the bottom group (containing C-4) because C-2 is bonded to $\\{\\text{O, C, H}\\}$ while C-4 is bonded to $\\{\\text{O, H, H}\\}$; the top group is priority #2 and the bottom is #3. The $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ order right-to-top-to-bottom is counterclockwise; invert due to $4=\\text{H}$ on a horizontal position to obtain $C_{3}=\\text{R}$. Thus Compound A is $(2\\text{R},3\\text{R})$.\n\nDetermine configurations of Compound B. At $C_{2}$ in B, priorities are the same as above but OH is left and H is right (H on horizontal, toward the viewer); positions are $1=\\text{left}$, $2=\\text{top}$, $3=\\text{bottom}$, $4=\\text{right}$. The $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ order left-to-top-to-bottom is clockwise; invert due to $4=\\text{H}$ toward the viewer to obtain $C_{2}=\\text{S}$. At $C_{3}$ in B, the situation matches that of A for $C_{3}$: $1=\\text{OH}$ (right), $4=\\text{H}$ (left, horizontal), and the top group outranks the bottom group. The $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ order right-to-top-to-bottom is counterclockwise; invert to obtain $C_{3}=\\text{R}$.
