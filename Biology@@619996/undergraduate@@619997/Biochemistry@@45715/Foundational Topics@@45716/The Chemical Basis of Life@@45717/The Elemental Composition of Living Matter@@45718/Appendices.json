This exercise [@problem_id:2082457] challenges you to work backward from a set of elemental data to deduce which molecular families could be present in a sample. Understanding these elemental \"fingerprints\"—particularly the essential roles of phosphorus ($P$) and sulfur ($S$)—is a fundamental skill for identifying and classifying biological material.", "problem": "An automated rover on a distant exoplanet has collected a sample from what appears to be a desiccated biological film. An onboard chemical analysis suite performs a detailed elemental composition analysis. The results indicate that the sample is rich in carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). However, subsequent high-sensitivity tests for phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) both yield negative results, confirming their absence from the sample material.\n\nThe science team back on Earth is now debating the potential biochemistry of the ancient life that produced this film. Based strictly on the elemental data provided, which one of the following molecular classes could *not* have been a significant component in the organism?\n\nA. Polysaccharides used for structural support, such as chitin.\n\nB. Polypeptide chains forming the organism's cytoskeleton.\n\nC. Triglycerides used for long-term energy storage.\n\nD. An information-carrying genetic polymer analogous to terrestrial Ribonucleic Acid (RNA).\n\nE. A catalytic molecule functioning as an enzyme.", "solution": "The elemental analysis shows presence of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, with confirmed absence of phosphorus and sulfur. Determine for each molecular class whether phosphorus or sulfur is strictly required.\n\nA. Polysaccharides (e.g., chitin) are polymers of monosaccharides. Chitin is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and thus contains C, H, O, and N. Polysaccharides do not require phosphorus or sulfur. Therefore, their presence is consistent with the data.\n\nB. Polypeptides are formed from amino acids. While two common terrestrial amino acids (cysteine and methionine) contain sulfur, polypeptides can be composed entirely of amino acids that contain only C, H, O, and N. Therefore, sulfur is not strictly required for polypeptide formation, and phosphorus is not required either. Thus, polypeptide cytoskeletal components are not excluded by the data.\n\nC. Triglycerides are triesters of glycerol with fatty acids. Their composition requires only C, H, and O. They do not require phosphorus or sulfur. Hence, they are compatible with the elemental findings.\n\nD. An information-carrying genetic polymer analogous to terrestrial RNA requires a sugar-phosphate backbone. Each nucleotide includes a phosphate group, making phosphorus essential for such a polymer. The confirmed absence of phosphorus rules out an RNA-analog as a significant component.\n\nE. Enzymes are catalytic macromolecules. Protein enzymes can, in principle, be composed exclusively of amino acids lacking sulfur, so neither sulfur nor phosphorus is strictly required for protein-based catalysis. Although ribozymes would require phosphorus, the class “enzyme” does not inherently require phosphorus or sulfur. Therefore, enzymes are not excluded by the data.\n\nOnly option D necessarily requires phosphorus. With phosphorus absent, a genetic polymer analogous to RNA could not have been a significant component.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2082457"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative identification to quantitative analysis is a key step in biochemistry.
