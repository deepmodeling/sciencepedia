The lysosome, for instance, serves as the cell's digestive system, containing hydrolytic enzymes that function optimally in a highly acidic milieu. This acidic environment is maintained by V-type ATPases that actively transport protons ($H^+$) from the cytosol into the lysosomal interior, or lumen.\n\nConsider a typical animal cell where the homeostatic pH of the cytosol is 7.2, while the pH of the lysosomal lumen is maintained at 4.5. Calculate the ratio of the molar concentration of protons inside the lysosome to the molar concentration of protons in the cytosol.

This is achieved through specific molecular 'zip codes,' or sorting signals, embedded within the proteins themselves.

[@problem_id:2035867]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, proteins destined for the lysosome are tagged with a specific carbohydrate marker, mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), within the Golgi apparatus. This tag allows them to be sorted into vesicles that deliver them to the lysosome. Consider a patient with a rare genetic disorder where the enzyme responsible for adding the M6P tag to newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases is completely non-functional.

A complete absence of secretory proteins, such as albumin and collagen.\n\nD. The presence of M6P receptors that have been shed from the cell surface.\n\nE. An abnormally high concentration of free mannose-6-phosphate molecules.", "solution": "Step 1: State the normal trafficking mechanism. In eukaryotic cells, soluble lysosomal hydrolases synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the cis-Golgi, the key targeting signal mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) is added to N-linked oligosaccharides by the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), M6P-tagged hydrolases bind M6P receptors, which package them into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and, ultimately, lysosomes.\n\nStep 2: Apply the defect described. If the enzyme that adds M6P is completely non-functional, newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases lack the M6P tag. Without this tag, they cannot bind M6P receptors in the TGN and thus are not sorted into vesicles for lysosomal delivery.\n\nStep 3: Determine the default pathway. Proteins that are not specifically sorted in the TGN typically follow the constitutive secretory pathway. Therefore, untagged lysosomal hydrolases are secreted extracellularly.\n\nStep 4: Predict the extracellular fluid consequence. Because many lysosomal hydrolases are misdirected into the constitutive secretory pathway, the most direct and prominent change in extracellular fluid is a significantly elevated concentration of various lysosomal hydrolases.\n\nStep 5: Exclude alternative options.\n- Option B describes intracellular accumulation of undigested substrates, which is a hallmark of I-cell disease but is not the most direct finding in extracellular fluid.\n- Option C is incorrect because general secretory proteins (e.g., albumin, collagen) use the secretory pathway and do not depend on M6P tagging.\n- Option D is incorrect because M6P receptors are membrane proteins that cycle between TGN and endosomes; pathological shedding is not the expected direct consequence.\n- Option E is incorrect because the defect prevents addition of M6P to proteins; it does not generate excess free M6P in extracellular fluid.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2035867"}, {"introduction": "The transport of materials between organelles is not a random process; it is a dynamic, highly regulated pathway involving vesicles that bud from a donor and fuse with a target membrane. This practice delves into the molecular machinery that governs this traffic, focusing on the small GTPase $Sar1$ and the $COPII$ coat. By simulating an experiment with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog ($GTP\\gamma S$), you will dissect the precise sequence of events in vesicle formation and uncoating, revealing how molecular switches control cellular logistics. [@problem_id:2035893]", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment designed to study protein trafficking from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), a researcher introduces a high concentration of Guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), abbreviated as $GTP\\gamma S$, into the cytosol. $GTP\\gamma S$ is a synthetic analog of Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in which a sulfur atom replaces a non-bridging oxygen in the γ-phosphate group. This modification makes the terminal phosphate bond resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis. The COPII (Coat protein complex II) vesicle budding process from the ER is critically dependent on the GTP/GDP cycle of the small GTPase Sar1. The cycle is initiated by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) called Sec12 and terminated by the GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) activity inherent in the COPII coat itself. Assuming all other cellular processes remain functional, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the specific stage at which the COPII-mediated anterograde transport pathway would be arrested under these conditions?\n\nA. The recruitment of the Sar1 GTPase to the ER membrane would be inhibited, preventing the initiation of bud formation.\n\nB. Vesicles would successfully form and bud from the ER, but they would accumulate in the cytosol as they would be unable to shed their COPII coat, preventing fusion with the Golgi apparatus.\n\nC. The inner coat complex (Sec23/Sec24) would assemble on the ER membrane, but the recruitment of the outer coat complex (Sec13/Sec31) would be blocked, stalling vesicle formation at an early budding stage.\n\nD. Vesicles would form and uncoat normally, but their fusion with the target cis-Golgi membrane would be directly inhibited because $GTP\\gamma S$ interferes with the SNARE protein-mediated fusion machinery.\n\nE. Sar1-$GTP\\gamma S$ would bind to the ER membrane successfully, but the subsequent recruitment and binding of specific cargo proteins via the Sec24 subunit would be impaired.", "solution": "1) Identify the relevant molecular switch and its cycle. COPII coat assembly is driven by the small GTPase Sar1. Sar1 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. Activation is catalyzed by the ER-resident GEF Sec12, which promotes exchange of GDP for GTP on Sar1. In the GTP-bound state, Sar1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the ER membrane, initiating bud formation and recruiting the inner coat Sec23/Sec24. The outer coat Sec13/Sec31 assembles subsequently. Termination of this cycle requires GTP hydrolysis by Sar1, which is stimulated by the GAP activity of Sec23 and further enhanced by Sec31, leading to coat disassembly (uncoating).\n\n2) Determine the effect of $GTP\\gamma S$ on GTPase cycling. $GTP\\gamma S$ is a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP; it binds GTPases in a GTP-like manner but cannot be hydrolyzed due to the sulfur substitution in the $\\gamma$-phosphate which renders the terminal phosphate bond resistant to enzymatic cleavage. Therefore, once Sar1 binds $GTP\\gamma S$ via Sec12-mediated exchange, Sar1 remains locked in the GTP-bound (active) state, and GAP-stimulated hydrolysis cannot occur.\n\n3) Predict consequences for each step of the COPII pathway under non-hydrolyzable conditions:\n- Recruitment/initiation: Because Sec12-mediated nucleotide exchange is intact, Sar1 will bind $GTP\\gamma S$ and insert into the ER membrane. Thus initiation and Sar1 recruitment are not inhibited. This rules out A.\n- Inner and outer coat assembly: Active Sar1-$GTP\\gamma S$ recruits Sec23/Sec24 (inner coat) and then Sec13/Sec31 (outer coat). There is no block in outer coat recruitment caused by the lack of hydrolysis; assembly proceeds. This rules out C and E.\n- Budding/scission: COPII-coated buds and vesicles can form with Sar1 locked in the GTP-bound state. Numerous in vitro and in vivo observations show that non-hydrolyzable GTP supports coat assembly and budding, but prevents proper uncoating.\n- Uncoating and fusion: GTP hydrolysis on Sar1 is required for coat disassembly. With $GTP\\gamma S$, Sar1 remains active and the coat remains stably bound. Persistent coating impedes the exposure and function of fusion machinery required for targeting and fusion with the cis-Golgi. While membrane fusion relies on SNAREs and tethering factors (and Rab GTPases), the stipulation that all other processes remain functional means the primary block arises from failure to uncoat. The effect is not a direct inhibition of SNAREs by $GTP\\gamma S$ but an indirect block because coated vesicles cannot efficiently fuse. This rules out D as stated.\n\n4) Synthesis. The specific arrest point is after vesicle formation and budding, at the uncoating step. Vesicles accumulate as coated intermediates that cannot fuse with the Golgi.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate outcome is that vesicles form and bud but fail to shed the COPII coat, preventing fusion with the Golgi apparatus.\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2035893"}]}
