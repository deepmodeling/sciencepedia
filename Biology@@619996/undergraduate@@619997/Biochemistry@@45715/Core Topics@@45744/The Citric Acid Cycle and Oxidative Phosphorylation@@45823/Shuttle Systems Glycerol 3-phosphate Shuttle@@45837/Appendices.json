One such mechanism is the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle.\n\nThe shuttle operates as follows:\n1. In the cytosol, electrons from NADH are transferred to Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DHAP), reducing it to glycerol 3-phosphate.\n2. Glycerol 3-phosphate diffuses to the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n3. An enzyme embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, oxidizes glycerol 3-phosphate back to DHAP.\n4. During this oxidation, the enzyme transfers the pair of electrons to a molecule of Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD), reducing it to FADH2.\n5. This FADH2 then donates its electrons to the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) at Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone).\n\nFor the purpose of your calculation, assume that the P/O ratio, which represents the number of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules synthesized per pair of electrons, is approximately 2.5 for electrons entering the ETC via NADH at Complex I and approximately 1.5 for electrons entering via FADH2.\n\nBased on the described pathway, what is the approximate net number of ATP molecules generated per single molecule of cytosolic NADH that is re-oxidized via the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle?\n\nA. 0.0\n\nB. 1.0\n\nC. 1.5\n\nD. 2.5\n\nE. 3.0", "solution": "Electrons from cytosolic NADH produced in glycolysis are transferred to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to form glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) in the cytosol:\n$$\\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^{+} + \\text{DHAP} \\rightarrow \\text{NAD}^{+} + \\text{G3P}.$$\nG3P diffuses to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes:\n$$\\text{G3P} + \\text{FAD} \\rightarrow \\text{DHAP} + \\text{FADH}_{2}.$$\nThe resulting $\\text{FADH}_{2}$ donates electrons to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) in the electron transport chain, entering downstream of Complex I.
