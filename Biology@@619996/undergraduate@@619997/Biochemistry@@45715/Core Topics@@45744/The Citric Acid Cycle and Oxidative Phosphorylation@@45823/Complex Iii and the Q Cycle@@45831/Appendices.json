The cycle involves two distinct quinone-binding sites: the $Q_o$ site near the intermembrane space and the $Q_i$ site near the matrix. The electron transfer from the $Q_o$ site proceeds through two separate pathways: a high-potential chain (via a Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1) and a low-potential chain (via the two hemes of cytochrome b, namely $b_L$ and $b_H$).\n\nConsider a scenario where a population of mitochondria has a large supply of oxidized ubiquinone ($Q$) and oxidized cytochrome c, but contains exactly 3 molecules of ubiquinol ($\\text{QH}_2$) that are available for oxidation by Complex III.
