Under normal, tightly-coupled conditions, the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps $N_p = 10$ protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space for each molecule of NADH that is oxidized. The $F_1F_0$-ATP synthase uses this proton-motive force to produce ATP, consuming $N_a = 4$ protons for each molecule of ATP synthesized.\n\nA newly synthesized compound, 'protonophoricin', is added to the mitochondrial suspension. This molecule inserts into the inner mitochondrial membrane and acts as a protonophore, creating a passive leak channel for protons to flow back into the matrix, thus bypassing the ATP synthase. It is observed that in the presence of protonophoricin, the cellular environment demands and maintains the exact same total rate of ATP synthesis as in the normal, tightly-coupled state. The proton leak flux through protonophoricin is quantified and found to be directly proportional to the total proton pumping rate of the ETC.
