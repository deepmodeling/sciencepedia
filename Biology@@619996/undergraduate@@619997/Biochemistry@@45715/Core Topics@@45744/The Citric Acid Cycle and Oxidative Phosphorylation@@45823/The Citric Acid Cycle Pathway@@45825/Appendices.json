The experiment is designed to trace the metabolic fate of pyruvate that is directly transported into the mitochondrial matrix, thus bypassing all glycolytic steps. The goal is to quantify the production of key energy-carrying molecules generated from the complete oxidation of this pyruvate.\n\nConsidering the entire pathway starting from a single molecule of pyruvate, determine the net number of molecules of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) in its reduced form, Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide ($FADH_2$) in its reduced form, and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) that are produced. The process encompasses the reaction catalyzed by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) and one subsequent, complete turn of the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle).\n\nPresent your answer as a row matrix with three entries corresponding to the net yield of NADH, $FADH_2$, and GTP, in that specific order.", "solution": "We consider a single molecule of pyruvate already in the mitochondrial matrix, so no glycolytic yields are counted. The net yield sought includes the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and one complete turn of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) driven by the resulting acetyl-CoA.\n\nFirst, the PDC reaction converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, producing one reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide:\n$$\\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{CoA-SH} + NAD^+ \\rightarrow \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + CO_2 + NADH + H^+.$$\nFrom this step per pyruvate: $NADH$ yield is $1$, and there is no $FADH_2$ or $GTP$ produced.\n\nSecond, one acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle and, over one complete turn, the net redox and substrate-level phosphorylation yields are:\n$$\\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 3\\,NAD^+ + FAD + GDP + P_i + 2\\,H_2O \\rightarrow 2\\,CO_2 + 3\\,NADH + 3\\,H^+ + FADH_2 + GTP + \\text{CoA-SH}.$$\nFrom this step per acetyl-CoA (and hence per starting pyruvate): $NADH$ yield is $3$, $FADH_2$ yield is $1$, and $GTP$ yield is $1$.\n\nSumming the contributions from PDC and the citric acid cycle for one starting pyruvate gives the net yields:\n- $NADH$: $1$ (PDC) $+\\,3$ (TCA) $= 4$,\n- $FADH_2$: $0$ (PDC) $+\\,1$ (TCA) $= 1$,\n- $GTP$: $0$ (PDC) $+\\,1$ (TCA) $= 1$.\n\nTherefore, the row matrix in the order $NADH$, $FADH_2$, $GTP$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}4 & 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}4 & 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2081638"}, {"introduction": "The citric acid cycle is not just an abstract diagram; it's a dynamic process where a disruption in any single step can have profound physiological consequences.

In the normal pathway segment: succinate is oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase to form fumarate, and fumarase then converts fumarate to malate, which is subsequently oxidized to oxaloacetate.\n\nA decrease in fumarase catalytic activity reduces the rate of conversion of fumarate to malate. By the basic principle of enzyme kinetics in a metabolic pathway, when the catalytic step for a given substrate is impaired, the immediate substrate of the defective enzyme accumulates, while the immediate product is depleted. Therefore:\n- The substrate of fumarase (fumarate) accumulates.\n- The product of fumarase (malate) decreases.\n- Upstream intermediates (such as succinate) may show secondary changes due to altered flux, but the direct and primary accumulation occurs at the blocked step’s substrate.\n- More distant intermediates like citrate or oxaloacetate are not the primary site of accumulation and would be expected to decrease or vary indirectly due to reduced downstream flux.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Succinate: upstream; not the direct substrate of the defective step, so not the primary accumulation.\n- Malate: product of the blocked step; expected to decrease.\n- Fumarate: immediate substrate of the defective step; expected to accumulate.\n- Citrate and oxaloacetate: distant from the block; not the direct accumulation.\n\nThus, fumarate accumulates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2081675"}, {"introduction": "While we can quantify the inputs and outputs of the citric acid cycle, a deeper understanding comes from tracking the fate of individual atoms as they journey through the pathway. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2081662] uses isotopic labeling to follow the carbons from acetyl-CoA through one full turn of the cycle. This practice reveals a non-intuitive but crucial concept regarding molecular symmetry and the retention of carbons within the cycle's intermediates, challenging a common misconception that entering carbons are immediately lost as $CO_2$.", "problem": "In a biochemical investigation, a sample of isolated and actively respiring mitochondria is provided with all necessary substrates for the citric acid cycle. The cycle is initiated by supplying acetyl-CoA that has been isotopically labeled with carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$) specifically at its methyl carbon. The other substrate, oxaloacetate, is unlabeled. The system is allowed to proceed through exactly one complete turn of the citric acid cycle, starting with the condensation of the labeled acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate and ending with the regeneration of one molecule of oxaloacetate. For the purpose of this problem, use the standard chemical numbering for oxaloacetate, where $C_1$ is the carbon of the carboxyl group adjacent to the keto group, $C_2$ is the keto-carbon, $C_3$ is the methylene carbon, and $C_4$ is the carbon of the terminal carboxyl group (HOOC(4)-CH2(3)-C(=O)(2)-COOH(1)).\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the fate of the $^{14}\\text{C}$ label at the conclusion of this single turn?\n\nA.

The $^{14}\\text{C}$ will be found exclusively in the $C_2$ position (keto-carbon) of the regenerated oxaloacetate.", "solution": "We are given acetyl-CoA labeled at its methyl carbon (the acetyl $C_2$) and unlabeled oxaloacetate (OAA) with the specified numbering: OAA $C_1$ is the carboxyl carbon adjacent to the keto group, OAA $C_2$ is the keto carbon, OAA $C_3$ is the methylene carbon, and OAA $C_4$ is the terminal carboxyl carbon.\n\nStep 1: Citrate synthase forms citrate by condensation of the enol(ate) of acetyl-CoA with the carbonyl carbon (OAA $C_2$). The new C–C bond is formed between the acetyl methyl carbon (labeled acetyl $C_2$) and OAA $C_2$. No carbons are lost; this step only reorganizes bonding. Thus, both acetyl carbons enter the six-carbon citrate skeleton distinctly labeled by origin.\n\nStep 2: Aconitase isomerizes citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate without carbon loss. Carbon positions are conserved with respect to origin; no decarboxylation occurs here.\n\nStep 3: Isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate with release of one $CO_2$. The carbon released at this stage in the first turn is derived from the original OAA, not from acetyl-CoA. This is a standard consequence of the mapping of carbons in the tricarboxylic acid: in the first turn, neither of the two acetyl-derived carbons is released as $CO_2$. Therefore, statement A is false for the first turn.\n\nStep 4: The $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes a second oxidative decarboxylation to succinyl-CoA with release of another $CO_2$. In the first turn, this $CO_2$ is also derived from OAA, not from acetyl-CoA. Thus, statement B is false for the first turn.\n\nStep 5: The two acetyl-derived carbons persist into succinyl-CoA and then succinate. At the succinate stage, the two carbons originating from acetyl-CoA occupy the two equivalent inner methylene positions of succinate (succinate $C_2$ and $C_3$). Because succinate is a symmetric molecule, these two positions are chemically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Conversion of succinate to fumarate (succinate dehydrogenase) and hydration to malate (fumarase) are stereospecific transformations, but the symmetry of succinate permits binding in two orientations that are related by a 180-degree rotation. As a result, across a population of molecules, the single labeled acetyl methyl carbon is carried with equal probability into either the $C_2$ or the $C_3$ position of malate. Malate dehydrogenase then oxidizes malate at $C_2$ to regenerate OAA, placing the label at OAA $C_2$ if it was at malate $C_2$, or at OAA $C_3$ if it was at malate $C_3$. Because of the prior symmetry and the equal likelihood of the two binding orientations, the label is equally distributed between OAA $C_2$ (keto carbon) and OAA $C_3$ (methylene carbon) after exactly one turn.\n\nStep 7: Therefore:\n- The label is not released as $CO_2$ at either decarboxylation in the first turn (rules out A and B).\n- It is not found exclusively at OAA $C_4$ (rules out C).\n- It is not found exclusively at OAA $C_2$ (rules out E).\n- It is equally distributed between OAA $C_2$ and $C_3$ (supports D).\n\nHence, the correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2081662"}]}
