This process is crucial for aerobic respiration. Electrons are delivered to Complex IV by a mobile protein carrier called cytochrome c. The core of cytochrome c contains a heme group where an iron atom cycles between its reduced ferrous state (Fe²⁺) and its oxidized ferric state (Fe³⁺), allowing it to function as a single-electron carrier. The electrons donated by cytochrome c are used by Complex IV to reduce diatomic molecular oxygen (O₂) to water (H₂O).\n\nConsidering the complete reduction of a single molecule of O₂ within Complex IV, how many individual, single-electron transfers from separate molecules of reduced cytochrome c are required?\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 6\n\nE. 8", "solution": "Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) catalyzes the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water.

It catalyzes the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, the final electron acceptor. This highly exergonic reaction is coupled to the pumping of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, thus contributing to the generation of the proton-motive force (PMF). The proton transport occurs through specialized channels within the enzyme complex.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed on Complex IV. This mutation specifically targets and neutralizes a single, critical aspartate residue located within one of the primary proton-conducting channels. The mutation replaces the aspartate with an alanine, an amino acid with a non-polar, non-ionizable side chain. The overall three-dimensional structure of the complex and the integrity of its redox-active centers (heme groups and copper ions) are not significantly altered by this single amino acid substitution.\n\nBased on your understanding of bioenergetics and enzyme mechanisms, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this mutation on the function of the modified Complex IV?\n\nA.

A conserved aspartate in a primary channel acts as a critical protonatable site enabling proton transfer by a Grotthuss-like mechanism and gating. Replacing this aspartate with alanine removes the ionizable carboxylate, thereby disrupting efficient proton conduction through that channel without directly perturbing the redox-active centers.\n\nConsequences:\n- Proton pumping requires an intact proton pathway. Disabling a critical acidic residue in a primary channel will abolish or markedly diminish proton pumping, thus significantly decreasing the contribution of Complex IV to $\\Delta p$.\n- Electron transfer through the heme and copper centers can remain largely intact when their structures and redox properties are preserved. Chemical protons for oxygen reduction can still be supplied via the alternative channel (e.g., the K-channel) for at least part of the catalytic cycle, so turnover of electron transfer can persist. Although some decrease in the maximal turnover rate can occur due to perturbed proton delivery kinetics, the primary effect is decoupling of proton pumping from electron flow rather than complete inhibition of electron transport.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- B and C predict complete inhibition of electron transfer, which is not expected when redox centers and overall structure are intact.\n- D predicts complete loss of PMF contribution and a significant decrease in electron transport; while pumping can be lost, the dominant and most direct effect is on pumping, not necessarily a large drop to electron transfer per se.\n- E contradicts fundamental energetics.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that electron transport remains largely intact while proton pumping (and therefore contribution to the proton-motive force) is significantly decreased.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2036935"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the stoichiometry of electron flow [@problem_id:2036974] and the mechanistic coupling of proton pumping [@problem_id:2036935], we can now quantify the energetic transactions involved.
