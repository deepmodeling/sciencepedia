When intermediates of the cycle are withdrawn for the synthesis of other molecules (e.g., amino acids or glucose), they must be replenished through processes known as anaplerotic reactions. One such vital replenishment pathway begins with the three-carbon molecule pyruvate.\n\nConsider the biochemical pathway that converts one molecule of pyruvate into one molecule of malate to restore the pool of Citric Acid Cycle intermediates. Calculate the net number of high-energy phosphate bonds required for this conversion. For the purpose of this calculation, consider the cleavage of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) as the consumption of one high-energy bond, the cleavage of ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate ($PP_i$) as the consumption of two high-energy bonds, and the cleavage of GTP to GDP and $P_i$ as the consumption of one high-energy bond.", "solution": "The canonical anaplerotic conversion of pyruvate to malate proceeds via two reactions:\n\n1) Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (biotin-dependent), which requires ATP:\n$$\\text{pyruvate} + HCO_{3}^{-} + ATP \\rightarrow \\text{oxaloacetate} + ADP + P_{i}.$$\nBy the stated convention, ATP cleavage to ADP and $P_{i}$ consumes one high-energy phosphate bond.\n\n2) Reduction of oxaloacetate to malate by malate dehydrogenase:\n$$\\text{oxaloacetate} + NADH + H^{+} \\rightarrow \\text{malate} + NAD^{+}.$$\nThis step uses reducing equivalents and does not consume any high-energy phosphate bonds.\n\nSumming the two reactions and canceling the intermediate oxaloacetate gives the net transformation:\n$$\\text{pyruvate} + HCO_{3}^{-} + ATP + NADH + H^{+} \\rightarrow \\text{malate} + ADP + P_{i} + NAD^{+}.$$\n\nFrom this net equation, exactly one ATP has been hydrolyzed to ADP and $P_{i}$, corresponding to the consumption of one high-energy phosphate bond.

Anaplerosis refers to the replenishment of intermediates in metabolic pathways, particularly the Citric Acid Cycle (TCA). The primary anaplerotic reaction in these cells is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, which synthesizes oxaloacetate from pyruvate and bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$).\n\nThe kinetic properties of pyruvate carboxylase are well-characterized.
