These core units are connected by strands of linker DNA. The average length of a linker DNA segment connecting two adjacent core units is 53 bp.\n\nThe team has isolated a specific, contiguous fragment of this chromatin for further analysis.

This practice explores the crucial role of electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged DNA backbone and the positively charged histone proteins. By considering how a high-salt environment affects this structure, you'll gain practical insight into a core biochemical principle that is frequently exploited in laboratory techniques to deconstruct and analyze chromatin [@problem_id:2309179].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying the structure of chromatin isolated from eukaryotic cells. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of a segment of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins (a histone octamer). The researcher suspends a sample of purified nucleosomes in a low-salt buffer, which is known to maintain their structural integrity. To investigate the forces stabilizing this complex, the researcher then transfers the nucleosomes into a solution with a very high salt concentration (2 M NaCl). Which of the following outcomes is the most likely and immediate consequence of this change in ionic strength on the nucleosome structure?\n\nA. The covalent bonds holding the DNA backbone together will break, leading to fragmentation of the DNA while it remains attached to the histone octamer.\n\nB. The high salt concentration will strengthen the hydrophobic interactions between nucleosomes, causing them to aggregate and precipitate out of solution without affecting their individual structure.\n\nC. The salt ions will shield the electrostatic charges on both the DNA and histone proteins, weakening their mutual attraction and causing the DNA to dissociate from the histone octamer.\n\nD. The histone proteins will undergo denaturation and unfold, while the DNA molecule will condense into a tightly coiled structure independent of the histones.\n\nE. The high salt concentration will exclusively disrupt the interactions between the individual histone proteins, causing the octamer to fall apart into monomers, but the DNA will remain wrapped around the dissociated histone monomers.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of a high salt concentration on the stability of a nucleosome. To solve this, we must first understand the chemical nature of the components of a nucleosome and the primary forces that hold them together.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the components of the nucleosome.\nThe nucleosome is composed of two main components: DNA and histone proteins.\n- **Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA):** The backbone of the DNA molecule contains phosphate groups. At physiological pH, these phosphate groups are deprotonated and carry a significant negative charge. This makes the DNA molecule a polyanion.\n- **Histone Proteins:** The core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are characterized by a high content of basic amino acids, particularly lysine and arginine. At physiological pH, the side chains of these amino acids are protonated and carry a positive charge. This gives the histone octamer a net positive charge.\n\nStep 2: Identify the primary stabilizing force.\nThe primary attractive force that holds the negatively charged DNA wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer is the electrostatic attraction between these opposite charges. This is a strong, non-covalent interaction that is fundamental to the formation and stability of the nucleosome.\n\nStep 3: Consider the effect of adding a high concentration of salt.\nA high concentration of salt, such as 2 M NaCl, will dissociate completely in the aqueous solution into a large number of sodium cations ($Na^{+}$) and chloride anions ($Cl^{-}$). These ions will distribute themselves throughout the solution.\n\nStep 4: Determine how these ions affect the electrostatic interactions.\nThe mobile salt ions will interact with the charged components of the nucleosome.\n- The positive $Na^{+}$ ions will be attracted to the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA backbone.\n- The negative $Cl^{-}$ ions will be attracted to the positively charged residues (lysine, arginine) on the histone proteins.\nThis formation of a cloud of counter-ions around the charged macromolecules is known as charge shielding or charge screening. The dense layer of ions effectively neutralizes the charges on the DNA and the histones, preventing them from \"seeing\" each other.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the effect of charge shielding on nucleosome integrity.\nWith the strong electrostatic attraction between the DNA and the histone octamer severely weakened by the charge shielding effect, the interaction is no longer strong enough to hold the complex together against the thermal motion of the molecules. As a result, the DNA unwraps and dissociates from the histone octamer. This is the fundamental principle behind using high-salt buffers in biochemical procedures to separate DNA from histone proteins.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n- **A:** High salt concentrations do not break the strong covalent phosphodiester bonds of the DNA backbone. This is incorrect.\n- **B:** While high salt can lead to \"salting out\" and precipitation of proteins, the primary effect on the *internal structure* of the nucleosome is the disruption of the DNA-histone interaction. This option misidentifies the primary effect.\n- **C:** This option correctly describes the mechanism of charge shielding by salt ions, the resulting weakening of electrostatic attraction, and the dissociation of DNA from the histone octamer. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n- **D:** NaCl is not a denaturant. It does not typically cause proteins to unfold. The primary effect is on intermolecular forces, not the secondary or tertiary structure of the proteins themselves. This is incorrect.\n- **E:** While the histone octamer itself is also held together by interactions that can be disrupted by salt, the DNA-histone interaction is the first to be overcome, leading to the loss of the nucleosome unit. The octamer itself typically dissociates into an (H3-H4)â‚‚ tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers, not directly into monomers, and this happens as or after the DNA dissociates. This option incorrectly describes the sequence and nature of disassembly.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and immediate consequence is the dissociation of the DNA from the histone core due to the screening of electrostatic charges.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2309179"}, {"introduction": "Chromatin is not a static packaging system; it is a dynamic structure that regulates gene expression through a so-called \"histone code\" of chemical modifications. This problem challenges you to think like a molecular biologist, predicting the functional outcome of a mutation that mimics a key post-translational modification. The exercise will help you connect the chemical properties of histone tails directly to their critical role in controlling whether genes are switched on or off [@problem_id:2309156].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, DNA is tightly packaged around a core of histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. The N-terminal tails of these histones, such as histone H3, extend from the nucleosome core and are subject to various post-translational modifications that regulate gene expression. One such critical modification is the acetylation of specific lysine residues. The addition of an acetyl group by a Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) neutralizes the positive charge on the lysine's side chain. This change is associated with a more open chromatin structure and gene activation. Conversely, the removal of this acetyl group by a Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) restores the positive charge, leading to a more condensed chromatin structure and gene repression.\n\nA molecular biology student is studying the regulation of a specific gene, `Gene Z`, which is normally repressed in differentiated muscle cells but can be activated under certain signaling conditions. The student engineers a line of these muscle cells to express a mutant form of histone H3 where a specific lysine residue, K27 (the 27th amino acid from the N-terminus), crucial for regulating `Gene Z`, is replaced by an alanine. Alanine is a small, uncharged amino acid. Assume this mutation is incorporated into all histone H3 proteins in the cell.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence of this K27-to-Alanine mutation on the regulation of `Gene Z` in these muscle cells?\n\nA. `Gene Z` will be permanently silenced because the site for activating acetylation is lost.\n\nB. The regulation of `Gene Z` will be unaffected because alanine is structurally similar to an unacetylated lysine.\n\nC. `Gene Z` will show a higher basal level of expression and will be resistant to repression by HDACs.\n\nD. `Gene Z` will become hyper-repressed because the absence of the lysine residue disrupts the binding of transcription factors.\n\nE. The expression of `Gene Z` will oscillate rapidly between on and off states due to chromatin instability.", "solution": "We first recall the regulatory chemistry of lysine residues on histone H3 N-terminal tails. Lysine side chains are positively charged at physiological pH, promoting electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged DNA backbone. Acetylation of a lysine by a HAT neutralizes that positive charge, weakening histone-DNA interactions, favoring a more open chromatin conformation and gene activation. Deacetylation by an HDAC restores the positive charge, strengthening histone-DNA interactions and favoring repression.\n\nConsider the specific residue H3K27. In wild-type cells:\n- The unacetylated state of K27 is positively charged and can contribute to repression.\n- Acetylation of K27 neutralizes the positive charge and supports activation.\n- K27 can also be methylated (for example, to H3K27me3), a repressive mark recognized by Polycomb complexes, further promoting silencing.\n\nNow evaluate the K27-to-alanine substitution. Alanine is a small, uncharged residue lacking the lysine side chain amine. Therefore:\n1. Charge consequence: The positive charge contributed by lysine is eliminated and cannot be toggled by acetylation or deacetylation. With respect to electrostatics, this mimics a constitutively acetylated state at that position because the site is permanently neutral rather than positively charged.\n2. Enzymatic consequence: The residue is no longer a substrate for HATs or HDACs (no lysine amine to acetylate or deacetylate), so HDAC-dependent repression via this residue is not possible.\n3. Repressive methylation consequence: The lysine is also no longer a substrate for methyltransferases (e.g., PRC2), abolishing H3K27 methylation and thus preventing Polycomb-mediated repression. This further biases the locus away from repression.\n\nIntegrating these effects at the locus controlling Gene Z, which is normally repressed in differentiated muscle cells but can be activated under certain signals, the mutation would be expected to:\n- Increase basal openness of chromatin at K27 due to the permanent loss of positive charge.\n- Resist repression mechanisms that depend on HDAC activity at K27 (no deacetylation possible) and also resist K27 methylation-dependent repression.\n- Consequently, Gene Z should show higher basal expression and be less repressible by HDACs.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is incorrect because although the acetylation site is lost, the positive charge is also lost; this does not cause permanent silencing and in fact favors activation.\n- B is incorrect because alanine is neutral, unlike unacetylated lysine, which is positively charged.\n- C is correct: higher basal expression and resistance to HDAC-mediated repression are the expected outcomes.\n- D is incorrect; while some reader proteins may lose binding, the dominant effect is loss of positive charge and loss of repressive methylation, which does not lead to hyper-repression.\n- E is unsupported; there is no basis for rapid oscillation solely due to this substitution.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2309156"}]}
