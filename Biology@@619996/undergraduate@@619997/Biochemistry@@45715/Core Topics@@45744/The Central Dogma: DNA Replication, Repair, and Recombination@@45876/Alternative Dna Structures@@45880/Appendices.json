This fragment is exactly 100 base pairs (bp) in length. Under standard physiological conditions, this DNA fragment exists in the canonical $B$-form conformation. The axial rise, which is the distance between consecutive base pairs along the helical axis, for $B$-DNA is 0.34 nm per base pair.\n\nTo investigate alternative DNA structures, the researcher alters the hydration level of the sample, which induces a complete conformational transition of the entire fragment from the $B$-form to the $A$-form.

State the governing principle: Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy detects differences in absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light that arise from chiral arrangements of chromophores. For nucleic acids, the CD spectrum is highly sensitive to the helical conformation (handedness and base-stacking geometry). Therefore, characteristic peak positions and signs (positive/negative molar ellipticity) serve as fingerprints for specific DNA helices.\n\n2. Recall canonical CD signatures:\n- $B$-form DNA (right-handed): large positive band near $275\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and negative band near $245\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- $A$-form DNA (right-handed, dehydrated conditions): typically a strong positive band near $260\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a negative band around $210\\ \\mathrm{nm}$; it does not show a prominent negative band near $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- $Z$-form DNA (left-handed): characteristic negative band near $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a positive band near $260\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, reflecting inversion of long-wavelength CD relative to $B$-form due to left-handed helical geometry and altered base-stacking.\n- G-quadruplexes: CD depends on strand orientation; parallel structures often show a positive band near $260\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a negative band near $240\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, while antiparallel structures usually show a positive band near $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a negative band near $260\\ \\mathrm{nm}$; a strong negative band near $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ is not typical.\n- A-T rich cruciform structures: require specific palindromic A-T sequences and do not match the GC-alternating composition; they do not exhibit the $Z$-DNA-like signature.\n\n3. Compare observed spectrum to fingerprints: The observed CD spectrum shows a prominent negative peak near $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a positive peak near $260\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. This directly matches the $Z$-form DNA signature and is inconsistent with the $B$-form (which would show a positive near $275\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a negative near $245\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) and with the $A$-form (lacking a negative near $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$). It is also inconsistent with standard G-quadruplex patterns, which would not present a strong negative band at $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n4. Consider sequence and solution conditions: The polymer $(\\mathrm{dG}-\\mathrm{dC})_{12}$ is an alternating G-C sequence, a classic substrate for $B$-to-$Z$ transitions. High ionic strength (high $\\mathrm{NaCl}$) stabilizes $Z$-DNA by screening electrostatic repulsion along the phosphate backbone and favoring the syn-anti base conformational pattern characteristic of $Z$-DNA. Thus, both the sequence context and ionic conditions strongly favor $Z$-form.\n\n5. Exclude alternatives based on biochemical plausibility:\n- Standard $B$-form DNA: contradicted by the observed negative at $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and positive at $260\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- $A$-form DNA: typically requires dehydrating conditions; the spectral signature does not include a negative at $295\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- G-quadruplex: requires G-rich runs without alternating C; the sequence $(\\mathrm{dG}-\\mathrm{dC})_{12}$ and duplex context under high salt do not support quadruplex formation, and the CD pattern is inconsistent.\n- A-T rich cruciform: incompatible with the GC-alternating sequence.\n\n6.

This final exercise connects a local $B$-to-$Z$ transition to the global topology of DNA, governed by the linking number ($Lk$), twist ($Tw$), and writhe ($Wr$). You will apply the fundamental relationship $Lk = Tw + Wr$ to see how flipping a small DNA segment to a left-handed helix can relax negative supercoiling, a critical mechanism in gene regulation and DNA packaging [@problem_id:2030587].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, circular, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule known as a plasmid. The plasmid is covalently closed, meaning there are no breaks in either of the sugar-phosphate backbones. Initially, the entire plasmid exists in the standard right-handed $B$-DNA conformation, which has 10.5 base pairs per turn.\n\nUnder specific ionic conditions, a short segment of 12 base pairs within this plasmid undergoes a conformational change, transitioning from the $B$-DNA form to the left-handed $Z$-DNA form. The $Z$-DNA structure is characterized by a left-handed helix with 12.0 base pairs per turn.\n\nFor a DNA molecule, the \"twist\" ($Tw$) is a measure of the number of times the two strands are wound around each other along the helical axis. By convention, right-handed helices have positive twist and left-handed helices have negative twist. The \"writhe\" ($Wr$) is a measure of the supercoiling, describing how many times the duplex axis crosses over itself in three-dimensional space. The sum of the twist and the writhe defines a fundamental topological property of a closed circular DNA molecule.\n\nCalculate the change in the total twist ($\\Delta Tw$) and the corresponding change in the writhe ($\\Delta Wr$) for the entire plasmid as a result of this 12-base-pair segment's conformational flip.\n\nPresent your answers for the ordered pair $(\\Delta Tw, \\Delta Wr)$ as a row matrix of numerical values, with each value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "For a covalently closed circular DNA, the linking number satisfies $Lk = Tw + Wr$ and is a topological invariant in the absence of strand breaks and enzymatic action, so $\\Delta Lk = 0$ and therefore $\\Delta Wr = -\\Delta Tw$.\n\nTwist is additive along the contour. Only the 12-base-pair segment changes conformation; the rest remains B-DNA and contributes the same twist before and after, so the net change in $Tw$ equals the change from this segment.\n\nInitially (B-DNA), the 12-base-pair segment has right-handed twist\n$$\nTw_{\\text{initial, seg}} = \\frac{12}{10.5} = \\frac{24}{21} = \\frac{8}{7}.\n$$\nAfter the flip (Z-DNA), the same segment has left-handed twist with 12 base pairs per turn,\n$$\nTw_{\\text{final, seg}} = -\\frac{12}{12} = -1.\n$$\nHence the total change in twist for the plasmid is\n$$\n\\Delta Tw = Tw_{\\text{final}} - Tw_{\\text{initial}} = \\left(-1\\right) - \\frac{8}{7} = -\\frac{15}{7}.\n$$\nConservation of linking number gives\n$$\n\\Delta Wr = -\\Delta Tw = \\frac{15}{7}.\n$$\nNumerically, with three significant figures,\n$$\n\\Delta Tw \\approx -2.14, \\quad \\Delta Wr \\approx 2.14.\n$$\nThe ordered pair is presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}-2.14 & 2.14\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2030587"}]}
