Before exploring the intricate functions of nucleic acids, it is crucial to master the vocabulary used to describe their fundamental components.\n\nThis first exercise focuses on the distinction between a nucleoside (a base linked to a sugar) and a nucleotide (a nucleoside with one or more phosphate groups). By working through this problem [@problem_id:2053439], you will practice applying the standard naming conventions that are essential for accurately interpreting and communicating biochemical information.", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the mechanisms of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication in a cell-free system. The system contains all the necessary enzymes and building blocks for synthesizing new DNA strands. To monitor the process, the researcher introduces a specific precursor molecule into the reaction. This precursor is a nucleoside, which consists of a nitrogenous base covalently bonded to a sugar molecule. The specific nucleoside used in this experiment is composed of the purine base adenine linked to a deoxyribose sugar. In the first step of its metabolic pathway towards DNA incorporation, this nucleoside is phosphorylated by a kinase enzyme, which attaches a single phosphate group to the sugar moiety, converting it into a mononucleotide.\n\nAccording to the standard nomenclature conventions in biochemistry, what is the correct three-letter abbreviation for this newly formed mononucleotide?\n\nA. AMP\n\nB. dADP\n\nC. dAMP\n\nD. ATP\n\nE. Ade-P", "solution": "We identify the introduced precursor as a nucleoside composed of adenine linked to a deoxyribose sugar; this is deoxyadenosine. The first metabolic step described is phosphorylation by a kinase that adds a single phosphate group to the sugar moiety, converting the nucleoside into a nucleotide with one phosphate group, i.e., a mononucleotide (monophosphate).\n\nAccording to biochemical nomenclature:\n- The presence of deoxyribose is indicated by the prefix “d”.\n- The base adenine is represented by “A”.\n- A single phosphate (monophosphate) is indicated by “MP”.\n\nTherefore, deoxyadenosine monophosphate is abbreviated as dAMP.\n\nChecking the options:\n- AMP refers to adenosine monophosphate (ribose, not deoxyribose), so incorrect.\n- dADP refers to deoxyadenosine diphosphate (two phosphates), so incorrect.\n- dAMP correctly denotes deoxyadenosine monophosphate, so correct.\n- ATP is adenosine triphosphate (ribose, three phosphates), so incorrect.\n- Ade-P is not a standard abbreviation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is dAMP, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2053439"}, {"introduction": "Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, is more than just an abstract carrier of genetic information; it is a physical polymer with defined dimensions and structure. Understanding the relationship between the sequence of a gene and the physical length of the corresponding DNA molecule is a key skill in molecular biology and biophysics.\n\nThis practice problem [@problem_id:2053443] challenges you to translate the informational content of a gene—the number of amino acids in the protein it encodes—into the physical contour length of the DNA segment. You will apply the standard parameters of the B-form DNA double helix to connect the world of genetic code to the nanometer-scale reality of the molecule.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the physical properties of a gene that codes for a small, functional protein. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain containing 250 amino acid residues. This protein is encoded by a continuous segment of a chromosome, meaning it contains no introns. The Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the chromosome is in a relaxed, canonical B-form conformation. In this B-form, the distance between consecutive base pairs when measured along the central axis of the helix, known as the axial rise, is 0.34 nm.\n\nAssuming the gene segment exclusively contains the coding sequence for the 250 amino acids plus the necessary signal for translation termination, calculate the contour length of this double-stranded DNA segment.

For a polypeptide of 250 amino acids, the coding region contributes $3 \\times 250$ nucleotides. Translation termination requires one stop codon, which adds $3$ nucleotides but does not encode an amino acid. Therefore, the total number of nucleotides in one strand of the gene segment is\n$$N_{\\text{nt}}=3 \\times 250 + 3 = 753.$$\nFor double-stranded DNA, the number of base pairs equals the number of nucleotides in one strand, so\n$$N_{\\text{bp}}=753.$$\nIn relaxed B-form DNA, the contour length along the helix axis is the number of base pairs multiplied by the axial rise per base pair $d=0.34\\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$L = N_{\\text{bp}} \\times d = 753 \\times 0.34\\,\\text{nm} = 256.02\\,\\text{nm}.$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives\n$$L \\approx 256\\,\\text{nm}.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{256}$$", "id": "2053443"}, {"introduction": "The chemical behavior of biomolecules within the aqueous, buffered environment of a cell is largely dictated by their electrical charge.
