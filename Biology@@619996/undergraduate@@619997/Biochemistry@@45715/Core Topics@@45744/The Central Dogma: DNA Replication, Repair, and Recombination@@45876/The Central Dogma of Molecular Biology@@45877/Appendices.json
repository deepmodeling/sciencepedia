A critical aspect of understanding gene expression is appreciating how the location of a mutation determines its impact. This problem [@problem_id:1471651] challenges you to compare the effects of a single nucleotide deletion within a non-coding intron versus a coding exon, providing a clear illustration of the critical concept of a 'frameshift' and its often drastic effect on protein structure and function.", "problem": "A hypothetical eukaryotic gene, designated `ENZ-1`, codes for a critical enzyme involved in cellular respiration. The pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA) transcribed from `ENZ-1` is known to contain five exons and four introns in an alternating sequence. Two distinct, single-nucleotide deletion mutations have been identified in a laboratory study:\n\n*   **Mutation A**: A deletion of a single nucleotide located precisely in the middle of the second intron. Assume this deletion does not affect the splice-site recognition sequences at the intron's boundaries.\n*   **Mutation B**: A deletion of a single nucleotide located precisely in the middle of the third exon.\n\nConsidering the standard mechanisms of gene expression in eukaryotes, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected functional outcome for the enzyme synthesized from the gene containing **Mutation B**?\n\nA. The resulting enzyme will be identical in sequence and function to the wild-type enzyme.\n\nB. The resulting enzyme will likely be completely non-functional due to a major alteration of its amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation site.\n\nC. The resulting enzyme will be fully functional but will be missing a single amino acid compared to the wild-type enzyme.\n\nD. The synthesis of the enzyme will be halted at the transcription stage, and no pre-mRNA will be produced.\n\nE. The resulting enzyme will be significantly shorter than the wild-type enzyme but will exhibit increased catalytic activity.", "solution": "We proceed step by step using standard principles of eukaryotic gene expression and the genetic code.\n\n1. In eukaryotes, transcription produces a pre-mRNA that contains exons and introns in the same order as the gene. Introns are removed and exons are ligated during splicing to generate the mature mRNA. Only exon sequences contribute to the open reading frame that is translated into protein.\n\n2. Codons are read in contiguous, nonoverlapping triplets by the ribosome. Therefore, the integrity of the reading frame depends on the coding sequence length being a multiple of three. Any insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three within an exon causes a frameshift, altering all downstream codons from the mutation site.\n\n3. For Mutation A (contextual contrast): a single-nucleotide deletion in the middle of an intron that does not affect the splice donor, splice acceptor, or essential intronic regulatory elements will be removed with the intron during splicing. Consequently, the mature mRNA coding sequence and the translated protein remain unchanged.\n\n4. For Mutation B (the queried case): a single-nucleotide deletion in the middle of the third exon will be retained in the mature mRNA, altering the coding sequence length by one nucleotide. Because one is not a multiple of three, this induces a frameshift starting at the deletion site.\n\n5. The frameshift has two principal consequences:\n   - The amino acid sequence from the mutation onward is extensively altered due to the new grouping of nucleotides into codons.\n   - A premature termination codon is very likely to appear downstream in the shifted frame. If the premature stop codon lies more than one exon-exon junction upstream of the final junction, the transcript is often targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, reducing protein production. If translated, the product is typically truncated and misfolded, lacking essential domains required for enzymatic function.\n\n6. Therefore, the most accurate functional outcome is that the enzyme produced from the gene carrying Mutation B will likely be completely non-functional due to the major alteration of its amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation site and probable truncation.\n\n7. Evaluating the options:\n   - A is incorrect because an exonic single-nucleotide deletion changes the reading frame and thus the protein sequence.\n   - B is correct, as a frameshift typically causes extensive downstream changes and loss of function.\n   - C is incorrect because a single-amino-acid deletion would require an in-frame deletion of three nucleotides, not one.\n   - D is incorrect because transcription proceeds; the mutation does not prevent pre-mRNA synthesis.\n   - E is incorrect because frameshifts commonly reduce or abolish activity; increased catalytic activity is not expected.\n\nThus, the best choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1471651"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the central dogma extends beyond deciphering static sequences; it also involves appreciating the dynamic nature of protein populations within a cell.
