A single cell from this mutant strain is isolated. At a specific locus on its chromosome, it possesses a standard Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) base pair.\n\nDuring the first round of DNA replication, a biosynthetic error occurs: on the strand where Guanine (G) serves as the template, DNA polymerase erroneously incorporates a Thymine (T) into the newly synthesized strand, creating a G-T mismatch. Assume that no other repair mechanism (such as base excision repair) corrects this specific mismatch before the next replication event.\n\nThis single cell and its subsequent progeny are allowed to undergo two full cycles of replication and cell division, resulting in a total of four granddaughter cells.

Hence, this mismatched duplex gives rise to one A-T and one G-C.\n- The correct G-C duplex replicates to two G-C duplexes.\n\nCollecting outcomes after two full cycles (four granddaughter genomes): one A-T and three G-C, so the fraction with a permanent A-T is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nAmong the provided options, this corresponds to B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2041390"}, {"introduction": "The genius of the *E. coli* MMR system lies not just in finding mismatches, but in knowing which of the two strands to fix. This practice explores that elegant mechanism of strand discrimination, which relies on the specific timing of DNA methylation [@problem_id:2041406]. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where this timing is disrupted, you will uncover why the transient, unmethylated state of a new DNA strand is the critical signal that directs the repair machinery to the correct location.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the mismatch repair (MMR) system serves as a crucial post-replicative error correction mechanism to ensure genomic fidelity. This system relies on a set of proteins, including MutS, MutL, and MutH, to identify and correct mismatched bases that were erroneously incorporated by DNA polymerase during replication. The cell distinguishes the newly synthesized daughter strand from the original template strand through a process involving DNA adenine methylase (Dam). Dam methylase adds a methyl group to the adenine base within the sequence 5'-GATC-3'. Following replication, there is a short time window during which the parental strand is methylated, but the newly synthesized daughter strand is not. This transient \"hemimethylated\" state is the signal used by the MMR system; specifically, the endonuclease MutH preferentially cleaves the unmethylated daughter strand to initiate the repair process.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* in which the Dam methylase enzyme has been modified. This modification causes it to act with extreme efficiency, methylating the GATC sites on the daughter strand almost instantaneously as it is synthesized. Consequently, the transient hemimethylated state that normally follows replication is effectively eliminated.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most probable primary consequence for the cell's genome as a result of this specific enzymatic alteration?\n\nA. The rate of spontaneous mutations would decrease, as the fully methylated DNA is more structurally stable and resistant to chemical damage.\n\nB. The mismatch repair system would become hyperactive, leading to widespread, non-specific degradation of the bacterial chromosome.\n\nC. The rate of spontaneous mutations would increase, as the repair machinery would be unable to distinguish the template from the daughter strand, leading to a roughly 50% chance of introducing the mutation permanently.\n\nD. DNA replication would be completely halted, as the progression of the replication fork requires the presence of hemimethylated DNA behind it.\n\nE. The MutS protein would no longer be able to bind to mismatched base pairs, thereby preventing the initiation of the entire repair process.", "solution": "- Principle: In wild-type cells, Dam methylase methylates adenines in 5'-GATC-3' sites. Immediately after replication, DNA is hemimethylated: the parental strand is methylated while the daughter strand is unmethylated. The MMR pathway uses strand discrimination based on this hemimethylation: MutS recognizes mismatches, MutL couples recognition to incision, and MutH introduces a nick specifically on the unmethylated daughter strand at a nearby hemimethylated GATC site. Repair then removes the nascent strand segment containing the mismatch and resynthesizes it using the parental (methylated) strand as the correct template.\n\n- Given modification: Dam methylase acts essentially instantaneously on the daughter strand, eliminating the hemimethylated state. Both strands at GATC sites become fully methylated immediately behind the replication fork.\n\n- Consequence for MMR initiation: MutH requires a hemimethylated GATC site to incise the unmethylated strand. With both strands methylated, MutH cannot discriminate and does not incise specifically. Thus, the canonical post-replicative MMR pathway is effectively disabled at these sites.\n\n- Outcome for mismatches: Mismatches arising during replication will not be preferentially corrected using the parental strand as the template. If any repair occurs without strand discrimination, correction becomes effectively random with respect to which base is retained. Therefore, for each mismatch, there is a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ that the mutation becomes fixed in the genome and a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ that the correct base is restored.\n\n- Primary genomic consequence: Loss of strand discrimination in MMR increases the spontaneous mutation rate (mutator phenotype). This directly rules out decreased mutation rate (A), hyperactive non-specific degradation (B), replication arrest (D), and loss of MutS binding (E), since MutS recognizes mismatches independently of methylation status; the defect lies in strand discrimination and incision by MutH.\n\n- Therefore, the most probable primary consequence is an increased spontaneous mutation rate due to failure to distinguish template from daughter strands, with approximately a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of fixation for each mismatch.\n\n- Correct choice: C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2041406"}, {"introduction": "We conclude with a thought-provoking paradox: can an attempt to repair DNA actually be more harmful than doing nothing at all? This problem presents a scenario where the MMR machinery is fully active but misdirected, using the correct parental strand as a guide to \"fix\" the error [@problem_id:2041403]. This exercise reveals the profound importance of accurate strand identification, demonstrating how a flawed repair process can actively drive mutations into the genome at an accelerated rate, creating a potent mutator phenotype.", "problem": "In prokaryotes such as *E. coli*, the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system plays a crucial role in maintaining genome fidelity by correcting errors made during DNA replication. This system distinguishes the newly synthesized daughter strand from the older parental template strand through a mechanism involving DNA methylation. The *dam* methylase enzyme methylates adenine residues within GATC sequences. For a short period following replication, the new strand remains unmethylated while the template strand is already methylated. The MMR machinery uses this methylation signal to identify and correct the base on the unmethylated new strand.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* in which the MMR system is altered. While it can still perfectly recognize base-pair mismatches, it has a critical defect: it now incorrectly identifies the methylated parental strand as the strand to be \"corrected\" and uses the erroneous, newly synthesized strand as the template for the repair.\n\nWhat is the most significant and direct consequence of this specific defect for the cell?\n\nA. The cell would enter a state of permanent cell cycle arrest because the repair system would be locked in a futile cycle of creating and trying to repair mismatches.\n\nB. The mismatch repair system would become completely inactive, resulting in a mutation rate identical to that of a cell completely lacking the mismatch repair machinery.\n\nC. The original mutation on the newly synthesized strand would be corrected, but the template strand would be needlessly nicked and repaired, wasting cellular energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nD. The mutation rate would become significantly higher than in a cell merely lacking mismatch repair, as replication errors would be actively and permanently incorporated into the parental DNA template.\n\nE. The cell would be unable to replicate its DNA, as the modified repair system would stall the replication fork at the site of any mismatch.", "solution": "Normal MMR in prokaryotes: after replication, the daughter strand is transiently unmethylated at GATC sites, whereas the parental strand is methylated. The MMR machinery recognizes a mismatch, identifies the unmethylated (daughter) strand as the erroneous strand, introduces a nick, removes a stretch encompassing the mismatch, and resynthesizes using the methylated parental strand as the template. This restores the correct base pairing and prevents fixation of replication errors.\n\nDefine $p$ as the per-site probability that DNA polymerase introduces a base-pair mismatch during replication. Consider the fate of such a mismatch under different scenarios:\n\n- No MMR present: the mismatch persists to the next round of replication. Each strand templates a daughter: one daughter molecule will carry the mutant base pair (fixing the mutation), and the other will carry the original correct base pair. Thus, the probability that a given mismatch becomes a fixed mutation is $P_{\\text{fix}|\\text{noMMR}}=\\frac{1}{2}$, and the per-site mutation rate contributed by replication errors is $r_{\\text{noMMR}} = p \\times \\frac{1}{2}$ (neglecting other pathways).\n\n- Inverted-strand-choice MMR (the mutant described): the system perfectly recognizes mismatches but erroneously selects the methylated parental strand as the one to excise, and uses the unmethylated daughter strand (which carries the replication error) as the template. Consequently, the repair synthesis writes the erroneous base into the parental strand, eliminating the mismatch by converting both strands to the mutant sequence. Therefore, for each recognized mismatch, the error is actively fixed as a mutation with probability\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}|\\text{invMMR}} = 1,\n$$\nand the per-site mutation rate from replication errors becomes\n$$\nr_{\\text{invMMR}} = p \\times 1.\n$$\nComparing to the absence of MMR,\n$$\n\\frac{r_{\\text{invMMR}}}{r_{\\text{noMMR}}} = \\frac{p}{p/2} = 2,\n$$\nso the mutation rate is higher than in a cell merely lacking MMR. In practice, it could be even higher if the erroneous repair patch synthesis introduces additional errors, but the key point is that the defect drives active and permanent incorporation of replication errors into the parental template.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: once the parental strand is overwritten to match the erroneous daughter, the mismatch disappears; there is no futile cycle.\n- B is incorrect: the system is not inactive; it is actively repairing in the wrong direction, which is worse than inactivity.\n- C is incorrect: the original mutation is not corrected; it is propagated into the parental strand.\n- D is correct: replication errors are actively and permanently incorporated, producing a mutation rate higher than that seen when MMR is simply absent.\n- E is incorrect: MMR acts post-replicatively in this context and would not stall the replication fork.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and direct consequence is a markedly elevated mutation rate due to active fixation of replication errors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2041403"}]}
