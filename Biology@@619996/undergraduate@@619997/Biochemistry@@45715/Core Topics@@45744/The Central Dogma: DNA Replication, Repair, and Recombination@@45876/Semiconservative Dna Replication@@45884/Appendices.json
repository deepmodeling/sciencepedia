{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The landmark experiment by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl provided definitive evidence for semiconservative DNA replication. This practice revisits their classic experimental design with a crucial twist. By introducing a heat denaturation step after one round of replication, this problem challenges you to think beyond the double helix and consider the composition and fate of the individual DNA strands, reinforcing the fundamental principle that each new DNA molecule consists of one parent strand and one progeny strand [@problem_id:2075430].", "problem": "In a modern re-creation of the Meselson-Stahl experiment, a culture of bacteria is grown for many generations in a growth medium where the sole source of nitrogen is the heavy isotope, ${}^{15}\\text{N}$. The bacteria are then harvested and abruptly transferred to a new medium containing only the light isotope, ${}^{14}\\text{N}$, as the nitrogen source. They are allowed to grow in this new medium for a duration equivalent to exactly one round of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication.\n\nFollowing this single replication cycle, the total DNA is extracted from the bacterial population. This extracted DNA is then subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature and duration sufficient to cause complete denaturation, separating all double-stranded DNA into single strands. Finally, this mixture of single-stranded DNA is analyzed using equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately predicts the banding pattern that would be observed after centrifugation?\n\nA. A single band located at a position of intermediate density, halfway between the heavy ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ and light ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ positions.\n\nB. A single band located at the heavy density position, corresponding to pure ${}^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\nC. A single band located at the light density position, corresponding to pure ${}^{14}\\text{N}$.\n\nD. Two distinct bands of equal intensity: one at the heavy density position and one at the light density position.\n\nE. Three distinct bands: one at the heavy density position, one at the intermediate density position, and one at the light density position.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the fate of the DNA strands through replication and denaturation, in accordance with the principle of semiconservative replication.\n\nStep 1: The initial state of the DNA.\nThe bacteria are initially grown for many generations in a medium containing ${}^{15}\\text{N}$. This ensures that all nitrogen-containing molecules in the cell, including the bases of the DNA, are synthesized with this heavy isotope. Therefore, the entire population of bacterial DNA is uniformly labeled with ${}^{15}\\text{N}$. Each double-stranded DNA molecule consists of two heavy strands. We can represent this state as ${}^{15}\\text{N}$-${}^{15}\\text{N}$ duplexes. If centrifuged at this stage, this DNA would form a single \"heavy\" band.\n\nStep 2: One round of semiconservative replication in ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ medium.\nThe bacteria are transferred to a medium where the only nitrogen source is the light isotope, ${}^{14}\\text{N}$. They undergo one round of replication. According to the semiconservative model of DNA replication, the parent double helix unwinds, and each of its strands serves as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand.\nThe original strands are made of ${}^{15}\\text{N}$. The new strands must be synthesized using the precursors available in the medium, which are made with ${}^{14}\\text{N}$.\nConsequently, after one replication cycle, every new DNA molecule will be a hybrid. Each molecule will consist of one original \"heavy\" strand (containing ${}^{15}\\text{N}$) and one newly synthesized \"light\" strand (containing ${}^{14}\\text{N}$). We can represent this as a population of ${}^{15}\\text{N}$-${}^{14}\\text{N}$ duplexes. In a standard Meselson-Stahl experiment (without the denaturation step), these hybrid molecules would form a single band at an intermediate density.\n\nStep 3: The effect of heat denaturation.\nThe problem specifies that the DNA extracted after one replication cycle is heat-denatured before centrifugation. Heat denaturation breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold the two strands of the DNA double helix together. This process separates the hybrid ${}^{15}\\text{N}$-${}^{14}\\text{N}$ duplexes into their constituent single strands.\nTherefore, the sample no longer contains double-stranded DNA. Instead, it is a mixture of single strands. For every hybrid molecule that is denatured, one ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ single strand and one ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ single strand are produced. Since all the DNA after one round of replication was hybrid, the final mixture contains an equal number of ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ single strands and ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ single strands.\n\nStep 4: The final centrifugation analysis.\nThis mixture of single strands is then subjected to equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation. In this technique, molecules migrate to a position in the gradient where their density matches the density of the surrounding solution.\nThe single strands containing ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ are denser than the single strands containing ${}^{14}\\text{N}$. As a result, they will separate into two distinct populations during centrifugation.\nThe ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ single strands will form a band at the \"heavy\" density position.\nThe ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ single strands will form a separate band at the \"light\" density position.\nSince the replication process produced one new ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ strand for every original ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ template strand, the total amount of material in each band will be equal, leading to bands of equal intensity. No intermediate band is possible because there are no hybrid molecules (they were all denatured), and single strands have either the heavy or the light density, not an intermediate one.\n\nConclusion: The expected outcome is two distinct bands, one heavy and one light.
