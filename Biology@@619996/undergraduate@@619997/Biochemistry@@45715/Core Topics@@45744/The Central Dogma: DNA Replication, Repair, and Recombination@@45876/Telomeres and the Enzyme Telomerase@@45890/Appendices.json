By working through this problem, you will directly apply the fundamental principles of nucleic acid complementarity and directionality, reinforcing your grasp of how genetic information is transcribed from RNA back into DNA.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the ends of linear chromosomes, known as telomeres, consist of repetitive nucleotide sequences. These structures protect the chromosome from degradation and fusion with other chromosomes. During DNA replication, a small portion of the chromosome's end is lost—a phenomenon called the \"end replication problem.\" The enzyme telomerase counteracts this shortening by adding telomeric DNA repeats to the 3' end of the chromosome. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase, meaning it synthesizes DNA using its own integral Telomerase RNA (TR) component as a template.\n\nImagine a pathogenic organism induces a specific mutation in human cells that alters the template region of the TR component of telomerase. The normal human TR template sequence is 3'-AAUCCC-5', leading to the synthesis of the 5'-TTAGGG-3' DNA repeat. The mutation, however, changes the template sequence to 3'-ACCACC-5'.\n\nWhat would be the sequence of the new single DNA strand synthesized by this mutated telomerase, written in the 5' to 3' direction?\n\nA. 5'-TGGTGG-3'\n\nB. 5'-UGGUGG-3'\n\nC. 5'-GGTGGT-3'\n\nD. 5'-ACCACC-3'\n\nE. 5'-CCACCA-3'", "solution": "The problem asks for the DNA sequence synthesized by a mutated telomerase enzyme. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the mechanism of telomerase and the rules of nucleic acid base pairing.\n\nTelomerase is a reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that synthesizes a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) strand from a Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) template. The synthesis follows the principle of complementarity and occurs in an antiparallel fashion. This means the new DNA strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction while the enzyme reads the RNA template in the 3' to 5' direction.\n\nThe rules for base pairing between an RNA template and a newly synthesized DNA strand are as follows:\n- Adenine (A) in the RNA template pairs with Thymine (T) in the DNA strand.\n- Cytosine (C) in the RNA template pairs with Guanine (G) in the DNA strand.\n- Guanine (G) in the RNA template pairs with Cytosine (C) in the DNA strand.\n- Uracil (U) in the RNA template pairs with Adenine (A) in the DNA strand.\n\nThe mutated Telomerase RNA (TR) template sequence is given as 3'-ACCACC-5'. We will determine the sequence of the complementary DNA strand synthesized from this template, base by base, starting from the 3' end of the template. This corresponds to the 5' end of the new DNA strand.\n\n1.  The first base at the 3' end of the RNA template is A. Its complementary base in DNA is T. So, the 5' end of the new DNA strand starts with T.\n2.  The second base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n3.  The third base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n4.  The fourth base in the template is A. Its complementary base in DNA is T.\n5.  The fifth base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n6.  The sixth base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n\nAssembling these bases in the order they are synthesized (5' to 3'), we get the sequence 5'-TGGTGG-3'.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. 5'-TGGTGG-3': This matches our derived sequence.\nB. 5'-UGGUGG-3': This sequence contains Uracil (U). DNA strands contain Thymine (T), not Uracil. This would be an RNA sequence complementary to the template.\nC. 5'-GGTGGT-3': This is the reverse of the correct sequence, which would result from an incorrect assumption about the direction of synthesis or reading.\nD. 5'-ACCACC-3': This is the sequence of the template itself, not the synthesized DNA strand.\nE. 5'-CCACCA-3': This is the reverse of the template sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence for the newly synthesized DNA strand is 5'-TGGTGG-3'.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2078652"}, {"introduction": "In living cells, telomere length is not static; it is the result of a dynamic tug-of-war between the shortening caused by the end-replication problem and the extension activity of telomerase. This practice problem models this crucial balance, allowing you to calculate its direct impact on a cell's replicative lifespan [@problem_id:2078651]. By quantifying the net change in telomere length per cell division, you can predict how many divisions a cell line can undergo before reaching senescence, providing a tangible link between molecular mechanics and cellular aging.", "problem": "In a laboratory study, a cell biologist is investigating a genetically engineered human somatic cell line. During each round of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication, these cells are known to lose approximately 60 base pairs (bp) from the 3' end of the chromosome's lagging strand due to the end-replication problem. To study telomere dynamics, a specific mutation was introduced into the gene for telomerase. This mutation severely impairs the enzyme's processivity, causing it to add exactly one `TTAGGG` hexanucleotide repeat to a chromosome end before dissociating. This limited extension event occurs only once per cell cycle for each telomere that is being shortened.\n\nThe initial average telomere length in this mutant cell line at the start of the experiment is 9,500 bp. The cells will enter a state of replicative senescence and stop dividing when the average telomere length drops to a critical threshold of 4,100 bp.\n\nCalculate the total number of cell divisions this population can undergo before senescence is triggered.", "solution": "Let $L_{0}$ denote the initial average telomere length and $L_{c}$ the critical threshold. Each cell division shortens the telomere by $60$ base pairs (bp) due to the end-replication problem, and the mutant telomerase adds exactly one `TTAGGG` hexanucleotide repeat per cycle to a telomere that is being shortened. Therefore, the net change in average telomere length per division is\n$$\n\\Delta L=-60+6=-54 \\text{ bp per division}.\n$$\nAfter $N$ divisions, the average length is\n$$\nL(N)=L_{0}+N\\Delta L=L_{0}-54N.\n$$\nSenescence is triggered when the average length reaches the threshold $L_{c}$, so set $L(N)=L_{c}$ and solve for $N$:\n$$\nL_{0}-54N=L_{c} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N=\\frac{L_{0}-L_{c}}{54}.\n$$\nWith $L_{0}=9500$ and $L_{c}=4100$,\n$$\nN=\\frac{9500-4100}{54}=\\frac{5400}{54}=100.\n$$\nThus, the population can undergo $100$ cell divisions before senescence is triggered.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{100}$$", "id": "2078651"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its basic function, telomerase activity is subject to sophisticated layers of regulation within the cell. This advanced problem explores one such mechanism: dominant-negative inhibition by an alternatively spliced protein isoform [@problem_id:2078661]. You are challenged to integrate concepts from molecular genetics with the principles of enzyme kinetics to model how a non-functional version of a protein can interfere with its active counterpart. This exercise demonstrates how core biochemical concepts like competitive inhibition can explain complex regulatory phenomena observed in cellular pathways, particularly in contexts like cancer where telomerase regulation is often disrupted.", "problem": "In a specific line of cancer cells, the gene for Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), the catalytic protein subunit of the telomerase enzyme, undergoes alternative splicing. This process yields two isoforms: a full-length, catalytically active wild-type protein (WT-TERT) and a shorter, dominant-negative isoform (DN-TERT). The DN-TERT protein retains its full affinity for the telomeric DNA substrate but completely lacks the catalytic domain required for DNA synthesis. It therefore acts as a pure competitive inhibitor of the active telomerase enzyme.\n\nLet's model the kinetics of this system. The total concentration of all TERT protein in the cell, $[TERT]_{total}$, is constant. A fraction $f$ of this total protein is the active WT-TERT, while the remaining fraction $(1-f)$ is the inhibitory DN-TERT. Thus, the concentration of the active enzyme is $[E] = f[TERT]_{total}$ and the concentration of the inhibitor is $[I] = (1-f)[TERT]_{total}$.\n\nThe Michaelis constant of the active telomerase enzyme for its telomeric DNA substrate ($S$) is $K_M$. Because the DN-TERT isoform retains identical binding properties, its inhibition constant, $K_I$, is equal to $K_M$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the fractional telomerase activity, $A_{frac}$. This is defined as the ratio of the enzyme's reaction velocity in this cell ($v$) to a reference velocity ($v_{ref}$) that would be observed if all TERT protein were the wild-type form (i.e., at $f=1$). Assume the cellular concentration of the telomeric DNA substrate is a constant value equal to the Michaelis constant, $[S] = K_M$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $A_{frac}$ in terms of the fraction $f$ and the dimensionless parameter $\\gamma = \\frac{[TERT]_{total}}{K_M}$.", "solution": "Let the total TERT concentration be constant, with $[E] = f[TERT]_{total}$ the active WT-TERT and $[I] = (1 - f)[TERT]_{total}$ the DN-TERT.
