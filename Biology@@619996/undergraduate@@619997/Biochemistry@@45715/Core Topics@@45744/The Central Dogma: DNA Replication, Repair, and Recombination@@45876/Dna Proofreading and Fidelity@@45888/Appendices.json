{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "High-fidelity DNA polymerases are remarkable molecular machines that balance speed with extreme accuracy. A key to their fidelity is a 'proofreading' function, which relies on a separate $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease active site. This first practice explores the fundamental logic of proofreading by asking you to predict the enzyme's immediate response when it encounters a pre-existing error, forcing a choice between its two main functions: polymerization and editing.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the properties of a high-fidelity Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase, an enzyme known to possess both $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase activity and $3' \\to 5'$ proofreading exonuclease activity. The researcher prepares an in vitro reaction mixture containing this polymerase, a single-stranded DNA template, and a short DNA primer that is complementary to the template except for a single, deliberate mismatch at its 3'-terminus. All four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are also present in the buffer at optimal concentrations.\n\nImmediately after the polymerase binds to the primer-template junction, which of the following enzymatic actions will it perform first?\n\nA. It will catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond, adding the correct nucleotide specified by the template, effectively extending the mismatched primer.\n\nB. It will activate its $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease activity to remove the mismatched nucleotide from the primer's 3' end.\n\nC. It will activate a $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity to degrade the primer starting from its 5' end.\n\nD. It will dissociate from the DNA template entirely, as it cannot extend a mismatched primer.\n\nE. It will unwind the DNA ahead of the primer using an intrinsic helicase activity.", "solution": "We are told the enzyme possesses $5^{\\prime}\\to 3^{\\prime}$ polymerase activity and $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ proofreading exonuclease activity. The primer ends with a single mismatched nucleotide at its $3^{\\prime}$ terminus, and all four dNTPs are present.\n\nFirst, recall the chemical requirement for $5^{\\prime}\\to 3^{\\prime}$ polymerization: the primer’s $3^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl must be correctly base-paired and geometrically aligned to perform a nucleophilic attack on the $\\alpha$-phosphate of the incoming dNTP, forming a new phosphodiester bond and releasing pyrophosphate. Symbolically, the extension step can be represented as:\n$$\n\\text{primer-}3^{\\prime}\\text{-OH} + \\text{dNTP} \\to \\text{primer-}3^{\\prime}\\text{-O-P} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nHigh-fidelity DNA polymerases achieve fidelity by coupling stringent geometric selection in the polymerase active site with a separate $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ exonuclease site that removes misincorporated nucleotides. A $3^{\\prime}$-terminal mismatch distorts the primer-template duplex at the active site, misaligning the $3^{\\prime}$-OH and markedly reducing the rate of phosphodiester bond formation. Under these conditions, the enzyme preferentially transfers the primer terminus to the exonuclease site, where the terminal (mismatched) nucleotide is hydrolytically removed in the $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ direction, regenerating a correctly paired $3^{\\prime}$-OH that can then be efficiently extended.\n\nTherefore, immediately after binding to a primer-template junction with a $3^{\\prime}$-end mismatch, a high-fidelity polymerase will not extend the mismatched primer (contradicting option A), but will instead activate its $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ proofreading exonuclease to excise the mismatch. It does not use a $5^{\\prime}\\to 3^{\\prime}$ exonuclease to degrade from the $5^{\\prime}$ end (option C is incorrect and not a proofreading function of such polymerases), it does not dissociate by default (option D is inconsistent with proofreading), and helicase activity is not intrinsic to typical high-fidelity DNA polymerases (option E is incorrect).\n\nHence, the first enzymatic action is removal of the mismatched $3^{\\prime}$ nucleotide via $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ exonuclease activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2040785"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the polymerase's decision to remove a mismatch, as explored in the previous exercise [@problem_id:2040785], sets the stage for quantifying the overall impact on replication accuracy. This problem provides a simple but powerful framework for calculating the final error rate of a polymerase. By combining the enzyme's intrinsic misincorporation rate with its proofreading efficiency, you will see how sequential fidelity checkpoints work together to achieve an extraordinarily low number of final errors.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a novel DNA polymerase, named ChronoPol, isolated from a thermophilic archaeon. This enzyme is responsible for replicating the organism's genome. Through in vitro assays, the biochemist determines that ChronoPol has an intrinsic misincorporation rate, which is the frequency of adding an incorrect nucleotide before any correction. This rate is found to be one incorrect nucleotide for every 100,000 bases incorporated. The ChronoPol enzyme also possesses a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity that provides a \"proofreading\" function. This proofreading mechanism is highly efficient: for every 100 incorrect nucleotides that are incorporated, the proofreading activity successfully identifies and removes 99 of them.\n\nAssuming these two processes—misincorporation and proofreading—are the only factors determining replication fidelity, calculate the final, overall error rate of the ChronoPol enzyme. Express your answer as a single real number representing the number of errors per base pair incorporated.", "solution": "Let $p_{\\text{mis}}$ be the intrinsic misincorporation probability per base incorporated.

This advanced problem delves into the biophysical reality of the proofreading decision, using a hypothetical but realistic single-molecule FRET experiment. By analyzing kinetic data, you will calculate the probability that a given error is corrected, which depends on the competition between the rate of mismatch extension ($k_{ext}$) and the rate of translocation to the exonuclease site ($k_{trans}$), providing insight into how these fundamental rates determine the enzyme's ultimate fidelity [@problem_id:2040785] [@problem_id:2040797].", "problem": "A single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiment is designed to study the proofreading mechanism of a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. In this setup, a donor fluorophore is placed on the polymerase catalytic core, and an acceptor fluorophore is attached to the 3'-end of the primer strand of a DNA substrate. The FRET efficiency, $E_{FRET}$, is high when the primer end is in the polymerase (Pol) active site, and low when it is in the 3'→5' exonuclease (Exo) active site.\n\nExperimental observations reveal the following dynamics upon the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide:\n1.  The polymerase stalls with the mismatched primer end located in the Pol site, a conformation characterized by a high FRET efficiency of $E_{Pol} = 0.92$.\n2.  From this stalled state, two competing kinetic pathways are possible:\n    a) The primer end can translocate to the Exo site for proofreading. This event is observed as a distinct drop in FRET efficiency to $E_{Exo} = 0.25$ and is governed by a rate constant $k_{trans}$.\n    b) The polymerase can extend the mismatch by adding the next correct nucleotide. This \"escapes\" the proofreading pathway and continues synthesis, which is not associated with a change in FRET from the high-FRET state. The rate constant for this mismatch extension is $k_{ext}$.\n\nBy observing many individual proofreading events (pathway 2a), the average lifetime of the stalled, high-FRET state before translocation to the low-FRET Exo state is measured to be $\\langle \\tau_{stall} \\rangle = 125 \\text{ ms}$.
