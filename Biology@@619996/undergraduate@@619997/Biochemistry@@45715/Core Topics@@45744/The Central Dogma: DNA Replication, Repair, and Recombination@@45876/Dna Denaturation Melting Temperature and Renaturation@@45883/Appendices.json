The melting temperature ($T_m$) of a primer is a critical parameter for designing a successful PCR experiment. It is the temperature at which half of the DNA duplex dissociates to become single-stranded. For short DNA oligonucleotides (typically less than 20 base pairs), a simple empirical formula is often used to estimate the melting temperature:\n$$ T_m = 2(N_A + N_T) + 4(N_G + N_C) $$\nwhere $N_A, N_T, N_G, \\text{ and } N_C$ are the respective counts of Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine bases in the sequence.
