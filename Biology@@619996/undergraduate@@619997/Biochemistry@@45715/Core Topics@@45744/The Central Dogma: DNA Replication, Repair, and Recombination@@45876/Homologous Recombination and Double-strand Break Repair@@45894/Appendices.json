{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Following a double-strand break, the cell must first prepare the damaged site for repair. This involves creating single-stranded DNA tails, which are highly vulnerable. This exercise [@problem_id:2050157] tests your understanding of the crucial role played by single-strand binding proteins, like Replication Protein A (RPA), in protecting these vulnerable DNA strands and preparing them for the essential step of homology search. By considering the consequences of a non-functional RPA, you can appreciate why this initial protective step is a non-negotiable prerequisite for successful homologous recombination.", "problem": "In a laboratory study of DNA repair mechanisms, a researcher develops a mutant strain of eukaryotic cells. This strain possesses a specific mutation in the gene encoding Replication Protein A (RPA), the primary single-strand binding protein complex in eukaryotes. The mutation renders the RPA complex completely unable to bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). These cells are then exposed to ionizing radiation, which induces numerous Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) in their genomes. Cells normally repair such breaks via multiple pathways, including the high-fidelity Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway. The initial step of HR involves the processing of the DSB ends to generate 3' ssDNA overhangs. In wild-type cells, these overhangs are then coated by RPA. The recombinase enzyme, RAD51, subsequently assembles onto these overhangs to form a filament that is essential for searching for and invading a homologous DNA template to initiate repair.\n\nGiven the non-functional RPA in this mutant cell line, what is the most direct and immediate consequence that leads to the failure of the Homologous Recombination pathway following a DSB?\n\nA. The DNA ligase enzyme will be inhibited, preventing the final sealing of the repaired DNA strands.\n\nB. The resection process that generates the ssDNA overhangs will be hyperactivated, leading to excessively long strands that cannot be repaired.\n\nC. The ssDNA overhangs will be prone to forming stable secondary structures, thus preventing the proper assembly of the functional RAD51 nucleoprotein filament required for strand invasion.\n\nD. The cell will successfully complete HR, but with a much higher rate of mutation compared to wild-type cells.\n\nE. The RAD51 filament will form correctly on the ssDNA, but it will be unable to displace the mutated RPA from the strand, stalling the process.", "solution": "The homologous recombination pathway after a double-strand break proceeds through: (i) end resection to generate 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs, (ii) immediate coating of these ssDNA regions by Replication Protein A (RPA), which serves two essential functions: it prevents intramolecular base pairing and secondary structure formation on ssDNA, and it creates a proper substrate for mediator proteins (such as BRCA2) to load RAD51; (iii) assembly of a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA, which is required for homology search and strand invasion.\n\nGiven a mutant RPA that is completely unable to bind ssDNA, the earliest and most direct consequence occurs immediately after resection: the exposed ssDNA overhangs remain uncoated. Uncoated ssDNA is highly prone to forming stable secondary structures (for example, hairpins) and is also vulnerable to inappropriate annealing and nuclease attack. Critically, the formation of secondary structures and the absence of RPA-mediated substrate preparation prevent efficient and orderly assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA. Without a properly formed RAD51 filament, the homology search and strand invasion steps cannot proceed, causing failure of homologous recombination at an early stage.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because ligation is a late step; the defect arises earlier at RAD51 loading/filament formation.\n- B is not the most direct consequence; although RPA can influence resection dynamics, the defining immediate defect of RPA loss is failure to stabilize ssDNA and enable RAD51 filament assembly.\n- C is correct: uncoated ssDNA forms secondary structures, preventing proper RAD51 filament assembly.\n- D is incorrect because HR fails early rather than completing with increased mutation.\n- E is incorrect because the mutant RPA cannot bind ssDNA, so there is no RPA to displace; the block occurs before any RAD51 filament correctly forms.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is the prevention of proper RAD51 filament assembly due to secondary structure formation on ssDNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050157"}, {"introduction": "After the homology search and DNA synthesis stages successfully link the broken DNA to a template, the repair is not yet complete. The molecules are physically connected by a structure known as a Holliday junction, which must be precisely clipped to finalize the repair. This problem [@problem_id:2050155] focuses on this terminal step, asking you to deduce the cellular consequences of losing the RuvC resolvase in bacteria. This thought experiment underscores that completing the repair pathway and ensuring chromosomes can properly segregate is vital for cell viability.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying DNA repair mechanisms in a species of bacterium that relies on homologous recombination to repair Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs). A mutant strain of this bacterium has been engineered to possess a null mutation in the gene encoding the RuvC resolvase, rendering the RuvC protein completely non-functional. An actively dividing culture of this mutant strain is exposed to a chemical agent that specifically induces DSBs in the bacterial chromosome. Assuming the homologous recombination pathway is successfully initiated in response to these breaks and a homologous DNA template is available, what is the most likely primary consequence and ultimate cellular fate for the majority of the affected cells?\n\nChoose from the following options:\n\nA. The cells will be unable to perform strand invasion, leading to the persistence of the original DSBs and subsequent cell death.\n\nB. The cells will form stable Holliday junctions but will fail to resolve them, leading to an inability to segregate chromosomes during cell division and eventual cell death.\n\nC. The repair process will stall prior to the formation of Holliday junctions because the necessary protein complexes cannot assemble correctly at the site of the break.\n\nD. The cells will complete the repair process, but the absence of RuvC will cause an alternative, error-prone polymerase to be recruited, resulting in a high mutation rate but allowing the cells to survive.\n\nE. The Holliday junctions will be resolved by a different, less efficient enzyme system, allowing the cell to survive but with a significantly slower growth rate.", "solution": "We identify the key mechanistic role of RuvC in bacterial homologous recombination following a double-strand break. In the canonical pathway, a DSB is processed by nucleases (for example, RecBCD in many bacteria) to produce 3' single-stranded overhangs. RecA then mediates strand invasion into a homologous duplex, forming a displacement loop and subsequent capture of the second end, yielding one or two Holliday junctions. The RuvAB complex promotes branch migration of the Holliday junction(s), and RuvC is the endonuclease that specifically resolves Holliday junctions by coordinated endonucleolytic cleavage to generate ligatable DNA ends that can be sealed to complete repair.\n\nGiven that the mutant strain has a null mutation in the gene encoding RuvC, the resolvase activity required to cleave Holliday junctions is absent. The problem states that homologous recombination is successfully initiated and a homologous template is available. Therefore, upstream steps—end resection, RecA-mediated strand invasion, and formation of Holliday junctions—will proceed. RuvAB-mediated branch migration can still occur, but without RuvC, the junctions cannot be resolved by the canonical cleavage mechanism.\n\nThe primary consequence is the accumulation of unresolved Holliday junctions that physically link sister chromatids and generate persistent recombination intermediates. These structures impede completion of chromosome replication and block proper chromosome segregation during cell division. This failure leads to a division defect, activation of stress responses (such as the SOS response), and, for the majority of affected cells, eventual death due to catastrophic segregation failure or lethal genomic entanglements.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because strand invasion is mediated by RecA and does not require RuvC; initiation still occurs.\nC is incorrect because assembly of the early homologous recombination machinery is upstream of RuvC’s function.\nD is incorrect because RuvC is a resolvase, not a DNA polymerase; its absence does not redirect to an error-prone polymerase to complete repair.\nE is generally incorrect in this context; while some organisms may harbor alternative resolvases (e.g., RusA under specific conditions or different systems in other taxa), the question frames the strain as RuvC-null without invoking compensatory resolvases, and the most likely primary consequence for the majority of cells is failure to resolve Holliday junctions and death.\nThus, the correct choice is that cells form Holliday junctions but cannot resolve them, leading to segregation failure and eventual death.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2050155"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the steps of a single pathway, biochemists are keenly interested in how cells choose between different repair strategies. This exercise [@problem_id:2050141] moves from theory to practice, challenging you to analyze data from a clever genetic reporter system designed to distinguish between two outcomes of recombination: Gene Conversion and Single-Strand Annealing. By calculating the effect of a mutation, you will engage in the type of quantitative reasoning that allows scientists to uncover the functions of genes that regulate these critical repair decisions.", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying the mechanisms of Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. They have constructed a plasmid-based reporter system to screen for mutations that alter the choice between different repair pathways.\n\nThe reporter plasmid, named pREPAIR, is a centromeric plasmid maintained in a yeast strain that is auxotrophic for tryptophan, adenine, and uracil (`trp1-`, `ade2-`, `ura3-`). The strain also contains a gene for the I-SceI endonuclease under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter, integrated into its genome.\n\nThe pREPAIR plasmid contains the following components:\n1.  A `TRP1` gene, which allows for selection of cells carrying the plasmid.\n2.  A reporter cassette consisting of two non-functional fragments of the `ADE2` gene arranged as direct repeats. The first fragment, `ade2-5'Δ`, has a deletion at its 5' end and contains a unique recognition site for the I-SceI endonuclease. The second fragment, `ade2-3'Δ`, has a deletion at its 3' end.\n3.  The `URA3` gene is located in the sequence between the two `ade2` fragments.\n\nThe initial state of cells carrying pREPAIR is `Trp+`, `Ura+`, and `Ade-`. `Ade-` cells accumulate a red pigment, making colonies appear red. When galactose is added to the growth medium, I-SceI is expressed and creates a DSB within the `ade2-5'Δ` fragment. This DSB can be repaired via homologous recombination using the `ade2-3'Δ` fragment as a template, leading to a functional `ADE2` gene and thus `Ade+` cells, which form white colonies.\n\nTwo main repair pathways are possible, distinguished by their effect on the intervening `URA3` marker:\n-   **Gene Conversion (GC)**: A non-crossover pathway where the break is repaired without loss of the intervening DNA. This results in an `Ade+ Ura+` phenotype (white colonies that can grow on media lacking uracil). This is considered a non-crossover type of outcome.\n-   **Single-Strand Annealing (SSA)**: A deletion pathway where resection of the DSB ends exposes the homologous regions of the two repeats, which then anneal. This process results in the deletion of one repeat and the intervening `URA3` gene. This leads to an `Ade+ Ura-` phenotype (white colonies that cannot grow on media lacking uracil). This is considered a crossover-like outcome as it involves a change in the chromosome structure (a deletion).\n\nThe geneticists performed an experiment comparing a wild-type (WT) strain to a strain with a deletion of a previously uncharacterized gene, `mutXΔ`. After inducing the DSB with galactose, they plated the cells to select for repair events (white colonies) and then determined the uracil auxotrophy of these repaired colonies. The following counts were obtained for `Ade+` (white) colonies:\n\n**Wild-Type (WT) Strain:**\n-   Number of `Ade+ Ura+` colonies (GC outcome): 4500\n-   Number of `Ade+ Ura-` colonies (SSA outcome): 500\n\n**`mutXΔ` Strain:**\n-   Number of `Ade+ Ura+` colonies (GC outcome): 1800\n-   Number of `Ade+ Ura-` colonies (SSA outcome): 3000\n\nBased on this data, calculate the fold-change in the ratio of SSA events to GC events in the `mutXΔ` strain compared to the WT strain.
