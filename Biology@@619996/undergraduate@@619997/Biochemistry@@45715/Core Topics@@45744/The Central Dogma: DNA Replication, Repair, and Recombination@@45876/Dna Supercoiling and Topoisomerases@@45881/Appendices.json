The plasmid is treated with the enzyme Topoisomerase I, which systematically alters the DNA topology until all superhelical tension is released and the molecule is fully relaxed. Following this relaxation, the Topoisomerase I enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and removed from the solution.\n\nNext, the purified, relaxed plasmid is transferred into a new experimental buffer (Buffer B) containing a high concentration of salt.

This practice challenges you to predict the outcome of a classic experiment that uses the intercalating agent ethidium bromide to alter and visualize DNA supercoiling. Analyzing how a plasmid's mobility changes will solidify your understanding of how twist, writhe, and overall molecular compactness are directly related, and how we can observe these properties experimentally [@problem_id:2041948].", "problem": "A molecular biologist has isolated a pure sample of a single plasmid from a bacterial culture. This plasmid is a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule. Under physiological conditions in the cell, it is known to be negatively supercoiled. The biologist wants to analyze the topology of this plasmid using agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide (EtBr), a planar molecule that can insert itself, or intercalate, between the stacked base pairs of DNA. This intercalation forces the DNA double helix to unwind locally at the site of insertion.\n\nConsider an experiment where identical amounts of the negatively supercoiled plasmid are loaded into lanes of an agarose gel. The gel contains a concentration of ethidium bromide that is gradually increased from zero in the first lane to a very high concentration in the last lane. Assuming that the linking number of the plasmid DNA does not change during the experiment (i.e., no topoisomerase activity and no nicks in the DNA), how will the electrophoretic mobility (and thus the distance migrated from the well) of the plasmid change as the concentration of EtBr increases?\n\nA.

The mobility will first decrease, reach a minimum, and then increase.\n\nD. The mobility will first increase, reach a maximum, and then decrease.\n\nE. The mobility will remain unchanged because the molecular weight of the plasmid is constant.", "solution": "Let the plasmid be a covalently closed circular DNA with fixed linking number $Lk$ during electrophoresis. The fundamental topological relation is:\n$$\nLk = Tw + Wr,\n$$\nwhere $Tw$ is the twist (helical turns of the duplex) and $Wr$ is the writhe (supercoiling).\n\nInitially, the plasmid is negatively supercoiled, so its writhe is negative, $Wr(0) < 0$. This means its linking number $Lk$ is less than the linking number it would have if it were relaxed, $Lk_0(0)$. Here, $Lk_0(c)$ denotes the relaxed linking number at ethidium bromide concentration $c$, which is equal to the equilibrium twist in the absence of writhe: $Lk_{0}(c) = Tw_{0}(c)$.\n\nEthidium bromide intercalation locally unwinds the double helix, increasing the helical repeat $h(c)$. If $N$ is the number of base pairs, then $Tw_{0}(c) = N/h(c)$. Since $h(c)$ increases with concentration $c$, the preferred twist $Tw_0(c)$ decreases.\n\nBecause $Lk$ is constant, the change in twist due to intercalation must be compensated by a change in writhe. As EtBr concentration increases, it forces the DNA to unwind, decreasing the actual twist $Tw(c)$. To keep the sum $Tw+Wr$ constant, the writhe $Wr(c)$ must increase.\n$$\n\\frac{dWr}{dc} = -\\frac{dTw}{dc} > 0\n$$\nThus, $Wr(c)$ increases monotonically with $c$, starting from a negative value $Wr(0) < 0$. There exists a concentration $c^{\\ast}$ at which the negative supercoiling is fully canceled and the molecule becomes topologically relaxed: $Wr(c^{\\ast}) = 0$. For $c > c^{\\ast}$, $Wr(c)$ becomes positive, meaning the molecule becomes positively supercoiled.\n\nAgarose gel electrophoretic mobility of cccDNA correlates with its compactness. A more compact molecule (highly supercoiled) moves faster through the gel matrix. The magnitude of the writhe, $|Wr|$, is a measure of this compactness. Minimal mobility occurs when the molecule is least compact, which is when it is fully relaxed ($Wr=0$).\n\nTherefore, as the EtBr concentration $c$ increases from zero:\n1. The initial negative writhe $Wr(c)$ increases toward zero. The molecule becomes less compact, so its mobility decreases.\n2. At concentration $c^{\\ast}$, the writhe is zero. The plasmid is relaxed and at its least compact state, so its mobility is at a minimum.\n3. For $c > c^{\\ast}$, the writhe becomes positive and its magnitude $|Wr(c)|$ increases. The molecule becomes positively supercoiled and more compact again, so its mobility increases.\n\nIn summary, the electrophoretic mobility first decreases, reaches a minimum, and then increases with increasing ethidium bromide concentration.\n\nThus the correct choice is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2041948"}]}
