This first exercise [@problem_id:2085787] focuses on two foundational principles: base complementarity, where Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C), and the antiparallel nature of the DNA strands. By determining the sequence of a complementary strand and tallying the hydrogen bonds, you will practice the very rules that ensure the faithful replication and structural integrity of our genetic code.", "problem": "The structure of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is described by the Watson-Crick model, which features two polynucleotide chains coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between specific pairs of nitrogenous bases and run in opposite directions, a property known as being antiparallel. According to the base-pairing rules, Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C). An A-T pair is linked by two hydrogen bonds, while a G-C pair is linked by three hydrogen bonds.\n\nConsider a short, single-stranded DNA segment with the following sequence and polarity:\n5'-GCTAATGC-3'\n\nDetermine the correct sequence and polarity of its complementary strand, and calculate the total number of hydrogen bonds that would stabilize the resulting double-stranded DNA segment.

We will solve this in two steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the sequence and polarity of the complementary strand.\nThe Watson-Crick model states that DNA strands are antiparallel. This means that if one strand runs in the 5' to 3' direction, its complementary strand must run in the 3' to 5' direction. The given strand is 5'-GCTAATGC-3', so its partner strand must have the polarity 3' to 5'.\n\nNext, we apply the base-pairing rules to find the sequence of the complementary strand:\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).\n- Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G).\n- Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A).\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T).\n\nLet's write down the original sequence and find the complementary base for each nucleotide:\nOriginal strand: 5' - G  C  T  A  A  T  G  C - 3'\nComplementary strand: 3' - C  G  A  T  T  A  C  G - 5'\n\nSo, the full description of the complementary strand is 3'-CGATTACG-5'.\n\nSecond, we calculate the total number of hydrogen bonds in the double-stranded DNA segment.\nThe problem states that an Adenine-Thymine (A-T) pair has 2 hydrogen bonds, and a Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pair has 3 hydrogen bonds. We can count the number of each type of base pair in the double-stranded segment.\n\nThe double helix will have the following pairs:\n- G-C\n- C-G\n- T-A\n- A-T\n- A-T\n- T-A\n- G-C\n- C-G\n\nLet's count the number of A-T pairs and G-C pairs in the original sequence 5'-GCTAATGC-3':\n- Number of A's and T's = 4 (one T, three A's). This corresponds to 4 A-T base pairs.\n- Number of G's and C's = 4 (two G's, two C's). This corresponds to 4 G-C base pairs.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of hydrogen bonds:\nTotal H-bonds = (Number of A-T pairs) $\\times$ 2 + (Number of G-C pairs) $\\times$ 3\nTotal H-bonds = (4) $\\times$ 2 + (4) $\\times$ 3\nTotal H-bonds = 8 + 12\nTotal H-bonds = 20\n\nTherefore, the complementary strand is 3'-CGATTACG-5' and the total number of hydrogen bonds is 20.\n\nFinally, we compare our result with the given options:\nA. 3'-CGATTACG-5', with 20 hydrogen bonds - This matches our findings.\nB. 5'-CGATTACG-3', with 20 hydrogen bonds - Incorrect polarity.\nC. 3'-CGATTACG-5', with 18 hydrogen bonds - Incorrect number of hydrogen bonds.\nD. 5'-GAUUACGU-3', with 18 hydrogen bonds - Incorrect polarity, sequence (contains Uracil, U, which is found in RNA, not DNA), and number of hydrogen bonds.\nE. 3'-CGATTACG-5', with 22 hydrogen bonds - Incorrect number of hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2085787"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the sequence of DNA is one thing; visualizing its physical scale is another.
