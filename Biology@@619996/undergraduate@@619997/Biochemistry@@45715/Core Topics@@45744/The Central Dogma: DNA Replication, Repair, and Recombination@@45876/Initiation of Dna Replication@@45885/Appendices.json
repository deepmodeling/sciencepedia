This exercise provides a quantitative look at why this is the case, allowing you to calculate the energetic difference between unwinding an A-T-rich sequence versus a Guanine-Cytosine (G-C)-rich one, thereby illustrating a fundamental principle of DNA biochemistry.

This region contains a crucial element known as the DNA Unwinding Element (DUE), which is the initial site of strand separation. The DUE in a wild-type *E. coli* consists of three tandem 13-base-pair repeats. For this problem, we will use a simplified model where each of these 13-bp repeats has an identical composition of 10 Adenine-Thymine (A-T) pairs and 3 Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pairs.\n\nA bioengineer creates a mutant strain of *E. coli* where the DUE has been synthetically altered.

In bacteria like *E. coli*, the initiator protein DnaA acts as a crucial molecular switch, whose activity is governed by binding and hydrolyzing ATP. This problem presents a thought experiment involving a mutant DnaA protein unable to perform its ATP hydrolysis \"off-switch\" function, challenging you to predict the consequences and thereby understand the logic of replication control. [@problem_id:2051767]", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the initiation of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication is a tightly regulated process that begins at a specific site on the chromosome called the origin of replication C (*oriC*). The key initiator protein, DnaA, controls this event. For initiation to occur, multiple molecules of DnaA, each bound to a molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), must bind to specific recognition sequences within *oriC*. This binding and subsequent oligomerization of DnaA-ATP complexes induces torsional stress that unwinds an adjacent, AT-rich region of the DNA, forming an \"open complex.\" This unwound state is critical for loading the DNA helicase, which then proceeds to unwind the rest of the DNA for replication. Following the successful loading of the helicase, DnaA hydrolyzes its bound ATP to ADP. This conversion to the DnaA-ADP form causes DnaA to dissociate from *oriC*, preventing immediate re-initiation.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that expresses a functionally altered DnaA protein. This mutant DnaA can bind to ATP and to the *oriC* sequences just like the wild-type protein, and it can successfully induce the formation of the open complex. However, due to a specific mutation in its ATPase domain, it is completely incapable of hydrolyzing its bound ATP to ADP. Based on this information, which of the following outcomes would be the most direct and immediate consequence of this mutation on the cell's DNA replication cycle?\n\nA. DNA replication would fail to initiate because the mutant DnaA protein cannot bind to *oriC*.\n\nB. The initial round of DNA replication would proceed, but the process would be unable to terminate correctly at the end of the chromosome.\n\nC. DNA replication would initiate, but the tight regulation would be lost, leading to uncontrolled and frequent re-initiation of replication from *oriC* within a single cell cycle.\n\nD. The DnaA-DNA complex would form at *oriC*, but it would fail to recruit the DNA helicase, thereby stalling replication before it begins.\n\nE. DNA replication would initiate, but the process would halt because DNA primase would be unable to synthesize RNA primers on the unwound strands.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the cellular consequence of a mutation in the *E. coli* DnaA protein that prevents it from hydrolyzing its bound Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nStep 1: Understand the normal function of DnaA and the role of ATP.\nIn wild-type *E. coli*, the DnaA protein acts as the initiator of DNA replication. Its activity is regulated by the nucleotide it binds.\n- **Active Form (DnaA-ATP):** When bound to ATP, DnaA is in its active state. Multiple DnaA-ATP molecules bind to specific sites (DnaA boxes) within the origin of replication C (*oriC*). This binding leads to the formation of a helical protein filament that wraps the DNA, causing strain and leading to the melting (unwinding) of the nearby AT-rich region. This open complex is the platform for loading the DnaB helicase.\n- **Inactive Form (DnaA-ADP):** After helicase is loaded and initiation is underway, a regulatory process stimulates DnaA's intrinsic ATPase activity. DnaA hydrolyzes its bound ATP to ADP. In its ADP-bound state, DnaA has a much lower affinity for the *oriC* sequences and for self-association, causing the initiation complex to disassemble. This step is crucial for preventing another round of replication from starting at the same origin before the cell has completed its division cycle. It acts as an \"off switch\" or a reset mechanism.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the described mutation.\nThe problem states the mutant DnaA protein has the following properties:\n- It can bind ATP.\n- It can bind to *oriC* sequences.\n- It can form the open complex.\n- It **cannot** hydrolyze ATP to ADP.\n\nThis means the mutant DnaA protein can successfully perform all the steps required to *initiate* replication. However, it is permanently locked in its active, ATP-bound state because the \"off switch\" (ATP hydrolysis) is broken.\n\nStep 3: Predict the consequence of the mutation.\nSince the mutant DnaA can perform all the necessary functions for initiation, the first round of replication will successfully begin. The open complex will form, and helicase will be loaded. However, after this initiation event, the DnaA protein will remain in its DnaA-ATP form. Because DnaA-ATP is the active form that drives initiation, its continued presence and activity at *oriC* will bypass the normal regulatory controls that limit replication to once per cell cycle. The cell will be unable to inactivate the initiator protein, leading to continuous or rapid, unsynchronized re-initiation of DNA replication from the origin. This over-initiation is lethal to the cell as it leads to a tangled mess of chromosomes and disrupts the coordination between DNA synthesis and cell division.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options based on the prediction.\n- **A. DNA replication would fail to initiate because the mutant DnaA protein cannot bind to *oriC*.** This is incorrect. The problem states the mutant protein can bind *oriC*, and binding is mediated by the ATP-bound form, which the protein can achieve.\n- **B. The initial round of DNA replication would proceed, but the process would be unable to terminate correctly at the end of the chromosome.** This is incorrect. DnaA's primary role is in initiation. Replication termination in *E. coli* is a separate process involving Tus proteins binding to Ter sites, which is independent of DnaA's ATPase activity.\n- **C. DNA replication would initiate, but the tight regulation would be lost, leading to uncontrolled and frequent re-initiation of replication from *oriC* within a single cell cycle.** This is correct. The inability to hydrolyze ATP means the DnaA protein remains active, bypassing the crucial regulatory step that prevents re-initiation. This leads to asynchronous over-initiation.\n- **D. The DnaA-DNA complex would form at *oriC*, but it would fail to recruit the DNA helicase, thereby stalling replication before it begins.** This is incorrect. Helicase recruitment and loading are consequences of the open complex formation, which the problem states the mutant DnaA can successfully induce. ATP hydrolysis is a post-initiation event, not a prerequisite for helicase loading.\n- **E. DNA replication would initiate, but the process would halt because DNA primase would be unable to synthesize RNA primers on the unwound strands.** This is incorrect. The function of DNA primase (DnaG) is separate from and downstream of DnaA's role. Primase acts on the single-stranded DNA exposed by the helicase, and its function is not directly affected by the ATP-bound state of DnaA post-initiation.\n\nTherefore, the most direct consequence is the loss of control over the timing of initiation, resulting in uncontrolled replication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2051767"}, {"introduction": "Our detailed models of molecular events like DNA replication initiation are built upon the results of careful biochemical experiments.

The *oriC* locus contains a series of high-affinity and low-affinity \"DnaA boxes\". The binding of several DnaA-ATP monomers to the high-affinity boxes nucleates the cooperative assembly of a larger oligomeric filament that also covers the adjacent low-affinity boxes. This filament formation is essential for unwinding the DNA and initiating replication.\n\nIt is known that one of the inhibitors blocks the initial binding of ATP to the DnaA protein, while the other allows ATP binding and subsequent binding to the high-affinity DnaA boxes, but specifically prevents the cooperative oligomerization onto the low-affinity boxes.\n\nTo distinguish between these two mechanisms, the researcher performs a DNase I footprinting assay. This assay uses a radioactively end-labeled DNA fragment containing the entire *oriC* sequence. The protein-DNA complexes are briefly treated with DNase I, an enzyme that cleaves the DNA backbone.
