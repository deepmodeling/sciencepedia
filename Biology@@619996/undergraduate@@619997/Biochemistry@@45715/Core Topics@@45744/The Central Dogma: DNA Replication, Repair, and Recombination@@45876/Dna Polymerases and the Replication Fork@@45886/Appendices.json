Before analyzing the speeds and enzymes involved, one must be able to correctly orient the template and newly synthesized strands based on the central rule that DNA polymerase works in a $5^{\\prime} \\to 3^{\\prime}$ direction. This practice solidifies your mental model of how the leading and lagging strands emerge from the antiparallel structure of the DNA template [@problem_id:2040563].", "problem": "During the replication of a double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule, a replication fork is established that unwinds the parental duplex. For this problem, we will define the direction of the replication fork's movement as being from left to right. The top parental strand is oriented 5'-to-3' (from left to right), and consequently, the bottom parental strand is oriented 3'-to-5' (from left to right). Synthesis of new DNA requires a template strand and results in a leading strand, which is synthesized continuously, and a lagging strand, which is synthesized discontinuously in segments known as Okazaki fragments.\n\nGiven the established properties of DNA polymerases and the antiparallel nature of the DNA duplex, which of the following statements provides a correct description of the newly synthesized strands in this specific scenario?\n\nA. The leading strand is synthesized using the top (5'-to-3') parental strand as a template and grows continuously in a 5'-to-3' direction.\n\nB. The lagging strand is synthesized using the bottom (3'-to-5') parental strand as a template, and it is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork.\n\nC.

Both the leading and lagging strands are synthesized discontinuously to ensure high fidelity of replication.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires applying two fundamental principles of DNA replication:\n1.  **Directionality of Synthesis:** DNA polymerases can only synthesize a new DNA strand by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl end of a pre-existing strand. Therefore, DNA synthesis always proceeds in the 5'-to-3' direction.\n2.  **Antiparallel Strands:** The two strands of a DNA double helix are antiparallel. This means that if one strand runs in the 5'-to-3' direction, its complementary partner strand must run in the 3'-to-5' direction. The new strand synthesized is also antiparallel to its template strand.\n\nLet's analyze the synthesis of the leading and lagging strands based on the given scenario. The replication fork moves from left to right.\n\n**Analysis of the Leading Strand:**\nThe leading strand is defined as the strand that is synthesized continuously. For continuous synthesis to occur, the new strand must be elongated in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork, which is left to right. According to principle #1, this synthesis must occur in the 5'-to-3' direction. So, the leading strand must have a 5'-to-3' polarity from left to right.\nAccording to principle #2, the template for this new 5'-to-3' strand must be antiparallel, meaning it must have a 3'-to-5' polarity in the left-to-right direction. The problem statement specifies that the bottom parental strand is oriented 3'-to-5' from left to right. Therefore, the bottom strand serves as the template for the leading strand, which is synthesized continuously in the 5'-to-3' direction.\n\n**Analysis of the Lagging Strand:**\nThe lagging strand is synthesized using the other parental strand as a template, which is the top strand. The problem states the top strand has a 5'-to-3' polarity from left to right. Synthesis on this template must still be 5'-to-3', meaning it must proceed in a direction antiparallel to the template. Since the template is 5'-to-3' (left to right), the new strand segments (Okazaki fragments) must be synthesized 5'-to-3' (right to left). This direction is *away* from the overall movement of the replication fork. As the fork continues to move rightward, it exposes a new segment of the template, and another Okazaki fragment is initiated and synthesized. This results in the discontinuous synthesis characteristic of the lagging strand.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n*   **A. The leading strand is synthesized using the top (5'-to-3') parental strand as a template and grows continuously in a 5'-to-3' direction.**\n    This is incorrect. The top strand is the template for the lagging strand. The template for the leading strand must be 3'-to-5' to allow for continuous 5'-to-3' synthesis into the fork.\n*   **B. The lagging strand is synthesized using the bottom (3'-to-5') parental strand as a template, and it is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork.**\n    This is incorrect. The bottom strand is the template for the leading strand, not the lagging strand. Also, the lagging strand is by definition synthesized discontinuously.\n*   **C. The leading strand is synthesized using the bottom (3'-to-5') parental strand as a template and grows continuously in a 5'-to-3' direction.**\n    This is correct. As determined in our analysis, the 3'-to-5' oriented bottom strand is the template for the continuously synthesized leading strand, which grows in the 5'-to-3' direction, following the fork.\n*   **D. The lagging strand is synthesized using the top (5'-to-3') parental strand as a template, and each of its Okazaki fragments is synthesized in a 3'-to-5' direction.**\n    This is incorrect. The template for the lagging strand is indeed the top strand, but DNA synthesis never occurs in the 3'-to-5' direction.\n*   **E. Both the leading and lagging strands are synthesized discontinuously to ensure high fidelity of replication.**\n    This is incorrect. The leading strand is defined by its continuous synthesis. Fidelity is ensured by the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase, not by discontinuous synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2040563"}, {"introduction": "Having established the fork's structure, let's explore its dynamics by putting numbers to the process.

The team observes that under optimal growth conditions, a complete round of replication from the single origin, *oriC*, takes precisely 40.0 minutes. In *E. coli*, replication is a bidirectional process, meaning two replication forks move in opposite directions from the origin to copy the DNA. Considering a single one of these replication forks, calculate the average total rate of nucleotide incorporation, accounting for synthesis of both the leading and lagging strands.\n\nExpress your answer in units of nucleotides per second, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the chromosome length be $L_{\\text{bp}} = 4.64 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs and the replication time be $T = 40.0$ minutes.

For each base pair progressed by the fork, two nucleotides are incorporated (one into each new strand).

Primase", "solution": "In standard lagging-strand DNA replication in Escherichia coli, Okazaki fragments are initiated by short RNA primers synthesized by primase. The processing steps to convert discontinuous fragments into a continuous DNA strand are:\n1) Extension of primers by DNA Polymerase III to synthesize most of each Okazaki fragment.\n2) Removal of RNA primers via the $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity of DNA Polymerase I, coupled with its DNA polymerase activity to fill in the resulting gaps with DNA (nick translation).\n3) Sealing of remaining nicks (phosphodiester bond formation between adjacent DNA fragments) by DNA ligase.\n4) Helicase continues unwinding the parental duplex, and primase continues to synthesize primers; these are not part of the Okazaki-fragment processing per se.\n\nIn the hypothetical strain where primase synthesizes DNA primers instead of RNA, the primers at the $5'$ ends of Okazaki fragments are already DNA. Therefore, the specific function of DNA Polymerase I that is required to remove RNA primers and replace them with DNA is no longer necessary for processing Okazaki fragments. The remaining steps are still required: DNA Polymerase III is still needed to synthesize the bulk of each fragment, DNA ligase is still required to seal the nicks between adjacent DNA fragments (even when both sides are DNA), helicase is still required to unwind the template, and the engineered primase is still needed to lay down the DNA primers.\n\nThus, for the specific task of processing Okazaki fragments into a single continuous DNA strand, DNA Polymerase I becomes redundant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2040564"}]}
