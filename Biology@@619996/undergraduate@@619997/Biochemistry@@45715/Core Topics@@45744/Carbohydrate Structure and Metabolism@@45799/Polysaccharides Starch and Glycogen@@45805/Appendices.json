This exercise demonstrates a classic biochemical technique, exhaustive methylation analysis, used to elucidate such structural details. By analyzing the types of methylated glucose monomers produced after hydrolysis, you can quantitatively determine key architectural features of the original molecule and bridge the gap between laboratory data and the complex architecture of biopolymers [@problem_id:2063123].", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing the structure of a purified amylopectin molecule, which is a branched polymer of glucose. The molecule is known to possess a single reducing end. To determine its degree of branching, the biochemist performs an exhaustive methylation reaction on the amylopectin sample, followed by a complete acid hydrolysis to break all glycosidic bonds. This process yields a mixture of methylated glucose monomers.\n\nThe analysis of the hydrolysate identifies three main types of methylated derivatives:\n1.  2,3,6-tri-O-methylglucose, derived from the internal glucose residues in the linear chains.\n2.  2,3-di-O-methylglucose, derived from the glucose residues at the branch points.\n3.  2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose, derived from the glucose residues at the non-reducing ends.\n\nThe quantitative analysis of the mixture reveals a specific molar ratio between two of these products: for every 9 molecules of 2,3-di-O-methylglucose detected, 10 molecules of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose are found. Based on this experimental result, determine the total number of non-reducing ends in this amylopectin molecule.", "solution": "Exhaustive methylation protects all free hydroxyls by converting them to methoxy groups; positions involved in glycosidic bonds remain unmethylated. Subsequent complete acid hydrolysis cleaves all glycosidic bonds to yield monomeric methylated sugars whose methylation patterns identify the original bonding pattern of each residue:\n- 2,3,6-tri-O-methylglucose arises from internal linear residues (positions 1 and 4 glycosidically linked; 2,3,6 methylated).\n- 2,3-di-O-methylglucose arises from branch-point residues (positions 1,4,6 glycosidically linked; 2,3 methylated).\n- 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose arises from non-reducing ends (position 1 glycosidically linked; 2,3,4,6 methylated).\n\nLet $B$ be the number of branch-point residues and $N$ be the number of non-reducing ends. By the identification above, the amounts of 2,3-di-O-methylglucose and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose are proportional to $B$ and $N$, respectively.

Each branch point corresponds to a residue with two outgoing linkages (via O-4 and O-6), while non-reducing ends are leaves with no outgoing linkages. For such a rooted tree in which the root has outdegree $1$ (the usual case for amylopectin), the number of leaves equals the number of branch points plus one. This can be shown combinatorially by counting edges. Let $L$ denote the number of leaves (here $L=N$), let $I_{1}$ be the number of internal nodes with outdegree $1$, and let $I_{2}$ be the number of internal nodes with outdegree $2$ (here $I_{2}=B$). In any finite tree, the number of edges $E$ satisfies $E=V-1$, where $V=L+I_{1}+I_{2}$ is the total number of nodes. Also, the sum of outdegrees equals $E$, hence\n$$\nE=0\\cdot L+1\\cdot I_{1}+2\\cdot I_{2}=I_{1}+2B.\n$$\nUsing $E=V-1=L+I_{1}+B-1$ and equating expressions for $E$ gives\n$$\nI_{1}+2B=L+I_{1}+B-1 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; B=L-1 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; N=B+1.\n$$\n\nCombining $N=B+1$ with $B=9k$ and $N=10k$ yields\n$$\n10k=9k+1 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; k=1,\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\nN=10.\n$$\nThus, the amylopectin molecule contains exactly $10$ non-reducing ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2063123"}, {"introduction": "Cells store glucose as glycogen to buffer against fluctuating energy demands, but this metabolic flexibility comes at an energetic cost. This practice problem guides you through an essential bioenergetic calculation: determining the net expenditure of high-energy phosphate bonds required to add a glucose unit to glycogen and later release it [@problem_id:2063143]. Mastering this calculation provides insight into why metabolic pathways are structured the way they are and the thermodynamic price of maintaining energy homeostasis.", "problem": "In cellular metabolism, glycogen serves as a primary short-term storage for glucose. The processes of adding glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) and removing it (glycogenolysis) are tightly regulated and have distinct energetic requirements.\n\nConsider a single molecule of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in a liver cell. This molecule undergoes a full metabolic cycle: it is first incorporated into a large, pre-existing glycogen molecule, and then, at a later time, it is cleaved from the glycogen chain and converted back into glucose-6-phosphate.\n\nThe key transformations in this cycle are as follows:\n- **Incorporation into Glycogen**: The initial glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is first isomerized to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). This G1P is then activated by reacting with Uridine Triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose and inorganic pyrophosphate ($PP_i$). The UDP-glucose molecule then adds its glucose unit to the growing glycogen chain, releasing Uridine Diphosphate (UDP). For the cell's energetic balance, the released UDP is subsequently rephosphorylated to UTP by an ATP-dependent kinase, and the $PP_i$ produced is rapidly hydrolyzed into two separate inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) molecules.\n- **Release from Glycogen**: Cleavage of the glucose unit from the glycogen chain is accomplished by a phosphorolysis reaction, which uses an inorganic phosphate molecule ($P_i$) to produce one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). This G1P is then isomerized back to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), completing the cycle.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the net number of high-energy phosphate bonds that are cleaved to complete this entire cycle for one molecule of glucose-6-phosphate.\n\nFor the purpose of this calculation, you must adhere to the following energetic accounting rules:\n- The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and $P_i$, or UTP to UDP and $P_i$, counts as the cleavage of **one** high-energy phosphate bond.\n- The hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate ($PP_i$) to two molecules of inorganic phosphate ($2 P_i$) also counts as the cleavage of **one** high-energy phosphate bond.\n\nYour answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "We follow the molecule of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) through the described cycle and tally only the cleavages of high-energy phosphate bonds according to the stated accounting rules.\n\n1) Isomerization for incorporation:\nG6P isomerizes to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) via phosphoglucomutase: $G6P \\rightleftharpoons G1P$.\nThis is an isomerization; no high-energy phosphate bond is cleaved. Count: $0$.\n\n2) Activation to UDP-glucose:\nG1P reacts with UTP to form UDP-glucose and $PP_i$: $G1P + UTP \\to UDP-glucose + PP_i$.\nThis step cleaves a phosphoanhydride bond in UTP by phosphoryl transfer to G1P, but it is not a hydrolysis to $P_i$. Per the problem’s explicit accounting rules, we do not count this step directly as “UTP to UDP and $P_i$” hydrolysis. Instead, the energetic cost is captured by the mandated ATP-dependent rephosphorylation of UDP in step 4. Count here: $0$ by the stated rules.\n\n3) Transfer to glycogen:\nUDP-glucose donates its glucose to glycogen, releasing UDP: $UDP-glucose + \\text{glycogen}_{n} \\to \\text{glycogen}_{n+1} + UDP$.\nNo high-energy phosphate bond is hydrolyzed. Count: $0$.\n\n4) Rephosphorylation of UDP to UTP:\nUDP is regenerated to UTP by an ATP-dependent kinase: $ATP + UDP \\to ADP + UTP$.\nThis step involves cleavage of one phosphoanhydride bond of ATP (energetically equivalent to ATP → ADP + $P_i$). By the accounting rule “hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and $P_i$ counts as one high-energy phosphate bond,” we count this as one cleavage. Count: $1$.\n\n5) Hydrolysis of pyrophosphate:\nThe $PP_i$ produced in step 2 is hydrolyzed rapidly: $PP_i \\to 2 P_i$.\nBy the stated rule, this hydrolysis counts as the cleavage of one high-energy phosphate bond. Count: $1$.\n\n6) Release from glycogen and return to G6P:\nGlycogen phosphorylase cleaves a glucose from glycogen using $P_i$ to form G1P: $\\text{glycogen}_{n+1} + P_i \\to \\text{glycogen}_{n} + G1P$.\nNo ATP, UTP, or $PP_i$ hydrolysis occurs; this is a phosphorolysis. Count: $0$.\nG1P is isomerized back to G6P: $G1P \\rightleftharpoons G6P$.\nIsomerization; no high-energy phosphate bond is cleaved. Count: $0$.\n\nSumming all counted cleavages across the entire cycle gives:\nTotal high-energy phosphate bonds cleaved $= 1$ (ATP-dependent rephosphorylation) $+ 1$ ($PP_i$ hydrolysis) $= 2$.\n\nTherefore, the net number of high-energy phosphate bonds cleaved to complete the entire cycle for one molecule of G6P is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2063143"}, {"introduction": "Isotope tracing is a powerful experimental approach that allows biochemists to follow the fate of specific atoms through complex metabolic networks.
