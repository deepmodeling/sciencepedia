The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl groups on the chiral centers is as follows: C-2 is on the left, C-3 is on the left, C-4 is on the right, and C-5 is on the right.\n\nWhen D-mannose cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C-5 attacks the aldehyde carbon C-1, forming a six-membered ring known as a pyranose.
