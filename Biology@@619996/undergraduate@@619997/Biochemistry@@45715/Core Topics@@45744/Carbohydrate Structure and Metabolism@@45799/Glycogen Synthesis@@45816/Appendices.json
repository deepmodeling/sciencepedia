This activation step is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The reaction is driven forward by the subsequent, rapid hydrolysis of one of its products, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase.\n\nConsider a scenario in a laboratory setting where this two-step process is reconstituted in a test tube. The synthesis of UDP-glucose is initiated using glucose-1-phosphate and a specially prepared sample of Uridine Triphosphate (UTP). This UTP is radiolabeled with phosphorus-32 ($^{32}$P) exclusively at the β-phosphate position (the middle phosphate in the triphosphate chain).

This final practice challenges you to think like a biochemical detective by examining a hypothetical scenario involving the glycogen branching enzyme. By predicting how an altered enzyme specificity affects the final polymer's structure and solubility, you will strengthen your ability to connect molecular-level mechanics to macroscopic physiological properties [@problem_id:2048321].", "problem": "In healthy individuals, glycogen synthesis involves two key enzymes: glycogen synthase, which elongates glycogen chains by adding glucose units via α-1,4 glycosidic bonds, and the glycogen branching enzyme, amylo-(1,4→1,6)-transglycosylase. The branching enzyme is responsible for creating a new branch point by transferring a terminal segment of approximately 7 glucose residues from a pre-existing chain (which must be at least 11 residues long) to the C6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue on the same or another chain. This process results in a highly branched, globular, and soluble glycogen molecule.\n\nConsider a hypothetical, non-lethal, gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the glycogen branching enzyme. This mutation causes the enzyme to function with altered specificity: instead of transferring a 7-residue segment, it now transfers a segment of 20 glucose residues. The requirement for the donor chain length is proportionally increased, meaning a chain must be significantly longer than 20 residues before it can serve as a substrate for branching. Assume that the activity of glycogen synthase and all other aspects of glucose metabolism are unaffected.\n\nBased on these changes, how would the average chain length of the branches and the overall solubility of the resulting glycogen molecule be affected compared to normal glycogen?\n\nA. The average chain length increases, and the overall solubility increases.\n\nB. The average chain length increases, and the overall solubility decreases.\n\nC. The average chain length decreases, and the overall solubility increases.\n\nD. The average chain length decreases, and the overall solubility decreases.\n\nE.

In normal glycogen metabolism, $s$ is approximately $7$ and $L_{\\min}$ is at least $11$. In the hypothetical mutant, $s$ is increased to $20$ and $L_{\\min}$ is increased proportionally, so $L_{\\min} > 20$.\n\nThe average chain length between branch points, denoted $\\ell$, scales inversely with the density of branch points $\\rho_{b}$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\ell \\propto \\frac{1}{\\rho_{b}}.\n$$\nTwo changes in the mutant reduce $\\rho_{b}$:\n1) Larger $L_{\\min}$ postpones the earliest possible branching event on any growing chain, increasing the linear growth before branching, thereby decreasing the frequency of branch initiation per unit of chain elongation.\n2) Each branching event transfers a longer segment of length $s=20$, which directly creates longer new branches. This lengthens the average chain length of branches.\n\nThus, both the increased $L_{\\min}$ and increased $s$ lead to a decrease in $\\rho_{b}$ and therefore an increase in $\\ell$:\n$$\n\\rho_{b,\\text{mut}} < \\rho_{b,\\text{norm}} \\implies \\ell_{\\text{mut}} > \\ell_{\\text{norm}}.\n$$\n\nGlycogen solubility, denoted $S$, increases with the degree of branching because a higher branch density produces a more compact, highly hydrated, globular structure with many nonreducing ends and fewer long, linear regions prone to intermolecular associations. This qualitative dependence can be summarized as\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{d\\rho_{b}} > 0.\n$$\nSince $\\rho_{b}$ decreases in the mutant, it follows that\n$$\nS_{\\text{mut}} < S_{\\text{norm}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, relative to normal glycogen, the mutant produces glycogen with increased average chain length and decreased overall solubility.
