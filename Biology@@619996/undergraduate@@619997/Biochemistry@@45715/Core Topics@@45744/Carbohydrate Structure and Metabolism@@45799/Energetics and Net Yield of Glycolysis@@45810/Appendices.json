In the preparatory phase, energy is invested by phosphorylating the sugar backbone. In the payoff phase, this investment is recovered. A key intermediate in this process is 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. When one molecule of glucose is processed through the glycolytic pathway, it eventually yields two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. These two molecules collectively bear a total of four phosphate groups.\n\nThe phosphate groups are added from two different sources: Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) during the preparatory phase, and free inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) from the cytosol during the payoff phase. Your task is to determine the origin of these four phosphate groups on the two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the number of phosphate groups that originated from ATP and the number that originated from inorganic phosphate ($P_i$)?\n\nA. 2 from ATP; 2 from inorganic phosphate\n\nB. 4 from ATP; 0 from inorganic phosphate\n\nC. 0 from ATP; 4 from inorganic phosphate\n\nD. 1 from ATP; 3 from inorganic phosphate\n\nE. 3 from ATP; 1 from inorganic phosphate", "solution": "Glycolysis begins with phosphorylation of glucose twice using ATP, then later uses inorganic phosphate to form high-energy intermediates.\n\nFirst, in the preparatory phase, two phosphates are transferred from ATP to the hexose:\n1. Hexokinase reaction: glucose is phosphorylated at C-6 by ATP:\n$\\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP}$.\n2. Phosphofructokinase-1 reaction: fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated at C-1 by ATP:\n$\\text{Fructose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + \\text{ADP}$.\n\nAldolase then cleaves fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two triose phosphates. The phosphate at C-6 (from the hexokinase step) follows the C-4 to C-6 fragment to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and the phosphate at C-1 (from the phosphofructokinase-1 step) follows the C-1 to C-3 fragment to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Triose phosphate isomerase converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to a second glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate without altering the phosphate group. Consequently, after these steps, there are two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, each bearing one phosphate group that ultimately originated from ATP; total ATP-derived phosphates at this stage are two.\n\nIn the payoff phase, each glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized and phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase:\n$\\text{Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate} + P_i + \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{1,3-bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+$.\nIn this step, the added phosphate at the C-1 position comes from $P_i$, while the original phosphate at C-3 remains from the earlier ATP-dependent steps. Because there are two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, two phosphates are added from $P_i$ in total.\n\nTherefore, across the two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (which together carry four phosphate groups), two phosphates originated from ATP (one on each triose prior to oxidation) and two originated from inorganic phosphate $P_i$ (one added to each triose during formation of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate).

The process begins with an investment phase where two molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) are consumed to convert one molecule of glucose into two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The key difference in this organism lies in a parasitic enzymatic activity that affects the subsequent payoff phase. For every pair of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) molecules generated from a single starting molecule of glucose, the first molecule is processed normally by phosphoglycerate kinase, yielding ATP. However, the second molecule is immediately hydrolyzed to 3-phosphoglycerate by a parasitic hydrolase. This hydrolysis reaction is not coupled to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) phosphorylation and thus produces no ATP. All other steps of the glycolytic pathway, including the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the final substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, proceed with their standard stoichiometry.\n\nFor a single molecule of glucose that is completely metabolized to pyruvate through this modified pathway, determine the net number of ATP molecules and the net number of reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) molecules generated. Present your answer as two integers, representing the net ATP yield and the net NADH yield, respectively.", "solution": "We track stoichiometry per single glucose and use the standard glycolytic logic that one glucose yields two triose phosphates, so all steps from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate onward occur twice per glucose unless otherwise specified.\n\n1) Investment phase (unchanged):\nTwo ATP are consumed to convert glucose to two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules. Therefore,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{ATP}_{\\text{investment}}=-2$.\n\n2) Oxidation to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (unchanged):\nEach glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, producing one NADH. With two triose molecules per glucose,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{NADH}_{\\text{GAPDH}}=+2$.\n\n3) Phosphoglycerate kinase step (modified):\nNormally, each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a phosphate to ADP via phosphoglycerate kinase, yielding one ATP per 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Per glucose this would be $+2$ ATP. Here, for each pair of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, only the first is processed by phosphoglycerate kinase, while the second is hydrolyzed directly to 3-phosphoglycerate with no ATP formation. Therefore,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{ATP}_{\\text{PGK}}=+1$.\n\n4) Downstream to pyruvate (unchanged):\nBoth 3-phosphoglycerate molecules proceed to phosphoenolpyruvate and then to pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase generates one ATP per phosphoenolpyruvate, twice per glucose:\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{ATP}_{\\text{PK}}=+2$.\n\n5) Net ATP and NADH:\nSumming ATP changes,\n$\\mathrm{ATP}_{\\text{net}}=(-2)+(+1)+(+2)=+1$.\nNADH is produced only at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step and is unaffected by the parasitic hydrolase; no NADH consumption to pyruvate is included. Hence,\n$\\mathrm{NADH}_{\\text{net}}=+2$.\n\nTherefore, per glucose fully converted to pyruvate in this modified pathway, the net yields are $1$ ATP and $2$ NADH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2042802"}]}
