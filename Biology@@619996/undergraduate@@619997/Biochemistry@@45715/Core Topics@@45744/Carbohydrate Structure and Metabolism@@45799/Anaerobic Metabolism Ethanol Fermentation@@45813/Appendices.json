A batch of yeast is cultured in a medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source. The glucose supplied has been isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}$C) at the carbon-1 position (C-1). The yeast is maintained under strictly anaerobic conditions, ensuring that it completely metabolizes the glucose into its final fermentation products: ethanol and carbon dioxide.\n\nAssuming the catabolism of glucose proceeds via the standard Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (glycolysis) followed by ethanol fermentation, determine the fate of the isotopic label.

The C-1 of glucose becomes the C-1 of fructose-6-phosphate, and subsequently the C-1 of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\n\n2.  **Aldolase Cleavage:** The enzyme aldolase cleaves the six-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate between C-3 and C-4. This yields two three-carbon molecules:\n    *   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which consists of carbons 1, 2, and 3 of the original glucose. The $^{14}$C label is therefore on C-1 of DHAP.\n    *   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which consists of carbons 4, 5, and 6. This molecule is initially unlabeled.\n\n3.  **Triose Phosphate Isomerase:** The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase rapidly interconverts DHAP and G3P. For glycolysis to proceed, the DHAP must be converted to G3P. During this isomerization, the C-1 of DHAP becomes the C-3 of G3P. Therefore, the $^{14}$C label is now located at the C-3 position of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\n\n4.  **Payoff Phase of Glycolysis:** The subsequent reactions of glycolysis convert G3P into pyruvate. The carbon skeleton is conserved, so the C-3 of G3P becomes the C-3 of pyruvate. The C-3 of pyruvate is its methyl carbon ($\\text{CH}_3$).\n\n5.  **Ethanol Fermentation:** The final steps occur in the cytosol:\n    *   **Step 1 (Decarboxylation):** Pyruvate decarboxylase acts on pyruvate, removing the C-1 carboxyl group ($\\text{COO}^-$) as carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$). The remaining two carbons (C-2 and C-3) form acetaldehyde. Since our label is on C-3 (the methyl carbon), it is retained in the acetaldehyde molecule.\n    *   **Step 2 (Reduction):** Alcohol dehydrogenase reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol. The C-3 of the original pyruvate (the methyl group) becomes the methyl carbon of ethanol. In standard chemical nomenclature, this is the C-2 position of ethanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$).\n\nConclusion: The $^{14}$C label that started on C-1 of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C-2) of ethanol.

This scenario presents a yeast mutant lacking a key fermentative enzyme, forcing an analysis of the metabolic consequences [@problem_id:2031269]. By determining the most critical outcome, you will solidify your grasp on the essential role of fermentation in regenerating cofactors like $NAD^+$ and sustaining anaerobic glycolysis.", "problem": "A biochemist develops a mutant strain of yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme. This yeast strain is then cultured in a rich medium containing glucose as the sole carbon and energy source under strictly anaerobic conditions. Assuming the cell is initially viable and all other metabolic pathways are functional, what is the most immediate and critical metabolic consequence for this mutant yeast strain under these conditions?\n\nA. The rate of glycolysis will accelerate significantly to compensate for the inefficient ATP production.\n\nB. Pyruvate will accumulate, and the cell will switch to producing large amounts of lactic acid to regenerate NAD+.\n\nC. The intracellular ratio of NADH/NAD+ will increase dramatically, and net ATP production will cease.\n\nD. The cell will begin exporting pyruvate from the cell and importing ethanol from the medium to regenerate NAD+.\n\nE. The conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate will be immediately and completely inhibited by allosteric feedback, halting glycolysis at its first step.", "solution": "To determine the consequence of a non-functional pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast under anaerobic conditions, we must analyze the central pathway of anaerobic glucose metabolism, which is glycolysis followed by ethanol fermentation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the net reaction of glycolysis:\n$$ \\text{Glucose} + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, \\text{P}_i + 2 \\, \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Pyruvate} + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, \\text{H}^+ + 2 \\, \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nUnder anaerobic conditions, glycolysis is the only pathway available for the yeast cell to generate ATP. A critical feature of this process is that it requires a constant supply of the oxidized coenzyme NAD+ to function. Specifically, the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes a key oxidation step that converts NAD+ to NADH.\n\nIn a normal, wild-type yeast cell under anaerobic conditions, the NAD+ pool is regenerated from NADH through the two-step process of ethanol fermentation:\n1.  **Decarboxylation of Pyruvate**: Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase.\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCOO}^- + \\text{H}^+ \\xrightarrow{\\text{Pyruvate decarboxylase}} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO} + \\text{CO}_2 $$\n2.  **Reduction of Acetaldehyde**: Acetaldehyde is then reduced to ethanol, a reaction that oxidizes NADH back to NAD+. This is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+ \\xrightarrow{\\text{Alcohol dehydrogenase}} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} + \\text{NAD}^+ $$\n\nThe net effect of fermentation is the regeneration of NAD+, which allows glycolysis to continue producing ATP.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation in the mutant yeast strain with a non-functional pyruvate decarboxylase.\nStep 1 of the fermentation pathway is completely blocked. Pyruvate cannot be converted into acetaldehyde. Consequently, step 2 cannot occur because its substrate, acetaldehyde, is not being produced.\n\nThe critical consequence is that the cell has lost its primary mechanism for regenerating NAD+ from the NADH produced during glycolysis. As the cell attempts to perform glycolysis, it will consume the finite pool of available NAD+ and produce NADH. Without fermentation, the NADH will accumulate, and the NAD+ pool will be depleted. This leads to a dramatic increase in the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio.\n\nThe glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in glycolysis is absolutely dependent on NAD+ as a co-substrate. Once the NAD+ is depleted, this enzymatic step will halt. Since this step is essential for the glycolytic pathway, the entire pathway will cease to function. When glycolysis stops, the net production of 2 ATP per glucose molecule also stops. As this is the only source of ATP for the cell under these anaerobic conditions, the cell will be unable to power its essential functions and will ultimately die.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   **A:** This is incorrect. Glycolysis cannot accelerate; it is completely dependent on NAD+, which is being depleted. The pathway will halt, not accelerate.\n*   **B:** This is a common misconception. While muscle cells undergo lactic acid fermentation, the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* does not possess a significant lactate dehydrogenase pathway to handle the full glycolytic flux. Its primary anaerobic fate for pyruvate is ethanol fermentation. Thus, it cannot simply switch to producing lactate to solve the NAD+ regeneration problem. Pyruvate will accumulate, but this doesn't resolve the cofactor imbalance.\n*   **C:** This is the correct answer. The inability to re-oxidize NADH causes it to accumulate (increasing the NADH/NAD+ ratio), which depletes the NAD+ required for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step of glycolysis. This halts glycolysis and, with it, all net ATP synthesis under anaerobic conditions.\n*   **D:** This is incorrect. Importing ethanol would not regenerate NAD+. The alcohol dehydrogenase reaction would have to run in reverse (ethanol to acetaldehyde) to produce NADH, further worsening the problem. Exporting pyruvate does not solve the NAD+ regeneration issue.\n*   **E:** This is incorrect. While allosteric regulation does occur in glycolysis, the immediate, rate-limiting failure is not at the first step (hexokinase) but at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step due to substrate (NAD+) depletion. This is a more direct and unavoidable consequence than feedback inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2031269"}]}
