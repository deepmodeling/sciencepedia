This advanced problem invites you to think like a protein engineer, applying your knowledge of enzyme structure and allosteric regulation to devise a specific mutation that uncouples PFK-1 from its negative feedback inhibition by ATP. [@problem_id:2048843]", "problem": "In the metabolic pathway of glycolysis, the enzyme muscle Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) serves as a major regulatory control point. PFK-1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme's activity is intricately regulated by cellular energy levels. It uses Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) as both a substrate at a high-affinity catalytic site and as an allosteric inhibitor at a distinct, lower-affinity regulatory site. Conversely, Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP), a signal of low cellular energy, acts as a potent allosteric activator by binding to the same regulatory site as inhibitory ATP.\n\nStructural analysis has revealed key differences in how these nucleotides bind to the regulatory site. The adenine and ribose portions of both ATP and AMP are recognized by a common set of amino acid residues. The critical distinction lies in the triphosphate tail of ATP. The terminal γ-phosphate of ATP, which is absent in AMP, forms a specific, crucial salt bridge with the side chain of a particular positively charged amino acid residue. This interaction is essential for stabilizing the enzyme in its inactive T-state, thereby causing inhibition.\n\nImagine you are designing a mutant variant of PFK-1. Your goal is to create an enzyme that is no longer inhibited by high concentrations of ATP but retains its normal catalytic function and remains fully responsive to allosteric activation by AMP. Based on the information provided, which of the following single amino acid substitutions at the regulatory site is most likely to achieve this specific outcome?\n\nA. A mutation of the key positively charged residue involved in the salt bridge to an Alanine (Ala).\n\nB.

A mutation of the key positively charged residue involved in the salt bridge to a Lysine (Lys).\n\nE. A mutation of a Glutamate (Glu) residue, located near the ribose-binding pocket, to an Aspartate (Asp).", "solution": "The central task is to identify a single amino acid mutation in the regulatory site of Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) that eliminates allosteric inhibition by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) while preserving catalytic activity and allosteric activation by Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP).\n\nFirst, we must analyze the structural basis for regulation as described in the problem.\n1.  **Catalytic Site:** This site binds ATP as a substrate and is distinct from the regulatory site. Any mutation here would affect the enzyme's fundamental catalytic activity.\n2.  **Regulatory Site:** This site binds both ATP (as an inhibitor) and AMP (as an activator).\n3.  **Binding Mechanism:** The adenine and ribose parts of both ATP and AMP interact with a common set of residues at the regulatory site. This means that the enzyme's ability to recognize the core nucleotide structure is shared between the activator and the inhibitor.\n4.  **The Key Difference:** The inhibitory effect of ATP is specifically due to an interaction involving its terminal γ-phosphate. This negatively charged phosphate group forms a salt bridge with a positively charged amino acid residue. This specific interaction, which AMP cannot form (as it lacks the β and γ phosphates), is what stabilizes the inactive T-state.\n\nOur goal is to disrupt the interaction unique to ATP without affecting the interactions common to both ATP and AMP, and without touching the catalytic site. The unique interaction is the salt bridge between the γ-phosphate of ATP and a positively charged residue. Therefore, the most logical strategy is to mutate this specific positively charged residue to break the salt bridge.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. A mutation of the key positively charged residue involved in the salt bridge to an Alanine (Ala).**\nThe problem states that a positively charged residue (like Arginine or Lysine) forms a salt bridge with ATP's negative γ-phosphate. Alanine has a small, nonpolar, and uncharged side chain. Replacing the positively charged residue with Alanine would eliminate the positive charge necessary for the salt bridge. This would completely disrupt the specific interaction that allows ATP to stabilize the T-state and act as an inhibitor. Since the mutation targets the interaction unique to ATP, the binding of AMP (which interacts with the common adenine/ribose binding pocket) should be largely unaffected. Furthermore, because this mutation is at the regulatory site, the catalytic site remains intact, preserving catalytic activity. This option perfectly matches our design criteria.\n\n**B. A mutation of a Phenylalanine (Phe) residue involved in aromatic stacking with the adenine ring to a Glycine (Gly).**\nThe problem states that the adenine ring is part of the common structure recognized for both ATP and AMP. Aromatic stacking with a Phenylalanine residue is a likely interaction for this recognition. Mutating Phenylalanine to Glycine would remove the bulky aromatic side chain, severely impairing the binding of the adenine ring. Since this interaction is common to both ATP and AMP, this mutation would likely abolish both ATP inhibition and AMP activation. This fails the condition of preserving AMP activation.\n\n**C. A mutation of an Aspartate (Asp) residue, which chelates the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion at the catalytic site, to an Asparagine (Asn).**\nThis mutation is explicitly located at the catalytic site, not the regulatory site. Such a mutation would affect the enzyme's ability to bind the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$-ATP substrate complex, thereby impairing or destroying its catalytic function. This violates a primary constraint of the problem.\n\n**D. A mutation of the key positively charged residue involved in the salt bridge to a Lysine (Lys).**\nThis is a conservative mutation. Both Arginine (the likely original residue) and Lysine have positively charged side chains at physiological pH. While the geometry and length of the side chains differ, a Lysine could still potentially form a salt bridge with ATP's γ-phosphate. Therefore, this mutation might weaken the inhibition but is unlikely to *abolish* it as effectively as removing the charge entirely. It is not the best choice for completely eliminating the inhibitory effect.\n\n**E. A mutation of a Glutamate (Glu) residue, located near the ribose-binding pocket, to an Aspartate (Asp).**\nGlutamate and Aspartate are both negatively charged amino acids. First, a negatively charged residue would not be forming a favorable salt bridge with the negatively charged phosphate group of ATP. Second, this is a conservative mutation (negative to negative, with a slightly shorter side chain), which would likely have a minimal effect on the protein's structure or function. It does not target the key interaction responsible for ATP-specific inhibition.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the only choice that specifically targets and disrupts the unique inhibitory action of ATP without compromising the enzyme's catalytic function or its activation by AMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2048843"}]}
