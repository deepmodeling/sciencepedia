The aldehyde-equivalent at C-1 of G6P is oxidized to a lactone, and NADP$^{+}$ is reduced to NADPH. The labeled carbon remains at the C-1 position of the sugar acid framework:\n$$\n\\text{G6P}(C_{1}^{*},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4},C_{5},C_{6}) \\longrightarrow \\text{6-P-glucono-}$\\delta$\\text{-lactone}(C_{1}^{*},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4},C_{5},C_{6}) + \\text{NADPH}.\n$$\n\nStep 2: Hydrolysis of the lactone to 6-phosphogluconate.

This practice problem challenges you to calculate the net result of converting pentose phosphates into glycolytic intermediates, a common physiological scenario when nucleotide synthesis is not the priority. Successfully solving this requires a careful accounting of the carbons shuffled by the key enzymes, transketolase and transaldolase, revealing the pathway's role in salvaging carbon skeletons.", "problem": "In a cellular context where nucleotide degradation has produced an excess of pentose sugars, a metabolic pathway is activated to convert these sugars into forms usable for either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.

The non-oxidative reactions include isomerization, epimerization, transketolase (two-carbon transfer), and transaldolase (three-carbon transfer). These reactions conserve the number of phosphate groups and do not change the overall number of carbons; they only rearrange carbon skeletons.\n\nFirst, two of the three ribose-5-phosphate molecules are converted to xylulose-5-phosphate by isomerase (ribose-5-phosphate to ribulose-5-phosphate) followed by epimerase (ribulose-5-phosphate to xylulose-5-phosphate), leaving one ribose-5-phosphate unchanged. Thus, from $3$ molecules of ribose-5-phosphate, we consider the pool as $2$ molecules of xylulose-5-phosphate and $1$ molecule of ribose-5-phosphate available for carbon rearrangements.\n\nApply the standard sequence of non-oxidative reactions:\n\n1) Transketolase transfers a two-carbon unit from xylulose-5-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Xu5P} + \\mathrm{R5P} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{GAP} + \\mathrm{S7P}\n$$\nThis conserves carbons since $5+5=3+7$.\n\n2) Transaldolase transfers a three-carbon unit from sedoheptulose-7-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:\n$$\n\\mathrm{S7P} + \\mathrm{GAP} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{F6P} + \\mathrm{E4P}\n$$\nThis also conserves carbons with $7+3=6+4$.\n\n3) A second transketolase transfers a two-carbon unit from the remaining xylulose-5-phosphate to erythrose-4-phosphate:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Xu5P} + \\mathrm{E4P} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{GAP} + \\mathrm{F6P}\n$$\nAgain, carbon balance holds since $5+4=3+6$.\n\nNow sum the three reactions.

In this cycle, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) enters the oxidative phase of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP). The resulting pentose phosphate carbon skeletons are not withdrawn for biosynthesis but are instead channeled through the non-oxidative phase of the PPP and parts of the gluconeogenic pathway to regenerate G6P.
