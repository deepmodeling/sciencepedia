This citrate acts as an allosteric regulator for the key enzymes controlling the flux between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis at the fructose-6-phosphate level.

You will analyze a hypothetical genetic disorder to uncover how the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/FBPase-2 integrates hormonal signals to precisely control the level of F-2,6-BP. This practice highlights how a single regulatory molecule can decisively dictate the net flux between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis [@problem_id:2069346].", "problem": "In the liver, the flux through glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is reciprocally regulated at the level of the interconversion between fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This step is catalyzed by Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) in the glycolytic direction and Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 (FBPase-1) in the gluconeogenic direction. A key allosteric regulator for both enzymes is fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a molecule whose concentration is controlled by a single bifunctional enzyme known as Phosphofructokinase-2/Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-2 (PFK-2/FBPase-2). The PFK-2 domain synthesizes F2,6BP, while the FBPase-2 domain degrades it. F2,6BP is a potent activator of PFK-1 and an inhibitor of FBPase-1.\n\nConsider a rare genetic disorder where a mutation in the gene for the bifunctional enzyme causes its FBPase-2 phosphatase domain to be constitutively active, meaning it is always functional irrespective of hormonal signals like glucagon or insulin. Which of the following describes the most direct and significant metabolic consequence of this mutation on hepatic glucose metabolism under conditions where both glucose and gluconeogenic precursors are available?\n\nA. A substantial increase in the rate of glycolysis due to the accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate, which mass-action drives the PFK-1 reaction forward.\n\nB. A significant stimulation of gluconeogenesis, as the key glycolytic enzyme PFK-1 will be strongly inhibited and the key gluconeogenic enzyme FBPase-1 will be disinhibited.\n\nC.

A significant stimulation of glycolysis, as the bifunctional enzyme's hyperactivity leads to a compensatory over-activation of PFK-1 to maintain glucose homeostasis.\n\nE. Both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis will proceed at high rates simultaneously, leading to a massive, unregulated futile cycle and net ATP hydrolysis.", "solution": "We analyze the regulatory network governing the interconversion between fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) in the liver. The allosteric effector fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP) is synthesized by the PFK-2 domain and degraded by the FBPase-2 domain of the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/FBPase-2. Let $[F-2,6-BP]$ denote the concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. Its time evolution is given symbolically by\n$$\n\\frac{d[F-2,6-BP]}{dt} = v_{\\text{PFK-2}} - v_{\\text{FBPase-2}}.\n$$\nA mutation that renders the FBPase-2 domain constitutively active implies $v_{\\text{FBPase-2}}$ is persistently high and unresponsive to hormonal regulation, while $v_{\\text{PFK-2}}$ remains physiological. At steady state,\n$$\n0 = v_{\\text{PFK-2}} - v_{\\text{FBPase-2}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_{\\text{FBPase-2}} \\geq v_{\\text{PFK-2}} \\ \\text{forces} \\ [F-2,6-BP] \\ \\text{to a low level}.\n$$\nThus, the most direct consequence is a chronic decrease in $[F-2,6-BP]$.\n\nNext, we connect $[F-2,6-BP]$ to the velocities of the opposing enzymes PFK-1 (glycolysis) and FBPase-1 (gluconeogenesis). For PFK-1, $[F-2,6-BP]$ is a potent allosteric activator that lowers the effective $K_{0.5}$ for F6P and increases catalytic efficiency. Symbolically, one may write a Hill-type rate for PFK-1 as\n$$\nv_{\\text{PFK-1}} = V_{\\max,g} \\frac{[F6P]^{n}}{K_{0.5}([F-2,6-BP])^{n} + [F6P]^{n}},\n$$\nwith $\\frac{dK_{0.5}}{d[F-2,6-BP]} < 0$, so that decreasing $[F-2,6-BP]$ increases $K_{0.5}$ and decreases $v_{\\text{PFK-1}}$ at physiological $[F6P]$. In contrast, FBPase-1 is inhibited by F-2,6-BP; a representative inhibitory form is\n$$\nv_{\\text{FBPase-1}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,gg}}{1 + \\frac{[F-2,6-BP]}{K_{i}}} \\cdot f([F1,6BP], \\text{other effectors}),\n$$\nso that $\\frac{dv_{\\text{FBPase-1}}}{d[F-2,6-BP]} < 0$. Therefore, a decrease in $[F-2,6-BP]$ simultaneously decreases glycolytic flux through PFK-1 and increases gluconeogenic flux through FBPase-1.\n\nBecause PFK-1 and FBPase-1 are the principal reciprocally regulated control points of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the direction of net flux between F6P and F1,6BP is dominated by $[F-2,6-BP]$. With $[F-2,6-BP]$ low due to constitutive FBPase-2 activity, the net flux is driven toward F6P via FBPase-1, i.e., toward gluconeogenesis. This remains true even when both glucose and gluconeogenic precursors are available, because the allosteric control at this irreversible step overrides modest changes in substrate levels; mass-action elevation of $[F6P]$ cannot effectively overcome a strongly inhibited PFK-1 under low $[F-2,6-BP]$.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant metabolic consequence of constitutively active FBPase-2 in the liver is suppression of PFK-1 and disinhibition of FBPase-1, leading to a significant stimulation of gluconeogenesis. This corresponds to option B. The other options are inconsistent: A and D incorrectly predict increased glycolysis despite low $[F-2,6-BP]$; C and E incorrectly predict simultaneous high fluxes or shutdown, whereas reciprocal regulation enforces net gluconeogenic flux under low $[F-2,6-BP]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2069346"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves to another crucial control point—the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate—to illustrate how hormonal signals prevent wasteful futile cycling.

A pronounced difficulty in maintaining blood glucose levels, leading to fasting hypoglycemia.\n\nD. An accelerated rate of fatty acid synthesis within the liver.", "solution": "We analyze the regulation of the liver isozyme of pyruvate kinase (PK-L) under hormonal control and its role in coordinating glycolysis and gluconeogenesis during fasting.\n\n1) Biochemical role and regulation of PK-L:\n- The PK-L reaction is an essentially irreversible step in glycolysis:\n$$\\text{PEP} + \\text{ADP} \\longrightarrow \\text{pyruvate} + \\text{ATP}.$$\n- In hepatocytes, glucagon signaling during fasting increases intracellular cyclic AMP, activating protein kinase A (PKA). A key regulatory effect is the phosphorylation of PK-L by PKA, which decreases its catalytic activity. Symbolically, if $v_{\\text{PK}}$ denotes the catalytic rate, then under fasting with intact regulation,\n$$v_{\\text{PK}}^{\\text{fasting, WT}} \\downarrow \\quad \\text{due to PKA-mediated phosphorylation}.$$\n- This downregulation prevents a futile cycle with gluconeogenesis, in which phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) produced by gluconeogenesis would otherwise be immediately reconverted to pyruvate by PK. By keeping $v_{\\text{PK}}$ low, the liver allows PEP to proceed toward glucose production.\n\n2) The mutation described:\n- The mutation renders PK-L insensitive to phosphorylation by PKA but does not alter its basal catalytic properties or allosteric regulation (e.g., activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate). Therefore, under fasting with elevated PKA activity, the mutant enzyme remains in a high-activity state relative to the phosphorylated wild-type. Symbolically,\n$$v_{\\text{PK}}^{\\text{fasting, mutant}} \\approx v_{\\text{PK}}^{\\text{dephospho}} \\quad \\text{(insensitive to PKA)}.$$\n- Upstream glycolytic control during fasting still suppresses phosphofructokinase-1 via low fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (due to PKA action on the bifunctional enzyme), high citrate, and high ATP. Thus de novo glycolytic flux from glucose is reduced. However, gluconeogenesis generates PEP via oxaloacetate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. With PK inappropriately active, PEP is diverted back to pyruvate:\n$$\\text{PEP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{PK active}} \\text{pyruvate},$$\nwhich directly opposes the gluconeogenic flux that requires PEP to proceed to glucose. Because the PK step is thermodynamically and kinetically oriented toward pyruvate formation under cellular conditions, active PK in fasting causes a futile cycle and reduces hepatic glucose output.\n\n3) Physiological consequence during prolonged fasting:\n- Maintenance of blood glucose during prolonged fasting (e.g., 24 hours) depends predominantly on gluconeogenesis. Inappropriate activation of PK-L impairs hepatic glucose production by siphoning PEP away from glucose synthesis. Denote hepatic glucose output by $J_{\\text{HGO}}$; then\n$$J_{\\text{HGO}}^{\\text{mutant}} < J_{\\text{HGO}}^{\\text{WT}} \\quad \\text{(during fasting)}.$$\n- The expected systemic outcome is difficulty maintaining euglycemia, leading to fasting hypoglycemia.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Chronic hyperglycemia due to unopposed gluconeogenesis is incorrect; gluconeogenesis is opposed by the inappropriately active PK-L.\n- B: Inability to carry out glycolysis with blood lactate accumulation is incorrect; basal PK catalytic activity is intact and not diminished; furthermore, the defect would not principally cause an inability to perform glycolysis in liver.\n- C: Pronounced difficulty maintaining blood glucose with fasting hypoglycemia is the expected consequence of reduced hepatic glucose output due to active PK opposing gluconeogenesis.\n- D: Accelerated fatty acid synthesis during fasting is unlikely; fasting hormonal milieu suppresses lipogenesis despite PK activity.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is fasting hypoglycemia.\n\nNo mistakes are identified in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2069354"}]}
