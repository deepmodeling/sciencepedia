D-Galactose and D-Fructose", "solution": "We identify the constituent monosaccharides of lactose from its systematic name. The name $\\beta$-D-galactopyranosyl-$(1\\rightarrow 4)$-D-glucose indicates that the anomeric carbon ($C_{1}$) of D-galactose in the $\\beta$ configuration is linked via a glycosidic bond to the $C_{4}$ hydroxyl group of D-glucose. Thus, lactose is composed of D-galactose and D-glucose.\n\nThe relevant chemical principle is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond, which cleaves the bond by addition of water across the acetal linkage, regenerating the two parent monosaccharides. The stoichiometry is one molecule of water per glycosidic bond cleaved.\n\nWriting the reaction schematically,\n$$\n\\text{lactose} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\xrightarrow{\\text{H}^{+}} \\text{D-galactose} + \\text{D-glucose}.\n$$\nTherefore, complete acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of one molecule of lactose yields D-galactose and D-glucose, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2049391"}, {"introduction": "A subtle difference in molecular structure can lead to a dramatic difference in chemical reactivity. This practice explores the crucial distinction between reducing and non-reducing sugars by examining the unique structure of trehalose. By predicting the outcome of a Benedict's test, you will learn why the involvement of both anomeric carbons in a glycosidic bond fundamentally alters a sugar's chemical properties. [@problem_id:2049326]", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the metabolism of certain extremophilic insects that can survive severe dehydration. They isolate a major disaccharide from the insect's hemolymph, which is identified as trehalose. Structural analysis reveals that trehalose is composed of two D-glucose units joined by a glycosidic bond. The specific linkage is described as $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow1)$, meaning the anomeric carbon (C-1) of one glucose molecule is linked to the anomeric carbon (C-1) of the other glucose molecule, and both participating anomeric carbons are in the alpha ($\\alpha$) configuration.\n\nTo characterize its chemical properties, the biochemist performs a Benedict's test. Benedict's reagent contains copper(II) ions ($Cu^{2+}$) in an alkaline solution, which produces a characteristic color change from blue to a brick-red precipitate when reduced to copper(I) oxide ($Cu_2O$) by a reducing sugar. A reducing sugar is defined as any carbohydrate that possesses a free hemiacetal group, allowing it to open into a ring form with a reactive aldehyde group.\n\nBased on the structure of trehalose, which of the following outcomes should the biochemist expect from the Benedict's test, and what is the correct reasoning?\n\nA. A positive test, because trehalose is a disaccharide made of glucose, and glucose is a reducing sugar.\nB. A positive test, because the $\\alpha$ linkages are easily hydrolyzed in the alkaline conditions of the test, releasing free glucose.\nC. A negative test, because both anomeric carbons are locked in the glycosidic bond, preventing the formation of a free aldehyde group.\nD. A negative test, because disaccharides are generally too large to react with the Benedict's reagent.", "solution": "A Benedict's test detects reducing sugars, which are carbohydrates that possess a free hemiacetal at the anomeric carbon. In aqueous solution, a free hemiacetal is in equilibrium with the open-chain form that contains an aldehyde, which can reduce copper(II) to copper(I) oxide. In contrast, when the anomeric carbon is converted from a hemiacetal to an acetal by glycosidic bond formation, it is no longer in equilibrium with an open-chain aldehyde and therefore cannot act as a reducing agent under the alkaline conditions of Benedict's reagent.\n\nFor trehalose, structural analysis shows an $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow 1)$ linkage between the two D-glucose units. This means the C-1 of one glucose is linked to the C-1 of the other glucose, and both anomeric carbons are in the $\\alpha$ configuration. Consequently, both anomeric carbons are engaged in glycosidic acetal linkages, so neither glucose unit retains a free hemiacetal. Because acetals are stable to base, the alkaline conditions of Benedict's reagent do not hydrolyze these linkages to release free glucose; hydrolysis of acetals generally requires acid or specific enzymes (e.g., trehalase).\n\nTherefore, trehalose lacks a free hemiacetal and cannot generate an open-chain aldehyde under the test conditions. It will not reduce copper(II) to copper(I) oxide, so the Benedict's test is negative.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because being composed of glucose does not make the disaccharide reducing; the key requirement is a free anomeric hemiacetal, which trehalose lacks.\n- B is incorrect because glycosidic acetals are not readily hydrolyzed by base; Benedict's reagent does not liberate free glucose from trehalose under its alkaline conditions.\n- C is correct because both anomeric carbons are locked in an acetal glycosidic bond, preventing formation of a free aldehyde group.\n- D is incorrect because size is not the determinant; many disaccharides (e.g., maltose, lactose) are reducing if they retain a free anomeric carbon.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is a negative Benedict's test with the given reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2049326"}, {"introduction": "Biochemistry often connects the molecular world to measurable physical properties.
