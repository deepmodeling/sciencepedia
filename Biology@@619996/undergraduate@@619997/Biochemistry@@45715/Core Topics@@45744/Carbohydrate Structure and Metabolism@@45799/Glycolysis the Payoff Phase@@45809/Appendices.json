The calculation must be performed for two molecules of G3P, as the preparatory phase of glycolysis produces two three-carbon molecules (one G3P and one dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is isomerized to G3P) from one molecule of glucose.\n\nLet's first analyze the stoichiometry for the conversion of a single molecule of G3P to pyruvate. The key reactants and products we are tracking are ATP, Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), NADH, $NAD^+$, inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), $H_2O$, and $H^+$.\n\n**Step 1: Oxidation of G3P by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.**\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\text{G3P} + \\text{NAD}^+ + \\text{P}_i \\rightarrow \\text{1,3-bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{NADH} + H^+ $$\nIn this step, one molecule of NADH and one proton ($H^+$) are produced.\n- ATP produced: 0\n- NADH produced: +1\n- $H_2O$ produced: 0\n- $H^+$ produced: +1\n\n**Step 2: Substrate-level phosphorylation by phosphoglycerate kinase.**\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\text{1,3-bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{3-phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP} $$\nHere, one molecule of ATP is synthesized.\n- ATP produced: +1\n- NADH produced: 0\n- $H_2O$ produced: 0\n- $H^+$ produced: 0\n\n**Step 3: Isomerization by phosphoglycerate mutase.**\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\text{3-phosphoglycerate} \\rightarrow \\text{2-phosphoglycerate} $$\nThis reaction is an isomerization and does not involve the net consumption or production of any of the molecules of interest.\n- Net change for ATP, NADH, $H_2O$, $H^+$: 0\n\n**Step 4: Dehydration by enolase.**\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\text{2-phosphoglycerate} \\rightarrow \\text{phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)} + H_2O $$\nThis dehydration reaction produces one molecule of water.\n- ATP produced: 0\n- NADH produced: 0\n- $H_2O$ produced: +1\n- $H^+$ produced: 0\n\n**Step 5: Substrate-level phosphorylation by pyruvate kinase.**\nThe reaction is commonly written as:\n$$ \\text{PEP} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{pyruvate} + \\text{ATP} $$\nThis reaction produces a second molecule of ATP. In many standard textbook representations, this reaction is shown with no net change in protons, as the proton consumed during the tautomerization of the initial product (enolpyruvate) to the final product (pyruvate) is often omitted for stoichiometric simplicity in the overall pathway. We will follow this common convention.\n- ATP produced: +1\n- NADH produced: 0\n- $H_2O$ produced: 0\n- $H^+$ produced: 0\n\nNow, we sum the net production for the conversion of **one** molecule of G3P to pyruvate:\n- Net ATP produced = 0 (Step 1) + 1 (Step 2) + 0 (Step 3) + 0 (Step 4) + 1 (Step 5) = 2\n- Net NADH produced = 1 (Step 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1\n- Net $H_2O$ produced = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Step 4) + 0 = 1\n- Net $H^+$ produced = 1 (Step 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nThe problem asks for the net production starting from **two** molecules of G3P. Therefore, we must multiply the results for a single molecule by 2:\n- Total Net ATP produced = $2 \\times 2 = 4$\n- Total Net NADH produced = $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n- Total Net $H_2O$ produced = $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n- Total Net $H^+$ produced = $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n\nThe resulting ordered quadruple for (ATP, NADH, $H_2O$, $H^+$) is (4, 2, 2, 2).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA.

Assuming the pathway proceeds to completion, which carbon atom of the resulting pyruvate molecule will be radiolabeled?\n\nFor the purpose of this question, the carbons in pyruvate are numbered according to standard biochemical convention: C-1 is the carboxyl carbon, C-2 is the keto carbon, and C-3 is the methyl carbon.\n\nA.

This reaction preserves the carbon skeleton and carbon numbering. Therefore, the label remains at $C_{1}$:\n$C_{1}(\\text{G3P}) \\to C_{1}(\\text{1,3-BPG}).$\n\n2) Phosphoglycerate kinase: Transfer of the acyl phosphate from $C_{1}$ to ADP forms 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG). The carboxyl carbon remains $C_{1}$, so the label stays at $C_{1}$:\n$C_{1}(\\text{1,3-BPG}) \\to C_{1}(\\text{3-PG}).$\n\n3) Phosphoglycerate mutase: The phosphate migrates from $C_{3}$ to $C_{2}$ to form 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). This is an intramolecular rearrangement that does not alter the carbon skeleton or numbering, so the label remains at $C_{1}$:\n$C_{1}(\\text{3-PG}) \\to C_{1}(\\text{2-PG}).$\n\n4) Enolase: Dehydration of 2-PG forms phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The carbon framework and numbering are preserved; the label remains at $C_{1}$:\n$C_{1}(\\text{2-PG}) \\to C_{1}(\\text{PEP}).$\n\n5) Pyruvate kinase (followed by enol-keto tautomerization): Phosphate transfer from PEP to ADP yields the enol form of pyruvate, which tautomerizes to keto pyruvate. This step does not reassign carbon positions; thus the labeled carboxyl carbon remains $C_{1}$ in pyruvate:\n$C_{1}(\\text{PEP}) \\to C_{1}(\\text{pyruvate}).$\n\nNo decarboxylation occurs during the glycolytic payoff phase, so the label is not lost as carbon dioxide. Starting specifically with G3P (and not with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and triose scrambling), there is no equal distribution of label between ends. Therefore, the radioactive carbon from $C_{1}$ of G3P appears at the carboxyl carbon $C_{1}$ of pyruvate.\n\nConclusion: The radiolabel will be at the carboxyl carbon ($C_{1}$) of pyruvate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2048613"}, {"introduction": "To truly appreciate the elegant design of a metabolic pathway, it is useful to consider hypothetical scenarios that deviate from the norm.
