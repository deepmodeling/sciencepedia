Answering this question reveals why the Cori cycle is not a self-sustaining loop but rather a strategic shift of the metabolic burden from the anaerobic muscle to the aerobic liver.", "problem": "During short bursts of intense physical exertion, skeletal muscle cells generate energy primarily through anaerobic glycolysis. The lactate produced is then transported to the liver to be converted back into glucose, which can be returned to the muscles. This metabolic loop is crucial for sustaining high-intensity activity.\n\nConsider one complete cycle, which begins with one molecule of glucose in a muscle cell and ends when one molecule of glucose is synthesized in the liver and made available for transport back to the muscle. The two key processes involved have the following energetic stoichiometries:\n\n1.  **In the muscle:** The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of lactate results in a net production of 2 molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n2.  **In the liver:** The synthesis of one molecule of glucose from two molecules of lactate, a process known as gluconeogenesis, requires the consumption of 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP).\n\nFor the purpose of energetic accounting, assume that one molecule of ATP and one molecule of GTP are equivalent in terms of high-energy phosphate bonds.\n\nCalculate the net energetic cost, in terms of the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP and GTP), for one complete turn of this cycle.

In reality, exercising muscle primarily draws upon its internal stores of glycogen, not free glucose from the blood. This practice adjusts our starting point to glycogen, revealing how this subtle change in the initial substrate impacts the energy balance of the Cori cycle [@problem_id:2082189]. By comparing the result of this problem with the previous one, you will appreciate the biochemical efficiency gained by starting glycolysis from stored glycogen.", "problem": "During a period of intense anaerobic exertion, such as a sprint, muscle cells rely on the breakdown of their glycogen stores for rapid energy production. The glucose units from glycogen are catabolized to lactate via anaerobic glycolysis. This lactate is then released into the bloodstream and transported to the liver. In hepatocytes, the lactate undergoes gluconeogenesis to be converted back into glucose. This newly synthesized glucose is subsequently released into the bloodstream, where it can be taken up again by the muscles or other tissues. This inter-organ metabolic pathway is known as the Cori cycle.\n\nConsider the completion of one full turn of this cycle for a single glucose unit. Assume one mole of glucose units (entering glycolysis as glucose-6-phosphate from glycogen) is catabolized in the muscle to produce two moles of lactate. These two moles of lactate are then transported to the liver and converted back into one mole of free glucose.\n\nCalculate the net energetic cost to the body for this entire process. Express this cost as the net change in the number of moles of high-energy phosphate bonds. For this calculation, you may consider one mole of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to be energetically equivalent to one mole of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).

This cycle is crucial for sustaining muscle activity during intense exercise and for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting. Consider a patient with a rare genetic disorder characterized by a severe deficiency in the activity of the liver-specific enzyme pyruvate carboxylase.

Consequently, gluconeogenesis from lactate (and alanine) is markedly reduced because the pathway from pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate is blocked at the pyruvate carboxylase step. The immediate metabolic consequence during strenuous exercise is that the liver cannot effectively convert lactate to glucose, leading to decreased hepatic glucose output via the Cori cycle and a tendency for lactate to accumulate rather than be cleared.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because pyruvate carboxylase deficiency decreases, not increases, hepatic glucose synthesis from lactate.\n- B is incorrect because impaired hepatic clearance of lactate predicts increased, not decreased, blood lactate.\n- C is incorrect because oxaloacetate production is limited, so accumulation is not expected.\n- D is correct because the block at pyruvate carboxylase impairs gluconeogenesis from lactate in the liver.\n- E is incorrect because muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase and does not perform net gluconeogenesis; the liver defect would not accelerate lactate conversion to glycogen in muscle and would more likely reduce glucose availability to muscle.\n\nTherefore, the most likely metabolic consequence is impaired synthesis of glucose from lactate in the liver.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2082198"}]}
