This process involves the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol and carbon dioxide, allowing for the regeneration of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ($\\text{NAD}^{+}$) from its reduced form, NADH.\n\nImagine a novel strain of yeast is created through genetic engineering. In this modified strain, the native machinery for alcoholic fermentation is replaced with the enzymatic machinery for homolactic fermentation, the pathway used by animal muscle cells during intense exercise. Specifically, the yeast now possesses a functional lactate dehydrogenase enzyme instead of its usual pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.\n\nStarting with a single molecule of glucose, what are the net final products generated by this engineered yeast cell's anaerobic metabolism? For the purposes of this question, consider only the products of the glycolysis and fermentation pathways, and do not include inorganic phosphate, protons, or water in the final tally of products.\n\nA. 2 molecules of Ethanol, 2 molecules of Carbon Dioxide, and 2 molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nB. 2 molecules of Pyruvate, 2 molecules of ATP, and 2 molecules of NADH.\n\nC. 2 molecules of Lactate and 2 molecules of ATP.\n\nD. 2 molecules of Lactate, 2 molecules of Carbon Dioxide, and 2 molecules of ATP.\n\nE. 2 molecules of Pyruvate and 2 molecules of Lactate.", "solution": "Under anaerobic conditions, glycolysis converts one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate with a net production of ATP and reduction of $\\text{NAD}^{+}$ to $\\text{NADH}$.

This is absolutely critical for sustaining glycolysis under anaerobic conditions.
