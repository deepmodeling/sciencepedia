{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Metabolic pathways can often be understood by observing what happens when they are selectively blocked. This practice uses a classic example, 2-deoxyglucose, to explore inhibition at the very first step of glycolysis. By analyzing how this glucose analog gets \"stuck\" in the pathway, you will uncover the powerful mechanism of product inhibition, where the accumulation of a product analog feedback-inhibits the enzyme that produced it, namely hexokinase [@problem_id:2071030].", "problem": "2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) is a glucose analog that differs from glucose by the absence of a hydroxyl group at the C2 position, which is replaced by a hydrogen atom. Like glucose, 2-DG is transported into cells and is a substrate for the enzyme hexokinase, which phosphorylates it to form 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2-DG-6P) in an ATP-dependent reaction. However, due to the missing C2 hydroxyl group, 2-DG-6P cannot be isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase. Consequently, 2-DG-6P becomes a \"dead-end\" product that cannot be further metabolized through the glycolytic pathway. Given this information, which of the following statements best describes the primary mechanism by which 2-DG acts as a potent inhibitor of glucose metabolism via glycolysis?\n\nA. 2-deoxyglucose acts as a competitive inhibitor, directly competing with glucose for the active site of hexokinase, thus reducing the rate of glucose phosphorylation.\n\nB. The product, 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, accumulates in the cell and acts as a powerful allosteric inhibitor of hexokinase, preventing the phosphorylation of glucose.\n\nC. The accumulated 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate acts as an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the primary rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.\n\nD. The continuous phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose depletes the cell's supply of ATP, which is required for the initial steps of glycolysis, thereby halting the pathway due to energy starvation.\n\nE. 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate directly binds to and inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in the payoff phase of glycolysis.", "solution": "We consider the enzymatic steps in glycolysis and how 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) perturbs them.\n\n1) Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose in the ATP-dependent reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{hexokinase}} \\text{glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP}.\n$$\n2-DG is transported into cells similarly to glucose and is also a substrate for hexokinase:\n$$\n\\text{2-DG} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{hexokinase}} \\text{2-DG-6P} + \\text{ADP}.\n$$\n\n2) Phosphoglucose isomerase normally catalyzes the reversible isomerization:\n$$\n\\text{glucose-6-phosphate} \\xrightleftharpoons[\\text{PGI}]{} \\text{fructose-6-phosphate}.\n$$\nHowever, due to the absence of the C2 hydroxyl group, $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ cannot be isomerized by phosphoglucose isomerase and thus becomes a metabolic dead-end.

Because $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ is structurally analogous to glucose-6-phosphate at the phosphate-bearing position, its accumulation exerts strong product-like allosteric inhibition on hexokinase. This reduces the phosphorylation of both glucose and 2-DG, thereby diminishing flux into glycolysis at its entry step.\n\n4) Evaluate the options in light of these principles:\n- Option A states that 2-DG acts as a competitive inhibitor at hexokinase. While 2-DG competes with glucose for hexokinase binding, it is a bona fide substrate that is turned over to $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ rather than a simple competitive inhibitor that binds without catalysis. The predominant inhibitory effect arises from accumulated $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ feeding back on hexokinase.\n- Option B states that accumulated $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ allosterically inhibits hexokinase. This matches the well-established product inhibition mechanism whereby hexokinase is inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate and analogs such as $\\text{2-DG-6P}$.\n- Option C invokes allosteric inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 by $\\text{2-DG-6P}$, which is not a recognized regulatory interaction; PFK-1 is primarily regulated by ATP, AMP, citrate, and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.\n- Option D emphasizes ATP depletion due to continuous phosphorylation of 2-DG. Although initial phosphorylation of 2-DG consumes ATP, the ensuing product inhibition of hexokinase by $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ limits further ATP consumption at this step. Moreover, ATP depletion is a downstream consequence rather than the primary inhibitory mechanism of glycolysis.\n- Option E proposing direct inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ is not supported as the primary mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the primary mechanism is product-like allosteric inhibition of hexokinase by accumulated $\\text{2-DG-6P}$, best captured by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2071030"}, {"introduction": "While controlling the entry to glycolysis is important, the pathway's overall flux is primarily determined at the phosphofructokinase-1 ($PFK-1$) step.
