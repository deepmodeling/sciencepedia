This first practice challenges you to determine the possible and most stable cyclic structures for a simple four-carbon sugar, D-erythrose. By analyzing which hydroxyl groups can feasibly attack the aldehyde carbon, you will learn to predict whether a stable five-membered (furanose) or six-membered (pyranose) ring can be formed based on the length of the carbon backbone. [@problem_id:2038972]", "problem": "D-erythrose is an aldotetrose, a four-carbon monosaccharide containing an aldehyde group. In its open-chain form, its structure consists of an aldehyde at carbon-1 (C1), a primary alcohol at carbon-4 (C4), and secondary alcohol groups at carbons 2 and 3. The 'D' configuration signifies that the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon furthest from the aldehyde (C3) is on the right side in a standard Fischer projection.\n\nMonosaccharides commonly undergo intramolecular cyclization to form stable hemiacetal rings, which are typically five-membered (furanose) or six-membered (pyranose) structures. This reaction occurs when a hydroxyl group from within the sugar molecule attacks the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. Considering the structure of D-erythrose, which of the following statements accurately describes its potential for forming stable cyclic hemiacetals?\n\nA. It can form a stable five-membered ring but not a stable six-membered ring.\n\nB. It can form a stable six-membered ring but not a stable five-membered ring.\n\nC. It can form both a stable five-membered and a stable six-membered ring.\n\nD. It can form neither a stable five-membered nor a stable six-membered ring.\n\nE. It can only form a highly strained four-membered ring, which is not considered stable.", "solution": "D-erythrose is an aldotetrose with carbons labeled $C_1$ through $C_4$: an aldehyde at $C_1$, secondary alcohols at $C_2$ and $C_3$, and a primary alcohol at $C_4$ ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$). Intramolecular hemiacetal formation occurs when an internal hydroxyl oxygen attacks the carbonyl carbon at $C_1$, creating a ring. The ring size is determined by which hydroxyl group attacks.\n\nGeneral principle: if the hydroxyl on carbon $n$ attacks $C_1$, the ring includes the attacking oxygen plus the carbons $C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1$, so the ring size equals $n+1$.\n\nFor D-erythrose, the possible attacking hydroxyls are at $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$:\n- For $n=2$ (attack from $C_2$–OH): ring size $=2+1=3$, a three-membered ring, which is highly strained and not a stable carbohydrate hemiacetal.\n- For $n=3$ (attack from $C_3$–OH): ring size $=3+1=4$, a four-membered ring, also strained and not a stable carbohydrate hemiacetal.\n- For $n=4$ (attack from $C_4$–OH of $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$): ring size $=4+1=5$, a five-membered (furanose) ring, which is a common and stable cyclic form.\n\nA six-membered (pyranose) ring would require $n=5$, which is not possible for a tetrose, since there is no $C_5$. Therefore, D-erythrose can form a stable five-membered ring but not a stable six-membered ring.\n\nHence, the correct statement is that it can form a stable five-membered ring but not a stable six-membered ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2038972"}, {"introduction": "Now that you can predict the feasibility of ring formation, the next step is to correctly depict the three-dimensional structure of the resulting ring. This exercise focuses on translating the 2D linear representation (Fischer projection) of D-mannose into its cyclic form (Haworth projection). Using the given stereochemical rules and the epimeric relationship between D-mannose and D-glucose, you will practice determining the precise orientation of hydroxyl groups around the pyranose ring, a critical skill for understanding carbohydrate recognition and function. [@problem_id:2038981]", "problem": "The cyclization of monosaccharides is a fundamental concept in biochemistry, where a linear sugar molecule forms a stable cyclic hemiacetal or hemiketal. This problem concerns the structure of D-mannose, a nutritionally important sugar.\n\nYou are provided with the following information and conventions:\n1.  D-glucose is an aldohexose. In its open-chain Fischer projection, the hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the chiral carbons are oriented as follows: right side for C-2, left side for C-3, right side for C-4, and right side for C-5. The carbon atoms are numbered starting from the aldehyde group as C-1.\n2.  D-mannose is a C-2 epimer of D-glucose, meaning it differs from D-glucose only in the stereochemical configuration at the C-2 carbon.\n3.  Aldohexoses like glucose and mannose cyclize to form six-membered rings called pyranoses. This occurs when the hydroxyl group at C-5 attacks the aldehyde carbon (C-1).\n4.  When drawing the cyclic Haworth projection from a Fischer projection for a D-sugar:\n    - Any group on the right side of the carbon chain in the Fischer projection is drawn pointing down.\n    - Any group on the left side of the carbon chain in the Fischer projection is drawn pointing up.\n    - The terminal -CH₂OH group (C-6) is always drawn pointing up.\n5.  The new chiral center formed at C-1 is called the anomeric carbon. For the α-anomer, the new hydroxyl group at C-1 is on the opposite side of the ring from the C-6 group.\n\nBased on this information, determine the orientation of the hydroxyl group at the C-2 position in the Haworth projection of α-D-mannopyranose.\n\nA. Pointing up\n\nB. Pointing down\n\nC. It is part of the ether linkage forming the ring.\n\nD. Its orientation depends on whether the ring is in the boat or chair conformation.", "solution": "We begin from the given Fischer projection of D-glucose: at $C_2$ right, $C_3$ left, $C_4$ right, $C_5$ right. D-mannose is defined as the $C_2$ epimer of D-glucose, so only the configuration at $C_2$ is inverted relative to D-glucose, while $C_3$, $C_4$, and $C_5$ remain the same. Therefore, in the Fischer projection of D-mannose, the hydroxyl group at $C_2$ is on the left, and the hydroxyl groups at $C_3$ and $C_4$ are on the left and right, respectively; $C_5$ has the hydroxyl on the right, maintaining the D configuration.\n\nTo form the pyranose (six-membered) ring, the hydroxyl at $C_5$ attacks the aldehyde carbon at $C_1$, forming a cyclic hemiacetal. In converting a Fischer projection of a D-aldose to its Haworth projection:\n- Substituents on the right in the Fischer projection are drawn down in the Haworth projection.\n- Substituents on the left in the Fischer projection are drawn up in the Haworth projection.\n- The terminal $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ (at $C_6$) is drawn up for a D-sugar.\n- The anomeric hydroxyl at $C_1$ is down for the alpha anomer (opposite side to the $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$).\n\nApplying these rules to D-mannose: since at $C_2$ the hydroxyl group is on the left in the Fischer projection, it must be drawn pointing up in the Haworth projection. The alpha designation only fixes the orientation at $C_1$ (anomeric hydroxyl down) and does not change the orientation at $C_2$. Hence, in alpha-D-mannopyranose, the hydroxyl at $C_2$ points up.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2038981"}, {"introduction": "A true test of scientific understanding is the ability to predict outcomes in novel scenarios. This final practice presents a thought experiment involving a chemically modified D-glucose molecule where the standard cyclization pathway to a pyranose ring is blocked. You must apply your knowledge of intramolecular hemiacetal formation and the relative stability of different ring sizes to deduce the most likely alternative structure. This problem encourages you to move beyond memorization and engage in the kind of chemical reasoning used to probe and understand biochemical pathways. [@problem_id:2038984]", "problem": "In aqueous solution, monosaccharides such as D-glucose exist predominantly as cyclic hemiacetals rather than their open-chain aldehyde or ketone forms. For an aldohexose like D-glucose, this cyclization typically involves a nucleophilic attack from the hydroxyl group on carbon-5 onto the electrophilic aldehyde carbon (carbon-1), resulting in a stable six-membered ring structure known as a pyranose.\n\nConsider a synthetic analog of D-glucose in which the hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon-5 has been chemically replaced with a hydrogen atom (-H). All other functional groups on the sugar backbone remain unchanged. Based on the principles of hemiacetal formation and ring stability, what is the most likely structural fate of this modified sugar when dissolved in a neutral aqueous solution?\n\nA. The modified sugar will be unable to cyclize and will remain exclusively in its open-chain form.\n\nB. The modified sugar will form a stable six-membered pyranose ring involving the hydroxyl on carbon-4, which shifts to the carbon-5 position.\n\nC. The modified sugar will form a stable five-membered ring, known as a furanose.\n\nD. The modified sugar will form a stable seven-membered ring using the hydroxyl group on carbon-6.\n\nE. The modified sugar will still form a six-membered pyranose ring because the oxygen from the C-6 hydroxyl group will be incorporated into the ring.", "solution": "Intramolecular hemiacetal formation in aldohexoses proceeds by nucleophilic attack of an internal hydroxyl oxygen on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon at $C_1$. The ring size formed depends on which hydroxyl group attacks: the $C_5$ hydroxyl yields a six-membered pyranose, the $C_4$ hydroxyl yields a five-membered furanose, and the $C_6$ hydroxyl would yield a seven-membered ring. Five- and six-membered rings are generally the most stable due to favorable bond angles and conformations, whereas seven-membered rings are significantly less favored.\n\nIn the modified sugar, the $C_5$ hydroxyl is replaced by hydrogen, so the canonical pathway to a pyranose (six-membered) ring is blocked because there is no $C_5$ nucleophile to attack $C_1$. We must then consider alternative intramolecular nucleophiles:\n\n1) Attack by the $C_4$ hydroxyl on $C_1$ produces a cyclic hemiacetal whose ring atoms follow the path $O_4-C_4-C_3-C_2-C_1$, which contains 5 atoms and therefore forms a five-membered furanose. Such a furanose ring is known to be reasonably stable in aqueous solution.\n\n2) Attack by the $C_6$ hydroxyl on $C_1$ produces a ring with atoms $O_6-C_6-C_5-C_4-C_3-C_2-C_1$, which contains 7 atoms and therefore forms a seven-membered ring. This is much less favorable than a five-membered ring and is not expected to be the predominant structure under neutral aqueous conditions.\n\nNo mechanism exists under neutral aqueous conditions to “shift” the $C_4$ hydroxyl to the $C_5$ position, so a new six-membered pyranose via $C_4$ is not feasible. Likewise, incorporating the $C_6$ oxygen into a six-membered ring with $C_1$ is impossible by simple intramolecular attack because the atom count necessarily yields a seven-membered ring, not six.\n\nTherefore, with the $C_5$ hydroxyl absent, the most likely structural fate is intramolecular cyclization via the $C_4$ hydroxyl to form a stable five-membered furanose, rather than remaining exclusively open-chain or forming a seven-membered ring. This directly supports option C and eliminates A, B, D, and E for the reasons above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2038984"}]}
