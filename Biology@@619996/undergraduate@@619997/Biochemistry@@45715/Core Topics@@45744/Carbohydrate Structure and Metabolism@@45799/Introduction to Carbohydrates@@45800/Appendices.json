This practice is a classic structural elucidation puzzle where you must synthesize different lines of evidence to solve for the identity of an unknown sugar. By applying your knowledge of epimers, oxidation reactions, and the principles of molecular symmetry within Fischer projections, you will develop the logical deduction skills essential for biochemical problem-solving [@problem_id:2052889].", "problem": "A biochemist is working to identify an unknown D-aldohexose. Through a series of experiments, two key pieces of information are established:\n\n1.  The unknown sugar is a C-4 epimer of D-glucose.\n2.  When the unknown sugar is treated with a strong oxidizing agent, such as nitric acid, it yields an optically inactive aldaric acid.\n\nTo ensure the problem is self-contained, recall the following standard definitions and reference information:\n*   The structure of D-glucose, when written as a standard Fischer projection with the aldehyde group at the top (C-1), has the following stereochemistry: the hydroxyl groups are on the right side for carbons C-2, C-4, and C-5, and on the left side for carbon C-3.\n*   Epimers are monosaccharides that differ in their stereochemical configuration at only one chiral carbon atom.\n*   Oxidation with nitric acid converts both the aldehyde group (C-1) and the terminal primary alcohol group (C-6) of an aldose into carboxylic acid groups, forming a dicarboxylic acid known as an aldaric acid.\n*   An optically inactive compound does not rotate the plane of polarized light. In this context, this implies the aldaric acid produced is a meso compound.\n\nBased on this information, what is the identity of the unknown D-aldohexose?\n\nA. D-Glucose\n\nB. D-Allose\n\nC. D-Gulose\n\nD. D-Mannose\n\nE. D-Galactose", "solution": "We begin from the given reference for the Fischer projection of D-glucose with the aldehyde at C-1: hydroxyls on the right at C-2, C-4, C-5 and on the left at C-3. Symbolically, we denote the side of the hydroxyl at carbons C-2 through C-5 as the ordered list $\\{\\text{R},\\text{L},\\text{R},\\text{R}\\}$ for D-glucose.\n\nBy definition, a C-4 epimer of D-glucose differs only at C-4. Therefore, to obtain the C-4 epimer, we invert the configuration at C-4 and leave C-2, C-3, and C-5 unchanged. This gives the pattern\n$$\n\\{\\text{R},\\text{L},\\text{L},\\text{R}\\},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to D-galactose. Hence the unknown sugar must be D-galactose to satisfy condition 1.\n\nNext, we use the nitric acid oxidation criterion. Oxidation with nitric acid converts the aldehyde at C-1 and the primary alcohol at C-6 into carboxylic acids, leaving the configurations at C-2 through C-5 unchanged. The resulting aldaric acid will be optically inactive if and only if it is meso, which in this Fischer context means the substituent pattern at C-2 through C-5 is symmetric about the center of the chain (i.e., invariant under reflection that interchanges C-2 with C-5 and C-3 with C-4). For D-galactose, the pattern $\\{\\text{R},\\text{L},\\text{L},\\text{R}\\}$ is palindromic and therefore symmetric in exactly this way. Consequently, its aldaric acid (mucic acid) is meso and optically inactive.\n\nThus, both conditions are simultaneously satisfied only by D-galactose among the listed options. Therefore, the correct identity is option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2052889"}, {"introduction": "While identifying the static structure of a carbohydrate is a crucial first step, understanding its behavior in chemical reactions reveals a deeper layer of its chemistry. The outcome of a reaction is profoundly influenced by the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms at the reaction site. This exercise [@problem_id:2052907] explores why the reduction of a single ketose yields two distinct stereoisomeric products, a phenomenon rooted in the planar geometry of the carbonyl group and the two possible faces for nucleophilic attack.", "problem": "In a biochemical laboratory, a pure sample of D-fructose, a common ketose sugar, is treated with an excess of the reducing agent sodium borohydride ($NaBH_4$) in an aqueous solution. The reaction is allowed to proceed to completion. Analysis of the reaction mixture reveals the formation of two distinct alditol products: D-glucitol (also known as D-sorbitol) and D-mannitol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical explanation for the observation that a single starting ketose yields two different alditol products upon reduction?\n\nA. The reaction involves an equilibrium between D-fructose and its corresponding aldose isomers, D-glucose and D-mannose, via an enediol intermediate. The subsequent reduction of this mixture of sugars yields the two alditol products.\n\nB. The sodium borohydride reducer is an achiral molecule, but it becomes chiral upon coordination with the aqueous solvent, leading to two different stereoselective reduction pathways.\n\nC. The reduction occurs on the open-chain form of D-fructose. The carbonyl group at the C-2 position is planar, and the hydride ion from the reducing agent can attack from either face of the plane, creating a new chiral center and resulting in two C-2 epimers.\n\nD. D-fructose exists as a mixture of $\\alpha$-D-fructofuranose and $\\beta$-D-fructofuranose anomers in solution. The reduction of the $\\alpha$-anomer yields D-glucitol, while the reduction of the $\\beta$-anomer yields D-mannitol.\n\nE. The reducing agent is strong enough not only to reduce the C-2 ketone but also to induce epimerization at the adjacent C-3 chiral center, leading to two products that differ in configuration at C-3.", "solution": "The problem asks for the reason why the reduction of a single ketose, D-fructose, yields two different products, D-glucitol and D-mannitol. This is a question about the stereochemistry of a chemical reaction.\n\nStep 1: Identify the reacting species and the type of reaction.\nThe starting material is D-fructose, which is a ketohexose. The carbonyl group (a ketone) is located at the C-2 position. The reagent is sodium borohydride ($NaBH_4$), which is a source of hydride ions ($H^-$) and is a standard agent for reducing aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. The reaction is a reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structure of the reaction site.\nIn solution, sugars like fructose exist in equilibrium between their cyclic (hemiacetal/hemiketal) forms and their open-chain form. The reduction reaction with $NaBH_4$ occurs on the carbonyl group of the open-chain form. In the open-chain structure of D-fructose, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group at C-2 is $sp^2$ hybridized. This means the geometry around C-2 is trigonal planar. The C-1, C-3, and oxygen atoms attached to C-2 all lie in the same plane.\n\nStep 3: Consider the mechanism of the reduction.\nSodium borohydride acts as a nucleophile by delivering a hydride ion ($H^-$). This hydride ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon (C-2). Because the carbonyl group is planar, the nucleophilic hydride ion has two possible faces from which to attack: the 'top' face or the 'bottom' face relative to the plane of the carbonyl group.\n\nStep 4: Determine the stereochemical outcome of the attack.\nBefore the reaction, the C-2 carbon is not a chiral center (it's only bonded to three groups). After the reduction, the ketone is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the C-2 carbon becomes bonded to four different groups: the -H atom from the hydride, the newly formed -OH group, the -CH$_2$OH group (C-1), and the rest of the carbon chain (C-3 to C-6). Thus, the C-2 carbon becomes a new chiral center.\n\nStep 5: Relate the two attack pathways to the two products.\n- If the hydride attacks from one face, the resulting hydroxyl group at C-2 will have a specific spatial orientation. This product is D-glucitol.\n- If the hydride attacks from the other face, the resulting hydroxyl group at C-2 will have the opposite spatial orientation. This product is D-mannitol.\n\nThe existing chiral centers in D-fructose (at C-3, C-4, and C-5) remain unchanged during the reaction. The two products, D-glucitol and D-mannitol, have the same configuration at C-3, C-4, and C-5 but opposite configurations at the newly formed chiral center, C-2. Molecules that are diastereomers differing at only one chiral center are called epimers. Therefore, D-glucitol and D-mannitol are C-2 epimers.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- Option A is incorrect. While D-fructose can interconvert with D-glucose and D-mannose under certain (typically basic) conditions via an enediol intermediate, the reduction with $NaBH_4$ is generally faster and occurs directly on the fructose molecule's carbonyl group. This is not the primary reason for the two products.\n- Option B is incorrect. $NaBH_4$ is achiral, and common solvents like water or ethanol are also achiral. They do not combine to form a chiral reducing species.\n- Option C is correct. It accurately describes that the planar nature of the $sp^2$ hybridized carbonyl carbon at C-2 allows for a nucleophilic attack from two different faces, leading to the formation of a new chiral center with two possible configurations. This results in two products that are epimers at C-2.\n- Option D is incorrect. The reduction occurs on the open-chain form in equilibrium with the cyclic anomers. The stereochemistry of the starting anomer ($\\alpha$ or $\\beta$) does not dictate the stereochemistry of the final alditol product at C-2. The planarity of the open-chain carbonyl is the determining factor.\n- Option E is incorrect. Sodium borohydride is a reducing agent, not an epimerizing agent. It does not have the chemical capacity to break and reform C-C or C-O bonds at existing chiral centers like C-3. The configurations at C-3, C-4, and C-5 are preserved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2052907"}, {"introduction": "Although we often represent sugars with simplified 2D diagrams, their true biological activity is dictated by their complex three-dimensional conformations in solution.

The sugar is dissolved in D₂O and its structure is analyzed using one-dimensional proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^1$H NMR) spectroscopy to determine its anomeric configuration.

The vicinal coupling between H-1 and H-2 is measured as $J_{1,2} = 3.1$ Hz. The C-2 hydroxyl group is equatorial in this stable chair conformation.\n\nStep 1: Translate the Karplus relationship to stereochemical constraints. For pyranose chairs:\n- A gauche arrangement between vicinal protons ($\\phi \\approx 60^{\\circ}$) gives a small coupling, typically $J \\approx 2$ to $4$ Hz.\n- An anti arrangement ($\\phi \\approx 180^{\\circ}$) gives a large coupling, typically $J \\approx 8$ to $10$ Hz.\n\nSince $J_{1,2} = 3.1$ Hz is small, H-1 and H-2 must be gauche rather than anti; therefore their dihedral angle is near $60^{\\circ}$, not $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the orientation of H-2 from the given substituent orientation at C-2. If the C-2 hydroxyl is equatorial in the chair, then H-2 is axial (on a tetrahedral center, axial and equatorial positions are complementary).\n\nStep 3: Map dihedral geometry in a chair. Across adjacent ring carbons:\n- Axial–axial protons are trans-diaxial and typically anti ($\\phi \\approx 180^{\\circ}$), giving a large $J$.\n- Axial–equatorial or equatorial–axial protons are typically gauche ($\\phi \\approx 60^{\\circ}$), giving a small $J$.\n\nSince H-2 is axial and the observed $J_{1,2}$ is small, H-1 must be equatorial (axial–equatorial relationship), consistent with a gauche dihedral.\n\nStep 4: Relate H-1 orientation to the anomeric configuration in a D-aldopyranose chair (the standard $^{4}C_{1}$ chair for D-sugars). At C-1:\n- In the $\\alpha$-anomer (for D-sugars), the anomeric hydroxyl is axial, so H-1 is equatorial.\n- In the $\\beta$-anomer (for D-sugars), the anomeric hydroxyl is equatorial, so H-1 is axial.\n\nFrom Step 3, H-1 is equatorial; therefore the anomeric hydroxyl is axial, which corresponds to the $\\alpha$-anomer.\n\nStep 5: Exclude alternatives. If it were the $\\beta$-anomer, H-1 would be axial and with H-2 axial would yield an anti, trans-diaxial arrangement and a large $J$ (not the observed $3.1$ Hz). The dominance of a single chair conformation and a single small $J$ value argues against an equimolar mixture.\n\nConclusion: The anomer is the $\\alpha$-anomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2052886"}]}
