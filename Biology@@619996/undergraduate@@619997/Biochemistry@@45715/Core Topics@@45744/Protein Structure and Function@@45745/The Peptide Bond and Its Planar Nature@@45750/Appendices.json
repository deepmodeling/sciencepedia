This planarity arises from the partial double-bond character of the peptide bond (the C-N bond connecting adjacent amino acid residues). The atoms involved in this planar unit are the alpha-carbon of the first residue (Cα_i), the carbonyl carbon and oxygen (C'_i, O_i), the amide nitrogen and hydrogen of the second residue (N_{i+1}, H_{i+1}), and the alpha-carbon of the second residue (Cα_{i+1}). The overall three-dimensional conformation of the polypeptide is determined by rotation about two specific types of bonds in the backbone for each residue: the bond between the amide nitrogen and the alpha-carbon (N-Cα), defined by the dihedral angle φ (phi), and the bond between the alpha-carbon and the carbonyl carbon (Cα-C'), defined by the dihedral angle ψ (psi).\n\nFor a linear polypeptide chain consisting of 13 amino acid residues, determine the total number of these key rotation-permitting backbone bonds (i.e., the total number of bonds about which the angles φ and ψ are defined).

This final thought experiment challenges you to explore *why* this particular chemistry is so critical. By considering a hypothetical polymer linked by ester bonds instead of amide bonds, you can deduce how this fundamental chemical change would impact the formation of stable secondary structures like $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, thereby reinforcing the deep connection between molecular properties and biological function [@problem_id:2084474].", "problem": "In typical proteins, amino acids are linked by peptide bonds, which are amide linkages formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next. A key feature of the peptide bond is its planarity, which arises from resonance that imparts partial double-bond character to the C-N bond, restricting rotation around it.\n\nConsider a hypothetical biological system that constructs polymers from amino acids using an alternative chemistry. Instead of forming an amide linkage, it forms an ester linkage by reacting the carboxyl group of one amino acid with the hydroxyl group of a modified amino acid (where the alpha-amino group, -NH2, has been replaced by a hydroxyl group, -OH).

The polyester chain would be completely linear and rigid, preventing any folding into compact structures.\n\nB. The formation of stable alpha-helices and beta-sheets would be severely hindered due to the disruption of the regular, repeating backbone geometry required for optimal hydrogen bonding.\n\nC.

In proteins, the peptide bond features resonance between the amide nitrogen lone pair and the carbonyl group, giving the C–N bond partial double-bond character. Consequences:\n- Restricted rotation about the C–N bond, enforcing planarity of the peptide unit.\n- A regular, repeating backbone geometry that constrains the dihedral angles to specific ranges compatible with stable motifs (e.g., Ramachandran-favored regions for $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets).\n\n2) Principle: Backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. In $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, stability arises from regular arrays of hydrogen bonds between backbone carbonyl oxygens (acceptors) and backbone amide N–H groups (donors). Typical patterns include $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen bonds in $\\alpha$-helices and interstrand hydrogen bonds in $\\beta$-sheets.\n\n3) Modification in the hypothetical polymer: Replacement of the $\\alpha$-amino group with a hydroxyl group and formation of an ester linkage produces a backbone repeating unit $-\\mathrm{C}(\\alpha)-\\mathrm{CO}-\\mathrm{O}-$. Consequences:\n- Loss of the backbone amide N–H donor: the ester linkage has a carbonyl oxygen (acceptor) but no amide N–H, removing the principal backbone hydrogen-bond donor necessary for the canonical helix and sheet patterns.\n- Altered resonance and rotational barriers: although esters do have resonance between the carbonyl and the alkoxy oxygen, the partial double-bond character associated with the C–O single bond is weaker than the amide C–N partial double bond. This yields a lower rotational barrier about the C–O bond and less enforced planarity compared to amides, increasing backbone flexibility and disrupting the uniformity of dihedral angles required for regular secondary structure.\n\n4) Net effect on secondary structure formation:\n- The absence of regular backbone donors and the increased flexibility together disrupt the repeating hydrogen-bonding patterns and the consistent backbone geometry that stabilize $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets.\n- Therefore, the formation of stable, native-like $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets would be severely hindered.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: ester linkages would not make the chain completely rigid; they are generally more flexible than amide linkages.\n- B is correct: the disruption of backbone hydrogen bonding and regular geometry hinders stable $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets.\n- C is incorrect: increased flexibility generally destabilizes regular secondary structure; there is no basis for hyper-stability.\n- D is incorrect: the hydrophobic effect arises from side chains in water and would still operate.\n- E is incorrect: disulfide bonds can stabilize tertiary structure but do not generally replace the role of secondary-structure hydrogen-bond networks.\n\nThus, the most likely and significant consequence is severe hindrance of stable $\\alpha$-helix and $\\beta$-sheet formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2084474"}]}
