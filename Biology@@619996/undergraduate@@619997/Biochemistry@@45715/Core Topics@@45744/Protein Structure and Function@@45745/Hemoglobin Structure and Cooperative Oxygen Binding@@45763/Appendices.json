Laboratory analysis reveals that HbN has a $P_{50}$ value of 19.0 torr.

By considering a targeted mutation, this problem allows us to connect the dots between a single amino acid, the stability of the T-state, and hemoglobin's overall function. This exercise will deepen your understanding of how protein structure dictates physiological behavior, specifically linking a key salt bridge to both oxygen affinity and the Bohr effect [@problem_id:2049629].", "problem": "Hemoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport in the blood, exhibits cooperative binding of oxygen. Its function is modulated by allosteric effectors, leading to a transition between a low-affinity Tense (T) state and a high-affinity Relaxed (R) state. In the T-state, a network of ionic interactions stabilizes the deoxyhemoglobin conformation. One of these critical interactions is a salt bridge between the imidazole side chain of Histidine-146 on the $\\beta$-chain ($\\beta$His146) and the carboxylate side chain of Aspartate-94 on the same $\\beta$-chain ($\\beta$Asp94). This interaction only forms when the $\\beta$His146 is protonated.\n\nThe oxygen-binding affinity of hemoglobin is also sensitive to pH, a phenomenon known as the Bohr effect. Specifically, a decrease in pH (increase in proton concentration) lowers hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. A significant fraction of this effect is due to the pH-dependent protonation of $\\beta$His146.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that results in the substitution of Histidine-146 on both $\\beta$-chains with Leucine ($\\beta$His146 $\\rightarrow$ $\\beta$Leu146). Based on the principles of protein structure and function, predict the most likely consequences of this mutation on both the intrinsic oxygen affinity (as measured by $P_{50}$, the partial pressure of $O_2$ at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated) and the magnitude of the alkaline Bohr effect.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is most plausible?\n\nA. The $P_{50}$ will decrease, and the magnitude of the Bohr effect will be reduced.\n\nB. The $P_{50}$ will increase, and the magnitude of the Bohr effect will be reduced.\n\nC.

The $P_{50}$ will be unchanged, and the magnitude of the Bohr effect will be unchanged.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effects of a $\\beta$His146 $\\rightarrow$ $\\beta$Leu146 mutation on hemoglobin's oxygen affinity ($P_{50}$) and the Bohr effect. We must analyze the structural and chemical consequences of this amino acid substitution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structural role of $\\beta$His146 and the effect of the mutation.**\nThe problem states that in the T-state (low oxygen affinity), a salt bridge forms between a protonated $\\beta$His146 and a negatively charged $\\beta$Asp94. This salt bridge is an ionic interaction that stabilizes the T-state conformation.\nThe mutation replaces Histidine (a basic amino acid with a titratable imidazole side chain) with Leucine (an aliphatic, nonpolar, and non-titratable amino acid). Leucine cannot form an ionic bond. Therefore, the mutation to Leucine permanently ablates the salt bridge between residue 146 and residue 94 of the $\\beta$-chain.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the impact on the T-R equilibrium and $P_{50}$.**\nThe T-state and R-state exist in equilibrium: Hb(T) $\\leftrightarrow$ Hb(R). The salt bridge stabilizes the T-state. By removing this key stabilizing interaction, the mutation selectively destabilizes the T-state relative to the R-state. According to Le Châtelier's principle, if the stability of the T-state is reduced, the equilibrium will shift away from the T-state and towards the R-state.\nThe R-state is the high-affinity conformation for oxygen. A shift in the equilibrium towards the R-state means that the hemoglobin population, on average, will have a higher affinity for oxygen. A higher oxygen affinity means that less oxygen (a lower partial pressure) is required to achieve 50% saturation. The parameter for 50% saturation is $P_{50}$. Therefore, a higher affinity corresponds to a lower $P_{50}$. We predict that the $P_{50}$ will decrease.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the role of $\\beta$His146 in the Bohr effect.**\nThe Bohr effect describes the observation that hemoglobin's oxygen affinity decreases as pH drops (i.e., [H$^+$] increases). The problem states that the protonation of $\\beta$His146 is a major contributor to this effect. Let's detail the mechanism:\n- In tissues with high metabolic activity, CO$_2$ is high, leading to a lower pH.\n- At this lower pH, the imidazole side chain of $\\beta$His146 (pKa $\\approx$ 6.8-7.0 in this environment) is more likely to be protonated.\n- The protonated (positively charged) $\\beta$His146 can then form the salt bridge with the negatively charged $\\beta$Asp94.\n- This salt bridge stabilizes the T-state, which has a low affinity for oxygen, thus promoting the release of $O_2$ into the tissues.\nThe overall equilibrium can be written as: Hb-O$_2$ + H$^+$ $\\leftrightarrow$ Hb-H$^+$ + O$_2$. Lowering pH shifts this to the right, favoring $O_2$ release. The ability of $\\beta$His146 to accept a proton is a key part of this mechanism.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the impact of the mutation on the Bohr effect.**\nThe mutation replaces the titratable Histidine with a non-titratable Leucine. The side chain of Leucine cannot accept a proton in the physiological pH range. Consequently, this specific site can no longer contribute to the pH-dependent stabilization of the T-state.\nSince a major molecular component responsible for sensing pH changes has been removed, the oxygen affinity of the mutant hemoglobin will become substantially less sensitive to changes in pH. The magnitude of the Bohr effect is a measure of this pH sensitivity. Therefore, the mutation will cause the magnitude of the Bohr effect to be significantly reduced.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the predictions and select the correct option.**\nOur analysis concludes that the $\\beta$His146 $\\rightarrow$ $\\beta$Leu146 mutation will:\n1.  Cause the $P_{50}$ to decrease (due to destabilization of the T-state).\n2.  Cause the magnitude of the Bohr effect to be reduced (due to removal of a key titratable group).\n\nThis combination of outcomes matches option A.\n- B is incorrect because $P_{50}$ would decrease, not increase.\n- C is incorrect because the Bohr effect would be reduced, not enhanced.\n- D is incorrect for both predictions.\n- E is incorrect because the mutation has significant structural and chemical consequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2049629"}]}
