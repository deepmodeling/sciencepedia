The stability of an enzyme is often characterized by its melting temperature ($T_m$), which is defined as the temperature at which exactly half of the enzyme molecules are in their denatured (unfolded) state and the other half are in their native (folded) state. To determine this value, the team used a spectroscopic technique to measure the fraction of unfolded enzyme molecules at various temperatures.\n\nThe experimental data collected are as follows:\n- At a temperature of 60.0 °C, the fraction of unfolded enzyme is 0.38.\n- At a temperature of 62.0 °C, the fraction of unfolded enzyme is 0.54.\n- At a temperature of 64.0 °C, the fraction of unfolded enzyme is 0.70.\n\nAssuming that the fraction of unfolded enzyme changes linearly with temperature in the small range between the measured data points, calculate the melting temperature ($T_m$) of this enzyme.\n\nExpress your final answer in degrees Celsius, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The melting temperature is defined by the condition that the fraction unfolded equals one half, so we seek the temperature $T$ where the measured fraction $f(T)$ satisfies $f(T)=0.5$.\n\nAssuming linearity between the data points, model the fraction as a linear function of temperature near the relevant interval:\n$$\nf(T)=f(T_{0})+m\\,(T-T_{0}),\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope.

This practice presents a thought experiment that takes you into the protein's nonpolar core, a region crucial for stability. By predicting the effect of a specific mutation on the melting temperature, you will apply core principles of the hydrophobic effect and electrostatics to understand why burying a charged residue is so unfavorable.

This stability is quantified by its melting temperature ($T_m$), defined as the temperature at which 50% of the protein population transitions from the native folded state to the denatured state. A research team performs a site-directed mutagenesis experiment, creating a variant of this protein. In this variant, a single leucine residue, known to be buried deep within the protein's nonpolar hydrophobic core, is replaced by an aspartate residue. The pKa of an aspartate side-chain carboxyl group is approximately 3.9.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the consequence of this Leu-to-Asp mutation on the protein's melting temperature and provides the principal biochemical reason for the change?\n\nA. The $T_m$ will significantly increase, as the aspartate side chain will form a highly stable, charge-stabilized salt bridge with a neighboring residue in the hydrophobic core.\n\nB. The $T_m$ will significantly decrease, because accommodating a charged group within the low-dielectric, nonpolar environment of the core is thermodynamically very unfavorable.\n\nC. The $T_m$ will remain relatively unchanged, as the energetic penalty for losing the hydrophobic interactions of one leucine residue is roughly compensated by the new polar interactions formed by the aspartate residue.\n\nD. The $T_m$ will significantly decrease, because the aspartate side chain is substantially bulkier than the leucine side chain, causing prohibitive steric clashes that disrupt the packing of the core.\n\nE.

Introducing a charged group into the protein core, which has a low dielectric constant $\\epsilon_{\\text{core}}$, imposes a large desolvation penalty because the electrostatic self-energy of a charge is much higher in a low-dielectric medium.

Therefore, burial of a charged aspartate is thermodynamically very unfavorable, substantially destabilizing the folded state relative to the unfolded, solvent-exposed state. Even if the microenvironment perturbs the $pK_{a}$ upward to reduce ionization, the presence of a polar group in a nonpolar core incurs penalties from unsatisfied hydrogen-bonding capacity and loss of favorable hydrophobic packing, so the net effect remains strongly destabilizing.\n\nCompeting hypotheses in the options are less consistent with these principles:\n- Formation of a buried salt bridge (option A) would require a properly positioned complementary charge; such preorganization is not given and, absent this, the dominant effect is the large desolvation penalty.\n- Near compensation between lost hydrophobic interactions and new polar interactions (option C) is not expected because unsatisfied polar or charged groups in a nonpolar core are strongly destabilizing relative to the modest stabilization from a single side-chain hydrogen bond.\n- Steric clashes due to increased bulk (option D) are incorrect in premise; leucine is bulkier than aspartate, and sterics are not the dominant factor here.\n- Aspartate being neutral at pH 7.4 (option E) is false; the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation indicates it is predominantly deprotonated in aqueous environments, and in any case polar burial is unfavorable without specific compensations.\n\nThus, the mutation results in $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\textolog{fold}}>0$, which decreases $T_{m}$, and the principal reason is the thermodynamic penalty of accommodating a charged group in a low-dielectric, nonpolar core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2065857"}, {"introduction": "Christian Anfinsen’s Nobel Prize-winning experiments demonstrated that the primary amino acid sequence of a protein contains the necessary information to specify its final three-dimensional structure. This exercise revisits his foundational work on ribonuclease A with a critical twist in the experimental protocol. By analyzing the consequences of altering the refolding pathway, you will uncover a profound principle: for a protein to regain its function, the journey back to the native state is just as important as the destination. [@problem_id:2065852]", "problem": "In a biochemistry laboratory, a student is investigating the principles of protein folding using bovine pancreatic Ribonuclease A (RNase A). RNase A is a small enzyme consisting of 124 amino acids, and its stable, catalytically active tertiary structure is locked in place by four specific disulfide bonds. The student first prepares a solution of active RNase A and then adds a high concentration of urea and a reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol. Urea is a chaotropic agent that disrupts the non-covalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions) that maintain the protein's folded structure. The β-mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent that breaks the disulfide bonds, converting them into free sulfhydryl (-SH) groups. This treatment results in a completely unfolded and inactive polypeptide chain.\n\nThe student then attempts to renature the protein to regain its enzymatic activity using a two-step dialysis procedure. However, the student deviates from the standard protocol. First, the student removes the β-mercaptoethanol by dialysis, allowing the sulfhydryl groups to re-oxidize in the presence of air, but keeps the urea concentration high. In the second step, the student removes the urea by dialysis, allowing the polypeptide chain to refold.\n\nBased on this specific sequence of steps (removal of reducing agent first, then removal of denaturant), what is the most likely outcome for the enzymatic activity of the RNase A sample?\n\nA. The protein will regain approximately 100% of its original enzymatic activity.\n\nB. The protein will remain completely unfolded and denatured, showing no enzymatic activity.\n\nC. The protein will be folded but enzymatically inactive, or have only about 1% of its original activity.\n\nD. The protein will regain approximately 50% of its original activity as half of the molecules fold correctly.\n\nE. The protein will refold into its native structure but will lack disulfide bonds, resulting in an unstable but active enzyme.", "solution": "1) Known structural constraints and initial state: RNase A has 8 cysteines that form 4 native disulfide bonds in its active, folded state. Denaturation with high urea disrupts noncovalent interactions, and reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol cleaves the 4 disulfide bonds to give 8 free thiols, yielding an unfolded, inactive polypeptide.\n\n2) Principle governing disulfide pairing: In the absence of the folded structural template (i.e., while the chain is unfolded in urea), oxidation of thiols proceeds largely at random, producing non-native disulfide pairings. The number of distinct ways to pair 2n cysteines into n disulfides is\n$$\n(2n-1)!! \\;=\\; \\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n} n!}.\n$$\nFor RNase A, $n=4$, hence the number of possible disulfide connectivities is\n$$\n(2\\cdot 4-1)!! \\;=\\; 7!! \\;=\\; 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1 \\;=\\; 105.\n$$\nOnly one of these corresponds to the native connectivity, so the fraction with correct disulfides under random oxidation is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{105}.\n$$\n\n3) Sequence executed by the student and its kinetic consequences:\n- Step 1 (remove reducing agent while urea remains high): The protein remains unfolded due to urea, but is now under oxidizing conditions (air). The 8 thiols oxidize to form disulfides in the unfolded ensemble, which yields predominantly non-native, “scrambled” disulfide patterns. Because disulfide formation is covalent and constrains the chain, these scrambled bonds kinetically trap the polypeptide in mispaired states.\n- Step 2 (remove urea): With urea removed, the chain attempts to fold, but the pre-formed non-native disulfide pattern restricts conformations and prevents attainment of the native tertiary structure. In the absence of a reducing-shuffling environment (no beta-mercaptoethanol), incorrect disulfide bonds cannot efficiently reshuffle to the native pattern. The system remains trapped in inactive, misfolded states.\n\n4) Activity outcome: Under these conditions, only the minute fraction that, by chance, formed the native disulfide connectivity in urea could become active upon urea removal. The theoretical upper bound from random pairing is $\\frac{1}{105} \\approx 0.0095$, i.e., about 1% of the original activity, while most molecules with scrambled disulfides remain inactive. Therefore, the expected result is that the sample is folded but enzymatically inactive or exhibits only about 1% of the original activity.\n\n5) Elimination of alternatives:\n- A is false because full renaturation requires either removal of urea before oxidation or simultaneous removal with conditions that permit correct disulfide reshuffling; oxidizing in urea scrambles disulfides.\n- B is false because removal of urea allows some degree of folding, but mispaired disulfides prevent native active structure.\n- D is false because random oxidation does not yield a large fraction of correct pairings; the combinatorial argument gives $\\frac{1}{105}$, not 0.5.\n- E is false because in oxidizing conditions disulfides will form; a disulfide-free, stable active RNase A is not expected under these conditions.\n\nConclusion: The most likely outcome is extremely low activity, around 1%, consistent with a folded but inactive ensemble due to scrambled disulfide bonds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2065852"}]}
