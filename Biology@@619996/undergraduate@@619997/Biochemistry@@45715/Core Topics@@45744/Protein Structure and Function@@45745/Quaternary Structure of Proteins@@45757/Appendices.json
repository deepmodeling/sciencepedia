Scientists often combine different experimental techniques to piece together the puzzle of subunit composition.

By synthesizing results from size-exclusion chromatography (which measures the mass of the native, intact protein) and SDS-PAGE (which measures the mass of individual, denatured subunits), you can deduce the protein's complete subunit architecture.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly isolated enzyme. To determine its structure, a series of experiments are conducted. First, size-exclusion chromatography, a technique that preserves the native protein structure, indicates the enzyme has a total molecular weight of approximately 120 kDa.\n\nNext, the protein is analyzed using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This technique involves treating the protein with a detergent (SDS) that disrupts non-covalent interactions and unfolds the polypeptide chains, which are then separated by electrophoresis based almost exclusively on their molecular weight. This first SDS-PAGE experiment reveals a single distinct band corresponding to a molecular weight of 30 kDa.\n\nA second SDS-PAGE experiment is then performed, but this time, in addition to SDS, a strong reducing agent (beta-mercaptoethanol) is added. This agent specifically cleaves covalent disulfide bonds. The result of this second experiment is identical to the first: a single band is observed at 30 kDa.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the enzyme's quaternary structure?\n\nA. The enzyme is a monomer of 120 kDa that is partially cleaved into four 30 kDa fragments by the SDS.\n\nB. The enzyme is a dimer composed of two identical 60 kDa subunits.\n\nC. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of four identical 30 kDa subunits linked by non-covalent interactions.\n\nD. The enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two subunits of 30 kDa and one subunit of 60 kDa.\n\nE. The enzyme is a tetramer where two pairs of 30 kDa subunits are each linked by disulfide bonds, and these two resulting 60 kDa dimers then associate non-covalently.", "solution": "Size-exclusion chromatography preserves the native, non-denatured state of a protein, so the elution corresponds to the native oligomeric molecular mass. From the experiment, the native mass is approximately $120\\ \\text{kDa}$, which we denote as $M_{\\text{native}} \\approx 120\\ \\text{kDa}$.\n\nSDS-PAGE denatures proteins by disrupting non-covalent interactions and coating polypeptide chains with SDS so that they migrate primarily according to their polypeptide chain molecular mass. The first SDS-PAGE gives a single band at $30\\ \\text{kDa}$, which implies that each polypeptide chain has mass $M_{\\text{subunit}} = 30\\ \\text{kDa}$ and that all chains are the same, since only one band is observed.\n\nA follow-up SDS-PAGE with a reducing agent (beta-mercaptoethanol) breaks disulfide bonds. The result is unchanged (still a single band at $30\\ \\text{kDa}$), so there are no interchain disulfide bonds linking subunits in the native state; otherwise, a difference between non-reducing and reducing conditions would have been observed.\n\nTo relate native mass and subunit mass, we use the relation\n$$\nn = \\frac{M_{\\text{native}}}{M_{\\text{subunit}}} = \\frac{120\\ \\text{kDa}}{30\\ \\text{kDa}} = 4,\n$$\nso the enzyme is a tetramer composed of four identical $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits. Because reducing conditions did not alter the SDS-PAGE pattern, the quaternary structure is maintained by non-covalent interactions rather than disulfide bonds.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because SDS does not cleave peptide bonds to generate smaller fragments; it denatures and separates existing polypeptide chains.\n- B is inconsistent with the $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ SDS-PAGE band; a $60\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunit would appear at $60\\ \\text{kDa}$.\n- C matches the data: a $120\\ \\text{kDa}$ native complex, single $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ band under both non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, indicating four identical $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits associated non-covalently.\n- D is internally inconsistent (described as a heterotetramer but listing only three subunits) and would produce multiple bands (at least $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ and $60\\ \\text{kDa}$) on SDS-PAGE.\n- E predicts a $60\\ \\text{kDa}$ band under non-reducing SDS-PAGE due to disulfide-linked dimers, which contradicts the observed $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ band.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is a non-covalently associated tetramer of four identical $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2068507"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how to determine a protein's subunit composition, we now turn to the forces that hold it together. The stability of a quaternary structure relies on a delicate network of non-covalent interactions at subunit interfaces, which can be highly sensitive to environmental factors like pH.

The three identical subunits of Dissociase assemble into a stable complex in a buffer solution at pH 8.0. However, when the pH of the buffer is adjusted to 6.0, the trimer completely dissociates into its individual monomeric subunits. This dissociation is known to be caused by a change in electrostatic forces at the interface between the subunits.\n\nGiven that the dissociation is primarily due to the ionization state of one or more amino acid residues in close proximity at the interface, which of the following pairs of residues is most likely responsible for this pH-dependent behavior?\n\nYou are provided with the typical side chain pKa values for several amino acids:\n- Aspartic Acid (Asp): 3.9\n- Glutamic Acid (Glu): 4.1\n- Histidine (His): 6.0\n- Cysteine (Cys): 8.3\n- Tyrosine (Tyr): 10.5\n- Lysine (Lys): 10.5\n- Arginine (Arg): 12.5\n\nA) Two Lysine residues\n\nB) An Aspartic Acid residue and a Lysine residue\n\nC) Two Histidine residues\n\nD) A Cysteine residue and a Tyrosine residue\n\nE) Two Glutamic Acid residues", "solution": "We use the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationships to connect pH to side-chain protonation and charge, because electrostatic interactions at the interface depend on whether side chains are protonated (charged) or deprotonated (neutral for bases, negative for acids).\n\nFor an acidic side chain written as $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}+A^{-}$, the deprotonated (negatively charged) fraction is\n$$\nf_{A^{-}}=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a}-\\mathrm{pH}}}.\n$$\nThus, when $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, acids are predominantly deprotonated and negatively charged.\n\nFor a basic side chain written as $BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B+H^{+}$, the protonated (positively charged) fraction is\n$$\nf_{BH^{+}}=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\nThus, when $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, bases are predominantly protonated and positively charged; when $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, they are largely deprotonated and neutral.\n\nThe observation is: trimer is stable at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and dissociates at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$. Therefore, lowering pH must introduce new electrostatic repulsion or remove a stabilizing opposite-charge interaction at the interface.\n\nEvaluate each option using $\\mathrm{pH}$ relative to the given $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ values:\n- Two Lysine residues (basic with high $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$): for both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, we have $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, so both Lys are positively charged at both pH values. The like-charge repulsion exists at both pH values and does not newly appear at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, so this does not explain stability at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ but dissociation at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$.\n- Aspartic Acid and Lysine (acidic plus basic): at both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Asp})$ so Asp is negative, and $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Lys})$ so Lys is positive. The salt bridge persists across both pH values; no disruptive change occurs at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$.\n- Two Histidine residues (basic with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ near neutral): at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{His})$, so His is largely deprotonated and neutral, minimizing like-charge repulsion and allowing stable packing. At $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}\\approx \\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{His})$, so a substantial fraction (increasing as $\\mathrm{pH}$ drops below $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$) becomes protonated and positively charged. Two nearby His side chains thus acquire like positive charges, introducing electrostatic repulsion at lower pH that can destabilize the interface and promote dissociation. This matches the observed pH-dependent dissociation upon lowering pH.\n- Cysteine and Tyrosine: $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Cys})$ is above neutral, so at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ there can be some deprotonated thiolate (negative), whereas at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ Cys is predominantly protonated (neutral). Tyrosine remains neutral at both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ because $\\mathrm{pH}\\ll \\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Tyr})$. Lowering pH reduces any negative charge on Cys, which would not create new repulsion; it would more likely reduce repulsion and cannot explain destabilization at lower pH.\n- Two Glutamic Acid residues: for both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Glu})$, so both are negatively charged across both pH values. Any like-charge repulsion is present at both pH values and would not specifically increase upon lowering pH to $6.0$.\n\nOnly the two-histidine scenario introduces a significant and specific charge-state change between $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ that can convert a neutral-neutral contact into a like-charge repulsive contact, thereby explaining the pH-triggered dissociation at lower pH.

Your task is to choose the strategy that most effectively distinguishes between two competing models of dimerization, a core skill in modern structural biology research.", "problem": "A hypothetical homodimeric protein, named \"Kinasine,\" is crucial for a newly discovered metabolic pathway. Kinasine is composed of two domains: a large N-terminal catalytic domain and a small C-terminal regulatory \"arm\" domain. These two domains are connected by a short, flexible peptide linker. Experimental data from Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) confirms that Kinasine exists exclusively as a dimer under physiological conditions. However, the precise mechanism of dimerization is unknown. Two competing models are proposed:\n\n1.  **The Surface-to-Surface Model:** Each Kinasine monomer folds into its complete tertiary structure, and two folded monomers then associate via a complementary surface on their respective large N-terminal domains. In this model, the C-terminal arm interacts with its own N-terminal domain intra-molecularly.\n2.  **The Domain-Swapping Model:** The N-terminal domain of one monomer (Monomer A) interacts with the C-terminal arm domain of the other monomer (Monomer B), and vice-versa. The flexible linker allows the C-terminal arm of each monomer to swing out and bind to its partner.\n\nYou are tasked with designing an experiment using site-directed mutagenesis to determine which model is correct. The plan is to create a mutant Kinasine protein, express it, and analyze its oligomeric state using SEC to see if it remains a dimer or shifts to a monomer.\n\nWhich of the following mutagenesis strategies is the most specific and effective for distinguishing between the Surface-to-Surface and the Domain-Swapping models?\n\nA. Create a mutant where several key hydrophobic residues on the surface of the large N-terminal domain, predicted to be at the dimer interface in the Surface-to-Surface model, are replaced with charged glutamate residues.\n\nB. Create a mutant where three amino acid residues are deleted from the flexible peptide linker that connects the N-terminal and C-terminal domains.\n\nC. Create a mutant where a conserved, buried tryptophan residue in the hydrophobic core of the N-terminal domain is replaced with a small, polar serine residue.\n\nD. Create a mutant where a poly-histidine tag is added to the N-terminus to facilitate protein purification.\n\nE. Create a mutant where a protease cleavage site is inserted into the middle of the alpha-helical bundle that forms the core of the C-terminal arm domain.", "solution": "We need a mutagenesis strategy that perturbs only the structural feature that differentiates the two models while leaving all other aspects of folding and function as intact as possible, so that a change in oligomeric state observed by SEC can be interpreted specifically.\n\nDefine the discriminating structural element:\n- In the Surface-to-Surface model, dimerization depends on a complementary interface on the folded N-terminal domains; the C-terminal arm stays intramolecular. The flexible linker length primarily influences intramolecular positioning of the arm but is not required to span between monomers.\n- In the Domain-Swapping model, dimerization depends on the ability of each C-terminal arm to leave its own N-terminal domain and reach the partner N-terminal domain across monomers. This requires a hinge loop (the flexible linker) of sufficient length and flexibility to allow inter-molecular exchange.\n\nPredicted SEC outcomes if a specific element is perturbed:\n- If the hinge/linker is shortened without disrupting core folding, then:\n  - Domain-Swapping model: inter-molecular reach becomes sterically/geometrically unfavorable, so dimerization should be specifically reduced or lost, yielding a monomer by SEC.\n  - Surface-to-Surface model: the N-terminal surface interface remains intact, so dimerization should be largely preserved, yielding a dimer by SEC.\nThus, linker shortening is a direct, specific test for domain swapping.\n- If the putative N-terminal surface interface is mutated:\n  - Surface-to-Surface model: dimerization should be lost (monomer by SEC).\n  - Domain-Swapping model: outcome is ambiguous because the same N-terminal surface may be the docking site for the partner arm in the swapped dimer; mutating it could also break the swapped dimer. Additionally, introducing multiple charged residues at a hydrophobic surface can destabilize folding nonspecifically, confounding interpretation.\n- If a core residue is mutated (e.g., buried tryptophan to serine), this primarily probes fold stability, not the dimerization mechanism; loss of dimer could reflect misfolding, not interface identity.\n- Adding an N-terminal His-tag is generally orthogonal to dimerization and not discriminating.\n- Inserting a protease site in the arm core perturbs the arm’s structure and requires an additional cleavage step; any observed effects conflate structural disruption with the dimerization mechanism and are not a clean SEC readout of the intact mutant.\n\nTherefore, the most specific and effective discriminant is to shorten the flexible linker by a small deletion that is unlikely to disrupt core folding. If the SEC profile shifts from dimer to monomer, that supports the Domain-Swapping model; if it remains dimeric, that supports the Surface-to-Surface model.
