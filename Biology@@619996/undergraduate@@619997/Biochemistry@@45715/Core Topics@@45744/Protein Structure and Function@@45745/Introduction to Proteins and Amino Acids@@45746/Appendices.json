A protein's isoelectric point ($pI$) is a critical global property that reflects the sum of all its charged groups.

What is the most likely effect of this widespread deamidation on the pI of the protein?\n\nA. The pI will increase significantly.\n\nB. The pI will decrease significantly.\n\nC. The pI will remain essentially unchanged because asparagine and aspartate are structurally similar.\n\nD. The pI change will be negligible as this modification only affects surface residues.\n\nE. The effect on pI is unpredictable as the protein might refold into a new conformation.", "solution": "We are asked about the effect on the isoelectric point, defined as the pH at which the protein carries zero net charge, when many surface-exposed asparagine (Asn) residues are converted to aspartate (Asp) via deamidation.\n\nKey acid-base principle: The side chain of Asn is an amide that is neutral over the relevant pH range; it contributes no pH-dependent charge. The side chain of Asp is a carboxylic acid with a side-chain acid dissociation constant, denoted $pK_{a,\\mathrm{Asp}}$, and thus can be protonated (neutral) or deprotonated (negatively charged) depending on pH.\n\nFor a single carboxyl group with $pK_{a}$, the fraction in the deprotonated, negatively charged state at a given pH is\n$$\n\\theta_{-}(\\mathrm{pH})=\\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a}}}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a}}}.\n$$\nTherefore, an Asp side chain contributes a net charge of $-\\,\\theta_{-}(\\mathrm{pH})$, while an Asn side chain contributes $0$.\n\nLet $Z(\\mathrm{pH})$ denote the net charge of the original protein as a function of pH. Its isoelectric point $pI_{0}$ satisfies\n$$\nZ(pI_{0})=0.\n$$\nSuppose $n$ Asn residues are converted to Asp. If we denote the Asp side-chain $pK_{a}$ values collectively as $pK_{a,\\mathrm{Asp}}$ (assuming similar microenvironments for simplicity), then the new net charge is\n$$\nZ^{\\prime}(\\mathrm{pH})=Z(\\mathrm{pH})-n\\,\\theta_{-}(\\mathrm{pH}),\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\theta_{-}(\\mathrm{pH})=\\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{Asp}}}}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{Asp}}}}.\n$$\nEvaluate this at the original isoelectric point:\n$$\nZ^{\\prime}(pI_{0})=Z(pI_{0})-n\\,\\theta_{-}(pI_{0})=0-n\\,\\theta_{-}(pI_{0})<0,\n$$\nbecause $\\theta_{-}(pI_{0})>0$ for any finite $pI_{0}$. Thus, at the original $pI_{0}$, the modified protein is negatively charged. To restore zero net charge, the pH must be lowered so that the fraction deprotonated $\\theta_{-}(\\mathrm{pH})$ decreases, reducing the negative charge. Hence the new isoelectric point $pI^{\\prime}$ must satisfy\n$$\npI^{\\prime}<pI_{0}.\n$$\nBecause the modification is widespread (large $n$), the shift is significant. Structural similarity between Asn and Asp does not negate the added acidic charge, surface localization does not prevent its contribution to net charge, and while conformational changes can occur, the dominant and predictable effect of introducing many additional carboxyl groups is to lower the pI.\n\nTherefore, the pI will decrease significantly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053681"}, {"introduction": "A protein's function is intrinsically linked to its three-dimensional structure, which is dictated by its amino acid sequence.
