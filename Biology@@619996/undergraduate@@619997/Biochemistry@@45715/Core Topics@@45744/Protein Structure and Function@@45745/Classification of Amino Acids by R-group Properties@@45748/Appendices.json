Mastering the ability to calculate this charge is a fundamental skill, as it allows biochemists to predict and control the behavior of proteins and peptides in various experimental setups. This exercise challenges you to determine the net charge of two tripeptides at a specific pH to predict their movement in gel electrophoresis, a ubiquitous technique for separating biomolecules.

The amino acid sequence of Peptide X is Aspartyl-Histidyl-Methionine (Asp-His-Met), and the sequence of Peptide Y is Arginyl-Prolyl-Leucine (Arg-Pro-Leu).\n\nThe biochemist performs a gel electrophoresis experiment. A mixture of the two peptides is loaded into a single well located at the center of an agarose gel. The gel is saturated with a buffer solution maintained at a constant pH of 8.0. An electric field is then applied across the gel, with the positive electrode (anode) at one end and the negative electrode (cathode) at the other.\n\nTo predict the outcome, you are given the following typical $pK_a$ values for the ionizable groups in peptides:\n- Terminal $\\alpha$-amino group: $pK_a$ = 9.6\n- Terminal $\\alpha$-carboxyl group: $pK_a$ = 2.4\n- Aspartic Acid (Asp) R-group: $pK_a$ = 3.9\n- Histidine (His) R-group: $pK_a$ = 6.0\n- Arginine (Arg) R-group: $pK_a$ = 12.5\n\nThe R-groups of Methionine (Met), Proline (Pro), and Leucine (Leu) are non-ionizable and can be considered to have no charge.\n\nBased on the net electrical charge of each peptide at pH 8.0, which of the following statements most accurately describes their migration behavior in the electric field?\n\nA.

Positively charged molecules (cations) migrate toward the negative electrode (cathode), while negatively charged molecules (anions) migrate toward the positive electrode (anode). Molecules with a net charge of zero do not migrate.\n\nThe charge of each ionizable group is determined by comparing the environmental pH to the group's $pK_a$. The general rule, derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, is:\n- If pH > $pK_a$, the group will be predominantly in its deprotonated (basic) form.\n- If pH < $pK_a$, the group will be predominantly in its protonated (acidic) form.\n\nWe need to calculate the net charge for each tripeptide at pH 8.0 by summing the charges of all its ionizable groups.

The $pI$ is dictated by the unique collection of acidic and basic R-groups within a peptide. This practice explores how a single amino acid substitution dramatically alters a peptide's $pI$, a critical consideration when designing purification methods like ion-exchange chromatography.

The original peptide, designated Peptide-L, has the sequence Gly-Ala-Lys-Val-Phe. For a comparative study, they create a variant, designated Peptide-A, by substituting a single amino acid. The sequence of Peptide-A is Gly-Ala-Asp-Val-Phe. To plan the purification of these two peptides using ion-exchange chromatography, it is essential to predict the difference in their isoelectric points ($pI$). The isoelectric point is the pH at which a molecule carries no net electrical charge.\n\nBased on the fundamental properties of the amino acid side chains, which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the isoelectric points of Peptide-L and Peptide-A?\n\nA. The $pI$ of Peptide-L will be lower than the $pI$ of Peptide-A.\n\nB. The $pI$ of Peptide-A will be lower than the $pI$ of Peptide-L.\n\nC. The $pI$ of Peptide-L and Peptide-A will be identical because the substitutions do not affect the peptide backbone termini.\n\nD.

The relevant principle is that the net charge of a peptide at a given pH is the sum of the charges of all ionizable groups, each governed by acid-base equilibria; the $pI$ is the pH where this sum equals zero.\n\nLet the ionizable groups be the N-terminus, C-terminus, and the side chain at the substituted position. For a basic group (e.g., N-terminus, Lys side chain), the fraction protonated at a given pH is\n$$\n\\alpha(\\text{pH})=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\text{pH}-pK_a}},\n$$\nso its contribution to net charge is $+\\,\\alpha(\\text{pH})$.

As pH increases, $\\alpha(\\text{pH})$ decreases and $\\beta(\\text{pH})$ increases; hence the total net charge decreases monotonically with pH.\n\nWriting the net charges using these standard forms and denoting the N- and C-terminal protonation functions as $\\alpha_{N}$ and $\\beta_{C}$, respectively, we have for the two peptides:\n$$\nq_{L}(\\text{pH})=+\\alpha_{N}(\\text{pH})-\\beta_{C}(\\text{pH})+\\alpha_{K}(\\text{pH}),\n$$\n$$\nq_{A}(\\text{pH})=+\\alpha_{N}(\\text{pH})-\\beta_{C}(\\text{pH})-\\beta_{D}(\\text{pH}),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{K}$ is the protonated fraction of the Lys side chain (basic, contributing $+1$ when protonated) and $\\beta_{D}$ is the deprotonated fraction of the Asp side chain (acidic, contributing $-1$ when deprotonated).\n\nSubtracting,\n$$\nq_{L}(\\text{pH})-q_{A}(\\text{pH})=\\alpha_{K}(\\text{pH})+\\beta_{D}(\\text{pH}).\n$$\nFor all pH, $\\alpha_{K}(\\text{pH})\\geq 0$ and $\\beta_{D}(\\text{pH})\\geq 0$, with at least one strictly positive except in trivial limiting cases. Therefore,\n$$\nq_{L}(\\text{pH})>q_{A}(\\text{pH})\\quad\\text{for all relevant pH}.\n$$\nSince the net charge decreases monotonically with pH for each peptide, the pH at which $q_{L}(\\text{pH})=0$ must be higher than the pH at which $q_{A}(\\text{pH})=0$. In other words,\n$$\npI_{L}>pI_{A}.\n$$\n\nThis establishes that substituting Lys (a basic side chain) with Asp (an acidic side chain) lowers the isoelectric point. Hence, the correct comparison is that the $pI$ of Peptide-A is lower than the $pI$ of Peptide-L.\n\nBy this reasoning, options C and D are incorrect because side-chain ionizable groups directly affect the net charge and thus the $pI$, regardless of identical termini or peptide length.
