Mastering this concept is the first step toward predicting and understanding protein structure from its primary sequence.", "problem": "In the field of computational biology, a primary goal is to predict the three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein from its primary amino acid sequence. A fundamental principle guiding this prediction for soluble, globular proteins is how different amino acid side chains interact with the aqueous environment of the cell's cytosol.\n\nConsider a hypothetical soluble protein that functions in the aqueous environment of a cell at physiological pH (~7.4). Based on the chemical properties of the glutamine (Gln) side chain, which of the following statements most accurately predicts its predominant location within the folded protein and provides the correct underlying physicochemical reason?\n\nA. In the hydrophobic interior, because its aliphatic side chain minimizes contact with water.\n\nB. On the aqueous-exposed surface, because its side chain is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules.\n\nC. In the hydrophobic interior, because its uncharged side chain can be stabilized by van der Waals interactions with other nonpolar residues.\n\nD. On the aqueous-exposed surface, because its side chain is deprotonated at physiological pH, acquiring a negative charge that is stabilized by water.\n\nE. In the hydrophobic interior, because its side chain contains a carbonyl group that can form a salt bridge with a positively charged residue.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physicochemical properties of the glutamine (Gln) side chain. Glutamine bears a terminal amide group (carbonyl and amide NH) attached to an aliphatic chain. The amide functional group is polar and uncharged at physiological pH. It can act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor via the carbonyl oxygen and as a hydrogen-bond donor via the amide NH. The side chain does not ionize under physiological conditions; amide nitrogens are not appreciably protonated, and the carbonyl oxygen does not carry a negative charge at pH near 7.4.\n\nIn aqueous environments, the hydrophobic effect drives nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains toward the protein interior to minimize unfavorable interactions with water, while polar and charged side chains preferentially reside on the protein surface where they can form favorable hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with water. Thus, a polar, uncharged, hydrogen-bonding side chain like glutamine’s is typically found on the aqueous-exposed surface, unless it is specifically buried to participate in an internal hydrogen-bond network that compensates for desolvation. The general preference, however, is surface exposure due to favorable solvation through hydrogen bonding.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because, although there is an aliphatic segment, the dominant feature is the polar amide, making the side chain overall polar and favorable for interaction with water.\n- B is correct because glutamine’s amide group can form hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules, favoring localization on the aqueous-exposed surface.\n- C is incorrect because “uncharged” does not imply “nonpolar”; the amide is strongly polar, so van der Waals stabilization in a hydrophobic core is not the predominant driving force for Gln.\n- D is incorrect because glutamine’s side chain is not deprotonated at physiological pH and does not acquire a negative charge; it remains neutral.\n- E is incorrect because a salt bridge requires oppositely charged groups; the amide carbonyl of glutamine is neutral and cannot form a salt bridge, although it can participate in hydrogen bonds.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that glutamine is predominantly found on the aqueous-exposed surface due to its capacity to form hydrogen bonds with water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2079478"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of residue placement, this thought experiment explores the direct energetic consequences of a mutation. By analyzing what happens when a nonpolar residue in a protein's core is swapped for a charged one [@problem_id:2079480], you will delve into the concept of folding stability, represented by the change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$). This exercise highlights the immense energetic cost of burying a charge away from water, providing a powerful demonstration of why proteins are so sensitive to certain mutations.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical monomeric, water-soluble, globular protein called \"Solvulin,\" which is stable and functional at a physiological pH of 7.4. The native tertiary structure of Solvulin is characterized by a densely packed hydrophobic core, composed almost exclusively of aliphatic nonpolar residues such as alanine, valine, and isoleucine. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the biochemist creates a mutant version of Solvulin by replacing a single leucine residue, located deep within this hydrophobic core, with an arginine residue.\n\nAt pH 7.4, a leucine side chain is nonpolar and uncharged. In contrast, an arginine side chain is large, polar, and carries a permanent positive charge. The change in Gibbs free energy of folding ($\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$) is defined as the free energy of the folded state minus the free energy of the unfolded state ($\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}} = G_{\\text{folded}} - G_{\\text{unfolded}}$), where a more negative value indicates greater protein stability.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this leucine-to-arginine mutation on the stability of the Solvulin protein?\n\nA. The $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ will become significantly less negative, destabilizing the protein, primarily due to the large energetic penalty of transferring the charged and polar arginine side chain from an aqueous environment (in the unfolded state) to the nonpolar core.\n\nB. The $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ will become significantly less negative, destabilizing the protein, primarily because the bulky arginine side chain introduces severe steric clashes that disrupt the tight packing of the aliphatic residues in the core.\n\nC. The stability of the protein will remain largely unchanged because the new arginine residue can form a stabilizing intramolecular salt bridge with a negatively charged residue on the protein's surface.\n\nD. The $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ will become more negative, stabilizing the protein, because the rigid structure of the arginine side chain will reduce the conformational entropy of the unfolded state.\n\nE. The $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ will become more negative, stabilizing the protein, as the buried positive charge of arginine will establish favorable cation-$\\pi$ interactions with aromatic residues that are universally present in hydrophobic cores.", "solution": "We are asked to predict how replacing a deeply buried leucine in a densely packed hydrophobic core with an arginine at pH 7.4 affects the folding free energy, where $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}} = G_{\\text{folded}} - G_{\\text{unfolded}}$ and a more negative value indicates greater stability. The central physical principles are the hydrophobic effect, electrostatic solvation, dielectric differences between water and the protein core, packing interactions, and entropic contributions. The key is to determine the sign and dominant contributors to $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ upon mutation, defined as\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{folding}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}^{\\text{Arg}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}^{\\text{Leu}}.\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ indicates that the mutant’s $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ is less negative (i.e., the protein is destabilized).\n\nIn the wild-type, leucine is nonpolar and uncharged, and burial of leucine in the hydrophobic core is favorable due to the hydrophobic effect and van der Waals packing, contributing a negative (stabilizing) term to $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}^{\\text{Leu}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{hydrophobic}}^{\\text{Leu, fold}} < 0.\n$$\nIn contrast, arginine at pH 7.4 carries a positive charge. In the unfolded state, the arginine side chain is exposed to water and is strongly stabilized by solvation (electrostatic and hydrogen bonding). Folding that buries the charged arginine into a low-dielectric, nonpolar core incurs a large desolvation penalty. The transfer free energy for moving a charge from water to the protein interior can be modeled by the Born equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}} = \\frac{q^{2}}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{prot}}} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{water}}} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the charge of the side chain, $r$ is an effective ionic radius, $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_{\\text{water}}$ is the dielectric constant of water, and $\\epsilon_{\\text{prot}}$ is the effective dielectric of the protein core. Because $\\epsilon_{\\text{prot}} \\ll \\epsilon_{\\text{water}}$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{prot}}} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{water}}} > 0$, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}} > 0$. This term is large and positive, producing a strong destabilization of the folded state when the charged arginine is buried:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}^{\\text{Arg, fold}} \\gg 0.\n$$\nOther terms can be considered but are secondary. Packing/steric effects can be unfavorable due to the bulkier arginine, contributing a positive term:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{packing}} > 0,\n$$\nbut this is generally smaller than the electrostatic desolvation penalty for burying a full charge. Entropic terms due to side-chain flexibility in the unfolded state could slightly reduce the conformational entropy penalty upon folding if arginine is more constrained, but any such $\\Delta \\Delta S$ is typically small compared to the large enthalpic and solvation penalties, so\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{entropy}} = - T \\Delta \\Delta S\n$$\nis expected to be minor relative to the dominant desolvation term. Formation of a compensating salt bridge is unlikely because the residue is deep in the hydrophobic core and would require either an already buried countercharge (rare and itself destabilizing without specific design) or substantial structural rearrangement that would disrupt the core. Cation-$\\pi$ interactions require proximal aromatic residues in a geometry that offsets the desolvation penalty; these are not universally present and, even if present, typically cannot compensate for the large positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$ of burying a full positive charge.\n\nCollecting these contributions, the dominant effect is\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{folding}} \\approx \\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}^{\\text{Arg, fold}} + \\text{(smaller positive terms)} > 0,\n$$\nso $\\Delta G_{\\text{folding}}$ becomes significantly less negative and the protein is destabilized, primarily due to the energetic penalty of transferring a charged, polar side chain from water to the nonpolar core.
