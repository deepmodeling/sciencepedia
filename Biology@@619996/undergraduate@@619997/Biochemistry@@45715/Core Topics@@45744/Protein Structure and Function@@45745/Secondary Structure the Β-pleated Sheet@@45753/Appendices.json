For such a barrel to be stable, the exterior surface that contacts the hydrophobic lipid tails of the membrane must be nonpolar, while the interior surface lining the aqueous channel must be polar. This requires each individual β-strand to be amphipathic.\n\nA β-strand has a backbone structure that is pleated, causing the side chains (R-groups) of adjacent amino acids to protrude in alternating opposite directions. This means that amino acids at positions 1, 3, 5, etc., will face one side of the strand, while amino acids at positions 2, 4, 6, etc., will face the opposite side.\n\nGiven the following classification of amino acids, identify which one of the hypothetical 7-amino-acid sequences below is most likely to form an amphipathic β-strand suitable for a transmembrane β-barrel.\n\n**Amino Acid Classification:**\n*   **Nonpolar (Hydrophobic):** Alanine (A), Valine (V), Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Methionine (M), Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W), Glycine (G), Proline (P)\n*   **Polar, Uncharged (Hydrophilic):** Serine (S), Threonine (T), Cysteine (C), Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **Polar, Charged (Hydrophilic):** Aspartate (D), Glutamate (E), Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Histidine (H)\n\n**Sequences (N-terminus to C-terminus):**\nA.

Therefore, to achieve an amphipathic strand suitable for a transmembrane beta-barrel (hydrophobic exterior contacting lipids and hydrophilic interior lining the aqueous pore), residues at alternating positions must alternate in character. Specifically, positions 1, 3, 5, 7 should be of one type (hydrophobic) and positions 2, 4, 6 of the opposite type (hydrophilic), or vice versa, yielding an H–P–H–P–H–P–H alternating pattern.\n\nClassification used:\n- Hydrophobic (H): A, V, L, I, M, F, W, G, P\n- Hydrophilic (P): S, T, C, N, Q, Y, D, E, K, R, H\n\nEvaluate each sequence by mapping to H/P per position:\n\nA.

Successfully solving it will sharpen your ability to visualize and interpret the intricate architecture of folded proteins from diagrams and descriptions.", "problem": "In structural biology, the topology of a β-sheet describes the order and connectivity of its constituent β-strands. Consider a protein domain that folds into a four-stranded β-sheet. The segments of the polypeptide chain that form these strands are designated S1, S2, S3, and S4, based on their sequential order from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.\n\nThe final three-dimensional structure of this β-sheet is determined by the following set of rules governing the spatial relationships between these strands:\n1.  Strands S1 and S2 are oriented parallel to each other and are separated by exactly two other strands within the final sheet structure.\n2.  Strands S2 and S3 are positioned adjacent to each other in the sheet and have an antiparallel orientation.\n3.  Strands S3 and S4 are also positioned adjacent to each other in the sheet and have an antiparallel orientation.\n\nGiven these rules, determine the possible linear arrangement(s) of the strands within the β-sheet, when viewed from one edge to the other.

Rule 1 says S1 and S2 are parallel and separated by exactly two other strands. In a four-stranded sheet, having exactly two strands between them forces S1 and S2 to occupy the two edges: either (S1 at $P_{1}$, S2 at $P_{4}$) or (S1 at $P_{4}$, S2 at $P_{1}$).\n\nRules 2 and 3 require S2 and S3 to be adjacent and antiparallel, and S3 and S4 to be adjacent and antiparallel. Therefore S2, S3, S4 must form a consecutive block with S3 in the middle: either (..., S2, S3, S4, ...) or (..., S4, S3, S2, ...).\n\nCombine these with the edge placement from Rule 1:\n\nCase A: Place S2 at $P_{1}$ and S1 at $P_{4}$. Then adjacency forces S3 at $P_{2}$ and S4 at $P_{3}$. The order is ($P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4}$)=(S2, S3, S4, S1), which matches option E.\n\nCase B: Place S2 at $P_{4}$ and S1 at $P_{1}$. Then adjacency forces S3 at $P_{3}$ and S4 at $P_{2}$. The order is ($P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4}$)=(S1, S4, S3, S2), which matches option B.\n\nOrientation consistency: From Rules 2 and 3, S2 antiparallel to S3 and S3 antiparallel to S4 imply S2 and S4 have the same orientation. Rule 1 requires S1 to be parallel to S2, so S1 shares the same orientation as S2 (and S4). The remaining adjacent pair (S4 with S1 in Case A, or S1 with S4 in Case B) is unconstrained by the problem and can be parallel, so no conflict arises.\n\nChecking the other options:\n- A: S1 and S2 are adjacent, violating Rule 1.\n- C: S1 and S2 are adjacent, violating Rule 1.\n- D: S3 and S4 are not adjacent, violating Rule 3; also S1 and S2 are not separated by two strands, violating Rule 1.\n\nTherefore, the valid arrangements are B and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "2075101"}, {"introduction": "Protein structures are not static; they are dynamic entities subject to cellular regulation and environmental changes. This final practice [@problem_id:2075145] asks you to predict the structural consequence of phosphorylation, a common biological switch, on a stable β-sheet. By analyzing the effects of introducing steric bulk and electrostatic charge into a tightly packed protein core, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the delicate balance of forces that maintains protein stability and function.", "problem": "A particular globular protein contains a large, stable antiparallel β-pleated sheet as a core structural motif. Within the middle of one of the central β-strands of this sheet lies a serine residue. The side chain of this serine, a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), is oriented such that it projects into the confined space between its own strand and an adjacent, antiparallel-running strand. A specific protein kinase enzyme acts on this protein, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of this particular serine residue. Assuming this phosphorylation event occurs, what is the most probable immediate consequence for the local stability and structure of the β-pleated sheet?\n\nA. The stability of the β-sheet will increase because the negatively charged phosphate group can form strong salt bridges with nearby positively charged residues.\n\nB. The phosphorylation will cause a localized transition from a β-strand to an α-helix to better accommodate the modified side chain.\n\nC. The local structure of the β-sheet will be destabilized due to the introduction of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion from the bulky, charged phosphate group.\n\nD. The β-sheet's stability will be largely unaffected because the modification is on a side chain, while the sheet's integrity relies on backbone hydrogen bonds.\n\nE. The stability of the β-sheet will increase as the phosphate group forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of the adjacent strand.", "solution": "We analyze the structural context and the chemical modification. In an antiparallel β-sheet, side chains from each strand alternate projecting to opposite faces of the sheet. In the tightly packed core of a stable sheet, side-chain packing is a major contributor to stability in addition to the backbone interstrand hydrogen bonds; thus, residues projecting into the interstrand space are generally small or compatible with the limited volume. The given serine side chain is projecting into the confined space between adjacent strands, which implies that local packing constraints are tight and sensitive to size and polarity.\n\nPhosphorylation of serine by a kinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to the side-chain hydroxyl, yielding phosphoserine. The phosphate moiety is tetrahedral and substantially larger than a hydroxyl and typically bears negative charge(s) at physiological pH. This modification therefore introduces both increased steric bulk and substantial negative charge at a position embedded in a confined, likely poorly solvated interstrand region.\n\nConsidering physical interactions and energetic consequences: (i) Steric hindrance increases due to the bulky phosphate, which can clash with the backbone and side chains of the adjacent strand in the tightly packed interstrand space. (ii) Electrostatics become unfavorable because the newly introduced negative charge will experience repulsion from nearby backbone carbonyl oxygens (which are partial negative) and any nearby negatively charged side chains; moreover, burying a charged group in a low-dielectric interior without compensatory interactions imposes a significant desolvation penalty. (iii) Formation of compensatory favorable interactions (such as salt bridges or new hydrogen bonds) is unlikely in this geometry: salt bridges require proximate positively charged residues and sufficient space, which is not assured in the stated core environment; additional hydrogen bonds to the backbone are geometrically constrained because backbone donors and acceptors in a β-sheet are already engaged in interstrand hydrogen bonding, and a phosphate primarily provides acceptor sites that would not pair favorably with backbone carbonyls (also acceptors). Therefore, the net effect is expected to be destabilizing.\n\nEvaluating the options: A requires a suitably positioned positively charged partner in a confined core, which is not guaranteed and is unlikely to outweigh steric and desolvation penalties; B posits a β-to-α transition, but such a local secondary structure conversion within a preformed sheet is not a probable immediate consequence of a single side-chain modification; D is incorrect because side-chain packing critically contributes to β-sheet stability, especially in the core; E assumes beneficial new hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms, which is geometrically and chemically improbable in the constrained sheet architecture. The most probable immediate consequence is local destabilization of the β-sheet due to steric and electrostatic strain, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2075145"}]}
