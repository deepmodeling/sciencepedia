The designed chain has a total length of 1050 amino acid residues. This chain consists of a central triple-helical domain flanked by two non-helical regions, known as telopeptides, at the N-terminus and C-terminus. The N-terminal telopeptide is designed to be 17 residues long, and the C-terminal telopeptide is 28 residues long. The central triple-helical domain is characterized by a repeating amino acid sequence motif of $Gly-X-Y$, where `Gly` is glycine and `X` and `Y` can be any other amino acid. Assuming this repeating motif is perfectly maintained throughout the entire length of the central domain, calculate the total number of glycine residues found within this triple-helical domain.", "solution": "Let the total chain length be $L_{\\text{total}}=1050$ residues, with N-terminal and C-terminal telopeptides of lengths $L_{N}=17$ and $L_{C}=28$, respectively.

In biochemistry, this frequently involves predicting the structural and functional consequences of genetic mutations. This exercise [@problem_id:2046550] presents a classic thought experiment that explores why the $Gly-X-Y$ motif is so strictly conserved, forcing a consideration of the unique structural role that glycine's minimal size plays in stabilizing the collagen triple helix.", "problem": "Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is a fibrous protein that serves a critical structural role in connective tissues. Its fundamental unit is a tropocollagen molecule, which consists of three polypeptide chains (alpha-chains) coiled around each other to form a right-handed triple helix. This unique helical structure is a direct consequence of its distinctive amino acid sequence, which is dominated by a repeating Gly-X-Y pattern. In this pattern, Gly represents glycine, and X and Y are frequently proline and hydroxyproline, respectively.\n\nConsider a scenario involving a single, isolated point mutation in the gene encoding one of the alpha-chains of type I collagen. This mutation results in the substitution of a single glycine residue, located in the central helical domain of the polypeptide, with an alanine residue. Assuming this mutated alpha-chain is incorporated into a tropocollagen molecule along with two normal alpha-chains, which of the following statements best predicts the primary structural consequence of this single amino acid substitution?\n\nA. The substitution will create a local disruption in the triple helix, likely causing a kink or a point of instability due to steric hindrance from the alanine side chain.\n\nB. The methyl group of the alanine residue will facilitate stronger van der Waals interactions, leading to a more tightly wound and overly stabilized triple helix.\n\nC. The mutation will completely prevent the three alpha-chains from associating, leading to a total failure of triple helix formation and secretion of only individual, unfolded chains from the cell.\n\nD. The presence of alanine will catalytically inhibit the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase, preventing the essential post-translational modification of nearby proline residues.\n\nE. The substitution of nonpolar glycine with nonpolar alanine will have no significant structural effect, as the overall hydrophobicity of the helix core remains unchanged.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the structural principle of the collagen triple helix: each of the three polypeptide chains adopts a left-handed helical conformation and they wrap together into a right-handed triple helix. The sequence requirement is dominated by a repeating Gly-X-Y motif. Critically, glycine, which has a hydrogen atom as its side chain, occurs at every third position and occupies the interior of the triple helix along the helical axis. The minimal steric bulk of glycine is essential to allow tight packing of the three chains without steric clashes.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of substituting glycine with alanine. Alanine has a methyl group as its side chain. Although alanine is small and nonpolar, its methyl group is significantly bulkier than hydrogen. When positioned at the helix core (where glycine normally sits), this additional bulk creates steric hindrance. The immediate structural consequence is a local destabilization of the triple helix at the site of substitution, which can manifest as a kink, unwinding, or point of instability. This is a well-established mechanism underlying many glycine substitution mutations in collagen-related disorders.\n\nWe then assess the extent of the effect in the context of a heterotrimer containing one mutant alpha-chain and two normal chains. A single glycine-to-alanine substitution typically does not globally prevent triple helix formation; rather, it slows folding kinetics and locally disrupts the helix, often yielding decreased thermal stability and a site-specific defect. Therefore, a complete failure of assembly into triple helix is unlikely from a single substitution alone when two chains are normal, making a catastrophic global failure an incorrect prediction.\n\nWe evaluate the provided options using these principles:\n\n- Option A predicts a local disruption due to steric hindrance from alanine. This aligns with the requirement for glycine at the core and the known impact of glycine substitutions, making it correct.\n- Option B posits stronger van der Waals interactions producing an overly stabilized helix. This contradicts the known necessity for minimal side chain bulk at the core; added bulk destabilizes rather than stabilizes. Hence incorrect.\n- Option C claims complete prevention of association and total failure of triple helix formation. A single glycine-to-alanine substitution typically causes local destabilization, not absolute failure to assemble; thus incorrect.\n- Option D invokes catalytic inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase by alanine. There is no mechanistic basis that an alanine at this position would inhibit prolyl hydroxylase; hydroxylation of proline depends on enzyme, cofactors such as ascorbate, and sequence context but is not catalytically inhibited by an alanine substitution at a glycine site. Incorrect.\n- Option E asserts no significant structural effect because both residues are nonpolar. This ignores the critical size constraint at the triple-helix core; even small increases from hydrogen to methyl disrupt packing. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction of the primary structural consequence is a local disruption of the triple helix caused by steric hindrance at the mutation site, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2046550"}, {"introduction": "The elegant structure of collagen extends from its molecular sequence to its macroscopic assembly into fibrils. These fibrils possess a characteristic banding pattern visible under an electron microscope, which is a direct result of the highly ordered, staggered arrangement of individual tropocollagen molecules. This final problem [@problem_id:2046535] challenges you to use a simple geometric model to derive the dimensions of these bands, connecting the length of a single molecule, $L$, to the observable stagger distance, $D$, of the entire fibril.", "problem": "Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, assembles into ordered fibrils that are responsible for the tensile strength of connective tissues. The fundamental unit of a collagen fibril is the tropocollagen molecule, a rigid rod of length $L$. These molecules self-assemble in a staggered, parallel array. Electron microscopy reveals that the fibril has a characteristic banding pattern with a repeating axial period of length $D$. This periodicity arises because each tropocollagen molecule is displaced by a distance $D$ relative to its adjacent molecule.\n\nThe specific relationship between the molecule length $L$ and the stagger distance $D$ results in the formation of \"gap\" and \"overlap\" regions along the fibril axis. Biochemical measurements have established that the length of the tropocollagen molecule is between four and five times the length of the D-period. The \"gap\" region is a zone of lower protein density where the end of one molecule and the beginning of the next molecule in sequence are separated by a void.\n\nBased on this structural model, derive a general analytical expression for the length of this gap region. Express your answer in terms of $L$ and $D$.", "solution": "Consider an infinite, parallel array of tropocollagen molecules of length $L$, with molecular start positions at $x = kD$ for all integers $k$, such that each molecule occupies the interval $[kD, kD + L)$. The axial density pattern is periodic with period $D$ because all start positions are separated by $D$.\n\nAt a position $x \\in [0, D)$ within one repeat, the number of molecules covering $x$ is the number of integers $k$ satisfying\n$$\nkD \\leq x < kD + L \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{x - L}{D} < k \\leq \\frac{x}{D}.\n$$\nTherefore, the coverage count is\n$$\nN(x) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{D} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{x - L}{D} \\right\\rceil + 1.\n$$\nFor $x \\in [0,D)$ we have $\\left\\lfloor x/D \\right\\rfloor = 0$, so\n$$\nN(x) = 1 - \\left\\lceil \\frac{x - L}{D} \\right\\rceil.\n$$\nLet $q = L/D$. Given the empirical constraint $4 < q < 5$, define $y(x) = \\frac{x - L}{D} = \\frac{x}{D} - q$. As $x$ varies over $[0,D)$, $y(x)$ varies over $[-q, 1 - q)$, which lies entirely in $(-5, -3)$. The transition in $\\lceil y(x) \\rceil$ occurs when $y(x) = -4$, i.e., when $\\frac{x}{D} = q - 4$. Thus:\n- For $0 \\leq x \\leq D(q - 4)$, $\\lceil y(x) \\rceil = -4$, giving $N(x) = 5$.\n- For $D(q - 4) < x < D$, $\\lceil y(x) \\rceil = -3$, giving $N(x) = 4$.\n\nHence, within each period $D$, there is a higher-density interval of length $D(q - 4) = L - 4D$ where five molecules overlap (the overlap region), and a lower-density interval of length $D - (L - 4D)$ where four molecules overlap (the gap region). The gap length $G$ is therefore\n$$\nG = D - (L - 4D) = 5D - L,\n$$\nwhich is positive precisely when $4D < L < 5D$, consistent with the biochemical constraint. Equivalently, in the more general case where $nD < L < (n+1)D$ for an integer $n$, the same counting yields $G = (n+1)D - L$; here $n = 4$ gives $G = 5D - L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5D - L}$$", "id": "2046535"}]}
