A standard β-turn is composed of four consecutive amino acid residues. The turn's conformation is stabilized by a single, characteristic hydrogen bond formed between the main-chain atoms of two of these four residues.\n\nConsider a tetrapeptide segment within a larger protein that forms a β-turn. The sequence of this segment is Alanine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine.\n\nWhich of the following correctly identifies the residue that provides the carbonyl oxygen (the hydrogen bond acceptor) and the residue that provides the amide hydrogen (the hydrogen bond donor) for the defining hydrogen bond of this β-turn?\n\nA.

By convention, these residues are numbered sequentially as residue $i$, residue $i+1$, residue $i+2$, and residue $i+3$.\n\nFor the given sequence Alanine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine, we can assign the numbering as follows:\n- Residue $i$: Alanine (Ala)\n- Residue $i+1$: Glycine (Gly)\n- Residue $i+2$: Aspartic acid (Asp)\n- Residue $i+3$: Serine (Ser)\n\nThe defining structural feature of a β-turn is a hydrogen bond that forms between the main-chain atoms of the first and the fourth residues in the turn. Specifically, the hydrogen bond is formed between the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue $i$ and the amide hydrogen atom of residue $i+3$. The carbonyl oxygen acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while the amide hydrogen acts as the hydrogen bond donor.\n\nApplying this rule to our specific sequence:\n- The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is provided by the peptide backbone of residue $i$. In this case, residue $i$ is Alanine.\n- The amide hydrogen (N-H) is provided by the peptide backbone of residue $i+3$. In this case, residue $i+3$ is Serine.\n\nTherefore, the hydrogen bond forms between the carbonyl oxygen of Alanine and the amide hydrogen of Serine.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The carbonyl oxygen is from Alanine, and the amide hydrogen is from Serine. This matches our conclusion.\nB. The carbonyl oxygen is from Alanine (residue $i$), and the amide hydrogen is from Aspartic acid (residue $i+2$). This describes a hydrogen bond between residues $i$ and $i+2$, which is not characteristic of a standard β-turn.\nC. The carbonyl oxygen is from Glycine (residue $i+1$), and the amide hydrogen is from Serine (residue $i+3$). This describes a hydrogen bond between residues $i+1$ and $i+3$, which is incorrect.\nD. The carbonyl oxygen is from Serine (residue $i+3$), and the amide hydrogen is from Alanine (residue $i$). This incorrectly reverses the roles of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. The oxygen atom is the acceptor, and the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen is the donor.\nE. The carbonyl oxygen is from Glycine (residue $i+1$), and the amide hydrogen is from Aspartic acid (residue $i+2$).

Certain amino acids, due to their unique size and conformational flexibility, are statistically favored in these tight turns.

The conformational constraints require specific backbone dihedral angles at positions $i+1$ and $i+2$, for which Proline at $i+1$ is favored due to its restricted $\\phi$ angle, and Glycine at $i+2$ is favored in type II $\\beta$-turns because it can adopt positive $\\phi$ values without steric clashes. Additionally, small or polar residues such as Serine and Threonine at the termini ($i$ and $i+3$) have high turn propensities. By contrast, branched aliphatic residues (Valine, Isoleucine, Leucine) and bulky aromatics (Tryptophan, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine) favor $\\beta$-strands and are less compatible with tight turns; Glutamic acid, Lysine, and Alanine strongly favor $\\alpha$-helices and do not particularly promote turns in the absence of turn-promoting residues.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA.

This final practice moves from structure to consequence, exploring a hypothetical scenario where a flexible loop containing a β-turn is essential for catalytic activity. By analyzing the effect of a single amino acid mutation [@problem_id:2088579], you will appreciate how the specific stereochemical properties of a residue like glycine can be indispensable for a protein's function, highlighting the delicate interplay between sequence, structure, and biological activity.", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, “Catalysin,” possesses a deep active site cleft. The entrance to this cleft is regulated by a flexible surface loop that connects two antiparallel β-strands. For the substrate to enter the active site, this loop must undergo a significant conformational change, folding back upon itself in a tight β-turn. Sequence analysis of Catalysin and its homologs reveals a highly conserved glycine residue at the most constrained position within this turn. A research group engineers a mutant version of Catalysin by replacing this critical glycine with a tryptophan residue.\n\nAssuming the mutation does not prevent the initial transcription and translation of the polypeptide chain, which of the following statements describes the most likely and direct consequence of this glycine-to-tryptophan mutation on the structure and function of Catalysin?\n\nA. The newly introduced tryptophan will form a stronger hydrogen bond network within the loop, increasing the thermal stability of the enzyme but not affecting its catalytic activity.\n\nB. The loop will become more flexible, allowing the substrate to access the active site more rapidly and thereby increasing the overall reaction rate.\n\nC. The bulky side chain of tryptophan will cause a steric clash, preventing the loop from adopting the tight turn conformation necessary for substrate binding, thus leading to a significant loss of enzyme activity.\n\nD.

This accommodates the high curvature required for a tight $\\beta$-turn.\n\n2) Conservation and functional inference:\n- The glycine at the most constrained position is highly conserved across homologs, indicating strong functional selection, typically due to steric and conformational requirements of the loop conformation necessary for substrate gating.\n\n3) Effect of replacing glycine with tryptophan:\n- Tryptophan possesses a bulky indole side chain. This introduces steric bulk near the backbone, restricting the set of accessible $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles and disfavoring tight curvature required for the turn.\n- The increased steric hindrance and reduced conformational freedom directly oppose the loop’s ability to fold back into the tight $\\beta$-turn conformation.\n- As the loop regulates entrance to a deep active site cleft, failure to adopt the necessary turn conformation will impair opening or proper positioning of the loop, thereby obstructing substrate access and/or proper binding geometry.\n\n4) Assessing the given options:\n- A: Incorrect. Tryptophan does not generally form stronger hydrogen-bond networks in loops; it is bulky and largely hydrophobic. Moreover, a mutation at a conserved, constrained turn would be expected to impact function if gating is required for catalysis.\n- B: Incorrect. Glycine is the most flexible residue; replacing it with tryptophan reduces, not increases, flexibility and conformational accessibility.\n- C: Correct. The bulky tryptophan side chain is likely to cause steric clashes and prevent formation of the tight turn essential for substrate access, directly leading to decreased or lost catalytic activity.\n- D: Incorrect. Although loops can be flexible, this loop is functionally critical for gating. Conservation of glycine indicates structural and functional importance.\n- E: Incorrect. There is no known post-translational modification that converts tryptophan to mimic glycine’s steric properties.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and direct consequence is steric hindrance preventing the necessary tight turn and thereby diminishing enzyme activity due to impaired substrate binding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2088579"}]}
