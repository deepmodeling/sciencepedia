This exercise introduces the 'heptad repeat,' the specific sequence pattern that directs the formation of α-keratin's signature structure. You will act as a structural biochemist, analyzing a peptide fragment to determine if it contains the necessary hydrophobic and charged residues arranged in the correct pattern to form a stable coiled-coil [@problem_id:2046817].", "problem": "Alpha-keratin, a key structural protein found in hair, nails, and horns, is characterized by its formation of a two-stranded coiled-coil structure. This superhelical twisting is stabilized by a specific, repeating amino acid sequence pattern known as a heptad repeat. The heptad repeat is a seven-residue pattern, commonly denoted by the letters `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The stability of the coiled-coil interface depends critically on the identity of the amino acids at positions `a` and `d`. These two positions form a \"hydrophobic stripe\" that buries itself in the core of the two-helix structure. Consequently, positions `a` and `d` are almost always occupied by nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine, Methionine). Positions `e` and `g`, which are located on the outer surface of the interface, are often occupied by charged amino acids (e.g., Lysine, Arginine, Glutamate, Aspartate), allowing for stabilizing ionic interactions between the two helices.\n\nA biochemist has isolated a novel protein from a thermophilic bacterium and sequenced a short fragment of it. They hypothesize that this fragment may form an $\\alpha$-keratin-like coiled-coil. The sequence of the peptide fragment is:\n\n`Leu-Glu-Ser-Val-Gln-Lys-Ala-Ile-Glu-Ala-Leu-Lys-Gln-Val`\n\nBased on the principles of the heptad repeat, evaluate the likelihood that this peptide sequence could form a stable coiled-coil structure. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment?\n\nA. The sequence is a strong candidate for forming a coiled-coil because the key `a` and `d` positions are consistently occupied by hydrophobic residues.\n\nB. The sequence is a poor candidate for forming a coiled-coil because the residues at positions `a` and `d` are predominantly polar.\n\nC. The sequence is a strong candidate for forming a coiled-coil because the residues at positions `b`, `c`, and `f` are predominantly hydrophobic.\n\nD. The sequence is a poor candidate for forming a coiled-coil because position `g` is occupied by a hydrophobic residue instead of a charged residue.\n\nE. The sequence is a poor candidate for forming a coiled-coil because it lacks Proline and Glycine residues.", "solution": "Assign the heptad registers to the 14-residue sequence, which comprises two full heptads. Using the standard a–g pattern:\n- Heptad 1 (residues 1–7): a = Leu, b = Glu, c = Ser, d = Val, e = Gln, f = Lys, g = Ala.\n- Heptad 2 (residues 8–14): a = Ile, b = Glu, c = Ala, d = Leu, e = Lys, f = Gln, g = Val.\n\nEvaluate the key coiled-coil criteria:\n- Positions a and d, which form the hydrophobic core, are Leu/Val in heptad 1 and Ile/Leu in heptad 2, i.e., consistently hydrophobic. This strongly supports coiled-coil formation.\n- Positions e and g are often charged to enable interhelical salt bridges, but this is not an absolute requirement. Here, e positions are Gln (polar) and Lys (positively charged); g positions are Ala and Val (hydrophobic). Hydrophobic residues at g can occur and do not by themselves preclude coiled-coil formation; they may reduce electrostatic stabilization but the dominant determinant is the hydrophobic a/d stripe.\n\nAssess each option against these findings:\n- A: True. The a and d positions are consistently hydrophobic, matching the primary stabilizing feature of coiled-coils.\n- B: False. The a and d positions are not predominantly polar; they are hydrophobic.\n- C: False. Positions b, c, and f here include Glu, Ser, Lys, and Gln, which are not predominantly hydrophobic.\n- D: False. While charged residues at g can be favorable, hydrophobic residues at g do not make the sequence a poor candidate by themselves, especially when a/d are optimal.\n- E: False. Proline and Glycine are not required for coiled-coils; in fact, Proline often disrupts helices.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that the sequence is a strong coiled-coil candidate due to the hydrophobic a/d pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2046817"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to recognize the sequence pattern that stabilizes the α-keratin coiled-coil, we can now explore the consequences of disrupting it. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario involving a genetic mutation at a critical position within the heptad repeat. By evaluating the impact of substituting a core hydrophobic amino acid with a polar one, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the delicate balance of forces that maintains protein structure and how single molecular changes can lead to significant destabilization [@problem_id:2046866].", "problem": "The protein $\\alpha$-keratin, a key structural component of hair, wool, and nails, is a classic example of a coiled-coil protein. Its structure is formed by two right-handed $\\alpha$-helices twisting around each other to form a left-handed superhelix. This association is stabilized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acid residues, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as $(a\\text{-}b\\text{-}c\\text{-}d\\text{-}e\\text{-}f\\text{-}g)_n$. In this pattern, positions 'a' and 'd' are crucial as they typically contain nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids. These residues line up to form a hydrophobic \"seam\" or core that holds the two helices together via hydrophobic interactions.\n\nConsider a genetic variant of $\\alpha$-keratin where a specific leucine residue, located at a 'd' position within one of the heptad repeats, is mutated to a serine residue. Based on the fundamental principles of protein structure and stability, what is the most likely consequence of this single amino acid substitution on the keratin coiled-coil assembly?\n\nA. The substitution of leucine with serine will significantly strengthen the coiled-coil structure by allowing for new hydrogen bonds between the helices.\n\nB. The substitution will destabilize the coiled-coil structure due to the disruption of the hydrophobic core.\n\nC. The mutation will cause the individual right-handed $\\alpha$-helices to convert into left-handed helices.\n\nD. The substitution will have no significant effect on the protein's structure, as both leucine and serine are amino acids of similar size.\n\nE. The mutation will lead to the formation of a covalent disulfide bond between the two keratin helices, locking them together permanently.", "solution": "We analyze the coiled-coil assembly principles for an $\\alpha$-keratin heptad repeat $(a\\text{-}b\\text{-}c\\text{-}d\\text{-}e\\text{-}f\\text{-}g)_{n}$, where positions $a$ and $d$ typically host hydrophobic residues that pack into the buried core seam of the two-stranded coiled coil. The stability arises primarily from hydrophobic interactions at these core positions and complementary packing of side chains.\n\nLeucine at a $d$ position contributes significantly to core stability due to its large, nonpolar aliphatic side chain that packs favorably with opposing hydrophobic residues. Substituting leucine with serine introduces a polar side chain bearing a hydroxyl group. When placed in the hydrophobic core, this polar group faces two main energetic penalties:\n1. Desolvation penalty: removing the serine hydroxyl from water without providing compensatory hydrogen bonding interactions raises the free energy.\n2. Packing disruption: the smaller and polar serine side chain reduces hydrophobic surface area and introduces a mismatch in the tight packing characteristic of $a/d$ positions, potentially creating cavities or strain.\n\nRegarding the proposed options:\n- A is incorrect because the core environment is hydrophobic; introducing serine does not typically create stabilizing interhelical hydrogen bonds in the buried core, and any unsatisfied polar group is destabilizing.\n- B is correct: replacing a hydrophobic core leucine at a $d$ position with serine disrupts the hydrophobic seam and destabilizes the coiled-coil assembly.\n- C is incorrect because the handedness of the individual $\\alpha$-helices is determined by the peptide backbone stereochemistry and general folding principles, not by a single side-chain substitution at a core position.\n- D is incorrect because leucine and serine differ markedly in hydrophobicity and size; they are not functionally similar at a buried core position.\n- E is incorrect because disulfide bonds involve cysteine residues; serine cannot form disulfide bonds.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is destabilization of the coiled-coil due to disruption of the hydrophobic core at the $d$ position.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2046866"}]}
