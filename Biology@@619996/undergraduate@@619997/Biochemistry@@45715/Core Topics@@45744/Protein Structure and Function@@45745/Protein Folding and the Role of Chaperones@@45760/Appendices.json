This protein is composed of a mixture of polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acid residues. In its native biological environment, an aqueous buffer, it adopts a specific, stable, and functional three-dimensional conformation.\n\nThe experiment consists of two parts. First, the protein is completely denatured, disrupting its tertiary and secondary structures into a random coil. Then, the denatured protein is divided into two samples and allowed to refold under two different conditions:\n1.  **Condition 1:** A standard aqueous buffer at neutral pH, identical to its native environment.\n2.  **Condition 2:** A pure, aprotic, and nonpolar organic solvent (hexane).\n\nAssuming the protein can reach a thermodynamically stable conformation in both solvents, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected final state of the protein when refolded in the nonpolar hexane solvent (Condition 2)?\n\nA. The protein will adopt a stable, compact folded conformation that is effectively \"inside-out\" compared to its native structure. Its nonpolar residues will be exposed on the surface, while its polar residues will be buried in the core.\n\nB. The protein will fail to fold and will remain as a denatured random coil, because the hydrophobic effect, which is the primary driving force for folding, is absent in a nonpolar solvent.\n\nC. The protein will fold into the exact same native three-dimensional structure as it does in the aqueous buffer, because the primary amino acid sequence is the sole determinant of the final folded structure.\n\nD. The polar residues on the protein's surface will cause the protein to aggregate and precipitate out of the nonpolar solvent, preventing the formation of any stable monomeric structure.\n\nE. The nonpolar solvent will act as a denaturant and chemically break the peptide bonds, leading to the degradation of the protein into smaller peptide fragments.", "solution": "We seek the thermodynamically preferred conformation in an aprotic, nonpolar solvent (hexane), given that the denatured protein can reach a stable folded state. Protein folding proceeds to minimize the Gibbs free energy, so the spontaneous direction satisfies $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}<0$, with\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}=\\Delta H_{\\text{intra}}+\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}.\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta H_{\\text{intra}}$ accounts for internal interactions (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, salt bridges), $\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}$ for solute-solvent interactions, $\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}$ for the loss of chain configurational entropy upon folding, and $\\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}$ for the solvent entropy change.\n\nIn water (native context), nonpolar residues are poorly solvated and induce ordering of water; burying them reduces the ordering penalty, making $-T\\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}$ favorable upon folding. Polar and charged residues are well solvated; thus, in aqueous folding, nonpolar side chains tend to be buried while polar residues are more often exposed, and the backbone polar groups are satisfied via internal hydrogen bonds within secondary structure.\n\nIn hexane, an aprotic, nonpolar solvent with low dielectric constant, polar and charged groups are very poorly solvated, making exposure of polar residues highly unfavorable (large positive contribution to $\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}$). Nonpolar residues, however, are well solvated by dispersion interactions, so exposing nonpolar side chains to hexane lowers $\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}$. To minimize $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$, the protein will therefore reorganize such that polar and charged groups are buried and internally hydrogen-bonded or paired (reducing $\\Delta H_{\\text{intra}}$), while nonpolar residues are presented on the surface to interact with the nonpolar solvent (favoring $\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}$). This yields an effectively \"inside-out\" fold relative to the aqueous native structure. The backbone amide and carbonyl groups are polar and will also be sequestered by forming internal secondary structures (e.g., $\\alpha$-helices or $\\beta$-sheets), which further reduces the enthalpic penalty.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the assumption that a stable conformation is reached in hexane. It excludes:\n- Option B: Even if the classic aqueous hydrophobic effect is absent, other contributions (internal hydrogen bonding, van der Waals packing, electrostatics in a low dielectric) and the strong penalty for exposing polar groups in hexane still drive folding; moreover, the problem assumes a stable conformation can be achieved.\n- Option C: While the primary sequence encodes the folding landscape, the solvent environment alters $\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}$, thereby changing the global minimum; the identical native structure in both solvents is not expected.\n- Option D: Aggregation and precipitation are not mandated by polar surface residues because the protein can bury those residues internally in hexane; the assumption of a stable monomeric fold further contradicts precipitation.\n- Option E: Hexane does not chemically cleave peptide bonds; peptide bond hydrolysis requires water and usually catalysts or extreme conditions, not a nonpolar aprotic solvent.\n\nTherefore, the protein in hexane is expected to adopt a stable, compact, \"inside-out\" conformation with nonpolar residues on the surface and polar residues buried in the core.\n\nThe most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066494"}, {"introduction": "While simple proteins often fold in a single, cooperative step, many cellular proteins are more complex, consisting of multiple domains with different stabilities.

Previous experiments on the isolated domains have established the following properties:\n1.  The two domains unfold independently of each other.\n2.  The unfolding of each isolated domain can be described as a two-state cooperative transition from a native (N) to an unfolded (U) state.\n3.

This matches a biphasic two-step unfolding.

This practice explores the intricate, ATP-dependent mechanism of the GroEL/GroES system through a thought experiment involving a functionally impaired mutant. By analyzing the consequences of deficient ATP hydrolysis, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how these chaperones act as catalytic machines that manage the cellular proteome, rather than as simple passive containers. [@problem_id:2066496]", "problem": "The GroEL/GroES chaperonin system is a molecular machine that assists in the folding of newly synthesized or stress-denatured proteins. The wild-type (WT) system consists of two back-to-back heptameric rings of the GroEL (GroE Large subunit) protein, which form a central cavity. The cycle begins when a non-native substrate protein binds to hydrophobic patches in the apical domain of a GroEL ring. Binding of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and the cochaperone GroES (GroE Small subunit), which acts as a lid, encapsulates the substrate inside a hydrophilic folding chamber, often called the \"Anfinsen cage\". ATP hydrolysis within this ring (the *cis* ring) acts as a timer. Subsequent ATP binding to the opposite (*trans*) ring triggers the release of GroES and the substrate, which is now either folded or can rebind for another cycle. This makes the WT system a catalytic machine.\n\nConsider an engineered mutant of GroEL (mut-GroEL) with the following two properties:\n1.  The folding chamber volume is twice as large as the WT chamber.\n2.  Its rate of ATP hydrolysis is less than 1% of the WT rate, although its ability to bind ATP is unaffected.\n\nAn *in vitro* refolding experiment is performed. A small, 15 kDa monomeric protein, known to be an obligate substrate for the GroEL/GroES system, is chemically denatured. It is then rapidly diluted into one of two separate buffer solutions, both maintained at an optimal temperature and containing a saturating concentration of ATP.\n-   Solution 1 contains the WT GroEL/GroES system.\n-   Solution 2 contains the mut-GroEL/GroES system.\n\nIn both cases, the total molar concentration of chaperonin complexes is equal to the initial molar concentration of the denatured substrate protein. The experiment measures the concentration of functionally active, folded substrate protein that appears in the bulk solution over a period of 30 minutes.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the experiment when comparing the mut-GroEL/GroES system to the WT system?\n\nA. The mutant system will bind the substrate but then trap it within the chaperonin complex, leading to a near-zero yield of active protein in the bulk solution because the catalytic cycle cannot be completed.\n\nB. The enlarged chamber of the mutant system will be less effective at preventing aggregation, leading to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates within the chaperone and a significantly lower folding yield than the wild-type.\n\nC. The significantly longer residence time of the substrate inside the mutant's folding chamber will allow it to fold with much higher fidelity, resulting in a final yield of active protein that is substantially greater than the wild-type system.\n\nD. The mutant system will be unable to bind the GroES cap due to its deficient ATPase activity, causing the substrate to remain exposed and rapidly aggregate in solution before it can be encapsulated.\n\nE. The mutant system will function identically to the wild-type system for this small substrate, as the enlarged chamber and slow ATP hydrolysis only affect the folding of much larger, more complex proteins.", "solution": "Key mechanistic principles for the GroEL/GroES cycle:\n- ATP binding to a GroEL ring promotes GroES binding and substrate encapsulation in the cis chamber; this step depends on ATP binding, not on ATP hydrolysis.\n- ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring acts as a timing step. Subsequent ATP binding to the trans ring triggers GroES and substrate release. Thus, ATP hydrolysis is the kinetic gate that determines residence time inside the chamber and is required to complete the catalytic cycle and release product to the bulk solution.\n- The encapsulated chamber is hydrophilic and suppresses aggregation; its confinement effect can assist folding but does not itself release product.\n\nDefine the hydrolysis rate constants:\n- Let $k_{\\text{hyd}}^{\\text{WT}}$ be the effective hydrolysis rate for the WT cis ring.\n- For the mutant, $k_{\\text{hyd}}^{\\text{mut}}<0.01\\,k_{\\text{hyd}}^{\\text{WT}}$ while ATP binding is unaffected.\n\nResidence time scaling:\n- The mean residence time before hydrolysis in a given cis state is $\\tau = 1/k_{\\text{hyd}}$.\n- Therefore, $\\tau_{\\text{mut}} > 100\\,\\tau_{\\text{WT}}$.\n\nExperimental setup constraints:\n- Saturating ATP is present for both solutions, so ATP binding is not rate limiting.\n- The total molar concentration of chaperonin complexes equals the initial molar concentration of denatured substrate. Rapid capture and encapsulation will therefore load essentially all complexes with one substrate each immediately, minimizing free substrate and preventing bulk aggregation at $t \\approx 0$.\n- The measured observable is the concentration of active folded substrate in the bulk solution over $T=30$ minutes. This requires release from the cis complex.\n\nRelease probability within the observation window:\n- Model the hydrolysis-triggered exit as a Poisson process with rate $k_{\\text{hyd}}$.

Even if folding occurs inside the chamber, product remains sequestered and does not appear in the bulk solution.\n\nAssessment of answer choices:\n- A: Correct. The mutant will bind ATP and GroES (ATP binding intact) and encapsulate substrate, but the drastically reduced hydrolysis rate prevents timely completion of the catalytic cycle, effectively trapping substrate and yielding near-zero active protein in bulk within the measurement window.\n- B: Incorrect. A twofold larger chamber remains hydrophilic and anti-aggregating; aggregation within the chamber is unlikely to dominate outcomes compared to kinetic trapping by slow hydrolysis.\n- C: Incorrect. Although longer residence could, in principle, aid folding, the measured yield in bulk over 30 minutes is limited by release; with very slow hydrolysis, bulk yield remains very low, not higher than WT.\n- D: Incorrect. GroES binding depends on ATP binding, which is unaffected. Deficient hydrolysis does not prevent encapsulation; it prevents timely release.\n- E: Incorrect. Even for small substrates, the catalytic throughput is controlled by hydrolysis-gated release; the mutant will not function identically to WT on this timescale.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the mutant system binds and encapsulates substrate but traps it, producing a near-zero yield of active protein in the bulk solution over the experimental timeframe.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066496"}]}
