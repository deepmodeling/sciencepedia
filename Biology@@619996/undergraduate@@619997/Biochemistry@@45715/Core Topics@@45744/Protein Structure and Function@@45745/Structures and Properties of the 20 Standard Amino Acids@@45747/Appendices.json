This principle describes the tendency for nonpolar components to associate with each other in an aqueous environment, minimizing their contact with water molecules. Consequently, amino acid residues with nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains are typically buried in the protein's interior, while residues with polar, hydrophilic side chains are usually found on the protein's surface, where they can interact with water.\n\nConsider the three amino acids: Leucine, Serine, and Aspartate. Based on the chemical properties of their side chains at physiological pH (approximately 7.4), predict their most likely relative arrangement in a folded globular protein. Which of the following options correctly lists these amino acids in order from the one most likely to be found in the protein's core to the one most likely to be found on the protein's surface?\n\nA.

For an ionizable group with acid form $\\mathrm{HA}$ and conjugate base $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$, the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation is\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}=10^{pH-pK_{a}}.\n$$\nThus, when $pHpK_{a}$, the deprotonated (charged) form is favored; when $pHpK_{a}$, the protonated form is favored.\n\n- Leucine: The side chain is aliphatic and nonpolar with no ionizable group under physiological conditions, so it remains neutral and strongly hydrophobic. By the hydrophobic effect, leucine residues are most likely to be buried in the protein core.\n\n- Serine: The side chain is $-CH_{2}OH$ with a hydroxyl group that is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. The hydroxyl group has a high $pK_{a}$ (well above physiological $pH$), so it remains uncharged at $pH \\approx 7.4$, but it is still polar. Polar uncharged residues commonly reside on the surface or in positions where they can form hydrogen bonds, making serine more surface-favored than leucine but less so than a charged residue.\n\n- Aspartate: The side chain is a carboxylic acid with $pK_{a}$ below physiological $pH$, so since $pHpK_{a}$, the deprotonated carboxylate form predominates, giving a negative charge. This charged, highly hydrophilic side chain strongly prefers the aqueous-exposed surface.\n\nRanking from most likely in the core to most likely on the surface therefore follows hydrophobicity: leucine (most hydrophobic) first, serine (polar uncharged) next, and aspartate (negatively charged) last. This corresponds to the ordering: Leucine, Serine, Aspartate.\n\nHence, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2078400"}, {"introduction": "The biological activity of peptides and proteins is profoundly influenced by their net electrical charge, which varies with the pH of the surrounding environment.
