The efficiency of oxygen binding can be described by the fractional saturation, denoted as $Y_{O_2}$, which is the fraction of myoglobin molecules that have oxygen bound to them. The relationship between the fractional saturation, the partial pressure of oxygen ($pO_2$), and myoglobin's intrinsic affinity for oxygen is given by the equation:\n\n$$Y_{O_2} = \\frac{pO_2}{P_{50} + pO_2}$$\n\nHere, $P_{50}$ is a constant representing the partial pressure of oxygen at which exactly half of the myoglobin binding sites are occupied.\n\nIn the environment of a resting muscle tissue near the arterial end of a capillary, the partial pressure of oxygen ($pO_2$) is approximately 100 torr.

Its ability to bind oxygen depends on a prosthetic group called heme, which contains an iron atom in the ferrous state, Fe(II). The heme group is situated in a hydrophobic pocket. Two critical histidine residues interact with the heme group. The 'proximal histidine' directly coordinates with the iron atom, anchoring the heme to the protein. The 'distal histidine', located on the opposite side of the heme plane, does not directly bond to the iron but resides near the oxygen-binding site.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed on the myoglobin gene, resulting in a mutant protein where the distal histidine is replaced by a glycine residue. Glycine is the smallest amino acid, with a hydrogen atom as its side chain.\n\nAssuming this mutation does not significantly alter the overall tertiary structure of the protein, what is the most likely effect on the oxygen-binding affinity, as measured by the partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of the myoglobin molecules are saturated ($P_{50}$)?\n\nA. The $P_{50}$ will decrease significantly, indicating a higher affinity for oxygen.\n\nB. The $P_{50}$ will increase significantly, indicating a lower affinity for oxygen.\n\nC. The $P_{50}$ will remain unchanged, as the distal histidine is not directly bonded to the heme iron.\n\nD.
