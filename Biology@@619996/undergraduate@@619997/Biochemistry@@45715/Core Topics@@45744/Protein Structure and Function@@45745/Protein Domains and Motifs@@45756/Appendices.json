One of the first computational steps in characterizing a new protein is to search for structural clues, such as transmembrane domains that anchor it within a lipid bilayer.

By applying simple, rule-based criteria for length and hydrophobicity, you will learn to predict how many times a protein is likely to span the cell membrane, a critical piece of information for understanding its biological role.", "problem": "Biochemists are studying a newly discovered protein, the Halocrenarchaeal Transporter A (HtrA), isolated from an extremophile archaeon living in a high-salt environment. They hypothesize that HtrA is an Integral Membrane Protein (IMP) with multiple segments that span the cell membrane. To test this, they perform a computational analysis of its primary amino acid sequence using a hydropathy plot.\n\nThe standard procedure for identifying a potential alpha-helical transmembrane domain from this analysis involves two criteria:\n1.  **Hydrophobicity Criterion**: The segment must have a sufficiently high average hydropathy index. The threshold for consideration is an average index greater than +1.5.\n2.  **Length Criterion**: The segment must be long enough to span the lipid bilayer. It is estimated that a continuous stretch of at least 19 amino acid residues is required.\n\nThe computational analysis of the HtrA sequence yielded several contiguous regions where the running average of the hydropathy index was positive. The data for these specific regions are summarized below:\n\n-   **Region A**: A segment from residue 42 to residue 58, with an average hydropathy index of +2.3.\n-   **Region B**: A segment from residue 91 to residue 112, with an average hydropathy index of +1.9.\n-   **Region C**: A segment from residue 145 to residue 160, with an average hydropathy index of +1.4.\n-   **Region D**: A segment from residue 205 to residue 227, with an average hydropathy index of +2.5.\n-   **Region E**: A segment from residue 280 to residue 300, with an average hydropathy index of +1.1.\n-   **Region F**: A segment from residue 333 to residue 352, with an average hydropathy index of +1.7.\n\nBased on the provided criteria and data, determine the total number of alpha-helical transmembrane domains that HtrA is predicted to have.", "solution": "We apply the two criteria to each region.

You will analyze hypothetical data from a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment, a powerful technique used to study protein binding. By observing how the deletion of specific PDZ domains affects the interaction, you will develop the critical skill of interpreting experimental results to assign a specific function to a particular protein domain.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the interaction between Post-Synaptic Density protein 95 (PSD-95) and a specific subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a key process for synaptic signaling in neurons. PSD-95 is a scaffolding protein that contains three distinct protein-protein interaction domains known as PDZ domains, labeled sequentially as PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3. To determine which of these domains is essential for binding to the C-terminal tail of the NMDA receptor subunit, the researcher creates a series of deletion mutants of PSD-95.\n\nEach PSD-95 construct is fused to a reporter tag. The constructs are:\n1.  **WT**: Full-length, wild-type PSD-95 containing all three PDZ domains.\n2.  **$\\Delta$PDZ1**: A mutant lacking the PDZ1 domain.\n3.  **$\\Delta$PDZ2**: A mutant lacking the PDZ2 domain.\n4.  **$\\Delta$PDZ3**: A mutant lacking the PDZ3 domain.\n\nEach construct is expressed in cultured cells along with the NMDA receptor subunit. The researcher then performs a Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment. In this experiment, an antibody against the reporter tag is used to pull down the PSD-95 construct and any proteins bound to it. The amount of the NMDA receptor subunit that is co-precipitated with each PSD-95 construct is then quantified. The results are normalized to the amount of NMDA receptor pulled down by the wild-type (WT) PSD-95, which is set as 100%.\n\nThe quantified results are as follows:\n\n-   **WT construct**: 100% relative binding\n-   **$\\Delta$PDZ1 construct**: 98% relative binding\n-   **$\\Delta$PDZ2 construct**: 4% relative binding\n-   **$\\Delta$PDZ3 construct**: 95% relative binding\n\nBased on this experimental data, which PDZ domain is uniquely essential for the primary interaction between PSD-95 and this NMDA receptor subunit?\n\nA.

Conversely, if deletion yields $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}k} \\approx 1$, the domain is not required for the interaction under these conditions.\n\nApplying this criterion:\n- For $\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}1$, $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}1}=0.98 \\approx 1$, indicating PDZ1 is not required.\n- For $\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}3$, $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}3}=0.95 \\approx 1$, indicating PDZ3 is not required.\n- For $\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}2$, $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}2}=0.04 \\approx 0$, indicating PDZ2 is necessary for the interaction.\n\nBecause only deletion of PDZ2 causes a near-complete loss of co-precipitation while deletions of PDZ1 and PDZ3 do not, PDZ2 is uniquely essential for the primary interaction with this NMDA receptor subunit.
