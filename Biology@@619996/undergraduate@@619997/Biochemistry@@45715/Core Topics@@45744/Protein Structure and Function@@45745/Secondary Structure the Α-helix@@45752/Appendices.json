This first practice focuses on the fundamental relationship between the pitch, $P$, which is the vertical distance of one full turn, and the rise, $r$, the distance each amino acid contributes along the central axis. By mastering this simple calculation, you can determine one of the most defining features of any α-helix: the number of residues per turn.

Using high-resolution structural analysis techniques, the biochemist obtains two key measurements. The first is the pitch of the helix, defined as the vertical distance along the helical axis corresponding to one complete turn, which is measured to be $5.4$ angstroms ($\\AA$). The second is the rise per residue, which is the axial distance contributed by each amino acid residue, measured to be $1.5 \\AA$.\n\nBased on these experimental values, calculate the number of amino acid residues present in a single complete turn of this α-helix.", "solution": "Define $P$ as the pitch (axial distance per full helical turn), $r$ as the rise per residue (axial distance per amino acid), and $N$ as the number of residues per turn. By the definition of pitch and rise, the total axial distance covered in one turn by $N$ residues is\n$$\nP = N r.\n$$\nSolving for $N$ gives\n$$\nN = \\frac{P}{r}.\n$$\nSubstituting the measured values $P = 5.4$ angstroms and $r = 1.5$ angstroms, the units cancel, yielding\n$$\nN = \\frac{5.4}{1.5} = 3.6.\n$$\nThus, there are $3.6$ amino acid residues per complete turn of the $\\alpha$-helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.6}$$", "id": "2074844"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've defined the shape of the α-helix, let's explore what holds it together so tightly. The structure is stabilized by a remarkably regular pattern of hydrogen bonds formed between the polypeptide backbone's own atoms.

A key stabilizing feature of the alpha-helix is the regular pattern of hydrogen bonds that form between backbone atoms. The standard rule for this secondary structure is that the carbonyl group ($C=O$) of an amino acid residue, denoted as residue `i`, forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group ($N-H$) of the amino acid residue at position `i+4` along the chain.\n\nGiven this structural rule, if the carbonyl group of the 20th amino acid residue in the sequence is participating in a standard alpha-helical hydrogen bond, determine the residue number of the amino acid that provides the corresponding amino group for this bond.", "solution": "In a right-handed alpha-helix, the stabilizing hydrogen bond pattern is such that the carbonyl group of residue $i$ hydrogen bonds to the amide ($N-H$) of residue $i+4$.
