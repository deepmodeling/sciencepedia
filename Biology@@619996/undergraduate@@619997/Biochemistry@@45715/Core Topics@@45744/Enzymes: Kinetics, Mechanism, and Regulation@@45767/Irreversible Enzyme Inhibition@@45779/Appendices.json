Unlike reversible inhibitors, their effect is not simply to occupy the active site temporarily but to reduce the total concentration of functional enzyme. This first exercise provides a foundational understanding of this principle by asking you to directly calculate the remaining concentration of active enzyme after a defined percentage of inhibition, reinforcing the stoichiometric nature of this interaction [@problem_id:2054780].", "problem": "In a research laboratory, a biochemist is studying a novel enzyme, 'catalysine,' which is crucial for a specific metabolic pathway.
