At fixed $pH$, $[OH^{-}]$ is constant; thus $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ should be an affine linear function of $[AcO^{-}]$ with a constant intercept.\n\nWe now test these predictions against the data.\n\nFirst, compare runs 1 and 2, both at $pH$ equal to $5.00$. Under specific base catalysis, the prediction is\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1)=k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(2)=k_{\\mathrm{OH}}[OH^{-}]_{pH=5.00},\n$$\ni.e., $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ should be the same when $pH$ is the same.

From the given list, residues with $pK_a > 7.5$ are Cys ($8.3$), Tyr ($10.5$), and Lys ($10.5$), any of which could serve as the general acid. Residues with $pK_a  7.5$ are Asp ($3.9$), Glu ($4.1$), and His ($6.0$), any of which could serve as the general base. Among the options presented, the only dyad pairing one from each appropriate set that is chemically reasonable and listed is Cys/His, with Cys as the acid and His as the base.
