A detailed X-ray crystallography study reveals that the active site of lipoclastase is a deep, narrow cleft. The amino acid residues lining this cleft are predominantly those with nonpolar, aliphatic side chains, such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. There are no charged amino acid residues or metal cofactors present within the binding pocket.\n\nBased on this structural information, which of the following descriptions best characterizes the native substrate of lipoclastase?\n\nA. A small, water-soluble molecule featuring multiple hydroxyl groups.\n\nB. A large, aromatic molecule containing several charged phosphate groups.\n\nC. An unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chain with more than ten carbons.\n\nD. A large, globular protein with a varied surface of polar and nonpolar patches.\n\nE. An amphipathic molecule composed of a polar head and a short, nonpolar tail.", "solution": "We start from the structural features of the active site: it is a deep, narrow cleft lined predominantly with nonpolar, aliphatic side chains (valine, leucine, isoleucine) and contains no charged residues or metal cofactors. From protein-ligand interaction principles, such a pocket primarily stabilizes ligands via the hydrophobic effect and van der Waals interactions. The absence of charged residues and metal ions indicates minimal capacity for ionic interactions or metal coordination and a lack of strong hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors typical for engaging highly polar or charged substrates.\n\nA deep, narrow, hydrophobic cleft implies shape complementarity to an extended, largely linear, nonpolar moiety. Long, unbranched alkyl chains fit such clefts well, maximizing van der Waals contacts and hydrophobic surface burial. Saturation (no double bonds) promotes a linear geometry without kinks, improving packing in a narrow channel. The name \"lipoclastase\" also suggests lipid cleavage; lipases commonly bind long hydrocarbon acyl chains in hydrophobic channels.\n\nEvaluate the options against these criteria:\n- Option A (small, water-soluble, multiple hydroxyls): Multiple hydroxyl groups are polar and would require hydrogen-bonding partners; a hydrophobic, nonpolar-lined pocket lacks these, making this unlikely.\n- Option B (large, aromatic with charged phosphates): Charged phosphate groups require complementary positive charges or metal cofactors for strong binding, which are absent; bulky aromatics may also mismatch a narrow, linear cleft.\n- Option C (unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chain with more than ten carbons): Matches a deep, narrow, nonpolar cleft by maximizing hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions; typical of long-chain lipid substrates.\n- Option D (large, globular protein): A narrow cleft cannot accommodate a globular protein surface; proteolytic sites also often feature catalytic residues with polar/charged character, which are not observed here.\n- Option E (amphipathic with a polar head and short nonpolar tail): The polar headgroup would need polar or charged residues for binding; these are absent. A short tail would not effectively fill a deep cleft.\n\nTherefore, the native substrate is best characterized as a long, unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chain, consistent with option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2043630"}, {"introduction": "The same principles of molecular recognition that ensure substrate specificity can be exploited to design molecules that block enzyme activity. Many drugs function as enzyme inhibitors, binding to the active site and preventing the natural substrate from doing so. This problem explores competitive inhibition, where a molecule structurally similar to the substrate competes for the same binding site, and asks you to predict the consequences for the enzyme's kinetic behavior [@problem_id:2043565].", "problem": "Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is an enzyme that plays a role in repairing proteins that have been non-enzymatically glycated, a form of protein damage common in diabetes. The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the fructosamine adduct on a protein, using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) as a co-substrate. This phosphorylation destabilizes the adduct, leading to its removal.\n\nA research team designs a potential drug molecule, Compound-D, intended to modulate FN3K activity. Compound-D is structurally analogous to the fructosamine-modified portion of the protein substrate. It binds reversibly and with high affinity to the same active site on FN3K that the glycated protein would normally occupy. However, a key chemical modification was made in Compound-D: the hydroxyl group on the fructose ring that is the target for phosphorylation by FN3K has been replaced with a fluorine atom. This F-for-OH substitution prevents the phosphorylation reaction from occurring.\n\nBased on this mechanism, how would you classify the inhibition by Compound-D, and what would be the expected effect on the apparent Michaelis constant ($K_M$) and the maximum velocity ($V_{max}$) of the FN3K enzyme with respect to its glycated protein substrate?\n\nA.

In the active site, a positively charged lysine residue on the enzyme forms a salt bridge with a negatively charged carboxylate group on the substrate.

A research team decides to probe the importance of this interaction by performing site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the lysine residue with a glutamate residue. At physiological pH, this glutamate residue carries a negative charge.\n\nAssume the following simplified model:\n1. The charges on the original lysine, the substrate's carboxylate, and the new glutamate can all be modeled as point charges with magnitudes equal to the elementary charge, $e$.\n2.
