By analyzing the action of a hypothetical protease that recognizes a particular pattern of amino acids, you will practice distinguishing between different types of specificity, a core skill in understanding how enzymes achieve their remarkable selectivity in complex biological environments.", "problem": "A team of biochemists has isolated a novel protease, which they named Basiphilin, from an extremophilic bacterium. Their initial characterization reveals that Basiphilin's catalytic activity is highly selective. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond located C-terminal to a basic amino acid residue only if that residue is immediately followed by another basic amino acid residue. For the context of this problem, the set of basic amino acids consists of Arginine (Arg), Lysine (Lys), and Histidine (His). For example, in the sequence -Ala-Lys-Arg-Gly-, Basiphilin would cleave the peptide bond between Lys and Arg, but it would not cleave any other bonds.\n\nBased on this enzymatic action, which of the following statements correctly classifies the specificity of Basiphilin and identifies a dipeptide that would serve as a valid substrate for it?\n\nA. Absolute specificity; Substrate: Phenylalanyl-tyrosine (Phe-Tyr)\n\nB. Group specificity; Substrate: Lysyl-arginine (Lys-Arg)\n\nC. Linkage specificity; Substrate: Glycyl-lysine (Gly-Lys)\n\nD. Stereochemical specificity; Substrate: Aspartyl-glutamate (Asp-Glu)\n\nE. Group specificity; Substrate: Glycyl-lysine (Gly-Lys)", "solution": "The enzyme Basiphilin cleaves a peptide bond only when the bond is C-terminal to a basic residue that is immediately followed by another basic residue. In peptide notation, the bond between residue $i$ and residue $i+1$ is cleaved only if residue $i$ is basic and residue $i+1$ is also basic. The set of basic residues here is $\\{\\text{Arg}, \\text{Lys}, \\text{His}\\}$.\n\nClassification of specificity:\n- Absolute specificity would mean a single unique substrate, which is not the case since any peptide containing a basic-basic motif could be cleaved. Therefore, absolute specificity is incorrect.\n- Linkage specificity would mean the enzyme targets a particular bond type without regard to the surrounding groups. Basiphilin requires specific side-chain identities (basic residues) and their arrangement, so this is not linkage specificity.\n- Stereochemical specificity concerns recognition of one stereoisomer (e.g., L- vs D-), which is not the defining feature here.\n- Group specificity describes enzymes that act on substrates bearing a particular functional group or side-chain class. Basiphilin recognizes basic side chains in a specific arrangement (a dibasic motif), so group specificity is correct.\n\nAssessment of proposed dipeptide substrates:\n- Phe-Tyr: neither residue is basic; the only bond present is not C-terminal to a basic residue followed by a basic residue. Not a substrate.\n- Lys-Arg: the bond is between Lys (basic) and Arg (basic). This matches the requirement: residue $i=$ Lys is basic and residue $i+1=$ Arg is basic. Valid substrate.\n- Gly-Lys: the bond is between Gly (not basic) and Lys (basic). Since residue $i=$ Gly is not basic, the required condition fails. Not a substrate.\n- Asp-Glu: both acidic; not a substrate.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is group specificity, and a valid dipeptide substrate is Lys-Arg. The corresponding option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2044639"}, {"introduction": "An enzyme's function is intimately linked to its three-dimensional structure, particularly the precise geometry and chemical nature of its active site. This practice challenges you to think like a protein engineer and predict the functional consequences of altering an enzyme's active site through a single amino acid mutation [@problem_id:2044658]. By considering how a change in residue size affects shape complementarity and introduces steric hindrance, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the structural basis of substrate specificity and the principles of rational enzyme design.", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, Linear Acyl Thioesterase (LAT), catalyzes the hydrolysis of thioester bonds in linear fatty acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) molecules. Its active site contains a deep, narrow hydrophobic pocket that optimally accommodates a six-carbon acyl chain, resulting in maximum catalytic activity towards hexanoyl-CoA. Structural analysis reveals that a glycine residue, Gly-85, is located at the very bottom of this pocket. Its minimal side chain (a single hydrogen atom) is critical for allowing the terminal methyl group of the hexanoyl chain to fit.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant version of LAT by replacing Gly-85 with a tryptophan residue (Trp-85). Both glycine and tryptophan have nonpolar side chains. Based on the principles of enzyme structure and the induced-fit model of enzyme-substrate interaction, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the effect of this mutation on the substrate specificity of LAT?\n\nA. The mutant enzyme will have a significantly lower affinity for hexanoyl-CoA due to steric hindrance but may exhibit a new, weak specificity for much shorter acyl-CoA molecules.\n\nB. The mutant enzyme will now preferentially bind aromatic substrates that can engage in $\\pi$-stacking interactions with the new tryptophan residue.\n\nC. The substrate specificity will remain unchanged because both glycine and tryptophan are nonpolar amino acids, thus preserving the hydrophobic nature of the active site pocket.\n\nD. The enzyme will bind hexanoyl-CoA with a much higher affinity because the larger tryptophan side chain provides more extensive van der Waals interactions with the substrate's hydrocarbon tail.", "solution": "We begin from the principle of shape complementarity and steric fit in enzyme active sites. The LAT active site is described as a deep, narrow hydrophobic pocket optimized for a six-carbon acyl chain; the key structural feature is Gly-85 at the pocket bottom, whose minimal side chain allows the terminal methyl group of hexanoyl-CoA to occupy the deepest point without steric clash. This confers maximal catalytic efficiency for hexanoyl-CoA via optimal van der Waals packing and minimal steric repulsion.\n\nUpon mutation Gly-85 to Trp-85, the side-chain volume at the bottom of the pocket increases substantially. Let the original effective pocket depth be $L$, and let the indole ring of tryptophan reduce the accessible depth to $L-\\Delta L$ with $\\Delta L>0$. For a linear acyl chain of length $n$ carbons optimally accommodated when its length matches $L$, the new geometry prevents the $n=6$ chain from reaching its previous low-energy configuration: the terminal methyl would encounter steric overlap with the bulky indole side chain. This produces an unfavorable steric repulsion that raises the enthalpic component of the binding free energy.\n\nFormally, the binding free energy satisfies\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}=\\Delta H - T\\Delta S,\n$$\nand the dissociation constant is\n$$\nK_{d}=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}}{RT}\\right).\n$$\nThe G85W substitution introduces steric hindrance, increasing $\\Delta H$ (more positive due to repulsion and loss of favorable van der Waals contact at the pocket bottom) and potentially incurring additional conformational strain under induced fit, which further increases $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$. Consequently, $K_{d}$ increases and the affinity for hexanoyl-CoA decreases. Because catalytic efficiency depends on both binding and chemistry, a strong decrease in binding for the native substrate typically increases $K_{m}$ and reduces $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{m}$.\n\nRegarding substrate specificity, reducing the effective pocket depth by $\\Delta L$ shifts the optimal chain length to a shorter value $n^{\\ast}<6$ that fits without colliding with Trp-85. Shorter acyl-CoA substrates (e.g., with fewer carbons) could now avoid steric conflict at the pocket bottom and achieve some hydrophobic contacts along the pocket walls. However, because the original pocket shape and hydrophobic distribution were tuned for $n=6$, the new complementarity for much shorter chains will generally be weaker than the original optimal case, yielding at best a new, weak specificity.\n\nAlternative hypotheses can be rejected as follows:\n- The presence of tryptophan does not imply preferential binding to aromatic substrates in this pocket, since the site is deep and narrow, designed for linear aliphatic chains; moreover, the physiological substrates are acyl-CoAs lacking aromatic rings, so new dominant $\\pi$-stacking is not a realistic determinant in this context.\n- Nonpolarity alone does not preserve specificity: side-chain size and geometry are crucial. Glycine versus tryptophan represents a dramatic steric change, so substrate specificity cannot remain unchanged simply because both are nonpolar.\n- The idea that a larger tryptophan would increase van der Waals contacts and thus affinity ignores the dominant steric clash at the pocket bottom; induced fit cannot eliminate hard steric overlap in a rigid, narrow cavity, so affinity for hexanoyl-CoA will decrease rather than increase.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that hexanoyl-CoA binding will be strongly reduced by steric hindrance, with a possible shift toward weak binding of shorter acyl-CoA substrates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2044658"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative descriptions, biochemists need to quantify an enzyme's preference for different substrates, especially when those substrates compete for the same active site.
