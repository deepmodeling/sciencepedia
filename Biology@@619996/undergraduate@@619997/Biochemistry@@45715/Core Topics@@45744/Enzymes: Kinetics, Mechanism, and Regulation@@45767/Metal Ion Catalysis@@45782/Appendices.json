This first practice problem explores a foundational method used in biochemistry to identify metalloenzymes. By observing the effect of a specific chemical agent, a strong metal chelator, you will deduce the fundamental role of the metal ion in the enzyme carboxypeptidase A, reinforcing the concept of holoenzymes and apoenzymes. [@problem_id:2058281]", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of carboxypeptidase A, an enzyme that hydrolyzes C-terminal peptide bonds. The enzyme is assayed in a buffered solution and demonstrates high catalytic activity. Subsequently, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a compound known to be a strong chelating agent, is introduced into the reaction mixture. Upon the addition of EDTA, the activity of carboxypeptidase A is observed to be completely abolished. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. EDTA acts as a competitive inhibitor, as its molecular structure mimics the C-terminal end of a polypeptide chain, allowing it to bind to the enzyme's active site and block substrate access.\n\nB. EDTA functions as an allosteric inhibitor by binding to a regulatory site distinct from the active site, inducing a conformational change that renders the enzyme inactive.\n\nC. Carboxypeptidase A is a metalloenzyme that requires a specific metal ion cofactor to be bound within its active site for catalytic function. EDTA sequesters this essential ion, forming an inactive apoenzyme.\n\nD. EDTA causes irreversible denaturation of the enzyme by disrupting the hydrophobic core and breaking the disulfide bridges responsible for maintaining its tertiary structure.\n\nE. EDTA acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor by binding exclusively to the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex, trapping the substrate in the active site and preventing the release of products.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biochemical principles:\n1) Carboxypeptidase A is a metalloenzyme whose catalytic mechanism requires a bound divalent metal ion cofactor, specifically $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, coordinated in the active site. The holoenzyme is catalytically competent only when the metal is present.\n2) EDTA is a strong hexadentate chelator with very high affinity for many divalent metal ions, including $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. When added to solution, EDTA binds free $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ and can extract it from weaker complexes, thereby depleting the metal from metalloenzymes.\n\nFormalizing the cofactor dependence and chelation:\n- The active holoenzyme is $E_{\\mathrm{Zn}}$ and the inactive apoenzyme is $E_{\\mathrm{apo}}$. The metal-binding equilibrium is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{apo}} + \\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons E_{\\mathrm{Zn}}, \\quad K_{d,E}=\\frac{[E_{\\mathrm{apo}}][\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}]}{[E_{\\mathrm{Zn}}]}.\n$$\n- EDTA (denote it $L$) binds $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$:\n$$\nL + \\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons L\\mathrm{:Zn}, \\quad K_{d,L}=\\frac{[L][\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}]}{[L\\mathrm{:Zn}]},\n$$\nwith $K_{d,L} \\ll K_{d,E}$ (EDTA has much higher affinity for $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ than the enzyme does). Thus, addition of EDTA drives $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ into $L\\mathrm{:Zn}$, lowering $[\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}]$ and pulling the first equilibrium to the left, converting $E_{\\mathrm{Zn}}$ to $E_{\\mathrm{apo}}$.\n\nConsequences for catalysis:\n- The catalytic rate for a metalloenzyme that requires the metal is proportional to the concentration of holoenzyme. Using Michaelis–Menten form,\n$$\nv=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[E_{\\mathrm{Zn}}][S]}{K_{M}+[S]}.\n$$\n- Sequestration of $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ by EDTA makes $[E_{\\mathrm{Zn}}] \\to 0$, therefore $v \\to 0$, i.e., complete loss of activity. This explains the observation most fundamentally as removal of an essential cofactor.\n\nWhy the other options are inconsistent:\n- Competitive inhibition (A) would yield\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{\\alpha K_{M}+[S]}, \\quad \\alpha=1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}},\n$$\nwith $V_{\\max}$ unchanged; high $[S]$ can restore activity. The observation of complete abolition, together with EDTA’s known mechanism, contradicts simple competitive inhibition and EDTA does not mimic the C-terminus.\n- Allosteric inhibition (B) posits binding at a distinct regulatory site; EDTA is a general metal chelator, not a specific allosteric effector of carboxypeptidase A.\n- Irreversible denaturation (D) would require disruption of the protein’s tertiary structure (e.g., hydrophobic collapse or disulfide reduction). EDTA does not reduce disulfides nor directly disrupt the hydrophobic core; its primary action is metal chelation.\n- Uncompetitive inhibition (E) requires selective binding to the $ES$ complex, lowering both $V_{\\max}$ and $K_M$; EDTA’s known chemistry does not target the $ES$ complex but the essential metal cofactor.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that carboxypeptidase A is a $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$-dependent metalloenzyme and EDTA removes this essential cofactor, yielding an inactive apoenzyme.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2058281"}, {"introduction": "Building on the knowledge that specific metal ions are crucial, we now explore the chemical principles governing their binding.

In Zymase-B, the $Zn^{2+}$ ion is coordinated by the side chains of three Histidine (His) residues and one Aspartate (Asp) residue.\n\nBoth enzymes are studied in an aqueous buffer that becomes contaminated with mercury(II) ions ($Hg^{2+}$). The inhibitory effect of heavy metals like mercury often stems from their ability to displace the native metal cofactor, leading to enzyme inactivation.\n\nFor your analysis, use the following information regarding the relevant chemical species:\n-   **Metal Cations (Lewis Acids)**: $Hg^{2+}$ is a large cation with low charge density and high polarizability. $Zn^{2+}$ is a smaller cation with higher charge density and is considered borderline in its properties.\n-   **Coordinating Ligands (Lewis Bases)**:\n    -   The Cysteine side chain coordinates via its sulfur atom, which is large and highly polarizable.\n    -   The Histidine side chain coordinates via an imidazole nitrogen atom, which exhibits intermediate polarizability.\n    -   The Aspartate side chain coordinates via a carboxylate oxygen atom, which is small, highly electronegative, and has very low polarizability.\n\nBased on the principles of coordination chemistry, which of the following statements most accurately predicts and justifies the relative susceptibility of the two enzymes to inhibition by $Hg^{2+}$?\n\nA.

Zymase-B will be more strongly inhibited because its oxygen-containing active site is a \"hard\" ligand environment that preferentially binds larger cations like $Hg^{2+}$ over smaller ones like $Zn^{2+}$.\n\nC. Zymase-A will be more strongly inhibited because the total negative charge from the three deprotonated Cys residues creates a stronger electrostatic attraction for $Hg^{2+}$ than the active site of Zymase-B.\n\nD. Zymase-B will be more strongly inhibited because the three nitrogen ligands from Histidine create a stronger field for the d-orbitals of $Hg^{2+}$, leading to greater ligand field stabilization energy.\n\nE.

Size alone does not govern preference; HSAB softness/hardness does.\n- Option C is incorrect: total negative charge is not the primary determinant; HSAB matching dominates. Moreover, His donors are neutral, and Asp is anionic; differences in net charge do not override the strong soft-soft preference of $Hg^{2+}$ for sulfur.\n- Option D is incorrect: $Hg^{2+}$ is $d^{10}$, so ligand field stabilization energy is negligible; ligand field strength does not provide the driving force here.\n- Option E is incorrect: identical formal charge does not control selectivity; HSAB character and polarizability are the key factors.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction and justification is that Zymase-A is more strongly inhibited due to its soft, sulfur-rich ligand environment having higher affinity for the soft acid $Hg^{2+}$ than for borderline $Zn^{2+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2058259"}, {"introduction": "The protein environment does more than just bind the metal; it precisely tunes its chemical properties to optimize catalysis.
