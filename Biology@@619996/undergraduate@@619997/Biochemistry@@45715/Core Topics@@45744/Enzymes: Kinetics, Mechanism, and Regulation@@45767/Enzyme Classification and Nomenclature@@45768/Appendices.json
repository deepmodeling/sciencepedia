The enzyme under study catalyzes the reversible stereospecific addition of a water molecule to the carbon-carbon double bond of (2*E*)-but-2-enedioate, yielding (2*S*)-2-hydroxybutanedioate as the product. To properly document this enzyme, it must be classified according to the primary classes established by the Enzyme Commission (EC). The six main EC classes are listed below for reference:\n\n*   **EC 1: Oxidoreductases:** Catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions.\n*   **EC 2: Transferases:** Transfer functional groups from one molecule to another.\n*   **EC 3: Hydrolases:** Catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical bonds (cleavage of a bond by the addition of water).\n*   **EC 4: Lyases:** Cleave C-C, C-O, C-N, and other bonds by elimination, leaving double bonds, or conversely add groups to double bonds.\n*   **EC 5: Isomerases:** Catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule.\n*   **EC 6: Ligases:** Join two molecules with covalent bonds, coupled with the hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond in ATP or another nucleotide.\n\nBased on the reaction described, which of the following primary EC classes does this enzyme belong to?\n\nA.

This corresponds to the hydration of fumarate to L-malate (and its reverse, dehydration).\n\nAccording to the Enzyme Commission classification:\n- Hydrolases (EC 3) catalyze hydrolysis, which is cleavage of a single bond by addition of water; the hallmark is bond scission rather than addition across a double bond.\n- Lyases (EC 4) catalyze the addition of groups to double bonds or the elimination of groups to form double bonds. Hydratases, which add water across a double bond (or remove it to generate a double bond), are a subclass of lyases (specifically hydro-lyases, EC 4.2.1.x).\n\nSince the described reaction is an addition of water across a $C=C$ bond (and is reversible to an elimination), it matches the definition of a lyase rather than a hydrolase. Therefore, the enzyme belongs to EC 4 (Lyases).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2043912"}, {"introduction": "Beyond assigning a broad class number, biochemists need a precise and unambiguous way to name enzymes.
