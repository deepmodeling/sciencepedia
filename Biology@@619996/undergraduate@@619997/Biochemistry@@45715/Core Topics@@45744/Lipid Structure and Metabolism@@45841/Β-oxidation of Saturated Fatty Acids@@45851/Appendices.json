Let the initial carbon number be $n$. After $k$ cycles, the remaining acyl chain length is\n$$\nn-2k.\n$$\nThe process terminates when the remaining chain is $C_2$ (an acetyl-CoA), so we set\n$$\nn-2k=2 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad k=\\frac{n}{2}-1.\n$$\nFor arachidic acid, $n=20$, hence\n$$\nk=\\frac{20}{2}-1=10-1=9.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of complete $\\beta$-oxidation cycles required is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "2088040"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting cycles, it is vital to understand the directionality of the β-oxidation spiral. This problem presents a thought experiment simulating a classic biochemical technique, isotopic labeling, to help you visualize the sequential cleavage of a fatty acid chain. By tracing a labeled carbon atom from one end of the molecule to its final destination, you will gain a concrete understanding of how the molecule is dismantled piece by piece [@problem_id:2088023].", "problem": "In a metabolic tracer study, a biochemist synthesizes a special batch of palmitic acid, a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid ($C_{16}H_{32}O_2$). In this batch, the terminal methyl carbon (the ω-carbon, which is the carbon furthest from the carboxyl group) of every palmitic acid molecule is isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}C$). This labeled fatty acid is then provided to a suspension of isolated liver mitochondria, which completely catabolize it via the β-oxidation pathway into molecules of acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA).\n\nAssuming the β-oxidation pathway proceeds to completion, which of the resulting acetyl-CoA molecules will contain the $^{14}C$ label?\n\nA. The first acetyl-CoA molecule produced.\n\nB. All eight of the acetyl-CoA molecules produced.\n\nC. The fourth acetyl-CoA molecule produced.\n\nD. The eighth and final acetyl-CoA molecule produced.\n\nE.

The isotope label $^{14}C$ is placed at $C_{16}$.\n\nPrinciple of the pathway: In each cycle of $\\beta$-oxidation, the fatty acyl-CoA undergoes dehydrogenation, hydration, a second dehydrogenation, and thiolytic cleavage. The thiolysis step removes one acetyl-CoA composed of the two carbons at the carboxyl end of the current acyl chain, and shortens the remaining acyl-CoA by two carbons from the carboxyl end. Therefore, the $k$-th acetyl-CoA released consists of the pair of carbons that were originally at positions $C_{2k-1}$ and $C_{2k}$ in the starting fatty acid.\n\nApplying this mapping to palmitate ($C_1$ to $C_{16}$), the sequence of acetyl-CoA units produced is:\n$$(C_1,C_2),\\ (C_3,C_4),\\ (C_5,C_6),\\ (C_7,C_8),\\ (C_9,C_{10}),\\ (C_{11},C_{12}),\\ (C_{13},C_{14}),\\ (C_{15},C_{16}).$$\nThe labeled carbon is $C_{16}$, which appears in the pair $(C_{15},C_{16})$. To find which cycle this corresponds to, set $2k=16$, giving $k=8$. Thus, the $8$-th (and final) acetyl-CoA contains the $^{14}C$ label.\n\nNo $CO_2$ is produced during $\\beta$-oxidation itself; decarboxylation to $CO_2$ occurs in the tricarboxylic acid cycle after acetyl-CoA entry, so the label is not lost as $^{14}CO_2$ during the $\\beta$-oxidation cycles.\n\nTherefore, the labeled carbon appears in the eighth and final acetyl-CoA molecule produced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2088023"}, {"introduction": "Fatty acids are the body's most energy-dense fuel source, and this capstone practice challenges you to quantify that energy.
