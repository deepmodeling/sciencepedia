Fatty acids are often described using a shorthand notation `C:D`, where `C` is the total number of carbon atoms and `D` is the number of double bonds. The positions of these double bonds are specified using either delta ($\\Delta$) or omega ($\\omega$) notation.\n\nIn delta ($\\Delta$) notation, carbons are numbered starting from the carboxyl group (C1). The notation $\\Delta^{x,y,...}$ indicates that double bonds begin at carbons `x`, `y`, etc.\n\nIn omega ($\\omega$) notation, carbons are numbered starting from the methyl group at the opposite end of the chain (the $\\omega$-carbon). The notation $\\omega$-$n$ indicates that the first double bond from the methyl end starts at the $n$-th carbon.\n\nFor most naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA, the double bonds are non-conjugated, meaning they are separated by a single methylene ($-CH_2-$) group. This results in a repeating `–CH=CH–CH₂–CH=CH–` pattern.\n\nGiven that the omega notation for DHA is 22:6($\\omega$-3), determine its correct representation in delta ($\\Delta$) notation.\n\nA. $\\Delta^{3,6,9,12,15,18}$\n\nB. $\\Delta^{4,7,10,13,16,19}$\n\nC. $\\Delta^{5,8,11,14,17,20}$\n\nD. $\\Delta^{9,11,13,15,17,19}$\n\nE. $\\Delta^{20,17,14,11,8,5}$", "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of carbon atoms and $D$ be the number of double bonds.

This means the first double bond, counting from the methyl ($\\omega$) end of the chain, starts at the 3rd carbon.\n\nBecause the double bonds are methylene-interrupted, we can find the position of the double bond that is closest to the methyl group. For an $N$-carbon $\\omega$-$k$ fatty acid, the double bond closest to the methyl group starts at the $\\Delta$ position $N-k$.\nFor DHA, which is a 22-carbon, $\\omega$-3 acid, this highest-numbered $\\Delta$ position is:\n$$ p_{\\Delta, \\text{max}} = 22 - 3 = 19 $$\nThis means the double bond closest to the methyl end is at $\\Delta^{19}$ (i.e., between C-19 and C-20).\n\nSince there are $D=6$ double bonds and they are methylene-interrupted, their positions are separated by 3 carbons.

This exercise challenges you to apply core principles of molecular interactions to predict the properties of a novel, hypothetical fatty acid. By comparing its structure to common saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, you will develop a deeper intuition for how molecular shape governs the macroscopic properties of lipids [@problem_id:2053187].", "problem": "In the field of exobiology, scientists are studying a newly discovered extremophilic bacterium that thrives in low-temperature, high-pressure environments. A key adaptation appears to be the composition of its cell membrane lipids. While terrestrial organisms commonly use saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, this alien bacterium synthesizes an unusual 18-carbon fatty acid, which we will call \"exocyclo-octadecanoic acid\". This molecule contains a cyclopropane ring that bridges carbons 9 and 10 of the acyl chain. All other bonds in the chain are single bonds.\n\nTo understand the physical properties of this novel fatty acid, compare its melting point ($T_{m,C}$) to that of two common terrestrial 18-carbon fatty acids:\n1.  Stearic acid ($T_{m,S}$): A saturated fatty acid (18:0).\n2.

Tighter, more linear packing enhances van der Waals dispersion interactions, stabilizing the solid (gel) phase and raising the melting temperature. Structural features that introduce kinks, steric bulk, or reduce conformational compatibility between neighboring chains disrupt packing and lower the melting point.\n\n1) For stearic acid (18:0), all carbon–carbon bonds along the acyl chain are single bonds, allowing rotation that enables an all-trans, nearly linear conformation. This maximizes lateral contact area and intermolecular dispersion interactions. Therefore stearic acid exhibits the most efficient packing and the highest melting point, so $T_{m,S}$ is the largest among the three.\n\n2) For oleic acid (18:1, *cis*-$\\Delta^9$), the *cis* double bond between carbons 9 and 10 introduces a fixed bend in the chain and eliminates rotational freedom at that position. The kink disrupts alignment and reduces close packing with neighboring chains, decreasing dispersion interactions. Consequently, oleic acid has the poorest packing and the lowest melting point, so $T_{m,U}$ is the smallest among the three.\n\n3) For exocyclo-octadecanoic acid with a cyclopropane ring bridging carbons 9 and 10, the local structure is saturated in terms of bond types (no double bond), but the three-membered ring introduces ring strain and rigidity with a modest deviation from perfect linearity. Compared to a *cis* double bond, the cyclopropane ring generally causes a less severe kink and allows the upstream and downstream chain segments to remain more nearly colinear, improving packing relative to the *cis*-unsaturated chain. However, the ring still perturbs ideal linear packing and reduces conformational adaptability compared to a fully saturated chain. Therefore, its melting point is expected to be intermediate between stearic acid and oleic acid.\n\nPutting these together, the ranking of melting points is\n$$\nT_{m,S} \\;>\\; T_{m,C} \\;>\\; T_{m,U}.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053187"}]}
