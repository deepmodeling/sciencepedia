This exercise challenges you to predict the consequences of a seemingly small chemical modification—replacing the hydroxyl head group with a carboxyl group.

One such molecule is a derivative of cholesterol, tentatively named \"cholesteroic acid,\" in which the polar 3-beta-hydroxyl group (-OH) at the C3 position of the steroid nucleus has been replaced by a carboxyl group (-COOH). Consider the behavior of this molecule when it is introduced to a typical animal cell plasma membrane, which is in an aqueous environment at a physiological pH of 7.4. The pKa of the carboxyl group is approximately 4.5.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected orientation and location of a single cholesteroic acid molecule within the plasma membrane?\n\nA. It will insert into the membrane with an orientation identical to that of a normal cholesterol molecule, as the large hydrophobic steroid nucleus is the primary determinant of orientation.\n\nB. It will orient with its carboxylate head group in the aqueous phase, but the steroid nucleus will be positioned more superficially (less deeply embedded) within the hydrophobic core compared to cholesterol.\n\nC. It will completely flip its orientation relative to cholesterol, burying the negatively charged carboxylate group deep within the hydrophobic core of the membrane.\n\nD. It will lie flat in the exact center of the bilayer (the midplane), positioning itself parallel to the membrane surface to shield its polar group from both aqueous phases.\n\nE. It will not incorporate into the membrane at all, as the strong negative charge of the carboxylate group will cause electrostatic repulsion from the phospholipid head groups.", "solution": "We analyze the ionization state of the modified head group using the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship and then determine the thermodynamically favored membrane orientation by comparing solvation energetics of charged versus neutral groups in aqueous and hydrophobic environments, together with the amphipathic partitioning principle for sterol-like molecules.\n\n1) Ionization state at physiological pH:\nFor a weak acid with acid form HA (carboxylic acid) and base form A^{-} (carboxylate), the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} \\right).\n$$\nRearranging gives the ratio of deprotonated to protonated forms:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}.\n$$\nThe fraction deprotonated is\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HA}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}}}.\n$$\nAt a physiological pH greater than the carboxyl group’s $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}$ is close to one, so the head group is predominantly negatively charged (carboxylate) under the stated conditions.\n\n2) Energetic cost of burying a charge in the membrane core:\nThe hydrophobic core of the bilayer has a low dielectric constant $\\epsilon_{m}$ compared with water with dielectric constant $\\epsilon_{w}$. The Born solvation penalty for placing a monovalent charge of effective radius $r$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ relative to vacuum can be expressed as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{Born}} \\approx \\frac{q^{2}}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right),\n$$\nand the transfer from water to membrane core carries an unfavorable change\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}} \\approx \\frac{q^{2}}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{m}} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{w}} \\right),\n$$\nwhich is large and positive because $\\epsilon_{m} \\ll \\epsilon_{w}$. Therefore, a negatively charged carboxylate strongly prefers remaining in the aqueous phase or at the interface rather than being buried in the hydrophobic core.\n\n3) Amphipathic partitioning and sterol orientation:\nCholesterol normally orients with its small polar 3-beta-hydroxyl group at the membrane interface (interacting with the aqueous phase and lipid headgroups) and its rigid hydrophobic steroid nucleus embedded within the hydrophobic core. Replacing the hydroxyl group with a carboxylate increases polarity and introduces a full negative charge under the given conditions, which strengthens the preference of the head group for the aqueous phase and for interfacial hydration. Because the carboxylate has stronger hydration and a larger effective polar footprint than an alcohol, maintaining extensive aqueous exposure of the head group pulls the sterol nucleus toward a more superficial position relative to native cholesterol. This minimizes the unfavorable electrostatic and desolvation penalties while still allowing the large hydrophobic nucleus to partition into the bilayer.\n\n4) Evaluation of the options:\n- A: Incorrect. Head group chemistry is a dominant determinant of interfacial depth; the charged carboxylate will not allow an insertion depth identical to cholesterol’s hydroxyl.\n- B: Correct. The carboxylate remains in the aqueous phase, and the strengthened interfacial anchoring shifts the steroid nucleus to a more superficial position compared to cholesterol.\n- C: Incorrect. Burying a negatively charged group in the hydrophobic core is strongly unfavorable as indicated by $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$ above.\n- D: Incorrect. Lying flat at the bilayer midplane would bury the charged group in a very low dielectric environment, which is highly unfavorable.\n- E: Incorrect. The molecule is amphipathic; despite its charge, it can incorporate at the interface with the head group solvated by water rather than be excluded entirely.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the carboxylate head group remains in the aqueous phase, and the steroid nucleus is more superficial than in cholesterol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2034592"}, {"introduction": "Cholesterol is famously known as a membrane 'fluidity buffer'. This practice focuses on one half of that role: preventing membranes from becoming too rigid at low temperatures. You will analyze a hypothetical Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment to see how cholesterol disrupts the ordered, gel-like state of saturated phospholipids, thereby maintaining essential lateral mobility in the cold [@problem_id:2034529].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating membrane dynamics using two different preparations of synthetic vesicles, called liposomes.\n\n- **Liposome A** is composed purely of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), a saturated phospholipid.

Liposome B will exhibit a faster fluorescence recovery rate because cholesterol disrupts the tight, ordered packing of the saturated phospholipid tails below the phase transition temperature.\n\nC.

Liposome B will exhibit a faster fluorescence recovery rate because cholesterol molecules actively transport the fluorescent lipids into the bleached area.", "solution": "Define the experimental variable and the physical quantity measured. In a FRAP experiment, the post-bleach fluorescence recovery is governed by lateral diffusion of fluorescent lipids in the membrane. The characteristic recovery time obeys the diffusion relation\n$$\n\\tau \\propto \\frac{w^{2}}{D},\n$$\nwhere $w$ is a characteristic bleach radius and $D$ is the lateral diffusion coefficient of the lipids. Thus, a faster recovery corresponds to a larger $D$ (more fluid membrane), and a slower recovery corresponds to a smaller $D$ (more rigid, ordered membrane).\n\nState the thermodynamic condition for DPPC. Pure DPPC exhibits a cooperative phase transition at its melting temperature $T_{m}$. For $T<T_{m}$, a DPPC bilayer resides in the solid-ordered gel phase with tightly packed, extended acyl chains stabilized by van der Waals interactions; in this state, lateral diffusion is strongly suppressed, so\n$$\nT<T_{m} \\implies D_{\\text{DPPC, pure}} \\text{ is small} \\quad (\\text{gel phase}).\n$$\n\nState cholesterol’s bidirectional buffering effect on membrane order. Cholesterol disrupts phase behavior by inserting its rigid sterol ring between acyl chains.

This problem asks you to interpret the results of a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiment, a powerful technique for studying phase transitions. By comparing a pure phospholipid membrane to one containing cholesterol, you will visualize how cholesterol eliminates the sharp melting transition, creating a stable 'liquid-ordered' state that resists both freezing and excessive fluidity [@problem_id:2034550].", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the physical properties of biological membranes using a technique called Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC measures the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and a reference. A phase transition in the sample, such as the melting of a lipid bilayer from a gel phase to a liquid-crystalline phase, appears as an endothermic peak in the resulting thermogram (a plot of excess heat capacity versus temperature). The temperature at the peak's maximum is the phase transition temperature, $T_m$, and the area under the peak corresponds to the enthalpy of the transition, $\\Delta H$.\n\nThe biochemist prepares two different samples of artificial membranes called liposomes:\n- **Sample 1:** Liposomes composed of pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Pure DPPC is known to have a sharp, well-defined main phase transition at a $T_m$ of 41 °C.\n- **Sample 2:** Liposomes composed of 75 mol% DPPC and 25 mol% cholesterol.\n\nBoth samples are analyzed using DSC. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the difference in the DSC thermogram for Sample 2 compared to the thermogram for Sample 1?\n\nA. The sharp transition peak at 41 °C will be shifted to a much higher temperature (e.g., ~60 °C) but will retain its sharpness and have a larger transition enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).\n\nB. The sharp transition peak at 41 °C will be shifted to a much lower temperature (e.g., ~20 °C) but will retain its sharpness and have a similar transition enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).\n\nC. The thermogram will be nearly identical to that of pure DPPC, as cholesterol is a minor component and does not significantly interact with the phospholipid acyl chains.\n\nD. The sharp transition peak observed at 41 °C for pure DPPC will be significantly broadened and may even disappear entirely, being replaced by a very gradual change in heat capacity over a wide temperature range with a much lower total transition enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).", "solution": "Differential scanning calorimetry reports the excess heat capacity as a function of temperature, and the enthalpy of a transition equals the area under the excess heat capacity peak. Formally,\n$$\n\\Delta H=\\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} C_{p}^{ex}(T)\\, dT,\n$$\nand the apparent transition temperature is the peak maximum, conventionally denoted $T_{m}$ for a cooperative transition.\n\nFor pure DPPC, the main chain-melting transition is highly cooperative and first-order-like, giving a narrow, high-amplitude peak at $T_{m}$ with a relatively large $\\Delta H$. High cooperativity can be described by a large cooperative unit size $n$; in such cases, the peak is sharp and tall. When cooperativity decreases (smaller $n$), the peak broadens and its amplitude decreases, spreading the enthalpy over a wider temperature interval.\n\nCholesterol strongly perturbs phospholipid phase behavior by two complementary effects: it disrupts tight acyl-chain packing in the gel phase and orders the liquid-crystalline phase (the condensing effect), thereby reducing the enthalpy and entropy differences between these phases. Consequently:\n- The difference in thermodynamic state between gel and liquid phases is diminished, which lowers the calorimetric transition enthalpy $\\Delta H$ (the integrand $C_{p}^{ex}(T)$ is reduced and spread out).\n- The transition becomes much less cooperative (effective $n$ decreases), so the sharp peak broadens substantially. At sufficiently high cholesterol mole fractions (on the order of 0.25), the main transition can be abolished altogether, replaced by a liquid-ordered state without a sharp, singular $T_{m}$. In DSC this manifests as a very gradual change in baseline heat capacity over a broad temperature range rather than a distinct peak.\n\nTherefore, relative to pure DPPC (sharp peak near 41 degrees C with large area), a DPPC membrane containing 0.25 mole fraction cholesterol will not retain a sharp peak shifted to much higher or lower temperature, nor will it appear nearly identical. Instead, it will show a markedly broadened or absent main transition with a reduced total $\\Delta H$, consistent with a continuous, distributed reorganization rather than a cooperative, first-order-like melting.\n\nAmong the options, only the statement describing a significantly broadened peak that may disappear, with a gradual $C_{p}$ change over a wide temperature range and a much lower $\\Delta H$, matches these thermodynamic and molecular-interaction principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2034550"}]}
