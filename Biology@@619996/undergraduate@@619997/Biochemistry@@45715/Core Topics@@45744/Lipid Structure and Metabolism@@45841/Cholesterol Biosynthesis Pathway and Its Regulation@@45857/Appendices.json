This complex synthesis process begins with the simple two-carbon precursor, Acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The overall pathway can be summarized by a few key stoichiometric transformations.\n\n1.  The synthesis of one molecule of the C6 intermediate, mevalonate, consumes 3 molecules of acetyl-CoA and requires the reducing power of 2 molecules of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH).\n2.  The conversion of one molecule of mevalonate into one molecule of a C5 activated isoprene unit (the fundamental building block) requires the investment of 3 molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n3.  These C5 units are sequentially condensed to form larger intermediates. The final step involves the head-to-head condensation of two C15 farnesyl pyrophosphate molecules to yield one molecule of squalene.

The enolate of $C$ adds to the ketone carbonyl acac-3, yielding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) with the following carbon origin assignment, consistent with retention of the thioester and formation of a tertiary alcohol at the former ketone carbon:\n- HMG-CoA thioester carbonyl (h5) $=$ acac-1 $=$ $A_{c}$ (labeled),\n- Adjacent methylene (h4) $=$ acac-2 $=$ $A_{m}$,\n- Tertiary carbon bearing OH and a methyl (h3) $=$ acac-3 $=$ $B_{c}$ (labeled),\n- The methyl substituent on h3 $=$ acac-4 $=$ $B_{m}$,\n- The methylene on the distal side (h2) $=$ $C_{m}$,\n- The distal carboxylate carbon (h1) $=$ $C_{c}$ (labeled).\nTherefore HMG-CoA has labels at h5 ($A_{c}$), h3 ($B_{c}$), and h1 ($C_{c}$).\n\nStep 3 (HMG-CoA reductase): Reduction of the thioester to the primary alcohol produces mevalonate, $\\text{HOOC-CH}_2\\text{-C(OH)(CH}_3\\text{)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$, with direct correspondence:\n- Mevalonate C5 (CH$_{2}$OH) $\\leftarrow$ HMG h5 $=$ $A_{c}$ (labeled),\n- Mevalonate C4 $\\leftarrow$ HMG h4 $=$ $A_{m}$,\n- Mevalonate C3 (tertiary C) $\\leftarrow$ HMG h3 $=$ $B_{c}$ (labeled),\n- Mevalonate C2 $\\leftarrow$ HMG h2 $=$ $C_{m}$,\n- Mevalonate C1 (carboxyl) $\\leftarrow$ HMG h1 $=$ $C_{c}$ (labeled).\nThus mevalonate carries labels at C1, C3, and C5.\n\nStep 4 (Phosphorylation and decarboxylation to IPP): Mevalonate is phosphorylated at C5 and then decarboxylated to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), losing the mevalonate C1 as $\\text{CO}_2$.

This problem presents a hypothetical genetic knockout scenario to test your understanding of the elegant SREBP-SCAP-INSIG system that governs cholesterol levels. By predicting the outcome in this engineered cell line [@problem_id:2034324], you will gain insight into how molecular-level interactions create robust negative feedback loops that are crucial for cellular health.", "problem": "In mammalian cells, the synthesis of cholesterol is tightly regulated by a sophisticated negative feedback system involving proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The key players are the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP), the SREBP Cleavage-Activating Protein (SCAP), and the Insulin-Induced Gene (INSIG) protein. SREBP is a transcription factor that, when activated, increases the expression of genes required for cholesterol synthesis, including the gene for HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway.\n\nUnder normal conditions with low cellular sterol levels, SCAP escorts SREBP from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, SREBP is proteolytically cleaved, releasing its active domain which then travels to the nucleus to activate gene transcription, thus increasing cholesterol synthesis.\n\nConversely, when cellular sterol levels are high, sterols bind to SCAP, inducing a conformational change that allows the SCAP-SREBP complex to bind to the INSIG protein. This binding causes the entire SCAP-SREBP-INSIG complex to be retained in the ER, preventing SREBP's transport to the Golgi and subsequent activation. This leads to a down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a line of liver cells is genetically engineered to completely lack functional INSIG protein. These cells are then cultured in a medium containing a very high concentration of cholesterol. How will the rate of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in these INSIG-deficient cells respond to the high external cholesterol environment?\n\nA. The rate of synthesis will decrease significantly, as is typical in wild-type cells.\n\nB. The rate of synthesis will increase even further above its basal level.\n\nC. The rate of synthesis will be largely unaffected and remain constitutively high.\n\nD. The rate of synthesis will cease almost completely due to direct allosteric inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by cholesterol.\n\nE. The rate of synthesis will become solely dependent on the concentration of insulin in the medium.", "solution": "Under low sterol conditions in wild-type cells, SCAP escorts SREBP from the ER to the Golgi, where SREBP is cleaved to its active form that enters the nucleus and upregulates genes for cholesterol synthesis, including the gene encoding HMG-CoA reductase. Under high sterol conditions, sterols bind to the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, enabling SCAP to bind INSIG; the SCAP–SREBP complex is then retained in the ER, preventing SREBP activation and reducing transcription of cholesterol biosynthetic genes. In addition, INSIG also mediates sterol-accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, further lowering cholesterol synthesis.\n\nIn the engineered INSIG-deficient liver cells, the key sterol-sensing negative feedback steps that require INSIG are lost. First, although sterols can bind SCAP, without INSIG the SCAP–SREBP complex cannot be retained in the ER; therefore, SCAP continues to escort SREBP to the Golgi, SREBP is cleaved, and its nuclear fragment constitutively drives transcription of cholesterol biosynthetic genes. Second, the sterol-stimulated, INSIG-dependent degradation of HMG-CoA reductase cannot occur, stabilizing the rate-limiting enzyme. Cholesterol does not directly and potently allosterically inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, so high extracellular cholesterol cannot by itself shut down the pathway in the absence of INSIG. Although hormones such as insulin modulate SREBP and HMG-CoA reductase activity, the loss of INSIG eliminates the principal sterol-dependent feedback, so insulin does not become the sole determinant of the synthesis rate.\n\nTherefore, even in a high-cholesterol medium, INSIG-deficient cells fail to down-regulate endogenous cholesterol synthesis; the rate remains constitutively high and largely unaffected by the external cholesterol load.
