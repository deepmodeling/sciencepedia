Ketogenesis is a prime example of this, serving as a way for the liver to export energy to other tissues. This exercise [@problem_id:2055006] asks you to analyze the entire process from a whole-body perspective, calculating the net energetic \"tax\" for shipping fuel from the liver to the brain, revealing the subtle but important trade-offs inherent in metabolic design.", "problem": "During prolonged fasting or on a ketogenic diet, the liver performs ketogenesis to convert acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) into ketone bodies, which serve as a vital fuel source for extrahepatic tissues like the brain. This process of converting a key metabolite in one organ for use in another incurs a small energetic cost.\n\nThis problem asks you to quantify this metabolic 'tax'. Consider the complete process beginning with two molecules of acetyl-CoA within a liver hepatocyte and ending with the successful regeneration of two molecules of acetyl-CoA inside a brain neuron.\n\nThe sequence of events is as follows:\n1.  In the liver, two molecules of acetyl-CoA are consumed to synthesize one molecule of beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is then exported into the bloodstream. This synthesis involves the reduction of an intermediate using the reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH).\n2.  The beta-hydroxybutyrate molecule travels through the blood to a brain neuron.\n3.  Inside the neuron, the beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized and ultimately converted back into two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which are then ready to enter the Citric Acid Cycle. The critical activation step in this pathway involves the transfer of Coenzyme A (CoA) from a molecule of succinyl-CoA.\n\nUsing the provided information and standard biochemical pathways, calculate the net energetic cost for this entire inter-organ transport strategy, accounting for all inputs and outputs in both the liver and the brain.\n\nFor your calculation, use the following energy conversions: the synthesis of one molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is energetically equivalent to one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and the oxidation of one molecule of NADH via the electron transport chain yields 2.5 molecules of ATP.\n\nExpress your answer as a single number representing the net cost in ATP equivalents.", "solution": "To determine the net energetic cost, we must analyze the energy-consuming and energy-producing steps in both the liver (ketogenesis) and the brain (ketolysis) and then sum them. The overall process is the transfer of the chemical energy of two acetyl-CoA molecules from the liver to the brain.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the energetic cost in the liver (Ketogenesis)**\n\nThe synthesis of beta-hydroxybutyrate from two molecules of acetyl-CoA proceeds in several steps:\n1.  Two molecules of acetyl-CoA condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA.\n    $$2 \\text{ acetyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{acetoacetyl-CoA} + \\text{CoA-SH}$$\n2.  Acetoacetyl-CoA combines with another acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is then cleaved to yield acetoacetate and one acetyl-CoA.\n    $$\\text{acetoacetyl-CoA} + \\text{acetyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{HMG-CoA} + \\text{CoA-SH}$$\n    $$\\text{HMG-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{acetoacetate} + \\text{acetyl-CoA}$$\n    The net reaction for forming acetoacetate is:\n    $$2 \\text{ acetyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{acetoacetate} + 2 \\text{ CoA-SH}$$\n    These initial steps do not consume or produce any ATP, GTP, NADH, or FADH$_2$.\n3.  Finally, acetoacetate is reduced to beta-hydroxybutyrate. This is the step mentioned in the problem involving NADH.\n    $$\\text{acetoacetate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{beta-hydroxybutyrate} + \\text{NAD}^+$$\n\nSumming up the liver process, the net energetic cost is the consumption of one molecule of NADH.\nCost in liver = 1 NADH consumed\nUsing the given conversion factor:\nLiver Cost = 1 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 2.5 ATP equivalents.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the energetic cost/gain in the brain (Ketolysis)**\n\nThe brain neuron takes up beta-hydroxybutyrate and converts it back to two molecules of acetyl-CoA.\n1.  First, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized back to acetoacetate. This is the reverse of the final step in the liver.\n    $$\\text{beta-hydroxybutyrate} + \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{acetoacetate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+$$\n    This step produces one molecule of NADH.\n    Energy gain from this step = 1 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 2.5 ATP equivalents.\n\n2.  Next, acetoacetate is activated to acetoacetyl-CoA. As stated in the problem, this is achieved by transferring a CoA molecule from succinyl-CoA. The enzyme responsible is thiophorase (succinyl-CoA:acetoacetate-CoA transferase), which is absent in the liver.\n    $$\\text{acetoacetate} + \\text{succinyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{acetoacetyl-CoA} + \\text{succinate}$$\n    This step has a crucial, indirect energetic cost. In the Citric Acid Cycle, the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate is coupled with substrate-level phosphorylation, generating one molecule of GTP.\n    $$\\text{succinyl-CoA} + \\text{GDP} + \\text{P}_i \\rightarrow \\text{succinate} + \\text{GTP} + \\text{CoA-SH}$$\n    By using succinyl-CoA to activate acetoacetate, the neuron bypasses this step of the Citric Acid Cycle. Therefore, the cell forgoes the production of one GTP molecule. This represents an opportunity cost equivalent to 1 ATP.\n    Cost from this step = 1 GTP foregone = 1 ATP equivalent.\n\n3.  Finally, acetoacetyl-CoA is cleaved by thiolase into two molecules of acetyl-CoA.\n    $$\\text{acetoacetyl-CoA} + \\text{CoA-SH} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ acetyl-CoA}$$\n    This step has no energetic cost or gain.\n\nSumming up the brain process, there is a production of one NADH and a foregone production of one GTP.\nNet energy change in brain = (Gain from NADH) - (Cost from GTP) = 2.5 ATP - 1.0 ATP = 1.5 ATP equivalents. This is a net gain for the brain cell itself.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Net System-Wide Energetic Cost**\n\nThe net energetic \"tax\" for the entire system (body) is the sum of the costs and gains from both organs. We can express costs as positive values and gains as negative values.\n\nNet System Cost = (Cost in Liver) - (Net Gain in Brain)\nNet System Cost = (1 NADH consumed) + (1 GTP foregone) - (1 NADH produced)\n\nIn terms of ATP equivalents:\nNet System Cost = (2.5 ATP) + (1.0 ATP) - (2.5 ATP)\nNet System Cost = 1.0 ATP equivalent.\n\nThe NADH consumed in the liver and the NADH produced in the brain cancel each other out from a whole-body perspective. The only uncompensated cost is the single GTP that is not produced in the brain because its precursor, succinyl-CoA, is diverted to activate the ketone body. Therefore, the net metabolic tax to move the fuel equivalent of two acetyl-CoA molecules from the liver to the brain is 1 ATP equivalent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2055006"}, {"introduction": "A true grasp of a metabolic pathway includes the ability to predict how the system responds when a component fails.

The key baseline processes are:\n- Adipose lipolysis increases plasma free fatty acids (FFAs); the liver takes up FFAs and performs $\\beta$-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH$_{2}$.\n- Hepatic ketogenesis disposes of acetyl-CoA and provides alternative fuel as ketone bodies (acetoacetate and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate), thereby sparing glucose.\n\nThe mitochondrial ketogenesis steps are:\n1) Two acetyl-CoA condense to acetoacetyl-CoA via thiolase.\n2) Acetoacetyl-CoA combines with another acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA via HMG-CoA synthase.\n3) HMG-CoA lyase cleaves HMG-CoA to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA.\n\nThe administered agent is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA lyase.

The inhibitor does not diminish this hormonal drive. In addition, impaired hepatic ketogenesis reduces the liver’s capacity to dispose of incoming acetyl-CoA via ketone production, limiting hepatic clearance/utilization of FFAs and favoring accumulation in plasma. Therefore FFAs increase.\n\n3) Glucose: In prolonged fasting, ketone bodies normally spare glucose by supplying the brain and other tissues. With ketogenesis blocked at HMG-CoA lyase, ketone supply falls and peripheral glucose utilization must rise to meet energy demands. Although hepatic gluconeogenesis is stimulated by the fasting state and supported in part by ATP from $\\beta$-oxidation, the increased systemic demand for glucose in the absence of ketones typically exceeds supply, producing hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Therefore glucose decreases.\n\nThe directional changes are thus: FFAs increase, glucose decreases, acetoacetate decreases, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2055056"}]}
