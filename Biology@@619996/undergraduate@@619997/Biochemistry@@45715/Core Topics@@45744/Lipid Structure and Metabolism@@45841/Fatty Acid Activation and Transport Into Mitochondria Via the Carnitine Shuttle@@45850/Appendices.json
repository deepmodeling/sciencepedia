This exercise demonstrates the critical principle of compartmentalization in metabolism, highlighting that the cell maintains separate pools of essential cofactors like CoA. By considering why a label on cytosolic CoA doesn't appear in the mitochondrial matrix, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the shuttle's elegant design, which transfers only the acyl group, not the entire acyl-CoA molecule.

They prepare a culture of hepatocytes (liver cells) and introduce a custom-synthesized version of Coenzyme A (CoA) directly into the cytosol. In this modified CoA, the sulfur atom of the reactive thiol group is the radioactive isotope sulfur-35 ($^{35}\\text{S}$). Following this, a long-chain fatty acid, hexadecanoic acid, is added to the cell culture medium, and the cells are incubated to allow for fatty acid uptake, activation, and transport into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.\n\nAfter a sufficient incubation period, the mitochondria are carefully isolated, lysed, and the molecular contents of the mitochondrial matrix are analyzed.

The enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase, which activates the fatty acid, works by cleaving the C-S bond of CoA and attaching the fatty acid directly to the pantothenic acid moiety, releasing the radioactive sulfur as a free ion into the cytosol.\n\nB. The acyl group is passed from cytosolic acyl-CoA to a series of iron-sulfur clusters within the electron transport chain, which then deliver the acyl group to the mitochondrial CoA pool, a process that does not transfer the original sulfur atom.\n\nC. The enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from the cytosolic $^{35}\\text{S}$-CoA to a carnitine molecule, releasing the free $^{35}\\text{S}$-CoA back into the cytosol. The resulting acyl-carnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where the acyl group is then transferred to a separate, non-radioactive mitochondrial pool of CoA.\n\nD. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains an active transport protein that symports acyl-CoA and a proton. This transporter has a high specificity that rejects any CoA molecule containing a heavier sulfur isotope like $^{35}\\text{S}$, preventing its entry.\n\nE. During the formation of acyl-CoA in the cytosol, a transient acyl-AMP intermediate is formed.

The catalytic mechanism uses ATP to form an enzyme-bound acyl-adenylate intermediate and then forms a thioester with the thiol of CoA.

Therefore, option A is incorrect, and option E is incorrect because the acyl-AMP does not traverse membranes.\n\n2) Long-chain acyl-CoA does not cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. Instead, the carnitine shuttle transfers the acyl group across. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, transfers the acyl group from cytosolic acyl-CoA to carnitine, releasing free CoA in the cytosol. The reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{acyl-CoA}_{\\text{cyt}} + \\text{carnitine} \\rightarrow \\text{acyl-carnitine} + \\text{CoA-SH}_{\\text{cyt}}.\n$$\nIf the cytosolic CoA carries $^{35}\\text{S}$, then the $^{35}\\text{S}$ remains with the cytosolic CoA released by CPT I.\n\n3) Acyl-carnitine is translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. There is no transport of CoA across the inner membrane; mitochondrial and cytosolic CoA pools are distinct. Therefore, any selectivity against $^{35}\\text{S}$-CoA import (option D) is irrelevant and incorrect because acyl-CoA is not imported at all.\n\n4) In the matrix, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) transfers the acyl group from acyl-carnitine to the mitochondrial CoA pool (which is unlabeled in this setup), regenerating carnitine:\n$$\n\\text{acyl-carnitine} + \\text{CoA-SH}_{\\text{matrix}} \\rightarrow \\text{acyl-CoA}_{\\text{matrix}} + \\text{carnitine}.\n$$\nThus, the acyl-CoA formed in the matrix uses mitochondrial CoA and will not carry the $^{35}\\text{S}$ label that remained in the cytosolic CoA.\n\n5) The acyl group is not handed off via iron-sulfur clusters of the electron transport chain (option B is mechanistically unrelated to fatty acid transport).\n\nConclusion: The absence of $^{35}\\text{S}$ in mitochondrial acyl-CoA arises because CPT I transfers the acyl group to carnitine, leaving $^{35}\\text{S}$-CoA in the cytosol, and CPT II then uses a separate, unlabeled mitochondrial CoA to reform acyl-CoA in the matrix.

This activated form is a substrate for CPT1, which catalyzes a reaction with cytosolic carnitine to form an \"Inhibutyl-carnitine\" adduct. This reaction proceeds until all the cytosolic Inhibutate is consumed, sequestering carnitine in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.
