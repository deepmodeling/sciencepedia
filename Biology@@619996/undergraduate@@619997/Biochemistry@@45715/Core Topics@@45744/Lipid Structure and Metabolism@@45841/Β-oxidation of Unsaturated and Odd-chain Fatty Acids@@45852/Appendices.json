The calculation will be based on the provided stoichiometric rules.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the complete oxidation of stearate ($18{:}0$).\nThe number of carbon atoms is $n = 18$.\n\n1.  **Activation:** The fatty acid is first activated to its acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) form, stearoyl-CoA.

The only difference in the entire metabolic process, as defined by the problem, is the non-production of one molecule of $\\mathrm{FADH_2}$ during the $\\beta$-oxidation of oleate. According to the given P/O ratios, one molecule of $\\mathrm{FADH_2}$ yields $1.5$ ATP. The cis double bond thus imposes a \"cost\" of $1.5$ ATP relative to the saturated fatty acid of the same chain length. The difference in net ATP yield is therefore the negative of the ATP equivalent of one $\\mathrm{FADH_2}$.\n$$ \\Delta A = -\\left( \\text{ATP yield from } 1 \\text{ }\\mathrm{FADH_2} \\right) = -1.5 $$\nThe calculations are consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.5}$$", "id": "2584302"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus to odd-chain fatty acids, which conclude $\\beta$-oxidation with a three-carbon remnant, propionyl-CoA, rather than acetyl-CoA.
