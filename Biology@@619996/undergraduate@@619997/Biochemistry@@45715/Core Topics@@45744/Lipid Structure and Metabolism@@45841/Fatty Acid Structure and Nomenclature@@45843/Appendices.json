For a molecular formula $C_{c}H_{h}O_{o}$ with no nitrogen or halogens, the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), which counts the total number of rings and multiple bonds, is\n$$\nD=\\frac{2c+2-h}{2}.\n$$\nFor the given fatty acid $C_{22}H_{32}O_{2}$, substituting $c=22$ and $h=32$ gives\n$$\nD=\\frac{2\\cdot 22+2-32}{2}=\\frac{44+2-32}{2}=\\frac{14}{2}=7.\n$$\nThis $D=7$ counts all rings and multiple bonds present. The problem states there are no cyclic structures and exactly one carboxylic acid group. The carboxyl group contains one carbonyl ($C=O$) double bond, which contributes one unit to $D$.

This exercise will reinforce your understanding of how biochemical nomenclature, such as the delta ($\\Delta$) system, provides an unambiguous description of these structural differences [@problem_id:2046026].", "problem": "In biochemistry, the structure of fatty acids is often described using a shorthand notation `C:D(Δ^x,y,...)`, where `C` is the total number of carbon atoms, `D` is the number of double bonds, and the `Δ^x,y,...` notation indicates the positions of these double bonds.
