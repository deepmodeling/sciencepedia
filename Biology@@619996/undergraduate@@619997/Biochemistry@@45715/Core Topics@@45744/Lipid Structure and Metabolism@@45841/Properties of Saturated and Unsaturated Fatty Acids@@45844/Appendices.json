They isolate a major, unbranched-chain fatty acid from its cell membrane. Elemental analysis determines the molecular formula of this fatty acid to be $C_{20}H_{36}O_2$. Fatty acids are classified based on the number of carbon-carbon double bonds in their hydrocarbon tails: a fatty acid with zero carbon-carbon double bonds is \"saturated\", one with a single carbon-carbon double bond is \"monounsaturated\", and one with two or more is \"polyunsaturated\".\n\nAssuming the molecule is a standard fatty acid, consisting of a single carboxylic acid group attached to a hydrocarbon chain, which of the following correctly states the number of carbon-carbon double bonds and the classification of this fatty acid?\n\nA. 1, Monounsaturated\n\nB. 2, Monounsaturated\n\nC. 2, Polyunsaturated\n\nD. 3, Polyunsaturated\n\nE. 0, Saturated", "solution": "We are told the compound is a standard, unbranched fatty acid with formula $C_{20}H_{36}O_{2}$. For a saturated, straight-chain monocarboxylic acid with $n$ carbons, the general formula is\n$$\nC_{n}H_{2n}O_{2}.\n$$\nThis follows because the saturated acyl chain is an alkyl group ($C_{n}H_{2n+1}$) attached to $-COOH$, yielding $C_{n}H_{2n}O_{2}$ overall (as verified by known examples such as $C_{16}H_{32}O_{2}$ and $C_{18}H_{36}O_{2}$).\n\nMethod 1 (hydrogen deficiency relative to saturated acid):\n- For $n=20$, a saturated fatty acid would have $H=2n=40$, so the saturated formula would be $C_{20}H_{40}O_{2}$.\n- The observed hydrogen count is $H=36$, which is $4$ fewer than $40$.\n- Each carbon-carbon double bond reduces the hydrogen count by $2$ relative to saturation, so a deficit of $4$ hydrogens corresponds to\n$$\n\\frac{4}{2}=2\n$$\ncarbon-carbon double bonds.\n- Therefore, the fatty acid has $2$ carbon-carbon double bonds and is classified as polyunsaturated.\n\nMethod 2 (double bond equivalents, DBE):\n- The DBE for a molecular formula $C_{a}H_{b}N_{c}X_{d}O_{e}$ (with $X$ halogens and oxygen ignored) is\n$$\n\\text{DBE}=a-\\frac{b}{2}+\\frac{c}{2}+1.\n$$\n- For $C_{20}H_{36}O_{2}$ (with $N=0$, no halogens), \n$$\n\\text{DBE}=20-\\frac{36}{2}+1=20-18+1=3.\n$$\n- A standard fatty acid contains one carbonyl ($C=O$) in the carboxyl group, accounting for one degree of unsaturation.

This exercise contrasts a saturated fatty acid with its *cis*- and *trans*-unsaturated counterparts to explore how molecular shape influences packing efficiency. By analyzing a hypothetical experiment on membrane fluidity, you'll gain insight into the physical principles that explain why different types of fats have distinct biophysical and health impacts.[@problem_id:2065265]", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the biophysical properties of artificial cell membranes, known as liposomes. Three distinct populations of liposomes are synthesized. Each population incorporates a different 18-carbon fatty acid into its phospholipid structure, but all other components are identical. The three fatty acids used are:\n1.  Stearic acid (18:0), a fully saturated fatty acid.\n2.  Oleic acid (18:1 cis-$\\Delta$9), a monounsaturated fatty acid with a *cis* double bond.\n3.  Elaidic acid (18:1 trans-$\\Delta$9), a monounsaturated fatty acid with a *trans* double bond.\n\nThe biochemist measures the membrane fluidity for each liposome population at a constant physiological temperature. The results show that the membrane fluidity of liposomes containing elaidic acid is significantly lower than that of liposomes containing oleic acid, and is much closer to the low fluidity observed in liposomes containing stearic acid.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observation regarding membrane fluidity?\n\nA. The *trans* double bond in elaidic acid is less polar than the *cis* double bond in oleic acid, leading to weaker intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions and thus tighter packing.\n\nB. The linear, straight-chain geometry of *trans*-unsaturated fatty acids allows them to pack together more densely within the membrane, similar to how saturated fatty acids pack.\n\nC. Elaidic acid and stearic acid are structurally similar because they both lack double bonds, which is why their effect on membrane fluidity is comparable.\n\nD. The *trans* double bond is energetically less stable than a *cis* double bond, causing it to spontaneously isomerize or break, effectively saturating the fatty acid chain over time.\n\nE. The kink in *cis*-unsaturated fatty acids promotes stronger van der Waals forces between adjacent lipid tails, which increases the overall membrane fluidity.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physical principle: membrane fluidity at a fixed temperature depends primarily on how tightly lipid acyl chains can pack, which is governed by chain geometry and the strength of van der Waals (London dispersion) interactions between hydrocarbon tails. Tighter packing yields stronger cumulative dispersion interactions, a higher melting temperature (denoted $T_{m}$), and thus lower fluidity at a given temperature $T$. Conversely, disrupted packing weakens dispersion interactions, lowers $T_{m}$, and increases fluidity.\n\nWe analyze the three fatty acids:\n- Stearic acid (18:0) is fully saturated and adopts a linear, extended conformation. This allows dense packing and strong van der Waals interactions, producing a high $T_{m}$ and low fluidity.\n- Oleic acid (18:1 cis-$\\Delta$9) has a cis double bond that introduces a kink into the hydrocarbon chain. This kink prevents close, parallel alignment of adjacent chains, decreases effective contact area, weakens van der Waals interactions, lowers $T_{m}$, and increases fluidity.\n- Elaidic acid (18:1 trans-$\\Delta$9) has a trans double bond that preserves an overall more linear, rod-like chain geometry than the cis isomer. This geometry allows denser packing, stronger dispersion interactions, and a higher $T_{m}$, thus lowering fluidity relative to the cis isomer.\n\nThe observation that liposomes with elaidic acid show fluidity much closer to that with stearic acid than to that with oleic acid is therefore explained by the chain geometry: trans-unsaturated chains are effectively straighter and pack similarly to saturated chains, whereas cis-unsaturated chains are kinked and disrupt packing.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: differences in double-bond polarity are not the determining factor, and weaker dipole-dipole interactions would not rationalize tighter packing.\n- B is correct: the linear, straight-chain geometry of trans-unsaturated fatty acids allows dense packing, similar to saturated chains, thereby lowering fluidity.\n- C is false: elaidic acid does contain a double bond.\n- D is incorrect: trans alkenes are typically more thermodynamically stable than cis, and spontaneous saturation does not occur under these conditions.\n- E is incorrect: the cis kink reduces, not strengthens, van der Waals interactions; reduced interactions increase fluidity, but the statementâ€™s causal description is wrong.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the packing effect due to the linear geometry of trans-unsaturated chains, matching option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2065265"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the properties of individual fatty acids, their arrangement within larger molecules like triacylglycerols is critical for their metabolism.
