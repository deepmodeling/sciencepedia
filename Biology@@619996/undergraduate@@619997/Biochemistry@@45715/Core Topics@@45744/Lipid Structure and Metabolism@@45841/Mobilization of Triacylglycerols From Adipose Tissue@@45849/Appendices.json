This process involves a signal transduction cascade starting with glucagon binding to its G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR). This binding event activates an associated heterotrimeric G-protein, causing its Gαs subunit to release GDP and bind GTP. The active Gαs-GTP complex then stimulates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that synthesizes the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP. Elevated cAMP levels activate Protein Kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates and activates two key targets: perilipin, a protein coating the lipid droplet, and Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL), the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols. The entire signaling process is designed to be transient, with a crucial \"off-switch\" being the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gαs subunit, which hydrolyzes its bound GTP back to GDP, rendering it inactive.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder where a specific mutation in the gene for the Gαs subunit has completely eliminated its intrinsic GTPase activity, without affecting its ability to bind GTP or interact with adenylyl cyclase. An adipocyte from this patient is exposed to a brief pulse of glucagon, which is then removed. Which of the following statements best describes the state of cAMP concentration and HSL activity within the cell a significant amount of time after the glucagon has been removed?\n\nA. Both cAMP concentration and HSL activity will return to their low basal levels.\n\nB. The cAMP concentration will remain elevated, but HSL activity will return to its low basal level due to desensitization.\n\nC. Both cAMP concentration and HSL activity will remain persistently elevated.\n\nD. The cAMP concentration will return to its low basal level, but HSL activity will remain persistently elevated.\n\nE. Neither cAMP concentration nor HSL activity will increase in response to the glucagon pulse.", "solution": "The normal sequence is: glucagon binds its GPCR, acting as a GEF for the heterotrimeric G protein so that $G\\alpha_{s}\\!:\\!\\mathrm{GDP} \\to G\\alpha_{s}\\!:\\!\\mathrm{GTP}$.

After a brief glucagon pulse and removal of ligand, any $G\\alpha_{s}$ that has been converted to $G\\alpha_{s}\\!:\\!\\mathrm{GTP}$ remains locked in the active state because the sole physiological “off-switch” (GTP hydrolysis on $G\\alpha_{s}$) is absent.

PDEs remove cAMP such that $v_{\\mathrm{PDE}}$ increases with $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ (e.g., $v_{\\mathrm{PDE}} = k_{\\mathrm{PDE}}[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ as a simple case).

Therefore, $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ remains elevated long after glucagon removal.\n\nPKA activity is an increasing function of $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$, so persistently elevated $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ maintains a persistently higher fraction of active PKA. The phosphorylation state of HSL follows\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{HSL\\text{-}P}]}{dt} \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{PKA}}^{\\ast}[\\mathrm{HSL}] - k_{\\mathrm{PP}}[\\mathrm{HSL\\text{-}P}],\n$$\nwith steady state\n$$\n[\\mathrm{HSL\\text{-}P}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\;=\\; \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{PKA}}^{\\ast}}{k_{\\mathrm{PP}}}[\\mathrm{HSL}],\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{PKA}}^{\\ast}$ increases with PKA activity.

Receptor desensitization mechanisms do not reverse the active $G\\alpha_{s}\\!:\\!\\mathrm{GTP}$ in this mutant, and PDEs cannot drive $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ back to basal while AC is continuously stimulated; they only set a new elevated steady state.\n\nTherefore, both cAMP concentration and HSL activity remain persistently elevated a significant time after glucagon removal.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2059101"}, {"introduction": "Once the hormonal signal has been received, the actual breakdown of triacylglycerols is carried out by a team of enzymes in a specific sequence.
