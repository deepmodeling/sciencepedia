This process relies on the intrinsic structure of the nascent messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcript. As the mRNA molecule is synthesized, a specific G-C rich sequence folds back on itself to form a stable hairpin structure. This hairpin is immediately followed by a short stretch of uracil residues. The formation of the hairpin causes the RNA polymerase to pause, and the weak A-U base pairs between the template DNA and the uracil tail of the mRNA cause the transcript to dissociate, terminating transcription.\n\nConsider the following 30-nucleotide segment of a nascent bacterial mRNA transcript, with nucleotides numbered 1 to 30 from the 5' end to the 3' end:\n\n`5'-AUGGCGCCAGCUAUCAAGCUGGCUUUUUAG-3'`\n\nYour task is to identify the contiguous segments of this RNA strand that form the stem of the most stable terminator hairpin.

The hairpin stem must be formed by standard Watson-Crick base pairing, where Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).\n2.
