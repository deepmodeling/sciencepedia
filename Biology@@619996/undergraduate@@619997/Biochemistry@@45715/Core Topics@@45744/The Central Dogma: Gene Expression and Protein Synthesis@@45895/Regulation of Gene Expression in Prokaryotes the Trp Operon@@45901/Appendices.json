{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our exploration of the Trp operon begins with its primary control system: the repressor protein. This exercise challenges you to predict the outcome of a specific \"gain-of-function\" mutation, creating a so-called \"super-repressor.\" By analyzing this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:2070727], you can solidify your understanding of how a repressor protein's interaction with the operator sequence serves as a fundamental on/off switch for gene expression.", "problem": "In a wild-type strain of *Escherichia coli*, the *trp* operon is a repressible system that regulates the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. The operon's expression is controlled by the *trpR* gene product, the Trp repressor protein. In the presence of high concentrations of its corepressor, tryptophan, the Trp repressor binds to the operator sequence of the *trp* operon, thereby blocking transcription. In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor is inactive and does not bind to the operator, allowing for the transcription of the structural genes needed for tryptophan synthesis.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a specific mutation in the *trpR* gene, designated $trpR^S$. This mutation results in a \"super-repressor\" protein that is constitutively active, meaning it binds to the *trp* operator sequence with high affinity regardless of the intracellular concentration of tryptophan.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the phenotype of this $trpR^S$ mutant strain regarding the expression of the *trp* operon structural genes (*trpE, D, C, B, A*)?\n\nA. The *trp* operon will be constitutively expressed (always on) regardless of tryptophan levels.\n\nB. The *trp* operon will be constitutively repressed (always off) regardless of tryptophan levels.\n\nC. The *trp* operon will show normal, wild-type regulation, being repressed in the presence of tryptophan and expressed in its absence.\n\nD. The *trp* operon will be expressed only in the presence of high tryptophan levels and repressed in its absence.\n\nE. The *trp* operon will be non-functional due to the inability of RNA polymerase to bind the promoter.", "solution": "1. In the wild-type *trp* operon, the *trpR* gene encodes a repressor that requires tryptophan (corepressor) to adopt the DNA-binding conformation. Therefore:\n   - High tryptophan: repressor binds operator, transcription is blocked (operon OFF).\n   - Low tryptophan: repressor cannot bind operator, transcription proceeds (operon ON).\n\n2. The $trpR^S$ mutation produces a super-repressor that is constitutively active in its DNA-binding form, independent of tryptophan. This protein binds the operator with high affinity regardless of intracellular tryptophan concentration.\n\n3. Because the repressor is always bound to the operator, RNA polymerase cannot initiate transcription of the structural genes. This effect is independent of tryptophan levels and persists under both high and low tryptophan conditions.\n\n4. Therefore, the mutant phenotype is constitutive repression of the *trp* operon structural genes (*trpE, D, C, B, A*) regardless of tryptophan levels.\n\n5. Among the choices, this corresponds to the operon being always off independent of tryptophan, which is option B. Options A and D contradict repression by a super-repressor; option C describes wild-type regulation; option E incorrectly generalizes the cause as an inherent promoter defect rather than repression due to persistent operator occupancy by the super-repressor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2070727"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of repression, we now examine how regulatory components interact within a more complex genetic landscape. This problem presents a partial diploid, or merodiploid, cell containing two different versions of the Trp operon's regulatory region. Solving this [@problem_id:2070751] requires you to distinguish between *cis*-acting DNA elements, which affect only adjacent genes, and *trans*-acting protein factors, which can diffuse through the cell to act on any appropriate target.", "problem": "In the regulation of biosynthesis pathways, bacteria like *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) utilize operons to efficiently control gene expression. The tryptophan (*trp*) operon is a classic example of a repressible operon. Consider a partial diploid (merodiploid) strain of *E. coli* created in a lab. This strain has its own chromosome and an additional F' plasmid, giving it two copies of the *trp* operon regulatory region.\n\nThe genotype of this partial diploid is $trpR^+ O^+ / trpR^+ O^c$. The symbols are defined as follows:\n- $trpR^+$: The wild-type allele for the repressor gene, which produces a functional repressor protein.\n- $O^+$: The wild-type operator DNA sequence, to which the active repressor can bind.\n- $O^c$: A constitutive mutant operator DNA sequence, to which the repressor protein cannot bind.\n- The `/` separates the genes on the chromosome from the genes on the F' plasmid. Assume both operons have functional structural genes for tryptophan synthesis.\n\nIf this bacterial strain is grown in a culture medium containing a high concentration of tryptophan, which of the following statements best describes the expression of the structural genes of the *trp* operon?\n\nA. The structural genes will not be expressed, as the repressor protein will be active and bind to both operators.\n\nB. The structural genes will be expressed at a high, constitutive level from both operons.\n\nC. The structural genes will be expressed constitutively from the operon with the $O^c$ operator, while expression from the operon with the $O^+$ operator will be repressed.\n\nD. The structural genes will not be expressed because the $trpR^+$ gene product is trans-dominant over the $O^c$ mutation.\n\nE. The structural genes will be expressed only when tryptophan is removed from the medium.", "solution": "We identify the components and their regulatory logic:\n\n- The genotype is two copies of the regulatory region: one with $trpR^+ O^+$ and one with $trpR^+ O^c$. The structural genes downstream of each operator are functional.\n- The $trpR^+$ allele produces a functional repressor protein $R$ that is diffusible (acts in trans), so it can regulate both operons.\n- In the presence of high tryptophan concentration, tryptophan $T$ acts as a corepressor, forming the active complex $R\\cdot T$ that binds to the operator $O^+$ to block transcription initiation.\n- The operator mutation $O^c$ is a cis-acting DNA change that prevents repressor binding; by definition $R\\cdot T$ cannot bind $O^c$.\n\nNow analyze regulation under the stated conditions:\n\n1. High tryptophan implies the repressor is activated:\n   $$R + T \\rightarrow R \\cdot T$$\n2. The active $R \\cdot T$ binds the wild-type operator and represses transcription:\n   $$R \\cdot T \\leftrightarrow O^+ \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{transcription from } O^+ \\text{ is repressed}.$$\n3. The constitutive operator does not bind the repressor:\n   $$R \\cdot T \\nleftrightarrow O^c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{transcription from } O^c \\text{ proceeds constitutively}.$$\n4. Because $trpR^+$ is trans-acting and $O^c$ is cis-acting, the inability to bind at $O^c$ is not overcome by additional repressor; thus the structural genes downstream of $O^c$ are expressed regardless of tryptophan, while those downstream of $O^+$ are repressed in high tryptophan.\n\nTherefore, in high tryptophan, expression is repressed from the $O^+$ operon and constitutive from the $O^c$ operon. This matches option C and rules out:\n- A (cannot bind $O^c$),\n- B (the $O^+$ copy is repressed),\n- D (operator is cis-dominant; repressor cannot override $O^c$),\n- E (the $O^c$ copy is expressed even when tryptophan is present).\n\nHence the correct statement is that the structural genes are expressed constitutively from the $O^c$ operon while the $O^+$ operon is repressed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070751"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the simple on/off switch of the repressor, the Trp operon employs a second, more nuanced mechanism called attenuation for fine-tuning expression. This practice focuses exclusively on this elegant system by describing a mutation that disrupts a key RNA structure in the operon's leader sequence. By working through the consequences of this mutation [@problem_id:2070742], you will unravel the logic of how the cell senses tryptophan levels through the process of translation itself to control transcription.", "problem": "In many bacteria, such as *E. coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon. This operon is subject to a sophisticated regulatory mechanism known as attenuation, which fine-tunes its expression based on tryptophan availability. This process depends on the formation of alternative secondary structures within the 5' leader sequence of the operon's messenger RNA (mRNA). This leader sequence contains four distinct regions, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, which can form hairpin loops through base pairing.\n\nThe standard interactions are as follows:\n- Pairing of region 1 and region 2 forms a \"pause loop\".\n- Pairing of region 3 and region 4 forms a \"terminator loop\", which halts transcription.\n- Pairing of region 2 and region 3 forms an \"anti-terminator loop\", which prevents the formation of the 3-4 terminator loop, thereby allowing transcription to proceed into the structural genes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* where a mutation has occurred in the DNA sequence corresponding to region 2 of the *trp* leader mRNA. This specific mutation completely prevents region 2 from base-pairing with region 3, making the formation of the anti-terminator loop impossible. All other potential pairings (i.e., 1-2 loop and 3-4 loop) remain possible and are energetically favorable when the involved sequences are available. For this problem, assume that the primary *trp* repressor protein is non-functional, so regulation is controlled solely by the attenuation mechanism.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expression of the *trp* operon structural genes in this mutant strain under varying tryptophan concentrations?\n\nA. The operon will be constitutively expressed, meaning structural genes are transcribed at a high level regardless of tryptophan concentration.\n\nB. The operon will be constitutively repressed, meaning transcription of structural genes will be terminated at a high frequency regardless of tryptophan concentration.\n\nC. The operon will exhibit reversed regulation, with high expression in high tryptophan and low expression in low tryptophan.\n\nD. The operon will exhibit normal wild-type regulation, with high expression in low tryptophan and low expression in high tryptophan.", "solution": "We begin by stating the attenuation principles for the trp leader:\n- Region pairs 1-2 form a pause loop early to allow ribosome loading.\n- Region pairs 3-4 form a terminator loop that causes transcription termination.\n- Region pairs 2-3 form an anti-terminator loop that prevents 3-4 and allows transcription to proceed into structural genes.\n\nIn the mutant, region 2 cannot base-pair with region 3. Therefore, the 2-3 anti-terminator cannot form under any condition. The 1-2 and 3-4 pairings remain possible when their sequences are available.\n\nConsider high tryptophan:\n- The ribosome quickly translates the leader peptide, moving through region 1 and into region 2. This prevents region 2 from pairing with region 3 (which is already impossible by mutation) and leaves region 3 free to pair with region 4.\n- Consequently, the 3-4 terminator forms, causing transcription termination.\n\nConsider low tryptophan:\n- The ribosome stalls at the tandem tryptophan codons in region 1, sequestering region 1 and preventing 1-2 pairing. Region 2 is free, but cannot pair with region 3 due to the mutation.\n- As regions 3 and 4 are transcribed and available, they pair to form the 3-4 terminator loop.\n- Thus, termination also occurs under low tryptophan.\n\nIn both conditions, the anti-terminator cannot form, and the terminator 3-4 forms whenever regions 3 and 4 are available. Therefore, attenuation causes termination regardless of tryptophan levels. The non-functional trp repressor is irrelevant here since attenuation alone enforces repression. Hence, the operon is constitutively repressed with high termination frequency under all tryptophan concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the statement that the operon will be constitutively repressed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2070742"}]}
