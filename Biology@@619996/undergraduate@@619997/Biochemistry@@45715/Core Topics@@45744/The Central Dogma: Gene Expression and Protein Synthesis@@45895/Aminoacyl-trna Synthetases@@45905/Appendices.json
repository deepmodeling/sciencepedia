The fidelity of this charging step is paramount for accurate protein synthesis, as the ribosome deciphers the genetic code by matching the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon with the tRNA's anticodon, without verifying the amino acid carried by the tRNA.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line with a mutation in the gene encoding alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS). The resulting mutant enzyme, while still able to recognize and bind to the tRNA for alanine ($\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$), has a less specific active site. Consequently, it frequently attaches the amino acid glycine (Gly) to $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ instead of the correct amino acid, alanine (Ala). Assume these mischarged $\\text{Gly-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ molecules are stable and participate in translation.\n\nIf an mRNA molecule encoding a large, multi-domain protein with numerous alanine residues is translated in these mutant cells, which of the following statements best describes the most direct and widespread consequence for the resulting polypeptide population?\n\nA. The ribosome will stall and translation will be aborted whenever an alanine codon is encountered, leading to the production of exclusively short, truncated protein fragments.\n\nB. A population of full-length protein molecules will be synthesized, but a significant fraction will have glycine residues incorporated at positions that were specified by the genetic code to be alanine.\n\nC. Cellular quality-control mechanisms will rapidly degrade all mischarged $\\text{Gly-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ molecules, effectively causing a functional depletion of $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ and halting most protein synthesis.\n\nD. The ribosome, upon detecting the incorrect pairing of an alanine codon with a tRNA carrying glycine, will pause and wait for a correctly charged $\\text{Ala-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ to become available.\n\nE. The genetic code within this cell line will functionally adapt, causing alanine codons on the mRNA to be recognized as ambiguous, leading to random termination of translation at these sites.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure translational fidelity by attaching the correct amino acid to a tRNA bearing a specific anticodon. The ribosome verifies codon-anticodon pairing but does not directly verify the identity of the amino acid attached to the tRNA. Therefore, the amino acid incorporated at a given codon is determined by the charging specificity of the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.\n\nGiven a mutant alanyl-tRNA synthetase, denoted $AlaRS$, that frequently mischarges $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ with glycine, the resulting misacylated species $\\text{Gly-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ retains the alanine-recognizing anticodon. When the ribosome encounters an alanine codon on the mRNA, $\\text{Gly-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ can base-pair correctly via its anticodon and will be accepted into the A site because decoding depends on codon-anticodon complementarity. Since the problem states that these mischarged tRNAs are stable and participate in translation, they will deliver glycine at positions encoded for alanine without triggering rejection or stalling.\n\nConsequently, translation elongation proceeds to completion across the open reading frame, producing full-length polypeptides. However, at sites where alanine codons appear, there will be a substantial probability of incorporating glycine instead of alanine, yielding a population of proteins bearing Ala-to-Gly substitutions at multiple positions. This outcome is the most direct and widespread consequence of the specified defect.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the ribosome does not stall simply due to misacylation; codon-anticodon pairing remains correct, so elongation continues.\n- Option C is incompatible with the stated assumption that mischarged $\\text{Gly-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ molecules are stable and participate in translation; moreover, there is no universal cellular mechanism that degrades all mischarged tRNAs rapidly enough to halt most protein synthesis under these conditions.\n- Option D is incorrect because the ribosome cannot detect the amino acid attached to the tRNA; it does not pause to await a correctly charged $\\text{Ala-tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ if codon-anticodon pairing is correct.\n- Option E is incorrect because the genetic code does not adapt in this manner, and there is no mechanism leading to random termination at alanine codons as a direct consequence of mischarging.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that full-length proteins are produced with glycine incorporated at positions encoded for alanine, corresponding to Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468656"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of synthetase accuracy, we now investigate the mechanism behind it. How does an alanyl-tRNA synthetase specifically recognize a $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$? This practice problem [@problem_id:2030990] utilizes a clever thought experiment involving genetic engineering to decouple tRNA recognition from codon reading, revealing that synthetases identify their cognate tRNAs through specific structural features, known as 'identity elements', which are often independent of the anticodon.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment aiming to investigate the specificity of the translational machinery, a researcher modifies the gene for an alanine transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA), denoted as $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$. The modification is highly specific: the nucleotide triplet in the anticodon loop of $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ is altered to become the anticodon for the amino acid cysteine. This engineered tRNA is then introduced into a cell-free in vitro translation system, which is fully equipped for protein synthesis. The system contains functional ribosomes, a pool of all 20 standard amino acids (including alanine and cysteine), all necessary enzymatic factors, a complete set of functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and a synthetic messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) template that includes multiple codons for cysteine.\n\nIt is given that the modification of the anticodon does not significantly alter the overall three-dimensional structure of the tRNA molecule, allowing its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to still recognize and charge it with an amino acid.

The ribosome monitors codon-anticodon pairing but does not verify the amino acid attached to the tRNA.\n\nApply to the scenario:\n1. The engineered tRNA is derived from $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ala}}$ but has its anticodon altered to pair with a cysteine codon. It is given that this change does not disrupt the tRNA identity elements or overall structure required for recognition by its cognate alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS).\n2. Therefore, AlaRS will charge this modified tRNA with alanine, not cysteine, because aaRS recognition depends on tRNA identity elements (often in the acceptor stem and elsewhere), not solely on the anticodon.\n3. In the ribosome, when a cysteine codon appears in the A site, the modified tRNA with the cysteine-recognizing anticodon will base-pair correctly with that codon and be accepted.\n4. The ribosome will incorporate the amino acid attached to this tRNA into the growing polypeptide. Because the tRNA was charged by AlaRS, the attached amino acid is alanine.\n5. Thus, alanine is incorporated at positions specified by cysteine codons. Translation does not stall, and cysteine is not incorporated, because the ribosome does not check the amino acid.\n\nConclusion: The amino acid incorporated is alanine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2030990"}, {"introduction": "To achieve extraordinary levels of accuracy, some synthetases employ a two-step verification process that includes a proofreading or editing function.

The overall fidelity of an aaRS is often achieved through a two-step mechanism: an initial discrimination at the aminoacylation (synthesis) site and a subsequent proofreading step at a separate editing site.\n\nConsider the case of Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which must distinguish its cognate amino acid, isoleucine (Ile), from the structurally similar non-cognate amino acid, valine (Val). In a wild-type cell, the synthesis site of IleRS exhibits a discrimination factor of 100, meaning it preferentially binds isoleucine over valine by a factor of 100. After the amino acid is attached to the tRNA, any incorrectly formed $\\text{Val-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$ is subjected to proofreading.
