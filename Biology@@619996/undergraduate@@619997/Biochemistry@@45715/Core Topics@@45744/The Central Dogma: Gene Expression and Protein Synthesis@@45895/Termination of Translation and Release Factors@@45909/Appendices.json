By predicting the results of an in vitro translation assay, you will solidify your understanding of how prokaryotic Release Factor 1 (**RF1**) and Release Factor 2 (**RF2**) discriminate between different stop codons to ensure the timely conclusion of protein synthesis.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is investigating the molecular mechanism of translation termination in *Escherichia coli*. The researcher sets up a highly purified *in vitro* translation system, which is a cell-free system containing all the necessary components for protein synthesis. The system includes: 70S ribosomes, a full set of initiation and elongation factors, all necessary transfer Ribonucleic Acids (tRNAs) and their corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, an energy source (ATP and GTP), and all 20 standard amino acids. To track protein synthesis, Methionine is supplied in a radiolabeled form, `[35S]-Met`.\n\nThe experimental procedure to measure successful termination involves centrifuging the reaction mixture at high speed to pellet the large ribosome-polypeptide complexes. The amount of released polypeptide is then quantified by measuring the radioactivity present in the supernatant. A high level of radioactivity in the supernatant is indicative of successful termination and release of the nascent polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\nThe researcher prepares two different short synthetic messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) templates:\n- **mRNA-1:** `5'-AUG UUU UUU UAG-3'`\n- **mRNA-2:** `5'-AUG UUU UUU UGA-3'`\n\nFour separate reaction tubes are prepared, each containing the complete *in vitro* translation system. The unique components of each reaction are listed below:\n\n- **Reaction A:** The system is supplemented with mRNA-1, but no release factors are added.\n- **Reaction B:** The system is supplemented with mRNA-1 and purified Release Factor 1 (RF1).\n- **Reaction C:** The system is supplemented with mRNA-2 and purified Release Factor 1 (RF1).\n- **Reaction D:** The system is supplemented with mRNA-2 and purified Release Factor 2 (RF2).\n\nAssuming all components are active and the translation process proceeds up to the stop codon, in which of the reactions would a high level of radioactivity be detected in the supernatant?\n\nA.

Reactions A, B and D only", "solution": "Principles:\n- In Escherichia coli, translation termination requires class I release factors with specific stop-codon recognition: RF1 recognizes UAG and UAA, while RF2 recognizes UGA and UAA. Without the appropriate release factor, the peptidyl-tRNA remains in the ribosome and the nascent polypeptide is not released.\n- The assay measures radiolabeled polypeptide in the supernatant after pelleting ribosome–polypeptide complexes. High supernatant radioactivity indicates successful termination and release; low supernatant radioactivity indicates failure to terminate and retention of the labeled polypeptide on the ribosome.\n\nEvaluation of each reaction:\n- Reaction A (mRNA-1 ends with UAG; no release factors): No termination occurs without release factors, so the labeled polypeptide remains bound to the ribosome and pellets. Supernatant radioactivity is low.\n- Reaction B (mRNA-1 ends with UAG; RF1 present): RF1 recognizes UAG and promotes termination and release of the polypeptide. Supernatant radioactivity is high.\n- Reaction C (mRNA-2 ends with UGA; RF1 present): RF1 does not recognize UGA, so termination does not occur. The polypeptide remains ribosome-bound and pellets. Supernatant radioactivity is low.\n- Reaction D (mRNA-2 ends with UGA; RF2 present): RF2 recognizes UGA and promotes termination and release. Supernatant radioactivity is high.\n\nConclusion: High radioactivity in the supernatant will be detected in Reactions B and D only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2079213"}, {"introduction": "Release factors are sophisticated molecular machines with distinct functions: one part of the protein recognizes the stop codon, while another part catalyzes the release of the new polypeptide. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2079259] explores this division of labor by presenting a hypothetical scenario where the catalytic function is disabled by a mutation in the critical **GGQ** motif. Analyzing this stalled state will deepen your appreciation for the intricate, step-wise mechanism of peptide release, moving beyond simple recognition to the chemistry of termination.", "problem": "In a hypothetical *in vitro* bacterial translation system, a ribosome is translating an mRNA molecule that contains a single UAG stop codon. The system is supplied with all necessary components for translation, including aminoacyl-tRNAs, elongation factors, and initiation factors. However, the system contains a mutant version of Release Factor 1 (RF1). In this mutant RF1, the universally conserved GGQ (Gly-Gly-Gln) catalytic motif, responsible for promoting peptide hydrolysis, has been altered to GAG (Gly-Ala-Gly). This GAG sequence is unable to catalyze the hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond. Assume that the domains responsible for stop codon recognition in the mutant RF1 are unaffected. Other essential factors for termination and recycling, such as Release Factor 3 (RF3) and Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF), are present and fully functional.\n\nWhen the ribosome reaches the UAG stop codon, which of the following descriptions most accurately represents the terminal state of the translational machinery?\n\nA. The ribosome stalls at the stop codon with the complete polypeptide still attached to the tRNA in the P-site. The mutant RF1 and RF3-GTP are bound in the A-site, and ribosome recycling cannot proceed.\n\nB. The mutant RF1 fails to bind to the A-site, causing the ribosome to read through the stop codon and continue elongating the polypeptide with a near-cognate tRNA.\n\nC. The polypeptide is successfully hydrolyzed and released, but the ribosome remains stalled on the mRNA, unable to dissociate into its subunits because RRF cannot bind.\n\nD. The ribosomal subunits immediately dissociate from the mRNA, but the unhydrolyzed polypeptide remains covalently attached to its tRNA, which is released into the cytoplasm.\n\nE. The mutant RF1 binds to the A-site and catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP on RF3, but the subsequent steps of peptide release and ribosome dissociation fail.", "solution": "When a bacterial ribosome encounters a stop codon in the A site, termination requires a class I release factor (RF1 for UAG and UAA; RF2 for UGA and UAA) to recognize the stop codon and use its universally conserved GGQ motif to activate a water molecule that hydrolyzes the ester bond between the nascent polypeptide and the P-site tRNA. In this scenario, the mutant RF1 retains its stop-codon recognition domains but carries a GAG substitution in place of the essential GGQ catalytic motif. Therefore:\n\n1) Recognition and binding: Because the stop-codon recognition domains of RF1 are intact, the mutant RF1 will still specifically recognize and bind the UAG codon in the A site. Near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs are excluded when a cognate factor occupies the A site, so elongation readthrough is not favored under these conditions.\n\n2) Catalysis of peptide release: The GGQ motif is required to position and activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond in the peptidyl transferase center. Substituting GAG abolishes this catalytic function. Consequently, hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond does not occur, and the nascent polypeptide remains covalently attached to the P-site tRNA.\n\n3) RF3 function: RF3 is a class II release factor GTPase that promotes dissociation/turnover of class I release factors after peptide release; its productive engagement and GTP hydrolysis are tightly coupled to the post-termination state generated by successful hydrolysis. In the absence of peptide release, RF1 remains stably bound in the A site, and the RF3 cycle cannot productively proceed to clear RF1. Thus, while RF3 and GTP are present and functional in principle, they do not effect termination or recycling in this pre-termination, peptidyl-tRNA–containing complex.\n\n4) Recycling by RRF: Ribosome Recycling Factor acts, together with EF-G and IF3, on the post-termination complex after peptide release, when a deacylated tRNA resides in the P site. With the polypeptide still attached (no hydrolysis), the complex remains a pre-termination complex and is not a substrate for RRF-mediated recycling. Therefore, ribosome recycling cannot proceed.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- B is incorrect because mutant RF1 still recognizes and binds UAG; readthrough is disfavored.\n- C is incorrect because peptide hydrolysis cannot occur without the GGQ motif.\n- D is incorrect because subunit dissociation and release of a peptidyl-tRNA into the cytoplasm do not occur; the peptidyl-tRNA remains in the ribosome.\n- E is misleading/incorrect because RF3 GTP hydrolysis is normally coupled to the post-termination state; without peptide release, productive RF3-driven turnover does not occur.\n- A correctly describes a stalled complex at the stop codon with the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site, mutant RF1 bound, and recycling blocked. While RF3 may associate, the key outcome is stalling with no peptide release and no recycling.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2079259"}, {"introduction": "Releasing the polypeptide chain is a critical step, but the cell's work isn't finished until the ribosome itself is recycled for the next round of synthesis. This exercise [@problem_id:2079252] examines the crucial final stage of termination by simulating the failure of the Ribosome Recycling Factor (**RRF**). By identifying the specific molecular complex that accumulates, you will gain a holistic view of the entire termination cycle and understand why efficient ribosome recycling is essential for sustained protein production and cellular health.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a novel temperature-sensitive mutant strain of *Escherichia coli*. This strain grows normally at a permissive temperature of 30°C, but its growth is arrested upon shifting to a non-permissive temperature of 42°C. Further investigation reveals that the mutation affects the gene encoding the Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF). At 42°C, the RRF protein rapidly becomes non-functional.\n\nIn bacterial translation, the process of termination and recycling occurs in a series of steps after a stop codon on a messenger RNA (mRNA) enters the A-site of the 70S ribosome. First, a class 1 release factor (RF1 or RF2) recognizes the stop codon and promotes the hydrolytic release of the completed polypeptide chain from the transfer RNA (tRNA) in the P-site. Subsequently, another factor, RF3, facilitates the departure of RF1/RF2. The final stage is ribosome recycling, which is essential for making the ribosome available for a new round of protein synthesis. In this stage, the Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) and Elongation Factor G (EF-G) act together, using energy from the hydrolysis of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), to disassemble the entire post-termination complex. This disassembly releases the mRNA, the uncharged tRNA, and separates the 70S ribosome into its 50S and 30S subunits.\n\nIf the biochemist shifts the bacterial culture from 30°C to the non-permissive temperature of 42°C and allows translation to proceed, which of the following molecular states will be the most direct and predominant consequence of the RRF inactivation?\n\nA. 70S ribosomes stalled at the start codon of mRNA molecules due to a failure in translation initiation.\n\nB. Post-termination complexes consisting of a 70S ribosome, an mRNA, and a deacylated tRNA, which remain stable after the polypeptide has been released.\n\nC. An accumulation of free 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits that are unable to associate to form functional 70S ribosomes.\n\nD. Ribosomes stalled during the elongation phase, with a growing polypeptide chain attached to a tRNA (peptidyl-tRNA) in the P-site.\n\nE. 70S complexes stalled with a release factor (RF1 or RF2) permanently bound to the stop codon, preventing the release of the newly synthesized polypeptide.", "solution": "The core mechanistic sequence at bacterial translation termination and recycling proceeds as follows.\n\n1) Upon entry of a stop codon into the A-site, a class 1 release factor (RF1 or RF2) recognizes the stop codon and catalyzes hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide to the P-site tRNA. This converts peptidyl-tRNA into a deacylated tRNA and releases the completed polypeptide. Symbolically, this step converts a translating complex into a post-release 70S complex still bound to mRNA and a deacylated P-site tRNA.\n\n2) RF3 promotes dissociation of RF1/RF2 from the ribosome after peptide release. Thus, the stop-codon recognition and peptide release steps can complete, leaving a post-termination complex without RF1/RF2.\n\n3) Ribosome recycling requires RRF acting together with EF-G, driven by GTP hydrolysis, to disassemble the post-termination complex. The net reaction can be represented as\n$$\n\\text{(70S}\\cdot\\text{mRNA}\\cdot\\text{deacylated tRNA)}+\\text{RRF}+\\text{EF-G}\\cdot\\text{GTP}\n\\to 50\\text{S}+30\\text{S}+\\text{mRNA}+\\text{tRNA}+\\text{EF-G}\\cdot\\text{GDP}+P_{i}.\n$$\nThis step releases the mRNA and deacylated tRNA and splits the 70S ribosome into free 50S and 30S subunits, enabling new rounds of initiation.\n\nGiven that the mutation specifically inactivates RRF at the non-permissive temperature, step 3 fails while steps 1 and 2 can still occur. Therefore, the immediate and predominant molecular consequence is the accumulation of stable post-termination 70S complexes that have already released the polypeptide but remain bound to mRNA and a deacylated P-site tRNA because recycling (disassembly) cannot proceed without functional RRF.\n\nEliminating incorrect options:\n- A is incorrect because initiation per se is not the primary block; the defect is in recycling, not start-codon recognition or 70S formation for initiation. Any initiation deficit would be secondary to sequestration of ribosomes, whereas the most direct consequence is unrecycled post-termination complexes.\n- C is the opposite of the expected outcome; RRF deficiency prevents, rather than promotes, subunit splitting, so free 50S and 30S would not accumulate.\n- D is incorrect because elongation stalls with peptidyl-tRNA are not the direct consequence of losing RRF; elongation is upstream of termination.\n- E is incorrect because RF3 promotes RF1/RF2 departure, and RRF is required after peptide release; RRF inactivation does not cause RF1/RF2 to remain bound nor does it prevent peptide release.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and predominant consequence is the persistence of post-termination 70S complexes containing mRNA and a deacylated tRNA.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2079252"}]}
