They have isolated a segment of the messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) that is currently being translated by a ribosome. At a specific moment, the ribosome's A-site (aminoacyl site) is occupied by the codon 5'-GCA-3'. For the polypeptide chain to be extended, a specific aminoacyl-transfer Ribonucleic Acid (aminoacyl-tRNA) must deliver the correct amino acid.

The incoming tRNA carries an anticodon that base-pairs with this codon using Watson-Crick rules (A pairs with U, G pairs with C) and binds in an antiparallel orientation (codon 5' to 3' pairs with anticodon 3' to 5').\n\nGiven the mRNA codon 5'-GCA-3', the complementary anticodon sequence in the antiparallel orientation is 3'-CGU-5' (G pairs with C, C pairs with G, A pairs with U).\n\nTo express the anticodon in the conventional 5' to 3' direction, reverse this sequence to obtain 5'-UGC-3'.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. Other options are incorrect because:\n- A (5'-CGU-3') is the correct complement but written in the wrong 5' to 3' orientation relative to the codon.\n- C (5'-GCA-3') repeats the codon, not the anticodon.\n- D (5'-CGT-3') uses T, which is found in DNA, not RNA.\n- E is malformed and does not match the correct sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct anticodon sequence is 5'-UGC-3'.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2042245"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the single codon-anticodon recognition event, this practice scales up our view to the entire elongation phase.

Since each codon has $3$ nucleotides, the total number of codons is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{codon}}=\\frac{1353}{3}=451.\n$$\nOnly sense codons translate into amino acids; the stop codon does not. Therefore, the length of the polypeptide in amino acids is:\n$$\nn=N_{\\text{codon}}-1=450.\n$$\nIn bacterial translation, during elongation each amino acid added after the initiator requires two GTP hydrolyses: one by EF-Tu for aminoacyl-tRNA delivery to the A site and one by EF-G for translocation.
