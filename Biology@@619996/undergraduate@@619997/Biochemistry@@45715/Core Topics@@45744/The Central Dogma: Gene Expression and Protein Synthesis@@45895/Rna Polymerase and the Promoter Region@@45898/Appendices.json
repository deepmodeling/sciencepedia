Successfully determining the mRNA sequence is the first step toward understanding how a gene's information is mobilized for protein synthesis.", "problem": "A segment of a gene in a prokaryotic organism is represented by the following double-stranded DNA sequence. By convention, the top strand is written 5' to 3' and is designated as the coding (or sense) strand.\n\n5'-ATGCGATTACGTTAGGCC-3'\n3'-TACGCTAATGCAATCCGG-5'\n\nDetermine the sequence of the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that would be transcribed from this DNA segment. Your answer should be the sequence of ribonucleotides written from the 5' end to the 3' end, without any spaces or labels.", "solution": "The process of creating a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule from a DNA template is called transcription. To solve this problem, we must apply the fundamental principles of transcription.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the template strand. The problem states that the top strand (5'-ATGCGATTACGTTAGGCC-3') is the coding strand. By definition, the other strand is the template (or antisense) strand, which is the one that RNA polymerase \"reads\" to synthesize the mRNA. Therefore, the template strand is 3'-TACGCTAATGCAATCCGG-5'.\n\nSecond, we must consider the directionality of transcription. The RNA polymerase enzyme moves along the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction. As it reads each DNA base on the template strand, it adds a complementary RNA nucleotide to the growing mRNA chain. The mRNA strand itself is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\n\nThe base-pairing rules for transcription are as follows:\n- If the DNA template has Adenine (A), the mRNA will have Uracil (U).\n- If the DNA template has Thymine (T), the mRNA will have Adenine (A).\n- If the DNA template has Guanine (G), the mRNA will have Cytosine (C).\n- If the DNA template has Cytosine (C), the mRNA will have Guanine (G).\n\nLet's apply these rules by reading the template strand from its 3' end to its 5' end and building the mRNA from its 5' end to its 3' end.\n\nTemplate strand (read 3' to 5'): 3'- T A C G C T A A T G C A A T C C G G -5'\nSynthesized mRNA (built 5' to 3'): 5'- A U G C G A U U A C G U U A G G C C -3'\n\nA common and quicker method is to use the coding strand directly. The sequence of the mRNA transcript is identical to the sequence of the coding DNA strand, with the exception that Uracil (U) is used in place of Thymine (T).\n\nCoding strand: 5'-ATGCGATTACGTTAGGCC-3'\n\nWe replace every 'T' in the coding strand with a 'U':\n- The 'T' at position 2 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 7 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 8 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 12 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 13 becomes 'U'.\n\nApplying this substitution to the entire coding strand gives:\n5'-AUGCGAUUACGUUAGGCC-3'\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The question asks for the sequence written from 5' to 3' without labels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AUGCGAUUACGUUAGGCC}$$", "id": "2073467"}, {"introduction": "Before transcription can begin, RNA polymerase must locate the correct starting point and identify which of the two DNA strands to read. This critical task is guided by promoter sequences, such as the -10 and -35 boxes in bacteria.

This exercise bridges the gap between recognizing DNA sequences and understanding their functional role in initiating gene expression.", "problem": "In prokaryotic gene expression, transcription is initiated when the sigma factor subunit of the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase holoenzyme recognizes specific consensus sequences within a promoter region on the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

These motifs are written in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction on the coding strand.\n- The RNA polymerase then uses the opposite strand (the template) for RNA synthesis. The enzyme reads the template strand in the $3' \\to 5'$ direction while synthesizing RNA in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction.\n- The RNA product has the same sequence as the coding strand (with U in place of T) and is complementary to the template strand.\n\nIdentification of promoter motifs:\n- The top strand is given $5'$-to-$3'$ as: 5'-CCGTTGACACGATTAGCTACGTACGATATAATGCTAGC-3'.\n- On this top strand, the -35 consensus sequence 5'-TTGACA-3' appears as \"TTGACA\" starting near the left (positions 4–9 when counting from the leftmost base).\n- On the same top strand, the -10 consensus sequence 5'-TATAAT-3' appears downstream as \"TATAAT\" (positions 27–32).\n- The order and orientation (5'-TTGACA ... TATAAT-3') on the same strand are consistent with a promoter on the top strand in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction.\n\nDeduction of template and reading direction:\n- Because promoter consensus sequences are defined on the coding strand, the presence of both motifs in correct orientation on the top strand means the top strand is the coding strand.\n- Therefore, the bottom strand is the template strand.\n- RNA polymerase reads the template strand in the $3' \\to 5'$ direction during transcription.\n\nConclusion: The template is the bottom strand, and RNA polymerase reads it $3' \\to 5'$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2073524"}, {"introduction": "While many genes use a standard promoter, bacteria often employ alternative sigma factors to activate specific sets of genes in response to environmental changes.
