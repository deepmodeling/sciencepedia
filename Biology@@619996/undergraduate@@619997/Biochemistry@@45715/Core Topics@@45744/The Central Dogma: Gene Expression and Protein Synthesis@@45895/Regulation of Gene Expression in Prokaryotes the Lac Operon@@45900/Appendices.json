By comparing the effects of glucose and glycerol, you will solidify your understanding of how negative control by the LacI repressor and positive control by CAP work in concert to fine-tune gene expression [@problem_id:2070443].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the regulation of the *lac* operon in a wild-type strain of *Escherichia coli*. The bacteria are grown in four different minimal media, each containing a different combination of carbon sources. The level of gene expression from the *lac* operon is quantified by measuring the activity of β-galactosidase, the protein product of the *lacZ* gene.\n\nThe four experimental conditions are as follows:\nI. Medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source.\nII. Medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source.\nIII. Medium containing both glucose and lactose.\nIV. Medium containing both glycerol and lactose.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, assume that glycerol enters the central metabolic pathway of the cell in a manner that does not significantly inhibit adenylate cyclase activity, a key enzyme in catabolite repression. This is in contrast to glucose, whose transport into the cell strongly inhibits this enzyme.\n\nBased on your understanding of the dual control mechanism of the *lac* operon, which of the following options correctly ranks the conditions from the highest expected level of β-galactosidase activity to the lowest?

Presence of lactose generates allolactose, which binds LacI and relieves repression, making the repressor “off.”\n- Positive control by CAP–cAMP: high intracellular cAMP enables CAP binding upstream of the promoter, stimulating transcription. Glucose transport inhibits adenylate cyclase, lowering cAMP and preventing CAP activation (catabolite repression). By contrast, the problem states glycerol does not significantly inhibit adenylate cyclase, so cAMP remains high in glycerol media.\n- Inducer exclusion with glucose: when glucose is present, the unphosphorylated EIIA component of the phosphotransferase system inhibits LacY (permease), reducing lactose uptake and thereby reducing allolactose formation; this keeps the repressor effectively “on” despite extracellular lactose.\n\nDefine two regulatory states for transcription of the lac operon:\n- Repressor state $R$: $R=0$ means repression relieved (lactose/allolactose present inside the cell), $R=1$ means repression engaged (no inducer).\n- Activator state $A$: $A=1$ means CAP–cAMP present (high cAMP), $A=0$ means CAP–cAMP absent (low cAMP due to glucose).\n\nHigh lac transcription requires $R=0$ and $A=1$; low/basal transcription occurs if either $R=1$ or $A=0$, with the lowest levels when both are unfavorable.\n\nEvaluate each condition:\n\nI. Glucose only:\n- Glucose inhibits adenylate cyclase, so cAMP is low $\\Rightarrow A=0$.\n- No lactose present, so no allolactose; LacI remains bound $\\Rightarrow R=1$.\n- Result: minimal expression (lowest).\n\nII. Lactose only:\n- No glucose, so adenylate cyclase is active; cAMP high $\\Rightarrow A=1$.\n- Lactose enters, generates allolactose; LacI released $\\Rightarrow R=0$.\n- Result: maximal expression.\n\nIII. Glucose + lactose:\n- Glucose present $\\Rightarrow$ low cAMP $\\Rightarrow A=0$.\n- Inducer exclusion reduces lactose uptake, keeping allolactose low; repressor largely remains bound $\\Rightarrow R\\approx 1$.\n- Result: very low expression, but typically slightly higher than glucose alone due to any residual induction; hence higher than I but far below II or IV.\n\nIV. Glycerol + lactose:\n- No glucose repression; glycerol does not inhibit adenylate cyclase $\\Rightarrow$ cAMP high $\\Rightarrow A=1$.\n- Lactose present induces LacI release $\\Rightarrow R=0$.\n- Result: maximal expression, approximately equal to II.\n\nRanking from highest to lowest:\n- II and IV are both maximal and approximately equal: II $=$ IV.\n- III is low but above I: III $>$ I.\nTherefore the correct ordering is II $=$ IV $>$ III $>$ I, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070443"}, {"introduction": "Genetic dissection is a powerful tool for understanding complex biological systems. In this thought experiment, we explore a hypothetical scenario where the lac operator sequence, the binding site for the repressor protein, is completely deleted. This allows us to isolate and observe the function of the positive control system—catabolite repression—without interference from negative control, demonstrating the independent but interconnected nature of these regulatory layers [@problem_id:2070448].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the regulation of gene expression in a genetically engineered strain of *Escherichia coli*. This particular strain has a precise deletion of the lactose (*lac*) operator sequence ($O$) from its genome, but the promoter ($P_{lac}$), the CAP-binding site, and the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, and *lacA*) remain intact and fully functional. The gene for the *lac* repressor (*lacI*) is also present and produces a functional repressor protein.\n\nThe bacteria are grown in two different media. Both media lack lactose. Medium 1 contains glucose as the sole carbon source. Medium 2 contains a different, non-repressing carbon source, but it completely lacks glucose.\n\nHow will the expression level of the *lac* operon's structural genes in this mutant strain compare between the two conditions?\n\nA. The *lac* operon will be expressed at a high level in both Medium 1 and Medium 2.\n\nB. The *lac* operon will not be expressed at all in either medium.\n\nC. The *lac* operon will be expressed at a high level in Medium 1 (with glucose) and at a low level in Medium 2 (without glucose).\n\nD. The *lac* operon will be expressed at a low level in Medium 1 (with glucose) and at a high level in Medium 2 (without glucose).\n\nE. Since the operator is deleted, expression is blocked, but it can be restored to a high level by adding an artificial inducer like IPTG.", "solution": "The regulation of the lactose (*lac*) operon in *E. coli* is controlled by two main mechanisms: negative inducible control via the Lac repressor protein and positive control via the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). To solve this problem, we must analyze how the deletion of the operator sequence affects both regulatory pathways under the specified conditions.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Negative Control System:** The negative control of the *lac* operon is mediated by the *lac* repressor protein, encoded by the *lacI* gene. This repressor protein functions by binding to a specific DNA sequence called the operator ($O$). When bound to the operator, the repressor physically blocks RNA polymerase from initiating transcription of the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*). In a wild-type cell, the presence of allolactose (an isomer of lactose) binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents it from binding to the operator, thus inducing transcription.\n\n    In the described mutant strain, the operator sequence is deleted. This means the Lac repressor protein, although fully functional, has lost its DNA binding site. Without the operator, the repressor cannot bind to the DNA and cannot block RNA polymerase. Therefore, the negative control system is permanently disabled. The operon is said to be \"constitutive\" with respect to the repressor, meaning it is always in the \"on\" state as far as the repressor is concerned. The presence or absence of lactose (or its inducer) becomes irrelevant for this part of the regulation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Positive Control System (Catabolite Repression):** The positive control of the *lac* operon is mediated by CAP and is dependent on the concentration of glucose in the cell. This system ensures that the cell prioritizes using glucose, a more efficient energy source, over other sugars like lactose.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Presence of Glucose (Medium 1):** When glucose is abundant, the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) is low. CAP is only active when it forms a complex with cAMP. Since cAMP levels are low, the CAP-cAMP complex does not form in significant amounts. The role of the active CAP-cAMP complex is to bind to the CAP-binding site near the *lac* promoter and significantly enhance the recruitment and binding of RNA polymerase. Without this assistance from CAP-cAMP, the *lac* promoter is inherently weak, and RNA polymerase binds to it inefficiently. Therefore, even though the repressor is not blocking transcription (due to the operator deletion), transcription proceeds at only a very low, basal level.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Absence of Glucose (Medium 2):** When glucose is absent, the intracellular concentration of cAMP rises. cAMP binds to CAP, forming the active CAP-cAMP complex. This complex then binds to the CAP-binding site on the DNA. This binding event promotes the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, leading to a high rate of transcription initiation. Since the operator is deleted, there is no repressor to interfere with this process. Consequently, the *lac* operon is expressed at a high level.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of both control systems:\n    *   In Medium 1 (with glucose), the absence of positive activation by CAP leads to low-level expression.\n    *   In Medium 2 (without glucose), the presence of positive activation by CAP leads to high-level expression.\n\n    This matches the description in option D.\n    *   Option A is incorrect because it ignores catabolite repression.\n    *   Option B is incorrect because transcription is not blocked, merely inefficient in the presence of glucose.\n    *   Option C incorrectly reverses the effect of glucose on catabolite repression.\n    *   Option E is incorrect because the system is already de-repressed due to the operator deletion; an inducer like IPTG, which acts on the repressor, would have no further effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2070448"}, {"introduction": "To explore how different gene variants interact, geneticists often use merodiploids, which are bacterial cells containing a second copy of a specific gene region. This final practice uses a merodiploid to investigate the \"super-repressor\" allele, $I^s$, whose protein product cannot be inactivated by an inducer. By analyzing its effect in a cell that also contains a wild-type repressor allele, $I^+$, you will gain deeper insight into the concepts of trans-acting regulatory factors and genetic dominance [@problem_id:2070479].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the metabolism of lactose is controlled by the lac operon. This system involves several key genetic components: the regulatory gene `lacI`, which codes for a repressor protein; the operator site `lacO`, where the repressor protein binds to block transcription; and the structural gene `lacZ`, which codes for the enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase that breaks down lactose.\n\nSeveral alleles exist for these genes:\n- `$I^+$`: The wild-type allele for the repressor, which is inactivated by the presence of an inducer (a lactose derivative).\n- `$I^s$`: The \"super-repressor\" allele, which codes for a repressor protein that cannot bind the inducer and thus remains permanently active.\n- `$O^+$`: The wild-type operator site that can be bound by the repressor.\n- `$Z^+$`: The wild-type allele for the `lacZ` gene, producing a functional $\\beta$-galactosidase enzyme.\n\nConsider a merodiploid strain of *E. coli*, which is partially diploid due to the presence of an F' plasmid carrying a segment of the bacterial chromosome.

Because lacI acts in trans, both the $I^+$ and $I^s$ repressor proteins diffuse and can bind either $O^+$ site. In the absence of inducer, both $I^+$ and $I^s$ repressors are active and will bind $O^+$, blocking transcription from both operons. In the presence of inducer, the $I^+$ repressor is inactivated by inducer and dissociates from $O^+$, but the $I^s$ repressor cannot bind inducer and remains active; it continues to bind $O^+$ and block transcription. Since any occupancy of $O^+$ by an active repressor is sufficient to prevent transcription initiation, the presence of even a single $I^s$ repressor in the cell is dominant over $I^+$ with respect to repression.\n\nTherefore, in both the absence and presence of lactose (inducer), the $I^s$ repressor maintains repression at both $O^+$ sites. Consequently, neither $Z^+$ allele is transcribed, and no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is synthesized under any condition.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that the strain will be unable to synthesize functional $\\beta$-galactosidase regardless of lactose presence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070479"}]}
