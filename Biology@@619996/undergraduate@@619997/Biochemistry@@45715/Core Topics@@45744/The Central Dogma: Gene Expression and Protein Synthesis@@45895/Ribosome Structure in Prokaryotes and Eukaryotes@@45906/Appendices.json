This exercise asks you to apply this knowledge in an evolutionary context, by considering the unique case of organelles within eukaryotic cells. By reasoning from the endosymbiotic theory, you can make a concrete prediction about the type of ribosome you would expect to find in chloroplasts, reinforcing the deep connection between evolutionary history and modern cellular architecture [@problem_id:2072931].", "problem": "In biological systems, ribosomes are the cellular machineries responsible for protein synthesis. Their size is often characterized by their sedimentation rate in a centrifuge, measured in Svedberg units (S). Prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria, typically possess 70S ribosomes. In contrast, the cytoplasm of eukaryotic organisms, such as plants and animals, contains larger 80S ribosomes.\n\nEukaryotic cells contain various membrane-bound organelles, each with a specific function. One such organelle found in plant cells is the chloroplast, the site of photosynthesis. The endosymbiotic theory provides a widely accepted explanation for the origin of certain eukaryotic organelles, including chloroplasts.\n\nConsidering the fundamental principles of cell biology and the endosymbiotic theory, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the type of ribosome found within a plant cell's chloroplast and provides the correct justification?\n\nA. 70S, because chloroplasts are structurally simpler than the eukaryotic cell they inhabit.\n\nB. 70S, because the endosymbiotic theory posits that chloroplasts evolved from an engulfed prokaryotic ancestor.\n\nC. 80S, because chloroplasts are organelles that exist and function exclusively within a eukaryotic host cell.\n\nD. 80S, because the complex biochemical pathways of photosynthesis require larger, more efficient ribosomes for protein synthesis.\n\nE. A specialized 75S hybrid ribosome, resulting from co-evolution between the engulfed organism and the eukaryotic host cell over millions of years.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the key cellular biology facts relevant to ribosome types and their distribution:\n1. Prokaryotic ribosomes are characterized as 70S by their sedimentation coefficient, while the cytosolic ribosomes of eukaryotes are typically 80S.\n2. Eukaryotic organelles of endosymbiotic origin, specifically mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain their own ribosomes that are prokaryote-like in composition and size.\n3. The endosymbiotic theory asserts that chloroplasts descended from free-living prokaryotic organisms (cyanobacteria-like ancestors) that were engulfed by a eukaryotic host and established a symbiotic relationship. Consequently, chloroplasts retained several prokaryotic features, including their own circular DNA and 70S ribosomes.\n\nUsing these principles, we evaluate the options:\n- Option A (70S because chloroplasts are structurally simpler) is incorrect because structural simplicity relative to the host cell is not the explanatory principle; evolutionary origin is. The defining reason is ancestry, not present-day comparative complexity.\n- Option B (70S because of endosymbiotic origin from a prokaryote) is correct. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, retain prokaryote-type ribosomes (70S), consistent with their derivation from an engulfed prokaryotic ancestor as posited by the endosymbiotic theory.\n- Option C (80S because chloroplasts are within a eukaryote) is incorrect. While the host cytosol uses 80S ribosomes, chloroplasts maintain their own translation machinery that is prokaryotic in character (70S).\n- Option D (80S due to photosynthesis complexity) is incorrect. Sedimentation coefficient is not a proxy for biochemical pathway complexity or efficiency, and chloroplasts demonstrably use 70S ribosomes.\n- Option E (a 75S hybrid) is incorrect. There is no established 75S chloroplast ribosome class; organellar ribosomes in chloroplasts are consistently described as 70S. Moreover, Svedberg units reflect sedimentation behavior and are not additive or interpolated through “hybridization” in the manner suggested.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction and justification is that chloroplasts contain 70S ribosomes due to their prokaryotic endosymbiotic origin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2072931"}, {"introduction": "Moving from broad classification to molecular mechanics, this problem focuses on a critical step in prokaryotic protein synthesis: the precise initiation of translation. The recognition of the starting point on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule is not random; it depends on a specific structural interaction between the ribosome and the mRNA. This thought experiment challenges you to predict the direct functional consequence of disrupting a key part of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), illustrating how the ribosome’s RNA components act as active players in decoding genetic information [@problem_id:2072899].", "problem": "In prokaryotic organisms, the initiation of protein synthesis (translation) is a highly regulated process. It begins with the formation of an initiation complex, which requires the smaller ribosomal subunit (30S) to bind to a specific site on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This binding site, known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, is a purine-rich region located several nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon. The 30S ribosomal subunit is a complex of proteins and a single 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecule.\n\nImagine a strain of bacteria that harbors a specific mutation in the gene encoding its 16S rRNA. This mutation alters a sequence of nucleotides located at the extreme 3'-terminus of the final 16S rRNA molecule. Which of the following steps in the translation process would be the most direct and immediate consequence of this specific mutation?\n\nA. The binding of the 30S ribosomal subunit to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the mRNA.\n\nB. The catalytic activity of peptidyl transferase in forming the first peptide bond.\n\nC. The association of the 50S large ribosomal subunit to form the complete 70S ribosome.\n\nD. The binding of the initiator formylmethionyl-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) to the P-site of the 30S subunit.\n\nE. The scanning of the mRNA from the 5' cap to locate the first start codon.", "solution": "The key principle in bacterial translation initiation is the base-pairing between the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence on the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence located at the extreme 3′ end of the 16S rRNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit. This interaction positions the start codon in the P-site of the 30S subunit and is the earliest specific recognition event in prokaryotic initiation.\n\nGiven a mutation at the extreme 3′ terminus of the 16S rRNA, the most direct effect is disruption of the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which would impair or prevent correct base-pairing with the SD sequence on the mRNA. The immediate consequence is defective binding/recognition of the mRNA by the 30S subunit at the SD site.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A. This describes the SD–anti-SD interaction; this step is directly dependent on the 3′ end of 16S rRNA and is therefore the most immediate consequence.\n- B. Peptidyl transferase activity resides in the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit; not directly affected by a 16S 3′ end mutation.\n- C. Association of the 50S subunit occurs after proper 30S–mRNA–initiator tRNA complex formation; any effect here would be secondary.\n- D. Binding of fMet-tRNA to the P-site requires correct positioning of the start codon via SD pairing; this would be indirectly affected, not the most immediate consequence of the specific mutation.\n- E. Scanning from a 5′ cap is a eukaryotic mechanism; prokaryotes lack a 5′ cap and do not scan, so this is not applicable.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is impaired binding of the 30S subunit to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2072899"}, {"introduction": "Much of our detailed knowledge of the ribosome comes from clever biochemical experiments that probe its intricate structure. This final practice places you in the role of a researcher tasked with interpreting experimental data to understand how an antibiotic works. You will analyze the results of a chemical footprinting experiment, a powerful technique used to map how the binding of a molecule like the antibiotic spectinomycin alters the conformation of ribosomal RNA. This exercise [@problem_id:2072907] provides hands-on practice in deducing a molecular mechanism from experimental evidence, a crucial skill in biochemistry.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the mechanism of action of spectinomycin, an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. The focus of the study is helix 44 (h44) of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key component of the decoding center. The experiment utilizes chemical footprinting with Dimethyl Sulfate (DMS) to probe the accessibility of RNA bases. DMS is a chemical probe that methylates the Watson-Crick face of accessible nucleotides, specifically the N1 position of adenine (A) and the N3 position of cytosine (C). These positions are typically protected from methylation when involved in base pairing or other tertiary interactions. The sites of methylation are subsequently identified by primer extension analysis, where reverse transcriptase terminates synthesis one nucleotide 3' to the modified base. A decrease in DMS reactivity upon ligand binding is observed as 'protection', indicating the base has become less accessible.\n\nThe experiment is conducted under two conditions: (1) isolated 70S ribosomes from *E. coli*, and (2) 70S ribosomes pre-incubated with a saturating concentration of spectinomycin. The following observations are made regarding specific nucleotides in h44:\n\n1.  In the absence of spectinomycin, nucleotide A1408 shows moderate reactivity with DMS.\n2.  In the presence of spectinomycin, the DMS reactivity of A1408 is strongly diminished (i.e., it is protected).\n3.  Nucleotides C1407 and G1494, which form a canonical Watson-Crick base pair adjacent to A1408, are unreactive to DMS in both the presence and absence of spectinomycin.\n4.  A well-known spectinomycin resistance mutation is C1192U, located in a different helix (h34) that is spatially close to the spectinomycin binding pocket.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions provides the most direct and plausible explanation for the effect of spectinomycin on the ribosome?\n\nA. Spectinomycin binds in a pocket on the 30S subunit and stabilizes a conformation of h44 where the N1 position of A1408 is no longer solvent-accessible.\n\nB. Spectinomycin causes A1408 to form a new Watson-Crick base pair, thus protecting it from DMS modification.\n\nC. Spectinomycin functions as a competitive inhibitor of DMS, binding covalently to the N1 position of A1408 and preventing methylation.\n\nD. The binding of spectinomycin causes a large-scale dissociation of the 70S ribosome into its 30S and 50S subunits, leading to the protection of A1408.\n\nE. Spectinomycin binding triggers the enzymatic methylation of A1408 by a ribosomal modification enzyme, making the site appear protected from subsequent DMS action.", "solution": "Principles and assay readout:\n- Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) methylates the Watson-Crick face of accessible nucleotides at the N1 position of adenine and the N3 position of cytosine. When these positions are engaged in Watson-Crick base pairing or buried by tertiary interactions, they become less accessible and therefore less reactive to DMS.\n- In primer extension mapping, reverse transcriptase stops one nucleotide 3' of a methylated base, so decreased stop intensity at a given site upon ligand addition is interpreted as protection, i.e., reduced chemical accessibility of that base.\n- Thus, a decrease in DMS reactivity at A indicates either a new base-pairing interaction at the adenine N1 or a ligand-induced conformational or steric change that shields the N1 from solvent, without necessarily creating a canonical base pair.\n\nApplying the observations:\n1. A1408 shows moderate DMS reactivity without spectinomycin. This implies that in the unliganded state, the N1 of A1408 is at least partially solvent-exposed and not strictly sequestered by stable base pairing or tertiary contacts.\n2. In the presence of spectinomycin, A1408 becomes strongly protected. This directly indicates that spectinomycin binding reduces the solvent accessibility of the A1408 N1, either by inducing local conformational rearrangement that buries it or by steric occlusion from the ligand or neighboring RNA/protein elements.\n3. C1407 and G1494 form a canonical Watson-Crick base pair adjacent to A1408 and remain unreactive in both conditions. This indicates that the local canonical base pairing in this segment of h44 is intact and not detectably perturbed by spectinomycin. Therefore, spectinomycin does not globally disrupt the h44 helix nor does it alter the C1407–G1494 pairing state. Any proposed mechanism should be consistent with this stability.\n4. The resistance mutation C1192U in h34 lies near the spectinomycin binding pocket, supporting that spectinomycin binds at the h34–h44 interface and stabilizes a particular conformation of the decoding center.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A: Spectinomycin stabilizes a conformation of h44 in which the N1 of A1408 is not solvent-accessible. This is a direct and parsimonious interpretation of the observed protection of A1408, requires no new base-pair partner, and is fully consistent with the unaltered canonical pairing at C1407–G1494 and with resistance mapping near the binding pocket.\n- Option B: A new Watson-Crick base pair involving A1408 would explain protection but would require identification of a specific partner and a rearrangement sufficient to permit pairing. Such a rearrangement would often have collateral effects on neighboring reactivity patterns. The maintained unreactivity of the adjacent C1407–G1494 pair (and the lack of reported new protections elsewhere) argues against a new canonical pairing of A1408 as the most direct explanation.\n- Option C: Spectinomycin acting as a competitive, covalent inhibitor of DMS at A1408 N1 is chemically implausible. Spectinomycin is not a methylating reagent, does not covalently modify A1408, and its known mechanism involves noncovalent binding to the 30S subunit.\n- Option D: Dissociation of the 70S into subunits is not supported by these site-specific protection data and is not a known primary effect of spectinomycin at saturating concentrations under standard conditions. Moreover, dissociation would not selectively protect A1408 while leaving adjacent canonical pairing unchanged.\n- Option E: Enzymatic methylation of A1408 induced by spectinomycin is not supported by known rRNA modification pathways in this context. If A1408 were enzymatically methylated, primer extension stops would be observed even in the absence of DMS, and the pattern would not present simply as DMS protection upon ligand addition.\n\nConclusion:\nThe observation that A1408 becomes protected upon spectinomycin binding, while the adjacent canonical base pair remains unchanged and a resistance mutation maps near the binding pocket, is most directly and plausibly explained by spectinomycin stabilizing a conformation of h44 that reduces solvent access to the N1 of A1408.
