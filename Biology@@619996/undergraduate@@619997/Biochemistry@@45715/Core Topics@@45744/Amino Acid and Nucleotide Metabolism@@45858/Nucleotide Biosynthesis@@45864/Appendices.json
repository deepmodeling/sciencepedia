This exercise invites you to perform a \"biochemical accounting\" of the energy required to construct the parent purine nucleotide, IMP, from scratch. By tallying the high-energy phosphate bonds consumed, you will gain a step-by-step appreciation for the energetic investment needed for this essential pathway and the critical distinction between ATP hydrolysis to ADP versus AMP. [@problem_id:2060548]", "problem": "In rapidly proliferating animal cells, the *de novo* biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly active to meet the demands for DNA and RNA synthesis. This pathway assembles the purine ring structure onto an activated ribose sugar. The process begins with Ribose-5-Phosphate (R5P) and culminates in the formation of the parent purine nucleotide, Inosine Monophosphate (IMP).\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you are to calculate the total energetic cost of this synthesis. Assume that all necessary small molecule precursors (such as glycine, glutamine, aspartate, and carbon dioxide) and cofactors (such as N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate) are readily available and their own synthesis does not contribute to the cost calculation.\n\nThe energetic cost is to be tallied in terms of \"high-energy phosphate bonds\" consumed. The hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) is counted as the consumption of one high-energy phosphate bond. The hydrolysis of ATP to Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate ($PP_i$) is counted as the consumption of two high-energy phosphate bonds.\n\nCalculate the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds consumed to synthesize one molecule of IMP, starting from one molecule of R5P, via the *de novo* pathway in animal cells.", "solution": "To determine the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds consumed in the synthesis of one molecule of Inosine Monophosphate (IMP) from Ribose-5-Phosphate (R5P), we must systematically account for every ATP-dependent step in the pathway. The cost is defined such that ATP → ADP + $P_i$ is 1 bond and ATP → AMP + $PP_i$ is 2 bonds.\n\nThe pathway can be broken down into the following key steps with energetic costs:\n\n1.  **Activation of Ribose-5-Phosphate:** The pathway begins with the activation of R5P to 5-Phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). This reaction is catalyzed by PRPP synthetase.\n    $$ \\text{Ribose-5-Phosphate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{PRPP} + \\text{AMP} $$\n    In this step, ATP is hydrolyzed to AMP. According to the problem definition, this consumes **2** high-energy phosphate bonds.\n\n2.  **Formation of 5-Phosphoribosylamine:** PRPP reacts with glutamine. This step does not consume ATP.\n\n3.  **Incorporation of Glycine:** The first part of the purine ring is formed by adding glycine to 5-phosphoribosylamine to form glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR). This reaction requires energy from ATP hydrolysis.\n    $$ \\text{5-Phosphoribosylamine} + \\text{Glycine} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{GAR} + \\text{ADP} + P_i $$\n    Here, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP. This consumes **1** high-energy phosphate bond.\n\n4.  **Formylation of GAR:** The glycinamide ribonucleotide is formylated using N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate. This step does not consume ATP.\n\n5.  **Amidation of FGAR:** The formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) is converted to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) using glutamine as the nitrogen donor. This reaction is driven by ATP hydrolysis.\n    $$ \\text{FGAR} + \\text{Glutamine} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{FGAM} + \\text{Glutamate} + \\text{ADP} + P_i $$\n    This ATP → ADP conversion consumes **1** high-energy phosphate bond.\n\n6.  **First Ring Closure:** The five-membered imidazole ring is formed from FGAM to produce 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR). This cyclization step is ATP-dependent.\n    $$ \\text{FGAM} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{AIR} + \\text{ADP} + P_i $$\n    This ATP → ADP conversion consumes **1** high-energy phosphate bond.\n\n7.  **Carboxylation of AIR:** The AIR molecule is carboxylated to form carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR). In animal cells, this step does not require ATP. (In some microorganisms, this step is ATP-dependent). Cost is **0**.\n\n8.  **Incorporation of Aspartate:** The nitrogen and carbon atoms from aspartate are added to CAIR to form N-succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (SAICAR). This reaction requires ATP.\n    $$ \\text{CAIR} + \\text{Aspartate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{SAICAR} + \\text{ADP} + P_i $$\n    This ATP → ADP conversion consumes **1** high-energy phosphate bond.\n\n9.  **Elimination of Fumarate:** Fumarate is cleaved from SAICAR to form 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). This step does not consume ATP.\n\n10. **Second Formylation:** AICAR is formylated using N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to form N-formylaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR). This step does not consume ATP.\n\n11. **Second Ring Closure:** The final step is the closure of the second ring to form the final purine structure of Inosine Monophosphate (IMP). This cyclization reaction releases a water molecule and does not consume ATP.\n\nNow, we sum the costs from each ATP-dependent step:\n-   Step 1 (PRPP synthesis): 2 bonds\n-   Step 3 (GAR synthesis): 1 bond\n-   Step 5 (FGAM synthesis): 1 bond\n-   Step 6 (AIR synthesis): 1 bond\n-   Step 8 (SAICAR synthesis): 1 bond\n\nTotal cost = $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6$ high-energy phosphate bonds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2060548"}, {"introduction": "A powerful method for studying metabolic pathways is to observe the effects of specific inhibitors, a cornerstone of drug discovery.
