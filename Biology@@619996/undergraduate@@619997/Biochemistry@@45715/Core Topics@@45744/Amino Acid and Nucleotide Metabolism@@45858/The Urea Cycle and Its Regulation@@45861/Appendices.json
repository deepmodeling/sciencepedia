Glutamine serves as a key non-toxic carrier of amino groups from peripheral tissues, such as muscle, to the liver.\n\nConsider a single nitrogen atom that begins as part of the amide side chain of a glutamine molecule within a muscle cell. Below is a list of five events that are part of this nitrogen atom's journey to becoming part of a urea molecule.\n\n*   **Event 1**: A molecule of urea containing the nitrogen atom is produced by the action of arginase in the liver cytosol.\n*   **Event 2**: The glutamine molecule carrying the nitrogen atom travels through the bloodstream from the muscle to the liver.\n*   **Event 3**: The nitrogen atom is incorporated into carbamoyl phosphate by the enzyme Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS I) within a liver mitochondrion.\n*   **Event 4**: Free ammonium ($\\text{NH}_4^+$) containing the nitrogen atom is released from glutamine by the enzyme glutaminase within a liver mitochondrion.\n*   **Event 5**: The nitrogen atom, as part of carbamoyl phosphate, is transferred to ornithine to form citrulline within a liver mitochondrion.\n\nWhich of the following options lists these five events in the correct chronological order?\n\nA. 2, 4, 3, 5, 1\n\nB. 2, 3, 4, 5, 1\n\nC. 4, 2, 3, 1, 5\n\nD. 2, 4, 5, 3, 1\n\nE. 2, 4, 3, 1, 5", "solution": "We identify the compartments and enzymes involved in the nitrogen’s path from the amide group of glutamine in muscle to urea in the liver.\n\nFirst, the nitrogen is carried safely from muscle to liver as part of glutamine.

This thought experiment uses isotopic labeling, a powerful technique in biochemistry, to ask a fundamental question: what are the specific origins of the two nitrogen atoms in urea? By tracing the labeled nitrogen from aspartate, you will reinforce your understanding of how the cycle's stoichiometry is carefully constructed from two different nitrogen sources. [@problem_id:2085207]", "problem": "The urea cycle is a critical metabolic pathway in terrestrial vertebrates for the detoxification and excretion of excess nitrogen, primarily derived from amino acid catabolism. The final product, urea, has the chemical formula $\\text{CO}(\\text{NH}_2)_2$ and contains two nitrogen atoms. One of these nitrogen atoms is sourced from free ammonia (in the form of carbamoyl phosphate), while the other is supplied by the alpha-amino group of the amino acid aspartate.\n\nConsider a metabolic tracing experiment in which a culture of liver cells is supplied with a specially synthesized batch of aspartate. In this batch, the nitrogen atom of the alpha-amino group has been isotopically labeled with ${}^{15}\\text{N}$, while all other atoms in the system, including the nitrogen in free ammonia, are the common ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ isotope. After allowing the urea cycle to proceed, a sample of the newly synthesized urea is isolated and analyzed.

The nitrogen atom derived from free ammonia will be labeled with ${}^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\nB. The nitrogen atom derived from the aspartate molecule will be labeled with ${}^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\nC. Both nitrogen atoms in the urea molecule will be equally labeled with ${}^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\nD. The labeling will be randomly distributed, with a 50% chance for either nitrogen atom to be labeled.\n\nE. Neither nitrogen atom in the urea molecule will be labeled, as the labeled group is lost before incorporation.", "solution": "We must identify which nitrogen in urea originates from which precursor in the urea cycle and then apply the isotopic labeling described.\n\nThe urea cycle incorporates two nitrogen atoms into urea. One nitrogen comes from free ammonia via carbamoyl phosphate, and the other comes from the alpha-amino group of aspartate. In the experiment, only the alpha-amino nitrogen of aspartate is labeled as ${}^{15}\\text{N}$; the ammonia pool and all other atoms are ${}^{14}\\text{N}$.\n\nStep-by-step tracing:\n1) Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I reaction:\n$$ {}^{14}\\text{NH}_3 + \\text{HCO}_3^- + 2\\ \\text{ATP} \\to \\text{carbamoyl phosphate with } {}^{14}\\text{N}. $$\nThus, the nitrogen of carbamoyl phosphate is ${}^{14}\\text{N}$.\n\n2) Ornithine transcarbamylase:\nCarbamoyl phosphate transfers its carbamoyl group to ornithine to form citrulline. The ureido group nitrogen in citrulline remains the one from free ammonia and is ${}^{14}\\text{N}$.\n\n3) Argininosuccinate synthetase:\nCitrulline condenses with aspartate, incorporating the alpha-amino nitrogen of aspartate into the guanidino group of argininosuccinate. Since the alpha-amino nitrogen of aspartate is ${}^{15}\\text{N}$, this newly incorporated nitrogen is ${}^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\n4) Argininosuccinate lyase:\nArgininosuccinate is cleaved to arginine and fumarate. The arginine guanidino group now contains two nitrogens: one ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ from the original carbamoyl phosphate (via citrulline) and one ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ from aspartate.\n\n5) Arginase:\nArginine is hydrolyzed to urea and ornithine. The urea inherits both guanidino nitrogens from arginine: one ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ (derived from ammonia) and one ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ (derived from aspartate). There is no scrambling step in the cycle that would randomize or exchange these nitrogens under the described conditions.\n\nTherefore, in the isolated urea, the nitrogen derived from aspartate will be labeled with ${}^{15}\\text{N}$, while the nitrogen derived from free ammonia will remain ${}^{14}\\text{N}$.
