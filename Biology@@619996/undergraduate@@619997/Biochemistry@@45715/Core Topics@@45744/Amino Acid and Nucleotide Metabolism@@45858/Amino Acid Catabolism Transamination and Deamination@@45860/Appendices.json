This process is essential for nitrogen excretion and for providing carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis.\n\nThe first step is a transamination reaction catalyzed by Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT). In this reaction, alanine transfers its amino group to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate.\n\nThe second step is the oxidative deamination of the amino acid product from the first step. This reaction is catalyzed by Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) which utilizes a specific coenzyme, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD⁺), for oxidation. This step regenerates the $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate used in the first step and releases an ammonium ion.\n\nAssume that all metabolic intermediates, such as $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate and glutamate, are part of a catalytic cycle and are regenerated, and therefore do not appear as net reactants or products in the overall process.

This consumption of pyruvate lowers $[\\text{pyruvate}]$ and thermodynamically pulls the ALT reaction forward.\n\nConcurrently, nitrogen disposal is active via the urea cycle.
