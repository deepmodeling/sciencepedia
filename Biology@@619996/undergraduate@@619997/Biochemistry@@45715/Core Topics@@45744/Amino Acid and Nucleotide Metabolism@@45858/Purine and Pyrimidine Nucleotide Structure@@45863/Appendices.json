Consider a specific nucleotide that is constructed from three components: a pyrimidine base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. The base is cytosine, which is covalently attached to a ribose sugar. This nucleoside then has a single phosphate group esterified to the 5'-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety.\n\nWhat is the standard three-letter abbreviation for this molecule?\n\nA. CMP\n\nB. dCMP\n\nC. UMP\n\nD. AMP\n\nE. CDP", "solution": "The problem asks for the standard three-letter abbreviation of a nucleotide composed of cytosine, ribose, and one phosphate group. We can determine the abbreviation by systematically analyzing the components and the naming conventions for nucleotides.\n\n1.  **Identify the Base and Sugar to form the Nucleoside:** The base is specified as cytosine, which is a pyrimidine. The sugar is specified as ribose. In biochemistry, a molecule formed by linking a nitrogenous base to a sugar is called a nucleoside. The specific nucleoside formed from cytosine and ribose is named **cytidine**. The corresponding one-letter symbol for this nucleoside in abbreviations is 'C'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Number of Phosphate Groups:** The problem states that a **single** phosphate group is attached to the 5' position of the ribose. The number of phosphates is indicated by a letter: 'M' for mono- (one), 'D' for di- (two), and 'T' for tri- (three). Since there is a single phosphate, the correct letter is 'M'.\n\n3.  **Identify the Phosphate Moiety:** The \"phosphate\" part of the name is universally abbreviated as 'P'.\n\n4.  **Construct the Three-Letter Abbreviation:** By combining the symbols for the nucleoside, the number of phosphates, and the phosphate group itself, we get the standard three-letter abbreviation.\n    -   Nucleoside: Cytidine -> C\n    -   Number of Phosphates: Mono -> M\n    -   Phosphate: Phosphate -> P\n    -   Combining these gives **CMP**. The full name is Cytidine Monophosphate.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Other Options:**\n    -   **B. dCMP:** The prefix 'd' stands for deoxy-. This abbreviation represents deoxycytidine monophosphate, which contains a deoxyribose sugar, not the ribose sugar specified in the problem.\n    -   **C. UMP:** The letter 'U' stands for uridine, the nucleoside formed from the base uracil. The problem specified the base cytosine.\n    -   **D. AMP:** The letter 'A' stands for adenosine, the nucleoside formed from the purine base adenine. The problem specified the pyrimidine base cytosine.\n    -   **E. CDP:** The letter 'D' stands for diphosphate, indicating two phosphate groups (Cytidine Diphosphate). The problem specified a single phosphate group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct abbreviation for the described molecule is CMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2067713"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their names, the chemical properties of nucleotides dictate their biological behavior and utility in the lab. This conceptual problem explores why nucleotides carry a net negative charge at a physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$ of 7, a feature that their parent nucleosides lack [@problem_id:2067722]. Understanding the acid-base properties of the phosphate group is crucial for grasping why DNA and RNA are polyanions and for designing separation techniques like electrophoresis and chromatography.", "problem": "Consider the structures of the purine nucleoside adenosine and its corresponding nucleotide, adenosine monophosphate (AMP). At a physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$ of 7.0, experimental measurements show that adenosine is an electrically neutral molecule, while AMP carries a significant net negative charge. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical explanation for this difference in charge?\n\nA. The hydroxyl groups on the ribose sugar of a nucleotide are more acidic than those on a nucleoside, leading to deprotonation and a negative charge at $\\mathrm{pH}$ 7.0.\n\nB. The nitrogenous base (adenine) is deprotonated and negatively charged in a nucleotide at $\\mathrm{pH}$ 7.0, whereas in a nucleoside it remains protonated and neutral.\n\nC. A nucleotide contains a phosphate group which has ionizable protons with pKa values below 7.0, causing it to be deprotonated and negatively charged, a group that is absent in a nucleoside.\n\nD. The N-glycosidic bond that links the base to the sugar is stable in a nucleoside but becomes polarized in a nucleotide, creating a permanent negative charge on the molecule at $\\mathrm{pH}$ 7.0.\n\nE. Both molecules contain ionizable groups, but the overall folded structure of AMP at $\\mathrm{pH}$ 7.0 sequesters positive charges while exposing negative charges, leading to a net anionic character.", "solution": "We compare the ionizable functional groups present in a nucleoside (adenosine) versus a nucleotide (AMP) and use acid-base equilibria to infer charge at physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\nAdenosine (a nucleoside) contains the adenine base linked by an $N$-glycosidic bond to a ribose sugar. The relevant potentially ionizable groups are the ribose hydroxyls and ring nitrogens of adenine. For the ribose hydroxyls, alcohol $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ values satisfy $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} \\gg 7.0$, so at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$ these hydroxyls remain protonated and neutral. The adenine base is a weak base that can be protonated at low $\\mathrm{pH}$ to give a cation; it does not become an anion by deprotonation at neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$. Thus, at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, adenosine has no group with a $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ value near or below 7.0 that would be deprotonated to yield a negative charge, so it is neutral overall.\n\nAMP (a nucleotide) contains the same nucleoside moiety plus a phosphate monoester. A phosphate monoester has two acidic protons available (one is replaced by esterification), with acid dissociation constants such that $\\mathrm{p}K_{a,1}  7.0$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{a,2} \\lesssim 7.0$. Applying the Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch relation,\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH}=\\mathrm{p}K_{a}+\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right),\n$$\nwhen $\\mathrm{pH} > \\mathrm{p}K_a$, it follows that $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}] > [\\mathrm{HA}]$, so each such acidic proton is predominantly deprotonated at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$. Therefore, the phosphate group in AMP is deprotonated to give a significant net negative charge at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$. This ionizable phosphate is absent in adenosine.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: ribose hydroxyls are weakly acidic with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} \\gg 7.0$, so they are not deprotonated at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$ in either molecule.\n- B is incorrect: the adenine base does not become negatively charged by deprotonation at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$; rather, it is neutral at this $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n- C is correct: the presence of a phosphate group in a nucleotide introduces acidic protons with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ values below or near $7.0$, leading to deprotonation and a net negative charge at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, which a nucleoside lacks.\n- D is incorrect: the $N$-glycosidic bond does not become polarized to create a permanent negative charge at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$.\n- E is incorrect: these small molecules do not rely on a folded structure to sequester or expose charges; the net charge is dictated by acid-base equilibria of their functional groups.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate chemical explanation is the presence and deprotonation of the phosphate group in AMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2067722"}, {"introduction": "Let's now apply our structural knowledge to a practical laboratory scenario common in biochemical research.
