This exercise simulates such an experiment, challenging you to follow a labeled nitrogen atom through the catabolism of the purine guanine. By predicting the final location of the label, you will reinforce your knowledge of the steps leading to uric acid and the crucial principle that the purine ring remains intact during this process in humans [@problem_id:2060740].", "problem": "In a metabolic tracing experiment designed to study purine catabolism in humans, a sample of guanine is synthesized with a heavy nitrogen isotope, $^{15}$N, located specifically at the N-7 position of its purine ring structure. This isotopically labeled guanine is then administered to a system where it is fully degraded to the final excretory product characteristic of human purine metabolism. Assuming the biochemical pathway proceeds without any rearrangement of the purine ring skeleton, what is the final location of the $^{15}$N isotope?\n\nA. The nitrogen atom at position 1 of uric acid.\n\nB. The nitrogen atom at position 3 of uric acid.\n\nC. The nitrogen atom at position 7 of uric acid.\n\nD. The nitrogen atom at position 9 of uric acid.\n\nE. The label is released as free ammonia ($NH_3$).", "solution": "The relevant biochemical principle is that in human purine catabolism the purine ring is not cleaved; guanine is converted to xanthine and then to uric acid with retention of the ring nitrogens. The only nitrogen that is released as free ammonia during this pathway comes from the exocyclic amino group at C-2 of guanine during deamination.\n\nStart with guanine labeled specifically at N-7 with $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$:\n- Guanine undergoes deamination by guanine deaminase to form xanthine, releasing the exocyclic C-2 amino nitrogen as $NH_3$. Since the label is at N-7 (a ring nitrogen), it is not the nitrogen removed in this step. Symbolically:\n$$\\text{Guanine(}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}\\text{ at N-7)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{deamination}} \\text{Xanthine(}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}\\text{ at N-7)} + \\text{NH}_3$$\n- Xanthine is then oxidized by xanthine oxidase to uric acid. These oxidations introduce keto groups at C-2 and C-8 without cleaving or rearranging the ring nitrogens. Therefore, the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ at N-7 remains at the N-7 position:\n$$\\text{Xanthine(}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}\\text{ at N-7)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{oxidation}} \\text{Uric acid(}{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}\\text{ at N-7)}$$\n\nBecause the purine ring skeleton is preserved and the only nitrogen released as $NH_3$ originates from the exocyclic C-2 amino group (not N-7), the label initially at guanine N-7 maps directly to the N-7 position of uric acid. Uric acid is 2,6,8-trioxypurine, retaining the ring nitrogens at positions 1, 3, 7, and 9, with numbering conserved from the purine template.\n\nTherefore, the final location of the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ is the nitrogen at position 7 of uric acid.\n\nThe correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2060740"}, {"introduction": "Cells are masters of efficiency, constantly balancing the energetic cost of building new molecules from simple precursors against recycling more complex, pre-existing components. This practice problem explores this critical trade-off by comparing the metabolic cost of synthesizing a new molecule of Guanosine Monophosphate (GMP) *de novo* versus salvaging an available guanine base. By performing this 'biochemical bookkeeping,' you will quantify the significant ATP savings provided by the purine salvage pathway, illuminating its vital role in cellular economy [@problem_id:2060748].", "problem": "A hepatocyte (liver cell) must manage its pool of purine nucleotides. Consider a scenario where the cell has a free guanine base and needs to generate one molecule of Guanosine Monophosphate (GMP). The cell can pursue one of two distinct strategies:\n\n**Strategy 1:** The cell degrades the free guanine base to its final excretion product, uric acid. Concurrently, it synthesizes a new molecule of GMP *de novo*, starting from Ribose-5-Phosphate and other small precursor molecules.\n\n**Strategy 2:** The cell utilizes the salvage pathway, directly converting the free guanine base into GMP using the enzyme Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).\n\nTo evaluate the metabolic efficiency of these strategies, calculate the difference in the energetic cost between Strategy 1 and Strategy 2. Your answer should be the cost of Strategy 1 minus the cost of Strategy 2.\n\nUse the following information and definitions for your calculation:\n-   An \"ATP equivalent\" is the unit of cost. The hydrolysis of one ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) costs 1 ATP equivalent. The hydrolysis of one GTP to GDP and Pi also costs 1 ATP equivalent. The hydrolysis of one ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate (PPi) is considered to cost 2 ATP equivalents.\n-   The synthesis of one molecule of Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate (PRPP) from Ribose-5-Phosphate consumes one molecule of ATP, which is hydrolyzed to AMP and PPi.\n-   The complete *de novo* synthesis of one molecule of Inosine Monophosphate (IMP) starting from one molecule of PRPP requires the net consumption of 4 molecules of ATP.\n-   The conversion of IMP to GMP is a two-step process. The second step, catalyzed by GMP synthetase, consumes one molecule of ATP, which is hydrolyzed to AMP and PPi. The first step does not consume ATP.\n-   The catabolism of guanine to uric acid has no net production or consumption of ATP equivalents.\n-   The salvage reaction catalyzed by HGPRT consumes one molecule of guanine and one molecule of PRPP to produce GMP and PPi.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single numerical value representing the difference in cost in ATP equivalents.", "solution": "Define the energetic cost in ATP equivalents according to the given rules.\n\nStrategy 1: Degrade guanine to uric acid (no ATP cost), then synthesize GMP de novo.\n- PRPP synthesis from ribose-5-phosphate: ATP hydrolyzed to AMP + PPi costs $2$ ATP equivalents.\n- IMP synthesis from PRPP: given as $4$ ATP equivalents.\n- IMP to GMP: the second step uses ATP to AMP + PPi, costing $2$ ATP equivalents; the first step costs $0$.\nThus the total cost for Strategy 1 is\n$$\nC_{1} = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n$$\n\nStrategy 2: Salvage guanine to GMP via HGPRT using PRPP.\n- The HGPRT reaction itself uses PRPP and does not consume ATP directly.\n- PRPP must be synthesized: ATP to AMP + PPi costs $2$ ATP equivalents.\nThus the total cost for Strategy 2 is\n$$\nC_{2} = 2.\n$$\n\nThe requested difference (Strategy 1 minus Strategy 2) is\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_{1} - C_{2} = 8 - 2 = 6.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2060748"}, {"introduction": "The knowledge of biochemical pathways is not merely academic; it forms the bedrock of modern pharmacology and drug design.

This deposition occurs when the concentration of uric acid in the blood exceeds its solubility limit. The final steps in the metabolic breakdown of purines in humans lead to the production of uric acid. This process is catalyzed by a single enzyme, xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase first converts hypoxanthine to xanthine, and then converts xanthine to the final product, uric acid. Both hypoxanthine and xanthine are significantly more water-soluble than uric acid.\n\nAs a member of a drug discovery team, you are tasked with designing a small molecule therapeutic to treat gout by lowering the systemic production of uric acid.

This is classic competitive inhibition, where a substrate analog occupies the active site, raising the apparent $K_{m}$ without changing $V_{\\max}$, and decreasing product formation at a given substrate concentration.\n\nApplication to options:\n- A (uric acid analog targeting XO): A product analog is less optimal because XO’s active site is evolved to bind substrates (hypoxanthine, xanthine) rather than product. Product inhibition can occur but is usually weaker and less direct than substrate-analog competitive inhibition for this purpose.\n- B (xanthine analog targeting XO): A substrate analog is expected to bind the active site and competitively inhibit XO, directly reducing formation of uric acid. This mirrors the clinically validated strategy exemplified by allopurinol, a substrate analog (of hypoxanthine) that inhibits XO.\n- C (uric acid analog to increase excretion): This is a uricosuric strategy targeting renal handling, not XO inhibition, and therefore does not match the stated strategy.\n- D (xanthine analog to allosterically activate XO): Activation would increase uric acid production; invoking negative feedback here is incorrect and counter to the goal.\n- E (complex with uric acid to increase solubility): This addresses solubility rather than production and is not an XO inhibition strategy.\n\nConclusion: The most effective and direct strategy to inhibit XO and reduce uric acid production is a substrate-analog competitive inhibitor, specifically a xanthine analog binding XO.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2060774"}]}
