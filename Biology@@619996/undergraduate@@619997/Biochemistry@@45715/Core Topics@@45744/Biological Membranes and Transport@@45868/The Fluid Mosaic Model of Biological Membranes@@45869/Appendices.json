By applying hydropathy analysis and the \"positive-inside rule,\" you will learn how to transform raw amino acid sequence data into a structural model of a protein's arrangement in the membrane [@problem_id:2082756].", "problem": "A biochemist is characterizing a newly discovered single-polypeptide receptor protein, designated \"Helixin-7\", which is believed to be an integral membrane protein. To predict its topology within the cell membrane, a hydropathy analysis was performed. In this analysis, the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index is calculated for each amino acid in the sequence. The average hydropathy index is then computed over a \"sliding window\" of 19 consecutive amino acid residues. A segment of the polypeptide is predicted to be a transmembrane alpha-helix if it comprises at least 18 contiguous residues, each having a window-averaged hydropathy index greater than +1.6.\n\nThe analysis of Helixin-7's 310-amino-acid sequence reveals three distinct regions satisfying this condition for a transmembrane segment:\n- Region A: Residues 42-62\n- Region B: Residues 115-136\n- Region C: Residues 221-240\n\nTo determine the orientation of the protein, the \"positive-inside rule\" is employed. This rule states that for transmembrane proteins, the loops of the polypeptide chain located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are significantly enriched in positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine). A sequence analysis of the loops connecting the predicted transmembrane regions yields the following counts of lysine and arginine residues:\n- Loop 1 (connecting Region A and Region B; residues 63-114): Contains 2 positively charged residues.\n- Loop 2 (connecting Region B and Region C; residues 137-220): Contains 11 positively charged residues.\n\nBased on this information, determine the most plausible topology of Helixin-7. Which of the following descriptions is correct?\n\nA. Helixin-7 has 3 transmembrane segments, with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm and its C-terminus in the extracellular space.\n\nB. Helixin-7 has 2 transmembrane segments, with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm and its C-terminus also in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. Helixin-7 is a peripheral membrane protein and does not have any transmembrane segments.\n\nD. Helixin-7 has 3 transmembrane segments, with its N-terminus in the extracellular space and its C-terminus in the cytoplasm.\n\nE. Helixin-7 has 3 transmembrane segments, with both its N-terminus and C-terminus in the extracellular space.", "solution": "The hydropathy-based transmembrane prediction uses the stated rule: a segment is called a transmembrane alpha-helix if it contains at least 18 contiguous residues whose 19-residue window-averaged Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index exceeds $+1.6$. The sequence analysis identifies three such segments at residues 42–62 (Region A), 115–136 (Region B), and 221–240 (Region C). Therefore, by the given criterion, Helixin-7 contains three transmembrane helices.\n\nTo assign orientation, apply the positive-inside rule: loops on the cytoplasmic side are enriched in positively charged residues (lysine and arginine). The provided counts are:\n- Loop 1 (residues 63–114, between Regions A and B): 2 positives.\n- Loop 2 (residues 137–220, between Regions B and C): 11 positives.\n\nBecause Loop 2 is strongly enriched in positive residues, Loop 2 is most plausibly cytoplasmic. Loop 1, with far fewer positive residues, is most plausibly extracellular.\n\nNow map sides across the three helices, considering the two possible N-terminal orientations and the fact that each transmembrane helix flips the side of the polypeptide chain:\n- If the N-terminus is cytoplasmic, then after Region A the chain is extracellular (so Loop 1 is extracellular), after Region B it is cytoplasmic (so Loop 2 is cytoplasmic), and after Region C it is extracellular (so the C-terminus is extracellular). This matches the positive-inside assignment (Loop 2 cytoplasmic, Loop 1 extracellular).\n- If the N-terminus is extracellular, then Loop 1 would be cytoplasmic and Loop 2 extracellular, contradicting the observed enrichment (Loop 2 has 11 positives).\n\nTherefore, the consistent topology is: three transmembrane segments, N-terminus in the cytoplasm, and C-terminus in the extracellular space. This corresponds to option A. Additionally, with an odd number of transmembrane helices, the N- and C-termini must be on opposite sides of the membrane, which rules out any option placing both termini on the same side for three helices.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2082756"}, {"introduction": "The \"fluid\" aspect of the fluid mosaic model is not just a concept; it is a measurable physical property. This exercise introduces you to Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), a powerful microscopy technique used to quantify the mobility of molecules within a living cell.

This practice is key to understanding how we obtain experimental evidence for membrane dynamics.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying the mobility of a specific transmembrane receptor on the surface of a cultured human cell line. To do this, they genetically fuse the receptor to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). They then perform a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment. In this experiment, a high-intensity laser is focused on a small, circular region of the cell membrane, photobleaching the GFP-tagged receptors within that spot and rendering them non-fluorescent. The microscope then records the fluorescence intensity in the bleached spot over time as unbleached receptors diffuse into it from the surrounding membrane.\n\nThe experiment is allowed to run for a very long time, until the fluorescence intensity in the bleached spot reaches a stable plateau. The data shows that the final, plateau intensity is exactly 80% of the initial, pre-bleach intensity.\n\nAssuming that the photobleaching process is irreversible and only affects the fluorophores, and that no new protein synthesis occurs during the experiment's timeframe, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of this result?\n\nA. 80% of the labeled receptors are mobile, but their diffusion is so slow that complete recovery would take an impractically long time.\n\nB. 20% of the labeled receptors form large, immobile aggregates that are impermeable to the laser.\n\nC.

The photobleaching laser damaged the lipid bilayer in the spot, reducing its fluidity and trapping 20% of the receptors that diffuse into it.", "solution": "The problem describes a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment used to probe the dynamics of membrane proteins. Here's a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n1.  **Understand the FRAP Principle**: FRAP measures the lateral mobility of fluorescently labeled molecules in a system, such as proteins within a cell membrane. The experiment involves three phases:\n    a.  **Pre-bleach**: The initial fluorescence intensity of a region of interest is measured. This represents 100% of the initial fluorescent molecules in that area.\n    b.  **Bleaching**: A high-intensity laser pulse irreversibly destroys the fluorophores in a specific spot, causing the fluorescence intensity in that spot to drop to near zero.\n    c.  **Recovery**: The bleached spot is monitored over time. If the labeled molecules are mobile, unbleached molecules from the surrounding area will diffuse into the bleached spot, and bleached molecules will diffuse out. This causes the fluorescence in the spot to recover.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Recovery Curve**: A typical FRAP curve plots fluorescence intensity versus time. The initial phase of the recovery provides information about the diffusion coefficient of the mobile molecules (a steeper slope means faster diffusion). The final phase, or plateau, provides information about the fraction of molecules that are mobile.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Plateau Level**: The extent of recovery is key.\n    - If the fluorescence recovers to 100% of the pre-bleach level, it means that all labeled molecules in the membrane are free to move and can eventually replenish the bleached spot. This is the \"mobile fraction\".\n    - If the fluorescence recovers to a level less than 100%, it implies that a certain fraction of the labeled molecules is immobile. These immobile molecules were inside the spot when it was bleached, and they cannot move out. Furthermore, immobile molecules outside the spot cannot move in to contribute to recovery. The fluorescence deficit at the plateau directly corresponds to this \"immobile fraction\".\n\n4.  **Apply to the Specific Problem**: In this case, the fluorescence recovers to a plateau of 80% of the initial intensity. This means the fluorescence signal is permanently missing 20% of its original value. This 20% deficit directly corresponds to the fraction of the total labeled protein population that is immobile. The 80% recovery is due to the mobile fraction of proteins diffusing into the bleached spot and restoring the fluorescence concentration to 80% of its original value. Therefore, 80% of the receptors are mobile and 20% are immobile. The immobile proteins are often anchored to structures like the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**:\n    - **A**: This is incorrect. The problem states that the intensity reached a \"stable plateau\" after a \"very long time\". A plateau signifies that equilibrium has been reached for the diffusive process. If the proteins were merely slow, the fluorescence would continue to increase, even if very gradually, and would not have reached a stable plateau.\n    - **B**: This is a subtle misinterpretation. The immobility is correct, but the reason given (\"impermeable to the laser\") is not the standard interpretation. The laser bleaches whatever is in its path. An immobile aggregate would be bleached just like a mobile protein. The lack of recovery is due to the *inability of surrounding unbleached proteins to replace the bleached immobile ones*, not due to the bleached ones being resistant to the laser.\n    - **C**: This is incorrect. If obstructions existed, they would slow down diffusion (affecting the rate of recovery), but if all proteins were mobile, they would eventually find their way around the obstructions, leading to 100% recovery. It does not explain a permanent 20% deficit.\n    - **D**: This is the correct interpretation. A final recovery to 80% of the initial value directly signifies that the mobile fraction of the protein is 80%, and consequently, the immobile fraction is 20%.\n    - **E**: This suggests an experimental artifact. While severe laser power can damage the membrane, the standard interpretation of incomplete recovery in FRAP is the presence of an inherent immobile fraction of the probed molecules. Without evidence of damage, this is a less direct and less likely explanation than D.

Processes that require the lateral mobility of membrane proteins will be most immediately affected by an agent that cross-links extracellular domains of membrane proteins and thereby creates a rigid, immobile network that restricts lateral diffusion.\n\nIdentify which listed processes depend directly on lateral diffusion at the plasma membrane:\n- Option A: The transport of $K^+$ ions through potassium leak channels primarily requires an open ion-conducting pore. Ion permeation through a channel does not require lateral diffusion of the channel within the membrane. Therefore, immobilizing the channel’s position in the plane of the membrane should not immediately inhibit ion flux through an already open channel.\n- Option B: The synthesis of integral membrane proteins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum occurs on ribosomes bound to the ER, not at the plasma membrane, and does not depend on the lateral mobility of plasma membrane proteins. Thus it is not directly affected.\n- Option C: The metabolic breakdown of glucose into pyruvate (glycolysis) occurs in the cytoplasm and does not involve the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins. Thus it is not directly affected.\n- Option D: The formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle to internalize bound hormone molecules (receptor-mediated endocytosis) requires lateral mobility of membrane receptors and associated adaptor proteins to cluster into coated pits, recruit clathrin, and drive curvature and vesicle formation. Cross-linking membrane proteins into a rigid network that severely restricts lateral diffusion would most directly and immediately inhibit the clustering and dynamic reorganization needed for clathrin-coated pit formation and endocytosis.\n- Option E: The Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump resides in the ER/SR membrane and functions to maintain low cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$. Its activity is not directly dependent on plasma membrane protein lateral diffusion and thus is not directly affected by cross-linking plasma membrane proteins.\n\nTherefore, the most directly and immediately inhibited process is receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicle formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2082737"}]}
