The normal transport cycle for this protein is understood to proceed through the following key steps:\n1.  The transporter is in an inward-facing conformation, exposing its substrate-binding site to the cytoplasm.\n2.  The antibiotic substrate binds to the transporter from the cytoplasm.\n3.  Two molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) bind to the transporter's Nucleotide-Binding Domains (NBDs).\n4.  The binding of ATP induces a major conformational change, causing the transporter to switch to an outward-facing state. This change simultaneously lowers the affinity for the substrate, causing its release into the extracellular space.\n5.  The subsequent hydrolysis of ATP to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), followed by the release of ADP and Pi, resets the transporter back to its original inward-facing conformation, ready for another cycle.\n\nConsider a scenario where a genetic mutation is introduced into the catalytic residue within the NBDs. This specific mutation allows the NBDs to bind ATP with normal affinity but completely prevents the hydrolysis of the bound ATP.\n\nAssuming both the antibiotic and ATP are present in sufficient concentrations to initiate one transport event, which of the following options best describes the resulting state of this single, mutated transporter molecule?\n\nA. The transporter remains permanently in the inward-facing conformation, bound to the antibiotic.\n\nB. The transporter becomes arrested in a stable, outward-facing conformation.\n\nC. The transporter continuously and rapidly cycles between the inward- and outward-facing conformations without net transport of the antibiotic.\n\nD. The transporter successfully transports one molecule of antibiotic and then hydrolyzes ATP, but fails to release the resulting ADP and Pi.\n\nE. The transporter binds ATP but immediately releases it without a conformational change, as it cannot be hydrolyzed.", "solution": "We model the transporter as an ABC exporter with two coupled domains: transmembrane domains (TMDs) that switch between inward- and outward-facing conformations, and nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP. The key mechanistic principles are:\n- ATP binding to the NBDs drives NBD dimerization, which allosterically switches the TMDs from inward- to outward-facing and lowers substrate affinity on the cytosolic side.\n- Substrate is released to the extracellular space upon the outward-facing transition.\n- ATP hydrolysis followed by release of ADP and $P_{i}$ breaks the NBD dimer and resets the transporter to the inward-facing conformation.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{in}}$ denote the inward-facing transporter, $E_{\\text{out}}$ the outward-facing transporter, $S$ the substrate (antibiotic), and $\\text{ATP}$, $\\text{ADP}$, $P_{i}$ the nucleotides and phosphate.

Therefore, the following steps occur when both $S$ and ATP are available:\n1. Substrate binding:\n$$\nE_{\\text{in}} + S \\to E_{\\text{in}}:S.\n$$\n2. ATP binding (with normal affinity):\n$$\nE_{\\text{in}}:S + 2\\,\\text{ATP} \\to E_{\\text{in}}:S:(\\text{ATP})_{2}.\n$$\n3.
