Each batch is composed of a homogeneous population of phospholipids, where the two fatty acyl tails of each phospholipid are identical. The fatty acids used for the three batches are:\n\n1.  **Palmitic acid**, a saturated fatty acid with the notation (16:0).\n2.  **Oleic acid**, a monounsaturated fatty acid with the notation (18:1).\n3.  **Arachidonic acid**, a polyunsaturated fatty acid with the notation (20:4).\n\nThe notation (C:D) indicates a fatty acid with C carbon atoms and D double bonds. The temperature at which a lipid bilayer transitions from an ordered, gel-like state to a disordered, fluid-like state is known as the phase transition temperature, denoted as $T_m$.\n\nBased on the structural differences between these fatty acids, which of the following options correctly ranks the $T_m$ of the liposomes made from these phospholipids, from lowest to highest?

The physical principle is that $T_m$ reflects the balance between enthalpic stabilization of the ordered (gel) phase by van der Waals interactions among tightly packed acyl chains and the entropic tendency toward disorder. Two key monotonic trends are established for phospholipid bilayers:\n1) For fixed unsaturation, increasing hydrocarbon chain length $C$ increases van der Waals contacts and packing, so\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_m}{\\partial C} > 0.\n$$\n2) For fixed chain length, introducing cis double bonds (increasing $D$) creates kinks that disrupt packing, reduce van der Waals interactions, increase free volume, and lower the enthalpic stabilization of the ordered phase, so\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_m}{\\partial D} < 0.\n$$\n\nApply these trends to the three lipids:\n- Palmitic acid: $(16:0)$ has $C=16$, $D=0$ (saturated), enabling maximal tight packing and therefore a relatively high $T_m$.\n- Oleic acid: $(18:1)$ has $C=18$, $D=1$; the single cis double bond substantially disrupts packing, lowering $T_m$ compared with a saturated chain. Although $C$ is larger than in $(16:0)$, the decrease from one cis double bond is known to dominate the increase from adding two methylenes, implying\n$$\nT_{m,\\text{Oleic}} < T_{m,\\text{Palmitic}}.\n$$\n- Arachidonic acid: $(20:4)$ has $C=20$, $D=4$; multiple cis double bonds cause even greater disruption of packing than a single double bond, so\n$$\nT_{m,\\text{Arachidonic}} < T_{m,\\text{Oleic}}.\n$$\n\nCombining these inequalities gives the overall ordering\n$$\nT_{m,\\text{Arachidonic}} < T_{m,\\text{Oleic}} < T_{m,\\text{Palmitic}}.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2056422"}, {"introduction": "While acyl chains are critical, the polar head groups also play a significant role in membrane structure.

An experiment is conducted where the pH of the buffer solution, both inside and outside the vesicles, is rapidly adjusted to 3.0.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting change in the physical properties of the phospholipid bilayer?\n\nA. The membrane becomes more fluid because the head groups become more protonated, which weakens van der Waals interactions between the acyl chains.\n\nB.

Tighter packing increases acyl-chain ordering and enhances van der Waals contacts between chains, which decreases membrane fluidity. Therefore, the correct qualitative outcome is tighter packing and reduced fluidity due to decreased electrostatic repulsion upon protonation.\n\nAmong the options, this is described by option B; the other options are inconsistent: A and C incorrectly predict increased fluidity when repulsion decreases; D states the headgroups become more deprotonated, which is opposite to the effect of lowering pH; E asserts no significant change without a compensating mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2056361"}, {"introduction": "Biological membranes are not static structures; they are dynamic, fluid environments.
