Its structure includes a single, continuous alpha-helical domain that is responsible for anchoring it within the lipid bilayer. The hydrophobic core of this particular cell membrane has a thickness of 30 Å. In a standard alpha-helix, the axial distance contributed by each amino acid residue (the rise per residue) is 1.5 Å. The genetic information for this protein is transcribed into messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) before being translated into the amino acid sequence. It is a fundamental principle of molecular biology that a sequence of 3 nucleotides in an mRNA strand codes for a single amino acid.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of nucleotides required in the segment of an mRNA molecule that codes for the Polypeptide chain forming this single transmembrane alpha-helix?", "solution": "The hydrophobic core thickness is given as 30 angstroms, and in a standard alpha-helix the rise per residue is 1.5 angstroms. To span the membrane, the number of amino acid residues required is the membrane thickness divided by the rise per residue. Since the number of residues must be an integer, the general relation is\n$$\nn_{\\text{aa}}=\\left\\lceil \\frac{d}{r} \\right\\rceil,\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the thickness to be spanned and $r$ is the rise per residue. Substituting $d=30$ and $r=1.5$,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{r}=\\frac{30}{1.5}=\\frac{300}{15}=20,\n$$\nso no rounding is needed and $n_{\\text{aa}}=20$.\n\nBy the triplet nature of the genetic code, each amino acid is encoded by exactly $3$ nucleotides in mRNA. Therefore, the number of nucleotides required to encode this alpha-helical segment is\n$$\nn_{\\text{nt}}=3\\,n_{\\text{aa}}=3\\times 20=60.\n$$\nThis count refers specifically to the coding segment for the transmembrane helix and does not include any additional nucleotides for initiation, termination, or untranslated regions, which are outside the scope of the question.\n\nHence, the minimum number of nucleotides required is $60$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "2057190"}, {"introduction": "In the laboratory, biochemists use a standard toolkit of experimental techniques to determine how a protein is associated with the cell membrane. Peripheral proteins, held by weaker electrostatic forces, can be dislodged by high-salt or high-pH washes, whereas integral proteins are embedded so deeply they require detergents to be extracted. This practice challenges you to interpret a classic set of fractionation experiments, combining biochemical data with sequence analysis to solve the puzzle of a protein's identity [@problem_id:2057249].", "problem": "A team of biochemists is characterizing a newly discovered protein they have named \"Neuronal-Associated Factor\" (NAF), which is located in the plasma membrane of cultured brain cells. To determine its mode of association with the membrane, they perform a series of fractionation experiments.\n\n*   **Experiment 1 (High Ionic Strength):** The cultured cells are incubated in a buffer containing 1.0 M KCl. After incubation, the cells are subjected to centrifugation to separate the insoluble membrane pellet from the soluble supernatant.\n*   **Experiment 2 (High pH):** The cells are incubated in a high-pH carbonate buffer (pH 11.0), followed by the same centrifugation step.\n*   **Experiment 3 (Detergent Treatment):** The cells are treated with a buffer containing the strong, non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation.\n\nThe distribution of NAF in the pellet and supernatant is analyzed for each experiment. The results show that NAF is found exclusively in the membrane pellet after Experiments 1 and 2, but is solubilized and found in the supernatant after Experiment 3.\n\nFurthermore, computational analysis of NAF's primary amino acid sequence predicts the presence of a single, 23-amino-acid alpha-helical segment that is rich in hydrophobic residues (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine).\n\nBased on these combined experimental and computational findings, which of the following options provides the most accurate and specific classification for the NAF protein?\n\nA. A peripheral membrane protein.\n\nB. A single-pass transmembrane integral protein.\n\nC. A multispan transmembrane integral protein.\n\nD. An extracellular matrix protein bound to the cell surface.\n\nE. A protein anchored to the membrane via a Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor.", "solution": "1. Identify which membrane associations are disrupted by each treatment based on biochemical principles:\n- High ionic strength (1.0 M KCl) shields and disrupts electrostatic interactions between proteins and membrane surfaces or other proteins. This releases peripheral membrane proteins and extracellular matrix components bound noncovalently via ionic interactions into the supernatant.\n- High pH carbonate (pH 11) disrupts electrostatic interactions and many hydrogen bonds, extracting peripheral membrane proteins from both cytosolic and luminal faces; it does not extract proteins embedded in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer.\n- Non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 solubilize the lipid bilayer into mixed micelles, releasing integral membrane proteins into the supernatant.\n\n2. Apply these principles to the experimental outcomes:\n- After both 1.0 M KCl and pH 11 carbonate, NAF remains exclusively in the membrane pellet. Therefore, NAF is not a peripheral membrane protein and is not an extracellular matrix protein loosely bound to the surface. This behavior is characteristic of proteins that are not removed by disruption of electrostatic interactions, i.e., integral or lipid-anchored proteins.\n- After Triton X-100 treatment, NAF is solubilized into the supernatant. This is the expected behavior for integral membrane proteins embedded in the bilayer; detergent disrupts the membrane and solubilizes them. Lipid-anchored proteins can also partition into detergent micelles; thus, at this stage the data support an integral or lipid-anchored classification rather than a peripheral one.\n\n3. Use sequence analysis to refine the classification:\n- The primary sequence predicts a single, approximately 23-residue alpha-helical, strongly hydrophobic segment. Such a segment length and composition are characteristic of a single transmembrane alpha helix spanning the bilayer.\n- A multispan transmembrane protein would typically exhibit multiple hydrophobic transmembrane segments; only one is predicted here, which argues against a multispan protein.\n- GPI-anchored proteins do not contain a stable transmembrane helix in the mature protein; instead, they have a C-terminal GPI attachment signal that is cleaved and replaced by the GPI anchor. Many GPI-anchored proteins additionally have an N-terminal signal peptide, often yielding two hydrophobic segments in the precursor. The presence of a single predicted hydrophobic helix consistent with a membrane-spanning segment supports a single-pass transmembrane protein rather than a GPI-anchored protein.\n\n4. Synthesize the conclusions with the options:\n- A (peripheral) is excluded by resistance to high salt and high pH extraction.\n- C (multispan) is excluded by the single predicted hydrophobic helix.\n- D (extracellular matrix protein bound to the surface) is excluded by resistance to salt and pH extraction.\n- E (GPI-anchored) is disfavored by the presence of a single transmembrane-like hydrophobic helix rather than a cleavable GPI signal arrangement.\n- Therefore, the most accurate and specific classification is a single-pass transmembrane integral protein.\n\nThus, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2057249"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple classification, a major goal in biochemistry is to understand how membrane proteins function, which often involves interactions with other proteins to form dimers or larger oligomers. This advanced problem introduces you to a powerful experimental strategy—domain swapping—used to pinpoint the specific part of a protein responsible for a particular function. By analyzing the results of a co-immunoprecipitation assay with chimeric proteins, you will learn how researchers can meticulously map the structural basis of protein-protein interactions within the membrane [@problem_id:2057194].", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating a family of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by seven transmembrane (TM) domains. Two members of this family, Receptor Alpha (RA) and Receptor Beta (RB), are of particular interest. Experimental evidence shows that RA functions as a homodimer, while RB is exclusively found as a monomer in the cell membrane. To identify the specific domain responsible for RA's dimerization, the biochemist creates a series of seven chimeric proteins, labeled C1 through C7. Each chimera consists of the full protein sequence of the monomeric RB, but with one of its seven TM domains systematically replaced by the corresponding TM domain from the dimeric RA. For example, the chimera C1 is the RB protein with its first TM domain (TMB1) replaced by the first TM domain of RA (TMA1).\n\nTo test for dimerization, a Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay is performed. For each protein (RA, RB, and C1-C7), two versions are co-expressed in a cell line: one with an N-terminal FLAG-tag and another with an N-terminal HA-tag. An antibody against the FLAG-tag is used to precipitate the FLAG-tagged proteins from the cell lysate. The precipitated complexes are then subjected to Western blotting and probed with an antibody against the HA-tag. The detection of an HA-tagged protein in the precipitate indicates a physical interaction (dimerization) with the FLAG-tagged protein.\n\nThe results of the Western blot analysis are as follows:\n\n-   **Experiment with RA:** A strong band corresponding to the HA-tagged RA was detected.\n-   **Experiment with RB:** No band corresponding to the HA-tagged RB was detected.\n-   **Experiments with C1, C2, C4, C5, and C7:** No bands corresponding to the HA-tagged chimeric proteins were detected.\n-   **Experiment with C3:** A strong band corresponding to the HA-tagged C3 was detected.\n-   **Experiment with C6:** A very faint, barely detectable band corresponding to the HA-tagged C6 was detected.\n\nBased on this experimental evidence, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The N-terminal extracellular domain of RA is essential for dimerization.\n\nB. Transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) of RA is the primary structural determinant for its homodimerization.\n\nC. Transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of RA is the primary structural determinant for its homodimerization.\n\nD. Dimerization of RA is a complex process requiring the interaction of all seven of its transmembrane domains.\n\nE. The C-terminal intracellular domain of RB actively inhibits dimerization.\n\nF. The experimental results are contradictory and no conclusion can be drawn.", "solution": "We interpret the Co-IP assay such that detection of an HA-tagged partner in the FLAG pull-down indicates physical association (dimerization). Thus, a strong HA band reflects robust dimerization, absence of a band indicates no detectable dimerization under assay conditions, and a very faint band suggests a weak or marginal interaction.\n\nFirst, validate the controls:\n- RA shows a strong band, confirming that RA forms homodimers under these conditions.\n- RB shows no band, confirming that RB is monomeric.\n\nNext, analyze the chimeras in which the RB background contains a single RA transmembrane (TM) segment:\n- C1, C2, C4, C5, and C7 show no band, indicating that substituting TM1, TM2, TM4, TM5, or TM7 from RA into RB does not confer detectable dimerization.\n- C3 shows a strong band, indicating that substituting TM3 from RA into RB is sufficient to confer robust dimerization to the otherwise monomeric RB scaffold. This identifies TM3 from RA as a key determinant of dimerization.\n- C6 shows a very faint band, suggesting that TM6 from RA may contribute weakly to dimerization but is not sufficient to drive robust dimerization on its own in the RB context.\n\nEvaluate the options against the evidence:\n- A (N-terminal extracellular domain essential): Not supported; the experiment tests TM domain swaps, and robust dimerization is conferred by swapping TM3 alone, without altering the N-terminus, arguing against essentiality of the N-terminus.\n- B (TM3 is the primary determinant): Supported by the strong band in C3, which demonstrates that TM3 alone can impart strong dimerization.\n- C (TM6 is the primary determinant): Not supported; TM6 yields only a very faint band in C6, indicating a minor or auxiliary contribution at best.\n- D (requires all seven TMs): Contradicted by C3, since a single TM replacement (TM3) suffices to confer strong dimerization.\n- E (RB C-terminus inhibits dimerization): Contradicted by C3; the RB scaffold including its C-terminus allows robust dimerization when only TM3 is replaced, so the C-terminus does not actively inhibit.\n- F (no conclusion): Not correct; the results consistently indicate TM3’s predominant role.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is that TM3 of RA is the primary structural determinant for homodimerization, with possible minor contribution from TM6.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2057194"}]}
