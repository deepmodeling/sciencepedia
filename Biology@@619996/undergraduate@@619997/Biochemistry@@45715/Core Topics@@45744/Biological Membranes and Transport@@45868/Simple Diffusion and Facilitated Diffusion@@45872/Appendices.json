Assuming the cell is a closed system with respect to mannose (i.e., mannose is not metabolized or otherwise consumed upon entry), which of the following statements best describes the capabilities of this transport system?\n\nA. The uniporter system will actively transport mannose into the cell, allowing the intracellular concentration, $[M]_{in}$, to become substantially higher than $[M]_{out}$. This process is directly powered by the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nB. The uniporter is a form of passive transport. Therefore, the net movement of mannose into the cell will cease when $[M]_{in}$ becomes equal to $[M]_{out}$. The system cannot accumulate mannose against a concentration gradient.\n\nC.
