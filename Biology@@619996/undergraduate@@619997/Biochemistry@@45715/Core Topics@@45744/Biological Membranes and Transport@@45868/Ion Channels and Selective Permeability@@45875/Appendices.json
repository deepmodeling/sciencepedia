This potential difference is established and maintained by ion pumps and the selective permeability of the cell membrane to various ions. For potassium ions (K$^+$), the intracellular concentration is kept high at 140.0 mM, while the extracellular concentration is low at 4.0 mM. Assuming the neuron's membrane is permeable to potassium at rest, determine the direction of the net electrochemical force acting on K$^+$ ions under these conditions.\n\nThe system is at a physiological temperature of 37.0 °C.

For a cation with $z>0$, a positive driving force ($V_{m} - E_{i} > 0$) corresponds to a net outward movement (efflux), and a negative driving force corresponds to inward movement (influx).\n\nFirst, convert the temperature to Kelvin using $T(\\text{K}) = T(^\\circ\\text{C}) + 273.15$:\n$$\nT = 37.0 + 273.15 = 310.15 \\text{ K}.\n$$\n\nThe Nernst equation for potassium is\n$$\nE_{K} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}{[K^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right).\n$$\nWith $z=+1$, $[K^{+}]_{\\text{in}} = 140.0 \\text{ mM}$, and $[K^{+}]_{\\text{out}} = 4.0 \\text{ mM}$,\n$$\nE_{K} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{4.0}{140.0}\\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{35}\\right) = -\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln(35).\n$$\nSince $\\ln(35) > 0$, $E_{K}$ is negative.

The selectivity filter is an exquisite constriction within the pore, engineered by evolution to distinguish between ions with remarkable precision. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2053964] invites you to predict the functional outcome of a targeted mutation within the selectivity filter, providing deep insight into the biophysical principles that govern molecular recognition and ion preference.", "problem": "In structural biology, the selectivity of ion channels is a classic example of molecular recognition. Consider a hypothetical transmembrane cation channel whose structure is analogous to the well-studied bacterial KcsA potassium channel. The selectivity filter of this channel is formed by a narrow pore lined with backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms from a conserved amino acid sequence. This arrangement is geometrically and electrostatically optimized to coordinate with potassium ions ($K^+$), allowing them to shed their hydration shell and pass through the channel efficiently.\n\nNow, imagine a single-point mutation is introduced via site-directed mutagenesis. The key amino acid residues providing the carbonyl oxygens in the selectivity filter are replaced with aspartate residues. At physiological pH, the side chains of aspartate residues are deprotonated and exist as negatively charged carboxylate groups (-COO-). Assume that this mutation does not significantly alter the backbone structure or the diameter of the pore.\n\nGiven this modification, which of the following ions would the mutated channel most preferentially conduct?\n\nA. $K^+$ (Potassium)\n\nB. $Na^+$ (Sodium)\n\nC. $Ca^{2+}$ (Calcium)\n\nD. $Cl^-$ (Chloride)\n\nE. The channel will lose its selectivity and conduct both $K^+$ and $Na^+$ with equal preference.", "solution": "We analyze ion permeation as a free-energy balance between dehydration cost and stabilizing interactions within the selectivity filter. The net transfer free energy for an ion of charge $z e$ and effective radius $r$ can be schematically written as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}} \\approx \\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{filter}}.\n$$\nFirst, the dehydration cost can be approximated by a Born-type expression (magnitude shown), scaling with $z^{2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}} \\sim \\frac{z^{2} e^{2}}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{p}}-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{w}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{w}$ is the dielectric constant of water and $\\epsilon_{p}$ is the effective dielectric constant in the pore environment. This term penalizes ions more strongly as $z$ increases and as $r$ decreases.\n\nSecond, stabilization by the filter arises from Coulombic attraction and specific coordination by oxygens lining the pore. With $N$ negatively charged carboxylates (each approximately $-e$) introduced by aspartate side chains at distances $\\{d_{i}\\}$ from the ion, the leading electrostatic stabilization scales approximately as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{filter}} \\sim - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r}} \\frac{z e^{2}}{d_{i}} \\equiv - z S,\n$$\nwhere $S \\doteq \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r} d_{i}}$ is a positive quantity capturing the strength and geometry of the interaction. Thus, $\\Delta G_{\\text{filter}}$ becomes more favorable linearly in $z$.\n\nIn the wild-type KcsA-like filter, the coordinating groups are backbone carbonyl oxygens (partial negative charge, no formal charge), whose geometry matches $K^{+}$ and allows it to shed its hydration shell with minimal energetic penalty relative to $Na^{+}$. This gives $K^{+}$ selectivity due to an optimal fit and balanced $\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{filter}}$.\n\nUpon mutation to aspartate side chains, the filter now presents multiple formally negative carboxylate groups, producing a high-field-strength site. Two key consequences follow:\n- The stabilizing term becomes much stronger and scales as $-z S$, favoring higher-valence cations.\n- Carboxylate oxygens strongly coordinate divalent cations, as exemplified by the classical acidic “EEEE/EEDD” loci in calcium-selective channels.\n\nComparing candidate ions:\n- For anions like $Cl^{-}$, the filter is net negative; Coulomb repulsion makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{filter}}$ strongly unfavorable, so $D$ is excluded.\n- Between monovalent cations $K^{+}$ and $Na^{+}$, the introduction of strong negative charge raises the field strength. High-field sites tend to favor smaller, more highly charged ions; among monovalents, this can shift preference toward $Na^{+}$ relative to $K^{+}$, but not necessarily overcome the dehydration penalty and geometry optimized for $K^{+}$.\n- For $Ca^{2+}$, the stronger Coulomb stabilization ($\\propto z$) and multidentate coordination by carboxylates can compensate the larger dehydration penalty ($\\propto z^{2}$) because the mutated site provides inner-sphere coordination that mimics hydration and is known to confer calcium selectivity in analogous channels. Empirically and mechanistically, introducing multiple acidic residues into selectivity filters converts them into high-affinity, high-field-strength sites that preferentially bind and conduct $Ca^{2+}$ over monovalent cations.\n\nTherefore, the mutated channel most preferentially conducts $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nHence the correct choice is $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2053964"}, {"introduction": "Voltage-gated ion channels are remarkable modular machines, where distinct protein domains carry out specific tasks like voltage sensing and ion conduction. Biophysicists often probe these structure-function relationships by creating \"chimeric\" channels from the parts of different parent channels. This practice [@problem_id:2054001] places you in the role of a researcher, asking you to predict the behavior of a novel channel built from the voltage-sensing domains of a sodium channel and the pore of a potassium channel, thereby testing your integrated understanding of gating and selectivity.", "problem": "In a biophysics laboratory, a team of researchers is investigating the modular nature of voltage-gated ion channels. They focus on two distinct channels:\n\n1.  A canonical fast voltage-gated sodium channel (let's call it Na_V-fast), which is responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in neurons. This channel is characterized by very rapid activation followed by rapid inactivation, both occurring within milliseconds of membrane depolarization. It is highly selective for sodium ions (Na$^+$).\n2.  A canonical delayed rectifier voltage-gated potassium channel (let's call it K_V-DR), which contributes to the repolarization of the action potential. This channel is characterized by a slower activation upon membrane depolarization and shows minimal or very slow inactivation. It is highly selective for potassium ions (K$^+$).\n\nThe researchers successfully construct a novel chimeric ion channel protein. This engineered protein consists of the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) from the Na_V-fast channel genetically fused to the pore-forming domain, which includes the selectivity filter, from the K_V-DR channel.\n\nAssuming this chimeric protein correctly folds and inserts into the plasma membrane of a test cell, which of the following statements most accurately predicts its electrophysiological properties in response to a strong, sustained depolarizing voltage stimulus?\n\nA.

The channel will be constitutively open, showing no voltage-dependence, and will be selective for K$^+$ ions.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the functional properties (gating and selectivity) of a chimeric ion channel constructed from parts of a fast sodium channel and a delayed rectifier potassium channel. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the structure-function relationship in voltage-gated ion channels, which are known to be modular proteins.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the principle of modularity in ion channels.\nVoltage-gated ion channels are complex proteins where distinct structural domains are responsible for specific functions. The two primary functions we are concerned with are voltage-sensing (which leads to gating) and ion permeation/selectivity.\n\nStep 2: Determine the function of the Voltage-Sensing Domains (VSDs).\nThe voltage-sensing domains are the parts of the channel that detect changes in the membrane's electrical potential. They typically contain positively charged amino acid residues (like arginine or lysine) that physically move in response to depolarization. This movement is mechanically coupled to the channel's \"gate,\" causing it to open or close. Therefore, the kinetic properties of channel gating—such as the speed of activation (opening) and inactivation (closing during sustained depolarization)—are determined by the VSDs. In our chimeric channel, the VSDs are taken from the Na_V-fast channel, which is characterized by rapid activation and rapid inactivation. Thus, we predict the chimeric channel will exhibit these same rapid gating kinetics.\n\nStep 3: Determine the function of the Pore-Forming Domain and Selectivity Filter.\nThe central pore of the channel is the pathway through which ions flow. A narrow region within this pore, known as the selectivity filter, is responsible for determining which ion species can pass through. The specific amino acid sequence and the precise atomic geometry of the selectivity filter create an environment that selectively accommodates a specific ion (e.g., by mimicking the hydration shell of that ion) while excluding others. Therefore, the ion selectivity of a channel is determined by its pore-forming domain, and specifically its selectivity filter. In our chimeric channel, the pore domain is taken from the K_V-DR channel, which is highly selective for K$^+$ ions. Thus, we predict the chimeric channel will be permeable to K$^+$ ions.\n\nStep 4: Combine the properties for the chimeric channel.\nBy combining the conclusions from the previous steps, the engineered channel should possess the gating properties of the protein that contributed the VSDs and the selectivity properties of the protein that contributed the pore.\n- Gating properties from Na_V-fast: Rapid activation and rapid inactivation.\n- Selectivity properties from K_V-DR: Selective for K$^+$ ions.\n\nTherefore, upon a strong depolarizing stimulus, the chimeric channel is expected to open rapidly, allow the passage of K$^+$ ions, and then close rapidly despite the continued presence of the stimulus.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\nLet's examine each option based on our prediction:\n- A. The channel will exhibit slow activation and be selective for Na$^+$ ions. (Incorrect: Gating is from Na_V-fast, so it should be rapid. Selectivity is from K_V-DR, so it should be for K$^+$).\n- B. The channel will exhibit rapid activation followed by rapid inactivation and be selective for Na$^+$ ions. (Incorrect: Selectivity is from K_V-DR, so it should be for K$^+$).\n- C. The channel will exhibit slow activation and be selective for K$^+$ ions. (Incorrect: Gating is from Na_V-fast, so it should be rapid).\n- D. The channel will exhibit rapid activation followed by rapid inactivation and be selective for K$^+$ ions. (Correct: This matches our prediction of rapid gating from the Na_V-fast VSDs and K$^+$ selectivity from the K_V-DR pore).\n- E. The channel will be constitutively open, showing no voltage-dependence, and will be selective for K$^+$ ions. (Incorrect: The presence of VSDs from a voltage-gated channel implies it will be voltage-dependent, not constitutively open).\n\nThe most accurate prediction is that the channel will have the fast gating of a sodium channel but the ion selectivity of a potassium channel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2054001"}]}
