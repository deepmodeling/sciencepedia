This pathway is initiated when an external signaling molecule, a death ligand, binds to a death receptor on the cell's surface. In this particular mutant cell line, there is a specific loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Fas-Associated Death Domain (FADD) protein. This mutation completely disrupts the three-dimensional structure of FADD's N-terminal Death Domain (DD), rendering it unable to participate in protein-protein interactions. However, the C-terminal Death Effector Domain (DED) of the mutant FADD protein remains structurally intact and functional.\n\nThese mutant cells are then treated with an appropriate death ligand, Fas Ligand (FasL), which successfully binds to its corresponding Fas Receptor (FasR) and causes the receptors to cluster on the cell membrane. Despite this initial activation step, the apoptotic cascade fails to proceed.\n\nWhich of the following molecular events is the most direct cause of the observed failure to induce apoptosis in these mutant cells?\n\nA. The binding of the FADD adaptor protein to the activated FasR.\n\nB. The cleavage and activation of executioner caspase-3.\n\nC. The recruitment of procaspase-8 to the FADD adaptor protein.\n\nD. The binding of the FasL to the FasR.\n\nE. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol.", "solution": "The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis initiated by FasL-FasR proceeds through the following ordered molecular interactions:\n- FasL binds FasR and induces receptor trimerization and clustering at the membrane.\n- The cytoplasmic Death Domain (DD) of FasR engages the DD of the adaptor protein FADD via DD-DD interactions.\n- The C-terminal Death Effector Domain (DED) of FADD then recruits procaspase-8 through DED-DED interactions to form the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC).\n- Within the DISC, procaspase-8 is activated, which subsequently activates executioner caspases such as caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.\n\nIn the mutant described, the N-terminal DD of FADD is structurally disrupted, while the C-terminal DED remains intact. Consequently:\n- FasL binding to FasR and receptor clustering occur normally.\n- However, the next obligatory step—DD-mediated binding of FADD to the activated FasR—cannot occur because FADD’s DD is nonfunctional.\n- Without FADD binding to FasR, DISC assembly fails; thus, even though the DED is intact, procaspase-8 cannot be recruited to the receptor complex.\n- Downstream events such as caspase-8 activation and caspase-3 cleavage therefore do not occur, but these failures are secondary to the lack of FADD recruitment to FasR.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A identifies the specific step that is immediately blocked by the DD loss-of-function mutation; this is the most direct cause of failure.\n- C (procaspase-8 recruitment) also fails but is a consequence of A; it is less direct given the intact DED.\n- B (caspase-3 activation) is downstream.\n- D (FasL binding) occurs normally.\n- E (cytochrome c release) pertains to the intrinsic pathway and is not the primary defect here.\n\nTherefore, the most direct cause is the failure of FADD to bind the activated FasR via DD-DD interaction, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2304356"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a signaling pathway on paper is one thing; proving it happens in a living cell is another. Scientists rely on powerful biochemical techniques to visualize the molecular events they hypothesize. This exercise [@problem_id:2304314] places you in the role of a researcher analyzing experimental data, challenging you to interpret a Western blot to find definitive evidence of caspase-8 activation. Successfully solving this problem deepens your understanding of how proteolytic cleavage serves as an irreversible 'on' switch for apoptosis.", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating a novel therapeutic agent, \"Compound Y,\" for its potential to treat a specific type of lymphoma. The researcher hypothesizes that Compound Y induces apoptosis in lymphoma cells by activating the extrinsic pathway. To test this, they treat a culture of lymphoma cells with Compound Y for several hours. They then lyse the cells, collect the total protein, and perform a Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes caspase-8. The activation of the extrinsic pathway involves the formation of a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC), which leads to the activation of the initiator caspase, procaspase-8.\n\nAssuming the researcher's hypothesis is correct, which of the following observations on the Western blot would provide the most direct evidence for the activation of caspase-8?\n\nA.

DISC recruits adaptor proteins (such as FADD) and procaspase-8. Activation of procaspase-8 occurs via proximity-induced dimerization and autocatalytic proteolytic cleavage. Proteolytic activation converts the inactive zymogen (procaspase-8) into active caspase-8 composed of cleaved subunits (commonly referred to as p18 and p10), which appear as lower molecular weight bands on a Western blot. Therefore, the most direct biochemical evidence of caspase-8 activation on a Western blot probed with a caspase-8 antibody is a reduction in the intensity of the full-length procaspase-8 band together with the appearance of smaller cleavage products.\n\nOption A describes exactly this pattern: a decrease in the procaspase-8 band with the appearance of new, smaller bands corresponding to cleaved, active caspase-8. Option B indicates accumulation of procaspase-8 without activation (no cleavage). Option C suggests phosphorylation and a higher apparent molecular weight, which is not the canonical mechanism of caspase activation. Option D indicates complete degradation, which is not specific for activation and would eliminate detection of both zymogen and cleaved forms. Option E suggests aggregation into a very high molecular weight species, which is not a hallmark of activation and would not represent functional caspase-8.\n\nThus, the most direct evidence for activation of caspase-8 is the appearance of cleaved, lower molecular weight bands with a concurrent decrease in the procaspase-8 band.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2304314"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems are robust and often have multiple, overlapping mechanisms to ensure critical functions are carried out. While the Fas-FasL interaction is a classic example of extrinsic apoptosis, it is not the only way an immune cell can eliminate a target. This final practice problem [@problem_id:2304326] presents a scenario that tests your understanding of the broader context of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, questioning what happens when one pathway is disabled. It encourages you to think beyond a single linear cascade and appreciate the versatility of the cellular machinery.", "problem": "Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a crucial process for tissue homeostasis and eliminating damaged or infected cells. One major pathway for inducing apoptosis is the extrinsic, or death receptor, pathway. A key interaction in this pathway involves the Fas Ligand (FasL), a protein expressed on the surface of activated immune cells like Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), and its corresponding Fas Receptor (FasR), present on the surface of many target cells. The binding of FasL to FasR initiates an intracellular signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of caspases and the execution of apoptosis.\n\nConsider a researcher studying a specific cell line that has been genetically engineered. This engineering has resulted in a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Fas Receptor (FasR), such that these cells do not express any functional FasR on their cell surface. These engineered cells are then co-cultured with activated Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) that are known to be capable of inducing cell death.\n\nAssuming the CTLs are fully functional, what is the most likely fate of the FasR-deficient engineered cells when exposed to these CTLs?\n\nA. The engineered cells will undergo rapid apoptosis as the Fas Ligand on the CTLs directly activates intracellular caspases, bypassing the need for a receptor.\n\nB. The engineered cells will be completely resistant to CTL-mediated killing and will continue to proliferate normally.\n\nC. The engineered cells will still undergo apoptosis, induced by the CTLs through an alternative mechanism involving the release of perforin and granzymes.\n\nD. The engineered cells will enter a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, known as senescence, because the apoptotic signal cannot be completed.\n\nE. The CTLs will undergo apoptosis themselves due to a process called \"fratricide,\" triggered by their inability to bind to the target cell's Fas Receptor.", "solution": "The extrinsic apoptosis pathway via Fas requires the presence of functional Fas Receptor (FasR) on the target cell surface. Fas Ligand (FasL) on Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) binds FasR, leading to receptor trimerization, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), recruitment of FADD, activation of procaspase-8 to caspase-8, and subsequent activation of downstream effector caspases. In the engineered cells described, the complete loss-of-function mutation in FasR abolishes this receptor-mediated pathway, so FasL cannot deliver a death signal to these cells through Fas.\n\nHowever, fully functional CTLs possess an alternative, Fas-independent killing mechanism: the granule exocytosis pathway. In this pathway, CTLs release perforin, which forms pores in the target cell membrane, allowing entry of granzymes, particularly granzyme B. Granzyme B directly cleaves and activates effector caspases (for example, procaspase-3) and also cleaves Bid to tBid, engaging the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, both culminating in apoptosis. This mechanism does not require FasR or any death receptor on the target cell.\n\nTherefore, although the engineered cells are resistant to FasL-FasR–mediated apoptosis, they are not protected from CTL-mediated killing overall and will still undergo apoptosis via the perforin–granzyme pathway. Evaluating the options: A is incorrect because FasL cannot signal without a receptor; B is incorrect because CTLs have a Fas-independent cytotoxic mechanism; D is incorrect because failure of one apoptotic pathway does not force senescence; E is incorrect because CTL fratricide is not triggered by a target cell’s lack of FasR. The correct choice is that CTLs will induce apoptosis through perforin and granzymes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2304326"}]}
