B-cell activation is a tightly controlled process, and this problem explores a key mechanism where the innate and adaptive immune systems cooperate.

One powerful mechanism involves the complement system, where the covalent attachment of the complement fragment C3d to an antigen can dramatically lower the antigen concentration required to trigger B-cell activation. This enhancement occurs because the antigen-C3d conjugate co-ligates the B-cell Receptor (BCR) with the Complement Receptor 2 (CR2), which is part of the B-cell co-receptor complex, leading to a much stronger intracellular signal.\n\nConsider a hypothetical in-vitro experiment designed to quantify this signaling enhancement. A population of B-cells is exposed to two different preparations of the same protein antigen, Antigen-X.\n1.  **Preparation A**: Antigen-X alone.\n2.  **Preparation B**: A conjugate of Antigen-X covalently linked to C3d, denoted as Antigen-X-C3d.\n\nB-cell activation is initiated when the total intracellular signal strength, generated by all engaged receptors on the cell surface, reaches a fixed threshold value, $S_{thresh}$.

The biologist focuses on a specific viral protein, VSP-alpha, and proposes a simplified quantitative model for its processing.\n\nThe model assumes the following:\n1.  The concentration of VSP-alpha within the phagosome is effectively maintained at a constant level, $C_p$.\n2.  VSP-alpha is transported from the phagosome into the cytosol through a specific translocator channel. The rate of increase in the cytosolic concentration of VSP-alpha, $C_c$, due to this transport is governed by the equation $J_{\\text{trans}} = P (C_p - C_c)$, where $P$ is the permeability constant of the channel.\n3.  In the cytosol, VSP-alpha is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. This degradation follows first-order kinetics, and the corresponding rate of decrease in cytosolic concentration is given by $R_{\\text{deg}} = k_{\\text{deg}} C_c$, where $k_{\\text{deg}}$ is the degradation rate constant.\n4.  Experimental measurements indicate that under normal physiological conditions, the degradation process is much faster than the transport process, with the relationship between the constants being $k_{\\text{deg}} = 7P$.\n\nTo further study this pathway, the biologist treats the dendritic cells with a novel proteasome inhibitor called 'Proteasidin'. This inhibitor modifies the degradation rate constant according to the formula:\n$$k'_{\\text{deg}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{deg}}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_I}}$$\nwhere $[I]$ is the concentration of Proteasidin and $K_I$ is its inhibition constant.\n\nThe cells are treated with a concentration of Proteasidin such that $[I] = 3 K_I$.
