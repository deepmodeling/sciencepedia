It is known that the host's primary defense against this virus involves the recognition and destruction of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The virologist identifies a mutant sub-clone of the fibroblast cell line that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the genes encoding the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). This mutation results in a completely non-functional TAP protein complex. Assume all other cellular processes, including viral replication and the synthesis of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins, are normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most direct and immediate consequence of this TAP mutation on the infected cell's ability to interact with the immune system?\n\nA. The cell will be unable to present antigens to helper T cells, as the processing of exogenous viral particles via the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II pathway will be blocked.\n\nB. The cell will show a significant increase in the surface expression of empty, peptide-receptive MHC Class I molecules, leading to an aberrant autoimmune response.\n\nC. The cell will fail to present endogenously synthesized viral peptides on its surface, rendering it effectively invisible to recognition and lysis by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\n\nD. The cell will be unable to produce antibodies against the virus because the TAP protein is essential for B cell activation and maturation.\n\nE. The transport of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm will be inhibited, thus preventing the assembly of new virions.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the role of the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). TAP is an ATP-dependent peptide transporter located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Its primary function is to translocate peptides generated in the cytosol (typically by proteasomal degradation of endogenous proteins, including viral proteins synthesized within the infected cell) into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. There, these peptides are loaded onto nascent MHC Class I molecules in a peptide-loading complex. Stable expression of MHC Class I on the cell surface requires binding of a suitable peptide; without peptide loading, MHC Class I heavy chain and beta-2 microglobulin form unstable complexes that are retained in the ER and often degraded, leading to markedly reduced surface expression of peptide–MHC Class I complexes.\n\nCytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are CD8^{+} T cells, survey cells by recognizing specific peptide–MHC Class I complexes on target cell surfaces. Therefore, if TAP is non-functional, endogenous viral peptides cannot enter the ER, cannot be loaded onto MHC Class I, and peptide–MHC Class I complexes will not be presented on the cell surface. The direct immunological consequence is that virus-specific CTLs cannot recognize and lyse the infected cell. Although such cells may become susceptible to natural killer cell-mediated lysis due to “missing self” (reduced MHC Class I), the question asks for the most direct and immediate consequence for interaction with CTLs, which is loss of antigen presentation via MHC Class I.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA. Incorrect. Presentation to helper T cells involves the exogenous pathway via MHC Class II, which uses invariant chain, CLIP, and HLA-DM, and does not require TAP. TAP deficiency does not block MHC Class II antigen presentation.\n\nB. Incorrect. Empty peptide-receptive MHC Class I molecules are unstable and are not significantly expressed on the surface; instead, they are retained and degraded. TAP deficiency decreases, not increases, surface MHC Class I with bound peptide.\n\nC. Correct. Without TAP, endogenously synthesized viral peptides are not transported into the ER, preventing loading onto MHC Class I and thereby preventing recognition and lysis by virus-specific CTLs.\n\nD. Incorrect. TAP is not required for B cell activation, maturation, or antibody production, and fibroblasts do not produce antibodies. This is unrelated to TAP function.\n\nE. Incorrect. TAP does not transport RNA; it is specific for peptides at the ER membrane. Nuclear export of RNA uses entirely different machinery.\n\nThus, the most direct and immediate consequence is failure to present endogenous viral peptides via MHC Class I, rendering the infected cell invisible to CTLs, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2304155"}, {"introduction": "While the MHC Class I pathway surveys the intracellular environment, the MHC Class II pathway allows specialized cells to report on threats from outside. This practice [@problem_id:2304149] focuses on a crucial quality-control step in this process: the function of the HLA-DM protein. By considering a scenario where this molecular editor is absent, you will understand how the immune system ensures that a placeholder peptide, CLIP, is efficiently swapped for a genuine fragment of a foreign antigen, preparing it for presentation to helper T cells.", "problem": "In a healthy professional Antigen Presenting Cell (APC), the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II pathway is responsible for presenting peptides from extracellular antigens to T helper cells. This process involves several key proteins. Newly synthesized MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum associate with the Invariant chain (Ii), which places a fragment of itself, known as the Class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP), into the MHC's peptide-binding groove. This complex is transported to an endosomal compartment. There, the protein HLA-DM catalyzes the exchange of the CLIP fragment for a peptide derived from a degraded extracellular antigen.\n\nConsider an individual with a rare genetic disorder that results in the production of completely non-functional HLA-DM proteins in their APCs. If you were to isolate MHC class II molecules from the cell surface of one of this patient's APCs that has been exposed to an extracellular bacterium, which of the following would you predominantly expect to find occupying the peptide-binding groove?\n\nA. The CLIP fragment.\n\nB. An empty peptide-binding groove.\n\nC. A peptide derived from an intracellular viral protein.\n\nD. A peptide derived from the extracellular bacterium.\n\nE. The full-length Invariant chain (Ii).", "solution": "We analyze the physiological MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. Newly synthesized MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum associate with the Invariant chain (Ii). Ii occludes the peptide-binding groove to prevent premature peptide binding and directs the complex to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. In endosomes, proteolysis of Ii leaves the Class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP) occupying the peptide-binding groove. The non-classical MHC molecule HLA-DM catalyzes the removal of CLIP and stabilizes loading of high-affinity peptides generated from degraded extracellular antigens. The MHC class II–peptide complex is then transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD4 T cells.\n\nGiven a loss-of-function mutation rendering HLA-DM non-functional, the critical catalytic step of CLIP release and peptide exchange is severely impaired. As a result:\n- CLIP cannot be efficiently removed from the MHC class II groove, so MHC class II molecules predominantly retain CLIP.\n- An empty peptide-binding groove is unlikely because CLIP remains bound and stabilizes the groove in the absence of HLA-DM-mediated exchange.\n- Loading of peptides derived from intracellular proteins is characteristic of the MHC class I pathway, not MHC class II, thus intracellular viral peptides would not predominate.\n- Loading of peptides from the extracellular bacterium requires HLA-DM for efficient CLIP exchange; without HLA-DM, this step is blocked.\n- The full-length Ii does not persist to the cell surface; it is proteolytically processed in endosomes, leaving only CLIP.\n\nTherefore, on the cell surface of the patient’s APCs, MHC class II molecules will predominantly display the CLIP fragment in their peptide-binding groove.

Building upon the molecular mechanism of peptide editing by HLA-DM, this problem [@problem_id:2304141] places you in the role of a biophysicist. You will interpret data from a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiment to calculate the reaction rate ($k_{obs}$), connecting the cellular event of peptide exchange to measurable kinetic principles.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the process of peptide editing, which is crucial for the adaptive immune response. This process involves the replacement of low-affinity peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules with high-affinity peptides. The reaction is catalyzed by a specialized protein called Human Leukocyte Antigen DM (HLA-DM).\n\nTo quantify the kinetics of this exchange, the biologist sets up an in-vitro experiment using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). A solution is prepared containing MHC class II molecules that are chemically labeled with a quencher molecule (FRET acceptor). These MHC molecules are pre-loaded with a synthetic low-affinity peptide that is labeled with a fluorescent donor dye. In this bound state, the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, and the donor's fluorescence is efficiently quenched. The initial fluorescence intensity of this solution, representing the baseline quenched state, is measured as $I_{min} = 150$ arbitrary units (a.u.). The theoretical maximum fluorescence intensity, which would occur if all fluorescent peptides were unbound and far from the quencher, is determined to be $I_{max} = 950$ a.u.\n\nAt time $t=0$, a large excess of a non-fluorescent, high-affinity peptide and a catalytic concentration of HLA-DM are added to the solution. This initiates the displacement of the fluorescent low-affinity peptide. As the fluorescent peptide is released from the MHC molecule, its fluorescence is no longer quenched, and the total fluorescence intensity of the solution increases over time. The exchange reaction is sufficiently fast that it can be treated as a pseudo-first-order process.\n\nAfter the reaction has proceeded for $t = 120$ seconds, the fluorescence intensity of the mixture is measured to be $I(t) = 680$ a.u.\n\nBased on this single time-point measurement, calculate the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k_{obs}$, for the HLA-DM catalyzed displacement reaction.
