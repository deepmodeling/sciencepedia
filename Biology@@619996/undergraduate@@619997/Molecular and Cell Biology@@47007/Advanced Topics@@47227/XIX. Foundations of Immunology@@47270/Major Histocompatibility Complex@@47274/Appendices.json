This practice explores the genetic principles that generate this diversity at the level of an individual. By applying your knowledge of polygeny (multiple gene loci) and codominant expression, you will calculate the total number of unique MHC class I protein types that a single heterozygous person can display on their cells, providing a tangible understanding of our built-in defense arsenal ([@problem_id:2278323]).", "problem": "In human immunology, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins are crucial for the adaptive immune system's ability to recognize foreign invaders. MHC class I molecules are found on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells and present endogenous peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. A functional MHC class I molecule is a heterodimer, consisting of a highly polymorphic alpha chain and a non-polymorphic protein called beta-2 microglobulin. In humans, the genes encoding the alpha chain are part of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system, specifically the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C gene loci.\n\nAn individual's set of HLA alleles is inherited from their parents. These genes are expressed codominantly, meaning that the protein products of both inherited alleles (one from each parent) for a given locus are synthesized and expressed on the cell surface.\n\nConsider a person who is heterozygous at all three classical MHC class I loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Assuming that each unique alpha chain successfully pairs with a beta-2 microglobulin molecule to form a stable complex on the cell surface, what is the total number of different types of MHC class I molecules that can be expressed on a single one of this person's cells?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 9\n\nE. 12", "solution": "MHC class I molecules are heterodimers consisting of a polymorphic alpha chain (encoded at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and a non-polymorphic beta-2 microglobulin. The genes are expressed codominantly, so a heterozygous individual at a given locus expresses both alleles' alpha chains.\n\nLet the set of loci be $\\{A,B,C\\}$. For each locus $\\ell$, heterozygosity implies $2$ distinct alpha chains are produced, so the number of distinct alpha chains per locus is $2$. Since beta-2 microglobulin is non-polymorphic and the alpha chain does not heterodimerize with other alpha chains, the total number of distinct MHC class I molecules equals the total number of distinct alpha chains across loci, not a product across loci.\n\nThus the total number expressed on one cell is\n$$\nN=\\sum_{\\ell \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} 2 = 2+2+2 = 6.\n$$\nThis corresponds to two types each from HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278323"}, {"introduction": "Beyond genetics, the function of the MHC system depends on precise cellular logistics. An immune cell must decide how to process an antigen based on its location, activating either the MHC class I or class II pathway. This problem challenges you with a dynamic scenario where a pathogen moves from one cellular compartment to another, forcing you to think critically about what truly defines an antigen as \"endogenous\" or \"exogenous\" and which T cell response it will ultimately trigger ([@problem_id:2321851]).", "problem": "A professional Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC), specifically a macrophage, encounters and phagocytoses a pathogenic bacterium known as *Cytosolia perfringens*. Initially, the bacterium is contained within a phagolysosome. However, *C. perfringens* has evolved a sophisticated escape mechanism: it produces a toxin that lyses the phagolysosomal membrane, allowing the bacterium to enter and proliferate freely within the host cell's cytoplasm.\n\nConsidering the distinct cellular locations of the bacterium before and after its escape, which Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) pathway will be the *primary* route for presenting peptides derived from this bacterium to T-lymphocytes *after* it has established a cytosolic presence?\n\nA. The MHC class I pathway, because the bacterial proteins are now synthesized and located within the cytosol, making them endogenous antigens.\n\nB. The MHC class II pathway, because the bacterium was originally acquired through phagocytosis, classifying it as an exogenous antigen regardless of its subsequent location.\n\nC. Both MHC class I and MHC class II pathways will be activated with equal prominence, as macrophages are equipped to use both presentation systems simultaneously.\n\nD. Neither pathway will be effective, as the bacterium's escape from the endocytic system allows it to completely evade immune surveillance by this host cell.\n\nE. A novel, non-MHC pathway will be activated that is specifically designed to handle cytosolic bacteria by directly signaling to natural killer (NK) cells.", "solution": "We identify the relevant antigen processing pathways based on subcellular localization at the time of processing. The MHC class I pathway primarily presents peptides derived from antigens located in the cytosol (endogenous pathway). Proteins present in the cytosol are ubiquitinated, degraded by the proteasome into peptides, transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP, loaded onto MHC class I molecules, and presented to $CD8^+$ T cells. In contrast, the MHC class II pathway presents peptides from antigens contained within endosomal and lysosomal compartments (exogenous pathway), where proteins are degraded by endosomal/lysosomal proteases and loaded onto MHC class II for recognition by $CD4^+$ T cells.\n\nIn the scenario described, the bacterium initially resides in a phagolysosome (favoring MHC class II). However, after escape into the cytosol, its proteins are now in the cytosolic compartment and will be processed by the endogenous (MHC class I) pathway. This mirrors known cytosolic bacterial pathogens (for example, Listeria monocytogenes) that induce MHC class I presentation from bacterial proteins present in the host cytosol.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is correct: cytosolic localization leads to primary processing via MHC class I and presentation to $CD8^+$ T cells.\n- Option B is incorrect because the relevant determinant is the compartment of processing at the time of antigen degradation, not the original mode of entry.\n- Option C is incorrect because while both pathways may operate in the same cell, they will not be equally prominent for cytosolic antigens; the primary pathway for cytosolic antigens is MHC class I.\n- Option D is incorrect because cytosolic antigens are efficiently surveyed by the MHC class I pathway.\n- Option E is incorrect; there is no novel non-MHC pathway specialized for this purpose; NK cell activation is not a replacement for antigen presentation in this context.\n\nThus, the primary route after cytosolic escape is MHC class I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2321851"}, {"introduction": "The role of MHC molecules extends far beyond antigen presentation; they are fundamental to shaping the entire T-cell repertoire. During their development in the thymus, T cells undergo a rigorous \"education\" process called positive selection, which requires them to recognize self-MHC molecules. This exercise uses a real-world immunodeficiency, Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome, to illustrate the critical and non-redundant role of MHC class II expression in the maturation and survival of the CD4+ helper T cell population ([@problem_id:2321891]).", "problem": "A rare congenital immunodeficiency, known as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type II, is characterized by a \"loss-of-function\" mutation in genes that regulate the expression of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. In individuals affected by a severe form of this syndrome, their antigen-presenting cells (such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells) completely fail to display MHC class II proteins on their surfaces. However, the expression and function of MHC class I molecules on all nucleated cells remain entirely normal.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, which of the following lymphocyte populations would be most severely depleted or absent in the peripheral blood of these patients due to a critical failure in its developmental and maturation process within the primary lymphoid organs?\n\nA. B lymphocytes\n\nB. $CD8^+$ T lymphocytes (Cytotoxic T cells)\n\nC. $CD4^+$ T lymphocytes (Helper T cells)\n\nD. Natural Killer (NK) cells\n\nE. All of the above lymphocyte populations", "solution": "Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome type II is caused by loss-of-function mutations in trans-acting regulators of MHC class II gene expression (for example CIITA or RFX components), leading to a global absence of MHC class II expression on all cell types that normally express it, including professional antigen-presenting cells and thymic epithelial cells. MHC class I expression remains normal.\n\nT cell development in the thymus proceeds from double-negative to double-positive thymocytes, which then undergo positive selection in the thymic cortex. Positive selection requires that the T cell receptor on a double-positive thymocyte recognize self-peptide presented on self-MHC molecules on cortical thymic epithelial cells. The fate decision is MHC-restricted: thymocytes whose receptors recognize self-peptide presented on MHC class I are positively selected into the CD8 lineage, and those that recognize self-peptide presented on MHC class II are positively selected into the CD4 lineage. Without MHC class II expression on thymic epithelial cells, positive selection into the CD4 lineage cannot occur, resulting in profound depletion or absence of mature $CD4^+$ T lymphocytes in the periphery. In contrast, because MHC class I expression is intact, positive selection and maturation of $CD8^+$ T lymphocytes proceed normally.\n\nB lymphocyte development occurs in the bone marrow and does not require MHC class II for maturation; although B cell function will be markedly impaired due to the absence of T helper cell help, B cell numbers are not primarily depleted by this defect. Natural killer cell development and function do not require MHC class II and remain present.\n\nTherefore, the lymphocyte population most severely depleted or absent due to failed development and maturation in the primary lymphoid organ (the thymus) is $CD4^+$ T lymphocytes (helper T cells).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321891"}]}
