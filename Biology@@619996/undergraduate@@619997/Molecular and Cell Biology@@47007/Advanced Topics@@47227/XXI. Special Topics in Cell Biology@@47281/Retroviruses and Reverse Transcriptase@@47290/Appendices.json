{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a complex biological pathway, like a retroviral infection, begins with mapping its key steps. Just as a builder must follow a blueprint in the correct sequence, a virus must execute a precise series of molecular events to successfully replicate. This exercise [@problem_id:2336103] challenges you to assemble the chronological sequence of the retroviral life cycle, providing a crucial framework for understanding how these viruses manipulate host cells.", "problem": "A productive infection by a retrovirus, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), involves a sequence of intricate molecular events that commandeer the host cell's machinery. Below are five key events that occur during the retroviral life cycle.\n\nI. Integration of the viral DNA into the host genome.\nII. Entry of the viral core into the host cell cytoplasm.\nIII. Synthesis of a double-stranded DNA copy from the viral RNA template.\nIV. Assembly of new virions and their release from the host cell.\nV. Synthesis of viral polyproteins by host cell ribosomes.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly arranges these events in chronological order, from the initial infection of a host cell to the release of new viral particles?\n\nA. II → III → I → V → IV\n\nB. II → V → III → I → IV\n\nC. III → II → I → V → IV\n\nD. II → III → V → I → IV\n\nE. V → II → III → I → IV", "solution": "A productive retroviral infection proceeds through conserved molecular steps governed by viral and host factors. The earliest event among the listed choices is entry of the viral core into the host cytoplasm after envelope fusion with the host membrane. This corresponds to event II. \n\nOnce the core is in the cytoplasm, the viral reverse transcriptase uses the single-stranded viral RNA as a template to synthesize a DNA copy. Mechanistically, minus-strand DNA is synthesized, the RNA template is degraded by the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase, and plus-strand DNA is synthesized to yield a double-stranded DNA. This is event III and necessarily follows event II because reverse transcription requires the viral core to be inside the cytoplasm.\n\nThe newly formed double-stranded viral DNA associates with integrase and other proteins to form the pre-integration complex, which is transported into the nucleus. The viral DNA is then covalently integrated into the host genome by the viral integrase. This step, event I, precedes efficient viral gene expression in a productive infection because the integrated provirus serves as the template for host RNA polymerase II.\n\nAfter integration, the host transcriptional machinery transcribes the proviral DNA to produce viral mRNAs and genomic RNA. Host ribosomes then translate these mRNAs into viral polyproteins (e.g., Gag, Gag-Pol, and Env-related products), which is event V. This translation step requires prior integration for robust, regulated expression in the canonical retroviral life cycle.\n\nFinally, the newly synthesized viral components assemble at the host cell membrane. Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins package the genomic RNA, bud from the plasma membrane, and the virions are released. Post-budding proteolytic processing by the viral protease produces mature infectious particles. This is event IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is II → III → I → V → IV, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2336103"}, {"introduction": "Having established the overall sequence of infection, we now zoom in on its central enzyme: reverse transcriptase. This unique protein is not a one-trick pony; it possesses multiple distinct catalytic activities that work in concert to convert RNA into DNA. This problem [@problem_id:2336077] presents a thought experiment, a common approach in scientific discovery, where a hypothetical drug disables one specific function, the RNase H activity, allowing you to deduce its critical role in the reverse transcription process.", "problem": "A research team is developing novel antiretroviral therapies. They identify a new compound, \"Xenovir-H,\" that targets the reverse transcriptase enzyme of a retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase is a multifunctional enzyme essential for the viral life cycle. It possesses two primary catalytic functions: a DNA polymerase activity, which synthesizes a DNA strand using an RNA template, and an RNase H (Ribonuclease H) activity, which specifically degrades the RNA strand within an RNA-DNA hybrid molecule.\n\nBiochemical assays reveal that Xenovir-H is a highly specific inhibitor of the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase. It has no measurable effect on the enzyme's DNA polymerase activity. If a host cell is infected with this retrovirus and is subsequently treated with Xenovir-H, which of the following molecular intermediates of the reverse transcription process would be expected to accumulate to abnormally high levels within the cell?\n\nA. Single-stranded viral RNA (ssRNA).\n\nB. Single-stranded viral DNA (ssDNA).\n\nC. Double-stranded viral DNA (dsDNA).\n\nD. An RNA-DNA hybrid molecule.\n\nE. Free, unincorporated reverse transcriptase enzymes.", "solution": "Reverse transcriptase has two catalytic activities essential for reverse transcription:\n- **RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity**, which synthesizes a DNA strand using the viral RNA as a template.\n- **RNase H activity**, which specifically degrades the RNA strand of an RNA-DNA hybrid, allowing removal of the RNA template and generation of primers (e.g., the polypurine tract) for second-strand DNA synthesis.\n\nNormal sequence of reverse transcription:\n1) The viral genome begins as single-stranded RNA (ssRNA).\n2) Reverse transcriptase polymerase synthesizes the minus-strand DNA complementary to the RNA template, yielding an RNA-DNA hybrid intermediate.\n3) RNase H degrades the RNA within the RNA-DNA hybrid, leaving predominantly DNA and appropriate primer fragments.\n4) The polymerase then synthesizes the plus-strand DNA, producing double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).\n\nEffect of inhibiting RNase H with Xenovir-H while polymerase activity remains intact:\n- Step 2 proceeds normally: minus-strand DNA is synthesized on the RNA template, forming an RNA-DNA hybrid.\n- Step 3 is blocked: the RNA strand within the RNA-DNA hybrid is not degraded.\n- Consequently, the RNA-DNA hybrid persists and accumulates.\n- Plus-strand DNA synthesis (step 4) is impaired because removal of the RNA template and proper primer processing require RNase H; thus dsDNA does not accumulate.\n- Free ssDNA does not accumulate, because the newly made DNA remains hybridized to the intact RNA template rather than existing as isolated ssDNA.\n- Free ssRNA does not accumulate abnormally; it is engaged as template in hybrids and not degraded to free ssRNA by RNase H.\n- Free reverse transcriptase enzyme levels are not expected to accumulate specifically as a molecular intermediate of reverse transcription.\n\nTherefore, the molecular intermediate that accumulates is the RNA-DNA hybrid molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2336077"}, {"introduction": "The process of reverse transcription is not only mechanistically fascinating but also has profound consequences for viral evolution.
