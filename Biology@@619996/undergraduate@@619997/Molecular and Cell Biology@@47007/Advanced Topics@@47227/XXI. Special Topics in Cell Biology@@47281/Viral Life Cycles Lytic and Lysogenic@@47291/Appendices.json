This practice introduces the plaque assay, a classic and essential technique for quantifying infectious bacteriophages. By understanding how to calculate the original concentration of a phage stock from the number of plaques on a diluted plate, you are engaging with the direct visual evidence of the lytic cycle in action and learning a fundamental skill for any virology lab [@problem_id:2347488].", "id": "2347488", "problem": "A researcher in a biotechnology company is developing a bacteriophage-based therapeutic to combat infections caused by a specific strain of pathogenic bacteria. To ensure the efficacy and safety of the final product, the concentration of active phage particles in the stock solution must be accurately determined. The researcher performs a serial dilution of the phage stock and then conducts a plaque assay. In this procedure, a small volume of a diluted phage solution is mixed with a large number of host bacteria and spread onto a nutrient agar plate. Each viable phage infects a bacterium, replicates, and lyses it, releasing progeny phages that infect and lyse surrounding bacteria. This chain reaction creates a clear, circular zone of clearing called a plaque on the otherwise opaque lawn of bacterial growth.\n\nThe researcher takes $0.100$ mL from the $10^{-6}$ dilution tube and plates it. After incubation, a count of the plaques on the plate reveals 45 distinct clearings. Assuming that each plaque originates from a single viable phage particle, calculate the concentration of the original, undiluted phage stock. Express your answer in units of Plaque-Forming Units per milliliter (PFU/mL). Your final answer must be in scientific notation, rounded to two significant figures.\n\n", "solution": "Define $C_{0}$ as the concentration of the original phage stock in PFU per milliliter. A dilution of $10^{-6}$ reduces the concentration to $C_{d} = C_{0} \\times 10^{-6}$. In a plaque assay, the number of plaques $P$ equals the number of viable phage particles plated, which is the product of the diluted concentration and the plated volume $V$:\n$$\nP = C_{d} V = C_{0} \\times 10^{-6} \\times V.\n$$\nSolving for $C_{0}$ gives\n$$\nC_{0} = \\frac{P}{V \\times 10^{-6}}.\n$$\nSubstitute $P = 45$ and $V = 0.100$ mL:\n$$\nC_{0} = \\frac{45}{0.100 \\times 10^{-6}}.\n$$\nRewrite $0.100$ as $1.00 \\times 10^{-1}$ to combine powers of ten:\n$$\n0.100 \\times 10^{-6} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-1} \\times 10^{-6} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nC_{0} = \\frac{45}{1.00 \\times 10^{-7}} = 45 \\times 10^{7} = 4.5 \\times 10^{8}.\n$$\nExpressed in scientific notation and rounded to two significant figures, the concentration of the original stock is $4.5 \\times 10^{8}$ PFU per milliliter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.5 \\times 10^{8}}$$"}, {"introduction": "While the lytic cycle provides a clear way to count phages, many viruses have a more subtle strategy: the lysogenic cycle. This thought experiment probes the molecular machinery essential for establishing lysogeny by asking you to predict the outcome of a specific genetic knockout. Understanding the function of key enzymes like integrase, which physically splices the viral DNA into the host chromosome, is crucial for grasping how a virus can switch between active destruction and dormant persistence [@problem_id:2347499].", "id": "2347499", "problem": "A research team is studying a newly-isolated temperate bacteriophage, which is a type of virus that infects bacteria and can choose between two distinct life cycles. In the lytic cycle, the phage rapidly replicates and destroys the host cell to release new virions. In the lysogenic cycle, the phage integrates its Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) into the host bacterium's chromosome, becoming a dormant \"prophage\" that is replicated along with the host's genome. The key enzyme responsible for this integration event is called integrase.\n\nThe researchers use genetic engineering to create a mutant version of this phage. This mutant carries a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the integrase enzyme, rendering the enzyme completely non-functional. They then use this mutant phage to infect a culture of susceptible *Escherichia coli* bacteria under environmental conditions that would normally favor the lysogenic cycle for the wild-type (non-mutant) phage.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most direct and certain consequence of this specific mutation on the phage's life cycle?\n\nA. The mutant phage will be unable to inject its DNA into the *E. coli* cells.\nB. The mutant phage will successfully establish a stable lysogenic state, but will be unable to be induced into the lytic cycle later.\nC. The mutant phage will be forced into the lytic cycle, resulting in the production of new phages and the lysis of the host cells.\nD. The mutant phage's DNA will persist within the host cell as a self-replicating, circular plasmid, but will neither integrate nor cause cell lysis.\nE. The host cell's restriction enzymes will immediately degrade the mutant phage's DNA upon injection, preventing any infection cycle.\n\n", "solution": "Temperate bacteriophages have two fates: the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle. Entry into the lysogenic cycle requires site-specific recombination between the phage attachment site and the bacterial attachment site, catalyzed by the phage-encoded integrase. Therefore, integrase is necessary for establishing a stable prophage by integration into the host chromosome.\n\nA loss-of-function mutation in the integrase gene abolishes the enzymeâ€™s recombinase activity; thus, the phage DNA cannot integrate into the host genome. This directly and certainly prevents establishment of lysogeny. The injection of DNA is mediated by phage structural components and is independent of integrase, so option A is incorrect. Stable maintenance of the prophage as an extrachromosomal, self-replicating plasmid (option D) requires dedicated plasmid replication and partition systems, which are not provided by many canonical integrative temperate phages (for example, phage lambda relies on integration for stable inheritance), so this is not the expected consequence of integrase loss. Option B is false because establishment of lysogeny itself fails without integration. Option E involves host restriction-modification systems and is unrelated to integrase function.\n\nWith the lysogenic pathway blocked at the integration step, the remaining viable developmental pathway is the lytic cycle, even under conditions that would normally favor lysogeny, leading to phage replication, assembly, and host lysis. Thus, the most direct and certain consequence of the integrase loss-of-function mutation is that the phage is forced into the lytic cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Confirming a biological event at the molecular level is a cornerstone of modern biology. This practice challenges you to design a simple yet powerful experiment using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to prove that a phage has truly integrated its DNA into the host genome. This exercise connects the abstract concept of lysogeny to a concrete experimental result, demonstrating how we use molecular tools to verify our hypotheses about unseen processes [@problem_id:2347503].", "id": "2347503", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is investigating the life cycle of a newly discovered temperate bacteriophage, designated Phage Z, which exclusively infects the bacterium *Astroides hydrogenophilus*. The bacterium possesses a single, circular chromosome of 4.2 million base pairs (bp). The linear genome of Phage Z is 38,000 bp long. Through genetic mapping, the researchers have determined that Phage Z integrates its genome into the bacterial chromosome at a single, specific attachment site, known as the *attB* site, located at coordinate 3,105,400 on the bacterial chromosome.\n\nTo verify the formation of a lysogen (a bacterium containing an integrated prophage), the team designs a specific diagnostic test using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), a technique used to amplify a specific segment of DNA. They synthesize two primers for this purpose:\n- **Primer Fwd**: A forward primer that anneals to the bacterial chromosome. Its\n3' end, from which DNA synthesis begins, is located at chromosome coordinate 3,105,150.\n- **Primer Rev**: A reverse primer that anneals to the phage genome. Its 3' end is located at a position corresponding to 225 bp from the end of the phage genome that initially inserts into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nAssuming that Phage Z has successfully integrated into the *Astroides hydrogenophilus* chromosome to form a prophage, what is the expected size of the DNA fragment that will be amplified by this specific PCR experiment? Express your answer in base pairs (bp).\n\n", "solution": "The core principle of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the amplification of a specific DNA segment located between a forward primer and a reverse primer. For an amplification product to be generated, the two primers must bind to the same continuous stretch of template DNA, oriented such that they point towards each other.\n\nIn this problem, one primer (Primer Fwd) binds to the bacterial chromosome, and the other primer (Primer Rev) binds to the phage genome. In a culture of uninfected bacteria or in a mixture containing only free phage particles, these two primers target separate DNA molecules. Therefore, no PCR product would be formed under these conditions.\n\nHowever, the problem statement asks for the result assuming the phage has entered the lysogenic cycle and integrated its genome into the bacterial chromosome. This integration event creates a single, larger, continuous DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome now containing the prophage). This physical linkage makes it possible for the PCR to amplify a fragment spanning the junction between the bacterial and phage DNA.\n\nLet's determine the boundaries of the DNA segment to be amplified. The amplified region starts at the 3' end of the forward primer and ends at the 3' end of the reverse primer.\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the forward primer's 3' end:** Primer Fwd's 3' end is at coordinate 3,105,150 on the bacterial chromosome.\n\n2.  **Identify the location of the integration site:** The phage genome integrates at the *attB* site, which is at coordinate 3,105,400 on the bacterial chromosome.\n\n3.  **Calculate the length of the amplified segment from the bacterial genome:** This is the distance from the forward primer's 3' end to the integration junction.\n    Length_bacterial = |Integration site coordinate - Primer Fwd coordinate|\n    Length_bacterial = |3,105,400 bp - 3,105,150 bp| = 250 bp.\n\n4.  **Identify the location of the reverse primer's 3' end:** Primer Rev's 3' end is located 225 bp into the phage genome, measured from the point of integration.\n\n5.  **Calculate the length of the amplified segment from the phage genome:** This is the distance from the integration junction to the reverse primer's 3' end.\n    Length_phage = 225 bp.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total size of the PCR product:** The total amplified fragment will be the sum of the segment from the bacterial DNA and the segment from the phage DNA.\n    Total size = Length_bacterial + Length_phage\n    Total size = 250 bp + 225 bp = 475 bp.\n\nTherefore, if the phage has successfully integrated, the PCR experiment using Primer Fwd and Primer Rev will produce a DNA fragment of 475 base pairs. This specific band, when visualized on an electrophoresis gel, would serve as positive confirmation of lysogeny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{475}$$"}]}
