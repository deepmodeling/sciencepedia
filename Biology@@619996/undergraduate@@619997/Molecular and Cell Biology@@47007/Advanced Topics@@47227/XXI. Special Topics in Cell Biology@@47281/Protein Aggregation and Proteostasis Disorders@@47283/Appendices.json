This exercise explores how a single, seemingly minor change—a point mutation that swaps a charged, water-loving amino acid for a hydrophobic one on a protein's surface—can fundamentally alter its behavior in the cell's aqueous environment. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you will gain a tangible grasp of the hydrophobic effect, a primary force that can cause proteins to lose solubility and form dangerous aggregates. [@problem_id:2332308]", "problem": "A researcher is studying a newly identified globular enzyme that functions within the aqueous environment of the cell's cytosol. The gene encoding this enzyme undergoes a single point mutation. This genetic alteration leads to a change in the translated protein sequence: a lysine (Lys) residue, which was originally located on the solvent-exposed surface of the folded protein, is replaced by a valine (Val) residue. Based on the fundamental principles of protein chemistry and folding, what is the most probable effect of this specific amino acid substitution on the biophysical properties of the enzyme population in the cytosol?\n\nA. The solubility of the enzyme will increase, and its tendency to form aggregates will decrease.\n\nB. The solubility of the enzyme will decrease, and its tendency to form aggregates will increase.\n\nC. The mutation will have no significant impact on either the enzyme's solubility or its aggregation tendency.\n\nD. The enzyme will become more rigid and catalytically more efficient due to enhanced structural stability.\n\nE. The enzyme's net surface charge will become more positive, leading to increased repulsion between protein molecules.", "solution": "We start by identifying the physicochemical properties of the residues involved. Lysine (Lys) has a basic side chain that is protonated at cytosolic pH, contributing a positive charge and strong favorable interactions with water through ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding. Valine (Val) has a branched aliphatic side chain that is nonpolar and hydrophobic, lacking charge and hydrogen-bonding capacity.\n\nIn globular proteins in aqueous cytosol, the fundamental folding principle is amphipathic organization: hydrophobic residues are buried in the core, while polar and charged residues are displayed on the solvent-exposed surface to maximize favorable solvation and minimize the free energy of the system. Replacing a surface-exposed Lys with Val disrupts this organization by introducing a hydrophobic moiety on the surface.\n\nConsider the free energy of solvation for a side chain, conceptualized as a transfer free energy from a nonpolar environment to water. Denote the hydration free energy by $\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{X})$. For a charged Lys side chain, $\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Lys})$ is strongly negative (favorable), whereas for a hydrophobic Val side chain, $\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Val})$ is less negative or positive (unfavorable). The mutation changes the surface solvation free energy by\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{surface}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Val}) - \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Lys}) > 0,\n$$\nwhich raises the free energy of the solvated, monomeric enzyme.\n\nAn exposed hydrophobic patch increases the solvent-excluded surface area drive to minimize contact with water. A standard interfacial free energy model gives an aggregation driving force approximately proportional to the increase in exposed hydrophobic area $A_{\\text{hyd}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{agg}} \\approx -\\gamma \\,\\Delta A_{\\text{hyd}},\n$$\nwith $\\gamma>0$ representing an effective water-hydrophobe interfacial free energy density. By replacing Lys with Val on the surface, $\\Delta A_{\\text{hyd}}>0$, which makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{agg}}<0$ more favorable, thereby increasing the tendency to self-associate and aggregate.\n\nSolubility is determined by the condition of equal chemical potentials at the solubility limit, $\\mu_{\\text{monomer}}^{\\text{solution}} = \\mu_{\\text{aggregate}}^{\\text{solid}}$. Enhancing intermolecular attraction (here via hydrophobic interactions) lowers $\\mu_{\\text{aggregate}}$ relative to the solvated monomer, thus reducing the equilibrium solubility. Therefore, the mutation decreases solubility.\n\nElectrostatics further support this conclusion. The net surface charge decreases by one unit of positive charge because Lys contributes approximately $+1$ at cytosolic pH while Val contributes $0$. If the original net charge is $Q$, after mutation it becomes\n$$\nQ' = Q - 1.\n$$\nReducing like-charge on protein surfaces diminishes electrostatic repulsion between molecules, which further promotes aggregation and does not increase it. Hence a claim that the net surface charge becomes more positive is incorrect; it becomes less positive.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is inconsistent with the introduction of a hydrophobic residue on the surface.\n- B is consistent with increased hydrophobic exposure and reduced electrostatic repulsion, leading to decreased solubility and increased aggregation.\n- C is unlikely given the strong qualitative change in surface properties.\n- D is not supported; introducing a hydrophobic residue on the surface does not generally enhance stability or catalytic efficiency and often destabilizes the soluble monomer.\n- E is incorrect in the direction of charge change; the net positive charge decreases, not increases.\n\nTherefore, the most probable effect is decreased solubility with increased aggregation tendency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2332308"}, {"introduction": "When a protein misfolds, the cell's proteostasis network must decide its fate: rescue or degradation. This practice delves into the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), highlighting the critical, dynamic balance between tagging a protein for destruction and rescuing it from that fate. You will analyze a scenario where a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) becomes hyperactive, revealing how tipping this balance toward rescue can paradoxically lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins rather than their efficient clearance. [@problem_id:2332318]", "problem": "In the context of cellular quality control, the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) is critical for maintaining protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. This system identifies and targets misfolded or damaged proteins for degradation. The process begins when a protein is tagged with a chain of small proteins called ubiquitin. This ubiquitin tag serves as a signal for the proteasome, a large protein complex, to recognize and degrade the tagged protein.\n\nThis degradation pathway is balanced by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which can remove ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby rescuing them from proteasomal degradation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical, aggregation-prone protein called \"Aggregon-alpha\" that is linked to a specific type of cellular dysfunction. When Aggregon-alpha misfolds, it is normally ubiquitinated and efficiently degraded by the UPS. A specific enzyme, DUB-A, can reverse this process by removing ubiquitin specifically from misfolded Aggregon-alpha.\n\nIf a cell acquires a mutation that results in a hyperactive form of DUB-A, meaning its enzymatic activity is significantly and constitutively increased, which of the following outcomes is the most probable consequence for the cell?\n\nA. A net increase in the concentration of misfolded Aggregon-alpha, likely leading to the formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates.\n\nB. An overall depletion of the cell's free ubiquitin pool, leading to a general failure in the degradation of all other misfolded proteins.\n\nC. A rapid and efficient clearance of all forms of Aggregon-alpha, both folded and misfolded, from the cell.\n\nD. A compensatory upregulation in the synthesis of new Aggregon-alpha protein to counteract its perceived loss.\n\nE. Accelerated degradation of DUB-A itself, as the cell's feedback mechanisms attempt to restore normal proteostasis.", "solution": "We apply the core principles of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). Misfolded proteins are polyubiquitinated by E1-E2-E3 enzymes and recognized by the 26S proteasome for degradation. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin chains, rescuing substrates from degradation and recycling ubiquitin.\n\nLet M denote the concentration of misfolded Aggregon-alpha and M_{u} the ubiquitinated fraction. The key transitions are:\n- Ubiquitination: $M \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{tag}}} M_{u}$.\n- Deubiquitination: $M_{u} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{deub}}} M$.\n- Proteasomal degradation: $M_{u} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{deg}}} \\varnothing$.\n\nAt quasi-steady state for $M_{u}$, assuming constant misfolded input and focusing on the balance of tagging and removal,\n$$\n0 \\approx k_{\\text{tag}} M - \\left(k_{\\text{deub}} + k_{\\text{deg}}\\right) M_{u}\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\nM_{u} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{tag}}}{k_{\\text{deub}} + k_{\\text{deg}}} M.\n$$\nThe degradation flux is $J_{\\text{deg}} = k_{\\text{deg}} M_{u} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{deg}} k_{\\text{tag}}}{k_{\\text{deub}} + k_{\\text{deg}}} M$. A hyperactive DUB-A increases $k_{\\text{deub}}$ specifically for misfolded Aggregon-alpha, which decreases $M_{u}$ and thus decreases $J_{\\text{deg}}$ for a given $M$. Reduced degradation flux causes an increase in the steady-state $M$ (misfolded Aggregon-alpha), especially given its aggregation-prone nature, leading to a higher likelihood of cytotoxic aggregate formation.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A: Predicts accumulation of misfolded Aggregon-alpha and aggregate formation. This directly follows from the increased $k_{\\text{deub}}$ decreasing the ubiquitinated fraction and degradation, thereby increasing $M$. This is the most probable direct consequence.\n- B: Depletion of free ubiquitin is unlikely; hyperactive deubiquitination liberates ubiquitin, tending to increase rather than deplete the free ubiquitin pool.\n- C: Clearance would be impaired, not enhanced, because DUB activity antagonizes proteasomal targeting; furthermore, DUB-A is specific to misfolded Aggregon-alpha, not all forms.\n- D: A compensatory upregulation of Aggregon-alpha synthesis is not a direct, necessary outcome of DUB hyperactivity; the immediate effect is increased misfolded protein, not perceived loss.\n- E: While feedback regulation of DUB-A could exist in some systems, accelerated degradation of DUB-A is speculative and not the most immediate, direct, or necessary consequence compared to the robust prediction in A.\n\nTherefore, the most probable consequence is described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332318"}, {"introduction": "Beyond degradation, cells deploy sophisticated chaperone machinery to refold proteins and even dismantle aggregates.
