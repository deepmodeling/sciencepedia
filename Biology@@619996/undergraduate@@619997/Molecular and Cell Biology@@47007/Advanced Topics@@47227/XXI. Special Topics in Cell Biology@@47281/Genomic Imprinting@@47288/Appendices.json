This exercise utilizes a classic genetic tool, the reciprocal cross, to highlight how the parent of origin dictates gene expression and, in this case, viability. By analyzing two opposing crosses, you will practice applying the core principle of imprinting: that an allele's effect depends entirely on which parent it was inherited from [@problem_id:1935197].", "problem": "In a species of bioluminescent fungus, a gene called *Luminase* is essential for embryonic development. There are two alleles for this gene: a functional wild-type allele, $L$, and a non-functional, recessive lethal allele, $l$. This gene is subject to genomic imprinting. Specifically, the paternal copy of the *Luminase* gene is always methylated and silenced, meaning only the allele inherited from the maternal parent is expressed in the offspring. Therefore, the allele $l$ is lethal only when inherited from the mother. Heterozygous individuals ($Ll$) are phenotypically normal and fully viable.\n\nConsider two reciprocal crosses:\n\n**Cross 1:** A heterozygous ($Ll$) female is crossed with a wild-type homozygous ($LL$) male.\n**Cross 2:** A wild-type homozygous ($LL$) female is crossed with a heterozygous ($Ll$) male.\n\nWhat are the expected proportions of viable offspring produced from Cross 1 and Cross 2, respectively?\n\nA. 1/2 and 1\n\nB. 1 and 1/2\n\nC. 1/2 and 1/2\n\nD. 3/4 and 1\n\nE. 1 and 3/4\n\nF. 3/4 and 3/4", "solution": "Genomic imprinting here silences the paternal allele; thus only the maternal allele is expressed. Let $L$ denote the functional allele and $l$ the non-functional, recessive lethal allele. Because only the maternal allele is expressed, an offspring is viable if and only if the maternal allele is $L$, and it is lethal if the maternal allele is $l$, regardless of the paternal genotype.\n\nCross 1: Female $Ll$ and male $LL$. The female produces eggs carrying $L$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $l$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The male produces sperm carrying $L$ only. Offspring from maternal $L$ receive an expressed $L$ and are viable; offspring from maternal $l$ receive an expressed $l$ and are non-viable. Therefore, the proportion of viable offspring is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCross 2: Female $LL$ and male $Ll$. The female produces eggs carrying $L$ only. Thus, every offspring has maternal allele $L$ expressed, regardless of the paternal allele, and is viable. Therefore, the proportion of viable offspring is $1$.\n\nThese correspond to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1935197"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond inheritance ratios, it is crucial to connect an imprinted genotype to its resulting phenotype. This practice explores how the parent-specific expression of a single gene can directly influence an organism's physical traits, such as size. By working through this scenario, you will develop the skill of predicting phenotypic outcomes when only one parental allele is functionally active, reinforcing the link between epigenetic regulation and observable characteristics [@problem_id:2317423].", "problem": "In mammals, some genes are subject to genomic imprinting, a phenomenon where the expression of a gene depends on whether it was inherited from the mother or the father. Consider a fictional growth-regulating gene, `Stature-1` (`St1`), that positively promotes organismal size during development. The `St1` gene is known to be exclusively paternally expressed, meaning that the allele inherited from the mother is epigenetically silenced and only the allele inherited from the father is transcribed.\n\nA male mouse is heterozygous for the `St1` gene, possessing one functional wild-type allele (`St1^+`) and one null allele (`St1^-`) which produces a non-functional protein. This male is crossed with a wild-type female mouse, who is homozygous for the functional allele (`St1^+`/`St1^+`).\n\nAssuming Mendelian segregation of alleles from the father, what is the expected phenotype of an offspring that inherits the null `St1^-` allele from its father?\n\nA. The offspring will have a normal phenotype, indistinguishable from a wild-type mouse.\n\nB. The offspring will exhibit a lethal phenotype, failing to develop to term.\n\nC. The offspring will exhibit an overgrowth phenotype, being significantly larger than a wild-type mouse.\n\nD. The offspring will exhibit a reduced-growth phenotype, being significantly smaller than a wild-type mouse.\n\nE. The phenotype cannot be determined, as the maternal allele may randomly become active to compensate.", "solution": "Key genetic facts:\n- Genomic imprinting with paternal-specific expression means only the paternally inherited allele of $St1$ is transcriptionally active; the maternally inherited allele is epigenetically silenced and contributes no functional product.\n- The gene $St1$ positively regulates growth; therefore, the level of functional $St1$ product is positively correlated with organismal size.\n\nParental genotypes:\n- Father: heterozygous $St1^{+}/St1^{-}$, producing gametes with $St1^{+}$ and $St1^{-}$ in equal proportions by Mendelian segregation.\n- Mother: homozygous $St1^{+}/St1^{+}$, producing only $St1^{+}$ gametes.\n\nFocus on the specified offspring that inherits the null $St1^{-}$ allele from the father. The zygotic genotype is then paternal $St1^{-}$ and maternal $St1^{+}$.\n\nBecause only the paternal allele is expressed, define the functional $St1$ product amount $A$ in the offspring as\n$$\nA=\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if the paternal allele is } St1^{+},\\\\\n0, & \\text{if the paternal allele is } St1^{-}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor the specified offspring, the paternal allele is $St1^{-}$, so $A=0$. The maternal $St1^{+}$ does not contribute because it is silenced by imprinting.\n\nSince $St1$ positively promotes growth, the phenotype is determined by the amount of functional product. Let $G$ denote growth and $G_{\\text{wt}}$ the wild-type growth level. With $A=0$ (loss of the active growth-promoting allele), the expected phenotype is reduced growth relative to $G_{\\text{wt}}$, not overgrowth or normal size and not necessarily lethality given only loss of a growth-promoting signal. Random reactivation of the maternal allele is not part of normal imprinting and is not expected.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is reduced-growth phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2317423"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges theoretical knowledge with real-world a pplication, introducing the quantitative methods used in modern genomics to identify novel imprinted genes. You will step into the role of a researcher, integrating data from two powerful techniques: RNA-sequencing (to measure gene expression) and bisulfite sequencing (to measure DNA methylation).

They have performed a genome-wide screen combining RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and haplotype-resolved Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) on placental tissue from F1 hybrid mice derived from a cross between two inbred strains (Strain A female x Strain B male). Their goal is to identify novel imprinted genes by looking for two key signatures: parent-of-origin-specific gene expression and parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation.\n\nThey are currently analyzing a candidate gene, which they have named `Transcribed Placental Locus 7` (`Tpl7`). Within an exon of `Tpl7`, there exists a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) that differs between the parental strains, allowing for allele-specific expression analysis. At the promoter of `Tpl7`, there is a CpG island, a region rich in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides.\n\nThe analysis pipeline defines an \"Imprinting Score\" (IS) for any given gene, calculated as the product of two other metrics: the Allelic Expression Imbalance (AEI) and the Differential Methylation Index (DMI).\n- The AEI is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the fraction of RNA-seq reads originating from the maternal allele and the fraction originating from the paternal allele. The fractions are calculated relative to the total number of reads mapping to the SNP.\n- The DMI is defined as the absolute difference between the average methylation level (expressed as a decimal) of the CpG island on the maternal allele and that on the paternal allele.\n\nFrom their sequencing data for the `Tpl7` gene in the F1 hybrid placenta, the researchers obtained the following results:\n- **RNA-seq at the exonic SNP:** A total of 8,240 reads mapped to this locus. Of these, 7,828 reads corresponded to the maternal allele (Strain A) and the remaining reads corresponded to the paternal allele (Strain B).\n- **WGBS at the promoter CpG island:** The average methylation level of the maternal allele was 0.915 (or 91.5%). The average methylation level of the paternal allele was 0.065 (or 6.5%).\n\nBased on this data, calculate the Imprinting Score (IS) for the `Tpl7` gene.
