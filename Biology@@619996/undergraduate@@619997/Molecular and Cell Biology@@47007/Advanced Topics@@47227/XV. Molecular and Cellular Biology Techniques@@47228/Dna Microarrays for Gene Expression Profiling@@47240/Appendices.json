The student's goal is to identify which genes are differentially expressed in the cancerous state. The experimental plan involves using a DNA microarray, which is a glass slide spotted with thousands of single-stranded DNA fragments, known as probes. Each spot on the microarray corresponds to a unique probe for a specific gene.\n\nThe standard procedure involves the following steps:\n1.  Isolate messenger RNA (mRNA) from both the healthy and cancerous cell populations. Mature mRNA in eukaryotes consists only of sequences derived from exons, as intronic sequences are removed during RNA splicing.\n2.  Use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from the mRNA templates. The cDNA from healthy cells is labeled with a green fluorescent dye, and the cDNA from cancerous cells is labeled with a red fluorescent dye.\n3.  Combine the two labeled cDNA samples and apply them to the surface of the DNA microarray. The cDNA molecules will hybridize (bind) to their complementary probe sequences on the slide.\n4.  After washing away any unbound cDNA, a scanner measures the intensity of the green and red fluorescence at each spot, indicating the relative abundance of mRNA for the corresponding gene in each cell type.\n\nHowever, a critical error was made during the design of the microarray. The single-stranded DNA probes that were synthesized and spotted onto the array were designed to be complementary to the **intronic** sequences of the genes of interest, not the exonic sequences. Assuming the rest of the procedure is performed correctly, what is the most likely outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The experiment will proceed as expected, but the overall fluorescence signals will be weaker than normal.\n\nB. The experiment will produce valid results, but the expression patterns will be inverted (i.e., upregulated genes will appear downregulated and vice-versa).\n\nC. The microarray will show little to no fluorescence signal at any of the spots, rendering the experiment inconclusive.\n\nD. Both red and green fluorescence will be detected at high levels on all spots, indicating that all genes are highly expressed in both cell types.\n\nE. Only the genes that are not expressed in either cell type will show a signal, while expressed genes will show no signal.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of a DNA microarray experiment where the probes are designed to be complementary to intronic sequences instead of exonic ones. To solve this, we must trace the molecular biology of gene expression and the technical steps of the microarray procedure.\n\n1.  **Gene Expression and RNA Splicing:** In eukaryotic cells, genes are composed of exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding intervening regions). The first step of gene expression is transcription, where the entire gene, including both exons and introns, is transcribed into a molecule called pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). Before this molecule can be translated into a protein, it must undergo a process called RNA splicing. During splicing, the introns are precisely cut out and degraded, and the exons are joined together to form a mature mRNA molecule.\n\n2.  **Source Material for Microarray Analysis:** The starting material for a gene expression microarray is the pool of mature mRNA isolated from the cell. This is because the abundance of mature mRNA directly reflects the level of active gene expression at that moment. The introns, which have been removed and degraded, are not present in this pool.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of Complementary DNA (cDNA):** The next step in the protocol is to use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to create a library of complementary DNA (cDNA) from the mature mRNA templates. Because the templates are the mature mRNA molecules (which consist only of exonic sequences), the resulting cDNA molecules will also only contain sequences complementary to the exons. The cDNA library will not contain any sequences complementary to the introns.\n\n4.  **Hybridization Step:** The fluorescently labeled cDNA is then applied to the microarray chip. The principle of a microarray relies on the specific hybridization (base pairing) between the labeled cDNA molecules in the sample and the stationary single-stranded DNA probes on the chip. A strong signal is produced only when a cDNA molecule finds and binds to its exact complementary probe sequence.\n\n5.  **The Flaw in the Experiment:** In this specific scenario, the probes on the microarray chip are designed to be complementary to *intronic* sequences. However, as established in step 3, the fluorescently labeled cDNA molecules being tested are complementary to *exonic* sequences.\n\n6.  **Predicted Outcome:** Since the cDNA molecules do not contain sequences complementary to the intronic probes on the chip, there will be no specific hybridization. The labeled cDNA will fail to bind to the probes. When the microarray is washed to remove unbound molecules, virtually all the fluorescently labeled cDNA will be washed away. Consequently, when the chip is scanned, there will be little to no fluorescence detectable at any of the spots. The experiment will fail to produce any meaningful data about gene expression levels because the target molecules (cDNA from mature mRNA) and the probes are not complementary.\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A. Incorrect. The signals will not just be weaker; they will be absent because there is no basis for hybridization.\n    *   B. Incorrect. There is no biological or technical mechanism in this scenario that would cause an inversion of the results. This is a nonsensical outcome.\n    *   C. Correct. The lack of complementarity between the exonic-derived cDNA and the intronic probes will lead to a failure of hybridization, resulting in a blank or near-blank microarray with no significant signal.\n    *   D. Incorrect. This would imply massive, non-specific binding, which a proper washing step is designed to prevent. Furthermore, there's no reason for hybridization to occur at all, let alone everywhere.\n    *   E. Incorrect. Non-expressed genes produce no mRNA, hence no cDNA, so they would show no signal. However, expressed genes would also show no signal due to the probe-cDNA mismatch. Therefore, the entire array would be blank, not just the spots for expressed genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2312701"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression analysis is not just about calculation; it's about logical deduction.
