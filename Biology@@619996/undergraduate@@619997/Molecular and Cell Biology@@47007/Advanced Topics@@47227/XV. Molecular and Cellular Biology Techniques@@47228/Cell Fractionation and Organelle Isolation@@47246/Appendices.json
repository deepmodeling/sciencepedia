{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The success of any cell fractionation protocol hinges on its very first step: effectively breaking open the cells while preserving the integrity of the organelles you wish to study. This practice problem presents a classic troubleshooting scenario where the expected outcome—a pellet of isolated nuclei—is not achieved. By analyzing the results and the procedure, you'll learn to critically evaluate the homogenization step, a fundamental skill for any cell biologist [@problem_id:2307679].", "problem": "A cell biologist is working to isolate functional nuclei from a culture of human hepatocytes (liver cells) for use in a transcription run-on assay. The standard protocol begins with harvesting the cells and resuspending them in a chilled, isotonic buffer containing a mild non-ionic detergent. The cell suspension is then subjected to mechanical homogenization using a Dounce homogenizer to break the plasma membranes while leaving the nuclear envelopes intact. The resulting homogenate is then centrifuged at 800 x g for 15 minutes to pellet the nuclei. Upon examining a sample of the resulting pellet under a light microscope, the biologist is surprised to find that it consists predominantly of intact, spherical hepatocytes, with very few free nuclei visible. Which of the following is the most probable cause of this poor outcome and the most appropriate corrective action?\n\nA. The centrifugation speed of 800 x g was too low to effectively pellet the dense nuclei, which remained in the supernatant. The speed should be increased significantly.\n\nB. The buffer was hypertonic, causing the cells to shrink and become so dense that they pelleted alongside the nuclei. The buffer's solute concentration should be decreased.\n\nC. The homogenization procedure was too gentle or too brief, failing to rupture the plasma membranes of most cells. The number of strokes or the force used during homogenization should be increased.\n\nD. The non-ionic detergent was too harsh, causing the nuclear envelope to lyse and release the chromatin, which was then lost in the supernatant. A milder detergent or no detergent should be used.\n\nE. The centrifugation time of 15 minutes was excessively long, leading to the co-sedimentation of smaller organelles like mitochondria with the nuclei. The spin time should be shortened.", "solution": "The goal of this procedure is to perform differential centrifugation to separate cellular components based on their size and density. The first step in fractionating animal cells is typically a low-speed centrifugation step designed to pellet the largest and densest organelle: the nucleus.\n\nLet's analyze the observed result. The researcher found that the pellet, which should have been enriched with nuclei, was instead mostly composed of intact hepatocytes. Intact cells are much larger and more massive than any individual organelle, including the nucleus. Therefore, during a centrifugation step, if intact cells are present in the suspension, they will sediment and form a pellet at even very low centrifugal forces.\n\nThe protocol involves two key stages before centrifugation:\n1.  Suspending cells in a specific buffer.\n2.  Mechanically homogenizing the cells to lyse them (break their plasma membranes).\n\nThe problem states that the pellet is full of intact cells. This indicates that the cells were never successfully lysed in the first place. If the cells are not broken open, their contents, including the nucleus, are not released into the suspension to be fractionated. The homogenization step is the one responsible for physically breaking the cell membranes. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the homogenization step was ineffective.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. This is incorrect. A centrifugation speed of 600-1000 x g is standard for pelleting nuclei. Furthermore, if the speed were too low, the result would be a very small pellet (or no pellet) and a cloudy supernatant containing the un-pelleted nuclei. This contradicts the observation of a pellet composed of intact cells. Intact cells are larger and heavier than free nuclei, so they would pellet even more readily at this speed.\n\nB. This is incorrect. A hypertonic buffer would cause cells to lose water and shrink (crenate). While this changes their density, it does not explain the failure to lyse. The primary issue is the integrity of the plasma membrane, not the cell's hydration state. The homogenization step is still required to break the cells, regardless of the buffer's tonicity.\n\nC. This is the correct explanation. Mechanical homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer relies on shear forces to break the plasma membrane. If the procedure is too gentle (e.g., the pestle is too loose-fitting, or not enough passes or \"strokes\" are performed), the shear forces will be insufficient to rupture the resilient plasma membrane of many cells. These unlysed cells remain in the homogenate and, being the largest particles present, are easily pelleted at 800 x g. The appropriate corrective action is to apply a more rigorous homogenization to ensure a high percentage of cell lysis.\n\nD. This is incorrect. If the detergent were too harsh and lysed the nuclei, the researcher would observe a very small or non-existent nuclear pellet. The nuclear contents (chromatin) would be released into the suspension and would not pellet at such a low speed. This is the opposite of the described problem, which is a pellet of large, intact cells.\n\nE. This is incorrect. A long centrifugation time ensures that all particles that *can* sediment at a given speed will do so, leading to a more complete separation. While excessively long spins at higher speeds can cause contamination with smaller components, the primary contaminant here is intact cells, not smaller organelles. Shortening the spin time would likely result in an even less efficient procedure, where some nuclei and intact cells might remain in the supernatant, but it would not solve the fundamental problem of failed cell lysis. The presence of intact cells in the pellet is the core issue, not contamination by smaller organelles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307679"}, {"introduction": "Once a cell homogenate is successfully prepared, the powerful technique of differential centrifugation allows us to separate subcellular components based on their size and density. This exercise explores the separation of free ribosomes from those bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (rough microsomes), a common task in studying protein synthesis. By considering their physical differences, you will apply the principles of sedimentation to predict how varying centrifugal forces can precisely sort these crucial cellular machines [@problem_id:2307681].", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and wishes to isolate two distinct populations of ribosomes: those that are free in the cytosol and those that are bound to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The procedure begins with the gentle homogenization of cultured cells to break the plasma membrane while leaving most organelles intact. This homogenate is then subjected to a series of differential centrifugation steps.\n\nThe protocol proceeds as follows:\n1.  The initial homogenate is centrifuged at a low speed (1,000 x g) to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, yielding Supernatant S1.\n2.  Supernatant S1 is then centrifuged at a medium speed (20,000 x g) to pellet mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, yielding Supernatant S2.\n3.  Supernatant S2, now enriched with smaller components, is subjected to a high-speed centrifugation at 100,000 x g. This step produces Pellet P3 and Supernatant S3.\n4.  Finally, Supernatant S3 is centrifuged at a very high speed (e.g., 300,000 x g), producing Pellet P4.\n\nDuring homogenization, the ER fragments and reseals into small vesicles called microsomes. The ribosomes remain attached to the outer surface of these vesicles, forming \"rough microsomes.\"\n\nBased on the principles of sedimentation, which of the following statements correctly identifies the locations of the rough microsomes and the free cytosolic ribosomes and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. Rough microsomes are in Pellet P3 and free ribosomes are in Pellet P4. This is because rough microsomes are significantly larger and more massive than individual free ribosomes, causing them to sediment at a lower centrifugal force.\n\nB. Free ribosomes are in Pellet P3 and rough microsomes are in Pellet P4. This is because free ribosomes are denser than the lipid-rich microsomes, allowing them to pellet more quickly.\n\nC. Both rough microsomes and free ribosomes are found together in Pellet P3. This is because all ribosomes have the same sedimentation coefficient, regardless of their association with the ER.\n\nD. Both rough microsomes and free ribosomes are found together in Pellet P4. This is because both are among the smallest components of the cell and require the highest centrifugal forces to be isolated from the soluble part of the cytoplasm.\n\nE. Rough microsomes are in Pellet P4 and free ribosomes are in Pellet P3. This is because the attached ribosomes make the microsomes less hydrodynamic, causing them to sediment more slowly than the compact free ribosomes.", "solution": "The separation relies on differential centrifugation, where the sedimentation velocity $v$ of a particle at angular speed $\\omega$ and radius $r$ from the axis is given by $v = s \\omega^{2} r$, with the Svedberg coefficient\n$$\ns = \\frac{m \\left(1 - \\rho \\bar{v}\\right)}{f}.\n$$\nHere, $m$ is the particle mass, $\\rho$ is the solvent density, $\\bar{v}$ is the particle’s partial specific volume, and $f$ is the frictional coefficient. For approximately spherical particles in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$, $f \\approx 6 \\pi \\eta R$, where $R$ is an effective hydrodynamic radius. If two particle types have similar buoyancy term $1 - \\rho \\bar{v}$, then $s$ scales as $s \\sim \\frac{R^{3}}{R} \\sim R^{2}$, because $m$ scales with volume ($\\sim R^{3}$) while $f$ scales with $R$. Thus, larger particles have much larger $s$ and sediment at lower $\\omega$ (or shorter times).\n\nAfter gentle homogenization, the ER reseals into vesicles (microsomes). Rough microsomes (ER-derived vesicles with ribosomes bound) are vesicular particles with a much larger effective radius and mass than individual free cytosolic ribosomes. Therefore, their $s$ is substantially larger, and they pellet at a lower centrifugal force relative to free ribosomes.\n\nApplying this to the protocol:\n- After removal of large organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes) in earlier spins, Supernatant S2 contains microsomes and ribosomes.\n- At $100{,}000 \\times g$, particles with larger $s$ (rough microsomes) sediment to form Pellet P3, while smaller particles with smaller $s$ (free ribosomes) remain in Supernatant S3.\n- At $300{,}000 \\times g$, the remaining small but dense macromolecular complexes (free ribosomes) now sediment to form Pellet P4.\n\nTherefore, rough microsomes are in Pellet P3 and free cytosolic ribosomes are in Pellet P4. The correct physical reasoning is that rough microsomes are significantly larger and more massive than individual ribosomes, giving them a larger Svedberg coefficient and causing them to pellet at lower centrifugal force, consistent with $s \\propto R^{2}$ for similarly shaped and buoyant particles. This matches option A and rules out the alternatives:\n- B incorrectly emphasizes density over the dominant size dependence in differential centrifugation.\n- C is incorrect because association with ER changes size and friction, thus the sedimentation coefficient differs.\n- D is incorrect because rough microsomes are not among the smallest components.\n- E is incorrect; attached ribosomes increase effective size and mass, increasing $s$, not decreasing it, so they do not sediment more slowly than free ribosomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2307681"}, {"introduction": "Isolating a specific cellular component is only part of the challenge; quantifying the success of your purification is equally important.
