This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2348269] challenges you to interpret a classic positive result, where the interaction between a \"bait\" and \"prey\" protein successfully reconstitutes a transcription factor. Mastering this core logic is the first step toward understanding how a measurable cellular phenotype, like growth on selective media, can reveal molecular events happening inside the cell.", "problem": "A molecular biology researcher is investigating a potential interaction between a newly discovered human protein, Protein P, and a known signaling protein, Protein S, using a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) system. The system employs a specially engineered yeast strain that cannot synthesize the amino acids tryptophan (Trp) and leucine (Leu), nor the pyrimidine uracil (Ura). This strain's genome contains a *URA3* reporter gene, which encodes an enzyme essential for uracil biosynthesis. The expression of *URA3* is driven by a promoter that is only active when bound by the complete GAL4 transcription factor.\n\nThe researcher constructs two plasmids:\n1.  **Bait Plasmid**: This plasmid encodes a fusion protein where Protein P is attached to the DNA-Binding Domain (BD) of the GAL4 transcription factor. The plasmid also contains the *TRP1* gene, which allows transformed yeast to synthesize their own tryptophan.\n2.  **Prey Plasmid**: This plasmid encodes a fusion protein where Protein S is attached to the Activation Domain (AD) of the GAL4 transcription factor. This plasmid contains the *LEU2* gene, allowing transformed yeast to synthesize their own leucine.\n\nThe researcher co-transforms the yeast strain with both the bait and prey plasmids. The cells are then plated on a synthetic defined (SD) medium lacking Trp, Leu, and Ura. After incubation, the researcher observes significant colony growth. As a control, transformations with the bait plasmid plus an empty prey plasmid, and the prey plasmid plus an empty bait plasmid, yield no growth on this selective medium.\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, what is the most direct and likely conclusion?\n\nA. The *URA3* gene product has mutated in a way that allows it to function without being expressed.\n\nB. Protein P and Protein S physically interact, bringing the GAL4 BD and AD into close enough proximity to reconstitute a functional transcription factor that activates the *URA3* gene.\n\nC. The yeast cells have spontaneously reverted their auxotrophy for uracil, allowing them to grow on the selective medium independently of the reporter gene.\n\nD. The fusion of Protein P to the GAL4 BD creates a protein that can, by itself, bind to the promoter and activate transcription of the *URA3* gene.\n\nE. The yeast's native transcription machinery is able to recognize and activate the *URA3* promoter in the presence of the human proteins.", "solution": "Define the conditions necessary for yeast growth on SD medium lacking Trp, Leu, and Ura. Let $T$ denote complementation of tryptophan auxotrophy via the plasmid marker *TRP1*, $L$ denote complementation of leucine auxotrophy via the plasmid marker *LEU2*, and $U$ denote functional expression of the reporter gene *URA3*. Growth on the selective medium requires that all three conditions be met simultaneously, i.e.,\n$$\nG = T \\land L \\land U.\n$$\nBy construction:\n- The bait plasmid provides *TRP1*, hence contributes $T=\\text{true}$ when present.\n- The prey plasmid provides *LEU2*, hence contributes $L=\\text{true}$ when present.\n- The genome-encoded *URA3* is under a promoter that is only activated by a fully reconstituted GAL4 transcription factor. In a yeast two-hybrid configuration, this occurs only when the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) fused to Protein P and the GAL4 activation domain (AD) fused to Protein S are brought into proximity by a physical interaction between Protein P and Protein S. Thus, in this system,\n$$\nU=\\text{true} \\iff \\text{BD-P interacts with AD-S (i.e., P binds S)}.\n$$\n\nAnalyze the experimental conditions:\n- In co-transformants with both bait (BD-P, *TRP1*) and prey (AD-S, *LEU2*), we have $T=\\text{true}$ and $L=\\text{true}$. Observed growth on $-$Trp $-$Leu $-$Ura implies $G=\\text{true}$, hence $U=\\text{true}$. From the definition of $U$ above, this directly implies that BD-P and AD-S are brought together by a physical interaction between Protein P and Protein S, reconstituting GAL4 function to activate *URA3*.\n- In controls with bait plus empty prey, $T=\\text{true}$ and $L=\\text{false}$; therefore $G=\\text{false}$ regardless of $U$, explaining no growth. In controls with prey plus empty bait, $T=\\text{false}$ and $L=\\text{true}$; therefore $G=\\text{false}$ regardless of $U$, again explaining no growth. Importantly, the key inference from the experimental condition is that, when both $T$ and $L$ are satisfied, growth occurs, which necessarily requires $U=\\text{true}$ and thus reconstitution of GAL4 via interaction between Protein P and Protein S.\n\nEvaluate alternative explanations:\n- Option A proposes a mutation enabling *URA3* function without expression; this is inconsistent with the requirement for transcriptional activation by GAL4 in this reporter design and fails to explain the selective dependence on having both plasmids.\n- Option C suggests spontaneous reversion of uracil auxotrophy; this would not specifically require both bait and prey plasmids and is highly unlikely relative to the designed reporter-dependent activation. Moreover, even if uracil auxotrophy reverted, growth would still require both *TRP1* and *LEU2*, and the decisive observation is that co-transformants grow because $U$ is functionally met via reporter activation, not via rare reversion.\n- Option D suggests BD-P alone autoactivates; if that were the case, $U$ could be true with bait alone, but growth on $-$Trp $-$Leu $-$Ura would still fail without *LEU2*, as observed in the control. However, the experimental co-transformant growth specifically demonstrates that when both plasmids are present, $U$ is satisfied, which in a Y2H design is the canonical signature of protein-protein interaction. The absence of growth in the bait-alone control does not contradict this conclusion and there is no evidence for autoactivation.\n- Option E claims native transcription activates the *URA3* promoter in the presence of human proteins; this conflicts with the reporter design requiring GAL4 BD and AD reconstitution and is not supported by the observed dependence on both fusion constructs.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely conclusion consistent with the Y2H logic is that Protein P and Protein S physically interact to reconstitute GAL4 activity and activate *URA3*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2348269"}, {"introduction": "A successful experiment is built upon rigorous controls that rule out alternative explanations for an observed result. In the Y2H system, a primary concern is \"auto-activation,\" where the bait protein itself activates the reporter gene without any interacting prey.

The Y2H system utilizes the modular nature of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor, which has a DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) and an Activation Domain (AD) that are functional even when physically separated.\n\nIn this system, the gene for Protein X (the \"bait\") is fused to the gene for the Gal4 DBD, creating a `DBD-Bait` fusion protein. This construct is encoded on a plasmid containing the *TRP1* nutritional marker. A library of potential interacting proteins (the \"prey\") is fused to the Gal4 AD, creating `AD-Prey` fusion proteins, encoded on a separate plasmid with a *LEU2* nutritional marker. When a bait and prey protein interact, the DBD and AD are brought together, reconstituting a functional transcription factor that activates a *HIS3* reporter gene. This allows the yeast to synthesize its own histidine and grow on a selective medium lacking histidine.\n\nAs a preliminary step before screening the prey library, the researcher transforms a yeast strain that is auxotrophic for tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (trp1⁻, leu2⁻, his3⁻) with only the bait plasmid (encoding `DBD-Protein X`). The transformed yeast cells are then plated onto a synthetic defined (SD) medium that lacks both tryptophan and histidine (SD/-Trp/-His). Which of the following is the most likely reason for performing this specific experiment?\n\nA. To determine if the bait protein is toxic to the yeast cells.\n\nB. To confirm that the yeast transformation procedure was successful.\n\nC. To test whether the bait protein can independently activate the transcription of the reporter gene.\n\nD. To ensure the prey protein does not bind to endogenous yeast transcription factors.\n\nE. To measure the basal transcription level of the reporter gene in the absence of any fusion proteins.", "solution": "The yeast two-hybrid system relies on the modularity of the Gal4 transcription factor, where transcriptional activation of the reporter gene requires both the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the activation domain (AD) to be brought together by a specific bait-prey protein interaction. In the setup described, the bait is fused to the Gal4 DBD and carried on a plasmid with the *TRP1* marker, while the prey library is fused to the Gal4 AD and carried on a separate plasmid with the *LEU2* marker. The reporter is *HIS3*, which, when expressed, enables growth in the absence of histidine.\n\nThe yeast strain is auxotrophic for tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (trp1⁻, leu2⁻, his3⁻), meaning:\n- Growth on medium lacking tryptophan requires the *TRP1* marker to complement trp1⁻.\n- Growth on medium lacking histidine requires activation of *HIS3*, which occurs only if a functional Gal4 transcription factor is reconstituted or if there is autoactivation.\n\nOnly the bait plasmid (DBD-Protein X with *TRP1*) is introduced in this preliminary test. Plating on SD/-Trp/-His imposes two simultaneous requirements for growth:\n- The presence of the bait plasmid (*TRP1*) to overcome tryptophan auxotrophy.\n- Activation of the *HIS3* reporter to overcome histidine auxotrophy.\n\nSince no AD-Prey fusion is present, a functional Gal4 transcription factor cannot be reconstituted through a bait-prey interaction. Therefore, growth on SD/-Trp/-His under these conditions can only occur if the DBD-Protein X fusion itself activates *HIS3* expression in the absence of any AD-Prey—i.e., if the bait is an autoactivator (it either contains an intrinsic activation function or recruits the transcriptional machinery when tethered to DNA via the DBD).\n\nThis design does not primarily test transformation efficiency (which would be assessed on SD/-Trp alone), nor bait toxicity (also best assessed on SD/-Trp to avoid confounding with histidine selection), nor interactions with endogenous yeast transcription factors in the prey, nor basal reporter activity in the complete absence of fusion proteins. Instead, it specifically tests whether the bait alone can drive reporter expression, which would confound the subsequent library screen.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for this experiment is to test whether the bait protein can independently activate the transcription of the reporter gene (autoactivation).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348304"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply mapping interaction networks, the elegant logic of the Y2H system can be cleverly adapted for new purposes, such as drug discovery.

Select for colonies that grow.", "solution": "We begin from the yeast two-hybrid principle: fusing Protein 1 (P1) to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and Protein 2 (P2) to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) reconstitutes a functional Gal4 transcription factor only if P1 and P2 physically interact. When the interaction occurs, Gal4 activates transcription from a Gal4-responsive promoter, denoted as UAS\\_{GAL}, driving expression of a downstream reporter gene. Therefore,\n$$\n\\text{P1-P2 interaction} \\Rightarrow \\text{Gal4 reconstitution} \\Rightarrow \\text{UAS\\_{GAL} activation} \\Rightarrow \\text{reporter expression}.\n$$\n\nTwo reporter systems are available:\n- *HIS3*: expression permits growth on media lacking histidine. In a `his3Δ` strain, growth on media lacking histidine indicates reporter expression.\n- *URA3*: expression permits growth on media lacking uracil, but also converts 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) into a toxic product. Therefore, in the presence of 5-FOA, *URA3* expression causes cell death, while lack of *URA3* expression permits survival, provided uracil is supplied exogenously so that cells do not require *URA3* for growth.\n\nThe screening goal is to identify small molecules that disrupt the P1-P2 interaction. Thus, we require a selection in which disruption of the interaction yields survival or growth. Using the *URA3*/5-FOA counter-selection achieves a positive selection for disruptors:\n- Without inhibitor: P1-P2 interact, *URA3* is expressed, and in the presence of 5-FOA the cells die.\n- With inhibitor: P1-P2 interaction is blocked, *URA3* is not expressed, and in the presence of 5-FOA the cells survive. Because the strain is `ura3Δ` and `his3Δ`, exogenous uracil and histidine must be present to permit growth independent of reporter activity.\n\nNow evaluate each option against this logic:\n\nA. P1-DBD, P2-AD, *HIS3* reporter; plate on media lacking histidine and select growth. On media lacking histidine, growth requires *HIS3* expression, which occurs when P1 and P2 interact. Therefore, compounds that disrupt the interaction would prevent growth. Selecting for colonies that grow enriches for compounds that do not disrupt the interaction. This does not meet the goal.\n\nB. P1-DBD, P2-AD, *URA3* reporter; plate on media lacking uracil and select growth. On media lacking uracil, growth requires *URA3* expression, which occurs when P1 and P2 interact. Again, growth reports interaction, not disruption. This does not meet the goal.\n\nC. P1-DBD, P2-AD, *URA3* reporter; plate on media containing 5-FOA and the library; select for molecules that cause a lack of growth. In the presence of 5-FOA, *URA3* expression causes death; lack of *URA3* expression allows survival if uracil is supplied. Disruption of the P1-P2 interaction should therefore produce survival, not lack of growth. Moreover, the strain is `ura3Δ`; without exogenous uracil, even disruptors cannot grow. This selection criterion and media composition are inappropriate.\n\nD. P1-DBD, P2-AD, *HIS3* reporter; plate on media lacking histidine with 3-AT and the library; select for colonies that fail to grow. 3-AT raises stringency for *HIS3*. However, using *HIS3* to find inhibitors requires negative selection (absence of growth), which is prone to high false negatives and nonspecific toxicity. This is inferior to a positive selection for survival.\n\nE. P1-DBD, P2-AD, *URA3* reporter; plate on media containing uracil, histidine, 5-FOA, and the library; select for colonies that grow. Supplying uracil and histidine bypasses the auxotrophies, ensuring that survival depends on lack of *URA3* expression in the presence of 5-FOA. When P1 and P2 interact, *URA3* is expressed and cells die on 5-FOA. When a compound disrupts the interaction, *URA3* is not expressed and cells survive on 5-FOA. Thus, growth directly selects for PPI disruptors.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable strategy is to use the *URA3* reporter with 5-FOA counter-selection while supplying uracil and histidine, and to select for growth, which corresponds to option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2348277"}]}
