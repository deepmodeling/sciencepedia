This requires not only guiding the Cas9 nuclease to the correct location but also providing the cell with a blueprint for repair. This exercise challenges you to design an effective repair template for Homology Directed Repair (HDR), a fundamental skill for precision gene therapy, forcing you to think beyond the cut and consider the practical details of successful template design. [@problem_id:2311218]", "problem": "A team of researchers is developing a gene therapy for a hypothetical genetic disorder caused by a single point mutation in a gene they call \"Regulin\" (`RGLN`). The disease-causing allele contains a Guanine (G) at a specific position, whereas the healthy, wild-type allele has an Adenine (A) at this same position. Their goal is to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to correct this mutation in patient-derived cells via Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n\nThe relevant DNA sequence of the `RGLN` gene containing the mutation is shown below. The 20-nucleotide sequence targeted by the guide RNA (gRNA) is underlined, the disease-causing mutation is in bold, and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence is italicized. The Cas9 nuclease is known to create a double-strand break 3 nucleotides upstream of the PAM sequence (between the 17th and 18th nucleotides of the target sequence).\n\nTarget DNA Sequence (Non-template strand):\n`5'-...TGGCAACAACGTACCTCTGTCAG**G**TGG*GGG*CATTGTAG...-3'`\n\nThe team designs several single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) repair templates.

The provided non-template strand shows the 20-nucleotide target sequence underlined as `5'-AACGTACCTCTGTCAGGTGG-3'` followed immediately by the PAM `5'-GGG-3'`. By convention for SpCas9, the double-strand break occurs 3 nucleotides upstream of the PAM on the target strand, i.e., between nucleotides 17 and 18 of the protospacer. Indexing the protospacer from 1 to 20, the bold disease-causing base is the nucleotide at position 17, immediately adjacent to the cut site (cut between 17 and 18), which is favorable for HDR incorporation of the single-nucleotide change.\n\nSecond, specify design principles for an ssODN to achieve efficient and stable HDR-mediated correction:\n- It must encode the desired base change at the mutation site (convert G to A at position 17 of the protospacer).\n- It should include sufficient homology arms flanking the cut site to support HDR.\n- Critically, it should introduce a silent change that disrupts Cas9 recognition to prevent re-cutting of the repaired allele. The most reliable approach is to mutate the PAM from NGG to a non-NGG sequence by altering one of the two terminal Gs within the PAM.\n\nThird, evaluate the provided options against these criteria:\n- Option A (`5'-TCAGATGG-3'`) is far too short to serve as an effective HDR template and lacks meaningful homology arms; it is not suitable.\n- Option B includes the corrected A at the mutation site but preserves the PAM as `GGG` and appears to introduce additional mismatches upstream that are unnecessary and could reduce HDR efficiency; it does not prevent re-cutting.\n- Option C includes extensive homology and correctly installs the A at the mutation site but retains the PAM as `GGG`, so the corrected allele would remain targetable and be re-cut by Cas9, compromising stable correction.\n- Option D includes the corrected A at the mutation site and alters the PAM from `GGG` to a non-NGG sequence (e.g., `GGC` or `GCC`, as indicated), thereby preventing Cas9 re-cutting of the repaired allele while maintaining homology across the region. This design best aligns with the principles for reliable HDR correction.\n\nTherefore, the most effective ssODN design among the given choices is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2311218"}, {"introduction": "While precision editing is powerful, the most common use of CRISPR-Cas9 is to \"knock out\" a gene's function by leveraging the cell's error-prone repair pathway, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). However, a successful knockout experiment depends critically on choosing a target site that will actually impact the final protein product. This problem tests your understanding of the central dogma of molecular biology, highlighting why a deep knowledge of gene structure is essential for effective experimental design. [@problem_id:2311240]", "problem": "A molecular biology student is learning about gene editing and is designing a theoretical experiment to generate a non-functional, or \"knockout,\" version of a specific protein in a eukaryotic cell line. The standard strategy for this involves using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This system uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific target sequence in the cell's genomic DNA, where Cas9 creates a double-strand break. The cell's primary repair mechanism for such breaks, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), is error-prone and frequently introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site. If an indel that is not a multiple of three base pairs occurs within a protein-coding region (an exon), it causes a frameshift mutation, typically leading to a premature stop codon and the production of a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nThe student identifies the target gene, which consists of several exons separated by introns. They propose targeting a sequence in the middle of a large intron, far from any exon-intron boundaries. Assuming the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery successfully generates an indel at this intronic location, which of the following statements best explains why this strategy is highly unlikely to result in a knockout of the final protein product?\n\nA. The Cas9 nuclease can only cleave DNA within exons; it cannot access the more tightly compacted DNA structure of introns.\n\nB. Guide RNAs are designed to bind to messenger RNA (mRNA), not genomic DNA, and introns are not present in the final mRNA.\n\nC. An indel within an intron, while present in the initial RNA transcript, is typically removed during the process of RNA splicing, resulting in a mature mRNA that is identical to the wild-type and thus produces a functional protein.\n\nD. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which is required for Cas9 recognition and cleavage, is only found in the exon regions of genes.\n\nE. Any mutation occurring within an intron is automatically and perfectly corrected by a specialized DNA repair pathway that does not operate on exons.", "solution": "We start from the core mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption in eukaryotic cells. A guide RNA (gRNA) directs the Cas9 nuclease to a complementary genomic DNA sequence adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), where Cas9 introduces a double-strand break. The predominant repair pathway in many cells, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), is error-prone and frequently generates small insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site. Within a protein-coding exon, indels that are not multiples of three nucleotides disrupt the reading frame (frameshift), commonly leading to premature termination codons and a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nNext, consider the genomic organization of eukaryotic genes. Coding sequences (exons) are interspersed with non-coding sequences (introns). Transcription produces a primary transcript (pre-mRNA) that contains both exons and introns. During RNA processing, introns are removed by the spliceosome, and exons are ligated to form the mature mRNA. Consequently, sequence changes confined to introns that do not disrupt essential splicing signals (canonical splice donor/acceptor sites, branch point, polypyrimidine tract) or critical intronic regulatory elements typically do not alter the mature mRNA sequence. Therefore, if a CRISPR-induced indel is introduced in the middle of a large intron, far from exon-intron boundaries and key splicing motifs, the altered intronic sequence will be excised during splicing, yielding a mature mRNA that is effectively identical to wild-type. As a result, the translated protein remains functional, and a knockout is highly unlikely.\n\nNow assess the options:\n- Option A is incorrect. Cas9 can target accessible DNA throughout the genome, including intronic regions; there is no intrinsic restriction to exons. DNA accessibility is governed by chromatin state, not exon versus intron identity per se.\n- Option B is incorrect. gRNAs base-pair with genomic DNA at the target locus (adjacent to a PAM) to direct Cas9; they are not designed to bind mRNA. While mature mRNA lacks introns, that fact is irrelevant because CRISPR-Cas9 acts on DNA, not mRNA.\n- Option C is correct. An indel within an intron that is far from splice sites will be present in the pre-mRNA but removed during splicing, resulting in a mature mRNA identical to the wild-type and a functional protein.\n- Option D is incorrect. PAM sequences are widely distributed across the genome and are not restricted to exons.\n- Option E is incorrect. There is no specialized, perfect DNA repair pathway that selectively corrects intronic mutations and not exonic ones.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that intronic indels distant from splicing determinants are spliced out and do not affect the mature mRNA or the final protein product, matching Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2311240"}, {"introduction": "After designing and performing a gene editing experiment, the crucial next step is to determine if it worked and how efficiently. Molecular biologists use various lab techniques to detect the small insertions or deletions (indels) created by CRISPR-mediated NHEJ.

To quantify the editing efficiency, they perform a T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) mismatch cleavage assay.\n\nThe process begins by extracting genomic DNA from the mixed population of edited and unedited cells. A 600 base pair (bp) region encompassing the CRISPR target site is amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The resulting PCR products are then denatured by heating and allowed to re-anneal by cooling. This process forms a mixture of DNA duplexes: wild-type/wild-type homoduplexes, edited/edited homoduplexes, and wild-type/edited heteroduplexes. T7E1 is an enzyme that specifically recognizes and cleaves the distorted DNA structure of these heteroduplexes at the site of the mismatch. For this experiment, the expected insertion/deletion (indel) mutations are located 400 bp from one end of the 600 bp amplicon.\n\nThe digested DNA is analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis followed by densitometry to measure the intensity of each DNA band. The results of the densitometry are as follows:\n- Intensity of the uncleaved, full-length 600 bp band: `I_parent = 72.0` arbitrary units.\n- Intensity of the 400 bp cleaved fragment: `I_frag1 = 13.5` arbitrary units.\n- Intensity of the 200 bp cleaved fragment: `I_frag2 = 14.5` arbitrary units.\n\nAssuming that the re-annealing of DNA strands is a random process and that all edited alleles contain an identical indel, calculate the frequency of the edited alleles in the total allele pool.
