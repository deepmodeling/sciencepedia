This practice introduces the dot plot, a simple yet powerful graphical method for comparing sequences and identifying features like duplications or inversions [@problem_id:2305638]. By analyzing a hypothetical gene duplication, you will develop an intuition for how sequence rearrangements create distinct visual signatures, deepening your understanding of genome evolution.", "problem": "A bioinformatician is analyzing a hypothetical gene, `GENE_X`, from a newly discovered organism. The reference sequence for the coding strand of this Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) gene is `GATTACACCA`. A new variant of this gene, `GENE_X_DUP`, is found in a different population of the organism. Sequence analysis reveals that `GENE_X_DUP` was formed from `GENE_X` by a single mutation: an internal tandem duplication of the three-base-pair segment `TAC` that begins at the 4th position of the original `GENE_X` sequence.\n\nTo visualize the consequence of this mutation, the bioinformatician decides to create a dot plot. A dot plot is a graphical method for comparing two sequences. One sequence is placed along the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the other along the vertical axis (y-axis). A dot is placed at any grid coordinate `(i, j)` where the character at position `i` of the x-axis sequence is identical to the character at position `j` of the y-axis sequence. In this dot plot, both the x-axis and y-axis will represent the sequence of `GENE_X_DUP`.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected features of the resulting dot plot of `GENE_X_DUP` compared against itself?\n\nA. A continuous main diagonal line running from corner to corner, and two shorter diagonal lines parallel to the main diagonal, offset from it by 3 positions.\n\nB.

A continuous main diagonal line and a single shorter diagonal line parallel to it, representing the duplicated region.\n\nE. A continuous main diagonal line, and two shorter diagonal lines parallel to it, offset by 10 positions, corresponding to the length of the original gene.", "solution": "We first reconstruct the duplicated sequence. The original coding strand for GENE_X is the string GATTACACCA with indices:\n1: G, 2: A, 3: T, 4: T, 5: A, 6: C, 7: A, 8: C, 9: C, 10: A.\nThe specified internal tandem duplication is of the segment from positions $4$ to $6$, which is the substring TAC. A tandem duplication inserts an identical copy adjacent to the original segment. Therefore, we insert TAC immediately after position $6$, preserving the remainder of the sequence. The resulting sequence is:\nfirst $6$ characters: GATTAC,\ninserted TAC: TAC,\nremainder: ACCA.\nThus, the new sequence (GENE\\_X\\_DUP) is GATTACTACACCA, of length $13$. The duplicated instances of TAC now occur at positions $4$–$6$ and $7$–$9$.\n\nNext, we consider the dot plot of the sequence against itself. For a self-comparison:\n- There is always a continuous main diagonal from $(1,1)$ to $(N,N)$, where $N$ is the sequence length, here $N=13$.\n- Repeated subsequences produce off-diagonal lines parallel to the main diagonal. If a subsequence occurs twice starting at positions $i$ and $j$, it produces a short diagonal line parallel to the main one, offset by $|j-i|$, with length equal to the length of the repeated subsequence.\n\nIn GENE\\_X\\_DUP, the duplicated subsequence TAC appears at positions $4$–$6$ and $7$–$9$. The offset between their start positions is $|7-4|=3$, and the length of the repeat is $3$. Therefore, the dot plot will show:\n- The continuous main diagonal from $(1,1)$ to $(13,13)$.\n- Two short diagonals (by symmetry, one above and one below the main diagonal), each of length $3$, parallel to the main diagonal and offset from it by $3$ positions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches exactly: main diagonal plus two shorter parallel diagonals offset by $3$ positions.\n- B is incorrect: off-diagonal parallels are not perpendicular to the main diagonal.\n- C is incorrect: a self-plot does not break the main diagonal.\n- D is incorrect: self-similarity yields two symmetric off-diagonals, not one.\n- E is incorrect: the offset is $3$, not $10$.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2305638"}, {"introduction": "Often in research, a standard bioinformatics search is only the beginning. This advanced practice simulates a real-world scenario where a default BLAST search fails to find a distant evolutionary homolog [@problem_id:2305645]. You will learn to think like a bioinformatician, strategically modifying search parameters and employing more sensitive tools like PSI-BLAST to uncover deeply hidden relationships between proteins.", "problem": "A researcher is studying a novel 300-amino-acid protein, \"Cryo-Adaptase,\" isolated from an Antarctic archaeon that thrives at -5°C. This protein is essential for maintaining cellular function in extreme cold. The researcher hypothesizes that an evolutionarily distant homolog exists in the mesophilic bacterium *Escherichia coli*, which might perform a related but different function at moderate temperatures.\n\nAn initial search was performed using the standard web-based Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), specifically BLASTp (protein-protein BLAST). The Cryo-Adaptase amino acid sequence was used as a query against the *E. coli* (strain K-12) proteome. This search, using the default parameters of the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, an Expect value (E-value) threshold of 0.05, a word size of 3, and default gap penalties, yielded no significant hits, suggesting the homolog is too divergent to be found with this standard approach.\n\nTo uncover this putative distant homolog, a more sophisticated, multi-step search strategy is required. The goal is to devise a sequence of three distinct search attempts, progressing logically from a more sensitive search to an even more sensitive one, and finally to a highly advanced search paradigm.\n\nWhich of the following options describes the most logical and effective sequence of three search strategies, ordered from the first attempt to the final attempt, to maximize the chances of identifying the highly divergent homolog?\n\nA. 1) BLASTp with BLOSUM80 matrix, E-value 1.0; 2) BLASTp with BLOSUM90 matrix, E-value 10.0; 3) BLASTn search with the DNA coding sequence of Cryo-Adaptase.\n\nB. 1) PSI-BLAST with 5 iterations against the *E. coli* proteome; 2) BLASTp with BLOSUM45 matrix, E-value 10.0; 3) BLASTp with BLOSUM62 matrix, word size 2.\n\nC. 1) BLASTp with BLOSUM45 matrix, E-value 10.0; 2) BLASTp with BLOSUM45 matrix, E-value 10.0, and word size 2; 3) A Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) search, first against the non-redundant (nr) protein database to build a robust Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), followed by a search with this PSSM against the *E. coli* proteome.\n\nD. 1) BLASTp with BLOSUM62 matrix, but with gap open penalty set to 5 and gap extend penalty to 1; 2) BLASTp with BLOSUM80 matrix, E-value 10.0; 3) A PSI-BLAST search directly against the *E. coli* proteome.\n\nE. 1) BLASTp with BLOSUM45 matrix, E-value 0.001; 2) BLASTn search with the DNA coding sequence; 3) BLASTp with BLOSUM90 matrix, E-value 10.0.", "solution": "Because the initial BLASTp with default parameters found no significant matches, the next steps should increase sensitivity systematically, moving from parameter-tuned pairwise searches to profile-based methods that capture subtle sequence signals characteristic of remote homology.\n\nFirst attempt: Use BLASTp with a substitution matrix tuned for remote homology and a permissive reporting threshold. BLOSUM45 is constructed from alignments with lower sequence identity than BLOSUM62 or BLOSUM80, which makes it more tolerant of substitutions accumulated in distant homologs. Raising the E-value threshold to a permissive value such as 10.0 allows potential weak but biologically meaningful hits to be reported for manual inspection and for guiding subsequent steps. This increases sensitivity without yet changing the algorithmic paradigm.\n\nSecond attempt: Further increase sensitivity within BLASTp by reducing the word size to 2 while retaining BLOSUM45 and a permissive E-value threshold. Decreasing the word size lowers the requirement for exact seed matches, enabling detection of weaker local similarities typical of divergent homologs, at the expense of speed. Using BLOSUM45 and a permissive E-value together with word size 2 maximizes sensitivity in a pairwise BLAST framework.\n\nThird attempt: Move to a profile-based search with PSI-BLAST, which iteratively builds a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from multiple detected homologs and thereby captures position-specific conservation and tolerated substitutions. Crucially, to build a robust PSSM, the first phase should search a large, diverse database such as the non-redundant (nr) protein database across multiple iterations, carefully curating inclusions if necessary to avoid profile drift. Once the PSSM is established from broader homologous diversity, apply this PSSM to search the E. coli K-12 proteome. This two-phase PSI-BLAST strategy increases sensitivity beyond parameter-tuned BLASTp and beyond running PSI-BLAST only against the restricted E. coli proteome.\n\nAmong the provided options, only option C follows this logical escalation: (1) BLASTp with BLOSUM45, E-value 10.0; (2) BLASTp with BLOSUM45, E-value 10.0, word size 2; (3) PSI-BLAST to build a PSSM against nr, then use that PSSM to search the E. coli proteome. The other options are suboptimal: A and E use stringent matrices (BLOSUM80/90) and BLASTn, which are ill-suited for distant protein homology; B begins with PSI-BLAST only against the E. coli proteome (too narrow to build a robust PSSM) and then regresses to less sensitive BLASTp variants; D tweaks gap penalties and uses stricter matrices before PSI-BLAST, and again builds PSI-BLAST directly on the restricted proteome, which is less effective than leveraging a broad database first.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2305645"}]}
