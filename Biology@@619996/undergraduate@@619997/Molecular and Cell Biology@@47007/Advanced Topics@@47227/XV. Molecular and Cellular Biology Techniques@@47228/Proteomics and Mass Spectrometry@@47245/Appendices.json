This problem challenges you to think like a biochemist and diagnose an unexpected result: a 'missed cleavage' where trypsin failed to cut at an expected site. Successfully explaining this phenomenon requires moving beyond basic digestion rules and considering the crucial role of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in altering a protein's chemical properties and blocking enzyme access [@problem_id:2333538].", "problem": "A researcher is studying a newly discovered regulatory protein using a proteomics approach. They treat a purified sample of the protein with trypsin, an enzyme that specifically cleaves peptide chains on the C-terminal side of lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues, with the known exception that cleavage does not occur if the following residue is a proline (P). The resulting peptide fragments are then analyzed using mass spectrometry.\n\nDuring the analysis, the researcher confidently identifies a peptide with the sequence `VAL-GLY-ALA-LYS-GLU-SER-HIS-ARG`. The data confirms that the C-terminal arginine (R) of this fragment was a valid cleavage site, as no larger peptides containing this sequence were detected. However, the researcher is surprised that this peptide exists at all, as they expected trypsin to also cleave after the internal lysine (K) residue. This would have produced two smaller fragments: `VAL-GLY-ALA-LYS` and `GLU-SER-HIS-ARG`. Since the residue following the lysine is glutamic acid (E), not proline, the standard exception does not apply.\n\nGiven this observation of a \"missed cleavage\" at the internal lysine site, which of the following is the most plausible *biochemical* explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA. The glutamic acid (E) residue following the lysine (K) has a negatively charged side chain which electrostatically repels the trypsin enzyme, preventing cleavage.\n\nB. The lysine (K) residue was chemically modified by a post-translational modification, such as acetylation or methylation, which blocks the recognition site for trypsin.\n\nC. The overall digestion was incomplete due to suboptimal experimental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature), leading to some randomly uncleaved sites throughout the protein.\n\nD. The mass spectrometer misidentified the peptide sequence; the amino acid at that position was not actually a lysine.\n\nE. Trypsin is known to be completely inactive at cleaving lysine residues and only cleaves after arginine residues.", "solution": "Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysine and arginine residues, with the specific exception that cleavage is inhibited when the residue immediately following the scissile bond (the P1' position) is proline due to steric constraints. In the identified peptide VAL-GLY-ALA-LYS-GLU-SER-HIS-ARG, the C-terminal arginine was confirmed as a valid trypsin cleavage site, indicating the enzyme was active and functional. The presence of glutamic acid after the internal lysine does not invoke the proline exception, so under standard conditions trypsin would be expected to cleave after this lysine.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is unlikely because trypsin specificity is governed by its S1 pocket, which binds the positively charged side chain of lysine or arginine at the P1 position; the identity of the P1' residue (here glutamic acid) influences preferences but generally does not prevent cleavage outright unless it is proline. An acidic residue at P1' does not electrostatically repel trypsin in a way that blocks cleavage at a correctly recognized lysine.\n- B is the most plausible biochemical explanation: post-translational modification of the lysine side chain (for example, acetylation of the epsilon-amino group) neutralizes its positive charge and abolishes the key electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged Asp-containing S1 pocket of trypsin, thereby preventing recognition and cleavage. Other lysine-directed modifications (e.g., ubiquitination, certain methylation states, or adducts) can also sterically or electrostatically hinder cleavage.\n- C describes a general experimental issue (incomplete digestion) rather than a specific biochemical property of the substrate; while missed cleavages can occur from suboptimal conditions, the question asks for the most plausible biochemical explanation, making B superior.\n- D contradicts the stated confident identification by mass spectrometry.\n- E is false; trypsin cleaves after both lysine and arginine under normal conditions.\n\nTherefore, a lysine-directed post-translational modification that blocks trypsin recognition most parsimoniously explains the missed cleavage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2333538"}]}
