The reaction is initiated using a 15-nucleotide-long primer. The method involves four separate reaction mixtures. Each mixture contains the DNA template, the primer, DNA polymerase, all four standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), and a small amount of one of four chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs: ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, or ddTTP).\n\nAfter the reactions are complete, the resulting DNA fragments are separated by size, and their lengths are measured.

This practice sharpens your understanding of why chain termination is the central \"trick\" that makes Sanger sequencing possible.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is performing a classic Sanger sequencing experiment to determine the sequence of a short, single-stranded DNA template. The 3' end of the template region of interest has the sequence:\n`3'-...GCTAACGTTAGCC-5'`\n\nThe student designs a DNA primer with the sequence `5'-CGTAATC-3'`, which is complementary to a segment of the template. The student then prepares four separate reaction tubes. Each tube contains the template DNA, the primer, a suitable DNA polymerase, and all four standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), which are dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP.\n\nThe standard protocol requires adding a small, controlled amount of a single specific dideoxynucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) to each of the four tubes: ddATP to the 'A' tube, ddCTP to the 'C' tube, ddGTP to the 'G' tube, and ddTTP to the 'T' tube. However, the student mistakenly omits this step entirely, adding no ddNTPs to any of the four reaction tubes. All other components are added correctly, and the polymerization reactions are allowed to proceed to completion.

The gel will show only a single, low-molecular-weight band corresponding to the unextended primer at the bottom of the gel in all four lanes.", "solution": "Sanger sequencing relies on chain termination by dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). A DNA polymerase extends a primer in the $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$ direction by incorporating deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) onto the primer’s $3^{\\prime}$-OH. When a ddNTP is incorporated, extension terminates because ddNTPs lack the $3^{\\prime}$-OH required for the next phosphodiester bond.\n\nIn a standard Sanger reaction for a given base $X \\in \\{ \\text{A}, \\text{C}, \\text{G}, \\text{T} \\}$, termination at positions where $X$ is to be incorporated occurs with probability determined by the ratio of ddNTP to total nucleotide of that base. For incorporation of base $X$ at a given position $i$, the probability of termination can be modeled as\n$$\nP_{\\text{term}}(i,X) = \\frac{[ddNTP_{X}]}{[ddNTP_{X}] + [dNTP_{X}]}.\n$$\nIf $[ddNTP_{X}] = 0$, then for every base,\n$$\nP_{\\text{term}}(i,X) = 0,\n$$\nso no chain termination occurs at any position due to ddNTP incorporation.\n\nIn the experiment described, the student adds no ddNTPs to any tube. DNA polymerase does not require ddNTPs to initiate or elongate; it requires a primer with a free $3^{\\prime}$-OH and dNTPs, both of which are present. Therefore, extension proceeds from the annealed primer to the end of the template without premature termination.\n\nLet $L_{\\max}$ denote the full extension length from the primer’s $3^{\\prime}$ end to the template end. The fragment length distribution then becomes degenerate:\n$$\nP(L = L_{\\max}) = 1, \\quad P(L < L_{\\max}) = 0.\n$$\nBecause all four tubes contain identical components (template, primer, polymerase, all four dNTPs) and differ in no way (no ddNTPs added), each tube yields the same full-length product population.\n\nOn a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, longer DNA fragments migrate more slowly and thus appear near the top (high molecular weight) of the gel. Consequently, each of the four lanes labeled A, C, G, and T will show a single dominant band corresponding to the full-length, completely extended product near the top of the gel, with no ladder of terminated fragments. There will not be only unextended primer (polymerase has the necessary substrates to extend), there will not be a smear (no random termination), and there will not be an absence of bands (polymerization proceeds normally without ddNTPs).\n\nTherefore, the best description is a single high-molecular-weight band in all four lanes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2337105"}, {"introduction": "In a perfect world, every experiment works with pure reagents and yields flawless data; in reality, troubleshooting is a core scientific skill. This problem [@problem_id:2337110] simulates a common real-world scenario where the starting DNA sample is contaminated with a second, different template.

The student uses a single, pure sequencing primer that anneals to a specific site on the plasmid, located just upstream of the gene insert.\n\nThe Sanger sequencing method involves DNA synthesis in the presence of all four standard deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and a small amount of four different chain-terminating dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs). Each of the four ddNTPs (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, ddTTP) is labeled with a unique fluorescent dye.\n\nUnbeknownst to the student, the purified plasmid sample is contaminated with a significant amount of a second, different plasmid. By chance, this contaminant plasmid also contains a binding site that is a perfect match for the sequencing primer.

The chromatogram will be entirely unreadable from the very first base, showing four overlapping peaks of all colors at every position.\n\nE. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence that is a random hybrid of the two different template sequences.", "solution": "Sanger sequencing uses a single primer to initiate DNA synthesis on any template that contains a perfectly complementary priming site. In the reaction, a DNA polymerase extends from this primer in the presence of all four dNTPs and small amounts of fluorescently labeled ddNTPs. Incorporation of a ddNTP terminates extension, producing a population of fragments that differ by one nucleotide in length. Capillary electrophoresis separates these fragments by size, and the detector records the fluorescent dye at the terminus of each length class. The observed chromatogram is thus the superposition of signals from all extension products generated from all template molecules that were primed.\n\nIn this scenario, there are two different plasmid templates present in significant amounts, and both contain the same perfect priming site. Therefore, both templates will be primed and extended in parallel, generating two independent ladders of terminated fragments, one for each template.\n\nFor positions immediately downstream of the primer where the two templates have identical sequence, both ladders will produce the same terminal base for each length class, so the electropherogram will show clean, single-color peaks corresponding to that shared base (with peak height reflecting the summed signal from both templates).\n\nAt the first position where the two templates differ, one template will contribute terminated fragments bearing one base while the other template contributes fragments bearing a different base at the same length. Because capillary electrophoresis resolves by fragment length, the two different terminal bases corresponding to that same position will co-migrate as two different-colored peaks at essentially the same position in the trace. From this divergence onward, unless the sequences happen to realign by chance, most subsequent positions will continue to show two different bases contributed by the two templates, yielding two superimposed, different-colored peaks at nearly every position. The relative heights of the paired peaks will reflect the relative abundances of the two templates but will not eliminate the overlap given that both are present in significant amounts.\n\nThis behavior rules out the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because the less abundant template still produces discernible peaks; the trace will not be clean for only the more abundant template.\n- B is incorrect because there is no mechanism for an abrupt loss of signal at a fixed point due to template mixture; extension continues on both templates.\n- D is incorrect because, at any given position, at most two different bases are expected across two templates, not four, and the initial identical region will appear clean.\n- E is incorrect because Sanger reads are not hybrids within a single molecule; the chromatogram is a superposition of two distinct reads, not a random intermixing into a coherent single-base call.\n\nTherefore, the expected chromatogram is clean where the sequences are identical, and from the first divergence shows two superimposed, different-colored peaks at most subsequent positions, making the sequence unreadable, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2337110"}]}
