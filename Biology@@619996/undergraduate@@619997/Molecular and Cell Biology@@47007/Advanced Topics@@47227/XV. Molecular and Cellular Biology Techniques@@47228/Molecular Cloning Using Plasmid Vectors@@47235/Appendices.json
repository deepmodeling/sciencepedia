Agarose gel electrophoresis is the workhorse technique for this analysis, but the results can sometimes seem counterintuitive. This practice problem delves into a common observation: why a pure, undigested circular plasmid often resolves into multiple bands, helping you understand the different topological forms of DNA and how they behave during electrophoresis [@problem_id:2325226].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a student performs a plasmid miniprep to isolate plasmid DNA from a bacterial culture that was grown from a single, isolated colony. The plasmid is known to be a single species of circular DNA, meaning all molecules should have the identical sequence and length. The student takes a small aliquot of this purified, circular plasmid DNA, and without performing any restriction enzyme digestion, loads it into a well of an agarose gel for electrophoresis. After the gel is run and stained with a DNA-intercalating dye, the student is surprised to see three distinct bands in the lane corresponding to their sample.\n\nAssuming the purification procedure was performed correctly, yielding a chemically pure sample of the intended plasmid with no significant contamination, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the appearance of multiple bands?\n\nA. The high-salt buffer used for plasmid storage causes the plasmid to partially degrade into a set of discrete, smaller linear fragments, each producing a band.\n\nB. The bacterial culture was a mixed population containing three different plasmids, and the purification procedure successfully co-isolated all of them.\n\nC. A homogeneous population of circular plasmids can exist in different topological forms (isomers), such as supercoiled and relaxed-circular, which possess different three-dimensional shapes and thus migrate at different rates through the gel matrix.\n\nD. During sample preparation, the plasmid DNA spontaneously ligates with other plasmid molecules to form stable dimers and trimers of integer-multiple lengths, resulting in bands at higher molecular weights.\n\nE. The electric field applied during electrophoresis causes some of the circular plasmid molecules to break at a specific, weak point in their sequence, creating a single, linear species that runs alongside the original circular form.", "solution": "We analyze why undigested, circular plasmid DNA from a single, pure plasmid species yields three distinct bands on an agarose gel.\n\nFirst, a single plasmid species can adopt different topological states (topoisomers) without any change in sequence or length. The key biological principle is that covalently closed circular DNA can exist in distinct conformations depending on superhelical density and strand integrity:\n- Supercoiled (covalently closed, intact both strands; often called Form I). This is compact and migrates fastest through agarose due to its smaller effective hydrodynamic radius.\n- Open circular or relaxed (nicked; one strand contains a single-strand break; often called Form II). Loss of superhelical tension makes the molecule more extended, so it migrates more slowly.\n- Linear (double-strand break; often called Form III). Its migration is typically intermediate relative to supercoiled and open circular of the same length in a standard agarose gel.\n\nTherefore, even a homogeneous population of plasmids by sequence naturally presents multiple bands because different topological forms migrate differently in the gel matrix, leading to discrete bands corresponding to supercoiled, linear, and nicked circular species.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n\nA is incorrect because high salt does not reproducibly create a discrete set of shorter linear fragments; random shearing or degradation would produce a smear rather than sharp bands at defined sizes.\n\nB is unlikely and inconsistent with starting from a single isolated colony and a known single plasmid species; co-isolation of multiple different plasmids would require a mixed culture, which contradicts the setup.\n\nC is correct. A homogeneous circular plasmid preparation commonly yields multiple discrete bands due to different topological forms (supercoiled, relaxed/nicked circular, and sometimes linear), which differ in shape and hence gel mobility.\n\nD is incorrect because spontaneous ligation into dimers/trimers during sample preparation would require ligase activity and a high-energy cofactor (e.g., ATP). Such multimer formation in vitro under standard miniprep storage and loading conditions is not expected and would not explain the canonical three-band pattern.\n\nE is incorrect because the electric field does not induce breakage at a specific site to yield a single, uniform linear species; any breakage would be random and typically lead to smearing, not reproducible discrete bands.\n\nThus, the observation is best explained by different topological isomers of the same plasmid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2325226"}, {"introduction": "With a verified vector in hand, the creative work of cloning begins with designing the components to assemble your final construct. This exercise challenges you to design a set of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primers for a modern, powerful technique known as homology-based cloning.
