{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The discovery of genes that regulate the cell cycle often begins in model organisms like yeast. Translating these discoveries to human biology requires a clear experimental strategy. This problem challenges you to think like a research scientist by designing the most direct experiment to determine if a newly identified human gene, *hARR1*, functions as a tumor suppressor based on its defining characteristic: that its loss promotes cancer-like cell behavior [@problem_id:2346803].", "problem": "A molecular biology research team is studying cell cycle regulation in budding yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*). They identify a previously uncharacterized gene, which they name *Arr1* (for Arrest-1), whose protein product is essential for halting the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. Database searches reveal that humans possess a single, clear homolog of this gene, which they call *hARR1*. The team hypothesizes that *hARR1* might function as a tumor suppressor gene in humans.\n\nYou are tasked with designing the most direct and informative *initial* experiment to test this hypothesis using standard cell culture techniques. From the options below, which experimental plan provides the most direct test of whether *hARR1* functions as a tumor suppressor?\n\nA. Use a gene-editing tool like CRISPR-Cas9 to create a null mutation (a knockout) in both copies of the *hARR1* gene in a line of normal, non-cancerous human epithelial cells. Then, assess whether these cells exhibit increased rates of proliferation or loss of contact inhibition compared to unmodified control cells.\n\nB. Synthesize the human *hARR1* gene and insert it into a high-expression vector. Transfect this vector into a line of normal, non-cancerous human epithelial cells to cause overexpression of the hARR1 protein. Then, measure the effect on the rate of cell division.\n\nC. Obtain a cancer cell line known to have a high proliferation rate. Transfect these cancer cells with a vector containing a functional copy of the *hARR1* gene and observe whether their rate of proliferation decreases.\n\nD. Sequence the *hARR1* gene from tissue samples collected from 100 different tumors and compare these sequences to the *hARR1* sequence from healthy tissue from the same 100 patients, looking for a higher frequency of mutations in the tumor samples.\n\nE. Isolate the messenger RNA (mRNA) from a culture of rapidly dividing human cells and from a culture of non-dividing (quiescent) human cells. Use reverse transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) to compare the expression levels of *hARR1* mRNA between the two cell populations.", "solution": "A tumor suppressor gene is defined functionally by the fact that its loss-of-function at the cellular level promotes inappropriate proliferation, loss of growth control, and related hallmarks such as loss of contact inhibition. Such genes are typically recessive at the cellular level, so a complete, biallelic loss is generally required to observe the phenotype. The most direct functional test in cell culture is therefore to remove the geneâ€™s function in otherwise normal cells and ask whether growth control is compromised.\n\nEvaluate each option against this definition and the goal of a direct, initial functional assay:\n- Option A proposes a biallelic knockout of *hARR1* in normal, non-cancerous human epithelial cells, followed by assessment of increased proliferation or loss of contact inhibition relative to isogenic controls. This directly tests whether *hARR1* is necessary to restrain cell proliferation and maintain growth control, which is the defining property of a tumor suppressor. It is a causal, loss-of-function assay in a controlled background and therefore the most direct and informative initial experiment.\n- Option B overexpresses *hARR1* in normal cells. Overexpression in normal cells may reduce proliferation for nonphysiologic reasons and does not test the hallmark, which is that loss promotes transformation. Thus, it is not a direct test of tumor suppressor function.\n- Option C reintroduces *hARR1* into a cancer cell line and checks for reduced proliferation. While restoration of function in a deficient cancer line can support tumor suppressor activity, this test is confounded unless the chosen cancer line is known to have *hARR1* loss-of-function and lacks additional dominant drivers that mask rescue. As an initial screen without prior knowledge of genotype, it is less direct and potentially non-informative.\n- Option D sequences tumors versus matched normal tissue. This is correlative, not a functional cell culture experiment, and does not directly test whether *hARR1* activity restrains proliferation.\n- Option E measures expression differences between dividing and quiescent cells. This is also correlative and does not establish causality or the defining loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most direct initial cell culture experiment to test tumor suppressor function is to knock out both alleles of *hARR1* in normal cells and assess for increased proliferation and loss of contact inhibition, as in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346803"}, {"introduction": "While the loss of tumor suppressors is one path to cancer, the activation of proto-oncogenes is another. This exercise focuses on the proto-oncogene *c-Src*, a protein kinase that acts as a tightly regulated \"go\" signal for cell growth. You are asked to predict the outcome of a specific mutation that prevents the protein from being switched off, providing a classic example of a \"gain-of-function\" mutation that can lead to oncogenic transformation [@problem_id:1507157].", "problem": "The cellular proto-oncogene *c-Src* encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, division, and survival. The activity of the *c-Src* protein is tightly controlled. A key part of this regulation involves the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, Tyr-527, located near the protein's C-terminus. This phosphorylation event, carried out by another kinase, induces a conformational change that locks *c-Src* in an inactive state.\n\nConsider a genetic engineering experiment where a mutant version of the c-Src gene is introduced into a line of normal, non-cancerous cells. In this mutant gene, the codon for the regulatory tyrosine at position 527 has been altered to code for phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is structurally very similar to tyrosine, but it lacks the hydroxyl (-OH) group on its aromatic ring.\n\nAssuming the mutant *c-Src* protein is expressed at normal levels and is otherwise stable, which of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence of this single amino acid substitution?\n\nA. The cells will exhibit characteristics of cancerous transformation, such as increased proliferation and loss of contact inhibition, because the mutant *c-Src* will be constitutively active.\n\nB. The mutant *c-Src* protein will be completely non-functional, leading to no observable change in cellular behavior compared to cells lacking *c-Src* entirely.\n\nC. The activity of the mutant *c-Src* protein will be indistinguishable from the wild-type protein, showing normal cycles of activation and inactivation.\n\nD. The mutant *c-Src* protein will be recognized as misfolded due to the substitution and will be rapidly targeted for degradation by the proteasome.\n\nE. The substrate specificity of the *c-Src* kinase will change, causing it to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues instead of tyrosine residues.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the cellular outcome of a specific mutation in the proto-oncogene *c-Src*. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Understand the wild-type regulation of *c-Src*:** The problem states that *c-Src* is a proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Its activity is negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, Tyr-527. When Tyr-527 is phosphorylated, the protein adopts an inactive conformation. This means that to be active, *c-Src* must be *dephosphorylated* at this position. This regulatory mechanism ensures that the kinase is only active when appropriate signals are received by the cell.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the involved amino acids:** The mutation replaces tyrosine (Tyr) with phenylalanine (Phe). Both are aromatic amino acids and are structurally similar. However, the key difference, as stated in the problem, is that tyrosine possesses a hydroxyl (-OH) group on its phenyl ring, whereas phenylalanine does not.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the consequence of the mutation on the regulatory mechanism:** The process of phosphorylation involves the enzymatic addition of a phosphate group ($\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) to an amino acid. For tyrosine kinases, this phosphate group is attached to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. Since the mutant protein has a phenylalanine at position 527, it lacks the necessary hydroxyl group at that site. Therefore, the mutant *c-Src* protein cannot be phosphorylated at position 527.\n\n4.  **Deduce the effect on protein activity:** The inhibitory signal for *c-Src* is the phosphorylation of Tyr-527. By replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine, we have removed the target for this inhibitory signal. The mutant *c-Src* can no longer be \"switched off\" by this mechanism. It cannot be locked into the inactive conformation that depends on the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail. As a result, the kinase domain remains in an open, active conformation, making the enzyme constitutively (continuously) active.\n\n5.  **Connect protein activity to cellular phenotype:** *c-Src* is a proto-oncogene. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that promote cell growth and division. When they become hyperactive or are expressed at excessive levels, they can become oncogenes, driving uncontrolled cell proliferation and leading to cancer. A constitutively active *c-Src* protein will continuously send growth-promoting signals downstream by phosphorylating its target proteins, irrespective of external growth signals. This unregulated signaling leads to hallmark cancer phenotypes like uncontrolled cell division and loss of contact inhibition.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **A. The cells will exhibit characteristics of cancerous transformation, such as increased proliferation and loss of contact inhibition, because the mutant *c-Src* will be constitutively active.** This aligns perfectly with our deduction. The loss of the inhibitory phosphorylation site leads to a constitutively active kinase, which drives oncogenic transformation.\n    *   **B. The mutant *c-Src* protein will be completely non-functional...** This is incorrect. The mutation affects a regulatory site, not the catalytic active site of the kinase. The core machinery for phosphorylation is intact.\n    *   **C. The activity of the mutant *c-Src* protein will be indistinguishable from the wild-type protein...** This is incorrect. The mutation specifically eliminates the primary \"off-switch\" for the protein, fundamentally altering its regulation.\n    *   **D. The mutant *c-Src* protein will be recognized as misfolded...and will be rapidly targeted for degradation...** This is unlikely. Phenylalanine is structurally very similar to tyrosine, so a major conformational disruption leading to misfolding and degradation is not the expected outcome. This type of mutation is a classic example of a gain-of-function, not loss-of-function through instability.\n    *   **E. The substrate specificity of the *c-Src* kinase will change...** This is incorrect. Substrate specificity is determined by the architecture of the kinase's active site (the catalytic domain). The mutation is in the C-terminal regulatory region, which is spatially distinct from the active site and primarily controls overall activity, not which substrates it binds.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the mutant *c-Src* becomes an oncogene, driving cancerous transformation due to its constitutive activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1507157"}, {"introduction": "Healthy cells have sophisticated checkpoint systems to halt division when DNA is damaged. This practice problem presents a scenario where this system is sabotaged by a hypothetical virus that eliminates the crucial checkpoint protein p21. By working through this problem, you will synthesize your knowledge of the entire G1/S checkpoint pathwayâ€”from the sensor p53 to the gatekeeper Rbâ€”to understand the dire consequences of replicating damaged DNA [@problem_id:2306857].", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a population of normal human fibroblasts is being studied. These cells have a functional G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. The normal response to DNA damage in these cells involves the activation of the p53 protein, which in turn induces the expression of p21, a potent inhibitor of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) complexes. The inhibition of CDKs prevents the phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), thereby keeping the cells arrested in the G1 phase to allow for DNA repair.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where the culture of fibroblasts is first exposed to a dose of ultraviolet (UV) radiation known to cause significant DNA damage. Immediately after irradiation, the culture is divided into two identical groups:\n\n- **Group A:** The cells are placed in a standard growth medium.\n- **Group B:** The cells are placed in a standard growth medium and infected with a newly discovered, non-lytic virus. This virus is known to produce a single, specific protein that targets the host cell's p21 protein for rapid degradation.\n\nAssuming the virus has no other effects on the cell, which of the following statements describes the most likely fate of the majority of cells in Group B when compared to Group A?\n\nA. The cells in Group B will enter S phase with unrepaired DNA, leading to a high frequency of mutations and genomic instability.\n\nB. The cells in Group B will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) more rapidly than the cells in Group A due to the added stress of viral infection.\n\nC. The degradation of p21 will cause the cells in Group B to arrest more permanently in the G1 phase than the cells in Group A.\n\nD. The cells in Group B will successfully repair their DNA, just like the cells in Group A, and then proceed to divide normally.\n\nE. The cells in Group B will bypass the G1 checkpoint but will be halted indefinitely at the G2/M checkpoint, which is unaffected by the virus.", "solution": "We start from the normal G1/S checkpoint response to DNA damage. UV radiation induces DNA lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers), which activate upstream sensors and stabilize/activate p53. Activated p53 upregulates transcription of p21. p21 is a CDK inhibitor that binds and inhibits G1/S CDK complexes, principally CDK4/6â€“Cyclin D and CDK2â€“Cyclin E. Inhibition of these CDKs prevents phosphorylation of Rb. Hypophosphorylated Rb binds and represses E2F transcription factors, thereby blocking transcription of S-phase genes and enforcing G1 arrest. This arrest provides time for DNA repair pathways to correct lesions before replication.\n\nIn Group A (no virus), this canonical pathway functions normally: DNA damage leads to p53 activation, p21 induction, CDK inhibition, Rb remains hypophosphorylated, E2F remains repressed, and cells arrest in G1 to repair DNA before re-entering the cell cycle.\n\nIn Group B (virus present), the virus specifically targets p21 for rapid degradation and has no other cellular effects by assumption. Although p53 is still activated by UV damage, its principal effector at the G1 checkpoint, p21, is removed. Without p21, CDK4/6â€“Cyclin D and CDK2â€“Cyclin E remain active. Active G1/S CDKs phosphorylate Rb, leading to its inactivation and release of E2F. Free E2F drives transcription of S-phase genes, enabling G1/S transition. Therefore, the G1 checkpoint is bypassed despite the presence of DNA damage.\n\nProceeding into S phase with unrepaired DNA causes replication of damaged templates, increasing mutation burden and promoting genomic instability. While severe DNA damage can ultimately trigger apoptosis via p53-dependent pathways, the immediate and most direct consequence of p21 loss at the G1 checkpoint is failure to arrest, not accelerated apoptosis. Furthermore, the statement that Group B cells would be halted indefinitely at G2/M is not supported: p21 also contributes to G2 control by inhibiting CDK1â€“Cyclin B, so its degradation would not strengthen a G2/M block, and other G2/M checkpoint mechanisms do not guarantee an indefinite halt. Similarly, asserting more permanent G1 arrest upon p21 degradation is contrary to p21â€™s inhibitory role.\n\nTherefore, compared with Group A, the majority of Group B cells will enter S phase despite unrepaired DNA, leading to a high frequency of mutations and genomic instability, which matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2306857"}]}
