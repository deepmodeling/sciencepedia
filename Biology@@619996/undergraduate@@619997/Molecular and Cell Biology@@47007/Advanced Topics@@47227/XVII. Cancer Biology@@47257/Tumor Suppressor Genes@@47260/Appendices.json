This practice problem places you in the role of a researcher, asking you to predict the outcome of an experiment involving a targeted drug. By analyzing how cells with and without the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor respond to a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitor, you can solidify your understanding of the G1/S checkpoint and appreciate the logic behind personalized cancer therapies [@problem_id:2346775].", "problem": "Two human cell lines are used in an experiment to study the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle. The first line, `WT`, consists of normal, wild-type cells. The second line, `Rb-KO`, is a cancer cell line that has undergone biallelic inactivation of the gene encoding the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), resulting in a complete absence of functional Rb protein.\n\nThe G1/S transition is primarily regulated by the Rb-E2F pathway. In G1 phase, the Rb protein binds to the E2F transcription factor, preventing it from activating genes necessary for S-phase. For a cell to enter S-phase, a complex of Cyclin E and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) must first hyperphosphorylate Rb, causing it to release E2F.\n\nIn the experiment, cultures of both `WT` and `Rb-KO` cells are first synchronized in early G1 phase. Then, each cell line is split into two groups. One group is treated with a vehicle solution (control), and the other is treated with a highly specific and potent small-molecule inhibitor of CDK2 activity. After an appropriate incubation period sufficient for G1/S transition, the percentage of cells that have entered S-phase is quantified for all four conditions.\n\nWhich of the following sets of results most accurately represents the expected outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. WT (Vehicle): 85% S-phase entry; WT (CDK2 inhibitor): 10% S-phase entry; Rb-KO (Vehicle): 90% S-phase entry; Rb-KO (CDK2 inhibitor): 88% S-phase entry.\n\nB.

In wild-type cells with functional Rb, E2F is bound by hypophosphorylated Rb in G1. To enter S-phase, Cyclin E-CDK2 activity hyperphosphorylates Rb, releasing E2F, which then activates S-phase genes. Symbolically, in WT cells the causal chain is:\n$$\\text{CDK2 active} \\implies \\text{Rb hyperphosphorylated} \\implies \\text{E2F released} \\implies S\\text{-phase entry}.$$\nTherefore, in WT with vehicle (no inhibition), CDK2 is active and the fraction entering S-phase, denoted $f(\\text{WT, vehicle})$, is high. In WT with a specific CDK2 inhibitor, CDK2 activity is blocked, preventing Rb hyperphosphorylation and E2F release, so $f(\\text{WT, CDK2i})$ is low.\n\nIn Rb-KO cells, Rb is absent. Thus E2F is not restrained by Rb, and the requirement for CDK2-mediated Rb hyperphosphorylation to free E2F is bypassed. Symbolically:\n$$\\text{Rb absent} \\implies \\text{E2F constitutively free} \\implies S\\text{-phase entry (independent of CDK2 for the G1/S gate)}.$$\nHence, in Rb-KO with vehicle, $f(\\text{Rb-KO, vehicle})$ is high, and in Rb-KO with CDK2 inhibitor, $f(\\text{Rb-KO, CDK2i})$ remains high or only minimally reduced, because the key checkpoint step controlled by Rb is already disabled.\n\nNow compare to the options:\n- Option A: WT vehicle high ($0.85$), WT inhibitor low ($0.10$), Rb-KO vehicle high ($0.90$), Rb-KO inhibitor nearly unchanged ($0.88$). This matches the logic above.\n- Option B: Rb-KO inhibitor drops to $0.15$, implying strong CDK2 dependence despite Rb absence, which contradicts the bypass of the Rb gate.\n- Option C: WT inhibitor remains high ($0.84$), contradicting the necessity of CDK2 to hyperphosphorylate Rb in WT.\n- Option D: Rb-KO inhibitor drops to $0.10$, again contradicting the bypass.\n- Option E: WT inhibitor remains high ($0.83$) and Rb-KO inhibitor drops markedly, both contradicting the expected pattern.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is best represented by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346775"}, {"introduction": "The inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene is not always due to a large deletion or a mutation in a coding region. This exercise explores a more subtle, yet equally devastating, molecular mechanism. You will investigate how a single point mutation within a non-coding intron of the *TP53* gene can lead to a non-functional protein, providing a crucial lesson on the importance of correct mRNA splicing and how its disruption can have profound pathological consequences [@problem_id:2346791].", "problem": "In molecular biology, the processing of a gene from Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into a functional protein is a multi-step process. For many eukaryotic genes, the initial transcript, or pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), contains coding regions called exons and non-coding intervening regions called introns. A process known as splicing removes the introns and ligates the exons together to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, which is then translated into a protein. The splicing machinery recognizes specific consensus sequences at the boundaries of each intron.\n\nA researcher is studying a family with a history of a rare cancer syndrome. Genetic sequencing of the TP53 gene, a critical tumor suppressor, reveals a single point mutation in one of the affected individuals. The wild-type sequence near the end of intron 7 is `` `...UCAUUCGAG'GUC...` ``, where the apostrophe denotes the correct splice site between intron 7 and exon 8. The analysis of the patient's DNA reveals a single nucleotide substitution (a G-to-A transversion), changing the sequence to `` `...UCAUUC**A**AG'GUC...` ``. Laboratory analysis confirms that this individual produces a p53 protein that is truncated (shorter than the full-length version) and non-functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular mechanism to explain how this single intronic mutation leads to the observed truncated protein product?\n\nA. The mutation creates a new, cryptic 3' splice acceptor site, causing a small portion of intron 7 to be included in the mature mRNA. This insertion results in a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon.\n\nB. The mutation directly creates a stop codon within intron 7, which is then read by the ribosome during translation, causing premature termination.\n\nC. The mutation disrupts a binding site for a transcriptional activator within the intron, leading to reduced expression of the TP53 gene and production of an unstable, partial protein.\n\nD.

The mutation alters the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA, which physically blocks the ribosome from translating past intron 7.\n\nF. The point mutation leads to the incorporation of an incorrect amino acid that signals for the premature degradation of the protein by the proteasome.", "solution": "The central issue is to understand how a single nucleotide change within a non-coding intron can result in a truncated protein. This requires an understanding of mRNA splicing and the genetic code.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the normal splicing process. The spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that removes introns from pre-mRNA. It recognizes specific sequences at the 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) ends of an intron. A highly conserved sequence at the 3' acceptor splice site is the dinucleotide AG. The spliceosome scans the pre-mRNA and cleaves precisely at this AG sequence to join the upstream exon to the downstream exon. The wild-type sequence is given as `` `...UCAUUCGAG'GUC...` ``, where the apostrophe indicates the splice junction.\n\nNow, let's examine the mutation. A G-to-A substitution occurs, changing the sequence to `` `...UCAUUC**A**AG'GUC...` ``. The original splice site is still present. However, the mutation has created a *new* `AG` dinucleotide two bases upstream of the correct site. This new sequence, `AAG`, can be recognized by the spliceosome as a potential, or \"cryptic,\" 3' splice acceptor site.\n\nIf the spliceosome utilizes this new cryptic splice site instead of the authentic one, it will cleave the pre-mRNA after this new `AAG` sequence. This means the final two nucleotides of the intron (`AG`) will not be removed. Instead, they will be erroneously included in the mature mRNA, inserted between the end of what was supposed to be exon 7 and the beginning of exon 8.\n\nThe consequence of this incorrect splicing is a change in the reading frame for translation. The insertion of two extra nucleotides into the mature mRNA will cause a frameshift mutation. Since the genetic code is read in codons (groups of three nucleotides), this insertion will alter every subsequent codon downstream of the insertion point. Frameshift mutations almost inevitably lead to the creation of a premature stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) within a short distance.\n\nWhen the ribosome translates this altered mRNA, it will proceed normally until it encounters the newly generated stop codon. At this point, translation will terminate prematurely. The result is the synthesis of a protein that is missing its entire C-terminal portion, making it shorter (truncated) and almost certainly non-functional.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this mechanism:\n- **A. The mutation creates a new, cryptic 3' splice acceptor site, causing a small portion of intron 7 to be included in the mature mRNA. This insertion results in a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon.** This perfectly matches our step-by-step reasoning. The mutation creates a new AG site, leading to the retention of 2 bases, a frameshift, and a premature stop codon, which results in a truncated protein.\n\n- **B. The mutation directly creates a stop codon within intron 7, which is then read by the ribosome during translation, causing premature termination.** This is incorrect. Introns are removed *before* translation. A stop codon within an intron would be spliced out with the rest of the intron and would never be seen by a ribosome.\n\n- **C. The mutation disrupts a binding site for a transcriptional activator within the intron, leading to reduced expression of the TP53 gene and production of an unstable, partial protein.** While introns can contain regulatory elements, this mechanism would primarily affect the *quantity* of transcription, not necessarily lead to a *truncated* protein. A partial protein product is not the primary outcome.\n\n- **D. The mutation strengthens the affinity of the spliceosome for the original splice site, causing it to skip the adjacent exon 8 entirely, resulting in a shorter mRNA and protein.** This describes a phenomenon called exon skipping. While this can happen, creating a new splice site (as in option A) is a more direct consequence of the described mutation than somehow strengthening a downstream site to cause skipping. Also, the mutation is an `AAG`, which can be part of a canonical splice acceptor sequence, making its use as a cryptic site highly plausible.\n\n- **E. The mutation alters the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA, which physically blocks the ribosome from translating past intron 7.** This is incorrect because the ribosome does not translate pre-mRNA; it translates mature mRNA from which introns have already been removed.\n\n- **F. The point mutation leads to the incorporation of an incorrect amino acid that signals for the premature degradation of the protein by the proteasome.** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the mutation is in an intron, which is non-coding, so it does not directly change an amino acid. Second, even if it were a missense mutation in an exon, this would lead to a full-length (but possibly misfolded and unstable) protein, not a truncated one resulting directly from synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate explanation is that the mutation creates a cryptic splice site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346791"}, {"introduction": "The \"two-hit\" hypothesis provides a powerful framework for understanding why inherited mutations in tumor suppressor genes dramatically increase cancer risk.
