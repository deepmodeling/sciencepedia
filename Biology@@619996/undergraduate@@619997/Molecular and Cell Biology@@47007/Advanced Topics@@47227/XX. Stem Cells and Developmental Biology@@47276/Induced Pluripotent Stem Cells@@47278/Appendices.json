This practice problem [@problem_id:2319474] challenges you to predict the outcome when a key factor, the oncogene c-Myc, is omitted, forcing you to consider the trade-offs between reprogramming efficiency and the safety of the resulting cells.", "problem": "Cellular reprogramming is a technique used to convert a specialized, differentiated cell, such as a skin fibroblast, into a different cell type. A landmark achievement in this field was the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. This process typically involves the forced expression of a specific cocktail of transcription factors. The original and most common set of these reprogramming factors, often called the \"Yamanaka factors,\" consists of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc.\n\nA molecular biology researcher is conducting an experiment to generate iPSCs from mouse fibroblasts. The standard protocol involves introducing all four Yamanaka factors. However, for a specific experimental condition, the researcher decides to use a modified reprogramming cocktail that includes Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, but deliberately omits the c-Myc factor.\n\nAssuming all other experimental conditions are optimal, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this experiment compared to the standard four-factor reprogramming process?\n\nA. Reprogramming will occur, but at a significantly lower efficiency. The resulting iPSC colonies, although fewer in number, will generally exhibit higher genomic stability and a lower tendency to form tumors.\n\nB. Reprogramming will fail completely. No iPSC colonies will form because c-Myc is an indispensable component for initiating the dedifferentiation process.\n\nC. The fibroblasts will dedifferentiate into a partially reprogrammed state but will be unable to achieve full pluripotency. The resulting cells will not be able to differentiate into all three primary germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).\n\nD. The efficiency of reprogramming will not be affected, but the resulting iPSCs will take significantly longer to mature into stable colonies.\n\nE. The reprogramming efficiency will increase substantially because the absence of the pro-apoptotic factor c-Myc will lead to greater cell survival during the stressful reprogramming process.", "solution": "We compare outcomes when omitting c-Myc from the Yamanaka factors. Empirically and mechanistically, c-Myc is not strictly indispensable for inducing pluripotency; Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK) alone can reprogram somatic cells into iPSCs, albeit with markedly reduced efficiency and slower kinetics. Therefore, any claim that reprogramming fails completely without c-Myc is incorrect.\n\nc-Myc functions as a potent transcriptional amplifier that promotes cell cycle entry, biosynthetic capacity, and loosening of chromatin, all of which facilitate reprogramming. Its inclusion generally increases the number of reprogrammed colonies and accelerates their appearance. Consequently, removal of c-Myc decreases efficiency rather than increasing it, contradicting the notion that its absence would enhance efficiency due to decreased apoptosis.\n\nWhile omission of c-Myc reduces efficiency, OSK-only iPSCs can still achieve bona fide pluripotency, including the ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. Hence, the claim that OSK reprograms only to a partial state unable to reach full pluripotency is not accurate as a general prediction under optimal conditions.\n\nc-Myc is oncogenic and is associated with increased risks of genomic instability and tumorigenicity in reprogrammed cells or chimeras. Removing c-Myc tends to produce fewer iPSC colonies but with improved safety profiles, including lower tumor propensity and generally higher genomic stability relative to OSKM protocols.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that reprogramming proceeds at significantly lower efficiency without c-Myc, while the resulting colonies tend to be safer (reduced tumorigenic potential and improved genomic stability) compared to four-factor reprogramming.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319474"}, {"introduction": "A cell's identity is defined by the genes it actively expresses. For a fibroblast to become a pluripotent stem cell, it must not only activate a new set of pluripotency genes but also turn off its old program. This exercise [@problem_id:1695019] explores the concept of epigenetic silencing, a fundamental mechanism for erasing somatic cell memory during successful reprogramming.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying cellular reprogramming. They begin with a culture of mouse dermal fibroblasts, which are specialized somatic cells primarily responsible for synthesizing components of the extracellular matrix. A key gene for this function is *Col1a1*, which encodes the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen and is highly expressed in these fibroblasts.\n\nThe biologist successfully reprograms these fibroblasts into Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) by introducing a specific set of transcription factors. The successful conversion to a pluripotent state is confirmed by verifying the strong expression of pluripotency-associated genes, such as *Oct4* and *Nanog*.\n\nConsidering the fundamental principles of cellular reprogramming and pluripotency, what is the expected expression status of the fibroblast-specific gene, *Col1a1*, in the resulting stable and fully reprogrammed iPSC line?\n\nA. The *Col1a1* gene will remain actively expressed at high levels, as this genetic information is directly inherited from the original fibroblast.\n\nB. The *Col1a1* gene will be transcribed at an even higher rate in iPSCs compared to fibroblasts to support the structural needs of rapid cell division.\n\nC. The *Col1a1* gene, although still present in the genome, will be epigenetically silenced and its transcription will be negligible.\n\nD. The *Col1a1* gene will be excised from the genome as part of the process of erasing the somatic cell identity.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the fundamental principle of induced pluripotency: reprogramming somatic cells to iPSCs entails a global resetting of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape from a lineage-committed state to a pluripotent state. This is typically driven by exogenous expression of pluripotency-inducing transcription factors (classically Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc), whose sustained activity establishes and stabilizes a gene regulatory network characterized by high expression of pluripotency genes (e.g., Oct4, Nanog) and suppression of lineage-specific programs.\n\nKey mechanistic point: the reprogramming process does not remove or alter the genomic DNA sequence; instead, it remodels epigenetic marks and chromatin accessibility to change transcriptional output. Thus, lineage genes remain present but are transcriptionally repressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs.\n\nApplying this to the fibroblast-specific gene Col1a1:\n1) In dermal fibroblasts, Col1a1 is highly expressed as part of the fibroblast identity program, contributing to type I collagen production.\n2) In successful, stable iPSCs, the pluripotency network actively suppresses differentiation programs through epigenetic silencing (e.g., promoter DNA methylation, repressive histone modifications such as H3K27me3, and chromatin compaction) at somatic lineage loci, including fibroblast markers like Col1a1.\n3) Therefore, while the Col1a1 gene remains present in the genome, its transcription becomes negligible in a fully reprogrammed iPSC line.\n4) This reasoning excludes alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because transcriptional states are not simply inherited; reprogramming erases somatic transcriptional programs in stable iPSCs.\n- Option B is incorrect because iPSCs do not require high extracellular matrix gene expression for rapid division; proliferation in iPSCs is supported by a distinct metabolic and cell-cycle program, not by collagen synthesis.\n- Option D is incorrect because reprogramming does not excise genes; it is an epigenetic reprogramming process without genomic deletion of lineage loci.\n\nTherefore, the expected expression status of Col1a1 in stable and fully reprogrammed iPSCs is that it is epigenetically silenced with negligible transcription, while the gene remains intact in the genome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1695019"}, {"introduction": "Generating colonies that look like stem cells is only the first step; rigorous validation is essential to confirm true pluripotency. A critical milestone is demonstrating that the iPSCs' pluripotent state is self-sustaining, driven by the cell's endogenous machinery rather than the artificial genes initially introduced. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1694993] guides you through the design of a definitive molecular experiment to distinguish between exogenous transgene expression and the desired endogenous pluripotency network activation.", "problem": "A researcher is working to validate a newly generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line. The iPSCs were created by reprogramming adult dermal fibroblasts using a retroviral vector that simultaneously expresses the four Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. A critical validation step is to confirm that the expression of these exogenous, virally-delivered transgenes has been transcriptionally silenced, and that the cell's pluripotent state is now maintained by its endogenous gene network.\n\nThe retroviral vector was designed such that each of the four transgene coding sequences is followed by a unique, non-human sequence tag, `vTag`, located within the transcribed 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR). This `vTag` sequence is absent from the endogenous human versions of the genes.\n\nThe researcher has access to RNA isolated from three cell populations:\n1.  The newly established iPSC line.\n2.  The original parental fibroblast line (pre-reprogramming).\n3.  A well-characterized human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line to serve as a positive control for pluripotency.\n\nThe researcher plans to use Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), a technique used to detect and quantify messenger RNA (mRNA), to assess gene expression. Which of the following experimental sets constitutes the most rigorous and conclusive approach to verify both the silencing of an exogenous transgene and the authentic pluripotent state of the new iPSC line?\n\nA. Perform RT-PCR on the iPSC and fibroblast samples. Use one primer set that amplifies a region within the coding sequence of `OCT4` and a second primer set for the housekeeping gene `GAPDH`.\n\nB. Perform RT-PCR on the iPSC sample only. Use one primer set with a forward primer in the `SOX2` coding sequence and a reverse primer in the `vTag` sequence, and a second primer set specific for the endogenous `NANOG` 3' UTR.\n\nC. Perform RT-PCR on all three samples (iPSC, fibroblast, hESC) using primers for the housekeeping gene `ACTB` and primers specific for the endogenous `POU5F1` (the gene encoding Oct4) 3' UTR.\n\nD. Perform RT-PCR on all three samples (iPSC, fibroblast, hESC). Use three separate primer sets: (1) primers for the housekeeping gene `GAPDH`; (2) primers specific for the endogenous `NANOG` 3' UTR; (3) a forward primer in the `c-Myc` coding sequence and a reverse primer in the unique `vTag` sequence.\n\nE. Extract genomic DNA (gDNA) from the iPSC and fibroblast samples. Perform a standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using a primer set where both primers bind to sequences within the integrated viral LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats) which flank the transgenes.", "solution": "The goal is to verify two independent but related conditions using RT-PCR: first, that exogenous, virally delivered reprogramming transgenes are transcriptionally silenced in the iPSC line; second, that the pluripotent state is maintained by endogenous pluripotency genes, as seen in bona fide pluripotent cells.\n\nTo demonstrate silencing of the exogenous transgenes, the RT-PCR must selectively detect only the viral transcripts and not the endogenous mRNAs. The retroviral vector includes a unique sequence tag, vTag, in the transcribed 3' UTR that is absent in endogenous human genes. Therefore, a primer pair with one primer in the shared coding region (e.g., c-Myc) and the other in the unique vTag will yield an amplicon only if the exogenous viral transcript is present. Absence of this product in iPSC cDNA indicates transgene silencing at the mRNA level. Using such a primer design on RNA (not genomic DNA) ensures the readout reflects transcriptional activity, which is required to assess silencing; genomic PCR cannot address transcription and only informs on integration.\n\nTo demonstrate authentic pluripotency maintained by endogenous networks, the RT-PCR must specifically detect endogenous pluripotency transcripts and avoid confounding signal from any residual exogenous sequences. This is achieved by designing primers to regions unique to endogenous transcripts, such as the endogenous 3' UTRs (e.g., NANOG 3' UTR or POU5F1/Oct4 3' UTR), which are not present in the retroviral constructs. Robust endogenous pluripotency gene expression in the iPSC sample should mirror that of a well-characterized hESC control and be absent or minimal in the parental fibroblasts.\n\nAppropriate controls are essential. A housekeeping gene (e.g., GAPDH or ACTB) must be included across all samples to control for RNA integrity and cDNA input. Including all three cell populations provides necessary benchmarking: fibroblasts serve as a negative control for endogenous pluripotency gene expression; hESCs serve as a positive control for endogenous pluripotency gene expression and as a negative control for vTag-containing exogenous transcripts; the iPSC line should be positive for endogenous pluripotency markers and negative for vTag amplicons if reprogramming was successful and transgenes are silenced.\n\nEvaluating the options: Option A lacks hESC controls and cannot distinguish endogenous versus exogenous OCT4 because coding-sequence primers amplify both. Option B uses iPSC only and lacks housekeeping and comparator controls, reducing rigor. Option C includes controls and endogenous 3' UTR detection but lacks any assay for exogenous transcripts, so it cannot confirm transgene silencing. Option E assesses genomic integration via LTRs, which does not report transcriptional silencing or pluripotency. Option D includes all three sample types, a housekeeping control, an assay specific for endogenous pluripotency transcripts via a 3' UTR primer set, and a vTag-specific assay for an exogenous transgene transcript, thereby directly testing both criteria with appropriate controls. Therefore, Option D is the most rigorous and conclusive approach.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1694993"}]}
