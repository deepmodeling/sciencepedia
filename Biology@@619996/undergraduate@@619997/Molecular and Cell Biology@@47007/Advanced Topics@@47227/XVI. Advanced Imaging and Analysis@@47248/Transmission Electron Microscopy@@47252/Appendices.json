This a hands-on problem that simulates a critical step in this process: ultramicrotomy. By applying the principles of thin-film interference, you will learn how to estimate the thickness of a biological section based on its color, a vital skill for ensuring your sample is thin enough for high-resolution analysis [@problem_id:2346591].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is preparing a tissue sample for analysis with a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The sample has been fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in an epoxy resin with a refractive index of $n_{resin} = 1.55$. Using an ultramicrotome, the researcher cuts sections from the resin block, which are then floated onto the surface of a water-filled trough ($n_{water} = 1.33$). When observing the sections under white light at near-normal incidence, they consistently display a bright, uniform gold color. This color indicates that light with a vacuum wavelength of approximately $\\lambda_{gold} = 600$ nm is being strongly reflected. For high-resolution ultrastructural analysis (e.g., resolving the detailed structure of ribosomes or membranes), the section thickness should ideally be no more than 70 nm.\n\nBased on the observed color, which of the following options provides the most accurate estimate for the section thickness and a correct assessment of its suitability for high-resolution TEM imaging? Assume the thinnest possible section that could produce this color.\n\nA. The estimated thickness is approximately 97 nm, which is unsuitable for high-resolution imaging.\n\nB.

The estimated thickness is approximately 113 nm, which is suitable for high-resolution imaging.", "solution": "At near-normal incidence, the section behaves as a thin film of refractive index $n_{resin}$ bounded by air above ($n_{air} \\approx 1$) and water below ($n_{water} = 1.33$). Reflection at the air–resin interface (low to high index) incurs a phase shift of $\\pi$, while reflection at the resin–water interface (high to low index) incurs no phase shift. Therefore, there is a net $\\pi$ phase difference between the two reflected rays independent of thickness.\n\nFor a film with one phase inversion, constructive interference for reflection at a vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_{0}$ occurs when the optical path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength in the film. This condition is given by:\n$$\n2 n_{resin} t = (m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda_{0}, \\quad m = 0, 1, 2, ...\n$$\nSolving for thickness $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{(m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda_{0}}{2 n_{resin}}\n$$\nAlternatively, considering the total phase difference, constructive interference occurs when:\n$$\n\\frac{4\\pi n_{resin} t}{\\lambda_{0}} + \\pi = 2k\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2, 3, ...\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{(2k - 1)\\lambda_{0}}{4 n_{resin}}\n$$\nThe thinnest section corresponds to $k=1$ (or $m=0$ in the first formula).
