Initially, they are using a low-power objective lens with a magnification of 10x. Through the eyepiece, they measure the diameter of the circular illuminated area, known as the Field of View (FOV), to be 1.8 mm. To observe finer details of an individual cell, the student switches to a high-power oil immersion objective with a magnification of 100x, while keeping the same eyepiece. Assuming the FOV diameter is inversely proportional to the total magnification, calculate the new diameter of the Field of View.

This thought-provoking exercise [@problem_id:2306009] delves into the physical limits of light microscopy, linking the concepts of resolution and magnification. By calculating the maximum *useful* magnification using the Abbe criterion, you will understand the critical difference between making an image larger and actually revealing more detail, a concept known as \"empty magnification.\"", "problem": "A cell biologist is setting up an advanced fluorescence microscope to visualize cytoskeletal filaments within a fixed mammalian cell. The filaments are labeled with a fluorophore that emits light with a peak wavelength of $\\lambda = 509$ nm. The biologist is using a high-performance oil-immersion objective lens with a Numerical Aperture ($NA$) of 1.40. The $NA$ of a lens is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. The limit of resolution, $d$, of a microscope objective is the smallest distance between two points that can be distinguished as separate entities. This limit is governed by the diffraction of light and can be estimated using the Abbe criterion: $d = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{\\text{NA}}$.\n\nThe concept of \"maximum useful magnification\" refers to the total magnification at which the smallest detail resolved by the objective lens is magnified to a size equal to the smallest detail resolvable by the unaided human eye at its typical near-point viewing distance.
