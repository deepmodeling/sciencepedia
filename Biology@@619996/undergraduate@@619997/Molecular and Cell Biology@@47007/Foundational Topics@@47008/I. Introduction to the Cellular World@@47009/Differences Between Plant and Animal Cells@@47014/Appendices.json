By analyzing this scenario, you will gain a concrete understanding of concepts like turgor pressure and cytolysis.", "problem": "A first-year biology student is preparing microscope slides for observation. They have two samples: a droplet of human blood and a thin section from the root tip of an onion plant. The standard protocol requires mounting these samples in an isotonic saline solution to preserve cell structure. However, the student mistakenly uses a dropper bottle filled with pure, deionized water for both slides. Assuming enough time passes for osmotic processes to reach a conclusion, predict the distinct fates of a typical human red blood cell and a plant root epidermal cell under these conditions.\n\nA.

The red blood cell will swell and burst, while the plant cell will shrink and shrivel.", "solution": "We analyze water movement by osmotic principles. The driving force for water across a semipermeable membrane is the difference in water potential, where for cells at microscopic scale we take $\\Psi = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p}$, with solute (osmotic) potential $\\Psi_{s} < 0$ and pressure (turgor) potential $\\Psi_{p} \\ge 0$. Pure, deionized water outside is the reference with $\\Psi_{\\text{out}} = 0$. Initially, both cells have $\\Psi_{p}=0$ and intracellular $\\Psi_{s}<0$, so $\\Psi_{\\text{in}}<0=\\Psi_{\\text{out}}$, and water enters the cells.\n\nEquivalently, the osmotic pressure difference is given by the van’t Hoff relation $\\Pi = i R T C$, and the volume flux of water can be written as\n$$\nJ_{v} = L_{p}\\left(\\Delta \\Pi - \\Delta P\\right),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic conductivity, $\\Delta \\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure difference favoring influx, and $\\Delta P$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference opposing influx.\n\nFor the human red blood cell (no rigid wall), water influx increases cell volume. Because there is no rigid wall, $\\Delta P$ cannot rise sufficiently via wall-generated turgor; the membrane can only tolerate limited area expansion before rupture. Thus, as water continues to enter under $\\Delta \\Pi>0$ with insufficient compensating $\\Delta P$, the RBC swells until the membrane reaches its lytic tension and the cell undergoes hemolysis (bursts).\n\nFor the plant root epidermal cell (rigid cell wall), water influx increases volume and stretches the wall, which generates a rising turgor pressure $\\Psi_{p}$ (equivalently increasing $\\Delta P$). In pure water, equilibrium is reached when\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{in}} = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p} = \\Psi_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\Psi_{p} = -\\Psi_{s} > 0,\n$$\nor, in pressure terms, when $\\Delta P = \\Delta \\Pi$ so that $J_{v}=0$. The rigid wall allows a positive turgor pressure that halts further influx without rupture, leaving the plant cell swollen (turgid) but intact.\n\nTherefore, the red blood cell will swell and burst, while the plant cell will swell but remain intact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312303"}, {"introduction": "Beyond withstanding osmotic pressure, the rigid cell wall profoundly influences dynamic cellular processes such as cell division. This exercise [@problem_id:2312324] asks you to perform a differential diagnosis, acting as a microscopist to find the single, unambiguous feature distinguishing a dividing plant cell. This practice will solidify your understanding of cytokinesis by contrasting the \"outside-in\" cleavage furrow mechanism of animal cells with the \"inside-out\" formation of a cell plate in plants.", "problem": "An electron microscopist is examining a collection of actively dividing eukaryotic cells from various unspecified organisms. All of the prepared samples have been captured during telophase, the final stage of nuclear division, which is concurrent with cytokinesis (the division of the cytoplasm). The goal is to sort the micrographs into two categories: plant cells and animal cells. Which one of the following observable structural features, if present in a micrograph, would provide an unambiguous identification of a cell as a plant cell?\n\nA. A cleavage furrow, appearing as an indentation on the cell surface, that is progressively deepening to divide the cell.\n\nB. The presence of distinct centrioles located at each of the spindle poles.\n\nC. A disc-like developing structure, known as a cell plate, forming at the equatorial plane of the cell.\n\nD. Condensed chromosomes decondensing back into chromatin within newly forming nuclei.\n\nE. An abundance of mitochondria distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the two nascent daughter cells.", "solution": "We need a structural feature that uniquely identifies a plant cell during telophase/cytokinesis. The key cytological principle is that plant and animal cells complete cytokinesis by distinct mechanisms because plant cells possess a rigid cell wall whereas animal cells do not.\n\nEvaluate each option against established cell biology:\n\n- Option A (cleavage furrow): Animal cells undergo cytokinesis via a contractile ring of actin and myosin that produces a cleavage furrow which deepens until the cell splits. This is characteristic of animal cells, not plant cells. Therefore, its presence would argue against a plant cell.\n\n- Option B (centrioles at spindle poles): Distinct centrioles are a hallmark of most animal cells’ centrosomes. Most higher plant cells lack centrioles; while some lower plants/algae may possess centrioles associated with flagella, their presence is not a defining plant trait and would more strongly suggest an animal cell. This does not unambiguously identify a plant cell.\n\n- Option C (cell plate at the equatorial plane): Plant cells perform cytokinesis by assembling a cell plate at the equator through vesicle fusion directed by the phragmoplast; the cell plate matures into the new cell wall and middle lamella between daughter cells. The presence of a forming cell plate is the classic, unambiguous indicator of plant cytokinesis.\n\n- Option D (chromosomes decondensing): Chromosome decondensation in telophase is common to both plant and animal cells and is not diagnostic.\n\n- Option E (abundant mitochondria): Both plant and animal cells have many mitochondria; this is not diagnostic.\n\nTherefore, the unique, unambiguous plant feature in telophase/cytokinesis is a developing cell plate forming at the equatorial plane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2312324"}, {"introduction": "The differences between plant and animal cells also manifest at the molecular level, particularly in their strategies for energy storage. This problem [@problem_id:2312287] presents a biochemical puzzle where you must interpret experimental data to identify a cell's primary storage polysaccharide. By analyzing the results of enzymatic digestion, you will learn to connect the specific molecular structures of starch and glycogen to the kingdoms they characterize.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying an unidentified, non-photosynthetic eukaryotic cell line. To characterize its primary method of glucose storage, the biologist conducts the following experiment. The cells are cultured in a medium containing glucose in which all carbon atoms are the radioactive isotope carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$). After a sufficient incubation period to allow for glucose uptake and storage, the cells are harvested and lysed. The total polysaccharide fraction is isolated from the cell lysate.\n\nThis isolated polysaccharide fraction is then divided into two equal samples and treated as follows:\n- **Sample 1:** Treated with $\\alpha$-amylase, an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ glycosidic bonds.\n- **Sample 2:** Treated with a mixture of $\\alpha$-amylase and isoamylase. Isoamylase is a debranching enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ glycosidic bonds.\n\nAfter the enzymatic reactions are complete, the amount of radioactivity released in the form of small, soluble molecules (primarily glucose) is measured for each sample. The results show that the radioactivity released from Sample 1 is significant. However, the radioactivity released from Sample 2 is approximately three times greater than that released from Sample 1.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following is the most valid conclusion?\n\nA. The cells are likely animal cells because their storage polysaccharide is highly branched.\n\nB. The cells are likely plant cells because their storage polysaccharide contains $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ linkages.\n\nC. The experiment is inconclusive because the cells were non-photosynthetic.\n\nD. The cells are likely plant cells because their storage polysaccharide contains $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages.\n\nE. The cells are likely fungal cells because they store energy in the form of chitin.", "solution": "Define $R_{1}$ as the radioactivity released as small, soluble molecules after treatment with $\\alpha$-amylase alone, and $R_{2}$ as the radioactivity released after treatment with $\\alpha$-amylase plus isoamylase. The observation is $R_{2} \\approx 3 R_{1}$.\n\nKey enzymatic specificities:\n- $\\alpha$-amylase hydrolyzes internal $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ glycosidic bonds, producing maltose, maltotriose, and larger fragments, but it cannot cleave $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ branch points. When acting on a branched polysaccharide, it generates limit dextrins that remain resistant due to $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages.\n- Isoamylase (a debranching enzyme) hydrolyzes $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages, converting branched structures into linear $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ chains that become fully accessible to $\\alpha$-amylase.\n\nInterpretation of the measured radioactivity:\n- The polysaccharide was biosynthesized from $^{14}\\text{C}$-glucose; thus, radioactivity in released small molecules reflects the extent of hydrolysis of the storage polysaccharide to soluble products (principally glucose and small oligosaccharides).\n- If the storage polymer were primarily linear with $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ linkages (e.g., amylose), then debranching would add negligible additional hydrolysis, predicting $R_{2} \\approx R_{1}$.\n- If the storage polymer were branched but with relatively sparse $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages (as in amylopectin), debranching would increase release, but the increment would be limited.\n- A large increase, $R_{2} \\gg R_{1}$ (here, approximately threefold), implies that many residues were sequestered behind $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ branch points, consistent with a highly branched glucan.\n\nBiological mapping of polymer structures:\n- Glycogen (the storage polysaccharide of animals and many fungi) has a backbone of $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ linkages with frequent $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ branches, i.e., it is highly branched. Therefore, isoamylase markedly increases susceptibility to $\\alpha$-amylase, leading to a large increase in released soluble radioactivity.\n- Plant starch comprises amylose (linear, $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$) and amylopectin (branched with $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ but less densely than glycogen). Debranching increases amylolysis, but typically less dramatically than for glycogen.\n- Chitin is a structural polysaccharide of $\\beta(1 \\to 4)$ N-acetylglucosamine; it is not a glucose storage polymer and would not be hydrolyzed by $\\alpha$-amylase or isoamylase as used here.\n\nLogical conclusions relative to the options:\n- The data require both $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ and $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages and indicate high branch density. This best matches glycogen.\n- Option B is not discriminating because both starch and glycogen contain $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ linkages.\n- Option D is insufficient because both amylopectin (plants) and glycogen contain $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages; the magnitude of the increase points to higher branching, favoring glycogen.\n- Option C is incorrect; photosynthetic status is irrelevant to the enzymatic and structural inference.\n- Option E is incorrect; chitin is not an energy storage polysaccharide and has $\\beta(1 \\to 4)$ linkages.\n\nTherefore, the most valid conclusion from the magnitude of $R_{2}$ relative to $R_{1}$ is that the storage polysaccharide is highly branched, consistent with glycogen, supporting that the cells are likely animal cells (among the provided choices).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312287"}]}
