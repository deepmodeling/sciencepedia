The alga is grown in a liquid medium under optimal light and nutrient conditions. The researcher has access to two potent and highly specific antibiotics:\n\n1.  **Inhibitor-P**: This antibiotic selectively binds to and inactivates prokaryotic-type 70S ribosomes, halting protein synthesis. It does not affect eukaryotic-type 80S ribosomes.\n2.  **Inhibitor-E**: This antibiotic selectively binds to and inactivates eukaryotic-type 80S ribosomes, halting protein synthesis. It does not affect prokaryotic-type 70S ribosomes.\n\nThe researcher sets up two identical cultures of the alga. To one culture, they add a sufficient concentration of Inhibitor-P. To the other, they add a sufficient concentration of Inhibitor-E. They then monitor both cultures for several days, measuring changes in cell population size (as an indicator of cell division) and the average chlorophyll content per cell (as an indicator of photosynthetic machinery integrity).\n\nAssuming the currently accepted model for the origin of eukaryotic organelles, which of the following outcomes is the most likely observation?\n\nA.

In the culture with Inhibitor-P, there is no significant change; in the culture with Inhibitor-E, cell division halts, and chlorophyll content decreases.\n\nC.

Identify ribosome types and antibiotic targets:\n- Cytosolic ribosomes in eukaryotic algae are 80S. These are inhibited by Inhibitor-E and are not affected by Inhibitor-P.\n- Chloroplast ribosomes are prokaryote-like 70S. These are inhibited by Inhibitor-P and are not affected by Inhibitor-E.\n\n2. Predict outcome with Inhibitor-P (70S inhibitor):\n- Direct effect: Chloroplast translation stops. Proteins required for photosystems, thylakoid complexes, and chlorophyll biosynthesis/maintenance turn over but cannot be replenished.\n- Consequence for chlorophyll content: Because chlorophyll-binding proteins and biosynthetic enzymes cannot be newly synthesized in the chloroplast, the average chlorophyll content per cell decreases over time as existing complexes degrade or dilute.\n- Consequence for cell division: Cytosolic 80S translation remains functional, so the general cell cycle machinery can continue to operate. Therefore, cell division does not immediately halt. Over longer times, impaired photosynthesis may slow growth, but the characteristic immediate effect is a decrease in chlorophyll content without an immediate cessation of division.\n\n3. Predict outcome with Inhibitor-E (80S inhibitor):\n- Direct effect: Cytosolic translation stops. Progression through the cell cycle requires continual synthesis of nuclear-encoded proteins on 80S ribosomes; thus, cell division halts.\n- Consequence for chlorophyll content: Chloroplast 70S ribosomes are unaffected directly, so chloroplast-encoded proteins can still be synthesized. Moreover, existing chlorophyll and photosynthetic complexes persist initially. Although many chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded and normally synthesized on 80S ribosomes and imported into the chloroplast, their absence manifests progressively; hence, chlorophyll content is not immediately affected.\n\n4.

This hypothetical scenario challenges you to explore the selective pressures that determine the fate of genes within the nascent organelle's genome. By considering the concepts of functional redundancy and essentiality, you will deduce why certain genes are retained in organellar genomes while thousands of others are not [@problem_id:2313732].", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical scenario in the early stages of eukaryogenesis, after an alphaproteobacterium has been engulfed by an archaeal host cell, establishing an endosymbiotic relationship. The host cell possesses a complete, functional glycolytic pathway in its cytosol. The endosymbiont also has its own complete glycolytic pathway and, crucially, possesses a gene named `hemZ`. The `hemZ` gene codes for an enzyme that performs the final, unique catalytic step in synthesizing a special cofactor, \"Heme-X,\" which is essential for the function of a novel, highly efficient terminal oxidase in the endosymbiont's respiratory chain. The host cell lacks any gene capable of synthesizing Heme-X.\n\nOver evolutionary time, the process of Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT) occurs, where genes from the endosymbiont's genome are transferred to the host's nucleus. This is accompanied by a general trend of reductive evolution in the nascent organelle's genome. We are interested in the relative persistence of two specific genes within the endosymbiont's (now, the proto-mitochondrion's) genome:\n1.  The `hemZ` gene.\n2.  A gene named `glyY`, which codes for a glycolytic enzyme whose function is identical to an enzyme already produced by the host's own nuclear genes.\n\nAssuming that both `hemZ` and `glyY` are subject to the same baseline rate of mutational loss and transfer to the host nucleus, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the evolutionary fate of these two genes within the proto-mitochondrial genome?\n\nA. The `glyY` gene is more likely to be retained in the proto-mitochondrial genome for a longer period than the `hemZ` gene.\n\nB. The `hemZ` gene is more likely to be retained in the proto-mitochondrial genome for a longer period than the `glyY` gene.\n\nC. Both `glyY` and `hemZ` are likely to be lost from the proto-mitochondrial genome at approximately the same rate, as genome reduction affects all non-essential genes equally.\n\nD. Both `glyY` and `hemZ` will be invariably retained in the proto-mitochondrial genome because all genes from the original endosymbiont are indispensable for the host.", "solution": "We compare the evolutionary fates of two proto-mitochondrial genes under endosymbiotic gene transfer and reductive evolution, given the host already has a complete cytosolic glycolysis and the endosymbiont uniquely requires Heme-X synthesized by the product of hemZ for its terminal oxidase.\n\nDefine a baseline rate $\\mu$ for mutational loss or transfer to the host nucleus that applies equally to both genes. The effective rate at which a gene is lost from the proto-mitochondrial genome depends not only on $\\mu$ but also on the probability that a loss or transfer event becomes fixed in the population. Denote by $s$ the selection coefficient associated with loss of the organelle-encoded copy (relative to the ancestral state where the organelle-encoded gene is present and functional), and by $p_{\\text{fix}}(s)$ the fixation probability of the loss allele. Then the effective loss rate is\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}=\\mu\\,p_{\\text{fix}}(s).\n$$\nFor a mutation whose loss is effectively neutral, $s\\approx 0$, so $p_{\\text{fix}}(0)$ takes the neutral value (e.g., on the order of $1/N_{\\text{e}}$). For a deleterious loss, $s<0$, so $p_{\\text{fix}}(s)\\ll p_{\\text{fix}}(0)$ under purifying selection, making $\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}$ much smaller.\n\nNow apply this to the two genes:\n- For glyY: The host already encodes and supplies the identical glycolytic function. The organelle’s own glycolytic copy is redundant for cellular fitness under typical conditions because the host can supply ATP and metabolites and because mitochondria in extant eukaryotes generally lack a full glycolysis. Thus, the loss of organelle-encoded glyY is approximately neutral from the host-endosymbiont consortium’s perspective, implying $s_{\\text{glyY}}\\approx 0$ and therefore a relatively large $p_{\\text{fix}}(0)$ and higher $\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}(\\text{glyY})$.\n- For hemZ: The enzyme is required to synthesize Heme-X, an essential cofactor for the endosymbiont’s unique, highly efficient terminal oxidase. The host lacks any capacity to synthesize Heme-X. Loss of hemZ from the organelle genome without an immediate, fully functional replacement (e.g., a successfully transferred and properly targeted nuclear copy) would severely compromise respiration, yielding a strong deleterious effect, so $s_{\\text{hemZ}}<0$ with $|s_{\\text{hemZ}}|$ large. Therefore $p_{\\text{fix}}(s_{\\text{hemZ}})\\ll p_{\\text{fix}}(0)$ and\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}(\\text{hemZ}) \\ll \\lambda_{\\text{eff}}(\\text{glyY}).\n$$\nAdditionally, even if endosymbiotic gene transfer occurs, hemZ function must be maintained within the organelle, requiring correct acquisition of targeting signals and successful import; until such a nuclear-encoded replacement is established, purifying selection will strongly favor retention of an organelle-encoded hemZ. In contrast, glyY does not require such replacement because the host already provides the function, so its organelle copy can be lost by drift and genome reduction.\n\nTherefore, given equal baseline mutation/transfer rates, the essential, unique, organelle-specific function of hemZ causes its effective retention time in the proto-mitochondrial genome to be longer than that of the redundant glyY. This rejects the statements that all non-essential genes are lost equally (C) and that all endosymbiont genes are invariably retained (D). It also rejects A because redundancy accelerates loss relative to uniquely essential, locally needed functions. The most accurate prediction is that hemZ is retained longer than glyY.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2313732"}, {"introduction": "The primary driving force behind the establishment of mitochondria was a profound bioenergetic advantage.
