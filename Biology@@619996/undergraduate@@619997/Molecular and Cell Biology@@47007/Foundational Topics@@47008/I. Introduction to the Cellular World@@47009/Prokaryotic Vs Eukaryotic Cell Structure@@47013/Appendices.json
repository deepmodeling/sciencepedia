By predicting the fate of a bacterial cell and a human red blood cell when exposed to an enzyme that degrades peptidoglycan, you will reinforce your understanding of cell wall composition and its critical role in maintaining cellular integrity.", "problem": "A biologist is investigating the structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. A mixed sample is prepared containing a species of gram-positive bacteria and a population of human Red Blood Cells (RBCs). Both cell types are suspended in an isotonic saline solution, meaning the concentration of solutes in the solution is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cells. An enzyme, peptidoglycan hydrolase, is then introduced into the suspension. This enzyme's sole function is to catalyze the breakdown of peptidoglycan linkages.\n\nAssuming the enzyme has sufficient time to act, which of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of the two cell types in the suspension?\n\nA. Both the gram-positive bacteria and the human RBCs will undergo lysis (burst).\n\nB. The gram-positive bacteria will undergo lysis, while the human RBCs will remain unaffected.\n\nC. The gram-positive bacteria will lose their characteristic shape and become spherical protoplasts, while the human RBCs will remain unaffected.\n\nD. The human RBCs will undergo lysis, while the gram-positive bacteria will remain unaffected.\n\nE. Both the gram-positive bacteria and the human RBCs will shrink and crenate.\n\nF. Neither cell type will be visibly affected by the addition of the enzyme.", "solution": "We are given a mixed suspension of gram-positive bacteria and human RBCs in an isotonic saline solution, and an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes peptidoglycan linkages is added. The key principles are: (i) osmotic balance across membranes in isotonic conditions and (ii) the structural role and specificity of peptidoglycan versus membrane components.\n\nFirst, in an isotonic solution, the osmotic pressures inside and outside the cells are equal. Using the van 't Hoff relation for osmotic pressure, $\\Pi = i c R T$, isotonicity implies equal effective solute concentrations inside and outside each cell type, hence $\\Delta \\Pi = 0$. With $\\Delta \\Pi = 0$, there is no net water flux across a semipermeable membrane, so neither swelling nor shrinkage occurs purely due to osmosis under these conditions.\n\nSecond, peptidoglycan hydrolase catalyzes the cleavage of peptidoglycan linkages. Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan cell wall; thus, the enzyme will degrade their wall. Human RBCs lack peptidoglycan entirely; their boundary is a lipid bilayer with membrane proteins and a spectrin-based cytoskeleton, so the enzyme has no substrate on RBCs and will not affect their structure directly.\n\nThird, when the peptidoglycan wall of gram-positive bacteria is removed, the rigid cell wall that maintains bacterial shape is lost. In the absence of a wall, the bacterial cell becomes a protoplast bounded only by the plasma membrane. In hypotonic solutions, such protoplasts would be prone to osmotic lysis due to $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$ favoring water influx, but here the medium is isotonic, so $\\Delta \\Pi = 0$ and osmotic lysis does not occur. Without the rigid wall, surface tension and minimization of membrane energy lead the protoplast to adopt a spherical shape. Therefore, the bacteria lose their characteristic rod or coccoid wall-defined shapes and become spherical protoplasts but do not lyse in isotonic conditions.\n\nFourth, RBCs in isotonic saline already have $\\Delta \\Pi = 0$ relative to the medium and, lacking peptidoglycan, are unaffected by the hydrolase. They do not lyse or crenate under isotonic conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because isotonic conditions prevent osmotic lysis, and RBCs lack peptidoglycan.\n- B is incorrect because gram-positive bacteria in isotonic medium do not necessarily lyse; they form stable protoplasts.\n- C is correct: the gram-positive bacteria become spherical protoplasts, and RBCs remain unaffected.\n- D and E are incorrect because RBCs in isotonic conditions neither lyse nor crenate.\n- F is incorrect because bacteria are visibly affected by loss of the wall and shape change.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the gram-positive bacteria become spherical protoplasts, while human RBCs remain unaffected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2332115"}, {"introduction": "While the prokaryotic cell is a marvel of efficiency, the evolution of eukaryotes involved a revolutionary new design principle: compartmentalization. This practice [@problem_id:2332097] challenges you to think like a biophysicist and quantify the advantage of confining metabolic pathways within organelles like the mitochondrion. By comparing the diffusion time of a substrate in a simplified prokaryotic versus eukaryotic model, you'll derive a mathematical relationship that reveals how spatial organization dramatically enhances biochemical efficiency.", "problem": "A key advantage of eukaryotic cells is the compartmentalization of metabolic pathways. To quantify this effect, consider a simplified model for a two-step enzymatic reaction, `Substrate -> Product_1 -> Product_2`, catalyzed sequentially by Enzyme 1 and Enzyme 2.\n\nWe wish to compare the efficiency of this pathway in two model cells:\n\n1.  **A prokaryotic cell (Model P):** Modeled as a sphere of radius $R_P$. A total of $N$ copies of Enzyme 1 and $N$ copies of Enzyme 2 are distributed uniformly throughout the entire cytosolic volume.\n2.  **A eukaryotic cell (Model E):** Modeled as a sphere of the same radius $R_P$. It contains a single, spherical mitochondrion of radius $R_M$ located at its center. The same number of enzymes, $N$ copies of each, are confined exclusively within the volume of this mitochondrion.\n\nAssume that the rate-limiting step for the overall pathway is the time it takes for a molecule of `Product_1`, once released from Enzyme 1, to find an active site on an Enzyme 2 molecule via diffusion.

Further, assume that this time $\\tau$ is directly proportional to the square of the average distance between any two enzyme molecules (of either type) within their respective compartments.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the average transit time in the prokaryotic cell, $\\tau_P$, to the average transit time in the eukaryotic mitochondrion, $\\tau_E$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $R_P$ and $R_M$.", "solution": "We are told that the average transit time $\\tau$ is directly proportional to the square of the average distance between enzyme molecules within the compartment where the enzymes reside. For a uniform distribution of particles in a volume, a characteristic interparticle spacing $d$ scales with the number density $n$ as $d \\propto n^{-1/3}$.

To assist in its phylogenetic classification, they have sequenced its genomic DNA (gDNA) and identified a gene of interest, which they have named `thermo-α`. The bioinformatics analysis of the `thermo-α` gene in the gDNA predicts a structure comprising three exons and two introns. The coordinates for these elements are given relative to the start of the gene's transcription start site (position 1).\n\n- Exon 1: Positions 1 to 300\n- Intron 1: Positions 301 to 1100\n- Exon 2: Positions 1101 to 1500\n- Intron 2: Positions 1501 to 2000\n- Exon 3: Positions 2001 to 2500\n\nTo experimentally verify the presence of introns and whether they are removed via messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing, the team decides to use Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). First, they isolate total RNA from the organism and synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from the mature mRNA population. Then, they perform two separate Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) experiments using a single set of primers: one with the organism's gDNA as a template, and the other with the newly synthesized cDNA as a template.\n\nThe forward primer is designed to bind to the sequence starting at position 51 of the gene, and the reverse primer is designed to bind to the complementary strand at a sequence ending at position 2450.\n\nAssuming the bioinformatic prediction is correct and that the `thermo-α` gene is actively transcribed and its pre-mRNA is spliced to remove all introns, calculate the expected sizes of the amplified DNA fragments from both PCR reactions. Provide your answer as two integer values representing the expected product sizes in base pairs for the gDNA and cDNA templates, respectively.", "solution": "We are given genomic coordinates for exons and introns of the gene and primer binding sites. The forward primer binds starting at position 51 on the sense strand; the reverse primer binds to the complementary strand with its binding site ending at position 2450.

The cDNA is the concatenation of Exon 1 (length $300$), Exon 2 (length $400$), and Exon 3 (length $500$). The forward primer site at genomic position $51$ lies in Exon 1, so its cDNA coordinate is $51$. The reverse primer site at genomic position $2450$ lies in Exon 3; within Exon 3 its position is $2450-2001+1=450$.
