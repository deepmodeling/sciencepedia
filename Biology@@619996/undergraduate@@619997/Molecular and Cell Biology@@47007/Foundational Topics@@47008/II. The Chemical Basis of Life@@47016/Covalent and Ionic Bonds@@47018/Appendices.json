The C-N bond is more polar because the electronegativity difference between C and N is greater.\n\nB. The C=O bond is more polar because the electronegativity difference between C and O is greater.\n\nC. The C-N bond and the C=O bond have equal polarity because they both involve the same carbon atom.\n\nD.
