Boiling point is a physical property that is highly dependent on the strength of intermolecular forces between molecules. Based on the principles of secondary bonding, predict which of these two isomers will have a higher boiling point and select the correct reason from the options below.\n\nA. 1-propanol will have a higher boiling point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between its molecules.\n\nB. Methyl ethyl ether will have a higher boiling point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between its molecules.\n\nC. 1-propanol will have a higher boiling point because its more linear shape allows for stronger London dispersion forces.\n\nD. Methyl ethyl ether will have a higher boiling point because its central oxygen atom creates a stronger overall molecular dipole compared to 1-propanol.\n\nE. Both compounds will have nearly identical boiling points because they are isomers and thus have the same molecular weight and elemental composition.", "solution": "We are asked to predict which isomer has the higher boiling point based on secondary bonding (intermolecular forces) and select the matching reason from the options.\n\nFundamental principle: The boiling point increases with the strength and extent of intermolecular attractions; qualitatively, the boiling temperature satisfies $T_{\\text{b}} \\propto E_{\\text{coh}}$, where $E_{\\text{coh}}$ denotes the cohesive intermolecular energy. For molecules of comparable molar mass and size, the relative strengths of the common secondary interactions follow\n$$\nE_{\\text{H-bond}} > E_{\\text{dipole}} > E_{\\text{dispersion}}.\n$$\n\nHydrogen bonding requires a hydrogen covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (typically O, N, or F) to serve as a hydrogen-bond donor, and a lone pair on an electronegative atom to serve as an acceptor. An alcohol functional group $-\\text{OH}$ provides both a donor (the O-H hydrogen) and an acceptor (the oxygen lone pairs), enabling extensive self-association via hydrogen bonding. An ether functional group R-O-R' provides only an acceptor (oxygen lone pairs) but lacks an O-H bond; therefore, ether molecules cannot hydrogen-bond to each other as donors and, among themselves, exhibit only dipole–dipole and London dispersion interactions.\n\nApplying this to the two isomers:\n- 1-propanol contains an $-\\text{OH}$ group and thus engages in intermolecular hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules, contributing a large $E_{\\text{H-bond}}$ component to $E_{\\text{coh}}$ and elevating $T_{\\text{b}}$.\n- Methyl ethyl ether lacks an O-H bond; between ether molecules the dominant interactions are dipole–dipole (from the C-O bond polarity) and London dispersion. These are weaker than hydrogen bonding for molecules of comparable size.\n\nBoth isomers have the same molecular formula (hence similar molar mass) and broadly similar surface areas, so differences in London dispersion due to size/shape are minor relative to the presence versus absence of hydrogen bonding. Any difference in overall molecular dipole does not compensate for the absence of hydrogen bonding in the ether.\n\nTherefore, 1-propanol has the higher boiling point because it can hydrogen-bond to itself. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1330806"}, {"introduction": "The principles of noncovalent interactions are central to understanding the structure and function of biomolecules. This problem situates these concepts in a realistic biological scenario: a single amino acid mutation on a protein's surface [@problem_id:2319120]. By comparing the interaction of a polar serine residue versus a nonpolar valine residue with surrounding water, you will explore the physical basis of the hydrophobic effect and its critical role in protein stability and organization.", "problem": "An enzyme that functions in the aqueous environment of the cell cytoplasm has a serine residue on its solvent-exposed surface. A point mutation occurs in the gene encoding this enzyme, causing this serine residue to be replaced by a valine residue. Both amino acids have side chains of roughly similar size, so steric effects are not the primary concern.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical description of the change in the local interactions between this part of the protein and the surrounding water molecules?\n\nA. The new valine residue is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, which compels the surrounding water to adopt a highly ordered, low-entropy configuration.\n\nB. The original serine residue, being larger than a water molecule, disrupted the hydrogen-bonding network of water. Its replacement by valine allows the surrounding water molecules to become more disordered, resulting in an increase in the entropy of the water.\n\nC. The nonpolar side chain of the new valine residue is unable to participate in hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the surrounding water molecules rearrange to form a highly ordered, cage-like structure around the valine side chain to maximize their hydrogen bonds with each other, leading to a local decrease in the entropy of the water.\n\nD. Both serine and valine side chains primarily interact with water through van der Waals forces. Since their sizes are similar, the mutation leads to a negligible change in the local solvent structure and its associated entropy.\n\nE. The hydrophobic valine side chain actively repels the polar water molecules, creating a small, localized vacuum at the protein surface and thereby increasing the entropy of the bulk water.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the consequences of a mutation that replaces a polar amino acid (serine) with a nonpolar amino acid (valine) on a protein's surface, specifically concerning its interaction with the surrounding water molecules. This requires an understanding of intermolecular forces and the hydrophobic effect.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the properties of the original amino acid, serine.\nThe side chain of serine is $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$. The hydroxyl group $(-\\text{OH})$ is polar due to the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom. This allows the serine side chain to act as both a hydrogen bond donor (via the hydrogen on the hydroxyl group) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (via the lone pairs on the oxygen atom). Because of this capability, a serine residue on the protein surface can integrate favorably into the extensive hydrogen-bonding network of the surrounding liquid water.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the new amino acid, valine.\nThe side chain of valine is $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. This is an isopropyl group, which consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen is very small, making the C-H bonds effectively nonpolar. As a result, the entire valine side chain is nonpolar and hydrophobic. It cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the interaction of the nonpolar valine with water (the hydrophobic effect).\nWater is a highly polar molecule that forms an extensive and dynamic network of hydrogen bonds. When a nonpolar group, like the valine side chain, is exposed to water, it cannot participate in this network. The water molecules at the interface with the nonpolar group cannot form hydrogen bonds with it. To compensate and maximize their bonding stability, these water molecules reorient themselves to form hydrogen bonds exclusively with other neighboring water molecules. This forces them into a more ordered, rigid, cage-like arrangement (often called a clathrate structure) around the nonpolar group.\n\nStep 4: Determine the thermodynamic consequences of this ordering.\nEntropy is a measure of disorder or the number of available microstates. The highly ordered, cage-like structure of water molecules around the valine side chain represents a significant reduction in their translational and rotational freedom compared to bulk water. This increased order corresponds to a decrease in the entropy of the water in that local region. This entropic penalty is the primary thermodynamic basis of the hydrophobic effect.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- Option A is incorrect. Valine is nonpolar and cannot form strong hydrogen bonds with water.\n- Option B is incorrect. The polar serine integrates well with water. It is the nonpolar valine that causes the water to become more ordered, not less. Therefore, the entropy of the water decreases, it does not increase.\n- Option C is correct. It accurately describes that valine is nonpolar, cannot form hydrogen bonds, and thus forces the surrounding water into an ordered, cage-like structure, which constitutes a local decrease in the entropy of the water.\n- Option D is incorrect. While van der Waals forces are present in both cases, the dominant difference is the loss of hydrogen bonding capability. The effect of replacing a polar, hydrogen-bonding group with a nonpolar one is far from negligible and is the central driver of the hydrophobic effect.\n- Option E is incorrect. The concept of \"active repulsion\" is a common misconception. The hydrophobic effect is not driven by a repulsive force between individual nonpolar and polar molecules but rather by the entropic cost of organizing water around the nonpolar solute. No vacuum is formed; the water molecules aperiodically surround the side chain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2319120"}, {"introduction": "To truly master a concept, it is often helpful to consider what happens when a system is pushed to an extreme. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2319080] challenges you to predict the fate of a protein when it is moved from its native aqueous environment to a nonpolar solvent. By analyzing how this drastic change affects the balance of stabilizing forces, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the context-dependent interplay between the hydrophobic effect and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which collectively shape a protein's architecture.", "problem": "A hypothetical globular protein, \"Solubilin-X,\" is perfectly stable and functional in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.0. Its native tertiary structure is characterized by a compact core rich in nonpolar amino acid residues, stabilized primarily by the hydrophobic effect, and a surface rich in polar and charged residues. The protein is carefully isolated from the buffer and transferred into an anhydrous (water-free) nonpolar, aprotic solvent, such as cyclohexane. Assuming the protein's covalent backbone and the ionization state of its residues remain unchanged, which of the following statements best describes the changes in the noncovalent interactions and the likely fate of the protein's overall structure?\n\nA. The protein's tertiary structure will become more compact and stable because the nonpolar solvent molecules will have strong, favorable van der Waals interactions with the protein's nonpolar core.\n\nB. The hydrophobic effect will intensify in the nonpolar solvent, driving the protein to fold even more tightly to completely exclude the nonpolar solvent from its interior.\n\nC. The relative contribution of intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the stability of the structure will decrease, leading to the rapid and complete unfolding of all secondary and tertiary structures.\n\nD. The hydrophobic effect will be eliminated as a major organizing force, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds will become the most significant stabilizing interactions for any residual structure, likely preserving some secondary structure elements even as the overall tertiary fold is lost.\n\nE. Ionic bonds between charged surface residues will be significantly weakened by the low dielectric constant of the nonpolar solvent, causing the protein to expand and denature.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the structural fate of a globular protein when moved from a polar, protic solvent (water) to a nonpolar, aprotic solvent (cyclohexane). We must analyze how the change in solvent affects the key noncovalent forces that stabilize protein structure.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial state in aqueous buffer.\nIn an aqueous environment, the folding of a globular protein like Solubilin-X is primarily driven by the hydrophobic effect. Water molecules form a highly ordered \"cage\" around nonpolar side chains. To maximize the entropy of the solvent (water), these nonpolar side chains are sequestered into the core of the protein, away from the water. This effect is the dominant force that organizes the protein's overall tertiary structure. Other forces, such as hydrogen bonds (stabilizing secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets), van der Waals forces (contributing to packing in the core), and ionic bonds (between charged residues), also play crucial roles.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the new solvent.\nCyclohexane is a nonpolar, aprotic solvent. \"Nonpolar\" means it interacts favorably with other nonpolar molecules (like the side chains of leucine or valine) via London dispersion forces. \"Aprotic\" means its molecules cannot act as hydrogen bond donors.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the change in the hydrophobic effect.\nThe hydrophobic effect is an emergent property of the high ordering of water molecules around nonpolar solutes. Since the new solvent is nonpolar (cyclohexane), there is no entropic penalty for solvating the protein's nonpolar side chains. In fact, these interactions are favorable (like dissolves like). Consequently, the primary driving force for maintaining a compact, folded structure with a nonpolar core is completely eliminated. The protein has no incentive to keep its nonpolar residues buried. This immediately invalidates option B, which incorrectly suggests the hydrophobic effect would intensify.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the role of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.\nIn water, a polypeptide's internal hydrogen bonds (e.g., between a backbone amide proton and a carbonyl oxygen) are in competition with hydrogen bonds to water molecules. If an internal hydrogen bond breaks, the exposed polar groups can form new hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water, mitigating the energetic cost.\nIn a nonpolar, aprotic solvent like cyclohexane, this is not possible. The solvent cannot form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, breaking an internal hydrogen bond and exposing the polar amide and carbonyl groups to the nonpolar solvent is extremely energetically unfavorable. This means that the energetic stability gained from forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond is much greater in the nonpolar solvent than it was in water. The relative contribution of hydrogen bonds to stabilizing local structure *increases* significantly. They become the most important remaining interaction for holding the polypeptide chain together in any ordered fashion. This directly invalidates option C, which claims their contribution will decrease. It strongly supports option D, which states they become the most significant stabilizing interactions for any *residual* structure. While the overall tertiary structure is lost due to the disappearance of the hydrophobic effect, the now-stronger internal hydrogen bonds can preserve secondary structure elements like alpha-helices and beta-sheets.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the role of van der Waals forces and overall compactness.\nWhile there are van der Waals (London dispersion) forces between the protein and the cyclohexane, these forces are weak and non-directional. They provide no impetus for the protein to adopt a specific, compact tertiary structure. The loss of the powerful organizing hydrophobic effect means the protein will likely unravel from its specific native fold into a more disordered state. Therefore, the claim in option A that the protein will become more compact and stable is incorrect.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the role of ionic bonds.\nThe strength of an ionic bond (a type of electrostatic interaction) is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. Water has a very high dielectric constant (around 80), which effectively shields and weakens electrostatic interactions. A nonpolar solvent like cyclohexane has a very low dielectric constant (around 2). Therefore, any ionic bonds between charged residues on the protein would become *much stronger* in cyclohexane, not weaker. This invalidates option E. While these bonds would become stronger, the charged residues are typically on the surface and are now in a highly unfavorable nonpolar environment. They would tend to seek each other out, but this would more likely lead to aggregation of different protein molecules rather than stabilizing the original, native tertiary fold of a single molecule.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\nBased on the analysis, the hydrophobic effect, the main driver of tertiary folding, is lost. This causes the protein to lose its specific tertiary structure. However, intramolecular hydrogen bonds become relatively much stronger and are now the dominant force preserving any local order, such as secondary structures. Option D accurately captures this sequence of events: the elimination of the hydrophobic effect as the organizing force and the increased relative importance of hydrogen bonds in stabilizing residual structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2319080"}]}
