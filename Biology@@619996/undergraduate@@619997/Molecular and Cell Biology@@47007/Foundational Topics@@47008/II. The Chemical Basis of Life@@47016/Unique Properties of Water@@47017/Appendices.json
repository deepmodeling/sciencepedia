This thought experiment [@problem_id:2347041] invites you to explore a hypothetical scenario where water is linear, helping to solidify the crucial link between molecular shape, overall polarity, and the ability to dissolve ionic substances.", "problem": "Water's unique bent geometry, with an H-O-H bond angle of approximately $104.5^\\circ$, is fundamental to its role as the universal solvent of life. This geometry results in a polar molecule capable of dissolving ionic compounds like sodium chloride (NaCl).\n\nConsider a hypothetical universe where water molecules are linear, with an H-O-H bond angle of exactly $180^\\circ$. Assume that the electronegativity difference between oxygen and hydrogen, and therefore the polarity of an individual O-H bond, is identical to that in our universe.\n\nBased on these principles, how would the ability of this hypothetical \"linear water\" to dissolve an ionic salt like NaCl compare to that of normal, bent water?\n\nA. Linear water would be a **superior** solvent because its linear geometry would allow for more ordered and stable hydration shells to form around the ions.\n\nB. The dissolving ability would be **unchanged** because the polarity of the individual O-H bonds, which are responsible for interacting with ions, is the same in both molecular forms.\n\nC. Linear water would be a **much poorer** solvent because the symmetrical arrangement of the polar O-H bonds would cause their individual bond dipoles to cancel, resulting in an overall nonpolar molecule.\n\nD. Linear water would be a **much poorer** solvent because the $180^\\circ$ bond angle would neutralize the electronegativity difference between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, making the O-H bonds themselves nonpolar.\n\nE. The dissolving ability would be **slightly improved** because the linear molecule could more easily penetrate the ionic crystal lattice.", "solution": "The central principle governing the dissolution of ionic compounds is \"like dissolves like.\" Ionic and polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents, while nonpolar solutes dissolve in nonpolar solvents. To answer the question, we must first determine the polarity of the hypothetical linear water molecule and compare it to that of normal, bent water.\n\nA molecule's overall polarity is determined by two factors:\n1.  The polarity of its individual chemical bonds.\n2.  The three-dimensional geometry of the molecule, which determines how the individual bond dipoles sum together.\n\nA bond is polar if there is a significant difference in electronegativity between the two atoms forming the bond. A molecule is polar if the vector sum of all its bond dipoles results in a net molecular dipole moment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Normal (Bent) Water**\nIn a normal water molecule, oxygen is significantly more electronegative than hydrogen. This creates a polar covalent bond (O-H) where the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge ($\\delta^{-}$) and each hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge ($\\delta^{+}$). Each O-H bond has an associated bond dipole moment, a vector pointing from the less electronegative hydrogen to the more electronegative oxygen.\nThe geometry of a normal water molecule is bent, with a bond angle of about $104.5^\\circ$. Because of this non-symmetrical, bent shape, the two O-H bond dipole vectors do not cancel each other out. Their vector sum yields a large, non-zero net molecular dipole moment. This makes normal water a highly polar molecule. This polarity allows it to effectively surround and stabilize ions (e.g., Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$), overcoming the crystal lattice energy of the salt and causing it to dissolve.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Hypothetical (Linear) Water**\nThe problem states that the electronegativity of the atoms and the polarity of the individual O-H bonds are unchanged. Therefore, in the hypothetical linear water molecule, each O-H bond is still polar, with a bond dipole of the same magnitude as in normal water.\nHowever, the geometry is now linear, with a bond angle of $180^\\circ$. This means the two polar O-H bonds are arranged symmetrically, pointing in exactly opposite directions. The two bond dipole vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. As a result, their vector sum is zero.\nA molecule with a zero net dipole moment is nonpolar. Therefore, despite having polar bonds, the hypothetical linear water molecule would be a nonpolar molecule, similar to carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), which also has polar bonds in a linear arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Solvent Abilities**\nSince sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound, it readily dissolves in polar solvents like normal water. It would not, however, dissolve well in a nonpolar solvent. Because the hypothetical linear water is a nonpolar molecule, it would be a very poor solvent for NaCl. It would lack the ability to form effective hydration shells around the Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ ions needed to pull them from the ionic lattice.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options**\n- A is incorrect. A more ordered shell is irrelevant if the fundamental electrostatic attraction required for solvation is absent due to the molecule's nonpolar nature.\n- B is incorrect. This is a common misconception. While the O-H bonds are indeed polar, their symmetrical arrangement in a linear geometry leads to the cancellation of their dipoles, resulting in a nonpolar molecule. Molecular polarity is about the net effect, not just the individual parts.\n- C is correct. It accurately identifies that the linear geometry leads to a cancellation of bond dipoles, resulting in a nonpolar molecule that cannot effectively dissolve ionic compounds.\n- D is incorrect. The bond angle (molecular geometry) does not change the intrinsic electronegativity of the atoms or the polarity of the bonds between them.\n- E is incorrect. Any potential advantage from easier \"penetration\" of the lattice is vastly outweighed by the molecule's inability to electrostatically stabilize the dissociated ions. Polarity is the dominant factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2347041"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of water's polarity, we can explore one of its most important physical consequences: its high dielectric constant.
