The cell membrane, which separates the internal aqueous cytosol from the external aqueous medium, is a phospholipid bilayer. These phospholipid molecules are amphipathic: they possess a polar, hydrophilic \"head\" group (containing phosphate) and two nonpolar, hydrophobic \"tail\" groups (composed of hydrocarbon chains). In water, they spontaneously assemble into a bilayer where the hydrophobic tails are shielded from the water, forming a nonpolar core, while the hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environments on both the inside and outside of the cell.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical single-celled organism, an \"oleophile,\" that has evolved to thrive in an environment consisting entirely of a nonpolar solvent, such as liquid hexane. However, this organism's internal biochemistry is still water-based, meaning its cytosol is an aqueous solution. To survive, the oleophile must maintain a stable membrane that effectively separates its internal polar environment from the external nonpolar environment.\n\nWhich of the following statements most plausibly describes the structure and composition of this organism's cell membrane?\n\nA. A monolayer composed of standard amphipathic lipids, with their hydrophilic heads facing the internal aqueous cytosol and their hydrophobic tails facing the external nonpolar solvent.\n\nB.

A bilayer composed of novel \"anti-amphipathic\" lipids that have nonpolar heads and polar tails, arranged to form a stable barrier.\n\nE. A thick membrane composed of purely nonpolar lipids to form a strong barrier against the internal aqueous environment.", "solution": "The fundamental principle governing the formation of a stable biological membrane is the minimization of thermodynamically unfavorable interactions. This principle is often summarized as \"like dissolves like,\" meaning polar groups preferentially interact with other polar groups, and nonpolar groups with other nonpolar groups. The boundary between a polar and a nonpolar environment is energetically costly. A stable membrane must arrange its constituent molecules to create favorable interactions at both its inner and outer surfaces.\n\nLet's analyze the environments for the hypothetical \"oleophile\" cell:\n- **External Environment:** A nonpolar solvent (hexane). For the membrane to be stable, its outer surface must be nonpolar.\n- **Internal Environment:** An aqueous cytosol. For the membrane to be stable, its inner surface, which faces the cytosol, must be polar.\n\nThe membrane's components must therefore be able to interface with both a polar and a nonpolar environment. This requires the molecules to be **amphipathic**, possessing both polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) regions. Standard phospholipids fit this description.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these principles:\n\n**A. A monolayer composed of standard amphipathic lipids, with their hydrophilic heads facing the internal aqueous cytosol and their hydrophobic tails facing the external nonpolar solvent.**\n- **External Interface:** The hydrophobic tails face the nonpolar solvent. This is a favorable nonpolar-nonpolar interaction.\n- **Internal Interface:** The hydrophilic heads face the polar aqueous cytosol. This is a favorable polar-polar interaction.\n- **Conclusion:** This arrangement creates stable interfaces with both the exterior and interior environments. It forms a continuous, stable barrier separating the two distinct phases. This configuration is the most energetically favorable and plausible solution.\n\n**B. A standard lipid bilayer, identical to that of a terrestrial cell...**\n- **Arrangement:** Hydrophilic heads face outwards, and hydrophobic tails form an inner core.\n- **External Interface:** The hydrophilic heads would be exposed to the nonpolar solvent. This polar-nonpolar interaction is highly unfavorable and would make the membrane unstable.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is not viable.\n\n**C. An \"inverted\" lipid bilayer, where standard amphipathic lipids arrange with their hydrophobic tails facing both the external solvent and the interior cytosol...**\n- **Arrangement:** Hydrophobic tails point towards both the exterior and interior, with hydrophilic heads forming the core of the bilayer.\n- **External Interface:** The hydrophobic tails face the nonpolar solvent. This is a stable interaction.\n- **Internal Interface:** The hydrophobic tails would face the polar aqueous cytosol. This nonpolar-polar interaction is highly unfavorable and would destabilize the membrane.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is not viable.\n\n**D. A bilayer composed of novel \"anti-amphipathic\" lipids that have nonpolar heads and polar tails...**\n- Let's analyze a bilayer made of such molecules. To have a nonpolar outer surface and a polar inner surface, the outer leaflet molecules would need to orient their nonpolar heads outwards, and the inner leaflet molecules would orient their polar tails inwards toward the cytosol. The core of the membrane would then consist of the polar tails of the outer leaflet molecules interacting with the nonpolar heads of the inner leaflet molecules. This polar-nonpolar interface within the core of the membrane would be highly unstable.\n- **Conclusion:** No simple bilayer arrangement of these hypothetical molecules can create a stable membrane under the given conditions.\n\n**E. A thick membrane composed of purely nonpolar lipids...**\n- **Interaction:** Purely nonpolar molecules are fully miscible with the nonpolar hexane solvent. They would not form a distinct, stable boundary separating the cell from its environment. Instead, they would tend to dissolve into the solvent. Furthermore, they cannot form a stable interface with the internal aqueous cytosol.\n- **Conclusion:** This would not form a cohesive membrane.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only structure that satisfies the thermodynamic requirements for stability in both the internal polar and external nonpolar environments is the monolayer described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319283"}, {"introduction": "While the hydrophobic effect explains *why* amphiphilic molecules self-assemble, the geometry of the molecules themselves determines *what* structures they form.

The optimal surface area required by the hydrophilic head group at the interface with water is $a_0$. Finally, the maximum effective length of the hydrophobic section is denoted by $l_c$.

This practice problem [@problem_id:2319267] moves from static structures to the dynamic world of protein trafficking, where a hydrophobic sequence acts as a \"stop\" signal for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation that changes this sequence from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, you can predict the ultimate fate of the protein, illustrating the profound link between a molecule's chemical properties and its biological function.", "problem": "A hypothetical eukaryotic protein, named Anchorin-7, is a single-pass transmembrane protein destined for the plasma membrane. Its synthesis and translocation follow the canonical pathway for Type I transmembrane proteins. Anchorin-7 possesses two key functional domains: an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence (residues 1-20) and a single internal stop-transfer anchor (STA) sequence (residues 150-172). In its wild-type form, the STA sequence is a highly hydrophobic alpha-helix.\n\nA researcher performs site-directed mutagenesis on the gene encoding Anchorin-7. The mutation specifically alters the STA sequence by replacing five core hydrophobic residues (Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine) with five charged residues (two Aspartates and three Lysines), rendering this segment highly hydrophilic. The N-terminal signal sequence and all other parts of the protein remain unchanged.\n\nAssuming the mutated protein can still fold correctly once synthesized and is not subject to any quality control degradation pathways, what is the most probable final cellular location of the mature, mutated form of Anchorin-7 after its synthesis and trafficking?\n\nA. It will be correctly integrated as a single-pass transmembrane protein in the plasma membrane, with its N-terminus in the extracellular space.\n\nB. It will be synthesized completely in the cytosol and remain there as a soluble protein.\n\nC. It will be fully translocated into the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum and subsequently secreted from the cell as a soluble protein.\n\nD. It will be integrated into the plasma membrane as a single-pass transmembrane protein but with an inverted topology (C-terminus in the extracellular space).\n\nE. It will become a peripheral membrane protein, non-covalently associated with the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.", "solution": "The canonical targeting and insertion mechanism for a Type I transmembrane protein begins with an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide that is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the SRP receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The complex is handed off to the Sec61 translocon, translation resumes, and the N-terminal signal peptide directs the nascent chain into the translocon channel. Signal peptidase in the ER lumen cleaves the signal peptide, yielding an N-terminus located in the ER lumen.\n\nIn wild type Anchorin-7, the internal stop-transfer anchor (STA) sequence is a sufficiently hydrophobic alpha-helix. As the ribosome synthesizes this segment, the translocon recognizes its high hydrophobicity, causing two coupled events: translocation across the membrane is halted (stop-transfer), and the helix laterally exits the translocon into the lipid bilayer. This generates the typical Type I topology with the N-terminus luminal and the C-terminus cytosolic.\n\nThe mutation replaces multiple core hydrophobic residues within the STA with charged residues (two Aspartates and three Lysines), making the segment highly hydrophilic. The biophysical and mechanistic consequence is that the mutated segment no longer meets the hydrophobicity threshold required for the Sec61 lateral gate to partition it into the membrane. Therefore, it cannot act as a stop-transfer sequence and will not embed in the bilayer. In the absence of a functional stop-transfer or any other downstream hydrophobic segment capable of serving as a transmembrane domain, the ribosome continues translation and the entire polypeptide is co-translationally translocated through the translocon into the ER lumen.\n\nBecause the N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved, the resulting mature protein lacks any membrane anchor. With no ER retention/retrieval signal (such as KDEL/HDEL) specified, the default itinerary for a soluble protein in the ER lumen is to proceed anterograde through the secretory pathway (ER to Golgi to secretory vesicles) and be secreted to the extracellular space.\n\nEliminating the alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because the mutated segment cannot function as a transmembrane anchor, so correct membrane integration will not occur.\n- Option B is incorrect because the intact N-terminal signal sequence targets the nascent chain to the ER; translation does not complete in the cytosol as a soluble protein.\n- Option D is incorrect because inversion requires an internal signal-anchor that can initiate insertion with a defined orientation; the mutated segment is not sufficiently hydrophobic to serve this role.\n- Option E is unlikely because no specific peripheral membrane-binding determinants are provided; the default outcome without a membrane anchor is solubility in the ER lumen and subsequent secretion.\n\nTherefore, the most probable final location of the mature, mutated Anchorin-7 is as a soluble protein that is secreted from the cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2319267"}]}
