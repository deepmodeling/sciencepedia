This practice problem focuses on Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, a cornerstone principle stating that alleles for different genes segregate independently during the formation of gametes. By working through this trihybrid cross, you will apply the product rule of probability to determine the likelihood of a specific genotype, a fundamental skill essential for genetic analysis and modern applications like genetic engineering.", "problem": "In a genetic engineering experiment with a model plant species, three unlinked genes are being studied. These genes assort independently.\nThe first gene, locus 'A', controls the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), where the dominant allele 'A' enables fluorescence under ultraviolet light, and the recessive allele 'a' does not.\nThe second gene, locus 'B', governs resistance to an antibiotic. The dominant allele 'B' confers resistance, while the recessive allele 'b' results in sensitivity.\nThe third gene, locus 'C', determines leaf texture. The dominant allele 'C' produces crinkled leaves, whereas the recessive allele 'c' results in smooth leaves.\n\nA cross is performed between two parent plants with the following genotypes:\nParent 1: $Aa Bb Cc$\nParent 2: $Aa bb cc$\n\nCalculate the probability of obtaining an offspring with the genotype $aa bb Cc$ from this cross.

This exercise delves into the concept of lethal alleles, where a particular genotype is inviable, leading to altered phenotypic ratios among the surviving offspring. This practice is valuable because it demonstrates how to adjust Mendelian predictions to account for viability selection, offering a more nuanced and realistic understanding of inheritance patterns observed in natural populations.", "problem": "A single autosomal locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ controls a visible trait such that $A$ is completely dominant to $a$ for the trait. However, individuals with genotype $AA$ are inviable due to embryonic lethality, whereas individuals with genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$ are viable and have equal viability. Two heterozygous parents are crossed: $Aa \\times Aa$. Starting from Mendelâ€™s law of segregation (each heterozygote produces $A$ and $a$ gametes with probability $1/2$) and the definition of viability selection (only $AA$ have viability $0$, while $Aa$ and $aa$ have viability $1$), derive the expected zygotic genotype frequencies prior to selection. Then impose the viability constraint and renormalize the surviving classes to obtain the expected phenotypic composition among live offspring. Report, as a single reduced fraction, the proportion of surviving progeny that exhibit the dominant phenotype. Do not use a percent sign; express the final result as a fraction with no additional text.", "solution": "First, we determine the expected genotypic frequencies in the zygotes from the $Aa \\times Aa$ cross. Based on Mendelian segregation, the probabilities of the zygotic genotypes are:\n- $P(AA) = P(A) \\times P(A) = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$\n- $P(Aa) = [P(A) \\times P(a)] + [P(a) \\times P(A)] = (1/2 \\times 1/2) + (1/2 \\times 1/2) = 1/2$\n- $P(aa) = P(a) \\times P(a) = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$\nThe initial zygotic ratio is $1\\,AA : 2\\,Aa : 1\\,aa$.\n\nNext, we apply the viability selection. The genotype $AA$ is inviable (viability = 0), while $Aa$ and $aa$ are fully viable (viability = 1).\n- The proportion of surviving $AA$ is $(1/4) \\times 0 = 0$.\n- The proportion of surviving $Aa$ is $(1/2) \\times 1 = 1/2$.\n- The proportion of surviving $aa$ is $(1/4) \\times 1 = 1/4$.\n\nThe total proportion of the population that survives is the sum of these proportions: $0 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4$.\n\nTo find the frequencies among the live offspring, we renormalize the surviving proportions by dividing by the total survival proportion ($3/4$):\n- Frequency of $Aa$ among survivors = $\\frac{1/2}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n- Frequency of $aa$ among survivors = $\\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe resulting genotypic ratio among live offspring is $2\\,Aa : 1\\,aa$.\n\nFinally, we determine the phenotypic ratio. Since $A$ is completely dominant to $a$, individuals with genotype $Aa$ show the dominant phenotype, and individuals with genotype $aa$ show the recessive phenotype. Therefore, the proportion of surviving progeny that exhibit the dominant phenotype is equal to the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype, which is $2/3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "2953576"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond independently assorting genes, this problem challenges you to explore the phenomenon of genetic linkage, where genes located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together.
