Therefore, the contribution of $FADH_2$ to the ATP total becomes zero.\nThe toxin does not affect the production or utilization of NADH, which donates its electrons to Complex I. It also does not affect substrate-level phosphorylation, so the GTP is still produced and is equivalent to 1 ATP.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the new ATP yield in the presence of the toxin.**\nWe now recalculate the total ATP yield, accounting for the effect of Complexin-F.\n- ATP from 3 NADH: The pathway for NADH is unaffected.
