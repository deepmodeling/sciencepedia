This rate is defined as the change in product concentration per unit time at the beginning of the reaction, where the relationship between time and product formation is approximately linear.\n\nFirst, we need to relate the measured absorbance ($A$) to the concentration ($c$) of the yellow Product Y. This is done using the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the molar extinction coefficient and $l$ is the path length of the cuvette.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of Product Y:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\n\nThe rate of the reaction, $v$, is the change in concentration over the change in time, $\\Delta c / \\Delta t$. The initial rate, $v_0$, is this rate measured during the initial, linear phase of the reaction.\n$$v_0 = \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta(A/(\\epsilon l))}{\\Delta t}$$\nSince $\\epsilon$ and $l$ are constants, we can write:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon l} \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}$ represents the slope of the absorbance versus time graph. We must first identify the linear portion of the provided data to calculate this initial slope.\n\nLet's examine the data points:\n- From t=0 s to t=20 s: $\\Delta A = 0.110 - 0.000 = 0.110$.

Rate of change = $0.110 / 20 = 0.00550 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- From t=40 s to t=60 s: $\\Delta A = 0.330 - 0.220 = 0.110$. Rate of change = $0.110 / 20 = 0.00550 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- From t=60 s to t=80 s: $\\Delta A = 0.400 - 0.330 = 0.070$. Rate of change = $0.070 / 20 = 0.00350 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe rate of absorbance change is constant for the first 60 seconds and then begins to decrease. Therefore, the initial linear phase of the reaction occurs from t=0 s to t=60 s. We can use any two points in this range to calculate the slope, $\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}$.
