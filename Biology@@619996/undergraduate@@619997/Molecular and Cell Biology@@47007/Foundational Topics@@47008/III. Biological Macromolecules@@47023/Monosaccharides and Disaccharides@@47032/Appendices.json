This exercise challenges you to perform a fundamental skill in carbohydrate chemistry: translating a 2D Fischer projection into a 3D Haworth projection. By analyzing the resulting stereochemical relationships in cyclic D-lyxose, you will gain a deeper intuition for the spatial arrangements that govern how sugars interact with enzymes and receptors ([@problem_id:2325475]).", "problem": "The aldopentose D-lyxose is a monosaccharide found in mycobacterial cell walls. Its open-chain structure is defined by a five-carbon backbone, with an aldehyde at carbon C1 and a primary alcohol at C5. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers in its Fischer projection is as follows: the hydroxyl group on C2 is on the left, the hydroxyl group on C3 is on the left, and the hydroxyl group on C4 is on the right.\n\nIn aqueous solution, D-lyxose undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form a stable five-membered ring structure known as a furanose. This occurs when the hydroxyl group on C4 attacks the carbonyl carbon C1, forming a hemiacetal. A new chiral center, the anomeric carbon, is created at C1. In the β-anomer, the newly formed hydroxyl group on C1 is positioned on the same face of the ring as the terminal hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) group attached to C4.\n\nA *cis* relationship between substituents on adjacent carbons in the ring exists if they are on the same side of the ring's plane (i.e., both 'up' or both 'down' in a standard Haworth projection). Your task is to analyze the structure of β-D-lyxofuranose.

This practice explores the crucial concept of \"reducing\" versus \"non-reducing\" sugars, a property determined by the structure of the glycosidic bond. By examining the unique linkage in the disaccharide trehalose, you will learn how molecular structure dictates chemical reactivity and, consequently, its biological role in energy storage ([@problem_id:2325469]).", "problem": "Trehalose is a disaccharide that serves as a primary energy source and cryoprotectant in the hemolymph of insects. Structurally, trehalose is composed of two $\\alpha$-D-glucose units. A key feature of its structure is that the two glucose units are joined by a glycosidic bond between their respective anomeric carbons (carbon-1). A reducing sugar is defined as a carbohydrate that possesses a free hemiacetal group, allowing it to open into a chain form with a free aldehyde or ketone group, which can then act as a reducing agent.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the chemical properties of trehalose?\n\nA. Trehalose is a reducing sugar because its constituent monosaccharide, glucose, is a reducing sugar.\n\nB. Trehalose is a reducing sugar because the glycosidic bond can be hydrolyzed under test conditions, freeing an anomeric carbon.\n\nC. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar because both anomeric carbons are involved in the glycosidic bond, leaving no free hemiacetal group.\n\nD. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar because disaccharides formed from $\\alpha$-anomers are inherently non-reducing, unlike those from $\\beta$-anomers.", "solution": "A reducing sugar is defined as a carbohydrate that contains a free hemiacetal (for aldoses) or hemiketal (for ketoses) at its anomeric carbon. This free hemiacetal can undergo ring opening to generate a reactive carbonyl group capable of reducing mild oxidants (e.g., converting Cu^{2+} to Cu^{+} in Benedict's or Fehling's solutions). In disaccharides, the reducing property depends on whether at least one anomeric carbon remains free (hemiacetal) or whether both anomeric carbons are tied up as full acetals in glycosidic bonds.\n\nTrehalose consists of two $\\alpha$-D-glucose units linked via a 1,1-$\\alpha$,$\\alpha$-glycosidic bond between their respective anomeric carbons. Formation of a glycosidic bond at an anomeric carbon converts a hemiacetal into an acetal. Because in trehalose both anomeric carbons are engaged in acetal linkages, neither glucose unit retains a free hemiacetal. Therefore, trehalose cannot undergo ring opening to produce a free carbonyl under standard test conditions and is non-reducing.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: although glucose is a reducing monosaccharide, whether a disaccharide is reducing depends on the presence of a free anomeric carbon in the disaccharide, not on the properties of the constituent monosaccharides. For example, sucrose is non-reducing despite being composed of two reducing monosaccharides.\n- B is incorrect: standard reducing sugar tests do not rely on hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds during the assay; the molecule must already have a free hemiacetal. While trehalose can be hydrolyzed under separate, more stringent conditions to yield reducing monosaccharides, that does not make trehalose itself a reducing sugar.\n- C is correct: both anomeric carbons are involved in the glycosidic bond, leaving no free hemiacetal group; hence trehalose is non-reducing.\n- D is incorrect: the reducing character is determined by whether an anomeric carbon is free, not by whether the linkage involves $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ anomers.
