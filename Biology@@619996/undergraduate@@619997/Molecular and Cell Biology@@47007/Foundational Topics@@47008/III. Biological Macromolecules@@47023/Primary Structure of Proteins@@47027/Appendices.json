Solving this puzzle will strengthen your logical reasoning and provide insight into the elegant strategies used to unravel the first protein sequences.", "problem": "A biochemist isolates a pure sample of a hexapeptide involved in a novel signaling pathway. Amino acid analysis reveals its composition to be one residue each of Alanine (A), Glycine (G), Leucine (L), Phenylalanine (F), Lysine (K), and Valine (V). To determine its primary structure, two separate enzymatic digestion experiments are performed.\n\n**Experiment 1: Trypsin Digestion**\nThe hexapeptide is treated with trypsin. Trypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of positively charged residues, namely Lysine (K) and Arginine (R), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion results in the formation of two smaller peptide fragments: a dipeptide and a tetrapeptide. The sequences of these fragments are determined to be Ala-Leu and Val-Gly-Phe-Lys.\n\n**Experiment 2: Chymotrypsin Digestion**\nA separate sample of the original hexapeptide is treated with chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin is a protease that cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of large aromatic residues, such as Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W), and Tyrosine (Y), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion also yields two fragments, both of which are tripeptides. Their sequences are determined to be Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nBased on these results, deduce the complete primary sequence of the original hexapeptide. Express your answer as a continuous string of one-letter amino acid codes, representing the sequence from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.", "solution": "We are given a hexapeptide containing the residues A, G, L, F, K, and V, one each. The trypsin digestion produces two peptides: a dipeptide Ala-Leu and a tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys. Since trypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Lys, the fragment that ends in Lys must be the N-terminal fragment containing the Lys at its C-terminus. Therefore, the tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys must be the N-terminal portion. The remaining dipeptide Ala-Leu must be the C-terminal portion that follows the cleavage site. Hence, the intact sequence consistent with trypsin cleavage is\nVal-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nTo confirm, we use the chymotrypsin result. Chymotrypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Phe. In the sequence Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu, cleavage after Phe yields two tripeptides: Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu, which exactly match the observed fragments. This consistency confirms that the unique primary sequence is Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nExpressed in one-letter codes from N-terminus to C-terminus, the sequence is VGFKAL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{VGFKAL}$$", "id": "2064548"}, {"introduction": "While classic sequencing methods are powerful, they have limitations. For instance, they cannot easily distinguish between isobaric amino acids like Leucine ($L$) and Isoleucine ($I$), which have identical masses. This is where modern proteomics techniques like tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) become indispensable. In this advanced exercise [@problem_id:2125174], you will interpret hypothetical MS/MS data to resolve such an ambiguity, gaining a deeper appreciation for the analytical power behind contemporary protein science.", "problem": "A biochemist is determining the primary structure of a small, purified pentapeptide. Amino acid analysis reveals its composition to be Glycine (G), Alanine (A), Valine (V), Lysine (K), and one residue 'X' which is known to be either Leucine (L) or its isobaric isomer, Isoleucine (I). The N-terminal sequence was determined to be `G-A-V-...`. The full sequence is therefore `G-A-V-X-K`.\n\nTo resolve the identity of residue 'X', the peptide is analyzed using tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). The singly charged precursor ion is isolated and subjected to low-energy Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID). This fragmentation technique primarily cleaves the peptide backbone to produce a series of fragment ions, including N-terminal `b`-ions and C-terminal `y`-ions. Specialized fragmentation of the amino acid side chains can also occur, which is key to differentiating L and I.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following fragmentation rule holds true for `a`-type ions (which are formed by the loss of a carbonyl group, CO, from `b`-ions):\n- An `$a_n$` ion containing a Leucine residue can undergo a characteristic secondary fragmentation involving a neutral loss of propene ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6$).\n- An `$a_n$` ion containing an Isoleucine residue can undergo a similar fragmentation involving a neutral loss of ethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$).\n\nThe experimental MS/MS spectrum shows a prominent `$a_4$` ion.
