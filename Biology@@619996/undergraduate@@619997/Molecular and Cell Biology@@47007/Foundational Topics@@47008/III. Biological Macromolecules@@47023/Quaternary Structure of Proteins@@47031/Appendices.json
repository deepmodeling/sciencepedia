This exercise introduces the power of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as a tool to distinguish between non-covalent interactions and covalent disulfide bonds. By comparing results under reducing and non-reducing conditions, you can deduce the precise way in which subunits are assembled, as demonstrated in this classic scenario [@problem_id:2334500].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is characterizing a newly discovered protein named Signal Transduction Scaffold 1 (STS1). To investigate its subunit composition, the biologist performs Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under two different conditions.\n\nIn the first experiment (non-reducing conditions), a pure sample of STS1 is treated with SDS and then loaded onto the gel. This results in the observation of a single, distinct band corresponding to a molecular weight of $220 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\nIn the second experiment (reducing conditions), another sample of pure STS1 is treated with SDS and a powerful reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), before being loaded onto the gel. This experiment also results in a single, distinct band, but this time it corresponds to a molecular weight of $110 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the quaternary structure of the native STS1 protein?\n\nA. STS1 is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 220 kDa that is susceptible to cleavage by DTT.\nB. STS1 is a homodimer composed of two identical 110 kDa subunits held together exclusively by non-covalent interactions.\nC. STS1 is a tetramer composed of four identical 55 kDa subunits, where pairs of subunits are linked by disulfide bonds.\nD. STS1 is a homodimer composed of two identical 110 kDa subunits linked together by one or more disulfide bonds.\nE. STS1 is a heterodimer composed of a 110 kDa subunit and a second, different 110 kDa subunit, linked non-covalently.", "solution": "SDS-PAGE principle: SDS denatures proteins and disrupts non-covalent interactions while imparting an approximately uniform charge-to-mass ratio, so migration reflects molecular mass. Under non-reducing conditions, disulfide bonds remain intact; under reducing conditions (e.g., with DTT), disulfide bonds are cleaved to free thiols.\n\nObservation 1 (non-reducing): A pure STS1 sample treated with SDS (no DTT) gives a single band at $220\\ \\text{kDa}$. Because SDS disrupts non-covalent interactions, any multimer observed under non-reducing conditions must be held together by covalent disulfide bonds. The single band at $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ thus represents the intact, disulfide-linked assembly.\n\nObservation 2 (reducing): A pure STS1 sample treated with SDS and DTT gives a single band at $110\\ \\text{kDa}$. Reduction breaks disulfide bonds, so the observed band corresponds to the mass of the individual subunit(s). The fact that there is a single band implies that all constituent subunits have the same mass, namely $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ (i.e., a homomer).\n\nInference from the mass shift: The transition from $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ (non-reducing) to $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ (reducing) indicates that the native assembly is composed of two identical $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits linked by one or more disulfide bonds, summing to $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ when the disulfide linkage is intact.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A: DTT does not cleave peptide backbones; a monomer of $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ would not become $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ upon reduction. Therefore A is incorrect.\n- B: If subunits were held exclusively by non-covalent interactions, SDS alone would dissociate them even without DTT, yielding $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ under non-reducing conditions, not $220\\ \\text{kDa}$. Therefore B is incorrect.\n- C: A tetramer of $55\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits with disulfide-linked pairs would give $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ under non-reducing conditions (disulfide-linked dimers) and $55\\ \\text{kDa}$ under reducing conditions, which is not observed. Therefore C is incorrect.\n- E: A non-covalent heterodimer would dissociate with SDS under non-reducing conditions, yielding separate bands for distinct subunits; also the observed single $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ band argues against heterogeneity. Therefore E is incorrect.\n\nThus, the data are best explained by a disulfide-linked homodimer of two $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2334500"}, {"introduction": "Biochemical investigations often resemble detective work, where clues from multiple experiments must be integrated to form a coherent picture. This problem challenges you to synthesize data from size-exclusion chromatography, non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and reducing SDS-PAGE to unravel the complex quaternary structure of a hypothetical protein.

To determine its subunit composition and quaternary structure, a series of experiments are conducted. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC):** When the native, fully folded Quartase is analyzed by SEC, it elutes as a single peak corresponding to a molecular weight of $240 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\n2.  **SDS-PAGE (Non-reducing):** An aliquot of Quartase is treated with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) but without any reducing agent. When this sample is run on a Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) gel, two distinct bands are observed. These bands correspond to molecular weights of $160 \\text{ kDa}$ and $80 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\n3.  **SDS-PAGE (Reducing):** Another aliquot of Quartase is treated with SDS and a strong reducing agent, Î²-mercaptoethanol. When this sample is analyzed by SDS-PAGE, two bands are again observed, but this time at molecular weights of $80 \\text{ kDa}$ and $40 \\text{ kDa}$. A densitometry scan of this gel indicates that the total mass of protein contained within the 40 kDa band is twice the total mass of protein contained within the 80 kDa band.\n\nBased on this complete set of experimental data, determine the correct subunit composition of a single native Quartase molecule.\n\nA. Two 80 kDa subunits and two 40 kDa subunits.\nB. Three 80 kDa subunits.\nC. One 80 kDa subunit and four 40 kDa subunits.\nD. Six 40 kDa subunits.\nE.

Therefore, the native Quartase has total mass\n$$M_{\\text{native}}=240\\ \\text{kDa}.$$\n\nSDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions denatures noncovalent quaternary interactions while retaining disulfide bonds. The observation of two bands at $160 \\text{ kDa}$ and $80 \\text{ kDa}$ implies that, upon denaturation without reduction, the covalently linked (disulfide-bonded) units resolve into one species of $160 \\text{ kDa}$ and one species of $80 \\text{ kDa}$. Their masses sum to the native mass, consistent with a complex composed of a disulfide-linked block of $160 \\text{ kDa}$ and an $80 \\text{ kDa}$ unit that is not disulfide-linked to the $160 \\text{ kDa}$ block.\n\nSDS-PAGE under reducing conditions breaks disulfide bonds, so the analysis reveals the true polypeptide subunit masses. The appearance of bands at $80 \\text{ kDa}$ and $40 \\text{ kDa}$ shows that the fundamental subunits are $80 \\text{ kDa}$ and $40 \\text{ kDa}$ polypeptides. Let $n_{80}$ be the number of $80 \\text{ kDa}$ subunits per native complex and $n_{40}$ be the number of $40 \\text{ kDa}$ subunits per native complex. Mass conservation from SEC gives\n$$80\\,n_{80}+40\\,n_{40}=240.$$\nDensitometry indicates that the total mass in the $40 \\text{ kDa}$ band is twice the total mass in the $80 \\text{ kDa}$ band. Since band intensity is proportional to total protein mass in that band, this yields\n$$40\\,n_{40}=2\\cdot 80\\,n_{80},$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$n_{40}=4\\,n_{80}.$$\nSubstituting into the mass equation,\n$$80\\,n_{80}+40\\,(4\\,n_{80})=240 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 80\\,n_{80}+160\\,n_{80}=240 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 240\\,n_{80}=240 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; n_{80}=1,$$\nand therefore\n$$n_{40}=4.$$\n\nThus the native complex contains one $80 \\text{ kDa}$ subunit and four $40 \\text{ kDa}$ subunits, with a total mass $80\\times 1+40\\times 4=240$ kDa. Under non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the four $40 \\text{ kDa}$ subunits are consistent with forming a disulfide-linked $160 \\text{ kDa}$ species, while the $80 \\text{ kDa}$ subunit remains separate, giving the observed $160 \\text{ kDa}$ and $80 \\text{ kDa}$ bands. Under reducing conditions, disulfide bonds are cleaved, yielding the $80 \\text{ kDa}$ and $40 \\text{ kDa}$ bands with a two-to-one total mass ratio in agreement with the densitometry.
