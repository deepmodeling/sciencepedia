Coconut oil has $f_{\\text{sat}} \\approx 0.87$ but its most abundant saturated fatty acid is lauric acid $C_{12:0}$; although highly saturated (which increases $T_{m}$), the shorter average chain length lowers $T_{m}$ relative to fats dominated by longer saturated chains.\n\nBalancing these effects, olive oil has the lowest $T_{m}$ due to low $f_{\\text{sat}}$, butter has the highest $T_{m}$ due to substantial long-chain saturation, and coconut oil lies between them because its high saturation is tempered by shorter chain length.
