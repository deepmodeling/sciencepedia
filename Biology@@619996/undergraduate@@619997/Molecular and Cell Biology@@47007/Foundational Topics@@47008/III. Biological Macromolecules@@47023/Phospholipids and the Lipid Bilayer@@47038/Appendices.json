This exercise challenges you to apply the concept of amphipathicity to a novel environment: a nonpolar solvent. By predicting the structure phospholipids will form in oil, you will solidify your understanding of how interactions between molecules and their solvent drive self-assembly, moving beyond simple memorization to genuine conceptual insight [@problem_id:2329733].", "problem": "Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules, meaning they possess both a hydrophilic (water-loving) and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) region. The hydrophilic region consists of a polar phosphate-containing \"head group,\" while the hydrophobic region consists of two nonpolar fatty acid \"tails.\" In an aqueous environment, these molecules spontaneously self-assemble into structures like micelles or lipid bilayers, which minimize the unfavorable interaction between the hydrophobic tails and water.\n\nConsider a scenario where a large number of phospholipid molecules are dispersed into a volume of a completely nonpolar solvent, such as oil, and are allowed to reach their most energetically favorable configuration. Which of the following structures is most likely to form?\n\nA. A standard lipid bilayer, with the hydrophobic tails of two layers facing each other and the hydrophilic heads exposed to the oil.\n\nB.

The hydrophobic effect and solvent compatibility dictate that hydrophobic tails are stabilized by contact with the nonpolar solvent, while hydrophilic head groups experience unfavorable interactions with the nonpolar solvent.\n\nThe system tends to minimize the Gibbs free energy, with a dominant contribution from the interfacial free energy between polar head groups and nonpolar solvent. Denoting the interfacial tension between head groups and oil by $\\gamma_{ho}$ and the total area of head group surface exposed to oil by $A_{h}$, the interfacial free energy contribution scales as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{interface}} \\approx \\gamma_{ho} A_{h}.\n$$\nThus, minimizing $\\Delta G_{\\text{interface}}$ requires minimizing $A_{h}$, i.e., reducing the exposure of hydrophilic head groups to the nonpolar solvent. Simultaneously, the hydrophobic tails prefer maximal contact with the oil, so structures that expose tails to the solvent are enthalpically favorable.\n\nWe evaluate the proposed structures:\n\n- Option A (standard bilayer with heads exposed to oil) is unfavorable because it exposes hydrophilic heads to oil (large $A_{h}$) and sequesters hydrophobic tails from oil, which both increase free energy.\n\n- Option B (reverse micelle) encloses the hydrophilic head groups in the interior, greatly reducing $A_{h}$, while the hydrophobic tails extend outward into the oil, maximizing favorable tail-oil interactions. This minimizes $\\Delta G$.\n\n- Option C (standard micelle) hides tails from oil and exposes heads to oil, which is energetically unfavorable in a nonpolar solvent.\n\n- Option D (complete dissociation) maximizes head-oil contact area $A_{h}$ and is therefore highly unfavorable.\n\n- Option E (flat monolayer sheet suspended in oil) leaves a large area of head groups in contact with oil and also incurs edge energy. The edge energy scales with the perimeter $L$ as\n$$\nE_{\\text{edge}} \\approx \\lambda L,\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the line tension; such a sheet would spontaneously curve and close to eliminate edges and head exposure, forming reverse micelles or related closed structures.\n\nTherefore, the most favorable structure in a nonpolar solvent is the reverse micelle: hydrophilic heads sequestered in the core and hydrophobic tails interfacing with the oil.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2329733"}, {"introduction": "Now that we understand why bilayers form, we can explore how their properties are tuned by their molecular components. The fluidity of a cell membrane is not constant; it depends critically on the chemical structure of its constituent phospholipids. This practice problem explores the link between fatty acid saturation, membrane fluidity, and a key membrane function: its permeability to water [@problem_id:2329714]. You will compare two hypothetical liposomes to see why the difference between saturated and unsaturated tails is so crucial for the physical state of the membrane.", "problem": "A researcher investigates the passive transport of water across different types of biological membranes. Two distinct populations of liposomes (spherical artificial vesicles) are synthesized.\n\nPopulation A is composed exclusively of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), a phospholipid with two saturated 16-carbon fatty acid tails. The phase transition temperature (Tm), at which this lipid bilayer transitions from a gel-like state to a fluid state, is approximately 41째C.\n\nPopulation B is composed exclusively of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), a phospholipid with two 18-carbon fatty acid tails, each containing a single *cis*-double bond. The Tm for this lipid bilayer is approximately -17째C.\n\nBoth populations of liposomes are initially formed and equilibrated in an isotonic buffer solution. Subsequently, they are simultaneously transferred into a large volume of pure, deionized water (a hypotonic solution) at a constant laboratory temperature of 25째C. The rate of water influx is inferred by measuring the initial rate of liposome swelling.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly predicts the experimental outcome and provides the most accurate biophysical explanation?\n\nA. Liposome A will swell faster because its tightly packed, saturated tails form stable, well-defined pores for water passage.\n\nB. Liposome B will swell faster because the longer 18-carbon tails of its phospholipids create a larger surface area for diffusion.\n\nC. Liposome B will swell faster because the *cis*-double bonds in its unsaturated tails prevent tight packing, increasing membrane fluidity and the frequency of transient gaps for water molecules to pass through.\n\nD. Liposome A will swell faster because its gel-phase state at 25째C is inherently more porous to small molecules than the liquid-phase state of Liposome B.\n\nE. Both populations will swell at the same rate because the osmotic gradient driving water influx is identical for both.", "solution": "Define $T_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ as the laboratory temperature and $T_{m}^{(A)}$, $T_{m}^{(B)}$ as the phase transition temperatures of populations A and B, respectively. The given conditions imply\n$$T_{\\mathrm{lab}} < T_{m}^{(A)}, \\quad T_{\\mathrm{lab}} > T_{m}^{(B)}.$$\nTherefore, at $T_{\\mathrm{lab}}$, liposome A (DPPC) is in the gel (solid-ordered) phase, while liposome B (DOPC) is in the liquid-disordered (fluid) phase.\n\nWhen both liposome populations, initially equilibrated in an isotonic buffer, are transferred to pure water (hypotonic), water influx is driven by an osmotic pressure difference. The volumetric flux of water across a membrane can be written as\n$$J_{v} = L_{p}\\,\\Delta \\Pi,$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic permeability (a property of the membrane) and $\\Delta \\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane. For dilute solutions,\n$$\\Delta \\Pi = R T_{\\mathrm{lab}}\\,\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{osm}},$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant and $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ is the osmolarity difference between inside and outside. Since both populations have the same internal composition and are placed in the same external pure water, they have the same $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ and the same $T_{\\mathrm{lab}}$. Therefore,\n$$\\Delta \\Pi^{(A)} = \\Delta \\Pi^{(B)},$$\nand any difference in initial swelling rate (which reflects $J_{v}$) must arise from differences in $L_{p}$:\n$$J_{v}^{(A)} = L_{p}^{(A)}\\,\\Delta \\Pi,\\quad J_{v}^{(B)} = L_{p}^{(B)}\\,\\Delta \\Pi.$$\n\nThe hydraulic permeability $L_{p}$ (and equivalently the water permeability $P_{w}$) depends on membrane structure and fluidity. Biophysically:\n- Saturated lipid tails (as in DPPC) pack tightly, reducing free volume and suppressing transient defects; in the gel phase this tight packing is maximized, yielding smaller $L_{p}$.\n- Unsaturated tails with cis double bonds (as in DOPC) introduce kinks, prevent tight packing, increase area per lipid, and lower $T_{m}$, placing the bilayer in the fluid phase at $T_{\\mathrm{lab}}$. The increased disorder and free volume increase the frequency of transient gaps through which small molecules like water can permeate, yielding larger $L_{p}$.\n\nThus,\n$$L_{p}^{(B)} > L_{p}^{(A)} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad J_{v}^{(B)} > J_{v}^{(A)}.$$\nTherefore, liposome B will swell faster.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: saturated, tightly packed gel-phase membranes do not form stable pores; they are less permeable.\n- B predicts the correct direction but offers an incorrect explanation: tail length per se does not increase water permeability; increased thickness typically reduces permeability, and the dominant factor here is unsaturation and phase state.\n- C is correct: cis double bonds disrupt packing, increase fluidity, and enhance transient gaps, increasing permeability and swelling rate.\n- D is incorrect: the gel phase is less, not more, permeable than the liquid-disordered phase.\n- E is incorrect: although $\\Delta \\Pi$ is the same, different $L_{p}$ values lead to different initial rates.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2329714"}, {"introduction": "A pure lipid bilayer provides a stable, flexible barrier, but a living cell membrane is far more than a simple container; it is a dynamic, selective gateway.
