His discovery of consistent patterns in the base composition of double-stranded DNA became known as Chargaff's rules. This practice [@problem_id:2315420] provides a foundational exercise in applying these rules, which state that the amount of adenine ($A$) is equal to thymine ($T$), and the amount of guanine ($G$) is equal to cytosine ($C$). Mastering this simple calculation is the first step toward understanding the chemical logic of the double helix.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is sequencing the genome of a newly isolated bacterial species. They determine that the genetic material is a single, circular, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecule. After fragmenting the DNA and performing a base composition analysis, they find that cytosine accounts for 18% of the total nitrogenous bases in the sample. Assuming the standard model of DNA structure holds for this organism, what proportion of the bases in its genome is adenine?\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal value.", "solution": "Let the genomic base fractions be $f_{A}, f_{T}, f_{C}, f_{G}$ with the normalization condition $f_{A} + f_{T} + f_{C} + f_{G} = 1$. For standard double-stranded DNA, Chargaff’s rules apply: $f_{A} = f_{T}$ and $f_{C} = f_{G}$. Given that cytosine accounts for $0.18$ of all bases, we have $f_{C} = 0.18$, hence $f_{G} = 0.18$, so\n$$\nf_{C} + f_{G} = 2 f_{C} = 0.36.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nf_{A} + f_{T} = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64,\n$$\nand since $f_{A} = f_{T}$,\n$$\nf_{A} = \\frac{0.64}{2} = 0.32.\n$$\nThus, the proportion of adenine is $0.32$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.32}$$", "id": "2315420"}, {"introduction": "Scientific discovery often involves analyzing data from an unknown sample and making logical inferences about its nature.

It's a classic example of how fundamental principles are used to unravel biological mysteries.", "problem": "A team of astrobiologists analyzing samples from a subsurface ocean on one of Jupiter's moons has discovered a novel virus-like particle. The genetic material of this particle has been isolated. Initial enzymatic assays confirm that the molecule is a form of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). A quantitative base composition analysis was performed on a purified sample of this DNA, yielding the following molar percentages of the nitrogenous bases:\n- Adenine (A): 21.5%\n- Guanine (G): 38.5%\n- Cytosine (C): 18.0%\n- Thymine (T): 22.0%\n\nBased on these results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate inference about the structure of the genetic material in this extraterrestrial particle?\n\nA. The genetic material is a double-stranded DNA molecule.\n\nB. The genetic material is a single-stranded DNA molecule.\n\nC. The genetic material is a double-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecule.\n\nD. The composition analysis is flawed, as the percentages of Guanine and Cytosine must be equal in any DNA molecule.\n\nE. The genetic material is likely a hybrid molecule composed of one DNA strand and one RNA strand.", "solution": "Define the observed molar base fractions as $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.215$, $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=0.385$, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}=0.18$, and $f_{\\mathrm{T}}=0.22$. Note that the total is\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{A}}+f_{\\mathrm{G}}+f_{\\mathrm{C}}+f_{\\mathrm{T}}=0.215+0.385+0.18+0.22=1,\n$$\nso the compositional analysis is internally consistent.\n\nPhysical principle (Chargaff’s rules for double-stranded DNA): In canonical Watson–Crick base-paired, double-stranded DNA, hydrogen bonding imposes base-pairing constraints yielding\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{T}}, \\quad f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}.\n$$\nApplying this to the data:\n- For adenine and thymine, $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.215$ and $f_{\\mathrm{T}}=0.22$, so $f_{\\mathrm{A}}\\approx f_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n- For guanine and cytosine, $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=0.385$ and $f_{\\mathrm{C}}=0.18$, so\n$$\n|f_{\\mathrm{G}}-f_{\\mathrm{C}}|=0.385-0.18=0.205,\n$$\nwhich is a large deviation and violates $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}$ required for double-stranded DNA.\n\nTherefore, the data are inconsistent with a double-stranded DNA molecule, ruling out option A. The same constraint $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}$ applies to double-stranded RNA (with $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{U}}$ rather than $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{T}}$), and moreover RNA contains uracil rather than thymine; the enzymatic assays identified DNA and the composition includes thymine, so option C is incompatible.\n\nRegarding option D, the statement that guanine and cytosine percentages must be equal in any DNA molecule is false: this equality is required only for double-stranded DNA. Single-stranded DNA does not have obligatory base-pairing constraints across the entire molecule, so its base composition can exhibit $f_{\\mathrm{G}}\\ne f_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{A}}\\ne f_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n\nOption E suggests a DNA–RNA hybrid. The assays specifically confirmed DNA, and the base composition shows thymine (not uracil), providing no evidence for RNA content in the genetic material sample analyzed.\n\nPhysical inference: In single-stranded DNA, there is no global requirement that $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{T}}$ or $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}$, so the observed asymmetric composition, particularly $f_{\\mathrm{G}}\\gg f_{\\mathrm{C}}$, is consistent with a single-stranded DNA genome.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate inference is that the genetic material is a single-stranded DNA molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487261"}, {"introduction": "The 1952 Hershey-Chase experiment provided definitive evidence that DNA, not protein, is the substance of heredity.
