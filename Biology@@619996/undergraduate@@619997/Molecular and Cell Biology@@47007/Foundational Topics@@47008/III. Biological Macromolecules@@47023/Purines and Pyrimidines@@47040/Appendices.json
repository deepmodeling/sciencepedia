A key step in characterizing this virus is to determine the nature of its genetic material. A quantitative analysis of the nitrogenous bases from the viral nucleic acid was performed, yielding the following molar composition: 28% adenine, 30% cytosine, 22% guanine, and 20% uracil. Based on this composition, what is the most likely structure of the genetic material in the TVP-1 virus?\n\nA. Double-stranded RNA\n\nB. Single-stranded RNA\n\nC. Double-stranded DNA\n\nD. Single-stranded DNA\n\nE. A hybrid molecule of RNA and DNA", "solution": "The problem requires us to deduce the structure of a viral genome from its base composition. The fundamental principle governing the structure of double-stranded nucleic acids is complementary base pairing, as described by Chargaff's rules.\n\nFirst, we must identify the type of nucleic acid. The composition includes adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). The presence of uracil instead of thymine (T) is characteristic of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). Therefore, the genetic material of TVP-1 is RNA. This conclusion eliminates options C and D, which describe Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).\n\nNext, we must determine whether the RNA is single-stranded or double-stranded. In a double-stranded nucleic acid helix, adenine (A) forms a specific pair with uracil (U) (in RNA) or thymine (T) (in DNA), and guanine (G) forms a specific pair with cytosine (C). A direct consequence of this strict pairing is that the molar amount of A must equal the molar amount of U, and the molar amount of G must equal the molar amount of C.\n\nLet's analyze the given base percentages for the TVP-1 virus:\n- Molar percentage of Adenine (%A) = 28%\n- Molar percentage of Uracil (%U) = 20%\n- Molar percentage of Guanine (%G) = 22%\n- Molar percentage of Cytosine (%C) = 30%\n\nWe now check if the conditions for double-strandedness are met:\n1.  Is %A equal to %U? We have %A = 28% and %U = 20%. Since $28\\% \\neq 20\\%$, the A-U pairing rule is violated.\n2.  Is %G equal to %C? We have %G = 22% and %C = 30%. Since $22\\% \\neq 30\\%$, the G-C pairing rule is also violated.\n\nBecause the composition does not follow the A=U and G=C rule, the RNA molecule cannot be consistently base-paired along its entire length, which means it cannot be a fully double-stranded molecule. It must be single-stranded.\n\nOne might observe that the total percentage of purines (A + G) is $28\\% + 22\\% = 50\\%$, and the total percentage of pyrimidines (U + C) is $20\\% + 30\\% = 50\\%$. While it is a necessary condition for a double-stranded molecule that the total purines equal the total pyrimidines, this is not a sufficient condition. The individual pairing rules (%A = %U and %G = %C) must hold true. A single-stranded molecule can have any arbitrary base composition, and it is merely a coincidence that the total purine and pyrimidine contents are equal in this particular viral genome.\n\nGiven that the molecule is RNA and the base-pairing rules for a double helix are not satisfied, the genetic material must be single-stranded RNA. This corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1516168"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their role in the stable storage of genetic information, pyrimidines can be subtly altered to induce mutations, a key process in evolution and disease. This exercise allows you to trace the step-by-step molecular consequences of introducing a base analog, 5-bromouracil, into the process of DNA replication. By tracking the fate of a single base pair over two generations, you will gain a concrete understanding of how chemical mutagens can lead to permanent changes in the genetic code [@problem_id:1516185].", "problem": "A specific DNA molecule within a bacterium contains a well-defined Adenine-Thymine (A-T) base pair at a particular gene locus. This bacterium is subjected to a two-stage experiment.\n\nIn the first stage, the bacterium is cultured for exactly one generation in a medium containing a mutagenic agent, 5-bromouracil (5-BU). The agent 5-BU is a base analog of thymine (T), and in its most common stable form (keto form), it pairs with adenine (A) during DNA replication.\n\nIn the second stage, the two cells resulting from the first division are immediately transferred to a new medium that is completely free of 5-BU. They are then allowed to grow for exactly one more generation. It is known that if a 5-BU base has been incorporated into a DNA strand, it has a significant probability of temporarily shifting to its rare, unstable tautomeric form (enol form) when it serves as a template in the next replication round. In this enol form, 5-BU preferentially pairs with guanine (G).\n\nAssuming that the 5-BU is incorporated into a new DNA strand during the first replication round and the subsequent mispairing event occurs during the second replication round, what will be the composition of the base pairs at this specific locus across the four granddaughter DNA molecules?\n\nA. Four molecules with A-T pairs.\n\nB. Two molecules with A-T pairs and two molecules with G-C pairs.\n\nC. Three molecules with A-T pairs and one molecule with a G-C pair.\n\nD. Two molecules with A-T pairs, one molecule with an A-5BU pair, and one molecule with a G-C pair.\n\nE. Three molecules with A-T pairs and one molecule with a G-5BU pair.", "solution": "Principles used:\n- DNA replicates semi-conservatively: each daughter duplex contains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n- Base-pairing rules under normal conditions: A pairs with T; T analog 5-bromouracil (5-BU) in its keto form pairs with A.\n- Tautomerization of incorporated 5-BU: when serving as a template in the next round, 5-BU can transiently adopt its enol form and pair with G, causing a mispair that precedes a fixed transition mutation.\n\nStep-by-step replication history at the specific locus:\n1) Start with a parental duplex containing an A-T pair at the locus: one strand carries A and the complementary strand carries T.\n2) First replication (in 5-BU medium):\n- The strand with template A directs incorporation of a thymine analog; because 5-BU in keto form pairs with A, the newly synthesized complementary base at this site is 5-BU. This produces one daughter duplex containing an A-5BU pair.\n- The complementary parental strand with template T directs incorporation of A, producing the other daughter duplex containing a normal A-T pair.\nThus, after the first generation, there are two duplexes: one with A-5BU and one with A-T.\n3) Second replication (in 5-BU-free medium), allowing mispairing from the incorporated 5-BU:\n- Replication of the A-5BU duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes:\n  a) The parental A strand templates a new T, yielding a granddaughter duplex with an A-T pair.\n  b) The parental strand containing 5-BU now serves as a template; by the stated assumption, it undergoes the tautomeric shift to the enol form during templating and pairs with G. This yields a granddaughter duplex with a G-5BU pair at the locus.\n- Replication of the A-T duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes, both with normal A-T pairs, since there is no 5-BU present and no mispairing is specified.\n\nTally across the four granddaughter DNA molecules: three duplexes with A-T pairs and one duplex with a G-5BU pair. Note that fixation to a stable G-C pair would require a further replication round where the G serves as a template for C; under the two-generation protocol, the mispair remains as G-5BU in one granddaughter duplex.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1516185"}, {"introduction": "Every atom in the complex pyrimidine ring has a specific metabolic origin, assembled from simpler precursor molecules.

The bacteria are cultured in a minimal medium where the sole source of nitrogen for pyrimidine synthesis is provided as glutamine, and the sole source of single carbons for the pyrimidine ring is bicarbonate. The medium is specifically supplemented with two isotopically labeled compounds: bicarbonate in which the carbon atom is a heavy isotope, $^{13}$C, and glutamine in which the amide nitrogen atom is a heavy isotope, $^{15}$N.

Carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from bicarbonate (source of the carbonyl carbon), glutamine amide nitrogen (source of the amide nitrogen), and phosphate. Aspartate transcarbamoylase then condenses carbamoyl phosphate with aspartate to form carbamoyl aspartate, which cyclizes to dihydroorotate and is oxidized to orotate; subsequent addition of PRPP and decarboxylation yields UMP. During OMP decarboxylation, the carboxyl group derived from aspartate at the orotate C6 position is lost as carbon dioxide, but the ring atoms remain.\n\nThe atom-origin mapping for the pyrimidine ring is as follows, based on standard biochemistry:\n- The carbonyl carbon of carbamoyl phosphate, which originates from bicarbonate, becomes ring carbon C2.\n- The amide nitrogen of carbamoyl phosphate, which originates from the glutamine amide nitrogen, becomes ring nitrogen N3.\n- The remaining ring atoms N1, C4, C5, and C6 derive from aspartate.\n\nGiven the labeling in the medium:\n- Bicarbonate carries $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, so the labeled carbon will appear at C2.\n- Glutamine’s amide nitrogen carries $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, so the labeled nitrogen will appear at N3.\n\nTherefore, the correct assignment is $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ at C2 and $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ at N3, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2333953"}]}
