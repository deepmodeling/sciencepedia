This exercise explores the indispensable role of the 3'-hydroxyl group in the elongation of a nucleic acid chain by DNA polymerase. Understanding this mechanism is key not only to cellular processes like DNA replication but also to foundational biotechnologies such as DNA sequencing. [@problem_id:2329519]", "problem": "In an in vitro DNA synthesis experiment, a researcher prepares a reaction mixture containing a single-stranded DNA template, a short DNA primer complementary to a region of the template, DNA polymerase, and an equimolar mixture of the four standard deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP). To this mixture, the researcher adds a small amount of a chemically modified nucleotide, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP). This ddATP is identical to dATP except that it lacks a hydroxyl group at the 3' carbon position of its deoxyribose sugar.\n\nConsider a scenario during the synthesis reaction where the DNA polymerase is actively elongating a new DNA strand and encounters a thymine (T) on the template strand. At this position, a ddATP molecule is incorporated into the growing strand. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence of this incorporation event on the process of DNA elongation?\n\nA. Chain elongation will permanently halt at this position because the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group prevents the formation of a subsequent phosphodiester bond.\n\nB. The ddATP will be incorporated, but its unusual structure will cause the DNA polymerase to immediately dissociate from the DNA template, leaving an incomplete strand.\n\nC. The DNA polymerase will be unable to incorporate the ddATP molecule into the growing strand because its structure is not recognized by the enzyme's active site.\n\nD. The absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group will force the DNA polymerase to form an alternative 2'-5' phosphodiester bond with the next incoming nucleotide, causing a structural distortion in the DNA backbone.\n\nE. The ddATP molecule will be incorporated, and synthesis will continue, but the resulting DNA strand will be less stable than a strand made exclusively with standard dNTPs.", "solution": "DNA polymerase extends a DNA strand by catalyzing the formation of a $3'-5'$ phosphodiester bond between the 3'-hydroxyl group at the terminus of the growing strand and the $\\alpha$-phosphate of an incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphate, a reaction that releases pyrophosphate. The essential chemical requirement for this reaction is the presence of a free 3'-hydroxyl group on the primer terminus to serve as the nucleophile.\n\nDideoxynucleotides such as ddATP lack the 3'-hydroxyl group; their sugar has hydrogen at the 3' position instead of a hydroxyl. When ddATP is selected by base pairing with a thymine on the template, DNA polymerase can incorporate ddATP into the growing strand because the base is correctly paired and the triphosphate is compatible with the active site for the incorporation step. However, once ddATP becomes the terminal nucleotide, the new 3' end lacks the 3'-hydroxyl required for the next nucleophilic attack on the $\\alpha$-phosphate of the next incoming nucleotide. Consequently, no further $3'-5'$ phosphodiester bond can be formed, and elongation stops at that position.\n\nAn immediate dissociation of polymerase is not required to explain the cessation of synthesis; the defining consequence is chain termination due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl. Formation of an alternative $2'-5'$ linkage is not possible in deoxyribose chemistry, and especially not with a dideoxynucleotide that also lacks a $2'$-hydroxyl. Continuing synthesis past a ddNTP incorporation cannot occur because there is no functional group to support further extension, not merely a reduction in stability.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence of ddATP incorporation is permanent chain termination at that position due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group required for the next phosphodiester bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329519"}, {"introduction": "The number of phosphodiester bonds in a nucleic acid is a direct function of the polymer's length and topology.

For a linear polymer of $n$ nucleotides, there are $n-1$ phosphodiester bonds because the two terminal nucleotides each contribute only one linkage.

Nucleases are enzymes that cleave the phosphodiester bonds that link nucleotides together in a nucleic acid chain. To determine their mechanism of action, the biologist performs a series of digestion experiments using two different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) substrates:\n1. A linear, double-stranded DNA molecule with a length of 5,000 base pairs (bp).\n2. A circular, double-stranded plasmid DNA with a total size of 5,000 bp.\n\nThe experiments and their results, as analyzed by gel electrophoresis, are as follows:\n\n*   **Experiment 1:** The linear DNA is incubated with Nuclease Alpha. The result is a smear of many smaller DNA fragments of various sizes, indicating multiple cuts were made throughout the molecule.\n*   **Experiment 2:** The circular plasmid DNA is incubated with Nuclease Alpha.

This pattern is characteristic of an endonuclease.\n- Experiment 2 (circular plasmid + Nuclease Alpha): Initial conversion of the circular plasmid into a single full-length linear fragment (5,000 bp) is explained by a single internal double-strand cut by an endonuclease, which linearizes the circle. Continued incubation producing a smear of smaller fragments further supports ongoing internal cleavages, consistent with endonuclease activity.\n- Experiment 3 (linear DNA + Nuclease Beta): The gradual, progressive shortening of the 5,000 bp band without discrete intermediary fragments indicates processive removal from an end, i.e., exonucleolytic digestion. Ultimately, complete degradation is consistent with exonuclease activity.\n- Experiment 4 (circular plasmid + Nuclease Beta): Persistence of an intact circular plasmid despite extended incubation indicates inability to initiate digestion in the absence of a free end, which is diagnostic of an exonuclease.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Nuclease Alpha behaves as an endonuclease (internal cuts; can linearize circular DNA and then fragment it).\n- Nuclease Beta behaves as an exonuclease (progressive end trimming of linear DNA; no activity on circular DNA).\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is: Nuclease Alpha is an endonuclease and Nuclease Beta is an exonuclease, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329527"}]}
