Using high-resolution structural analysis techniques, the biochemist obtains two key measurements. The first is the pitch of the helix, defined as the vertical distance along the helical axis corresponding to one complete turn, which is measured to be $5.4$ angstroms ($\\AA$). The second is the rise per residue, which is the axial distance contributed by each amino acid residue, measured to be $1.5 \\AA$.\n\nBased on these experimental values, calculate the number of amino acid residues present in a single complete turn of this α-helix.", "solution": "Define $P$ as the pitch (axial distance per full helical turn), $r$ as the rise per residue (axial distance per amino acid), and $N$ as the number of residues per turn.
