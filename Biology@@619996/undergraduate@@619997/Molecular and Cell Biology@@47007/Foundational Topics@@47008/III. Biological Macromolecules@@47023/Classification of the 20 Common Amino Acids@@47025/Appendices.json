This first exercise reinforces the essential vocabulary of protein biochemistry by asking you to associate a single-letter code with its corresponding amino acid and its correct chemical group.

Each amino acid possesses a unique side chain (R-group) that determines its chemical properties, leading to its classification. Based on the properties of its side chain, identify the full name of the amino acid represented by the single-letter code 'W' and its correct classification.\n\nChoose the correct option from the list below.\n\nA. Tryptophan; Nonpolar, aromatic\nB. Tyrosine; Polar, aromatic\nC. Tryptophan; Polar, basic\nD. Phenylalanine; Nonpolar, aromatic\nE. Tryptophan; Nonpolar, aliphatic", "solution": "The single-letter code 'W' corresponds to the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan's side chain is an indole ring, which is an aromatic heterocycle. Aromatic side chains are typically hydrophobic due to their delocalized electron systems, and tryptophan is generally classified as nonpolar, aromatic. Among the standard classifications: phenylalanine (F) and tryptophan (W) are nonpolar aromatic, while tyrosine (Y) is aromatic but has a phenolic hydroxyl group that confers polar character.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A. Tryptophan; Nonpolar, aromatic — correct.\n- B. Tyrosine; Polar, aromatic — true as a statement but the code 'W' is not tyrosine; 'Y' is tyrosine.\n- C. Tryptophan; Polar, basic — incorrect; polar basic residues include lysine (K), arginine (R), histidine (H).\n- D. Phenylalanine; Nonpolar, aromatic — true as a statement but 'W' is not phenylalanine; 'F' is phenylalanine.\n- E.

You will step into the role of a biochemist designing a peptide inhibitor, where selecting the right amino acid is critical for success. This thought experiment demonstrates how the subtle differences in side-chain size, shape, and chemistry—the very basis for classification—directly influence molecular interactions and biological function [@problem_id:2309977].", "problem": "A team of biochemists is engineering a synthetic peptide designed to act as a competitive inhibitor for a novel enzyme. The enzyme's active site contains a deep, narrow hydrophobic pocket. For the peptide to bind effectively, the amino acid residue at a critical position, designated as X, must meet a precise set of structural and chemical requirements.\n\nThe four essential criteria for the amino acid at position X are as follows:\n1.  The side chain must be nonpolar and aliphatic to facilitate hydrophobic interactions within the pocket.\n2.  To provide sufficient van der Waals contacts for stable binding, the side chain must be larger than that of Alanine.\n3.  To fit into the narrowest region of the pocket without steric clash, the side chain must not be branched at its β-carbon (the second carbon of the side chain, bonded to the α-carbon).\n4.  To prevent potential unwanted oxidative side reactions within the enzyme's microenvironment, the side chain must not contain a sulfur atom.\n\nBased on these four requirements, which one of the following amino acids should the researchers select for position X?\n\nA. Valine\nB. Isoleucine\nC. Leucine\nD. Alanine\nE. Methionine", "solution": "We apply the four criteria sequentially to the candidate amino acids.\n\nFirst, criterion 1 requires a nonpolar, aliphatic side chain suitable for hydrophobic interactions. Valine, isoleucine, leucine, and alanine are standard nonpolar aliphatic residues. Methionine is also hydrophobic but contains a thioether; although largely nonpolar, its sulfur will be considered under criterion 4.\n\nSecond, criterion 2 requires the side chain to be larger than that of alanine. Alanine has a methyl side chain and is the smallest among the options, so it fails criterion 2 and is eliminated.\n\nThird, criterion 3 forbids branching at the beta-carbon. Valine has an isopropyl side chain, which is beta-branched, and isoleucine has a sec-butyl side chain that is also beta-branched; both therefore fail criterion 3 and are eliminated. Leucine has an isobutyl side chain with the branching at the gamma-carbon (side chain: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}-(\\text{CH}_3)_2$), so it is not beta-branched and satisfies this criterion.\n\nFourth, criterion 4 forbids a sulfur atom in the side chain. Methionine contains a sulfur in its thioether and is eliminated.\n\nAfter applying all four criteria, leucine uniquely satisfies them: it is nonpolar and aliphatic, larger than alanine, not beta-branched, and sulfur-free. Therefore, the correct choice is leucine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2309977"}, {"introduction": "The chemical properties of amino acids can be quantified to predict their behavior, a cornerstone of many biochemical techniques. This final exercise transitions from qualitative classification to quantitative analysis by guiding you through the calculation of a dipeptide's isoelectric point ($pI$) from the $pK_a$ values of its ionizable groups. Successfully solving this problem will deepen your understanding of how charge properties arise from amino acid structure and how they can be exploited in laboratory settings like chromatography [@problem_id:2309950].", "problem": "A biochemist is designing an ion-exchange chromatography protocol to separate two dipeptides: Glycyl-Alanine (Gly-Ala) and Glycyl-Histidine (Gly-His). The success of this separation hinges on the difference in their isoelectric points (pI). To predict their behavior, the biochemist must first calculate the pI for the more complex peptide, Gly-His.\n\nThe dipeptide Gly-His is formed by a peptide bond between the amino acid Glycine at the N-terminus and Histidine at the C-terminus. The relevant $pK_a$ values for the ionizable groups in the Gly-His structure at the experimental temperature are as follows:\n- The alpha-carboxyl group of the C-terminal Histidine: $pK_{a,C} = 2.10$\n- The imidazole side chain of Histidine: $pK_{a,R} = 6.00$\n- The alpha-amino group of the N-terminal Glycine: $pK_{a,N} = 9.70$\n\nCalculate the approximate isoelectric point (pI) for the dipeptide Gly-His.

As pH increases, deprotonations occur in order of increasing $pK_{a}$: first the C-terminal carboxyl ($pK_{a,C}$), then the histidine side chain ($pK_{a,R}$), then the N-terminus ($pK_{a,N}$). The net charge in successive pH regions is therefore:\n- For $pH < pK_{a,C}$: $+2$.\n- For $pK_{a,C} < pH < pK_{a,R}$: $+1$.\n- For $pK_{a,R} < pH < pK_{a,N}$: $0$.\n- For $pH > pK_{a,N}$: $-1$.\n\nThus the neutral (zwitterionic) form predominates between $pK_{a,R}$ and $pK_{a,N}$. The isoelectric point lies in this interval.\n\nTo determine $pI$ more explicitly, write the net charge as a function of $pH$ using Henderson–Hasselbalch fractions.
