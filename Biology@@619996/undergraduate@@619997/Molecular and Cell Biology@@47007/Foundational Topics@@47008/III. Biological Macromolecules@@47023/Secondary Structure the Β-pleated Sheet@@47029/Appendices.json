The target design is a 10-residue peptide that adopts a β-strand conformation. Two identical copies of this peptide are intended to dimerize, forming an anti-parallel β-sheet. The dimerization is driven by the formation of a hydrophobic interface, making the overall β-sheet amphipathic (one face hydrophobic, the other hydrophilic). A key design feature is that this dimer interface must create a specific binding site for a single zinc ion ($Zn^{2+}$).\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you are given the following information:\n1.  In a β-strand, the side chains of adjacent amino acids point in opposite directions. Assume that for a 10-residue peptide, the side chains at odd-numbered positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) point towards one face (the \"A-face\"), and side chains at even-numbered positions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) point towards the opposite face (the \"B-face\").\n2.  The dimerization is designed to occur by the association of the A-faces of two identical peptides. The B-faces should remain exposed to the aqueous solvent.\n3.  The amino acids can be classified as follows (using their one-letter codes):\n    -   **Hydrophobic (non-polar):** A, V, L, I, F, W, M\n    -   **Hydrophilic (polar or charged):** K, R, D, E, Q, N, S, T, Y, C, G, P\n    -   **Can coordinate $Zn^{2+}$:** H, C, D, E (Note: Histidine, H, is also considered a polar/hydrophilic residue).\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following 10-residue amino acid sequences is the most plausible design for the desired zinc-binding, dimeric peptide?\n\nA.

Two identical peptides would then contribute coordinating residues across the interface.\n\nDesign criteria derived from the problem:\n1. Amphipathicity: odd positions predominantly hydrophobic; even positions predominantly hydrophilic.\n2.

K-I-D-L-E-F-R-V-N-W: Odd (A-face) = K, D, E, R, N (mostly hydrophilic); Even (B-face) = I, L, F, V, W (mostly hydrophobic). This inverts the desired amphipathicity; reject.\n- B. I-L-K-S-E-V-H-R-N-F: Odd (A-face) = I (hydrophobic), K, E, H, N (mostly hydrophilic). Even (B-face) mixed with several hydrophobics (L, V, F).

However, no $Zn^{2+}$-coordinating residue on the A-face; the only ligand (E at position $6$) is on the B-face, so it cannot create an interfacial $Zn^{2+}$ site; reject.\n- D. I-S-L-K-F-H-F-R-V-N: Odd (A-face) = I, L, F, F, V (all hydrophobic) and Even (B-face) hydrophilic, so amphipathicity is good.

I-S-L-K-H-E-F-R-V-N: Odd (A-face) = I, L, H, F, V (hydrophobic at $1,3,7,9$ with a single $H$ at $5$). Even (B-face) = S, K, E, R, N (all hydrophilic). This matches the amphipathic requirement and places a $Zn^{2+}$ ligand (H) on the A-face so that two copies of the peptide provide two His ligands across the dimer interface to bind one $Zn^{2+}$, with remaining coordination completed by solvent.
