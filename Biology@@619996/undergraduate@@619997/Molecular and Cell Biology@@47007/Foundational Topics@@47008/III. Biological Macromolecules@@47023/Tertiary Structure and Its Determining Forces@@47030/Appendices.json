This thought experiment [@problem_id:2340391] challenges you to predict the dramatic consequences of violating this principle by introducing a polar residue into this carefully organized nonpolar environment. Understanding this concept is fundamental to grasping why proteins fold the way they do and how certain mutations can lead to a complete loss of function.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, monomeric globular enzyme that functions optimally in the neutral pH aqueous environment of the cell cytoplasm. Through sequence analysis and structural modeling, it is determined that a specific leucine (Leu) residue is located in the protein's core, a region completely shielded from the surrounding water solvent. To investigate the role of this residue, the biochemist performs site-directed mutagenesis to replace this leucine with a glutamine (Gln) residue. The resulting mutant protein is found to be completely unfolded and catalytically inactive under physiological conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical explanation for the observed destabilization of the protein's tertiary structure?\n\nA. The polar side chain of glutamine is energetically incompatible with the nonpolar environment of the protein's core.\n\nB. The glutamine side chain is significantly larger than the leucine side chain, causing a steric clash that physically pushes the protein apart.\n\nC. The original leucine residue was essential for forming a covalent disulfide bond that stabilized the protein core.\n\nD. The replacement of leucine with glutamine altered the net charge of the protein, disrupting critical electrostatic interactions.\n\nE. Both leucine and glutamine are known \"helix-breakers,\" and their presence in any sequence position is sufficient to disrupt secondary structure.", "solution": "The native tertiary structure of small globular proteins is stabilized primarily by the hydrophobic effect, which favors burial of nonpolar side chains in the protein core and exposure of polar/charged groups to the aqueous solvent. A protein core is a low-dielectric, water-excluded environment; polar or charged groups placed there without proper compensating interactions (such as a well-satisfied internal hydrogen-bond network) incur a large desolvation penalty and often leave hydrogen-bonding capacity unsatisfied, both of which significantly raise the free energy of the folded state relative to the unfolded state.\n\nLeucine has a nonpolar aliphatic side chain that contributes favorably to core packing and hydrophobic stabilization when buried. Glutamine, by contrast, has a polar amide side chain with both a hydrogen-bond donor (the amide N–H) and acceptor (the carbonyl O). In aqueous solvent, these groups are well solvated; upon burial in the core, they lose favorable interactions with water. Unless the protein provides precise local partners to fully satisfy these hydrogen-bonding groups, the burial of glutamine’s polar side chain is energetically unfavorable due to both desolvation and unsatisfied hydrogen bonds. Replacing a buried leucine with glutamine thus removes favorable hydrophobic packing and introduces an unfavorable polar group into a nonpolar environment, destabilizing the folded state and leading to unfolding and loss of activity. This directly supports option A.\n\nThe remaining options are inconsistent with fundamental biochemistry:\nB is unlikely to be the primary cause: the side-chain volumes of leucine and glutamine are comparable, and proteins can often adjust rotamers to alleviate modest steric strain; steric clash is not the most fundamental explanation compared with the strong polarity mismatch.\nC is incorrect: leucine cannot form disulfide bonds; only cysteine participates in disulfide bonds.\nD is incorrect: both leucine and glutamine side chains are neutral at physiological pH; there is no change in net charge, so disruption of electrostatics via altered net charge is not the issue.\nE is incorrect: classic helix breakers are proline and, context-dependently, glycine; neither leucine nor glutamine is inherently a helix breaker.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that a polar glutamine side chain is energetically incompatible with the hydrophobic protein core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340391"}, {"introduction": "While the hydrophobic effect governs the overall architecture of a globular protein, specific local structures like turns and loops often depend on the unique properties of individual amino acids. This exercise [@problem_id:2340362] explores the critical role of steric compatibility by asking you to consider the effect of replacing a small, flexible glycine residue in a tight beta-turn with a large, bulky tryptophan. This practice will sharpen your ability to predict how side chain size and shape influence the formation of essential secondary and tertiary structural elements.", "problem": "In the study of a globular, water-soluble enzyme, a researcher identifies a critical beta-turn that connects two antiparallel beta-strands. This turn is essential for positioning a catalytic residue correctly within the active site. Sequence analysis reveals that a glycine residue is located at a key position within this turn, where the polypeptide backbone must adopt a particularly sharp angle. A site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, replacing this specific glycine residue with a tryptophan residue.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure, what is the most likely consequence of this single amino acid substitution on the local tertiary structure of the enzyme?\n\nA. The beta-turn will be destabilized and likely unfolded due to steric hindrance from the large tryptophan side chain.\n\nB. The beta-turn will be stabilized by new hydrophobic interactions between the tryptophan side chain and the protein core.\n\nC. The local structure will remain an intact beta-turn, as the backbone conformation is primarily dictated by hydrogen bonds independent of individual side chains.\n\nD. The tryptophan residue will form a new disulfide bond with a nearby cysteine, locking the turn into a more rigid conformation.\n\nE. The two beta-strands and the turn region will refold into a more stable alpha-helix.", "solution": "The problem concerns a beta-turn that connects two antiparallel beta-strands and positions a catalytic residue. Beta-turns require the backbone to adopt tight dihedral angles at specific positions, commonly the i+2 position. Glycine is frequently found in beta-turns, especially type II turns, because:\n- Glycine lacks a side chain beyond hydrogen, minimizing steric bulk.\n- Glycine permits backbone dihedral angles that are otherwise disallowed for most residues, as indicated by Ramachandran plot preferences.\n\nReplacing glycine with tryptophan introduces:\n- A very bulky, aromatic side chain that greatly increases steric hindrance.\n- Restricted backbone conformational freedom, making it difficult or impossible to adopt the tight phi and psi angles required in the specific turn.\n\nConsequences for the local structure:\n- The steric clashes and conformational constraints from tryptophan will destabilize the tight turn, potentially unfolding or distorting it, and thereby mispositioning the catalytic residue.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is consistent with the above principles: steric hindrance from tryptophan destabilizes the beta-turn.\n- B is unlikely: although hydrophobic interactions can stabilize protein cores, beta-turns are often partially solvent exposed and, more importantly, the geometric requirement of the turn is incompatible with the bulk of tryptophan; steric and conformational penalties dominate.\n- C is incorrect: while hydrogen bonds contribute to turn stability, side chain identity strongly influences backbone conformational preferences; glycine and proline are characteristic in turns for this reason.\n- D is incorrect: disulfide bonds form between cysteine residues, not tryptophan.\n- E is implausible: a single substitution in a turn linking established beta-strands will not refold the region into an alpha-helix; the hydrogen bonding pattern and strand context oppose such a conversion.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is destabilization and loss of the beta-turn due to steric hindrance from the tryptophan substitution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340362"}, {"introduction": "Having explored qualitative predictions, we now move to a quantitative analysis of protein stability. This problem [@problem_id:2340364] presents a scenario where a seemingly conservative mutation—replacing one nonpolar residue with another slightly smaller one—still significantly destabilizes a protein. Your task is to calculate the change in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, by considering two key energetic contributions, demonstrating that stability arises from a delicate balance of multiple factors, including both hydrophobicity and the efficiency of atomic packing.", "problem": "A researcher is studying a globular protein where an isoleucine (Ile) residue is buried deep within the hydrophobic core, completely shielded from the aqueous solvent. A point mutation is introduced that replaces this isoleucine with a valine (Val). While both are nonpolar amino acids, this mutation is observed to significantly destabilize the protein.\n\nTo quantify this destabilization, you are tasked to estimate the change in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding due to the mutation, defined as $\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\text{unfolding, mutant}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{unfolding, wild-type}}$. A more stable protein has a larger, more positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{unfolding}}$.\n\nConsider the following physical effects that contribute to this change:\n\n1.  **Change in side-chain solvation:** Upon protein unfolding, the buried side chain becomes exposed to the aqueous solvent. The energetic cost of this transfer depends on the side chain's hydrophobicity. The free energy cost of transferring a single methylene group $(-\\text{CH}_2-)$ from a nonpolar environment to water is given as $3.3$ kJ/mol. An isoleucine side chain can be modeled as having one more methylene group than a valine side chain.\n2.  **Creation of a packing defect:** The mutation from the larger isoleucine to the smaller valine is assumed to create a small, empty cavity in the tightly packed protein core because the surrounding residues do not immediately rearrange to fill the void. The creation of such a cavity is energetically unfavorable and raises the energy of the folded state. The specific energetic penalty for cavity formation is given as a coefficient $\\gamma = 0.17 \\text{ kJ/(mol}\\cdot\\text{Å}^3)$. The volume of a single methylene group is $V_{\\text{CH}_2} = 27 \\text{ Å}^3$.\n\nAssuming the Ile-to-Val mutation corresponds to the net removal of a single methylene group from the protein core, calculate the total change in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding, $\\Delta\\Delta G$.

The unfolded state exposes the side chain to water, with a free-energy cost of transferring one methylene group of $+3.3$ kJ/mol. Isoleucine has one more methylene group than valine, so the unfolded state of the wild type is higher in free energy than that of the mutant by $3.3$ kJ/mol.
