This exercise takes you into the heart of this function: the Peptidyl Transferase Center (PTC), where peptide bonds are forged. Through a carefully designed thought experiment, you will explore how a specific structural feature of the 23S rRNA enables catalysis, highlighting the elegant principle of substrate-assisted catalysis and the chemical precision of the ribosome's active site [@problem_id:2336309].", "problem": "An investigator is studying the catalytic mechanism of the prokaryotic ribosome. The central reaction, peptide bond formation, occurs within the Peptidyl Transferase Center (PTC), an active site located in the large ribosomal subunit (50S) composed almost entirely of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The reaction involves the transfer of the growing polypeptide chain from the transfer RNA (tRNA) in the P-site to the amino acid attached to the tRNA in the A-site.\n\nIt is well-established that the ribosome achieves its remarkable catalytic efficiency by precisely orienting the substrates. A key interaction involves the 23S rRNA positioning the 2'-hydroxyl (2'-OH) group of the terminal adenosine residue (A76) of the P-site tRNA. An experiment is designed where a single-nucleotide point mutation is introduced into the gene encoding the 23S rRNA. This mutation specifically disrupts the hydrogen bonding network responsible for holding the 2'-OH group of the P-site tRNA's A76 in its proper catalytic position, without altering the overall structure of the PTC.\n\nAssuming the mutant ribosomes can still assemble correctly and bind both mRNA and tRNA, what is the most likely direct consequence of this specific mutation on the peptidyl transferase reaction?\n\nA. The rate of peptide bond formation will be severely reduced.\n\nB. The binding affinity of the peptidyl-tRNA for the P-site will be significantly decreased, leading to premature dissociation.\n\nC. The fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection at the A-site will be compromised.\n\nD. The ribosome will be unable to translocate along the mRNA after a peptide bond is formed.\n\nE. The ester bond linking the polypeptide to the P-site tRNA will be preferentially hydrolyzed by a water molecule.", "solution": "The peptidyl transferase reaction in the ribosome proceeds by nucleophilic attack of the A-site amino group on the carbonyl carbon of the peptidyl ester at the P-site, forming a tetrahedral intermediate and resulting in transfer of the peptide to the A-site tRNA. Symbolically, the net transformation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}O{-}tRNA_{P}} + \\mathrm{H_{2}N{-}R'{-}tRNA_{A}} \\to \\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH{-}R'} + \\mathrm{HO{-}tRNA_{P}}\n$$\nExtensive biochemical and structural data support that the ribosome’s catalytic power is predominantly due to precise substrate positioning and a proton shuttle mediated by the 2'-hydroxyl of A76 of the P-site tRNA. In the accepted substrate-assisted catalysis model, the 2'-OH of A76 is positioned by a hydrogen-bonding network in the 23S rRNA so that it can facilitate proton transfer between the attacking A-site amine and the P-site 3'-O leaving group, thereby lowering the activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increasing $k_{\\text{cat}}$ for peptidyl transfer.\n\nThe mutation described specifically disrupts the hydrogen bonds that position the P-site tRNA A76 2'-OH, while leaving the overall PTC architecture intact and not impairing assembly or tRNA/mRNA binding. Displacing the 2'-OH from its catalytic geometry impairs its role as a general acid/base proton shuttle, thus increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for the chemical step and directly decreasing the rate of peptide bond formation (reduced $k_{\\text{cat}}$).\n\nBy contrast:\n- P-site binding affinity (option B) is mediated by multiple interactions beyond the A76 2'-OH positioning network; the mutation is specified to affect catalysis without altering overall PTC structure or tRNA binding.\n- A-site selection fidelity (option C) primarily involves the small subunit decoding center and factor-assisted selection, not the PTC 2'-OH positioning.\n- Translocation (option D) is mediated by factor EF-G and large-scale conformational changes after catalysis, not by the 2'-OH positioning.\n- Preferential hydrolysis by water (option E) is unlikely because the PTC excludes water and the described change removes a catalytic aid rather than introducing a general base for water.\n\nTherefore, the most direct consequence is a severe reduction in the rate of peptide bond formation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2336309"}, {"introduction": "Moving from core principles to the frontiers of research, this practice simulates a modern experimental approach to studying ribosome diversity. Scientists increasingly hypothesize that not all ribosomes are the same, with specialized versions existing to translate specific classes of mRNAs.

To test this, they perform a Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) experiment. They use two different engineered cell lines.\n\nCell Line 1 expresses a version of preprolactin (a precursor to a secreted hormone) tagged with a small epitope tag. Affinity purification from this cell line isolates ribosomes actively translating the preprolactin mRNA. This sample is referred to as the 'Secretory' sample.\n\nCell Line 2 expresses a version of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a classic cytosolic enzyme, tagged with the same epitope. Affinity purification from this line isolates ribosomes actively translating the GAPDH mRNA. This sample is referred to as the 'Cytosolic' sample.\n\nAfter purification, the ribosomal proteins from each sample are extracted and analyzed using quantitative mass spectrometry. The abundance of a protein is proportional to its total integrated signal intensity. To control for variations in the total amount of ribosomes recovered in each purification, the researchers measure the intensity of R_P42 and also that of a canonical small subunit protein, RPS15, which is known to be a core component of all ribosomes.\n\nThe measured signal intensities are as follows:\n-   In the 'Secretory' sample:\n    -   Intensity of R_P42: $I_{\\text{P42, Sec}} = 9.14 \\times 10^7$ arbitrary units\n    -   Intensity of RPS15: $I_{\\text{S15, Sec}} = 3.52 \\times 10^8$ arbitrary units\n-   In the 'Cytosolic' sample:\n    -   Intensity of R_P42: $I_{\\text{P42, Cyt}} = 2.05 \\times 10^6$ arbitrary units\n    -   Intensity of RPS15: $I_{\\text{S15, Cyt}} = 4.18 \\times 10^8$ arbitrary units\n\nTo quantify the preferential association of R_P42, calculate its enrichment factor in the 'Secretory' sample relative to the 'Cytosolic' sample. The enrichment factor is defined as the ratio of the normalized abundance of R_P42 in the 'Secretory' sample to its normalized abundance in the 'Cytosolic' sample.
