This first exercise challenges you to think like a cell biologist by considering a critical breakdown in this system. By postulating the absence of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) receptor, you can isolate its function and predict the consequences, thereby reinforcing the essential, sequential nature of the protein targeting machinery [@problem_id:2344629].", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell that has undergone a specific genetic mutation, resulting in the complete absence of a functional Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) receptor on the membrane of its Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). All other cellular components, including ribosomes, SRPs, and protein translocons (Sec61 complexes), are present and fully functional. A particular gene in this cell codes for a soluble protein, Protein Helios, which is normally destined for secretion out of the cell. The synthesis of Protein Helios begins on a free ribosome in the cytosol, and the nascent polypeptide chain features a standard N-terminal ER signal sequence.\n\nAssuming that Protein Helios does not possess any other targeting signals and is not subject to premature degradation, what will be its ultimate, predominant location within this mutant cell after its synthesis is complete?\n\nA.

State the normal pathway for an SRP-dependent secretory protein. Translation of a secretory protein begins on a free ribosome in the cytosol. When the N-terminal ER signal sequence emerges, SRP binds the signal sequence and the ribosome, pausing elongation. The SRP–ribosome–nascent chain complex then targets the ER membrane by binding the SRP receptor. This docking enables GTP-dependent transfer of the ribosome to the Sec61 translocon, release of SRP, resumption of translation, and co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen. The signal sequence is typically cleaved by signal peptidase, and a soluble secretory protein accumulates in the ER lumen before proceeding through the secretory pathway.\n\n2. Identify the critical defect in the mutant cell. The SRP receptor on the ER membrane is absent. All other components, including SRP, ribosomes, and Sec61, are functional.\n\n3. Deduce the immediate consequence of SRP receptor absence. Although SRP can still recognize and bind the N-terminal ER signal sequence on the nascent chain and pause translation, the complex cannot dock at the ER membrane without the SRP receptor. Therefore, the handoff to Sec61 and co-translational translocation into the ER cannot occur.\n\n4. Determine the fate of translation in the cytosol. Without productive docking, SRP cannot complete its cycle to deliver the ribosome to the translocon. SRP will eventually dissociate, and translation will resume and complete on the free ribosome in the cytosol. Because there is no entry into the ER, signal peptidase does not act, and the polypeptide remains entirely synthesized in the cytosol.\n\n5. Exclude alternative targeting routes. Protein Helios has no other targeting sequences. It therefore cannot be directed to mitochondria (which requires an N-terminal amphipathic mitochondrial targeting sequence), nor to lysosomes (which requires first entering the ER and then receiving appropriate trafficking modifications). Post-translational ER import for such secretory proteins is not operative without SRP-receptor–mediated targeting in this scenario, and embedding in the ER membrane requires access to the translocon, which is precluded by the absent SRP receptor.\n\n6. Conclude the predominant location. Lacking ER entry and any other targeting signal and not being degraded prematurely by the problem’s assumption, Protein Helios will remain in the cytosol after synthesis is complete.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344629"}, {"introduction": "Many intricate cellular processes are driven and regulated by molecular switches that consume energy. The targeting of proteins to the ER is a prime example, relying on the binding and hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate ($GTP$). This problem explores the energetic heart of the SRP pathway by introducing a non-hydrolyzable analog of $GTP$, a common tool in cell biology research. Analyzing this scenario will clarify how GTPases ensure the targeting process is both orderly and unidirectional [@problem_id:2344622].", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a researcher develops a method to deplete the entire intracellular pool of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and replace it with GTP-gamma-S (GTPγS), a non-hydrolyzable analog. This analog can bind to GTP-binding proteins with high affinity, effectively locking them in their \"GTP-bound\" conformational state, but it cannot be hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The researcher is studying the co-translational targeting of proteins to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), a process heavily reliant on GTP. This pathway involves a Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) that binds to a signal peptide on a nascent polypeptide emerging from a ribosome, and an SRP Receptor (SR) in the ER membrane. Both SRP and SR are GTP-binding proteins.\n\nAssuming all other cellular processes remain functional, which of the following statements best describes the primary and ultimate consequence of introducing only GTPγS on the co-translational protein targeting pathway?\n\nA. Proteins destined for the ER will be fully synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm but will be unable to be imported post-translationally, causing them to misfold and accumulate in the cytosol.\n\nB. The SRP will be unable to recognize and bind to the ER signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide, leading to all proteins, including secretory proteins, being synthesized and released into the cytoplasm.\n\nC. The SRP-ribosome complex will successfully dock at the SR on the ER membrane, but will become irreversibly locked in this state, sequestering the SRP and SR and thus halting all subsequent protein targeting to the ER.\n\nD. Proteins will be correctly translocated into the ER lumen; however, the SRP will not dissociate from the translocon channel, physically blocking the channel and preventing any further proteins from passing through.\n\nE. TheSRP-SR interaction will be destabilized, preventing the SRP-ribosome complex from docking at the ER membrane, which leads to an accumulation of translationally-arrested ribosome complexes throughout the cytosol.", "solution": "Key molecular principles:\n- SRP and the SRP receptor (SR) are GTPases whose functional cycle requires GTP binding to promote complex formation and GTP hydrolysis to trigger complex dissociation and recycling.\n- In co-translational ER targeting, the canonical sequence is: SRP binds the signal sequence on a nascent chain at the ribosome and pauses elongation; SRP in its GTP-bound state binds SR (also GTP-bound) on the ER membrane; this docks the ribosome-nascent chain to the ER. GTP hydrolysis by SRP and SR then drives dissociation of SRP from SR and from the ribosome, enabling ribosome handoff to the Sec61 translocon and resumption of translation into the ER lumen. SRP and SR are recycled to participate in additional rounds.\n\nIntroduce only GTPγS (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog):\n1) Binding step: GTPγS binds to SRP and SR with high affinity, stabilizing their GTP-bound conformations. Therefore, SRP still recognizes and binds the signal sequence and pauses translation. This rules out any failure of recognition (contradicts option B) and any destabilization of SRP-SR interaction (contradicts option E).\n2) Docking step: Because the GTP-bound states are stabilized, SRP-GTPγS and SR-GTPγS will interact productively, allowing docking of the SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex to SR on the ER membrane. Thus docking is not prevented (contradicts option E).\n3) Hydrolysis-dependent release: The transition that frees SRP and SR and enables handoff of the ribosome to the translocon requires GTP hydrolysis by both SRP and SR. With GTPγS, hydrolysis cannot occur. Therefore, the SRP-SR complex becomes trapped in the GTP-bound state. This locks SRP and SR together at the ER membrane with the docked ribosome, preventing their dissociation and recycling.\n4) Consequences:\n- Immediate/primary: Stable, irreversible (on experimental time scales) SRP-SR complexes accumulate at the ER, sequestering SRP and SR.\n- Ultimate: Because SRP and SR are tied up, new rounds of targeting cannot initiate, halting subsequent ER protein targeting globally.\n- Proteins are not “correctly translocated” first (contradicts option D), nor are they simply completed on free ribosomes by default post-translationally (contradicts option A), because SRP still pauses elongation and docks to SR; the block occurs at the hydrolysis/release step.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that docking occurs, but SRP and SR become irreversibly locked in the GTP-bound complex, sequestering the machinery and halting further ER targeting, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344622"}, {"introduction": "A protein's final destination is ultimately dictated by its amino acid sequence, which is encoded in its gene. This final practice presents a powerful scenario where a subtle change at the genetic level—a single nucleotide insertion—can have dramatic consequences for protein localization.

A functional ER signal peptide is characterized by a central hydrophobic core, which is a continuous alpha-helical stretch of at least 7 hydrophobic amino acids.\n\nBased on an analysis of the new N-terminal sequence produced from the mutated mRNA, what is the most likely ultimate fate of the polypeptide?\n\nA. The protein will be synthesized to completion, fold correctly, and function as a normal cytosolic enzyme.\n\nB. The protein will be synthesized in the cytosol, but due to the frameshift, it will misfold and be targeted for degradation by the cytosolic proteasome system.\n\nC. The nascent polypeptide will be targeted to the ER, but synthesis will terminate prematurely, releasing a short, truncated peptide into the ER lumen.\n\nD. The nascent polypeptide will be fully synthesized in the cytosol and then post-translationally imported into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nE. The protein will be targeted to the ER and inserted into the ER membrane as a single-pass transmembrane protein, with the new N-terminus acting as a stop-transfer anchor sequence.", "solution": "The original mRNA 5' to 3' begins with AUG (start codon) followed by a sequence of repeated UAU triplets. Grouping codons from the start yields:\nAUG | UAU | UAU | UAU | UAU | UAU | UAU | AAU | GGC | UCA | ...\nUsing the provided genetic code, the original N-terminus would translate as Met-(Tyr)$\\times 6$-Asn-Gly-Ser-..., consistent with a cytosolic enzyme and lacking a hydrophobic signal peptide.\n\nA single U is inserted immediately after the AUG. Denote the original remainder after AUG as the nucleotide string R:\nR = UAU UAU UAU UAU UAU UAU AAU GGC UCA ...\nInserting U at the start of R gives:\nU + R = U UAU UAU UAU UAU UAU UAU AAU GGC UCA ...\nNow regroup codons from the start of translation:\nAUG | UUA | UUA | UUA | UUA | UUA | UUA | UAA | UGG | CUC | A...\nThus, after the initial AUG, the reading frame is shifted so that the next six codons are UUA (Leu) and then UAA (Stop). Translation therefore produces:\nMet-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Stop,\nthat is, an N-terminus of length $7$ amino acids (Met plus $6$ Leu), followed immediately by termination.\n\nAssessing ER targeting with the given rule: a functional ER signal peptide requires a continuous hydrophobic core of at least $7$ hydrophobic amino acids. From the amino acid properties provided, both Met and Leu are hydrophobic. The new N-terminus contains $7$ consecutive hydrophobic residues (Met followed by $6$ Leu), which satisfies the signal peptide criterion. Consequently, the nascent chain will be recognized by SRP and targeted co-translationally to the ER membrane.\n\nBecause an in-frame stop codon (UAA) appears immediately after this hydrophobic stretch, translation will terminate prematurely shortly after targeting, yielding only a very short polypeptide. In the co-translational translocation pathway, termination at the stop codon will release a truncated peptide into the ER lumen (with the N-terminal signal sequence acting as the targeting determinant; cleavage by signal peptidase may occur, but regardless the outcome is a short truncated product in the ER).\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate is ER targeting followed by premature termination and release of a short peptide into the ER lumen, which corresponds to option C. Alternative options are inconsistent: A is incompatible with the frameshift and early stop, B is unlikely because the strong N-terminal signal will target to the ER before completion in the cytosol, D lacks a mitochondrial targeting sequence, and E requires a topology and length consistent with a stop-transfer anchor, which is not supported here due to immediate termination after the signal sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344633"}]}
