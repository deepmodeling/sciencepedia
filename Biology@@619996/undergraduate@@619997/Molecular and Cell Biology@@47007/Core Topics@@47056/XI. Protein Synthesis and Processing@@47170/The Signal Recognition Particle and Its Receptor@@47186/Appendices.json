This initial exercise explores the fundamental molecular requirement for a protein to enter the secretory pathway. By considering a hypothetical mutation that drastically alters the chemical nature of this signal, you can test your understanding of what the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) is looking for and predict the consequences when that signal is effectively absent [@problem_id:2344743].", "problem": "In a laboratory experiment, a eukaryotic cell line is engineered to express a mutant version of a protein that is normally secreted from the cell. The wild-type version of this protein begins with an N-terminal signal sequence of 20 amino acids, rich in hydrophobic residues like leucine and isoleucine. In the mutant protein, this entire 20-amino-acid signal sequence has been genetically replaced with a 20-amino-acid sequence composed entirely of charged residues, such as lysine and aspartate. Assuming all other cellular protein targeting and translocation machinery, such as the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), are functioning correctly, what is the most likely final destination of this newly synthesized mutant protein?\n\nA.

Embedded within the plasma membrane", "solution": "We analyze the targeting mechanism for a normally secreted eukaryotic protein and the effect of replacing its N-terminal signal sequence with a fully charged sequence.\n\n1. Principle of cotranslational targeting: Proteins destined for secretion typically begin with an N-terminal signal peptide characterized by a hydrophobic core. This hydrophobic segment is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) during translation, which pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the ER membrane. The complex then engages the Sec61 translocon, allowing the polypeptide to be translocated into the ER lumen. From the ER lumen, the protein follows the secretory pathway through the Golgi apparatus and can be secreted. Therefore, entry into the ER is a prerequisite for being in the ER lumen, the Golgi lumen, or becoming secreted.\n\n2. Structural requirement of the signal peptide: The essential feature of the signal peptide is a hydrophobic core (typically rich in residues such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine), which forms a hydrophobic alpha-helix recognized by SRP. While signal peptides may contain positively charged residues in the N-region, the defining property is the hydrophobic core that mediates SRP binding.\n\n3. Effect of the mutation: The mutant replaces the entire 20-amino-acid signal sequence with a 20-amino-acid sequence composed entirely of charged residues (e.g., lysine and aspartate). Such a sequence lacks the hydrophobicity necessary for SRP recognition and cannot form the hydrophobic core required for targeting to the ER.\n\n4. Consequence for translation and localization: Without SRP recognition, translation proceeds on free cytosolic ribosomes. Lacking any functional ER-targeting signal, the protein will not be delivered to the ER, will not translocate into the ER lumen, and therefore will not enter the secretory pathway. Consequently, it cannot be secreted, cannot be in the ER lumen, and cannot reach the Golgi lumen via the canonical pathway.\n\n5. Exclusion of other fates:\n- Secreted into the extracellular space (A): Not possible without ER entry.\n- Freely soluble within the ER lumen (B): Requires translocation through Sec61, which depends on a functional signal peptide.\n- Freely soluble within the Golgi apparatus (C): Requires prior ER entry and vesicular trafficking.\n- Embedded within the plasma membrane (E): Requires a hydrophobic transmembrane domain or signal-anchor; the engineered charged sequence is incompatible with membrane insertion.\nTherefore, the most likely final destination is freely soluble within the cytosol.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2344743"}, {"introduction": "The SRP pathway is not a static process but a dynamic, multi-step cycle powered by molecular energy. This practice delves into the critical role of GTP hydrolysis in regulating the interaction between SRP and its receptor. By substituting GTP with a non-hydrolyzable analog in a thought experiment, we can effectively \"freeze\" the machinery at a specific checkpoint, revealing the essential function of this energy-releasing step in handing off the protein for translocation [@problem_id:2344792].", "problem": "An *in vitro* experiment is designed to study the co-translational translocation of proteins into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).

Polypeptide synthesis will be arrested, but the ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex will remain soluble in the buffer, unable to associate with the microsomes.\n\nE. The polypeptide will be partially synthesized and then prematurely released from the ribosome into the buffer due to the instability of the complex.", "solution": "The process of co-translational translocation of a secretory protein proceeds through defined, GTPase-regulated steps involving SRP and the SRP receptor (SR). The relevant mechanistic principles are:\n- SRP binds the emerging N-terminal signal sequence on the ribosome-nascent chain complex and transiently arrests elongation.\n- Both SRP and SR are GTPases. Binding of GTP promotes high-affinity docking between SRP and SR at the ER membrane.\n- GTP hydrolysis on SRP and SR is required to dissociate SRP from the ribosome and SR, release the translation arrest, and hand off the ribosome-nascent chain to the Sec61 translocon for resumed elongation into the ER lumen.\n\nGiven the experimental setup:\n1. Translation initiates on the provided mRNA, and the N-terminal signal sequence emerges from the ribosome.\n2. SRP binds the signal sequence and the ribosome, causing elongation arrest.\n3. In the presence of guanosine 5'-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (GMP-PNP), a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, SRP and SR can bind the analog in their GTP-binding sites. GTP binding per se is not impaired, so SRP–SR docking still occurs with high affinity.\n4. The ribosome–nascent chain–SRP complex docks to the SRP receptor on the microsomal membrane because the GTP-bound (or GMP-PNP–bound) conformations of SRP and SR favor association.\n5. Normally, subsequent GTP hydrolysis on both SRP and SR is required to release SRP, relieve elongation arrest, and transfer the ribosome to the Sec61 translocon to resume synthesis into the lumen.\n6. Because GMP-PNP cannot be hydrolyzed, this hydrolysis step does not occur. Consequently, SRP is not released, translation arrest persists, and the complex remains tightly bound at the microsomal membrane via the SRP–SR interaction.\n7. At steady state, the predominant species will therefore be arrested ribosome–nascent chain–SRP complexes stably associated with the SRP receptor on the microsomes. The protein will not be fully synthesized or translocated (ruling out A), it will not remain soluble (ruling out D), it will not be released into the buffer as a full-length protein (ruling out C), and there is no mechanistic basis for premature release from the ribosome due to instability under these conditions (ruling out E).\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that polypeptide synthesis is arrested and the complex is tightly bound to the SRP receptor on the microsomal membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2344792"}, {"introduction": "Scientific models are built on experimental evidence.

By analyzing the data from a series of controlled experiments, you can deduce whether a protein has been successfully transported into the protective lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, a core skill in validating hypotheses about protein trafficking [@problem_id:2344768].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating a newly discovered eukaryotic protein, designated \"Protein P\". The protein's gene sequence predicts a full-length polypeptide with a molecular weight of 45 kilodaltons (kDa). To determine if Protein P is targeted to the secretory pathway, the researcher performs an *in vitro* translation experiment. The experiment uses a cell-free system containing all necessary components for protein synthesis (ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, etc.) and analyzes the products using SDS-PAGE, a technique that separates proteins by size.\n\nFour separate experimental conditions are set up:\n\n1.  **Condition A:** The mRNA for Protein P is translated in the cell-free system without any other additions. The result is a single sharp band on the gel corresponding to a molecular weight of 45 kDa.\n2.  **Condition B:** The mRNA for Protein P is translated in the cell-free system in the presence of microsomes, which are small vesicles derived from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The result is a single sharp band at 42 kDa.\n3.  **Condition C:** The reaction mixture from Condition B is taken and treated with a protease, an enzyme that degrades proteins. The protease cannot cross the microsomal membrane. The result is a single sharp band at 42 kDa.\n4.  **Condition D:** The reaction mixture from Condition B is taken and treated simultaneously with both the protease and a mild, non-ionic detergent. The detergent is known to dissolve membranes. The result is the complete absence of any protein band corresponding to Protein P or its fragments.\n\nBased on the outcomes of these four experiments, which of the following conclusions is the most accurate?\n\nA. Protein P is a cytosolic protein, and the result in Condition B is an experimental artifact.\n\nB. Protein P is an integral membrane protein that spans the ER membrane multiple times.\n\nC. Protein P is fully translocated into the lumen of the ER and possesses a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence.\n\nD. The protease used in Conditions C and D was inactive, rendering the results inconclusive.\n\nE. Protein P binds to the outer surface of the ER membrane but does not enter the lumen.", "solution": "Interpretation relies on core principles of co-translational targeting to the ER and protection assays with microsomes and protease. Secretory pathway proteins typically possess an N-terminal signal sequence that directs ribosome-nascent chains to the ER; upon insertion into the translocon and entry into the ER lumen, the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase, reducing the apparent molecular weight on SDS-PAGE. Intact microsomal membranes protect luminal domains from externally added proteases that cannot cross membranes; detergent solubilization eliminates this protection.\n\nCondition A: Translation without microsomes yields a single band at 45 kDa, matching the predicted full-length polypeptide. This indicates no processing such as signal peptide cleavage occurs in the absence of ER membranes.\n\nCondition B: Translation in the presence of microsomes yields a single band at 42 kDa. The downward shift relative to 45 kDa is consistent with removal of a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide of approximately 3 kDa by ER signal peptidase during co-translational translocation. This indicates targeting to and processing within the ER.\n\nCondition C: The Condition B reaction is treated with a protease that cannot cross membranes and still shows a single band at 42 kDa. This demonstrates that Protein P is protected from the protease by the microsomal membrane, indicating it resides within the microsome lumen and is not exposed on the cytosolic side. If Protein P were cytosolic, membrane-bound on the cytosolic surface, or had cytosolic domains (as in many integral membrane proteins), the protease would degrade those exposed regions, yielding no intact 42 kDa band or generating smaller protected fragments rather than the intact processed form.\n\nCondition D: The same reaction is treated with both protease and a mild non-ionic detergent that dissolves membranes, resulting in complete loss of the Protein P band. Dissolving the membrane removes protection, allowing protease access to all parts of Protein P and leading to its complete degradation. This confirms that the protease is active and that the prior protection was due to membrane encapsulation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the presence of microsomes produces a reproducible, mechanistically expected shift to a lower molecular weight and confers protease protection, both inconsistent with a purely cytosolic protein or an artifact.\n- B is unlikely because an integral multi-pass membrane protein would typically present cytosolic segments accessible to the protease in Condition C, resulting in partial digestion and protected fragments rather than an intact 42 kDa band identical to Condition B.\n- C is supported by all observations: co-translational translocation into the ER lumen, cleavage of an N-terminal signal sequence (accounting for the 45 kDa to 42 kDa shift), protection from external protease when membranes are intact, and complete digestion upon membrane solubilization.\n- D is excluded by Condition D, which demonstrates protease activity after detergent treatment.\n- E is excluded because an externally bound protein would be accessible to protease in Condition C and degraded.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Protein P is fully translocated into the ER lumen and possesses a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344768"}]}
