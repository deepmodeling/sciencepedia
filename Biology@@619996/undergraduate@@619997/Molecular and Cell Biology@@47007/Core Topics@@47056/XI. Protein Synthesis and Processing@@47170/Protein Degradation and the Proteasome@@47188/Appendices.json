This first practice challenges you to interpret a classic experimental design used to determine if a protein is a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. By using an inhibitor of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) to halt production and a specific proteasome inhibitor (MG132) to block degradation, you can draw a definitive conclusion about the protein's fate, a fundamental skill for any cell biologist [@problem_id:2332518].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the stability of a newly identified protein, which they have named \"Paradosis,\" within a culture of mammalian cells. To determine its degradation pathway, they design an experiment using two specific chemical inhibitors. Cycloheximide is a drug that halts protein synthesis by blocking the elongation step of translation. MG132 is a potent, specific, and reversible inhibitor of the proteasome, the primary cellular machinery for targeted protein degradation.\n\nThe experiment is set up as follows:\nTwo identical populations of cells, labeled Culture A and Culture B, are grown under the same conditions.\nAt time $t=0$, both cultures are treated with a sufficient concentration of cycloheximide to completely stop all new protein synthesis.\nSimultaneously at $t=0$, Culture B is also treated with MG132, while Culture A serves as the control for the effect of proteasome inhibition.\nThe total amount of Paradosis protein is quantified in lysates from both cultures at various time points after $t=0$.\n\nThe experimental observations are:\n1.  In Culture A (treated with cycloheximide only), the concentration of Paradosis protein is observed to decrease to approximately 50% of its initial level within a few hours.\n2.  In Culture B (treated with both cycloheximide and MG132), the concentration of Paradosis protein remains nearly constant at its initial level throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions is the most scientifically sound?\n\nA. The Paradosis protein is extremely stable and is not normally degraded by the cell.\n\nB. The degradation of the Paradosis protein is primarily mediated by the proteasome.\n\nC. MG132 functions by increasing the rate of synthesis of the Paradosis protein.\n\nD. Cycloheximide induces a specific pathway that leads to the degradation of the Paradosis protein.\n\nE. The Paradosis protein is degraded through the lysosomal pathway.", "solution": "Define $P(t)$ as the total amount of Paradosis protein at time $t$. The standard kinetic balance for cellular protein amount is\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=k_{\\mathrm{syn}}-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}P,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is the zero-order synthesis rate and $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nAt $t=0$, cycloheximide is added to both cultures, which by definition sets $k_{\\mathrm{syn}}=0$ for both Culture A and Culture B. Therefore, for both cultures after $t=0$ the governing equation reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}P.\n$$\nIts solution is\n$$\nP(t)=P(0)\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t).\n$$\n\nIn Culture A (cycloheximide only), the observation that $P(t)$ drops to about one-half of $P(0)$ within a few hours implies a finite positive $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}>0$ and an exponential decay with a half-life $t_{1/2}$ satisfying\n$$\n\\frac{P(t_{1/2})}{P(0)}=\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t_{1/2})=\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad k_{\\mathrm{deg}}=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}.\n$$\nThus, Paradosis is actively degraded when synthesis is blocked.\n\nIn Culture B (cycloheximide plus MG132), the amount $P(t)$ remains approximately constant at $P(0)$, which under the same synthesis block ($k_{\\mathrm{syn}}=0$) requires the effective degradation rate to be strongly suppressed, i.e.,\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{deg}}\\approx 0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{dP}{dt}\\approx 0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad P(t)\\approx P(0).\n$$\nSince MG132 is a specific reversible inhibitor of the proteasome, the suppression of decay in Culture B indicates that the degradation observed in Culture A is proteasome dependent.\n\nEvaluate the answer choices against these dynamics:\n- A is false because Culture A shows decay to about one-half, demonstrating Paradosis is not extremely stable and is normally degraded.\n- B is supported: MG132 blocks the proteasome and stabilizes Paradosis, implying degradation is primarily proteasome mediated.\n- C is false because cycloheximide eliminates synthesis in both cultures ($k_{\\mathrm{syn}}=0$), so MG132 cannot increase synthesis under these conditions.\n- D is false because cycloheximideâ€™s mechanism is to block translation elongation, not to induce degradation; the prevention of decay by MG132 identifies the proteasome as the relevant pathway rather than a cycloheximide-induced process.\n- E is false because MG132 targets the proteasome, not lysosomes; if lysosomal degradation were primary, MG132 would not prevent the decline observed in Culture A.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound conclusion is that degradation of Paradosis is primarily mediated by the proteasome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2332518"}, {"introduction": "After confirming that a protein is degraded via the proteasome, the next logical question is: how stable is it?

This final practice moves beyond simple degradation to explore how this process is controlled, focusing on deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that reverse the \"degrade me\" signal. By predicting the effect of overexpressing a DUB on its target protein, you will learn to reason about biological systems as balanced networks and understand how altering one component can shift the entire equilibrium [@problem_id:2332491].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the steady-state concentration of many proteins is regulated by a dynamic equilibrium between protein synthesis and degradation. The primary pathway for selective degradation is the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). In this system, a target protein is tagged with a chain of ubiquitin molecules, marking it for destruction by a large protein complex called the proteasome. This ubiquitination process is counteracted by a class of enzymes known as Deubiquitinating Enzymes (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin chains from target proteins, thereby rescuing them from degradation.\n\nConsider a specific target protein, Protein P53 (a well-known tumor suppressor), whose levels are tightly controlled by the UPS. In a particular cell line, the ubiquitination of P53 is primarily mediated by the E3 ligase MDM2, and its deubiquitination is carried out by the DUB known as USP7.\n\nA research team genetically engineers this cell line to stably overexpress the USP7 enzyme.

The steady-state level of P53 will significantly increase.\n\nB. The steady-state level of P53 will significantly decrease.\n\nC. The steady-state level of P53 will remain unchanged, as the cell will downregulate P53 synthesis to compensate.\n\nD.

This is the direct consequence given that synthesis ($v_{s}$) is unchanged. Hence, the most likely outcome is a significant increase in P53 levels.\n\nOption D proposes an increase in ubiquitination to compensate, but that is not a direct immediate consequence of DUB overexpression; and option C invokes synthesis compensation, which is explicitly excluded by the assumption.
