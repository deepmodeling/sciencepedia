Assuming the protein does not chemically react with the solvent, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected fate of the protein's tertiary structure after it has reached a new thermodynamic equilibrium?\n\nA. The protein will maintain its native tertiary structure, as this conformation is stabilized by strong covalent peptide bonds that are unaffected by the solvent change.\n\nB. The protein will completely and irreversibly denature, adopting the conformation of a random, unstructured polypeptide chain, as the nonpolar solvent disrupts all hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.\n\nC. The protein will undergo a conformational change, refolding into a new, stable tertiary structure where the majority of its hydrophilic side chains are buried in the core and its hydrophobic side chains are exposed on the surface.\n\nD. The protein will lose its secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets, but it will largely maintain its overall globular tertiary shape.\n\nE. The protein will immediately precipitate out of the nonpolar solvent because its surface, being rich in hydrophilic groups, is incompatible with the new environment.", "solution": "We analyze the protein’s energetics before and after transfer, using the principle that the equilibrium conformation minimizes the Gibbs free energy $G$ in the given solvent. The relevant thermodynamic relation is\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S,\n$$\nwith contributions from solvation, intramolecular interactions, and configurational entropy.\n\nIn water, the native, globular fold is stabilized primarily by the hydrophobic effect: nonpolar side chains are buried to avoid unfavorable interactions with water, while polar side chains remain solvated at the surface. This minimizes the solvation free energy. Symbolically, for a side chain $i$,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{(i)}(\\text{expose in water}) \\text{ is large and positive for hydrophobes, small or negative for hydrophiles,}\n$$\nso burying hydrophobes and exposing hydrophiles lowers $G$.\n\nUpon transfer to a nonpolar solvent, the sign and magnitude of solvation terms change.

The enzyme's thermal stability will increase because the smaller alanine side chain reduces steric hindrance, allowing the protein backbone to adopt a more compact and stable conformation.\n\nB. The enzyme's thermal stability will decrease because replacing the large, highly hydrophobic tryptophan with the small, less hydrophobic alanine creates a cavity and significantly weakens the hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the core.\n\nC. The mutation will have a negligible effect on thermal stability because both tryptophan and alanine are nonpolar amino acids, so the overall hydrophobic character of the core remains unchanged.\n\nD.

This final practice compares two common laboratory methods to explore the crucial difference between reversible and irreversible denaturation. By analyzing why heat-induced unfolding often leads to irreversible aggregation while chemical denaturation can be reversed, you will appreciate that kinetics and intermolecular interactions are key factors in determining a protein's fate. [@problem_id:2332699]", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, water-soluble, single-domain globular protein that contains no disulfide bonds. The biochemist performs two separate experiments.\n\nIn Experiment 1, the protein is dissolved in a solution of 8 M urea. After a brief incubation, the solution is placed in a dialysis bag and dialyzed against a large volume of buffer, which gradually removes the urea. Upon analysis, the protein is found to have fully regained its original three-dimensional structure and biological activity.\n\nIn Experiment 2, an identical sample of the protein is dissolved in buffer solution and heated to 95°C for 10 minutes, then allowed to cool slowly back to room temperature. Upon analysis, the protein is found to be biologically inactive and has formed a white, insoluble precipitate.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best molecular-level explanation for why denaturation by urea was reversible while denaturation by heat was irreversible in this case?\n\nA. High temperatures cause polypeptide chains to unfold rapidly and expose their nonpolar, hydrophobic cores. These exposed cores can then interact with those of other unfolded molecules, leading to the formation of stable, non-specific aggregates that prevent correct refolding. Urea, however, unfolds the protein in a way that is less prone to aggregation, allowing for reversal upon its removal.\n\nB.

The key observation is that denaturation by urea is reversible, while denaturation by heat is irreversible for the given protein. We must analyze the molecular mechanisms to find the best explanation.\n\n**Analyzing the Denaturation Processes**\n\n1.  **Urea Denaturation:** Urea is a chemical denaturant. It disrupts the native structure of a protein primarily by interfering with the non-covalent interactions that stabilize it. Urea molecules can form hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone and polar side chains, competing with the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. More importantly, urea disrupts the highly ordered structure of water molecules that surround the protein. This weakens the hydrophobic effect, which is the major driving force for a protein to fold and bury its nonpolar residues in the core. The overall effect is a gradual unfolding of the protein into a denatured state. Because no covalent bonds are broken and the process is driven by the chemical concentration of urea, removing the urea slowly (via dialysis) allows the thermodynamic drive to refold to the stable native state to take over, restoring the original structure and function.\n\n2.  **Heat Denaturation:** Heating a protein solution increases the kinetic energy of the system. This increased thermal motion leads to vibrations and rotations within the protein structure that are strong enough to overcome the relatively weak non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces) that maintain the folded state. This leads to a rapid and cooperative unfolding of the polypeptide chain. A critical consequence of this unfolding is the exposure of the protein's hydrophobic core—which is normally sequestered from the aqueous solvent—to the water.\n\n**Explaining the Difference in Reversibility**\n\nThe core difference lies in what happens *after* the protein unfolds.\n\n-   In the case of heat denaturation, the rapid unfolding of many protein molecules simultaneously in solution leads to a high concentration of exposed, \"sticky\" hydrophobic surfaces. These nonpolar surfaces have a strong thermodynamic tendency to minimize their contact with water. Instead of refolding individually, the unfolded chains can rapidly and non-specifically associate with each other, forming large, disordered **aggregates**. These intermolecular hydrophobic interactions are very stable, effectively trapping the proteins in an insoluble, non-functional state. Even upon cooling, the proteins are kinetically trapped in this aggregated form and cannot refold correctly. This process is the molecular basis for the coagulation of egg white (albumin) when cooked.\n\n-   In the case of urea denaturation, the unfolding is often more gradual and the urea molecules themselves can help to solvate the exposed nonpolar groups to some extent, reducing the strong drive for aggregation. When the urea is removed slowly, each individual protein molecule has the opportunity to explore conformational space and find its lowest-energy native state, minimizing the chances of intermolecular aggregation.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A. High temperatures cause polypeptide chains to unfold rapidly and expose their nonpolar, hydrophobic cores. These exposed cores can then interact with those of other unfolded molecules, leading to the formation of stable, non-specific aggregates that prevent correct refolding. Urea, however, unfolds the protein in a way that is less prone to aggregation, allowing for reversal upon its removal.** This statement accurately describes the mechanism. Heat-induced unfolding leads to aggregation via exposed hydrophobic surfaces, which is an irreversible process. It correctly contrasts this with the more controlled, reversible denaturation by urea. This is the correct explanation.\n\n*   **B. Denaturation by heat is irreversible because it breaks the covalent peptide bonds within the protein's primary sequence. Denaturation by urea is reversible because it only disrupts the much weaker hydrogen bonds.** This is incorrect. While heat can break peptide bonds, it requires much more extreme conditions (e.g., prolonged boiling in strong acid or base). The temperature of 95°C used for denaturation is sufficient to break non-covalent bonds but not the strong covalent peptide bonds. The primary structure remains intact during heat denaturation.\n\n*   **C. Urea acts as a competitive inhibitor that permanently binds to the protein's active site, making the loss of function irreversible. Heating simply causes the protein to temporarily lose its shape, which is restored upon cooling.** This statement directly contradicts the experimental results. The problem states that urea denaturation was reversible, and heat denaturation was irreversible. Furthermore, urea is a general denaturant that affects the entire protein structure, not a specific competitive inhibitor that only targets the active site.\n\n*   **D. The protein contains hidden temperature-sensitive amino acids that are permanently altered by heat, but are unaffected by the chemical environment created by urea.** While some amino acids (like asparagine and glutamine) can deamidate at high temperatures, this is generally a slow process and is not the primary reason for the rapid and complete aggregation observed. The most general and dominant cause of irreversibility from heating is aggregation due to exposed hydrophobic regions, which applies to nearly all globular proteins. This option is less accurate and less general than option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332699"}]}
