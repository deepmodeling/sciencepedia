This fundamental question is at the heart of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). This exercise [@problem_id:2345322] asks you to predict the outcome of a classic experiment where Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress is induced by blocking protein glycosylation, a modification crucial for proper folding. By determining the resulting change in the expression of the master chaperone BiP, you will reinforce your understanding of the core logic of UPR activation: sensing unfolded proteins and upregulating genes that enhance folding capacity.", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the cellular stress response in a line of cultured pancreatic beta-cells, which are specialized for producing and secreting large quantities of the protein insulin. A key cellular quality control mechanism is the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which is activated when misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n\nA central component of the UPR is the Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP), an ER-resident molecular chaperone that assists in protein folding. To study the UPR, the researchers treat a population of these beta-cells with tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification essential for the correct folding and stability of a large number of proteins that are processed through the ER, including the insulin prohormone.\n\nAfter a suitable incubation period with tunicamycin, the researchers isolate total RNA from the cells and quantify the abundance of BiP messenger RNA (mRNA) relative to an untreated control group of cells. Based on your understanding of the UPR, which of the following outcomes is the most likely result of this experiment?\n\nA. The level of BiP mRNA will be significantly increased.\n\nB. The level of BiP mRNA will be significantly decreased.\n\nC. The level of BiP mRNA will show no discernible change.\n\nD. All BiP mRNA will be rapidly degraded, leading to undetectable levels.\n\nE. The level of BiP mRNA will fluctuate randomly with no clear trend.", "solution": "The key mechanistic steps are as follows.\n\n1. Tunicamycin specifically inhibits N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This prevents proper glycan addition to nascent polypeptides, which is essential for correct folding of many secretory and membrane proteins, including proinsulin. Consequently, misfolded and unglycosylated proteins accumulate in the ER lumen.\n\n2. Accumulation of misfolded proteins constitutes ER stress and activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Under non-stressed conditions, the ER chaperone BiP (also known as GRP78) binds the luminal domains of the three principal UPR sensors PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, keeping them inactive. When misfolded proteins accumulate, BiP preferentially binds these unfolded substrates, dissociating from PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 and thereby permitting their activation.\n\n3. Activated UPR signaling increases the transcription of ER chaperones to enhance folding capacity. Specifically:\n- IRE1 catalyzes the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA to produce XBP1s, a transcription factor that upregulates genes encoding ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation components, including the BiP/GRP78 gene (HSPA5).\n- ATF6 translocates to the Golgi for regulated intramembrane proteolysis, releasing the ATF6(N) transcription factor that also directly induces BiP/GRP78 transcription.\n- Although PERK reduces global translation via phosphorylation of $eIF2\\alpha$, it selectively enhances translation of ATF4, which cooperates in the broader stress response; this does not negate the transcriptional upregulation of BiP.\n\n4. The net effect of IRE1-XBP1s and ATF6(N) activation is a transcriptional increase in BiP, leading to elevated BiP mRNA abundance. Therefore, compared to untreated controls, BiP mRNA levels are expected to be significantly increased after tunicamycin treatment.\n\n5. Alternatives are inconsistent with UPR biology: a significant decrease, no change, rapid degradation to undetectable levels, or random fluctuation contradict the well-established transcriptional induction of BiP during ER stress.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a significant increase in BiP mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345322"}, {"introduction": "Cellular responses often involve exquisite layers of regulation. While the UPR triggers a general slowdown of protein synthesis to relieve the burden on the ER, it must simultaneously produce specific proteins needed to combat the stress. This practice problem [@problem_id:2345305] delves into the elegant molecular solution to this paradox, focusing on the PERK signaling branch and its phosphorylation of $eIF2\\alpha$. You will explore how cells exploit the complex structure of the *ATF4* messenger RNA to selectively increase its translation precisely when the machinery for most other proteins is put on hold, a beautiful example of sophisticated translational control.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers a stress response pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). One of the key branches of the UPR involves the activation of the kinase PERK, which phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). This phosphorylation globally attenuates protein synthesis by reducing the availability of the active eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC), which is required for translation initiation. Paradoxically, under these same conditions of general translational repression, the synthesis of a specific transcription factor, Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), is significantly increased. The messenger RNA (mRNA) for ATF4 possesses a long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) that contains two short upstream Open Reading Frames, designated uORF1 and uORF2. The start codon for the main ATF4 protein coding sequence (CDS) is located downstream of both uORF1 and uORF2.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements best explains the mechanism for the paradoxical increase in ATF4 translation during ER stress?\n\nA. During stress, phosphorylated eIF2α binds directly to a specific site within the ATF4 5' UTR, functioning as an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) to recruit ribosomes and initiate translation.\n\nB. Under normal conditions, ribosomes translate uORF1 and then dissociate from the mRNA. Under stress conditions, the ribosome remains bound after translating uORF1, allowing it to proceed to the ATF4 start codon.\n\nC. Under stress, the low concentration of the ternary complex (TC) causes the scanning 40S ribosomal subunit, after translating uORF1, to take longer to reacquire a TC. This delay allows it to bypass the inhibitory uORF2 start codon and eventually reach the main ATF4 start codon, where initiation then occurs.\n\nD. The ER stress signal induces alternative splicing of the ATF4 pre-mRNA, leading to the removal of the inhibitory uORF2 from the mature mRNA transcript, thereby permitting ribosomes to access the main ATF4 coding sequence.\n\nE. Under normal conditions, high concentrations of the ternary complex (TC) allow the ribosome to scan past uORF1 and uORF2 and initiate directly at the ATF4 start codon. Under stress, the ribosome is forced to translate the uORFs first, which somehow enhances translation of the main coding sequence.", "solution": "We begin from the established mechanism of translation initiation. The initiation-competent ternary complex (TC) is eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi; its availability is required for AUG recognition by a scanning 40S ribosomal subunit. PERK activation during ER stress phosphorylates $eIF2\\alpha$, which reduces the effective availability of TC by sequestering the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, thereby globally lowering initiation.\n\nATF4 mRNA contains two uORFs in its 5' UTR. The ribosome typically initiates at uORF1, translates it, and then terminates. After termination at uORF1, the 40S subunit often remains bound to the mRNA and continues scanning; however, to reinitiate at a downstream AUG, it must reacquire a TC. The timing of TC reacquisition relative to the position of the next AUG determines which downstream ORF is initiated.\n\nUnder non-stress conditions, TC is abundant. Therefore, after termination at uORF1, the scanning 40S rapidly reacquires a TC before or at the uORF2 AUG. As a result, it reinitiates at uORF2. Translation of uORF2 is inhibitory for the main ATF4 ORF (for example, due to its position and overlap or by causing post-termination conditions that prevent access to the main AUG), so initiation at the main ATF4 start codon is largely suppressed.\n\nUnder ER stress, $eIF2\\alpha$ phosphorylation lowers TC availability. After termination at uORF1, the scanning 40S delays in reacquiring a TC. Because of this delay, when the 40S passes the uORF2 AUG, it still lacks TC and therefore cannot initiate at uORF2. The 40S continues scanning past uORF2, and only later reacquires TC nearer to the main ATF4 start codon. At that point, initiation occurs at the main ATF4 AUG, increasing ATF4 translation despite global translational attenuation.\n\nEvaluation of the choices:\n- A is incorrect: phosphorylated eIF2$\\alpha$ does not create an IRES nor bind a specific 5' UTR site to recruit ribosomes.\n- B is incorrect: reinitiation competence after uORF1 depends on TC reacquisition, not simply stress-dependent retention or dissociation; under non-stress, ribosomes commonly remain associated and reinitiate at uORF2.\n- C is correct: low TC under stress delays reinitiation after uORF1, allowing bypass of uORF2 and initiation at the main ATF4 AUG.\n- D is incorrect: the mechanism does not involve alternative splicing removing uORF2.\n- E is incorrect: under non-stress, high TC favors reinitiation at uORF2, which inhibits main ORF initiation; the statement reverses the known behavior.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that low TC under stress delays reinitiation such that the uORF2 start codon is bypassed, enabling initiation at the main ATF4 start codon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2345305"}, {"introduction": "An effective stress response must not only activate strongly but also resolve promptly once the threat has passed, allowing the cell to return to normal function. This is achieved through negative feedback loops that actively shut down the signaling pathway. This exercise [@problem_id:2345347] focuses on the \"off-switch\" for the PERK pathway, a phosphatase complex involving the GADD34 protein that dephosphorylates $eIF2\\alpha$. By comparing the recovery of normal cells to those lacking GADD34, you will develop a deeper appreciation for the dynamics of cellular signaling and the critical importance of terminating a response to maintain homeostasis.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, researchers are investigating the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a critical cellular stress response pathway originating from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The UPR has three main branches, one of which is mediated by the kinase PERK. Upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, PERK dimerizes and autophosphorylates, becoming active. Active PERK then phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) globally inhibits messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, thereby reducing the protein load on the ER. However, p-eIF2α also promotes the translation of certain mRNAs, such as that for the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4, in turn, drives the expression of stress-response genes, including GADD34. The GADD34 protein serves as a regulatory subunit for Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), targeting it to dephosphorylate p-eIF2α.\n\nTo study this regulatory network, the researchers use two cell lines: a wild-type (WT) line and a mutant line with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the *GADD34* gene. Both cell lines are subjected to the same experimental protocol:\n1. The cells are cultured under normal conditions.\n2. An ER stress-inducing agent is added to the culture medium for a short, transient period, activating the UPR.\n3. The medium is then replaced with fresh, stress-free medium, and the cells are allowed to recover.\n\nThe rate of global protein synthesis is monitored in both cell lines before, during, and after the period of transient stress. Based on your understanding of the PERK-eIF2α pathway, which of the following outcomes would most accurately describe the recovery phase in the GADD34 mutant cells compared to the WT cells?\n\nA. The mutant cells will exhibit a faster recovery of global protein synthesis than the WT cells.\n\nB. The mutant cells will exhibit a significantly delayed recovery of global protein synthesis compared to the WT cells.\n\nC. The mutant cells will be unable to decrease their rate of global protein synthesis in response to the ER stress agent.\n\nD. The recovery rate of global protein synthesis will be identical in both mutant and WT cells.\n\nE. The mutant cells will show an exaggerated, overshoot-like increase in protein synthesis above baseline levels immediately upon stress removal.", "solution": "The PERK–$eIF2\\alpha$ arm of the Unfolded Protein Response operates as follows:\n1. ER stress causes PERK dimerization and activation, leading to phosphorylation of $eIF2\\alpha$ ($p-eIF2\\alpha$). This globally inhibits cap-dependent translation initiation, thereby reducing protein load on the ER, while selectively permitting translation of specific mRNAs, notably ATF4.\n2. ATF4 induces expression of stress-response genes, including GADD34. GADD34 associates with Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) to form a complex that dephosphorylates $p-eIF2\\alpha$. This constitutes a negative feedback loop that terminates translational repression once stress subsides.\n\nUnder the experimental protocol with transient stress followed by recovery:\n- During stress, both WT and GADD34-null cells activate PERK and accumulate $p-eIF2\\alpha$, resulting in decreased global translation; thus, the initial reduction in protein synthesis is intact in both lines.\n- Upon stress removal, PERK signaling diminishes. In WT cells, induced GADD34 recruits PP1 to efficiently dephosphorylate $eIF2\\alpha$, allowing global translation to recover toward baseline in a timely manner.\n- In GADD34 loss-of-function cells, this negative feedback is compromised. Although basal phosphatases (such as CReP-associated PP1) may contribute slowly, the absence of GADD34-targeted PP1 greatly reduces the rate of $p-eIF2\\alpha$ dephosphorylation. Consequently, $p-eIF2\\alpha$ persists longer, prolonging translational repression and delaying the recovery of global protein synthesis relative to WT.\n\nTherefore:\n- Faster recovery (A) is inconsistent with loss of the key negative feedback effector.\n- Inability to reduce protein synthesis during stress (C) is incorrect because PERK is intact and can phosphorylate $eIF2\\alpha$ normally.\n- Identical recovery (D) is contradicted by the missing feedback.\n- An overshoot above baseline (E) is not expected when dephosphorylation is impaired; if anything, translation remains suppressed longer.\n\nThus, the mutant will show a significantly delayed recovery of global protein synthesis compared to WT.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2345347"}]}
