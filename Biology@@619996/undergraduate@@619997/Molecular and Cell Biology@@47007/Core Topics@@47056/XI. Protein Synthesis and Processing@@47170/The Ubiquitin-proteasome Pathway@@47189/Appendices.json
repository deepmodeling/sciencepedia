It is hypothesized that Protein K is targeted for degradation by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). To test this hypothesis, the biologist prepares a synchronized cell culture in which Protein K is synthesized at a constant rate. At time $t=0$, a potent and specific proteasome inhibitor is added to the culture medium.\n\nThe researcher measures three quantities over time for $t>0$:\n1. The total cellular concentration of Protein K (both modified and unmodified forms).\n2. The concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K.\n3. The abundance of the mRNA that codes for Protein K.\n\nAssume the proteasome inhibitor acts instantaneously, is 100% effective at blocking proteasome activity, and has no other effects on cellular processes. Furthermore, assume there are no feedback mechanisms where the concentration of Protein K affects its own transcription or translation.\n\nWhich of the following sets of observations would be expected if the hypothesis that Protein K is degraded by the UPS is correct?\n\nA. The total concentration of Protein K will increase, the concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K will increase, and the abundance of Protein K mRNA will remain relatively constant.\n\nB. The total concentration of Protein K will increase, the concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K will decrease, and the abundance of Protein K mRNA will remain relatively constant.\n\nC. The total concentration of Protein K will increase, the concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K will increase, and the abundance of Protein K mRNA will decrease.\n\nD. The total concentration of Protein K will remain constant, the concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K will decrease, and the abundance of Protein K mRNA will increase.\n\nE. The total concentration of Protein K will decrease, the concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K will decrease, and the abundance of Protein K mRNA will remain relatively constant.", "solution": "Let $P(t)$ denote the concentration of unmodified Protein K, $U(t)$ the concentration of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K, $T(t)=P(t)+U(t)$ the total Protein K (modified plus unmodified), and $M(t)$ the abundance of Protein K mRNA.\n\nAssume Protein K is synthesized at a constant rate $\\sigma>0$ into the unmodified pool. Let ubiquitination proceed at rate $k_{u}P(t)$, and proteasomal degradation remove only the poly-ubiquitinated form at rate $k_{d}U(t)$. The inhibitor at $t=0$ sets the proteasomal activity to zero instantaneously and specifically, so for $t>0$ we have $k_{d}=0$. There is no feedback from protein levels to transcription or translation, and the inhibitor has no other effects; thus $M(t)$ remains at its pre-inhibition level.\n\nFor $t>0$, the governing relations are:\n- Synthesis: adds $\\sigma$ to $P(t)$.\n- Ubiquitination: transfers mass from $P(t)$ to $U(t)$ at rate $k_{u}P(t)$.\n- Proteasomal degradation: removed, since $k_{d}=0$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt}=k_{u}P(t),\n$$\nand the total protein satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt}=\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(P(t)+U(t)\\big)=\\sigma,\n$$\nbecause ubiquitination conserves total Protein K and there is no degradation when $k_{d}=0$. Hence $T(t)$ increases monotonically for $t>0$. Moreover, since $P(t)$ remains positive and $k_{u}>0$, the source term $k_{u}P(t)$ is nonzero, so $U(t)$ increases for $t>0$ when the proteasome is blocked. Finally, with no feedback and no off-target effects, $M(t)$ is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt}=0.\n$$\n\nThus, upon proteasome inhibition when Protein K is degraded by the UPS, the expected observations are: total Protein K increases, poly-ubiquitinated Protein K increases, and Protein K mRNA remains relatively constant.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches these predictions.\n- B incorrectly predicts a decrease of poly-ubiquitinated Protein K.\n- C incorrectly predicts a decrease of mRNA.\n- D incorrectly predicts constant total protein and decreasing poly-ubiquitinated Protein K with increasing mRNA.\n- E incorrectly predicts a decrease of total Protein K.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345177"}, {"introduction": "Protein degradation is not just about marking a protein for destruction; it's a highly regulated, dynamic process. This exercise explores the crucial counter-regulatory role of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which act as a 'rescue' mechanism. By considering the effect of a DUB inhibitor on Cyclin B during the cell cycle [@problem_id:2345211], you will grapple with the concept of dynamic equilibrium and see how tipping the balance can have profound physiological consequences.", "problem": "In a research laboratory, a cell biologist is studying the G2/M transition of the cell cycle in a synchronized culture of human cells. This transition is critically dependent on the activity of a complex formed by Cyclin B and a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK). The concentration of Cyclin B must rise to a sufficient level during the G2 phase to trigger entry into mitosis. The subsequent destruction of Cyclin B is then required for exiting mitosis. This degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n\nA key feature of this system is its dynamic regulation. While some enzymes add ubiquitin tags to proteins to mark them for degradation, a class of enzymes known as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can remove these ubiquitin tags, thereby rescuing the protein from degradation.\n\nThe biologist treats the cell culture with a newly developed, highly specific chemical inhibitor, \"Dubinib,\" which can permeate the cell membrane and potently inhibit the activity of all known DUBs. The treatment begins while the cells are in the G2 phase, when Cyclin B levels are normally rising.\n\nAssuming Dubinib has no other effects on the cell, what is the most likely immediate consequence of this treatment on the half-life of Cyclin B and the progression of the cell cycle?\n\nA. The half-life of Cyclin B will decrease, and the cells may fail to enter mitosis.\n\nB. The half-life of Cyclin B will increase, and the cells will become arrested in the G2 phase.\n\nC. The half-life of Cyclin B will remain unchanged because cyclin degradation is primarily controlled by its synthesis rate, not by DUBs.\n\nD. The half-life of Cyclin B will increase because Dubinib will cause a general inhibition of the proteasome itself.\n\nE. The half-life of Cyclin B will decrease, but the cells will proceed into mitosis more rapidly.", "solution": "Cyclin B levels in G2 are governed by the balance between synthesis and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Let $[C](t)$ denote Cyclin B concentration. A standard kinetic model is\n$$\n\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_{s} - k_{d}[C],\n$$\nwhere $k_{s}$ is the zero-order synthesis rate and $k_{d}$ is the first-order effective degradation constant reflecting ubiquitin tagging and proteasomal turnover. The half-life is\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{d}}.\n$$\n\nIn the ubiquitin-proteasome system, E3 ligases add ubiquitin chains to substrates, marking them for degradation, while deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin, counteracting degradation. Inhibition of DUBs by Dubinib reduces deubiquitination, thereby increasing the steady-state fraction of polyubiquitinated Cyclin B available for proteasomal recognition. This increases the effective degradation rate constant from $k_{d}$ to a larger $k_{d}^{\\prime}$, so\n$$\nk_{d}^{\\prime} > k_{d} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t_{1/2}^{\\prime} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{d}^{\\prime}}  \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{d}} = t_{1/2}.\n$$\n\nThe steady-state level under constant synthesis is\n$$\n[C]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}},\n$$\nso increasing $k_{d}$ to $k_{d}^{\\prime}$ lowers $[C]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\n[C]_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\prime} = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}^{\\prime}}  \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} = [C]_{\\mathrm{ss}}.\n$$\nEntry into mitosis requires Cyclin B to reach a threshold concentration $[C]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ to activate Cdk1. With $k_{d}^{\\prime}$ elevated by DUB inhibition, $[C](t)$ rises more slowly and may not attain $[C]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, leading to failure or delay in entering mitosis. Because Dubinib is specified to inhibit DUBs and not the proteasome itself, there is no basis for an increased half-life via proteasome inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence is a decreased half-life of Cyclin B and a likely failure to enter mitosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345211"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists measure the stability of a protein and quantify the effect of a mutation? This problem walks you through the logic of a classic pulse-chase experiment, a powerful technique to measure protein turnover rates. By analyzing hypothetical data from an experiment on a cell-cycle inhibitor [@problem_id:2345213], you will apply the principles of first-order kinetics to calculate and compare the half-lives of a wild-type and mutant protein, bridging conceptual knowledge with practical data analysis.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the stability of a key regulatory protein, the Cell Division Kinase Inhibitor 1 (CDKI-1). The degradation of CDKI-1 is crucial for cell cycle progression and is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process is initiated when a specific sequence on CDKI-1, known as a degron, is recognized and bound by an E3 ubiquitin ligase.\n\nTo quantify the importance of this degron, the biologist creates two cell lines. One expresses the normal, wild-type (WT) CDKI-1. The other expresses a mutant version (mutant) of CDKI-1, in which a critical amino acid within the degron has been substituted, putatively impairing its recognition by the E3 ligase.\n\nA pulse-chase experiment is performed on both cell lines. The cells are first briefly incubated in a medium containing a radiolabeled amino acid, which gets incorporated into all newly synthesized proteins (the \"pulse\"). They are then transferred to a medium containing a vast excess of the same, but non-radiolabeled, amino acid (the \"chase\"). This ensures that no more radiolabeled protein is synthesized after time $t=0$.\n\nThe total amount of radiolabeled CDKI-1 is measured immediately after the pulse at $t=0$ and is found to be an initial amount $C_0$ for both cell lines. After a chase period of $T = 40.0$ minutes, the amount of remaining radiolabeled protein is measured again via immunoprecipitation and scintillation counting. The results are as follows:\n-   Wild-type (WT): The remaining amount of radiolabeled CDKI-1 is $0.0625 C_0$.\n-   Mutant: The remaining amount of radiolabeled CDKI-1 is $0.250 C_0$.\n\nAssume that the degradation of both the wild-type and mutant proteins follows first-order kinetics and that the mutation does not affect the protein's rate of synthesis or its intrinsic stability apart from proteasome-mediated degradation.
