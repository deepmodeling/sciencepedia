This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario involving a novel antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis. By analyzing the state of the stalled ribosome, you can deduce the specific chemical reaction being disrupted, allowing you to dissect the termination process into its sequential components: recognition and catalysis [@problem_id:2346462].", "problem": "A new antibiotic, Aurosporin, is discovered and found to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. In an in vitro translation experiment using *E. coli* extracts, ribosomes are allowed to translate a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that includes a stop codon. When Aurosporin is added to the reaction, it is observed that fully synthesized polypeptide chains accumulate but remain covalently attached to their respective transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which are stalled in the P-site of the ribosome. Further analysis confirms that a protein Release Factor (RF) is correctly bound to the stop codon in the A-site.\n\nBased on this observation, which of the following specific chemical reactions in the process of translation termination is most directly inhibited by Aurosporin?\n\nA. The binding of the Class I Release Factor (RF1 or RF2) to the stop codon in the ribosomal A-site.\n\nB. The hydrolysis of the ester bond connecting the polypeptide chain to the tRNA in the P-site.\n\nC. The Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis that facilitates the release of the Class I RF from the ribosome.\n\nD. The release of the deacylated tRNA from the P- and E-sites after polypeptide release.\n\nE. The dissociation of the 70S ribosome into its 30S and 50S subunits.", "solution": "We are told that, upon addition of Aurosporin to an in vitro translation reaction, fully synthesized polypeptide chains accumulate but remain covalently attached to their tRNA molecules in the P-site, while a Class I release factor is correctly bound to the stop codon in the A-site. In bacterial translation termination, the orderly sequence of events is:\n\n1) A Class I release factor (RF1 or RF2) recognizes and binds the stop codon in the A-site. This recognition event is upstream of catalytic hydrolysis and does not itself release the polypeptide.\n\n2) The Class I release factor, via its conserved GGQ motif acting in the peptidyl transferase center, catalyzes hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide to the tRNA at the P-site. The core chemical step is ester hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA linkage:\n$$\n\\text{Pep-tRNA}^P + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\to \\text{Pep} + \\text{tRNA}^P_{3'\\text{-OH}}.\n$$\nHere, $\\text{Pep-tRNA}^P$ denotes the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, and the products are a free polypeptide and deacylated tRNA with a restored $3'$-hydroxyl.\n\n3) After peptide release, a Class II release factor (RF3) uses GTP hydrolysis to promote dissociation of the Class I RF from the ribosome. This GTP hydrolysis step occurs after peptide release.\n\n4) Subsequently, the deacylated tRNA is released from the P- and E-sites, and finally the 70S ribosome can dissociate into its subunits to reset for another round.\n\nThe observation that polypeptide chains remain covalently attached to P-site tRNA demonstrates that the ester bond between the polypeptide and the tRNA has not been hydrolyzed. Since a Class I RF is already bound at the stop codon in the A-site, the binding step (choice A) is not inhibited. If GTP hydrolysis by RF3 were blocked (choice C), peptide hydrolysis would already have occurred before RF recycling; thus we would observe free peptide rather than peptidyl-tRNA. If release of deacylated tRNA (choice D) were inhibited, the tRNA would already be deacylated; again this contradicts the observed covalent attachment. If ribosome subunit dissociation (choice E) were inhibited, that also occurs downstream of peptide release and would not prevent hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester.\n\nTherefore, the specific chemical reaction most directly inhibited is the hydrolysis of the ester bond connecting the polypeptide to the P-site tRNA, i.e., the reaction\n$$\n\\text{Pep-tRNA}^P + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\to \\text{Pep} + \\text{tRNA}^P_{3'\\text{-OH}},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to choice B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2346462"}, {"introduction": "Building on the sequence of events in termination, this practice explores the critical concept of molecular specificity. In bacteria, different release factors recognize different stop codons. This thought experiment models a genetically engineered cell lacking one of its key release factors, prompting you to predict the direct consequences for a translating ribosome. This scenario underscores how the system's fidelity relies on a precise \"lock-and-key\" interaction between the stop codon in the mRNA and the corresponding release factor protein [@problem_id:2346469].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the termination of protein synthesis is a critical step mediated by proteins known as Release Factors (RFs). The process begins when a ribosome encounters one of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in its A-site. The specificity of recognition is as follows: Release Factor 1 (RF1) recognizes the stop codons UAA and UAG, while Release Factor 2 (RF2) recognizes UAA and UGA. Upon binding to the A-site, the appropriate release factor induces the hydrolysis of the bond connecting the polypeptide chain to the transfer RNA (tRNA) in the P-site, thereby freeing the newly synthesized protein.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of *E. coli* in which the gene encoding RF1 has been inactivated, rendering the cell incapable of producing functional RF1 protein. The genes for RF2 and all other components of the translational machinery, including ribosomes and tRNAs, remain fully functional.\n\nA ribosome in a cell of this mutant strain is actively translating a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The process proceeds normally until the ribosome's A-site is positioned over a UAG codon. What is the most immediate and direct outcome for this specific ribosome and its nascent polypeptide chain?\n\nA. The polypeptide chain is released, but the ribosome remains bound to the mRNA.\n\nB. RF2 binds to the A-site and successfully mediates the release of the polypeptide chain.\n\nC. A suppressor tRNA binds to the UAG codon, adding an amino acid and allowing translation to continue.\n\nD. The ribosome stalls at the UAG codon, and the polypeptide remains covalently attached to the tRNA in the P-site.\n\nE. The ribosome disassembles, prematurely releasing the incomplete polypeptide chain and the mRNA.", "solution": "1) State the specificity of bacterial release factors as given: RF1 recognizes the set $S_{\\text{RF1}}=\\{\\text{UAA, UAG}\\}$ and RF2 recognizes the set $S_{\\text{RF2}}=\\{\\text{UAA, UGA}\\}$.\n\n2) In the engineered strain, RF1 is absent (nonfunctional), while RF2 is functional. Therefore, the only stop codons that can be recognized for termination are those in $S_{\\text{RF2}}$.\n\n3) The ribosomal A-site encounters the codon $c=\\text{UAG}$. Test for RF recognition: since $\\text{UAG} \\notin S_{\\text{RF2}}$, no release factor can bind the A-site at this codon.\n\n4) The biochemical step of termination requires a release factorâ€™s GGQ-mediated catalysis of hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the nascent polypeptide to the P-site tRNA. Without an RF bound at the A-site, this hydrolysis reaction does not proceed, so the polypeptide remains covalently attached to the P-site tRNA.\n\n5) An elongator aminoacyl-tRNA cannot normally base-pair to a stop codon; binding of a suppressor tRNA would be a special, nonstandard event and is not implied by the problem. Thus, the immediate and direct consequence is not continuation of elongation but a kinetic stall.\n\n6) Rescue mechanisms (e.g., trans-translation by tmRNA-SmpB or alternative ribosome rescue factors) can act subsequently to resolve stalled ribosomes, but these are not immediate. Therefore, the most immediate and direct outcome is a stall at $\\text{UAG}$ with the peptidyl-tRNA still in the P-site.\n\nConclusion: The correct choice is that the ribosome stalls at the UAG codon, and the polypeptide remains covalently attached to the tRNA in the P-site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2346469"}, {"introduction": "Scientific principles are established through careful experimentation.
