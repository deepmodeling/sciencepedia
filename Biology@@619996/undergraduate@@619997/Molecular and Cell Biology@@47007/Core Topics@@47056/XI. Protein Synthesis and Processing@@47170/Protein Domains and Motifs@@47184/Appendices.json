By analyzing the structural features of their distinct, non-catalytic domains, you will practice deducing a protein's subcellular destination based on well-established targeting motifs. This skill is fundamental to understanding how cellular processes are spatially organized and regulated. [@problem_id:2332933]", "problem": "In a eukaryotic organism, two distinct genes encode for two different enzyme isoforms, designated `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B`. Both proteins are phosphatases, and molecular analysis reveals that they share an identical N-terminal domain which contains the active site responsible for their catalytic activity. However, their C-terminal domains are completely different.\n\n- The C-terminal domain of `Phosphatase-A` features a short sequence motif characterized by a high concentration of positively charged amino acids, specifically Lysine and Arginine.\n- The C-terminal domain of `Phosphatase-B` consists of a single alpha-helix, approximately 20 amino acids in length and composed almost entirely of hydrophobic residues. This helix is located at the very end of the polypeptide chain.\n\nGiven this structural information, which of the following statements describes the most likely functional difference between `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B`?\n\nA. `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B` operate in different subcellular locations.\n\nB. `Phosphatase-A` has a higher substrate affinity (lower $K_m$) than `Phosphatase-B`.\n\nC. `Phosphatase-A` is an allosterically regulated enzyme, while `Phosphatase-B` is not.\n\nD. `Phosphatase-A` dephosphorylates serine residues, while `Phosphatase-B` dephosphorylates tyrosine residues.\n\nE. `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B` have significantly different protein half-lives within the cell.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires an understanding of how protein domains dictate protein function, particularly with respect to cellular localization.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the shared component. Both `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B` possess an identical N-terminal catalytic domain. Since the active site is within this domain, it is highly probable that they catalyze the same fundamental chemical reaction. This makes it unlikely that they would have different substrate specificities (e.g., serine vs. tyrosine, as in option D) or fundamentally different kinetic properties that are intrinsic to the active site itself.\n\nNext, we must interpret the functions of the differing C-terminal domains. These non-catalytic domains often confer unique properties such as localization, regulation, or interaction with other molecules.\n\nThe C-terminal domain of `Phosphatase-A` is described as a short motif rich in positively charged amino acids (Lysine and Arginine). This is the classic signature of a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS). An NLS acts as a \"tag\" that is recognized by importin proteins, which then mediate the transport of the protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. Therefore, `Phosphatase-A` is very likely targeted to the nucleus.\n\nThe C-terminal domain of `Phosphatase-B` is described as a C-terminal alpha-helix of about 20 hydrophobic amino acids. This is a characteristic feature of a \"tail-anchor\" or a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Such domains are capable of inserting into a lipid bilayer, anchoring the protein to a membrane. Common destinations for tail-anchored proteins include the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. The functional N-terminal catalytic domain would then face the cytoplasm. Therefore, `Phosphatase-B` is very likely a membrane-associated protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\nA. `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B` operate in different subcellular locations. This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The NLS on `Phosphatase-A` targets it to the nucleus, while the tail-anchor on `Phosphatase-B` targets it to a membrane. This is the most direct and certain consequence of the described domain structures.\n\nB. `Phosphatase-A` has a higher substrate affinity (lower $K_m$) than `Phosphatase-B`. While it is possible for a non-catalytic domain to allosterically modulate the active site, the described domains are very strong, canonical signals for localization. A difference in localization is a much more direct and significant functional distinction than a potential subtle change in enzyme kinetics.\n\nC. `Phosphatase-A` is an allosterically regulated enzyme, while `Phosphatase-B` is not. The described domains are not typical allosteric regulatory domains. While their presence in different locations might expose them to different regulatory molecules, this option makes a specific claim about allostery that is not directly supported by the structural information.\n\nD. `Phosphatase-A` dephosphorylates serine residues, while `Phosphatase-B` dephosphorylates tyrosine residues. Substrate specificity is primarily determined by the shape and chemical properties of the active site. Since the catalytic domains are identical, a drastic difference in substrate class is highly improbable.\n\nE. `Phosphatase-A` and `Phosphatase-B` have significantly different protein half-lives within the cell. Protein half-life is often determined by specific degradation signals (e.g., PEST sequences). The NLS and tail-anchor are not primarily degradation signals. While localization can indirectly affect stability, it's not the primary function implied by these domains.\n\nBased on the evidence, the most confident and direct conclusion is that the different C-terminal domains serve to target the identical catalytic activity to distinct compartments within the cell. This allows the cell to regulate the phosphorylation status of different sets of proteins—one set in the nucleus and another at a cellular membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332933"}, {"introduction": "Moving from localization to regulation, we explore how domains within a single protein can interact to control its function. This problem presents a hypothetical kinase that uses an elegant mechanism of autoinhibition, where one domain acts as a built-in \"off switch\" for another. By analyzing the effect of a mutation that disrupts this internal regulation, you will delve into the logic of molecular switches and how protein architecture dictates enzymatic activity. [@problem_id:2332890]", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, the Regulatory Kinase Alpha (RKA), is a key component in a newly discovered signaling pathway. RKA is a single polypeptide chain composed of two distinct functional domains: an N-terminal Regulatory Domain (RD) and a C-terminal Catalytic Domain (CD). These two domains are connected by a flexible polypeptide linker.\n\nThe activity of the wild-type RKA is tightly controlled by an allosteric activator, Molecule-Z. In the absence of Molecule-Z, the flexible linker allows the RD to fold back and bind to the active site of the CD. This interaction acts as a form of autoinhibition, rendering the enzyme catalytically inert. When Molecule-Z binds to a specific site on the RD, it induces a conformational change that causes the RD to dissociate from the CD, thereby exposing the active site and activating the enzyme.\n\nA researcher introduces a mutation into the gene encoding RKA. This mutation results in a deletion of a segment of the polypeptide linker, making it significantly shorter. Structural modeling and biophysical measurements confirm that the shortened linker is now too short to allow the RD to physically reach and occlude the active site on the CD, regardless of whether Molecule-Z is bound. The mutation does not alter the intrinsic folding or catalytic function of the CD, nor does it affect the ability of the RD to bind Molecule-Z.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected kinetic properties of this mutant RKA enzyme?\n\nA. The mutant enzyme will be permanently inactive because the shorter linker locks the regulatory domain onto the catalytic domain.\n\nB. The mutant enzyme will exhibit catalytic activity, but its affinity for its primary substrate will be significantly lower (i.e., a much higher Michaelis constant, $K_M$) than the activated wild-type enzyme.\n\nC. The mutant enzyme will be constitutively active, displaying high catalytic activity that is independent of the concentration of Molecule-Z.\n\nD.
