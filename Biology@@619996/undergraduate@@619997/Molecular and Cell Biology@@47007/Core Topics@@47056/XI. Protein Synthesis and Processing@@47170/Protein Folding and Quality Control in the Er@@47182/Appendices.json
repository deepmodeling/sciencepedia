{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of a secretory or membrane protein through the cell is not random; it is directed by specific molecular address labels. The first critical step for these proteins is entry into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which serves as the gateway to the entire secretory pathway. This exercise [@problem_id:2333124] challenges you to apply your knowledge of this initial targeting event by considering a classic molecular genetics scenario: what happens to a protein's final destination when its ER \"entry ticket,\" the N-terminal signal sequence, is removed?", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a novel human protein named \"Aquaporin-X,\" which is normally a transmembrane protein located in the plasma membrane responsible for water transport. The synthesis of this protein follows the standard secretory pathway, beginning with its translocation into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The genetic sequence for Aquaporin-X encodes a specific N-terminal signal sequence that directs the ribosome synthesizing it to the ER membrane.\n\nUsing gene-editing technology, the researchers create a modified version of the Aquaporin-X gene. This modification precisely deletes the portion of the gene that codes for the N-terminal signal sequence, but leaves the rest of the protein sequence, including its transmembrane domains, completely intact. This modified gene is then introduced into and expressed by a culture of human cells that do not normally produce Aquaporin-X.\n\nAssuming the resulting mutant protein can fold into a stable conformation and is not targeted for degradation, which of the following describes the most likely final, steady-state location of the majority of these mutant Aquaporin-X proteins within the cell?\n\nA. The plasma membrane\n\nB. The cytosol\n\nC. The lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum\n\nD. The Golgi apparatus\n\nE. The mitochondrial inner membrane", "solution": "The question asks for the final cellular location of a modified transmembrane protein, Aquaporin-X, whose N-terminal signal sequence has been deleted. To determine this, we must trace the protein's synthesis and targeting pathway.\n\nProteins destined for the secretory pathway, which includes the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, plasma membrane, or secretion from the cell, begin their synthesis on ribosomes in the cytosol. The key element that diverts these proteins from a cytosolic fate is an N-terminal signal sequence, a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the beginning of the polypeptide chain.\n\nThe process, known as co-translational translocation, proceeds as follows:\n1.  As the N-terminal signal sequence emerges from the ribosome during translation, it is recognized and bound by a ribonucleoprotein complex called the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP).\n2.  Binding of the SRP to the signal sequence and the ribosome causes a pause in translation.\n3.  The entire complex (SRP-ribosome-nascent polypeptide) is then recruited to the membrane of the ER, where the SRP binds to an SRP receptor.\n4.  This interaction brings the ribosome to a protein translocator complex (the translocon) in the ER membrane. The SRP and its receptor are released.\n5.  Translation resumes, and the growing polypeptide chain is threaded through the translocon channel into the ER lumen. For a transmembrane protein like Aquaporin-X, specific \"stop-transfer\" sequences within the polypeptide will anchor it into the ER membrane.\n\nIn the scenario described, the gene for Aquaporin-X has been modified to delete the N-terminal signal sequence.\n- When this modified gene is transcribed and translated, the nascent polypeptide chain will lack the signal sequence.\n- Without the signal sequence, the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) will not bind to the ribosome-polypeptide complex.\n- Consequently, translation will not pause, and the ribosome will not be directed to the ER membrane.\n- The ribosome will remain a \"free ribosome\" in the cytosol and complete the synthesis of the entire mutant Aquaporin-X protein there.\n- Once synthesis is complete, the full-length protein is released into the cytosol.\n\nSince the mutant protein lacks any other targeting signals (like a mitochondrial or nuclear localization signal), and it has been deprived of its only ticket into the secretory pathway (the ER signal sequence), it will remain where it was synthesized. Therefore, the final, steady-state location of the mutant Aquaporin-X proteins will be the cytosol.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. The plasma membrane: This is the correct destination for the wild-type protein, but reaching it requires entry into the ER-Golgi pathway, which is blocked by the deletion of the signal sequence.\nB. The cytosol: This is the correct answer. Synthesis occurs on free ribosomes and without a signal sequence, the protein remains in the cytosol.\nC. The lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum: To enter the ER lumen, the protein needs a signal sequence. Its deletion prevents this.\nD. The Golgi apparatus: This is a subsequent destination after the ER. If the protein cannot enter the ER, it can never reach the Golgi.\nE. The mitochondrial inner membrane: Targeting to the mitochondria requires a specific mitochondrial targeting signal, which Aquaporin-X does not possess. This is an incorrect destination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2333124"}, {"introduction": "Once a glycoprotein enters the ER, how can we track its progress through the secretory pathway toward its final destination? Scientists use clever biochemical tools that exploit the modifications proteins undergo as they travel, turning these changes into readable signals. This problem [@problem_id:2333120] guides you through the interpretation of data from a classic pulse-chase experiment, a powerful technique for studying dynamic cellular processes. You will learn to use the differential sensitivity of a protein to the enzyme Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) to determine what fraction of a protein population has successfully moved from the ER to the Golgi complex.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the intracellular trafficking of a newly identified transmembrane protein, which we'll call Protein Z. The predicted molecular weight of the Protein Z polypeptide backbone is 45.0 kilodaltons (kDa). Like many transmembrane proteins, Protein Z undergoes N-linked glycosylation, a process that begins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and is further modified in the Golgi apparatus.\n\nTo determine the kinetics of its transport from the ER to the Golgi, the biologist performs a pulse-chase experiment. They culture cells expressing Protein Z, briefly expose them to radioactive amino acids (the \"pulse\"), and then transfer them to a medium containing non-radioactive amino acids (the \"chase\"). After a chase period of 60 minutes, the cells are lysed. The lysate is then divided into two equal aliquots.\n\nOne aliquot is kept as a control. The second aliquot is treated with Endoglycosidase H (EndoH), an enzyme that specifically cleaves the high-mannose core oligosaccharides attached to proteins residing in the ER. However, EndoH cannot cleave the complex oligosaccharides that are formed once a protein has been processed in the medial-Golgi.\n\nBoth aliquots are then analyzed by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography to visualize the radioactive Protein Z.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n1.  In the untreated control aliquot, the autoradiogram shows two distinct bands: a prominent band at 53.0 kDa and a fainter band at 57.0 kDa.\n2.  In the aliquot treated with EndoH, the autoradiogram also shows two bands: one band at 45.0 kDa and another band that remains at 57.0 kDa.\n3.  Quantitative densitometry of the bands in the EndoH-treated sample reveals that the total signal intensity of the 45.0 kDa band is 480 arbitrary units, and the total signal intensity of the 57.0 kDa band is 1920 arbitrary units.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the fraction of the total labeled Protein Z population that has successfully trafficked to or beyond the medial-Golgi by the 60-minute time point. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The key biochemical principle is Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) sensitivity: N-linked glycans in the ER or early Golgi are high-mannose and EndoH-sensitive, so EndoH treatment removes them and collapses those species to the unglycosylated polypeptide at 45.0 kDa. Once a protein reaches the medial-Golgi, its N-glycans are processed to complex forms that are EndoH-resistant, so EndoH does not shift their apparent molecular weight.\n\nIn the EndoH-treated sample, the 45.0 kDa band corresponds to the EndoH-sensitive population (ER/early Golgi), while the 57.0 kDa band corresponds to the EndoH-resistant population (medial-Golgi or beyond).

This final practice [@problem_id:2333142] explores the endpoint of ERAD by asking you to predict the consequences of inhibiting the cell's primary protein-degrading machine, the proteasome.

The biologist applies this drug to a culture of mammalian cells. The focus of the experiment is to track the fate of a particular nascent polypeptide that is destined to become a multi-pass transmembrane protein. This protein is synthesized on ribosomes attached to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane for folding. Due to its complex structure, a substantial fraction of this protein misfolds. In healthy, untreated cells, these misfolded proteins are efficiently removed by a quality control mechanism known as ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD).

Key mechanistic steps are: recognition of misfolded polypeptides in the ER or ER membrane, retrotranslocation (dislocation) across or from the ER membrane to the cytosolic side, polyubiquitination by ER membrane-resident E3 ligases on the cytosolic face, extraction by the cytosolic AAA-ATPase p97/VCP, and degradation by the cytosolic 26S proteasome.\n\n**Application to the substrate:** The misfolded, multi-pass transmembrane protein is recognized by ERAD-M machinery. It becomes polyubiquitinated on cytosol-exposed lysines while still associated with the ER membrane and is then extracted toward the cytosol by p97/VCP, coupling dislocation to proteasomal delivery.\n\n**Effect of proteasome inhibition:** Degradasome-Stop blocks the catalytic activity of the 26S proteasome. Upstream ERAD steps (recognition, polyubiquitination, and p97-mediated extraction/dislocation) can continue. Therefore, ERAD substrates become polyubiquitinated and delivered into the cytosol but cannot be degraded, leading to accumulation of polyubiquitinated substrates on the cytosolic side, often as cytosolic inclusions/aggregates near the ER.\n\n**Exclusion of alternatives:**\n*   **A. Attached to the luminal side of the ER membrane:** ubiquitination occurs on the cytosolic face; substrates are retrotranslocated out of the lumen before proteasomal degradation.\n*   **B. Golgi cisternae:** ERAD does not proceed via anterograde trafficking through the Golgi.\n*   **D. Inside the lumen of lysosomes:** ERAD substrates primarily use the proteasome, not lysosomes; although autophagy can compensate in some contexts, the primary and immediate accumulation upon proteasome inhibition is cytosolic.\n*   **E. Concentrated within the matrix of the mitochondria:** unrelated to ERAD routing.\n\n**Conclusion:** With the proteasome blocked, misfolded, polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates accumulate primarily in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2333142"}]}
