The tRNA anticodon must pair with this codon by Watson-Crick base pairing and in antiparallel orientation.

This principle allows a single tRNA anticodon to recognize more than one mRNA codon, which helps explain the degeneracy of the genetic code without requiring a unique tRNA for every single codon. This practice [@problem_id:2346201] explores a key example of wobble pairing involving the modified base inosine, allowing you to see how these expanded rules contribute to the fluency of protein synthesis.", "problem": "In the intricate process of protein synthesis, a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule acts as an adaptor, matching a specific codon on a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand to the corresponding amino acid. This recognition is mediated by the tRNA's anticodon loop. A key feature of this interaction is the \"wobble hypothesis,\" which allows for some non-standard base pairing at the third position of the codon and the first position of the anticodon.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment involving a specific tRNA molecule that has the anticodon sequence 3'-UAI-5'. In this sequence, 'I' represents the modified nucleobase inosine. The pairing of the mRNA codon, which is read in the 5' to 3' direction, with the tRNA anticodon occurs in an antiparallel fashion. The standard base pairing rules are that Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C). However, due to wobble, inosine (I) at the first position of the anticodon (the 5' end of the anticodon sequence) is capable of pairing with Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), or Uracil (U) in the third position of the mRNA codon.\n\nGiven these rules, which of the following sets represents all the possible mRNA codons that can be recognized by this tRNA with the anticodon 3'-UAI-5'?\n\nA. 5'-AUA-3', 5'-AUG-3', 5'-ACU-3'\n\nB. 5'-AUA-3', 5'-AUU-3', 5'-AUC-3'\n\nC. 5'-UAU-3', 5'-UAC-3'\n\nD. 5'-AUC-3' only\n\nE. 5'-AUA-3', 5'-AUU-3', 5'-AUC-3', 5'-AUG-3'", "solution": "The codon and anticodon bind antiparallel, so the 5' base of the mRNA codon pairs with the 3' base of the tRNA anticodon, the middle with the middle, and the 3' base of the codon pairs with the 5' base of the anticodon (the wobble position). The given anticodon is 3'-UAI-5'. Using standard pairing rules (A with U, G with C) and the wobble rule for inosine (I pairs with A, C, or U), we match positions as follows.\n\nAnticodon 3' base is U, pairing with the codon 5' base as A. Anticodon middle base is A, pairing with the codon middle base as U. Anticodon 5' base is I, which can pair with codon 3' base as A, C, or U due to wobble.

In this thought experiment [@problem_id:2346195], you will explore the consequences of disabling this energy source, a common technique in molecular biology to study reaction mechanisms. By determining exactly where the ribosome stalls, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the specific, energy-dependent steps that ensure the polypeptide chain grows correctly and the ribosome moves unidirectionally along the mRNA.", "problem": "An *in vitro* prokaryotic translation system is reconstituted from purified components. The system contains 70S ribosomes, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, all necessary charged transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and the required protein elongation factors. The ribosome has successfully initiated translation, with the initiator tRNA carrying N-formylmethionine (fMet-tRNA) properly positioned in the P site. The A site is currently vacant and positioned over the second codon of the mRNA.\n\nFor the elongation phase to proceed, this system is supplied with all the required components, except that the standard Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is completely replaced with `$GTP\\gamma S$`, a synthetic analog that can bind to GTP-binding proteins but cannot be hydrolyzed.\n\nGiven this setup, at which of the following stages will the translation elongation cycle be terminally arrested?\n\nA. The ribosome remains with a vacant A site because the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA complex cannot bind.\n\nB. An aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the A site, and the fMet is successfully transferred to it forming a dipeptide, but the ribosome is unable to translocate.\n\nC. The Elongation Factor G (EF-G)-$GTP\\gamma S$ complex binds to the ribosome, but translocation fails to occur, freezing the ribosome in a pre-translocation state.\n\nD. The ternary complex, consisting of Elongation Factor Thermo unstable (EF-Tu), `$GTP\\gamma S$`, and an aminoacyl-tRNA, binds to the A site but cannot dissociate, preventing peptide bond formation.\n\nE. The ribosome undergoes one full round of elongation and translocation, but becomes stalled when $EF-G-GTP\\gamma S$ remains bound to the ribosome after translocation, blocking the next cycle.", "solution": "The elongation cycle on a bacterial 70S ribosome proceeds through these obligatory steps once initiation has placed fMet-tRNA in the P site and the A site is positioned over the second codon:\n\n1) Delivery and initial selection: EF-Tu bound to GTP forms a ternary complex with an aminoacyl-tRNA. This ternary complex binds to the A site and samples codon-anticodon pairing. Correct pairing stimulates EF-Tu GTPase activity.\n\n2) GTP hydrolysis and accommodation: Hydrolysis of GTP on EF-Tu induces a conformational change that lowers EF-Tuâ€™s affinity for tRNA and the ribosome, allowing EF-Tu-GDP to dissociate. Only after EF-Tu release can the aminoacyl-tRNA fully accommodate into the peptidyl transferase center (A/A state). This accommodation is a prerequisite for peptidyl transfer.\n\n3) Peptidyl transfer: The ribosomal peptidyl transferase catalyzes peptide bond formation between the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site. This chemistry does not require GTP hydrolysis, but it strictly requires that the A-site tRNA be accommodated, which in turn requires prior EF-Tu GTP hydrolysis and release.\n\n4) Translocation: EF-G bound to GTP binds the pre-translocation ribosome and, upon GTP hydrolysis, drives movement of the tRNAs and mRNA to the next register, freeing the A site for the next cycle.\n\nNow replace GTP with the nonhydrolyzable analog `$GTP\\gamma S$`. `$GTP\\gamma S$` can bind GTPases (EF-Tu, EF-G) but cannot be hydrolyzed. Applying this to each step:\n\n- Step 1 proceeds: `$EF-Tu-GTP\\gamma S$` forms a ternary complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and can bind the A site with proper codon recognition.\n- Step 2 fails: Because `$GTP\\gamma S$` cannot be hydrolyzed, EF-Tu cannot undergo the hydrolysis-driven conformational change required for release. Consequently, the ternary complex remains ribosome-bound in the A/T state, and the aminoacyl-tRNA cannot accommodate into the peptidyl transferase center. Without accommodation, peptidyl transfer cannot occur.\n- Steps 3 and 4 therefore cannot be reached; EF-G action is irrelevant because the block occurs earlier.\n\nThis mechanistic analysis eliminates:\n- A: incorrect, because the ternary complex can bind the A site with `$GTP\\gamma S$`.\n- B: incorrect, because peptidyl transfer cannot occur without EF-Tu hydrolysis and release-driven accommodation.\n- C and E: incorrect, because the cycle stalls before EF-G engagement; EF-G-dependent translocation is never reached.\n\nThe stall point corresponds to the ternary complex binding but being unable to dissociate and permit accommodation, thereby preventing peptide bond formation, which matches option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2346195"}]}
