{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Phosphorylation is one of the most fundamental post-translational modifications, acting as a molecular switch that can turn a protein's function on or off. This process is not a one-way street; it is a dynamic equilibrium constantly managed by two opposing types of enzymes: kinases that add phosphate groups and phosphatases that remove them. This practice ([@problem_id:2331122]) challenges you to predict the functional outcome when this delicate balance is disrupted, providing a clear model for understanding how the steady-state activity of a signaling protein is controlled within a cell.", "problem": "In a signaling pathway crucial for cellular stress response, a protein named Stress Response Factor 1 (SRF1) acts as a molecular switch. The activity of SRF1 is regulated by a post-translational modification: it is active when phosphorylated at a single, specific threonine residue, and it is inactive when this residue is dephosphorylated. The phosphorylation status of SRF1 is controlled by the opposing actions of two enzymes that are always present and active in the cell's cytoplasm:\n\n1.  Upstream Kinase Alpha (UKA), which catalyzes the addition of a phosphate group to SRF1, thereby activating it.\n2.  Master Phosphatase 1 (MP1), which catalyzes the removal of this same phosphate group from SRF1, inactivating it.\n\nIn a normal cell, the continuous and competing activities of UKA and MP1 establish a dynamic equilibrium, resulting in a specific fraction of the total SRF1 pool being active at any given time.\n\nA scientist engineers a cell line with a specific loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the UKA enzyme. This mutation leads to the production of a UKA protein that is completely devoid of any kinase activity, though it is still produced at normal levels. The MP1 enzyme remains fully functional. Assume that the phosphorylation state of SRF1 solely governs its activity and has no effect on its expression level, stability, or localization within the cell.\n\nIn these mutant cells, which of the following best describes the predominant functional state of the SRF1 protein population?\n\nA. SRF1 will be constitutively active.\n\nB. SRF1 will be predominantly inactive.\n\nC. The overall activity of the SRF1 population will not change significantly compared to normal cells.\n\nD. SRF1 will be hyperphosphorylated.\n\nE. The concentration of SRF1 protein in the cytoplasm will decrease significantly.", "solution": "Let the total SRF1 concentration be constant and equal to $S_{\\text{tot}}$, with $S_{P}$ the phosphorylated (active) pool and $S_{D}$ the dephosphorylated (inactive) pool, so $S_{P}+S_{D}=S_{\\text{tot}}$. Define the active fraction $p$ by $p=\\frac{S_{P}}{S_{\\text{tot}}}$, so the inactive fraction is $1-p=\\frac{S_{D}}{S_{\\text{tot}}}$.\n\nLet $k_{\\text{UKA}}$ denote the effective first-order rate constant for phosphorylation by UKA and $k_{\\text{MP1}}$ the effective first-order rate constant for dephosphorylation by MP1. The kinetics of the active fraction are then\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt}=k_{\\text{UKA}}(1-p)-k_{\\text{MP1}}p.\n$$\nIn a normal cell at steady state, $\\frac{dp}{dt}=0$ gives\n$$\nk_{\\text{UKA}}(1-p^{\\ast})=k_{\\text{MP1}}p^{\\ast}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad p^{\\ast}=\\frac{k_{\\text{UKA}}}{k_{\\text{UKA}}+k_{\\text{MP1}}}.\n$$\nIn the mutant, the UKA protein is present but completely lacks kinase activity, so\n$$\nk_{\\text{UKA}}=0.\n$$\nSubstituting into the kinetics yields\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt}=-k_{\\text{MP1}}p,\n$$\nwhose solution decays to\n$$\np^{\\ast}=0.\n$$\nTherefore, in steady state, the SRF1 pool is entirely dephosphorylated and thus inactive. This rules out constitutive activity and hyperphosphorylation. Because the problem states that phosphorylation status has no effect on SRF1 expression, stability, or localization, the cytoplasmic concentration of SRF1 does not decrease; only its activity state changes. Hence the SRF1 population will be predominantly inactive.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2331122"}, {"introduction": "While phosphorylation is a key regulator of protein activity, post-translational modifications serve a wide array of functions. One crucial role is to act as a 'zip code,' directing a protein to its correct subcellular location where it can interact with its partners. This exercise ([@problem_id:2309464]) explores farnesylation, a type of lipid modification that anchors the critical signaling protein Ras to the plasma membrane, demonstrating that a protein's location can be just as important as its active state.", "problem": "The Ras family of proteins are key regulators of cellular signal transduction pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Ras acts as a molecular switch, cycling between an inactive state when bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and an active state when bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). For Ras to function correctly, it must be anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This localization is achieved via a post-translational modification called farnesylation, where the enzyme farnesyltransferase attaches a hydrophobic 15-carbon farnesyl lipid group to a cysteine residue at the C-terminus of the Ras protein.\n\nConsider a cell line that has a specific mutation in the gene encoding the Ras protein. This mutation changes the amino acid sequence at the C-terminus, preventing its recognition by farnesyltransferase. Consequently, the Ras protein produced in these cells cannot be farnesylated.\n\nAssuming the cell is stimulated by a growth factor that would normally activate the Ras signaling pathway, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the consequence of this failed farnesylation on the protein's cellular location and signaling activity?\n\nA. The Ras protein will be constitutively active and mislocalized to the cytosol, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.\n\nB. The Ras protein will be correctly localized to the plasma membrane but will be unable to bind GTP, thus remaining permanently inactive.\n\nC. The Ras protein will fail to anchor to the plasma membrane, accumulate in the cytosol, and remain in an inactive state, thereby blocking the signal transduction pathway.\n\nD. The Ras protein will be recognized as defective and immediately targeted for degradation by the proteasome, leading to its complete absence from the cell.\n\nE. The Ras protein will be mislocalized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it will erroneously trigger an apoptotic signaling cascade.", "solution": "Ras functions as a membrane-associated molecular switch, cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states. Its activation in response to growth factor stimulation requires recruitment of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS to activated receptor tyrosine kinases at the plasma membrane via adaptor proteins. For Ras to encounter SOS and downstream effectors (e.g., Raf), it must be localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.\n\nMembrane localization of Ras depends on post-translational prenylation, specifically farnesylation of a cysteine within the C-terminal CAAX motif by farnesyltransferase. This hydrophobic modification is necessary for membrane association; additional processing (AAX proteolysis and carboxymethylation) and, for some Ras isoforms, palmitoylation or a polybasic region further stabilize membrane binding. A mutation that disrupts farnesyltransferase recognition of the C-terminus prevents farnesylation, thereby abrogating plasma membrane anchoring.\n\nWithout farnesylation, Ras remains soluble in the cytosol and does not efficiently access membrane-localized GEFs or effectors. Consequently, GDP-to-GTP exchange is not promoted, Ras remains GDP-bound (inactive), and the downstream signaling cascade (e.g., Raf-MEK-ERK) is not propagated even in the presence of growth factor stimulation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because loss of farnesylation does not cause constitutive activation; it impairs activation.\n- B is incorrect because the mutation affects membrane localization, not intrinsic nucleotide binding; moreover, correct localization does not occur without farnesylation.\n- C is correct: failure to anchor leads to cytosolic accumulation and inactive Ras, blocking signaling.\n- D is incorrect: lack of farnesylation does not entail immediate proteasomal degradation.\n- E is incorrect: there is no mechanism redirecting Ras to mitochondria to trigger apoptosis in this context.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that Ras fails to anchor to the plasma membrane, accumulates in the cytosol, and remains inactive, blocking the pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2309464"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of molecular biology is not just understanding biological mechanisms, but knowing how to experimentally prove them. This final practice moves you from theory to the logic of experimental design, putting you in the shoes of a researcher testing a hypothesis about phosphorylation. By predicting the outcomes for wild-type, 'phospho-dead' (non-phosphorylatable), and 'phospho-mimetic' (charge-mimicking) protein variants ([@problem_id:2331137]), you will engage with the powerful tools scientists use to decipher the precise function of a single post-translational modification.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a signaling pathway involving a hypothetical protein called \"Transcription Factor for Growth\" (TFG). It is hypothesized that for TFG to become active and initiate gene transcription, it must be phosphorylated at a specific serine residue at position 55 (S55) by an upstream enzyme, Signal Kinase X (SKX).\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the biologist designs an experiment using a special cell line. These cells are engineered to express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) only when active TFG binds to a specific promoter sequence in their genome. The level of TFG activity can therefore be quantified by measuring the intensity of green fluorescence.\n\nThe biologist prepares three different versions of the TFG gene to be introduced into these cells:\n1.  **WT-TFG:** The standard, wild-type version of the protein.\n2.  **S55A-TFG:** A \"phospho-dead\" mutant created by site-directed mutagenesis, where the serine at position 55 is replaced by an alanine. Alanine's side chain cannot be phosphorylated.\n3.  **S55E-TFG:** A \"phospho-mimetic\" mutant, where the serine at position 55 is replaced by a glutamate. The negatively charged side chain of glutamate structurally mimics the negatively charged phosphate group.\n\nThe biologist sets up three experimental conditions and measures the resulting GFP fluorescence, categorizing the results as either \"High\" or \"Low/Basal\".\n\n-   **Condition 1:** Cells are made to express WT-TFG in the presence of fully active SKX.\n-   **Condition 2:** Cells are made to express S55A-TFG in the presence of fully active SKX.\n-   **Condition 3:** Cells are made to express S55E-TFG, but under conditions where SKX is completely inhibited by a specific small-molecule drug.\n\nAssuming the initial hypothesis is correct, which of the following options accurately predicts the relative GFP fluorescence levels for the three conditions?\n\nA.

Condition 1: Low/Basal; Condition 2: Low/Basal; Condition 3: High", "solution": "We are told the working hypothesis: TFG must be phosphorylated at residue S55 by SKX to become active and bind DNA to drive GFP expression. Therefore, TFG activity and hence GFP fluorescence should correlate with the presence of a negative charge at position 55 that mimics a phosphorylated serine, either via actual phosphorylation by SKX or via a phospho-mimetic substitution.\n\nAnalyze each condition under this hypothesis:\n\n- Condition 1 (WT-TFG with fully active SKX): WT-TFG contains serine at position 55, and SKX is active, so SKX can phosphorylate S55. This confers the necessary negative charge at position 55, activating TFG. Active TFG binds the promoter, driving GFP expression at a high level. Predicted GFP: High.\n\n- Condition 2 (S55A-TFG with fully active SKX): The S55A mutation removes the hydroxyl group necessary for phosphorylation. Even with active SKX, position 55 cannot be phosphorylated, so TFG remains inactive. Without activation, promoter binding is not achieved, and GFP remains low/basal. Predicted GFP: Low/Basal.\n\n- Condition 3 (S55E-TFG with SKX completely inhibited): The S55E mutation introduces a glutamate that provides a constitutive negative charge at position 55, mimicking the phosphorylated state. Thus, activation of TFG should occur independently of SKX activity. Even though SKX is inhibited, the phospho-mimetic residue enables activation, leading to high GFP. Predicted GFP: High.\n\nMapping these predictions to the options yields: Condition 1: High; Condition 2: Low/Basal; Condition 3: High, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2331137"}]}
