Each ribosome occupies a specific length of the mRNA, known as its \"footprint,\" and steric hindrance prevents them from getting too close. This first practice invites you to think like a molecular modeler, calculating the maximum packing density of ribosomes on a messenger RNA of a given length to understand the basic structural rules that define a polysome [@problem_id:2330932].", "problem": "A mature eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule is being actively translated by multiple ribosomes, a structure known as a polysome. The coding sequence of this mRNA, also called the Open Reading Frame (ORF), is precisely 900 nucleotides in length. We can number the nucleotide positions along the ORF from 1 (at the 5' end of the ORF) to 900 (at the 3' end).\n\nA single ribosome, when bound to the mRNA, occupies a \"footprint\" that covers a continuous segment of 30 nucleotides. The position of a given ribosome can be defined by the location of its P-site, which we will approximate as the center of its footprint. Let's say a ribosome is centered at nucleotide position $k$, its footprint will span from $k-14$ to $k+15$. Due to steric hindrance and other molecular interactions, the centers of any two adjacent ribosomes on the mRNA must be separated by a minimum distance of 105 nucleotides.\n\nTo be considered actively translating the ORF, the entire 30-nucleotide footprint of a ribosome must be contained within the 900-nucleotide ORF. What is the maximum number of ribosomes that can be simultaneously translating this ORF under these spatial constraints?", "solution": "Let the ORF occupy nucleotide positions from 1 to 900. A ribosome centered at integer position $k$ has a footprint from $k-14$ to $k+15$.

Therefore $n=9$ is both an upper bound and attainable.\n\nThus, the maximum number of ribosomes that can simultaneously translate the ORF under the given constraints is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "2330932"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static packing, the density of ribosomes on an mRNA is a dynamic property, reflecting a balance between how fast ribosomes hop on (initiation) and how fast they move along the transcript (elongation). This exercise models translation as a traffic flow problem, where a \"traffic jam\" can occur if one step becomes the bottleneck. By analyzing how a drug that slows elongation affects ribosome density, you will explore the crucial concept of rate-limiting steps in determining the steady-state appearance of a polysome [@problem_id:2330930].", "problem": "In a cell-free translation system designed to study the effects of a new experimental drug, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) is being translated into protein. Under normal, steady-state conditions, ribosomes initiate translation on this mRNA at an intrinsic rate of $R_{init} = 0.12$ ribosomes per second. Each ribosome moves along the mRNA with an average elongation velocity of $v_{elong} = 18$ nucleotides per second. The physical size of a ribosome covers a segment of the mRNA, known as the ribosome footprint, which is $L_{ribo} = 30$ nucleotides long. Ribosomes cannot overlap.\n\nThe experimental drug is then introduced into the system. This drug is known to specifically inhibit the transpeptidation step of elongation, but it does not affect the intrinsic initiation rate or the ribosome footprint size.

They have two synthetic messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) constructs, both encoding the exact same 500-amino-acid polypeptide. The two constructs are:\n\n1.  `mRNA_optimal`: This mRNA was designed using codon optimization. For each amino acid in the polypeptide sequence, the most frequently used codon in highly expressed *E. coli* genes was selected. These common codons correspond to abundant transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules in the cell.\n2.  `mRNA_rare`: This mRNA was designed as an experimental control.
