{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our exploration begins with the heart of the *lac* operon's negative control system: the repressor protein. This exercise challenges you to think about the repressor not just as a simple blocker, but as an allosteric protein with distinct domains for binding DNA and sensing the environment. By analyzing the \"super-repressor\" mutant, `$lacI^S$`, you can deduce how a change in one function—the ability to bind the inducer—can fundamentally lock the operon in a repressed state [@problem_id:2335634].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the `lac` operon is a classic example of gene regulation. The system allows the cell to metabolize lactose only when it is present. The `lacI` gene, located upstream of the operon, codes for a repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, this repressor protein binds to a specific DNA sequence called the operator (`lacO`), which is situated between the promoter and the structural genes (`lacZ`, `lacY`, `lacA`). This binding physically blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes, keeping the operon \"off\". When lactose is available, a metabolic byproduct, allolactose, acts as an inducer. Allolactose binds to the repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. The operon is then \"on\", and the genes for lactose metabolism are expressed.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a specific mutation in the `lacI` gene, designated as `$lacI^S$`. This mutation results in a \"super-repressor\" protein. Cells with the `$lacI^S$` allele are observed to be non-inducible, meaning the `lac` operon remains permanently repressed, and the structural genes are not expressed even in the continuous presence of high concentrations of lactose.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct molecular explanation for the permanently repressed, non-inducible phenotype of the `$lacI^S$` mutant?\n\nA. The `$lacI^S$` mutation alters the DNA-binding domain of the repressor protein, causing it to lose its ability to bind to the `lacO` operator sequence.\n\nB. The `$lacI^S$` mutation leads to a repressor protein that binds with extremely high affinity to the inducer (allolactose), sequestering it and preventing it from acting elsewhere in the cell.\n\nC. The `$lacI^S$` mutation alters the promoter sequence (`lacP`), preventing RNA polymerase from ever binding to initiate transcription.\n\nD. The `$lacI^S$` mutation alters the inducer-binding site (allosteric site) of the repressor protein, making it incapable of binding to allolactose, while its ability to bind the `lacO` operator sequence remains intact.\n\nE. The `$lacI^S$` mutation causes the repressor protein to degrade immediately upon synthesis, leaving the operator site permanently unoccupied.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the regulatory logic of the lac operon. The lacI gene encodes a repressor that, in its default conformation (without inducer bound), binds the operator lacO and blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. Induction requires an inducer (allolactose) to bind the repressor at its allosteric (inducer-binding) site, causing a conformational change that lowers operator affinity and releases the repressor from DNA, thereby permitting transcription.\n\nA non-inducible phenotype that remains repressed even in the presence of high inducer implies that the repressor never undergoes the conformational switch required to detach from the operator. Thus, the repressor must retain operator-binding ability but be unable to bind the inducer or be unable to respond to inducer binding with the necessary conformational change. The classic $lacI^{S}$ (“super-repressor”) allele fits this model: it produces a repressor that still binds the operator but cannot bind the inducer (or cannot be allosterically shifted by it), so induction cannot occur.\n\nNow evaluate each option against this mechanistic requirement:\n\n1) Option A claims the repressor loses ability to bind the operator. That would produce constitutive expression (always on), not permanent repression. Hence A is incorrect.\n\n2) Option B claims the repressor binds inducer with extremely high affinity, sequestering it. However, inducer binding normally inactivates DNA binding. If the repressor were saturated with inducer, it would release from the operator, leading to induction, not repression. Therefore B contradicts the observed non-inducible repression and is incorrect.\n\n3) Option C describes a promoter mutation (lacP), not a lacI mutation. Moreover, a promoter mutation preventing RNA polymerase binding would indeed block transcription, but the phenotype would not be specifically “non-inducible due to super-repressor”; it would be promoter-defective and not rescued by lacI changes. Since the question asks for the correct molecular explanation of $lacI^{S}$, C is incorrect.\n\n4) Option D states the inducer-binding (allosteric) site of the repressor is altered, preventing inducer binding while leaving operator binding intact. This exactly matches the classic $lacI^{S}$ mechanism: the repressor remains bound to the operator regardless of inducer presence, yielding a permanently repressed, non-inducible operon. D is correct.\n\n5) Option E posits rapid degradation of the repressor. Loss of repressor would make the operon constitutively active (always on), which contradicts the observed repression. E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular explanation is that the mutation disrupts the inducer-binding (allosteric) site while preserving operator binding, preventing inducer-mediated release from the operator and causing permanent repression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2335634"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how an unbreakable repressor keeps the operon off, we now consider the opposite scenario: what happens when the repressor is completely non-functional? This problem introduces the second layer of regulation, catabolite repression, forcing you to integrate both positive and negative control signals. Predicting the outcome for a `$lacI^-$` mutant in the presence of glucose will clarify the crucial distinction between a fully activated state and a de-repressed, basal level of expression [@problem_id:2335663].", "problem": "The `lac` operon in *Escherichia coli* is a well-studied system for understanding gene regulation. Its expression allows the bacterium to metabolize lactose. The operon's transcription is primarily controlled by two inputs: the presence of lactose and the presence of glucose.\n\nThe `lacI` gene, located separately from the operon, codes for a repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, this repressor binds to a DNA sequence called the operator, physically blocking transcription of the operon's structural genes, such as `lacZ` (which codes for the enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase).\n\nA second level of control, known as catabolite repression, is mediated by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). In a cellular environment with low glucose, intracellular levels of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) are high. The cAMP-CAP complex binds to a site near the promoter, significantly enhancing the binding of RNA polymerase and leading to high levels of transcription. Conversely, high glucose levels lead to low cAMP levels, leaving CAP inactive.\n\nConsider an experiment involving a special mutant strain of *E. coli*. This strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the `lacI` gene, denoted as `$lacI^-$`. This mutation leads to the continuous production of a non-functional repressor protein that cannot bind to the operator. This `$lacI^-$` mutant strain is cultured in a growth medium that contains an abundant supply of glucose but is completely devoid of lactose.\n\nBased on your understanding of the `lac` operon's regulatory mechanisms, predict the level of `lacZ` gene expression in this `$lacI^-$` mutant strain under these specific growth conditions.\n\nA. No expression will occur.\n\nB. High\n\nC. A low, basal level of expression will occur.\n\nD. The expression level will be identical to a wild-type strain under the same conditions.\n\nE. Expression will remain repressed until lactose is added to the medium.", "solution": "The lac operon is subject to two controls: negative regulation by the LacI repressor at the operator and positive regulation by the cAMP–CAP complex at the promoter-proximal activator site. In wild-type cells without lactose, functional LacI binds the operator, preventing RNA polymerase progression and thereby repressing transcription of lacZ; in contrast, when lactose (converted to allolactose) is present, it inactivates the repressor, allowing transcription. Independently, when glucose is low, cAMP is high and binds CAP; the cAMP–CAP complex enhances RNA polymerase binding, leading to high transcription. When glucose is high, cAMP is low, CAP is inactive, and positive activation is absent, reducing transcription to basal levels determined by the intrinsic promoter strength.\n\nIn the `$lacI^-$` mutant, the repressor is nonfunctional and cannot bind the operator. Therefore, the negative control is abolished and repression does not occur regardless of lactose presence. Under the stated conditions (abundant glucose, no lactose), the absence of a functional repressor means the operon is not blocked; however, abundant glucose keeps cAMP levels low, CAP remains inactive, and the positive activation that yields high transcription is absent. Thus, transcription from the lac promoter proceeds only at its weak, basal level dictated by RNA polymerase’s intrinsic affinity for the promoter.\n\nTherefore: \n- Not zero expression, because there is no repressor-mediated blockade.\n- Not high expression, because CAP is inactive under high glucose.\n- Not identical to wild type under the same conditions, because wild type would be repressed without lactose.\n- Not awaiting lactose induction, because the repressor is nonfunctional.\n\nThe correct prediction is a low, basal level of lacZ expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335663"}, {"introduction": "We've examined mutations in the repressor protein (*lacI*) and the operator DNA sequence (*lacO*) that can both lead to continuous expression.

This exercise solidifies the critical genetic concepts of *trans*-acting factors and *cis*-acting elements, a cornerstone of molecular biology [@problem_id:2335677].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic system for gene regulation. It consists of three structural genes (`lacZ`, `lacY`, `lacA`) that are transcribed together from a single promoter. The expression of these genes is controlled by a regulatory gene, *lacI*, which codes for a repressor protein, and a DNA sequence called the operator, *lacO*, to which the repressor protein binds.\n\nConsider two different mutant strains of *E. coli* that both exhibit constitutive expression of the *lac* operon, meaning the structural genes are expressed continuously, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose.\n\n*   **Strain 1:** Has a mutation in the *lacI* gene, denoted `$lacI^-$`, which results in a non-functional repressor protein that cannot bind to the operator.\n*   **Strain 2:** Has a mutation in the operator DNA sequence, denoted `$lacO^c$` (for operator constitutive), which prevents the wild-type repressor protein from binding to it.\n\nA classic experiment to differentiate the nature of these mutations involves creating a partial diploid, or merodiploid, by introducing a plasmid (an F' factor) carrying a wild-type copy of the regulatory region (`$lacI^+$` and `$lacO^+$`) into each mutant strain.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly distinguishes the molecular basis of constitutive expression in these two original mutant strains when tested in a merodiploid context?\n\nA.

The `$lacI^-$` mutation is cis-dominant, and its effect cannot be complemented.\n\nE.

A trans-acting factor is a diffusible product (such as a protein) that can act on multiple DNA molecules in the same cell, whereas a cis-acting element is a DNA sequence whose effect is restricted to the physically linked genes on the same DNA molecule.\n\nFor Strain 1 ($lacI^-$), the mutation in *lacI* abolishes functional repressor production. Because *lacI* encodes a diffusible protein, the phenotype caused by `$lacI^-$` is trans-acting and recessive to `$lacI^+$`. In a merodiploid carrying `$lacI^+$` on an F' plasmid, the functional repressor is produced and can diffuse to bind any wild-type operator present, restoring inducible regulation of operons with a functional operator. Therefore, `$lacI^-$` is complemented in trans by `$lacI^+$` and is recessive.\n\nFor Strain 2 ($lacO^c$), the operator sequence itself is altered so that the repressor cannot bind. The operator is a cis-acting DNA element: its mutation affects only the linked operon on the same DNA molecule and cannot be rescued by providing a wild-type operator sequence elsewhere. Even if a `$lacI^+$` gene on the plasmid produces functional repressor, it cannot bind the mutant `$lacO^c$` site; hence the operon linked to `$lacO^c$` remains constitutively expressed. Thus, `$lacO^c$` is cis-dominant and not complemented in trans.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A is incorrect because `$lacI^-$` is trans-acting and can be complemented by `$lacI^+$`.\n- B is incorrect because `$lacO^c$` is not trans-acting; it is cis-acting and cannot be complemented.\n- C correctly states that `$lacI^-$` is recessive and complemented in trans, while `$lacO^c$` is cis-dominant and not complemented.\n- D is incorrect because it reverses the dominance and cis/trans properties.\n- E is incorrect because it introduces glucose regulation, which is not the distinguishing factor in this complementation test.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335677"}]}
