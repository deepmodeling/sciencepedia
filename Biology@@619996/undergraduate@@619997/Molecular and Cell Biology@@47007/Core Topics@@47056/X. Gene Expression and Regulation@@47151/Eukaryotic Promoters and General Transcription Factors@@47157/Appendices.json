Mastering this skill is fundamental to understanding gene regulation and is a common first step in characterizing any new gene [@problem_id:2315245].", "problem": "A molecular biology student is investigating the core promoter of a newly characterized eukaryotic gene. The binding of General Transcription Factors (GTFs) to this region is crucial for the initiation of transcription by RNA Polymerase II. The student has sequenced a 60-base-pair segment of the non-template (coding) strand of the DNA, presented 5' to 3', which is believed to contain key promoter elements.\n\nThe sequence is:\n`5'-AATTCGGCATGCTCGGCAGGACGCCTATAAAAGCTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA-3'`\n\nThe student is looking for two specific GTF binding sites:\n1.  The TATA box, which has a consensus sequence of `5'-TATA(A/T)A(A/T)-3'`, where `(A/T)` indicates that either adenine (A) or thymine (T) can be present at that position.\n2.

The TATA box consensus is 5'-TATA(A/T)A(A/T)-3'. Scanning the sequence 5'-AATTCGGCATGCTCGGCAGGACGCCTATAAAAGCTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA-3' reveals the substring \"TATAAAA\", which fits the consensus because it is TATA followed by A at the fifth position, A at the sixth (which is fixed as A), and A at the seventh position, all allowed by the consensus.\n\nHaving located \"...CGGCAGGACGCC TATAAAA...\", we next search for the BRE consensus 5'-(G/C)(G/C)(G/A)CGCC-3' upstream (5') of the TATA box. Consider the 12 nucleotides immediately upstream of the TATA box, \"CGGCAGGACGCC\".

This practice explores the stepwise construction of the pre-initiation complex using a classic biochemical technique, the Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). By predicting the results of an EMSA experiment, you will develop an intuition for how the binding of one protein (TBP) can create a platform for another (TFIIA), leading to the formation of a larger, more stable complex. This exercise provides a clear link between molecular interactions at the DNA level and the data you would observe in a laboratory setting [@problem_id:2315261].", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is investigating the assembly of the pre-initiation complex on a eukaryotic promoter using an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). The basic principle of EMSA is that a DNA fragment bound by a protein will migrate more slowly through a non-denaturing gel than the DNA fragment alone, resulting in a \"shifted\" band.\n\nThe researcher prepares a short, radioactively labeled DNA probe containing a canonical TATA box sequence. They also have purified samples of two general transcription factors: TATA-Binding Protein (TBP) and Transcription Factor II A (TFIIA). It is known that TBP binds directly to the TATA box sequence on DNA. It is also known that TFIIA does not bind directly to DNA but instead binds to the TBP protein, stabilizing the TBP-DNA complex.\n\nThe researcher sets up three reactions, which are then loaded into separate lanes of a polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis.\n- **Lane 1:** DNA probe only\n- **Lane 2:** DNA probe + TBP\n- **Lane 3:** DNA probe + DNA-binding buffer + TBP, incubated for 15 minutes, then TFIIA is added and the mixture is incubated for another 15 minutes.\n\nAssuming all binding reactions go to completion, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected pattern of bands after the gel is run and visualized? For this question, \"higher\" refers to a position closer to the starting wells (slower migration), and \"lower\" refers to a position farther from the wells (faster migration).\n\nA. All three lanes will show a single band at the same low position in the gel.\n\nB. The band in Lane 2 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1. The band in Lane 3 will be at the same position as the band in Lane 2.\n\nC. The band in Lane 2 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1.

The band in Lane 3 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the outcome of an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) designed to study the interaction between a TATA box-containing DNA probe, TATA-Binding Protein (TBP), and Transcription Factor II A (TFIIA). The key principle of EMSA is that the mobility of a molecule through a gel is inversely related to its size; larger complexes migrate more slowly.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Lane 1.**\nLane 1 contains only the radioactively labeled DNA probe. This lane serves as the negative control. It will produce a single band corresponding to the unbound, or \"free,\" DNA probe. This band will migrate the farthest down the gel, establishing the baseline position for the free probe.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Lane 2.**\nLane 2 contains the DNA probe and TBP. The problem states that TBP binds directly to the TATA box sequence present in the probe. This binding event forms a DNA-TBP complex. This complex has a greater molecular weight and size than the DNA probe alone. Due to its larger size, the DNA-TBP complex will be retarded in its migration through the gel matrix compared to the free probe. Therefore, Lane 2 will show a band that is \"shifted\" to a higher position (slower migration) relative to the band in Lane 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Lane 3.**\nLane 3 contains the DNA probe, TBP, and TFIIA. The experimental procedure ensures that TBP is first allowed to bind to the DNA, and then TFIIA is added. The problem states that TFIIA does not bind DNA directly but instead binds to the TBP protein that is already part of the TBP-DNA complex. This interaction forms a larger, ternary complex: DNA-TBP-TFIIA. This ternary complex is larger in mass and size than the DNA-TBP complex in Lane 2. Consequently, it will migrate even more slowly through the gel. The resulting band in Lane 3 will be \"supershifted,\" meaning it will be at a higher position than the shifted band in Lane 2.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the results and select the correct option.**\n- **Lane 1:** Fastest band (lowest position) - Free DNA.\n- **Lane 2:** Slower band than Lane 1 (higher position) - DNA-TBP complex \"shift\".\n- **Lane 3:** Slowest band of all (highest position) - DNA-TBP-TFIIA complex \"supershift\".\n\nThis pattern of migration (fastest -> slower -> slowest) corresponds to bands at successively higher positions in the gel. Let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion.\n\n- **A. All three lanes will show a single band at the same low position in the gel.** This is incorrect as it implies no binding occurs.\n- **B. The band in Lane 2 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1. The band in Lane 3 will be at the same position as the band in Lane 2.** This is incorrect. It correctly identifies the TBP shift but wrongly suggests that the addition of TFIIA has no effect on the complex's mobility. Adding more protein mass (TFIIA) must slow the complex further.\n- **C. The band in Lane 2 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1. The band in Lane 3 will be at an even higher position than the band in Lane 2.** This matches our derived conclusion: a shift followed by a supershift.\n- **D. The band in Lane 2 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1. In Lane 3, the higher band from Lane 2 will disappear, and a band will appear at the same low position as in Lane 1.** This is incorrect. It implies that TFIIA causes TBP to dissociate from the DNA, which is contrary to its known function as a stabilizer of the TBP-DNA complex.\n- **E. The band in Lane 2 will be at the same low position as the band in Lane 1. The band in Lane 3 will be at a higher position than the band in Lane 1.** This is incorrect. It implies TBP does not bind to DNA, but that TFIIA somehow causes a shift in the presence of TBP, which contradicts the given binding properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the expected results is provided in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315261"}, {"introduction": "Assembling the pre-initiation complex is only half the battle; the assembled machinery must be given a \"go\" signal to start transcribing. This signal often comes in the form of post-translational modification, specifically the phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II's C-terminal domain (CTD). This problem uses a powerful pedagogical tool—a hypothetical temperature-sensitive mutant—to probe the specific function of the kinase subunit within TFIIH. By thinking through this genetic scenario, you can deduce the precise moment and importance of CTD phosphorylation in the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation [@problem_id:2315259].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, researchers are studying a human cell line that has been genetically engineered to express a temperature-sensitive version of the Cdk7 protein. Cdk7 is the kinase subunit of the general Transcription Factor II H (TFIIH). At a permissive temperature of 30°C, the protein functions normally. However, when the cells are shifted to a non-permissive temperature of 39°C, the Cdk7 protein rapidly loses its kinase activity, although it can still assemble into the TFIIH complex, and TFIIH can still be recruited to the promoter. The researchers are observing the transcription of a specific gene. They allow the full pre-initiation complex, including RNA Polymerase II, to assemble at the gene's promoter at the permissive temperature and then shift the cells to the non-permissive temperature. What is the most likely phosphorylation state of the heptapeptide repeats (YSPTSPS) within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II that is stalled at the promoter under these non-permissive conditions?\n\nA. The CTD is completely unphosphorylated.\n\nB. The CTD is phosphorylated exclusively on the Serine-5 positions.\n\nC. The CTD is phosphorylated exclusively on the Serine-2 positions.\n\nD. The CTD is hyperphosphorylated on both Serine-2 and Serine-5 positions.", "solution": "First, recall the role of Cdk7 and the order of CTD phosphorylation events during transcription initiation and elongation:\n- RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) has a C-terminal domain (CTD) composed of heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. The serine residues at positions 5 and 2 are the primary targets of phosphorylation during the transcription cycle.\n- During pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly at the promoter, Pol II CTD is largely unphosphorylated (the IIA form). This unphosphorylated state favors stable assembly with general transcription factors and Mediator.\n- Upon initiation, the kinase activity of Cdk7 within TFIIH phosphorylates Serine-5 of the CTD. Serine-5 phosphorylation facilitates promoter clearance and recruitment of the capping machinery.\n- During productive elongation, P-TEFb (Cdk9) phosphorylates Serine-2 of the CTD; robust Serine-2 phosphorylation typically occurs after promoter escape and is associated with elongation and RNA processing.\n\nNow apply the experimental setup:\n- The engineered Cdk7 is temperature-sensitive: it is functional at the permissive temperature and rapidly loses kinase activity at the non-permissive temperature, although TFIIH assembly and recruitment are unaffected.\n- The researchers allow the full PIC, including Pol II, to assemble at the promoter under permissive conditions and then shift to the non-permissive temperature before promoter escape proceeds.\n- After the shift, Cdk7 kinase activity is lost. Therefore, the critical step of Serine-5 phosphorylation by Cdk7 at initiation cannot occur.\n- Without Serine-5 phosphorylation, Pol II fails to undergo promoter clearance and remains stalled at the promoter.\n- Because productive elongation has not begun, P-TEFb does not establish Serine-2 phosphorylation either.\n\nTherefore, the Pol II that remains stalled at the promoter under the non-permissive conditions will have a CTD that is not phosphorylated at Serine-5 or Serine-2. The most likely phosphorylation state is completely unphosphorylated.\n\nThis directly excludes:\n- Exclusive Serine-5 phosphorylation (requires Cdk7 activity, which is absent).\n- Exclusive Serine-2 phosphorylation (occurs during elongation, which has not commenced).\n- Hyperphosphorylation on both Serine-2 and Serine-5 (requires both initiation and elongation-associated kinases, not satisfied here).\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the CTD is completely unphosphorylated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2315259"}]}
