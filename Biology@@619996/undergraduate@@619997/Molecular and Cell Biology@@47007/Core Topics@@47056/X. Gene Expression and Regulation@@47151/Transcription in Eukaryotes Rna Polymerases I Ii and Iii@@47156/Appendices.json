There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard conceptual problem in molecular biology that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe assignment of RNA polymerases to promoters in eukaryotes is determined by the specific architecture of the promoter's core elements. We will analyze each promoter's characteristics based on established principles of transcription initiation.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Promoter X**: The defining feature of Promoter X is that its essential control elements are located *internal* to the transcribed region (downstream of the $+1$ start site), specifically around positions $+10$ and $+55$. Deletion of upstream sequences has little effect. This internal promoter structure is the hallmark of genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase III. The problem states that one of the promoters is for a tRNA gene. Type 2 RNA Polymerase III promoters, which drive transcription of tRNA genes, contain two internal conserved sequences known as the A box and the B box. In humans, the A box is typically centered around $+15$ and the B box around $+55$. The described positions of $+10$ and $+55$ and the critical spacing are entirely consistent with an A box/B box architecture of a tRNA gene promoter. Therefore, Promoter X is transcribed by RNA Polymerase III.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Promoter Y**: Promoter Y is characterized by two essential *upstream* elements: a core element spanning the start site (from $-45$ to $+20$) and an upstream control element (UCE) located further upstream ($-180$ to $-110$). The spacing between these elements is critical. The promoter lacks a TATA box and is insensitive to mutations where a TATA box would reside ($-30$). This bipartite upstream promoter structure is the defining characteristic of genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase I, which are responsible for transcribing the large ribosomal RNA precursor gene from rDNA repeats. The core element and UCE work together to recruit the necessary transcription factors for RNA Polymerase I. The description of Promoter Y perfectly matches the structure of a RNA Polymerase I promoter. Therefore, Promoter Y is transcribed by RNA Polymerase I.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Promoter Z**: Promoter Z contains a TATA box ($-31$ to $-26$), a BRE ($-37$ to $-32$), and an Inr element at $+1$. These are the canonical core promoter elements for genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase II, which are responsible for synthesizing messenger RNAs from protein-coding genes. The TATA box positions the preinitiation complex, which includes TFIID (via its TATA-binding protein subunit, TBP) and TFIIB (which contacts the BRE), thereby precisely dictating the transcription start site. The observation that moving the TATA box shifts the start site is a classic property of TATA-dependent RNA Polymerase II promoters. Upstream enhancers modulate the rate of transcription but not the core promoter's function of start-site selection. This entire description is a textbook case for an RNA Polymerase II promoter. Therefore, Promoter Z is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\nBased on the analysis, the correct assignments are:\n- Promoter X → RNA Polymerase III\n- Promoter Y → RNA Polymerase I\n- Promoter Z → RNA Polymerase II\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against our derived assignments.\n\nA. X → RNA Polymerase I; Y → RNA Polymerase II; Z → RNA Polymerase III\nThis assignment is **Incorrect**. It misassigns all three promoters. Promoter X has internal elements (Pol III), not upstream elements of Pol I. Promoter Y has a bipartite upstream structure (Pol I), not Pol II elements. Promoter Z has a TATA box (Pol II), not internal elements of Pol III.\n\nB. X → RNA Polymerase III; Y → RNA Polymerase I; Z → RNA Polymerase II\nThis assignment is **Correct**. It perfectly matches our derivation. Promoter X's internal elements are characteristic of RNA Polymerase III. Promoter Y's bipartite upstream structure is characteristic of RNA Polymerase I. Promoter Z's TATA/BRE/Inr architecture is characteristic of RNA Polymerase II.\n\nC. X → RNA Polymerase II; Y → RNA Polymerase III; Z → RNA Polymerase I\nThis assignment is **Incorrect**. It misassigns all three promoters. Promoter X does not have the TATA-box or other elements typical for Pol II. Promoter Y does not have internal elements typical for Pol III. Promoter Z does not have the bipartite upstream structure of a Pol I promoter.\n\nD. X → RNA Polymerase II; Y → RNA Polymerase I; Z → RNA Polymerase III\nThis assignment is **Incorrect**. It correctly assigns Promoter Y to RNA Polymerase I, but incorrectly swaps the assignments for X and Z. Promoter X is Pol III, not Pol II.

This advanced problem delves into the consequences of breaking these rules through genetic engineering. By placing a gene normally transcribed by RNA Polymerase III, a tRNA gene, under the control of an RNA Polymerase II promoter, you are forced to consider the entire transcription and processing pathway. This exercise illuminates why these systems are not interchangeable and highlights the critical role of the polymerase itself in orchestrating co-transcriptional events like capping and polyadenylation [@problem_id:2345733].", "problem": "In a genetic engineering experiment, a synthetic gene construct is created and stably integrated into the genome of a eukaryotic cell line. The construct consists of the following elements, arranged in order from 5' to 3':\n1.  A strong, canonical RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) promoter containing a TATA box.\n2.  The complete DNA sequence that codes for an alanine transfer RNA (tRNA$^{\\text{Ala}}$). In its natural genomic context, this tRNA gene is transcribed by RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) and relies on an internal promoter (A-box and B-box) located within the coding sequence itself.\n3.  A standard Pol II polyadenylation signal sequence (e.g., AAUAAA in the transcript) located a short distance downstream of the tRNA$^{\\text{Ala}}$ coding region, followed by a Pol II transcription termination region.\n\nAssume all necessary cellular transcription and processing factors are present and functional. Which of the following options most accurately describes the primary molecular outcome resulting from the transcription of this synthetic gene?\n\nA. A correctly processed and functional mature tRNA$^{\\text{Ala}}$.\n\nB.

A transcript containing the tRNA$^{\\text{Ala}}$ sequence that possesses a 5' 7-methylguanosine cap and a 3' poly(A) tail.\n\nD. No stable transcript is produced because the Pol II and Pol III promoter elements create an inhibitory conflict that blocks transcription initiation by either polymerase.\n\nE. Two separate transcripts are produced: one initiated by Pol II that terminates prematurely, and a second, standard pre-tRNA transcript initiated by Pol III from the internal promoter.", "solution": "The synthetic construct places a strong RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) promoter immediately upstream of a $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ coding sequence and includes a canonical Pol II polyadenylation signal downstream. In eukaryotes, Pol II initiation is directed by core promoter elements such as a TATA box and associated general transcription factors. Thus, the strong Pol II promoter will recruit Pol II to initiate transcription at the designed start site.\n\nPol II transcripts undergo co-transcriptional 5' capping, mediated by the capping enzymes recruited via the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest Pol II subunit. Therefore, any transcript initiated by Pol II will acquire a 5' 7-methylguanosine cap early after initiation. At the 3' end, Pol II termination is coupled to cleavage and polyadenylation at a downstream polyadenylation signal (e.g., AAUAAA in the RNA), again through CTD-mediated recruitment of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. Consequently, transcription through the $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ sequence followed by the provided polyadenylation signal will yield a transcript that is cleaved and polyadenylated at its 3' end.\n\nIn contrast, endogenous $tRNA$ genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) using an internal promoter comprising the A-box and B-box within the $tRNA$ coding sequence, and Pol III termination relies on a short run of thymines in the DNA template. Pol II does not terminate at such T-rich sequences; thus, a Pol II transcript will not terminate at a Pol III terminator but will proceed to the Pol II-specified polyadenylation and termination region.\n\nBecause the transcript is produced by Pol II, it will carry a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail. These features are incompatible with normal $tRNA$ maturation, which depends on Pol III-derived pre-tRNAs that lack a 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail and are processed by RNase P and tRNase Z and, where applicable, the tRNA splicing endonuclease. Therefore, a correctly processed, functional mature $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ would not be the primary outcome from a Pol II-derived transcript.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because a functional mature $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ requires Pol III-type transcription and processing without a 5' cap or 3' poly(A) tail.\n- B is incorrect because Pol II does not terminate at a short stretch of thymines; that is a Pol III-specific termination signal.\n- C is correct because Pol II will produce a transcript containing the $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ sequence that is 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated due to the provided Pol II processing signals.\n- D is incorrect because the presence of a strong Pol II promoter is sufficient to drive transcription; there is no obligatory inhibitory conflict that blocks initiation.\n- E is unlikely as the primary outcome because internal A/B-box elements can, in principle, recruit Pol III, but the immediate upstream placement of a strong Pol II promoter and active Pol II transcription typically causes promoter interference and suppresses Pol III initiation. The construct is designed to favor Pol II transcription with downstream Pol II processing signals, making a Pol II-derived, capped, and polyadenylated transcript the predominant product.\n\nTherefore, the primary molecular outcome is a Pol II-derived transcript that includes the $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ sequence and has a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2345733"}]}
