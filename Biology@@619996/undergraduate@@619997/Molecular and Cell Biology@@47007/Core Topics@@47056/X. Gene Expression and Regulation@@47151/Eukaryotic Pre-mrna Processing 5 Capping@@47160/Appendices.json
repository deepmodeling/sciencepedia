It is known that the synthesis of pre-mRNA by RNA Polymerase II begins with a nucleoside triphosphate, which becomes the first nucleotide at the 5' end of the nascent transcript. The researcher introduces a novel small-molecule inhibitor that specifically and completely blocks the enzymatic activity of RNA triphosphatase, an enzyme essential for the initial step of 5' cap formation.

A $^{32}$P isotope is exclusively located at the beta ($\\beta$) position of the triphosphate chain of GTP.

To determine this, we must follow the path of each phosphate atom during the multi-step capping process.\n\n**Step 1: Initial State of Reactants**\nThe pre-mRNA transcript begins with a 5' triphosphate end, which can be represented as $5'\\text{-}ppp\\text{N-...-3}'$, where 'p' is a phosphate group and 'N' is the first nucleotide. Let's denote the phosphates from outermost to innermost as $\\gamma, \\beta, \\alpha$, so the end is $p(\\gamma)\\text{-}p(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-N-RNA}$.\nThe Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is specifically labeled on its $\\beta$-phosphate. We can represent this molecule as $G\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-}p^*(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\gamma)$, where the asterisk `*` denotes the $^{32}$P radioactive label.\n\n**Step 2: Action of RNA Triphosphatase**\nThe first enzyme to act is RNA triphosphatase. Its function is to remove the terminal ($\\gamma$) phosphate from the 5' end of the pre-mRNA transcript.\n$$\np(\\gamma)\\text{-}p(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-N-RNA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{RNA triphosphatase}} p(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-N-RNA} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}\n$$\nAfter this step, the pre-mRNA has a 5' diphosphate end ($pp\\text{N-RNA}$). This step does not involve the GTP molecule.\n\n**Step 3: Action of Guanylyltransferase**\nThis is the key step where the GTP molecule is used. The enzyme guanylyltransferase catalyzes the addition of a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) moiety to the 5' end of the transcript. This process involves two critical events:\nFirst, the enzyme cleaves the incoming GTP molecule between its $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phosphates. This cleavage releases a pyrophosphate molecule (PPi).\n$$\nG\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-}p^*(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\gamma) \\xrightarrow{\\text{cleavage}} G\\text{-}p(\\alpha) \\quad (\\text{GMP}) \\quad + \\quad p^*(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\gamma) \\quad (\\text{PPi})\n$$\nAs shown, the radioactive label ($*$) on the $\\beta$-phosphate is part of the pyrophosphate molecule that is released. It is not part of the GMP moiety that will be added to the RNA.\n\nSecond, the enzyme ligates the GMP moiety ($G\\text{-}p(\\alpha)$) to the 5' diphosphate end of the pre-mRNA ($p(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-N-RNA}$) via a unique 5'-5' triphosphate linkage.\n$$\nG\\text{-}p(\\alpha) + p(\\beta)\\text{-}p(\\alpha)\\text{-N-RNA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Guanylyltransferase}} G(5')ppp(5')\\text{N-RNA}\n$$\nThe resulting triphosphate bridge is composed of the $\\alpha$-phosphate from the original GTP and the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phosphates from the original pre-mRNA transcript.\n\n**Step 4: Action of Methyltransferase**\nThe final step involves the methylation of the added guanine base at the N7 position, catalyzed by a methyltransferase. This modifies the guanine but does not alter the phosphate backbone.\n$$\nG(5')ppp(5')\\text{N-RNA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Methyltransferase}} \\text{m}^{7}G(5')ppp(5')\\text{N-RNA}\n$$\nThis is the final 5' cap structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy tracing the radioactive label, we see that the $^{32}$P on the $\\beta$-phosphate of the starting GTP is located in the pyrophosphate (PPi) that is cleaved off and released during the guanylyltransferase reaction. This pyrophosphate is a byproduct and is not incorporated into the RNA chain. The final cap structure is therefore not radioactive.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA is incorrect because only the GMP part of GTP is incorporated, not the entire molecule.\nB is incorrect because the $\\alpha$-phosphate from GTP, not the $\\beta$-phosphate, is incorporated into the triphosphate bridge.\nC is correct. The $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ phosphates are released as pyrophosphate, taking the radioactive label with them.\nD is incorrect. RNA triphosphatase acts on the pre-mRNA, not GTP. Guanylyltransferase cleaves PPi from GTP, not all three phosphates.\nE is incorrect because only the $\\alpha$-phosphate from GTP is incorporated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315057"}]}
