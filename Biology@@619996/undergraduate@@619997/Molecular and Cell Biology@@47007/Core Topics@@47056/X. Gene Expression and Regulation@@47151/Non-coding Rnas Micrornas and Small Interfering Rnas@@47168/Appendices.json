Understanding how to interpret these results is essential for designing focused and efficient validation experiments, highlighting the critical distinction between a computational hypothesis and confirmed biological regulation.", "problem": "A molecular biology researcher has identified a novel microRNA (miRNA), which they have named miR-X, in human cancer cells. To understand the function of miR-X, the researcher needs to identify which messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts it regulates. In animals, miRNAs typically function by binding to partially complementary sequences within the 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to either translational repression or mRNA degradation.\n\nThe researcher uses a computational target prediction algorithm to scan the entire human transcriptome for potential miR-X targets. The algorithm primarily looks for complementarity between the mRNA's 3' UTR and the \"seed region\" of miR-X (nucleotides 2-8), which is critical for target recognition. The output is a list of over 500 potential mRNA targets ranked by a prediction score.\n\nGiven this context, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary purpose and interpretation of the results from this computational algorithm in the research workflow?\n\nA. The algorithm's list is definitive; it represents all the mRNAs that are biologically regulated by miR-X in the cancer cells, and the ranking score directly corresponds to the strength of translational repression.\n\nB. The list of predicted targets serves as a set of hypotheses. The primary purpose of the algorithm is to narrow the field of all possible mRNAs down to a manageable number of high-probability candidates that must be validated experimentally.\n\nC. The algorithm's main function is to identify mRNA targets that will be cleaved and rapidly degraded, as miRNA binding always triggers the RNA interference pathway leading to mRNA destruction.\n\nD. The computational results are mainly used to confirm that miR-X is a real miRNA, as the presence of a large number of predicted targets is the defining feature of a functional miRNA.\n\nE. The algorithm is used to find mRNAs that have perfect, base-for-base complementarity across the entire length of miR-X, as only these perfectly matched targets are biologically significant in humans.", "solution": "We analyze the role of computational miRNA target prediction in the experimental workflow by applying established principles of miRNA biology in animals and the characteristics of in silico prediction tools.\n\nFirst, in animals, miRNAs typically recognize targets via partial complementarity, with the seed region (nucleotides 2–8 of the miRNA) being the dominant determinant of binding specificity. Algorithms prioritize seed matches (often 7–8 nucleotide matches) within the 3' UTRs and may incorporate additional context features (e.g., site conservation, local AU content, site accessibility), generating ranked candidate lists.\n\nSecond, such predictions inherently include false positives and false negatives because miRNA–mRNA interactions are context-dependent: expression levels of miRNA and targets, RNA-binding proteins, alternative 3' UTR isoforms, and cellular state affect true regulatory outcomes. Therefore, computational predictions are not definitive evidence of regulation.\n\nThird, the ranking score in most target prediction tools reflects a relative confidence, likelihood, or contextual favorability of interaction, not a direct quantitative measure of repression magnitude in a given biological setting. Translational repression and mRNA destabilization are typical outcomes in animals, and the effect size must be measured empirically.\n\nFourth, perfect complementarity leading to Argonaute-catalyzed slicing is rare in animals; miRNAs mainly repress via imperfect pairing that promotes deadenylation and decay or translational repression. Consequently, a focus on perfect base-for-base complementarity is inappropriate for human miRNA target discovery.\n\nFifth, the presence of many predicted targets does not validate the existence or functionality of a miRNA. miRNA identity is supported by biogenesis pathway dependence (e.g., DROSHA/DICER processing), characteristic hairpin structure, loading into Argonaute, and expression evidence; computational targets alone do not constitute validation.\n\nGiven these principles:\n- Option A is incorrect because the list is not definitive, and the score does not directly correspond to repression strength in cells.\n- Option C is incorrect because miRNA binding in animals does not always, nor even typically, cause endonucleolytic cleavage; partial complementarity is the norm.\n- Option D is incorrect because computational predictions do not primarily serve to confirm the existence of the miRNA.\n- Option E is incorrect because perfect complementarity is not the principal criterion for human miRNA targeting.\n\nTherefore, the computational algorithm’s primary purpose is to generate a shortlist of high-probability candidate targets to be tested experimentally (e.g., via reporter assays, mutational analyses of seed sites, CLIP-based methods, or transcriptome changes after miRNA perturbation), which corresponds to Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2326617"}, {"introduction": "Once a miRNA-target interaction is identified, we can move from qualitative description to quantitative prediction.

One key mechanism involves a tumor-suppressive microRNA (miRNA) known as miR-42, which binds to a specific target site in the 3' Untranslated Region (UTR) of the POGSI messenger RNA (mRNA). This binding event leads to the translational repression of the POGSI protein.\n\nA research team has identified a common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in the population that resides within the miR-42 binding site on the POGSI gene. Biophysical measurements reveal that this SNP destabilizes the miRNA-mRNA duplex. For the wild-type (WT) allele, the standard Gibbs free energy of binding for the miR-42/POGSI-mRNA interaction is $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{WT} = -45.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. The presence of the SNP alters this binding energy by $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ} = +10.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.
