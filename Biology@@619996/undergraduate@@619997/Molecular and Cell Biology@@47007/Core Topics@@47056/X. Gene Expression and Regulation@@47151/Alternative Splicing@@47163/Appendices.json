It is hypothesized that Gene-X undergoes alternative splicing, a process where different combinations of exons are joined together from the initial pre-mRNA transcript, leading to different protein variants in different cell types.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the biologist isolates messenger RNA (mRNA) from brain tissue and from lung tissue. Using these mRNA samples, they perform a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiment. The primers used for the PCR step are designed to be complementary to sequences within two specific exons that are believed to be \"constitutive,\" meaning they are always included in the final mRNA. These two constitutive exons are separated by a single \"cassette exon,\" which may be either included or excluded during splicing.\n\nAfter running the RT-PCR products on an electrophoresis gel, the biologist observes a single, distinct band for each tissue sample. The product amplified from the brain tissue mRNA is 450 base pairs (bp) in length. The product amplified from the lung tissue mRNA is 300 bp in length.\n\nAssuming the difference in size is due solely to the inclusion or exclusion of the single cassette exon, calculate the size of this alternatively spliced cassette exon. Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "The problem asks for the size of an alternatively spliced cassette exon based on the results of a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiment.\n\nFirst, let's understand the experimental setup. RT-PCR is a two-step process used to detect and quantify messenger RNA (mRNA). In the first step, Reverse Transcription, mRNA is converted into its complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence. In the second step, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify a specific segment of this cDNA. The size of the final amplified DNA product, visualized as a band on a gel, corresponds to the length of the mRNA segment between the sites where the primers bind.\n\nThe gene in question, Gene-X, has two constitutive exons with a single cassette exon located between them. The primers for the PCR step are designed to bind within these two constitutive exons. Let's denote the length of the amplified region, excluding the cassette exon, as $L_{const}$. This length is composed of the parts of the two constitutive exons that lie between the primer binding sites.\n\nAlternative splicing can lead to two different mature mRNA transcripts from the same pre-mRNA:\n1.  A transcript that includes the cassette exon.\n2.  A transcript that excludes (splices out) the cassette exon.\n\nLet the size of the cassette exon be $L_{cassette}$.\n\nWhen the cassette exon is included in the mature mRNA, the total length of the region amplified by the primers will be the sum of the constant part and the cassette exon part.\n$$L_{long} = L_{const} + L_{cassette}$$\n\nWhen the cassette exon is excluded from the mature mRNA, the two constitutive exons are spliced directly together. The total length of the region amplified by the primers will then just be the constant part.\n$$L_{short} = L_{const}$$\n\nThe experiment yields two products of different sizes from two different tissues:\n-   From brain tissue, the product size is 450 bp.\n-   From lung tissue, the product size is 300 bp.\n\nSince the inclusion of the exon results in a longer transcript, the 450 bp product must correspond to the mRNA species that includes the cassette exon, and the 300 bp product must correspond to the species that excludes it.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equations:\n$$450 \\text{ bp} = L_{long} = L_{const} + L_{cassette}$$\n$$300 \\text{ bp} = L_{short} = L_{const}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the size of the cassette exon, $L_{cassette}$. We can substitute the value of $L_{const}$ from the second equation into the first equation:\n$$450 \\text{ bp} = 300 \\text{ bp} + L_{cassette}$$\n\nSolving for $L_{cassette}$:\n$$L_{cassette} = 450 \\text{ bp} - 300 \\text{ bp}$$\n$$L_{cassette} = 150 \\text{ bp}$$\n\nThus, the size of the alternatively spliced cassette exon is 150 base pairs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{150}$$", "id": "1468340"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying splice variants, a key goal in biology is to quantify their relative abundance.

They have identified a short nucleotide sequence that they hypothesize acts as an Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE), a sequence within an exon that promotes its inclusion in the final messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they construct a reporter minigene plasmid. The minigene consists of three exons (E1, E2, E3) separated by two introns. Exon E2 is a cassette exon, meaning it can either be included in the mature mRNA (forming an E1-E2-E3 transcript) or skipped (forming an E1-E3 transcript).\n\nTwo versions of this reporter plasmid are created:\n1.  **Control Plasmid:** The standard minigene with the natural sequence of exon E2.\n2.  **Test Plasmid:** The same minigene as the control, but with the hypothesized 6-nucleotide ESE sequence inserted into the center of exon E2.\n\nEach plasmid is transfected into a population of cultured human cells. After 48 hours, total RNA is extracted, and the relative amounts of the two splice isoforms (inclusion vs. exclusion of E2) are measured using Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR).

This final practice problem bridges the gap between RNA processing and protein synthesis by exploring the consequences of exon skipping on the translational reading frame. By considering the length of the excluded exon in relation to the triplet genetic code, you will determine the most critical outcome for the protein, a skill essential for predicting the functional effects of genetic variations. [@problem_id:1468325]", "problem": "In a particular line of eukaryotic cells, a gene responsible for producing a cytoskeletal protein called \"Structrin\" is actively transcribed. The initial transcript, or pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA), contains five exons. In most cell types, all five exons are spliced together to produce a functional mRNA sequence. However, in response to a specific signaling molecule, a specialized splicing factor causes Exon 4 to be excluded from the final mature mRNA transcript. This alternatively spliced mRNA is then translated into a variant of the Structrin protein. The length of Exon 4 is exactly 50 nucleotides.\n\nAssuming that the splicing of Exon 3 to Exon 5 is successful and does not introduce or remove any additional nucleotides at the splice junction, which of the following statements describes the most direct and certain consequence for the reading frame of the mature mRNA?\n\nA. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 16 amino acids.\n\nB. The reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction.\n\nC. The reading frame will be unaffected because the ribosome can skip over the altered splice junction.\n\nD. Splicing will be completely blocked, as exons that are not a multiple of three nucleotides in length cannot be removed.\n\nE. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 17 amino acids.", "solution": "The central principle required to solve this problem is the nature of the genetic code and the concept of a reading frame. The genetic code is a triplet code, meaning that the sequence of nucleotides in a messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecule is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three. Each group of three nucleotides is called a codon, and it specifies a particular amino acid (or a stop signal).\n\nThe reading frame is the specific way in which the sequence of nucleotides is partitioned into codons. A continuous coding sequence is established when the ribosome initiates translation at a start codon (usually AUG) and reads in triplets from that point onwards.\n\nIn this problem, a gene's pre-mRNA is processed. The process of splicing removes introns and joins exons together to form the mature mRNA. In the standard case, all five exons are joined, creating a continuous reading frame. In the case of alternative splicing described, Exon 4 is skipped. This means that Exon 3 is ligated directly to Exon 5.\n\nThe length of the skipped Exon 4 is 50 nucleotides. For the reading frame to be maintained across the new splice junction (between Exon 3 and Exon 5), the number of nucleotides removed must be an integer multiple of 3. If a multiple of 3 nucleotides is removed, an integer number of codons is removed, and the reading frame downstream of the deletion remains aligned as before.\n\nLet's analyze the number of nucleotides removed: 50. We check if 50 is a multiple of 3.\n$$\n\\frac{50}{3} = 16.666...\n$$\nSince 50 is not an integer multiple of 3, removing this exon will cause a frameshift mutation. After Exon 3, the ribosome will continue reading in triplets, but because 50 nucleotides are missing, the grouping of nucleotides into codons will be shifted. For example, if the original sequence was `...AAA GGG CCC TTT...` where `AAA` is the last codon in Exon 3 and `GGG` is the first codon in Exon 4, and let's say after 50 nucleotides the sequence at the start of Exon 5 is `UUU`, the new sequence becomes `...AAA UUU...`. However, the shift is more complex. The removal of 50 nucleotides means the removal of 16 full codons and 2 extra nucleotides ($50 = 16 \\times 3 + 2$). This 2-nucleotide deficit will cause all subsequent codons to be read out of frame. This altered sequence of codons will almost certainly code for a completely different sequence of amino acids. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation very often introduces a premature stop codon, leading to the synthesis of a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option claims the reading frame is preserved. This is incorrect, as 50 is not a multiple of 3. The calculation of 16 amino acids comes from $50 \\div 3 \\approx 16$, which ignores the remainder and its effect on the reading frame.\n\nB. This option correctly states that the reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction. This is the direct and unavoidable consequence of deleting a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of 3.\n\nC. This option suggests the ribosome can compensate for the change. Ribosomes do not have such a mechanism; they slavishly read the mRNA in triplets from the start codon. They cannot \"skip over\" or correct a frameshift in the mRNA template.\n\nD. This option claims splicing is blocked. This is incorrect. The splicing machinery recognizes specific sequences at the exon-intron boundaries (splice donor and acceptor sites), not the length of the exon in relation to the genetic code. Alternative splicing is a regulated process that allows for the skipping of exons regardless of their length.\n\nE. This option, like A, incorrectly claims the reading frame is preserved. The calculation of 17 amino acids is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and certain consequence is a shift in the reading frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468325"}]}
