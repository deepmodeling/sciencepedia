{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The removal of introns from a pre-mRNA transcript is a marvel of molecular precision, executed by the spliceosome. This process relies on the recognition of short, conserved sequences that act as signposts, guiding the machinery to the correct splice sites. Without these signposts, the entire process can fail.\n\nThis first exercise [@problem_id:2336692] explores the dire consequences of losing one such critical signal: the intronic branch point. By working through this scenario, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the foundational chemical mechanism of splicing and understand why each component of the splice site consensus is non-negotiable for producing a functional mRNA.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the initial transcript of a protein-coding gene, known as pre-mRNA, contains both coding regions (exons) and non-coding regions (introns). The process of RNA splicing removes introns and joins exons to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) that can be translated into a protein. This process is carried out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome.\n\nConsider a hypothetical human gene, `REG1`, which is composed of three exons and two introns arranged in the following sequence: Exon 1 - Intron 1 - Exon 2 - Intron 2 - Exon 3. Splicing relies on the recognition of specific sequences at the boundaries of the intron and within it. One such critical sequence is the branch point, located upstream of the 3' end of the intron, which contains an essential adenosine nucleotide required for initiating the splicing reaction.\n\nA patient is identified with a genetic disorder caused by a specific mutation in the `REG1` gene. DNA sequencing reveals that a small deletion has occurred, completely removing the branch point sequence within Intron 2, but leaving Intron 1, all exons, and all other splicing signal sequences (such as the 5' and 3' splice sites) intact.\n\nAssuming the cell's transcription and splicing machinery are otherwise functioning normally, which of the following statements most accurately describes the structure of the `REG1` mRNA molecule that will be predominantly produced in this patient?\n\nA. The mature mRNA will consist of Exon 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3, correctly joined together.\n\nB. The mature mRNA will consist of Exon 1 joined directly to Exon 3, with Exon 2 being skipped.\n\nC. The mRNA transcript will consist of Exon 1 and Exon 2, with transcription terminating before Intron 2.\n\nD. The mRNA transcript will consist of Exon 1, Exon 2, Intron 2, and Exon 3, as Intron 2 fails to be removed.\n\nE. No pre-mRNA will be transcribed from the `REG1` gene due to the mutation.", "solution": "Splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA requires the spliceosome to recognize conserved intronic elements: the 5' splice site, the branch point (containing an essential adenosine), the polypyrimidine tract, and the 3' splice site. The chemical mechanism proceeds via two transesterification reactions:\n- First, the 2' hydroxyl of the branch point adenosine attacks the phosphate at the 5' splice site, generating a lariat intermediate and releasing the upstream exon with a free 3' hydroxyl.\n- Second, the 3' hydroxyl of the upstream exon attacks the phosphate at the 3' splice site, ligating the two exons and releasing the lariat intron.\n\nIf the branch point sequence within an intron is deleted, the first transesterification cannot occur because the required branch point adenosine is absent. Consequently, that intron cannot be removed, even if the 5' and 3' splice site consensus sequences remain intact.\n\nApplying this to the described mutation in Intron 2 of the REG1 gene:\n- Intron 1 retains all necessary splicing signals, so it can be removed normally, joining Exon 1 to Exon 2.\n- Intron 2 lacks the branch point, so the spliceosome cannot form the lariat for Intron 2, and splicing of Intron 2 fails. Therefore, Exon 2 cannot be ligated to Exon 3 through the normal pathway.\n- Transcription per se is unaffected by a splicing signal deletion, so pre-mRNA is still synthesized and includes all exons and introns initially. The predominant processed RNA will retain Intron 2.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because proper removal of Intron 2 requires the branch point.\n- B is unlikely because exon skipping across Exon 2 would still require functional splicing at the 3' end of Intron 2, which depends on the branch point; without it, efficient exon skipping is not supported and is not the predominant outcome as framed.\n- C is incorrect because splicing defects do not cause premature transcription termination at Intron 2.\n- D is correct: Intron 2 fails to be removed, yielding Exon 1–Exon 2–Intron 2–Exon 3 as the predominant transcript.\n- E is incorrect because transcription initiation and elongation are unaffected by the intronic branch point deletion.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2336692"}, {"introduction": "While the core splicing machinery is universal, its application is remarkably flexible. Cells exploit this flexibility through alternative splicing, a process that allows a single gene to generate a diverse array of protein isoforms by selectively including or excluding certain exons. This regulation is key to cellular differentiation and function.\n\nThis problem [@problem_id:2336712] presents a classic mechanism of splicing regulation: steric hindrance via an RNA secondary structure. You will analyze how a mutation that disrupts a regulatory stem-loop can flip a molecular switch, changing the exon composition of the final mRNA. This thought experiment highlights the dynamic interplay between RNA sequence, structure, and the splicing machinery in controlling gene expression.", "problem": "A hypothetical human gene, `Neuroligin-Alpha` (`NLGA`), is essential for proper neural development. Its pre-mRNA transcript undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing. In non-neuronal cells, a pair of mutually exclusive exons, Exon 4A and Exon 4B, are key to producing a non-functional truncated protein, effectively silencing the gene's expression in these tissues. The linear arrangement of the relevant exons on the pre-mRNA is: `...-Exon 3 - Intron 3 - Exon 4A - Intron 4 - Exon 4B - Intron 5 - Exon 5-...`, where Exons 3 and 5 are constitutive.\n\nIn wild-type non-neuronal cells, the splicing is regulated by an RNA secondary structure. A specific sequence within Intron 3, located immediately downstream of Exon 4A's 3' splice site, folds back to form a highly stable stem-loop. This structure physically masks the branch point sequence and the 3' splice site associated with Exon 4A, thereby preventing the binding of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and other essential splicing factors. As a consequence, the spliceosome bypasses Exon 4A, and the default splicing pathway joins Exon 3 to Exon 4B, which is then joined to Exon 5. The resulting mature mRNA isoform includes Exon 4B.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where a mutation is introduced into the `NLGA` gene. This mutation consists of several nucleotide substitutions within the stem-forming region of Intron 3, completely abolishing the formation of the regulatory stem-loop. Assume that the intrinsic strengths of the splice sites (the 5' and 3' consensus sequences) for both Exon 4A and Exon 4B are comparable and that the spliceosome machinery is fully functional.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most likely primary effect of this mutation on the population of mature `NLGA` mRNA transcripts produced in these non-neuronal cells?\n\nA. The majority of transcripts will now contain Exon 4A instead of Exon 4B.\n\nB. Splicing will be completely inhibited, leading to the rapid degradation of all `NLGA` pre-mRNA and no mature transcript formation.\n\nC. The majority of mature transcripts will contain both Exon 4A and Exon 4B ligated together in sequence.\n\nD. The splicing pattern will be unchanged from the wild-type, with the majority of transcripts still containing only Exon 4B.\n\nE. The majority of transcripts will skip both Exon 4A and Exon 4B, resulting in the direct ligation of Exon 3 to Exon 5.", "solution": "The pre-mRNA structure is ordered as Exon 3 - Intron 3 - Exon 4A - Intron 4 - Exon 4B - Intron 5 - Exon 5, with Exons 3 and 5 constitutive and Exons 4A and 4B mutually exclusive. In wild-type non-neuronal cells, a stable stem-loop in Intron 3 immediately downstream of the Exon 4A 3' splice site occludes both the branch point and the 3' splice site of Exon 4A. Mechanistically, spliceosome assembly begins with U1 snRNP recognition of the 5' splice site at the end of Exon 3 and requires U2 snRNP binding to the branch point upstream of a 3' splice site to define the partner intron-exon junction. Because the stem-loop masks the Exon 4A branch point and 3' splice site, U2 cannot bind there, so the spliceosome scans to and utilizes the next accessible downstream 3' splice site, which is associated with Exon 4B. Consequently, Exon 3 is ligated to Exon 4B, and then Exon 4B to Exon 5, producing an isoform containing Exon 4B.\n\nThe mutation removes the stem-loop by disrupting the base-pairing required to form it. This unmasking restores accessibility of the Exon 4A branch point and 3' splice site. Given the stated assumptions that the intrinsic splice site strengths for Exons 4A and 4B are comparable and the spliceosome is fully functional, the spliceosome will now be able to recognize and pair the Exon 3 5' splice site with the first available downstream 3' splice site and branch point, which are those of Exon 4A. Co-transcriptional splicing and kinetic competition generally favor the proximal, newly accessible 3' splice site when splice sites have similar strengths. Because Exons 4A and 4B are mutually exclusive, commitment to Exon 4A usage precludes inclusion of Exon 4B in the same transcript; after Exon 3 is spliced to Exon 4A, the downstream splicing event will favor skipping Exon 4B and ligating Exon 4A to Exon 5.\n\nAlternative outcomes are less likely under the given conditions: complete inhibition of splicing is not expected because splice sites are intact and accessible; inclusion of both Exon 4A and Exon 4B contradicts mutual exclusivity and the typical pairing logic of competing 3' splice sites; unchanged splicing would require the persistence of Exon 4A repression, which is specifically removed by the mutation; and skipping of both Exon 4A and Exon 4B is disfavored when both exons present comparable, accessible splice sites.\n\nTherefore, the primary effect is a switch in exon choice from Exon 4B to Exon 4A, making transcripts with Exon 4A the majority.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2336712"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists know which version of a gene is being made in a cell?

Researchers are studying the gene for Kinase Regulatory Factor 1 (KRF1), which is involved in myoblast differentiation. They suspect that a signaling molecule, MyoStimulin, alters the splicing pattern of the KRF1 pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA).\n\nSpecifically, their attention is on the splicing event that joins Exon 2 to Exon 3. The pre-mRNA for KRF1 contains two competing 3' splice sites for Exon 3. The first is a distal site (let's call it 3'SS_A), and the second is a proximal site (3'SS_B), located upstream of 3'SS_A. Splicing from the 5' splice site of Exon 2 to 3'SS_A produces a long isoform of the mRNA, while splicing to 3'SS_B produces a short isoform.\n\nTo quantify this effect, the researchers performed a Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiment on myoblasts under two conditions: untreated (control) and treated with MyoStimulin. They counted the number of sequence reads that span the exon-exon junctions, which directly reflects the abundance of each spliced isoform.\n\nThe data are as follows:\n- **Untreated (Control) Cells:**\n  - Number of junction reads from Exon 2 to the distal site 3'SS_A: 1850\n  - Number of junction reads from Exon 2 to the proximal site 3'SS_B: 150\n- **MyoStimulin-Treated Cells:**\n  - Number of junction reads from Exon 2 to the distal site 3'SS_A: 450\n  - Number of junction reads from Exon 2 to the proximal site 3'SS_B: 1350\n\nThe fractional usage of a specific splice site is defined as the number of reads supporting that site divided by the total number of reads supporting either of the competing sites for that splicing event.
