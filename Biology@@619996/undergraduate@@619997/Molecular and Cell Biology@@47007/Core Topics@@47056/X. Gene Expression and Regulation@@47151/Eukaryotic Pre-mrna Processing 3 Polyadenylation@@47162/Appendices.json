This first practice explores the foundational step of 3' end processing by examining a scenario where the key recognition factor, CPSF, is unable to perform its initial function. By predicting the consequences of this failure, you will solidify your understanding of the sequential and dependent nature of mRNA maturation [@problem_id:2314842].", "problem": "In eukaryotic gene expression, a newly transcribed pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) must undergo several processing steps to become a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) ready for translation. One crucial step is 3' end processing, which involves cleavage of the pre-mRNA and the addition of a poly(A) tail. This process is initiated by the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) recognizing a highly conserved $\\text{AAUAAA}$ sequence, known as the polyadenylation signal, within the pre-mRNA's 3' untranslated region. The binding of CPSF is the first step in recruiting a large protein complex that carries out both cleavage and polyadenylation.\n\nImagine you are studying a mutant cell line where the gene encoding CPSF has a specific defect. This defect prevents the CPSF protein from binding to the $\\text{AAUAAA}$ signal sequence, but the protein is otherwise synthesized and stable. For a typical gene being transcribed in these mutant cells, what would be the most direct and primary consequence for its pre-mRNA transcript?\n\nA. The pre-mRNA will be properly capped and spliced but will be translated into a non-functional protein due to the lack of a poly(A) tail.\n\nB. The pre-mRNA will fail to undergo endonucleolytic cleavage at its 3' end, and consequently, a poly(A) tail will not be added.\n\nC. The pre-mRNA will be cleaved at the correct location, but the enzyme Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP) will be unable to synthesize the poly(A) tail.\n\nD. RNA Polymerase II will terminate transcription immediately upon transcribing the $\\text{AAUAAA}$ sequence, producing a severely truncated transcript.\n\nE. The spliceosome will fail to assemble on the pre-mRNA, leading to the retention of all introns in the final transcript.", "solution": "The solution requires a step-by-step analysis of the 3' end processing pathway of eukaryotic pre-mRNA and an understanding of the specific role of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF).\n\nFirst, let's outline the canonical sequence of events for 3' end processing:\n1.  As RNA Polymerase II transcribes a gene, it proceeds past the coding sequence and into the 3' untranslated region.\n2.  A specific polyadenylation signal sequence, typically $\\text{AAUAAA}$, is transcribed into the pre-mRNA.\n3.  The Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) recognizes and binds to this $\\text{AAUAAA}$ sequence. This is the key initiation event.\n4.  The binding of CPSF facilitates the recruitment of other essential protein factors to the pre-mRNA. These include the Cleavage Stimulatory Factor (CstF), which binds to a G/U-rich region further downstream, and two cleavage factors (CFI and CFII).\n5.  This entire assembly forms a stable complex on the pre-mRNA that positions an endonuclease to cleave the transcript. The cleavage occurs at a specific site, usually 10-35 nucleotides downstream from the $\\text{AAUAAA}$ signal.\n6.  The cleavage event creates a new 3' end with a free hydroxyl (-OH) group on the upstream portion of the transcript. The downstream portion is degraded.\n7.  The enzyme Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP), which was part of the recruited complex, is then able to add a long sequence of adenine residues (the poly(A) tail) to the newly formed 3'-OH group.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of the specified mutation. The problem states that CPSF is unable to bind to the $\\text{AAUAAA}$ signal sequence.\n\n- Since CPSF binding (Step 3) is the foundational step for the entire process, its failure will prevent the subsequent steps from occurring.\n- Without CPSF bound to the $\\text{AAUAAA}$ signal, the stable platform required for the recruitment of CstF, CFI, and CFII (Step 4) will not form.\n- Consequently, the complete cleavage complex will not assemble on the pre-mRNA.\n- Without the assembled cleavage complex, the endonucleolytic cut will not be made (failure of Step 5).\n- Because cleavage does not occur, no new 3'-OH group is generated at the correct position (failure of Step 6).\n- Without this free 3'-OH substrate, Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP) has nothing to add adenine nucleotides to, so the poly(A) tail cannot be synthesized (failure of Step 7).\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence is the failure of both cleavage and polyadenylation. This leads us to evaluate the given options:\n\n- **A:** This is incorrect. An mRNA lacking a poly(A) tail is highly unstable in the nucleus and is not efficiently exported to the cytoplasm for translation. It would be rapidly degraded, not translated.\n- **B:** This is correct. The failure of CPSF to bind prevents the assembly of the cleavage machinery. Without cleavage, there is no substrate for polyadenylation. This option accurately describes the immediate and cascading failures in the pathway.\n- **C:** This is incorrect. It states that cleavage occurs correctly. This is false because the cleavage event itself is dependent upon the initial binding of CPSF and the assembly of the full protein complex. If CPSF does not bind, cleavage cannot occur.\n- **D:** This is incorrect. In fact, the opposite is thought to occur. The cleavage event at the poly(A) site is coupled to transcription termination (e.g., via the \"torpedo model\"). A failure to cleave often leads to a failure to terminate, causing RNA Polymerase II to continue transcribing far beyond the normal end of the gene. This results in an abnormally long transcript, not a truncated one.\n- **E:** This is incorrect. Splicing, the removal of introns, is carried out by the spliceosome. While there is evidence for \"coupling\" between splicing and 3' end processing, CPSF is not a core component of the spliceosome. The absence of CPSF binding would not directly inhibit the fundamental catalytic activity of the spliceosome.\n\nIn conclusion, the inability of CPSF to bind to its recognition site halts the 3' processing pathway at its inception, preventing both cleavage and the subsequent polyadenylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2314842"}, {"introduction": "Biological processes are rarely all-or-nothing; their efficiency is a critical determinant of cellular outcomes. This exercise moves from mechanism to quantification, asking you to trace the effect of a common genetic variant that reduces, but does not eliminate, polyadenylation efficiency. This practice will help you appreciate how variations in regulatory sequences quantitatively impact the final yield of functional protein [@problem_id:2314793].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the process of generating a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) from a precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA) involves several critical modifications. One such modification is the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3' end, a process known as polyadenylation. This process is guided by a specific nucleotide sequence in the pre-mRNA known as the polyadenylation signal (PAS). The most common and efficient canonical PAS is the sequence $\\text{AAUAAA}$.\n\nA researcher is studying a gene where a common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) has altered the canonical PAS from $\\text{AAUAAA}$ to $\\text{AUUAAA}$. Experimental data indicates that the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery processes pre-mRNA transcripts containing the $\\text{AUUAAA}$ signal with only 65% of the efficiency of transcripts that have the canonical $\\text{AAUAAA}$ signal.\n\nAssuming that the rate of transcription, the efficiency of all splicing events, the export of mature mRNA from the nucleus, the stability of the polyadenylated mRNA in the cytoplasm, and the rate of translation per mRNA molecule are all unaffected by this single nucleotide change, what is the most likely outcome for the production of functional protein from the gene with the $\\text{AUUAAA}$ signal compared to the gene with the canonical $\\text{AAUAAA}$ signal?\n\nA. The amount of functional protein will be approximately 65% of the original amount.\n\nB. The amount of functional protein will be significantly less than 65% of the original amount due to compounded negative effects on mRNA stability and translation.\n\nC. The amount of functional protein will not change, as the protein-coding sequence of the gene remains unaltered.\n\nD. The amount of functional protein will increase, as the $\\text{AUUAAA}$ variant is a known enhancer element in certain cellular contexts.\n\nE. No functional protein will be produced, as any mutation in the canonical PAS completely abolishes polyadenylation.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the effect of a mutation in the polyadenylation signal (PAS) on the final quantity of functional protein produced. We can solve this by tracing the steps of gene expression from transcription to translation and considering the impact of the specified change at each stage.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of pre-mRNA transcripts produced by transcription per unit time. The problem states that the rate of transcription is unaffected by the mutation, so $N$ is the same for both the gene with the canonical ($\\text{AAUAAA}$) and the variant ($\\text{AUUAAA}$) PAS.\n\nThe key step affected is the 3' end processing, specifically cleavage and polyadenylation.\nFor the canonical gene ($\\text{AAUAAA}$), let's assume the processing efficiency is 100% (or some baseline efficiency $\\epsilon_{canonical}$). The number of mature, polyadenylated mRNA molecules produced is proportional to $N \\times \\epsilon_{canonical}$.\n\nFor the variant gene ($\\text{AUUAAA}$), the problem states that the processing efficiency is 65% of the canonical efficiency. Therefore, the number of mature, polyadenylated mRNA molecules produced is proportional to $N \\times (0.65 \\times \\epsilon_{canonical})$.\nThis means that for every 100 pre-mRNA transcripts produced, only 65 will be successfully processed into mature mRNA, while the remaining 35 are likely degraded in the nucleus as they are not properly terminated.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial simplifying assumption: all subsequent steps are unaffected on a per-molecule basis. Let's analyze these steps:\n1.  **mRNA Export:** Only properly processed, mature mRNA is efficiently exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Since the amount of mature mRNA produced by the variant gene is 65% of the canonical gene, the amount of mRNA exported to the cytoplasm will also be 65% of the canonical amount.\n2.  **mRNA Stability:** The problem states that the stability of the polyadenylated mRNA is unaffected. This means that once an mRNA molecule is successfully polyadenylated and exported, its half-life in the cytoplasm is the same regardless of whether it came from a canonical or variant transcript.\n3.  **Translation Rate:** The problem states that the rate of translation *per mRNA molecule* is unchanged. This means that each individual mature mRNA molecule, once in the cytoplasm, will serve as a template for protein synthesis with the same efficiency.\n\nCombining these points, the total amount of protein synthesized is the product of the number of available mature mRNA templates and the translation rate per template. Since the number of mature mRNA templates in the cytoplasm for the variant gene is 65% of that for the canonical gene, and the translation rate per template is the same, the total amount of functional protein produced will be 65% of the amount produced by the canonical gene.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this reasoning:\n*   **A. The amount of functional protein will be approximately 65% of the original amount.** This matches our conclusion. The reduction in processing efficiency directly propagates to a proportional reduction in the final protein product, given the assumptions.\n*   **B. The amount of functional protein will be significantly less than 65%...** This is incorrect. It suggests a compounding effect, but the problem explicitly assumes that downstream processes like stability and translation rate per molecule are unaffected.\n*   **C. The amount of functional protein will not change...** This is incorrect. It ignores the critical role of non-coding regulatory sequences, like the PAS, in controlling gene expression levels.\n*   **D. The amount of functional protein will increase...** This contradicts the information given in the problem, which specifies a *reduction* in processing efficiency.\n*   **E. No functional protein will be produced...** This is incorrect. Biological signals are often not all-or-nothing. The problem states the efficiency is 65%, not 0%, indicating that processing still occurs, albeit less efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the only bottleneck introduced is the 3' processing step, which reduces the pool of mature mRNA to 65% of the normal level, leading directly to a 65% protein output.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2314793"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of molecular mechanisms opens the door to designing powerful therapeutic interventions.
