This first exercise explores the foundational principle of how the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) identifies its targets. By considering a mutation in a key recognition signal, the Destruction Box (D-box), you will predict the consequences of failed molecular \"handshaking\" and solidify your understanding of why substrate recognition is critical for mitotic progression. [@problem_id:2340440]", "problem": "The progression through the stages of mitosis is a tightly regulated process, orchestrated by the timely synthesis and degradation of key regulatory proteins. One of the central players in this process is the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a large E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC targets specific proteins for destruction by the proteasome by marking them with ubiquitin chains. Recognition of these target proteins by the APC often depends on short amino acid sequences within the protein, such as the Destruction Box (D-box).\n\nConsider a hypothetical protein, Mitotic Progression Factor X (MPF-X), which is essential for maintaining the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. To allow the cell to transition from metaphase to anaphase, MPF-X must be rapidly degraded. A researcher discovers a cell line with a specific mutation in the gene encoding MPF-X. This mutation results in a change to the amino acid sequence of the protein's D-box, rendering it unrecognizable by the APC.\n\nAssuming all other cellular processes are normal, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this D-box mutation for the cell?\n\nA. The concentration of MPF-X will be abnormally low throughout mitosis, preventing chromosomes from aligning correctly at the metaphase plate.\n\nB. The MPF-X protein will be hyper-ubiquitinated and degraded prematurely during prophase, leading to a failure in spindle formation.\n\nC. The MPF-X protein will fail to be degraded at the end of metaphase, causing the cell to arrest and preventing the onset of anaphase.\n\nD. The mutation will have no significant effect on the cell cycle, as other proteolytic enzymes will degrade MPF-X in place of the APC-proteasome system.\n\nE. The synthesis of MPF-X will be inhibited, leading to a failure to enter mitosis from the G2 phase.", "solution": "We begin with the principle that the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes specific degradation motifs, such as the D-box, on target proteins and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin, enabling proteasomal degradation. Recognition of the D-box is necessary for efficient polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation.\n\nLet $[X](t)$ denote the concentration of MPF-X. Its temporal dynamics can be idealized by a first-order synthesis-degradation balance:\n$$\n\\frac{d[X]}{dt} = k_{s} - k_{d}[X],\n$$\nwhere $k_{s}$ is the synthesis rate and $k_{d}$ is the effective first-order degradation rate constant that depends on APC recognition of the D-box. When the D-box is intact, APC/C recognizes MPF-X, leading to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, so $k_{d}$ is determined primarily by APC activity. When the D-box is mutated and not recognized by APC/C, the APC-dependent ubiquitination pathway for MPF-X is effectively disabled. In that case, the APC-dependent contribution to $k_{d}$ approaches zero:\n$$\nk_{d} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{(for APC-dependent degradation of MPF-X)}.\n$$\nAs a result, during metaphase, MPF-X is no longer efficiently polyubiquitinated and does not undergo rapid proteasomal degradation at the point where its removal is required to permit anaphase onset. Therefore, $[X](t)$ remains abnormally high at the end of metaphase, and the specific function maintained by MPF-X (stabilizing chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate) persists beyond its proper time window.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that to allow the cell to transition from metaphase to anaphase, MPF-X must be rapidly degraded. If APC/C cannot recognize the D-box due to the mutation, this necessary degradation does not occur. Consequently, the cell fails to execute the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and arrests at metaphase.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because loss of APC recognition would not lower MPF-X concentration; it would stabilize it.\n- B is incorrect because the mutation prevents APC recognition, so hyper-ubiquitination and premature degradation would not occur.\n- C is correct: failure to degrade MPF-X at the end of metaphase prevents anaphase onset, leading to arrest.\n- D is incorrect because APC-proteasome targeting via the D-box is the principal pathway; other proteases do not generally compensate in a timely and regulated manner for this step.\n- E is incorrect because a D-box mutation affects degradation, not synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is metaphase arrest due to failure to degrade MPF-X at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2340440"}, {"introduction": "The APC/C does not work in isolation; it is the first step in a two-stage disposal system. This practice challenges you to distinguish between the act of \"tagging\" a protein for destruction (ubiquitination) and the actual process of \"destroying\" it (proteolysis). By analyzing a scenario where the cell's disposal machinery, the proteasome, is blocked, you can dissect the specific and distinct roles of the APC/C and the proteasome in controlling the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. [@problem_id:2340443]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the regulation of the cell cycle in a synchronized culture of eukaryotic cells. The transition from metaphase to anaphase is a critical, irreversible step controlled by a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase known as the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). The standard pathway for this transition is as follows: once all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle, the APC/C is activated. The active APC/C targets a protein called securin for ubiquitination. Securin is an inhibitor of a protease called separase. Degradation of securin by the cell's primary protein degradation machinery, the proteasome, liberates separase. Active separase then cleaves the cohesin complexes that hold sister chromatids together, allowing them to separate.\n\nIn a specific experiment, the biologist adds a potent and highly specific proteasome inhibitor to the cell culture. Experimental conditions are then adjusted such that the spindle assembly checkpoint is fully satisfied and the APC/C becomes catalytically active. Based on your understanding of this regulatory pathway, what is the most likely state of the chromosomes in these treated cells?\n\nA. Sister chromatids will separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, as anaphase proceeds normally.\n\nB. Sister chromatids will remain attached at their centromeres, and the cell will be arrested in a metaphase-like state.\n\nC. The chromosomes will decondense, and the cell will exit mitosis prematurely.\n\nD. Securin will fail to be ubiquitinated by the active APC/C, leading to a stable metaphase arrest.\n\nE. Separase will become hyperactive because it can no longer be degraded, leading to uncontrolled cleavage of cohesin.", "solution": "1. By pathway definition, the metaphase–anaphase transition requires APC/C activation once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied. The APC/C catalyzes polyubiquitination of specific substrates, notably securin and mitotic cyclins (e.g., cyclin B).\n\n2. Ubiquitination alone does not eliminate the substrate; proteolysis requires a functional 26S proteasome. Therefore, in the presence of a potent and specific proteasome inhibitor, APC/C substrates that are ubiquitinated will not be degraded.\n\n3. In untreated cells, APC/C-mediated degradation of securin relieves inhibition of separase. Active separase then cleaves cohesin complexes, allowing sister chromatids to separate, initiating anaphase.\n\n4. In the treated cells, despite APC/C being catalytically active and ubiquitinating securin, the proteasome is inhibited; thus securin is not degraded. Consequently, separase remains bound by securin and inactive. Without active separase, cohesin is not cleaved, so sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres.\n\n5. Additionally, APC/C also targets cyclin B for degradation to promote mitotic exit. With the proteasome inhibited, cyclin B is not degraded, sustaining cyclin-dependent kinase activity and preventing chromosome decondensation and mitotic exit. This reinforces a metaphase-like arrest rather than progression to anaphase or premature exit.\n\n6. Evaluating options:\n- A is incorrect because separase is not activated; sister chromatids cannot separate.\n- B is correct: sister chromatids remain attached at centromeres, producing a metaphase-like arrest.\n- C is incorrect because mitotic exit requires cyclin B degradation, which is blocked.\n- D is incorrect because APC/C remains active and ubiquitinates securin; the block is at proteasomal degradation, not ubiquitination.\n- E is incorrect because separase is inhibited by non-degraded securin; it does not become hyperactive.\n\nTherefore, the most likely state is a metaphase-like arrest with sister chromatids remaining attached.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2340443"}, {"introduction": "A master regulator like the APC/C must have its activity tailored for different tasks at different times. This final exercise delves into the elegant temporal control exerted by co-activator proteins, Cdc20 and Cdh1, which act as \"specificity factors\" for the APC/C. By examining a mutation that disables one of these co-activators, you will uncover how the cell choreographs distinct events like sister chromatid separation and the final exit from mitosis. [@problem_id:2340491]", "problem": "In the cell cycle of budding yeast, the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase that orchestrates the transition from metaphase to anaphase and the subsequent exit from mitosis. The APC/C's activity is temporally regulated by its association with one of two co-activator proteins: Cdc20 or Cdh1. The APC/C-Cdc20 complex is active during metaphase and anaphase, targeting securin and M-phase cyclins for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of securin triggers sister chromatid separation. The APC/C-Cdh1 complex becomes active in late mitosis and remains so through the G1 phase, ensuring the complete degradation of M-phase cyclins. This full destruction of M-phase cyclins is necessary to lower the activity of M-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (M-Cdk) to a baseline level, a prerequisite for exiting mitosis and establishing a stable G1 phase.\n\nConsider a strain of haploid yeast with a temperature-sensitive mutation in the *CDH1* gene. At a permissive temperature of 25°C, the Cdh1 protein is functional. At a restrictive temperature of 37°C, the Cdh1 protein is completely non-functional. All other cellular proteins, including Cdc20, function normally at both temperatures.\n\nA culture of these yeast cells is synchronized in the G1 phase and grown at the permissive temperature. The culture is then shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37°C just as the cells enter M-phase. Which of the following options best describes the terminal phenotype of these cells?\n\nA. The cells will arrest in metaphase with a mitotic spindle and fully condensed chromosomes, but the sister chromatids will fail to separate.\n\nB. The cells will successfully separate their sister chromatids but will then arrest in a late mitotic state (anaphase/telophase) with high M-Cdk activity.\n\nC. The cells will complete mitosis and cytokinesis but will arrest permanently in the subsequent G1 phase, unable to initiate DNA replication.\n\nD. The cells will divide once and then undergo apoptosis due to checkpoint failure.\n\nE. The cells will fail to degrade M-phase cyclins, leading to an immediate re-entry into S-phase and endoreduplication (multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division).", "solution": "1) Recall the division of labor between APC/C co-activators. APC/C-Cdc20 is active at metaphase to anaphase, where it targets securin and a subset of M-phase cyclins for degradation. Securin degradation activates separase, which cleaves cohesin, enabling sister chromatid separation. APC/C-Cdh1 becomes active in late mitosis and throughout G1 to ensure the near-complete degradation of remaining M-phase cyclins, thereby reducing M-Cdk to a basal level required for mitotic exit and G1 establishment.\n\n2) Interpret the temperature-sensitive setup. Cells are synchronized in G1 at permissive temperature (Cdh1 functional), then shifted to restrictive temperature as they enter M-phase. Thus, during M-phase and mitotic exit, Cdh1 is nonfunctional, whereas Cdc20 remains fully functional.\n\n3) Predict events through metaphase and anaphase with Cdh1 nonfunctional but Cdc20 normal. Because APC/C-Cdc20 is intact, securin will be ubiquitinated and degraded. Consequently, separase is activated and sister chromatids separate. Therefore, metaphase arrest and failure of chromatid separation (as would occur if Cdc20 or APC/C were defective) will not occur.\n\n4) Predict events for mitotic exit. Full mitotic exit requires near-complete degradation of M-phase cyclins to reduce M-Cdk activity. This step critically depends on APC/C-Cdh1 in late mitosis and G1. With Cdh1 nonfunctional at restrictive temperature, the remaining M-phase cyclins are not efficiently degraded, so M-Cdk activity remains elevated.\n\n5) Consequence of elevated M-Cdk after anaphase onset. High M-Cdk activity blocks late mitotic events such as spindle disassembly, cytokinesis completion, and the biochemical transition to G1. Therefore, cells arrest in a late mitotic state (anaphase or telophase) with high M-Cdk activity.\n\n6) Evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because APC/C-Cdc20 is functional; securin is degraded and sister chromatids separate.\n- B is correct: sister chromatids separate (Cdc20-dependent), but cells fail to exit mitosis due to inability of APC/C-Cdh1 to clear M-phase cyclins, leaving high M-Cdk and a late mitotic arrest.\n- C is incorrect: they do not complete mitosis and cytokinesis; moreover, persistent high M-Cdk would prevent a stable G1 and licensing for S-phase.\n- D is incorrect: yeast do not undergo apoptosis in this context; the phenotype is a mitotic exit failure, not checkpoint-induced apoptosis.\n- E is incorrect: high M-Cdk prevents relicensing of replication origins, so immediate re-entry into S-phase and endoreduplication does not occur.\n\nTherefore, the terminal phenotype is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2340491"}]}
