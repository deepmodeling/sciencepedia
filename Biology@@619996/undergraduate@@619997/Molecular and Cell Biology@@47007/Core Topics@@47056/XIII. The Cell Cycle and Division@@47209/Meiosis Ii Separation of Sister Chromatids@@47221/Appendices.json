This first practice serves as a fundamental check on your ability to visualize and quantify the contents of a cell as it progresses through meiosis II. By correctly determining the number of chromosomes moving to a pole during anaphase II, you demonstrate an understanding of the transition from a cell with replicated chromosomes (each with two sister chromatids) to the formation of haploid daughter cells.

Karyotyping reveals that somatic cells of this organism have a diploid chromosome number of $2n=6$. Consider a single primary spermatocyte from this salamander undergoing meiosis to produce sperm.

Therefore the haploid number is\n$$\nn=\\frac{2n}{2}=\\frac{6}{2}=3.\n$$\nA primary spermatocyte is diploid ($2n$) and enters meiosis I. After meiosis I, homologous chromosomes have separated, producing two secondary spermatocytes, each with $n=3$ chromosomes, where each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids.\n\nIn meiosis II, a secondary spermatocyte undergoes metaphase II with $n=3$ replicated chromosomes aligned. During anaphase II, sister chromatids separate at the centromeres; each chromatid becomes an independent chromosome. From each of the $n=3$ replicated chromosomes, one chromatid migrates to each pole.

This exercise moves beyond the ideal scenario to the practical consequences of meiotic mistakes, a field with significant implications for human health and genetics. You are presented with the chromosomal content of four gametes and tasked with deducing the specific stage at which a segregation error, known as nondisjunction, occurred. This \"diagnostic\" approach is a key skill for understanding the origins of aneuploid conditions like Down syndrome. [@problem_id:2322258]", "problem": "In a study on human gametogenesis, a researcher analyzes the chromosomal content of gametes produced by a healthy male. For one particular meiotic event originating from a single primary spermatocyte, an unusual outcome is observed for chromosome 21. The four resulting spermatids have the following compositions with respect to chromosome 21: two spermatids are normal (each containing one copy of chromosome 21), one spermatid contains two copies of chromosome 21, and the final spermatid contains no copies of chromosome 21. Assume the segregation of all other chromosomes was normal.\n\nWhich of the following events provides the most direct and simplest explanation for this specific outcome?\n\nA. The homologous pair of chromosome 21 failed to separate during anaphase I.\n\nB. The sister chromatids of chromosome 21 failed to separate during anaphase II in both secondary spermatocytes.\n\nC. The sister chromatids of chromosome 21 failed to separate during anaphase II in one of the two secondary spermatocytes.\n\nD. Chromosome 21 failed to replicate during the S phase preceding meiosis.\n\nE. A failure of cytokinesis occurred after Meiosis I but not after Meiosis II.", "solution": "We analyze the segregation of chromosome 21 from a single primary spermatocyte through meiosis. In normal meiosis, meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, and meiosis II separates sister chromatids. A primary spermatocyte yields two secondary spermatocytes after meiosis I, and ultimately four spermatids after meiosis II.\n\nLet the two homologs of chromosome 21 be denoted by $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$. After normal meiosis I, each secondary spermatocyte receives one homolog, so the chromosome 21 content is $(1,1)$, where each $1$ represents one homolog present as a dyad (two sister chromatids). In normal meiosis II, sister chromatids separate, so each secondary spermatocyte yields two spermatids with one copy each, giving the final set $1,1,1,1$ with respect to chromosome 21.\n\nCompare each option to the observed outcome $1,1,2,0$ (two normal, one with two copies, one with zero copies):\n\nA. Nondisjunction of homologs at anaphase I: both $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ go to the same pole, producing secondary spermatocytes with contents $(2,0)$. After normal meiosis II, the $(2)$ cell yields two spermatids each with $2$ copies, and the $(0)$ cell yields two with $0$ copies. Final outcome: $2,2,0,0$, which does not match $1,1,2,0$.\n\nB. Nondisjunction of sister chromatids at anaphase II in both secondary spermatocytes: after normal meiosis I the contents are $(1,1)$. Each secondary spermatocyte undergoing nondisjunction at meiosis II yields one $2$-copy and one $0$-copy spermatid. Aggregated outcome: $2,0,2,0$, not $1,1,2,0$.\n\nC. Nondisjunction of sister chromatids at anaphase II in one secondary spermatocyte: after meiosis I the contents are $(1,1)$. One secondary spermatocyte undergoes nondisjunction at meiosis II, yielding $2$ and $0$; the other separates normally, yielding $1$ and $1$. Aggregated outcome: $2,0,1,1$, which exactly matches the observed $1,1,2,0$ distribution.\n\nD. Failure of chromosome 21 replication in S phase: without replication, sister chromatids are absent, so a gamete cannot receive $2$ copies by a single, simple segregation event; this cannot directly produce a $2$-copy spermatid without additional errors, and thus does not explain the observed pattern as simply as option C.\n\nE. Failure of cytokinesis after meiosis I alters cytoplasmic division rather than the specific segregation pattern needed to yield $1,1,2,0$ for a single chromosome. Without a specific nondisjunction event, it does not account for the observed distribution.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and simplest explanation is failure of sister chromatid separation during anaphase II in one of the two secondary spermatocytes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322258"}, {"introduction": "True mastery of cell biology comes from connecting macroscopic cellular events to their underlying molecular machinery. This advanced problem challenges you to do just that by exploring the molecular basis of sister chromatid separation. By considering a specific mutation in the meiotic cohesin protein Rec8, you can predict the large-scale consequences for chromosome segregation. This thought experiment highlights how a single molecular defect—in this case, the inability to be phosphorylated—can disrupt the entire meiotic program, reinforcing the critical role of protein regulation in maintaining genomic integrity. [@problem_id:2322251]", "problem": "In a hypothetical diploid organism with a somatic chromosome number of $2n=28$, the process of meiosis is crucial for generating haploid gametes. The separation of sister chromatids during anaphase II is a tightly regulated event, critically dependent on the phosphorylation of the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8. This phosphorylation event, primarily carried out by a Polo-like kinase, marks Rec8 for cleavage by the protease separase.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of this organism in which the wild-type gene for Rec8 has been completely replaced by a mutant allele. This allele produces a fully functional Rec8 protein, except for a key modification: all of its serine-threonine phosphorylation sites targeted by the Polo-like kinase have been mutated to alanine, rendering the protein non-phosphorylatable by this kinase.\n\nA primary spermatocyte from a male of this engineered strain undergoes meiosis. You may assume that all other cellular components and regulatory systems function perfectly, including the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) which becomes fully active at the metaphase-anaphase transition, and that the separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I occurs without any errors.\n\nGiven this scenario, what will be the distribution of chromosome numbers in the four spermatids that result from this single meiotic event?\n\nA. Four spermatids, each with 14 chromosomes.\n\nB. Two spermatids with 14 chromosomes, one spermatid with 15 chromosomes, and one spermatid with 13 chromosomes.\n\nC. Two spermatids with 15 chromosomes and two spermatids with 13 chromosomes.\n\nD. Two spermatids with 14 chromosomes and two spermatids with 0 chromosomes.\n\nE. One large cell containing 28 chromosomes that failed to divide, and two spermatids with 0 chromosomes.", "solution": "The organism is diploid with $2n=28$, so the haploid number is $n=14$. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate while sister chromatids remain conjoined at centromeres; by the problem’s assumption, meiosis I proceeds without error, yielding two secondary spermatocytes, each with $n=14$ chromosomes, where each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids.\n\nThe separation of sister chromatids in anaphase II requires separase-mediated cleavage of the cohesin subunit Rec8 at centromeres. Cleavage by separase depends on prior phosphorylation of Rec8 by a Polo-like kinase. In the engineered strain, all Polo-like kinase target serine-threonine sites on Rec8 are mutated to alanine, so Rec8 cannot be phosphorylated and thus cannot be cleaved by separase at anaphase II.\n\nTherefore, in meiosis II, centromeric cohesion persists, preventing the separation of sister chromatids. Functionally, this results in nondisjunction of all chromosomes in each meiosis II division: within each secondary spermatocyte, all chromosomes move together to one pole (as intact sister-chromatid pairs), producing one daughter cell that receives all $n=14$ chromosomes and one that receives $0$. Since there are two secondary spermatocytes, the final outcome across the two meiosis II divisions is two spermatids with $14$ chromosomes and two spermatids with $0$ chromosomes.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2322251"}]}
