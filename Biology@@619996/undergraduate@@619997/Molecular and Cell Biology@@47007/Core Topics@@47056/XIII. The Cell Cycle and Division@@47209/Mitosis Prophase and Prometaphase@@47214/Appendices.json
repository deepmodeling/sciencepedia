{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A foundational event in prophase is the condensation of DNA into visible chromosomes. This exercise utilizes a thought experiment to uncouple the process of chromosome condensation from the preceding S-phase DNA replication. By considering a hypothetical cell that bypasses S-phase, you can clarify the distinct contributions of replication (creating sister chromatids) and condensation (compacting chromatin) to the final structure of a prophase chromosome [@problem_id:2324680].", "problem": "In a typical eukaryotic cell cycle, a cell in the G1 phase contains a diploid ($2n$) number of chromosomes, with each chromosome consisting of a single Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule. The cell then proceeds through the S phase, where its DNA is replicated, and the G2 phase, before entering mitosis (M phase).\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a researcher treats a population of cultured animal cells with a chemical agent. This agent effectively disables the G1/S checkpoint, causing cells to proceed directly from the G1 phase into the M phase, completely bypassing the S and G2 phases.\n\nAssuming such a cell successfully enters prophase, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of its chromosomes?\n\nA. Each chromosome would appear as a classic 'X' shape, composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\nB. The DNA would fail to condense, remaining as a diffuse mass of chromatin.\nC. The cell would contain half the diploid number of chromosomes ($n$), and each would consist of a single chromatid.\nD. Each chromosome would be condensed and visible, but would consist of only a single chromatid rather than two sister chromatids.\nE. The cell would contain the diploid number of chromosomes (2n), but they would be fragmented into numerous small pieces due to the stress of premature condensation.", "solution": "A diploid somatic cell in G1 contains $2n$ chromosomes, each chromosome being a single, continuous DNA molecule organized with associated proteins; structurally, each chromosome in G1 consists of one chromatid. During a normal cell cycle, passage through S phase replicates the DNA so that each chromosome comprises two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere; by G2 and prophase, these duplicated chromosomes condense and the characteristic 'X' shape reflects the paired sister chromatids.\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, disabling the G1/S checkpoint and forcing cells to bypass S and G2 means no DNA replication occurs. Therefore, when such a cell enters prophase, mitotic condensation mechanisms (e.g., condensin loading and mitotic kinase activity) can still compact the chromosomes, but there will be no sister chromatid pairs because replication never took place. Consequently:\n- The chromosome number remains $2n$ (no reduction in chromosome number occurs without meiosis or chromosome loss).\n- Each chromosome can condense and become visible in prophase.\n- Each condensed chromosome will consist of a single chromatid rather than two sister chromatids.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the 'X' shape requires sister chromatid formation in S phase.\n- B is incorrect because prophase triggers condensation; diffuse chromatin would not persist if the cell truly entered prophase.\n- C is incorrect because the chromosome number remains $2n$, not $n$.\n- D is correct: chromosomes will be condensed and visible, each as a single chromatid.\n- E is incorrect because fragmentation is not the expected consequence of bypassing S and G2; the defining effect here is absence of sister chromatids, not generalized fragmentation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that each chromosome is condensed and visible but consists of only a single chromatid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2324680"}, {"introduction": "The formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle is essential for accurately segregating chromosomes. This problem explores the mechanical basis of spindle assembly by focusing on Kinesin-5, a critical motor protein that pushes spindle poles apart. By analyzing the consequences of inhibiting this single molecular motor, you will gain insight into how opposing forces cooperate to build the complex machinery of mitosis and what happens when this delicate balance is disrupted [@problem_id:2324675].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanics of the cell cycle using a synchronized population of mammalian fibroblast cells. The biologist treats these cells with a newly developed small molecule inhibitor, \"Kinesin-X Block,\" just as the cells are about to enter M-phase. This inhibitor has been shown to specifically and completely disable the function of Kinesin-5, a motor protein essential for exerting the outward-pushing force that separates the duplicated centrosomes during prophase. All other cellular processes, including chromosome condensation, centriole duplication, and microtubule polymerization, remain unaffected by the drug.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence for a cell attempting to undergo mitosis in the presence of Kinesin-X Block?\n\nA. The cell will form a normal bipolar spindle but will be unable to condense its chromosomes, arresting in early prophase.\nB. The cell will successfully form a bipolar spindle and align its chromosomes at the metaphase plate, but will be unable to initiate anaphase.\nC. The cell will form a multipolar spindle, with three or more spindle poles, leading to immediate apoptotic cell death.\nD. The cell will fail to enter mitosis and will remain arrested in the G2 phase with duplicated, but unseparated, centrosomes.\nE. The cell will form a monopolar spindle, composed of a single aster of microtubules, and will arrest in a state resembling prometaphase.", "solution": "Kinesin-5 (also called Eg5) is a plus-end-directed, tetrameric kinesin that crosslinks antiparallel microtubules and generates the outward sliding force needed to separate duplicated centrosomes during prophase and to establish and maintain a bipolar spindle. Inhibition of Kinesin-5 abolishes this outward-pushing force.\n\nGiven that chromosome condensation, centriole duplication, and microtubule polymerization remain intact, the cells will still enter mitosis: chromosomes will condense, the nuclear envelope will break down, and microtubules will nucleate from the centrosomes. However, without Kinesin-5 activity, duplicated centrosomes fail to separate. In the absence of the Eg5-mediated outward force, inward-directed forces (for example, those mediated by dynein and other minus-end-directed activities) dominate, causing spindle microtubules to form a single aster focused around unseparated centrosomes. This results in a monopolar spindle, often termed a monoaster.\n\nBecause a bipolar spindle cannot form, kinetochores cannot achieve stable, amphitelic attachments, which activates the spindle assembly checkpoint. The cell arrests in a prometaphase-like state rather than progressing to metaphase or anaphase.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because chromosome condensation is unaffected by Kinesin-5 inhibition.\n- B is incorrect because a bipolar spindle does not form; thus, alignment at the metaphase plate and normal anaphase onset cannot occur.\n- C is incorrect because Kinesin-5 inhibition classically yields monopolar, not multipolar, spindles.\n- D is incorrect because cells do enter mitosis; the block occurs at spindle assembly, not at G2 entry.\n- E correctly states that a monopolar spindle forms and that the cell arrests in a prometaphase-like state.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate consequence is a monopolar spindle and prometaphase-like arrest.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2324675"}, {"introduction": "Successful cell division requires the precise connection of spindle microtubules to chromosomes at the kinetochore. This advanced practice bridges molecular biology and quantitative analysis by modeling how a physical property—centromeric strain from unresolved DNA tangles—can impact the probability of successful microtubule attachment [@problem_id:2324669]. Applying the provided mathematical model will challenge you to translate a biochemical defect, the inhibition of Topoisomerase II, into a predictable, quantitative outcome, reflecting how modern cell biology uses interdisciplinary approaches to understand complex systems.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a new chemotherapeutic agent called \"Catenan-lock,\" which is a highly specific inhibitor of Topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), an enzyme crucial for resolving the intertwined linkages (catenations) between sister chromatids during prophase. The biologist proposes a model where the failure to resolve these catenations results in persistent structural strain at the centromere, which in turn inhibits the proper assembly of the kinetochore complex required for microtubule attachment.\n\nAccording to the model, the probability, $P_{attach}$, of a single kinetochore successfully forming a stable attachment to a microtubule is dependent on the local centromeric strain, $\\sigma$, and is described by the equation:\n$$P_{attach}(\\sigma) = P_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_{c}}\\right)$$\nwhere $P_0$ is the maximum probability of attachment in a strain-free environment, and $\\sigma_{c}$ is a characteristic strain constant representing the sensitivity of the attachment process to strain.\n\nIn a normal, untreated cell, TOP2A functions perfectly, resolving all catenations and resulting in a centromeric strain of $\\sigma_{normal} = 0$.
