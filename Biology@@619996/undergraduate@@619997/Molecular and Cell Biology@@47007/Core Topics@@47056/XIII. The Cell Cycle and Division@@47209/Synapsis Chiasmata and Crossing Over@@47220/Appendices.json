By examining a cell under a microscope at the right stage, we can deduce fundamental information about an organism's genetic makeup.

Cells undergoing meiosis are isolated from the sporangia. One particular cell is observed to be in diakinesis, a late stage of prophase I. Within this cell, the genetic material is organized into 10 discrete, compact units. Each unit is a bivalent, which consists of a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes, and is therefore composed of a total of four chromatids. Based on this observation, determine the diploid number ($2n$) of this fern species.\n\n", "solution": "In diakinesis of prophase I, homologous chromosomes are paired as bivalents (tetrads). The number of bivalents observed equals the haploid number, $n$, because each bivalent represents one homologous pair.\n\nGiven that there are 10 bivalents observed, we have:\n$$\nn = 10.\n$$\nThe diploid number is twice the haploid number, so:\n$$\n2n = 2 \\times n = 2 \\times 10 = 20.\n$$\nTherefore, the diploid number of this fern species is 20.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$"}, {"introduction": "Having identified the structures of meiosis, we now turn to their primary function: generating genetic diversity. Crossing over between homologous chromosomes shuffles alleles, creating new combinations not present in the parents. This practice problem provides a scenario where you can quantitatively link the physical distance between genes on a chromosome to the expected frequency of recombinant offspring, a key skill in genetics for predicting inheritance patterns and constructing genetic maps [@problem_id:2340114].", "id": "2340114", "problem": "In the fictional bioluminescent fungus *Noctiluca phantasma*, two genes are of interest for their role in light production. The first gene, *LuxA*, controls the color of the light (Dominant allele $A$ for blue, recessive allele $a$ for green). The second gene, *RegB*, controls the light's intensity (Dominant allele $B$ for bright, recessive allele $b$ for dim). These two genes are known to be located on the same chromosome.\n\nA mycologist creates a heterozygous strain by crossing a pure-breeding blue, bright-glowing fungus ($AABB$) with a pure-breeding green, dim-glowing fungus ($aabb$). The resulting heterozygous fungus ($AaBb$) has the parental chromosome configuration where alleles $A$ and $B$ are on one chromosome, and alleles $a$ and $b$ are on the homologous chromosome.\n\nFrom extensive genomic sequencing and analysis of meiotic products, it has been determined that the physical distance between the *LuxA* locus and the *RegB* locus is 2.25 million base pairs (Mbp).

This final practice uses a hypothetical scenario—the failure of a key enzyme—to explore the molecular reality behind the chiasmata we observe. It forces us to consider that chiasmata are not merely points of contact but physical, covalent DNA links (Holliday junctions) that must be expertly resolved to allow homologous chromosomes to separate, underscoring the critical role of molecular machinery in ensuring the fidelity of meiosis [@problem_id:2340121].", "id": "2340121", "problem": "A hypothetical eukaryotic organism has a temperature-sensitive mutation in a gene encoding a crucial enzyme for meiosis. This enzyme, a resolvase, is responsible for resolving Holliday junctions, which are intermediate structures formed during crossing over. A cell from this organism is cultured under conditions that allow it to proceed through the early stages of meiosis I at a permissive temperature. During this time, chromosome replication, the synapsis of homologous chromosomes to form bivalents, and the formation of Holliday junctions all occur normally. Immediately before the onset of anaphase I, the temperature is shifted to a non-permissive level, which instantly and completely inactivates the resolvase enzyme.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best characterizes a structure that would be expected to persist as a direct consequence of this enzymatic failure and physically obstruct the proper segregation of chromosomes during anaphase I?\n\nA. The synaptonemal complex, holding homologous chromosomes together along their entire lengths.\nB. Bivalents in which homologous chromosomes remain interconnected by unresolved covalent DNA linkages at crossover sites.\nC. Prematurely separated sister chromatids, resulting in four distinct and unattached chromatids for each original homologous pair.\nD. Unpaired homologous chromosomes (univalents) that have failed to anaphase I spindle attachment.\nE. Chromosomes where the cohesion proteins between sister chromatid arms have been prematurely degraded.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the specific structural defect that arises from the failure to resolve Holliday junctions right before anaphase I and how this defect interferes with chromosome segregation. Let's analyze the process of meiosis I step-by-step to determine the consequence of the mutation.\n\n1.  **Initial Meiotic State**: The problem states that the cell successfully completes chromosome replication and synapsis. This means that each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, and homologous chromosomes have paired up to form bivalents. Furthermore, Holliday junctions have formed, which are the physical cross-shaped structures that link DNA molecules of non-sister chromatids at a site of genetic recombination (crossing over).\n\n2.  **Normal Progression from Prophase I to Anaphase I**: In a normal cell, after the pachytene stage of prophase I, the synaptonemal complex (which 'zips' the homologs together) disassembles during the diplotene stage. The homologous chromosomes are now held together only at the sites of crossing over, which are cytologically visible as chiasmata. The molecular basis for a chiasma is the Holliday junction. For the homologous chromosomes to be able to separate during anaphase I, these Holliday junctions must be resolved by specific enzymes called resolvases. Resolution involves cutting the intertwined DNA strands and re-ligating them to finalize the exchange of genetic material and, crucially, to disentangle the two homologous chromosomes. Following this, in anaphase I, the cohesin proteins holding the sister chromatid *arms* together are cleaved, while cohesin at the centromere is protected. This allows the homologs, now free from both the synaptonemal complex and the inter-homolog DNA links, to be pulled apart by the spindle fibers.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Defect**: In this scenario, the resolvase enzyme is inactivated just before anaphase I. This means that the Holliday junctions, which are physical, covalent links between the DNA of non-sister chromatids, cannot be cut and resolved.\n\n4.  **Consequence of the Defect**: Without the action of the resolvase, the homologous chromosomes within each bivalent remain physically and covalently tethered to each other at every site where a crossover was initiated. Even if the cohesin along the chromosome arms is degraded as it normally would be at the onset of anaphase I, this unresolved DNA linkage will persist.\n\n5.  **Impact on Anaphase I**: The fundamental goal of anaphase I is the separation of homologous chromosomes. The spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores of the homologous chromosomes (with sister kinetochores acting as a single unit) and pull them towards opposite poles. If the homologs are still covalently linked by unresolved Holliday junctions, they cannot be pulled apart. This will lead to a failure of segregation. The chromosomes will either form a 'bridge' across the metaphase plate or potentially break under the tension of the spindle forces.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A. The synaptonemal complex...**: This is incorrect. The synaptonemal complex normally disassembles in diplotene, well before anaphase I. The problem describes a defect in a later step (Holliday junction resolution), not in the disassembly of the synaptonemal complex.\n    *   **B. Bivalents in which homologous chromosomes remain interconnected by unresolved covalent DNA linkages...**: This is the correct description. The unresolved Holliday junctions are precisely these covalent DNA linkages. They persist and physically prevent the homologous chromosomes of the bivalent from separating during anaphase I.\n    *   **C. Prematurely separated sister chromatids...**: This is incorrect. Sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres throughout meiosis I and only separate during anaphase II. The described defect would prevent homolog separation, not cause premature sister chromatid separation.\n    *   **D. Unpaired homologous chromosomes (univalents)...**: This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that synapsis was successful, meaning the chromosomes are paired into bivalents. Univalents would result from a failure of synapsis or pairing.\n    *   **E. Chromosomes where the cohesion proteins between sister chromatid arms have been prematurely degraded.**: This describes an event that happens normally at the start of anaphase I. The degradation of arm cohesion is required to resolve chiasmata and allow homolog separation. The problem described here is that even with this degradation, the homologs remain physically linked at the DNA level. Therefore, this is not the defect itself.\n\nTherefore, the structure that persists and obstructs segregation is the bivalent with its homologous chromosomes still physically interlocked by unresolved DNA cross-links.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}]}
