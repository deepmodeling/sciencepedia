We apply standard chromosome and DNA accounting rules across cell cycle stages and meiotic divisions.\n\nA. A somatic skin cell in G1 has not yet undergone DNA replication. In G1, the number of chromosomes equals the diploid number:\n$$C_{\\text{G1}}=2n=28.$$\n\nB. A primary spermatocyte is a diploid cell that has completed S phase and is entering meiosis I. After S phase, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so the number of DNA molecules (each chromatid corresponds to one DNA double helix) doubles relative to G1. Thus, the chromosome count remains $2n$, but the DNA molecule count is $2 \\times 2n = 4n$ (if n is the haploid number). So the DNA molecule count is $2 \\times 28 = 56$.\n$$D_{\\text{primary spermatocyte}}=56.$$\n\nC. A secondary oocyte is produced after meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes segregate into different cells. After meiosis I, the cell is haploid in chromosome number (though each chromosome still has two sister chromatids), so:\n$$C_{\\text{secondary oocyte}}=n=14.$$\n\nD. During anaphase of mitosis in a single somatic cell, sister chromatids separate and each chromatid is counted as an independent chromosome.

A human diploid cell has $2n=46$ chromosomes; thus $46$ individual chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, align independently.\n- In meiosis I (metaphase I), homologous chromosomes pair to form tetrads (bivalents); therefore, there are $n=23$ aligned structures, each a homologous pair (tetrad), with two chromosomes (four chromatids) per structure.\n\nTherefore:\n- Cell A is in metaphase of mitosis (because it shows $46$ individually aligned replicated chromosomes).\n- Cell B is in metaphase I of meiosis (because it shows $23$ tetrads/bivalents).\n\nNow determine the outcomes upon completion of the respective full division processes.\n\nFor Cell A (mitosis):\n- Anaphase separates sister chromatids, distributing one chromatid from each chromosome to opposite poles.\n- Telophase and cytokinesis produce two daughter cells, each with the same chromosome number as the parent, i.e., $2n=46$. Immediately after division, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid; after S phase in the next cycle, chromosomes will replicate again.\n- The two daughter cells are genetically identical to each other (barring mutation), because mitosis preserves the genome without recombination or independent assortment.\n\nFor Cell B (meiosis, starting at metaphase I):\n- Anaphase I separates homologous chromosomes; sister chromatids remain together.\n- Telophase I and cytokinesis produce two cells that are haploid in chromosome set (each has $n=23$ chromosomes), but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids.\n- Meiosis II then separates sister chromatids, producing a total of four haploid cells, each with $n=23$ chromosomes, each chromosome now consisting of a single chromatid.\n- Due to independent assortment and crossing over in meiosis I, the final products are genetically distinct from each other.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n- A: False. Mitosis yields diploid daughters with $2n=46$, not haploid $23$.\n- B: False. Meiosis yields haploid products; not diploid $46$.\n- C: True.

A common cause of aneuploidy is nondisjunction, the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during cell division. Consider a developing primary spermatocyte in a healthy human male.

This produces one secondary spermatocyte that is disomic for chromosome 21 (containing two homologous copies) and one that is nullisomic (containing zero copies).\n- These cells then undergo meiosis II:\n  - The disomic secondary spermatocyte divides, separating sister chromatids. Both resulting gametes receive a copy of each homologous chromosome, making them disomic for chromosome 21 ($n+1$).\n  - The nullisomic secondary spermatocyte divides, producing two gametes that lack chromosome 21 ($n-1$).\n- Outcome: All four gametes are aneuploid: two with a chromosome number of $n+1$ and two with a chromosome number of $n-1$.\n\nScenario 2: Meiosis I normal; nondisjunction of sister chromatids of chromosome 21 in meiosis II in one secondary spermatocyte.\n- In meiosis I, homologs separate correctly; each secondary spermatocyte receives one chromosome 21.\n- In one secondary spermatocyte, meiosis II nondisjunction occurs for chromosome 21: both sister chromatids go to one gamete, leaving the other without chromosome 21. This yields one $n+1$ gamete and one $n-1$ gamete.\n- In the other secondary spermatocyte, meiosis II is normal: sister chromatids segregate equally, producing two normal gametes with one chromosome 21 each, i.e., $n$ and $n$.\n- Outcome: two normal gametes ($n$), one $n+1$ gamete, and one $n-1$ gamete.\n\nComparing with the options, this matches statement A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310397"}]}
