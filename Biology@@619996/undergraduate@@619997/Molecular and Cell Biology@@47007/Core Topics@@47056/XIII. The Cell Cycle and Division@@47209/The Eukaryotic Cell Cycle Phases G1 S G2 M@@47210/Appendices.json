This exercise provides a foundational check on your understanding of DNA content throughout the cell cycle's main phases. By calculating the DNA content in the G2 phase relative to the G1 phase [@problem_id:2341719], you will solidify the concept of the '$C$-value' notation and appreciate the direct outcome of the DNA synthesis (S) phase, which is the complete duplication of the genome.", "problem": "A researcher is studying the cell cycle of a diploid eukaryotic somatic cell. In the G1 (Gap 1) phase, which is the period of cell growth before the initiation of DNA replication, the cell is measured to have a total DNA content of $2C$. The cell then proceeds through the S (Synthesis) phase, where DNA replication occurs. Following the S phase, the cell enters the G2 (Gap 2) phase, and subsequently the M (Mitosis) phase for cell division. What is the expected total DNA content of this single somatic cell when it is in the G2 phase?\n\nA. $C$\nB. $2C$\nC. $3C$\nD. $4C$\nE. $8C$", "solution": "By definition, let $C$ denote the DNA content of a haploid genome. A diploid somatic cell in G1 has two haploid complements, so its total DNA content is $2C$.\n\nDuring the S phase, the fundamental principle is that DNA replication duplicates the entire genome without changing ploidy: each chromosome is replicated to form two sister chromatids. Thus, total DNA content doubles while chromosome number (ploidy) remains the same. Therefore, the transition in DNA content through S phase is\n$$2C \\longrightarrow 4C.$$\n\nIn G2, which follows completion of S phase and precedes mitosis, the cell has completed DNA replication and thus carries the doubled DNA content. Hence, the expected total DNA content in G2 is\n$$4C.$$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2341719"}, {"introduction": "A healthy cell cycle is not just about progression; it's about precision and control, enforced by checkpoints that prevent errors. This problem challenges you to think about the consequences when this control system fails, specifically focusing on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving a chromosome attachment error [@problem_id:2341705], you will explore how a single mitotic mistake can lead to aneuploidy, a condition linked to many diseases, thereby highlighting the critical role of checkpoints in maintaining genomic integrity.", "problem": "A somatic cell from a hypothetical diploid organism, with a normal diploid chromosome number of $2n=14$, is studied in culture. This cell line carries a loss-of-function mutation in a gene essential for the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), rendering the checkpoint non-functional. During a mitotic division, a single chromosome experiences a syntelic attachment, where the kinetochores of both of its sister chromatids attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. The cell proceeds through mitosis and completes cell division despite this error.\n\nWhich of the following describes the chromosomal number in the two resulting daughter cells?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will have 14 chromosomes.\nB. One daughter cell will have 13 chromosomes and the other will have 15 chromosomes.\nC. One daughter cell will have 14 chromosomes and the other will have 13 chromosomes.\nD. Both daughter cells will have 13 chromosomes.\nE. One daughter cell will have 7 chromosomes and the other will have 21 chromosomes.", "solution": "We are told the organism is diploid with $2n=14$, so $n=7$. In a normal somatic cell cycle, after DNA replication, there are still $14$ chromosomes (each duplicated), corresponding to $28$ sister chromatids at metaphase.\n\nGiven the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) is non-functional, a syntelic attachment on a single duplicated chromosome (i.e., both sister kinetochores attached to microtubules from the same pole) will not be corrected. At anaphase, cohesin is cleaved and both sister chromatids of that single chromosome will move to the same pole.\n\nCount the chromatids (which become chromosomes in the daughter cells):\n- For the $13$ properly attached duplicated chromosomes, each daughter receives $1$ chromatid from each, giving $13$ chromatids per daughter from these.\n- For the single syntelic chromosome, one daughter receives both sister chromatids ($2$), and the other receives none ($0$).\n\nTherefore, the daughter cells receive:\n$$\n\\text{Daughter A: } 13+2=15, \\quad \\text{Daughter B: } 13+0=13.\n$$\nThus one daughter has $15$ chromosomes and the other has $13$ chromosomes.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2341705"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical principles to experimental application is a key step in mastering cell biology. This problem puts you in the role of a researcher, asking you to predict the outcome of a sophisticated experiment designed to probe the G2/M transition. By considering the function of a genetically engineered Cyclin B protein [@problem_id:2341758], you will connect the molecular logic of protein localization with a common, powerful analytical technique—flow cytometry—to understand how scientists dissect the intricate regulatory networks of the cell cycle.", "problem": "In a cell biology research project, a team of scientists has engineered a human cell line to stably express a mutant form of Cyclin B. The wild-type Cyclin B protein is a critical regulator of the cell cycle, forming a complex with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1). This complex, known as the M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF), must accumulate in the nucleus to trigger the onset of mitosis. The engineered mutant Cyclin B contains a potent, dominant Nuclear Export Signal (NES), an amino acid sequence that continuously targets the protein for export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n\nAn asynchronous population of these engineered cells is cultured under normal growth conditions. After several population doublings, the cells are harvested, stained with a fluorescent dye that binds stoichiometrically to DNA, and analyzed using flow cytometry to generate a histogram of DNA content per cell. A normal, asynchronously dividing population of cells typically shows two prominent peaks corresponding to DNA content of $2C$ (for cells in G1 phase) and $4C$ (for cells in G2 and M phases), with a smaller population of cells distributed between these two peaks (representing cells in S phase).\n\nBased on the function of the mutant Cyclin B, which of the following outcomes best describes the expected cell cycle arrest point and the corresponding DNA content distribution for the engineered cell population?\n\nA. The cells will arrest in the G1 phase, leading to an accumulation of cells in the 2C DNA content peak.\nB. The cells will arrest during the S phase, resulting in a broad distribution of cells between the 2C and 4C DNA content values.\nC. The cells will arrest in the G2 phase, leading to an accumulation of cells in the 4C DNA content peak.\nD. The cells will arrest in the metaphase stage of mitosis, leading to an accumulation of cells in the 4C DNA content peak.\nE. The cell cycle will proceed without any significant arrest, and the DNA content distribution will be indistinguishable from that of a normal, wild-type cell population.", "solution": "We start from the fundamental role of Cyclin B in mitotic entry. Cyclin B binds CDK1 to form the M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF). The onset of mitosis requires active MPF to accumulate in the nucleus to phosphorylate nuclear substrates (for example, nuclear lamins to drive nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin-associated proteins to initiate chromosome condensation). Therefore, a necessary condition for mitotic entry is nuclear localization of active Cyclin B/CDK1.\n\nIn the engineered cells, Cyclin B carries a dominant Nuclear Export Signal (NES) that continuously drives the protein out of the nucleus. This dominant NES overrides nuclear accumulation, preventing Cyclin B from residing in the nucleus long enough to trigger the nuclear events of mitotic entry. Even if Cyclin B/CDK1 forms and becomes catalytically active in the cytoplasm, the failure to accumulate in the nucleus prevents phosphorylation of critical nuclear targets, so the G2/M transition cannot be executed.\n\nThus, cell cycle progression is expected to arrest at the G2/M checkpoint, before prophase, because the necessary nuclear pool of MPF is absent. Cells that have completed DNA replication will have duplicated genomes, corresponding to a DNA content of $4C$. Since they cannot enter mitosis, they will accumulate in G2 with $4C$ DNA content.\n\nFlow cytometry using a stoichiometric DNA-binding dye will therefore show an increased proportion of cells at the $4C$ peak. This excludes:\n- G1 arrest at $2C$ (option A), because Cyclin B acts at the G2/M boundary, not in G1.\n- S-phase arrest with a broad $2C$ to $4C$ distribution (option B), because Cyclin B is not the primary driver of S-phase progression.\n- Metaphase arrest at $4C$ (option D), because the cells fail to enter mitosis in the first place due to lack of nuclear MPF accumulation.\n- A normal distribution (option E), because the engineered export prevents proper mitotic entry, inducing arrest.\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome is arrest in G2 with accumulation at the $4C$ DNA content peak.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341758"}]}
