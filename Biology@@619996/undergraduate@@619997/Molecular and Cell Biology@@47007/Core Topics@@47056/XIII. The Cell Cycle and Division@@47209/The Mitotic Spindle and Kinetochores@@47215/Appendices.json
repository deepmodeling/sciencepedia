{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The formation of a functional mitotic spindle is a masterpiece of dynamic instability, relying on a precise balance between microtubule growth and shrinkage. This first exercise [@problem_id:2343010] invites us to explore this fundamental principle through a thought experiment. By considering the consequences of overexpressing the potent microtubule depolymerase Kinesin-13, we can develop a deeper intuition for how molecular regulators are essential for establishing the spindle's correct size and bipolar structure.", "problem": "The formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle is a complex and highly regulated process essential for accurate chromosome segregation. This structure is primarily composed of microtubules, which are dynamic polymers that can grow (polymerize) and shrink (depolymerize). The balance between these two activities is controlled by a variety of microtubule-associated proteins. One such protein is kinesin-13, a unique member of the kinesin superfamily that does not function as a typical motor protein but rather acts as a potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent microtubule depolymerase. It plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule length and dynamics throughout mitosis.\n\nImagine a cell biologist has created a genetically modified cell line in which the gene encoding kinesin-13 is constitutively overexpressed, leading to a significant surplus of the kinesin-13 protein within the cytoplasm. Based on the known function of kinesin-13, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence for this cell line as it attempts to undergo mitosis?\n\nA. The cells will form a hyper-elongated mitotic spindle with exceptionally long and stable microtubules, ultimately causing a failure in cytokinesis.\n\nB. The cells will exhibit an accelerated progression through prometaphase and metaphase, leading to a higher rate of aneuploidy due to premature sister chromatid separation.\n\nC. The cells will fail to form a stable, bipolar spindle of appropriate size; instead, they will likely exhibit very short spindles or a collapse of microtubule structures, resulting in a cell cycle arrest prior to anaphase.\n\nD. The cells will display hyper-stabilized kinetochore-microtubule attachments that cannot be resolved, preventing the proper segregation of chromosomes during anaphase due to an inability to depolymerize the microtubules at the kinetochore.\n\nE. The cells will frequently form multipolar spindles due to the abnormal duplication of centrosomes, leading to catastrophic chromosome mis-segregation.", "solution": "Kinesin-13 family proteins (e.g., MCAK/KIF2) are ATP-dependent microtubule depolymerases that act at microtubule ends to increase catastrophe frequency and drive depolymerization. During mitosis, spindle assembly and maintenance require a balance between tubulin polymerization and depolymerization, with proper microtubule length and stability needed for a robust, bipolar spindle and stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments. \n\nIf kinesin-13 is constitutively overexpressed, the balance shifts strongly toward depolymerization. The immediate mechanistic consequences are:\n- Increased catastrophe and reduced microtubule length throughout the spindle.\n- Destabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, leading to persistent unattached or improperly attached kinetochores.\n- Failure to achieve or maintain a spindle of appropriate length and rigidity, with a tendency toward very short spindles or spindle collapse.\n- Activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint due to unattached or tensionless kinetochores, causing arrest before anaphase rather than accelerated progression.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because overexpression of a depolymerase would not produce hyper-elongated, stable microtubules; the effect would be the opposite.\n- B is incorrect because destabilized attachments activate the spindle checkpoint, delaying rather than accelerating progression; premature sister chromatid separation is not the expected outcome of excessive depolymerization.\n- C is correct: excess depolymerization yields short or collapsed spindles and pre-anaphase arrest.\n- D is incorrect because overexpression would not hyper-stabilize attachments; it would destabilize them, impairing proper segregation but primarily by preventing stable biorientation rather than by inability to depolymerize.\n- E is not the primary predicted outcome; multipolar spindles arise from centrosome amplification or pole fragmentation, which is not the direct, primary effect of kinesin-13 overexpression.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is failure to form a stable, appropriately sized bipolar spindle with resultant arrest prior to anaphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2343010"}, {"introduction": "Once the spindle is built, how does the cell ensure that every chromosome is correctly attached before segregation begins? This critical task falls to the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), a sophisticated surveillance system. This practice [@problem_id:2343017] challenges you to think like a cell biologist and uncover the molecular logic of the SAC, specifically how it uses the physical cue of mechanical tension to distinguish correct bipolar attachments from dangerous errors.", "problem": "During mitosis in a eukaryotic cell, the accurate segregation of chromosomes is monitored by a surveillance mechanism known as the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This checkpoint ensures that anaphase does not commence until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle in a bipolar, or \"amphitelic,\" fashion. Consider a specific error where a single chromosome achieves a \"syntelic attachment,\" meaning both of its sister kinetochores become attached to microtubules originating from the same spindle pole. This incorrect configuration fails to satisfy the SAC, meaning the checkpoint remains active and delays the onset of anaphase.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular reason for why a syntelic attachment maintains an active checkpoint signal?\n\nA. The lack of tension across the sister kinetochores prevents the kinetochore-associated checkpoint proteins from being silenced, leading to continued inhibition of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C).\n\nB. Since both kinetochores are attached to microtubules, the checkpoint machinery is partially satisfied, allowing for a weak, but ultimately insufficient, activation of the APC/C.\n\nC. The syntelic attachment is inherently unstable and the kinetochores frequently detach from microtubules, which is interpreted by the SAC as a completely unattached chromosome.\n\nD. A syntelic attachment prevents the phosphorylation of the protein Securin, which is the direct signal required to satisfy the SAC and initiate anaphase.\n\nE. The physical proximity of the two sister kinetochores in a syntelic attachment causes a steric hindrance that blocks the recruitment of motor proteins necessary for silencing the checkpoint.", "solution": "The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) inhibits APC/C activation via the mitotic checkpoint complex when kinetochores are not in the proper state. Proper silencing of the SAC requires two key molecular criteria at each kinetochore: end-on microtubule attachment that displaces Mps1 and Mad1–Mad2 from the Ndc80 complex, and tension across sister kinetochores that spatially separates kinetochore substrates from Aurora B kinase and promotes recruitment of phosphatase PP1 to KNL1, thereby dephosphorylating MELT motifs and releasing Bub proteins to stop further checkpoint signaling.\n\nIn a syntelic attachment, both sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from the same pole. This configuration lacks inter-kinetochore tension because sister kinetochores are pulled in the same direction rather than opposing directions. Without tension, Aurora B continues to phosphorylate outer kinetochore substrates (including Ndc80 and KNL1), which inhibits the stable recruitment of PP1 and prevents the full removal of checkpoint proteins (Mad1–Mad2, Bub1–Bub3–BubR1) from the kinetochore. As a result, the kinetochore continues to generate the mitotic checkpoint complex, maintaining inhibition of APC/C and delaying anaphase onset.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate molecular reason is that the lack of tension across sister kinetochores in a syntelic attachment prevents SAC silencing and sustains APC/C inhibition.\n\nOption A states precisely this mechanism. Option B is incorrect because mere attachment without proper tension does not weakly activate APC/C; instead, the SAC remains active. Option C is not the most accurate, as the checkpoint is primarily maintained due to unsilenced kinetochore signaling rather than frequent detachment alone. Option D is incorrect because securin phosphorylation is not the SAC satisfaction signal; securin degradation is downstream of APC/C activation. Option E is not supported; steric hindrance of motor proteins is not the canonical mechanism for SAC maintenance in syntelic attachments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343017"}, {"introduction": "With all chromosomes properly attached and the checkpoint satisfied, the cell initiates anaphase. This final practice [@problem_id:2343026] moves our understanding from qualitative concepts to a quantitative model of chromosome movement. Your task is to dissect the complex motion of a chromosome during anaphase A into two key physical processes—poleward microtubule flux and plus-end depolymerization—and combine them into a simple equation for the chromosome's velocity, $v_\\text{chr}$.", "problem": "During anaphase A of mitosis, sister chromatids are pulled towards opposite spindle poles. This movement is primarily driven by the shortening of the kinetochore-microtubules (K-fibers) that connect the chromosome's kinetochore to a spindle pole.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model for the movement of a single chromosome towards its associated spindle pole. In this model, two distinct, independent processes contribute to the chromosome's motion:\n\n1.  **Poleward Flux**: The entire microtubule lattice of a K-fiber moves as a single unit towards the stationary spindle pole at a constant speed, denoted as $v_\\text{flux}$. This is analogous to a conveyor belt pulling the microtubule into the pole.\n2.  **Plus-End Depolymerization**: Simultaneously, the K-fiber shortens at its plus-end, which is the end attached to the chromosome's kinetochore. This shortening due to the removal of tubulin subunits occurs at a constant rate, denoted as $v_d$. This is analogous to the kinetochore \"eating\" the microtubule track it is attached to.\n\nAssuming the spindle pole is stationary and the chromosome remains firmly attached to the plus-end of the K-fiber, derive an expression for the total speed of the chromosome, $v_\\text{chr}$, as it moves towards the pole. Express your answer in terms of $v_\\text{flux}$ and $v_d$.", "solution": "Define a one-dimensional axis along the K-fiber with the positive direction pointing toward the spindle pole. Let the pole be stationary in this laboratory frame. Let $x_{\\text{chr}}(t)$ denote the chromosome position and $L(t)$ the pole-to-chromosome distance.\n\nTwo independent motions contribute to the chromosome’s poleward movement:\n\n1. Poleward flux: The microtubule lattice translates toward the pole at constant speed $v_\\text{flux}$. This carries the chromosome poleward at speed $v_\\text{flux}$ in the laboratory frame.\n\n2. Plus-end depolymerization: The plus-end at the kinetochore shortens at constant rate $v_d$, retracting the plus-end toward the pole relative to the lattice. Because the chromosome is attached to this plus-end, its velocity relative to the lattice is $v_d$ toward the pole.\n\nBy relative velocity addition, the chromosome’s velocity in the laboratory frame is the sum of its velocity due to lattice translation and its velocity relative to the lattice:\n$$\nv_\\text{chr} = v_\\text{flux} + v_d\n$$\n\nEquivalently, in terms of the pole-to-chromosome distance $L(t)$, poleward flux reduces $L$ at rate $v_\\text{flux}$ and plus-end depolymerization reduces $L$ at rate $v_d$, so\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt}=-(v_\\text{flux}+v_d) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_\\text{chr}=-\\frac{dL}{dt}=v_\\text{flux}+v_d\n$$\n\nThus, the total speed toward the pole is the sum of the two independent contributions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{v_\\text{flux} + v_d}$$", "id": "2343026"}]}
