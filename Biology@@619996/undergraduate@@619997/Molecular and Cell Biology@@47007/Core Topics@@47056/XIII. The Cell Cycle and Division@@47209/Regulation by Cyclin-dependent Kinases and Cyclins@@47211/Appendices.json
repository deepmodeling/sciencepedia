This first practice challenges you to connect the molecular function of the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex at the `$G_1/S$` transition to a widely used experimental readout, Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). By predicting the DNA content histogram of a cell population treated with a specific inhibitor, you will see how we can use experimental data to diagnose the state of the cell cycle engine [@problem_id:2335392].", "problem": "A rapidly dividing, asynchronous population of human cells is cultured in a laboratory. These cells are treated with a newly developed experimental drug that acts as a highly specific inhibitor of the Cyclin E-Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (Cdk2) protein complex. The role of the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex is to phosphorylate target proteins that are essential for initiating the `$S$` phase of the cell cycle.\n\nThe amount of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) in the cells is measured using a technique called Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). In this technique, cells are stained with a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA, and the fluorescence intensity of individual cells is measured. A histogram is then generated, plotting the measured DNA content (x-axis) versus the number of cells (y-axis). Cells in the `$G_1$` phase have a baseline DNA content defined as `$2n$`. After DNA replication, cells in the `$G_2$` and `M` phases have a DNA content of `$4n$`. Cells actively replicating their DNA in the `$S$` phase have a DNA content between `$2n$` and `$4n$`.\n\nAssuming the drug is added and the culture is incubated for a time period equivalent to 1.5 times the average cell cycle duration, which of the following statements best describes the expected DNA content histogram of the drug-treated population compared to an untreated control?\n\nA. A single large peak at the `$4n$` DNA content position, with a significant reduction in the number of cells at the `$2n$` position.\n\nB.

A broad accumulation of cells throughout the region between the `$2n$` and `$4n$` positions, with a reduction in the peaks at `$2n$` and `$4n$`.\n\nE. The disappearance of the `$S$` phase population, resulting in two distinct and equally tall peaks at the `$2n$` and `$4n$` positions.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the cell cycle control point targeted by the drug. The Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex drives the `$G_1/S$` transition by phosphorylating substrates required to initiate DNA replication. Therefore, a specific inhibitor of Cyclin E-Cdk2 prevents cells from initiating `$S$` phase, causing arrest at `$G_1$` with DNA content `$2n$`.\n\nIn a FACS DNA-content histogram, cells in `$G_1$` have `$2n$` DNA, cells in `$S$` phase have DNA content continuously distributed between `$2n$` and `$4n$`, and cells in `$G_2/M$` have `$4n$`. An asynchronous, rapidly dividing control population typically shows prominent peaks at `$2n$` and `$4n$` with a continuum in between.\n\nUpon drug addition, the immediate effect is that cells currently in `$G_1$` are blocked from entering `$S$` phase and thus remain at `$2n$`. Cells that are already in `$S$` or `$G_2/M$` at the time of drug addition do not require Cyclin E-Cdk2 to complete their ongoing `$S$` phase or to proceed through `$G_2/M$`; they finish the current cycle, divide, and return to `$G_1$` (now at `$2n$`), where they will be unable to reenter `$S$` phase due to Cyclin E-Cdk2 inhibition.\n\nGiven incubation for a duration equal to `$1.5$` times the average cell cycle, essentially all cells that were initially in `$S$` or `$G_2/M$` will have completed that cycle and attempted to start the next `$S$` phase; they will then accumulate in `$G_1$` at `$2n$`. Consequently, the histogram will show:\n- A large accumulation at `$2n$` (increased `$G_1$` peak).\n- A marked reduction in the `$S$`-phase region between `$2n$` and `$4n$` (few or no cells can initiate DNA replication).\n- A reduction in the `$4n$` peak (fewer cells reach or remain in `$G_2/M$` after completing the current cycle).\n\nThis pattern corresponds to an increased single dominant `$2n$` peak with decreased `$S$` and `$4n$` populations, which best matches option B. Options A and D would require arrest in `$S$` or `$G_2/M$`, which is not expected from blocking Cyclin E-Cdk2–dependent `$S$`-phase initiation. Option C predicts no change, which contradicts the `$G_1$` arrest. Option E posits equal peaks at `$2n$` and `$4n$` with disappearance of `$S$`, which is inconsistent with the expected unidirectional accumulation at `$2n$` after cells complete the current cycle and fail to reenter `$S$`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2335392"}, {"introduction": "Before a cell commits to the dramatic events of mitosis, it must ensure it is ready. This next exercise explores the `$G_2/M$` checkpoint, a critical control point where the cell assesses its size and preparedness for division. You will analyze a classic genetic scenario in yeast where the inhibitory kinase, Wee1, is non-functional, providing a powerful lesson in how removing a molecular 'brake' can have profound consequences on cell phenotype [@problem_id:2335425].", "problem": "A researcher is studying cell size control in the fission yeast *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*. The transition from the `$G_2$` phase to the `$M$` (mitotic) phase is a critical control point, ensuring cells have reached an adequate size before dividing. This transition is primarily triggered by the activation of a protein complex known as M-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (M-CDK). The activity of the M-CDK complex is tightly regulated. After the M-cyclin binds to its CDK partner, the complex is phosphorylated at an activating site by one kinase and at an inhibitory site by another kinase, named Wee1. This dual phosphorylation holds the M-CDK complex in an inactive state. For the cell to enter mitosis, a phosphatase must remove the inhibitory phosphate, leading to the rapid activation of M-CDK.\n\nThe researcher isolates a mutant yeast strain that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Wee1 kinase. Assuming all other cell cycle regulatory proteins are functional, which of the following phenotypes is most likely to be observed in this mutant strain compared to the wild-type (normal) strain?\n\nA. Cells will arrest in the `$G_2$` phase, resulting in highly elongated cells that are significantly larger than normal.\n\nB. Cells will enter mitosis prematurely, resulting in daughter cells that are significantly smaller than normal.\n\nC. Cells will be unable to properly segregate their chromosomes, arresting in the middle of `$M$`-phase with a single large nucleus.\n\nD. Cells will be unable to initiate DNA replication, arresting in the `$G_1$` phase and failing to grow.\n\nE. Cells will exit the active cell cycle and enter a quiescent (`$G_0$`) state, ceasing all division.", "solution": "We identify the key regulatory logic for the `$G_2$` to `$M$` transition in fission yeast. The M-CDK complex requires two conditions to be active: binding of M-cyclin and the absence of an inhibitory phosphate on the CDK. The relevant regulatory enzymes are:\n- A CAK (CDK-activating kinase) that phosphorylates the activating site on CDK, promoting activity.\n- Wee1 kinase that phosphorylates an inhibitory site on CDK, preventing activity.\n- Cdc25 phosphatase that removes the inhibitory phosphate, enabling rapid activation.\n\nIn wild-type cells, the balance between Wee1 and Cdc25 creates a size-dependent checkpoint in `$G_2$`: as cells grow, signaling shifts toward Cdc25 activation and Wee1 inhibition, generating a switch-like activation of M-CDK and entry into mitosis when adequate size is reached. Active M-CDK further strengthens this switch by positive feedback: it activates Cdc25 and inhibits Wee1, sharpening the transition.\n\nConsider a complete loss-of-function mutation in Wee1:\n1. Without Wee1, the inhibitory phosphorylation on M-CDK is not added.\n2. Therefore, once M-cyclin accumulates and the activating phosphorylation is present, there is little to prevent M-CDK activation.\n3. The threshold for M-CDK activation is lowered because the inhibitory arm is missing; consequently, the positive feedback via Cdc25 faces no counterbalance from Wee1.\n4. This causes earlier-than-normal entry into mitosis, shortening the duration of `$G_2$` growth.\n5. Shorter `$G_2$` growth directly leads to smaller cell size at division, producing daughter cells that are significantly smaller than normal.\n\nThis is the classic “wee” phenotype in Schizosaccharomyces pombe associated with loss of Wee1 function. The alternative options do not match this regulatory logic:\n- `$G_2$` arrest with elongation occurs when Cdc25 is defective or Wee1 is hyperactive, not when Wee1 is absent.\n- Defects in chromosome segregation (`$M$`-phase arrest) are not a direct consequence of removing Wee1.\n- `$G_1$` arrest or entry into quiescence does not follow from the specific loss of Wee1, which acts at the `$G_2/M$` checkpoint.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is premature mitotic entry with smaller cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2335425"}, {"introduction": "Entering mitosis is only half the story; a cell must also have a robust mechanism to exit mitosis and return to interphase. This final practice focuses on the crucial step of inactivating the mitotic machinery through targeted protein degradation. By considering a cell with a mutant, non-degradable Cyclin B, you'll uncover why the destruction of key regulators is as important as their creation for orderly cell cycle progression [@problem_id:2335393].", "problem": "The progression of a eukaryotic cell through the cell cycle is tightly regulated by a family of protein kinases known as Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs), whose activity depends on their association with regulatory proteins called cyclins. The `$M$`-phase Promoting Factor (MPF) is a crucial complex formed by Cyclin B and CDK1 that drives a cell into mitosis (`$M$`-phase). For the cell to exit mitosis and enter the next interphase, the MPF complex must be inactivated. This inactivation is primarily achieved through the targeted degradation of Cyclin B. The degradation process is initiated when a protein complex called the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) recognizes a specific amino acid sequence on Cyclin B, known as the \"destruction box,\" and attaches ubiquitin molecules to it, marking it for destruction by the proteasome.\n\nImagine a line of cultured mammalian cells is genetically engineered such that the endogenous gene for Cyclin B is replaced by a mutant version. This mutant Cyclin B protein is fully functional in binding to and activating CDK1, but it completely lacks the destruction box sequence. Assuming these cells enter the cell cycle, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and immediate consequence of expressing only this mutant form of Cyclin B?\n\nA. The cells will be unable to replicate their DNA and will arrest in `$S$`-phase.\n\nB. The cells will fail to assemble the mitotic spindle and will be unable to enter `$M$`-phase.\n\nC. The cells will enter `$M$`-phase but will be unable to exit it, arresting in a mitotic state.\n\nD. The cells will cycle more rapidly than normal due to the continuous presence of Cyclin B.\n\nE. The cells will exit the cell cycle and enter a quiescent (`$G_0$`) state.", "solution": "Step 1: Define the normal regulatory mechanism of MPF. In eukaryotic cells, entry into mitosis is driven by the `$M$`-phase Promoting Factor (MPF), a complex of CDK1 and Cyclin B. MPF activity is high in `$M$`-phase and promotes mitotic events through phosphorylation of numerous substrates. Exit from mitosis requires inactivation of MPF, which is achieved primarily by degradation of Cyclin B.\n\nStep 2: Describe how Cyclin B degradation is normally triggered. The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, recognizes a specific motif on Cyclin B known as the destruction box. Upon recognition, APC/C polyubiquitinates Cyclin B, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This degradation lowers Cyclin B levels, thereby reducing CDK1 kinase activity and permitting mitotic exit (chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reformation, spindle disassembly, and cytokinesis).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the mutant scenario. The engineered Cyclin B lacks the destruction box but retains the ability to bind and activate CDK1. Therefore:\n- It can still form an active MPF complex and promote entry into `$M$`-phase.\n- However, APC/C cannot recognize and ubiquitinate this mutant Cyclin B, so it is not degraded by the proteasome.\n\nStep 4: Infer the immediate functional consequence. Because Cyclin B is not degraded, CDK1 kinase activity remains high. Mitotic exit depends on CDK1 inactivation that follows Cyclin B degradation. Sustained CDK1 activity blocks the processes required for mitotic exit, including reversal of CDK1-driven phosphorylations and completion of cytokinesis.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the options based on these principles.\n- A is incorrect: DNA replication (`$S$`-phase) occurs before Cyclin B/CDK1 activity is relevant; the mutant does not prevent `$S$`-phase entry or completion.\n- B is incorrect: The mutant Cyclin B is functional and promotes entry into `$M$`-phase; spindle assembly can occur under high MPF activity.\n- C is correct: Cells enter `$M$`-phase but cannot inactivate MPF due to nondegradable Cyclin B, so they fail to exit mitosis and arrest in a mitotic state.\n- D is incorrect: Continuous Cyclin B presence does not accelerate cycling; instead, it prevents mitotic exit, effectively halting the cycle.\n- E is incorrect: Persistent MPF activity is incompatible with quiescence; cells do not enter `$G_0$` under high CDK1 activity.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and immediate consequence is failure to exit mitosis, with arrest in `$M$`-phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335393"}]}
