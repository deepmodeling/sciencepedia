We will examine the role of the Retinoblastoma protein ($Rb$), a key tumor suppressor that prevents uncontrolled cell division. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving a loss-of-function mutation in $Rb$ [@problem_id:2307286], you can deduce how the absence of this single protein allows a cell to bypass external growth signals and improperly enter the S phase.", "problem": "In vertebrate cells, progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is controlled by a critical checkpoint known as the restriction point. This checkpoint ensures that cells only replicate their DNA when appropriate external growth signals are present. A key regulator of this checkpoint is the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a tumor suppressor. In its active, hypophosphorylated state, Rb binds to and sequesters the E2F family of transcription factors, preventing them from activating the genes required for S phase entry. When a cell is stimulated by growth factors, specific Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate Rb. This phosphorylation inactivates Rb, causing it to release E2F, which then drives the cell into S phase.\n\nConsider a human fibroblast cell line that has a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in its *RB1* gene, meaning it produces no functional Rb protein. These mutant cells are cultured in a medium completely lacking any growth factors.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the immediate cell cycle progression of these mutant fibroblasts under these conditions?\n\nA. The cells will arrest in the G1 phase because the absence of growth factors prevents the activation of S-phase-promoting CDKs.\n\nB. The cells will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) immediately upon failing to detect growth factors.\n\nC. The cells will proceed through the G1 phase and enter the S phase.\n\nD. The cells will arrest at the G2/M checkpoint due to genomic instability caused by the mutation.\n\nE. The cells will permanently exit the cell cycle and enter a state of senescence (G0 phase).", "solution": "The restriction point in G1 is governed by the Rb–E2F axis. In normal cells without growth factors, cyclin D–CDK4/6 is not activated, so Rb remains hypophosphorylated and active, binds E2F, and prevents transcription of S-phase genes, resulting in G1 arrest. When growth factors are present, cyclin D–CDK4/6 phosphorylates Rb, inactivating it and releasing E2F, which induces genes such as cyclin E and cyclin A to drive G1/S progression.\n\nIn the mutant fibroblasts described, there is a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in RB1, so no functional Rb protein is present. Therefore, E2F is not sequestered by Rb and is free to activate transcription of S-phase genes irrespective of upstream mitogenic signaling. This constitutive E2F activity can induce cyclin E and cyclin A expression and activate CDK2, thereby bypassing the need for growth factor–dependent Rb phosphorylation at the restriction point. Consequently, these cells do not arrest in G1 in response to growth factor deprivation but instead proceed through G1 and enter S phase. Immediate apoptosis, G2/M arrest, or permanent senescence are not the direct immediate outcomes dictated by the loss of Rb at the G1 restriction point under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307286"}, {"introduction": "We now move to a crucial \"point of no return\" in mitosis: the transition from metaphase to anaphase. This process is tightly controlled to ensure sister chromatids separate only at the correct time, a task orchestrated by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). In this problem [@problem_id:2307287], you will predict the fate of a cell with a specially engineered protein, securin, which cannot be degraded, thereby testing your understanding of the precise molecular cascade that triggers anaphase.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cell division, the transition from metaphase to anaphase is a critical, irreversible step controlled by the spindle assembly checkpoint. This transition is initiated by a large protein complex called the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. A key target of the APC/C is a protein called securin. Securin acts as an inhibitor of an enzyme named separase. The function of separase is to cleave the cohesin proteins that hold sister chromatids together.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered eukaryotic cell line in which the endogenous gene for securin has been replaced with a mutant version. This mutant securin protein is fully functional in its ability to bind to and inhibit separase, but its ubiquitination site, which is normally recognized by the APC/C, has been altered. As a result, the APC/C can no longer target this mutant securin for destruction. Assuming all other cellular processes are normal, what is the most direct and immediate fate of a cell from this engineered line as it attempts to proceed through mitosis?\n\nA. The cell will enter anaphase prematurely because separase is overactive.\n\nB. The cell will arrest in metaphase, unable to separate its sister chromatids.\n\nC. The cell will fail to form a proper metaphase plate and arrest in prophase.\n\nD. The cell will complete nuclear division but fail to undergo cytokinesis, resulting in a polyploid cell.\n\nE. The cell will proceed through anaphase but will have massive chromosome mis-segregation.", "solution": "Normal APC/C-driven anaphase entry proceeds as follows:\n- The spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied when all kinetochores achieve proper bipolar attachment and tension, allowing activation of APC/C bound to its co-activator Cdc20.\n- Active APC/C ubiquitinates securin, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This relieves inhibition on separase.\n- Freed separase cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin (for example, Scc1/Rad21), dissolving sister chromatid cohesion, thereby triggering the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.\n\nIn the engineered cell line, the mutant securin retains full ability to bind and inhibit separase, but lacks the APC/C-recognized ubiquitination site. Therefore:\n- Even when APC/C is fully activated by a satisfied spindle checkpoint, it cannot ubiquitinate the mutant securin.\n- Without ubiquitination, securin is not degraded by the proteasome and continues to inhibit separase.\n- With separase inhibited, cohesin cannot be cleaved, so sister chromatids remain paired.\n- Without cohesin cleavage, the cell cannot initiate anaphase, and the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is blocked.\n\nThe most direct and immediate consequence during attempted mitotic progression is a failure to separate sister chromatids, resulting in a metaphase arrest. This excludes premature anaphase (separase is not overactive), prophase arrest (spindle formation and alignment are unaffected by securin stability), completion of nuclear division without cytokinesis (requires anaphase onset, which is blocked), and proceeding through anaphase with mis-segregation (anaphase cannot begin without cohesin cleavage).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2307287"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the G1 and M-phase checkpoints, we now investigate the tangible consequences of a checkpoint failure. The spindle assembly checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism that ensures genomic stability by preventing chromosome mis-segregation. This practice [@problem_id:2307314] presents a scenario where this checkpoint fails, providing a quantitative challenge to determine the resulting chromosome numbers in the daughter cells and illustrating how a single error can lead to aneuploidy.", "problem": "A researcher is studying cell division in a somatic cell line derived from a female fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. The diploid chromosome number (2n) for this species is 8. During one of the observed mitotic divisions, a specific error occurs. Instead of the two sister chromatids of a particular chromosome attaching to opposite spindle poles during metaphase, both of their kinetochores happen to attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. The spindle assembly checkpoint, which normally detects such errors and halts the cell cycle, fails to function. Consequently, the cell proceeds through anaphase and cytokinesis.\n\nAssuming no other errors occur, what will be the chromosome number in each of the two resulting daughter cells?\n\nA. 9 and 7\n\nB. 8 and 8\n\nC. 4 and 4\n\nD. 8 and 7\n\nE. 16 and 14", "solution": "**Step 1: Understand the initial state of the cell.**\nThe problem states that we start with a diploid (2n) somatic cell from *Drosophila melanogaster*, for which 2n = 8. Before mitosis begins, the cell undergoes the S phase of the cell cycle, where its DNA is replicated. After replication, the cell still contains 8 chromosomes, but each chromosome is now composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at the centromere.\n\n**Step 2: Describe a normal mitotic division.**\nIn a normal mitosis, the 8 replicated chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures that each pair of sister chromatids is attached to microtubules from opposite poles. Once this is confirmed, the cell enters anaphase. During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate. The 8 chromatids from each chromosome pair are pulled to opposite poles. Thus, 8 chromatids (which are now considered individual chromosomes) move to one pole, and 8 chromosomes move to the opposite pole. The cell then divides via cytokinesis, producing two genetically identical daughter cells, each with a diploid number of 8 chromosomes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specified error and checkpoint failure.**\nIn this scenario, the spindle assembly checkpoint fails. This allows the cell to enter anaphase despite an attachment error affecting one of the 8 chromosomes. For this one specific chromosome, both sister chromatids are attached to the same spindle pole. The other 7 chromosomes are attached correctly.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the segregation of chromosomes during anaphase.**\nWhen anaphase begins, the following events occur:\n- For the 7 correctly attached chromosomes, the sister chromatids separate as normal. This means 7 chromatids move toward one spindle pole (let's call it Pole A) and 7 chromatids move toward the other spindle pole (Pole B).\n- For the 1 incorrectly attached chromosome, both of its sister chromatids are pulled together to the same pole they are attached to (Pole A). The other pole (Pole B) receives no part of this chromosome.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the chromosome count for each forming nucleus.**\nLet's tally the number of chromatids that arrive at each pole at the end of anaphase. In cytology, once sister chromatids separate during anaphase, each is considered a full-fledged chromosome.\n- **Pole A receives:** 7 chromosomes (from the normally separating pairs) + 2 chromosomes (the two sister chromatids from the non-disjoined pair). The total number of chromosomes moving to Pole A is $7 + 2 = 9$.\n- **Pole B receives:** 7 chromosomes (from the normally separating pairs) + 0 chromosomes (from the non-disjoined pair). The total number of chromosomes moving to Pole B is $7 + 0 = 7$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the chromosome number of the final daughter cells.**\nAfter anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis occur, dividing the cell into two. The chromosomes that collected at each pole form the nucleus of a new daughter cell.\n- The daughter cell formed from the contents of Pole A will have 9 chromosomes. This condition is known as trisomy (2n+1).\n- The daughter cell formed from the contents of Pole B will have 7 chromosomes. This condition is known as monosomy (2n-1).\n\nTherefore, the two resulting daughter cells will have chromosome numbers of 9 and 7.
