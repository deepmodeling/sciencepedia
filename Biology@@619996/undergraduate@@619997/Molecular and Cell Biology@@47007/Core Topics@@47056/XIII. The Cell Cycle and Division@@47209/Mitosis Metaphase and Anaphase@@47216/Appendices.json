The definition of a \"chromosome\" effectively changes at the anaphase transition, a point of frequent confusion. This practice [@problem_id:2324368] will solidify your understanding of this critical moment, where sister chromatids separate, helping you visualize why the chromosome number temporarily doubles within the single cell before it divides.", "problem": "A cytogeneticist is studying cell division in a newly identified species of mammal. It is determined that the somatic cells of this organism are diploid and have a chromosome number of $2n=24$. A single somatic cell from this organism is isolated and observed as it undergoes mitosis. At a specific point in time, the cell is identified as being in the anaphase stage, where the cohesive proteins holding sister chromatids together have been cleaved and the resulting structures are moving towards opposite cell poles. What is the total number of chromosomes present within this single cell at this moment in anaphase?", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell during the anaphase stage of mitosis, given that the diploid chromosome number is $2n=24$.\n\nStep 1: Understand the initial state.\nA diploid somatic cell has a chromosome number of $2n$. In this organism, $2n = 24$. This means that in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a typical somatic cell contains 24 chromosomes.\n\nStep 2: Consider the effect of DNA replication.\nBefore a cell enters mitosis, it undergoes the S phase (synthesis phase) of interphase. During S phase, the cell's DNA is replicated. Each of the 24 chromosomes is duplicated, resulting in a chromosome structure composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at a common centromere. Although the amount of DNA has doubled, the chromosome number is still considered to be 24, as the chromosome count is determined by the number of centromeres.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the state of chromosomes in prophase and metaphase.\nDuring prophase and metaphase of mitosis, the 24 replicated chromosomes condense and become visible. In metaphase, these 24 chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids, align at the metaphase plate.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the defining event of anaphase.\nAnaphase begins when the sister chromatids of each chromosome are separated and pulled towards opposite poles of the cell. The crucial point in defining the chromosome number is that as soon as the sister chromatids separate, each chromatid is now considered a complete, independent chromosome. Each newly separated chromosome consists of a single chromatid and its own centromere.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of chromosomes in anaphase.\nSince each of the 24 replicated chromosomes that aligned at the metaphase plate splits into two separate daughter chromosomes, the total number of chromosomes within the cell is temporarily doubled.\nThe number of chromosomes in anaphase is therefore $2 \\times (\\text{diploid number of chromosomes})$.\nNumber of chromosomes = $2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\nThese 48 chromosomes are distributed into two groups of 24 that are migrating to opposite poles. However, until cytokinesis (the division of the cytoplasm) is complete, they are all contained within a single parent cell. Therefore, the entire cell contains 48 chromosomes during anaphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{48}$$", "id": "2324368"}, {"introduction": "With the basics of chromosome counting established, we now delve into the \"how\"—the molecular machinery controlling the sharp transition from metaphase to anaphase. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2324349] invites you to predict the consequences of a specific mutation in the regulatory protein securin. By working through this scenario, you'll gain insight into the elegant logic of the cell cycle's control system, particularly the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC/C) pathway, which ensures sister chromatids separate at precisely the right time.", "problem": "In a healthy eukaryotic cell, the transition from metaphase to anaphase is a tightly regulated event. This transition is initiated by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Once all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate, the APC/C is activated and targets the protein securin for degradation. Securin normally acts as an inhibitor by binding to and inactivating a protease called separase. The degradation of securin liberates separase, which then cleaves the cohesin complexes holding sister chromatids together, allowing them to separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line that has been engineered with a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the securin protein. This mutation completely abolishes the ability of the securin protein to bind to separase. Assume that all other cellular components, including separase, cohesin, and the APC/C, are wild-type and fully functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence of this securin mutation on the cell's progression through mitosis?\n\nA. The cell would arrest permanently in metaphase because the spindle assembly checkpoint would remain active indefinitely.\n\nB. The separation of sister chromatids would occur prematurely, as separase would be active independent of APC/C-mediated securin degradation.\n\nC. Sister chromatids would fail to separate, and the cell would become trapped in an anaphase-like state with chromosomes stuck at the metaphase plate.\n\nD. The APC/C would fail to target M-phase cyclins for degradation, causing the cell to be unable to exit mitosis.\n\nE. The cohesin complexes would become hyper-stabilized, requiring a much higher concentration of separase to initiate anaphase.", "solution": "Logical framework:\n1) In wild-type cells, securin binds to separase and inhibits its protease activity. The metaphase-to-anaphase transition is triggered when APC/C ubiquitinates securin, promoting its proteasomal degradation. This liberates separase, which then cleaves cohesin to separate sister chromatids.\n\n2) In the engineered mutant, securin cannot bind separase. Therefore, the inhibitory complex between securin and separase cannot form at any time in the cell cycle. As a direct consequence, separase is not restrained by securin and its activation no longer depends on APC/C-mediated securin degradation.\n\n3) With separase free of securin, the most immediate and direct outcome is premature separase activity relative to the proper timing set by the spindle assembly checkpoint and APC/C activation. This would lead to premature cleavage of cohesin and premature sister chromatid separation.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: a permanent metaphase arrest due to an active checkpoint is not the direct consequence of removing securin inhibition; rather, separase activation would occur prematurely even without APC/C action on securin. While such premature separation may create chromosome attachment/tension defects that could perturb the checkpoint, the direct and primary effect is not a metaphase arrest.\n- B is correct: separase becomes active independent of APC/C-mediated securin degradation, leading to premature sister chromatid separation.\n- C is incorrect: failure to separate would occur if separase remained inhibited; here, inhibition is lost.\n- D is incorrect: APC/C targeting of M cyclins is not dependent on securin binding; the mutation does not prevent APC/C from degrading cyclin substrates.\n- E is incorrect: cohesin would be cleaved more readily, not hyper-stabilized.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the direct consequence is premature sister chromatid separation due to separase activity independent of securin degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2324349"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores the crucial link between a chromosome's physical structure and its destiny during cell division. We examine a scenario where a chromosome breaks, yielding a fragment that lacks a centromere. This exercise [@problem_id:2324379] will challenge you to apply your knowledge of the mitotic spindle and kinetochore function to predict the fate of this \"acentric\" fragment, revealing a key mechanism behind genomic instability and the formation of cellular abnormalities like micronuclei.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a population of synchronized eukaryotic cells is treated with a specific clastogenic agent during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This agent induces a single double-strand break in one arm of a single chromosome. The cellular repair mechanisms fail to ligate the break before the cell enters mitosis. As a result, the cell enters prophase with one chromosome that has been fractured into two pieces: a large fragment containing the centromere, and a smaller 'acentric fragment' which lacks a centromere. Assuming the cell's spindle assembly checkpoint is not activated by this event and the cell proceeds through mitosis, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected fate of the acentric fragment during metaphase and anaphase?\n\nA. The acentric fragment will align independently at the metaphase plate and subsequently be segregated in a 1:1 ratio to the two daughter cells during anaphase.\n\nB. The acentric fragment will fail to attach to the mitotic spindle. It will drift randomly within the cytoplasm and, following anaphase, will most likely be excluded from both newly formed daughter nuclei, often resulting in the formation of a micronucleus.\n\nC. The acentric fragment will be recognized as unattached by the mitotic checkpoint complex, which will permanently arrest the cell in metaphase, preventing the onset of anaphase and leading to apoptosis.\n\nD. The acentric fragment will be actively transported towards one of the two spindle poles before metaphase is complete, guaranteeing its inclusion in only one of the two daughter cells.\n\nE. The acentric fragment will re-associate with the centromere-containing fragment through non-covalent interactions, allowing it to be properly segregated along with its parent chromosome.", "solution": "We analyze the fate of an acentric fragment during mitosis by applying core principles of chromosome segregation. First, correct attachment to the mitotic spindle requires a kinetochore, which assembles on centromeric chromatin. Therefore, only chromosome fragments containing a centromere can form a kinetochore and attach to spindle microtubules in a end-on manner. An acentric fragment, by definition, lacks a centromere and thus cannot form a kinetochore. Consequently, it cannot establish proper spindle attachments and cannot congress to the metaphase plate.\n\nSecond, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors attachment status and tension at kinetochores. Unattached kinetochores generate the mitotic checkpoint complex to delay anaphase onset. However, because an acentric fragment has no kinetochore, it does not produce an unattached-kinetochore signal. Under the problem’s assumption that the checkpoint is not otherwise activated, the cell will proceed into anaphase despite the presence of the acentric fragment.\n\nThird, lacking kinetochore-mediated capture, the acentric fragment typically fails to be segregated in a controlled, 1:1 manner. It may drift passively in the cytoplasm, sometimes associating nonspecifically with microtubules or other cellular structures, but without a kinetochore it is not reliably transported to a pole. As the nuclear envelope reassembles around the segregated chromatid sets, the acentric fragment is often excluded from the main daughter nuclei. This exclusion commonly results in its encapsulation as a separate, small nucleus-like structure, termed a micronucleus.\n\nThese principles directly eliminate the alternatives: it cannot align and segregate 1:1 (rejecting A); it does not trigger a sustained SAC arrest because there is no unattached kinetochore (rejecting C); there is no mechanism guaranteeing active, directed poleward transport to ensure inclusion in one daughter (rejecting D); and it will not re-associate via non-covalent interactions in a way that restores proper segregation without covalent repair (rejecting E). The most accurate description is that it fails to attach, drifts, and is typically excluded to form a micronucleus, which matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2324379"}]}
