During late cytokinesis, microtubules occupy distinct structures in animal and plant cells.\n\nFor the human fibroblast (animal cell), cytokinesis involves:\n- A contractile ring composed primarily of actin and myosin that forms the cleavage furrow; this is not rich in tubulin and therefore is not the primary site of tubulin fluorescence.\n- A central spindle that transitions into the midbody, a dense bundle of overlapping microtubules located within the cleavage furrow at late cytokinesis. Because the midbody is microtubule-rich, tubulin fluorescence will be concentrated there.\n\nFor the tobacco plant cell (plant cell), cytokinesis proceeds via:\n- Formation of the phragmoplast, a microtubule- and actin-rich structure that assembles between the daughter nuclei and guides Golgi-derived vesicles to form the new cell plate. The phragmoplast contains concentrated microtubules; thus, tubulin fluorescence will be concentrated in the phragmoplast forming the cell plate.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that in the human cell, tubulin fluorescence is concentrated in the midbody within the cleavage furrow, and in the plant cell, it is concentrated in the phragmoplast forming the cell plate.

This thought experiment explores the fundamental logic behind constriction versus construction by simulating the effect of a drug that blocks new membrane formation. By analyzing the differential impact on animal and plant cells, you can deduce the core requirements of each process and gain a deeper insight into why a \"pinching\" strategy works for one and a \"building\" strategy is necessary for the other.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanisms of cytokinesis. The researcher uses a novel synthetic drug, **Lipidostop**, which has a highly specific effect: it completely and immediately halts all *de novo* synthesis of phospholipids and sterols, thereby preventing the formation of any new cellular membrane. All other cellular processes, including protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics (both actin- and microtubule-based), and ATP production, remain unaffected.\n\nThe researcher treats two synchronously dividing cell cultures with Lipidostop at the onset of telophase:\n1. A culture of human fibroblasts (an animal cell line).\n2. A culture of onion root tip cells (a plant cell line).\n\nThe researcher observes that in the plant cell culture, cytokinesis fails to initiate. In the animal cell culture, however, a distinct cleavage furrow forms and progresses, deepening considerably before the process eventually arrests, failing to completely separate the daughter cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observed difference?\n\nA. The rigid cell wall of the plant cell prevents the plasma membrane from invaginating, meaning any division requires outward growth of a new membrane, which is blocked by Lipidostop.\n\nB. Animal cell cytokinesis is initiated by the contraction of an actin-myosin ring that pinches the existing plasma membrane, a process that does not initially depend on new membrane synthesis. In contrast, plant cell cytokinesis is accomplished by the construction of a new cell plate from vesicle fusion, a process that is fundamentally dependent on the addition of new membrane material from the start.\n\nC. The microtubule-based phragmoplast, which is essential for plant cytokinesis, is more sensitive to the secondary metabolic effects of Lipidostop than the actin-based contractile ring used by animal cells.\n\nD. The plasma membrane of an animal cell is significantly more elastic than that of a plant cell, allowing it to stretch and form a deep furrow even without the addition of new membrane material.\n\nE. Animal cells maintain a large cytoplasmic pool of pre-synthesized membrane vesicles that can be used for the cleavage furrow, whereas plant cells must synthesize all vesicles for the cell plate on demand from the Golgi apparatus during telophase.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the fundamental reason why inhibiting new membrane synthesis immediately stops plant cytokinesis but allows animal cytokinesis to proceed partially. This requires comparing the core mechanisms of cytokinesis in these two cell types.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Animal Cell Cytokinesis**\nAnimal cells divide via a process called cleavage. At the beginning of cytokinesis, a contractile ring, composed primarily of actin and myosin filaments, assembles just underneath the plasma membrane at the cell's equator. This ring functions like a purse string. The motor protein myosin pulls on the actin filaments, causing the ring to contract. This contraction pulls the existing plasma membrane inwards, forming a groove known as the cleavage furrow. This process is primarily a mechanical constriction and reshaping of the pre-existing plasma membrane. While the final step of cell separation, called abscission, does require the insertion of new membrane to seal the two daughter cells, the initial and substantial deepening of the furrow can occur without it. Therefore, when Lipidostop is applied, the contractile ring can still form and function, causing the cell to begin pinching inward. The process only halts later when the membrane becomes too stretched to invaginate further without adding new surface area.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Plant Cell Cytokinesis**\nPlant cells are encased in a rigid cell wall, which prevents them from pinching in half. Instead, they build a new wall and membrane from the inside out. This process starts with the formation of a structure called the phragmoplast, an array of microtubules that forms at the cell's equator. The phragmoplast guides vesicles, produced by the Golgi apparatus, to the center of the cell. These vesicles are filled with cell wall precursors (like pectin and hemicellulose) and their own membrane is rich in phospholipids and sterols. At the equatorial plane, these vesicles fuse with each other. This fusion event simultaneously creates a nascent structure called the cell plate and delivers the precursors for the new cell wall within it. The cell plate is, by its very nature, a patch of *new* plasma membrane. It grows outwards from the center as more and more vesicles fuse onto its edges until it reaches and fuses with the parent cell's plasma membrane and wall. This entire process is constructive and additive. It is wholly dependent on the continuous supply and fusion of new membrane-bound vesicles. If new membrane synthesis is blocked by Lipidostop, the necessary vesicles cannot be properly formed or their fusion is compromised, and thus the cell plate cannot be initiated or built. The process fails at its very inception.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Mechanisms and Evaluate the Options**\nThe fundamental difference is that animal cytokinesis begins with a *contractile* process acting on an *existing* membrane, while plant cytokinesis is a *constructive* process that *builds* a new membrane and wall structure.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n*   **A:** This is partially true (the cell wall prevents invagination), but it's not the most precise explanation for the inhibitor's effect. The core reason lies in the *mechanism* used to overcome this rigidity, which is the construction of a cell plate. This option doesn't fully describe that mechanism.\n*   **B:** This option correctly and accurately contrasts the two mechanisms. It identifies animal cytokinesis as an initial contractile process that uses the existing membrane and plant cytokinesis as a constructive process (cell plate formation) that requires new membrane from the start. This perfectly explains the observed experimental results.\n*   **C:** This is incorrect. The problem statement explicitly says that Lipidostop does not affect cytoskeletal dynamics. This option introduces a secondary effect that is ruled out by the problem's premise.\n*   **D:** While there may be differences in membrane elasticity, this is not the primary reason for the observed phenomenon. The fundamental difference is in the overall strategy: constriction versus construction. The animal cell process does not rely on extreme stretching but on the active contraction of the actin-myosin ring.\n*   **E:** This option makes an assumption about vesicle storage that is not the core principle. While cells have vesicle pools, the key difference is not the timing of synthesis (on-demand vs. stored) but the fact that the entire plant cytokinesis process *is* vesicle fusion. Animal cells use the contractile ring, a different primary mechanism.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the differential effects of Lipidostop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2312074"}]}
