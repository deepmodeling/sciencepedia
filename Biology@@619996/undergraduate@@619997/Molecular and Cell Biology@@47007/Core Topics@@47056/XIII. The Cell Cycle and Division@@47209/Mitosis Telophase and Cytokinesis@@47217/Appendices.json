This exercise [@problem_id:2324836] challenges you to apply your knowledge of the contractile ring, specifically the function of the motor protein myosin-II. By predicting the outcome of its inhibition, you can clarify the distinct contributions of nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis) and understand how disrupting a single component can have dramatic consequences for the cell's final architecture.", "problem": "An experimental biologist is studying the cell cycle in a culture of animal fibroblast cells. A specific cell is observed to have successfully completed anaphase, with its duplicated chromosomes fully separated and localized at the opposite poles of the cell. At this precise moment, a potent and highly specific small-molecule inhibitor, \"Myoblockin,\" is introduced into the culture medium. Myoblockin is known to exclusively bind to and inactivate the motor protein myosin-II, preventing it from hydrolyzing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and generating force. Assuming all other cellular processes remain unaffected, which of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the final state of this specific cell after the mitotic and cytokinetic processes would normally have concluded?\n\nA. A single, enlarged cell containing two distinct nuclei.\n\nB. A single cell arrested in anaphase, with chromosomes condensed at the poles.\n\nC. A single cell containing one large nucleus with double the normal chromosome content.\n\nD. Two separate, genetically identical daughter cells of normal size.\n\nE. The cell will immediately fragment and undergo apoptosis due to checkpoint failure.", "solution": "The key facts and logical sequence are as follows.\n\n1) State of the cell at drug addition: The cell has completed anaphase, meaning sister chromatids have been segregated to opposite poles by the mitotic spindle. This implies that the spindle-assembly checkpoint has been satisfied, separase has acted, cohesin has been cleaved, and anaphase A/B have occurred to position chromosomes at the poles.\n\n2) Role of myosin-II in subsequent events: Cytokinesis in animal cells requires assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring at the equatorial cortex. Myosin-II is the ATPase motor that interacts with filamentous actin to generate constriction force and drive cleavage furrow ingression. Inhibiting myosin-II ATPase activity prevents contractile ring constriction and furrow ingression.\n\n3) Processes unaffected by Myoblockin: By assumption, all other cellular processes remain unaffected. Therefore, mitotic exit proceeds: the cell transitions to telophase, spindle disassembles, the nuclear envelope re-forms around each segregated chromosome set, and chromosomes decondense within each nascent nucleus. Karyokinesis thus completes, producing two nuclei.\n\n4) Consequence for cytokinesis: Without myosin-IIâ€“driven constriction, the cleavage furrow cannot ingress, the intercellular bridge and midbody cannot be properly formed to completion, and abscission cannot occur. Therefore, the plasma membrane does not divide the cytoplasm into two separate cells.\n\n5) Predicted final state: The cell will not split; it will remain as one cell containing two re-formed nuclei (a binucleated cell). This matches a single, enlarged cell with two distinct nuclei.\n\n6) Exclusion of alternatives:\n- Option B is incorrect because anaphase has already been completed and Myoblockin does not arrest chromosomes at the poles; mitotic exit proceeds.\n- Option C is incorrect because one large nucleus with doubled DNA content would require failure of karyokinesis; here, nuclear envelopes re-form around each segregated set, yielding two nuclei.\n- Option D is incorrect because cytokinesis fails without myosin-II, so two daughter cells do not form.\n- Option E is incorrect because immediate apoptosis due to checkpoint failure is not mandated; the spindle checkpoint has been satisfied, and cells commonly become binucleated after cytokinesis failure rather than undergoing immediate apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is a single binucleated cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2324836"}, {"introduction": "A successful cell division requires not only that the right events happen, but that they happen in the right order. This practice [@problem_id:2324838] presents a hypothetical scenario where the timing of cytokinesis is triggered prematurely, occurring before chromosomes have fully segregated. This thought experiment is crucial for understanding why tight coordination between anaphase and cytokinesis is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, a condition linked to many human diseases.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a line of diploid eukaryotic cells ($2n$) is treated with a hypothetical drug called \"PreCise.\" This drug disrupts the normal coordination of the cell cycle by causing the actin-myosin contractile ring to assemble and constrict at the cell's equator during mid-anaphase, rather than waiting for late anaphase or telophase. Assume that in an affected cell, the chromosomes of one homologous pair fail to properly segregate past the plane of division before the cleavage furrow fully divides the cell. Which of the following describes the most direct and immediate consequence for the genetic material of the two resulting daughter cells?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will be polyploid, each containing a $4n$ complement of chromosomes.\n\nB. A single, large binucleated cell will form as cytokinesis reverses and fails.\n\nC. One daughter cell will be hyperploid (e.g., $2n+1$) and the other will be hypoploid (e.g., $2n-1$).\n\nD. Both daughter cells will be euploid ($2n$), but one will be significantly larger than the other.\n\nE. One daughter cell will be euploid ($2n$), while the other will be anucleated (lacking a nucleus).", "solution": "We begin with a diploid eukaryotic cell of chromosome complement $2n$. After $S$ phase, each chromosome has been replicated into two sister chromatids joined at their centromere, but the ploidy designation remains $2n$ because ploidy counts sets of homologous chromosomes, not chromatids. During normal mitosis, in anaphase, sister chromatids of each chromosome separate and move to opposite poles so that each nascent daughter nucleus receives one chromatid from each pair, restoring the $2n$ complement in each daughter.\n\nCytokinesis is driven by the actin-myosin contractile ring forming a cleavage furrow at the cell equator. Physiologically, this furrow initiates and completes only after chromosomes have cleared the division plane in late anaphase to telophase, ensuring that no chromosomes are trapped or missegregated. The drug described forces premature assembly and constriction of the ring in mid-anaphase, when some chromosomes have not yet moved past the equator.\n\nThe condition specified is that the chromosomes of one homologous pair fail to segregate past the plane of division before the furrow completes. Functionally, this is equivalent to a mitotic missegregation or nondisjunction event for that chromosome: the plane of cytokinesis bisects the spindle before the sister chromatids (or, stated in terms of homologous identity, that chromosome type) have been properly partitioned, so that both copies of that chromosome end up on one side of the furrow while none end up on the other. The immediate genetic consequence is that one daughter inherits an extra copy of that chromosome (hyperploid for that chromosome), and the other daughter lacks that chromosome (hypoploid for that chromosome). In terms of whole-cell karyotype notation, one daughter becomes $2n+1$ (trisomic for that chromosome), and the other becomes $2n-1$ (monosomic for that chromosome).\n\nWe exclude the alternatives as follows:\n- Polyploidy $4n$ (option A) would require either a complete failure of karyokinesis followed by cell cycle progression or endoreduplication; premature cytokinesis does not double the entire genome.\n- A single binucleated cell (option B) arises when cytokinesis fails or reverses; here, cytokinesis completes prematurely rather than failing.\n- Both daughters remaining euploid $2n$ with size differences (option D) contradicts the described missegregation across the cleavage plane, which alters chromosome number rather than merely cell size.\n- An anucleate daughter (option E) would require exclusion of the entire nuclear content from one cell, which is not implied; only one chromosome type is missegregated, not the entire genome.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is reciprocal aneuploidy: one daughter $2n+1$ and the other $2n-1$, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2324838"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists uncover the intricate mechanisms that govern cell division? This problem [@problem_id:2324816] places you in the role of an experimental biologist, tasked with interpreting data to understand the function of the central spindle in cytokinesis. By analyzing the results of a hypothetical laser-ablation experiment, you will learn to distinguish between competing scientific models, a core skill in biological research that separates knowing facts from understanding how they are discovered.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the role of the central spindle in animal cell cytokinesis. The central spindle is a structure composed of microtubule bundles that forms between the separating sets of chromosomes during anaphase and telophase. Two primary, non-exclusive hypotheses for its function are debated:\n\nHypothesis 1: The central spindle is required to send an initial signal that specifies the position of the cleavage furrow at the cell equator. Once this positioning signal is delivered, the spindle's role is complete, and the furrow can ingress autonomously.\n\nHypothesis 2: The central spindle is required throughout cytokinesis, not only for positioning the furrow but also for providing continuous signals that maintain the contractile ring and drive its ingression.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the biologist designs two experiments using a high-precision laser microbeam to ablate the central spindle in a dividing cell, without damaging other structures.\n- Experiment A: The central spindle is ablated during early anaphase, before any visible sign of cleavage furrow formation.\n- Experiment B: The central spindle is ablated during telophase, after the cleavage furrow has already formed and has ingressed to approximately 25% of the cell's diameter.\n\nWhich of the following sets of observations from these experiments would provide the strongest and most direct support for Hypothesis 2 over Hypothesis 1?\n\nA. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow fails to form. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow continues to ingress and successfully divides the cell.\n\nB. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow fails to form. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow halts its ingression and then regresses, leading to a failed cytokinesis.\n\nC. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow forms normally. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow halts its ingression and then regresses.\n\nD. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow forms at a random, non-equatorial position. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow continues to ingress and successfully divides the cell.\n\nE. In both Experiment A and Experiment B, the cleavage furrow forms and ingresses normally, leading to successful cell division.", "solution": "We compare the predictions of the two hypotheses against the outcomes of ablating the central spindle at two different times.\n\nBy Hypothesis 1 (initial-positioning-only): The central spindle is required to deliver the initial spatial cue that specifies the equatorial site of cleavage. After that cue is received, the contractile ring and furrow ingression proceed autonomously. Therefore:\n- If the central spindle is ablated early (before furrow formation), the furrow should fail to form (no initial cue delivered).\n- If the central spindle is ablated late (after the furrow has formed and begun ingression), the furrow should continue ingression to completion (maintenance signals are unnecessary).\n\nBy Hypothesis 2 (continuous requirement throughout cytokinesis): The central spindle is required not only for initial positioning but also for ongoing maintenance and progression of the contractile ring and furrow ingression. Therefore:\n- If the central spindle is ablated early (before furrow formation), the furrow should fail to form (no initial cue).\n- If the central spindle is ablated late (after the furrow has formed and partially ingressed, e.g., to about one quarter of the cell diameter), the furrow should halt and regress because the maintenance/ingression-driving signals are lost.\n\nNow match the predicted outcomes to the options:\n- Option A reports early failure to form a furrow and late normal completion. This aligns with Hypothesis 1 and contradicts Hypothesis 2â€™s prediction of late failure.\n- Option B reports early failure to form a furrow and late halting and regression of the existing furrow. This matches both aspects required by Hypothesis 2: initial requirement and ongoing requirement, and contradicts Hypothesis 1â€™s prediction of late autonomy.\n- Option C reports early normal furrow formation despite early ablation, which is inconsistent with both hypotheses as stated (both posit at least an initial role for the central spindle), though the late failure is consistent with Hypothesis 2. This is not the strongest or most direct support.\n- Option D reports early mispositioning (random, non-equatorial) and late normal completion, supporting a positioning-only role consistent with Hypothesis 1.\n- Option E reports no effect at either time, indicating the spindle is not required, contradicting both hypotheses.\n\nThus, the strongest and most direct support for Hypothesis 2 over Hypothesis 1 is provided by Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2324816"}]}
