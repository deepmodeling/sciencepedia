Consider a hypothetical enzyme that follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model. The velocity of the reaction, $v$, is related to the substrate concentration, $[S]$, by the well-established relationship that describes the rate of product formation.

Your task is to determine the substrate concentration required to achieve a specific reaction rate.
