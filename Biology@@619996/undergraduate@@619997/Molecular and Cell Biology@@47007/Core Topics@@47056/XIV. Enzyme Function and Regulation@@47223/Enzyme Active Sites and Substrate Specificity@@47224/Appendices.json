This practice places you in the role of a biochemist, analyzing kinetic data from a series of structurally related substrate analogs. By comparing how the enzyme 'Aryl Dehydrogenase X' responds to different molecules, you will deduce the key chemical features its active site recognizes and classify its level of specificity, a fundamental skill in enzymology [@problem_id:2314185].", "problem": "A team of biochemists has isolated a novel enzyme, Aryl Dehydrogenase X (ADX), from a soil bacterium. Preliminary studies suggest that ADX catalyzes the oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde, coupled with the reduction of NAD$^+$ to NADH. To investigate the substrate specificity of ADX's active site, the team conducts a series of kinetic assays. Each assay uses a different potential substrate, but is performed under identical conditions of enzyme concentration, temperature, pH, and cofactor concentration. The initial velocity ($V_0$) of the reaction is determined by monitoring the rate of NADH production.\n\nThe table below summarizes the results obtained with five different test compounds, all at an initial concentration of 1 mM.\n\n| Substrate Tested | Description | Initial Velocity, $V_0$ ($\\mu$M/min) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Benzyl alcohol | An aromatic primary alcohol; $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-OH}$ | 150 |\n| p-Methylbenzyl alcohol | A primary alcohol with a methyl-substituted aromatic ring | 135 |\n| 1-Phenylethanol | An aromatic secondary alcohol; $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{-CH(OH)-CH}_3$ | 25 |\n| Cyclohexylmethanol | An aliphatic (non-aromatic) primary alcohol | 5.0 |\n| p-Cresol | A phenol, where the hydroxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring | 0.5 |\n\nBased on the experimental data provided, which of the following statements most accurately describes the substrate specificity of Aryl Dehydrogenase X?\n\nA.

ADX exhibits group specificity, acting on any compound containing a hydroxyl group.", "solution": "The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme converts an alcohol to a carbonyl compound with the simultaneous reduction of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ to $\\mathrm{NADH}$. The initial velocity $V_{0}$ is measured via the rate of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ formation. Under identical conditions of enzyme concentration $[E]_{T}$, temperature, pH, cofactor concentration, and substrate concentration $[S]$ (here, each substrate at $[S]=1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), the Michaelis–Menten form\n$$\nV_{0}=\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{M}+[S]}\n$$\nimplies that differences in $V_{0}$ across substrates reflect differences in $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{M}}$ and, if $[S]$ is not saturating, approximate differences in catalytic efficiency. Thus, the relative magnitudes of $V_{0}$ indicate relative substrate preference.\n\nFrom the data: benzyl alcohol (aromatic primary, benzylic) gives $V_{0}=150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$; $p$-methylbenzyl alcohol (aromatic primary, benzylic with ring substitution) gives $V_{0}=135\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$; 1-phenylethanol (aromatic secondary, benzylic) gives $V_{0}=25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$; cyclohexylmethanol (aliphatic primary) gives $V_{0}=5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$; $p$-cresol (phenol; hydroxyl directly on the ring, not benzylic) gives $V_{0}=0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$. The pattern shows:\n- Highest activity for primary benzylic (aromatic) alcohols, tolerant of a para methyl substituent on the ring (benzyl alcohol and $p$-methylbenzyl alcohol both high).\n- Substantially reduced activity for a secondary benzylic alcohol (1-phenylethanol).\n- Very low activity for an aliphatic primary alcohol (cyclohexylmethanol).\n- Negligible activity for a phenol, where the hydroxyl is not benzylic ($p$-cresol).\n\nThese observations exclude absolute specificity (since more than one substrate is efficiently turned over) and exclude stereospecificity (no enantiomeric comparison is provided; the dominant determinant is chemical class, not stereochemistry). They also exclude lack of specificity or general hydroxyl recognition (aliphatic alcohols and phenols are poor substrates). The data are best explained by group specificity for primary aromatic (benzylic) alcohols.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that ADX exhibits group specificity, preferentially acting on primary aromatic alcohols.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2314185"}, {"introduction": "The binding of a substrate to an enzyme's active site is not just about the 'lock-and-key' fit; the surrounding solvent plays a critical, and often dominant, role. This exercise explores the hydrophobic effect, a primary driving force for molecular recognition in aqueous biological systems. By considering a hypothetical shift from a water-based buffer to a nonpolar solvent, you can isolate and appreciate how the unique properties of water powerfully promote the association of nonpolar groups, leading to a significant increase in binding affinity [@problem_id:2314167].", "problem": "An enzyme, \"Lipidex,\" has an active site that is known to be a deep, nonpolar pocket lined with hydrophobic amino acid residues such as leucine, valine, and isoleucine. It specifically binds to its substrate, dodecane ($\\text{C}_{12}\\text{H}_{26}$), which is a long, nonpolar hydrocarbon chain. The strength of this binding is quantified by the dissociation constant, $K_d$. A smaller $K_d$ value indicates a higher binding affinity.\n\nAn experiment is conducted in two different solvent environments. First, the $K_d$ for the binding of dodecane to Lipidex is measured in a standard aqueous buffer at pH 7.4. Second, the entire experiment is repeated, but this time the solvent is changed from the aqueous buffer to pure liquid hexane ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{14}$), a nonpolar organic solvent.\n\nAssume that the enzyme maintains its correct three-dimensional folded structure and remains catalytically active in the hexane solvent. Based on the principles of molecular interactions and thermodynamics, predict the most likely outcome for the dissociation constant ($K_d$) when the solvent is changed from the aqueous buffer to hexane.\n\nA. The $K_d$ will decrease significantly, indicating much stronger binding.\n\nB. The $K_d$ will increase significantly, indicating much weaker binding.\n\nC. The $K_d$ will remain approximately the same because the intrinsic van der Waals forces between the substrate and the active site are independent of the solvent.\n\nD. The binding process will switch from being primarily entropy-driven to enthalpy-driven, but the overall $K_d$ will not change significantly.", "solution": "Define the binding equilibrium in a given solvent $s$ as $E + L \\rightleftharpoons EL$ with dissociation constant $K_{d,s}$ and association constant $K_{a,s} = \\frac{1}{K_{d,s}}$. The standard Gibbs free energy of binding in solvent $s$ is related to $K_{d,s}$ by\n$$\n\\Delta G_{s}^{0} = -R T \\ln K_{a,s} = R T \\ln K_{d,s}.\n$$\nThus, if $\\Delta G_{s}^{0}$ becomes less favorable (more positive), then $K_{d,s}$ increases; conversely, if $\\Delta G_{s}^{0}$ becomes more favorable (more negative), then $K_{d,s}$ decreases.\n\nDecompose the binding free energy into enthalpic and entropic contributions in solvent $s$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{s}^{0} = \\Delta H_{s}^{0} - T \\Delta S_{s}^{0}.\n$$\nFurther partition the contributions into contact terms (ligand–active-site interactions, largely van der Waals for a nonpolar ligand and pocket) and solvent-dependent terms (desolvation and solvent entropy):\n$$\n\\Delta H_{s}^{0} = \\Delta H_{\\text{contact}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{desolv},s}, \\quad\n\\Delta S_{s}^{0} = \\Delta S_{\\text{conf}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{solv},s}.\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta H_{\\text{contact}}$ arises from ligand–pocket dispersion contacts and is expected to be similar across solvents because the same noncovalent contacts form in the bound complex. $\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}$ reflects the loss of translational, rotational, and conformational freedom upon binding and is negative in any solvent. The solvent-dependent terms $\\Delta H_{\\text{desolv},s}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\text{solv},s}$ differ strongly between water and hexane.\n\nIn water (aqueous buffer), a nonpolar ligand and a hydrophobic pocket are poorly solvated by water. Binding buries nonpolar surface area and releases structured water molecules from the ligand surface and from the hydrophobic pocket. This yields a large, favorable solvent entropy term:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{solv},\\text{water}} \\gg 0 \\quad \\text{(hydrophobic effect)}.\n$$\nBecause water–nonpolar interactions are weak, the enthalpic penalty for desolvation is relatively small:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{desolv},\\text{water}} \\gtrsim 0 \\ \\text{(small penalty)},\n$$\nwhile $\\Delta H_{\\text{contact}}$ is favorable due to van der Waals complementarity.
