The inhibition is complete and irreversible at the concentration used.\n\nIf these isolated mitochondria are provided with an ample supply of acetyl-CoA and all necessary cofactors, which of the following metabolic intermediates would be expected to accumulate to the highest concentration as a direct result of the toxin's action?\n\nA.

Oxaloacetate", "solution": "We are told the toxin is a specific, non-competitive, complete and irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase acting on isolated mitochondria supplied with ample acetyl-CoA and cofactors. Succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with reduction of FAD, and it is the only tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of electron transport chain complex II. The catalyzed reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{succinate} + \\text{FAD} \\longrightarrow \\text{fumarate} + \\text{FADH}_{2}.\n$$\nIn Michaelis-Menten terms for non-competitive inhibition, the apparent $V_{\\max}$ is reduced while $K_{m}$ for succinate is unchanged. Since the inhibition is complete and irreversible at the concentration used, we can take the effective $V_{\\max}$ of succinate dehydrogenase to be reduced to zero, so its net flux is:\n$$\nv_{6} = 0.\n$$\n\nConsider the tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes labeled in sequence. Using standard steps:\n1. Citrate synthase:\n$$\n\\text{oxaloacetate} + \\text{acetyl-CoA} \\longrightarrow \\text{citrate} + \\text{CoA-SH}.\n$$\n2.

In steady state without inhibition, fluxes are equal through the cycle, so $v_{5} = v_{6} = v_{7} = \\cdots$. With complete inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, we have $v_{6} = 0$. The time evolution of key intermediates near the block is then:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{succinate}]}{dt} = v_{5} - v_{6} = v_{5} > 0 \\quad \\text{initially,}\n$$\nso succinate accumulates. For fumarate,\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{fumarate}]}{dt} = v_{6} - v_{7} = -v_{7}  0,\n$$\nso fumarate decreases. For malate and oxaloacetate, which are downstream of fumarate, their production is curtailed, so they also decrease.\n\nUpstream intermediates such as isocitrate and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate may experience altered levels due to feedback and congestion as the cycle stalls, but the immediate, direct consequence of blocking the conversion of succinate to fumarate is accumulation of the substrate of the inhibited enzyme, succinate. Because $v_{6}$ is zero while $v_{5}$ remains positive so long as acetyl-CoA and cofactors are ample, succinate concentration rises most prominently among the listed options.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate that accumulates to the highest concentration as a direct result of succinate dehydrogenase inhibition is succinate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2318253"}, {"introduction": "The citric acid cycle is more than just a sequence of reactions; it is a story of carbon transformation. A common point of confusion is the ultimate fate of the carbons that enter the cycle via acetyl-CoA. This thought experiment asks you to trace these specific carbon atoms through one full turn of the cycle, revealing why animals cannot achieve a net synthesis of carbohydrates from fats [@problem_id:1749319]. This exercise provides a deeper understanding of the cycle's carbon economy and debunks a common misconception about its role in biosynthesis.", "problem": "In animal metabolism, fatty acids are broken down into acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which can then enter the citric acid cycle. A key metabolic limitation in animals is their inability to achieve a net synthesis of carbohydrates (e.g., glucose) from fats. This inability is directly related to the fate of the two carbon atoms from the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA as they are processed by the citric acid cycle.\n\nConsider a single molecule of acetyl-CoA, where the two carbons of its acetyl group enter the citric acid cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate. After one complete turn of the cycle, which results in the regeneration of one molecule of oxaloacetate, which of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of these two specific carbon atoms and the overall carbon balance of the cycle?\n\nA. Both carbon atoms from the acetyl-CoA are oxidized and released as two molecules of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) during the first turn of the cycle. This means there is no net gain of carbon.\n\nB. One of the carbon atoms from acetyl-CoA is released as $CO_2$, while the other becomes part of the regenerated oxaloacetate molecule. This results in a net gain of one carbon atom for the cycle.\n\nC. Neither of the two carbon atoms from the acetyl-CoA is released as $CO_2$. Instead, they both become part of the four-carbon backbone of the regenerated oxaloacetate molecule. However, two different carbon atoms (originating from the oxaloacetate that started the cycle) are released as $CO_2$, leading to no net change in the number of carbon atoms in the pool of cycle intermediates.\n\nD. Both carbon atoms from the acetyl-CoA are immediately released as $CO_2$, and the energy is used to fuel the anaplerotic synthesis of a new oxaloacetate molecule from pyruvate, resulting in no net change in the cycle intermediates.\n\nE. The two carbons from acetyl-CoA are retained through the first cycle turn but are guaranteed to be released as $CO_2$ in the second turn. This slight delay allows for a temporary net synthesis of oxaloacetate, which is then immediately consumed.", "solution": "We consider the carbon accounting and labeling through one complete turn of the citric acid cycle following the entry of the two-carbon acetyl unit from acetyl-CoA. Let the four carbons of oxaloacetate be labeled $O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, O_{4}$ and the two carbons of the acetyl group be $A_{1}, A_{2}$. The relevant reactions and their carbon counts are:\n$$\\text{Oxaloacetate }(4C)+\\text{Acetyl-CoA }(2C)\\xrightarrow{\\text{citrate synthase}}\\text{Citrate }(6C),$$\n$$\\text{Citrate }(6C)\\xrightarrow{\\text{isomerization}}\\text{Isocitrate }(6C),$$\n$$\\text{Isocitrate }(6C)\\xrightarrow{\\text{isocitrate dehydrogenase}}\\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate }(5C)+CO_{2},$$\n$$\\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate }(5C)\\xrightarrow{\\alpha\\text{-KG dehydrogenase}}\\text{Succinyl-CoA }(4C)+CO_{2},$$\n$$\\text{Succinyl-CoA}\\to\\text{Succinate}\\to\\text{Fumarate}\\to\\text{Malate}\\to\\text{Oxaloacetate }(4C).$$\n\nBy conservation of carbon, the net cycle from oxaloacetate back to oxaloacetate must have no net gain or loss of carbons in the pool of intermediates. The two decarboxylations in the first turn occur at the isocitrate dehydrogenase and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase steps. Established carbon-tracing shows that, during the first turn after entry of $A_{1}, A_{2}$, the carbons released as $CO_{2}$ originate from the oxaloacetate-derived portion of citrate (i.e., they were among $O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, O_{4}$), not from $A_{1}$ or $A_{2}$. Consequently, $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are retained through the succinyl-CoA to oxaloacetate steps and become part of the regenerated oxaloacetate after one turn.\n\nTherefore:\n- Neither $A_{1}$ nor $A_{2}$ is released as $CO_{2}$ in the first turn.\n- Two carbons are released as $CO_{2}$, but they derive from the oxaloacetate that initiated the cycle.\n- The pool of cycle intermediates shows no net change in total carbon because the two carbons lost from the starting oxaloacetate are exactly replaced by the two carbons from acetyl-CoA.\n\nThis rules out statements A, B, D, and E. In particular, A is false because the acetyl carbons are not lost in the first turn; B is false because one acetyl carbon is not released in the first turn; D introduces an external anaplerotic process not intrinsic to the cycle’s internal carbon balance; and E is false because, although the acetyl carbons can be released in subsequent turns, they are not guaranteed to be lost specifically in the second turn due to symmetry and scrambling in the succinate–fumarate–malate segment. The accurate description is that neither acetyl carbon is released in the first turn, and the two $CO_{2}$ arise from the original oxaloacetate, yielding no net change in the cycle intermediates, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1749319"}, {"introduction": "The primary role of the citric acid cycle is to act as the cell's central furnace for generating reducing power in the form of $NADH$ and $FADH_2$.

Different catabolic pathways can feed intermediates into the cycle at various points. Consider two scenarios for the metabolism of one mole of a substrate.

Substrate-level phosphorylation (e.g., GTP) is to be ignored.\n\nCase 1 (entry as acetyl-CoA): Oxidation of one mole of acetyl-CoA through a full turn of the citric acid cycle produces $3$ moles of NADH (from isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) and $1$ mole of $FADH_{2}$ (from succinate dehydrogenase).
