This organism has evolved an efficient respiratory chain to generate a chemiosmotic gradient for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis in its high-temperature environment. To understand its bioenergetics, the scientist conducts experiments under steady-state laboratory conditions that mimic its natural habitat.\n\nThe following parameters are determined:\n- The physiological free energy change for ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) is $\\Delta G'_{\\text{ATP}} = +58.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n- The organism maintains a constant internal temperature of $T = 365 \\text{ K}$.\n- The electrical potential difference across its cell membrane is measured to be $\\Delta \\Psi = -150 \\text{ mV}$, with the cytoplasm being negative relative to the exterior.\n- The pH of the cytoplasm is maintained at $7.5$, while the external medium has a pH of $6.0$.\n\nAssuming the ATP synthase complex couples the energy from proton translocation to ATP synthesis with 100% efficiency, what is the minimum integer number of protons that must pass through the synthase from the exterior to the cytoplasm to power the synthesis of a single molecule of ATP?\n\nYou are given the Faraday constant, $F = 96,485 \\text{ C/mol}$, and the Ideal Gas Constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J/(mol}\\cdot\\text{K)}$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must equate the energy required to synthesize one mole of ATP with the energy released by the translocation of $n$ moles of protons down their electrochemical gradient. The problem asks for the minimum integer number of protons, which means the energy provided by the protons must be at least equal to the energy required for ATP synthesis.\n\nFirst, the energy required to synthesize one mole of ATP is given as:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{\\text{ATP}} = +58.0 \\text{ kJ/mol} = +58,000 \\text{ J/mol} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy released when one mole of protons moves from the exterior to the cytoplasm.
