This pathway is divided into an energy-investment phase and an energy-payoff phase. A key intermediate step involves the enzyme aldolase, which cleaves the six-carbon sugar fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two distinct three-carbon molecules: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DHAP). Under normal conditions, the enzyme Triose Phosphate Isomerase (TPI) rapidly converts the DHAP into G3P. This ensures that two molecules of G3P proceed through the energy-payoff phase.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell with a specific genetic mutation that results in a completely non-functional Triose Phosphate Isomerase enzyme. Assume all other glycolytic enzymes are fully functional and that all necessary cofactors, such as $NAD^+$, and substrates are available in non-limiting quantities.\n\nStarting with a single molecule of glucose, what is the net number of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules produced by the entire glycolytic pathway under these specific conditions?", "solution": "Glycolysis begins with the energy-investment phase, which consumes two ATP per glucose:\n$$\\text{Hexokinase:}\\quad \\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP}$$\n$$\\text{Phosphofructokinase-1:}\\quad \\text{Fructose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + \\text{ADP}$$\nThus, ATP consumed in the investment phase is\n$$\\Delta \\text{ATP}_{\\text{investment}} = -2.$$\n\nAldolase then cleaves fructose-1,6-bisphosphate:\n$$\\text{Aldolase:}\\quad \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} \\rightarrow \\text{Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)} + \\text{Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)}.$$\nWith a completely non-functional triose phosphate isomerase, the conversion\n$$\\text{DHAP} \\rightleftarrows \\text{G3P}$$\ndoes not occur.

Let's number its carbons from C-1 (aldehyde group) to C-6. The label is on C-4.\nGlucose: C1-C2-C3-C4*-C5-C6 (where * denotes the $^{14}$C label).\n\n**Energy Investment Phase (Steps 1-5):**\n1.  **Step 1 (Hexokinase):** Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate. The carbon skeleton is unchanged. Label is still at C-4.\n2.  **Step 2 (Phosphoglucose Isomerase):** Glucose-6-phosphate (an aldose) is isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate (a ketose). This re-arranges the functional groups but preserves the carbon numbering sequence. The label remains at C-4.\n3.  **Step 3 (Phosphofructokinase-1):** Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The carbon skeleton is unchanged. Label is still at C-4.\n    FBP: C1-C2-C3-C4*-C5-C6.\n\n4.  **Step 4 (Aldolase):** This is the critical cleavage step.

Specifically, C-4 of FBP becomes C-1 of GAP. C-5 of FBP becomes C-2 of GAP, and C-6 of FBP becomes C-3 of GAP.\n    -   Labeled GAP: C1*-C2-C3 (derived from glucose C4*-C5-C6).\n    -   Unlabeled DHAP: C1-C2-C3 (derived from glucose C3-C2-C1).\n\n5.  **Step 5 (Triose Phosphate Isomerase):** The DHAP molecule is rapidly and reversibly isomerized into a second molecule of GAP. This second GAP molecule is derived from the unlabeled top half of the original glucose molecule (C-1, C-2, C-3). Therefore, it is unlabeled.\n\nAt the end of the investment phase, we have two molecules of GAP. One molecule is labeled at its C-1 position, and the other is completely unlabeled. Only the labeled GAP molecule needs to be traced further.\n\n**Energy Payoff Phase (Steps 6-10):**\nThis phase converts each GAP molecule into a pyruvate molecule. We follow the fate of the carbons in our labeled GAP (C1*-C2-C3).\n\n6.  **Step 6 (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase):** GAP is oxidized and phosphorylated to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The aldehyde group at C-1 becomes a high-energy acyl phosphate group. The carbon numbering remains the same. The label is at C-1.\n7.  **Step 7 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase):** The phosphate group from C-1 is transferred to ADP to form ATP. The molecule becomes 3-phosphoglycerate. The C-1 is now a carboxyl group. The label is still at C-1.\n8.  **Step 8 (Phosphoglycerate Mutase):** The phosphate group is moved from C-3 to C-2, forming 2-phosphoglycerate. The label remains on the carboxyl C-1.\n9.  **Step 9 (Enolase):** A water molecule is removed to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), creating a high-energy enol-phosphate bond. The label is still on the carboxyl C-1.\n10. **Step 10 (Pyruvate Kinase):** The phosphate group from C-2 is transferred to ADP, forming ATP and the final product, pyruvate. The carbon skeleton rearranges from PEP to the stable keto form of pyruvate.\n    -   C-1 of PEP (carboxyl group) becomes C-1 of pyruvate (carboxyl group).\n    -   C-2 of PEP (enol-phosphate) becomes C-2 of pyruvate (keto group).\n    -   C-3 of PEP (methylene group) becomes C-3 of pyruvate (methyl group).\n\nOur label, which was on C-1 throughout the payoff phase, ends up on C-1 of the pyruvate molecule. The problem states that C-1 of pyruvate is the carboxyl carbon.\n\nTherefore, the radioactive label from C-4 of glucose is found exclusively on the carboxyl carbon (C-1) of one of the two pyruvate molecules produced.
