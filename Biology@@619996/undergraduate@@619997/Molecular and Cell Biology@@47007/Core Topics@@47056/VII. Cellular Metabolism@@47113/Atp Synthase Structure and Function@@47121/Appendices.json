This exercise explores the fundamental stoichiometry of the enzyme, demonstrating how the number of subunits in the rotating c-ring dictates the number of protons required to generate ATP. By working through this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:2305088], you will gain a quantitative understanding of the tight coupling between proton flow, mechanical rotation, and energy conversion in cellular respiration.", "problem": "In the process of cellular respiration, the enzyme ATP synthase harnesses the energy from a proton gradient to synthesize Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell. The enzyme is composed of two main complexes: the F1 complex, which catalyzes ATP synthesis, and the F0 complex, which acts as a proton-driven motor embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane.\n\nThe rotation of the F0 motor is driven by the passage of protons down their electrochemical gradient. This motor contains a ring of protein subunits, known as the c-ring. For every proton that passes through the F0 complex, the c-ring rotates by a specific angle. A complete 360-degree rotation of the c-ring drives the F1 complex to synthesize exactly 3 molecules of ATP.\n\nA research team has isolated a novel thermophilic bacterium from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Analysis of its respiratory chain reveals an ATP synthase with a unique c-ring composed of 12 identical subunits. Assuming the fundamental mechanism is conserved, how many protons must be translocated across the membrane by this bacterium's F0 complex to produce 3 molecules of ATP?", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires understanding the stoichiometric relationship between proton flow, the rotation of the F0 motor, and ATP synthesis by the F1 complex.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of protons required for one complete 360-degree rotation of the c-ring. The problem states that the c-ring is composed of 12 identical subunits. The mechanochemical coupling in the F0 motor dictates that the translocation of one proton drives the rotation of the ring by an angle equivalent to the space occupied by one subunit. Therefore, for the c-ring to perform one full revolution, a number of protons equal to the number of subunits must pass through the channel.\n\nLet $N_c$ be the number of subunits in the c-ring. The number of protons, $N_p$, required for one full rotation is:\n$$N_p(\\text{full rotation}) = N_c$$\nGiven that $N_c = 12$ for the bacterium's ATP synthase, the number of protons required for a full rotation is:\n$$N_p(\\text{full rotation}) = 12$$\n\nNext, we relate the mechanical rotation to the chemical synthesis of ATP. The problem states that a complete 360-degree rotation of the c-ring drives the synthesis of exactly 3 molecules of ATP.\n$$1 \\text{ full rotation} \\rightarrow 3 \\text{ ATP molecules}$$\n\nThe question asks for the number of protons needed to produce 3 molecules of ATP. Based on the information provided, the synthesis of 3 ATP corresponds directly to the energy derived from one full rotation of the c-ring.\n\nWe have already determined that one full rotation requires the translocation of 12 protons. Therefore, the number of protons required to produce 3 molecules of ATP is precisely the number of protons required for one full rotation.\n\nThus, 12 protons must be translocated across the membrane to generate 3 molecules of ATP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2305088"}, {"introduction": "The rotation of the $F_0$ motor provides the mechanical force for ATP synthesis, but how is this force translated into chemical energy? This practice delves into the renowned \"binding change mechanism,\" which explains how the spinning central stalk induces conformational changes in the $F_1$ head's catalytic subunits. This thought experiment involving a stalled motor [@problem_id:2305140] will clarify the crucial cause-and-effect relationship between the rotor and the stationary catalytic sites.", "problem": "The enzyme ATP synthase is a molecular motor essential for cellular energy production. It consists of two main parts: the F0 motor embedded in a membrane, and the F1 head which projects into the aqueous compartment (e.g., the mitochondrial matrix). The F0 motor includes a rotating component called the c-ring, which is driven by the flow of protons down their electrochemical gradient. The F0 motor is physically connected to the F1 head by a central stalk, the gamma subunit. The rotation of the c-ring forces this gamma subunit to rotate. The F1 head is composed of several subunits, including three catalytic beta subunits, which are responsible for synthesizing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The beta subunits themselves do not rotate; they are held stationary as the gamma subunit rotates within them. The rotation of the asymmetrical gamma subunit induces a cycle of three different conformational states in each beta subunit (Open, Loose, and Tight), which drives ATP synthesis and release.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line where a mutation causes the c-ring of the ATP synthase to become permanently and covalently locked to a stationary part of the F0 complex. This prevents the c-ring from rotating, even in the presence of a strong proton gradient across the membrane. Assuming the overall structure of the F1 head remains intact, what is the most direct consequence for the three beta subunits?\n\nA. The beta subunits will begin to rotate in the opposite direction to compensate for the locked c-ring.\n\nB. The beta subunits will detach from the F1 head, leading to the disassembly of the enzyme.\n\nC. The beta subunits will begin to hydrolyze ATP into ADP and Pi at a high rate.\n\nD. Each beta subunit will be trapped in a single, unchanging conformational state.\n\nE. The beta subunits will continuously bind ADP and Pi but will be unable to convert them into ATP.", "solution": "We use the binding-change mechanism of ATP synthase: proton-motive-force-driven rotation of the F0 c-ring applies torque through the central stalk (the gamma subunit) to the F1 head. The three catalytic beta subunits in F1 do not rotate; instead, their conformational states are determined by the angular position of the asymmetrical gamma subunit. Each beta subunit cycles through Open (O), Loose (L), and Tight (T) conformations as the gamma subunit rotates, thereby driving binding of substrates, catalysis of ATP formation, and product release.\n\nLet the c-ring angular velocity be $\\omega_{c}$ and the gamma subunit angular velocity be $\\omega_{\\gamma}$. Because the gamma subunit is rigidly coupled to the c-ring, we have\n$$\n\\omega_{\\gamma} = \\omega_{c}.\n$$\nLet $\\theta_{\\gamma}$ be the angular position of the gamma subunit. The conformation of each beta subunit $i$ can be represented as a function $S_{i} = f_{i}(\\theta_{\\gamma})$, where the three $f_{i}$ are phase-shifted by $2\\pi/3$ to give the three distinct O, L, and T states at any given $\\theta_{\\gamma}$. Catalytic cycling requires time-dependent change in $\\theta_{\\gamma}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_{\\gamma}}{dt} = \\omega_{\\gamma}.\n$$\n\nIn the engineered mutant, the c-ring is covalently locked to a stationary part of F0. This imposes\n$$\n\\omega_{c} = 0 \\implies \\omega_{\\gamma} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\theta_{\\gamma}}{dt} = 0,\n$$\nso $\\theta_{\\gamma}$ is constant in time. Therefore, for each beta subunit,\n$$\nS_{i}(t) = f_{i}(\\theta_{\\gamma}(t)) = f_{i}(\\theta_{\\gamma}(0)),\n$$\nremains fixed. Hence each beta subunit is trapped in whatever conformational state it had at the moment the complex became immobilized (one likely in O, one in L, one in T), with no interconversion among O, L, and T.\n\nThis rules out the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because beta subunits are stator components; they do not rotate.\n- B is incorrect because immobilization of rotation does not imply disassembly of F1.\n- C is incorrect because high-rate ATP hydrolysis by F1 requires rotation of the gamma subunit; with $\\omega_{\\gamma}=0$, the catalytic cycle is arrested.\n- E is incorrect because “continuous binding” requires cycling through states; with a fixed $\\theta_{\\gamma}$, only the subunit already in the L-like state would bind ADP and Pi, but it cannot proceed to T for catalysis without rotation, so there is no continuous cycle.\n\nThus, the most direct consequence is that each beta subunit is trapped in a single, unchanging conformational state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2305140"}, {"introduction": "The continuous rotation of ATP synthase depends on a series of precise chemical events at the atomic level. This final practice zooms into the heart of the proton channel to examine the critical function of a single amino acid residue in facilitating proton transport. By analyzing the consequences of a specific mutation [@problem_id:2305125], you will appreciate how electrostatics and protein structure orchestrate the step-by-step process that powers this incredible molecular machine.", "problem": "The $F_0$ motor of ATP synthase couples the electrochemical potential energy of a proton gradient to the mechanical rotation of its central c-ring. This rotation drives the synthesis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in the $F_1$ catalytic headpiece. The stationary 'a' subunit of the $F_0$ motor contains two aqueous half-channels that provide a path for protons across the membrane: one opening to the intermembrane space (high proton concentration) and one opening to the mitochondrial matrix (low proton concentration). Protons enter the first half-channel, bind to a glutamate residue on a c-subunit, and induce a rotation of the c-ring. For the rotation to be productive, the proton must eventually be released from the glutamate into the matrix via the second half-channel. A crucial component of this release mechanism is a highly conserved, positively charged arginine residue located within the matrix-facing half-channel of the 'a' subunit.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where site-directed mutagenesis is used to replace this essential arginine residue with alanine, a small, uncharged amino acid. All other components of the ATP synthase remain unchanged, and a stable proton motive force is maintained across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the direct and immediate consequence of this specific mutation on the function of the ATP synthase complex?\n\nA. The complex will begin to operate in reverse, hydrolyzing matrix ATP to pump protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space.\n\nB. The c-ring will continue to rotate, but the process will become uncoupled, allowing protons to flow freely into the matrix and dissipating the proton gradient without any ATP synthesis.\n\nC. The $F_1$ subunit will structurally dissociate from the $F_0$ motor, as the mutation destabilizes the interface between the two major components.\n\nD. The c-ring will become rotationally stalled because the proton, having entered from the intermembrane space, will be unable to dissociate from its binding site on the glutamate residue into the matrix half-channel.\n\nE. Protons from the intermembrane space will successfully enter the first half-channel but will be sterically blocked from binding to the glutamate residues on the c-ring.", "solution": "ATP synthase couples the electrochemical proton motive force to mechanical rotation via the $F_0$ motor and the c-ring. In the standard mechanism, a proton enters the intermembrane-space-facing half-channel of subunit a, protonates a conserved glutamate on a c-subunit, the hydrophobic environment stabilizes the neutral form, and rotation carries this protonated c-subunit to the matrix-facing half-channel. There, a conserved positively charged arginine in subunit a facilitates proton release into the matrix by electrostatic stabilization of the deprotonated carboxylate and by repelling the proton, thereby lowering the free-energy barrier for deprotonation.\n\nFormally, the free-energy change to release the proton from the c-subunit glutamate into the matrix-facing half-channel can be written as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{chem}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{elec}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{int}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{chem}}$ includes the chemical component such as $2.303\\,k_{B}T\\,\\Delta\\text{pH}$, $\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}}$ includes the transmembrane potential contribution $q\\,\\Delta\\psi$, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ is the local interaction energy between the deprotonated carboxylate and nearby charged groups, dominated by the conserved arginine. The presence of the arginine makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ strongly favorable for the deprotonated state, effectively lowering the apparent $pK_{a}$ of the glutamate at the release site and enabling proton dissociation into the matrix half-channel.\n\nReplacing this essential arginine with alanine removes the positive charge and thus sets the stabilizing interaction term to approximately zero:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{(Arg} \\to \\text{Ala)}.\n$$\nThis increases $\\Delta G_{\\text{release}}$, making deprotonation of the c-subunit glutamate at the matrix half-channel thermodynamically unfavorable. Consequently, the glutamate remains protonated, and the rotor cannot proceed past the release site because the cycle requires deprotonation before further productive rotation. The immediate functional result is a rotational stall at the a–c interface.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because reverse operation requires a functional torque pathway; the mutation blocks the release step and stalls rotation rather than forcing reverse pumping.\n- B is incorrect because removal of the arginine does not allow continued rotation; instead it eliminates the electrostatic facilitation of proton release, stalling the c-ring. Although the arginine also helps prevent direct proton leakage between half-channels, the immediate mechanistic consequence at the catalytic step is failure of proton release and thus rotational arrest, not continued rotation with uncoupling.\n- C is incorrect; the mutation is localized within the a-subunit channel and does not directly destabilize the $F_1$–$F_0$ interface.\n- E is incorrect; the mutated residue resides in the matrix-facing half-channel and does not sterically block proton entry or initial binding to c-ring glutamates.\n\nTherefore, the direct and immediate consequence is that the c-ring becomes stalled because the proton cannot dissociate from the glutamate into the matrix half-channel without the conserved arginine’s positive charge to drive deprotonation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2305125"}]}
