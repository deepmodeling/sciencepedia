In the patient's cells, this defective aldolase exhibits only 10% of the catalytic activity of the normal enzyme. Aldolase is a key enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) into two three-carbon sugars. Further down the glycolytic pathway, the enzyme pyruvate kinase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. A key regulatory feature of glycolysis is that pyruvate kinase is strongly allosterically activated by F-1,6-BP.\n\nAssuming the patient's cells are at a metabolic steady state and are attempting to perform glycolysis, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected concentrations of F-1,6-BP and PEP in the patient's cells compared to a healthy individual?\n\nA. The concentration of F-1,6-BP will be increased, and the concentration of PEP will be increased.\nB.

For a given upstream drive $v_{\\text{PFK}}$, reducing $V_{\\max,\\text{ald}}$ requires an increased $[\\text{F-1,6-BP}]$ to achieve the same $v_{\\text{ald}}$ at steady state. Even if the overall flux $J$ decreases because aldolase becomes rate-limiting, the immediate kinetic consequence of lowering $V_{\\max,\\text{ald}}$ is an elevation of $[\\text{F-1,6-BP}]$ relative to normal until upstream regulation adjusts $v_{\\text{PFK}}$. Thus, compared to healthy cells,\n$$\n[\\text{F-1,6-BP}]_{\\text{patient}} > [\\text{F-1,6-BP}]_{\\text{healthy}}.\n$$\n\nFor phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), write the steady-state balance\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{PEP}]}{dt}=v_{\\text{enolase}}-v_{\\text{PK}}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_{\\text{enolase}}=v_{\\text{PK}}=J,\n$$\nwhere $v_{\\text{enolase}}$ is the rate forming PEP and $v_{\\text{PK}}$ is the pyruvate kinase rate. The supply $v_{\\text{enolase}}$ depends on the flux of triose phosphates produced by aldolase; with $V_{\\max,\\text{ald}}$ reduced to $0.10$ of normal, the downstream flux $J$ decreases, so the production rate of PEP falls.\n\nPyruvate kinase is strongly feed-forward activated by F-1,6-BP. Represent this activation as a multiplicative factor $a([\\text{F-1,6-BP}])$ with $a$ increasing in $[\\text{F-1,6-BP}]$, so\n$$\nv_{\\text{PK}}=a([\\text{F-1,6-BP}])\\,\\frac{V_{\\max,\\text{PK}}[\\text{PEP}]}{K_{\\text{M,PK}}+[\\text{PEP}]}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad a([\\text{F-1,6-BP}]_{\\text{patient}})>a([\\text{F-1,6-BP}]_{\\text{healthy}}).\n$$\nThus, in the patient, two effects act to lower $[\\text{PEP}]$: (i) reduced supply $v_{\\text{enolase}}$ due to impaired upstream flux, and (ii) increased clearance $v_{\\text{PK}}$ at any given $[\\text{PEP}]$ due to higher $a([\\text{F-1,6-BP}])$. At steady state, to satisfy $v_{\\text{enolase}}=v_{\\text{PK}}$ with a lower supply and stronger PK activation, $[\\text{PEP}]$ must be lower than in healthy cells:\n$$\n[\\text{PEP}]_{\\text{patient}} < [\\text{PEP}]_{\\text{healthy}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the concentration of F-1,6-BP will be increased, and the concentration of PEP will be decreased.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2335500"}, {"introduction": "Cells must tightly coordinate energy-producing pathways with their moment-to-moment energy needs. This coordination is often achieved through allosteric regulation by indicators of the cell's energy status, such as the ratio of ATP to AMP. This exercise examines a classic experimental scenario where ATP synthase is inhibited, forcing you to deduce the cellular response and revealing how glycolysis is \"turned up\" when oxidative phosphorylation fails [@problem_id:2051190]. This practice illuminates the fundamental feedback mechanism that maintains cellular energy homeostasis.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating the metabolic regulation of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast), a facultative anaerobe capable of both aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation. The yeast cells are cultured in a medium rich in glucose and oxygen, allowing them to rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation for the production of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The researchers then introduce oligomycin, a specific inhibitor that binds to the $F_o$ subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, blocking its proton channel. Following the addition of oligomycin, they observe that the rate of glucose consumption by the yeast culture increases dramatically.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for this observation?\n\nA. Oligomycin acts as a chemical uncoupler, dissipating the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and forcing the cell to burn more glucose to meet its ATP demands.\nB. The inhibition of ATP synthase causes a buildup of acetyl-CoA, which allosterically activates the initial enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, thereby increasing glucose uptake.\nC. Oligomycin's inhibition of ATP synthesis leads to a decrease in the cellular ratio of ATP to AMP. This change allosterically activates phosphofructokinase-1, a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, causing an increase in the glycolytic flux.\nD. By blocking the final step of respiration, oligomycin signals the cell to synthesize new, alternative electron carriers that require more glucose-derived reducing equivalents, thus increasing glucose consumption.\nE. The blockage of the proton channel by oligomycin causes a hyper-acidification of the mitochondrial matrix, which directly activates glucose transporters on the cell surface.", "solution": "Oligomycin binds the $F_o$ subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase and blocks its proton channel. By chemiosmotic coupling, ATP synthase uses the proton motive force to drive the reaction $\\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_{i}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ATP}$ as protons flow from the intermembrane space into the matrix. When $F_o$ is blocked, proton reentry is prevented, so ATP synthase activity ceases.\n\nWith proton reentry blocked, the proton motive force builds up and exerts backpressure on the electron transport chain, thereby slowing electron flow and oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, mitochondrial ATP production drops. The fall in ATP and rise in ADP are rapidly transduced by adenylate kinase:\n$$2\\,\\mathrm{ADP} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{AMP},$$\nso that a decrease in ATP synthesis leads to an increase in cellular $[\\mathrm{AMP}]$ and a decrease in the ATP to AMP ratio.\n\nPhosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the committed step of glycolysis, is allosterically activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP. Thus, a lower ATP to AMP ratio increases PFK-1 activity and thereby increases glycolytic flux. To meet ATP demand via substrate-level phosphorylation (at the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase steps), the cell increases glucose consumption. In yeast, when oxidative phosphorylation is compromised, glycolysis is further supported by fermentation to regenerate $\\text{NAD}^{+}$, sustaining the elevated glycolytic rate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is that oligomycin-induced inhibition of ATP synthase decreases the ATP to AMP ratio, allosterically activating PFK-1 and increasing glycolysis, which manifests as a dramatic increase in glucose consumption.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\n- A is incorrect because oligomycin is not an uncoupler; it does not dissipate the proton gradient but prevents its use, increasing the gradient and secondarily inhibiting electron transport.\n- B is incorrect because acetyl-CoA does not allosterically activate glycolysis; instead, citrate (downstream of acetyl-CoA) inhibits PFK-1, and acetyl-CoA regulates other enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase.\n- D is incorrect because cells do not acutely synthesize alternative electron carriers in response to oligomycin; the block is at ATP synthase, not at electron carriers.\n- E is incorrect because blocking the proton channel alkalinizes the matrix relative to the intermembrane space, not hyper-acidifies it, and mitochondrial matrix pH does not directly activate plasma membrane glucose transporters in this manner.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2051190"}, {"introduction": "The coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis is a cornerstone of cellular respiration, driven by the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The proton motive force is the sum of an electrical component, the membrane potential, and a chemical component, the transmembrane pH gradient.

Before valinomycin addition, the physiological $\\Delta \\psi$ is negative (matrix negative). Therefore, upon adding valinomycin, $K^{+}$ will flow into the matrix (down its electrochemical gradient), carrying positive charge inward and thereby driving $\\Delta \\psi$ toward the less negative (indeed, positive) value $E_{K}$. This inward $K^{+}$ movement collapses the magnitude of the membrane potential component of the proton motive force, i.e., it decreases $|\\Delta \\psi|$.\n\nBecause $\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{2.303\\,RT}{F}\\Delta \\text{pH}$, a rapid dissipation of $\\Delta \\psi$ reduces $\\Delta p$ unless fully compensated by an increase in $\\Delta \\text{pH}$.

Consequently, the net $\\Delta p$ decreases.\n\nA decreased $\\Delta p$ yields:\n- Decreased driving force for ATP synthase, so the rate of ATP synthesis decreases.\n- Reduced backpressure on the proton pumps of the respiratory chain. The work required to pump each proton is $-F\\,\\Delta \\psi + 2.303\\,RT\\,\\Delta \\text{pH}$ per proton; when this decreases, electron transport can proceed faster for a given substrate supply and ADP availability.
