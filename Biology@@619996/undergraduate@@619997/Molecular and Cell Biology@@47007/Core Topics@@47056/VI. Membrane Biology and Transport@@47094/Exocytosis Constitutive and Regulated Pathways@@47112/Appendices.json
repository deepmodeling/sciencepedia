This is possible only because secretory products are synthesized and packaged into vesicles long before they are needed. This thought experiment uses a hypothetical drug to block new protein synthesis, directly testing your understanding of this foundational \"store-now, release-later\" principle that distinguishes regulated from constitutive secretion. [@problem_id:2315619]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the secretory pathway in a specialized line of endocrine cells. These cells are known to release a peptide hormone, called \"Secretin-X\", exclusively in response to a specific extracellular signaling molecule. In an experiment, the biologist first incubates a culture of these cells for one hour in a medium containing a drug called proteoblock, which is known to be a highly effective and irreversible inhibitor of all ribosomal protein synthesis. Following this incubation, the drug is washed away, and the cells are immediately exposed to the signaling molecule that triggers Secretin-X release. The biologist observes that the cells still successfully secrete a significant amount of Secretin-X for a limited period of time.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most biologically accurate explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The signaling molecule activated a secondary, protein-independent pathway for exporting Secretin-X from the cell.\n\nB. The Secretin-X hormone was synthesized and packaged into secretory vesicles before the addition of proteoblock, awaiting the signal for release.\n\nC. The proteoblock drug only inhibits the final folding step of Secretin-X, allowing pre-existing, unfolded polypeptide chains to be correctly processed and secreted upon stimulation.\n\nD. The cell maintains a reserve of messenger RNA (mRNA) for Secretin-X that can be rapidly translated by drug-resistant ribosomes upon receiving the signal.\n\nE. The signaling molecule directly binds to Secretin-X inside the cytosol and carries it across the plasma membrane.", "solution": "The core experimental manipulation is exposure of cells to proteoblock, defined as a highly effective and irreversible inhibitor of all ribosomal protein synthesis. Irreversible inhibition of ribosomes implies that after binding, the inhibited ribosomes cannot resume translation even if the extracellular drug is washed away; therefore, new protein synthesis cannot occur immediately after washout. Consequently, any observed secretion of a peptide hormone following the wash must arise from proteins synthesized before the inhibition took effect.\n\nIn regulated secretory endocrine cells, peptide hormones are synthesized on ribosomes associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum via a signal peptide that mediates co-translational translocation into the ER lumen, followed by processing in the Golgi and packaging into secretory (dense-core) vesicles. In the regulated secretory pathway, these vesicles accumulate and are retained near the plasma membrane. Upon exposure to a specific extracellular signal, intracellular second messengers (commonly involving calcium) trigger SNARE- and synaptotagmin-dependent exocytosis of the preformed vesicles. Crucially, the exocytotic machinery and the prepackaged cargo do not require new protein synthesis on the time scale of minutes to hours to function, so brief inhibition of translation does not prevent release of vesicle contents; it prevents replenishment.\n\nThe observation that cells still secrete a significant amount of Secretin-X for a limited period after drug treatment and washout is thus explained by the presence of a preexisting pool of Secretin-X already synthesized and packaged into secretory vesicles prior to proteoblock treatment, which can be released upon stimulation until the pool is depleted. The “limited period” directly reflects depletion of finite preloaded stores in the absence of new synthesis.\n\nEvaluating the alternatives:\nA is incorrect because secretion of peptide hormones requires the protein-dependent exocytosis machinery; there is no physiological protein-independent export route for such cargo.\nC is incorrect because the drug targets ribosomal translation, not protein folding, and peptide hormones destined for secretion require co-translational translocation; there is no pool of unfolded cytosolic precursors that can be post hoc folded and secreted without prior ER entry.\nD is incorrect because the premise states inhibition of all ribosomal protein synthesis and irreversibility; there is no rapid translation by drug-resistant ribosomes in the same cells.\nE is incorrect because peptide hormones are not transported across the plasma membrane by direct binding to an extracellular signal; regulated secretion occurs by vesicle fusion.\n\nTherefore, the most biologically accurate explanation is that Secretin-X was synthesized and stored in secretory vesicles before the addition of proteoblock and released upon stimulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2315619"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of stored cargo, a critical question arises: how does the cell sort proteins destined for storage from those that are secreted continuously? This problem explores the molecular basis of this decision at the trans-Golgi network, focusing on the role of specific \"sorting signals\" embedded within the proteins themselves. By analyzing the fate of a hormone with a mutated sorting signal, you can deduce the cell's \"default\" secretory route and appreciate the logic of its internal trafficking system. [@problem_id:2315617]", "problem": "A research team is investigating protein secretion in a specialized, genetically engineered mammalian cell line. These cells are capable of both constitutive and regulated exocytosis. The team focuses on a newly discovered hormone, \"SignalHormone,\" which is normally secreted via the regulated pathway. The journey of SignalHormone begins with its synthesis and translocation into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), followed by transport to the Golgi apparatus. At the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN), SignalHormone molecules possess a specific sorting signal, a \"hydrophobic aggregation patch,\" that causes them to cluster together in the mildly acidic, high-calcium environment of the TGN lumen. This aggregation is the critical step for their selective packaging into dense-core secretory granules. These granules are then stored in the cytoplasm, awaiting an external stimulus to trigger their fusion with the plasma membrane and release their contents.\n\nUsing advanced gene-editing techniques, the researchers create a mutant version of the hormone, \"SignalHormone-mut\". In this mutant, the hydrophobic aggregation patch is eliminated by substituting key hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic ones, completely nullifying its function as a sorting signal. All other aspects of the protein, including its N-terminal signal peptide for ER entry and its final folded structure, are confirmed to be identical to the wild-type hormone.\n\nAssuming the SignalHormone-mut protein is successfully synthesized, translocated into the ER, and folds correctly, which of the following statements most accurately describes the ultimate fate of the majority of these mutant hormone molecules?\n\nA. They will be retro-translocated from the ER into the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nB. They will be packaged into transport vesicles at the TGN that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane in a continuous, non-stimulus-dependent manner.\n\nC. They will be permanently retained within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, as they lack a signal to exit.\n\nD. They will be sorted into vesicles destined for the lysosome and subsequently degraded.\n\nE. They will accumulate in the TGN until a strong extracellular stimulus forces them into secretory granules.", "solution": "The mutant SignalHormone-mut retains its N-terminal signal peptide, is synthesized into the ER lumen, and is confirmed to fold correctly. Correct folding means it passes ER quality control and is not targeted for ER-associated degradation. Therefore, retro-translocation to the cytosol and proteasomal degradation is not the predominant fate, excluding option A.\n\nAfter ER exit via COPII vesicles and transit through the Golgi, soluble secretory proteins reach the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In cells with both constitutive and regulated pathways, entry into dense-core secretory granules for regulated secretion typically requires a positive sorting mechanism, commonly pH and calcium-dependent aggregation mediated by specific aggregation patches and interaction with granule components. The wild-type SignalHormone uses a hydrophobic aggregation patch to condense in the TGN and be selectively packaged into regulated secretory granules.\n\nIn the mutant, this hydrophobic aggregation patch is eliminated. Without this regulated secretion sorting signal, the protein fails to aggregate and therefore fails to be captured into dense-core granules. In the absence of a positive regulated-sorting signal, the default pathway for soluble secretory proteins from the TGN is the constitutive secretory pathway. Thus, the majority of SignalHormone-mut will be packaged into constitutive secretory vesicles that continuously move to and fuse with the plasma membrane independent of external stimuli. This matches option B.\n\nOption C is incorrect because exit from the Golgi via the constitutive pathway does not require a specific positive exit signal; lack of a regulated-sorting signal does not cause permanent Golgi retention. Option D is incorrect because lysosomal delivery of soluble proteins generally requires mannose 6-phosphate tagging and recognition by MPRs, which is not present here. Option E is incorrect because, lacking granule incorporation, the mutant will not accumulate in the TGN awaiting a stimulus; stimuli trigger exocytosis of preformed granules, not forced entry of cargo into granules.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate fate for the majority of SignalHormone-mut molecules is continuous, constitutive secretion from the TGN to the plasma membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2315617"}, {"introduction": "Regulated exocytosis in systems like the synapse requires exquisite temporal precision—a massive burst of release perfectly synchronized with the arrival of an action potential. This final practice moves from protein sorting to the intricate mechanics of vesicle fusion, introducing the key regulatory protein complexin. By interpreting hypothetical electrophysiological data, you can quantitatively explore the sophisticated, dual role of this protein in both preventing accidental \"leaky\" release and priming vesicles for rapid, synchronous fusion upon receiving the calcium signal. [@problem_id:2315667]", "problem": "In a neurobiology laboratory, researchers are investigating the role of the protein complexin at a mammalian central synapse. They compare two groups of cultured neurons: a wild-type (WT) group and a knockout group that lacks the gene for complexin (Cpx-KO). Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, they measure two key properties of synaptic transmission.\n\nFirst, they measure the frequency of miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (mEPSCs), which are small currents resulting from the spontaneous, action-potential-independent fusion of single synaptic vesicles.\nSecond, they measure the peak amplitude of the Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC) evoked by a single presynaptic action potential. This current results from the synchronous fusion of many vesicles.\n\nFrom independent experiments, it is known that the average current produced by the fusion of a single vesicle, known as the quantal size ($q$), is identical in both WT and Cpx-KO neurons and is equal to $10.0 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nThe experimental data are as follows:\n-   **Wild-Type (WT):**\n    -   mEPSC frequency, $f_{\\text{mEPSC, WT}} = 0.50 \\text{ Hz}$\n    -   Evoked EPSC amplitude, $I_{\\text{EPSC, WT}} = 800.0 \\text{ pA}$\n-   **Complexin-Knockout (Cpx-KO):**\n    -   mEPSC frequency, $f_{\\text{mEPSC, KO}} = 2.50 \\text{ Hz}$\n    -   Evoked EPSC amplitude, $I_{\\text{EPSC, KO}} = 80.0 \\text{ pA}$\n\nTo quantify the efficiency of synchronous neurotransmission relative to spontaneous release, a \"Synchronization Index,\" $S$, is defined as the number of synchronously released vesicles per action potential ($N_{\\text{sync}}$) divided by the frequency of spontaneous single-vesicle release events ($f_{\\text{mEPSC}}$).\n\nCalculate the dimensionless ratio of the Synchronization Index for the wild-type synapse to that of the Cpx-KO synapse: $\\frac{S_{\\text{WT}}}{S_{\\text{KO}}}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the Synchronization Index of a wild-type (WT) synapse to that of a complexin-knockout (Cpx-KO) synapse. The Synchronization Index, $S$, is defined as $S = \\frac{N_{\\text{sync}}}{f_{\\text{mEPSC}}}$, where $N_{\\text{sync}}$ is the number of vesicles released synchronously upon an action potential, and $f_{\\text{mEPSC}}$ is the frequency of spontaneous vesicle fusion.\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of synchronously released vesicles, $N_{\\text{sync}}$, for both the WT and Cpx-KO conditions. The total amplitude of the evoked Excitatory Postsynaptic Current ($I_{\\text{EPSC}}$) is the product of the number of vesicles released synchronously and the current from a single vesicle, which is the quantal size ($q$).\n$$I_{\\text{EPSC}} = N_{\\text{sync}} \\times q$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $N_{\\text{sync}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{sync}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{EPSC}}}{q}$$\n\nNow, let's calculate $N_{\\text{sync}}$ for the WT synapse using the provided data: $I_{\\text{EPSC, WT}} = 800.0 \\text{ pA}$ and $q = 10.0 \\text{ pA}$.\n$$N_{\\text{sync, WT}} = \\frac{800.0 \\text{ pA}}{10.0 \\text{ pA}} = 80.0$$\nSo, a single action potential triggers the release of 80 vesicles in a WT synapse.\n\nNext, we calculate $N_{\\text{sync}}$ for the Cpx-KO synapse using the provided data: $I_{\\text{EPSC, KO}} = 80.0 \\text{ pA}$ and $q = 10.0 \\text{ pA}$.\n$$N_{\\text{sync, KO}} = \\frac{80.0 \\text{ pA}}{10.0 \\text{ pA}} = 8.0$$\nIn the Cpx-KO synapse, only 8 vesicles are released synchronously. This result quantitatively shows the severe defect in action-potential-evoked release in the absence of complexin.\n\nWith the values for $N_{\\text{sync}}$ determined, we can now calculate the Synchronization Index, $S$, for each condition. The formula is $S = \\frac{N_{\\text{sync}}}{f_{\\text{mEPSC}}}$.\n\nFor the WT synapse, we use $N_{\\text{sync, WT}} = 80.0$ and $f_{\\text{mEPSC, WT}} = 0.50 \\text{ Hz}$.\n$$S_{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{sync, WT}}}{f_{\\text{mEPSC, WT}}} = \\frac{80.0}{0.50 \\text{ Hz}} = 160.0 \\text{ s}$$\nThe unit 's' (seconds) arises because Hz is s$^{-1}$. This index signifies that the number of vesicles in one synchronous release event is equivalent to the number that would be released spontaneously over 160 seconds.\n\nFor the Cpx-KO synapse, we use $N_{\\text{sync, KO}} = 8.0$ and $f_{\\text{mEPSC, KO}} = 2.50 \\text{ Hz}$. Note that the spontaneous release frequency is 5 times higher in the KO, which quantitatively shows the increase in spontaneous release.\n$$S_{\\text{KO}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{sync, KO}}}{f_{\\text{mEPSC, KO}}} = \\frac{8.0}{2.50 \\text{ Hz}} = 3.2 \\text{ s}$$\nIn the Cpx-KO, the synchronous release is equivalent to only 3.2 seconds of spontaneous release, reflecting a poor ability to synchronize fusion relative to its high baseline leakage.\n\nFinally, we calculate the required ratio, $\\frac{S_{\\text{WT}}}{S_{\\text{KO}}}$.\n$$\\frac{S_{\\text{WT}}}{S_{\\text{KO}}} = \\frac{160.0 \\text{ s}}{3.2 \\text{ s}} = 50$$\n\nThis result numerically encapsulates the dual function of complexin. The absence of complexin increases the denominator of the index ($f_{\\text{mEPSC}}$) by removing the \"fusion clamp\" on the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor (SNARE) machinery, leading to more spontaneous release. Simultaneously, its absence catastrophically reduces the numerator ($N_{\\text{sync}}$) because complexin also plays a crucial role in cooperating with synaptotagmin to efficiently trigger vesicle fusion in response to calcium influx, thus synchronizing release. The combined effect leads to a 50-fold reduction in the synapse's ability to perform efficient, synchronized neurotransmission relative to its baseline activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$", "id": "2315667"}]}
