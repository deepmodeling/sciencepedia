The cytoplasmic tail of the wild-type (WT) CAR protein contains a canonical sorting motif, YXX$\\Phi$ (where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and $\\Phi$ is a bulky hydrophobic residue), which is essential for its recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. This recruitment is mediated by the binding of the Adaptor Protein 2 (AP-2) complex to this motif. For high-affinity binding to occur, the tyrosine residue within the motif must first be phosphorylated by a specific cellular kinase.\n\nTo study the importance of this phosphorylation, the biologist creates a mutant version of the receptor (MUT) in which the critical tyrosine residue is replaced by phenylalanine (F). Phenylalanine is structurally similar to tyrosine but lacks the hydroxyl group, making it impossible to phosphorylate.\n\nBiochemical measurements reveal the following kinetic parameters for the interaction between the CAR receptor's cytoplasmic tail and the AP-2 complex:\n- The dissociation constant for the interaction between the phosphorylated WT motif and AP-2 is $K_{d,WT}$.\n- The dissociation constant for the interaction between the non-phosphorylatable MUT motif and AP-2 is $K_{d,MUT}$.
