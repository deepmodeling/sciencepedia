This mutation alters the protein's structure such that it completely loses its ability to bind $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions. However, its glucose binding site and its ability to undergo the conformational changes that shuttle the binding site from one side of the membrane to the other remain perfectly intact.\n\nAssuming this mutated SGLT2 protein is correctly inserted into the cell membrane, which of the following transport mechanisms would it now mediate for glucose?\n\nA.

This is carrier-mediated passive transport (uniport), i.e., facilitated diffusion.\n\nIt is not simple diffusion because the process still requires a specific protein pathway rather than direct permeation through the lipid bilayer.

[@problem_id:2337731]", "problem": "Intestinal epithelial cells are responsible for absorbing nutrients from digested food. A key protein involved in this process is the Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1 (SGLT1). SGLT1 is a symporter that utilizes the electrochemical gradient of sodium ions ($\\text{Na}^{+}$) to drive the uptake of certain monosaccharides from the intestinal lumen into the cell. This transport mechanism is a form of secondary active transport. The transporter protein has a single binding site that can accommodate either a glucose molecule or a galactose molecule (along with $\\text{Na}^{+}$).\n\nConsider an in-vitro experiment where a culture of these intestinal cells is placed in a solution containing a constant, low concentration of radioactively labeled glucose and a physiological concentration of $\\text{Na}^{+}$.

The rate of glucose uptake will increase because galactose binding allosterically activates the transporter for glucose.\nB. The rate of glucose uptake will decrease due to competition for the transporter's binding site.\nC. The rate of glucose uptake will remain unchanged because the two sugars are transported independently.\nD. The transport of glucose will reverse direction, causing glucose to be exported from the cell.\nE. The transport of glucose will stop completely and instantaneously.", "solution": "We consider SGLT1, a $\\text{Na}^{+}$-coupled symporter with a single sugar-binding site that can bind either glucose or galactose (mutually exclusive occupancy), along with $\\text{Na}^{+}$. The external $\\text{Na}^{+}$ concentration is held constant, so its effect on the rate can be treated as a constant multiplicative factor for initial-rate analysis. The radiolabeled glucose concentration $[G^{*}]$ is kept low and constant. After the initial measurement, a very high concentration of non-radioactive galactose $[Gal]$ is added while maintaining $[G^{*}]$ and $[\\text{Na}^{+}]$.\n\nBecause glucose and galactose share the same site, they compete for binding. Under rapid equilibrium binding to a single site with dissociation constants $K_{G}$ for glucose and $K_{Gal}$ for galactose (to the transport-competent $\\text{Na}^{+}$-bound state), the fraction of transporters occupied by glucose is\n$$\n\\theta_{G}=\\frac{\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}}{1+\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}+\\frac{[Gal]}{K_{Gal}}}.\n$$\nThe initial transport rate of radiolabeled glucose is proportional to this occupancy, so\n$$\nv=\\alpha V_{\\max}\\,\\theta_{G}=\\alpha V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}}{1+\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}+\\frac{[Gal]}{K_{Gal}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ captures the constant influence of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ on turnover under the fixed $[\\text{Na}^{+}]$.\n\nBefore adding galactose ($[Gal]=0$), the rate is\n$$\nv_{0}=\\alpha V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}}{1+\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}}.\n$$\nImmediately after adding a high $[Gal]$, the numerator is unchanged but the denominator increases by $\\frac{[Gal]}{K_{Gal}}$, so\n$$\nv_{\\text{with Gal}}=\\alpha V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}}{1+\\frac{[G^{*}]}{K_{G}}+\\frac{[Gal]}{K_{Gal}}}<v_{0}.\n$$\nEquivalently, in Michaelis-Menten form for competitive inhibition by galactose,\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{\\max}[G^{*}]}{K_{m,G}\\left(1+\\frac{[Gal]}{K_{i,Gal}}\\right)+[G^{*}]},\n$$\nso at fixed low $[G^{*}]$ an increase in $[Gal]$ increases the apparent $K_{m}$ and decreases $v$.\n\nTherefore, the immediate effect of adding galactose is a decrease in the initial rate of radiolabeled glucose uptake due to competition for the same binding site. There is no mechanistic basis for allosteric activation (ruling out an increase), the two sugars are not transported independently on separate sites, direction does not reverse because the $\\text{Na}^{+}$ electrochemical gradient is unchanged, and transport does not stop completely because glucose can still bind and be transported with some probability even in the presence of competitor.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the competitive decrease in rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2337731"}, {"introduction": "The direction of transport for an electrogenic exchanger is not fixed; it depends on a delicate balance between chemical gradients and the electrical membrane potential.
