The researcher prepares sealed, artificial membrane vesicles (liposomes) with purified SERCA protein correctly embedded in their membranes. The experiment is initiated by adding the following components to the buffer solution surrounding the vesicles:\n1. A high concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n2. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in which the terminal (gamma) phosphate group is radioactively labeled with $^{32}P$. This molecule is denoted as $[\\gamma-^{32}P]ATP$.\n\nThe reaction is allowed to proceed for a very short time (on the order of milliseconds) before it is quenched by the addition of a strong acid.

The defining mechanistic steps relevant to this experiment are as follows.\n\n1. Substrate binding: In the presence of high cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ and $ATP$, SERCA binds $Ca^{2+}$ on its cytoplasmic side together with $ATP$. This forms a ternary complex $E\\cdot Ca^{2+}\\cdot ATP$.\n2.

This step occurs early in the catalytic cycle, before ion release and before hydrolysis to $P_{i}$.\n3. Rapid acid quench trapping: Addition of strong acid within milliseconds halts the reaction, trapping the $E\\text{-}^{32}P$ intermediate by preventing further turnover and hydrolysis. Noncovalently bound nucleotides (e.g., unreacted $[\\gamma\\text{-}^{32}P]ATP$) are not preserved as enzyme-bound species through denaturation and electrophoresis.\n4.

Therefore, radioactivity localizes to the SERCA band due to the $E\\text{-}^{32}P$ intermediate.\n5. Rejection of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because covalent autophosphorylation occurs early; completion of the full transport cycle is not required to observe a net chemical change on the enzyme.\n- B is incorrect for early time points: release of $^{32}P_{i}$ into the vesicle lumen requires prior formation and subsequent hydrolysis of $E\\text{-}^{32}P$, which has not yet occurred on the millisecond timescale being quenched here.\n- D is incorrect because formation of $E\\text{-}^{32}P$ consumes $ATP$ and releases $ADP$; $ADP$ is not required as an added reactant to form the phosphoenzyme.\n- E is incorrect because any noncovalently associated $[\\gamma\\text{-}^{32}P]ATP$ would be lost during denaturation and electrophoresis; only covalent $^{32}P$ on SERCA yields a localized radioactive band.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is that the SERCA band is radioactive, indicating covalent phosphorylation by the $\\gamma$-phosphate of $ATP$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2064269"}]}
