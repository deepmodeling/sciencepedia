This crucial voltage isn't a random value; it's a carefully balanced state determined by the differential permeability of the cell membrane to various ions. This practice invites you to apply the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, a cornerstone of cell biology, to calculate the resting potential under a hypothetical scenario where ion channel selectivity is altered. By working through this calculation [@problem_id:2347744], you will gain a concrete understanding of how ion permeabilities and concentration gradients collaboratively establish a neuron's baseline electrical state.", "problem": "A neurobiologist is studying a hypothetical neuron in a physiological saline solution. The intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations are maintained as follows:\n- Potassium ([$K^+$]): 140 mM inside, 5 mM outside\n- Sodium ([$Na^+$]): 15 mM inside, 145 mM outside\n- Chloride ([$Cl^-$]): 10 mM inside, 110 mM outside\n\nUnder normal resting conditions, the relative permeabilities of the neuronal membrane to these ions are in the ratio $P_K : P_{Na} : P_{Cl} = 1 : 0.04 : 0.45$.\n\nThe neurobiologist then introduces a genetic mutation that alters the structure of the resting (leak) potassium channels. This mutation widens the channel's selectivity filter, making it less specific. As a result of this change across the entire population of channels in the membrane, the overall membrane permeability to sodium ($P_{Na}$) increases to ten times its original resting value, while the overall membrane permeability to potassium ($P_K$) decreases to 80% of its original resting value. The permeability to chloride ($P_{Cl}$) is unaffected.\n\nAssume the analysis is conducted at a temperature where the term $(RT/F)$ in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation allows for a simplification, such that the membrane potential $V_m$ in millivolts (mV) can be calculated using base-10 logarithm: $V_m = 61.5 \\log_{10}(\\text{ion ratio})$.\n\nCalculate the new resting membrane potential of the neuron after the mutation has taken effect.

After mutation, $P_{Na}$ increases tenfold and $P_{K}$ decreases to $0.8$ of its original value, while $P_{Cl}$ is unchanged.

Neurons utilize two primary forms of signals: graded potentials and action potentials, which are generated by ligand-gated and voltage-gated channels, respectively. This exercise [@problem_id:2347775] presents a classic thought experiment where voltage-gated channels are pharmacologically blocked, allowing you to isolate and observe the behavior of ligand-gated channels. This will help you clearly distinguish the local, amplitude-variable nature of graded potentials from the all-or-nothing propagation of an action potential.", "problem": "A neurobiologist is conducting an experiment on a cultured mammalian neuron. The neuron has a stable resting membrane potential ($V_{rest}$) of -70 mV. The Nernst equilibrium potentials for the primary ions involved are as follows: $E_{Na^+} = +60$ mV, $E_{K^+} = -90$ mV, and $E_{Cl^-} = -65$ mV.\n\nTo isolate the activity of certain channels, the neuron is bathed in a solution containing a cocktail of two toxins: Tetrodotoxin (TTX), which is a potent and specific blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, and Tetraethylammonium (TEA), a specific blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels. These toxins have no effect on ligand-gated ion channels or the activity of the $Na^+/K^+$ pump, which maintains the resting potential.\n\nAfter the toxins have taken full effect, a small, controlled amount of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is applied directly to a single point on a dendrite of the neuron. This application of glutamate causes the opening of ligand-gated ion channels that are exclusively permeable to sodium ($Na^+$) ions.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected change in membrane potential that would be measured with an electrode placed at the precise location where the glutamate was applied?\n\nA. An all-or-nothing action potential is generated, and the membrane potential rapidly depolarizes to a peak near +60 mV before repolarizing.\n\nB. No change in membrane potential occurs because the blockage of voltage-gated channels prevents any significant flow of ions across the membrane.\n\nC. A localized hyperpolarization occurs, causing the membrane potential to become more negative than the resting potential of -70 mV.\n\nD. A localized depolarization occurs, and the magnitude of this depolarization is proportional to the concentration of glutamate applied.\n\nE. The membrane potential depolarizes and becomes fixed at the chloride equilibrium potential ($E_{Cl^-}$) of -65 mV.", "solution": "The neuron at rest satisfies $V_{rest}$ determined by passive leak and the $Na^+/K^+$ pump; with toxins present, voltage-gated conductances are eliminated, so $g_{Na}^{VG}=0$ and $g_{K}^{VG}=0$, while leak and pump persist. Application of glutamate opens ligand-gated channels exclusively permeable to $Na^+$ at a dendritic locus, introducing a local conductance $g_{Na}^{LGIC} > 0$ with reversal potential $E_{Na^+}$.\n\nAt the site of application, the passive membrane equation is\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt}=-g_{L}\\left(V-E_{L}\\right)-g_{Na}^{LGIC}\\left(V-E_{Na^{+}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{L}$ and $E_{L}$ are the leak conductance and leak reversal potential, respectively, and $C_{m}$ is membrane capacitance per unit area. Immediately upon opening, at $V=V_{rest}$, the ligand-gated sodium current is\n$$\nI_{Na}^{LGIC}=g_{Na}^{LGIC}\\left(V_{rest}-E_{Na^{+}}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $V_{rest}  E_{Na^+}$, we have $V_{rest}-E_{Na^+}  0$, so $I_{Na}^{LGIC}  0$, corresponding to inward positive current that depolarizes the membrane (increases $V$ toward $E_{Na^+}$).\n\nThe steady-state voltage at that locus with glutamate present follows by setting $\\frac{dV}{dt}=0$:\n$$\nV_{\\infty}=\\frac{g_{L}E_{L}+g_{Na}^{LGIC}E_{Na^{+}}}{g_{L}+g_{Na}^{LGIC}}.\n$$\nSince typically $E_{L} \\approx V_{rest}$ and $E_{Na^+}$ is much more positive than $V_{rest}$, it follows that $V_{\\infty} > V_{rest}$. Moreover, the depolarization amplitude $\\Delta V_{\\infty} = V_{\\infty} - V_{rest}$ increases monotonically with $g_{Na}^{LGIC}$. For small $g_{Na}^{LGIC}$ relative to $g_{L}$, a linear approximation gives\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\infty}\\approx \\frac{g_{Na}^{LGIC}}{g_{L}}\\left(E_{Na^{+}}-V_{rest}\\right),\n$$\nwhich is proportional to $g_{Na}^{LGIC}$, and, for pharmacologically standard conditions, $g_{Na}^{LGIC}$ is proportional to the local glutamate concentration and receptor open probability. Thus the depolarization is graded in magnitude with the amount of glutamate.\n\nNo all-or-nothing action potential can be generated because the regenerative mechanism requires voltage-gated sodium channels, which are blocked by tetrodotoxin, so there is no rapid spike to a peak near $E_{Na^+}$. The presence of tetraethylammonium blocking voltage-gated potassium channels further ensures the absence of voltage-gated repolarization currents but does not affect the conclusion that a spike will not occur without voltage-gated sodium currents.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is false: with $g_{Na}^{VG}=0$, there is no action potential.\n- Option B is false: ligand-gated channels permit current independent of voltage-gated channel function, so a change in membrane potential occurs.\n- Option C is false: opening $Na^+$-selective channels depolarizes toward $E_{Na^+}$, not hyperpolarizes.\n- Option E is false: no chloride conductance is being opened; the local reversal for the activated conductance is $E_{Na^+}$, not $E_{Cl^-}$.\n\nThe correct description is a localized, graded depolarization whose magnitude scales with the amount of glutamate applied.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2347775"}, {"introduction": "The action potential is a rapid, dramatic event, but its precise shape and brief duration are just as important as its occurrence. A key feature responsible for the swift repolarization of a neuron is the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. In this problem [@problem_id:2347760], we explore the critical consequences of removing this inactivation mechanism. This scenario reveals why inactivation is not merely a \"switch-off\" mechanism but an essential kinetic property that prevents runaway depolarization and allows for the proper functioning of a neuron.", "problem": "In neurobiology, the precise functioning of ion channels is critical for generating and propagating action potentials. A typical neuron at rest maintains a negative membrane potential. When a stimulus raises the membrane potential to a certain threshold, voltage-gated sodium (Na$^{+}$) channels rapidly open, allowing an influx of Na$^{+}$ ions that causes a sharp depolarization of the membrane. Shortly after opening, these Na$^{+}$ channels enter a non-conductive, inactivated state, which, in conjunction with the opening of voltage-gated potassium (K$^{+}$) channels, allows the membrane to repolarize by an efflux of K$^{+}$ ions.\n\nConsider a hypothetical neurotoxin, Scorpoxin-V, which selectively binds to the voltage-gated Na$^{+}$ channels of a neuron. The toxin's unique mechanism of action is to prevent the inactivation gate of the Na$^{+}$ channel from closing after it has been opened by a depolarizing stimulus. The channel can still close from its open state when the membrane repolarizes, but it cannot enter the inactivated state. Assume all other cellular components, including the voltage-gated K$^{+}$ channels and the $Na^+-K^+$ pump, function normally.\n\nIf a neuron is exposed to Scorpoxin-V and an action potential is successfully initiated by a suprathreshold stimulus, what is the most direct and immediate consequence for the shape and duration of that action potential?\n\nA. The neuron fails to reach the threshold for an action potential.\n\nB. The repolarization phase of the action potential is significantly shortened, causing the neuron to fire at a much higher frequency.\n\nC. The amplitude of the action potential is significantly reduced because fewer Na$^{+}$ ions can enter the cell.\n\nD. The membrane potential remains at a prolonged depolarized plateau, delaying or preventing the repolarization phase.\n\nE. The after-hyperpolarization phase becomes much deeper and longer-lasting due to excessive K$^{+}$ efflux.", "solution": "We model the excitable membrane with the Hodgkin–Huxley formalism. The membrane voltage $V$ obeys\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\left(I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right),\n$$\nwith ionic currents\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} h \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{L}} = g_{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right).\n$$\nIn a normal neuron, a suprathreshold depolarization rapidly increases the activation variable $m$ toward large values (opening Na$^{+}$ channels), while the inactivation variable $h$ then decreases (closing via inactivation), so that $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ shuts off quickly. The delayed activation of $n$ increases $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$, producing repolarization and, while $n$ remains elevated and $h$ remains low, an after-hyperpolarization.\n\nUnder Scorpoxin-V, the inactivation gate cannot close once opened. In Hodgkin–Huxley terms, during the action potential $h$ is prevented from decreasing, so we can treat $h \\approx 1$ throughout the depolarized phase. The channels can still deactivate upon repolarization, so $m$ retains its usual voltage dependence: it is large at depolarized $V$ and decreases only when $V$ repolarizes.\n\nImmediately after the upstroke, with $m$ large and $h \\approx 1$, the Na$^{+}$ current\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\approx g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right)\n$$\nremains strongly inward at depolarized $V$. At the same time, the delayed rectifier K$^{+}$ current\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n$$\ngrows outward. Because $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ does not inactivate, repolarization cannot proceed as in the normal case; instead, the membrane approaches a quasi-steady depolarized level where the net current vanishes:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\ng_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right) + g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right) + g_{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nSince $m$ is kept high by the depolarized $V$, the inward Na$^{+}$ current persists, opposing repolarization and producing a prolonged depolarized plateau. Only when $V$ is finally driven sufficiently negative (by accumulating K$^{+}$ activation and leak) will $m$ deactivate, allowing $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to fall and repolarization to complete. Thus, the most direct and immediate effect on the action potential’s shape is a delayed or prevented repolarization with a prolonged depolarized plateau.\n\nThis rules out the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because a suprathreshold stimulus initiates the action potential by assumption.\n- B is incorrect; repolarization is prolonged, not shortened, and firing frequency would decrease, not increase.\n- C is incorrect; Na$^{+}$ influx is sustained rather than reduced during the spike, so amplitude is not directly decreased by fewer Na$^{+}$ entries.\n- E is incorrect; persistent inward Na$^{+}$ current opposes, rather than deepens, the after-hyperpolarization.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is a prolonged depolarized plateau delaying or preventing repolarization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2347760"}]}
