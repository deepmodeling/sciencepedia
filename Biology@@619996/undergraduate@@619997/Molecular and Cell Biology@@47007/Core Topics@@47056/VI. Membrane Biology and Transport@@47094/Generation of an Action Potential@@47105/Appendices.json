An action potential is initiated if and only if the neuron's membrane potential depolarizes to a value equal to or greater (less negative) than its threshold potential. We must calculate the final membrane potential in each scenario and compare it to the given threshold potential.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Resting membrane potential, $V_{\\text{rest}} = -70$ mV\n- Threshold potential, $V_{\\text{th}} = -55$ mV\n- Potential change from one Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), $\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP}} = +10$ mV\n- Potential change from one Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP), $\\Delta V_{\\text{IPSP}} = -5$ mV\n\n**Analysis of Scenario A:**\nIn this scenario, the neuron receives two EPSPs simultaneously.

This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2317244"}, {"introduction": "Once initiated, the action potential's characteristic shape is not accidental; it is sculpted by the precise opening and closing of different ion channels. This thought experiment invites you to explore the role of a key component: the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channel. By predicting the effects of a hypothetical toxin that alters this gate's function, you will gain a deeper understanding of how the duration of the action potential and the refractory period are controlled at a molecular level [@problem_id:2317200].", "problem": "In a neurobiology laboratory, researchers are studying a novel polypeptide toxin, \"chronotoxin,\" isolated from a marine snail. When applied to a cultured neuron, chronotoxin is found to selectively bind to voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channels. Its mechanism of action is highly specific: it does not affect the voltage sensitivity of the channel's activation gate, but it significantly slows down the conformational change that leads to the closing of the channel's inactivation gate. Assuming all other cellular properties, including the resting membrane potential and the function of voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels, remain unchanged, how would the presence of chronotoxin alter the shape and characteristics of a single action potential generated by the neuron?\n\nA. The threshold potential required to trigger an action potential would become more negative (i.e., less depolarization is needed).\n\nB. The repolarization phase would become significantly faster, leading to a shorter action potential duration.\n\nC. The peak of the action potential would be prolonged, and the absolute refractory period would be lengthened.\n\nD. The after-hyperpolarization (undershoot) phase would become deeper and last longer.\n\nE. The amplitude of the action potential would decrease because fewer sodium channels would be available to open.", "solution": "To determine the effect of chronotoxin, we must first review the roles of the voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channel's gates during a normal action potential.\n\n1.  **Resting State:** The neuron is at its resting membrane potential. The voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channel's activation gate is closed, and its inactivation gate is open.\n\n2.  **Depolarization:** A stimulus depolarizes the membrane to the threshold potential. This causes the voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channel's activation gate to rapidly open. $Na^{+}$ ions rush into the cell, causing the membrane potential to become positive.\n\n3.  **Peak and Repolarization:** As the membrane potential becomes highly positive, two key events occur nearly simultaneously: the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channel closes, and the voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels open. The closing of the $Na^{+}$ inactivation gate stops the influx of $Na^{+}$. The opening of the $K^{+}$ channels allows $K^{+}$ to flow out of the cell, causing the membrane potential to fall back towards the resting potential (repolarization).\n\n4.  **Absolute Refractory Period:** This is the period during which a second action potential cannot be initiated, regardless of the stimulus strength. This state is defined by the fact that the inactivation gates of the voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels are closed and cannot be reopened until the membrane potential repolarizes sufficiently to \"reset\" them to their open-but-ready state.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of chronotoxin, which slows the closing of the inactivation gate.\n\n-   **Effect on Depolarization:** The activation gates open normally at the threshold. However, as the membrane depolarizes, the inactivation gates, which are supposed to close and terminate the $Na^{+}$ influx, close more slowly than usual. This means that for any given moment during the rising phase and peak, $Na^{+}$ influx continues for a longer duration than it would in a normal neuron. This continued influx of positive charge will cause the depolarization phase to last longer, resulting in a broadened or prolonged peak of the action potential.\n\n-   **Effect on Repolarization:** Repolarization is driven primarily by the efflux of $K^{+}$ through voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels. The toxin does not affect these channels. However, because the influx of $Na^{+}$ is prolonged, it will work against the repolarizing effect of the $K^{+}$ efflux. This delays the onset of repolarization and further contributes to a wider action potential. The question asks about the overall shape; the most direct effect is protracting the depolarized state.\n\n-   **Effect on the Absolute Refractory Period:** The absolute refractory period is determined by the status of the $Na^{+}$ channel inactivation gates. A new action potential cannot fire until these gates have reset (re-opened) after repolarization. Since chronotoxin slows the closing of the inactivation gate, the entire cycle of this gate (from open to inactivated to reset) is slowed down. The gate remains in the inactivated state for a longer period before it can reset. Therefore, the absolute refractory period, the time during which the neuron is unresponsive, is lengthened.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n-   A. The threshold potential is determined by the opening of the activation gate, which is explicitly stated to be unaffected. This option is incorrect.\n-   B. The repolarization phase would be delayed or slowed, not faster, because the prolonged $Na^{+}$ influx opposes the repolarizing $K^{+}$ efflux. This would lead to a longer, not shorter, action potential duration. This option is incorrect.\n-   C. As determined above, the prolonged $Na^{+}$ influx will prolong the peak of the action potential. The slowed kinetics of the inactivation gate directly lead to a longer time required for the channel to reset, thus lengthening the absolute refractory period. This option is correct.\n-   D. The after-hyperpolarization phase is primarily caused by voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels being slow to close. The toxin does not directly affect these channels. While the shape alteration might have minor secondary effects, this is not the primary and most significant change. This option is incorrect.\n-   E. The toxin does not prevent channels from opening; it prolongs the time they are open. Therefore, the amplitude would likely increase or stay the same (approaching the $Na^{+}$ equilibrium potential), but it would certainly not decrease due to fewer available channels. This option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the presence of chronotoxin will result in a prolonged action potential peak and a lengthened absolute refractory period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2317200"}, {"introduction": "The action potential involves a dramatic voltage swing of about $100$ mV, suggesting a massive flood of ions across the membrane.
