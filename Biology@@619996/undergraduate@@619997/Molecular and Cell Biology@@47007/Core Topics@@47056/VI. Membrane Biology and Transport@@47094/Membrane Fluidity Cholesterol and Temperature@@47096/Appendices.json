IV > II > III > I", "solution": "Key principles for membrane fluidity at physiological temperature:\n- Saturated, long fatty acyl chains pack tightly via van der Waals interactions, decreasing fluidity.\n- A *cis* double bond introduces a kink that disrupts packing, increases free volume, lowers the melting temperature, and increases fluidity relative to saturated chains.\n- A *trans* double bond produces a relatively straight chain that packs more like a saturated chain; thus, a *trans*-unsaturated tail confers much less fluidity than a *cis*-unsaturated tail and is closer to saturated in its packing behavior.\n- Cholesterol acts as a fluidity buffer: above the phase transition temperature of the lipid, it tends to order acyl chains and reduce fluidity; below the transition temperature, it disrupts packing and increases fluidity. At physiological temperature for typical phospholipids with *cis*-unsaturated tails, cholesterol generally decreases fluidity relative to the cholesterol-free membrane.\n\nApply these principles:\n- Liposome I (two long saturated tails) packs most tightly, thus has the lowest fluidity.\n- Liposome II (one saturated, one cis-unsaturated tail) has a pronounced kink disrupting packing, giving the highest fluidity among the cholesterol-free liposomes described.\n- Liposome III (one saturated, one *trans*-unsaturated tail) is comparatively straight and packs more like saturated tails; therefore, it is less fluid than Liposome II but generally more fluid than Liposome I.\n- Liposome IV (the Liposome II lipid with cholesterol at a mole fraction of 0.20) will have reduced fluidity relative to Liposome II at physiological temperature due to cholesterol’s ordering effect. However, because 0.80 of the lipids still contain a *cis* kink, it remains more fluid than the *trans*-rich Liposome III.\n\nTherefore, from most to least fluid: Liposome II, then Liposome IV, then Liposome III, then Liposome I.

This problem presents a scenario of a bacterium facing simultaneous environmental stresses—low temperature and high acidity—both of which decrease membrane fluidity. By working through this hypothetical case of *homeoviscous adaptation*, you will learn to predict the specific changes in lipid composition a cell must make to counteract these threats and maintain its essential functions [@problem_id:2322682].", "problem": "A hypothetical extremophilic bacterium, *Cryoacidiphilus communis*, is optimally adapted to thrive in an environment at a temperature of $37\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and a neutral pH of 7.0. Its plasma membrane is primarily composed of two types of phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and also contains hopanoids, which are bacterial analogues of cholesterol. The phosphate moiety of the phosphatidylglycerol (PG) headgroup has a pKa of approximately 2.5.

Decrease the proportion of both phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine in favor of phospholipids with uncharged headgroups, and increase the proportion of long-chain saturated fatty acids.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires analyzing the combined effects of low temperature and low pH on the bacterial cell membrane and determining the appropriate compensatory changes to maintain fluidity, a principle known as homeoviscous adaptation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the impact of each environmental stress individually.\n\n1.  **Effect of Low Temperature:** The cell is moved from $37\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ to $10\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. A decrease in temperature reduces the thermal energy of the phospholipid molecules in the membrane. This reduction in kinetic energy allows the hydrophobic fatty acid tails to pack together more tightly and in a more ordered fashion due to increased van der Waals interactions. This leads to a significant decrease in membrane fluidity, pushing the membrane towards a non-functional, rigid gel-like state.\n\n2.  **Effect of Low pH:** The cell is moved from a neutral pH of 7.0 to an acidic pH of 3.0. The problem states that the phosphate group on the head of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) has a pKa of 2.5. At the initial pH of 7.0 (which is much greater than the pKa), the vast majority of these phosphate groups are deprotonated, carrying a negative charge. This charge creates electrostatic repulsion between adjacent PG molecules, preventing them from packing too closely and thereby contributing to membrane fluidity.\n\n    When the pH drops to 3.0, it becomes very close to the pKa of the PG headgroup. According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, $\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log_{10}([\\text{A}^{-}]/[\\text{HA}])$, a significant fraction of the PG headgroups will become protonated and thus electrically neutral. This neutralizes the electrostatic repulsion that was keeping them apart. The loss of this repulsive force allows the phospholipid molecules to pack more tightly together, which, similar to the effect of low temperature, causes a decrease in membrane fluidity.\n\n**Combined Effect and Required Adaptation:**\n\nThe bacterium faces a synergistic \"double blow\" to its membrane fluidity. Both the cold temperature and the acidic environment independently cause the membrane to become more rigid. To survive, the cell must counteract this and *increase* its membrane fluidity. Let's evaluate the available mechanisms.\n\n*   **Fatty Acid Saturation:** The presence of *cis*-double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids introduces kinks into the hydrocarbon tails. These kinks disrupt the orderly packing of the tails, increasing the distance between phospholipids and thus increasing membrane fluidity. To counteract the rigidifying effects, the cell must **increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids**.\n\n*   **Fatty Acid Chain Length:** Shorter fatty acid tails have less surface area for van der Waals interactions with neighboring tails. Weaker interactions lead to less tight packing and therefore greater membrane fluidity. To counteract the rigidifying effects, the cell must **decrease the average fatty acid chain length**.\n\n*   **Hopanoid Concentration:** Hopanoids, like cholesterol in eukaryotes, act as fluidity buffers. At low temperatures, their rigid, planar steroid rings intercalate between the fatty acid tails. This action disrupts the formation of a highly ordered, crystalline gel phase, thereby **preventing the membrane from becoming too rigid**. In a situation where the membrane is dangerously close to solidifying, increasing the hopanoid concentration is an effective way to maintain a degree of fluidity.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A. Increase the proportion of long-chain saturated fatty acids and decrease the hopanoid concentration.** This is the opposite of the required adaptation. Both changes would further decrease membrane fluidity, which would be lethal.\n*   **B. Decrease the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and increase the average fatty acid chain length.** Both of these changes would decrease membrane fluidity, exacerbating the problem.\n*   **C. Increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, decrease the average fatty acid chain length, and increase the hopanoid concentration.** This option correctly identifies all three adaptive mechanisms that would work together to increase membrane fluidity, effectively counteracting the combined stress of cold and acid. This is the most comprehensive and effective response.\n*   **D. Increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, but also increase the average fatty acid chain length and decrease the hopanoid concentration.** This option presents conflicting changes. While increasing unsaturation is correct, increasing chain length and decreasing hopanoids would both decrease fluidity, making this strategy far less effective than C.\n*   **E. Decrease the proportion of both phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine in favor of phospholipids with uncharged headgroups, and increase the proportion of long-chain saturated fatty acids.** Changing the fundamental types of phospholipids is a long-term evolutionary change, not a rapid adaptation. Furthermore, increasing long-chain saturated fatty acids is the incorrect response to the stress.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a correct and comprehensive set of rapid adaptations is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322682"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp how factors like temperature and cholesterol regulate membrane properties, we must move from qualitative concepts to quantitative measurement.
