For a substance to pass through the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, it must be sufficiently lipid-soluble, yet its journey is simultaneously hindered by its physical size.

The transport of these anesthetics across the BBB occurs primarily via simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cells.\n\nFor a molecule crossing a lipid membrane via simple diffusion, the rate of transport (flux) for a given concentration gradient is governed by its physicochemical properties. Based on biophysical models, this flux is known to be directly proportional to the molecule's lipid/water partition coefficient, $K$, and inversely proportional to its effective molecular radius, $r$. The partition coefficient $K$ is a measure of a molecule's hydrophobicity; a higher value indicates greater solubility in lipids.\n\nAnesthesin-A is the current standard, with an effective molecular radius of $r_A$ and a partition coefficient of $K_A$. The newly synthesized Anesthesin-B is smaller but more polar. Its effective molecular radius, $r_B$, is 80% of Anesthesin-A's radius. Due to its increased polarity, its partition coefficient, $K_B$, is only 60% of Anesthesin-A's coefficient.\n\nAssuming that identical initial concentration gradients are established for both anesthetics across the BBB, calculate the ratio of the initial diffusion flux of Anesthesin-B to that of Anesthesin-A.
