The cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, causing water to flow into the cell and its volume to increase. The total initial rate of water influx, which is proportional to the rate of volume change, is measured to be $J_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nIt is known that water transport across this cell's membrane occurs through two parallel pathways:\n1.  Simple diffusion directly across the lipid bilayer, with a rate of $J_{\\text{diff}}$.\n2.

In this model, the following relationships hold:\n1. The channel's permeability to water, $P_f$, is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, $R$, of the ar/R constriction: $P_f \\propto R^4$. This is a simplification based on principles of fluid dynamics for narrow channels.\n2. The channel's permeability to a solute of effective radius $r_s$, denoted $P_s$, is proportional to the square of the effective radius available for the solute's center of mass to pass, accounting for steric exclusion: $P_s \\propto (R - r_s)^2$. This is valid only for $R > r_s$; if $R \\le r_s$, the permeability $P_s$ is zero.\n\nThe wild-type (WT) version of this model channel has an ar/R constriction radius of $R_{\\text{WT}} = 2.50$ angstroms.
