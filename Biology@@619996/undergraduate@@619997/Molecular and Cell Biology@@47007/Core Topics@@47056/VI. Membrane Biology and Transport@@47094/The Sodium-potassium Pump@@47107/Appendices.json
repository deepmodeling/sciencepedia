It plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients for sodium and potassium ions, which are essential for nerve signaling, nutrient transport, and cellular volume regulation. For every molecule of ATP it hydrolyzes, the pump actively transports three sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) out of the cell and brings two potassium ions ($K^{+}$) into the cell.\n\nConsider a single Na+/K+ pump operating on the membrane of a neuron.
