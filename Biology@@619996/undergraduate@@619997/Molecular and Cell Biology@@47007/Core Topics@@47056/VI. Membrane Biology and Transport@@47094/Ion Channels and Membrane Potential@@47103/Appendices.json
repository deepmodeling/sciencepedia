The effective conductance driving repolarization is therefore much smaller, increasing the effective time constant $\\tau\\approx C_{m}/g_{\\text{eff}}$ and substantially prolonging the repolarization phase (action potential broadening). This directly supports option C.\n\nAfterhyperpolarization (undershoot). In control, the undershoot arises because $g_{\\text{K}}$ remains elevated while $E_{\\text{K}}$ is more negative than the resting potential, pulling $V$ below rest. With $g_{\\text{K}} n^{4}=0$, there is no excess $K^{+}$ conductance to drive an undershoot; if anything, the undershoot is diminished or absent, not more pronounced.
