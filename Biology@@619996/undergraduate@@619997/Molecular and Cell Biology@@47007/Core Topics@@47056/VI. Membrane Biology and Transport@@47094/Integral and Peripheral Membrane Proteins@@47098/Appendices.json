After determining the primary amino-acid sequence of Xenofascin, the researcher's first step is to input this sequence into a computational tool that generates a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot. The plot displays the average hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues in a sliding window along the entire length of the polypeptide chain. What is the primary and most immediate question the researcher is trying to answer by performing this specific analysis?\n\nA. To determine the protein's precise three-dimensional folded conformation in an aqueous solution.\n\nB. To predict potential transmembrane domains, suggesting whether the protein is an integral membrane protein.\n\nC. To calculate the protein's isoelectric point (pI) and overall net charge at physiological pH.\n\nD. To identify the specific amino acid residues that will form the active site for potential enzymatic function.\n\nE. To locate the positions of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation sites.", "solution": "The Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot assigns each amino acid a hydropathy index and computes a sliding-window average along the primary sequence to reveal contiguous stretches of high hydrophobicity. Formally, if the primary sequence is $a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}$ and each residue $a_{i}$ has a hydropathy value $h(a_{i})$, then for a window of width $w$ centered at position $i$, the averaged hydropathy can be written as\n$$\nH_{i}=\\frac{1}{w}\\sum_{j=i-(w-1)/2}^{i+(w-1)/2} h(a_{j}),\n$$\nwith appropriate handling at the sequence ends. The physical principle is that integral membrane proteins often contain transmembrane $\\alpha$ helices that are predominantly hydrophobic over a contiguous stretch of residues, typically long enough to span the lipid bilayer. Thus, detecting a sustained region where $H_{i}$ remains high over a contiguous segment is diagnostic for potential transmembrane domains.\n\nApplying this reasoning to each option:\n- Option A is incorrect because a hydropathy plot does not resolve precise three-dimensional structure; it only reports local hydrophobicity trends along the sequence.\n- Option B is correct because the primary and most immediate goal of generating a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot is to identify long hydrophobic segments that likely correspond to transmembrane domains, thereby suggesting whether the protein is an integral membrane protein.\n- Option C is incorrect because the isoelectric point and net charge require residue pKa and charge-state information, not hydropathy averaging.\n- Option D is incorrect because active site identification requires structural or motif information; hydropathy alone cannot pinpoint specific catalytic residues.\n- Option E is incorrect because post-translational modification sites are typically predicted from sequence motifs and structural context, not from hydropathy profiles.\n\nTherefore, the analysis primarily addresses whether the protein contains transmembrane domains, indicating it may be an integral membrane protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2319801"}, {"introduction": "While sequence analysis provides valuable hypotheses, determining the exact topology of a membrane protein requires clever experimental work. This practice challenges you to think like a molecular detective, integrating data from both computational predictions and a real-world biochemical assay. Successfully solving this puzzle requires moving beyond simple models to understand more complex structural motifs, like re-entrant loops, that cells use to anchor proteins in the membrane [@problem_id:2319759].", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the topology of a newly discovered protein, \"Adhesin-X,\" found in the plasma membrane of a human cell line. A computational hydropathy analysis of Adhesin-X's primary amino acid sequence reveals two distinct and strongly hydrophobic regions, H1 (residues 50-70) and H2 (residues 180-200). Each region is approximately 20 amino acids long, a length sufficient to form an alpha-helical transmembrane domain.\n\nTo experimentally determine the protein's orientation, a protease protection assay is conducted on intact, living cells that express Adhesin-X. These cells are treated with a membrane-impermeable protease, which can only cleave polypeptide chains exposed to the extracellular environment. After the treatment, the cells are lysed, and the total protein content is separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Adhesin-X is then detected using a Western blot with a highly specific antibody that binds to its C-terminus.\n\nThe Western blot analysis reveals that the Adhesin-X protein from the protease-treated cells migrates to the exact same position on the gel as Adhesin-X from untreated control cells, indicating no change in its apparent molecular weight. Separate experiments using fluorescent tagging have independently confirmed that both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of Adhesin-X are located in the cytosol.\n\nGiven the combined results from the hydropathy plot and the protease protection assay, which of the following structural models for Adhesin-X's topology within the plasma membrane is the most plausible?\n\nA. Adhesin-X is a classic two-pass transmembrane protein. Both its N- and C-termini are located in the cytosol, while the H1 and H2 segments form transmembrane helices connected by an extracellular loop.\n\nB. Adhesin-X is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with the extracellular face of the plasma membrane, and it is coincidentally resistant to the specific protease used.\n\nC. Adhesin-X is a single-pass transmembrane protein anchored by the H1 segment, with its N-terminus in the cytosol and its C-terminus located in the extracellular space. The H2 segment is part of the large extracellular domain.\n\nD. Adhesin-X is an integral membrane protein where both hydrophobic segments, H1 and H2, form \"re-entrant loops.\" Each loop inserts into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and exits on the same side, such that the N-terminus, the C-terminus, and the segment connecting H1 and H2 are all located in the cytosol.", "solution": "We begin by extracting the key experimental constraints and the expectations each imposes on the protein’s topology.\n\nFirst, the hydropathy analysis identifies two strongly hydrophobic segments, H1 and H2, each approximately 20 amino acids long. Such segments are sufficient to form alpha-helical transmembrane domains. Therefore, purely on sequence grounds, models in which these segments either fully span the bilayer or at least insert significantly into the hydrophobic core are favored over models lacking membrane insertion.\n\nSecond, the protease protection assay uses a membrane-impermeable protease applied to intact cells. The governing principle is that only polypeptide segments exposed to the extracellular environment are accessible to cleavage. If any loop or terminus is extracellular, it should be cleaved, leading to a change in the apparent molecular weight of the protein fragments visualized on SDS-PAGE. The Western blot probe recognizes the C-terminus; thus, any cleavage separating the C-terminus from the rest of the protein or truncating the protein would be expected to alter the migration of the detected band. Experimentally, the band from protease-treated cells is identical in position to that from untreated cells, implying that no extracellularly accessible segment was cleaved in a way that changes the fragment containing the C-terminus.\n\nThird, independent fluorescent tagging confirms that both the N-terminus and the C-terminus are in the cytosol. Therefore, any valid topology must place both termini cytosolic.\n\nNow we test each proposed model against these constraints:\n\nA. A classic two-pass transmembrane protein with both N- and C-termini in the cytosol requires that the loop between H1 and H2 be extracellular. By the protease protection principle, an extracellular loop should be susceptible to the membrane-impermeable protease, leading to cleavage and an expected change in the apparent molecular weight of the C-terminal fragment on the Western blot. Because no change is observed, this prediction contradicts the data. Therefore, A is not consistent with the protease result.\n\nB. A peripheral membrane protein on the extracellular face is inconsistent with the strong hydropathy showing two approximately 20-residue hydrophobic segments characteristic of integral membrane insertion. Moreover, peripheral extracellular association would render the polypeptide fully accessible to the protease, making the absence of any proteolytic effect unlikely. This contradicts both the hydropathy evidence and the protease result, as well as the finding that both termini are cytosolic. Therefore, B is not plausible.\n\nC. A single-pass protein with H1 as a transmembrane segment and the C-terminus extracellular directly contradicts the independent experimental result that the C-terminus is cytosolic. Therefore, C is excluded.\n\nD. An integral membrane protein with two hydrophobic re-entrant loops, where each hydrophobic segment dips into the membrane and returns to the cytosolic side, places the N-terminus, the inter-segment loop, and the C-terminus all in the cytosol. Under this topology, there is no polypeptide exposed to the extracellular milieu, so the membrane-impermeable protease has no substrate to cleave; consequently, the Western blot band detected via the C-terminus would be unchanged, exactly as observed. This model is also compatible with the hydropathy data (hydrophobic segments can form re-entrant loops) and the independent determination that both termini are cytosolic. Therefore, D is the only model that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.\n\nThus, the most plausible topology is the re-entrant loop model described in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2319759"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the structure of integral proteins, it is crucial to understand how peripheral proteins are recruited to the membrane to carry out their functions, such as signal transduction. This problem delves into the world of protein engineering, where knowledge of fundamental forces allows for the rational design of proteins with new behaviors. You will explore how electrostatic interactions between amino acids and charged lipid headgroups can be harnessed to control a protein's cellular localization, turning a temporary interaction into a permanent one [@problem_id:2319730].", "problem": "In a typical signal transduction pathway, a peripheral membrane protein called Signal Transducer Zeta (STZ) is recruited to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This recruitment is temporary and occurs only upon cell stimulation. The mechanism involves the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on an integral membrane receptor, creating a phosphotyrosine (pY) docking site. The Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain of STZ then specifically binds to this pY site, localizing STZ to the membrane to propagate the signal. The inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is known to have a net negative charge due to a high concentration of phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine.\n\nA researcher aims to create a mutant version of STZ that binds to the plasma membrane constitutively, that is, without the requirement for receptor phosphorylation. The mutation will be a single amino acid substitution within the pY-binding pocket of STZ's SH2 domain. Given your knowledge of amino acid properties and protein-membrane interactions, which of the following single point mutations is most likely to achieve this goal?\n\nA. R88D (Arginine at position 88 to Aspartate)\n\nB. G102R (Glycine at position 102 to Arginine)\n\nC. L95F (Leucine at position 95 to Phenylalanine)\n\nD. T110E (Threonine at position 110 to Glutamate)\n\nE. V75A (Valine at position 75 to Alanine)", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the mechanistic goal. The aim is to make STZ associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane constitutively, i.e., without dependence on a phosphotyrosine ligand. The inner leaflet carries a net negative charge due to anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides. Therefore, mutations that increase localized positive charge on the protein surface can promote electrostatic attraction to the membrane and drive constitutive membrane association.\n\nStep 2: Apply the relevant physical principle. Electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acid side chains (especially lysine and arginine, with arginine’s guanidinium group being particularly effective at binding phosphates) and negatively charged lipid headgroups promote membrane binding. Conversely, introducing negatively charged residues would disfavor interaction with the negatively charged membrane. Introducing only hydrophobic or small neutral changes in a single residue within a pocket not designed for membrane insertion is unlikely to create sufficient membrane affinity.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each proposed single-residue substitution with respect to its effect on net local charge and membrane affinity.\n- Option A (R88D): Replaces a positively charged arginine with a negatively charged aspartate. This reduces positive charge and introduces negative charge, which would weaken both potential electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids and canonical pY binding. This change is counter to the goal.\n- Option B (G102R): Replaces glycine with arginine, adding a positively charged, membrane-phosphate-binding side chain. This increases local positive charge in the SH2 pocket region, creating a basic patch capable of electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged inner leaflet, thereby promoting constitutive membrane association independent of receptor phosphorylation.\n- Option C (L95F): Substitutes a hydrophobic residue with another hydrophobic residue. This does not add positive charge and is unlikely, as a single change in a pocket residue, to generate sufficient hydrophobic membrane insertion. It does not accomplish constitutive electrostatic recruitment.\n- Option D (T110E): Introduces a negatively charged glutamate, which would be electrostatically repelled by the negatively charged inner leaflet and thus reduce membrane affinity.\n- Option E (V75A): A conservative hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic size reduction. This has minimal effect on charge and would not drive constitutive membrane association.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the optimal choice. The only mutation that directly increases positive charge to promote electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged inner leaflet is G102R, making Option B the most likely to achieve constitutive membrane binding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2319730"}]}
