This process is crucial for the uptake of specific macromolecules from the extracellular environment. The researcher treats the cells with GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analog of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). This analog can bind to GTP-binding proteins in the same way as GTP, but it cannot be catalytically broken down into Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate. After treatment, the researcher uses an electron microscope to observe the plasma membrane at sites where clathrin-coated pits are forming.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected observation regarding the final scission (pinching off) event that forms an endocytic vesicle under these experimental conditions?\n\nA. Clathrin and adaptor proteins will fail to assemble on the plasma membrane, preventing the formation of coated pits.\n\nB. Coated pits will form and invaginate, but the vesicles will fail to pinch off from the plasma membrane, remaining attached by a long stalk surrounded by the scission protein.\n\nC. Vesicles will form and pinch off normally, but they will be unable to shed their clathrin coats once inside the cytoplasm.\n\nD. Vesicles will form and pinch off normally, but they will be unable to fuse with early endosomes.\n\nE. The entire process of endocytosis will proceed without any noticeable disruption, as GTP hydrolysis is not an essential step for vesicle formation.", "solution": "We analyze receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane, focusing on clathrin-coated pit formation, invagination, and scission. The key mechanochemical steps and their nucleotide requirements are:\n- Coat assembly: Clathrin and adaptor proteins (e.g., AP2) assemble on the plasma membrane driven by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and cargo, not by GTP hydrolysis. Therefore, blocking GTP hydrolysis does not prevent coated pit formation.\n- Scission: The final pinching-off is mediated by dynamin, a large GTPase that assembles into helices around the neck of invaginated pits. GTP binding promotes dynamin assembly; GTP hydrolysis drives a conformational change that generates constriction and catalyzes membrane fission.\n- Uncoating: After internalization, uncoating of clathrin requires Hsc70 and auxilin and is powered by ATP hydrolysis, not GTP hydrolysis.\n- Post-budding fusion: Fusion with early endosomes involves Rab GTPases and their effectors, but this occurs after vesicle scission.\n\nGiven treatment with GTP-gamma-S, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP:\n1. Dynamin will bind the analog and assemble at the necks of coated pits because binding is intact.\n2. However, dynamin cannot hydrolyze GTP-gamma-S, so the conformational change required for membrane fission cannot occur.\n3. The immediate morphological outcome at coated pits is the accumulation of deeply invaginated coated pits that remain connected to the plasma membrane by elongated, narrow necks (stalks) encircled by dynamin rings/spirals.\n4. Clathrin and adaptor assembly is not blocked by the lack of GTP hydrolysis; uncoating is not reached because scission fails; fusion with endosomes is moot because vesicles do not detach.\n\nEvaluating the options against these principles:\n- A is incorrect because coat assembly does not require GTP hydrolysis.\n- B is correct because coated pits form and invaginate, but scission fails, leaving long dynamin-coated necks.\n- C is incorrect because uncoating depends on ATP, and vesicles do not pinch off anyway.\n- D is incorrect for the immediate observation at coated pits and because the primary block is at scission.\n- E is incorrect because dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis is essential for scission.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation is that coated pits form and invaginate but fail to pinch off, remaining attached via a long stalk surrounded by the scission protein (dynamin).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2313528"}, {"introduction": "While some internalization processes rely on small vesicles, others require significant mechanical force to engulf large targets like bacteria. This exercise [@problem_id:2313576] explores the process of phagocytosis, focusing on the powerhouse of cell shape change: the actin cytoskeleton. You will predict the outcome when a cell attempts to \"eat\" a pathogen without the ability to polymerize the actin filaments required for membrane extension and engulfment.", "problem": "A macrophage, a type of phagocytic immune cell, is cultured in a medium containing pathogenic bacteria. Under normal conditions, these macrophages actively perform phagocytosis to engulf and destroy the bacteria. A researcher adds an experimental drug to the culture that acts as a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization by preventing the assembly of globular actin (G-actin) into filamentous actin (F-actin). The drug rapidly enters the macrophages and exerts its effect.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence for a macrophage attempting to perform phagocytosis in the presence of this drug?\n\nA. The macrophage will be unable to recognize or bind to the surface of the bacteria.\n\nB. The macrophage will bind to the bacterium via its surface receptors, but the plasma membrane will fail to extend around the bacterium to engulf it.\n\nC. The macrophage will successfully engulf the bacterium, but the newly formed vesicle, called a phagosome, will be unable to acidify.\n\nD. The macrophage will form a small, stable pit on its surface where the bacterium is bound, but this pit will not progress to form a fully enclosed vesicle.\n\nE. The macrophage will engulf the bacterium completely, but the phagosome will fail to fuse with lysosomes, preventing the degradation of the bacterium.", "solution": "Phagocytosis proceeds through distinct steps: (1) recognition and binding of the particle via surface receptors such as Fc receptors or complement receptors, (2) actin-dependent remodeling of the plasma membrane to form pseudopods and a phagocytic cup that extends around the particle, (3) closure to form a phagosome, followed by (4) maturation steps including acidification and fusion with lysosomes.\n\nThe experimental drug blocks actin polymerization by preventing the assembly of globular actin (G-actin) into filamentous actin (F-actin). The extension of pseudopods and formation/closure of the phagocytic cup are actin-dependent processes that require F-actin. Therefore, inhibition of actin polymerization specifically impairs the engulfment step.\n\nRecognition and initial binding are mediated by receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface and do not require actin polymerization to occur, although cytoskeletal dynamics can modulate receptor clustering. Thus, the cell can still bind the bacterium.\n\nConsequently:\n- Option A is incorrect because receptor-mediated recognition and binding do not require actin polymerization.\n- Option B is correct: the macrophage will bind via its surface receptors, but the plasma membrane will fail to extend around the bacterium to engulf it due to loss of F-actin-driven protrusion.\n- Option C is incorrect because acidification is a later event after phagosome formation; here the phagosome fails to form.\n- Option D is incorrect because a “small, stable pit” refers to clathrin-mediated endocytosis; phagocytosis of large particles is actin-driven and requires pseudopod extension rather than clathrin-coated pits.\n- Option E is incorrect because fusion with lysosomes is a later maturation step that would not be reached if engulfment fails.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2313576"}, {"introduction": "In modern cell biology and pharmacology, identifying the specific pathway a new drug or nanoparticle uses to enter a cell is a critical objective.

By analyzing how different drugs affect particle uptake, you will deduce the cellular entry mechanism, a skill essential for fields ranging from drug delivery to virology.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating the cellular uptake mechanism of a novel, fluorescently-labeled spherical nanoparticle, \"NanoGlo,\" which has a diameter of 150 nm. To characterize the endocytic pathway responsible for its internalization into cultured macrophages, they perform a series of experiments using specific pharmacological inhibitors.\n\nThe experimental protocol involves pre-incubating the macrophages with an inhibitor for 30 minutes before adding the NanoGlo particles. After a 1-hour incubation with the nanoparticles, the cells are washed, and the mean intracellular fluorescence is measured using flow cytometry. The results are expressed as a percentage of the uptake observed in the control condition (no inhibitor).\n\nThe inhibitors and their primary molecular targets are:\n- **Dynasore:** A non-competitive inhibitor of the GTPase activity of dynamin.\n- **Cytochalasin D:** A fungal metabolite that binds to actin filaments and inhibits their polymerization.\n- **NSC23766:** A chemical compound that specifically inhibits the activation of Rac1, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, by preventing its interaction with its Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs).\n\nThe quantitative results from their experiments are as follows:\n\n- **Control (no inhibitor):** 100% uptake\n- **+ Dynasore:** 96% uptake relative to control\n- **+ Cytochalasin D:** 14% uptake relative to control\n- **+ NSC23766:** 18% uptake relative to control\n\nBased on these results, which of the following endocytic pathways is most likely responsible for the uptake of NanoGlo nanoparticles?\n\nA. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis\n\nB. Caveolin-mediated endocytosis\n\nC. Macropinocytosis\n\nD. A non-canonical pathway that is independent of both dynamin and actin\n\nE. Phagocytosis", "solution": "Define the measured uptake ratios relative to control as dimensionless quantities: $U_{\\text{control}}=1.00$, $U_{\\text{dynasore}}=0.96$, $U_{\\text{cytoD}}=0.14$, and $U_{\\text{NSC}}=0.18$. Interpret each inhibitor by its primary target and the known mechanistic requirements of endocytic pathways. Dynasore inhibits dynamin GTPase activity; pathways that are dynamin dependent, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, should therefore show a substantial reduction in uptake when dynasore is present. The observation $U_{\\text{dynasore}} \\approx 1.00$ indicates no meaningful dynamin dependence, which argues against clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated routes. Cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization; strong reduction to $U_{\\text{cytoD}}=0.14$ indicates that uptake is actin dependent. NSC23766 inhibits Rac1 activation by blocking its guanine nucleotide exchange; the marked reduction to $U_{\\text{NSC}}=0.18$ indicates Rac1 dependence. Among canonical pathways, macropinocytosis uniquely matches the pattern of being dynamin independent while being strongly dependent on actin polymerization and Rac1-driven membrane ruffling. Clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis are both dynamin dependent and thus are inconsistent with the dynasore insensitivity. A non-canonical pathway independent of both dynamin and actin would not be inhibited by cytochalasin D, which contradicts the data. Phagocytosis is actin dependent and can involve Rac1, but it typically engulfs substantially larger, micron-scale particles; a spherical nanoparticle of diameter $150$ nm is far more consistent with macropinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the lack of dynamin requirement excludes the latter. Therefore, the inhibitor profile and particle size together most strongly support macropinocytosis as the uptake mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2313562"}]}
