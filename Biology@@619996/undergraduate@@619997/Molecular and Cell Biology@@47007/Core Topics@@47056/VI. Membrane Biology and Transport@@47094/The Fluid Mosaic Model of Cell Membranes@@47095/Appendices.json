But is this structure an inevitable property of phospholipids, or is it a direct consequence of their aqueous environment? This thought experiment [@problem_id:2342016] challenges you to apply the first principles of amphipathic self-assembly by predicting the structure phospholipids would form in a completely nonpolar solvent. By inverting the usual context, you will solidify your understanding of the thermodynamic forces that drive all membrane organization.", "problem": "A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule composed of a polar, hydrophilic (\"water-loving\") phosphate head group and two nonpolar, hydrophobic (\"water-fearing\") fatty acid tails. In an aqueous environment, these molecules spontaneously self-assemble into a lipid bilayer, forming the fundamental structure of cell membranes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a large quantity of phospholipid molecules is added to a beaker filled entirely with a nonpolar, hydrophobic solvent, such as liquid hexane. The mixture is then vigorously agitated and allowed to settle, giving the phospholipids time to arrange themselves into their most energetically favorable configuration within the bulk of the nonpolar solvent.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the stable, large-scale structure that the phospholipids will form?\n\nA. The phospholipids will form structures where the hydrophobic tails are oriented outwards into the nonpolar solvent, and the hydrophilic heads are sequestered inwards to form a central core, shielded from the solvent.\n\nB.

The phospholipids will be completely insoluble in the nonpolar solvent and will precipitate out as a solid mass at the bottom of the beaker.\n\nE. The phospholipids will form a single, flat monolayer at the air-solvent interface, with their hydrophilic heads pointing towards the air.", "solution": "The fundamental principle governing the self-assembly of amphipathic molecules like phospholipids is the maximization of favorable interactions and minimization of unfavorable interactions between the molecules and the surrounding solvent. This is often summarized by the phrase \"like dissolves like,\" but more accurately involves minimizing the an unfavorable change in entropy of the solvent (the hydrophobic effect, in the case of water).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Components:**\n    *   **Solvent:** The solvent is hexane, which is nonpolar and hydrophobic.\n    *   **Phospholipid Heads:** These are polar and hydrophilic. They have favorable interactions with other polar molecules (like water) but unfavorable interactions with nonpolar molecules (like hexane).\n    *   **Phospholipid Tails:** These are nonpolar (hydrocarbon chains) and hydrophobic. They have favorable interactions with other nonpolar molecules (like hexane) but unfavorable interactions with polar molecules (like water).\n\n2.  **Determine the Most Energetically Favorable Configuration:**\n    To achieve the lowest energy state in a nonpolar solvent, the system will arrange itself to:\n    *   Maximize the contact between the nonpolar phospholipid tails and the nonpolar hexane solvent.\n    *   Minimize the contact between the polar phospholipid heads and the nonpolar hexane solvent.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A. The phospholipids will form structures where the hydrophobic tails are oriented outwards into the nonpolar solvent, and the hydrophilic heads are sequestered inwards to form a central core, shielded from the solvent.** This arrangement satisfies both conditions. The nonpolar tails interact favorably with the nonpolar solvent, and the polar heads are shielded from this unfavorable interaction by clustering together in a central core. This is an inverted (or reverse) micelle or bilayer structure. This is the most energetically stable configuration.\n\n    *   **B. The phospholipids will form a standard lipid bilayer, with the hydrophilic heads oriented outwards into the nonpolar solvent and the hydrophobic tails sequestered in the interior.** This is the structure formed in water. In a nonpolar solvent, this would force the hydrophilic heads into direct, unfavorable contact with the nonpolar hexane, while sequestering the hydrophobic tails away from the solvent they favorably interact with. This configuration is highly energetically unfavorable.\n\n    *   **C. The phospholipids will not form any organized structure and will disperse individually and uniformly throughout the nonpolar solvent.** If the molecules were to disperse individually, the hydrophilic head of every single phospholipid would be exposed to the nonpolar solvent. While the tails would be happily solvated, the high energetic penalty of exposing all the polar heads makes this configuration less stable than an organized structure that hides the heads.\n\n    *   **D. The phospholipids will be completely insoluble in the nonpolar solvent and will precipitate out as a solid mass at the bottom of the beaker.** This is incorrect because the long, nonpolar fatty acid tails have a strong affinity for the nonpolar hexane solvent. There is a significant favorable interaction that will drive them to mix with the solvent rather than precipitate as a solid. Precipitation would occur if the entire molecule were strongly polar.\n\n    *   **E. The phospholipids will form a single, flat monolayer at the air-solvent interface, with their hydrophilic heads pointing towards the air.** A monolayer typically forms at the interface between two immiscible phases, such as oil and water. In this problem, the phospholipids are in the bulk of a single solvent. While some molecules might accumulate at the surface, the question asks for the stable structure formed *within the bulk* of the solvent, which will be the inverted structures described in A.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is the formation of an inverted structure that maximizes tail-solvent interaction and minimizes head-solvent interaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2342016"}, {"introduction": "The 'mosaic' aspect of the fluid mosaic model refers to the patchwork of proteins embedded within the lipid bilayer, each with a specific structure and orientation. This practice [@problem_id:2342041] demonstrates how cell biologists deduce this complex architecture from primary sequence and biochemical data. By interpreting a hydropathy plot and considering the rules of glycosylation, you will learn to predict the transmembrane topology of a newly discovered protein, bridging the gap from genetic information to cellular structure.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists has identified and sequenced a novel protein, designated 'nectarin-1', from the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic sensory neuron. The complete polypeptide chain consists of 385 amino acids. To predict its structure and function, a hydropathy plot was computationally generated for the entire sequence. The analysis revealed seven distinct, non-overlapping segments, each approximately 20-23 amino acids in length, that exhibit a strongly positive average hydropathy index. These seven hydrophobic segments are interspersed by shorter, hydrophilic segments with negative average hydropathy indices. Further biochemical analysis, using an enzyme that specifically attaches carbohydrate chains to accessible asparagine residues, confirmed that the N-terminal region of nectarin-1 is heavily glycosylated when the protein is correctly folded and inserted into the cell membrane.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the predicted topology of the nectarin-1 protein within the plasma membrane?\n\nA. The protein is a seven-transmembrane protein with its N-terminus in the extracellular space and its C-terminus in the cytoplasm.\n\nB. The protein is a seven-transmembrane protein with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm and its C-terminus in the extracellular space.\n\nC. The protein is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with the cytoplasmic face of the membrane via electrostatic interactions.\n\nD. The protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein, and the seven hydrophobic regions fold together to form a beta-barrel.\n\nE. The protein is fully secreted from the cell, and the seven hydrophobic regions are buried in its globular core.\n\nF. The protein is an ion channel where the seven hydrophobic segments from a single polypeptide chain oligomerize to form a central pore.", "solution": "Let the number of strongly hydrophobic segments identified by the hydropathy plot be $n=7$, and let the length of each such segment be $L \\in [20,23]$ amino acids. A transmembrane $\\alpha$-helix spans the lipid bilayer when the product of the helix rise per residue and the number of residues approximately equals the thickness of the bilayer hydrophobic core. If $r$ denotes the approximately constant rise per residue of an $\\alpha$-helix and $d$ denotes the hydrophobic core thickness, then a spanning helix satisfies $L r \\approx d$. The observed $L$ therefore indicates that each of the seven hydrophobic segments is long enough to function as a membrane-spanning $\\alpha$-helix, implying a polytopic seven-pass transmembrane protein. The presence of interspersed hydrophilic segments with negative average hydropathy indices is consistent with loop regions connecting the transmembrane helices.\n\nNext, consider the biochemical constraint from glycosylation. The enzyme that attaches carbohydrate chains to asparagine residues (N-linked glycosylation by oligosaccharyltransferase) operates on Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs only when these residues are exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum during biosynthesis. Consequently, N-linked glycans on a plasma membrane protein end up on the non-cytosolic, extracellular side. The observation that the N-terminal region is heavily glycosylated when correctly folded and inserted into the membrane therefore implies that the N-terminus resides in the lumen during biosynthesis and hence in the extracellular space at the plasma membrane. By topological continuity, a seven-pass $\\alpha$-helical architecture with an extracellular N-terminus places the C-terminus in the cytoplasm.\n\nEvaluate the options in light of these principles:\n- A states a seven-transmembrane protein with N-terminus extracellular and C-terminus cytoplasmic; this matches the hydropathy-derived heptahelical architecture and the glycosylation-based topology constraint.\n- B inverts the termini relative to the glycosylation evidence and is therefore inconsistent.\n- C is incompatible with the presence of seven long hydrophobic segments, which indicate an integral, not peripheral, membrane protein.\n- D is incompatible with both the single-pass claim and with a beta-barrel architecture; beta-barrels are composed of antiparallel beta strands, not seven long hydrophobic helices, and are typical of outer membranes rather than eukaryotic plasma membrane proteins of this sort.\n- E contradicts the clear evidence of multiple membrane-spanning hydrophobic segments; a fully secreted soluble protein would not contain seven segments of this length indicative of bilayer-spanning helices.\n- F suggests an ion channel formed by seven hydrophobic segments from a single polypeptide forming a pore; seven-transmembrane eukaryotic proteins of this type are classically receptors (for example, G protein-coupled receptors) rather than ion channels, and the evidence provided does not indicate channel function.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is a seven-transmembrane protein with an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2342041"}, {"introduction": "The term 'fluid' in the model is not merely descriptive; it's a quantifiable property crucial for processes like cell signaling and motility.
