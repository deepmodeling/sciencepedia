{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The repair of a DNA double-strand break is not a simple cut-and-paste job; it is a sophisticated signaling cascade that unfolds on the landscape of chromatin. Before repair can occur, the cell must first flag the damaged area to recruit the necessary protein machinery. This exercise [@problem_id:2318930] explores the very first steps of this process in yeast, focusing on how a specific modification to a histone protein, γ-H2A, acts as a crucial beacon to signal the location of the break and create a platform for assembling the repair complex.", "problem": "In the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination is a highly regulated process initiated by a cascade of protein recruitment and chromatin modification. A key early event following DSB detection by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex is the phosphorylation of serine 129 (Ser129) on the C-terminal tail of histone H2A by the Tel1 kinase, creating a modified form known as γ-H2A.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered yeast strain in which the gene encoding histone H2A has been altered such that Ser129 is replaced by an alanine (Ala) residue. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated by kinases. These mutant cells are then exposed to an ionizing radiation source, which induces DSBs throughout the genome.\n\nWhich of the following cellular processes would be most directly and significantly impaired in this mutant strain compared to a wild-type strain under the same conditions?\n\nA. The initial binding of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex to the physical ends of the DNA break.\n\nB. The activation of the Tel1 kinase enzyme at the site of the DNA break.\n\nC. The stable accumulation of the mediator protein Rad9 on the chromatin regions flanking the DSB.\n\nD. The synthesis of a new DNA strand by a DNA polymerase using an intact homologous chromosome as a template.\n\nE. The initial 5' to 3' end resection at the break site, creating 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs.", "solution": "The causal order of early events in budding yeast double-strand break (DSB) signaling and repair is as follows. First, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex detects and binds the broken DNA ends. MRX then recruits and activates the Tel1 kinase at the break. Activated Tel1 phosphorylates histone H2A on Ser129 over chromatin flanking the DSB, producing the modified histone mark γ-H2A. This chromatin modification spreads and serves as a binding platform for mediator proteins, most notably Rad9 in yeast, whose BRCT domains recognize the phosphorylated H2A tail, while its Tudor domain cooperates with other histone marks to stabilize binding. Stable Rad9 accumulation on damaged chromatin is crucial for robust checkpoint signaling and proper modulation of resection and repair-factor assembly.\n\nIn the engineered H2A-S129A mutant, Ser129 cannot be phosphorylated; thus Tel1 cannot generate γ-H2A. Consequently, the chromatin binding site required for Rad9’s stable accumulation is lost, directly impairing Rad9 loading and retention at regions flanking the DSB.\n\nEvaluating the options in light of this mechanistic chain:\n- A: MRX binding to DNA ends precedes and does not require γ-H2A; it should be largely unaffected.\n- B: Tel1 activation occurs via MRX at DSBs and produces γ-H2A; preventing the phosphorylation does not prevent Tel1 activation itself.\n- C: Rad9’s stable accumulation on flanking chromatin depends directly on γ-H2A; this is the most directly and significantly impaired process in the S129A mutant.\n- D: DNA synthesis during homologous recombination is a later step; any effect would be indirect rather than the most direct impairment.\n- E: Initial 5' to 3' resection is governed by MRX-Sae2 and Exo1/Sgs1-Dna2 and is not directly dependent on γ-H2A; if anything, reduced Rad9 can relieve inhibition of resection.\n\nTherefore, the most directly and significantly impaired process is the stable accumulation of Rad9 on chromatin flanking the DSB.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2318930"}, {"introduction": "Homologous recombination fundamentally involves using a homologous DNA sequence as a template to accurately restore information lost at a break. When this process copies genetic information from one allele or locus to another, it is known as gene conversion. This practice problem [@problem_id:2318916] moves from the abstract concept of gene conversion to a concrete, hands-on task, challenging you to predict the precise sequence outcome when a modern provirus is repaired using an ancient, divergent retroelement as a template. This is a powerful illustration of how recombination between related, but non-identical, sequences can actively reshape a genome over evolutionary time.", "problem": "A cell line is infected with a novel retrovirus, which integrates into chromosome 5 of the host genome, forming a stable provirus. A 25-base pair (bp) sequence segment within this new provirus is given as PRO-Seq. The host genome also contains numerous ancient Endogenous Retroelements (EREs). One such ERE on chromosome 8 shares significant sequence homology with the provirus due to a distant common ancestor. The corresponding 25-bp segment in this ERE is given as ERE-Seq.

The cell's repair machinery initiates Homologous Recombination (HR) to repair the break. Because the sister chromatid is unavailable, the machinery uses the ERE on the non-homologous chromosome 8 as a repair template. This repair process proceeds via a gene conversion mechanism that does not result in a crossover.

How can we quantify the efficiency of a specific DNA repair pathway like homologous recombination?

By analyzing the hypothetical data from this experiment, you will learn to think like an experimentalist, connecting the molecular event of a successful repair to a measurable output and calculating the efficiency of the process.", "problem": "A team of researchers is studying the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms in a specific line of cultured human cells. They have engineered a stable cell line where each cell contains a single, integrated copy of a reporter construct called `pBFP-STOP`. This construct includes a strong constitutive promoter driving the expression of a gene for Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP), but the BFP coding sequence has been intentionally mutated to contain a premature stop codon. This mutation renders the expressed protein non-functional, and thus the cells do not exhibit blue fluorescence.\n\nTo measure the rate of Homologous Recombination (HR), the researchers transfect these cells with two components:\n1. A plasmid expressing a highly specific nuclease that induces a double-strand break (DSB) precisely at the site of the premature stop codon within the BFP gene.\n2. A linear, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide that serves as a repair template. This template is 120 nucleotides long and is perfectly homologous to the BFP gene sequence, but it contains the correct codon instead of the premature stop codon. The template itself has no promoter and cannot be independently expressed.\n\nIf a cell successfully repairs the DSB using the provided template via homologous recombination, the BFP gene's correct sequence is restored, leading to the production of functional BFP and causing the cell to become fluorescent. Any other repair pathway, such as non-homologous end joining, will not restore the BFP function.\n\nThe experiment begins with a culture containing $2.50 \\times 10^6$ cells. Following transfection, the cells are incubated for 72 hours. An independent assay determines that the transfection efficiency for this procedure is 45.0%, meaning only this fraction of the cells successfully internalizes both the nuclease plasmid and the repair template. After the incubation period, the entire cell population is analyzed by a cell sorter, which counts a total of $14,175$ blue fluorescent cells.\n\nAssuming that a successful HR repair event can only occur in a successfully transfected cell, calculate the frequency of HR-mediated repair per transfected cell.
