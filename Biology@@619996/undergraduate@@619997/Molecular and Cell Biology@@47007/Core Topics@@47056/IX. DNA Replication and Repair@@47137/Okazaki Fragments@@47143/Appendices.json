This exercise [@problem_id:2327418] takes you to the very beginning of an Okazaki fragment's life. By determining the sequence of a primer based on its DNA template, you will apply the fundamental principles of complementary base pairing and the strict `$5' \\to 3'$` directionality that governs all nucleic acid synthesis.", "problem": "During the replication of a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecule, the enzyme DNA polymerase can only synthesize a new strand in the `$5' \\to 3'$` direction. While this is straightforward for the leading strand, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments known as Okazaki fragments. Each Okazaki fragment is initiated by a short Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) primer, which is synthesized by an enzyme called primase. This primer provides the necessary 3'-hydroxyl group for DNA polymerase to begin synthesis.\n\nConsider a specific initiation site on the lagging strand template of a eukaryotic organism. The sequence of the DNA template at this site is read as:\n$$3'-\\text{GGCATACG}-5'$$\nWhat will be the sequence of the RNA primer synthesized by primase to initiate a new Okazaki fragment at this location?\n\nA. $5'-\\text{CCGTATGC}-3'$\n\nB. $3'-\\text{CCGUAUGC}-5'$\n\nC. $5'-\\text{CCGUAUGC}-3'$\n\nD. $5'-\\text{GCATACGG}-3'$\n\nE. $3'-\\text{GGCATACG}-5'$", "solution": "DNA primase synthesizes the RNA primer in the `$5' \\to 3'$` direction, complementary and antiparallel to the DNA template. Base-pairing rules for RNA to DNA are: A pairs with U, T pairs with A, G pairs with C, and C pairs with G. Given the template 3'-GGCATACG-5', the RNA primer synthesized antiparallel (`$5' \\to 3'$`) will be complementary nucleotide by nucleotide:\n- Template G pairs with RNA C,\n- Template G pairs with RNA C,\n- Template C pairs with RNA G,\n- Template A pairs with RNA U,\n- Template T pairs with RNA A,\n- Template A pairs with RNA U,\n- Template C pairs with RNA G,\n- Template G pairs with RNA C.\nThus the RNA primer sequence is 5'-CCGUAUGC-3', which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2327418"}, {"introduction": "Synthesizing Okazaki fragments is only half the battle; they must ultimately be joined to form a seamless, continuous DNA strand. This classic thought experiment [@problem_id:1506903] explores the critical role of the enzyme DNA ligase, the \"molecular glue\" of replication. By predicting the structure of the lagging strand in a cell where this enzyme is inactive, you can clearly distinguish the process of gap-filling by DNA polymerase from the final act of nick-sealing by ligase.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a temperature-sensitive mutant of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. This mutant possesses a version of the enzyme DNA ligase that functions normally at a permissive temperature of 30째C but is completely non-functional at a restrictive temperature of 42째C. All other enzymes involved in DNA replication, including DNA Polymerase I and DNA Polymerase III, are unaffected by the temperature change.\n\nThe geneticist grows a culture of these mutant bacteria at 30째C until it reaches a sufficient density. The entire culture is then rapidly shifted to the restrictive temperature of 42째C. The cells are allowed to complete exactly one full round of chromosomal DNA replication before the process is halted and the DNA is isolated for analysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of a newly synthesized lagging strand within the resulting daughter DNA molecules?\n\nA. A single, long strand of DNA is formed, but it contains periodic single-stranded breaks (nicks) where adjacent fragments were not joined.\n\nB. It consists of many short fragments, each composed of an RNA primer section covalently bonded to a longer DNA section.\n\nC. It consists of many short, physically separated fragments of pure DNA, with gaps between them where RNA primers were removed.\n\nD. It is a continuous strand of DNA with no breaks, identical in structure to a newly synthesized leading strand.\n\nE. The lagging strand is not synthesized at all, as the failure of DNA ligase causes the replication fork to stall and collapse.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the structure of the newly synthesized lagging strand in a special strain of *E. coli* that has a non-functional DNA ligase, after one round of replication has completed. To solve this, we must review the key steps of lagging strand synthesis.\n\n1.  **Replication is Semi-Discontinuous:** DNA replication proceeds by unwinding the double helix at a replication fork. One new strand, the leading strand, is synthesized continuously in the `$5' \\to 3'$` direction, following the fork. The other new strand, the lagging strand, must be synthesized in the opposite direction of the fork's movement. This is accomplished discontinuously, through the synthesis of short segments called Okazaki fragments.\n\n2.  **Synthesis of Okazaki Fragments:** Each Okazaki fragment is initiated by an RNA primer, synthesized by the enzyme primase. DNA Polymerase III then extends this primer, adding DNA nucleotides in the `$5' \\to 3'$` direction until it reaches the 5' end of the previous Okazaki fragment's RNA primer. At this point, DNA Polymerase III detaches.\n\n3.  **Primer Removal and Gap Filling:** The enzyme DNA Polymerase I is responsible for processing these fragments. It has a `$5' \\to 3'$` exonuclease activity, which allows it to remove the RNA primer of the preceding Okazaki fragment. Simultaneously, its `$5' \\to 3'$` polymerase activity fills the resulting gap with DNA nucleotides. This process continues until the entire RNA primer is replaced by DNA. This problem states that DNA Polymerase I is fully functional.\n\n4.  **Ligation:** After DNA Polymerase I has finished its work, there is a final discontinuity remaining on the DNA backbone. This is a single-stranded break, known as a \"nick,\" between the 3'-hydroxyl group (-OH) of the DNA just synthesized by DNA Polymerase I and the 5'-phosphate group of the adjacent Okazaki fragment. The role of the enzyme DNA ligase is to catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond, which seals this nick and creates a continuous DNA strand.\n\n5.  **Applying the Condition:** In the given scenario, the bacteria are at a restrictive temperature where DNA ligase is non-functional. Therefore, while DNA Polymerase III can synthesize the Okazaki fragments and DNA Polymerase I can remove the RNA primers and replace them with DNA, the final step of sealing the nicks cannot occur.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the Options:**\n    *   **A:** This option states the strand is long and made of DNA, but with periodic nicks. This is precisely the expected outcome. The fragments are all synthesized and joined in a sense (by being adjacent), but the final covalent bond in the sugar-phosphate backbone is missing at each junction. This is the correct description.\n    *   **B:** This option suggests the RNA primers are still present. This is incorrect. The problem states that DNA Polymerase I is functional, and its job is to remove the RNA primers. The failure of ligase occurs *after* the action of DNA Polymerase I.\n    *   **C:** This option suggests there are physical gaps between the fragments. This is incorrect. DNA Polymerase I's polymerase activity fills the gaps left by primer removal. What remains is not a gap (missing nucleotides) but a nick (a broken phosphodiester bond in the backbone).\n    *   **D:** This option claims the lagging strand is continuous. This would only be true if DNA ligase were functional. Because it is not, the strand will be discontinuous at the level of the phosphodiester backbone.\n    *   **E:** This option suggests replication halts. While the lack of a functional ligase is ultimately lethal, the replication machinery can complete a full round of synthesis. The daughter chromosomes will be formed, but one strand of each will be riddled with nicks. Therefore, replication itself does not stall.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the newly synthesized lagging strand will be a complete strand of DNA nucleotides, but with unsealed nicks between the regions corresponding to the original Okazaki fragments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1506903"}, {"introduction": "To truly appreciate the efficiency of DNA replication, we must move from the level of a single fragment to the scale of an entire genome. This problem [@problem_id:1506946] challenges you to think quantitatively about the replication of a whole circular plasmid.
