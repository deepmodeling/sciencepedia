The plasmid DNA is in the standard B-form, which has a helical pitch of 10.5 base pairs (bp) per turn. The replication process is initiated at a single origin, and a helicase enzyme moves along the DNA, unwinding the double helix to create a single replication fork. The replication fork is observed to advance at a constant rate of 315 bp per second.\n\nTo manage the topological strain that builds up ahead of the advancing fork, a eukaryotic Type I topoisomerase is included in the reaction mixture. Assume this enzyme works with perfect efficiency, meaning it completely and instantaneously relaxes any supercoiling that is induced by the helicase activity.\n\nTo maintain a constant topological state (i.e., to prevent any net change in superhelical density) in the unreplicated portion of the plasmid, what is the required rate of change in the linking number, expressed in units of linking number per minute, that must be catalyzed by the topoisomerase?", "solution": "A covalently closed circular DNA has its total linking number conserved unless changed by topoisomerase activity. As the helicase advances, it unwinds the duplex, removing helical turns at a rate equal to the base pairs unwound per time divided by the helical pitch.

This advanced problem challenges you to model the replication machinery as a system where multiple processes—DNA unwinding, priming, extension, and topological relaxation—are all potential rate-limiting steps. By analyzing the kinetics of this hypothetical system to identify the overall bottleneck, you will develop a systems-level perspective on the complex dynamics that govern this fundamental biological process [@problem_id:2337043].", "problem": "In the abyssal plains of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, scientists have isolated a novel archaeon, *Ignisphaera rapida*, which possesses a unique replication mechanism for its circular chromosome. This organism's replication machinery lacks a canonical primase. Instead, lagging strand synthesis is initiated by a specialized enzyme, \"Initiase,\" which is a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) polymerase capable of *de novo* synthesis on a single-stranded template. However, Initiase can only begin synthesis at a specific, recurring 6-base-pair palindromic sequence. The average distance between these initiation sites along the chromosome is found to be $\\lambda$.\n\nThe replication fork is driven by a helicase that unwinds the DNA double helix, which has $h$ base pairs per turn. This helicase has a maximum catalytic velocity of $v_H$. The main replicative DNA polymerase, \"Extendase,\" has a high processivity and synthesizes DNA at a constant rate of $v_E$. Extendase takes over after Initiase has synthesized a short DNA primer of length $l_p$. The binding of an Initiase enzyme to an exposed single-stranded initiation site is not instantaneous and requires an average time of $t_{bind}$. Once bound, Initiase synthesizes the primer at its own characteristic rate of $v_I$.\n\nThe unwinding of the parental DNA by the helicase introduces positive supercoils ahead of the replication fork. These are removed by a Type II topoisomerase. Each catalytic cycle of this topoisomerase, which takes a time $t_{topo}$, results in a change in the linking number of $\\Delta Lk = -2$, effectively relaxing two positive supercoils.\n\nGiven the following parameters for *Ignisphaera rapida* replication at its optimal temperature:\n-   Helicase maximum velocity, $v_H = 1100$ base pairs per second (bp/s)\n-   Extendase synthesis rate, $v_E = 950$ nucleotides per second (nt/s)\n-   Initiase synthesis rate, $v_I = 50$ nt/s\n-   Length of primer synthesized by Initiase, $l_p = 12$ nucleotides\n-   Average binding time for Initiase, $t_{bind} = 0.25$ seconds\n-   Average distance between initiation sites, $\\lambda = 2000$ base pairs\n-   Topoisomerase cycle time, $t_{topo} = 0.050$ seconds\n-   Base pairs per helical turn, $h = 10.4$ bp/turn\n\nAssuming that replication proceeds in a continuous, steady state, what is the maximum possible velocity of the replication fork? Express your answer in base pairs per second (bp/s), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We seek the maximum steady-state replication fork velocity subject to three potential rate-limiting processes: helicase-lead polymerase coupling, lagging-strand initiation and extension, and topological relaxation of positive supercoils by the Type II topoisomerase.\n\nFirst, the helicase and leading-strand polymerase must proceed in a coordinated fashion. The fork cannot advance faster than either the helicase unwinding rate or the leading-strand synthesis rate, so\n$$\nv_{\\text{HP}}=\\min\\{v_{H},\\,v_{E}\\}.\n$$\nWith the given values, $v_{H}=1100$ and $v_{E}=950$, hence\n$$\nv_{\\text{HP}}=950.\n$$\n\nSecond, the lagging strand proceeds in a cycle consisting of: exposure of an initiation site, Initiase binding, primer synthesis, and Extendase-driven extension of the Okazaki fragment. In steady state with a single lagging-strand polymerase recycled between fragments, the average throughput of lagging-strand DNA synthesis is the fragment length divided by the cycle time. Given that initiation sites are, on average, spaced by $\\lambda$, the average time per Okazaki fragment is\n$$\nt_{\\text{cycle}}=t_{\\text{bind}}+\\frac{l_{p}}{v_{I}}+\\frac{\\lambda-l_{p}}{v_{E}},\n$$\nso the average lagging-strand synthesis rate is\n$$\nv_{\\text{lag}}=\\frac{\\lambda}{t_{\\text{bind}}+\\frac{l_{p}}{v_{I}}+\\frac{\\lambda-l_{p}}{v_{E}}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nt_{\\text{bind}}=0.25,\\quad \\frac{l_{p}}{v_{I}}=\\frac{12}{50}=0.24,\\quad \\frac{\\lambda-l_{p}}{v_{E}}=\\frac{2000-12}{950}=\\frac{1988}{950}=2.09263157895,\n$$\nhence\n$$\nt_{\\text{cycle}}=0.25+0.24+2.09263157895=2.58263157895,\n$$\nand\n$$\nv_{\\text{lag}}=\\frac{2000}{2.58263157895}\\approx 7.744\\times 10^{2}.\n$$\n\nThird, the helicase unwinds the duplex at $v$ base pairs per second, introducing positive supercoils ahead of the fork at a rate equal to the number of helical turns unwound per second.
