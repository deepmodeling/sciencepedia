[@problem_id:2326796]", "problem": "The canonical Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway is a primary mechanism for repairing DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) in many organisms. This process involves a series of coordinated molecular events to recognize, process, and ligate the broken DNA ends. Consider the following three key events in this pathway:\n\nEvent I: Binding of the Ku heterodimer (Ku70/80) to the free DNA ends of a break.\n\nEvent II: Covalent sealing of the sugar-phosphate backbone by the DNA Ligase IV complex.\n\nEvent III: Phosphorylation of various protein targets by the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs).\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the temporal sequence of these three events during a typical canonical NHEJ repair cycle?\n\nA.

III → II → I", "solution": "The canonical NHEJ pathway proceeds through recognition and protection of DNA ends, kinase-mediated regulation and processing, and finally ligation. First, the Ku heterodimer (Ku70/80) rapidly binds to the exposed DNA double-strand break ends, protecting them from degradation and serving as a platform to recruit additional NHEJ factors; this corresponds to Event I. Binding of Ku facilitates recruitment of DNA-PKcs to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme at the DNA ends. Once assembled, DNA-PKcs becomes catalytically active and phosphorylates multiple substrates, including itself (autophosphorylation), Ku, and other NHEJ and chromatin factors; this regulatory phosphorylation promotes end bridging, accessibility, and processing necessary for repair progression; this corresponds to Event III. After end alignment and any required processing, the ligation step is executed by the DNA Ligase IV complex (Ligase IV with XRCC4 and XLF), which covalently seals the sugar-phosphate backbone to complete repair; this corresponds to Event II.\n\nTherefore, the temporal sequence is Event I followed by Event III followed by Event II, i.e., I → III → II, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2326796"}, {"introduction": "The principles of DNA repair have profound implications for modern biotechnology, most notably in the field of genome engineering. The revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 system, for instance, often relies on the cell's intrinsic repair machinery to achieve its goal of gene disruption. This problem presents a common experimental scenario and asks you to deduce the repair pathway responsible for the observed genetic modification, highlighting the practical consequences of NHEJ's inherently error-prone nature. [@problem_id:2326771]", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the function of a newly discovered gene, *Gene X*, in human cell culture. To disrupt the gene and observe the resulting phenotype, they employ the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. This system is designed to introduce a precise Double-Strand Break (DSB) within the coding sequence of *Gene X*. The experiment is conducted on a population of asynchronous cells (cells at various stages of the cell cycle). After the procedure, the researchers isolate genomic DNA from the cells and perform DNA sequencing on the region surrounding the target site in *Gene X*. A significant portion of the sequenced alleles shows a 4-base pair deletion at the exact location of the intended DSB, resulting in a frameshift mutation and a non-functional protein.\n\nGiven this experimental outcome, which of the following cellular DNA repair pathways is most likely responsible for creating this 4-base pair deletion?\n\nA. Base Excision Repair (BER)\n\nB. Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)\n\nC. Mismatch Repair (MMR)\n\nD. Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)\n\nE. Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)", "solution": "CRISPR-Cas9 generates a targeted double-strand break (DSB) within the coding sequence of Gene X. In mammalian cells, DSBs are principally repaired by two pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and mismatch repair (MMR) address single-strand lesions or base-pairing errors and do not resolve DSBs.\n\nIn an asynchronous cell population without provision of an exogenous homologous donor template, the predominant repair mechanism for Cas9-induced DSBs is NHEJ. NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle, rapidly ligating DNA ends after limited end processing. This processing is intrinsically error-prone and commonly introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the cut site. Such indels frequently cause frameshift mutations that disrupt protein function. By contrast, HDR requires a homologous template (e.g., sister chromatid in S/G2 or an exogenous donor) and typically yields precise, template-directed repair rather than random small deletions.\n\nThe observed recurrent 4-base pair deletion precisely at the cut site, causing a frameshift and loss of function, is the characteristic outcome of error-prone NHEJ rather than BER, NER, MMR, or template-driven HDR.\n\nTherefore, the most likely pathway responsible for the 4-base pair deletion is non-homologous end joining.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2326771"}, {"introduction": "Having established that NHEJ can introduce small insertions or deletions (indels), let's explore how these changes arise at the molecular level.

NHEJ processing then uses the newly synthesized sequence as a template to synthesize the complementary strand to make the DNA locally double-stranded.

This complementary synthesis occurs on the opposing (bottom) strand opposite the added ATG.\n3.
