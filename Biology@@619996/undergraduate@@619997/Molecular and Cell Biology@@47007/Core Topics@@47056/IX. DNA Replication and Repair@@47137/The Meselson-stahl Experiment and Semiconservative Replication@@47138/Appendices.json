Therefore, all DNA molecules are composed of two \"heavy\" strands. We can represent a DNA molecule with two heavy strands as H/H.\n- Number of molecules: 1\n- Strands: 2 heavy (H) strands.\n- Total number of strands: 2\n- Number of $^{15}$N (H) strands: 2\n\n**Semiconservative Replication Principle**\nDuring semiconservative replication, the parent DNA molecule unwinds, and each of the two strands serves as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand. The building blocks (nucleotides) for the new strand are sourced from the surrounding medium.\n\n**First Generation (Round 1 of Replication)**\nThe H/H molecule replicates in the $^{14}$N medium. The new strands synthesized will be \"light\" (L).\n- The two H strands from the parent molecule separate.\n- Each H strand serves as a template for a new L strand.\n- This results in two new DNA molecules, both of which are hybrids, containing one H strand and one L strand (H/L).\n- State after Generation 1: 2 H/L molecules.\n- Total number of strands: $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n- Number of $^{15}$N (H) strands: The original two H strands are conserved. So, there are 2 H strands.\n- Number of $^{14}$N (L) strands: 2.\n- Fraction of H strands = $2/4 = 1/2$.\n\n**Second Generation (Round 2 of Replication)**\nThe two H/L molecules from Generation 1 now replicate in the $^{14}$N medium.\n- The first H/L molecule separates into an H strand and an L strand.\n    - The H template strand pairs with a new L strand, forming one H/L molecule.\n    - The L template strand pairs with a new L strand, forming one L/L molecule.\n- The second H/L molecule does the same, producing another H/L and another L/L molecule.\n- State after Generation 2: 2 H/L molecules and 2 L/L molecules, for a total of 4 molecules.\n- Total number of strands: $4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n- Number of $^{15}$N (H) strands: The original two H strands are still present, each now in one of the two H/L hybrid molecules. So, there are 2 H strands.\n- Number of $^{14}$N (L) strands: $8 - 2 = 6$.\n- Fraction of H strands = $2/8 = 1/4$.\n\n**Third Generation (Round 3 of Replication)**\nThe four molecules from Generation 2 replicate in the $^{14}$N medium.\n- The two H/L molecules each produce one H/L molecule and one L/L molecule. This gives 2 H/L and 2 L/L molecules.\n- The two L/L molecules each produce two L/L molecules. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ L/L molecules.\n- State after Generation 3: 2 H/L molecules and $(2 + 4) = 6$ L/L molecules, for a total of 8 molecules.\n- Total number of strands: $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n- Number of $^{15}$N (H) strands: The original two H strands are conserved and are now located in the two H/L hybrid molecules. So, there are still 2 H strands.\n- Number of $^{14}$N (L) strands: $16 - 2 = 14$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe fraction of total strands that contain the heavy $^{15}$N isotope is the number of H strands divided by the total number of strands.\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Number of }^{15}\\text{N strands}}{\\text{Total number of strands}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = 0.125 $$\nThe number 0.125 has three significant figures (1, 2, 5), so no further rounding is needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a general formula. After $n$ rounds of replication, the total number of DNA molecules will be $2^n$ (starting from one molecule). The total number of strands will be $2 \\times 2^n = 2^{n+1}$.

Denote heavy parental strands by H and light strands by L. After transfer to the $^{14}$N medium, start counting at generation $g=0$ with all molecules HH.\n\nAfter one generation in light ($g=1$), each HH molecule yields two HL molecules that segregate so that all DNA molecules present are hybrid HL.

The student begins by growing a culture of *E. coli* for many generations in a medium where the sole nitrogen source is the heavy isotope $^{15}$N. After this initial growth period, the bacteria are pelleted, washed, and transferred to a new medium containing only the light nitrogen isotope, $^{14}$N. The culture is then allowed to grow for a time equivalent to exactly one generation. Following this, the student isolates the DNA from the bacteria, and analyzes its density using cesium chloride (CsCl) density-gradient centrifugation.\n\nAccording to the semiconservative model, after one round of replication, all the DNA should be of an intermediate density, forming a single band between the positions of pure $^{15}$N-DNA and pure $^{14}$N-DNA. However, upon examining the centrifuge tube, the student is surprised to find three distinct bands: one at the heavy-density position, one at the intermediate-density position, and one at the light-density position.\n\nAssuming that DNA replication in *E. coli* is indeed semiconservative, which of the following simple procedural errors provides the most plausible explanation for the appearance of all three bands after a single generation time?\n\nA. The new flask of $^{14}$N medium was accidentally contaminated with a small number of *E. coli* from a separate stock culture that had only ever been grown in standard $^{14}$N medium.\nB. The centrifuge was run at a speed much lower than required, leading to incomplete separation of DNA molecules.\nC. A technical error during the DNA isolation protocol led to the complete denaturation of all DNA molecules into single strands before centrifugation.\nD.

The initial culture grown in $^{15}$N medium was accidentally exposed to a mutagen that caused a fraction of the cells to switch to a dispersive model of replication.", "solution": "We apply the key principles of the Meselson–Stahl experimental logic and CsCl density-gradient centrifugation:\n\n1) Semiconservative replication principle: Each parental DNA duplex contributes one template strand to each daughter duplex. Therefore, if cells grown long-term in $^{15}$N are shifted to $^{14}$N and permitted exactly one round of replication, every molecule that has replicated once will be hybrid $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N (denoted HL), banding at an intermediate buoyant density between pure heavy (HH) and pure light (LL).\n\n2) CsCl buoyant density separation principle: In isopycnic gradients, DNA bands at positions determined by its average buoyant density. Thus HH, HL, and LL duplexes resolve to heavy, intermediate, and light positions, respectively.\n\n3) Population timing principle: A nominal “one generation time” is the average doubling time. In an asynchronous culture, at an elapsed time equal to one generation, a fraction of cells may not yet have completed replication, leaving some HH DNA; those that have completed one replication produce HL DNA.\n\nTo formalize the band composition, let the fraction of originally $^{15}$N-labeled cells that have completed one replication by sampling be $f$, with $0<f<1$ in an unsynchronized population. Then:\n- Fraction $(1-f)$ of DNA remains HH (heavy band).\n- Fraction $f$ becomes HL (intermediate band).\n\nIf, in addition, there is a small contamination by cells that have only ever grown in $^{14}$N (call their fractional contribution $c>0$), their DNA is LL both before and after replication in $^{14}$N, so they contribute a light band. Hence, with $f\\in(0,1)$ and $c>0$, three distinct bands (HH, HL, LL) appear simultaneously, matching the observation.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA. Contamination with $^{14}$N-only cells. This introduces an LL subpopulation that will band at the light position. Meanwhile, the $^{15}$N-prelabeled population contributes HL from those that replicated and HH from those that had not yet replicated at sampling. This single simple procedural error produces exactly the observed pattern: heavy (HH), intermediate (HL), and light (LL) bands.\n\nB. Centrifuge run too slowly. Insufficient centrifugal force degrades resolution, yielding poorly separated or smeared bands, not extra discrete bands precisely at heavy, intermediate, and light positions. It does not generate a new light band de novo.\n\nC. Complete denaturation to single strands. Denaturing HL duplexes yields separate heavy and light single strands, which band near heavy and light positions; the intermediate duplex band disappears. This would give two bands (heavy and light) from hybrid molecules rather than three, and it cannot on its own explain an intermediate duplex band.\n\nD. Accidental DNase addition. DNase degrades DNA into smaller fragments. Buoyant density in CsCl is independent of fragment length; degradation reduces yield and can broaden or diminish bands but does not create an additional discrete light band nor convert HL to HH or LL.\n\nE. A fraction switches to dispersive replication. Dispersive replication yields DNA of intermediate density after the first round; it does not produce pure HH or pure LL immediately after one generation. Moreover, this hypothesis does not explain the appearance of a pure light band without prior $^{14}$N-only DNA.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible simple procedural error that explains all three observed bands after one generation in a semiconservative system is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2342705"}]}
