This practice problem uses a classic biochemical experiment to visualize the direct consequences of the first two enzymatic actions in BER. By comparing a normal cell extract to one missing a key enzyme, Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG), you can deduce the precise roles of the glycosylase and the subsequent AP endonuclease in creating a nicked DNA intermediate from a damaged, supercoiled plasmid [@problem_id:2305493].", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the initial steps of the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway in a bacterial cell extract. Researchers prepare a large quantity of a standard 4.5 kilobase-pair (kbp) circular plasmid. In its native state, this plasmid is supercoiled. A single uracil (U) base is incorporated into one strand of this double-stranded plasmid, opposite a guanine (G), creating a single U:G mispair.\n\nTwo separate reaction mixtures are prepared in identical buffer conditions suitable for DNA repair enzymes.\n- **Tube A**: Contains the uracil-containing plasmid and a cell-free extract from a wild-type bacterial strain. This extract contains all the necessary enzymes for DNA repair, including Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG).\n- **Tube B**: Contains the uracil-containing plasmid and a cell-free extract from a mutant bacterial strain that has a null mutation in the gene for UDG, meaning it completely lacks functional UDG enzyme. This extract is otherwise identical to the wild-type extract.\n\nAfter incubation for a time sufficient for the initial enzymatic steps of repair to occur, the contents of both tubes are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. On such a gel, the supercoiled plasmid migrates the fastest, the linear form migrates at an intermediate rate, and the nicked (open circular) form migrates the slowest.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the predominant form of the plasmid you would expect to observe in each tube?\n\nA. Tube A: Supercoiled; Tube B: Supercoiled\n\nB. Tube A: Nicked circular; Tube B: Supercoiled\n\nC. Tube A: Linear; Tube B: Nicked circular\n\nD. Tube A: Supercoiled; Tube B: Nicked circular\n\nE. Tube A: Nicked circular; Tube B: Nicked circular", "solution": "The plasmid starts as a covalently closed circular DNA that is supercoiled. A single-strand break (nick) is sufficient to relax supercoiling, converting it to the nicked (open circular) form, which migrates slowest on agarose gels, while the supercoiled form migrates fastest. The linear form would require a double-strand break, which is not generated by the initial steps of base excision repair.\n\nBase Excision Repair of a U:G mispair proceeds initially as follows:\n1) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) removes the uracil base from the DNA, creating an abasic (AP) site in the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n2) An AP endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at the AP site, generating a single-strand break (nick).\n3) DNA polymerase performs gap filling, and DNA ligase seals the nick; however, until ligation occurs, the DNA remains nicked and thus open circular.\n\nTube A contains UDG and all other BER enzymes. Therefore:\n- UDG excises U to form an AP site.\n- AP endonuclease incises at the AP site, producing a nick.\n- During the time window described as sufficient for initial steps, ligation is not assumed to be complete; thus the predominant product is nicked (open circular) DNA.\n\nTube B lacks UDG but is otherwise identical. Therefore:\n- No U excision occurs, no AP site is formed, and AP endonuclease has no substrate.\n- The plasmid remains covalently closed and supercoiled.\n\nLinear DNA is not expected in either tube because the initial BER steps create only a single-strand break, not a double-strand break.\n\nThus, Tube A will predominantly contain nicked circular plasmid, and Tube B will predominantly contain supercoiled plasmid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2305493"}, {"introduction": "Once a damaged base is removed and the DNA backbone is nicked, the repair is not yet complete. This exercise examines the crucial \"clean-up\" phase of short-patch BER, which is handled by the multi-functional enzyme DNA Polymerase $\\beta$ (Pol $\\beta$). By exploring a scenario where Pol $\\beta$'s gap-filling activity is functional but its 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) lyase activity is not, you will uncover a critical bottleneck in the pathway and understand why this specific chemical step is essential for the final ligation [@problem_id:2305466].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a team of researchers has developed a specialized human cell line to study the intricacies of DNA repair. In this cell line, the endogenous gene for DNA Polymerase $\\beta$ (Pol $\\beta$) has been replaced with a gene encoding a mutant variant of the enzyme. This mutant Pol $\\beta$ retains its full, wild-type gap-filling polymerase activity. However, due to a specific point mutation in its N-terminal domain, it completely lacks its 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) lyase activity. All other DNA repair proteins, including DNA glycosylases, AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1), DNA ligases, and polymerases involved in long-patch repair, are expressed at normal levels and are fully functional.\n\nThese engineered cells are then exposed to a chemical agent that induces a high frequency of uracil incorporation into the DNA, a type of damage primarily addressed by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. Given the specific enzymatic defect in this cell line, which of the following molecular outcomes would be the most direct and prominent consequence observed within the cells?\n\nA. A significant accumulation of unprocessed abasic (AP) sites throughout the genome.\n\nB. A failure to synthesize DNA and fill the single-nucleotide gap created after base removal.\n\nC. An accumulation of repaired sites that contain a newly inserted nucleotide but remain unligated due to a persistent 5'-dRP moiety at the nick.\n\nD. A complete cessation of all BER activity, as Pol $\\beta$ is essential for the pathway to begin.\n\nE. The shunting of all BER events into the long-patch sub-pathway, leading to the excessive removal of undamaged nucleotides.\n\nF. A failure of APE1 to incise the phosphodiester backbone at AP sites.", "solution": "Base Excision Repair (BER) of uracil proceeds as follows: a DNA glycosylase removes uracil to create an abasic (AP) site; AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1) then incises the phosphodiester backbone on the 5' side of the AP site, generating a single-strand break with a 3'-hydroxyl and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) terminus. In the short-patch BER sub-pathway, DNA Polymerase $\\beta$ (Pol $\\beta$) performs two required activities: (i) gap-filling DNA synthesis to insert one nucleotide at the 3' end, and (ii) 5'-dRP lyase activity to excise the 5'-dRP moiety, thereby creating a ligatable 5' phosphate. Finally, DNA ligase seals the nick.\n\nIn the engineered cells, the mutant Pol $\\beta$ retains full gap-filling polymerase activity but completely lacks 5'-dRP lyase activity. Therefore, after uracil is excised and APE1 incises, Pol $\\beta$ can still synthesize the correct nucleotide into the gap at the 3' end; however, the 5'-dRP moiety persists at the 5' side of the nick. The presence of the 5'-dRP blocks ligation because ligases require a 5' phosphate and cannot seal a nick bearing a sugar-phosphate remnant. Thus, the most direct and prominent consequence is an accumulation of repair intermediates in which a new nucleotide has been inserted but the nick remains unligated due to the persistent 5'-dRP.\n\nThis directly rules out the other choices: APE1 is functional, so unprocessed AP sites will not significantly accumulate (reject A). Polymerase activity is intact, so gap filling will occur (reject B). BER does not cease, as early steps proceed and long-patch BER remains available (reject D). Some lesions can be shunted into long-patch BER, where strand displacement and FEN1 can remove the blocking group, but this is a compensatory route and not necessarily the most direct or predominant immediate outcome at the moment of Pol $\\beta$ action; moreover, the key biochemical block specific to this mutant is failed ligation due to the unremoved 5'-dRP (reject E as the primary, “most direct and prominent,” outcome). APE1 incision is upstream and unaffected (reject F).\n\nTherefore, the most direct and prominent molecular consequence is the accumulation of nicked repair intermediates containing a newly inserted nucleotide that remain unligated because the 5'-dRP moiety persists at the nick.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2305466"}, {"introduction": "The failure of DNA repair pathways has profound consequences for genetic stability and human health. This final practice moves from the mechanics of repair to its real-world impact, focusing on the link between oxidative damage and cancer-associated mutations. By tracing the fate of a common DNA lesion, 8-oxoguanine, through multiple rounds of replication in a cell deficient for the MUTYH glycosylase, you will see exactly how a failure in BER leads to a specific and predictable G:C to T:A transversion mutation signature [@problem_id:2305514].", "problem": "Oxidative stress is a major source of endogenous DNA damage. One of the most common lesions is the oxidation of guanine to form 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Cells have evolved a multi-layered defense system, known as Base Excision Repair (BER), to counteract such damage.\n\nConsider a scenario starting with a normal Guanine:Cytosine (G:C) base pair in the DNA of a cell.\n1.  An oxidative event converts the guanine to 8-oxoG, forming an 8-oxoG:C pair.\n2.  Normally, the 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) would remove the 8-oxoG, but we assume this specific lesion escapes OGG1 repair and persists through the first round of DNA replication.\n3.  During replication, DNA polymerase frequently mis-incorporates an adenine (A) opposite the 8-oxoG lesion.\n4.  In a healthy cell, a second glycosylase, MutY Homolog (MUTYH), specifically recognizes the adenine in the resulting 8-oxoG:A mispair and excises it, initiating a repair process that ultimately inserts a cytosine.\n\nNow, consider a cell line that is deficient in the MUTYH enzyme. This cell line undergoes two complete rounds of replication after the initial formation of the 8-oxoG:C lesion. Which of the following pathways correctly describes the sequence of events that leads to a fixed, heritable mutation in a granddaughter cell? A \"fixed\" mutation is defined as one that consists of a standard Watson-Crick base pair and will be stably propagated in subsequent replications.\n\nA) G:C → (Oxidation) → 8-oxoG:C → (Replication 1) → 8-oxoG:A → (Replication 2 on A-template strand) → T:A\n\nB) G:C → (Oxidation) → 8-oxoG:C → (Replication 1) → G:C\n\nC) G:C → (Oxidation) → 8-oxoG:C → (Replication 1) → 8-oxoG:A → (Replication 2 on 8-oxoG-template strand) → 8-oxoG:A\n\nD) G:C → (Oxidation) → 8-oxoG:C → (Replication 1 on C-template strand) → G:C → (Replication 2) → A:T\n\nE) G:C → (Oxidation) → 8-oxoG:C → (Replication 1) → 8-oxoG:A → (Repair attempt) → G:A → (Replication 2) → G:C", "solution": "We begin with a normal duplex containing a G:C pair. Oxidative stress converts the guanine to 8-oxoguanine, yielding an 8-oxoG:C pair. This lesion is assumed to evade OGG1-mediated base excision before the first replication, so it persists into S phase.\n\nPrinciple of base selection by DNA polymerase: during replication, the polymerase selects bases complementary to the template. However, 8-oxoG frequently adopts a syn conformation and pairs with adenine via Hoogsteen pairing. Consequently, when the strand containing 8-oxoG serves as the template in the first replication, the polymerase often inserts A opposite 8-oxoG, generating an 8-oxoG:A mispair in one daughter duplex. The sister duplex, derived from the opposite template strand that carries C, directs incorporation of G and remains G:C at that position.\n\nIn a healthy cell, MUTYH recognizes the adenine in the 8-oxoG:A mispair and excises it, initiating BER to restore a C opposite the lesion, ultimately preventing mutation. In the MUTYH-deficient cell, this A is not removed, so the 8-oxoG:A mispair persists into the second round of replication.\n\nAt the second replication, consider the two possible templates from the duplex carrying 8-oxoG:A:\n- If the A-containing strand serves as the template, standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules direct insertion of T opposite A, producing a T:A base pair in that granddaughter duplex. This is now a standard, fully paired Watson-Crick base pair and thus a fixed G:C to T:A transversion relative to the original sequence.\n- If instead the 8-oxoG-containing strand serves as the template again, polymerase can again misinsert A opposite 8-oxoG, regenerating 8-oxoG:A. This outcome is not a standard Watson-Crick base pair and remains a lesion, not a fixed mutation.\n\nTherefore, the pathway that leads to a fixed, heritable mutation in a granddaughter cell is the one in which, after the first replication produces 8-oxoG:A, the second replication occurs on the A-containing template strand to produce T:A. This corresponds precisely to:\nG:C → (Oxidation) → 8-oxoG:C → (Replication 1) → 8-oxoG:A → (Replication 2 on A-template strand) → T:A,\nwhich is option A.\n\nAll other options fail for the following reasons:\n- B reverts to G:C after replication 1, which neither reflects the common mispairing outcome nor yields a fixed mutation.\n- C maintains 8-oxoG:A after replication 2 on the 8-oxoG template, which is not a standard Watson-Crick pair and thus not fixed.\n- D proposes G:C after replication 1 on the C-template and then A:T after replication 2 without a mechanistic basis for the transversion from a normal pair.\n- E invokes a repair step generating G:A in a MUTYH-deficient background, and then G:C, which would not yield a fixed mutation and contradicts the deficiency in adenine excision opposite 8-oxoG.\n\nThus, only A correctly describes fixation of a G:C to T:A transversion via replication of the A-containing strand derived from the 8-oxoG:A mispair in a MUTYH-deficient cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2305514"}]}
