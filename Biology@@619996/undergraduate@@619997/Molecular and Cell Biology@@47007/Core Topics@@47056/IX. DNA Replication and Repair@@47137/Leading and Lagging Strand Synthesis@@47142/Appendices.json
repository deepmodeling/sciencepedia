This first practice provides a concrete example by asking you to calculate the total number of ligation events required to replicate a bacterial plasmid. By working through this problem, you will connect the theoretical concepts of bidirectional replication and Okazaki fragments to a tangible, numerical outcome, reinforcing the scale of lagging strand synthesis. [@problem_id:2055294]", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a circular, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) plasmid isolated from a bacterium. The plasmid has a total length of $L = 7260$ base pairs. Replication of this plasmid initiates at a single, specific origin of replication and proceeds bidirectionally, meaning two replication forks move in opposite directions around the circle until they meet.\n\nThe synthesis of the lagging strand is discontinuous, occurring via the formation of Okazaki fragments. For this particular replication system, the average length of a single Okazaki fragment is $S_{frag} = 110$ base pairs. After the RNA primers initiating each fragment are removed and replaced with DNA by a polymerase, the enzyme DNA ligase is required to form a phosphodiester bond to seal the final nick between adjacent fragments, creating a continuous strand.\n\nAssuming one ligation event is required to incorporate each fully formed Okazaki fragment into the growing lagging strand, calculate the total number of ligation events that must occur to complete one full round of replication of the entire plasmid molecule. Your answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "Let the plasmid length be $L$ and the average Okazaki fragment length be $S_{\\text{frag}}$. Replication is bidirectional with two forks; at each fork one strand is synthesized continuously (leading) and the other discontinuously (lagging). Each fork replicates approximately half the plasmid, so the lagging-strand length synthesized per fork is $L/2$. Since there are two forks, the total length synthesized as lagging strand across the entire replication is\n$$\nL_{\\text{lag}}=2\\times \\frac{L}{2}=L.\n$$\nAssuming one ligation event is required to incorporate each fully formed Okazaki fragment, the number of ligation events equals the total number of Okazaki fragments formed.

This problem utilizes a classic approach in molecular biology: a thought experiment involving a mutant enzyme.

To solve this, we must analyze the specific roles of the enzymes involved in processing Okazaki fragments.\n\n**Step 1: Review of Normal Lagging Strand Synthesis**\n\nFirst, let's review the normal sequence of events for joining Okazaki fragments in wild-type *E. coli*:\n1.  **Priming and Elongation**: The enzyme primase synthesizes a short RNA primer on the lagging strand template. DNA Polymerase III then binds to the primer and elongates it by adding deoxyribonucleotides in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction, creating an Okazaki fragment. This synthesis continues until DNA Pol III encounters the $5'$ end of the RNA primer from the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment.\n2.  **Primer Removal and Gap Filling**: DNA Polymerase III dissociates. DNA Polymerase I then binds to the junction. Its role here is twofold, in a process often called nick translation:\n    *   The **$5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease** activity removes the ribonucleotides of the RNA primer of the preceding fragment one by one.\n    *   Simultaneously, the **$5' \\to 3'$ polymerase** activity fills the resulting gap with the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides.\n3.  **Ligation**: After DNA Polymerase I has replaced all the RNA with DNA, a single phosphodiester bond is missing between the $3'$-hydroxyl end of the newly synthesized DNA and the $5'$-phosphate end of the preceding Okazaki fragment. This \"nick\" is sealed by the enzyme **DNA ligase**, which creates the final phosphodiester bond, resulting in a continuous DNA strand.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Effect of the Mutation**\n\nThe problem states that the mutant DNA Polymerase I has lost its **$5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease** activity, but its $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase and $3' \\to 5'$ proofreading activities are intact.\n*   The synthesis of Okazaki fragments by primase and DNA Polymerase III (Step 1) is unaffected. A new Okazaki fragment will be synthesized correctly up to the RNA primer of the previous fragment.\n*   At this point, the mutant DNA Polymerase I will bind to the site. However, because its $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity is missing, it **cannot remove the RNA primer** of the preceding fragment.\n*   Since the primer is not removed, there is no gap for the $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase activity of the enzyme to fill. The polymerase function is intact but has no template gap to work on.\n*   Consequently, the RNA primer remains in place. DNA ligase cannot function here because its substrate is a nick between two DNA strands (a $3'$-OH on one DNA strand and a $5'$-monophosphate on the adjacent DNA strand). It cannot ligate a DNA strand to an RNA strand.\n*   Therefore, the replication process on the lagging strand stalls at this step. The result is the accumulation of fully synthesized but unjoined Okazaki fragments. Each fragment consists of its DNA segment ending right next to the intact RNA primer of the fragment ahead of it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A. Fully synthesized Okazaki fragments separated from each other by gaps of single-stranded DNA where the RNA primers have been removed.** This is incorrect. This structure would accumulate if the $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease of DNA Pol I was functional (to remove the primer) but its $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase activity was defective (unable to fill the gap). This is the opposite of the specified mutation.\n*   **B. A continuous, covalently sealed lagging strand that contains short segments of RNA interspersed within the DNA backbone.** This is incorrect. DNA ligase cannot seal the nick when an RNA primer is present. Therefore, the strand would not be continuous or covalently sealed.\n*   **C. Unprocessed Okazaki fragments, where the DNA of one fragment is adjacent to the intact RNA primer of the preceding fragment, and the two are not covalently joined.** This is the correct description. The DNA of the newly made fragment (let's call it fragment n+1) stops at the $5'$ end of the RNA primer of the previous fragment (fragment n). Because the $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease is inactive, this RNA primer is not removed, and because the primer is not removed, ligation cannot occur. This is the exact intermediate that will accumulate.\n*   **D. A buildup of free, unincorporated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) as DNA synthesis is completely halted on both the leading and lagging strands.** This is incorrect. Leading strand synthesis is continuous and does not require Okazaki fragment processing, so it is largely unaffected by this specific Pol I defect. On the lagging strand, DNA synthesis by Pol III still occurs to create the fragments. The halt is specific to fragment processing, not the initial synthesis, so a general buildup of all dNTPs due to a complete halt is not the primary outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321161"}, {"introduction": "The rules of DNA synthesis, particularly the absolute requirement for a primer's $3'$-hydroxyl group, have profound consequences that extend beyond the mechanics of a single replication fork. This final practice explores one such major implication: the \"end-replication problem\" in organisms with linear chromosomes. By identifying the specific enzymatic activity that is mechanistically constrained at the very end of a lagging strand, you will understand the fundamental reason why linear chromosomes shorten with each replication cycle, a concept central to cellular aging and the biology of telomeres. [@problem_id:2321173]", "problem": "In eukaryotic organisms, the replication of linear chromosomes presents a unique challenge not found in organisms with circular chromosomes. During the synthesis of the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized discontinuously in short segments known as Okazaki fragments, each initiated by an RNA primer. After synthesis, these primers are removed, and the resulting gaps between the fragments are filled with DNA by a DNA polymerase. The final fragments are then joined by DNA ligase.\n\nConsider the very end of a linear chromosome. After the final RNA primer at the $5'$ terminus of the newly synthesized lagging strand is removed, a gap remains. The standard replicative machinery is unable to fill this gap, leading to what is known as the \"end-replication problem.\"\n\nWhich of the following enzymatic activities is directly mechanistically constrained at this specific terminal location, thereby being the fundamental reason the gap cannot be filled?\n\nA.

The addition of deoxyribonucleotides to a pre-existing $3'$-hydroxyl group by DNA polymerase.\nD. The unwinding of the DNA double helix by helicase.\nE. The removal of RNA primers via $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity.", "solution": "The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, each initiated by an RNA primer. DNA polymerase extends each primer by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the primer’s free $3'$-hydroxyl, proceeding in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction. After synthesis, RNA primers are removed and the resulting gaps are filled by a DNA polymerase that extends from an available upstream $3'$-hydroxyl terminus; finally, DNA ligase seals remaining nicks, which are single-strand interruptions with a juxtaposed $3'$-hydroxyl and $5'$-phosphate but no missing nucleotides.\n\nAt the extreme end of a linear chromosome on the lagging strand, removal of the terminal RNA primer at the $5'$ terminus leaves a gap with no upstream DNA fragment to provide a pre-existing $3'$-hydroxyl. The fundamental mechanistic constraint is that DNA polymerases require a pre-existing $3'$-OH to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation: the $3'$-OH of the primer terminus attacks the $\\alpha$-phosphate of an incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, making $5' \\to 3'$ synthesis strictly primer-dependent. In the absence of a $3'$-OH at the chromosome terminus, DNA polymerase cannot initiate DNA synthesis to fill the gap.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- DNA ligase (A) only seals nicks when both a $3'$-OH and a $5'$-phosphate are already adjacent; it cannot fill gaps where nucleotides are missing, so the limitation is upstream of ligase function.\n- Primase (B) can synthesize RNA primers de novo on a DNA template, but at the extreme end the underlying problem remains: any terminal RNA primer, once removed, again leaves no $3'$-OH for DNA polymerase to extend. Thus primase activity is not the mechanistic constraint that prevents filling the terminal gap.\n- DNA polymerase addition to a pre-existing $3'$-OH (C) is directly constrained because no $3'$-OH exists at that terminal location after primer removal.\n- Helicase (D) unwinds duplex DNA and is not impeded by the terminal gap in the context of this problem.\n- The $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity for primer removal (E) is not the limiting step; primers can be removed, which is what creates the terminal problem.\n\nTherefore, the directly constrained enzymatic activity that fundamentally explains why the gap cannot be filled is the addition of deoxyribonucleotides to a pre-existing $3'$-hydroxyl by DNA polymerase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321173"}]}
