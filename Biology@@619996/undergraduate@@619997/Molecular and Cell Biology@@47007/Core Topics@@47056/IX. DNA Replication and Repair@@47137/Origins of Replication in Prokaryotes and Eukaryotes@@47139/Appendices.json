This exercise provides a quantitative comparison between the replication strategies of *E. coli* and a human chromosome to demonstrate why the evolution of multiple origins, combined with different fork speeds, results in different replication times. By calculating the replication times, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for the diverse solutions cells employ for managing large-scale genetic information [@problem_id:2328060].", "problem": "In molecular biology, the process of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication must be completed in a timely manner for cell division. Different organisms employ different strategies to achieve this. Consider a simplified comparison between a prokaryote, *Escherichia coli*, and a typical human chromosome.\n\nThe *E. coli* chromosome is a single circular molecule with a total length of $L_E = 4.6 \\times 10^6$ base pairs. Replication initiates from a single, unique origin of replication. For *E. coli*, assume replication proceeds bidirectionally from the origin, with each of the two replication forks moving at a constant speed of $v_E = 1000$ base pairs per second.\n\nA representative human chromosome is a linear molecule with a length of $L_H = 1.0 \\times 10^8$ base pairs. Replication on this chromosome initiates simultaneously from multiple origins of replication, which are spaced uniformly at a distance of $S_H = 5.0 \\times 10^4$ base pairs from each other. For the human chromosome, replication forks move at a slower constant speed of $v_H = 50$ base pairs per second.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total time required to completely replicate the human chromosome, $T_H$, to the total time required to replicate the *E. coli* chromosome, $T_E$.

The time to replicate a segment of DNA is determined by the distance the fork must travel divided by its speed.\n\nFor the circular *E. coli* chromosome with a single origin, two replication forks move in opposite directions and meet on the other side. Each fork travels half the length of the chromosome. The total time required is:\n$$ T_E = \\frac{L_E / 2}{v_E} = \\frac{L_E}{2v_E} $$\nFor the linear human chromosome, replication initiates simultaneously from multiple origins spaced $S_H$ apart. The forks from adjacent origins move toward each other and meet at the midpoint between them. Therefore, the maximum distance any fork travels is $S_H/2$. The time to replicate the entire chromosome is determined by the time it takes to replicate one such segment:\n$$ T_H = \\frac{S_H / 2}{v_H} = \\frac{S_H}{2v_H} $$\nThe ratio of the replication times is:\n$$ \\frac{T_H}{T_E} = \\frac{S_H / (2v_H)}{L_E / (2v_E)} = \\frac{S_H}{L_E} \\cdot \\frac{v_E}{v_H} $$\nSubstituting the given values: $L_E = 4.6 \\times 10^6$ bp, $v_E = 1000$ bp/s, $S_H = 5.0 \\times 10^4$ bp, and $v_H = 50$ bp/s:\n$$ T_E = \\frac{4.6 \\times 10^6 \\text{ bp}}{2 \\times 1000 \\text{ bp/s}} = 2300 \\text{ s} $$\n$$ T_H = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^4 \\text{ bp}}{2 \\times 50 \\text{ bp/s}} = 500 \\text{ s} $$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{T_H}{T_E} = \\frac{500 \\text{ s}}{2300 \\text{ s}} \\approx 0.21739... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is 0.217.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.217}$$", "id": "2328060"}, {"introduction": "While having many origins solves the speed problem, it creates a new one: control. How does the cell ensure that each of these thousands of origins fires exactly once per S phase? This problem delves into the molecular heart of this regulation by presenting a thought experiment with a mutant version of the Cdc6 protein, a crucial 'licensing factor' [@problem_id:2328101]. Analyzing this scenario will reveal the critical role of protein degradation in preventing catastrophic re-replication and maintaining genome stability.", "problem": "In the eukaryotic cell cycle, DNA replication is tightly regulated to ensure that the entire genome is duplicated exactly once per cycle. In the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) at origins of replication during the G1 phase is a critical step known as \"licensing.\" This complex includes the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), the helicase loading proteins Cdc6 and Cdt1, and the Minichromosome Maintenance (MCM) helicase complex. The transition from G1 to S phase is driven by S-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (S-CDKs). A key function of S-CDKs is to trigger the initiation of replication and simultaneously prevent re-replication within the same cycle. S-CDKs achieve the latter, in part, by phosphorylating several components of the pre-RC, including Cdc6, which marks Cdc6 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.\n\nA research team engineers a haploid yeast strain with a mutant allele of the *CDC6* gene. The resulting Cdc6 protein is fully functional in its role of loading the MCM helicase but cannot be phosphorylated by S-CDKs because the specific serine and threonine residues targeted by these kinases have been mutated to alanine. Assuming the cell can initially enter S phase and begin DNA replication, which of the following phenotypes is the most likely long-term consequence for these mutant cells as they attempt to proceed through the cell cycle?\n\nA. The cells will permanently arrest in the G1 phase because licensed origins cannot be activated.\n\nB. The cells will fail to initiate DNA replication and arrest at the G1/S boundary.\n\nC. The cells will undergo multiple rounds of DNA replication within a single cell cycle, leading to a DNA content significantly greater than 2C.\n\nD. The cells will complete replication normally but will arrest in G2 phase due to a failure to form the mitotic spindle.\n\nE. The cells will proceed through S phase and mitosis, but will produce daughter cells that lack a nucleus.", "solution": "The licensing of replication origins in G1 requires assembly of the pre-replicative complex, in which Cdc6 and Cdt1 load the MCM helicase onto DNA bound by the Origin Recognition Complex. The G1-to-S transition is driven by S-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinases, which both initiate replication and prevent re-licensing, ensuring each origin fires at most once per cell cycle. A key anti-replication mechanism is S-CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc6, which marks Cdc6 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This removes Cdc6 activity outside G1 and thereby prevents reloading of MCM onto DNA after origins have fired.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, Cdc6 is fully functional for helicase loading but lacks S-CDK phosphorylation sites. Therefore:\n1. At the onset of S phase, initiation can proceed because S-CDKs still activate origin firing, and Cdc6 can perform its normal loading role.\n2. Because Cdc6 cannot be phosphorylated by S-CDKs, it is not efficiently ubiquitinated and degraded; thus, Cdc6 remains present and active beyond G1 and during S/G2.\n3. Persistent, active Cdc6 enables aberrant reassembly of pre-RCs and reloading of MCM onto DNA after origins have fired, overriding the normal block to re-licensing.\n4. Consequently, origins can reinitiate within the same cell cycle, causing re-replication and an increase in total DNA content beyond the normal 2C level expected after a single round of replication.\n\nAlternative options do not fit the regulatory logic: licensed origins can still be activated (so no permanent G1 arrest), initiation is not blocked (so no G1/S arrest), spindle defects are unrelated to Cdc6 regulation, and anucleate daughters are not a direct outcome of stabilized Cdc6. The most likely long-term phenotype is re-replication within a single cycle, producing DNA content significantly greater than 2C.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2328101"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of replication must incorporate the reality that biological processes are often stochastic, not deterministic. In eukaryotes, not all potential origins fire in every cell cycle; instead, they have a probability of activation. This problem moves you toward a more sophisticated model of eukaryotic replication by asking you to calculate the probability that a gene is replicated 'passively' by a distant origin, rather than its immediate neighbors [@problem_id:2328088]. This exercise highlights how the probabilistic nature of origin firing contributes to the overall replication dynamics of a chromosome.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication is initiated at multiple sites known as origins of replication (ORIs). The firing of these origins is a stochastic process. Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of a linear eukaryotic chromosome segment. On this segment, there are 10 potential ORIs, indexed $O_1, O_2, \\dots, O_{10}$. These are arranged linearly and are equally spaced 100 kbp (100,000 base pairs) apart.\n\nDuring the S phase of the cell cycle, each of the 10 ORIs has an independent probability, $p = 0.25$, of 'firing' to initiate replication. When an ORI fires, two replication forks are formed, which then proceed in opposite directions along the chromosome at the same constant speed. Replication of any section of DNA is completed as soon as the first replication fork reaches it.\n\nA critical gene, *GeneX*, is located at the exact midpoint between the third origin, $O_3$, and the fourth origin, $O_4$. If *GeneX* is replicated by a fork that did not originate from its immediate neighbors ($O_3$ or $O_4$), it is said to have been replicated 'passively'. This means the replication fork must have initiated at one of the more distant ORIs ($O_1, O_2, O_5, \\dots, O_{10}$).\n\nBased on this model, what is the total probability that *GeneX* is replicated passively? Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let each origin fire independently with probability $p$ and fail to fire with probability $q=1-p$. Because all fired origins produce forks at the same time and all forks have the same speed, the segment containing *GeneX* (located midway between $O_{3}$ and $O_{4}$) will be replicated by the nearest fired origin. Therefore, replication is passive (i.e., not by $O_{3}$ or $O_{4}$) if and only if:\n- neither immediate neighbor fires, and\n- at least one of the remaining eight origins ($O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{5}, \\dots, O_{10}$) fires.\n\nBy independence, the total probability of passive replication is\n$$\nP_{\\text{passive}}=q^{2}\\left[1-q^{8}\\right].\n$$\nWith $p=0.25$ so $q=0.75=\\frac{3}{4}$, this becomes\n$$\nP_{\\text{passive}}=\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{8}\\right]\n=\\frac{9}{16}\\left(1-\\frac{6561}{65536}\\right)\n=\\frac{9}{16}\\cdot\\frac{58975}{65536}\n=\\frac{530775}{1048576}\\approx 0.5061864853\\ldots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5062$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5062}$$", "id": "2328088"}]}
