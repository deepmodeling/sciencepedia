{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway is a sophisticated cellular surveillance system. Its effectiveness hinges on a simple principle: you can't fix what you can't find. This first practice explores the critical initial step of NER—damage recognition—by focusing on the XPC protein complex, the primary sensor for bulky DNA lesions in the global genome sub-pathway. By examining a scenario where this sensor is non-functional, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why accurate damage identification is the essential gateway to the entire repair process [@problem_id:1506424].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a researcher is studying a specific human cell line that has been genetically engineered to possess a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Complementation group C (XPC) protein. The XPC protein is known to be involved in DNA repair. To investigate the consequences of this mutation, the researcher exposes a culture of these cells to a controlled dose of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is known to cause the formation of bulky lesions, primarily pyrimidine dimers, in the DNA.\n\nAssuming the cells are not currently undergoing DNA replication, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of a pyrimidine dimer formed within the genome of one of these cells, specifically in the context of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway?\n\nA. The pyrimidine dimer will be recognized and bound by the transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex, but the DNA around the lesion will not be unwound.\n\nB. The distortion in the DNA helix caused by the pyrimidine dimer will not be recognized, and as a result, the subsequent steps of the repair pathway will not be initiated.\n\nC. The pyrimidine dimer will be recognized and the DNA will be unwound, but the damaged strand will not be incised because the XPC protein itself is the endonuclease responsible for cutting the DNA.\n\nD. The UvrA and UvrB proteins will bind to the pyrimidine dimer, but the repair process will halt because the cells lack the UvrC nuclease.\n\nE. The pyrimidine dimer will be directly reversed by a photolyase enzyme, a process that is independent of the XPC protein.", "solution": "We first recall the distinct roles of the human nucleotide excision repair (NER) subpathways. In global genome NER (GG-NER), helix-distorting lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers are recognized in any genomic region by the XPC complex (XPC with hHR23B and CETN2). In transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), damage in actively transcribed strands is recognized when RNA polymerase II stalls, with initiation mediated by CSA and CSB rather than XPC. After initial lesion recognition, both subpathways converge by recruiting TFIIH (containing XPB and XPD helicases) to unwind DNA around the lesion, followed by verification (XPA, RPA) and dual incision by XPF-ERCC1 (on the 5' side) and XPG (on the 3' side), gap filling by DNA polymerases, and ligation.\n\nGiven a loss-of-function mutation in XPC:\n1) In GG-NER, the initial recognition of helix-distorting lesions is defective, so the distortion caused by a pyrimidine dimer will not be efficiently recognized, and downstream steps (TFIIH recruitment, unwinding, incision, repair synthesis) will not be initiated.\n2) The scenario specifies cells are not undergoing DNA replication; this excludes replication-coupled processes but does not, by itself, ensure active transcription at the lesion. In the absence of ongoing transcription through the lesion, TC-NER would not initiate, leaving the lesion unrecognized in the XPC-deficient GG-NER context.\n3) Evaluate each option:\n- Option A is incorrect because TFIIH-dependent unwinding requires prior damage recognition and recruitment; moreover, TFIIH does unwind DNA once recruited.\n- Option B correctly states that without functional XPC in the GG-NER context, the helix distortion will not be recognized and subsequent repair steps will not initiate.\n- Option C is incorrect because XPC is not the endonuclease; the dual incisions are made by XPF-ERCC1 and XPG.\n- Option D is incorrect because UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC are bacterial NER proteins and are not involved in human NER.\n- Option E is incorrect because human cells lack photolyase-mediated photoreactivation; direct reversal by photolyase does not occur in humans.\n\nTherefore, the immediate fate of a pyrimidine dimer in these XPC-deficient human cells, in the GG-NER context, is failure of lesion recognition and failure to initiate repair, as stated in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1506424"}, {"introduction": "Once a lesion has been identified and the surrounding DNA is unwound, NER employs a pair of \"molecular scissors\" to precisely excise the damaged segment. This exercise moves from conceptual understanding to quantitative analysis, focusing on the specific actions of the XPF-ERCC1 and XPG endonucleases. By calculating the exact size of DNA fragments produced in a simulated laboratory assay, you will practice applying the rules that govern these enzymes and see how their coordinated cuts define the boundaries of the repair patch [@problem_id:1506440].", "problem": "In an in vitro biochemistry experiment designed to study Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), you are provided with a synthetic DNA substrate that mimics the open complex formed around a DNA lesion. The substrate consists of two DNA strands, each 90 nucleotides (nt) in length. The \"top\" strand is radiolabeled exclusively at its 5' end. This top strand is annealed to a complementary \"bottom\" strand, except for a central region where the strands are non-complementary, forming a single-stranded \"bubble\". The bubble on the top strand spans from nucleotide position 41 to position 65, inclusive (nucleotides are numbered 1 to 90 from the 5' end to the 3' end).\n\nYou incubate this substrate in two separate reactions: one with purified human XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease and another with purified human XPG endonuclease. Based on prior structural and functional studies, the specific cleavage activities of these enzymes on this type of substrate are known:\n\n1.  **XPF-ERCC1**: This complex makes a single phosphodiester bond incision on the damaged strand at the 5' side of the bubble. The cut occurs at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 5' side of the nucleotide located 4 bases upstream (towards the 5' end) from the first nucleotide of the single-stranded bubble.\n2.  **XPG**: This enzyme makes a single phosphodiester bond incision on the damaged strand at the 3' side of the bubble. The cut occurs at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 3' side of the nucleotide located 6 bases downstream (towards the 3' end) from the last nucleotide of the single-stranded bubble.\n\nAfter incubation, the reaction products are analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which separates DNA fragments based on their length. Determine the expected lengths, in nucleotides, of the 5'-radiolabeled fragments generated in each of the two reactions. Provide your answer as the length of the fragment from the XPF-ERCC1 reaction and the length of the fragment from the XPG reaction, respectively.", "solution": "The problem asks for the sizes of the 5'-radiolabeled DNA fragments produced after cleavage by XPF-ERCC1 and XPG on a specific DNA substrate. We need to analyze each enzyme's action separately.\n\nThe substrate is a 90-nucleotide (nt) long DNA strand, labeled at its 5' end. Nucleotides are numbered 1 to 90 from the 5' end to the 3' end. The single-stranded bubble extends from nucleotide 41 to 65.\n\nThis means:\n- The 5' double-stranded region is from nucleotide 1 to 40.\n- The single-stranded bubble region is from nucleotide 41 to 65.\n- The 3' double-stranded region is from nucleotide 66 to 90.\n\nA phosphodiester bond \"to the 5' side\" of nucleotide `n` is the bond between nucleotide `n-1` and `n`. A cut at this bond will release a fragment of length `n-1`.\nA phosphodiester bond \"to the 3' side\" of nucleotide `n` is the bond between nucleotide `n` and `n+1`. A cut at this bond on a 5'-labeled strand will release a fragment of length `n`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the fragment size from the XPF-ERCC1 reaction.**\n\nThe rule for XPF-ERCC1 is that it cuts at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 5' side of a specific target nucleotide. This target nucleotide is 4 bases upstream (towards the 5' end) from the first nucleotide of the bubble.\n\n1.  The first nucleotide of the bubble is at position 41.\n2.  Moving 4 bases upstream from position 41 means moving to a smaller nucleotide number. The position of the target nucleotide is $41 - 4 = 37$.\n3.  The enzyme cleaves the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 5' side of this target nucleotide (position 37). This is the bond between nucleotide 36 and nucleotide 37.\n4.  A cut at the bond between nucleotides 36 and 37 will sever the strand into two pieces. Since the strand is labeled at the 5' end (at position 1), the resulting radiolabeled fragment will contain nucleotides 1 through 36.\n5.  Therefore, the length of the radiolabeled fragment produced by XPF-ERCC1 is 36 nucleotides.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the fragment size from the XPG reaction.**\n\nThe rule for XPG is that it cuts at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 3' side of a specific target nucleotide. This target nucleotide is 6 bases downstream (towards the 3' end) from the last nucleotide of the bubble.\n\n1.  The last nucleotide of the bubble is at position 65.\n2.  Moving 6 bases downstream from position 65 means moving to a larger nucleotide number. The position of the target nucleotide is $65 + 6 = 71$.\n3.  The enzyme cleaves the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 3' side of this target nucleotide (position 71). This is the bond between nucleotide 71 and nucleotide 72.\n4.  A cut at the bond between nucleotides 71 and 72 will sever the strand into two pieces. The 5'-labeled fragment will contain all nucleotides from the 5' end up to the point of cleavage. This fragment will contain nucleotides 1 through 71.\n5.  Therefore, the length of the radiolabeled fragment produced by XPG is 71 nucleotides.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nThe problem asks for the lengths of the fragments from the XPF-ERCC1 reaction and the XPG reaction, respectively.\n- Length from XPF-ERCC1 reaction = 36 nt.\n- Length from XPG reaction = 71 nt.\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a pair (36, 71).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 36 & 71 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1506440"}, {"introduction": "After a damaged DNA segment is excised, a DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA to fill the resulting gap. However, the repair is not yet complete. This final practice focuses on the crucial last step: ligation. Using a classic experimental model involving a temperature-sensitive mutation, you will investigate the specific role of DNA ligase and learn to distinguish between a \"gap\" (missing nucleotides) and a \"nick\"—the single phosphodiester bond that ligase must seal to fully restore the integrity of the DNA backbone [@problem_id:1506451].", "problem": "In a laboratory study, a strain of *E. coli* cells is engineered to possess a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding DNA ligase. At a permissive temperature of 30°C, the enzyme functions normally. However, at a non-permissive temperature of 42°C, the DNA ligase protein is completely non-functional, while all other essential cellular proteins, including DNA polymerases and repair endonucleases, function correctly.\n\nThese engineered cells are cultured at the non-permissive temperature of 42°C and then exposed to a brief dose of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is known to cause pyrimidine dimers in DNA. The cells' repair machinery immediately initiates the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway to correct this damage. The NER process successfully proceeds through the initial stages: the distortion caused by the pyrimidine dimer is recognized, endonucleases cleave the damaged strand on either side of the lesion, and the resulting oligonucleotide fragment is removed. This creates a single-stranded gap in the DNA. Following this, DNA polymerase I correctly synthesizes a new stretch of DNA to fill this gap completely, using the complementary, undamaged strand as a template.\n\nGiven the specific inactivation of DNA ligase, what is the final state of the DNA molecule at the site of repair immediately after DNA polymerase I has completed its synthesis activity?\n\nA. A single-stranded gap remains, as DNA polymerase cannot synthesize new DNA without DNA ligase.\n\nB. A double-strand break, where both strands of the DNA helix are severed at the repair site.\n\nC. An abasic site, where a nitrogenous base has been removed but the sugar-phosphate backbone remains unbroken.\n\nD. A nick in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the repaired strand.\n\nE. The pyrimidine dimer persists, as the repair process is halted before its removal.", "solution": "The problem describes a scenario in which Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is initiated, but a key enzyme, DNA ligase, is non-functional. We must determine the state of the DNA after the preceding enzyme, DNA polymerase I, has finished its task.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial events of NER. The problem states that the initial steps of NER occur successfully. This includes:\n1.  Recognition of the pyrimidine dimer.\n2.  Excision of the damaged strand by endonucleases on both sides of the lesion.\n3.  Removal of the single-stranded fragment containing the dimer.\nThis process results in a single-stranded gap in one of the DNA strands. This eliminates option (E), as the pyrimidine dimer has been removed from the DNA.\n\nStep 2: Understand the function of DNA polymerase I in NER. The problem states that DNA polymerase I \"correctly synthesizes a new stretch of DNA to fill this gap completely\". DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl (-OH) end of a pre-existing nucleotide chain. It uses the opposite, intact strand as a template to ensure the correct sequence is inserted. The polymerase adds nucleotides one by one, forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH of the growing chain and the 5'-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. This process continues until the gap is filled with the complementary nucleotides. Since the polymerase fills the gap, option (A) is incorrect. The gap is no longer empty.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the final step of the synthesis phase. When DNA polymerase I adds the very last nucleotide to fill the gap, it creates a new 3'-hydroxyl (-OH) end on this nucleotide. This newly synthesized segment is now adjacent to the 5'-phosphate end of the original, pre-existing DNA strand that was initially downstream of the excised segment. A phosphodiester bond is missing between the 3'-OH of the last nucleotide added by the polymerase and the 5'-phosphate of the adjacent, old nucleotide.\n\nStep 4: Understand the function of DNA ligase. The specific function of DNA ligase is to catalyze the formation of this final phosphodiester bond, sealing the break in the sugar-phosphate backbone. It joins the 3'-hydroxyl end of the newly synthesized DNA segment to the 5'-phosphate end of the existing DNA segment.\n\nStep 5: Determine the consequence of inactive DNA ligase. The problem states that DNA ligase is non-functional. Therefore, while DNA polymerase I successfully fills the gap with the correct nucleotides, the final covalent bond in the backbone cannot be formed. This leaves a break in one strand of the DNA double helix. This specific type of discontinuity—a missing phosphodiester bond in an otherwise intact duplex DNA—is known as a \"nick\". Therefore, the final structure is a DNA molecule with a nick in the backbone of the repaired strand. This corresponds to option (D).\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the remaining incorrect options.\n-   Option (B) is incorrect. A double-strand break involves the severance of both DNA strands. NER is a single-strand repair mechanism; at no point are both strands cut simultaneously at the same location.\n-   Option (C) is incorrect. An abasic site (or AP site) is a location in DNA that has lost the nitrogenous base, leaving an intact sugar-phosphate backbone. This type of lesion is characteristic of the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway, a different repair mechanism from NER. In this NER scenario, the entire nucleotide (base, sugar, and phosphate) is replaced, not just the base.\n\nConclusion: After DNA polymerase fills the gap but before the non-functional DNA ligase can act, the DNA molecule contains a complete set of base-paired nucleotides, but with a single break remaining in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the newly synthesized strand. This is defined as a nick.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1506451"}]}
