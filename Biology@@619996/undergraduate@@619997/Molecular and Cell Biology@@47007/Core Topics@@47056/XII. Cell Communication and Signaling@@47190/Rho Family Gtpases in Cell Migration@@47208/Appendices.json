{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a signaling pathway often begins with a fundamental question: what happens if we force it to be constantly active? This exercise [@problem_id:2336197] explores a classic \"gain-of-function\" scenario, where the molecular switch RhoA is locked in its \"on\" state. By predicting the resulting changes to the cell's internal architecture, you can deduce the primary role of the RhoA signaling axis in governing the actin cytoskeleton.", "problem": "The Rho family of small Guanosine Triphosphatases (GTPases) are central molecular switches that control the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. These proteins cycle between an inactive state when bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and an active state when bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The three most-studied members of this family are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, each orchestrating the formation of distinct actin-based structures.\n\nImagine a cell biology research project where fibroblasts, which are normally motile and possess a dynamic cytoskeleton, are genetically engineered to express a mutant form of the RhoA protein. This mutant, RhoA-Q63L, contains a single amino acid substitution that renders it \"constitutively active,\" meaning it is permanently locked in the GTP-bound \"on\" state and continuously signals to its downstream targets, irrespective of external stimuli.\n\nBased on the known signaling pathways of the Rho family GTPases, which of the following cytoskeletal phenotypes would be the most prominent and characteristic observation in these engineered fibroblasts when compared to a non-engineered control population?\n\nA. A significant increase in the formation of broad, sheet-like membrane protrusions known as lamellipodia, driven by the assembly of a dense, branched actin network at the cell's leading edge.\n\nB. A dramatic enhancement of thick, contractile actin-myosin bundles, known as stress fibers, that traverse the cytoplasm and terminate at focal adhesions.\n\nC. The extensive formation of thin, parallel-bundled, finger-like protrusions called filopodia, which extend from the cell surface to sense the environment.\n\nD. A complete and global depolymerization of all F-actin structures, causing the cell to become spherical and lose all cytoskeletal integrity.\n\nE. A pronounced change in the microtubule network, characterized by the rapid and uncontrolled polymerization of tubulin, leading to abnormally long and stable microtubules, while the actin cytoskeleton remains largely unaffected.", "solution": "We identify the molecular state and downstream signaling of the engineered protein. The mutant RhoA-Q63L is GTPase-deficient and remains locked in the GTP-bound active form. In its active state, RhoA preferentially engages effectors such as ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinases) and formins (e.g., mDia). ROCK increases actomyosin contractility by increasing myosin II activity through two complementary mechanisms: direct phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain and inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase via phosphorylation of MYPT1. In parallel, formins promote linear actin polymerization, favoring the formation of parallel, contractile actin bundles. Together, these effects produce robust, thick actin-myosin bundles that span the cell and anchor into focal adhesions—classical stress fibers—and promote focal adhesion maturation.\n\nWe next map each option to the canonical Rho family GTPase functions:\n- Lamellipodia (broad, sheet-like protrusions driven by branched Arp2/3 networks) are primarily induced by Rac1 through the WAVE regulatory complex, not by RhoA; thus option A does not match constitutive RhoA activation.\n- Stress fibers and focal adhesions are the hallmark of RhoA activation via ROCK and formins; thus option B directly matches the expected phenotype.\n- Filopodia (thin, parallel bundles) are classically induced by Cdc42 via WASP and Arp2/3 (and sometimes formins), not predominantly by RhoA; thus option C is inconsistent as the most prominent phenotype.\n- Global depolymerization of F-actin is not a canonical outcome of RhoA activation; on the contrary, RhoA enhances actomyosin assembly and contractility; thus option D is incorrect.\n- RhoA signaling primarily targets the actin cytoskeleton, not microtubules; although actin-microtubule crosstalk exists, a dominant phenotype of microtubule hyperpolymerization with an unaffected actin cytoskeleton is not characteristic of RhoA activation; thus option E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, constitutive activation of RhoA in fibroblasts most prominently yields dramatic enhancement of thick, contractile stress fibers terminating at focal adhesions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2336197"}, {"introduction": "Once we know the general function of a pathway, the next step is to dissect its internal machinery. This problem [@problem_id:2336217] simulates a pharmacological experiment, a common strategy in cell biology, where a specific downstream enzyme in the RhoA pathway is inhibited. This challenges you to trace the signaling cascade and predict how breaking a single link affects the final output, providing a deeper understanding of how RhoA's signal is transmitted to produce a cellular response.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanisms of cell migration in cultured human fibroblasts. The formation of contractile actin-myosin bundles, known as stress fibers, is a critical component of this process. The formation of these fibers is tightly regulated by a signaling pathway involving the Rho family of small GTPases.\n\nThe pathway begins when an extracellular signal activates the protein RhoA, converting it from an inactive GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound state. Active RhoA then binds to and activates its downstream effector, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). ROCK, in turn, promotes the assembly of stress fibers through a dual mechanism affecting myosin II activity. First, ROCK directly phosphorylates and activates the Myosin Light Chain (MLC), a key regulatory component of myosin II. Second, ROCK phosphorylates and inactivates another enzyme, Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP), which would otherwise remove the activating phosphate group from MLC. The net result of ROCK activation is a sustained, high level of phosphorylated MLC, leading to active myosin II and the formation of stable stress fibers.\n\nTo probe this pathway, the biologist treats the fibroblasts with Y-27632, a highly specific pharmacological inhibitor of ROCK's kinase activity. Assuming the inhibitor is fully effective, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and immediate consequence of this treatment on the fibroblast cytoskeleton?\n\nA. A decrease in the formation of actin-myosin stress fibers due to reduced myosin II activity.\n\nB. An increase in stress fiber formation due to compensatory activation of other signaling pathways.\n\nC. A global depolymerization of all actin filaments in the cell, leading to a loss of cell shape.\n\nD. An increase in the phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP), enhancing its activity.\n\nE. A significant increase in the activity of RhoA to counteract the inhibition of its downstream effector.", "solution": "We proceed by tracing the defined signaling pathway and applying the principle that inhibiting a kinase immediately reduces phosphorylation of its substrates and releases phosphatase targets from inhibitory phosphorylation.\n\n1) In the untreated state, an extracellular cue converts RhoA to its active GTP-bound form. Active RhoA activates ROCK. ROCK exerts two key effects on myosin II regulation:\n- Direct substrate activation: ROCK phosphorylates Myosin Light Chain (MLC), increasing myosin II ATPase activity and promoting myosin II filament assembly. This increases $[MLC\\text{-}P]$.\n- Phosphatase inhibition: ROCK phosphorylates and inactivates Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP), thereby decreasing the dephosphorylation rate of MLC. This further sustains $[MLC\\text{-}P]$.\n\n2) The formation and maintenance of actin-myosin stress fibers require active myosin II. A necessary biochemical condition for high myosin II activity is a sufficiently high fraction of phosphorylated MLC, i.e., elevated $[MLC\\text{-}P]$.\n\n3) Treatment with Y-27632 specifically inhibits ROCK kinase activity. By the definition of a kinase inhibitor, the immediate effects are:\n- The ROCK-dependent phosphorylation rate of MLC decreases, lowering the production of $MLC\\text{-}P$.\n- The inhibitory phosphorylation of MLCP by ROCK is reduced, which relieves inhibition of MLCP and thus increases the effective dephosphorylation rate acting on MLC. Consequently, removal of phosphate from MLC is facilitated.\n\n4) Combining these two effects yields a net and immediate decrease in $[MLC\\text{-}P]$. Since myosin II activity depends on MLC phosphorylation, myosin II activity decreases, which directly reduces contractility needed for stress fiber assembly and maintenance.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Consistent with the immediate biochemical consequence of ROCK inhibition: reduced myosin II activity due to decreased $[MLC\\text{-}P]$ leads to decreased stress fibers. This matches the direct effect.\n- B: Speculative compensatory pathways are not the most direct or immediate outcome.\n- C: ROCK inhibition does not globally depolymerize all actin; actin polymerization in lamellipodia and other structures can persist independently of ROCK.\n- D: Incorrect in sign and mechanism. ROCK inhibition decreases phosphorylation of MLCP; moreover, phosphorylation by ROCK inactivates MLCP, so increased phosphorylation would not enhance its activity.\n- E: Upstream RhoA activation is not the immediate direct consequence of pharmacological ROCK inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is decreased stress fiber formation due to reduced myosin II activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2336217"}, {"introduction": "Advanced understanding of cellular regulation requires appreciating not just what a pathway does, but also what it *doesn't* do. This practice problem [@problem_id:2336226] uses a highly specific biological toxin to inactivate the RhoA subfamily while leaving other related GTPases untouched. This scenario tests your ability to differentiate the specific functions of RhoA from those of its cousins, Rac1 and Cdc42, forcing you to consider the cell's cytoskeleton as a system regulated by multiple, parallel inputs.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the distinct roles of the Rho family of small GTPases in the context of fibroblast motility and cytoskeletal organization. The experimental design involves culturing fibroblasts on a fibronectin-coated surface, which promotes cell spreading and adhesion. To specifically probe the function of the RhoA/B/C subfamily, the researcher introduces C3 transferase from *Clostridium botulinum* into the cells. This enzyme is known to specifically catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of a key asparagine residue in RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, which locks them in an inactive, GDP-bound state. Crucially, the activity of other prominent Rho family members, such as Rac1 and Cdc42, is not directly affected by the C3 transferase.\n\nAfter allowing sufficient time for the C3 transferase to act, which of the following sets of observations most accurately describes the expected changes to the fibroblast's cytoskeleton and overall morphology when compared to untreated control cells?\n\nA. The cells exhibit a significant increase in thick, prominent stress fibers and enhanced contractility, leading to a smaller, more polarized cell shape.\n\nB. The cells are unable to form lamellipodia at the cell periphery, leading to a loss of leading-edge ruffling, but they maintain their internal stress fibers and focal adhesions.\n\nC. The cells undergo a complete depolymerization of the entire actin cytoskeleton, resulting in a fully rounded, non-adherent cell that detaches from the substrate.\n\nD. The cells lose their contractile actin stress fibers and show reduced cell body contractility, but they are still capable of forming lamellipodia and filopodia, often resulting in a flattened, spread-out morphology with prominent protrusions but a relaxed cell body.\n\nE. The cells lose the ability to form fine, finger-like filopodia, impairing their ability to sense the environment, but show normal levels of stress fibers and lamellipodia formation.", "solution": "The manipulation is the introduction of C3 transferase, which selectively ADP-ribosylates and inactivates RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC by locking them in the GDP-bound state. This specifically inhibits signaling downstream of the RhoA/B/C subfamily without directly affecting Rac1 or Cdc42.\n\nRhoA/B/C normally promote:\n- Actomyosin contractility via ROCK, which increases myosin light chain phosphorylation both by directly phosphorylating myosin light chain and by inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase, thereby enhancing contractility.\n- Formation and maintenance of actin stress fibers through ROCK-mediated contractility and mDia-mediated linear actin polymerization.\n- Maturation of focal adhesions, which depend on tension generated by actomyosin.\n\nRac1 and Cdc42, which are not inhibited by C3 transferase, promote:\n- Rac1: lamellipodia and membrane ruffling through Arp2/3 activation via WAVE.\n- Cdc42: filopodia through formins and Ena/VASP, and polarity signaling.\n\nTherefore, predicted consequences of RhoA/B/C inhibition:\n1. Reduced ROCK activity leads to decreased myosin light chain phosphorylation and increased relaxation of the actomyosin network, lowering cell body contractility.\n2. Loss or marked reduction of prominent contractile stress fibers due to diminished tension and reduced mDia-driven linear filament assembly in stress fibers.\n3. Reduced focal adhesion maturation and stability because of lower tension, although initial adhesions may still form.\n4. Preservation of Rac1- and Cdc42-dependent protrusive structures, so lamellipodia and filopodia formation remain possible and can even appear prominent relative to the relaxed cell body.\n5. Overall morphology shifts toward a flattened, spread-out cell with pronounced protrusions (lamellipodia and filopodia) but lacking thick stress fibers and exhibiting a relaxed, less contractile cell body.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Increased stress fibers and contractility would result from Rho activation, not inhibition; incorrect.\n- B: Loss of lamellipodia implies Rac1 inhibition; incorrect, since Rac1 is unaffected.\n- C: Complete actin depolymerization and detachment is too extreme and not characteristic of selective Rho inhibition; incorrect.\n- D: Loss of stress fibers and reduced contractility with preserved lamellipodia and filopodia, yielding a spread, protrusive but relaxed morphology; correct.\n- E: Loss of filopodia implies Cdc42 inhibition; incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2336226"}]}
