This first practice focuses on the \"sender\" component in a bacterial quorum sensing circuit. By considering a hypothetical scenario involving a mutation in the autoinducer synthase gene [@problem_id:2090444], you will explore the direct and essential role that signal production plays in coordinating group behavior.", "problem": "Quorum Sensing (QS) is a system of stimulus and response correlated to population density that many bacteria use to coordinate gene expression. The marine bacterium *Vibrio fischeri* uses a well-studied QS system to control bioluminescence. At high cell densities, each bacterium produces and secretes a small signaling molecule, an Acyl-Homoserine Lactone (AHL), which serves as an autoinducer. The synthesis of this AHL molecule is catalyzed by the enzyme LuxI. When the extracellular concentration of AHL reaches a critical threshold, it diffuses back into the cells and binds to the transcriptional regulator protein, LuxR. The AHL-LuxR complex then activates the transcription of the *lux* operon, which contains the genes for the luciferase enzyme and other components necessary for light production.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *Vibrio fischeri* that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the *luxI* gene, rendering the LuxI enzyme completely non-functional. Assume that all other genes, including *luxR* and the entire *lux* operon, are wild-type and fully functional. A pure culture of this *luxI* mutant strain is grown in a suitable liquid medium until it reaches a very high cell density, a condition that would cause a wild-type culture to be strongly bioluminescent.\n\nWhich one of the following phenotypes will this high-density culture of the *luxI* mutant strain exhibit?\n\nA. The culture will not produce light.\n\nB. The culture will produce light, but at a much lower intensity compared to the wild-type.\n\nC. The culture will produce light, but only after a significantly longer incubation period at high density.\n\nD. The culture will produce light constitutively, even at low cell densities.\n\nE. The cells in the culture will be unable to grow and divide to reach a high density.", "solution": "Quorum sensing in wild-type Vibrio fischeri relies on LuxI-catalyzed synthesis of the autoinducer AHL, which accumulates extracellularly and, upon reaching a threshold, binds LuxR to form an AHL–LuxR complex that activates the lux operon, leading to luciferase expression and light production.\n\nLet $[A](t)$ denote the extracellular AHL concentration and $N$ the cell density. In a well-mixed culture, a minimal phenomenological mass-balance for AHL is\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = \\alpha N - k [A],\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the per-cell AHL production rate (catalyzed by LuxI) and $k$ represents effective loss by degradation/dilution. For the luxI loss-of-function mutant, LuxI is non-functional, so\n$$\n\\alpha = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k[A].\n$$\nWith no exogenous AHL added and starting from $[A](0)=0$, the solution satisfies $[A](t)=0$ for all $t$, and more generally, the steady state satisfies\n$$\n0 = -k[A] \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad [A]=0.\n$$\nThus, even at very high $N$, the production term remains zero and $[A]$ cannot accumulate.\n\nLuxR activation depends on AHL binding. For a simple one-to-one binding model, the fractional occupancy of LuxR by AHL is\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_{d} + [A]},\n$$\nwith $K_{d}$ the dissociation constant. With $[A]=0$, we obtain\n$$\n\\theta = 0,\n$$\nso LuxR remains unliganded, and the AHL–LuxR complex does not form. Therefore, there is no activation of the lux operon and no induction of luciferase expression; the culture remains dark.\n\nEvaluating the answer choices:\n- A: The culture will not produce light. This matches the conclusion above.\n- B and C: These require some AHL synthesis or accumulation over time; however, with $\\alpha=0$, no amount of time or density rescues AHL levels in a pure culture.\n- D: Constitutive light at low density would require LuxR activation without AHL or constitutive lux expression, which is not the case here.\n- E: Growth to high density is unrelated to LuxI-mediated AHL synthesis; QS is not essential for viability in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotype is no light production.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090444"}, {"introduction": "A key feature of quorum sensing is that the signaling molecule is public, shared across the entire microbial community. This next exercise builds on the concept of a synthesis-deficient mutant by asking a crucial question: can a cell that cannot \"speak\" still \"listen\"? This thought experiment [@problem_id:2334721] uses the classic technique of a \"conditioned medium\" to test your understanding of how an external supply of autoinducer can rescue a mutant phenotype, thereby distinguishing signal synthesis from signal response.", "problem": "A species of marine bacterium, *Aliivibrio fischeri*, uses a cell-to-cell communication system called quorum sensing to control bioluminescence. The mechanism relies on several key components. First, an enzyme called an autoinducer synthase produces a small, diffusible signaling molecule, the autoinducer (AI). As the bacterial population density increases, the concentration of the AI in the surrounding environment builds up. When the AI concentration surpasses a certain threshold, it freely diffuses back into the bacterial cells and binds to a specific receptor protein. This AI-receptor complex then functions as a transcription factor, activating the expression of a set of target genes responsible for light production.\n\nConsider two strains of this bacterium:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT) Strain:** This strain has a complete, functional set of genes for the autoinducer synthase, the receptor, and the light-producing machinery. When grown in a liquid culture, it begins to glow brightly only after the population reaches a high density.\n2.  **Mutant Strain ($\\Delta syn$):** This strain has a non-functional gene for the autoinducer synthase, meaning it cannot produce the AI molecule. However, its genes for the receptor protein and the light-producing machinery are fully functional.\n\nAn experiment is conducted as follows: A culture of the WT strain is grown until it reaches a high cell density and is brightly bioluminescent. The bacterial cells are then carefully removed from this culture using a filter with pores too small for bacteria to pass through. The resulting cell-free liquid, known as \"conditioned medium,\" is collected. A small number of cells from the $\\Delta syn$ mutant strain, which do not produce light when grown alone, are then inoculated into this sterile conditioned medium and incubated under a normal growth regimen.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed for the $\\Delta syn$ mutant strain culture?\n\nA. The $\\Delta syn$ cells will grow, but the culture will remain dark regardless of cell density because the cells cannot produce their own autoinducer.\n\nB. The $\\Delta syn$ cells will grow, and the culture will become bioluminescent, but only after the mutant cell population itself reaches a high density.\n\nC. The $\\Delta syn$ cells will grow, and the culture will become bioluminescent shortly after inoculation, even while the cell density is still low.\n\nD. The conditioned medium from the WT culture will inhibit the growth of the $\\Delta syn$ cells, and the culture will fail to grow and will remain dark.\n\nE. The $\\Delta syn$ cells will mutate and revert to the wild-type phenotype, producing their own autoinducer and glowing only at high density.", "solution": "Define $a_{e}$ as the extracellular autoinducer (AI) concentration, $a_{i}$ as the intracellular AI concentration, $a^{*}$ as the threshold AI concentration required to activate bioluminescence, $r$ as the total receptor concentration per cell, $K_{d}$ as the receptor–AI dissociation constant, and $c$ as the concentration of the active receptor–AI complex. Let $a_{0}$ denote the AI concentration present in the conditioned medium prepared from the high-density, brightly bioluminescent wild-type (WT) culture.\n\nPrinciple 1 (quorum sensing threshold): The WT culture being brightly bioluminescent implies that the AI concentration present at steady state satisfies $a_{0} \\ge a^{*}$, where $a^{*}$ is the threshold for activation of the luminescence genes.\n\nPrinciple 2 (free diffusion): The AI is a small, diffusible molecule that equilibrates across the cell membrane, so diffusion drives $a_{i} \\to a_{e}$ on a short timescale $\\tau \\sim \\ell^{2}/D$, where $\\ell$ is a characteristic membrane thickness and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Thus, shortly after inoculation of $\\Delta syn$ cells into the conditioned medium, $a_{i} \\approx a_{e} = a_{0}$.\n\nPrinciple 3 (law of mass action for receptor binding): Receptor–ligand binding obeys $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$. With $[R]_{\\text{tot}} = r$ and $[A] = a_{i}$, the concentration of active complex is\n$$\nc = [RA] = \\frac{r\\,a_{i}}{K_{d} + a_{i}}.\n$$\nActivation of the luminescence genes occurs when $c \\ge c^{*}$ for some threshold $c^{*}$ that corresponds to $a_{i} \\ge a^{*}$ via the monotonic relation above.\n\nApplication to the experiment: Inoculating a small number of $\\Delta syn$ cells (which lack AI synthase but have intact receptor and light machinery) into the WT conditioned medium sets $a_{e} = a_{0}$ immediately, independent of the $\\Delta syn$ cell density $N$. By diffusion, $a_{i} = a_{0} \\ge a^{*}$ shortly after inoculation. Therefore\n$$\nc = \\frac{r\\,a_{0}}{K_{d} + a_{0}} \\ge \\frac{r\\,a^{*}}{K_{d} + a^{*}},\n$$\nwhich by the definition of the WT activation threshold is sufficient to satisfy $c \\ge c^{*}$, thus turning on transcription of the light-production genes without requiring the mutant population to reach high density.\n\nExcluding alternatives: \n- Option A is false because exogenous AI in the conditioned medium compensates for the lack of AI synthesis in $\\Delta syn$.\n- Option B is false because the activation depends on $a_{e}$, which is already high; it does not require the $\\Delta syn$ population to build AI.\n- Option D is false because the AI is a signaling molecule, not an inhibitor of growth; conditioned medium is cell-free and not expected to be bactericidal.\n- Option E is unnecessary and highly improbable on the experimental timescale; no reversion is required when exogenous AI is provided.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is that the $\\Delta syn$ cells will grow and the culture will become bioluminescent shortly after inoculation, even at low cell density.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334721"}, {"introduction": "Beyond observing and interpreting quorum sensing, a major goal in microbiology and biotechnology is to control it.

The key components of this system are:\n1.  **LuxI-like synthase**: An enzyme that synthesizes an autoinducer molecule, an Acyl-Homoserine Lactone (AHL).\n2.  **LuxR-like receptor**: An intracellular protein that acts as a transcriptional regulator.\n\nThe system functions as follows: at a high population density, the concentration of the AHL autoinducer increases, allowing it to diffuse into the cells and bind to the LuxR-like receptor. The resulting AHL-receptor complex undergoes a conformational change that activates it. This activated complex then binds to a specific promoter region on the bacterial chromosome, thereby inducing the transcription of genes responsible for pigment production.\n\nA bioengineer synthesizes a novel molecule, named Quorum Blocker-7 (QB-7), which is a structural analog of the natural AHL autoinducer. Experimental characterization reveals two key properties of QB-7:\n1.  It reversibly binds to the same site on the LuxR-like receptor as the natural AHL, but with a significantly higher affinity.\n2.  The binding of QB-7 to the LuxR-like receptor does not induce the necessary conformational change for the receptor to become a transcriptionally active complex.\n\nA culture of *Chromobacterium novum* is grown to a high cell density, a condition under which it would normally produce a deep purple pigment. This culture is then treated with a high concentration of QB-7. Which of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed?\n\nA. The bacterial culture will remain colorless or show significantly reduced pigment production compared to an untreated high-density culture.\n\nB. The bacterial culture will produce the purple pigment at an even higher intensity than an untreated high-density culture.\n\nC. The addition of QB-7 will have no observable effect, and the culture will produce pigment as expected for a high-density population.\n\nD. The bacterial culture will begin producing pigment immediately upon addition of QB-7, regardless of the cell density.\n\nE. The concentration of the natural AHL in the culture medium will decrease rapidly, leading to a loss of pigment production.", "solution": "Let $R$ denote the LuxR-like receptor, $L$ the natural AHL autoinducer, and $Q$ the antagonist QB-7.
