By analyzing a hypothetical experiment where $PLC$ is inhibited, you will solidify your understanding of how the signal is transduced from the plasma membrane to the cell's interior. This practice highlights the indispensable role of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) as the second messenger that directly triggers intracellular calcium release [@problem_id:2344056].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a signaling pathway in cultured hepatocytes (liver cells). They use a peptide hormone that binds to a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) on the cell surface. This binding typically triggers a cascade that results in a rapid and significant increase in the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) within the cytosol, primarily by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. In a key experiment, a batch of hepatocytes is pre-treated with a chemical compound, \"Inhibitor-X,\" which is known to be a highly specific antagonist of the enzyme Phospholipase C (PLC). When the hormone is added to these pre-treated cells, the expected rise in cytosolic calcium does not occur.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate molecular explanation for this experimental observation?\n\nA. Inhibitor-X prevents the G-protein from dissociating into its alpha and beta-gamma subunits, thereby halting the entire signaling cascade at its initial step.\n\nB. Inhibitor-X blocks the production of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), which is the necessary second messenger for opening calcium channels on the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nC. Inhibitor-X prevents the generation of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which is required to bind to and open ligand-gated calcium channels on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.\n\nD. Inhibitor-X directly binds to and physically obstructs the calcium channels located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, preventing calcium efflux regardless of the signaling state.\n\nE. Inhibitor-X enhances the activity of plasma membrane calcium pumps, causing any released calcium to be immediately ejected from the cell before it can accumulate in the cytosol.", "solution": "The peptide hormone binds a GPCR that, in hepatocytes, typically couples to the $G_{q}$ pathway. Upon receptor activation, the heterotrimeric G protein dissociates into $G_{\\alpha q}$ and $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$. The $G_{\\alpha q}$ subunit directly activates Phospholipase C-$\\beta$ (PLC). Activated PLC hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_{2}$) to generate two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_{3}$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\n$IP_{3}$ diffuses through the cytosol and binds to $IP_{3}$ receptors, which are ligand-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Binding of $IP_{3}$ opens these channels, leading to release of $Ca^{2+}$ from ER stores and a rapid increase in cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration. Therefore, generation of $IP_{3}$ by PLC is the necessary upstream step for ER $Ca^{2+}$ release in this pathway.\n\nIn the experiment, Inhibitor-X is a highly specific antagonist of PLC. Blocking PLC prevents the hydrolysis of $PIP_{2}$, thereby preventing the formation of $IP_{3}$. Without $IP_{3}$, $IP_{3}$ receptors on the ER do not open, so $Ca^{2+}$ is not released into the cytosol, explaining the absence of the expected $Ca^{2+}$ rise.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is not the most direct explanation because Inhibitor-X targets PLC, not the G protein dissociation step.\n- B is incorrect because cAMP is produced by adenylyl cyclase and is not the principal second messenger that opens ER $Ca^{2+}$ channels in this pathway; the relevant messenger is $IP_{3}$, not cAMP.\n- C correctly states that PLC inhibition prevents $IP_{3}$ generation, thus preventing opening of $IP_{3}$-gated ER $Ca^{2+}$ channels.\n- D contradicts the specificity given (PLC antagonist) and posits a different mechanism.\n- E proposes enhanced plasma membrane $Ca^{2+}$ extrusion, which would not prevent the initial ER release; moreover, it is inconsistent with Inhibitor-Xâ€™s defined target.\n\nThus, the most direct and accurate molecular explanation is that PLC inhibition prevents $IP_{3}$ production, blocking $IP_{3}$-mediated ER $Ca^{2+}$ release.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344056"}, {"introduction": "Proper cellular signaling requires not only an 'on' switch but also a reliable 'off' switch. This scenario explores the consequences of a dysfunctional G protein, where the intrinsic ability to hydrolyze $GTP$ is lost. By considering the effect of a persistently active G protein, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the critical role of $GTPase$ activity in terminating the signal and preventing pathological overstimulation [@problem_id:2344040].", "problem": "In vascular smooth muscle cells, the hormone vasopressin binds to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), initiating a signaling cascade. This specific receptor is coupled to a heterotrimeric Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Gq family. Upon hormone binding, the receptor activates the Gq protein by promoting the exchange of Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on its alpha subunit (Gq-alpha). The activated, GTP-bound Gq-alpha subunit then dissociates from its beta-gamma partners and activates its downstream effector, the enzyme Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC, in turn, cleaves a membrane lipid to produce second messengers that lead to muscle contraction. The signaling event is terminated when the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gq-alpha subunit hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, causing it to re-associate with the beta-gamma subunits and return to its inactive state.\n\nConsider a rare genetic mutation in the *GNAQ* gene, which encodes the Gq-alpha subunit. This mutation completely abolishes the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gq-alpha protein without affecting its ability to bind GTP or interact with PLC.\n\nIf these mutant smooth muscle cells are continuously exposed to vasopressin, what would be the expected long-term state of Phospholipase C (PLC) activity?\n\nA. PLC will be completely inactive because the Gq-alpha subunit cannot hydrolyze GTP.\n\nB. PLC will show a brief, transient activation similar to normal cells, followed by a return to baseline inactivity.\n\nC. PLC will be constitutively and persistently activated.\n\nD. PLC will be initially activated but then rapidly inhibited by a negative feedback mechanism independent of GTP hydrolysis.\n\nE. The Gq-alpha subunit will be unable to dissociate from the GPCR, preventing it from ever reaching PLC.", "solution": "The core biochemical principle is the heterotrimeric G protein cycle controlled by nucleotide state: the GPCR functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that promotes GDP release and GTP binding on $G\\alpha_{q}$, which activates $G\\alpha_{q}$; termination requires intrinsic GTP hydrolysis on $G\\alpha_{q}$ to regenerate the GDP-bound inactive state.\n\nIn normal cells, vasopressin binding to its Gq-coupled GPCR promotes exchange of GDP for GTP on $G\\alpha_{q}$. The $G\\alpha_{q}\\text{-GTP}$ dissociates from $G\\beta\\gamma$ and activates phospholipase C, commonly $PLC\\beta$, which cleaves $PIP_{2}$ into $IP_{3}$ and $DAG$, leading to downstream signaling (e.g., calcium release and contraction). The signal is terminated when the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G\\alpha_{q}$ hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, allowing re-association with $G\\beta\\gamma$ and cessation of PLC activation.\n\nIn the mutant described, the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G\\alpha_{q}$ is completely abolished, while GTP binding and $PLC$ interaction are intact. Therefore:\n- Upon vasopressin stimulation, the receptor will still catalyze GDP-GTP exchange, creating $G\\alpha_{q}\\text{-GTP}$.\n- Because GTP hydrolysis is abolished, $G\\alpha_{q}$ will not convert back to the GDP-bound inactive form.\n- Consequently, $G\\alpha_{q}$ will remain dissociated from $G\\beta\\gamma$ and continue to bind and activate $PLC$ persistently.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because inability to hydrolyze GTP prevents termination, not activation; GTP binding and PLC interaction are intact, so PLC will not be inactive.\n- B is incorrect because the return to baseline requires GTP hydrolysis, which is absent; thus activation will not be merely transient.\n- C is correct because $G\\alpha_{q}\\text{-GTP}$ persists, keeping $PLC$ constitutively and persistently activated.\n- D is incorrect because the principal termination mechanism for $G\\alpha_{q}$ is GTP hydrolysis; although other feedbacks exist, the question specifies the key change abolishing the central off-switch, implying persistent activation.\n- E is incorrect because the mutation does not impair dissociation from the GPCR; after GTP binding, $G\\alpha_{q}$ dissociates and can reach $PLC$.\n\nTherefore, the expected long-term state of PLC activity is persistent activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2344040"}, {"introduction": "One of the most remarkable features of signal transduction is amplification, where a single initial event triggers a massive downstream response.
