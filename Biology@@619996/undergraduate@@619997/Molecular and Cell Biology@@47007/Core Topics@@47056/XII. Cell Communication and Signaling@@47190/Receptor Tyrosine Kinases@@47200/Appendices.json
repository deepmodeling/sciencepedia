{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand a complex machine, it's often helpful to see what happens when one component fails. In cell biology, genetic mutations serve as our \"thought experiments\" to dissect signaling pathways. This first practice [@problem_id:2311547] explores the heart of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) activation by asking you to predict the outcome of a very specific modification: removing the phosphorylation sites on the receptor's tail. This will test your understanding of the precise sequence of events, from ligand binding to the recruitment of downstream effector proteins.", "problem": "In a cellular biology laboratory, researchers are investigating a signal transduction pathway initiated by a specific growth factor. This pathway relies on a transmembrane protein known as a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). The standard activation of this RTK involves the binding of the growth factor, which causes two receptor monomers to form a dimer. This dimerization activates the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor's intracellular domain, leading each monomer to phosphorylate the other on several specific tyrosine residues located on its cytoplasmic tail. These phosphotyrosine sites then serve as docking platforms for various downstream intracellular signaling proteins, which propagate the signal.\n\nTo probe the mechanism, the researchers create a genetically engineered version of the cell line. In this mutant cell line, the gene for the RTK has been altered such that every single tyrosine residue on the intracellular cytoplasmic tail has been replaced with an alanine residue. Alanine is an amino acid that cannot be phosphorylated. The researchers then expose both the normal (wild-type) and the mutant cell lines to a high concentration of the growth factor.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence of this mutation on the RTK signaling process immediately following the addition of the growth factor?\n\nA. The growth factor will fail to bind to the extracellular domain of the mutant RTK.\n\nB. The mutant RTK monomers will not be able to form a dimer in the presence of the growth factor.\n\nC. The intracellular kinase domains of the mutant RTK dimer will not be activated.\n\nD. The mutant RTK dimer will form and its kinase domains will be active, but no downstream signaling proteins will be recruited to the receptor.\n\nE. The mutant RTK will be constitutively active, leading to continuous signaling even in the absence of the growth factor.", "solution": "We identify the sequence of RTK signaling events and assess which steps depend on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail versus other domains.\n\nStep 1: Ligand binding. The growth factor binds the extracellular domain. This process depends on the extracellular ligand-binding domain and is independent of cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues. Therefore, replacing cytoplasmic tail tyrosines with alanines does not prevent ligand binding. This rules out option A.\n\nStep 2: Receptor dimerization. Ligand-induced dimerization is mediated by conformational changes and interactions in the extracellular domain (and sometimes transmembrane/juxtamembrane regions). Cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues are not required for dimerization. Therefore, dimerization still occurs in the mutant. This rules out option B.\n\nStep 3: Kinase activation. Dimerization juxtaposes the intracellular kinase domains, enabling activation. Activation often involves trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop within the kinase domain, which are not part of the cytoplasmic tail. The mutation specifically targets tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail, not the kinase domain. Thus, the intrinsic kinase domains can still become activated upon dimerization. This rules out option C.\n\nStep 4: Creation of docking sites and recruitment of downstream effectors. In wild-type RTKs, the activated kinases phosphorylate multiple tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail, generating phosphotyrosine motifs that are recognized by SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins. In the mutant, all tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail are replaced by alanine, which cannot be phosphorylated, so no phosphotyrosine docking sites can be formed on the tail. Consequently, downstream signaling proteins cannot be recruited to the receptor despite active kinase domains and successful dimerization.\n\nStep 5: Constitutive activity assessment. Alanine substitution of tail tyrosines does not induce ligand-independent dimerization or kinase activity. Therefore, the receptor is not constitutively active in the absence of ligand. This rules out option E.\n\nTherefore, immediately after growth factor addition, the mutant RTK will bind ligand, dimerize, and activate its kinase domains, but fail to recruit downstream signaling proteins due to the absence of phosphorylatable tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail. This corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2311547"}, {"introduction": "Receptor proteins are not monolithic entities but are composed of distinct functional modules, or domains, much like building blocks. Molecular biologists can create \"chimeric\" proteins by swapping these domains between different receptors to probe their function. This exercise [@problem_id:2334988] presents you with one such chimera, combining the ligand-binding part of one receptor with the signaling part of another. Your challenge is to predict the cell's response, which requires a clear grasp of which domain controls ligand specificity versus which dictates the downstream physiological outcome.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a line of engineered cells is created that expresses a novel chimeric receptor protein. This receptor is constructed by fusing the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the human Insulin Receptor (IR). These specialized cells do not express any other native EGFR or IR proteins. The cells are initially maintained in a culture medium devoid of both Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and insulin. The experiment is then initiated by adding a sufficient concentration of EGF to the culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most direct and primary physiological consequence that would be observed in these cells following the addition of EGF?\n\nA. Activation of the Ras/MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway, a hallmark of canonical EGF receptor signaling.\n\nB. The receptor binds insulin with high affinity, initiating a metabolic signaling cascade.\n\nC. Increased uptake of glucose from the medium, mediated by the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane.\n\nD. The receptor fails to undergo autophosphorylation because EGF cannot allosterically activate the insulin receptor's kinase domain.\n\nE. The cells are stimulated to proliferate but show no significant change in their rate of glucose metabolism.", "solution": "- The engineered receptor is a chimera with the extracellular domain from EGFR and the transmembrane plus intracellular domains from the insulin receptor (IR). Ligand-binding specificity is determined by the extracellular domain; intracellular signaling output is determined by the intracellular domain.\n- Upon addition of EGF, the EGFR extracellular domain will bind EGF. In canonical EGFR, EGF binding induces receptor dimerization, which juxtaposes intracellular kinase domains for trans-autophosphorylation. In the chimera, EGF-induced dimerization of the EGFR ectodomains will similarly bring together the IR intracellular kinase domains, enabling their trans-autophosphorylation and activation. Therefore, autophosphorylation should occur rather than fail, contradicting option D.\n- Because the intracellular domain is that of the IR, the downstream signaling will follow insulin receptor pathways. The IR primarily signals via IRS proteins to PI3K, generating PIP3 and activating PDK1 and Akt. A principal physiological consequence of IR-Akt signaling in insulin-responsive cells is phosphorylation of AS160 (TBC1D4) and consequent translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, increasing glucose uptake. This is the hallmark metabolic effect of insulin receptor activation. Hence, the most direct and primary physiological consequence expected here is increased glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation (option C).\n- The receptor will not bind insulin with high affinity because ligand binding is determined by the EGFR extracellular domain, so option B is incorrect.\n- While the Ras/MAPK pathway can also be engaged downstream of IR via Shc/Grb2/SOS, option A frames this as a hallmark of canonical EGFR signaling; in the chimera, the dominant signaling identity is IR-like, and the most characteristic primary physiological readout is metabolic (glucose uptake), not specifically a canonical EGFR proliferative program, making C the better answer.\n- Option E is inconsistent with the IR intracellular domain, which drives metabolic effects, notably increased glucose uptake, rather than exclusively proliferation without metabolic change.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence after adding EGF is increased glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334988"}, {"introduction": "Signaling pathways must be tightly regulated, and disruptions can lead to disease. One way signaling can be blocked is through \"dominant-negative\" mutations, where a faulty protein interferes with the function of the normal version. This final practice [@problem_id:2334993] moves from qualitative prediction to quantitative analysis. By co-expressing a normal RTK with a catalytically \"dead\" mutant, you will calculate the precise reduction in signaling capacity, providing a concrete example of how the principles of probability and receptor dimerization govern cellular responses.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a cell line is genetically engineered to study the signaling pathway of a specific Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). This engineered cell line co-expresses two versions of the receptor: the normal, wild-type (WT) version and a mutant (MT) version. The mutant RTK contains a point mutation in the ATP-binding site of its intracellular kinase domain, which renders it catalytically inactive; it cannot phosphorylate any substrates. However, the mutation does not affect the mutant receptor's ability to bind its extracellular ligand or to form dimers with other receptors.\n\nThe total surface expression level of RTKs (WT plus MT) in the engineered cell line is the same as in a control cell line that only expresses the WT receptor. In the engineered cell line, the expression level of the MT receptor is precisely three times that of the WT receptor. Upon stimulation with a saturating concentration of the ligand, receptors on the cell surface randomly form dimers. A downstream signaling cascade is initiated only by fully active dimers, which are defined as WT-WT homodimers in which each receptor partner can reciprocally phosphorylate the other (trans-autophosphorylation). Heterodimers (WT-MT) and mutant homodimers (MT-MT) are considered completely non-functional for signal initiation.\n\nCalculate the maximal signaling output of the engineered cell line, expressed as a fraction of the maximal signaling output of the control cell line.

In the engineered cell line, let $W$ be the number of wild-type (WT) receptors and $M$ the number of mutant (MT) receptors. The conditions give $M=3W$ and $W+M=T$, hence $W=T/4$ and $M=3T/4$. Upon saturating ligand, receptors randomly form dimers; the total number of dimers in each line is $T/2$. Only WT-WT dimers are fully active.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of WT receptors among all receptors in the engineered line:\n$$\np=\\frac{W}{T}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nUnder random pairing, the probability that both monomers in a dimer are WT is $p^{2}$.
