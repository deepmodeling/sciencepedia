Heterotrimeric G proteins must be tethered to the plasma membrane to receive signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This exercise challenges you to think like a cell biologist and consider the structural basis of this localization, focusing on the crucial role of post-translational lipid modifications. By exploring a hypothetical mutation [@problem_id:2318321], you will connect a specific molecular feature—the isoprenyl anchor on the $G_{\\gamma}$ subunit—to the protein's overall cellular address and its ability to participate in signaling.", "problem": "Heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of $G_{\\alpha}$, $G_{\\beta}$, and $G_{\\gamma}$ subunits, are crucial intracellular signaling molecules that associate with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. In their inactive state, the three subunits form a stable $G_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$ trimer. This membrane association is primarily mediated by post-translational lipid modifications. The $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit is typically modified with a myristoyl or palmitoyl group, and the $G_{\\gamma}$ subunit is modified with an isoprenyl group (a process called isoprenylation or prenylation). These lipid anchors insert into the hydrophobic core of the plasma membrane. The $G_{\\beta}$ subunit does not possess a lipid anchor and is tightly bound to the $G_{\\gamma}$ subunit, forming a $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer that functions as a single unit.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line where a mutation in the gene for the $G_{\\gamma}$ subunit prevents its isoprenylation. All other components, including the $G_{\\alpha}$ and $G_{\\beta}$ subunits and the machinery for their synthesis and modification, function normally. Assuming that the $G_{\\alpha}$, $G_{\\beta}$, and mutant $G_{\\gamma}$ subunits can still assemble into a trimer, where would you predominantly expect to find the fully assembled, inactive $G_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$ trimer in these cells?\n\nA. Tightly associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.\n\nB. Freely diffusing in the cytosol.\n\nC. Within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nD. Embedded within the outer mitochondrial membrane.\n\nE. Secreted into the extracellular space.", "solution": "We analyze the membrane association of heterotrimeric G proteins, which depends on lipid modifications on specific subunits. In the inactive state, the $G_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$ trimer associates with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through lipid anchors: $G_{\\alpha}$ typically carries a myristoyl and often a palmitoyl group, while $G_{\\gamma}$ is isoprenylated. The $G_{\\beta}$ subunit lacks a lipid anchor but binds tightly to $G_{\\gamma}$, forming the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer. Thus, in wild-type cells, the effective membrane anchoring is provided by at least two lipid inserts: one on $G_{\\alpha}$ and one on $G_{\\gamma}$ (carrying $G_{\\beta}$ with it).\n\nIn the engineered cell, $G_{\\gamma}$ cannot be isoprenylated. This removes the lipid anchor from $G_{\\gamma}$, and since $G_{\\beta}$ has no lipid modification, the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer lacks membrane anchoring capacity. Although $G_{\\alpha}$ still possesses its lipid modification(s), a single lipid anchor on $G_{\\alpha}$ is typically insufficient to stably retain the entire $G_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$ trimer at the plasma membrane; the absence of the $G_{\\gamma}$ isoprenyl group markedly reduces overall membrane affinity of the complex. Therefore, even if the trimer can assemble, it will not be tightly membrane-bound and will predominantly localize in the cytosol, undergoing free diffusion.\n\nBy exclusion, it will not be in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (these are cytosolic/peripheral membrane proteins without signal peptides), not embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane (no targeting sequences for mitochondrial membranes), and not secreted (no passage through the secretory pathway). The lack of the $G_{\\gamma}$ lipid anchor also precludes tight association with the inner leaflet. Hence, the predominant localization is the cytosol.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318321"}, {"introduction": "Watching molecules interact in a living cell was once the realm of science fiction, but modern techniques make it possible. This practice explores Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a powerful tool that acts like a molecular ruler to measure the distance between proteins. You will apply this concept to the core event of G protein activation—the dissociation of the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit from the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer—by predicting the outcome of a FRET experiment [@problem_id:2318342]. This exercise will strengthen your understanding of both G protein dynamics and the principles of modern experimental cell biology.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying the activation dynamics of a specific signal transduction pathway involving a heterotrimeric G protein. This G protein consists of three subunits: $G_{\\alpha}$, $G_{\\beta}$, and $G_{\\gamma}$. In its inactive state, the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit is bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and forms a stable complex with the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer. When an associated G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) is activated by an external ligand, it catalyzes the exchange of GDP for Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) on the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit. This exchange induces a conformational change, causing the GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit to dissociate from the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer. Both the $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP monomer and the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer can then interact with downstream effector proteins.\n\nTo monitor this dissociation event in living cells, the biologist employs a technique called Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). FRET is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules (fluorophores), a donor and an acceptor. The efficiency of this energy transfer is highly dependent on the distance between the donor and acceptor, being significant only when they are in very close proximity (typically less than 10 nanometers).\n\nIn this experiment, the biologist genetically engineers the cells to express a modified $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit fused to a Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), which acts as the FRET donor. Additionally, the $G_{\\beta}$ subunit is fused to a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), which acts as the FRET acceptor. The FRET signal is quantified by exciting the donor (CFP) and measuring the intensity of the light emitted by the acceptor (YFP). An increase in YFP emission upon CFP excitation indicates a high FRET efficiency (close proximity), while a decrease indicates low FRET efficiency (greater distance).\n\nThe biologist places the engineered cells in a culture dish and begins monitoring the FRET signal. At time `t = 0`, a high concentration of the specific ligand that activates the GPCR is added to the culture medium. Assuming the G proteins are all initially in their inactive state, how would you expect the FRET signal (the intensity of YFP emission) to change immediately after the addition of the ligand?\n\nA. The FRET signal will increase and then stabilize at a higher level.\n\nB. The FRET signal will decrease and then stabilize at a lower level.\n\nC. The FRET signal will remain unchanged.\n\nD. The FRET signal will oscillate with a constant period.\n\nE. The FRET signal will briefly decrease and then return to its original level.", "solution": "The physical principle governing the readout is Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), whose efficiency between donor and acceptor fluorophores separated by distance $r$ is\n$$\nE(r)=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{0}}\\right)^{6}},\n$$\nwhere $R_{0}$ is the Förster radius characteristic of the donor–acceptor pair. The measured acceptor (YFP) emission upon donor (CFP) excitation increases with $E$, so higher $E$ yields higher YFP intensity.\n\nInitially, the heterotrimer $G_{\\alpha}\\text{-GDP} \\cdot G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ is intact. Because the donor (CFP on $G_{\\alpha}$) and the acceptor (YFP on $G_{\\beta}$) reside on associated subunits, the donor–acceptor distance is small, say $r_{\\text{initial}}\\lesssim R_{0}$, which gives a relatively high FRET efficiency:\n$$\nE_{\\text{initial}}=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{initial}}}{R_{0}}\\right)^{6}}\\quad\\text{(high)}.\n$$\n\nAt time $t=0$, addition of a high concentration of ligand activates the GPCR, which catalyzes GDP–GTP exchange on $G_{\\alpha}$. The GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha}$ dissociates from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$, increasing the donor–acceptor separation to $r_{\\text{final}}\\gg r_{\\text{initial}}$, typically $r_{\\text{final}}\\gtrsim R_{0}$ or larger.

Consequently, the FRET signal transitions from its initial high level to a lower level corresponding to the dissociated steady state and then stabilizes there under continued stimulation (modulo slow regulatory processes). Therefore, the expected behavior is a decrease in the FRET signal followed by stabilization at a lower level.\n\nHence the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318342"}, {"introduction": "An effective signal is not only one that can be turned on, but one that can be reliably turned off. For G proteins, the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit serves as a built-in timer, ensuring the signal is temporary. This problem asks you to consider the consequences of a broken \"off\" switch by analyzing a mutation that eliminates this crucial GTPase function [@problem_id:2318344]. By working through this scenario, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how signal termination is essential for normal cell function and why its failure can lead to disease.", "problem": "In a typical cell signaling pathway, a ligand binds to a G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR), causing the receptor to activate a nearby heterotrimeric G protein. This G protein consists of three subunits: $G_{\\alpha}$, $G_{\\beta}$, and $G_{\\gamma}$. In its inactive state, the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit is bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and is associated with the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer. Upon activation by the GPCR, the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit releases GDP and binds Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). This exchange triggers the dissociation of the $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP complex from the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer, and the activated $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP complex then interacts with a downstream effector protein, initiating a cellular response. The signaling event is terminated when the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit's intrinsic Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) activity hydrolyzes the bound GTP back to GDP, allowing $G_{\\alpha}$ to re-associate with $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a specific somatic mutation completely eliminates the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit, rendering it non-functional, but does not affect its ability to bind GTP or interact with the GPCR and effector proteins. What would be the most direct consequence of this mutation for the signaling pathway following a single, brief exposure to the activating ligand?\n\nA. The signal would fail to initiate because the G protein cannot be activated.\n\nB. The downstream effector protein would be constitutively activated, leading to a prolonged or permanent signal.\n\nC. The $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit would be unable to dissociate from the GPCR after activation.\n\nD. The $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer would remain permanently bound to the mutated $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit.\n\nE. The G protein would be unable to bind to GTP, preventing any signal from being transduced.", "solution": "Step 1: In the canonical GPCR pathway, ligand-bound GPCR acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the heterotrimeric G protein. Specifically, it promotes release of GDP from $G_{\\alpha}$ and binding of GTP, yielding the active $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP. This activation causes dissociation of $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and enables $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP to bind and regulate a downstream effector. Signal termination requires the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G_{\\alpha}$ to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, which inactivates $G_{\\alpha}$ and allows reassociation with $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$.\n\nStep 2: In the mutation described, the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G_{\\alpha}$ is completely eliminated, but GTP binding and interactions with GPCR and effectors remain intact. Therefore, upon a single brief ligand exposure:\n- The GPCR still induces GDP release and GTP binding on $G_{\\alpha}$, forming active $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP.\n- $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP still dissociates from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and engages the downstream effector.\n- Because intrinsic GTPase activity is absent, $G_{\\alpha}$-GTP cannot hydrolyze GTP to GDP, so it fails to inactivate and fails to reassociate with $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ via the normal cycle.\n\nStep 3: The most direct consequence is that the downstream effector remains activated by persistently GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha}$. This yields a prolonged, potentially constitutive signal even after the brief ligand pulse has ended.\n\nStep 4: Elimination of alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect: activation still occurs because GTP binding is intact.\n- Option C is incorrect: $G_{\\alpha}$ normally dissociates from the GPCR after nucleotide exchange; this step is unaffected.\n- Option D is incorrect: $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dissociates upon $G_{\\alpha}$ activation and would not remain permanently bound.\n- Option E is incorrect: the mutation does not impair GTP binding.\n\nThus, the correct choice is prolonged or constitutive activation of the downstream effector.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318344"}]}
