This practice explores the pivotal role of the G-protein's intrinsic GTPase activity as the \"off switch\" in the cyclic AMP ($cAMP$) pathway. By considering a hypothetical scenario where this switch is broken [@problem_id:2337592], you will develop a deeper intuition for how G-proteins function as tightly regulated molecular timers.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying a cell line that expresses a specific G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which, upon binding its hormone ligand, activates the Gs signaling pathway. In a normal cell, ligand binding causes the associated Gs protein's alpha subunit (Gs-alpha) to release guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The GTP-bound Gs-alpha subunit then activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The signaling is terminated when the Gs-alpha subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP back to GDP, causing it to become inactive.\n\nThe biologist then engineers a new cell line with a specific mutation in the gene for the Gs-alpha subunit. This mutation renders the Gs-alpha protein completely incapable of hydrolyzing GTP, although it can still bind GTP and activate adenylyl cyclase normally.\n\nIf these mutated cells are briefly exposed to the hormone ligand and then the ligand is washed away, which of the following statements best describes the expected long-term concentration of intracellular cAMP compared to that in a normal cell treated in the same way?\n\nA. The cAMP level will be significantly lower than in a normal cell.\n\nB. The cAMP level will show no significant change from the basal, unstimulated level.\n\nC. The cAMP level will increase transiently and then return to the basal level, just like in a normal cell.\n\nD. The cAMP level will rise and then remain persistently high, well above the basal level.\n\nE. The cAMP level will oscillate with a high frequency.", "solution": "Ligand binding to a Gs-coupled receptor promotes GDP-GTP exchange on the Gs alpha subunit, producing an active GTP-bound Gs-alpha that stimulates adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP. Termination in a normal cell relies on the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gs-alpha, which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning Gs-alpha to its inactive form and stopping adenylyl cyclase stimulation.\n\nLet $A(t)$ denote the effective concentration of active, GTP-bound Gs-alpha after a brief ligand pulse and washout. In a normal cell, $A(t)$ decays back to zero due to GTP hydrolysis, with a characteristic rate constant $k_{h}>0$, so $A(t)\\to 0$ after the pulse. In the mutant cell, the GTPase activity is abolished, so the hydrolysis rate is effectively zero, $k_{h}=0$, and the GTP-bound state persists; after the brief stimulus loads Gs-alpha with GTP, $A(t)$ remains at a positive value $A_{0}>0$ for long times, because there is no intrinsic mechanism to return Gs-alpha to the GDP-bound inactive state.\n\nLet $C(t)$ denote intracellular cAMP concentration. The dynamics can be modeled as\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}=k_{\\text{AC}}\\,A(t)-k_{\\text{PDE}}\\,C+b,\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{AC}}$ is the proportionality constant for adenylyl cyclase production driven by active Gs-alpha, $k_{\\text{PDE}}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant due to phosphodiesterases, and $b$ is basal cAMP production independent of Gs signaling.\n\nIn a normal cell, after the brief pulse and washout, $A(t)\\to 0$, so the long-term steady state satisfies\n$$\n0=-k_{\\text{PDE}}\\,C_{\\text{ss,normal}}+b \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad C_{\\text{ss,normal}}=\\frac{b}{k_{\\text{PDE}}},\n$$\nwhich is the basal, unstimulated level. In the mutant cell, after the brief pulse, $A(t)=A_{0}>0$ persists, so the long-term steady state satisfies\n$$\n0=k_{\\text{AC}}\\,A_{0}-k_{\\text{PDE}}\\,C_{\\text{ss,mut}}+b \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad C_{\\text{ss,mut}}=\\frac{k_{\\text{AC}}\\,A_{0}+b}{k_{\\text{PDE}}},\n$$\nwhich is strictly greater than the basal value $\\frac{b}{k_{\\text{PDE}}}$ because $A_{0}>0$ and $k_{\\text{AC}}>0$. Thus, after an initial rise, cAMP remains persistently elevated above basal rather than returning to baseline.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that cAMP will rise and then remain persistently high, well above the basal level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2337592"}, {"introduction": "The production of a second messenger like $cAMP$ is only half the story; the cell must then interpret this chemical signal to produce a physiological response. This exercise focuses on Protein Kinase A (PKA), the primary effector of $cAMP$, and its elegant mechanism of activation. Analyzing the consequences of a mutation that prevents the dissociation of its subunits [@problem_id:2350290] highlights the critical importance of allosteric regulation in translating a $cAMP$ signal into downstream protein phosphorylation.", "problem": "In a particular type of neuron, a genetic mutation affects the function of Protein Kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme in signal transduction. PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme, normally composed of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunits inhibit the catalytic subunits in the absence of a secondary messenger. In this mutated neuron, the regulatory subunits are incapable of dissociating from the catalytic subunits, even in the presence of high concentrations of the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nIf a neurotransmitter binds to a G-protein coupled receptor on this neuron's membrane, leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and a subsequent, significant increase in intracellular cAMP concentration, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and certain consequence of the specified PKA mutation?\n\nA.

The catalytic subunits of PKA will become constitutively active, phosphorylating targets even at basal cAMP levels.\n\nD. The breakdown of cAMP by phosphodiesterases will be significantly accelerated.\n\nE. The G-protein will remain indefinitely bound to the neurotransmitter receptor.", "solution": "We analyze the normal mechanism of Protein Kinase A (PKA) activation and the effect of the specified mutation. PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme denoted $R_{2}C_{2}$, composed of two regulatory subunits $R$ and two catalytic subunits $C$. In the absence of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), the $R$ subunits inhibit the $C$ subunits by direct binding, keeping kinase activity off. Upon an increase in intracellular cAMP, cAMP binds to the $R$ subunits, inducing a conformational change that causes dissociation of $R$ from $C$, thereby releasing the catalytic subunits $C$ to phosphorylate downstream substrates on serine/threonine residues.\n\nIn the mutated neuron, the $R$ subunits are incapable of dissociating from the $C$ subunits even at high cAMP. Therefore, even when a neurotransmitter activates a G-protein coupled receptor, stimulating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cAMP, the $R$ subunits remain bound to and inhibit the $C$ subunits. Hence, PKA catalytic activity remains off and PKA cannot phosphorylate its downstream targets.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A states that downstream substrate proteins normally targeted by PKA will not be phosphorylated. This follows directly from the continued inhibition of $C$ by $R$ despite elevated cAMP; thus, PKA activity is absent and substrates are not phosphorylated. This is the most direct and certain consequence.\n- Option B posits premature termination of cAMP production by negative feedback. While PKA can participate in feedback (e.g., by phosphorylating components that regulate cAMP levels), the mutation reduces PKA activity; it does not directly cause accelerated termination of cAMP production. This is not a direct consequence and is in the wrong direction.\n- Option C claims constitutive activation of the catalytic subunits at basal cAMP levels. This contradicts the mutation, which locks $R$ to $C$, preventing activation.\n- Option D suggests accelerated breakdown of cAMP by phosphodiesterases. PKA can phosphorylate and modulate phosphodiesterases, but with PKA inactive, such activation would be reduced, not accelerated.\n- Option E claims the G-protein remains indefinitely bound to the receptor. G-protein cycling depends on GTP binding and hydrolysis and receptor kinases/arrestins, not directly on PKA dissociation mechanics; this is not a certain or direct consequence of the specified mutation.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and certain consequence is that PKA targets are not phosphorylated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2350290"}, {"introduction": "To study signaling pathways, scientists develop assays that translate molecular events into measurable outputs.
