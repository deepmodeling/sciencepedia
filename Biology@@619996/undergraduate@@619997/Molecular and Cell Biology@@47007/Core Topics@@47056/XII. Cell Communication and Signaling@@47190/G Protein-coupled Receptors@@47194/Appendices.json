This first practice uses a thought experiment involving a genetic \"knockout\" to explore what happens when a critical link in the chain—the $G_{s\\alpha}$ subunit—is removed from a well-established physiological pathway. By tracing the signal and identifying the point of failure, you will solidify your understanding of the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit's indispensable role as a transducer between the receptor and its downstream effector [@problem_id:2295714].", "problem": "In liver cells, the hormone glucagon regulates blood glucose levels by initiating a signaling cascade that leads to the breakdown of glycogen. This process is mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The normal pathway is as follows: Glucagon binds to its specific GPCR, which activates an associated heterotrimeric G protein known as $G_s$. The alpha subunit of this G protein, $G_{s\\alpha}$, then activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). High levels of cAMP then activate Protein Kinase A (PKA), which in turn initiates a phosphorylation cascade culminating in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, the enzyme responsible for glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown).\n\nConsider an experiment involving genetically engineered liver cells in which the gene encoding the $G_{s\\alpha}$ subunit has been completely knocked out (i.e., the cells do not produce any $G_{s\\alpha}$ protein). These cells are then treated with a high concentration of glucagon. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected effect on glycogen breakdown in these engineered cells compared to the basal (unstimulated) rate?\n\nA. Glycogen breakdown will be maximally and permanently activated.\n\nB. Glycogen breakdown will be stimulated to the same extent as in normal cells treated with glucagon.\n\nC. The addition of glucagon will have no stimulatory effect, and glycogen breakdown will remain at its basal rate.\n\nD. Glycogen breakdown will be inhibited to a level significantly below the normal basal rate.\n\nE. The cell will adapt by using the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ subunit to directly activate glycogen phosphorylase, leading to a delayed but significant increase in glycogen breakdown.", "solution": "We begin from the defined signaling sequence in normal liver cells: glucagon binds its GPCR, which couples to a heterotrimeric G protein of the Gs class. The critical effector-activating subunit is $G_{s\\alpha}$, which, upon ligand-induced receptor activation, exchanges GDP for GTP and then directly activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then catalyzes ATP $\\to$ cAMP, raising intracellular cAMP, which activates PKA, leading via a phosphorylation cascade to activation of glycogen phosphorylase and increased glycogenolysis.\n\nFormally, the causal chain in normal cells can be summarized as:\n$\\text{Glucagon} + \\text{GPCR} \\xrightarrow{\\text{activate}} G_{s\\alpha} \\xrightarrow{\\text{activate}} \\text{adenylyl cyclase} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ATP} \\to \\text{cAMP}} \\text{PKA activation} \\xrightarrow{\\text{phosphorylation cascade}} \\text{glycogen phosphorylase activation} \\xrightarrow{} \\text{increased glycogen breakdown}.$\n\nIn the engineered cells, the gene encoding $G_{s\\alpha}$ is completely knocked out, so no $G_{s\\alpha}$ protein is produced. The immediate consequence is that, even if glucagon binds the GPCR, the receptor cannot produce an active $G_{s\\alpha}$-GTP complex. Therefore:\n1) There is no $G_{s\\alpha}$ to activate adenylyl cyclase.\n2) Without adenylyl cyclase activation, the rate of ATP $\\to$ cAMP conversion does not increase above basal levels.\n3) Without an increase in cAMP, PKA activity does not rise above its basal activity.\n4) Without increased PKA activity, the phosphorylation cascade does not intensify, so glycogen phosphorylase is not further activated beyond basal.\n5) Consequently, glycogen breakdown remains at its basal (unstimulated) rate when glucagon is added.\n\nConsidering alternative subunits and compensatory mechanisms:\n- $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$, while capable of modulating certain ion channels and specific effectors, does not substitute for $G_{s\\alpha}$ in activating adenylyl cyclase in the glucagon pathway. Thus, there is no plausible rerouting that would yield a delayed or significant increase in cAMP or direct activation of glycogen phosphorylase.\n- The absence of $G_{s\\alpha}$ does not create an inhibitory signal below basal; it merely prevents the stimulatory arm from being engaged. Basal glycogenolysis persists due to baseline intracellular signaling and enzyme activities independent of glucagon-triggered Gs activation.\n\nTherefore, upon addition of glucagon to these $G_{s\\alpha}$-null cells, the expected effect is no stimulation above basal; glycogen breakdown remains at the basal rate.\n\nThis matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2295714"}, {"introduction": "Just as important as turning a signal on is the ability to turn it off, which prevents an excessive or prolonged cellular response. This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario where the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit’s intrinsic “off-switch”—its GTPase activity—is disabled by a mutation. Analyzing this scenario is crucial for understanding how cells terminate signals and how disruptions in this process can lead to pathological conditions characterized by continuous signaling [@problem_id:2295709].", "problem": "Consider a typical signal transduction pathway involving a G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR). In its inactive state, the associated heterotrimeric G protein consists of an $\\alpha$ subunit bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP), and $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ subunits. Upon binding of an extracellular ligand to the GPCR, the receptor activates the G protein by promoting the exchange of GDP for Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) on the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit. The GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit then dissociates from the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer and activates a downstream effector enzyme, initiating a cellular response. The signaling is terminated when the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit, which possesses intrinsic GTPase activity, hydrolyzes the bound GTP back to GDP, causing it to re-associate with the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer and return to its inactive state.\n\nNow, imagine a cell line is discovered to have a specific genetic mutation that completely eliminates the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit, but does not affect any other aspect of the protein's function, including its ability to bind GTP and interact with the GPCR and the effector enzyme.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the signaling pathway in these mutant cells after it has been stimulated by the ligand at least once?\n\nA. The effector enzyme will be constitutively active, leading to a continuous cellular response even in the absence of the ligand.\n\nB. The G protein will be unable to dissociate from the GPCR, preventing further signal amplification.\n\nC. The $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit will remain permanently bound to the $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ dimer, thus being unable to activate the effector enzyme.\n\nD.
