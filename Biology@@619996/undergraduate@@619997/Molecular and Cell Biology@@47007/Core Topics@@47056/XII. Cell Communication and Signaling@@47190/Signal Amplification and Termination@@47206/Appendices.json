{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A crucial aspect of cell signaling is the ability to terminate the response, ensuring it is transient and proportional to the stimulus. This is often achieved through molecular \"switches\" with built-in timers. This foundational exercise [@problem_id:2338151] explores the consequences of disabling one of the most common termination mechanisms in biology: the GTPase activity of a G-protein. By considering a hypothetical scenario using a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, you will solidify your understanding of how this molecular clock functions to turn signals off.", "problem": "In a typical G-protein signaling pathway, a hormone binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor, causing the associated heterotrimeric G-protein to release its bound Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and bind a molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). This binding activates the G-protein, which then modulates the activity of an effector enzyme. The signal is naturally terminated when the G-protein's intrinsic GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, rendering the G-protein inactive.\n\nConsider an experimental study on isolated hepatocytes (liver cells) that respond to the hormone glucagon. The glucagon signal transduction pathway involves the activation of a G-protein that stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Activated adenylyl cyclase produces the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) to initiate a cascade leading to glycogen breakdown.\n\nIn this experiment, the hepatocytes are treated with a brief pulse of glucagon to initiate signaling. Simultaneously, the cells are supplied with a high concentration of Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP-gamma-S), a synthetic analog of GTP. A key feature of GTP-gamma-S is that it can bind to G-proteins in the same manner as GTP, but it is resistant to hydrolysis by the G-protein's intrinsic GTPase activity.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the glucagon signaling pathway within these cells a short time after the initial stimulus?\n\nA. The G-protein will be unable to bind to the glucagon receptor, preventing any signal initiation from occurring.\n\nB. The G-protein will become constitutively active, leading to a sustained and high-level production of cAMP.\n\nC. The adenylyl cyclase enzyme will be continuously inhibited, causing a rapid decrease in intracellular cAMP levels below the basal state.\n\nD. The concentration of intracellular cAMP will oscillate, as the cell attempts to counteract the effect of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog.\n\nE. The G-protein will fail to dissociate from its beta and gamma subunits after binding GTP-gamma-S, thus preventing the activation of adenylyl cyclase.", "solution": "Glucagon binds its G-protein-coupled receptor, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This catalyzes the release of GDP from the heterotrimeric G protein and promotes binding of GTP to the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit. The GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha s}$ dissociates from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Under normal conditions, the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G_{\\alpha s}$ hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, which terminates signaling by allowing reassociation with $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and cessation of adenylyl cyclase stimulation.\n\nIn the presence of GTP-gamma-S, which binds in place of GTP but is resistant to hydrolysis by the intrinsic GTPase of $G_{\\alpha s}$, the termination step (GTP to GDP hydrolysis) is blocked. Therefore, once $G_{\\alpha s}$ binds GTP-gamma-S, it remains locked in the active, GTP-bound conformation and stays dissociated from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$. As a result, adenylyl cyclase remains persistently stimulated, so cAMP production continues at a high rate. Although phosphodiesterases degrade cAMP, sustained production by continuously active adenylyl cyclase drives intracellular cAMP to remain elevated above basal levels a short time after stimulation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because receptor-G protein coupling and nucleotide exchange still occur; GTP-gamma-S does not prevent receptor coupling.\n- B is correct because non-hydrolyzable binding locks $G_{\\alpha s}$ in the active state, producing sustained, high cAMP.\n- C is incorrect because $G_{\\alpha s}$ stimulates, not inhibits, adenylyl cyclase.\n- D is incorrect because there is no mechanism here to induce oscillations; the dominant effect is persistent activation.\n- E is incorrect because GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha s}$ normally dissociates from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$; non-hydrolyzability does not prevent this dissociation.\n\nThus, the glucagon signaling pathway will be constitutively active downstream of the G protein, leading to sustained and high-level production of cAMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338151"}, {"introduction": "Many cellular responses are governed by the dynamic equilibrium between activating enzymes, like kinases, and deactivating enzymes, like phosphatases.

This practice will help you apply first-order kinetic principles to calculate how quickly a signaling pathway reaches its maximum output once its \"off-switch\" is removed.", "problem": "Consider a simplified signal transduction pathway within a cell. A target protein, denoted as T, is activated when it is phosphorylated by a specific kinase, K, and deactivated when it is dephosphorylated by a specific phosphatase, P. The biological activity of protein T is directly proportional to the fraction of the total T protein population that is in its phosphorylated state.\n\nInitially, the system is in a dynamic steady state where the rate of phosphorylation by K is balanced by the rate of dephosphorylation by P. In this state, 10.0% of the total protein T is in the phosphorylated (active) state.\n\nAt time $t = 0$, a highly specific inhibitor drug is introduced into the system. This drug instantly and completely deactivates all molecules of phosphatase P, while having no effect on kinase K or protein T.\n\nThe phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the kinase K is observed to follow first-order kinetics with respect to the concentration of unphosphorylated T.

This single activation event at time $t=0$ leads to the immediate activation of one molecule of a protein known as Kinase A.\n\nThe cascade proceeds as follows:\n1.  An activated molecule of Kinase A can phosphorylate and activate molecules of Kinase B. Each activated Kinase A molecule does so at a constant rate of $k_B$ molecules of Kinase B per second.\n2.
