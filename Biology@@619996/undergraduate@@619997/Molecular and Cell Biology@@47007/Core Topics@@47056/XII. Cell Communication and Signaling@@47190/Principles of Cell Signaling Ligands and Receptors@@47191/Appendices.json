The binding interaction of each drug with the RTK is characterized by the dissociation constant, $K_d$. The dissociation constant is defined as the equilibrium concentration of the drug at which 50% of the RTK molecules are bound by the drug.\n\nAfter conducting binding assays, the team obtains the following data:\n- The dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the Farnesinib-RTK complex is $4.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ M.\n- The dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the Geranostat-RTK complex is $8.0 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nBased solely on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between these two drugs and the target RTK?\n\nA. Farnesinib has a lower affinity for the RTK, meaning a higher concentration is needed to bind to the target compared to Geranostat.\n\nB.

This problem requires you to develop a quantitative model to predict its activation characteristics.\n\n**System Description:**\n1.  **Receptor Structure:** The Opto-TK receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein. Its extracellular and transmembrane portions are derived from rhodopsin, the protein responsible for dim-light vision. Its intracellular portion is the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain from a generic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). The total concentration of Opto-TK receptors expressed uniformly in the plasma membrane of an engineered cell is denoted by $R_T$.\n\n2.  **Activation Mechanism:** In the dark, the receptor exists in an inactive monomeric state, $R$. Upon absorption of a photon, it is converted to an active monomeric state, $R^*$. The rate of this photochemical conversion is proportional to the incident light intensity, $I$, and the concentration of inactive receptors, $[R]$. We can write this rate as $k_{on} I [R]$, where $k_{on}$ is a rate constant. The active state $R^*$ is unstable and spontaneously reverts to the inactive state $R$ in the dark via a first-order process with rate constant $k_{off}$.\n\n3.  **Catalytic Function:** The light-induced conformational change in $R^*$ exposes a previously occluded dimerization interface. Two active monomers, $R^*$, can rapidly and reversibly associate to form a dimer, $D$. This dimerization process is assumed to be always at equilibrium, described by the dissociation constant $K_D = \\frac{[R^*]^2}{[D]}$. Note that inactive receptors, $R$, cannot dimerize.
