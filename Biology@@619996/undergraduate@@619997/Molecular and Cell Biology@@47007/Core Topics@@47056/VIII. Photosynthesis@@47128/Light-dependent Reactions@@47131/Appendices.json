A key event in these reactions is the photolysis of water, which occurs at a protein complex known as Photosystem II (PSII). This reaction is crucial as it generates protons that contribute to a chemiosmotic gradient and supplies electrons to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The primary waste product of this water-splitting reaction is diatomic oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$).

This energy is not lost but is masterfully used by complexes like the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. This practice challenges you to account for all the protons translocated during linear electron flow, connecting the movement of a pair of electrons to the creation of the proton-motive force.

This gradient is subsequently used to synthesize ATP. The pathway involves the transfer of electrons from water molecules through a series of protein complexes embedded in the membrane.\n\nConsider the journey of a single pair of electrons. These two electrons are liberated by the oxidation of one molecule of water at the oxygen-evolving complex associated with Photosystem II (PSII), a reaction that also releases protons directly into the thylakoid lumen. The electrons are then passed along an electron transport chain to the cytochrome b6f complex. This complex utilizes the energy from the electron transfer to actively pump protons from the chloroplast stroma into the thylakoid lumen. Following this, the electrons are transferred via plastocyanin to Photosystem I (PSI). After being re-energized by light at PSI, the electrons are used to reduce one molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate ($\\text{NADP}^+$) to NADPH in the stroma.\n\nBased on the standard stoichiometric model for this process, determine the total number of protons that are moved into the thylakoid lumen for every two electrons transferred from water to NADPH.", "solution": "We track protons moved into the thylakoid lumen per transfer of two electrons from water to $\\text{NADP}^+$ under linear electron flow.\n\n1) Protons released into the lumen at PSII during water oxidation:\nThe oxygen-evolving complex performs\n$$\n2 \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{O}_2 + 4 \\text{H}^+_{\\text{lumen}} + 4 e^{-}.\n$$\nPer two electrons, this scales to\n$$\n\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}\\text{O}_2 + 2 \\text{H}^+_{\\text{lumen}} + 2 e^{-},\n$$\ncontributing $2$ protons to the lumen.\n\n2) Proton translocation via the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex (Q cycle):\nTwo electrons from PSII reduce plastoquinone to plastoquinol at the stromal side of PSII,\n$$\n\\text{PQ} + 2 e^{-} + 2 \\text{H}^+_{\\text{stroma}} \\rightarrow \\text{PQH}_2.\n$$\nCytochrome $b_6f$ then oxidizes $\\text{PQH}_2$ and, via the Q cycle, moves protons into the lumen.
