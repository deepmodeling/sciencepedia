[@problem_id:2330160]", "problem": "In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, energy from sunlight is used to generate high-energy molecules. This process occurs via a pathway known as linear electron flow, which involves two large protein-pigment complexes: Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI).\n\nConsider the following simplified model of this process:\n1.  An electron in the reaction center of PSII (known as P680) is excited upon the absorption of a single photon. This high-energy electron is then passed to an electron transport chain.\n2.  The electron deficiency in PSII is replenished by electrons obtained from the splitting of water.\n3.  The electron travels along an electron transport chain from PSII and eventually reaches the reaction center of PSI (known as P700).\n4.  This electron is then re-energized by the absorption of a second single photon at PSI, which excites it to an even higher energy level.\n5.  This high-energy electron from PSI is ultimately used to reduce Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADP^+$). The formation of one molecule of its reduced form, NADPH, requires the delivery of two electrons and a proton, according to the reaction: $NADP^+ + H^+ + 2 e^- \\rightarrow NADPH$.\n\nAssuming perfect quantum efficiency, where every absorbed photon successfully results in the excitation and transfer of one electron, what is the minimum total number of photons that must be absorbed collectively by PSII and PSI to produce a single molecule of NADPH?", "solution": "We map photons absorbed to electrons transferred under the stated perfect quantum efficiency: each absorbed photon excites and transfers one electron.\n\nIn linear electron flow, each electron that ultimately reduces $NADP^{+}$ is excited twice: once at PSII (P680) and once at PSI (P700). Therefore, the photon requirement per electron is\n$$\nn_{\\gamma \\text{ per } e^{-}}=1 \\text{ (at PSII)}+1 \\text{ (at PSI)}=2.\n$$\nThe reduction stoichiometry for NADPH formation is given by\n$$\nNADP^{+}+H^{+}+2e^{-}\\rightarrow NADPH,\n$$\nwhich shows that\n$$\nn_{e^{-} \\text{ per NADPH}}=2.\n$$\nCombining these factors, the total photons required per NADPH are\n$$\nn_{\\gamma \\text{ per NADPH}}=\\left(n_{\\gamma \\text{ per } e^{-}}\\right)\\left(n_{e^{-} \\text{ per NADPH}}\\right)=2 \\times 2=4.\n$$\nThus, the minimum total number of photons collectively absorbed by PSII and PSI to produce one NADPH is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2330160"}, {"introduction": "The flow of electrons through the photosystems does more than just create $NADPH$; it also powers the creation of a proton gradient that drives $ATP$ synthesis. This problem asks you to perform a complete 'proton inventory' for each molecule of oxygen evolved, accounting for protons released from water splitting and those actively pumped across the membrane. Mastering this calculation is key to understanding how the two energy-carrying products of the light-dependent reactions, $ATP$ and $NADPH$, are co-generated.

This pathway begins with the light-induced oxidation of water at Photosystem II (PSII), which releases electrons, protons, and diatomic oxygen ($O_2$). These electrons are then passed through a series of carriers, including the cytochrome b6f complex, to Photosystem I (PSI), and ultimately used to reduce NADP$^+$ to NADPH.\n\nDuring this process, a proton gradient is established across the thylakoid membrane, with protons accumulating in the thylakoid lumen. This accumulation occurs through two primary mechanisms:\n1. The oxidation of water by the oxygen-evolving complex associated with PSII.\n2. The transport of protons from the stroma to the lumen by the cytochrome b6f complex, which operates via a mechanism known as the Q-cycle. For the purpose of this problem, assume that the Q-cycle translocates exactly four protons into the lumen for every two electrons that pass through the complex.\n\nConsidering the complete, non-cyclic electron transport pathway from the splitting of water to the eventual reduction of NADP$^+$, calculate the total number of protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen for each molecule of diatomic oxygen ($O_2$) produced.", "solution": "The light-driven oxidation of water at PSII produces, per molecule of diatomic oxygen formed, the reaction:\n$$2\\,\\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_{2}} + 4\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}}_{\\text{lumen}} + 4\\,e^{-}.$$\nThus, for each $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ produced, $4$ protons are released directly into the thylakoid lumen and $4$ electrons enter the electron transport chain.\n\nThese $4$ electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex.

The chloroplasts are suspended in an isotonic buffer solution containing adequate amounts of water, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP$^+$). The suspension is illuminated with an appropriate continuous light source that efficiently excites both PSII and Photosystem I (PSI), leading to a steady rate of photosynthesis.
