The key light-reaction step is\n$$2\\,H_{2}O \\rightarrow O_{2} + 4\\,H^{+} + 4\\,e^{-}.$$\nThus, the oxygen atoms in $O_{2}$ derive from $H_{2}O$, not from $CO_{2}$.\n\n- The carbon skeleton and the oxygen atoms retained in carbohydrate are derived from $CO_{2}$ during carbon fixation and reduction (Calvin-Benson cycle). In essence, $CO_{2}$ is reduced to carbohydrate, retaining oxygen atoms in the product $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, while water serves as the electron and proton source and contributes the oxygen that is released as $O_{2}$.\n\nApply isotopic tracing to each experiment:\n\nExperiment I: Medium has $H_{2}^{18}O$ and supplied gas is $C^{16}O_{2}$.\n- From the photolysis step, the evolved $O_{2}$ will contain the heavy isotope because its oxygen atoms come from $H_{2}^{18}O$. Therefore, $^{18}O$ appears in $O_{2}$.\n- The glucose formed incorporates carbon and oxygen from $CO_{2}$; since the $CO_{2}$ contains $^{16}O$, the oxygen in $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ will be $^{16}O$, not $^{18}O$.\n\nExperiment II: Medium has $H_{2}^{16}O$ and supplied gas is $C^{18}O_{2}$.\n- The evolved $O_{2}$ derives from $H_{2}O$, which here is $H_{2}^{16}O$, so $O_{2}$ will contain $^{16}O$, not $^{18}O$.\n- The glucose oxygen atoms are derived from $CO_{2}$; because the $CO_{2}$ is $C^{18}O_{2}$, $^{18}O$ will be incorporated into $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$.\n\nTherefore, in Experiment I, $^{18}O$ is found in $O_{2}$; in Experiment II, $^{18}O$ is found in $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2328734"}, {"introduction": "The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of $ATP$ and $NADPH$. This exercise [@problem_id:2328776] uses a thought experiment involving a hypothetical mutation to probe the core mechanism of $ATP$ synthesis: chemiosmosis. By considering a thylakoid membrane that is \"leaky\" to protons ($H^+$), you can isolate and understand the critical role of the proton gradient in driving $ATP$ synthase, while also clarifying its distinct relationship to the production of $NADPH$ via linear electron flow. This problem sharpens your ability to deduce the consequences of disrupting a specific part of a complex biological system.", "problem": "In a typical chloroplast, the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur across the thylakoid membranes. A key aspect of this process is the generation of a proton ($H^+$) concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is normally impermeable to protons except through specific channels. This gradient is essential for producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Concurrently, these reactions also produce reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a plant cell contains chloroplasts with a genetic mutation. This mutation causes the thylakoid membranes to become freely permeable to protons, allowing them to diffuse across the membrane without restriction. Assume that all other components of the photosynthetic machinery, including the photosystems and the electron transport chain, are fully functional and that the chloroplast is illuminated with an adequate supply of light.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct and immediate effect of this mutation on the rates of ATP and NADPH synthesis?\n\nA. The rate of synthesis of both ATP and NADPH will decrease to zero.\n\nB. The rate of synthesis of ATP will decrease to near zero, while the rate of synthesis of NADPH will be largely unaffected.\n\nC.

With coupling stoichiometry $n_{\\text{H}}$ protons per ATP, the available driving work per ATP is $n_{\\text{H}}F\\Delta p$. When $\\Delta p\\rightarrow 0$, the forward driving force for ATP synthesis vanishes, so the rate of ATP synthesis decreases to near zero.\n\nBy contrast, NADPH synthesis results from linear electron flow driven by light: electrons from water oxidation pass through the photosystems and cytochrome $b_{6}f$ to ferredoxin, reducing NADP^{+} to NADPH at ferredoxin–NADP^{+} reductase. This electron transfer is powered by photon-induced charge separations and does not require a proton gradient as a direct driving force. With photosystems and the electron transport chain fully functional and adequate light, the immediate rate of NADPH production remains largely unaffected by dissipation of $\\Delta p$ (indeed, removal of lumen acidification can relieve photosynthetic control at cytochrome $b_{6}f$, but the key direct effect is on ATP synthesis, not NADPH formation).\n\nTherefore, the direct and immediate effect is that ATP synthesis falls to near zero, while NADPH synthesis is largely unaffected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2328776"}, {"introduction": "After the cell has captured light energy as $ATP$ and $NADPH$, it must use this energy to build carbohydrates from $CO_2$.
