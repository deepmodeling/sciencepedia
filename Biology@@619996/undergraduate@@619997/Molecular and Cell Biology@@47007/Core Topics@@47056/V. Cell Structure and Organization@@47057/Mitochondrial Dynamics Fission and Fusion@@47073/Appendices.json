This exercise explores what happens when we intentionally tip this balance. By considering a hypothetical drug that blocks the key fission protein, Drp1, you can deduce the fundamental principles of mitochondrial dynamics and predict the resulting changes in organelle morphology, a core skill in cell biology [@problem_id:2323859].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the mitochondrial network is a highly dynamic system that constantly undergoes remodeling through two opposing processes: fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion involves the merging of two mitochondria into one, a process mediated by proteins like Mitofusins on the outer membrane and OPA1 on the inner membrane. This leads to the formation of an elongated, interconnected reticulum. Conversely, mitochondrial fission is the division of one mitochondrion into two, a process primarily driven by the Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 is a cytosolic protein that is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it polymerizes into a ring-like structure. The constriction of this Drp1 ring provides the mechanical force needed to sever the mitochondrion.\n\nA researcher is studying a novel compound, \"Mito-static,\" which has been found to selectively bind to Drp1 monomers and prevent them from assembling into the functional oligomeric ring structure required for fission. The compound does not affect the function of fusion-related proteins like Mitofusins or OPA1, nor does it affect mitochondrial biogenesis or ATP production directly under short-term exposure.\n\nIf a population of healthy, actively respiring human cells is treated with an effective concentration of \"Mito-static\" for several hours, which of the following outcomes is the most likely description of the change in mitochondrial morphology?\n\nA. The mitochondrial network will appear highly fragmented, consisting of numerous small, spherical mitochondria.\n\nB. The number of individual mitochondria will increase, but their average size will decrease.\n\nC. The mitochondrial network will become highly elongated and interconnected, forming a web-like reticulum.\n\nD. The mitochondrial network morphology will remain unchanged because the cell will compensate by downregulating fusion proteins.\n\nE. Most mitochondria will be engulfed by autophagosomes and degraded, a process known as mitophagy.", "solution": "We use the principle that mitochondrial morphology reflects a dynamic steady state set by the opposing processes of fusion and fission. Let $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}$ denote the effective fusion rate and $r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$ denote the effective fission rate. In qualitative steady state, a higher ratio $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}/r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$ yields a more elongated, interconnected reticulum, whereas a lower ratio $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}/r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$ yields a more fragmented, punctate network.\n\nMitochondrial fusion is mediated by Mitofusins on the outer membrane and OPA1 on the inner membrane; mitochondrial fission is driven by Drp1 recruitment and oligomerization into a ring that constricts the organelle. The compound \"Mito-static\" selectively binds Drp1 monomers and prevents their assembly into the functional oligomeric ring. Therefore, the population of functionally competent Drp1 complexes decreases, which lowers the effective fission rate $r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$. The problem states that \"Mito-static\" does not affect fusion machinery (Mitofusins, OPA1), mitochondrial biogenesis, or ATP production under short-term exposure, so $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}$ remains unchanged over the several-hour timescale considered.\n\nConsequently, the ratio $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}/r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$ increases. This shifts the morphological steady state toward net fusion, producing an elongated, hyperfused, interconnected mitochondrial network.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A and B describe outcomes consistent with increased fission or decreased fusion; these contradict the predicted decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$ with unchanged $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}$.\n- C describes an elongated, interconnected reticulum, which matches the expected hyperfusion when $r_{\\mathrm{fu}}/r_{\\mathrm{fi}}$ increases.\n- D posits no change via rapid compensatory downregulation of fusion proteins; this is not supported by the scenario, which specifies no effect on fusion and considers only several hours of treatment.\n- E predicts increased mitophagy; short-term inhibition of fission with preserved ATP production does not drive widespread mitophagy and, if anything, fission inhibition can impede mitophagy.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is an elongated, interconnected mitochondrial network, as in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323859"}, {"introduction": "After predicting the outcomes of disrupting mitochondrial dynamics, it's crucial to understand how scientists experimentally verify these processes in living cells. This problem introduces a powerful real-world technique using photoactivatable fluorescent proteins to track the fate of individual mitochondria. By analyzing the proposed experimental outcomes, you can learn to distinguish true fusion—the mixing of internal contents—from other cellular events, providing direct evidence for this dynamic process [@problem_id:2323901].", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the dynamics of the mitochondrial network within a living eukaryotic cell. To do this, researchers transfect the cell with a plasmid encoding a Photoactivatable Green Fluorescent Protein (paGFP) that is fused to a mitochondrial targeting sequence. This ensures the paGFP protein is synthesized and exclusively imported into the mitochondrial matrix. The paGFP protein is initially non-fluorescent. However, upon exposure to a brief pulse of 405 nm laser light, it undergoes an irreversible conformational change and becomes fluorescent, emitting green light when excited by a 488 nm laser.\n\nIn the experiment, a researcher uses a confocal microscope to focus the 405 nm activating laser onto a small, specific region of the cell, photoactivating only the subpopulation of mitochondria within that zone. Immediately following this activation, the entire cell is imaged over time using the 488 nm laser to track the location of the now-fluorescent green protein.\n\nWhich of the following observations would provide the most direct evidence that mitochondrial fusion is occurring in the cell?\n\nA. The green fluorescence, initially localized to a few mitochondria, gradually spreads throughout the cell's mitochondrial network, appearing in mitochondria that were outside the original photoactivation region.\n\nB. The initially activated green mitochondria are observed to elongate and then divide into smaller, distinct green mitochondrial fragments.\n\nC. The green fluorescence remains strictly confined to the mitochondria that were initially in the photoactivation zone, and these mitochondria do not mix with their neighbors.\n\nD. The green fluorescence intensity within the initially activated mitochondria decreases uniformly and rapidly over time, eventually disappearing completely without spreading to other mitochondria.\n\nE. The green fluorescence is observed to leak out from the initially activated mitochondria and become diffuse throughout the cell's cytoplasm.", "solution": "The experimental design places photoactivatable GFP specifically in the mitochondrial matrix, where it remains confined unless inner membrane continuity is established with another mitochondrion. Photoactivation in a small region labels the matrix content of only those mitochondria in that region. Mitochondrial fusion is defined by the merging of both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, generating a continuous matrix compartment between the fusing partners. A direct consequence is the equilibration of soluble matrix contents, such as paGFP, between previously separate mitochondria.\n\nTherefore, the most direct evidence of fusion in this setup is the redistribution of the fluorescent matrix marker from the initially activated mitochondria to other mitochondria that were not activated, indicating exchange of matrix contents via fusion.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A describes the spread of green fluorescence from the activated subset to other mitochondria outside the original activation zone. This indicates matrix content mixing through membrane fusion and directly evidences fusion dynamics across the network.\n- Option B describes elongation followed by division into smaller green fragments, which is mitochondrial fission, not fusion, and shows no mixing with nonactivated mitochondria.\n- Option C indicates that labeled mitochondria remain isolated with no mixing, consistent with an absence of fusion.\n- Option D indicates loss of signal without spread, consistent with photobleaching or protein turnover, not fusion-mediated content exchange.\n- Option E indicates leakage of fluorescence into the cytoplasm, implying loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity, not fusion.\n\nThus, the observation that most directly evidences mitochondrial fusion is the appearance of green fluorescence in mitochondria outside the initial activation region due to matrix content mixing, as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2323901"}, {"introduction": "Cellular processes rarely occur in isolation. This exercise moves beyond the mitochondrion itself to consider its interactions within the broader cellular system, applying your knowledge in a quantitative context. You will model a scenario where mitochondria and peroxisomes compete for a limited pool of the fission protein Drp1.

The morphology of the mitochondrial network is quantified by its steady-state average aspect ratio (AR), defined as the ratio of its length to its width. The network's structure is maintained by a balance between mitochondrial fission (division) and fusion (merging).\n\nBoth mitochondrial fission and peroxisomal fission are critically dependent on the recruitment of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) from a common, finite cytosolic pool. The model is based on the following principles:\n1.  The rate of mitochondrial fusion is assumed to be constant under all conditions.\n2.  The steady-state mitochondrial aspect ratio (AR) is inversely proportional to the rate of mitochondrial fission.\n3.  The rate of mitochondrial fission is directly proportional to the amount of Drp1 allocated to the mitochondria.\n4.  The total pool of active Drp1 is distributed between mitochondria and peroxisomes in direct proportion to their relative 'recruitment demands'.\n\nIn the normal, wild-type (WT) version of this cell line, the mitochondrial network has a steady-state aspect ratio of $AR_{WT} = 2.5$. Under these conditions, it is determined that 70% of the active cytosolic Drp1 pool is allocated to mitochondrial fission and the remaining 30% is allocated to peroxisomal fission.\n\nA mutation is then introduced into the cell line, causing runaway peroxisomal proliferation. This significantly increases the number of peroxisomes, which consequently increases the total Drp1 recruitment demand from the peroxisomal population by a factor of 4.\n\nAssuming the total cellular concentration of Drp1 and the intrinsic rate of mitochondrial fusion remain constant, calculate the new steady-state average aspect ratio of the mitochondria in the mutant cell line.
