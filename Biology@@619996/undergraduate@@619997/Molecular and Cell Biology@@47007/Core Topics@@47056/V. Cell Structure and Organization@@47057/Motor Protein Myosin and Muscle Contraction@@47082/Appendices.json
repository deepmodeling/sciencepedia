This exercise uses a classic thought experiment involving a non-hydrolyzable form of ATP to isolate one of the most critical steps in the cycle. By examining the consequences of preventing ATP hydrolysis, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the distinct roles of ATP binding versus its energy release in driving muscle movement [@problem_id:2325845].", "problem": "In a laboratory experiment, a researcher prepares a sample of skeletal muscle fibers that have been treated with a mild detergent. This treatment makes the cell membranes and sarcoplasmic reticulum permeable, allowing direct access to the contractile machinery (actin and myosin) while washing away the cell's native Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and calcium ions. To initiate contraction, the researcher adds a buffer solution containing a high concentration of calcium ions. Following this, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog is introduced into the buffer. This analog can bind to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head with the same affinity as ATP, but it cannot be broken down into ADP and inorganic phosphate.\n\nWhat is the most immediate and primary consequence for the myosin heads within the cross-bridge cycle upon the introduction of this non-hydrolyzable ATP analog?\n\nA. Myosin heads will remain permanently attached to the actin filaments in a state of rigor.\n\nB. Myosin heads will detach from the actin filaments and will be unable to re-bind to them.\n\nC. The power stroke will occur, but the myosin heads will then be unable to detach from the actin filaments.\n\nD. The sarcoplasmic reticulum will release a massive, uncontrolled flood of calcium ions, causing titanic contraction.\n\nE. Myosin heads will bind to actin but will be unable to perform the power stroke.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle relies on the following nucleotide-dependent transitions of the myosin head ($M$) with actin ($A$):\n1) In the absence of nucleotide, the myosin head is tightly bound to actin (rigor): $A\\cdot M$.\n2) Binding of ATP to myosin induces a conformational change that markedly lowers myosin’s affinity for actin, causing detachment:\n$$A\\cdot M + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow A + M\\cdot \\text{ATP}.$$\n3) Hydrolysis of ATP while myosin is detached cocks the head:\n$$M\\cdot \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}.$$\n4) The cocked $M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}$ weakly binds actin:\n$$M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}} + A \\rightleftharpoons A\\cdot M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}.$$\n5) Release of $P_{\\text{i}}$ triggers the power stroke and strong binding; subsequent ADP release returns to the rigor-like $A\\cdot M$ state:\n$$A\\cdot M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}} \\rightarrow A\\cdot M\\cdot \\text{ADP} + P_{\\text{i}} \\rightarrow A\\cdot M + \\text{ADP}.$$\n\nIn the experiment, the fibers are permeabilized, and native ATP and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ are washed out. High $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is then supplied, exposing actin sites. Introducing a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (denote it $\\text{ATP}^{*}$) that binds the myosin ATP site with the same affinity as ATP but cannot be hydrolyzed alters step 2 but blocks step 3:\n- Immediate effect of $\\text{ATP}^{*}$ binding is identical to ATP at step 2:\n$$A\\cdot M + \\text{ATP}^{*} \\rightarrow A + M\\cdot \\text{ATP}^{*},$$\nso myosin heads detach from actin because nucleotide binding lowers actin affinity.\n- Because $\\text{ATP}^{*}$ is non-hydrolyzable, the transition\n$$M\\cdot \\text{ATP}^{*} \\not\\rightarrow M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}$$\ndoes not occur. Without hydrolysis, the myosin head cannot enter the cocked, actin-binding-competent $M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}$ state, cannot undergo $P_{\\text{i}}$ release, and thus cannot perform the power stroke.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary consequence is that myosin heads detach from actin upon binding the analog and remain unable to re-bind productively, as they cannot proceed to the hydrolyzed, cocked state. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is irrelevant here due to permeabilization, and rigor attachment would only occur in the absence of any ATP-like ligand.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325845"}, {"introduction": "Having established the fundamental steps of the cross-bridge cycle, we can now explore its dynamics quantitatively. A muscle's speed and force-generating capacity are not arbitrary; they emerge directly from the kinetics of the myosin motor. This problem challenges you to analyze how a specific mutation affecting ADP release impacts both the overall cycle speed and the 'duty ratio'—the fraction of time myosin is actively engaged with actin—linking molecular events to macroscopic muscle properties [@problem_id:2325826].", "problem": "In the study of muscle physiology, the cross-bridge cycle of myosin II motors is fundamental to understanding contraction. A simplified kinetic model of this cycle in a fast-twitch muscle fiber under zero external load (allowing for maximum shortening velocity) consists of four sequential steps with the following average durations for a wild-type (WT) myosin motor:\n\n1.  **ATP Binding and Detachment**: The binding of an Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecule to the myosin head causes it to detach from the actin filament. Duration: $t_1 = 1.0$ ms.\n2.  **ATP Hydrolysis and Recovery Stroke**: The myosin head hydrolyzes ATP to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), and its lever arm \"re-cocks\" into a high-energy position. Duration: $t_2 = 4.0$ ms.\n3.  **Actin Binding and Power Stroke**: The myosin head binds weakly to actin, then releases Pi, which triggers the power stroke, a conformational change that pulls the actin filament. Duration: $t_3 = 1.5$ ms.\n4.  **ADP Release**: After the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head. This is the final step before a new ATP can bind. Duration: $t_4 = 2.5$ ms.\n\nThe total cycle time, $T$, is the sum of the durations of these four steps. The maximum shortening velocity, $v_{\\text{max}}$, of the muscle fiber is inversely proportional to this total cycle time ($v_{\\text{max}} \\propto 1/T$).\n\nThe \"duty ratio,\" $d$, represents the fraction of the total cycle time during which the myosin head is strongly bound to the actin filament and capable of producing or resisting force. In this model, the strong-binding state corresponds to the power stroke and ADP release phases (Steps 3 and 4).\n\nNow, consider a specific genetic mutation that alters the myosin head's affinity for ADP. This mutation does not affect the durations of Steps 1, 2, or 3, but it dramatically slows the dissociation of ADP, increasing the duration of Step 4 by a factor of 40.\n\nBased on this model, which of the following statements most accurately describes the consequences of this mutation on the muscle fiber's properties?\n\nA. The duty ratio increases, and the maximum shortening velocity increases.\n\nB. The duty ratio decreases, and the maximum shortening velocity decreases.\n\nC. The duty ratio increases, and the maximum shortening velocity decreases.\n\nD. The duty ratio remains approximately constant, while the maximum shortening velocity decreases.\n\nE.
