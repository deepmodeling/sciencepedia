This exercise, [@problem_id:2341578], challenges you to consider the very first step: entry into the endoplasmic reticulum. By analyzing a scenario where a protein's 'molecular address label,' the signal peptide, is non-functional, you can deduce the fundamental principle of default protein localization and the absolute requirement for proper targeting signals.", "problem": "A biotechnology research team is engineering a eukaryotic cell line to produce and secrete a therapeutic protein called \"Protease-A\". The gene for Protease-A includes a standard N-terminal signal sequence that directs the newly synthesized protein into the secretory pathway, beginning at the endoplasmic reticulum. For the protein to be secreted, it must successfully enter this pathway.\n\nDuring a routine production run, the team discovers that while the cells are producing functional Protease-A at the expected rate, none of the protein is being secreted into the extracellular medium. A genetic analysis of this cell batch reveals a single, specific mutation in the Protease-A gene. This mutation has altered the coding sequence for the N-terminal signal peptide, rendering it completely non-functional. The mutation does not affect the translation, folding, or enzymatic activity of the rest of the Protease-A protein.\n\nAssuming all other cellular machinery for protein synthesis and transport is functioning correctly, where would the fully synthesized Protease-A protein molecules be expected to predominantly accumulate within these mutant cells?\n\nA. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\nB. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus\n\nC. In the cytosol\n\nD. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis\n\nE. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state", "solution": "- Secretory pathway entry in eukaryotic cells requires an N-terminal signal peptide on the nascent polypeptide to be recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it engages the Sec61 translocon. Translation then resumes with co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen, after which the signal peptide is typically cleaved. From there, proteins proceed ER lumen → Golgi apparatus → secretory vesicles → extracellular space.\n\n- If the N-terminal signal peptide is non-functional, SRP cannot recognize or bind the nascent chain. Consequently, the ribosome does not dock at the ER, and translation proceeds to completion on free ribosomes in the cytosol. In the absence of any other targeting signals (e.g., nuclear localization sequence, mitochondrial targeting signal, or peroxisomal targeting signal), the default localization of the fully synthesized protein is the cytosol.\n\n- The problem states: the only mutation renders the N-terminal signal peptide non-functional, while translation, folding, and enzymatic activity of the rest of the protein are unaffected, and all other cellular machinery is intact. Therefore, the protein will not enter the ER and thus cannot reach the Golgi, secretory vesicles, or extracellular space.\n\n- Evaluating options:\n  A. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum: requires a functional signal peptide and SRP-mediated targeting; not possible.\n  B. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus: requires prior ER entry; not possible.\n  C. In the cytosol: default localization when no functional ER signal peptide is present; expected outcome.\n  D. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis: requires ER and Golgi transit; not possible.\n  E. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state: secretion cannot occur without ER entry; misfolding is not implicated by the mutation.\n\n- Therefore, the fully synthesized Protease-A will predominantly accumulate in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341578"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein successfully enters the endoplasmic reticulum, it must be transported to the next destination, the Golgi apparatus. This transport is not a simple diffusion process; it relies on specialized transport vesicles. This practice [@problem_id:2341595] focuses on the machinery of anterograde transport, specifically the role of COPII-coated vesicles, allowing you to explore what happens when the formation of these crucial 'cargo carriers' is inhibited.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying a novel small-molecule inhibitor, named Vesiculostatin A. Through a series of biochemical assays, it is determined that Vesiculostatin A specifically and potently prevents the GTP-binding protein Sar1 from anchoring to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This action effectively blocks the subsequent assembly of Coat Protein Complex II (COPII) vesicles.\n\nBased on this specific mechanism of action, which of the following transport pathways within the endomembrane system would be most directly and immediately inhibited in cells treated with Vesiculostatin A?\n\nA. Transport of newly synthesized proteins and lipids from the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.\n\nB. Retrieval of resident Endoplasmic Reticulum proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nC. Internalization of extracellular materials via receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane.\n\nD. Delivery of hydrolytic enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes.\n\nE. The fusion of mature secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane for exocytosis.", "solution": "Sar1 is a small GTP-binding protein that initiates COPII vesicle formation at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites. In its GTP-bound state, Sar1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the ER membrane, anchoring Sar1 and nucleating the COPII coat by recruiting Sec23/24 and Sec13/31. This coat assembly drives budding of COPII vesicles that mediate anterograde transport of newly synthesized proteins and lipids from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. If Vesiculostatin A prevents Sar1 from anchoring to the ER membrane, COPII assembly is acutely blocked, thereby directly and immediately inhibiting ER-to-Golgi transport.\n\nBy contrast, retrieval of ER-resident proteins from the Golgi (retrograde transport) is mediated by COPI coats and the ARF1 GTPase, not Sar1, so it is not directly inhibited. Receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane relies on clathrin and dynamin, not COPII. Delivery from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes uses clathrin adaptors (such as AP-1 or GGAs) and ARF1, not COPII. Fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane for exocytosis is governed by Rab GTPases and SNAREs, not Sar1. Therefore, the transport step most directly and immediately inhibited by blocking Sar1 membrane anchoring is ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341595"}, {"introduction": "The final step for a secreted protein is its release from the cell via exocytosis, a process involving the precise fusion of a transport vesicle with the plasma membrane. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2341629] combines a classic experimental approach, the pulse-chase, with a specific molecular inhibitor to probe this terminal event. By predicting the outcome, you will solidify your understanding of the dynamic nature of the secretory pathway and the machinery that governs membrane fusion.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating the secretory pathway in a specialized line of cultured mammalian cells that produce and secrete a large signaling protein. To trace the protein's journey, they perform a pulse-chase experiment. The cells are first incubated for three minutes in a medium containing a radioactive amino acid, ³H-methionine (the \"pulse\"). Following this, the cells are washed and transferred to a medium containing an excess of non-radioactive methionine for a 90-minute chase period.\n\nTwo conditions are tested. In the control group, the experiment proceeds as described. In the experimental group, the cells are pre-treated and maintained in a medium containing N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM is an alkylating agent that covalently modifies sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues. This modification is known to inactivate the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), an ATPase crucial for disassembling SNARE protein complexes after membrane fusion. For this experiment, assume that the primary effect of NEM is a complete and specific inhibition of the final fusion event between secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane, without affecting earlier transport steps.\n\nAfter the 90-minute chase period, the cells from the experimental group are fixed and analyzed by autoradiography to determine the subcellular localization of the radioactive proteins. In which of the following locations would the highest concentration of radioactivity be detected?\n\nA. Concentrated within the cis-Golgi network.\n\nB. Dispersed uniformly in the cytosol.\n\nC. Accumulated in secretory vesicles clustered near the plasma membrane.\n\nD. Concentrated within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nE. Uniformly distributed in the extracellular medium.\n\nF. Concentrated within lysosomes for degradation.", "solution": "- In a pulse-chase with $^{3}\\mathrm{H}$-methionine, newly synthesized proteins incorporate the radioactive amino acid during the pulse. During the chase with excess non-radioactive methionine, no additional labeling occurs, and the previously labeled proteins progress along their normal trafficking route.\n- Secretory proteins bearing an ER signal sequence undergo co-translational translocation into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, then are transported via COPII vesicles to the cis-Golgi, processed through the medial and trans-Golgi, sorted at the trans-Golgi network, packaged into secretory vesicles, and delivered to the plasma membrane for exocytosis. This trafficking is vesicle-mediated and relies on SNARE-mediated membrane fusion for each fusion step.\n- N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) covalently modifies cysteine sulfhydryls and inactivates NSF, which is required to disassemble SNARE complexes after membrane fusion. The problem explicitly instructs to assume that NEM causes a complete and specific inhibition of the final fusion event between secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane, without impairing earlier transport steps (ER exit, intra-Golgi transport, and budding of secretory vesicles).\n- Therefore, during the 90-minute chase, labeled secretory proteins will successfully move from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, be sorted and packed into secretory vesicles, and traffic to the cell periphery. However, they will be unable to undergo the final fusion with the plasma membrane; thus, no release to the extracellular space occurs.\n- Consequence for localization:\n  - Not in the cytosol (secretory proteins are not cytosolic; they remain within the lumen of organelles and vesicles).\n  - Not in the ER or cis-Golgi after 90 minutes, because earlier steps proceed and the cargo exits these compartments en route to secretion.\n  - Not in lysosomes, because there is no indication of mannose-6-phosphate targeting or misfolding-induced ER-associated degradation for this secretory cargo.\n  - Not in the extracellular medium, because fusion and exocytosis are specifically blocked.\n  - Hence, the labeled proteins accumulate within secretory vesicles that traffic to and dock near the plasma membrane but cannot fuse, leading to clustering of labeled vesicles at the cell periphery.\n- Therefore, the highest concentration of radioactivity will be detected in secretory vesicles clustered near the plasma membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341629"}]}
