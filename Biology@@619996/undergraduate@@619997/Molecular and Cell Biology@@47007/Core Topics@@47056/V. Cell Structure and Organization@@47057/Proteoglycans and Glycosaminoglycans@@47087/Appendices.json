This practice explores the fundamental principle linking the high density of negative charges on Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains to the hydration of the extracellular matrix. By modeling the effect of neutralizing these charges, you can quantitatively connect the molecular-level chemistry of proteoglycans to the macroscopic physical properties of the tissue, such as its ability to resist compression [@problem_id:2333289].", "problem": "Articular cartilage, the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones in joints, owes its remarkable ability to resist compressive forces to the unique properties of its extracellular matrix. This matrix is rich in proteoglycans, which are large molecules consisting of a core protein with one or more covalently attached Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains.\n\nConsider a simplified biophysical model of a cylindrical sample of articular cartilage where its total volume is the sum of a fixed solid matrix volume (composed of collagen and other proteins) and a variable water volume. In this model, the volume of water retained within the matrix is directly proportional to the total number of negatively charged functional groups (carboxyl and sulfate) present on the GAG chains.\n\nA particular sample of cartilage has an initial thickness of $4.0$ mm. In its normal physiological state, it is composed of $80\\%$ water and $20\\%$ solid matrix by volume. The predominant GAG in this tissue is chondroitin 6-sulfate. At physiological pH, each repeating disaccharide unit of chondroitin 6-sulfate possesses one negatively charged carboxyl group and one negatively charged sulfate group.\n\nImagine that a hypothetical enzymatic treatment is applied to this cartilage sample, which selectively and completely neutralizes all the sulfate groups on the GAG chains. The treatment does not affect the carboxyl groups or the solid matrix components. Assuming the cross-sectional area of the cylindrical sample remains constant, calculate the new equilibrium thickness of the cartilage.\n\nExpress your answer in millimeters (mm) and round to two significant figures.", "solution": "Let the initial total volume be $V_{0}$, cross-sectional area be $A$, and initial thickness be $h_{0}$. Then $V_{0} = A h_{0}$. The solid matrix volume is fixed: $S = 0.20 V_{0}$, and the initial water volume is $W_{0} = 0.80 V_{0}$.\n\nLet the number of negatively charged groups per repeating unit initially be $n_{0} = 2$ (one carboxyl and one sulfate). After neutralizing all sulfate groups, the number becomes $n_{1} = 1$ (only the carboxyl remains). Since water volume is directly proportional to the total number of negative charges, the water volume scales as\n$$\n\\frac{W_{1}}{W_{0}} = \\frac{n_{1}}{n_{0}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad W_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} W_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0.80 V_{0} = 0.40 V_{0}.\n$$\nThe new total volume is the sum of the unchanged solid volume and the new water volume:\n$$\nV_{1} = S + W_{1} = 0.20 V_{0} + 0.40 V_{0} = 0.60 V_{0}.\n$$\nWith constant cross-sectional area $A$, thickness scales with volume:\n$$\nh_{1} = \\frac{V_{1}}{A} = \\frac{0.60 V_{0}}{A} = 0.60 \\frac{V_{0}}{A} = 0.60 h_{0}.\n$$\nSubstituting $h_{0} = 4.0 \\text{ mm}$ gives\n$$\nh_{1} = 0.60 \\times 4.0 = 2.4 \\text{ mm}.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, the thickness is $2.4$ in millimeters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.4}$$", "id": "2333289"}, {"introduction": "Proteoglycans are not a monolithic group; their function is critically dependent on their cellular location, which is dictated by signals encoded within their protein sequence. This thought experiment investigates the cellular fate of a syndecan, a transmembrane proteoglycan, when its membrane-anchoring domain is removed [@problem_id:2333296]. Understanding this process is key to appreciating how cells use the secretory pathway to correctly place proteins, such as on the cell surface or secreting them into the extracellular environment.", "problem": "Syndecans are a class of transmembrane proteoglycans found on the surface of many cell types, where they participate in cell-matrix adhesion and growth factor signaling. A typical syndecan protein possesses an N-terminal signal sequence, an extracellular domain to which long, unbranched polysaccharide chains called Glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) are attached, a single alpha-helical transmembrane domain that anchors it in the plasma membrane, and a short cytoplasmic tail.\n\nA molecular biology student conducts an experiment on a line of cultured fibroblasts. The student genetically engineers the cells to express a modified version of the syndecan-1 protein. This modified protein is identical to the wild-type protein, including its N-terminal signal sequence, but the entire segment of the protein that normally forms the transmembrane domain has been deleted.\n\nAssuming the protein is correctly synthesized and folded, where would this modified syndecan-1 proteoglycan be predominantly located after its synthesis and processing?\n\nA. Freely distributed throughout the cytosol.\n\nB. Secreted from the cell into the extracellular matrix.\n\nC. Tightly bound to the outer surface of the mitochondrial membrane.\n\nD. Permanently embedded within the membrane of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nE. Imported into the nucleus to act as a transcription factor.", "solution": "- The N-terminal signal sequence on a nascent polypeptide is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and targets the ribosomeâ€“nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This directs co-translational translocation of the polypeptide through the Sec61 translocon into the ER lumen. The signal peptide is typically cleaved by signal peptidase after insertion into the ER.\n- For single-pass type I transmembrane proteins like wild-type syndecan-1, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment functions as a stop-transfer (membrane anchor) sequence that halts further translocation and laterally integrates into the lipid bilayer, producing a lumenal/extracellular domain and a cytosolic tail.\n- In the engineered construct, the entire transmembrane domain is deleted. Consequently, there is no stop-transfer or hydrophobic anchor segment. The default outcome is complete translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen, yielding a soluble lumenal protein rather than a membrane-embedded protein.\n- Within the ER and Golgi, the protein will undergo appropriate post-translational modifications for secretory pathway proteins, including glycosylation and addition of glycosaminoglycan chains to the core protein as appropriate for proteoglycans. Because it lacks a transmembrane anchor and lacks ER retention/retrieval signals (such as KDEL for soluble lumenal ER proteins), it will proceed anterograde through the Golgi and be packaged into secretory vesicles.\n- By default, soluble proteins that traverse the secretory pathway without specific retention signals are secreted from the cell via the constitutive secretory pathway. Thus, the modified syndecan-1 will be released into the extracellular space/ECM as a soluble proteoglycan (analogous to an ectodomain shed form), not embedded in any membrane.\n- Exclusions of answer choices:\n  - A is incorrect because the signal sequence commits the protein to the ER; proteins entering the ER lumen are not free in the cytosol.\n  - C is incorrect because outer mitochondrial membrane targeting requires specific mitochondrial targeting signals, not an ER signal peptide, and entry into the ER precludes mitochondrial import.\n  - D is incorrect because embedding in the Golgi membrane requires a membrane anchor; a soluble lumenal protein without retention signals will transit the Golgi and be secreted.\n  - E is incorrect because nuclear import requires nuclear localization signals and secretory pathway proteins are segregated from the cytosol by membranes and are not imported into the nucleus.\nTherefore, the modified protein will be secreted into the extracellular matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2333296"}, {"introduction": "To study the roles of different proteoglycans, scientists must be able to distinguish and quantify them.

It is known that this cell line expresses two major types of heparan sulfate proteoglycans: syndecans, which are integral transmembrane proteins, and glypicans, which are anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.\n\nTo determine the relative abundance of these two types of proteoglycans, the researcher performs an experiment. The cells are cultured in a medium containing radioactive sulfate, $^{35}$SO$_{4}^{2-}$, which becomes incorporated into the newly synthesized heparan sulfate chains. After the labeling period, the total radioactivity associated with all cell-surface proteoglycans is measured to be $1.88 \\times 10^5$ counts per minute (CPM).\n\nSubsequently, an identical, parallel culture of labeled cells is treated with an excess of purified Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC).
