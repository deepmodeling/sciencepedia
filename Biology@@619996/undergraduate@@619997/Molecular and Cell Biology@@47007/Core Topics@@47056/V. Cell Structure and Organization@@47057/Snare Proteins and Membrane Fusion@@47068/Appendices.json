By considering a hypothetical toxin that precisely targets and cleaves the v-SNARE synaptobrevin, you can deduce the direct consequence on the synaptic vesicle cycle [@problem_id:2338593]. This practice hones your ability to trace a molecular disruption through a complex biological pathway to predict its ultimate physiological outcome.", "problem": "A team of neurobiologists is investigating a novel toxin, \"Silentin,\" isolated from a marine sponge. When applied to a neuronal culture, Silentin causes a rapid and complete cessation of communication between neurons. Further biochemical analysis reveals that the toxin's sole molecular action is to act as a highly specific protease that cleaves a single protein: synaptobrevin. Synaptobrevin is a v-SNARE, a class of proteins found on the membrane of synaptic vesicles. These vesicles are filled with neurotransmitters and are located in the presynaptic terminal. The fusion of these vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is mediated by the formation of a Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) complex, which involves synaptobrevin, as well as the t-SNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic plasma membrane.\n\nAssuming the toxin has no other effects on the neuron, what is the most direct and immediate consequence of synaptobrevin cleavage by Silentin on the process of synaptic transmission?\n\nA. The propagation of the action potential along the presynaptic axon is blocked.\n\nB. Synaptic vesicles are unable to fuse with the presynaptic membrane to release their neurotransmitter content.\n\nC. The synthesis of neurotransmitter molecules within the presynaptic terminal is inhibited.\n\nD. Neurotransmitters are released normally, but they are prevented from binding to their receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nE. Synaptic vesicles are unable to be filled with neurotransmitter molecules by their specific transporters.", "solution": "We are told Silentin is a highly specific protease that cleaves synaptobrevin. Synaptobrevin is a v-SNARE located on synaptic vesicles. Neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses requires $Ca^{2+}$-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This membrane fusion is mediated by formation of the trans-SNARE complex, which minimally requires the v-SNARE synaptobrevin on the vesicle and the t-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic membrane.\n\nCleavage of synaptobrevin removes a necessary component of the SNARE complex. Without intact synaptobrevin, the trans-SNARE complex cannot assemble. In the absence of a functional SNARE complex, synaptic vesicles cannot undergo the membrane fusion step of exocytosis, even if $Ca^{2+}$ enters normally in response to an action potential.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is prevention of synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane and thus failure to release neurotransmitter. This specifically matches option B. The other options are not directly affected by synaptobrevin cleavage: action potential propagation along the axon depends on voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ channels (not SNAREs), neurotransmitter synthesis and vesicular filling depend on biosynthetic enzymes and vesicular transporters with a proton gradient (not SNAREs), and postsynaptic receptor binding is downstream of release and not directly altered by a presynaptic v-SNARE proteolysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338593"}, {"introduction": "Building on the essential role of SNAREs, this problem delves into the molecular architecture that makes them such effective fusion machines. You will examine the 'zero layer', a critical polar interface within the hydrophobic core of the four-helix bundle, which in neurons typically consists of three glutamine ($Q$) residues and one arginine ($R$) residue [@problem_id:2338540]. By predicting the effect of mutating one of these key residues, you will practice linking specific amino acid properties to the overall thermodynamic stability and function of a protein complex.", "problem": "The process of membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells, such as the release of neurotransmitters at a synapse, is mediated by the SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor) complex. This complex forms a tight, four-helix bundle that brings the vesicular and target membranes into close proximity, driving their fusion. The core of this bundle consists of 16 stacked layers of interacting amino acid residues. A particularly critical layer, known as the \"zero layer,\" is located at the center of the helical bundle. In a typical neuronal SNARE complex, this layer is composed of three polar glutamine (Q) residues, contributed by the t-SNAREs (syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25), and one positively charged arginine (R) residue, contributed by the v-SNARE (synaptobrevin). The polar and charged side chains of these residues form an intricate network of interactions within the otherwise hydrophobic interior of the four-helix bundle, which is crucial for the stability of the fully assembled complex.\n\nImagine a molecular biology experiment where a site-directed mutation is introduced into the gene encoding the t-SNARE protein syntaxin-1. This mutation specifically replaces the glutamine (Q) residue that contributes to the zero layer with a nonpolar alanine (A) residue. Assuming this mutant protein is correctly folded and targeted to the plasma membrane, what is the most likely primary consequence for the process of membrane fusion?\n\nA. The SNARE complex will fail to disassemble after fusion, as the mutation prevents the binding of the disassembly factors, NSF and Î±-SNAP.\n\nB. The initial docking of the vesicle to the target membrane will be completely inhibited due to electrostatic repulsion caused by the mutation.\n\nC. The stability of the fully zippered SNARE complex will be significantly reduced, leading to a lower probability of successful membrane fusion events per complex formed.\n\nD. The rate of fusion will increase dramatically, as the nonpolar alanine residue removes an energetically unfavorable polar group from the bundle's hydrophobic core.\n\nE. The mutation will cause the SNARE proteins to be permanently anchored in the cis-Golgi network, preventing them from participating in neurotransmitter release at the synapse.", "solution": "We identify the relevant structural and energetic principles of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion:\n\n1. Thermodynamic driving force of SNARE zippering:\n- The formation of the four-helix SNARE bundle from the N-terminus toward the C-terminus releases free energy that drives membrane apposition and fusion. Denote the free energy change for full zippering as $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}$, with $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}<0$ for a stable, fully zippered complex.\n- The equilibrium constant for full zippering is $K=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}}{RT}\\right)$, so any destabilization that makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}$ less negative decreases $K$.\n\n2. Role of the zero layer (QQQR motif) in the SNARE core:\n- The zero layer is a central, conserved polar/charged layer inside an otherwise hydrophobic core, consisting of three glutamines (Q) and one arginine (R). These side chains form a hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic network that compensates for burying polar/charged groups and stabilizes the core of the four-helix bundle.\n- Replacing a Q with A removes an amide side chain that participates in hydrogen bonding. This disrupts the zero-layer network, leaving the positively charged R with fewer compensating interactions. Burying an uncompensated charge is energetically costly, adding a positive destabilization term $\\Delta G_{\\text{destab}}>0$.\n- Consequently, the mutated zippering free energy becomes $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}'=\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}+\\Delta G_{\\text{destab}}$, with $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}'$ less negative (or possibly positive), leading to $K'=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}'}{RT}\\right)<K$.\n\n3. Consequence for fusion probability and rate:\n- Fusion requires completion of C-terminal zippering to bring membranes into close proximity and to lower the activation barrier for lipid mixing. If the fully zippered state is destabilized, the population and lifetime of the fully assembled complex decrease.\n- The probability of successful fusion per complex, $P_{\\text{fusion}}$, scales with the likelihood of reaching and dwelling in the fully zippered state; symbolically, $P_{\\text{fusion}}\\propto K$ for otherwise similar conditions.\n- A reduced $K'$ therefore reduces $P_{\\text{fusion}}$, and typically increases the effective activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for fusion, lowering the rate constant $k\\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$.\n\n4. Evaluation of the options:\n- A: Disassembly by NSF and $\\alpha$-SNAP occurs after fusion on cis-SNAREs and depends on the assembled complex; the zero-layer Q-to-A primarily impairs assembly/stability rather than specifically blocking disassembly factor binding.\n- B: Initial docking is not expected to be completely inhibited by electrostatic repulsion; Q-to-A does not introduce repulsive charge, and docking involves tethers and initial SNARE recognition that can still occur.\n- C: Consistent with the energetic analysis above: the mutation destabilizes the fully zippered state, decreasing $K'$ and thus reducing the probability of successful fusion per complex formed.\n- D: The polar zero layer is conserved and functionally required; removing a polar participant does not remove an unfavorable interaction but instead creates unsatisfied charge burial and disrupts hydrogen bonds, decreasing, not increasing, fusion efficiency.\n- E: Mislocalization to the cis-Golgi is unrelated to the zero-layer chemistry, and the problem states targeting to the plasma membrane is intact.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary consequence is reduced stability of the fully zippered SNARE complex, lowering the probability of successful fusion events per complex formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2338540"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between qualitative understanding and quantitative analysis, a crucial skill in modern cell biology.

They prepare two distinct populations of liposomes (artificial lipid vesicles).

The second population, representing the presynaptic target membrane, has the t-SNARE proteins (syntaxin and SNAP-25) incorporated, with the t-SNARE complex being tagged with a compatible acceptor fluorophore.\n\nThe fluorophore pair is designed for FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a process where energy is transferred non-radiatively from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore.

The FRET signal, which is proportional to the concentration of assembled *trans*-SNARE complexes, is monitored over time and measured in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU).
