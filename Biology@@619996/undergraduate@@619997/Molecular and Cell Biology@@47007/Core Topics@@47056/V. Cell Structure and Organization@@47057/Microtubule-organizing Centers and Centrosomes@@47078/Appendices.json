Thus, the number of individual centrioles doubles during S phase.\n- Immediately after completion of S phase and into G2, the cell therefore contains the two original centrioles plus two newly formed procentrioles, for a total of four individual centrioles. These are organized as two engaged pairs that will not separate into two distinct centrosomes until entry into mitosis.\n- Therefore, at G2 (just after S phase), the total number of centrioles in the single cell is four, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323476"}, {"introduction": "Having established the numerical precision of the centrosome cycle, we now turn to the practical challenge of observing this process in living cells.

A key event in the cell cycle is the duplication and separation of the centrosome, which functions as the primary Microtubule-Organizing Center (MTOC) in these cells. To visualize the location of the centrosome in living cells using fluorescence microscopy, the researcher plans to create a fusion protein. This involves genetically modifying the cells to express a protein of interest tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a protein that emits green light when exposed to blue light.\n\nThe goal is to choose a target protein whose localization is highly specific to the MTOC, such that the GFP signal will precisely mark the location of the centrosome itself, rather than the structures that emanate from it or other cellular components. Which of the following proteins, if fused with GFP, would be the most suitable marker for specifically visualizing the MTOC?\n\nA. Alpha-tubulin\n\nB. Actin\n\nC. Gamma-tubulin\n\nD. Myosin II\n\nE. Vimentin", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the most suitable protein to tag with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to specifically visualize the Microtubule-Organizing Center (MTOC), which in animal cells is the centrosome. The key is to find a protein that is an integral and specific component of the centrosome itself.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Alpha-tubulin: Alpha-tubulin is a globular protein that, along with beta-tubulin, forms heterodimers. These heterodimers are the fundamental building blocks (subunits) that polymerize to form microtubules. While microtubules originate from the MTOC, they extend throughout the cytoplasm. Therefore, tagging alpha-tubulin with GFP would cause the entire microtubule network to fluoresce, not just the MTOC. This would not provide a specific signal for the centrosome's location.\n\nB. Actin: Actin is the protein subunit that forms microfilaments, another major component of the cytoskeleton. Microfilaments are involved in cell shape, motility, and muscle contraction. They are distinct from the microtubule system and are not a component of the centrosome. Tagging actin would illuminate the actin cytoskeleton, which is irrelevant for locating the MTOC.\n\nC. Gamma-tubulin: Gamma-tubulin ($\\gamma$-tubulin) is a type of tubulin that is found predominantly in the pericentriolar material of the centrosome. It forms a structure known as the gamma-tubulin ring complex ($\\gamma$-TuRC). This complex serves as the template for the nucleation of microtubules, marking the starting point of their assembly. Because it is a core, stable component of the structure where microtubules originate, tagging $\\gamma$-tubulin with GFP provides a highly specific and concentrated fluorescent signal precisely at the location of the MTOC. This makes it an ideal marker for tracking the centrosome.\n\nD. Myosin II: Myosin II is a motor protein that interacts with actin filaments to generate force, most notably in muscle contraction and cytokinesis (the final stage of cell division). It is part of the actin-based cytoskeletal system, not the microtubule system, and is not located at the MTOC.\n\nE. Vimentin: Vimentin is a protein that forms intermediate filaments, a third major type of cytoskeletal element. Intermediate filaments provide mechanical strength and support to the cell and nucleus. Vimentin is not a component of the centrosome. Tagging it would light up the intermediate filament network.\n\nBased on this analysis, Gamma-tubulin is the only protein listed that is a specific and localized component of the MTOC. Therefore, a GFP-gamma-tubulin fusion protein would serve as the most accurate and specific marker for visualizing the centrosome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323483"}, {"introduction": "The centrosome's primary role is to organize the cell's microtubule cytoskeleton, a network that is anything but static. This final practice [@problem_id:2323506] explores the crucial concept of microtubule dynamic instability and how it can be pharmacologically manipulated. By predicting the effects of a well-known anti-cancer drug, Taxol, you will connect the molecular function of the MTOC to the large-scale behavior of the cytoskeleton, a principle with significant biomedical relevance.", "problem": "An actively growing animal cell in interphase features a prominent microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), the centrosome, from which microtubules are nucleated. These microtubules are polar structures with their minus ends embedded in the pericentriolar material of the centrosome and their plus ends extending into the cytoplasm. Under normal conditions, these microtubules exhibit dynamic instability, a process characterized by alternating phases of polymerization (growth) and rapid depolymerization (catastrophe), which allows the cell to remodel its cytoskeleton. The cell is then treated with Taxol, an anti-cancer drug that binds to the beta-tubulin subunit within existing microtubules and stabilizes them.\n\nBased on the mechanism of Taxol, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and accurate prediction for the state of the microtubule network originating from the centrosome shortly after the treatment begins?\n\nA. Microtubule nucleation at the centrosome will be inhibited, leading to a gradual disappearance of the microtubule array as existing microtubules depolymerize.\n\nB. The rate of catastrophe will increase significantly, causing most microtubules to rapidly shrink back to the centrosome.\n\nC. The rate of microtubule depolymerization will be suppressed, leading to an accumulation of unusually long and stable microtubules that remain anchored to the centrosome, and a depletion of the free tubulin dimer pool.\n\nD. Microtubules will detach from the centrosome and form numerous, short, stable fragments throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nE. The microtubules will be frozen at their current lengths, and all dynamic activity, including both polymerization and depolymerization, will cease immediately.", "solution": "The centrosome functions as the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells, with microtubules nucleated from the pericentriolar material and minus ends anchored while plus ends explore the cytoplasm. Under normal conditions, microtubules display dynamic instability: alternating phases of growth and shrinkage governed by the presence or loss of a stabilizing GTP-tubulin cap at plus ends. Catastrophe corresponds to loss of the cap and rapid depolymerization; rescue corresponds to regaining stability and re-entry into growth.\n\nTaxol binds within the polymer lattice to tubulin subunits of existing microtubules and stabilizes the polymerized state, particularly stabilizing GDP-tubulin that would otherwise favor depolymerization. The direct mechanistic consequences are:\n- Suppression of depolymerization at microtubule ends, thereby decreasing catastrophe frequency and increasing rescue probability.\n- Stabilization of existing microtubules without disassembly from the centrosome, because anchoring interactions at the minus ends persist.\n- A shift in the steady-state balance toward the polymerized state, so that, so long as some polymerization continues at plus ends and depolymerization is suppressed, the total polymer mass increases.\n- As polymer mass increases while disassembly is inhibited, the pool of free tubulin dimers becomes depleted.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because Taxol does not directly inhibit nucleation at the centrosome; instead, it stabilizes polymers and tends to increase overall polymer mass rather than cause disappearance.\n- B is the opposite of Taxol’s effect; catastrophe frequency is reduced, not increased.\n- C matches the mechanism: suppression of depolymerization leads to unusually long, stable microtubules that remain centrosome-anchored and consume the soluble tubulin pool.\n- D is incorrect; Taxol does not promote detachment and fragmentation from the centrosome.\n- E is too strong; Taxol suppresses dynamics, especially shrinkage, but does not instantaneously freeze all polymerization and depolymerization at current lengths.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate prediction is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323506"}]}
