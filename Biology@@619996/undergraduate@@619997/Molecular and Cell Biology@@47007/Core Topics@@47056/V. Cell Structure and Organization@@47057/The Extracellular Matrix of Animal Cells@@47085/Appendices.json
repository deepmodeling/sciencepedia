This first practice delves into collagen, the most abundant protein in the ECM, to explore how its remarkable strength is achieved.

[@problem_id:2294906]", "problem": "Collagen is the most abundant protein in the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) of animal tissues, providing essential structural support. Its fundamental unit is a triple helix, formed by three polypeptide chains known as alpha-chains. The primary structure of these chains is characterized by a repeating amino acid motif, Gly-X-Y, where 'Gly' is glycine, 'X' is often proline, and 'Y' is often hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline is not one of the 20 standard amino acids specified by the genetic code; instead, it is synthesized from proline residues in a post-translational modification reaction catalyzed by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder that results in a completely non-functional prolyl hydroxylase enzyme. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the direct consequence of this enzymatic defect on the structure of their collagen molecules?\n\nA. The primary sequence of the collagen polypeptides will be altered, as the genetic code for hydroxyproline is missing.\n\nB. The individual alpha-chains will fold into stable globular proteins instead of helical chains.\n\nC. The stability of the assembled collagen triple helix will be significantly decreased.\n\nD. The collagen triple helix will be more stable and rigid than normal.\n\nE. There will be no effect on collagen structure, as the hydroxylation of proline is an optional modification with little structural importance.", "solution": "We begin by distinguishing primary structure from post-translational modification. The primary sequence of a protein is determined by the genetic code at translation and consists solely of the 20 standard amino acids. Hydroxyproline is not encoded by the genetic code; it arises from a post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues within the Gly-X-Y motif of collagen, catalyzed by prolyl hydroxylase. Therefore, a non-functional prolyl hydroxylase cannot alter the primary amino acid sequence; instead, it prevents the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline after translation. Hence, statement A is incorrect.\n\nNext, consider the folding and assembly of collagen. Collagen alpha-chains form left-handed helices that assemble into a right-handed triple helix. Hydroxyproline is critical for stabilizing the collagen triple helix via stereoelectronic effects and hydrogen bonding networks (including water-mediated hydrogen bonds), increasing the thermal stability of the triple helix. In the absence of prolyl hydroxylase activity, proline residues remain unhydroxylated, diminishing these stabilizing interactions and thereby decreasing the stability (melting temperature) of the triple helix. This is exemplified clinically in states of ascorbate deficiency (required cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase), such as scurvy, where collagen triple helices are destabilized.\n\nRegarding the options:\n- A is false because the primary sequence is unchanged by the lack of a post-translational modification.\n- B is false because collagen alpha-chains do not become stable globular proteins; the defect impairs triple-helix stability rather than redirecting folding to a globular state.\n- C is true because the absence of hydroxyproline directly reduces triple-helix stability.\n- D is false because the modification normally stabilizes the helix; its absence cannot increase stability.\n- E is false because hydroxylation of proline is structurally important; its absence has significant effects on collagen stability.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the stability of the assembled collagen triple helix will be significantly decreased.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294906"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the structure of a key ECM component, we now shift our focus to the vital connection between the cell and its surroundings. This next exercise centers on integrins, the transmembrane proteins that form the molecular bridge linking the external ECM to the cell's internal cytoskeleton. By considering the consequence of a non-functional integrin subunit, you will appreciate why the complete, heterodimeric structure of these receptors is essential for cell adhesion and the overall organization of tissues. [@problem_id:2341884]", "problem": "In multicellular animals, the structural integrity and communication within tissues are heavily dependent on the Extracellular Matrix (ECM), a complex network of secreted macromolecules. Cells anchor themselves to this matrix and to each other through various cell-surface receptors. A critical family of transmembrane receptor proteins involved in linking the cell's internal cytoskeleton to the ECM are the integrins. Functional integrins are heterodimers, meaning they are composed of two distinct polypeptide chains, an α-subunit and a β-subunit, which must associate to form a complete receptor. This integrin heterodimer then binds to specific proteins in the ECM, such as fibronectin, which in turn are often attached to larger structural fibers like collagen. On the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, integrins connect to the cell's actin cytoskeleton through a complex of adapter proteins.\n\nConsider a specialized line of fibroblast cells being studied in a laboratory. Through genetic engineering, a mutation is introduced that results in the synthesis of a non-functional integrin β-subunit. This mutated subunit is unable to properly associate with the wild-type α-subunit to form a stable heterodimer.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most direct consequence of this specific mutation on the cell's relationship with its environment?\n\nA. The cell will be unable to form desmosomes for cell-to-cell adhesion.\n\nB. The cell will lose its ability to physically connect its internal actin cytoskeleton to fibronectin molecules in the ECM.\n\nC. The fibronectin proteins within the ECM will fail to polymerize and bind to collagen fibers.\n\nD. The cell will significantly increase its rate of collagen and fibronectin secretion to compensate for the weak adhesion.\n\nE. The cell's actin cytoskeleton will completely depolymerize due to the loss of external tension signals.", "solution": "We identify the core biological principle: integrins are transmembrane receptors that function as heterodimers composed of an $\\alpha$- and a $\\beta$-subunit. Both subunits must associate to form a stable, functional receptor. If the $\\beta$-subunit is non-functional and cannot associate with the $\\alpha$-subunit, functional integrins will not be assembled or presented effectively at the cell surface.\n\nIntegrins mediate cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, binding ECM ligands such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen (directly or indirectly), and connect on the cytoplasmic side to the actin cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins (e.g., talin, vinculin, kindlin, paxillin) to form focal adhesions. This linkage enables both mechanical anchoring and bidirectional signaling (inside-out and outside-in). In fibroblasts, a key integrin for fibronectin binding is $\\alpha_{5}\\beta_{1}$; without a functional $\\beta$-subunit, this receptor cannot form, preventing fibronectin binding and the actin linkage.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A is incorrect because desmosomes are cell-to-cell junctions mediated by cadherins (desmogleins and desmocollins) and link to intermediate filaments, not integrins.\n- B is the direct consequence: without a functional integrin heterodimer, the cell cannot bind fibronectin nor connect this extracellular ligand to its intracellular actin cytoskeleton through focal adhesion complexes.\n- C, while fibronectin fibrillogenesis is facilitated by integrin-mediated tension, the statement that fibronectin in the ECM will fail to polymerize and bind collagen is not the most direct and is broader than the immediate effect on this single cell’s integrins; moreover, existing ECM fibronectin can still exist independently of this single cell’s integrins.\n- D is speculative and compensatory, not a necessary or direct outcome of integrin loss; secretion rates are regulated and may not increase significantly or immediately.\n- E is incorrect because actin dynamics are regulated by many pathways; loss of integrin signaling reorganizes focal adhesions and stress fibers but does not cause complete depolymerization.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most direct consequence is the loss of the physical connection between the cell’s actin cytoskeleton and ECM fibronectin due to failure to form functional integrin heterodimers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2341884"}, {"introduction": "The ECM is not a permanent scaffold but a highly dynamic structure that is constantly remodeled during development, wound healing, and disease.
