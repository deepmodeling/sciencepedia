This first exercise explores the most fundamental rule for entering the secretory pathway. By considering the consequence of removing the N-terminal signal sequence—the essential entry ticket to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)—you will solidify your understanding of this critical first step in protein sorting [@problem_id:2339416].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the ultimate destination of a newly synthesized protein is dictated by specific amino acid sequences that act as sorting signals. A well-studied example is the pathway for proteins destined for secretion. This process begins with translation on a free ribosome in the cytoplasm. A special N-terminal signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide targets the ribosome-mRNA complex to the membrane of the rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). This allows the protein to be fed into the ER lumen as translation proceeds, marking its entry into the secretory pathway, which continues through the Golgi apparatus and ends with exocytosis from the cell.\n\nConsider a scenario in a cell biology laboratory where a gene encoding a typical secreted protein is genetically modified. The modification consists of the precise deletion of the codons corresponding to the protein's N-terminal signal sequence. The rest of the gene remains intact, and this altered gene is successfully transcribed and translated within the cell. Assuming this protein does not possess any other targeting signals for other organelles, what will be the final, predominant location of this modified protein?\n\nA. Secreted into the extracellular space\nB. Freely diffusing in the cytoplasm\nC. Embedded within the plasma membrane\nD. Accumulated in the nucleus\nE. Trapped within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus", "solution": "Translation of virtually all eukaryotic proteins initiates on free ribosomes in the cytosol. Proteins destined for the secretory pathway possess an N-terminal ER signal sequence that is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough ER membrane, where translation resumes with co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen. From there, the protein proceeds through the Golgi and can be secreted, inserted into membranes, or targeted to endomembrane compartments.\n\nIf the codons encoding the N-terminal ER signal sequence are precisely deleted, SRP cannot recognize or bind the nascent polypeptide. Consequently, the ribosome remains free in the cytosol and translation proceeds entirely in the cytoplasm. Upon termination, the complete polypeptide is released into the cytosol.\n\nIn the absence of any other targeting signals (e.g., no nuclear localization signal, no mitochondrial targeting sequence, no peroxisomal targeting signal, no internal signal-anchor for membranes), the default localization of a polypeptide is the cytosol. Therefore, the predominant location of the modified protein will be the cytoplasm.\n\nBy elimination of the options:\n- It cannot be secreted (A) or accumulate in the Golgi (E) because it never enters the ER.\n- It will not be embedded in the plasma membrane (C) because membrane insertion for secretory/membrane proteins requires ER targeting and often signal-anchor sequences.\n- It will not accumulate in the nucleus (D) without an explicit nuclear localization signal.\nThus, the correct choice is freely diffusing in the cytoplasm (B).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2339416"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein successfully enters the RER, it encounters a host of enzymes that modify and prepare it for its final role. This next practice presents a hypothetical scenario where one of these key enzymes, signal peptidase, is non-functional. This problem challenges you to think like a molecular detective, predicting how the cellular machinery adapts to this failure and what this reveals about the dual nature of signal sequences as both targeting signals and potential membrane anchors [@problem_id:2339450].", "problem": "In a typical eukaryotic cell, enzymes destined for the lysosome, such as lysosomal hydrolases, are synthesized on ribosomes and co-translationally imported into the lumen of the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER). This process is guided by an N-terminal signal sequence on the growing polypeptide chain. This signal sequence directs the ribosome to the RER membrane via the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and its corresponding receptor. Once the polypeptide is being threaded through a protein channel called the translocon, an RER-resident enzyme called signal peptidase normally cleaves off the signal sequence, releasing the soluble protein into the RER lumen for further processing and transport to the lysosome.\n\nImagine a genetically engineered cell line where the gene encoding for signal peptidase has been mutated, rendering the enzyme completely non-functional. All other cellular components, including the SRP, SRP receptor, translocon, and the machinery for vesicular transport and protein sorting (such as the mannose-6-phosphate or M6P pathway), remain fully functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected fate of a newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolase in this mutant cell line?\n\nA. The hydrolase will be synthesized as a transmembrane protein embedded in the RER membrane and will ultimately be transported to the lysosomal membrane, with its active site facing the lysosomal lumen.\nB. The synthesis of the hydrolase will be completed in the cytoplasm, and the protein will accumulate there because it cannot enter the RER.\nC. Translation of the hydrolase will be permanently halted by the SRP, and the incomplete polypeptide will be degraded in the cytoplasm.\nD. The hydrolase will be successfully synthesized as a soluble protein in the RER lumen but, due to the presence of the uncleaved signal sequence, it will be misfolded and targeted for degradation within the RER.\nE. The hydrolase will be correctly synthesized and trafficked to the lysosome, but it will be secreted from the cell instead because the uncleaved signal sequence acts as an export signal.", "solution": "A newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolase carries an N-terminal signal sequence that is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). First, SRP binding to the emerging signal sequence from the ribosome transiently pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the SRP receptor at the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER). This step is unaffected because SRP and its receptor are functional in the mutant.\n\nSecond, once docked, the ribosome engages the translocon, translation resumes, and the nascent polypeptide begins co-translational translocation across the membrane. The hydrophobic signal sequence acts as a start-transfer sequence to initiate translocation. Normally, signal peptidase cleaves the signal sequence on the luminal side, releasing the protein into the RER lumen as a soluble protein. In the mutant, signal peptidase is non-functional, so cleavage does not occur.\n\nThird, without cleavage, the hydrophobic signal sequence remains embedded in the membrane and functions as a permanent transmembrane anchor. The polypeptide continues to be threaded into the lumen, resulting in a protein that is tethered to the membrane with its N-terminus and the bulk of its catalytic domain facing the RER lumen. It effectively becomes a Type I transmembrane protein, anchored by its uncleaved signal sequence.\n\nFourth, the luminal domain undergoes normal RER and Golgi processing, including N-linked glycosylation and addition of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) in the cis-Golgi, because its catalytic domain is luminal and accessible to the processing enzymes. The M6P-dependent sorting machinery in the trans-Golgi network remains functional, so the protein is packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles via M6P receptors and trafficked along the endolysosomal pathway.\n\nFinally, upon delivery, because the protein is membrane-anchored by its uncleaved signal peptide, it is inserted into the lysosomal membrane rather than being a soluble luminal enzyme. Its catalytic domain remains oriented toward the lysosomal lumen, consistent with lysosomal hydrolytic function. Therefore, it is neither trapped in the cytosol (rejecting B), nor permanently translation-arrested by SRP (rejecting C), nor soluble and misfolded solely due to the uncleaved signal peptide (rejecting D), nor secreted as a soluble protein (rejecting E). The correct description is that it becomes a membrane protein whose active site faces the lysosomal lumen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339450"}, {"introduction": "Beyond being a simple entry point and processing station, the RER serves as a crucial quality control checkpoint, ensuring that only correctly folded proteins proceed through the secretory pathway. This final practice delves into the sophisticated mechanism of the calnexin cycle, a key part of this surveillance system. By analyzing a specific mutation in glucosidase II, you will dissect the intricate molecular logic that allows the cell to distinguish between folded and unfolded glycoproteins, a process vital for cellular health [@problem_id:2339430].", "problem": "In the quality control system for glycoprotein folding within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the calnexin cycle plays a crucial role. A newly synthesized polypeptide is typically co-translationally modified by the attachment of a pre-formed oligosaccharide with the structure $Glc_3Man_9GlcNAc_2$. Sequential trimming of glucose residues by glucosidase I and glucosidase II generates a monoglucosylated glycan ($Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$), which serves as the recognition signal for the lectin-like chaperone calnexin. Binding to calnexin facilitates proper folding. For the protein to be released from calnexin and assessed for correct folding, this final glucose residue must be removed by glucosidase II. If the protein is found to be misfolded, the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) can add a glucose back, allowing the protein to re-bind calnexin for another folding attempt.\n\nConsider a mutant cell line where the gene encoding glucosidase II has a specific point mutation. This mutation renders the enzyme capable of its first catalytic action (removing the second glucose from the initial $Glc_3$ glycan to produce the monoglucosylated form) but completely inhibits its second catalytic action (removing the final, innermost glucose from the monoglucosylated glycan).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this specific mutation on the calnexin folding cycle for a newly synthesized glycoprotein in this cell line?\n\nA. The glycoprotein will bind to calnexin but will be permanently trapped in the complex, arresting the folding and quality control cycle.\nB. The glycoprotein will be unable to bind to calnexin in the first place, causing it to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.\nC. The glycoprotein will cycle through calnexin binding and release much faster than normal, leading to the export of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.\nD. The glycoprotein, once bound to calnexin, will be immediately released and recognized as misfolded by UGGT, causing it to enter a futile cycle of re-glucosylation and re-binding.\nE. The glycoprotein will be correctly deglucosylated but will fail to be recognized by calnexin, bypassing the quality control cycle entirely.", "solution": "The core quality-control logic is as follows:\n1) A pre-formed N-linked glycan $Glc_{3}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$ is transferred to the polypeptide. Glucosidase I removes the outermost glucose to give $Glc_{2}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$.\n2) Glucosidase II removes the next glucose to generate the monoglucosylated glycan $Glc_{1}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$, which is the specific ligand for calnexin. Calnexin binding facilitates folding.\n3) For release from calnexin, glucosidase II must remove the final glucose, converting $Glc_{1}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$ to $Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$. If the protein is misfolded, UGGT adds back a single glucose to $Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$, regenerating $Glc_{1}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$ to re-enter the calnexin cycle.\n\nGiven the mutation: glucosidase II retains only its first catalytic step (removing the second glucose from $Glc_{3}$ to form $Glc_{1}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$) but cannot perform its second step (removing the final, innermost glucose from the monoglucosylated glycan). Therefore:\n- The glycoprotein reaches the monoglucosylated state $Glc_{1}Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$ and binds calnexin normally.\n- It cannot be deglucosylated to $Man_{9}GlcNAc_{2}$, so it cannot be released from calnexin.\n- Without release, the substrate does not present the deglucosylated form required for UGGT recognition; thus, re-glucosylation cycling cannot proceed.\n- The primary consequence is persistent trapping in the calnexin complex, arresting the folding/quality-control cycle.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339430"}]}
