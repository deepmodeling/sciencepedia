Patients with this disorder exhibit normal mitochondrial function and a standard rate of overall cellular metabolism. However, their cells show a significant accumulation of hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$), a reactive oxygen species that can cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Further analysis reveals a specific mutation that renders the peroxisomal enzyme catalase catalytically inactive.\n\nPeroxisomes carry out various metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids. A key feature of these oxidative reactions is the use of molecular oxygen to remove hydrogen atoms from organic substrates (represented as $RH_2$), following the general reaction:\n$$RH_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow R + H_2O_2$$\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the toxic accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in these patients' cells under normal metabolic conditions?\n\nA. The defective catalase enzyme begins to actively produce hydrogen peroxide instead of breaking it down.\n\nB. Hydrogen peroxide, normally produced in mitochondria, leaks into the cytoplasm and cannot be neutralized by the defective peroxisomes.\n\nC. The production of hydrogen peroxide is a normal byproduct of oxidative reactions within peroxisomes, and the cell's inability to neutralize it is due to the non-functional catalase.\n\nD. The genetic disorder causes an overall increase in the rate of cellular metabolism, leading to an overproduction of hydrogen peroxide that overwhelms the cell's antioxidant systems.\n\nE. The mutation in catalase prevents the import of fatty acids into the peroxisome, causing them to accumulate and spontaneously generate hydrogen peroxide in the cytoplasm.", "solution": "We are told that mitochondria function normally and overall cellular metabolism is normal, but there is a peroxisomal catalase mutation rendering catalase inactive and cells accumulate hydrogen peroxide. Peroxisomes perform oxidative reactions that inherently generate hydrogen peroxide via oxidases that use molecular oxygen to dehydrogenate substrates, as summarized by the given general peroxisomal reaction:\n$$\nRH_{2} + O_{2} \\rightarrow R + H_{2}O_{2}.\n$$\nUnder normal conditions, the hydrogen peroxide produced in peroxisomes is detoxified primarily by peroxisomal catalase via the disproportionation reaction:\n$$\n2 H_{2}O_{2} \\rightarrow 2 H_{2}O + O_{2}.\n$$\nThe steady-state concentration of peroxisomal hydrogen peroxide can be described symbolically by the balance\n$$\n\\frac{d[H_{2}O_{2}]}{dt} = v_{\\text{prod}} - v_{\\text{detox}},\n$$\nwhere $v_{\\text{prod}}$ is the rate of $H_{2}O_{2}$ production by peroxisomal oxidases (a normal consequence of peroxisomal metabolism) and $v_{\\text{detox}}$ is the rate of $H_{2}O_{2}$ removal by catalase and other peroxidases. For catalase, an effective kinetic form is\n$$\nv_{\\text{detox,catalase}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[\\text{catalase}][H_{2}O_{2}],\n$$\nwith $k_{\\text{cat}}$ a symbol for the effective rate constant under the relevant conditions. If catalase is catalytically inactive, then the effective $k_{\\text{cat}}$ for catalase is zero, so the dominant peroxisomal $H_{2}O_{2}$ detoxification pathway is abolished.

The nucleus", "solution": "Principle of protein targeting: cytosolic ribosomes synthesize most cellular proteins, and their final destination is dictated by specific targeting signals. In the absence of a targeting signal, the default localization for a soluble protein synthesized on free ribosomes is the cytosol.\n\nNormal ACOX1 localization relies on a C-terminal Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1), typically a tripeptide motif, which is recognized by the cytosolic receptor Pex5. This receptor-cargo complex docks at the peroxisomal membrane and mediates translocation of the folded enzyme into the peroxisomal matrix. Therefore, the presence of the PTS1 is necessary and sufficient for peroxisomal import of many matrix proteins.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, the codons encoding the C-terminal PTS1 are removed while the rest of the protein, including its active site and overall fold, remains intact. Without the PTS1, the mutant ACOX1 lacks the peroxisomal targeting information and thus cannot be recognized by Pex5, preventing peroxisomal import.\n\nExclusion of alternative compartments:\n- Endoplasmic reticulum lumen: requires an N-terminal signal peptide that directs co-translational translocation via SRP and the Sec61 translocon. ACOX1 lacks such a signal; removing the C-terminal PTS1 does not create an ER signal.\n- Mitochondrial matrix: requires an N-terminal amphipathic presequence for import via TOM/TIM complexes. ACOX1 does not have this; the mutation does not introduce it.\n- Nucleus: requires a nuclear localization signal (clusters of basic residues) recognized by importins. ACOX1 does not contain such an NLS; removing PTS1 does not generate one.\n- Peroxisome: requires PTS1 (or PTS2, an N-terminal signal distinct from PTS1). The problem states only PTS1 is present and it has been removed; there is no mention of a functional PTS2 for ACOX1.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of any targeting signal and given correct folding and stability, the mutant ACOX1 will remain in and accumulate in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329354"}, {"introduction": "Moving from principle to practice, how do researchers experimentally confirm that a newly discovered protein actually resides and functions within the peroxisome?

Based on its predicted function in purine metabolism, they hypothesize that XDH2 is localized to the matrix of peroxisomes. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported from the cytosol via a C-terminal targeting signal known as Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1), a short three-amino-acid sequence (like -Ser-Lys-Leu) at the very end of the protein.\n\nTo experimentally verify the subcellular location of XDH2, the team decides to use a protein-tagging strategy involving Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a naturally fluorescent protein from the jellyfish *Aequorea victoria*. They will create a genetic construct that fuses the coding sequence of XDH2 with the coding sequence for GFP, transfect this construct into mammalian cells, and then use fluorescence microscopy to observe the location of the resulting fusion protein.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs is the most appropriate and conclusive for testing the hypothesis that the full-length XDH2 protein is targeted to the peroxisomal matrix?\n\nA.

Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the N-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence. Transfect this `GFP-XDH2` construct into cells.

Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of the final three C-terminal amino acids of XDH2 to the C-terminus of the GFP coding sequence. Transfect this construct into cells and observe the location of the green fluorescence.", "solution": "The goal is to determine if the full-length protein XDH2 localizes to the peroxisomal matrix. This can be achieved by creating a fusion protein with a fluorescent reporter like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and observing its location in living or fixed cells using fluorescence microscopy.\n\nFirst, we must consider the mechanism of peroxisomal protein import. The problem states that most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess a C-terminal Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1). This signal is a short amino acid sequence at the extreme C-terminus of the protein that is recognized by the import receptor PEX5 in the cytosol, which then mediates transport into the peroxisome. The key feature is that the signal must be at the very end of the protein to be recognized.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the C-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence (`XDH2-GFP`).**\nThis design is flawed. Fusing the entire GFP protein (which is about 238 amino acids long) to the C-terminus of XDH2 would place GFP *after* the putative PTS1 signal. This would block the signal, making it inaccessible to the PEX5 import receptor. As a result, the fusion protein would likely fail to be imported into the peroxisome and would remain in the cytosol, leading to a false-negative result. This experiment would incorrectly suggest that XDH2 is not a peroxisomal protein.\n\n**B. Create a construct that fuses the coding sequence of GFP to the N-terminus of the XDH2 coding sequence (`GFP-XDH2`). Then, stain for a known peroxisomal marker and check for co-localization.**\nThis is the most appropriate design. By fusing GFP to the N-terminus of XDH2, the C-terminus of XDH2 remains free and exposed. If XDH2 has a functional PTS1 signal, it will be accessible to the import machinery, and the entire `GFP-XDH2` fusion protein should be transported into the peroxisomes. To confirm this, it is essential to demonstrate that the green signal from GFP is in the same location as a known peroxisomal marker. Staining the cells with an antibody for a peroxisomal protein (like the peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70) tagged with a red fluorophore allows for a co-localization analysis. If the green (GFP-XDH2) and red (PMP70) signals overlap perfectly when the images are merged, it provides strong, conclusive evidence that XDH2 is indeed targeted to peroxisomes.\n\n**C. Create a construct that expresses only GFP (`GFP-only`).**\nThis experiment represents an important control, but it is not the primary experiment to test the hypothesis. When expressed alone, GFP is a relatively small protein that lacks any specific targeting signals. Consequently, it diffuses passively throughout the cytosol and, due to its small size, can also enter the nucleus. Observing this diffuse pattern confirms that the GFP tag itself does not have an intrinsic affinity for peroxisomes. While this control is necessary to interpret the main experiment correctly, it does not provide any information about the localization of XDH2.\n\n**D. Create a construct that expresses only the native, untagged XDH2 protein and detect with an anti-GFP antibody.**\nThis design is nonsensical. Immunofluorescence relies on an antibody binding specifically to its target antigen. If the cells are expressing only untagged XDH2, there is no GFP protein present. Therefore, an antibody against GFP will have nothing to bind to, and the experiment will yield no signal and no information. To detect the native protein, one would need an antibody specific to XDH2 itself.\n\n**E. Create a construct that fuses the C-terminal tripeptide of XDH2 to the C-terminus of GFP.**\nThis experiment tests a related but different hypothesis. It specifically asks whether the C-terminal sequence of XDH2 is *sufficient* to act as a peroxisomal targeting signal. If the resulting GFP-tripeptide fusion protein localizes to peroxisomes, it strongly suggests that the sequence is a functional PTS1. However, this experiment does not test the localization of the *full-length* XDH2 protein. It is possible, though less common, that other domains within the full-length XDH2 protein could mask the PTS1 or contain a different, dominant targeting signal that directs the protein elsewhere. Therefore, while informative, this experiment is not as conclusive for determining the final destination of the entire XDH2 protein as the experiment described in option B.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B describes the most complete and direct experimental strategy to determine if the full-length XDH2 protein is localized to the peroxisomal matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2329348"}]}
