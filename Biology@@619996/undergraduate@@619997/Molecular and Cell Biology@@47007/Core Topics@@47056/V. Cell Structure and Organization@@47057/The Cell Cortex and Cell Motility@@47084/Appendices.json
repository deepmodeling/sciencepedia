This exercise introduces a key experimental technique, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), which allows us to measure protein dynamics in real time. By comparing the behavior of GFP-actin in a dynamic lamellipodium versus a stable stress fiber, you will gain an intuitive feel for the concept of cytoskeletal turnover and how it differs between cellular compartments [@problem_id:2340746].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in a motile human fibroblast. The cells have been engineered to express actin fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), making the actin cytoskeleton fluorescent. The biologist performs a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment on two distinct actin-based structures within the same cell:\n1.  A stable, thick actin stress fiber located in the cell body.\n2.  The dynamic, branched actin network within the lamellipodium at the cell's leading edge.\n\nIn each experiment, a small, circular region within the target structure is irreversibly photobleached using a high-intensity laser, and the subsequent recovery of fluorescence in that region is monitored over time. Based on your understanding of actin dynamics in these two structures, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the FRAP experiments?\n\nA. The lamellipodium will show a faster and more complete fluorescence recovery compared to the stress fiber.\n\nB. The stress fiber will show a faster and more complete fluorescence recovery because it contains a higher density of actin filaments.\n\nC. Both structures will exhibit nearly identical fluorescence recovery rates and completeness, as both are composed of GFP-actin.\n\nD. Neither structure will show significant fluorescence recovery, as actin filaments are highly stable polymers and do not exchange subunits once assembled.\n\nE. The stress fiber will show complete but slow recovery, while the lamellipodium will show rapid but incomplete recovery due to the constant retrograde flow of the entire network.", "solution": "We model FRAP recovery in each structure by the standard first-order kinetics for the mobile fraction. Let $F(t)$ be the normalized fluorescence in the bleached region, with $F(0)$ the post-bleach value and $F_{\\infty}$ the asymptotic recovery. Under a single-exponential approximation, the recovery follows\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt}=\\frac{F_{\\infty}-F(t)}{\\tau} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad F(t)=F_{\\infty}\\left(1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)+F(0)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right).\n$$\nThe key measurable parameters are the characteristic time $\\tau$ (or equivalently $t_{1/2}=\\tau\\ln 2$) and the mobile fraction $f_{m}$, where $F_{\\infty}=f_{m}$ when $F(0)$ is set to zero by normalization and the immobile fraction is $f_{i}=1-f_{m}$.\n\nFor the lamellipodium, the dynamic, branched actin network is characterized by rapid polymerization at barbed ends near the leading edge (large $k_{\\text{on}}c$) and rapid turnover due to severing and depolymerization (large effective $k_{\\text{off}}$), driven by Arp2/3-mediated branching, cofilin activity, and continual assembly-disassembly cycles. These dynamics yield a small $\\tau$ (fast recovery) and a large $f_{m}$ (near-complete recovery), since most GFP-actin subunits are exchanging on the experimental timescale. Retrograde flow translates the network but does not prevent subunit exchange from repopulating the bleached region; thus it does not impose an incomplete recovery in a stationary observation frame for subunit FRAP.\n\nFor the stress fiber, a stable, contractile actomyosin bundle stabilized by crosslinkers (for example, $\\alpha$-actinin) and tropomyosin exhibits reduced subunit exchange at filament sides and fewer accessible barbed ends for rapid turnover. Myosin II activity and extensive crosslinking reduce the effective on-off exchange within the bleached region, producing a larger $\\tau$ (slow recovery) and a significant immobile fraction $f_{i}>0$ (incomplete recovery), since a subset of actin remains stably incorporated over the FRAP timescale.\n\nTherefore, comparing the parameters, the lamellipodium has $\\tau_{\\text{lam}}<\\tau_{\\text{SF}}$ and $f_{m,\\text{lam}}>f_{m,\\text{SF}}$, predicting faster and more complete fluorescence recovery in the lamellipodium than in the stress fiber. This matches statement A and contradicts B (stress fibers do not recover faster simply due to filament density), C (compositional GFP does not equalize dynamics), D (actin polymers do exchange subunits), and E (lamellipodial recovery is typically rapid and near-complete, while stress fibers often recover incompletely).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340746"}, {"introduction": "The diverse and dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton is not random; it is precisely controlled by complex signaling networks. This problem explores the role of the Rho family of small GTPases, which act as molecular switches to orchestrate cytoskeletal organization. By considering the effect of a constitutively active form of RhoA, you will connect a specific signaling molecule to a major morphological outcome—the assembly of contractile stress fibers—highlighting a fundamental principle of cell shape regulation [@problem_id:2340790].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern cell shape and adhesion. They are working with a line of human fibroblast cells, which normally exhibit a spread-out, motile phenotype characterized by dynamic cell edges. To probe the function of the actin cytoskeleton, the researchers engineer these cells to overexpress a specific mutant protein: a version of the Guanine nucleotide Triphosphate-binding protein (GTPase) RhoA that has a glutamine-to-leucine substitution at position 63 (RhoA-Q63L). This mutation impairs the protein's intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis activity, effectively locking it in a permanently active, Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. The cells are then cultured under standard conditions for 24 hours to allow for protein expression.\n\nBased on the known signaling pathways involving RhoA, what is the most likely morphological outcome for the cells expressing the constitutively active RhoA-Q63L, when compared to a control population of untransfected fibroblasts?\n\nA. The cells will form an extensive network of thin, spike-like membrane protrusions known as filopodia, and their overall migratory speed will increase.\n\nB. The cells will flatten and extend broad, sheet-like membrane ruffles called lamellipodia at their leading edge, adopting a fan-like shape.\n\nC. The cells will contract, become more rounded, and develop thick, prominent bundles of cytoskeletal filaments known as stress fibers, which terminate in strong adhesion sites.\n\nD. The cells will lose all organized actin structures, leading to a complete collapse of the cytoskeleton and immediate cell lysis.\n\nE. The cells' morphology will be indistinguishable from the control cells, as the activity of other related GTPases will functionally compensate for the overactive RhoA.", "solution": "We begin from the molecular nature of the engineered protein. The RhoA-Q63L substitution impairs intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, so the protein is locked in the active, GTP-bound state. Therefore, the RhoA signaling pathway is constitutively engaged.\n\nActive RhoA-GTP binds and activates canonical downstream effectors, most prominently Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCK) and the formin mDia. ROCK increases actomyosin contractility by two coordinated mechanisms: it directly phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain and inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase, both of which raise steady-state phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain and thereby increase nonmuscle myosin II activity. Increased myosin II activity promotes tension within actin filament bundles. In parallel, mDia promotes linear actin polymerization and bundling. Together, these effects drive the formation of thick, contractile actin bundles spanning the cell, classically termed stress fibers.\n\nRhoA signaling also promotes the maturation and strengthening of focal adhesions, the large integrin-based adhesion complexes at the ends of stress fibers. Increased contractility and integrin clustering stabilize and enlarge focal adhesions, producing strong adhesion sites.\n\nAt the whole-cell level, sustained RhoA activity enhances contractility, often antagonizes Rac1-driven lamellipodial protrusion, and reduces edge dynamics, leading cells to become more rounded or contracted with prominent stress fibers terminating in robust focal adhesions. This phenotype contrasts with the thin, spike-like filopodia driven by Cdc42 and with the broad lamellipodia driven by Rac1.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, the constitutively active RhoA-Q63L most likely causes contraction, rounding, and formation of thick stress fibers with strong adhesion sites, matching option C. Options A and B correspond to Cdc42 and Rac1 activation, respectively; option D is not a consequence of RhoA activation; option E is incorrect because constitutive RhoA activity exerts a dominant effect that is not compensated by other GTPases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2340790"}, {"introduction": "Cell migration is a sophisticated process that requires the coordinated action of multiple molecular machines, all of which consume energy.
