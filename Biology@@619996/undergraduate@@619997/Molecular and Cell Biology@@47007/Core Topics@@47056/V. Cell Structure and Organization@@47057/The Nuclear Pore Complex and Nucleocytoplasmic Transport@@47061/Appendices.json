This practice explores the concept of the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), a molecular 'zip code' that targets proteins for import into the nucleus. By considering a hypothetical fusion protein [@problem_id:2343485], you can appreciate the dominance and modularity of these signals and the remarkable evolutionary conservation of the nuclear import machinery that allows it to recognize signals across different domains of life.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists constructs a new gene encoding a fusion protein. This protein consists of two parts: the full-length enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase, which is native to the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, and a short peptide sequence known as the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), which is a well-characterized signal that targets proteins to the nucleus in human cells. The gene for this fusion protein is then successfully introduced into and expressed by the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.\n\nAssuming the fusion protein folds correctly and the NLS is fully exposed and functional, in which of the following cellular compartments will the majority of these fusion protein molecules be located at steady-state?\n\nA. The cytoplasm\n\nB. The nucleus\n\nC. The mitochondria\n\nD. Secreted out of the cell\n\nE. Evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus", "solution": "The problem asks for the final location of a specially designed fusion protein expressed in a yeast cell. To determine this, we must analyze the signals present on the protein and understand the protein sorting mechanisms within a eukaryotic cell like yeast.\n\nThe fusion protein is composed of two distinct parts:\n1.  **$\\beta$-galactosidase from *E. coli***: This is a bacterial protein. Proteins native to prokaryotes like *E. coli* do not possess the intrinsic sorting signals required for trafficking to specific organelles within a eukaryotic cell. Therefore, if expressed alone in yeast, $\\beta$-galactosidase would remain in the cytosol, the site of its synthesis on free ribosomes.\n2.  **SV40 large T-antigen Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS)**: This is a specific amino acid sequence, Pro-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val, that acts as a \"zip code\" or targeting signal. In its native context (human cells infected with SV40 virus), this signal directs the T-antigen protein into the nucleus.\n\nThe central principle governing protein fate is that sorting signals on a protein are recognized by cellular machinery that directs the protein to its correct destination. In this case, the dominant signal is the NLS. The process of nuclear import involves the following key steps:\n- A cytosolic receptor protein, called an importin, recognizes and binds to the NLS on the cargo protein (our fusion protein).\n- The importin-cargo complex is then guided to the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), the channel that regulates passage into and out of the nucleus.\n- The complex is actively transported through the NPC into the nucleoplasm, a process that requires energy in the form of GTP hydrolysis, mediated by the Ran protein cycle.\n\nA crucial aspect of this problem is the cross-species functionality of the NLS. The fundamental cellular processes, including the machinery for nuclear import (importins, NPCs, the Ran cycle), are highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. This means that the components of the nuclear import pathway in yeast are structurally and functionally very similar to those in humans.\n\nConsequently, the yeast cell's importin proteins will recognize the human-derived SV40 NLS attached to the bacterial $\\beta$-galactosidase. The yeast machinery will treat the entire fusion protein as a cargo destined for the nucleus. The bacterial enzyme part is passively carried along.\n\nTherefore, despite being synthesized in the cytoplasm, the fusion protein will be actively and continuously transported into the nucleus. This leads to its accumulation within the nucleus at steady state.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- A. **The cytoplasm**: Incorrect. While the protein is synthesized here, the NLS will cause its active transport out of the cytoplasm and into the nucleus.\n- C. **The mitochondria**: Incorrect. Transport into mitochondria requires a specific mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is a different type of signal peptide not present on this fusion protein.\n- D. **Secreted out of the cell**: Incorrect. Secretion requires an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum, the first step of the secretory pathway. This signal is absent.\n- E. **Evenly distributed**: Incorrect. Nuclear import is an active transport process that concentrates proteins against a concentration gradient, not a passive diffusion process. This will lead to a much higher concentration in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm.\n\nBased on the conserved nature of the nuclear import machinery, the fusion protein will be actively imported and will accumulate in the nucleus of the yeast cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2343485"}, {"introduction": "Having established that an NLS directs a protein to the nucleus, we now explore the mechanism of this recognition. Nuclear import relies on specific molecular interactions between the NLS on a cargo protein and soluble receptors called importins.

By predicting the outcome, you can solidify your mental model of how transport cargo competes for limited cellular machinery.", "problem": "An in vitro nuclear import assay is conducted using HeLa cells that have been treated with digitonin. This treatment selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane, releasing the soluble cytoplasmic contents, but leaves the nuclear envelope and its embedded Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) fully intact.

The rate of nuclear import of the cargo protein will increase, as the free NLS peptides prime the transport machinery.\n\nB. The nuclear import of the cargo protein will be significantly inhibited, because the free NLS peptides compete for binding to importin receptors.\n\nC. The nuclear import of the cargo protein will be unaffected, because the free NLS peptides are too small to interfere with the transport of the large cargo protein.\n\nD. The nuclear import of the cargo protein will be blocked, because the high concentration of free NLS peptides will physically obstruct the channel of the Nuclear Pore Complex.\n\nE. The nuclear import of the cargo protein will be inhibited, because the free NLS peptides bind to Ran-GTP and disrupt the directional gradient required for transport.", "solution": "The assay uses digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, which releases soluble cytoplasmic components while leaving the nuclear envelope and Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) intact. Functional nuclear import is restored by supplying an ATP-regenerating system and the soluble transport machinery, including importins and the Ran system. A classical NLS-cargo enters the nucleus via the importin pathway: importin $\\alpha$ binds the basic classical NLS on the cargo; importin $\\beta$ binds importin $\\alpha$ and mediates translocation through NPCs. Directionality is provided by the Ran-GTP gradient (RanGEF in the nucleus, RanGAP in the cytosol), which promotes cargo release in the nucleus and recycling of receptors.\n\nIntroduce species for binding competition at the NLS-receptor site:\n- Let $I$ denote the relevant NLS-binding receptor site (primarily on importin $\\alpha$ within the importin $\\alpha/\\beta$ pathway).\n- Let $C$ denote the fluorescent NLS-cargo.\n- Let $P$ denote the free, unconjugated NLS peptide.\n- Binding equilibria: $I + C \\rightleftharpoons IC$ with dissociation constant $K_{d,C}$, and $I + P \\rightleftharpoons IP$ with dissociation constant $K_{d,P}$.\n\nAssuming rapid equilibrium and conservation of receptor sites, the fraction of receptor occupied by cargo is\n$$\nf_{C}=\\frac{\\frac{[C]}{K_{d,C}}}{1+\\frac{[C]}{K_{d,C}}+\\frac{[P]}{K_{d,P}}}.\n$$\nThis follows from standard competitive binding where the receptor can be free, bound to cargo, or bound to peptide. As $[P]$ increases, the term $\\frac{[P]}{K_{d,P}}$ increases and $f_{C}$ decreases, reducing the concentration of $IC$ complexes available for NPC translocation.\n\nBecause the rate of nuclear import for the cargo in this setup is approximately proportional to the concentration of the import-competent complex $IC$, an increase in free NLS peptide concentration competitively inhibits cargo binding to importin $\\alpha$, thereby reducing both the rate and extent of nuclear accumulation of the cargo compared to control.\n\nThis effect is not due to physical occlusion of the NPC (small peptides do not plug the NPC; option D is incorrect), nor do free NLS peptides bind Ran-GTP (they bind importin $\\alpha$; option E is incorrect). Free NLS peptides do not “prime” the machinery; they sequester receptor binding sites (option A is incorrect). The import is therefore not unaffected (option C is incorrect).

This elegant system uses a steep gradient of Ran-GTP across the nuclear envelope to control the binding and release of cargo.

This cell line possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2). At a permissive temperature of 32°C, the NTF2 protein functions normally. However, when the cells are shifted to a non-permissive temperature of 39°C, the mutant NTF2 protein rapidly denatures and becomes completely non-functional.\n\nFor this system, you are given the following established facts about the Ran cycle, which governs the transport of many molecules across the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC):\n1.  Ran is a small protein that acts as a molecular switch, existing in two forms: Ran-GDP (bound to Guanosine diphosphate) and Ran-GTP (bound to Guanosine triphosphate).\n2.  A steep concentration gradient is maintained across the nuclear envelope, with a high concentration of Ran-GTP inside the nucleus and a high concentration of Ran-GDP in the cytoplasm.\n3.  This gradient is maintained by two spatially segregated enzymes:\n    - **RCC1 (Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1)** is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor exclusively located in the nucleus, where it catalyzes the conversion of Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP.\n    - **RanGAP1 (Ran GTPase Activating Protein 1)** is exclusively located in the cytoplasm, where it promotes the hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP.\n4.  The primary mechanism for importing Ran into the nucleus is via the transport receptor NTF2, which specifically binds to Ran-GDP in the cytoplasm and facilitates its transport through the NPC. The export of Ran from the nucleus is an independent process, typically occurring when Ran-GTP binds to an exportin receptor.\n\nThe biologist cultures the cells at the permissive temperature of 32°C, allowing them to reach a stable state. The entire culture is then shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 39°C and maintained for several hours, sufficient time to establish a new steady state.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the change in the total concentration of Ran protein (i.e., the sum of Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP concentrations) inside the nucleus at the new steady state (39°C) compared to the initial steady state (32°C)?\n\nA. The total nuclear Ran concentration will increase significantly.\n\nB. The total nuclear Ran concentration will decrease significantly.\n\nC. The total nuclear Ran concentration will remain essentially unchanged.\n\nD. The total nuclear Ran concentration will oscillate, but its time-averaged value will be unchanged.\n\nE. The concentration of nuclear Ran-GTP will decrease, but the concentration of nuclear Ran-GDP will increase by a corresponding amount, leaving the total nuclear Ran concentration unchanged.", "solution": "Let $G_{n}$ and $D_{n}$ denote the nuclear concentrations of Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP, respectively, and let $R_{n} = G_{n} + D_{n}$ be the total nuclear Ran.

RCC1 cannot restore $R_{n}$ because it only interconverts $D_{n}$ and $G_{n}$ without changing their sum. Therefore, the new steady state necessarily has a substantially reduced $R_{n}$.\n\nThis rules out options A, C, D, and E. In particular, E is inconsistent because nuclear Ran-GDP does not increase in the absence of nuclear RanGAP1; rather, RCC1 favors $D_{n} \\to G_{n}$, and with no import, both $D_{n}$ and $G_{n}$ decrease as export removes Ran from the nucleus until export halts.\n\nHence, the total nuclear Ran concentration decreases significantly at 39°C relative to 32°C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2343504"}]}
