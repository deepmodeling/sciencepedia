The kinesin motor moves with a constant average velocity, $v$, of 800.0 nm/s. This movement occurs in discrete steps, with each step covering a distance, $d_{step}$, of 8.0 nm. For each step it takes, the kinesin motor consumes exactly one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).

Every forward step is driven by the hydrolysis of a single molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nHowever, the transport process is not perfectly efficient due to the presence of dynein motors that can transiently cause backward (retrograde) movement.

This problem is a thought experiment based on the classic in-vitro motility assay, a cornerstone technique for studying motor proteins [@problem_id:2325985]. Instead of the motor walking on a stationary track, you'll analyze the inverse scenario where the motor is fixed and the track is free to move, reinforcing your understanding of motor directionality through the lens of relative motion.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, an in-vitro motility assay is prepared to study the properties of the motor protein kinesin-1. Purified kinesin-1 motor proteins are nonspecifically and irreversibly affixed to the surface of a glass slide, such that their \"tail\" domains are bound to the glass and their \"head\" domains, which bind to microtubules, are free. Subsequently, fluorescently labeled, stabilized microtubules are introduced into the system along with a solution containing an ample supply of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nIt is known that microtubules are polar polymers, possessing a fast-growing \"plus-end\" and a slow-growing \"minus-end\". Kinesin-1 is a plus-end-directed motor, meaning that when it moves along a microtubule track, it hydrolyzes ATP to directionally \"walk\" towards the plus-end. In the described experimental setup, the microtubules are observed to glide smoothly across the surface of the glass slide.\n\nBased on this information, which end of a gliding microtubule will be observed as its leading end (i.e., the end at the front, pointing in the direction of motion)?\n\nA. The plus-end.\n\nB. The minus-end.\n\nC. Neither end leads; the microtubule moves sideways, perpendicular to its long axis.\n\nD. The leading end is random, as the microtubule tumbles end-over-end.\n\nE. The microtubule will not move because the kinesin-1 motors are fixed to the slide.", "solution": "Define the polarity unit vector of a microtubule as $\\hat{p}$, pointing from the minus-end toward the plus-end. By definition, kinesin-1 is plus-end-directed, so when a kinesin head is bound to the microtubule it steps toward the plus-end along $\\hat{p}$.\n\nLet $v_{km}$ denote the velocity of the kinesin head relative to the microtubule, $v_{ks}$ the velocity of the kinesin head relative to the substrate (glass), and $v_{ms}$ the velocity of the microtubule relative to the substrate. The kinematic relation for relative motion is\n$$\nv_{km} = v_{ks} - v_{ms}.\n$$\nIn the gliding assay, kinesin tails are irreversibly affixed to the glass, so the kinesin head is effectively immobilized with respect to the substrate, giving\n$$\nv_{ks} = 0.\n$$\nBecause kinesin-1 walks toward the plus-end, the head’s velocity relative to the microtubule is\n$$\nv_{km} = v\\,\\hat{p}, \\quad v>0.\n$$\nSubstituting into the relative motion relation yields\n$$\nv_{ms} = -v_{km} = -v\\,\\hat{p}.\n$$\nTherefore, the microtubule translates opposite to $\\hat{p}$, meaning it moves with its minus-end leading and its plus-end trailing.\n\nThis direction is also consistent with Newton’s third law: as the immobilized motor attempts to step toward the plus-end (exerting a forward tangential force on the filament), an equal and opposite force is applied to the microtubule, propelling it toward its minus-end. Because many motors engage along the filament and constrain motion to the plane, the microtubule glides along its long axis rather than moving sideways or tumbling, and it indeed moves (ample ATP is present), ruling out options C, D, and E. Hence the leading end is the minus-end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325985"}]}
