This specific pathway relies on a particular Rab GTPase, which we will call RabS (for Secretion). The normal function of RabS involves cycling between an inactive, Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP)-bound state and an active, Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. In its active GTP-bound form, RabS on the vesicle surface binds to tethering proteins on the inner face of the plasma membrane, facilitating vesicle docking and subsequent fusion.\n\nThe researchers engineer a cell line to express a mutant form of RabS. This mutant, RabS-mut, has a single amino acid substitution that completely abolishes its ability to hydrolyze GTP, even in the presence of its specific GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP). However, the mutation does not affect its ability to exchange GDP for GTP or to bind to its downstream effector proteins (tethering factors) when in the GTP-bound state.\n\nAssuming this mutant RabS-mut is expressed at levels comparable to the native RabS protein, what is the most direct and immediate consequence on the TGN-to-plasma membrane secretion pathway?\n\nA. Secretory vesicles will be unable to form and bud from the TGN.\n\nB. Secretory vesicles will form but will accumulate in the cytosol because they cannot bind to the motor proteins required for transport to the plasma membrane.\n\nC. Secretory vesicles will be transported to the plasma membrane but will be unable to dock, resulting in a buildup of undocked vesicles near the cell periphery.\n\nD. Secretory vesicles will successfully dock and fuse with the plasma membrane, but the RabS-mut protein and its associated tethering machinery will become irreversibly locked at the fusion site, preventing their reuse in subsequent transport cycles.\n\nE. The RabS-mut protein will be unable to bind to the membrane of newly formed secretory vesicles and will remain soluble and inactive in the cytosol.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary consequence of introducing a mutant Rab GTPase (RabS-mut) that cannot hydrolyze its bound GTP. To solve this, we must understand the key steps of the Rab GTPase cycle and the role of GTP hydrolysis in this process.\n\n1.  **The Rab GTPase Cycle Overview:** Rab proteins act as molecular switches in vesicle trafficking. They cycle between an inactive, GDP-bound form, which is typically soluble in the cytosol (often complexed with a GDP-dissociation inhibitor, or GDI), and an active, GTP-bound form, which is associated with a membrane (either a vesicle or a target organelle).\n\n2.  **Activation and Function:** A Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) on the donor membrane (here, the TGN) catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Rab protein. This activation (Rab-GDP -> Rab-GTP) induces a conformational change that exposes a lipid anchor, causing the Rab protein to insert into the membrane of the budding vesicle. The active Rab-GTP on the vesicle surface then acts as a recognition marker. When the vesicle reaches its destination (the plasma membrane), the Rab-GTP binds to specific effector proteins, most notably tethering factors on the target membrane. This tethering event brings the vesicle close to the target, allowing for the interaction of v-SNAREs (on the vesicle) and t-SNAREs (on the target membrane), which ultimately drives membrane fusion.\n\n3.  **Inactivation and Recycling (The Crucial Step):** After vesicle fusion is complete, the Rab protein must be inactivated and recycled to be used for another round of transport. This inactivation is achieved through the hydrolysis of its bound GTP back to GDP (Rab-GTP -> Rab-GDP). This hydrolysis step is intrinsically slow for Rab proteins and is greatly accelerated by a GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP), which is typically located on the target membrane. The resulting inactive Rab-GDP protein changes conformation, loses its affinity for the membrane and its effectors, and is extracted from the membrane by a GDI, returning it to the cytosolic pool for reuse.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Mutant (RabS-mut):** The problem states that RabS-mut can be activated (exchange GDP for GTP) and can bind its effectors (tethering proteins) but cannot hydrolyze GTP. Let's trace its path:\n    *   RabS-mut will be activated to the GTP-bound state at the TGN and correctly incorporated into the membrane of a new secretory vesicle.\n    *   The vesicle, now studded with active RabS-mut-GTP, will be transported to the plasma membrane.\n    *   At the plasma membrane, the active RabS-mut-GTP will successfully bind to its tethering factors, leading to docking.\n    *   Docking will lead to SNARE-mediated fusion, and the vesicle will deliver its contents to the exterior of the cell.\n\n5.  **The Post-Fusion Consequence:** The critical failure occurs *after* fusion. Normally, the GAP at the plasma membrane would trigger GTP hydrolysis to inactivate RabS. However, RabS-mut is immune to this. It remains in its active, GTP-bound state, firmly attached to the plasma membrane and likely still bound to its tethering effector. It cannot be inactivated and cannot be extracted by GDI for recycling.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A: \"Secretory vesicles will be unable to form and bud from the TGN.\" This is incorrect. Rab activation and recruitment occur as part of, or just after, budding. The mutation doesn't prevent this initial step.\n    *   B: \"Secretory vesicles will form but will accumulate in the cytosol because they cannot bind to the motor proteins...\" This is incorrect. The primary role of Rab proteins is in tethering/docking, not directly binding motor proteins (though they can recruit proteins that do). The mutation creates a \"permanently on\" signal, which would not inhibit transport.\n    *   C: \"Secretory vesicles will be transported to the plasma membrane but will be unable to dock...\" This is the opposite of what would happen. The GTP-bound form is *required* for docking. Since the mutant is locked in this form, it will be very efficient at docking.\n    *   D: \"Secretory vesicles will successfully dock and fuse with the plasma membrane, but the RabS-mut protein and its associated tethering machinery will become irreversibly locked at the fusion site, preventing their reuse in subsequent transport cycles.\" This is the correct conclusion. The initial transport events will work, but the system cannot be reset. The essential RabS protein and its machinery will be sequestered at the plasma membrane, depleting the available pool and eventually halting the entire pathway.\n    *   E: \"The RabS-mut protein will be unable to bind to the membrane of newly formed secretory vesicles...\" This is incorrect. Binding to the membrane is a consequence of being in the active, GTP-bound state, which the mutant protein can achieve and maintain.\n\nTherefore, the most direct consequence is the successful fusion event followed by the failure of the system to reset, leading to the accumulation of the active Rab protein on the target membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2334849"}, {"introduction": "Just as a stuck 'on' switch causes problems, a switch that cannot be turned 'on' is equally disruptive.

This phenomenon is known as a dominant negative effect.\n\nThe function of Rab proteins is controlled by two key regulatory proteins: Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), which activate Rab proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP, and GTPase-Activating Proteins (GAPs), which inactivate Rab proteins by stimulating GTP hydrolysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for the dominant negative inhibition caused by Rab-Z(mut)?\n\nA.

The activity of a Rab protein is governed by its nucleotide-bound state, acting as a molecular switch. This cycle is controlled by three main types of regulatory proteins:\n1.  Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), which activate Rab proteins by catalyzing the exchange of Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) for Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP).\n2.  GTPase-Activating Proteins (GAPs), which inactivate Rab proteins by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.\n3.  GDP-Dissociation Inhibitors (GDIs), which extract inactive Rab-GDP from membranes, keeping them soluble in the cytosol and recycling them for future rounds of transport.\n\nA cell biologist creates a stable cell line that is genetically engineered to massively overexpress a single specific protein, Rab5, which is normally involved in early endosome trafficking. Experimental analysis confirms a dramatic increase in the total amount of Rab5 protein in the cell, with the majority of the excess protein accumulating in the cytosol in its inactive, GDP-bound form. A surprising secondary observation is that other, unrelated trafficking pathways, such as the secretion of hormones (mediated by Rab3) and the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (mediated by Rab6), are severely inhibited.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and mechanistically sound explanation for this widespread, non-specific inhibition of vesicle trafficking?\n\nA. The large cytosolic pool of overexpressed Rab5-GDP acts as a molecular sink, sequestering the limited supply of GDI proteins. This prevents GDIs from extracting other Rab proteins from their target membranes after use, thus halting their recycling and stalling their respective pathways.\n\nB. The excess Rab5-GDP competitively inhibits all GEFs in the cell, preventing them from activating any Rab proteins, which universally blocks the initiation of vesicle transport.\n\nC. The overexpressed Rab5 overwhelms the cell's protein synthesis machinery, depleting the pool of available ribosomes and amino acids, which in turn prevents the synthesis of other essential trafficking proteins like other Rabs and their effectors.\n\nD. The massive amount of activated Rab5-GTP on endosomal membranes saturates the available GAPs. With GAPs occupied, other Rab proteins throughout the cell remain perpetually in their active GTP-bound state, causing them to be stuck at target membranes and unable to participate in new rounds of transport.\n\nE. The high concentration of cytosolic Rab5-GDP causes it to non-specifically bind to the effector proteins of other Rab pathways, physically blocking the correct Rab proteins from binding and executing their function.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely mechanism by which the overexpression of a single Rab protein (Rab5) non-specifically inhibits other, unrelated vesicle trafficking pathways. To solve this, we must analyze the entire Rab GTPase cycle and determine which component, when limited, would have a global impact on all Rab-mediated pathways.\n\nFirst, let's review the normal Rab cycle for any generic Rab protein, say RabY, involved in a specific pathway:\n1.  **Inactive State:** RabY exists in the cytosol, bound to a GDP-Dissociation Inhibitor (GDI). The GDI keeps RabY in its inactive, GDP-bound state (RabY-GDP) and prevents it from associating with membranes.\n2.  **Activation:** At a donor membrane (e.g., a budding vesicle), a GDI Displacement Factor (GDF) facilitates the release of RabY from GDI. RabY-GDP then loosely associates with the membrane. A specific Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) then catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP, converting RabY-GDP into its active form, RabY-GTP.\n3.  **Function:** Active RabY-GTP, now firmly anchored to the vesicle membrane, recruits specific effector proteins. These effectors can be tethering factors that mediate docking with the correct target membrane or motor proteins that move the vesicle along the cytoskeleton.\n4.  **Inactivation:** Upon successful vesicle docking and/or fusion with the target membrane, a specific GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of RabY, causing it to hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This converts RabY-GTP back to its inactive RabY-GDP form.\n5.  **Recycling:** The inactive RabY-GDP, now on the target membrane, is recognized and bound by a GDI molecule from the cytosol. The GDI extracts RabY-GDP from the membrane, forming a soluble RabY-GDP-GDI complex. This complex returns RabY to the soluble cytosolic pool, ready for another round of transport. This recycling step is essential to maintain a supply of usable Rab proteins.\n\nNow, let's analyze the experimental condition: a massive overexpression of Rab5, leading to a large cytosolic pool of Rab5-GDP. We will evaluate each option based on this condition.\n\n**Option A: GDI Sequestration.** GDI proteins are not specific to a single Rab; they bind to the GDP-bound form of many different Rab proteins. The total amount of GDI in a cell is finite. If there is a massive excess of Rab5-GDP in the cytosol, these molecules will bind to and sequester a significant fraction, if not all, of the available GDI pool. As a result, when other Rab proteins (like Rab3 or Rab6) complete their function at their respective target membranes and are inactivated to Rab3-GDP or Rab6-GDP, there are no free GDI molecules available to extract them from the membrane. These Rab proteins become stuck on the target membranes, and the cytosolic pool of recyclable Rab3 and Rab6 is depleted. Without a supply of soluble Rabs to be loaded onto new vesicles, these pathways grind to a halt. This mechanism explains a *non-specific*, *global* inhibition of trafficking because GDI is a shared resource essential for the recycling step of *all* Rab pathways. This aligns perfectly with the observations.\n\n**Option B: GEF Inhibition.** This is unlikely to be the correct general mechanism. GEFs typically exhibit a high degree of specificity for their target Rab proteins or subfamilies. An excess of Rab5-GDP would likely compete for and potentially titrate its own specific GEF(s), but it would not act as a general competitive inhibitor for the structurally diverse GEFs that activate other Rabs like Rab3 and Rab6. Therefore, this cannot explain the widespread inhibition of unrelated pathways.\n\n**Option C: Depletion of Synthesis Machinery.** While extreme overexpression of any protein can place a metabolic burden on a cell, this is a very general and indirect effect. The problem describes a severe and specific inhibition of vesicle trafficking. A direct disruption of the trafficking machinery itself is a much more potent and likely explanation than a general slowdown of all cellular protein synthesis. This is a possible secondary effect, but not the primary mechanistic cause.\n\n**Option D: GAP Saturation.** This option posits that an excess of *active* Rab5-GTP saturates GAPs. However, the problem states that the majority of the *excess* protein is in the inactive Rab5-GDP form in the cytosol. Even if some excess Rab5 becomes activated, GAP saturation would cause Rabs to be stuck in the \"on\" state (GTP-bound). This would lead to a different phenotype (e.g., exaggerated tethering) rather than the observed general inhibition. Furthermore, like GEFs, GAPs also show specificity, so saturating Rab5-related GAPs would not necessarily affect other pathways' GAPs.\n\n**Option E: Effector Obstruction.** This suggests that Rab5-GDP non-specifically binds to effectors for other Rabs. Rab-effector interactions are typically highly specific and depend on the Rab being in its active GTP-bound conformation. The inactive GDP-bound form has a different conformation and does not bind effectors. Therefore, it is mechanistically improbable that an excess of inactive Rab5-GDP would physically block the effectors of other, active Rabs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sequestration of the common recycling factor, GDI, by the vast excess of inactive Rab5-GDP provides the most direct and accurate explanation for the observed non-specific inhibition of multiple vesicle trafficking pathways.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2334833"}]}
