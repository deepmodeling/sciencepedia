This practice simulates a classic pulse-chase experiment, a powerful technique in cell biology that allows us to track a cohort of proteins as it travels through the secretory pathway. By predicting the location of a fluorescently-tagged protein at a specific time point after its release from the endoplasmic reticulum, you will develop an intuition for the kinetics and directionality of protein transport. [@problem_id:2339256]", "problem": "A cell biology research group is investigating the dynamics of protein transport through the secretory pathway. They have engineered a cell line to express a special fusion protein: a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein (ts-VSV-G) tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n\nThis ts-VSV-G protein has a specific property:\n- At a high, \"restrictive\" temperature of 40°C, the protein misfolds and is retained by the quality control machinery within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\n- At a lower, \"permissive\" temperature of 32°C, the protein folds correctly, allowing it to exit the ER and proceed through the secretory pathway.\n\nThe experiment is conducted as follows:\n1. The cells are incubated at the restrictive temperature (40°C) for several hours to cause a large accumulation of the ts-VSV-G-GFP protein throughout the ER network.\n2. At time $t=0$, the cell culture medium is replaced with fresh medium containing cycloheximide (a drug that halts all new protein synthesis), and the temperature is simultaneously shifted to the permissive temperature (32°C). This initiates a synchronized \"pulse\" of pre-existing, fluorescently-tagged protein transport.\n\nBased on the established model of anterograde (forward) protein transport, which of the following describes the most likely predominant subcellular localization of the GFP signal at a short time point after the shift, specifically at $t = 7$ minutes?\n\nA. Evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nB. Concentrated at the trans-face of the Golgi apparatus and in secretory vesicles budding from it.\n\nC. Remaining entirely within the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nD. Primarily localized to the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nE. Accumulated on the exterior of the plasma membrane.", "solution": "We apply the established sequence of anterograde transport in the secretory pathway: properly folded secretory membrane proteins exit the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in COPII-coated carriers at ER exit sites, then traverse the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to reach the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus, subsequently progressing through medial and trans cisternae to the trans-Golgi network and finally to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane.\n\nGiven the properties of the engineered protein and the experimental design:\n1. At the restrictive temperature, the ts-VSV-G-GFP misfolds and is retained within the ER by quality control, causing accumulation throughout the ER.\n2. At $t=0$, the shift to the permissive temperature allows the accumulated pool to fold correctly. Cycloheximide simultaneously halts new protein synthesis, ensuring that only the pre-existing pool proceeds; this does not prevent trafficking of the existing pool.\n3. After permissive folding, export from the ER begins rapidly as COPII vesicles bud from ER exit sites. This early stage occurs within minutes and leads to delivery to the ERGIC and then the cis-Golgi.\n4. Progression to the trans-face of the Golgi and formation of secretory vesicles budding from it occurs later, typically on the order of tens of minutes after ER exit. Arrival at the plasma membrane occurs still later.\n5. Therefore, at an early time point such as $t=7$ minutes, the predominant localization is expected to be at early Golgi entry compartments: ERGIC and the cis-face of the Golgi. It would not yet be concentrated at the trans-face or the plasma membrane, and it would not remain entirely in the ER because exit initiates promptly upon folding. It would also not be evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm because trafficking is along defined membrane-bound compartments.\n\nAmong the provided options, the description that best matches the expected predominant localization at $t=7$ minutes is the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2339256"}, {"introduction": "The secretory pathway is not simply a one-way conveyor belt; it involves sophisticated quality control and retrieval mechanisms. This problem focuses on the crucial process of retrograde transport, where proteins that have \"escaped\" the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are captured in the Golgi and returned. You will explore the function of the KDEL signal, a molecular \"return-to-sender\" tag, and predict the consequences when the machinery that recognizes this tag fails, providing a deeper understanding of how cellular compartments maintain their unique identities. [@problem_id:2339280]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, a class of proteins known as Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) resident proteins, such as the chaperone BiP, are essential for proper protein folding within the ER lumen. These proteins are retained in the ER through a retrieval mechanism. Should they accidentally be transported to the Golgi apparatus via anterograde transport, they are recognized and returned. This recognition is mediated by a specific C-terminal amino acid sequence, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, commonly referred to as the KDEL signal. A transmembrane protein called the KDEL receptor, located primarily in the cis-Golgi network and intermediate compartment, binds to this KDEL signal. This binding event initiates retrograde transport, packaging the ER resident protein into COPI-coated vesicles for its return journey to the ER.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic condition in which a patient's cells produce a non-functional version of the KDEL receptor. This mutated receptor is correctly synthesized and localized to the cis-Golgi, but it has completely lost its ability to bind to the KDEL signal.\n\nWhat is the most likely ultimate fate of a soluble ER resident protein that possesses a KDEL signal in a cell from this patient?\n\nA. It will be permanently trapped within the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nB. It will accumulate to high concentrations in the cis-Golgi network.\n\nC. It will be transported through the Golgi apparatus and secreted out of the cell.\n\nD. It will be exported to the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nE. It will be diverted from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosome for degradation.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the normal trafficking principle for soluble ER-resident proteins: they possess a C-terminal KDEL sequence, which serves as a retrieval signal. These proteins can escape the ER via bulk flow/anterograde transport to the cis-Golgi. In the cis-Golgi and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, the KDEL receptor recognizes and binds the KDEL sequence. This binding recruits COPI coat proteins, initiating retrograde vesicular transport that returns the KDEL-bearing proteins to the ER lumen. Thus, steady-state ER residency is maintained by continuous retrieval rather than absolute retention.\n\nIn the hypothetical condition, the KDEL receptor is correctly localized to the cis-Golgi but cannot bind the KDEL signal. The key mechanistic consequence is that escaped soluble ER-resident proteins will no longer be captured in the cis-Golgi for retrograde COPI-mediated return to the ER. Without receptor-mediated retrieval, these soluble proteins will follow default secretory pathway flow.\n\nWe evaluate each option against this mechanism:\n- A: “Permanently trapped in the ER” is incorrect because ER-resident soluble proteins escape the ER by bulk flow; without retrieval, they will not be retained.\n- B: “Accumulate in the cis-Golgi” is unlikely; accumulation requires binding to a receptor or retention mechanism. With a nonfunctional KDEL receptor, they will not be retained in cis-Golgi and will continue forward through the Golgi stacks.\n- C: “Transported through the Golgi and secreted out of the cell” matches the expected default fate in the absence of retrieval; soluble lumenal proteins will traverse cis-, medial-, trans-Golgi and be packaged into secretory vesicles for exocytosis.\n- D: “Exported to cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome” would require retrotranslocation and ER-associated degradation signaling; the mutation affects the Golgi KDEL receptor, not ERAD machinery, and soluble lumenal proteins without receptor capture are not transported into the cytosol.\n- E: “Diverted to the lysosome” would require specific sorting signals (e.g., mannose 6-phosphate) added in the Golgi; ER-resident proteins with only KDEL are not targeted to lysosomes by default.\n\nTherefore, the most likely ultimate fate is secretion out of the cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2339280"}, {"introduction": "A primary role of the trans-Golgi network is to sort proteins to their final destinations, a task akin to a cellular post office. This exercise delves into one of the most well-understood sorting pathways: the targeting of hydrolytic enzymes to the lysosome. By examining a hypothetical defect in the creation of the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tag—the specific \"zip code\" for lysosomal enzymes—you will reason through the cellular consequences of mis-sorting and discover the importance of the default secretory pathway. [@problem_id:2339292]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the sorting of proteins to their correct destinations is a highly regulated process. The journey for newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and continues through the Golgi apparatus. In the cis-Golgi network, a specific molecular tag is added to these enzymes to ensure they are ultimately delivered to the lysosome. This tag is a Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) group. The creation of this tag is a two-step enzymatic process.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line derived from a patient with a rare genetic disorder. In this cell line, the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the first of the two steps required to generate the M6P tag, is completely non-functional due to a mutation.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this enzymatic defect on the cell's lysosomes?\n\nA. The hydrolytic enzymes will fail to be recognized in the trans-Golgi network, causing them to be packaged into secretory vesicles and released into the extracellular space, leaving lysosomes devoid of their essential enzymes.\n\nB.

The untagged hydrolytic enzymes will be recognized as misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum and will be retro-translocated into the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome.\n\nD. The lysosomes will form and function normally for digesting internal cellular components (autophagy), but they will be unable to fuse with endosomes to degrade materials brought in from outside the cell.\n\nE. The untagged hydrolytic enzymes will be randomly and incorrectly incorporated into other organelles, such as mitochondria and peroxisomes, disrupting their functions.", "solution": "Newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases enter the endoplasmic reticulum, acquire N-linked oligosaccharides, and move to the cis-Golgi network. The specific tag that directs them to lysosomes is mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), generated by a two-step process: first, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase transfers N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues on the hydrolase’s N-linked oligosaccharide (forming a phosphodiester); second, an uncovering enzyme removes the N-acetylglucosamine to expose the M6P. In the trans-Golgi network, M6P receptors bind the M6P-tagged enzymes, packaging them into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and ultimately lysosomes.\n\nIf N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is non-functional, the first step fails and no M6P is generated. Without M6P, hydrolases cannot bind M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network. In the absence of specific retention or sorting signals, these correctly folded hydrolases follow the default constitutive secretory pathway and are packaged into secretory vesicles and released extracellularly. Consequently, lysosomes are deprived of their essential acid hydrolases, leading to a functional deficiency of lysosomal degradation—classically seen in I-cell (mucolipidosis II) disease.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is correct: lack of M6P prevents recognition in the trans-Golgi network; enzymes are secreted, leaving lysosomes without hydrolases.\nB is incorrect: the enzymes do not accumulate in the Golgi; they are secreted by default.\nC is incorrect: the proteins are properly folded; the defect is in tagging, not folding, so ER-associated degradation is not triggered.\nD is incorrect: the primary defect is loss of hydrolases, not a fusion defect; both autophagy and endocytosed cargo degradation are impaired because enzymes are missing.\nE is incorrect: organelle targeting is signal-dependent; without appropriate targeting sequences for mitochondria or peroxisomes, the default fate is secretion, not random misincorporation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339292"}]}
