However, their assembly is not a simple process of one subunit type polymerizing on its own. This exercise challenges you to explore the strict rules of co-assembly by considering a hypothetical genetic knockout scenario, providing insight into why neurofilaments are considered \"obligate heteropolymers.\" [@problem_id:2346947]", "problem": "In vertebrate neurons, the axonal cytoskeleton is primarily composed of neurofilaments, a type of intermediate filament that plays a crucial role in providing structural support and defining axonal caliber. These neurofilaments are obligate heteropolymers assembled from three different subunit proteins: the neurofilament light chain (NF-L), the neurofilament medium chain (NF-M), and the neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H). The widely accepted model of assembly proposes that NF-L forms the central core of the 10 nm filament, while NF-M and NF-H co-assemble with NF-L and project their long C-terminal domains as \"side-arms\" that regulate inter-filament spacing.\n\nA research team has developed a transgenic mouse line in which the gene encoding the NF-L protein has been specifically knocked out. The genes for NF-M and NF-H remain intact and are expressed at normal levels. Based on the established role of NF-L as the core structural component, what is the most probable outcome for the neurofilament network within the axons of these genetically modified neurons?\n\nA. The axons will contain a normal density of neurofilaments, as NF-M and NF-H will self-assemble into functional filaments to compensate for the absence of NF-L.\n\nB. The axons will exhibit an increased density of neurofilaments because the smaller NF-M and NF-H filaments can pack more tightly without the NF-L core.\n\nC. The number of neurofilaments within the axons will be drastically reduced because NF-M and NF-H subunits fail to assemble into filaments and are largely retained within the neuronal cell body.\n\nD. The axons will contain neurofilaments that are packed much closer together than normal, as they will be composed only of NF-M and NF-H, which lack the bulky NF-L subunit.\n\nE. The neurofilament network will be completely replaced by an expanded network of microtubules, maintaining the axon's structural integrity and caliber without any significant pathology.", "solution": "Goal: Determine the most probable outcome for the axonal neurofilament network when NF-L, the core subunit of neurofilaments, is knocked out while NF-M and NF-H are expressed normally.\n\nStep 1: State the established assembly principle.\nNeurofilaments in vertebrate neurons are intermediate filaments formed as obligate heteropolymers. The canonical assembly model requires NF-L to form the central core of the 10 nm filament. NF-M and NF-H co-assemble with NF-L and contribute long C-terminal side-arms that regulate inter-filament spacing. Critically, NF-M and NF-H do not efficiently self-assemble into filaments in the absence of NF-L in vivo.\n\nStep 2: Apply the assembly pathway constraint.\nIntermediate filament assembly proceeds via coiled-coil dimer formation, antiparallel tetramers, unit-length filaments, and radial compaction to 10 nm filaments. In the neurofilament system, NF-L provides the essential scaffold for co-assembly; NF-M and NF-H require NF-L to form stable dimers/tetramers capable of further assembly. Without NF-L, the assembly pathway is aborted because NF-M and NF-H alone do not form stable, transport-competent filaments in neurons.\n\nStep 3: Apply axonal transport principles.\nNeurofilament subunits are conveyed to axons primarily as assembled polymers or competent precursors via slow axonal transport. Unassembled subunits, especially NF-M and NF-H lacking NF-L, are inefficiently transported and tend to be retained within the neuronal soma, where they may be degraded or form nonproductive aggregates. Therefore, axons in NF-L knockout neurons become largely devoid of neurofilaments.\n\nStep 4: Predict the axonal phenotype and exclude alternatives.\n- Option A is invalid because NF-M and NF-H do not self-assemble into functional neurofilaments in vivo without NF-L.\n- Option B is invalid because there is not an increase in filament density; instead, there is a profound loss of neurofilaments due to failed assembly and transport.\n- Option D is invalid for the same reason; axons will not contain filaments composed only of NF-M and NF-H.\n- Option E is invalid because microtubules do not fully replace neurofilament function in maintaining axonal caliber; typical findings include reduced axonal caliber and conduction abnormalities, not a normal structural phenotype.\n\nConclusion: The most probable outcome is a drastic reduction of neurofilaments in axons because NF-M and NF-H fail to assemble without NF-L and are retained in the neuronal cell body.

For these proteins to function, they must be accurately targeted to the inner nuclear membrane. This practice problem delves into the molecular \"zip code\"—a lipid modification called farnesylation—that guides B-type lamins to their destination, asking you to predict the functional consequences for nuclear re-assembly after mitosis when this signal is absent. [@problem_id:2346922]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina is a dense fibrillar network on the inner surface of the nuclear envelope, composed of intermediate filaments called lamins. Lamins are critical for maintaining nuclear structure and organizing chromatin. B-type lamins, such as Lamin B1 and B2, are distinguished by a particular post-translational modification. They possess a C-terminal amino acid sequence motif known as a \"CaaX box\" (where 'C' is cysteine, 'a' is an aliphatic amino acid, and 'X' can be one of several residues). This motif directs the enzymatic attachment of a 15-carbon lipid group called a farnesyl group to the cysteine residue. This lipid modification, or farnesylation, is essential for mediating the protein's interaction with membranes.\n\nConsider a cell biology experiment where a human cell line is genetically engineered to express a mutant form of Lamin B1. In this mutant protein, the four amino acids that constitute the C-terminal CaaX box have been deleted. The expression level of this non-farnesylated mutant Lamin B1 is similar to that of the wild-type protein in control cells. These engineered cells are synchronized and observed as they progress through mitosis and enter the subsequent G1 phase.\n\nBased on the known roles of B-type lamins and protein lipidation, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the cellular localization of the mutant Lamin B1 protein and the principal consequence for nuclear reassembly after anaphase?\n\nA. The mutant Lamin B1 will remain soluble in the cytoplasm and fail to associate with chromatin-bound vesicles, leading to a severe impairment or failure of nuclear envelope reassembly.\n\nB. The mutant Lamin B1 will be recognized as improperly modified and will be rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to a phenotypically normal cell due to compensation by other lamins.\n\nC. The mutant Lamin B1 will successfully incorporate into the reforming nuclear lamina but will be unable to polymerize correctly, resulting in an abnormally fragile nuclear envelope that is prone to rupture.\n\nD. The mutant Lamin B1 will mislocalize and permanently associate with the general endoplasmic reticulum membrane, sequestering binding partners and thus indirectly inhibiting nuclear reformation.\n\nE. The farnesyl group is only required for interphase targeting, so the mutant Lamin B1 will localize correctly to the reforming nuclear envelope, but the resulting nucleus will be unable to expand to its normal size.", "solution": "Principle 1: B-type lamins (e.g., Lamin B1) contain a C-terminal CaaX motif that is farnesylated by protein farnesyltransferase. The attached farnesyl group is a hydrophobic anchor that mediates stable association of Lamin B with membranes, including inner nuclear membrane and nuclear envelope precursor membranes.\n\nPrinciple 2: In contrast to Lamin A, which ultimately loses its farnesyl group during maturation, B-type lamins remain permanently farnesylated. This lipidation is required for their membrane targeting and for recruiting/anchoring nuclear envelope membranes to chromatin during mitotic exit and early G1.\n\nManipulation: Deleting the four residues of the CaaX box eliminates the acceptor cysteine and thus prevents farnesylation. The mutant Lamin B1 therefore lacks the hydrophobic anchor necessary for membrane association.\n\nPrediction for localization: Without farnesylation, Lamin B1 is unable to stably associate with endoplasmic reticulum–derived and nuclear envelope precursor membranes or with chromatin-bound vesicles during anaphase/telophase. It will remain soluble in the cytoplasm rather than being targeted to the reforming nuclear envelope.\n\nConsequence for nuclear reassembly: B-type lamins are critical for nuclear envelope reassembly at mitotic exit by facilitating membrane recruitment and lamina formation around decondensing chromosomes. Failure of membrane association by Lamin B1 severely impairs this process, leading to defective or failed nuclear envelope reformation. Alternatives are inconsistent: rapid degradation conflicts with the stated similar expression level; polymerization defects are not the primary consequence of lost farnesylation; mislocalization to ER requires farnesylation rather than its absence; the requirement for farnesylation is not limited to interphase but is crucial at mitotic exit.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the mutant remains soluble and causes severe impairment in nuclear envelope reassembly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346922"}, {"introduction": "In epithelial tissues, keratin filaments provide mechanical strength by anchoring to robust cell-cell junctions known as desmosomes. This final exercise moves from conceptual models to experimental data analysis, a core skill in molecular biology. You will step into the role of a researcher and quantitatively analyze data from a co-immunoprecipitation experiment to measure how the connection between keratins and their desmosomal anchors is regulated. [@problem_id:2346925]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the molecular architecture of desmosomes, which are cell-cell junctions that anchor keratin intermediate filaments to the plasma membrane in epithelial cells. The desmosomal plaque protein, desmoplakin (DP), is known to be a primary linker to the keratin cytoskeleton. The biologist suspects that a novel protein, named Keratin-Tethering Regulator (KTR), modulates the strength of the interaction between desmoplakin and its associated keratins.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, a Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment is performed on cultured human keratinocytes. An antibody against desmoplakin is used to precipitate DP and any associated proteins from cell lysates. The experiment is conducted in parallel on two populations of cells: (1) wild-type (WT) cells, and (2) cells in which the KTR gene has been silenced (knockdown, or KD). As a negative control, a mock Co-IP is performed on WT cell lysate using a non-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to measure the level of non-specific binding to the antibody and beads.\n\nThe resulting protein complexes are analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. The signal intensity for a given protein is directly proportional to its abundance in the immunoprecipitated sample.
