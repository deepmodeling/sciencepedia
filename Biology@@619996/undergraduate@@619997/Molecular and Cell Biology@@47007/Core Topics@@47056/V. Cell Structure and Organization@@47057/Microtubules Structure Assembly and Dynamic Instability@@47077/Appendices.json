The experimental setup consists of a buffered solution containing an ample supply of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), which is required for tubulin polymerization. Into this solution, a number of short, pre-formed microtubule fragments are introduced to act as nuclei, or \"seeds,\" for further growth. Finally, a concentration of free, GTP-bound tubulin dimers is added and maintained at a constant value just below the critical concentration ($C_c$). The critical concentration is the specific concentration of free tubulin dimers at which the rate of subunit addition to a microtubule end is exactly balanced by the rate of subunit loss.\n\nAssuming the system is allowed to evolve for a sufficient amount of time, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome for the microtubule seeds?\n\nA. The total mass of polymerized microtubules in the solution will increase as the seeds elongate.\n\nB. The microtubule seeds will undergo net depolymerization, leading to a decrease in the total mass of polymerized microtubules.\n\nC. The microtubule seeds will remain stable at their initial lengths, with no net change in the total mass of polymerized microtubules.\n\nD.

For a single microtubule end, the standard kinetic description is:\n- Subunit addition rate per end: $r_{\\text{add}} = k_{\\text{on}}[T]$.\n- Subunit loss rate per end: $r_{\\text{loss}} = k_{\\text{off}}$.\nBy definition, the critical concentration satisfies the balance condition\n$$\nC_{c} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}.\n$$\nThe net subunit flux per end is\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = r_{\\text{add}} - r_{\\text{loss}} = k_{\\text{on}}[T] - k_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{on}}\\left([T] - C_{c}\\right).\n$$\nIf $[T] < C_{c}$, then $[T] - C_{c} < 0$, so\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} < 0.\n$$\nLet $a$ be the length increment per added subunit.

Therefore, over time the seeds undergo net depolymerization and the total mass of polymerized microtubules decreases. This excludes growth (A), stability at initial lengths (C), or constancy of total mass under dynamic instability (D). It also rules out spontaneous increase of $[T]$ to $C_{c}$ (E), since $[T]$ is externally maintained.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2323714"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of critical concentration, we now explore a key feature of microtubules: their structural polarity.

This allows for the direct visualization of the microtubule cytoskeleton using fluorescence microscopy. To quantify the turnover rate, the biologist performs a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment. In this experiment, a high-intensity laser is used to irreversibly bleach the GFP-tubulin in a small, defined region of the cell, and the subsequent recovery of fluorescence in that region is monitored over time. This recovery is due to the replacement of bleached tubulin subunits with unbleached, fluorescent subunits from the surrounding cytoplasm.\n\nThe biologist performs this experiment on two distinct populations of cells:\n1.  Interphase cells, where they target a region of the astral microtubule array in the cytoplasm.\n2.  Mitotic cells, where they target a region of the kinetochore microtubules within the metaphase spindle.\n\nFrom the analysis of the fluorescence recovery curves, the biologist determines the half-time of recovery ($t_{1/2}$), which is the time it takes for the fluorescence intensity to recover to half of its final plateau value.
