{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise explores a fundamental consequence of the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Mitochondria contain their own protein synthesis machinery, including 70S ribosomes, which are distinct from the 80S ribosomes found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. This scenario [@problem_id:2324216] challenges you to predict the cellular-level impact of a hypothetical drug that selectively targets these prokaryote-like ribosomes, providing a direct link between a unique molecular feature of mitochondria and their central role in cellular energy production.", "problem": "A novel antibiotic, named Prokaryo-static, is being tested on a culture of human liver cells. Extensive in vitro testing has confirmed that Prokaryo-static is a highly specific inhibitor of protein synthesis on 70S ribosomes, but has no effect on the function of 80S ribosomes. If these human liver cells are treated with a high concentration of Prokaryo-static, which of the following cellular processes would be most immediately and directly impaired?\n\nA. The synthesis of glycolytic enzymes in the cytoplasm.\n\nB. The replication of nuclear DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle.\n\nC. The generation of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nD. The synthesis of secreted proteins, such as albumin.\n\nE. All protein synthesis within the cell.", "solution": "The key biological principle is that ribosomes differ between domains and organelles: eukaryotic cytosolic and rough endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes are 80S, whereas mitochondria contain 70S ribosomes of bacterial origin. An inhibitor specific to 70S ribosomes will therefore selectively block mitochondrial protein synthesis without directly affecting cytosolic or rough ER protein synthesis.\n\n- Option A involves cytosolic synthesis of glycolytic enzymes on 80S ribosomes; this is not directly affected.\n- Option D involves synthesis of secreted proteins (e.g., albumin) on rough ER 80S ribosomes; this is not directly affected.\n- Option E claims all protein synthesis would be inhibited, which is incorrect because 80S ribosomes are unaffected.\n- Option B (nuclear DNA replication) relies on nuclear DNA polymerases and is not directly dependent on mitochondrial ribosomes; any effect would be indirect and delayed, via energy depletion.\n- Option C (oxidative phosphorylation) relies on mitochondrial electron transport chain components, several of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA and synthesized on mitochondrial 70S ribosomes. Inhibiting 70S ribosomes directly impairs mitochondrial protein synthesis, compromising the maintenance and turnover of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, thus most immediately and directly impacting ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct impairment is oxidative phosphorylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2324216"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of mitochondrial function, we now turn to how these organelles are constructed. The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and subsequently imported. This practice problem [@problem_id:2324210] uses an elegant thought experiment involving protein engineering to probe the physical rules of this import process, specifically focusing on why a protein's shape is a critical factor for passage through the mitochondrial gates.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. They are studying a precursor protein, let's call it Protein X, which is naturally synthesized in the cytosol and destined for the matrix. In a series of experiments, they use genetic engineering to create a mutant version of Protein X. This mutant contains two cysteine residues strategically placed so that, upon folding in the oxidative environment of an in-vitro buffer, they form a single, stable intramolecular disulfide bond. This bond locks a significant portion of the protein into a compact tertiary structure.\n\nWhen this pre-folded, disulfide-bonded mutant of Protein X is incubated with isolated, functional mitochondria, the researchers observe that it successfully binds to receptors on the mitochondrial surface but fails to be translocated into the matrix. The canonical import machinery, including the Translocase of the Outer Membrane (TOM) complex and the Translocase of the Inner Membrane (TIM) complex, is fully functional in these mitochondria.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for this observed import failure?\n\nA. The disulfide bond masks the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, preventing its recognition by the import receptors of the TOM complex.\n\nB. The energy derived from ATP hydrolysis by cytosolic chaperones is insufficient to unfold a protein stabilized by a covalent disulfide bond.\n\nC. The formation of the disulfide bond disrupts the positive charges on the targeting sequence, thereby negating the pulling force exerted by the negative-inside membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nD. The compact, folded structure maintained by the disulfide bond is physically too large to be threaded through the narrow translocation channel of the TOM complex.\n\nE. The disulfide bond is cleaved by enzymes in the intermembrane space, leading to protein aggregation that clogs the TIM complex.", "solution": "The essential principles for mitochondrial matrix protein import are as follows: matrix-destined precursor proteins carry an N-terminal, positively charged, amphipathic presequence that is recognized by receptors of the Translocase of the Outer Membrane (TOM) complex. Productive import requires the precursor to be in an essentially unfolded conformation so that it can be threaded as a linear polypeptide through the narrow protein-conducting channels of TOM and the Translocase of the Inner Membrane (TIM23). Cytosolic chaperones prevent premature folding to maintain import competency, and matrix chaperones plus the inner membrane potential contribute to vectorial translocation once the polypeptide enters the channel. Critically, the translocons do not accommodate compact, stably folded domains; passage requires unfolding.\n\nGiven the experimental setup, the mutant precursor contains a covalent intramolecular disulfide bond that locks a substantial portion of the protein in a compact tertiary structure prior to encountering the mitochondria. The observed phenotype is that the mutant binds to the mitochondrial surface receptors but fails to translocate into the matrix, despite functional TOM and TIM machinery. Binding to receptors indicates that the N-terminal targeting sequence remains accessible and properly recognized, so failure occurs at or after the step requiring threading through the translocon.\n\nEvaluate the options in light of these principles:\n\n1. Option A posits that the disulfide bond masks the N-terminal targeting sequence, preventing recognition. This is contradicted by the observation that the protein successfully binds to the mitochondrial surface receptors, a process that depends on targeting sequence recognition. Therefore, Option A is not the primary explanation.\n\n2. Option B asserts that ATP hydrolysis by cytosolic chaperones is insufficient to unfold a covalently disulfide-stabilized protein. While it is true that cytosolic chaperones typically prevent folding rather than forcibly break covalent bonds, the primary block here is not about energetic sufficiency of cytosolic ATP per se, but the requirement that the substrate be in an unfolded state to traverse the pore. A covalent disulfide prevents unfolding and hence prevents threading; the core reason is the topological constraint of the channel, not an ATP budget failure. Thus, Option B misattributes the primary cause.\n\n3. Option C claims that the disulfide bond disrupts positive charges on the targeting sequence and negates the membrane potential-driven pulling. Disulfide formation involves cysteine residues and does not neutralize the lysine or arginine residues that confer positive charge to the targeting presequence. Hence, Option C is incorrect mechanistically.\n\n4. Option D states that the compact, folded structure maintained by the disulfide bond is too large to be threaded through the narrow TOM channel. This directly matches the established requirement that proteins must be unfolded to pass through TOM and TIM23. A stable disulfide-locked fold cannot be linearized without reduction, so it cannot be threaded, providing the most accurate and primary explanation for the observed failure.\n\n5. Option E suggests disulfide cleavage in the intermembrane space leading to aggregation that clogs TIM. The intermembrane space is generally an oxidizing environment and contains machinery that forms, not reduces, disulfide bonds for IMS proteins. There is no evidence presented of cleavage or aggregation, and the phenotype is failure to translocate rather than clogging by aggregates. Therefore, Option E is not supported.\n\nFrom these deductions, the primary and most accurate explanation for the import failure is that a disulfide-stabilized, compact structure cannot be threaded through the translocation pore, which requires an unfolded polypeptide chain. This corresponds to Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2324210"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we transition from theoretical principles to the practical world of experimental cell biology. To understand how proteins function, we must first know where they reside within the cell's intricate geography. This problem [@problem_id:2324208] places you in the role of a researcher tasked with interpreting real-world experimental data from a subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis, challenging you to deduce the precise location and processing of a key mitochondrial protein, OPA1, based on the evidence provided.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the subcellular localization of the protein OPA1, a dynamin-related GTPase critical for mitochondrial inner membrane fusion. They perform a differential centrifugation and purification protocol on a sample of cultured human hepatocytes to isolate four distinct subcellular fractions:\n1.  **C**: Cytosol\n2.  **M**: Crude mitochondria (includes all mitochondrial sub-compartments)\n3.  **MX**: Purified mitochondrial matrix\n4.  **IMS**: Purified mitochondrial intermembrane space\n\nThe protein content of each fraction is separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by Western blotting using a specific antibody that recognizes the OPA1 protein. The results are described as follows:\n\n-   In the **C** (Cytosol) fraction, no protein band is detected.\n-   In the **M** (Crude mitochondria) fraction, two distinct bands are clearly visible. A prominent band is seen at a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa, and another strong band is seen at approximately 90 kDa.\n-   In the **MX** (Purified matrix) fraction, a very faint band is detected at approximately 100 kDa. No band is visible at 90 kDa.\n-   In the **IMS** (Purified intermembrane space) fraction, a single, strong band is detected at approximately 90 kDa. No band is visible at 100 kDa.\n\nBased on this experimental evidence, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete interpretation regarding the localization and nature of OPA1?\n\nA. OPA1 is a single protein that is actively transported between the mitochondrial matrix and the intermembrane space, resulting in its detection in both purified compartments.\n\nB. OPA1 is a soluble protein that exclusively resides in the mitochondrial matrix, and its appearance in the IMS fraction is due to leakage during the purification procedure.\n\nC. OPA1 exists in two primary forms: a larger, membrane-associated form and a smaller, soluble form. The larger form is an integral protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the smaller form is located in the intermembrane space.\n\nD. OPA1 exists in two primary forms: a larger, 100 kDa form that is a soluble matrix protein, and a smaller, 90 kDa form that is a soluble intermembrane space protein.\n\nE. OPA1 exists in two primary forms: a larger, 100 kDa form associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, and a smaller, 90 kDa soluble form in the intermembrane space resulting from proteolytic cleavage of the larger form. The faint band in the matrix is a minor contamination artifact.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most accurate interpretation of Western blot data from a subcellular fractionation experiment targeting the protein OPA1. We must analyze the results from each fraction to build a comprehensive model of OPA1's localization and processing.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the known function and context of OPA1.**\nOPA1 is a dynamin-related GTPase known to be essential for the fusion of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This biological role strongly suggests its association with the IMM. It is also known to be processed by mitochondrial proteases.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Western blot results for each fraction.**\n\n*   **Fraction C (Cytosol):** The absence of any band in the cytosolic fraction indicates that, under these conditions, OPA1 is not a cytosolic protein. This rules out interpretations where OPA1 has a primary function in the cytosol or is only transiently in the mitochondria.\n\n*   **Fraction M (Crude mitochondria):** The detection of two distinct bands at ~100 kDa and ~90 kDa in the total mitochondrial fraction is a key finding. It demonstrates that mitochondria contain two different species of OPA1, likely differing by post-translational modification or proteolytic processing. The larger band is often referred to as a \"long form\" (L-OPA1) and the smaller band as a \"short form\" (S-OPA1).\n\n*   **Fraction IMS (Purified intermembrane space):** A single, strong band is observed at ~90 kDa. This result strongly localizes the smaller form of OPA1 to the intermembrane space. The fact that it can be purified in a soluble fraction suggests this S-OPA1 form is not membrane-anchored.\n\n*   **Fraction MX (Purified matrix):** A very faint band is detected at ~100 kDa. This is the larger form, L-OPA1. Its presence in the matrix fraction is faint, which contrasts with the strong signals in the crude mitochondrial and IMS fractions. Given that the matrix is topologically separate from the IMS and the outer membrane, a protein whose primary role is on the IMM would not be expected to be a primary resident of the matrix. The most plausible explanation for a faint signal in a highly purified fraction is minor cross-contamination. In this case, the purification of the matrix likely included small, contaminating fragments of the IMM where the L-OPA1 is located.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the findings into a coherent model.**\n\n1.  OPA1 is exclusively mitochondrial (no cytosolic signal).\n2.  There are two forms of OPA1: a large ~100 kDa form and a small ~90 kDa form.\n3.  The small ~90 kDa form (S-OPA1) is a soluble protein located in the intermembrane space.\n4.  The large ~100 kDa form (L-OPA1) is associated with mitochondria but is not soluble in the IMS. Its faint presence in the matrix fraction is best explained as a contamination artifact from the IMM, to which it is tethered or integrated. This aligns with OPA1's known role in IMM fusion. The L-OPA1 is anchored in the IMM, with domains extending into the IMS.\n5.  The existence of both a large, membrane-associated form and a smaller, soluble form suggests a processing event, such as proteolytic cleavage, where the L-OPA1 is cut to release the soluble S-OPA1 into the IMS.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given multiple-choice options.**\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. This option fails to account for the two different molecular weights observed, implying a single protein form.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. This mislocalizes the protein to the matrix and contradicts the strong, specific signal for the 90 kDa form in the IMS fraction.\n*   **C:** Partially correct but ultimately flawed. It correctly identifies two forms, one membrane-associated and one soluble in the IMS. However, it incorrectly locates the larger form on the *outer* mitochondrial membrane. OPA1's function is on the *inner* membrane.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. This option correctly identifies the locations of the two forms but mistakenly describes the larger 100 kDa form as a soluble matrix protein. The data shows only a faint band in the matrix, and its membrane-associated nature is the most consistent interpretation.\n*   **E:** Correct. This option provides the most complete and accurate synthesis of the data. It correctly identifies two forms, correctly assigns the larger form (~100 kDa) to the IMM and the smaller soluble form (~90 kDa) to the IMS, posits a correct mechanism (proteolytic cleavage), and correctly interprets the faint signal in the matrix fraction as a common experimental artifact (contamination). This model is fully consistent with all the experimental observations and the known biology of OPA1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2324208"}]}
