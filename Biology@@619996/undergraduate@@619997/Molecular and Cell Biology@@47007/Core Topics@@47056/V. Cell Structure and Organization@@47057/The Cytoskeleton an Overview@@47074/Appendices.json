{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to cell shape and motility, with filaments constantly assembling and disassembling in a process known as treadmilling. This exercise explores how this process is controlled by regulatory proteins that bind to filament ends. By considering the immediate impact of a plus-end capping protein, you can sharpen your understanding of actin filament polarity and how modifying one end of the polymer affects the dynamics of the entire structure [@problem_id:2341294].", "problem": "In a cellular system, actin filaments are dynamic polymers essential for processes like cell motility and structural support. These filaments exhibit polarity, characterized by a fast-growing \"plus\" end where actin monomers are preferentially added, and a slow-growing (or depolymerizing) \"minus\" end. Under certain cellular conditions, an actin filament can reach a steady state known as treadmilling, where the rate of monomer addition at the plus end is balanced by the rate of monomer removal from the minus end, resulting in a filament of nearly constant length that effectively moves through the cytoplasm.\n\nImagine a single, isolated actin filament is actively treadmilling. A researcher introduces a specific type of regulatory protein, a \"capping protein,\" which has a high affinity for and binds exclusively to the plus end of the actin filament. Assume the binding event is essentially instantaneous and irreversible for the timescale of this question.\n\nWhat is the most immediate and direct consequence for this individual filament's dynamics right after the capping protein successfully binds to its plus end?\n\nA. The filament will rapidly depolymerize from both the plus and minus ends.\n\nB. The filament will begin to shorten as subunits are lost from its minus end.\n\nC. The filament will become completely stable, and its length will no longer change.\n\nD. The filament will start to grow rapidly from its minus end, effectively reversing its overall polarity of growth.\n\nE. The filament will be severed into multiple, smaller fragments.", "solution": "Treadmilling is the steady state where subunits add at the plus end at the same rate that subunits dissociate from the minus end, so filament length is constant. Denote the addition rate at the plus end as $r_{+}$ and the loss rate at the minus end as $r_{-}$. In treadmilling,\n$$\nr_{+}=r_{-}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dN}{dt}=r_{+}-r_{-}=0,\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of subunits in the filament.\n\nA plus-end capping protein that binds instantaneously and irreversibly occludes the plus end, preventing both association and dissociation at that end. Therefore, immediately after capping,\n$$\nr_{+}\\to 0 \\quad \\text{(no further addition or loss at the plus end)}.\n$$\nThe minus end remains uncapped and continues to depolymerize at its intrinsic rate $r_{-}>0$. Hence the net change in filament length (or subunit number) becomes\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=r_{+}-r_{-}=0-r_{-}=-r_{-}<0,\n$$\nso the filament shortens due to continued subunit loss from the minus end.\n\nThis rules out the alternatives: not A, because the plus end cannot depolymerize once capped; not C, because the minus end remains dynamic; not D, because capping does not reverse polarity or convert the minus end into a fast-growing end; and not E, because capping does not sever filaments. The most immediate and direct consequence is net shortening from the minus end.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2341294"}, {"introduction": "Microtubules are characterized by a unique behavior called \"dynamic instability\"—a state of rapid switching between growth and catastrophic shrinkage. This essential property is fueled by the hydrolysis of GTP bound to β-tubulin subunits after they are incorporated into the polymer. This problem presents a thought experiment where this critical hydrolytic \"switch\" is disabled, challenging you to predict the profound consequences for microtubule stability and its crucial role during cell division [@problem_id:2341312].", "problem": "In a cellular biology research laboratory, a new cell line has been genetically engineered. This cell line possesses a specific point mutation in the gene encoding for $\\beta$-tubulin. The consequence of this mutation is that while the $\\beta$-tubulin protein can still bind to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) and polymerize with $\\alpha$-tubulin to form microtubules, it has lost the ability to hydrolyze the bound GTP to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP). Assuming the cell has a sufficient supply of free αβ-tubulin dimers, what would be the most significant and direct consequence for the microtubule cytoskeleton in these cells?\n\nA. Microtubules will become exceptionally stable, resisting depolymerization. This will most critically disrupt the cell cycle by preventing the proper formation and function of the mitotic spindle, leading to an arrest in mitosis.\n\nB. The rate of microtubule polymerization will decrease dramatically because αβ-tubulin dimers can no longer be added to the microtubule ends.\n\nC. Microtubule severing proteins will become hyperactive to compensate for the change, leading to an abundance of short, fragmented microtubules throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nD. The affinity of motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, for microtubules will be completely lost, halting all microtubule-based intracellular transport but leaving cell structure largely unaffected.\n\nE. The formation of αβ-tubulin dimers will be inhibited, preventing the assembly of any new microtubules and leading to a gradual disappearance of the entire microtubule network.", "solution": "Define $T$ as the GTP-bound $\\alpha\\beta$-tubulin dimer and $D$ as the GDP-bound state after hydrolysis. In normal cells:\n- Polymerization at a microtubule end occurs with net velocity $v_{+}=k_{\\text{on}}[T]-k_{\\text{off}}$, where $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ are association and dissociation rate constants and $[T]$ is the free dimer concentration.\n- After incorporation into the lattice, $T$ hydrolyzes GTP with rate constant $k_{h}$, converting to $D$ in the lattice.\n- The microtubule is stabilized by a GTP cap of length $L_{c}$ composed of $T$-state subunits. When hydrolysis outpaces addition such that $L_{c}\\to 0$, the lattice is predominantly $D$ and becomes unstable, greatly increasing the probability of catastrophe. Thus dynamic instability arises from the interplay of $k_{\\text{on}}[T]$, $k_{\\text{off}}$, and $k_{h}$.\n\nIn the engineered cells, the mutation abolishes GTP hydrolysis on $\\beta$-tubulin, so set $k_{h}=0$. The immediate consequences are:\n1. Subunits incorporated into the lattice remain in the $T$ state; there is no $T\\to D$ conversion.\n2. The GTP cap does not erode by hydrolysis; effectively, $L_{c}$ does not shrink due to $k_{h}$ and instead persists or grows with continued addition when $[T]$ is sufficient.\n3. The catastrophe probability, which depends critically on the loss of the GTP cap, is driven toward zero in the absence of hydrolysis. Therefore, depolymerization events are strongly suppressed and microtubules become exceptionally stable.\n\nGiven the assumption of a sufficient supply of free $\\alpha\\beta$-tubulin dimers, the polymerization term $k_{\\text{on}}[T]$ is not reduced; if anything, the net persistence of a stabilizing cap would prevent transitions to depolymerization, so there is no mechanistic basis for a dramatic decrease in polymerization rate. The most direct and significant effect is the loss of dynamic instability and resultant hyperstability of microtubules.\n\nCellular consequence: Dynamic instability is essential for mitotic spindle assembly and function, including search-and-capture of kinetochores and error correction. Stabilized microtubules that resist depolymerization fail to remodel appropriately, disrupting spindle formation and dynamics, which most critically leads to mitotic defects and arrest.\n\nElimination of alternatives:\n- B is incorrect because addition of $T$-state dimers to ends does not require hydrolysis; $k_{\\text{on}}[T]$ is unaffected by $k_{h}$, and $k_{h}=0$ does not block addition.\n- C is speculative and not a direct compensatory mechanism; severing proteins do not become intrinsically hyperactive due solely to lattice $T$-state; moreover, the stabilized lattice would not predict an abundance of short fragments as a primary, direct effect.\n- D is incorrect because motor protein binding to microtubules is not abolished by the nucleotide state of the lattice; transport would not be completely halted.\n- E is incorrect because dimer formation and nucleation do not require hydrolysis by lattice-incorporated $\\beta$-tubulin; the mutation does not prevent dimer assembly.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that microtubules become exceptionally stable, disrupting mitotic spindle dynamics and causing mitotic arrest.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341312"}, {"introduction": "Complex cellular functions like cell migration emerge from the coordinated action of numerous cytoskeletal proteins that assemble distinct actin-based structures. This practice places you in the role of a researcher using pharmacological tools to dissect the machinery of cell movement.

The researcher uses a live-cell imaging setup to observe keratinocytes cultured on a fibronectin-coated surface. To probe the roles of specific cytoskeletal components, the cells are treated simultaneously with a combination of two highly specific pharmacological agents:\n1.  **Forminib**: An inhibitor that specifically blocks the actin nucleation activity of all formin proteins.\n2.  **Myoblock-A**: A drug that prevents the assembly of myosin II monomers into functional bipolar filaments, thereby abolishing myosin II-driven contractility.\n\nAssume that the drugs do not affect the Arp2/3 complex, actin polymerization/depolymerization dynamics (other than nucleation by formins), or the function of any other motor proteins. Based on your understanding of the cytoskeleton's role in cell motility, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the resulting cellular architecture and migratory behavior after treatment?\n\nA. The cells will completely lose their ability to form actin-based protrusions, causing them to round up and detach from the substrate.\n\nB. The cells will lose their broad, sheet-like lamellipodia but will extend an abnormally high number of long, thin filopodia, resulting in a spiky but stationary phenotype.\n\nC. The cells will continue to form broad lamellipodial protrusions at the leading edge, but will be unable to retract their trailing edge, leading to a highly flattened, spread-out morphology and arrested migration.\n\nD. The cells will migrate in a manner visually similar to untreated cells but at a significantly faster speed, as the loss of contractile stress fibers reduces internal resistance to movement.\n\nE. The cells will be unable to form any organized actin structures, leading to a rapid collapse of the cytoskeleton and programmed cell death (apoptosis).", "solution": "1. Identify the principal actin assembly pathways and their morphological outputs.\n- The Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin networks that drive broad, sheet-like lamellipodia at the leading edge.\n- Formins nucleate and promote elongation of unbranched, linear actin filaments that are essential for filopodia (long, thin protrusions), stress fibers, and actin bundles associated with focal adhesions.\n\n2. Determine the effect of Forminib (formin nucleation inhibitor).\n- Blocking formin-mediated nucleation eliminates or severely reduces linear actin structures: filopodia and stress fibers decline sharply.\n- Arp2/3-dependent lamellipodia remain intact because Arp2/3 function is explicitly unaffected.\n- Consequence: cells retain lamellipodial protrusive activity but lose filopodia and stress fibers.\n\n3. Determine the effect of Myoblock-A (prevents myosin II filament assembly).\n- Myosin II contractility requires assembly into bipolar filaments; preventing this abolishes contractile forces.\n- Trailing edge retraction and cell body translocation depend on myosin II–mediated contractility; these processes are impaired.\n- Focal adhesion maturation requires tension; without myosin II, adhesions remain small/nascent and stress fibers are absent.\n\n4. Combine the effects.\n- Lamellipodia persist because Arp2/3 is functional and actin polymerization dynamics (aside from formin nucleation) are preserved.\n- Filopodia and stress fibers are lost due to formin inhibition.\n- Trailing edge retraction and effective translocation are blocked due to lack of myosin II contractility, leading to a spread, highly flattened morphology with persistent leading-edge protrusions but failure to move forward (arrested migration).\n\n5. Evaluate the options.\n- A is incorrect: Arp2/3-driven lamellipodia still form; cells do not necessarily round up or detach.\n- B is incorrect: filopodia require formins; their number would decrease, not increase; lamellipodia would not be lost.\n- C is correct: lamellipodia continue while trailing edge retraction fails, yielding a flattened, spread phenotype with migration arrest.\n- D is incorrect: migration speed decreases due to loss of contractility and traction, not increases.\n- E is incorrect: organized actin structures (lamellipodia) still form; there is no immediate collapse or obligatory apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341331"}]}
