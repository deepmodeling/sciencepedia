This first practice exercise asks you to act as a molecular detective to decipher one of these signals. By examining the sequence of a hypothetical protein destined for the Golgi apparatus, you will apply your knowledge of the secretory pathway to identify the specific coat protein complex responsible for packaging it for transport from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a newly discovered transmembrane enzyme, designated \"GlycoMod-alpha,\" which is essential for post-translational modifications that occur within the *cis*-Golgi network. The enzyme is synthesized and correctly folded within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). To function, it must be transported from ER exit sites to the Golgi apparatus. Upon sequencing the protein, the biologists determine that the short polypeptide segment extending into the cytoplasm contains a specific three-amino-acid sequence: Asp-Ala-Glu.\n\nBased on this molecular information, which of the following coat protein complexes is primarily responsible for recognizing this signal and packaging GlycoMod-alpha into vesicles for its transport from the ER to the Golgi?\n\nA.

This problem presents a scenario where a protein fails to reach its destination and instead accumulates in its place of origin. Your task is to diagnose the underlying molecular defect by identifying the specific mutation in its sorting signal that disrupts its journey out of the ER, reinforcing the essential link between protein sequence, transport, and cellular organization.", "problem": "A hypothetical transmembrane protein, named Aquaporin-Z (AQZ), is essential for rapid water transport across the plasma membrane of specialized kidney cells. In its functional, wild-type form, AQZ is synthesized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), transported to the Golgi apparatus, and finally delivered to the plasma membrane. Researchers have identified a cell line with a genetic disorder where a single point mutation in the *AQZ* gene causes the mature protein to be almost entirely absent from the plasma membrane and instead accumulate within the ER.\n\nThe exit of transmembrane cargo proteins from the ER is an active process, typically relying on sorting signals within their cytoplasm-facing domains that are recognized by coat proteins, such as those of the Coat Protein Complex II (COPII). The wild-type amino acid sequence of the short cytoplasmic tail of AQZ is known to be:\n\n`...-Phe-Ala-Asp-Thr-Glu-Tyr-Trp-COOH`\n\nAssuming the mutation affects protein sorting but not its folding or stability, which of the following single amino acid substitutions in the AQZ cytoplasmic tail is the most probable cause for its retention in the ER?\n\nA.

Introduction of a di-lysine (Lys-Lys) motif at the C-terminus (`-Trp-Lys-Lys-COOH`).", "solution": "We are told that the wild-type AQZ reaches the plasma membrane via the canonical secretory pathway and that, in the mutant, the protein accumulates in the ER without folding or stability defects. ER export of many transmembrane cargo proteins depends on cytosolic sorting signals recognized by COPII, classically the di-acidic motif of the form D/E-x-D/E (where x is any residue), which is bound by Sec24.\n\nIdentify the ER export motif in the wild-type tail:\n- The given cytoplasmic tail sequence is ...-Phe-Ala-Asp-Thr-Glu-Tyr-Trp-COOH.\n- This contains the motif Asp-Thr-Glu, which matches D-x-E (here D-T-E), a canonical di-acidic COPII export signal.\n\nPredict the effect of each proposed single substitution on COPII-dependent ER export:\n- A. Asp to Ala: This removes one of the acidic residues, converting D-x-E into A-x-E, which disrupts the di-acidic COPII export signal and is expected to block COPII recognition, preventing ER exit and causing ER accumulation.\n- B. Phe to Tyr: This is a conservative aromatic substitution outside the di-acidic motif and does not disrupt D-x-E; it is unlikely to impair ER export.\n- C. Thr to Ser: The middle position in D/E-x-D/E can be any residue; substituting Thr with Ser retains a valid D-x-E motif and should not abolish COPII export.\n- D. Asp to Glu: Although it changes the identity of the first acidic residue, it preserves a di-acidic motif (E-x-E), and COPII can recognize D/E-x-D/E; thus this is unlikely to prevent export.\n- E. Introduction of a C-terminal di-lysine motif (-Trp-Lys-Lys-COOH): A di-lysine motif at the extreme C-terminus is a COPI retrieval/ER retention signal (KKXX or KXKXX) that would indeed cause ER localization by retrieval from the Golgi. However, this option is not a single amino acid substitution as stipulated; introducing a di-lysine motif requires adding or altering more than one residue relative to the provided tail, and thus does not match the problemâ€™s constraint of a single substitution.\n\nTherefore, the substitution most consistent with loss of the COPII di-acidic export signal and consequent ER retention, while adhering to the single-substitution constraint, is Asp to Ala (option A).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2347361"}, {"introduction": "A transport vesicle's journey does not end upon reaching its target; it must precisely dock and fuse to deliver its cargo. This final stage is a sophisticated, multi-step process. This practice problem focuses on dissecting the critical final moments of a vesicle's arrival at the Golgi apparatus, specifically distinguishing between the initial \"capture\" step (tethering) and the final membrane merger (fusion). By analyzing a scenario where fusion is selectively blocked by a toxin, you will gain a deeper understanding of the distinct roles played by Rab GTPases and SNARE proteins in ensuring cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time.", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating the secretory pathway in a cultured mammalian cell line. They introduce a novel bacterial toxin that has a highly specific proteolytic activity: it selectively cleaves and inactivates all target-Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor (t-SNARE) proteins located on the cytoplasmic face of the cis-Golgi network membrane. All other cellular components, including the machinery for vesicle formation, Rab Guanosine Triphosphatases (GTPases) and their corresponding effector proteins, and vesicle-SNAREs (v-SNAREs) on transport vesicles, remain fully functional.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, what is the most probable immediate outcome for a Coat Protein Complex II (COPII)-coated vesicle that has just budded from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and is destined for the Golgi apparatus?\n\nA. The vesicle will fail to be targeted to the Golgi apparatus and will instead drift aimlessly in the cytoplasm until it is degraded.\n\nB. The vesicle will successfully uncoat and fuse with the cis-Golgi membrane, but its cargo will be immediately and incorrectly packaged into COPI vesicles for retrograde transport back to the ER.\n\nC. The vesicle will be captured and physically tethered to the cis-Golgi membrane but will be unable to undergo membrane fusion, leading to an accumulation of unfused vesicles at the target site.\n\nD. The vesicle will be unable to shed its COPII coat, which physically prevents any interaction with the cis-Golgi membrane.\n\nE. The vesicle will bypass the defective cis-Golgi and fuse with the next available compartment, the medial-Golgi.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fate of a COPII vesicle in a cell where the t-SNAREs on the cis-Golgi are non-functional. To solve this, we must dissect the sequential steps of vesicular transport from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to the Golgi.\n\n1.  **Vesicle Budding and Transport:** COPII vesicles are responsible for anterograde transport, moving cargo from the ER to the cis-Golgi network. The problem states that the machinery for vesicle formation is intact, so COPII vesicles will form correctly at the ER exit sites, enclosing their cargo, and travel towards the Golgi.\n\n2.  **Tethering:** The first step in vesicle-target recognition is tethering. This process involves the specific recognition between a Rab-GTPase protein on the surface of the transport vesicle and a corresponding tethering protein complex (a Rab effector) on the target membrane. The problem explicitly states that Rab GTPases and their effectors are fully functional. Therefore, the COPII vesicle, which carries the appropriate Rab protein for the cis-Golgi, will be successfully recognized and captured by the cis-Golgi membrane. This initial, often long-range, \"capture\" is what constitutes tethering. This immediately rules out option A, as the vesicle will be successfully targeted. It also rules out option E, as targeting is specific; the vesicle is programmed to interact with the cis-Golgi, not other compartments.\n\n3.  **Docking and Fusion:** Following tethering, the vesicle must dock and fuse with the target membrane to deliver its contents. This is a short-range interaction mediated by the pairing of v-SNAREs on the vesicle membrane with t-SNAREs on the target membrane. The formation of a stable, four-helix bundle called the trans-SNARE complex pulls the two lipid bilayers into close proximity, overcoming the energy barrier for membrane fusion.\n\n4.  **Applying the Experimental Condition:** The core of the problem lies here. The bacterial toxin has specifically cleaved and inactivated the t-SNAREs on the cis-Golgi. Even though the vesicle has been successfully tethered (Step 2) and has functional v-SNAREs on its surface, there are no functional t-SNARE partners on the target membrane. Consequently, the trans-SNARE complex cannot form. Without the formation of this complex, the final steps of docking and membrane fusion are blocked.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Outcomes:**\n    *   **Option A:** Incorrect. Tethering via Rab proteins is functional, so the vesicle is correctly targeted.\n    *   **Option B:** Incorrect. The primary defect prevents membrane fusion. If fusion cannot occur, cargo cannot be delivered to the Golgi lumen to be subsequently sorted.\n    *   **Option C:** Correct. This option accurately describes the situation. Tethering occurs (the vesicle is \"captured\"), but the subsequent step of fusion is blocked due to the inactive t-SNAREs. This would lead to a microscopic observation of vesicles accumulating at, and physically associated with, the cis-Golgi membrane, but without having merged with it.\n    *   **Option D:** Incorrect. The shedding of the COPII coat (uncoating) is a process that typically occurs just before or concurrently with tethering. It is regulated by factors like the hydrolysis of GTP by Sar1 (a small GTPase involved in COPII coat assembly) and is not dependent on the status of SNARE proteins. The vesicle would uncoat, but still be unable to fuse.\n    *   **Option E:** Incorrect. Vesicle targeting is highly specific. The Rab-effector interaction directs the vesicle to the cis-Golgi. There is no mechanism for it to \"decide\" to bypass its target and move to the medial-Golgi.\n\nTherefore, the vesicle completes the tethering step but is arrested just before fusion, leading to its accumulation at the cis-Golgi.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2347339"}]}
