This exercise [@problem_id:2320124] explores the primary biophysical principle that drives this process: the hydrophobic effect originating from the heptad repeat pattern, $(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)_n$. By considering a hypothetical mutation that alters the hydrophobic character of the core `a` and `d` positions in vimentin, you will deduce how specific amino acid properties govern the self-assembly of these critical cytoskeletal components.", "problem": "Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein crucial for maintaining cell shape and integrity. The fundamental building block of a vimentin filament is a monomer that consists of a central alpha-helical \"rod\" domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The rod domain is characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid sequence pattern known as a heptad repeat, which can be denoted as $(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)_n$. In wild-type vimentin, the residues at the `a` and `d` positions of the heptad are predominantly large and hydrophobic, while the residues at the other positions are often polar or charged. The first step in filament assembly is the formation of a parallel, coiled-coil dimer from two vimentin monomers.\n\nA research team uses genetic engineering to create a mutant vimentin protein. In this mutant, every hydrophobic residue originally at an `a` or `d` position within the central rod domain is systematically replaced with serine, a small, polar, uncharged amino acid. The head and tail domains remain unaltered. The researchers then purify this mutant protein and place it in a physiological aqueous buffer that is known to support wild-type vimentin filament assembly.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure and assembly, which of the following outcomes is the most likely for the engineered mutant vimentin protein in this buffer?\n\nA. The mutant protein will be largely insoluble and will form amorphous aggregates, thus being incompetent for ordered filament assembly.\n\nB. The mutant protein will be soluble and will assemble into filaments that appear structurally identical to wild-type filaments, but will be significantly less stable.\n\nC. The mutant protein will be highly soluble but will be completely incompetent for assembly into dimers or any higher-order filamentous structures.\n\nD. The mutant protein will be soluble and will correctly form coiled-coil dimers, but these dimers will be unable to assemble into the anti-parallel tetramers required for filament elongation.", "solution": "Principle 1: Coiled-coil formation and the heptad repeat. In parallel coiled coils, positions a and d of the heptad repeat align along one face of each alpha-helix to form the buried core at the dimer interface. Stability arises primarily from the hydrophobic effect and tight knobs-into-holes packing of large hydrophobic side chains at a and d, supplemented by electrostatic interactions (often between e and g positions) and backbone hydrogen bonding characteristic of alpha-helices.\n\nPrinciple 2: Energetic consequence of replacing core hydrophobics with serine. Systematically substituting every hydrophobic residue at a and d with serine removes the principal hydrophobic driving force for dimerization and disrupts steric complementarity at the core. Serine is small and polar; burying its hydroxyl group in the coiled-coil core would introduce an unfavorable desolvation penalty and unsatisfied polarity unless compensated by specific hydrogen bonds, which are not available in the canonical coiled-coil core. Consequently, both the hydrophobic effect and van der Waals packing that stabilize the coiled-coil are lost, making dimer formation highly unfavorable.\n\nPrinciple 3: Solubility expectations after hydrophobic-to-polar core substitutions. Removing many hydrophobic residues from the rod domain and replacing them with polar residues typically increases solubility in aqueous buffer, because the protein surface becomes more hydrophilic and fewer hydrophobic patches are available to drive nonspecific aggregation. Thus, amorphous aggregation driven by hydrophobic exposure is less likely in this mutant.\n\nLogical consequence 1: Failure at the earliest assembly step. Since the first step in vimentin assembly is formation of a parallel coiled-coil dimer, and the engineered substitutions abrogate the hydrophobic core required for this step, the mutant will be incompetent to form dimers. Without dimers, assembly into antiparallel tetramers and higher-order filament structures cannot occur.\n\nLogical consequence 2: Evaluation of options.\n- Option A is unlikely because reducing hydrophobic content and increasing polarity generally enhances solubility and reduces nonspecific hydrophobic aggregation; amorphous aggregation is not the expected outcome here.\n- Option B is inconsistent because the coiled-coil core is fundamentally disrupted; the protein cannot assemble into filaments that are structurally identical to wild type, even if less stable.\n- Option D is inconsistent because the mutant is unlikely to form correct coiled-coil dimers at all; the defect prevents dimerization rather than selectively blocking tetramerization.\n- Option C matches the predicted behavior: the protein becomes highly soluble but is completely incompetent for assembly into dimers or any higher-order filamentous structures.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the mutant remains highly soluble and fails to assemble at the dimerization step, precluding any filament formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2320124"}, {"introduction": "While all intermediate filaments share a common structural plan, their assembly is governed by strict rules of compatibility that prevent unwanted mixing. This \"hands-on\" thought experiment [@problem_id:2320179] challenges you to apply these rules to a mixed population of monomers from different IF families, specifically Type I/II keratins and Type III vimentin. By predicting the outcome, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the molecular specificity that allows cells to construct distinct, coexisting filament networks from a shared pool of proteins.", "problem": "A research-focused cell biology lab is investigating the assembly rules of the cytoskeleton. A graduate student prepares a highly purified, equimolar mixture of three different Intermediate Filament (IF) monomers in a test tube: Keratin 8 (K8), Keratin 18 (K18), and Vimentin. The classification of these proteins is as follows:\n- Keratin 8 (K8) is a Type II (basic) keratin.\n- Keratin 18 (K18) is a Type I (acidic) keratin.\n- Vimentin is a Type III IF protein.\n\nThe student combines these three proteins in a buffer solution under physiological conditions that are known to promote the self-assembly of IFs from their monomeric subunits. After an incubation period sufficient for polymerization to reach equilibrium, the student plans to analyze the resulting structures.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the state of the mixture in the test tube after the incubation period?\n\nA. One uniform population of hybrid filaments will form, where K8, K18, and Vimentin monomers are randomly incorporated throughout the filament length.\n\nB. Two distinct populations of filaments will form: one population consisting of K8/K18 filaments and a separate population consisting of Vimentin filaments.\n\nC. Only K8/K18 filaments will form. The Vimentin monomers will remain unassembled because their polymerization is inhibited by the presence of keratin proteins.\n\nD. Only Vimentin filaments will form. The K8 and K18 monomers will remain unassembled because Type I and Type II keratins cannot polymerize in the presence of a Type III IF protein.\n\nE. No filaments of any kind will form. The mixture of monomers from different IF families creates steric hindrance that prevents the formation of the initial dimer and tetramer structures required for polymerization.", "solution": "Identify the protein classes and their assembly requirements:\n- Keratin 8 (K8) is a Type II keratin and Keratin 18 (K18) is a Type I keratin. By the well-established assembly rule for keratins, Type I and Type II keratins form obligate heterodimers; neither Type I nor Type II keratins form stable homodimer coiled coils under physiological assembly conditions. Therefore, in a mixture containing K8 and K18, the lowest-order assembly unit will be the K8/K18 heterodimer.\n- Vimentin is a Type III intermediate filament (IF) protein. Type III IFs (e.g., vimentin, desmin) can form homodimers and homopolymeric filaments and can heteropolymerize with certain other Type III family members, but they do not co-dimerize with keratins and do not co-assemble into mixed keratin/Type III filaments under standard conditions.\n\nApply the hierarchical IF assembly pathway to each family independently:\n- For keratins: K8/K18 heterodimers form; two heterodimers associate in an antiparallel, half-staggered manner to make tetramers; tetramers laterally associate to form unit-length filaments; longitudinal annealing and radial compaction yield mature keratin intermediate filaments. Because Type I/II pairing is required and because cross-family dimerization with vimentin does not occur, keratin subunits assemble only with each other (K8 with K18) and not with vimentin.\n- For vimentin: vimentin monomers form coiled-coil homodimers; homodimers associate into tetramers, then unit-length filaments, and mature vimentin filaments. This process proceeds autonomously in the same buffer conditions that promote keratin assembly. The presence of keratins does not inhibit vimentin polymerization under typical in vitro assembly conditions.\n\nEvaluate cross-family compatibility and mixing:\n- Cross-family co-assembly into hybrid filaments requires compatible coiled-coil dimer interfaces and head/tail domain interactions that permit stable tetramer formation across families. Empirically and mechanistically, keratin (Type I/II) and vimentin (Type III) do not form mixed heterodimers and do not co-assemble into hybrid filaments; instead, they assemble into separate networks when co-expressed in cells and into separate filament populations in vitro.\n- Therefore, random incorporation of K8, K18, and vimentin along the same filament is not supported. Likewise, there is no general inhibitory effect whereby one family blocks the polymerization of the other under physiological assembly conditions.\n\nMatch the reasoning to the options:\n- A is incorrect because keratins and vimentin do not co-assemble into a single hybrid filament population.\n- B is correct: K8 and K18 form keratin filaments together, and vimentin forms its own filaments, yielding two distinct filament populations.\n- C is incorrect because vimentin is not inhibited by keratins; it assembles independently.\n- D is incorrect because keratins (Type I with Type II) do polymerize in the presence of Type III; they simply do so separately.\n- E is incorrect because there is no steric hindrance preventing assembly; both families assemble along their respective, compatible pathways.\n\nConclusion: The mixture will contain two distinct filament populations: K8/K18 keratin filaments and vimentin filaments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2320179"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the sequential stages of filament construction requires tools that can monitor molecular interactions as they happen.

To specifically monitor this lateral association step, the researchers design an experiment using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).\n\nThey prepare two separate populations of purified, assembly-competent vimentin tetramers. In Population A, the vimentin protein is fused to a donor fluorophore. In Population B, the protein is fused to an acceptor fluorophore at the identical structural position. The proteins are engineered such that after assembly into protofilaments, the fluorophores are located on the outer surface.\n\nThe two populations of protofilaments are then mixed in equal amounts and induced to assemble. The Förster radius ($R_0$) for the chosen donor-acceptor pair is 5.00 nm. From high-resolution structural models, it is known that when two protofilaments align side-by-side during lateral association, the average distance ($r$) between a donor fluorophore on one protofilament and its nearest-neighbor acceptor fluorophore on an adjacent protofilament is 3.50 nm.\n\nAssuming ideal conditions where all protofilaments successfully associate into mature filaments, calculate the maximum theoretical FRET efficiency between the donor and acceptor fluorophores.
