By working backward from a required core area for a sensitive species, you will learn how to calculate the necessary total size of a circular reserve, a fundamental skill in conservation planning and design.", "problem": "A conservation biologist is tasked with designing a circular habitat reserve to protect an interior-dwelling species. This species is sensitive to **edge effects**, which are ecological changes that occur at the boundary of a habitat. These effects, such as increased predation and altered microclimates, penetrate a certain distance into the patch from its perimeter. The area unaffected by these edge effects is known as the **core area**.\n\nThe design requires a minimum core area of 10.0 hectares. Field studies have determined that the edge effect penetrates a constant distance of 75.0 meters into the habitat from its outer boundary. Assuming the habitat patch is a perfect circle, what is the minimum total radius of the circular reserve that must be established to meet this core area requirement?\n\nFor your calculation, use the conversion factor 1 hectare = 10,000 square meters.

The Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) is a widely used metric that measures the diversity of patch types within a landscape. It is sensitive to both the number of different patch types present (richness) and the proportional area of each type (evenness). The SHDI is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$ SHDI = - \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (P_i \\ln P_i) $$\n\nwhere $m$ is the total number of different patch types, and $P_i$ is the proportion of the landscape area occupied by the $i$-th patch type.\n\nConsider a hypothetical landscape designed for a baseline ecological study. This landscape is completely homogeneous, consisting of only a single type of habitat (for example, a uniform grassland or a monoculture forest). For this perfectly uniform landscape, calculate the value of the Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI).", "solution": "By definition, the Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) is given by\n$$\nSHDI = - \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(P_{i} \\ln P_{i}\\right).\n$$\nIn a completely homogeneous landscape with a single patch type, the richness is $m=1$.
