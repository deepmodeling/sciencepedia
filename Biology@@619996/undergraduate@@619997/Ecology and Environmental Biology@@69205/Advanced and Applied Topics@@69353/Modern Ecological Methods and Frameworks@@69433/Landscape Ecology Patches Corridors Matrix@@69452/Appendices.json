A powerful approach models the landscape as an electrical circuit, where habitat patches are nodes and the intervening landscape matrix provides resistance to the movement of organisms.\n\nConsider a species living in three distinct habitat patches, $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$. The landscape matrix separating these patches is composed of two primary types: Type A (e.g., mature forest) and Type B (e.g., agricultural land).

The resistance of a path segment is its length multiplied by the characteristic resistance of the matrix type it traverses.\n\nThe characteristic resistance per unit length for Type A matrix, $R_A$, is defined as a baseline value of $1$ (in arbitrary resistance units). The characteristic resistance for Type B matrix, $R_B$, is an unknown value that needs to be determined.\n\nThe total path lengths and their compositions for the shortest paths between each pair of patches have been determined as follows:\n- Path between $P_1$ and $P_2$: consists of 10 units of Type A and 40 units of Type B.\n- Path between $P_1$ and $P_3$: consists of 50 units of Type A and 10 units of Type B.\n- Path between $P_2$ and $P_3$: consists of 30 units of Type A and 30 units of Type B.\n\nGenetic analysis of the populations yields the following pairwise Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$) values, which measure genetic differentiation:\n- $F_{ST}$ between $P_1$ and $P_2$: $0.34$\n- $F_{ST}$ between $P_1$ and $P_3$: $0.01$\n- $F_{ST}$ between $P_2$ and $P_3$: $0.25$\n\nThe hypothesis is that the landscape resistance is a primary driver of this genetic differentiation.
