Plants using different photosynthetic pathways have distinct $\\delta^{13}C$ values. For instance, $C_4$ plants like corn have less negative $\\delta^{13}C$ values than $C_3$ plants like alfalfa. This difference is passed up the food chain to consumers.\n\nAn agricultural scientist is monitoring a cow that is initially fed a diet consisting exclusively of corn silage. The average $\\delta^{13}C$ value for this corn is $-12.5$ ‰. The scientist then switches the cow's diet entirely to alfalfa hay, which has an average $\\delta^{13}C$ value of $-27.0$ ‰.\n\nWhen an animal consumes a diet, its tissues are typically enriched in $^{13}C$ relative to the diet. This enrichment is quantified by the diet-tissue fractionation factor, $\\Delta^{13}C$. For the cow's muscle tissue, this fractionation factor ($\\Delta^{13}C_{\\text{muscle-diet}}$) is constant at $+3.1$ ‰.\n\nAssuming the cow's muscle tissue reaches a new isotopic equilibrium after a sufficient amount of time on the new alfalfa diet, calculate the total change in the $\\delta^{13}C$ value of this tissue.
