The ecologist suspects a relationship between the average height of the plants and the moisture content of the soil in which they grow.

In each plot, the average soil moisture content is measured as a percentage of water by volume, and the average height of the *F. aridis* specimens is measured in centimeters (cm).\n\nThe collected data are as follows:\n- Plot 1: Soil Moisture = 12%, Plant Height = 15 cm\n- Plot 2: Soil Moisture = 15%, Plant Height = 18 cm\n- Plot 3: Soil Moisture = 18%, Plant Height = 22 cm\n- Plot 4: Soil Moisture = 22%, Plant Height = 25 cm\n- Plot 5: Soil Moisture = 25%, Plant Height = 24 cm\n- Plot 6: Soil Moisture = 28%, Plant Height = 30 cm\n- Plot 7: Soil Moisture = 33%, Plant Height = 35 cm\n- Plot 8: Soil Moisture = 35%, Plant Height = 36 cm\n\nBased on a visualization of this dataset as a scatter plot, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between soil moisture content and plant height?\n\nA.

The four sites differ in both elevation and effort, so interpreting richness across elevations requires considering the potential confounding effect of unequal effort on observed richness.\n\nIdentify what the bubble sizes imply about sampling effort at each site and how that affects confidence in richness estimates:\n- Site B (1500 m) has the highest species richness and the largest bubble, indicating very high survey effort; this makes the high richness at Site B more robust.\n- Site D (also 1500 m) has much lower species richness but the smallest bubble, indicating very low survey effort; this low richness could be due to under-sampling rather than a true ecological difference.\n- Site A (500 m) has high richness and a large bubble, consistent with substantial effort; this likely increases confidence in its richness value but does not, by itself, establish a general elevational pattern.\n- Site C (2500 m) has low richness and a medium-sized bubble; with only one high-elevation site and moderate effort, we cannot generalize that high elevations inherently support few species.\n\nEvaluate each option against these considerations:\n- Option A claims a clear and definitive mid-elevation peak. With only one well-sampled mid-elevation site and another poorly sampled mid-elevation site, plus unequal efforts across elevations, this conclusion is not justified.\n- Option B claims an inherent paucity of species at high elevation. This is not supported by a single high-elevation site with only moderate effort; more data are needed.\n- Option C claims species richness is primarily determined by effort, not elevation. While effort clearly influences observed richness (as seen by B versus D), the data do not establish that effort is the primary determinant across sites, and C’s medium effort yet low richness cautions against that conclusion.\n- Option E claims a negative relationship with richness consistently decreasing with elevation. This is contradicted by the higher richness at mid-elevation (Site B) compared with low elevation (Site A).\n- Option D acknowledges that Site B’s high richness is supported by high effort, while Site D’s low richness at the same elevation may reflect insufficient sampling.
