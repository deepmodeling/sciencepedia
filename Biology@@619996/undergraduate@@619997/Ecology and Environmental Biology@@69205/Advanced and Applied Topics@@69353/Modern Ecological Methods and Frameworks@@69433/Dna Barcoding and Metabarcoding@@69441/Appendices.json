Instead of attempting to capture and test host amphibians, which is invasive and logistically challenging, the team plans to use environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis. This technique involves filtering water and testing for the presence of genetic material shed by the target organism. Previous studies in similar ecosystems suggest that when the fungus is present, its free-floating DNA fragments are found at a very low average concentration, which can be modeled as a stochastic process. The team assumes an average concentration of $\\lambda = 3.5$ DNA copies per cubic meter of water. To consider the wetland \"positive\" for the fungus, the team must detect at least one DNA copy. What is the minimum volume of water, in liters, they must filter to be at least 98% certain of detecting the fungus, assuming it is present?\n\nFor your calculation, you may need the conversion factor $1 \\text{ m}^3 = 1000 \\text{ L}$.

This exercise demonstrates how logical filtering rules refine biodiversity metrics like species richness, leading to more robust and defensible ecological conclusions.", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the impact of land-use history on soil fungal diversity. They compare two adjacent forest sites: Patch A, an old-growth forest that has been undisturbed for over 200 years, and Patch B, an area reforested 30 years ago on land previously used for agriculture. The investigation uses DNA metabarcoding, a method that involves sequencing a specific genetic marker to identify multiple species from a single environmental sample. In this study, the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region is sequenced, and the resulting DNA sequences are clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity threshold. Each OTU is treated as a proxy for a distinct fungal species.\n\nThe initial raw data analysis provides the following counts:\n- The total number of unique OTUs identified across both patches combined is 600.\n- The species richness (total number of OTUs) initially found in Patch A is 450.\n- The species richness (total number of OTUs) initially found in Patch B is 350.\n\nTo ensure data quality, a filtering protocol is applied. The protocol states that an OTU will be completely removed from the study if it is a \"singleton\" (represented by only a single DNA sequence read) in *every* patch in which it is detected. A detailed breakdown of singleton OTUs is as follows:\n- There are 40 OTUs that are found only in Patch A and are singletons.\n- There are 25 OTUs that are found only in Patch B and are singletons.\n- There are 15 OTUs that are found in both patches and are singletons in both Patch A and Patch B.\n- There are 10 OTUs that are found in both patches, which are singletons in Patch A but have multiple reads in Patch B.\n- There are 5 OTUs that are found in both patches, which are singletons in Patch B but have multiple reads in Patch A.\n\nYour task is to calculate the final, filtered species richness for Patch A and the final species richness for Patch B.
