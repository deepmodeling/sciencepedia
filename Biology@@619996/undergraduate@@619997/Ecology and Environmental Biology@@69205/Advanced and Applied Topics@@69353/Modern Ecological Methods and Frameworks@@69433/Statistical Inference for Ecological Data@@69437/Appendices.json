This often involves comparing a recent sample to a well-established historical benchmark. This exercise introduces the one-sample t-test, a cornerstone of statistical inference used to assess whether a sample mean is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean. By calculating the test statistic yourself, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how we quantify the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis [@problem_id:1883612].", "problem": "A wildlife biologist is studying the population of island foxes (*Urocyon littoralis*) on Santa Cruz Island. Historical data collected over the last 50 years show that the average body weight of an adult fox is stable at a population mean of $\\mu_0 = 1.80$ kg. The biologist is concerned that recent changes in food availability might be impacting the health of the current fox population. To investigate this, a research team captured and weighed a random sample of $n=36$ adult foxes. The mean weight of this sample was found to be $\\bar{x} = 1.71$ kg, with a sample standard deviation of $s = 0.27$ kg.\n\nTo quantify the deviation of the recent sample from the historical norm, a specific test statistic is calculated.
