This practice challenges you to work like an ecologist, using data from two different areas to calculate the scaling exponent $z$.

This hands-on practice moves beyond total area to consider habitat quality by introducing the critical concept of 'edge effects' ([@problem_id:1883151]). By comparing two reserves of identical area but different shapes, you will quantify how geometry influences the amount of viable 'core' habitat, revealing a key principle in effective nature reserve design.", "problem": "In conservation biology, the design of nature reserves is critical for their effectiveness. A key consideration is the \"edge effect,\" where the habitat near the boundary of a reserve is altered by external conditions, making it less suitable for species that require undisturbed, interior conditions. This \"edge\" habitat is often modeled as a band of constant width extending inward from the reserve's perimeter.\n\nConsider two proposed designs for a new nature reserve, each enclosing a total area of $A = 100.0 \\text{ km}^2$. The first design is a single, compact square. The second design is a long, thin rectangle whose length is 25 times its width. The edge effect is found to penetrate a uniform distance of $d = 0.500 \\text{ km}$ from all boundaries into the reserve. The area within this band is considered 'edge habitat,' while the remaining pristine area is 'core habitat'.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the rectangular reserve's area that is classified as edge habitat. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fraction of the rectangular reserve's area that is considered edge habitat. This fraction can be calculated as the ratio of the edge habitat area to the total area of the reserve.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{total}}$ be the total area of the rectangular reserve, $A_{\\text{core}}$ be its core habitat area, and $A_{\\text{edge}}$ be its edge habitat area.\nWe are given $A_{\\text{total}} = 100.0 \\text{ km}^2$.\nThe relationship between these areas is:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{core}} + A_{\\text{edge}}$$\nTherefore, the edge area is $A_{\\text{edge}} = A_{\\text{total}} - A_{\\text{core}}$.\nThe fraction of edge habitat is $\\frac{A_{\\text{edge}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{total}} - A_{\\text{core}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = 1 - \\frac{A_{\\text{core}}}{A_{\\text{total}}}$.\n\nOur first step is to determine the dimensions of the rectangular reserve. Let $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width.\nWe are given:\n1. $L \\times W = A_{\\text{total}} = 100.0 \\text{ km}^2$\n2. $L = 25W$\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n$$(25W) \\times W = 100.0 \\text{ km}^2$$\n$$25W^2 = 100.0 \\text{ km}^2$$\n$$W^2 = \\frac{100.0}{25} \\text{ km}^2 = 4.000 \\text{ km}^2$$\n$$W = \\sqrt{4.000 \\text{ km}^2} = 2.000 \\text{ km}$$\n\nNow we can find the length $L$:\n$$L = 25W = 25 \\times 2.000 \\text{ km} = 50.00 \\text{ km}$$\nSo, the rectangular reserve has dimensions $50.00 \\text{ km} \\times 2.000 \\text{ km}$.\n\nNext, we determine the dimensions of the core habitat. The core habitat is the inner rectangle remaining after removing the edge band of width $d = 0.500 \\text{ km}$ from all sides.\nThe length of the core rectangle, $L_{\\text{core}}$, is the total length minus the edge band from both ends:\n$$L_{\\text{core}} = L - 2d = 50.00 \\text{ km} - 2(0.500 \\text{ km}) = 50.00 \\text{ km} - 1.000 \\text{ km} = 49.00 \\text{ km}$$\nThe width of the core rectangle, $W_{\\text{core}}$, is the total width minus the edge band from both sides:\n$$W_{\\text{core}} = W - 2d = 2.000 \\text{ km} - 2(0.500 \\text{ km}) = 2.000 \\text{ km} - 1.000 \\text{ km} = 1.000 \\text{ km}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of the core habitat:\n$$A_{\\text{core}} = L_{\\text{core}} \\times W_{\\text{core}} = 49.00 \\text{ km} \\times 1.000 \\text{ km} = 49.00 \\text{ km}^2$$\n\nWith the core area calculated, we can find the edge area:\n$$A_{\\text{edge}} = A_{\\text{total}} - A_{\\text{core}} = 100.0 \\text{ km}^2 - 49.00 \\text{ km}^2 = 51.00 \\text{ km}^2$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction of the rectangular reserve's area that is edge habitat:\n$$\\text{Fraction of edge habitat} = \\frac{A_{\\text{edge}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{51.00 \\text{ km}^2}{100.0 \\text{ km}^2} = 0.5100$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.5100$ has four significant figures. Rounding to three significant figures gives $0.510$.\n\nFor comparison, let's analyze the square reserve. Its side length would be $S = \\sqrt{100.0 \\text{ km}^2} = 10.00 \\text{ km}$. The core habitat would be a square with side length $S_{\\text{core}} = 10.00 \\text{ km} - 2(0.500 \\text{ km}) = 9.000 \\text{ km}$. The core area would be $A_{\\text{core, square}} = (9.000 \\text{ km})^2 = 81.00 \\text{ km}^2$. The edge habitat area would be $100.0 - 81.00 = 19.00 \\text{ km}^2$, which is only $19.0\\%$ of the total area. This demonstrates that for the same total area, the long, thin rectangle has a much larger proportion of edge habitat (51.0%) compared to the compact square (19.0%), making it less effective for interior-dependent species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.510}$$", "id": "1883151"}]}
