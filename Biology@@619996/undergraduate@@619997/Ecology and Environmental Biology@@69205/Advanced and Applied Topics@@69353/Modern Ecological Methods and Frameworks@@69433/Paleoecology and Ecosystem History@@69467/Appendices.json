This practice introduces dendrochronology, the science of dating past events using tree rings. By matching the unique patterns of wide and narrow rings between trees of different ages—a process called cross-dating—we can construct chronologies that extend back thousands of years. This exercise [@problem_id:1869561] simulates this process, challenging you to align a 'floating' chronology from an archaeological sample with a 'master' record from a living tree to determine the age of a historic structure.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying climate history in a remote, temperate forest using dendrochronology, the science of dating events using tree rings. At the end of the growing season in the year 2022, she extracts a core from a living Douglas fir tree that is known to be exactly 310 years old. Analysis of this core provides a continuous and reliable record of annual growth, forming a \"master chronology\" for the region.\n\nNearby, the ecologist discovers the ruins of an old cabin. A well-preserved wooden support beam, also from a Douglas fir, is recovered. A core is taken from this beam, revealing a sequence of 12 distinct annual growth rings. The outermost ring (the \"bark ring\") is intact, indicating this was the last ring formed before the tree was harvested.\n\nTo determine when the cabin was built, you must match the pattern from the ruin's beam to the master chronology from the living tree. The relative widths of the tree rings are categorized as Wide (W), Average (A), or Narrow (N). A narrower ring generally indicates a year with poorer growing conditions (e.g., drought).\n\nThe pattern of the **most recent 20 rings** from the living tree core, starting with the year 2003 and ending with the year 2022, is as follows:\n`W-A-N-W-A-A-W-N-N-A-W-N-A-W-A-N-W-W-A-N`\n\nThe pattern of the **12 rings** from the ruin's beam, from the innermost ring to the outermost (bark) ring, is:\n`W-N-N-A-W-N-A-W-A-N-W-W`\n\nBy matching the pattern of the ruin's beam sample to the established master chronology, determine the calendar year in which the tree used for the ruin's beam was felled.", "solution": "The goal is to find the calendar year when the tree for the ruin's beam was cut down. This is achieved through the process of cross-dating, which involves aligning the \"floating\" chronology of the ruin sample with the \"master\" chronology of the living tree.\n\nFirst, let's establish the timeline for the master chronology. The core was taken at the end of 2022, so the outermost ring corresponds to the year 2022. The problem provides the sequence for the 20 most recent years. We can list these years and their corresponding ring-width patterns:\n\n2003: W\n2004: A\n2005: N\n2006: W\n2007: A\n2008: A\n2009: W\n2010: N\n2011: N\n2012: A\n2013: W\n2014: N\n2015: A\n2016: W\n2017: A\n2018: N\n2019: W\n2020: W\n2021: A\n2022: N\n\nThe sequence for the master chronology is: `W-A-N-W-A-A-W-N-N-A-W-N-A-W-A-N-W-W-A-N`.\n\nNext, we have the floating chronology from the ruin's beam. The sequence consists of 12 rings, from oldest (innermost) to newest (outermost):\n`W-N-N-A-W-N-A-W-A-N-W-W`\n\nNow, we must find where this 12-ring sequence fits within the 20-ring master chronology. We can do this by visual inspection, sliding the floating sequence along the master sequence until a match is found.\n\nLet's write down the master sequence and look for the start of the ruin's sequence (`W-N-N...`).\n\nMaster Sequence: `W A N W A A W N N A W N A W A N W W A N`\n\nWe can test for alignments:\n- Starting at the first ring (Year 2003): `W-A-N...` does not match `W-N-N...`.\n- Starting at the seventh ring (Year 2009, 'W'): The subsequent sequence is `W-N-N-A-W-N-A-W-A-N-W-W`. This is a perfect match for the 12-ring sequence from the ruin's beam.\n\nLet's verify this alignment explicitly:\n\nMaster Year:  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020\nMaster Ring:    W     N     N     A     W     N     A     W     A     N     W     W\nRuin Ring #:     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    12\nRuin Ring:      W     N     N     A     W     N     A     W     A     N     W     W\n\nThe alignment is correct. The first ring of the ruin's beam corresponds to the year 2009. The sequence continues for 12 years. The last (outermost) ring of the ruin's beam, which is the 12th ring in its sequence, corresponds to the 12th year in our matched sequence from the master chronology.\n\nThe first year of the match is 2009. The sequence is 12 years long, so the last year is `2009 + 12 - 1`.\nLast year = $2009 + 11 = 2020$.\n\nSo, the 12th ring of the ruin's beam sample corresponds to the year 2020. The problem states that the outermost ring (bark ring) is intact. This means the tree was felled during or just after the growing season of the year corresponding to its last ring. Therefore, the tree was felled in the year 2020. The construction of the cabin would have followed this felling date.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2020}$$", "id": "1869561"}, {"introduction": "Once a timeline is in place, paleoecologists reconstruct past environments using proxies like fossil pollen.

A fraction, $(1-f)$, of the total pine pollen is deposited uniformly within a near-shore annular region of width $w = 100.0 \\text{ m}$, measured inwards from the lake's edge. The remaining small fraction, $f = 0.05$, of the pine pollen is light enough to be distributed uniformly over the entire lake, similar to the birch pollen.\n\nA sediment core is retrieved from the middle of the near-shore region where pine pollen is concentrated (i.e., at a radius corresponding to the midpoint of the annular zone).
