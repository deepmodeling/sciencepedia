When volunteers are tasked with identifying species, it's crucial to assess how accurately they can distinguish between similar organisms, such as an invasive species and a native one. This exercise [@problem_id:1835040] will guide you through calculating sensitivity and specificity, two powerful statistical measures that quantify the reliability of an identification tool. Mastering these concepts is the first step toward building confidence in the data collected by your team of citizen scientists.", "problem": "An ecological research group is running a citizen science project to track the spread of an invasive beetle, *Anoplophora asiaticus*. This invasive species closely resembles a native, harmless beetle, *Nephila nativus*. To aid in identification, the researchers developed and distributed a textual dichotomous key to volunteers. To assess the quality of the data being collected, a validation study was conducted. A lead entomologist prepared a test set of 500 preserved beetle specimens. This set contained 150 specimens of the invasive *A. asiaticus* and 350 specimens of the native *N. nativus*. Volunteers, using only the provided key, were then asked to identify each specimen.\n\nThe results of the citizen scientists' identifications were as follows:\n- Of the 150 true invasive beetles, 120 were correctly identified as invasive.\n- Of the 350 true native beetles, 35 were incorrectly identified as invasive.\n\nTwo important metrics for evaluating such a key are Sensitivity and Specificity. Sensitivity (also known as the True Positive Rate) measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. Specificity (or True Negative Rate) measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such. For this project, an \"invasive\" identification is considered a \"positive\" test result, and a \"native\" identification is a \"negative\" test result.\n\nBased on the validation study data, which of the following options correctly states the Sensitivity and Specificity of the identification key when used by citizen scientists?\n\nA.

From the data, TP equals 120.\n- False negatives (FN): invasive specimens incorrectly identified as native.

From the data, FP equals 35.\n- True negatives (TN): native specimens correctly identified as native.

Imagine you want to test whether a new bee house design is more effective than a standard one—a task perfectly suited for distribution among many volunteer gardeners. This problem [@problem_id:1834993] demonstrates how to design a simple yet effective A/B test and analyze the aggregated results. You will learn to move beyond raw counts to calculate normalized metrics like \"nesting success proportion\" and \"relative improvement\" to make a data-driven conclusion.", "problem": "A conservation organization has developed a new design for a solitary bee house, \"Design N,\" which they hypothesize will have a higher nesting success rate than the \"Standard Design S.\" To test this, they initiated a citizen science project. Each of the $N_{\\text{participants}} = 100$ participating households received a kit with one house of each design. The Standard Design house (Design S) has $T_S = 40$ potential nesting tunnels, while the New Design house (Design N) has $T_N = 50$ potential nesting tunnels. Participants were instructed to mount both houses in their gardens under identical environmental conditions.\n\nAt the end of the season, all houses were collected, and the total number of occupied (sealed) tunnels was counted for each design type across all participants. The aggregated data are as follows:\n- Total occupied tunnels in all Design S houses: $O_S = 1280$\n- Total occupied tunnels in all Design N houses: $O_N = 2250$\n\nThe \"nesting success proportion\" for a given design is defined as the total number of occupied tunnels divided by the total number of available tunnels for that design. To compare the two designs, calculate the \"relative improvement\" of Design N over Design S. This metric is defined as the absolute increase in nesting success proportion (proportion of N minus proportion of S) divided by the nesting success proportion of the standard design S.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The nesting success proportion for each design is defined as occupied tunnels divided by available tunnels.

This is especially true in citizen science, where observation effort can be uneven and not all animals present are detected. This practice [@problem_id:1834994] challenges you to correct a naive population density estimate by accounting for two critical real-world factors: the probability of detecting an individual and the average number of times a detected individual is reported. This exercise provides a practical lesson in how ecologists adjust raw data to uncover a more accurate picture of a species' population status.", "problem": "A regional conservation group initiated a citizen science project to estimate the population density of the Crimson-crested Flycatcher, a reclusive migratory bird. Over a one-month period, volunteers used a smartphone application to submit audio recordings of the bird's distinctive song within a designated 25.0-hectare forest reserve. The app's software filters out duplicate audio files but cannot distinguish between different individual birds. At the end of the study, a total of 217 unique song recordings had been cataloged. Based on this, the project leaders calculated a naive population density by simply dividing the number of recordings by the area of the reserve.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of this method, a team of professional ecologists conducted a follow-up study on the same population. Their research revealed two significant confounding factors. First, they determined that the probability of any single bird present in the reserve being detected (i.e., having its song recorded at least once by a volunteer) was only 0.65, due to the species' infrequent vocalizations and the variable distribution of volunteers. Second, they found that due to the enthusiasm of the volunteers and the recognizable nature of the song, detected birds were recorded multiple times. On average, each detected bird accounted for 3.2 distinct recordings submitted to the database.\n\nUsing the findings from the professional study to correct the initial citizen science data, calculate the true population density of the Crimson-crested Flycatcher in the reserve.
