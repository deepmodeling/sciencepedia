This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to practice the essential skill of calculating allele frequencies directly from genotype data. Mastering this calculation is a foundational step for nearly all subsequent population genetic analyses, from testing for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to measuring genetic drift. [@problem_id:1865179]", "problem": "Conservation biologists are monitoring a small, isolated population of an endangered species of diploid salamander to assess its genetic diversity. They focus on a single gene locus that influences tail coloration. The gene has two alleles: a dominant allele `G` and a recessive allele `g`. By collecting tissue samples from every individual in the population and performing genetic analysis, they determined the genotypes of all 50 salamanders. The survey revealed that 10 individuals are homozygous dominant (GG), 15 are heterozygous (Gg), and 25 are homozygous recessive (gg).\n\nBased on this complete population census, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele `g`. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of diploid individuals and $n_{GG}$, $n_{Gg}$, $n_{gg}$ be the genotype counts. Each individual contributes $2$ alleles, so the total number of alleles is $2N$. The number of recessive alleles $g$ is given by $2n_{gg}+n_{Gg}$, since $gg$ contributes two $g$ alleles per individual and $Gg$ contributes one.\n\nGiven $N=50$, $n_{GG}=10$, $n_{Gg}=15$, and $n_{gg}=25$, the frequency $q$ of allele $g$ is\n$$\nq=\\frac{2n_{gg}+n_{Gg}}{2N}=\\frac{2\\cdot 25+15}{2\\cdot 50}=\\frac{65}{100}=0.65.\n$$\nThus, the recessive allele frequency is $0.65$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.65}$$", "id": "1865179"}, {"introduction": "The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a cornerstone technique in molecular ecology, but its power is entirely dependent on rigorous experimental design, particularly the correct use of controls. This thought experiment challenges you to interpret a common but critical issueâ€”an unexpected band in a no-template negative control. This practice reinforces the vital importance of controls for validating scientific results and identifying potential contamination, ensuring that our conclusions are built upon a trustworthy foundation. [@problem_id:1865171]", "problem": "A molecular ecologist is investigating the diet of a rare owl species by analyzing fecal pellets collected from its habitat. The goal is to determine if the owls are preying on a specific species of vole. The ecologist extracts DNA from the fecal pellets and uses a technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify a short, species-specific DNA sequence from the vole.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the results, several controls are included. One crucial control is the \"no-template\" negative control, which contains all the PCR reagents (water, primers, DNA polymerase, etc.) but no DNA extract from any sample. After amplification, the PCR products are visualized using gel electrophoresis, which separates DNA fragments by size.\n\nUpon examining the gel, the ecologist observes that the lanes corresponding to several fecal samples show a distinct DNA band at 450 base pairs, which is the expected size for the vole-specific DNA sequence. However, the lane for the no-template negative control also shows a clear band at the same 450 base pair size.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely and scientifically sound interpretation of this specific observation in the negative control lane?\n\nA. The results are invalid because one or more of the PCR reagents were contaminated with vole DNA.\n\nB. The PCR primers are binding to each other and creating a product of 450 base pairs.\n\nC. The experiment was highly successful, demonstrating that the PCR is sensitive enough to detect even trace amounts of DNA.\n\nD. The owl species has endogenous DNA sequences that are similar enough to the vole-specific sequence to be amplified.\n\nE. The gel electrophoresis was run at an incorrect voltage, causing DNA from an adjacent lane to leak into the negative control lane.", "solution": "PCR detects specific DNA sequences by primer-directed amplification using DNA polymerase. A no-template negative control contains all reagents except any DNA extract; therefore, the only scientifically valid expectation for this control is no amplification, resulting in no band on the gel.\n\nObservation: A clear band at the expected target size of 450 base pairs appears in the no-template control. In a no-template reaction, the only way to generate a specific-sized amplicon is the presence of unintended template DNA carrying the target sequence (commonly aerosolized carryover amplicon from previous PCRs or contaminated reagents/primers). Thus, the most likely interpretation is contamination.\n\nWhy the other options are not consistent:\n- Primer-dimer artifacts (option B) typically produce much smaller products, often less than 100 base pairs, and do not reproducibly form a clean, specific band matching the exact expected target size of 450 base pairs.\n- High sensitivity (option C) does not explain amplification in the complete absence of intended template; sensitivity does not justify a positive signal in a negative control and instead points to contamination.\n- Endogenous owl sequences (option D) cannot explain a band in the no-template control because no DNA was added to that reaction.\n- Incorrect gel voltage (option E) can distort migration but does not create bands in an empty lane. Physical spillover from adjacent wells is a loading error, not a voltage issue, and would not reliably produce a sharp, target-sized band.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound interpretation is contamination of one or more PCR components with target DNA or its amplicon, rendering the results invalid until the contamination source is eliminated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1865171"}, {"introduction": "Molecular techniques not only describe genetic patterns but also serve as powerful tools for ecological discovery, allowing us to ask and answer complex questions about the natural world. This exercise delves into the modern application of environmental DNA (eDNA) to solve a compelling ecological puzzle, highlighting how unexpected molecular signals can reveal hidden processes. Your task is to apply ecological reasoning to interpret the molecular data, bridging the gap between the lab bench and complex field dynamics. [@problem_id:1865133]", "problem": "A team of ecologists is conducting a biodiversity survey in a remote, pristine alpine spring located within a national park where public access has been forbidden for over 50 years. The researchers adhere to strict protocols to prevent contamination, including wearing full-body suits and using gear sterilized with bleach and ultraviolet light. They collect water samples to analyze for environmental DNA (eDNA), which are trace genetic materials shed by organisms. Their analysis, using highly specific genetic markers for vertebrates, unexpectedly reveals a consistently strong signal for human DNA. Assuming the researchers' field and lab protocols were correctly followed and there was no direct human trespass, which of the following is the most plausible biological explanation for the presence of human DNA in the spring?\n\nA. The human-specific genetic markers used in the analysis are known to cross-react with the DNA of a common alpine amphibian, leading to a false positive.\n\nB. Wind currents transported human skin cells from a town located 100 kilometers away, which then settled and accumulated in the spring.\n\nC. The human DNA is ancient, having persisted in the spring's sediment from a time before the area was protected, and is slowly leaching into the water column.\n\nD. Migratory birds, such as gulls or waterfowl, forage on human waste at landfills or sewage treatment facilities and then visit the spring, depositing feces that contain human DNA and associated gut microbes.\n\nE. The high-altitude radiation has caused mutations in the DNA of local bacteria, coincidentally creating sequences that are identical to the human target markers.", "solution": "The central challenge is to identify a credible ecological pathway that can transport a significant amount of human genetic material into a remote and protected environment without direct human presence. We must evaluate each option based on established principles of ecology and molecular biology.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the scenario. The key pieces of information are: the location is pristine and remote, human access is restricted, contamination protocols are strict, and the human eDNA signal is \"consistently strong.\" This suggests an ongoing or recurring source rather than a single, isolated event.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nOption A suggests cross-reactivity of genetic markers. While primer and probe design is a critical step in molecular analysis, the markers used in modern eDNA studies, especially for species identification, are designed to be extremely specific. They target regions of the genome (often mitochondrial DNA) that are highly variable between species but conserved within a species. Significant cross-reactivity with a different vertebrate class like an amphibian to the point of producing a \"strong signal\" is highly improbable with well-designed assays. Therefore, this is an unlikely explanation.\n\nOption B proposes airborne transport of human skin cells. While it is true that DNA can be transported through the air (a field known as \"air-eDNA\"), the quantity of material that would travel 100 kilometers and be deposited into a single, small body of water like a spring is minuscule. Such a mechanism would be expected to produce a very weak, diffuse, and intermittent signal, not a \"consistently strong\" one. The dilution factor is simply too large.\n\nOption C posits that the DNA is ancient and leaching from sediments. While DNA can persist in cold, anoxic sediments for long periods, it degrades over time. For DNA from over 50 years ago to continuously leach into the water column in sufficient quantities to produce a strong, consistent signal today is not very plausible. The rate of leaching would likely be very low and decrease over time, contrary to the observation of a \"consistently strong\" signal.\n\nOption E claims that radiation-induced mutation in bacteria created human-like sequences. This is biologically infeasible. The probability of random mutations in a bacterial genome coincidentally recreating the exact, specific DNA sequence (typically 100-200 base pairs long) used as a target for human identification is practically zero. The genetic differences between bacteria and humans are vast, and convergent evolution at this specific, non-functional DNA sequence level is not a known phenomenon.\n\nOption D presents a very plausible mechanism involving a biological vector. Many bird species are highly mobile and connect distant ecosystems. Gulls, crows, and various waterfowl are known to frequent human-associated food sources like landfills and wastewater ponds. In these locations, they can ingest material containing human DNA (e.g., from discarded food, tissues, or in sewage). This material, including associated human gut bacteria, passes through their digestive system. When these birds travel to the remote spring to drink or rest, they defecate in or near the water. This act introduces a concentrated pulse of relatively fresh, undegraded human DNA into the ecosystem. This process can be regular and recurring as long as birds use both the human-altered and the natural sites, explaining a \"consistently strong\" signal. This phenomenon of animals acting as vectors for transporting genetic material between ecosystems is well-documented in molecular ecology.\n\nTherefore, the transport of human-derived waste by migratory birds is the most credible and scientifically supported explanation for the surprising discovery.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1865133"}]}
