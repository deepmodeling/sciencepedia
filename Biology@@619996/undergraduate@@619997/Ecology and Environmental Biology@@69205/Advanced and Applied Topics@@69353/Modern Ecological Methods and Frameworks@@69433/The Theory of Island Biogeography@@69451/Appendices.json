The equilibrium number of species, $S_{eq}$, is achieved on an island when the immigration rate equals the extinction rate, i.e., $I(S_{eq}) = E(S_{eq})$.\n\nThe ecologist has determined the following parameters for the region:\n- Mainland species pool: $P = 300$ species\n- Immigration coefficient: $C = 1.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ species} \\cdot \\text{km/year}$\n- Extinction coefficient: $K = 2.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ species} \\cdot \\text{km}^2\\text{/year}$\n\nThe island characteristics are:\n- Isola Grande has an area of $A_{IG} = 600 \\text{ km}^2$ and is located $D_{IG} = 200 \\text{ km}$ from the mainland.\n- Isola Piccola has an area of $A_{IP} = 150 \\text{ km}^2$.\n\nField surveys reveal a surprising finding that is contrary to the simple expectation that larger islands support more species.
