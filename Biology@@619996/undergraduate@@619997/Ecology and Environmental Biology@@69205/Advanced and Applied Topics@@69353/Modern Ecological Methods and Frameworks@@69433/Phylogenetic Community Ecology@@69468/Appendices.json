A complete survey reveals the presence of exactly four distinct amphibian species, which we will call species A, B, C, and D.

The resulting phylogeny, rooted and with branch lengths calibrated in millions of years (myr), has the following structure:\n\n1.  The phylogeny is rooted at a single common ancestor for all four species.\n2.  From the root, one branch leads directly to the lineage of species D. The length of this terminal branch is 39.2 myr.\n3.  Also from the root, another branch leads to a node representing the most recent common ancestor of species A, B, and C. The length of this internal branch is 22.8 myr.\n4.  From the (A, B, C) ancestral node, one branch leads directly to the lineage of species C. The length of this terminal branch is 16.4 myr.\n5.

This practice moves from measurement to interpretation, introducing the Net Relatedness Index (NRI) as a tool to test competing hypotheses of community assembly. By calculating and interpreting the NRI for two distinct hypothetical communities, you will learn how ecologists distinguish between the opposing forces of environmental filtering, which causes phylogenetic clustering, and limiting similarity, which causes phylogenetic overdispersion [@problem_id:1871983].", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the processes that structure plant communities in two different environments. Site Alpha has stressful, low-nutrient soil, while Site Beta has resource-rich, neutral soil. The ecologist hypothesizes that in the stressful environment of Site Alpha, community assembly will be dominated by habitat filtering (where only species with certain conserved traits can survive), leading to a community of closely related species. In the benign environment of Site Beta, she hypothesizes that competition will be the dominant force, leading to a community of distantly related species as close relatives outcompete each other.\n\nTo test this, she surveyed the species present at both sites from a regional pool of five species (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5). She also compiled a matrix of phylogenetic distances between all species pairs, with distances measured in millions of years (Mya) of evolutionary divergence.\n\nThe community compositions are:\n-   **Site Alpha Community**: {S1, S2, S3}\n-   **Site Beta Community**: {S1, S3, S5}\n\nThe phylogenetic distance matrix for the regional pool is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n  \\text{S1}  \\text{S2}  \\text{S3}  \\text{S4}  \\text{S5} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{S1}  0  20  25  80  90 \\\\\n\\text{S2}  20  0  5  85  95 \\\\\n\\text{S3}  25  5  0  88  98 \\\\\n\\text{S4}  80  85  88  0  10 \\\\\n\\text{S5}  90  95  98  10  0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTo quantify the phylogenetic structure, she uses the Net Relatedness Index (NRI), which is a standardized measure of the overall relatedness of species in a community. A positive NRI indicates that species are more closely related than expected by chance (phylogenetic clustering), suggesting habitat filtering. A negative NRI indicates that species are less related than expected by chance (phylogenetic overdispersion), suggesting competition.
