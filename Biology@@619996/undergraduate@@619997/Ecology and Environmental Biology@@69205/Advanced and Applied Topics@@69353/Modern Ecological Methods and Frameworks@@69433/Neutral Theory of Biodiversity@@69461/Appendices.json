Before exploring its mathematical predictions, it's crucial to understand what this 'functional equivalence' implies in the real world. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1866715] challenges you to act as a field ecologist and identify which observation would most strongly contradict this central tenet, honing your ability to distinguish patterns that arise from random chance versus those driven by deterministic niche differences.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a plant community in a one-hectare plot of a stable, old-growth temperate forest to test the predictions of the Neutral Theory of Biodiversity. The central assumption of this theory is functional equivalence, which posits that, at a per capita level, all individuals of all species within the same trophic level have identical probabilities of birth, death, and migration. Community composition changes primarily due to stochastic demographic events (ecological drift) rather than deterministic differences in species' competitive abilities or environmental adaptations.\n\nThe ecologist records several observations about the distribution and abundance of the plant species in the plot. Which of the following observations, if true, would provide the strongest evidence *against* the core assumption of functional equivalence?\n\nA. The relative abundance distribution of the different plant species fits a hollow curve, where a few species are highly abundant and most species are rare.\n\nB. After a localized landslide disturbed a small section of the plot, the first species to colonize the bare ground was the one that happened to be most abundant along the undisturbed edge.\n\nC. Individuals of Species X are predominantly found growing in waterlogged, low-lying areas of the plot, while individuals of Species Y are almost exclusively found on the well-drained, elevated slopes. Both species are present in similar overall numbers in the plot.\n\nD. A map of all individuals in the plot shows that individuals of most species, especially the rarer ones, are spatially clumped rather than randomly distributed.\n\nE. Over a ten-year census period, one of the rarest species in the plot, which initially had only five individuals, went locally extinct, while a common species increased its population size.", "solution": "Under the Neutral Theoryâ€™s core assumption of functional equivalence, all species at the same trophic level have identical per capita demographic rates: for each species $i$, the per capita birth rate $b_{i}$, death rate $d_{i}$, and migration rate $m_{i}$ satisfy $b_{i}=b$, $d_{i}=d$, and $m_{i}=m$, independent of species identity and, in the simplest formulations, independent of microhabitat. Community patterns then emerge from stochastic demographic events (ecological drift) and dispersal limitation rather than from deterministic differences among species.\n\nEvaluate each observation against this assumption:\n\nA. A hollow-curve relative abundance distribution (few common species, many rare) is a canonical prediction of neutral models (e.g., logseries-like patterns) and also arises under various other mechanisms. Its presence is therefore not evidence against functional equivalence.\n\nB. Following a small disturbance, the first colonist being the species most abundant at the nearby edge is consistent with neutral expectations via propagule pressure: if all species have identical per capita dispersal $m$, a species with more individuals near the boundary will, by chance, contribute more dispersers and thus is more likely to colonize first. This does not require species differences.\n\nC. Strong habitat segregation, where Species X is predominantly in waterlogged lowlands and Species Y almost exclusively on well-drained slopes, implies systematic, environment-dependent performance differences. Formally, this requires habitat-specific per capita rates $b_{i,h}$, $d_{i,h}$ such that, for some habitats $h$, $b_{X,h}-d_{X,h}$ differs from $b_{Y,h}-d_{Y,h}$ in a consistent way, i.e., $b_{X,h}, d_{X,h}$ are not equal to $b_{Y,h}, d_{Y,h}$. Such deterministic niche differentiation (environmental filtering) violates functional equivalence.\n\nD. Spatial clumping, especially of rare species, is expected under neutral dynamics with limited dispersal, where local recruitment leads to aggregated spatial patterns. Thus clumping is not evidence against neutrality.\n\nE. The local extinction of a very rare species and increase of a common species over a decade aligns with ecological drift: small populations are more prone to stochastic extinction, while common species may stochastically increase. This pattern does not require differences in per capita rates.\n\nTherefore, the observation that most strongly contradicts the assumption that all species are functionally equivalent is the consistent, niche-based habitat segregation described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1866715"}, {"introduction": "A key strength of the Neutral Theory is its ability to generate quantitative, testable predictions about biodiversity.

By deriving the 'effective population size' for a community with a seed bank, you will gain insight into how ecological memory alters the pace of random drift, showcasing the flexibility and power of neutral theory as an analytical tool.", "problem": "The neutral theory of biodiversity often models communities using a zero-sum assumption, where the total number of individuals is fixed. The death of one individual immediately creates a vacant slot for another. However, in many plant communities, the existence of a long-lived dormant seed bank complicates this picture. The seed bank acts as a \"memory\" of past community states, decoupling the population of reproducing individuals from the total gene pool.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a plant community with a constant number of $J$ sites available for mature, reproducing individuals. The community's evolution follows a discrete-generation Wright-Fisher process. In each generation, all $J$ individuals are replaced by a new set of $J$ individuals. A fraction $g$ of these new individuals are recruited from a massive, well-mixed dormant seed bank. The remaining fraction $(1-g)$ are offspring produced by the $J$ individuals of the parent generation.\n\nDue to the buffering effect of the seed bank, the rate of random genetic drift in the active population is reduced. This system can be modeled as an equivalent standard Wright-Fisher population (i.e., one without a seed bank) but with a different, larger effective population size, $J_e$. The effective population size $J_e$ is defined as the size of this idealized population that would experience the same rate of increase in homozygosity (or identity by descent) as the system with the seed bank.\n\nAssume that the seed bank is sufficiently large and old that the probability of two individuals drawn from it being identical by descent (IBD) is the same as the IBD probability within the active population of the previous generation.\n\nDerive an expression for the effective population size $J_e$ in terms of the active community size $J$ and the germination fraction $g$.", "solution": "Let $F_{t}$ denote the probability that two randomly sampled active individuals in generation $t$ are identical by descent (IBD), with no mutation.

In generation $t+1$, each of the $J$ new individuals is recruited from the seed bank with probability $g$ and from offspring of the $J$ active parents in generation $t$ with probability $(1-g)$. For two sampled individuals in generation $t+1$, the three possibilities and their IBD probabilities are:\n\n- Both are offspring (probability $(1-g)^{2}$): with probability $\\frac{1}{J}$ they share the same parent and thus are IBD; otherwise, with probability $1 - \\frac{1}{J}$ they have distinct parents and are IBD with probability $F_{t}$.
