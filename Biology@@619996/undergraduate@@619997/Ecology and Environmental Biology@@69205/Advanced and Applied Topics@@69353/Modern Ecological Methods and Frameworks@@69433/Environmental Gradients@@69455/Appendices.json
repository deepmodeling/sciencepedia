This exercise introduces a classic trade-off: a plant's investment in physical defenses against herbivores versus the metabolic cost of producing those defenses. By using a mathematical model to find the optimal defense level, $D^*(x)$, you will practice how ecologists formulate and solve problems in evolutionary ecology to predict adaptive traits. [@problem_id:1845620]", "problem": "A plant species grows along a transect extending away from a central waterhole in a savanna, which is a focal point for large herbivores. To survive, the plant can invest resources into producing physical defenses like thorns. A simple ecological model is proposed to understand the optimal investment in defense as a function of distance from the waterhole.\n\nLet $x$ be the distance from the waterhole in meters. Let $D$ be the plant's investment in defense, represented as a dimensionless value where $D=0$ means no defense and larger values indicate greater defense. The fitness of the plant, $W$, at a distance $x$ with a defense level $D$ is modeled as the net resource gain:\n$$W(D, x) = W_{max} - C(D) - L(D, x)$$\nwhere:\n- $W_{max}$ is a constant representing the maximum possible fitness in a predator-free, cost-free environment.\n- $C(D)$ is the metabolic cost of producing defenses. This cost is assumed to increase quadratically with investment, given by $C(D) = k_C D^2$, where $k_C$ is a positive cost coefficient.\n- $L(D, x)$ is the fitness loss due to herbivory. This loss depends on the local herbivory pressure, $H(x)$, and is linearly mitigated by the defense investment: $L(D, x) = H(x)(1 - D)$.\n- The herbivory pressure, $H(x)$, is highest at the waterhole and decays exponentially with distance: $H(x) = H_0 \\exp(-\\alpha x)$, where $H_0$ is the herbivory pressure at $x=0$ and $\\alpha$ is a positive spatial decay constant.\n\nAssuming that natural selection has resulted in the plant adopting an optimal defense level, $D^*(x)$, that maximizes its fitness $W(D, x)$ at any given location $x$, derive a symbolic expression for $D^*(x)$. Your expression should be a function of the distance $x$ and the parameters $H_0$, $k_C$, and $\\alpha$. You may assume that the parameters are such that the calculated $D^*$ remains in a physically plausible range for all relevant distances.", "solution": "We are asked to find the defense level $D^{*}(x)$ that maximizes fitness $W(D,x)$ at each distance $x$.

This food density at which it leaves is known as the Giving-Up Density (GUD).\n\nThe rovo-vole's instantaneous energy intake rate, $I(N)$, is directly proportional to the density of seeds, $N$ (in units of seeds/m$^2$), in the patch, such that $I(N) = \\alpha N$, where $\\alpha$ is a foraging efficiency constant. While foraging, the rovo-vole incurs two types of costs. First, a constant operational cost rate, $C_{op}$, for its basic functions.
