This exercise [@problem_id:1893984] provides a hands-on approach to understanding how scientists measure the ecological effects of common urban pollutants.", "problem": "An urban ecologist is studying the impact of winter road salt runoff on local ecosystems. A key concern is how increased soil salinity affects the germination of native plant seeds near roadways. To quantify this effect, a controlled laboratory experiment was conducted using seeds of a common roadside plant, the switchgrass (*Panicum virgatum*).\n\nIn the experiment, sets of 50 switchgrass seeds were placed in petri dishes on filter paper moistened with different concentrations of a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, which simulates the salt runoff. The dishes were kept under identical temperature and light conditions for 14 days. The number of seeds that successfully germinated in each dish was recorded. The experimental data is provided in the table below.\n\n| NaCl Concentration (mol/L) | Total Seeds | Germinated Seeds |\n| :------------------------- | :---------- | :--------------- |\n| 0.00 (Control)             | 50          | 48               |\n| 0.05                       | 50          | 42               |\n| 0.10                       | 50          | 30               |\n| 0.15                       | 50          | 18               |\n| 0.20                       | 50          | 5                |\n\nA common metric in ecotoxicology is the IC50, which is the inhibitory concentration that causes a 50% reduction in a biological response (in this case, germination) compared to the control group. Using the provided data, calculate the IC50 for NaCl on switchgrass seed germination. Assume a linear relationship for the inhibition effect between the tested concentration points.\n\nExpress your answer for the IC50 concentration in moles per liter (mol/L). Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the IC50, which is the concentration of NaCl that causes a 50% inhibition in seed germination compared to the control. We will solve this by following these steps:\n1.  Calculate the germination percentage for each NaCl concentration.\n2.  Calculate the percent inhibition of germination for each concentration relative to the control.\n3.  Use linear interpolation to find the concentration that corresponds to 50% inhibition.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the germination percentage**\n\nThe germination percentage is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{Germination \\%} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Germinated Seeds}}{\\text{Total Seeds}} \\right) \\times 100\n$$\n-   **Control (0.00 mol/L):** $\\left( \\frac{48}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 96\\%$\n-   **0.05 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{42}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 84\\%$\n-   **0.10 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{30}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 60\\%$\n-   **0.15 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{18}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 36\\%$\n-   **0.20 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{5}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\%$\n\nThe germination percentage of the control group, $G_{\\text{control}}$, is 96%.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the percent inhibition**\n\nThe percent inhibition for each treatment is calculated relative to the control group's germination rate:\n$$\n\\text{Inhibition \\%} = \\left( \\frac{G_{\\text{control}} - G_{\\text{treatment}}}{G_{\\text{control}}} \\right) \\times 100\n$$\n-   **0.00 mol/L:** This is the control, so inhibition is 0%.\n-   **0.05 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{96 - 84}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{12}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%$\n-   **0.10 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{96 - 60}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{36}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = 37.5\\%$\n-   **0.15 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{96 - 36}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{60}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = 62.5\\%$\n-   **0.20 mol/L:** $\\left( \\frac{96 - 10}{96} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{86}{96} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 89.6\\%$\n\n**Step 3: Use linear interpolation to find the IC50**\n\nThe IC50 is the concentration at which inhibition is 50%. Looking at our calculated inhibition percentages, the value of 50% falls between the inhibition at 0.10 mol/L (37.5%) and 0.15 mol/L (62.5%). We can use linear interpolation to find the exact concentration.\n\nLet $C$ be the concentration and $I$ be the percent inhibition. We have two points:\n-   Point 1: $(C_1, I_1) = (0.10, 37.5)$\n-   Point 2: $(C_2, I_2) = (0.15, 62.5)$\n\nWe want to find the concentration $C_{\\text{IC50}}$ where the inhibition $I$ is 50. The formula for linear interpolation for $C$ is:\n$$\nC = C_1 + (C_2 - C_1) \\times \\left( \\frac{I - I_1}{I_2 - I_1} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nC_{\\text{IC50}} = 0.10 + (0.15 - 0.10) \\times \\left( \\frac{50 - 37.5}{62.5 - 37.5} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{IC50}} = 0.10 + (0.05) \\times \\left( \\frac{12.5}{25} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{IC50}} = 0.10 + (0.05) \\times (0.5)\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{IC50}} = 0.10 + 0.025\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{IC50}} = 0.125 \\, \\text{mol/L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of 0.125 already has three significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the IC50 for NaCl on switchgrass germination is 0.125 mol/L.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.125}$$", "id": "1893984"}, {"introduction": "Beyond chemical changes, urbanization profoundly alters the physical structure of the environment, with soil compaction being a major concern in parks, lawns, and construction sites.
