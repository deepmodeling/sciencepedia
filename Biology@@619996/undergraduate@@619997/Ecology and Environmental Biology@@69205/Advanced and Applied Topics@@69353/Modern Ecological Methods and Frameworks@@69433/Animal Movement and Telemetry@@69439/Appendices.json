The study is set to last for a total of 30 days. The tag's battery has a limited capacity and can only record and store a maximum of 1000 GPS position fixes before it is depleted.\n\nThe researcher needs to program a duty cycle for the tag, which means setting different sampling frequencies for the bat's active and inactive periods. Based on prior observations, the bat is active for an average of 10 hours each night (the \"nighttime\" period) and inactive or roosting for the remaining 14 hours (the \"daytime\" period). To capture the important foraging behavior, the researcher desires to collect data much more intensively during the active period. They decide that the sampling frequency during the nighttime period (in fixes per hour) must be exactly six times the sampling frequency during the daytime period.\n\nAssuming the day/night lengths are constant over the 30-day study, calculate the specific sampling frequencies that must be programmed into the tag to exhaust the battery's 1000 fixes precisely at the end of the 30-day period.
