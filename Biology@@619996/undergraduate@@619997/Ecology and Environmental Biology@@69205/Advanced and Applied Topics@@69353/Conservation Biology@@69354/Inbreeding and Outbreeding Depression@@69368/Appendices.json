Modern genomics allows us to move beyond probability and directly measure the *realized* inbreeding within an individual's DNA by identifying long \"Runs of Homozygosity\" (ROH). This practice [@problem_id:1854405] challenges you to calculate the genomic inbreeding coefficient, $F_{ROH}$, and compare it with the pedigree-based expectation, $F_{ped}$, highlighting how cutting-edge tools provide a more precise assessment for managing the genetic health of endangered species.", "problem": "In conservation biology, managing the genetic health of small, isolated populations is critical. One major concern is inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can lead to inbreeding depression—a reduction in fitness due to the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. Traditionally, the level of inbreeding has been estimated using the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient, $F_{ped}$, which represents the probability that two alleles at a random locus in an individual are identical by descent. However, this method's accuracy depends on complete and error-free pedigree records, which are often unavailable for wild or long-term captive populations.\n\nModern genomic sequencing offers a direct measure of inbreeding by identifying \"Runs of Homozygosity\" (ROH), which are long, contiguous segments of the genome where an individual is homozygous. These segments arise when an individual inherits the same chromosomal segment from both parents, an event that is significantly more likely if the parents are related. The genomic inbreeding coefficient, $F_{ROH}$, is defined as the fraction of an individual's autosomal genome that is contained within such ROH.\n\nConsider a conservation program for a critically endangered species of mountain ungulate. The program has maintained pedigree records for several generations, but there is a suspicion of unrecorded mating events. Genomic analysis was performed on two individuals, Animal A and Animal B, both of which have a recorded pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient of $F_{ped} = 0.125$. The total length of the autosomal genome for this species is $L_{genome} = 2.50 \\times 10^9$ base pairs (bp).\n\nThe genomic data revealed the following:\n- Animal A has a total length of ROH of $L_{ROH, A} = 2.80 \\times 10^8$ bp.\n- Animal B has a total length of ROH of $L_{ROH, B} = 4.00 \\times 10^8$ bp.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the genomic inbreeding coefficient ($F_{ROH}$) for both animals and choose the most accurate conclusion from the options below.\n\nA. $F_{ROH, A} = 0.112$, $F_{ROH, B} = 0.160$. The pedigree for Animal A is likely inaccurate because its realized inbreeding is lower than expected from the pedigree.\n\nB. $F_{ROH, A} = 0.112$, $F_{ROH, B} = 0.160$. The pedigree for Animal B likely underestimates its true level of inbreeding, placing it at a higher risk of inbreeding depression than Animal A.\n\nC. $F_{ROH, A} = 0.160$, $F_{ROH, B} = 0.112$. The pedigree for Animal A likely underestimates its true level of inbreeding and it is at higher risk of inbreeding depression.\n\nD. $F_{ROH, A} = 0.112$, $F_{ROH, B} = 0.160$. Since both animals have the same pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient, their risk of inbreeding depression is identical, and the differences in the genomic data are solely due to random Mendelian segregation with no implications for management.\n\nE. $F_{ROH, A} = 0.896$, $F_{ROH, B} = 1.28$.

A powerful but complex strategy is \"genetic rescue,\" which involves introducing new genetic material to a population but risks causing outbreeding depression. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1854411] puts you in the role of a conservation strategist, tasking you with building a fitness model that balances the benefits of reducing inbreeding depression against the costs of outbreeding depression. By using optimization techniques, you will determine the ideal proportion of migrants, $m_{opt}$, that maximizes the population’s fitness, a classic challenge at the heart of conservation biology.", "problem": "A conservation biologist is developing a strategy for the genetic rescue of a small, isolated population of an endangered mammal. This target population suffers from significant residual inbreeding depression, a reduction in viability and reproduction due to high homozygosity. The proposed plan involves introducing individuals from a large, genetically diverse source population. However, this \"managed gene flow\" carries a risk of outbreeding depression, which can arise from two distinct mechanisms: the breakdown of locally adapted gene combinations (intrinsic depression) and the introduction of genes that are poorly suited to the local environment (extrinsic depression).\n\nTo find the right balance, the biologist models the mean population fitness in the first filial (F1) generation as a function of the proportion of migrants, $m$, introduced into the parental breeding pool. The model is based on the following assumptions, with a baseline fitness of 1 for a genetically optimal, locally adapted individual:\n\n1.  Mating within the augmented parental pool is random.\n2.  The resident population's fitness is lowered by a cost $C_I$ due to inbreeding depression. Offspring from a cross between two resident parents fully inherit this cost, having a fitness of $W_{RR} = 1 - C_I$.\n3.  The migrant individuals are from a population adapted to a different environment. Offspring from a cross between two migrant parents are not inbred but are poorly adapted to the local environment, incurring a fitness cost $O_{ext}$. Their fitness is $W_{MM} = 1 - O_{ext}$.\n4.  Offspring from a resident-migrant cross (F1 hybrids) benefit from \"hybrid vigor\" (heterosis), which completely masks the resident inbreeding depression. However, their fitness is penalized by intrinsic outbreeding depression (cost $O_{int}$) and by being partially maladapted to the local environment. As they carry half migrant genes, they incur half the extrinsic fitness cost. Their fitness is $W_{RM} = 1 - O_{int} - 0.5 O_{ext}$.\n\nBased on genetic analysis and field data, the biologist has estimated the fitness cost parameters as:\n-   Residual inbreeding depression cost, $C_I = 0.30$\n-   Intrinsic outbreeding depression cost, $O_{int} = 0.10$\n-   Extrinsic outbreeding depression cost, $O_{ext} = 0.30$\n\nCalculate the optimal proportion of migrants, $m_{opt}$, that should be introduced into the parental population to maximize the mean fitness of the subsequent generation.", "solution": "Let the fraction of residents in the parental pool be $1 - m$ and migrants be $m$.
