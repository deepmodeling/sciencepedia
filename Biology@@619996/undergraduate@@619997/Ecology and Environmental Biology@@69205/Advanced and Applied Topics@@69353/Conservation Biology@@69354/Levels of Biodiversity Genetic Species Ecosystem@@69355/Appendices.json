This practice explores a critical concept: inbreeding and the loss of genetic variation in small populations. By calculating the expected heterozygosity in a new population founded by related individuals, you will directly quantify the genetic risks associated with founding events, a common challenge in reintroduction programs for endangered species [@problem_id:1859543].", "problem": "Conservation biologists are planning to re-establish a population of the critically endangered Garnet-throated Sparrow on a remote, protected island. The source population is a large, captive flock that is assumed to be randomly mating and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all gene loci.\n\nFor a specific gene controlling throat coloration, there are two alleles: a dominant allele $R$ that produces a red throat, and a recessive allele $r$ that results in a grey throat. The frequency of the recessive allele $r$ in the large captive population is $q$.\n\nTo start the new island population, the conservation plan dictates that a single male-female pair will be chosen as founders. These two founders are not selected directly from the main captive flock, but are rather a brother and a sister, who are the offspring of a single mating pair that was randomly selected from the captive flock.\n\nAssuming this founding event proceeds as planned, what is the expected frequency of heterozygous ($Rr$) individuals in the first generation of offspring born on the island (i.e., the offspring of the brother-sister founding pair)? Express your answer as a function of $q$.", "solution": "This problem asks for the expected frequency of heterozygotes in the offspring of a brother-sister pair, where the original grandparents were randomly selected from a population in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Let's denote the generations as follows:\n- G0: The large, captive source population in HWE.\n- G1: The brother-sister founding pair. They are offspring of a randomly selected pair from G0.\n- G2: The first generation born on the island, who are the offspring of the G1 pair.\n\nWe want to find the expected heterozygosity in the G2 generation, let's call it $E[H_{G2}]$. A standard way to solve this is to use the concept of the inbreeding coefficient, $F$. The inbreeding coefficient of an individual is the probability that the two alleles at a given locus are identical by descent (IBD).\n\nThe heterozygosity $H$ of a population with inbreeding coefficient $F$ is related to the heterozygosity $H_0$ of the non-inbred base population by the formula:\n$$H = H_0(1-F)$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the heterozygosity of the base population, $H_0$. The G0 population is in HWE. The frequency of the allele $r$ is $q$. The frequency of the allele $R$, let's call it $p$, is therefore $p = 1-q$. In a population in HWE, the frequency of heterozygotes is given by $2pq$. So, the heterozygosity of our base population is:\n$$H_0 = 2pq = 2(1-q)q$$\n\nNext, we need to find the inbreeding coefficient, $F_{G2}$, for an individual in the G2 generation. An individual in G2 is an offspring of a full-sib mating (the G1 brother-sister pair). We need to calculate the probability that the two alleles in a G2 individual are IBD.\n\nLet the G1 brother be $S_1$ and the G1 sister be $S_2$. Their parents (the G0 pair) are the grandsire $P_S$ and granddam $P_D$. We assume $P_S$ and $P_D$ are randomly chosen from the large G0 population and are therefore unrelated and not inbred themselves.\n\nLet an individual $I$ from the G2 generation receive an allele $a_1$ from its sire $S_1$ and an allele $a_2$ from its dam $S_2$. The coefficient of inbreeding $F_{G2} = F_I$ is the probability that $a_1$ and $a_2$ are IBD. For $a_1$ and $a_2$ to be IBD, they must both be copies of the same allele from one of the grandparents, $P_S$ or $P_D$.\n\nLet's trace the path of the alleles.\nThe probability that the allele $a_1$ (passed from $S_1$ to $I$) came from the grandsire $P_S$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability that the allele $a_2$ (passed from $S_2$ to $I$) came from the grandsire $P_S$ is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, the probability that both alleles descend from the grandsire $P_S$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nGiven that both alleles came from the grandsire $P_S$, we need the probability that they are copies of the *same* grandparental allele. Since the grandsire $P_S$ is not inbred, his two alleles are not IBD. The probability of picking the same allele twice from him is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So, the probability that the two alleles in individual $I$ are IBD via the grandsire $P_S$ is $(\\frac{1}{4}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nBy the same logic, the probability that the two alleles are IBD via the granddam $P_D$ is also $(\\frac{1}{4}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nThe total inbreeding coefficient $F_I$ is the sum of these mutually exclusive probabilities:\n$$F_{G2} = F_I = \\frac{1}{8} (\\text{from } P_S) + \\frac{1}{8} (\\text{from } P_D) = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThis is the standard inbreeding coefficient for an offspring of a full-sib mating from non-inbred parents.\n\nNow we can calculate the expected heterozygosity in the G2 generation using the formula $E[H_{G2}] = H_0 (1-F_{G2})$.\n$$E[H_{G2}] = (2pq) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\n$$E[H_{G2}] = (2pq) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$$\n$$E[H_{G2}] = \\frac{3}{2}pq$$\n\nFinally, we substitute $p = 1-q$ to express the answer solely in terms of $q$:\n$$E[H_{G2}] = \\frac{3}{2}(1-q)q$$\nThis is the expected frequency of heterozygous individuals in the first generation born on the island.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}q(1-q)}$$", "id": "1859543"}, {"introduction": "The health of an ecological community depends not just on how many species are present (richness), but also on how individuals are distributed among those species (evenness).

This community consists of several native wildflower species, and the individuals are distributed relatively equitably among these species. An ecologist studying the meadow notes this high degree of balance. Subsequently, a non-native, highly competitive invasive plant species is accidentally introduced. This invasive plant has no natural predators in the ecosystem and spreads aggressively. After several growing seasons, the invasive species has become the numerically dominant plant, constituting the vast majority of the plant biomass and individual count, while the native wildflower species, though still present, have been significantly reduced to small, sparse populations.\n\nBased on this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the change in the species evenness of the plant community from its initial state to the state after the invasion?\n\nA.

The concept of species evenness does not apply, as a new species has been introduced.", "solution": "We identify the relevant ecological diversity concepts and apply them step by step.\n\n1) Define species richness and evenness.\n- Species richness, denoted $R$, is the number of species present.\n- Species evenness quantifies how equally individuals are distributed among species. A common formalization uses the Shannon index $H'$ and Pielou’s evenness $J$:\n$$\nH'=-\\sum_{i=1}^{R} p_{i}\\ln(p_{i}), \\quad J=\\frac{H'}{\\ln(R)},\n$$\nwhere $p_{i}$ is the relative abundance of species $i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{R} p_{i}=1$.\n\n2) Analyze the initial state.\n- The problem states the native wildflower individuals are distributed relatively equitably among several species. This corresponds to $p_{i}\\approx \\frac{1}{R}$ for all $i$.\n- Under perfect equality, $p_{i}=\\frac{1}{R}$, which gives\n$$\nH'=-\\sum_{i=1}^{R} \\frac{1}{R}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)= -\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)=\\ln(R),\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\nJ=\\frac{H'}{\\ln(R)}=\\frac{\\ln(R)}{\\ln(R)}=1,\n$$\ni.e., maximum evenness. With “relatively equitable” distributions, $J$ is close to, though not necessarily equal to, $1$.\n\n3) Analyze the post-invasion state.\n- After the invasion, one species becomes overwhelmingly dominant: suppose $p_{\\text{inv}}$ is close to $1$, and the remaining $p_{i}$ for natives are small and sum to a small remainder.\n- As one $p_{i}$ approaches $1$ and the rest approach $0$, $H'$ decreases substantially because the distribution becomes highly uneven.

Moreover, richness in this scenario likely does not decrease because an additional species has been introduced and native species remain present (though reduced).\n- D is incorrect: even if productivity changes, increased primary productivity does not imply increased evenness; the observed dominance lowers evenness.\n- E is incorrect: evenness applies regardless of species introductions.\n\nTherefore, species evenness decreases due to the invasive species becoming overwhelmingly dominant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1859553"}, {"introduction": "The different levels of biodiversity—genetic, species, and ecosystem—are deeply interconnected. This capstone problem demonstrates how genetic health within a single keystone species can determine the fate of an entire community. You will use allele frequency data to assess the genetic resilience of a keystone predator population and predict which ecosystem is most vulnerable to collapse, thereby linking genetic diversity directly to species diversity and ecosystem stability [@problem_id:1859558].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying three isolated rocky intertidal communities, designated Zone Alpha, Zone Beta, and Zone Gamma. Each community's structure is heavily influenced by the keystone predator, the starfish *Pisaster ochraceus*, which preys on the competitively dominant mussel, *Mytilus californianus*. By controlling the mussel population, the starfish prevents competitive exclusion and maintains high species diversity. Before any disturbance, the Shannon diversity index ($H'$) for the sessile invertebrate communities in the three zones was measured to be similar: $H'_{\\text{Alpha}} = 2.45$, $H'_{\\text{Beta}} = 2.42$, and $H'_{\\text{Gamma}} = 2.48$.\n\nThe ecologist is concerned about the potential impact of a novel viral pathogen that causes Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD). The susceptibility of a starfish to this pathogen is known to be strongly influenced by its genotype at a single, highly polymorphic immune-related gene locus. To assess the potential resilience of each starfish population, samples were collected and the allele frequencies at this specific locus were determined for each zone. The data are presented below:\n\n| Allele | Frequency in Zone Alpha | Frequency in Zone Beta | Frequency in Zone Gamma |\n|:------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n|   R1   |          0.35           |          0.70          |          0.96           |\n|   R2   |          0.30           |          0.15          |          0.02           |\n|   R3   |          0.20           |          0.10          |          0.01           |\n|   R4   |          0.15           |          0.05          |          0.01           |\n\nAssuming the novel pathogen is equally virulent in all three zones and its impact is most severe in genetically uniform host populations, which zone's invertebrate community is most likely to experience the largest *decrease* in its Shannon diversity index ($H'$) following the pathogen outbreak?\n\nA. Zone Alpha\n\nB. Zone Beta\n\nC. Zone Gamma\n\nD. All three zones will experience a quantitatively similar decrease in $H'$.\n\nE. It is impossible to predict the outcome without information on which specific allele confers resistance to the pathogen.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict which of the three intertidal zones will experience the largest drop in species diversity (as measured by the Shannon index, $H'$) following a pathogen outbreak that affects the keystone predator, the starfish *Pisaster ochraceus*.\n\nThe core principle connecting the provided data to the ecological outcome is the relationship between different levels of biodiversity: genetic diversity within a species, species diversity within a community, and the resulting ecosystem stability.\n\nStep 1: Understand the ecological scenario.\nThe starfish *Pisaster ochraceus* is a keystone species. Its presence prevents the dominant competitor, the mussel *Mytilus californianus*, from monopolizing space and resources. If the starfish population declines significantly, the mussels will proliferate, outcompeting other sessile invertebrates like barnacles, anemones, and algae. This process, known as competitive exclusion, will lead to a sharp decrease in species richness and evenness, which in turn causes a large drop in the Shannon diversity index ($H'$).\n\nStep 2: Relate the threat to the keystone species' genetics.\nThe threat is a novel pathogen. The problem states that susceptibility is linked to the genotype at a specific immune-related locus and that the impact is most severe in genetically uniform populations. This implies that a starfish population with higher genetic diversity at this locus has a higher probability that some individuals will possess genotypes that confer partial or full resistance, allowing the population to better withstand the epidemic. Conversely, a population with low genetic diversity is more uniformly susceptible, making a catastrophic population crash more likely.\n\nStep 3: Quantify the genetic diversity of the starfish population in each zone.\nWe can use the provided allele frequencies to calculate a measure of genetic diversity for each zone. A standard metric for this is the expected heterozygosity ($H_e$), also known as gene diversity. It represents the probability that two randomly selected alleles from the population are different. It is calculated using the formula:\n$$H_e = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of alleles and $p_i$ is the frequency of the $i$-th allele. A higher value of $H_e$ indicates greater genetic diversity.\n\nLet's calculate $H_e$ for each zone:\n\nFor Zone Alpha:\nThe allele frequencies are $p_1=0.35$, $p_2=0.30$, $p_3=0.20$, and $p_4=0.15$.\n$$ \\sum p_i^2 = (0.35)^2 + (0.30)^2 + (0.20)^2 + (0.15)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum p_i^2 = 0.1225 + 0.0900 + 0.0400 + 0.0225 = 0.2750 $$\n$$ H_{e, \\text{Alpha}} = 1 - 0.2750 = 0.7250 $$\n\nFor Zone Beta:\nThe allele frequencies are $p_1=0.70$, $p_2=0.15$, $p_3=0.10$, and $p_4=0.05$.\n$$ \\sum p_i^2 = (0.70)^2 + (0.15)^2 + (0.10)^2 + (0.05)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum p_i^2 = 0.4900 + 0.0225 + 0.0100 + 0.0025 = 0.5250 $$\n$$ H_{e, \\text{Beta}} = 1 - 0.5250 = 0.4750 $$\n\nFor Zone Gamma:\nThe allele frequencies are $p_1=0.96$, $p_2=0.02$, $p_3=0.01$, and $p_4=0.01$.\n$$ \\sum p_i^2 = (0.96)^2 + (0.02)^2 + (0.01)^2 + (0.01)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum p_i^2 = 0.9216 + 0.0004 + 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.9222 $$\n$$ H_{e, \\text{Gamma}} = 1 - 0.9222 = 0.0778 $$\n\nStep 4: Interpret the results and make a prediction.\nComparing the calculated expected heterozygosities:\n$$ H_{e, \\text{Alpha}} (0.7250) > H_{e, \\text{Beta}} (0.4750) > H_{e, \\text{Gamma}} (0.0778) $$\nZone Gamma has the lowest genetic diversity at the immune-related locus. The population is dominated by a single allele (R1 at 96%). This lack of variation makes the starfish population in Zone Gamma the most vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse from the novel pathogen.\n\nStep 5: Link the starfish collapse to the Shannon diversity index.\nA massive die-off of the keystone predator in Zone Gamma would lead to the most severe trophic cascade. The mussel population would be released from predation pressure and would outcompete other species, leading to a drastic reduction in overall species diversity. Since the initial Shannon indices ($H'$) were all similar, the zone that experiences the most severe ecological collapse will also experience the largest decrease in its $H'$ value.\n\nTherefore, Zone Gamma is the community most likely to experience the largest decrease in its Shannon diversity index. Option E is incorrect because for a *novel* pathogen, the overall genetic \"portfolio\" (diversity) is more predictive of resilience than the presence of a single, pre-selected resistance allele.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1859558"}]}
