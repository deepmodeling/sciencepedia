They possess a strong immune system, rendering them completely immune to a specific endemic parasite. In the absence of any external pressures (i.e., no harvesting or disease), the Robust subpopulation has an intrinsic per-capita growth rate of $r_R$.\n\nThe Vulnerable phenotype consists of smaller fish that are not targeted by the fishery.
