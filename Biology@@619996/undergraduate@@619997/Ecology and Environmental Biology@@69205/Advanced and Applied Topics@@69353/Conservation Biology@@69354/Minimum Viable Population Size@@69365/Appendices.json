The concept of Effective Population Size ($N_e$) provides a more accurate measure by considering only the individuals that successfully contribute to the gene pool of the next generation. This first exercise [@problem_id:1947207] provides a fundamental hands-on calculation of $N_e$ in a realistic scenario where breeding participation is unequal, revealing how social structure can significantly reduce a population's genetic size.", "id": "1947207", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying an isolated population of a recently discovered species of deep-sea anglerfish, *Cryptospectrus luminosus*. The total observed population, or census size ($N_c$), is counted to be 120 individuals. In this species, mating is highly selective due to intense competition among males. Over a full breeding season, the research team's underwater drones observe that only 8 males successfully mate with the females. In contrast, 62 females in the population are found to carry fertilized eggs, indicating they have successfully reproduced. The remaining individuals in the population do not participate in breeding during this season.\n\nThe genetic health and susceptibility of a population to phenomena like genetic drift are more accurately reflected by its Effective Population Size ($N_e$) than by its simple census size.
