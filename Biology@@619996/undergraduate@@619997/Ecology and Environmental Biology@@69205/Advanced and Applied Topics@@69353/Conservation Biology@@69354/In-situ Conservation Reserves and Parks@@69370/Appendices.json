This practice explores the critical concept of \"edge effects,\" where the boundary of a reserve is more vulnerable to external pressures like invasive species and human disturbance.

The area unaffected by these edge effects is known as the \"core habitat,\" which is crucial for the survival of sensitive interior species.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the core habitat area of the square-shaped reserve to the core habitat area of the rectangular riparian reserve.
