{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Population Viability Analysis often begins with a close look at a population's genetic health. While the total number of individuals (census size) is a useful starting point, the effective population size ($N_e$) provides a more accurate measure of how quickly a population will lose genetic diversity. This first exercise [@problem_id:2309247] demonstrates how to calculate $N_e$ in a common scenario where the number of breeding males and females is unequal, a factor that can significantly accelerate genetic drift and inbreeding.", "problem": "A conservation team has established a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Quokka, a small wallaby-like marsupial. The founding population, which is the entire group available for breeding in the first generation, consists of a total of 150 individuals. However, the sex ratio is heavily skewed, with only 25 breeding males (boomers) and 125 breeding females (jills). A key metric for assessing the genetic health and risk of inbreeding in such a population is the effective population size, denoted as $N_e$. This value represents the size of an idealized population that would experience the same magnitude of genetic drift as the actual population. Given the number of breeding males and females, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this founding group. Report your answer as a number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "For a dioecious species with unequal numbers of breeding males and females, the inbreeding effective population size is given by\n$$\nN_{e}=\\frac{4N_{m}N_{f}}{N_{m}+N_{f}},\n$$\nwhere $N_{m}$ is the number of breeding males and $N_{f}$ is the number of breeding females.\n\nGiven $N_{m}=25$ and $N_{f}=125$, substitute into the formula:\n$$\nN_{e}=\\frac{4\\times 25\\times 125}{25+125}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nN_{e}=\\frac{4\\times 3125}{150}=\\frac{12500}{150}.\n$$\nPerform the division:\n$$\nN_{e}=83.\\overline{3}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $83.3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{83.3}$$", "id": "2309247"}, {"introduction": "Beyond genetics, small populations are highly vulnerable to random chance in individual survival and reproduction, a phenomenon known as demographic stochasticity. Even if the average birth and death rates are favorable, a string of bad luck—like an entire generation of offspring being the same sex—can have catastrophic consequences. This practice problem [@problem_id:1874430] provides a stark, intuitive example of this risk, calculating the probability of an extremely skewed sex ratio in a small founding population.", "problem": "A conservation team has successfully established a new, isolated population of the critically endangered Azure Warbler on a protected island. The founding population consists of exactly six breeding pairs. From extensive studies on the mainland population, it is known that each breeding pair that successfully nests will raise exactly two offspring to the fledgling stage in a given breeding season. We will assume all six pairs successfully nest in the first season. The sex of each individual offspring is determined independently and is equally likely to be male or female.\n\nThe long-term viability of this new population is of great concern. One of the immediate risks is demographic stochasticity, particularly an unfavorable sex ratio in the first generation of offspring. Calculate the probability that all offspring produced by these six pairs in the first breeding season are male. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Each of the six breeding pairs produces exactly two offspring, giving a total number of offspring\n$$N=6\\times 2=12.$$\nThe sex of each offspring is determined independently with probability\n$$P(\\text{male})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{female})=\\frac{1}{2}.$$\nThe event that all offspring are male is the intersection of $12$ independent events, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.

The result is not a single certain outcome, but a set of probabilities that guide conservation management. This final exercise [@problem_id:2309206] puts you in the role of a conservation biologist, tasked with interpreting the output from a PVA simulation to estimate the quasi-extinction risk, a critical metric for deciding the urgency and type of conservation intervention required.", "problem": "Conservation biologists are studying the critically endangered Highland Cloud Vole, a small mammal found only in a single isolated mountain range. To assess its long-term survival prospects, they performed a Population Viability Analysis (PVA). The PVA utilized a computer model to run 100 independent simulations, each projecting the vole population's size over a 200-year period, starting from the current population size. A key metric for this species is the quasi-extinction threshold, defined as a population size dropping below 50 individuals, a point from which recovery is considered highly unlikely.\n\nAfter running the simulations, the results were categorized as follows:\n- In 17 of the simulations, the population went completely extinct (dropped to 0 individuals) before the end of the 200-year period.\n- In 26 of the simulations, the population fell below the quasi-extinction threshold of 50 individuals at some point but did not go extinct by the end of the 200-year period.\n- In the remaining simulations, the population size consistently remained at or above 50 individuals for the entire 200-year duration.\n\nBased on these simulation results, what is the estimated probability that a Highland Cloud Vole population will fall below the quasi-extinction threshold of 50 individuals at any point within the next 200 years?

Let $A$ be the event that the population falls below the quasi-extinction threshold of $50$ individuals at any point within $200$ years.\n\nBy the problem statement:\n- In $17$ simulations, the population went extinct, which implies event $A$ occurred in those simulations.\n- In $26$ simulations, the population fell below $50$ but did not go extinct, so event $A$ also occurred.\n- The remaining $100 - 17 - 26 = 57$ simulations did not experience event $A$.\n\nTherefore, the number of simulations in which $A$ occurred is $17 + 26 = 43$.
