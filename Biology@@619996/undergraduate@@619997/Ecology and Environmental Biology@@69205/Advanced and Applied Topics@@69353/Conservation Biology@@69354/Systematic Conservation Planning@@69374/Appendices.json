Start with an empty set of protected islands.\n2.  At each step, calculate the \"benefit\" of adding each unprotected island. The benefit is the sum of new individuals it would protect, counted only for species whose conservation targets are not yet met. More formally, the benefit of adding island `i` is the sum over all species `j` of `min(P_ij, R_j)`, where `P_ij` is the population of species `j` on island `i`, and `R_j` is the remaining population needed to meet the target for species `j`.\n3.  Add the island with the highest benefit to the reserve.\n4.  Repeat until all conservation targets are met.\n5.  In case of a tie in benefit, select the island with the lower index number (e.g., I1 over I2).\n\n**Strategy 2: The Core Area Ranking Algorithm (inspired by Zonation)**\nThis algorithm works by first creating a priority ranking of all islands from most to least important, and then selecting the top-ranked islands until all targets are met.\n1.  The ranking is generated by a process of simulated removal. Starting with all five islands, iteratively identify and log the \"least important\" island for removal.\n2.  An island's importance is its irreplaceability. The least important island is the one whose removal would cause the smallest maximum proportional loss to any species' total population currently in the set. Formally, for each island `i` in the current set, calculate its irreplaceability score `V_i = max_j (P_ij / S_j)`, where `P_ij` is the population of species `j` on island `i`, and `S_j` is the total population of species `j` across all islands *currently in the set*.\n3.  The island with the *minimum* `V_i` score is deemed the least important, logged, and removed from the set for the next iteration. This process is repeated until all islands are ranked.\n4.  In case of a tie for the minimum `V_i`, the island with the lower index number is deemed less important and is removed first.\n5.  The final reserve is the smallest set of islands from the top of this importance ranking (i.e., the last islands to be removed) that collectively meets all conservation targets.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the number of islands required by the Greedy Addition algorithm to the number of islands required by the Core Area Ranking algorithm.
