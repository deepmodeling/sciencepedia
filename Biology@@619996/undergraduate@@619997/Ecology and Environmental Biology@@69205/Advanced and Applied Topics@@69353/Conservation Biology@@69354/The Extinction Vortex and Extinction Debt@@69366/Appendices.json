The primary concern for conservation managers is the long-term genetic health of these populations, as small populations are vulnerable to the detrimental effects of genetic drift, a key driver of the extinction vortex.\n\nA population's vulnerability to genetic drift is quantified by its effective population size, denoted as $N_e$. A smaller $N_e$ indicates a higher susceptibility to the loss of genetic variation. For a population with $N_m$ breeding males and $N_f$ breeding females, the effective population size can be calculated using the formula:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\n\nThe two lizard populations are characterized as follows:\n\n- **Population A:** The population has an equal number of breeding males and breeding females.\n- **Population B:** The population's breeding structure is highly skewed.

Two mutually exclusive development plans, Plan A and Plan B, are proposed for a region. Both plans preserve a total of $N$ identical, isolated patches of the beetle's natural habitat, but differ in the spacing between these patches.\n\nTo quantify the risk, the biologist uses a simplified metapopulation model. In this model, the ecosystem is considered at equilibrium. The long-term survival in a patch is determined by a balance between local extinction and colonization from neighboring patches.\n\nThe model is defined by the following principles:\n1.  The local extinction rate, $E$, for a single patch of area $A$ is given by $E = \\frac{\\mu}{A}$, where $\\mu$ is an extinction coefficient that depends on the species' intrinsic vulnerability.\n2.  The colonization rate, $C$, for an empty patch is a function of its distance $d$ from other occupied patches.
