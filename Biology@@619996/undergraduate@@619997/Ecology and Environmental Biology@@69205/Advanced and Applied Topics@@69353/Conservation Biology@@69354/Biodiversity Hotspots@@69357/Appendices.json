This first practice exercise challenges you to use the two foundational criteria—a high number of endemic species and a significant degree of habitat loss—to determine if a hypothetical region qualifies for this critical conservation status. Mastering this initial calculation is the first step toward appreciating the data-driven approach used in global conservation planning. [@problem_id:1832279]", "problem": "To be classified as a global biodiversity hotspot, a region must meet two strict criteria. First, it must contain a high level of species endemism, defined as having at least 1,500 species of vascular plants that are found nowhere else on Earth. Second, it must be under a significant degree of threat, defined as having lost at least 70% of its original primary vegetation.\n\nConsider the fictional island of Serenova, which was historically covered entirely by a unique cloud forest ecosystem. This forest originally spanned an area of 50,000 square kilometers. Botanical surveys have cataloged 1,620 species of vascular plants endemic to Serenova. However, due to extensive logging and conversion to agriculture over the last century, only 12,000 square kilometers of the original cloud forest remain.\n\nBased on the internationally recognized criteria provided, does the island of Serenova qualify as a biodiversity hotspot?\n\nA. Yes, it qualifies because it meets both the endemism and the habitat loss criteria.\n\nB. No, it does not qualify because while it meets the endemism criterion, it fails to meet the habitat loss criterion.\n\nC. No, it does not qualify because while it meets the habitat loss criterion, it fails to meet the endemism criterion.\n\nD. No, it does not qualify because it meets neither the endemism nor the habitat loss criterion.", "solution": "We apply the hotspot criteria as stated: a region must satisfy both (i) high endemism, defined as at least 1,500 endemic vascular plant species, and (ii) significant threat, defined as loss of at least 0.70 of its original primary vegetation.\n\nStep 1 (Endemism criterion):\nGiven endemic vascular plant species count is $1{,}620$. Since $1{,}620 \\geq 1{,}500$, the endemism criterion is satisfied.\n\nStep 2 (Habitat loss criterion):\nOriginal cloud forest area $A_{\\text{orig}} = 50{,}000$ square kilometers.\nRemaining area $A_{\\text{rem}} = 12{,}000$ square kilometers.\nArea lost is\n$$\nA_{\\text{lost}} = A_{\\text{orig}} - A_{\\text{rem}} = 50{,}000 - 12{,}000 = 38{,}000.\n$$\nThe fraction of original vegetation lost is\n$$\nf_{\\text{lost}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{lost}}}{A_{\\text{orig}}} = \\frac{38{,}000}{50{,}000} = 0.76.\n$$\nSince $0.76 \\geq 0.70$, the habitat loss criterion is satisfied.\n\nConclusion:\nSerenova meets both criteria; therefore it qualifies as a biodiversity hotspot.

This advanced practice moves beyond the initial designation to the practical task of prioritizing conservation efforts using a quantitative framework.

The foundation's scientific advisory board has developed a quantitative method to rank the candidates by calculating a Conservation Priority Index (CPI). The CPI is a weighted average of three normalized metrics: Endemic Species Richness (ESR), Climate Vulnerability Score (CVS), and Governance Effectiveness Index (GEI).\n\nThe three candidate hotspots are:\n1.  **The Azure Archipelago (Hotspot A)**\n2.  **The Boreal Zenith Forests (Hotspot B)**\n3.  **The Crimson Canyons (Hotspot C)**\n\nThe raw data for each hotspot is provided below:\n- **Endemic Species Richness (ESR)**: The total number of endemic species recorded. A higher number is more desirable for conservation.\n    - Hotspot A: 850 species\n    - Hotspot B: 1200 species\n    - Hotspot C: 400 species\n- **Climate Vulnerability Score (CVS)**: An integer score from 1 (very low vulnerability) to 10 (extremely high vulnerability) based on projected climate change impacts. A lower score is more desirable.\n    - Hotspot A: 8\n    - Hotspot B: 3\n    - Hotspot C: 5\n- **Governance Effectiveness Index (GEI)**: A composite score from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (highly effective) that measures the stability and capacity of local and national institutions to implement conservation projects. A higher score is more desirable.\n    - Hotspot A: 40\n    - Hotspot B: 85\n    - Hotspot C: 70\n\nTo calculate the CPI, you must first normalize the score for each metric (ESR, CVS, GEI) to a value between 0 and 1.\n- For metrics where a **higher** value is better (ESR, GEI), use the formula: $S_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{raw}} - S_{\\text{min}}}{S_{\\text{max}} - S_{\\text{min}}}$.\n- For metrics where a **lower** value is better (CVS), use the inverted formula: $S_{\\text{norm}} = 1 - \\frac{S_{\\text{raw}} - S_{\\text{min}}}{S_{\\text{max}} - S_{\\text{min}}}$.\nIn these formulas, $S_{\\text{raw}}$ is the raw score for a given hotspot, and $S_{\\text{min}}$ and $S_{\\text{max}}$ are the minimum and maximum raw scores observed across the three candidate hotspots for that specific metric.\n\nThe final CPI for each hotspot is calculated using the following weighted sum of the normalized scores:\n$CPI = (0.50 \\times S_{\\text{norm, ESR}}) + (0.30 \\times S_{\\text{norm, CVS}}) + (0.20 \\times S_{\\text{norm, GEI}})$\n\nBased on your calculations, determine the final priority ranking of the three hotspots, from highest CPI to lowest CPI.\n\nA.
