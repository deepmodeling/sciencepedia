It is crucial for conservation managers to quantify the genetic consequences of such matings. This exercise [@problem_id:1479182] walks you through calculating the inbreeding coefficient ($F$), a fundamental measure of the probability that two alleles in an individual are identical by descent, using a simple pedigree from a hypothetical captive breeding program.", "problem": "A conservation breeding program for the endangered gray wolf is established at a zoological park. The founding population consists of a single breeding pair: a male named 'Lobo' and a female named 'Luna'. These two founders were captured from two geographically distant and large wild populations, and it can be safely assumed that they are unrelated and not inbred.\n\nLobo and Luna produce a litter of offspring. To rapidly increase the captive population, the program managers decide to mate two of these offspring, who are full siblings, with each other. This mating produces a single pup named 'Fenrir'.\n\nCalculate the inbreeding coefficient ($F$) of the pup, Fenrir. Express your answer as a single fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "The inbreeding coefficient $F$ of an individual is defined as the probability that its two alleles at a locus are identical by descent. A fundamental relationship is that the inbreeding coefficient of an offspring equals the kinship (coancestry) coefficient between its parents:\n$$\nF_{\\text{offspring}} = f_{\\text{parents}}.\n$$\nThe kinship coefficient between two individuals $X$ and $Y$ can be computed using the path method (Malecot’s formula):\n$$\nf_{XY} = \\sum_{A} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n_{1} + n_{2} + 1} \\left(1 + F_{A}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all common ancestors $A$ of $X$ and $Y$, and $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the number of meioses from $A$ to $X$ and from $A$ to $Y$ along a non-overlapping path, respectively. Here, Lobo and Luna are unrelated, non-inbred founders, so $F_{\\text{Lobo}} = 0$ and $F_{\\text{Luna}} = 0$.\n\nFenrir’s parents are full siblings, both offspring of Lobo and Luna. The common ancestors of the two parents are exactly Lobo and Luna. For each of these ancestors, the path lengths are $n_{1} = 1$ and $n_{2} = 1$. Therefore, the kinship between the parents (full siblings) is\n$$\nf_{\\text{full sibs}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+1+1} \\left(1 + F_{\\text{Lobo}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+1+1} \\left(1 + F_{\\text{Luna}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\nF_{\\text{Fenrir}} = f_{\\text{parents}} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThis fraction is already in simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1479182"}, {"introduction": "While the census size of a population ($N_c$) is a simple headcount, the rate of genetic drift and loss of diversity is governed by the *effective* population size ($N_e$), which is often much smaller. This discrepancy is a critical concept in managing the genetic health of threatened species. In this practice [@problem_id:1479190], you will learn how to calculate $N_e$ when the number of breeding males and females is unequal—a common scenario in both wild and captive populations—and see firsthand how demographics can impact genetic viability.", "problem": "A conservation team has established a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly, a species recently decimated by a fungal pathogen. The founding population of this program consists of 45 breeding adults. Genetic screening reveals that this group is composed of only 5 sexually mature males, with the remainder being sexually mature females.\n\nThe effective population size ($N_e$) is a crucial metric in conservation genetics, representing the size of a theoretical, idealized population that would experience the same amount of random genetic drift as the actual population under study. Given the unequal sex ratio in the Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly breeding program, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this founding group. Report your answer rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for a population with an unequal number of breeding males and females.\n\nFirst, we identify the given information from the problem statement:\nThe total number of breeding individuals is $N_{total} = 45$.\nThe number of breeding males is $N_m = 5$.\n\nNext, we must determine the number of breeding females, $N_f$. Since the total population consists of only males and females, we can find $N_f$ by subtracting the number of males from the total population:\n$N_f = N_{total} - N_m$\n$N_f = 45 - 5 = 40$\nSo, there are 40 breeding females.\n\nThe formula for calculating the effective population size ($N_e$) when there is an unequal sex ratio of breeding individuals is:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $N_m$ and $N_f$ into this formula:\n$N_m = 5$\n$N_f = 40$\n\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 40}{5 + 40}$$\n\nWe perform the arithmetic in the numerator and the denominator:\nNumerator: $4 \\times 5 \\times 40 = 20 \\times 40 = 800$\nDenominator: $5 + 40 = 45$\n\nSo, the expression for $N_e$ becomes:\n$$N_e = \\frac{800}{45}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$N_e = 17.777...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 1, 7, and 7. The fourth digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$N_e \\approx 17.8$$\n\nThus, the effective population size of the founding colony is approximately 17.8. This value is significantly lower than the census size of 45, highlighting the strong effect of an unequal sex ratio on genetic drift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.8}$$", "id": "1479190"}, {"introduction": "Wild populations rarely maintain a constant size; they often fluctuate dramatically over time due to environmental factors.

For three consecutive years of the cycle, environmental conditions are favorable, and the census population size is stable at 500 individuals. However, the fourth year of the cycle is marked by an unusually warm and dry summer, leading to a severe population crash where the census size drops to just 20 individuals.
