This exercise challenges you to think like a field ecologist tasked with verifying the success of a classic wolf reintroduction. To prove that a trophic cascade is underway, you must design a monitoring plan that directly measures the crucial links in the ecological chain of effects, from predator to herbivore to plant [@problem_id:1878599].", "problem": "A conservation team is managing a large, remote national park. For decades, the absence of apex predators led to a significant overpopulation of elk (*Cervus canadensis*). This has resulted in widespread overgrazing, particularly impacting the growth and survival of young aspen trees (*Populus tremuloides*), which are a key food source for elk. To restore ecological balance, the team has reintroduced a population of gray wolves (*Canis lupus*), which are considered a keystone predator in this ecosystem.\n\nThe primary goal of the reintroduction is to initiate a trophic cascade, where the wolves, by preying on or altering the behavior of the elk, indirectly facilitate the recovery of the aspen groves. The team needs to establish a simple yet effective monitoring plan to evaluate the success of this rewilding project over the next decade. The plan must focus on one primary faunal indicator and one primary floral indicator that are most directly linked to this specific trophic cascade.\n\nWhich of the following monitoring plans would be the most direct and effective for assessing the success of the wolf reintroduction in restoring the elk-aspen interaction?\n\nA. Monitoring the number of wolf packs established (faunal) and the annual seed production of mature pine trees (floral).\n\nB. Monitoring the population size of coyotes, a smaller competing predator (faunal), and the overall vegetation greenness measured by satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (floral).\n\nC. Monitoring the population density and spatial distribution of elk (faunal) and the height and recruitment rate of young aspen saplings in previously overgrazed areas (floral).\n\nD. Monitoring the population abundance of scavenger species like ravens that feed on wolf kills (faunal) and the nitrogen content in the soil of aspen groves (floral).\n\nE. Monitoring the hunting success rate of wolves (faunal) and the incidence of disease in beaver populations that also depend on aspen (floral).", "solution": "Goal clarification: The project aims to detect a trophic cascade initiated by wolf reintroduction that reduces elk pressure on young aspen, thereby increasing aspen recruitment and growth. The most direct evaluation must therefore measure (i) the wolf effect on elk (the key herbivore in this cascade) and (ii) the resulting response of aspen regeneration in areas previously limited by elk browsing.\n\nDirect causal chain: wolves affect elk demography and behavior (mortality/risk-sensitive foraging), which alters browsing intensity and spatial use, which then affects aspen sapling recruitment (number of stems establishing and surviving) and growth (height growth to escape the browse layer). Thus, the most informative indicators are those that quantify elk density and spatial distribution across risky vs safe habitats, and the recruitment and height of young aspen in sites formerly overgrazed.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A is not direct: the number of wolf packs does not measure elk response, and pine seed production is not the focal plant response of the elk-aspen interaction.\n- Option B is not direct: coyote populations are mesopredators and not the main herbivore or apex predator in this cascade; NDVI is broad, integrates many vegetation types, and is too coarse to specifically detect aspen sapling recovery from browsing.\n- Option C is direct: elk population density and spatial distribution are the primary faunal indicators of top-down control and risk-mediated habitat use; height and recruitment of young aspen saplings in previously overgrazed areas are the primary floral indicators of reduced browsing and recovery.\n- Option D is indirect and confounded: scavenger abundance tracks carrion availability rather than the elk-aspen interaction; soil nitrogen in aspen groves is influenced by many processes and is not the primary signal of release from browsing.\n- Option E is not direct to the focal interaction: wolf hunting success does not necessarily capture elk redistribution or browsing pressure; beaver disease incidence introduces unrelated confounders and is not a direct measure of aspen recovery from elk browsing.\n\nConclusion: The plan that most directly and effectively assesses the targeted wolf-elk-aspen cascade is to monitor elk density and distribution together with aspen sapling recruitment and height in previously overgrazed areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1878599"}, {"introduction": "A successful reintroduction is not just about the species, but also about the place.
