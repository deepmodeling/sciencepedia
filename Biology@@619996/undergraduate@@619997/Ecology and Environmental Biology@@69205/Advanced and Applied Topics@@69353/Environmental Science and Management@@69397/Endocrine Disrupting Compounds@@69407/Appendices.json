Toxicological studies have identified it as a potent Endocrine Disrupting Compound (EDC). To assess the risk to local anadromous fish species that enter the lake to spawn, an ecotoxicologist develops a simple one-compartment pharmacokinetic model.\n\nThe model describes the concentration of the EDC in the fish's tissue, $C_{tissue}$ (measured in nanograms per gram, ng/g), over time, $t$ (in days). The rate of change of the tissue concentration is governed by the following differential equation, which balances the uptake from the water and the metabolic elimination from the tissue:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{tissue}}{dt} = k_1 C_{water} - k_2 C_{tissue}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $C_{water}$ is the concentration of the EDC in the lake water, which is constant.\n- $k_1$ is the uptake rate constant.\n- $k_2$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nA previously uncontaminated fish is introduced into the lake at time $t=0$.

Its adipose (fatty) tissue accounts for a fraction $f_{fat} = 0.12$ of its total body mass. Due to its lipophilic nature, APZ accumulates in this fatty tissue. The bioconcentration factor ($BCF$), which relates the mass-based concentration in fat ($C_{fat}$ in $\\mu$g/kg) to the volume-based concentration in water ($C_{water}$ in $\\mu$g/L), is given as $BCF = 2500$ L/kg.\n\nThe fish's liver metabolizes APZ into a water-soluble conjugate, which is then actively excreted into the bile. This metabolic pathway is the primary route of elimination for this compound. Analysis of the fish's bile reveals that the concentration of the APZ metabolite is $C_{bile} = 150$ milligrams per liter. The fish produces a total volume of $V_{bile} = 4.5$ milliliters of bile per day.\n\nTo understand the full extent of the fish's exposure and metabolic processing of APZ, compare the dynamic elimination flux with the static stored amount.

In the exposure assessment stage, it is determined that the primary route of exposure for the otters is through their diet, which in this contaminated region consists exclusively of one species of fish. Analysis of fish tissue samples reveals an average FXC concentration, $C_{fish}$, of 0.185 mg of FXC per kg of fish tissue. Field observations of otter foraging behavior provide an estimated daily food ingestion rate, FIR, of 0.22 kg of fish per kg of otter body weight per day.\n\nIn the effects assessment stage, toxicological data from laboratory studies on mink, a closely related surrogate species, are used to establish a toxicity reference value. A No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for reproductive impairment is determined to be 0.050 mg of FXC per kg of body weight per day.\n\nThe final step is risk characterization, where a Risk Quotient (RQ) is calculated to quantify the potential for adverse effects.
