An environmental economist is tasked with estimating the direct economic value of this provisioning service to the community using the replacement cost method.\n\nThe Ka’lani community has a total population of 2,500 people. The traditional remedy is primarily used by the adult population. Adults constitute 60% of the total population, and within this adult group, 20% regularly use the plant-based remedy.\n\nClinical studies have shown that the therapeutic benefit from the annual consumption of the traditional remedy by one person is equivalent to taking one tablet daily of a commercial pharmaceutical drug named ArthriFlex. ArthriFlex is sold in bottles containing 90 tablets at a market price of $180 per bottle.

ArthriFlex is sold at price $p = 180$ (USD) per bottle, with $q = 90$ tablets per bottle, so the per-tablet price is\n$$\n\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{180}{90} = 2.\n$$\nThus, the annual replacement cost per person is\n$$\nC_{\\text{person}} = 365 \\times \\frac{p}{q} = 365 \\times 2 = 730.\n$$\nTherefore, the total annual replacement cost (economic value) is\n$$\nV = N_{\\text{users}} \\times C_{\\text{person}} = 300 \\times 730 = 219000.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is\n$$\n2.19 \\times 10^{5}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.19 \\times 10^{5}}$$", "id": "1843217"}, {"introduction": "Building on single-point valuation, this practice explores how to assess services that deliver benefits over many years, such as carbon sequestration.

The goal is to maximize the total annual economic value derived from a combination of ecosystem services: timber production, water quality regulation, and recreational opportunities. Three distinct management strategies are being considered.\n\nThe key economic and ecological parameters are as follows:\n- The market price for harvested timber is $120 per cubic meter ($m^3$).\n- The recreational value is linked to the deer population, which provides hunting opportunities. A sustainable harvest of 15% of the total deer population is permitted each year. The total economic value (from permits, tourism, etc.) is estimated to be $2,000 per harvested deer.\n- The water quality value is determined by the forest's ability to prevent sediment runoff into a downstream reservoir. A nearby agricultural landscape with no forest cover represents a baseline with a high sediment runoff of 500 kilograms per hectare per year (kg/ha/yr). The local water treatment plant incurs a cost of $2.50 for every kilogram of sediment it must remove. The economic value of the forest's water regulation service is thus the avoided cost of sediment removal compared to this baseline.\n\nThe projected annual outcomes for each management strategy are:\n\n**Strategy A: Intensive Timber Harvest**\n- Timber Yield: 8.0 $m^3/ha/yr$\n- Sediment Runoff: 150 kg/ha/yr\n- Deer Population Density: 2 deer/ha\n\n**Strategy B: Balanced Use**\n- Timber Yield: 4.0 $m^3/ha/yr$\n- Sediment Runoff: 30 kg/ha/yr\n- Deer Population Density: 8 deer/ha\n\n**Strategy C: Conservation Focus**\n- Timber Yield: 1.0 $m^3/ha/yr$\n- Sediment Runoff: 5 kg/ha/yr\n- Deer Population Density: 5 deer/ha\n\nCalculate the maximum possible total annual economic value from this 1,500-hectare forest by selecting the optimal management strategy.
