This practice introduces the concept of a \"water footprint\" through a simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a common item: a cotton t-shirt. By breaking down the water usage across different production stages, from farm to factory, you will learn to account for the \"hidden\" resources consumed in a global supply chain, a critical skill for evaluating the true sustainability of products [@problem_id:1886534].", "problem": "An environmental consulting firm is conducting a simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the 'blue water' footprint of a single cotton t-shirt. Blue water is defined as water sourced from surface or groundwater bodies (e.g., rivers, lakes, aquifers). The firm has collected the following data for the three main water-consuming stages of production:\n\n1.  **Cotton Cultivation**: The production of 1.00 kg of ginned cotton (raw cotton ready for processing) in the arid region where the farm is located requires 2,550 liters of irrigation water. Due to material loss during spinning and weaving, 0.350 kg of ginned cotton is needed to ultimately produce one t-shirt.\n\n2.  **Fabric Wet Processing**: After ginning, the cotton fibers undergo wet processing, which includes cleaning and preparing them for spinning. This stage consumes 125 liters of water for every 1.00 kg of ginned cotton processed.\n\n3.  **Dyeing and Finishing**: The final stage involves dyeing the manufactured t-shirt. The dyeing process for a single t-shirt, which has a final mass of 0.250 kg, requires 45.0 liters of water.\n\nAssuming these three stages represent the entirety of the blue water consumption, calculate the total blue water footprint for one cotton t-shirt. Express your answer in liters, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "To find the total blue water footprint of a single t-shirt, we must calculate the water consumed in each of the three specified production stages and then sum these amounts. The problem provides all the necessary data for these calculations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the water required for the cotton cultivation stage. The problem states that 2,550 liters of water are needed to grow 1.00 kg of ginned cotton, and that 0.350 kg of ginned cotton is required for one t-shirt. Therefore, the water for cultivation per t-shirt, $W_{\\text{cultivation}}$, is the product of the water consumption rate and the mass of cotton required.\n$$W_{\\text{cultivation}} = \\left(2550 \\, \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{kg of cotton}}\\right) \\times (0.350 \\, \\text{kg of cotton}) = 892.5 \\, \\text{L}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the water used during the fabric wet processing stage. The facility uses 125 liters of water per 1.00 kg of ginned cotton processed. Since 0.350 kg of ginned cotton is processed for each t-shirt, the water for this stage, $W_{\\text{processing}}$, is:\n$$W_{\\text{processing}} = \\left(125 \\, \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{kg of cotton}}\\right) \\times (0.350 \\, \\text{kg of cotton}) = 43.75 \\, \\text{L}$$\nNote that the mass of the final t-shirt (0.250 kg) is not relevant for this calculation, as the processing is done on the initial mass of ginned cotton.\n\nThird, the water for the dyeing and finishing stage, $W_{\\text{dyeing}}$, is given directly in the problem statement. This stage consumes a fixed amount of water per t-shirt:\n$$W_{\\text{dyeing}} = 45.0 \\, \\text{L}$$\n\nFinally, the total blue water footprint, $W_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the water consumed in these three stages:\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = W_{\\text{cultivation}} + W_{\\text{processing}} + W_{\\text{dyeing}}$$\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = 892.5 \\, \\text{L} + 43.75 \\, \\text{L} + 45.0 \\, \\text{L} = 981.25 \\, \\text{L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number 981.25 has five significant figures. The first three significant figures are 9, 8, and 1. The fourth digit is 2, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the third digit).\n$$W_{\\text{total}} \\approx 981 \\, \\text{L}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{981}$$", "id": "1886534"}, {"introduction": "A core challenge of sustainability is managing finite resources for future generations.
