Different legal doctrines are not abstract concepts but guiding principles that can lead to dramatically different outcomes for competing users.

They both depend on the Azure River, which originates in Veridia and flows through Aridia before reaching the sea. The average total annual flow of the Azure River is 120 billion cubic meters per year (BCM/year).\n\nDecades of development have led to the following water usage patterns and demands:\n- **Veridia (Upstream):** Has a historical water usage claim of 40 BCM/year. Its current total water demand for agriculture, industry, and municipal needs is 70 BCM/year.\n- **Aridia (Downstream):** Has a historical water usage claim of 60 BCM/year. Its current total water demand is 90 BCM/year.\n\nThe states are considering two different legal doctrines to manage the river's allocation:\n\n1.  **Prior Appropriation Doctrine:** This doctrine follows the principle of \"first in time, first in right.\" Senior rights holders (those who first used the water) get their full historical allocation before junior rights holders receive any. For this problem, assume Veridia holds the senior water right for its full historical claim, and Aridia holds the junior water right for its historical claim.\n\n2.  **Equitable Use Doctrine:** This doctrine allocates water based on a holistic view of fairness, considering factors like population, economic dependency, and present needs. For the purpose of this problem, a simplified model of this doctrine is adopted: the total available river flow is allocated to each state in direct proportion to its current total water demand.\n\nCalculate the water deficit for the downstream state, Aridia, if the **Equitable Use Doctrine** is implemented.

The concept of a 'just transition' ensures that the move to a green economy is fair and equitable for affected workers and communities.

This transition involves phasing out all coal production over a period of $T$ years and implementing comprehensive socioeconomic support programs for the affected communities and workforce.\n\nThe transition plan has two main financial components:\n1.  A Worker Support Program, which provides retraining and income support for every coal industry worker. The total number of workers requiring this support is $N_w$. The average total cost of this support per worker is $C_w$.\n2.  A Regional Diversification Fund, which is a one-time investment to stimulate new industries in the former coal-mining regions. The total amount allocated for this fund is $F_d$.\n\nTo finance these programs, the government will implement a \"Just Transition Levy,\" a flat-rate fee, $L$, charged on every tonne of coal produced during the phase-out period. The country's annual coal production will be reduced linearly over the transition period. The production in year $t$ of the phase-out (where $t=1, 2, \\ldots, T$) is modeled by the equation $P(t) = P_0 \\frac{T - t + 1}{T}$, where $P_0$ is the production level in the year immediately preceding the start of the phase-out.\n\nGiven the following parameters, calculate the exact levy rate $L$ that must be charged to ensure the total revenue from the levy over the entire $T$-year period exactly covers the total cost of the transition programs.\n\n-   Initial annual production, $P_0 = 85.0$ million tonnes\n-   Transition period, $T = 15$ years\n-   Number of workers needing support, $N_w = 42,000$\n-   Cost per worker, $C_w = \\$65,000$\n-   Regional Diversification Fund, $F_d = \\$2.75$ billion\n\nExpress your answer in dollars per tonne, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of a levy rate, $L$, in dollars per tonne, required to fund a \"just transition\" policy. The total revenue from this levy over the entire transition period must equal the total cost of the support programs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the transition, $C_{total}$. This cost is the sum of the total cost for the Worker Support Program and the Regional Diversification Fund.\n\nThe total cost for the Worker Support Program, $C_{WSP}$, is the number of workers, $N_w$, multiplied by the cost per worker, $C_w$.\n$$C_{WSP} = N_w \\times C_w$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C_{WSP} = 42,000 \\times \\$65,000 = \\$2,730,000,000 = \\$2.73 \\text{ billion}$$\n\nThe cost of the Regional Diversification Fund, $F_d$, is given as $\\$2.75$ billion.\n$$F_d = \\$2,750,000,000$$\n\nThe total cost of the transition is the sum of these two components:\n$$C_{total} = C_{WSP} + F_d$$\n$$C_{total} = \\$2,730,000,000 + \\$2,750,000,000 = \\$5,480,000,000$$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of coal, $P_{total}$, that will be produced during the entire $T$-year phase-out period.

Let's examine the terms in the sum: for $t=1$, the term is $T$; for $t=2$, it's $T-1$; and so on, until for $t=T$, the term is $1$. This is equivalent to the sum of the first $T$ positive integers: $1 + 2 + \\dots + T$.
