Groups of tadpoles were raised in laboratory mesocosms containing different concentrations of NaCl dissolved in water. After 30 days of exposure, researchers assessed the prevalence of a specific teratogenic effect: the malformation of the jaw apparatus.\n\nThe term Effective Concentration 20 (EC20) is a standard toxicological metric, defined here as the concentration of a substance that is predicted to cause the specified adverse effect (in this case, jaw malformation) in 20% of the exposed population.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n- At a concentration of 0 mg/L NaCl (control group), 2% of the tadpoles exhibited jaw malformations.\n- At a concentration of 500 mg/L NaCl, 12% of the tadpoles exhibited jaw malformations.\n- At a concentration of 1000 mg/L NaCl, 25% of the tadpoles exhibited jaw malformations.\n- At a concentration of 2000 mg/L NaCl, 48% of the tadpoles exhibited jaw malformations.\n\nAssuming a locally linear relationship in the dose-response curve between the data points that bracket the target effect level, calculate the EC20 for jaw deformities in this tadpole population.

This exercise explores the critical distinction between physiological acclimation—temporary changes within an individual's lifetime—and genetic adaptation, a heritable, evolutionary change occurring over generations. By analyzing the results of a common-garden experiment [@problem_id:1843485], you will develop the crucial skill of interpreting experimental data to uncover the fundamental biological processes driving population responses to environmental stress.", "problem": "An ecotoxicologist is investigating a population of freshwater snails (*Physa acuta*) living in a pond heavily contaminated with copper from a nearby abandoned mine. These snails appear to thrive, showing significantly higher survival rates compared to snails of the same species from a nearby, pristine (uncontaminated) pond. The researcher wants to determine if this high tolerance to copper is due to physiological acclimation (individual, non-heritable changes during an organism's lifetime) or local genetic adaptation (heritable, population-level changes over generations).\n\nTo test this, the researcher collects adult snails from both the contaminated pond (Population C) and the pristine pond (Population P). These adults are brought to a controlled laboratory setting. Snails from each population are kept in separate tanks with clean, uncontaminated water and allowed to reproduce. The eggs hatch, and the resulting offspring have therefore never been exposed to copper.\n\nThe researcher then conducts an experiment using these lab-reared offspring. Offspring from Population C and offspring from Population P are each divided into two groups. One group is raised in clean water (the control), and the other is raised in water with a high concentration of copper, mimicking the contaminated pond. After a set period, survival rates are measured.\n\nThe experiment yields the following statistically significant result: In the copper-contaminated water, the offspring of snails from Population C have a much higher survival rate than the offspring of snails from Population P. Survival rates in the clean water control tanks are high and nearly identical for both groups.\n\nBased on this specific outcome, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The copper tolerance observed in the wild Population C is primarily the result of physiological acclimation.\n\nB. The experiment is fundamentally flawed because the offspring, having been raised in a lab, cannot provide information about the wild populations.\n\nC. The copper tolerance observed in the wild Population C is primarily the result of genetic adaptation.\n\nD. The adult snails from Population C must have transferred their tolerance to their offspring through non-genetic maternal effects, such as provisioning eggs with protective compounds.\n\nE. Both populations are naturally tolerant to copper, and the differences observed are likely due to random statistical variation.", "solution": "Define the alternative mechanisms. Physiological acclimation is a non-heritable, reversible change within an individual’s lifetime due to prior exposure; its effects should not create persistent differences among offspring that have never experienced the stressor. Genetic adaptation is a heritable, population-level difference in genotype frequencies that produces consistent phenotypic differences among offspring even when reared in a common environment. Non-genetic parental (e.g., maternal) effects are possible but are typically transient and are not required if genetic differences suffice to explain the pattern.\n\nIdentify the experimental design. The researcher executed a common-garden experiment: adults from both populations were brought to the lab and maintained in clean water to reproduce, and their offspring—who had no prior copper exposure—were split and reared either in clean water or copper-contaminated water. This design controls for environmental history and assesses whether differences persist in a shared environment, thereby testing for a heritable (genetic) basis.\n\nInterpret the key result. In copper-contaminated water, offspring from Population C exhibit much higher survival than offspring from Population P, while in clean water both groups show similarly high survival. Thus, the difference in survival is environment-dependent and emerges specifically under copper exposure, indicating a genotype-by-environment interaction consistent with local adaptation to copper in Population C. The equal survival in clean water indicates no general quality or condition differences between offspring groups that could confound the copper-specific effect.\n\nEvaluate each conclusion:\n- Against acclimation (A): Because offspring had no prior copper exposure, their higher survival cannot be attributed to their own acclimation. Parental acclimation is non-heritable and would not be expected to systematically elevate offspring survival after parents have been maintained in clean water prior to reproduction; therefore the observed persistent offspring difference argues against acclimation as the primary cause.\n- Against fundamental flaw (B): Common-garden rearing of offspring is a standard method to infer genetic differences between populations; the result directly informs about heritable population differences. Hence the experiment is not fundamentally flawed for this purpose.\n- For genetic adaptation (C): Persistence of population differences among naïve, lab-reared offspring under standardized conditions most strongly supports a heritable, genetic basis for copper tolerance in Population C.\n- Against mandatory maternal effects (D): While non-genetic maternal effects can influence offspring, the data do not require them; the pattern is fully explained by genetic adaptation. Moreover, parents were kept in clean water prior to reproduction, which reduces but does not entirely eliminate potential carryover. The statement’s “must” is therefore not supported.\n- Against random variation (E): The difference in copper survival is stated to be statistically significant, and controls are similar, so random variation is an unlikely explanation.\n\nConclude. The most strongly supported conclusion is that copper tolerance in wild Population C is primarily the result of genetic adaptation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1843485"}, {"introduction": "Some of the most hazardous contaminants are those that biomagnify, becoming more concentrated at higher levels of the food web and posing a significant threat to top predators.
