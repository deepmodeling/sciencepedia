This exercise introduces a fundamental field technique known as point sampling to estimate basal area, a critical metric for forest density and timber volume. By applying a Basal Area Factor (BAF) to simple tree counts, you will learn how foresters efficiently gauge the current state of a stand, which is the essential first step in any management plan [@problem_id:1884683].", "problem": "An ecologist is developing a sustainable management plan for a 50-hectare mixed hardwood forest. A key parameter for assessing forest health and productivity is the basal area per hectare, which measures the total cross-sectional area of tree stems at breast height per unit of land area.\n\nTo estimate this value, the ecologist employs a technique known as point sampling. Five sample points are randomly established throughout the forest. At each point, the ecologist uses a calibrated optical instrument called a wedge prism. The prism has a known Basal Area Factor (BAF) of 2.2 square meters per hectare. When viewing trees through the prism from a sample point, trees are tallied as \"in\" if their trunks appear to be horizontally displaced by more than their own width.\n\nThe counts of \"in\" trees recorded at the five sample points are as follows:\n- Point 1: 7 trees\n- Point 2: 10 trees\n- Point 3: 8 trees\n- Point 4: 12 trees\n- Point 5: 9 trees\n\nUsing this data, calculate the average basal area of the forest. Express your answer in square meters per hectare, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "In variable-radius point sampling with a wedge prism, each tallied tree represents a basal area contribution equal to the Basal Area Factor. Therefore, at a given point, the basal area per hectare estimate is $F N$, where $F$ is the BAF and $N$ is the count of \"in\" trees at that point. With $k$ independent sample points, the unbiased estimator of the stand basal area per hectare is the average over points:\n$$\n\\hat{G} = F \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_{i}.\n$$\n\nHere, $F=2.2$ square meters per hectare, $k=5$, and the counts are $N_{1}=7$, $N_{2}=10$, $N_{3}=8$, $N_{4}=12$, $N_{5}=9$. Compute the sample mean count:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=1}^{5} N_{i} = \\frac{7+10+8+12+9}{5} = \\frac{46}{5} = 9.2.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\hat{G} = 2.2 \\cdot 9.2 = 20.24.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $20.2$ in square meters per hectare. The total forest area of 50 hectares is not needed because the estimator already yields basal area per hectare.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20.2}$$", "id": "1884683"}, {"introduction": "Once a forest's resources are inventoried, managers face crucial economic decisions, chief among them being the optimal time to harvest. This practice explores the concept of Net Present Value (NPV), a cornerstone of financial analysis that allows for the comparison of revenues generated at different points in time.
