One such disease is caused by the Nipah virus, which can be transmitted from its natural reservoir in fruit bats to intermediate hosts like pigs, and subsequently to humans.\n\nAn ecologist is studying a hypothetical region, the Sunda Peninsula, to identify areas at high risk for Nipah virus spillover. The study area is a flat, rectangular region mapped onto a Cartesian coordinate system where each unit represents one kilometer. The ecologist models two key geographical features:\n\n1.  **Bat Pathogen Dispersal Zone:** Based on satellite tracking of fruit bats and environmental sampling, the area where infectious material (like droppings and partially eaten fruit) is likely to be deposited is modeled as a perfect circle. This circle is centered at coordinates $(50, 50)$ and has a radius of $30$ km.\n2.  **Commercial Pig Farming Zone:** Due to land use policies, all commercial pig farming is restricted to a large rectangular area defined by the inequalities $0 \\le x \\le 100$ and $0 \\le y \\le 35$.\n\nA \"High-Risk Zone for Spillover\" is defined as any geographical area where the Bat Pathogen Dispersal Zone and the Commercial Pig Farming Zone overlap.\n\nCalculate the total area of this High-Risk Zone for Spillover.

The circle spans $y$ from $50-30=20$ to $50+30=80$, so its overlap with the rectangle in $y$ is the interval $[20,35]$. For any $y$ in this interval, the circle’s $x$-extent is\n$$x=50\\pm \\sqrt{30^{2}-(y-50)^{2}},$$\nwhich lies within $[20,80]\\subset[0,100]$, hence the rectangle does not further clip in $x$.

This exercise delves into the field of molecular forensics, demonstrating how the genetic code of a virus acts as a historical record.

All viral samples were collected on January 1, 2024.\n\nA phylogenetic tree was constructed using the viral genome sequences to deduce the transmission history. The analysis revealed the tree's structure and the genetic distances between key points, represented by branch lengths in units of substitutions per nucleotide site. The findings are summarized below:\n\n*   The human viral sample, H1, is phylogenetically closest to a chicken viral sample, C2. These two samples diverge from their most recent common ancestor, which we will call Node X. The branch length from Node X to the H1 sample is 0.003 substitutions/site.\n*   The clade formed by (H1, C2) is a sister group to another chicken viral sample, C1. The most recent common ancestor of all three of these samples is Node Y. The branch connecting Node Y to Node X has a length of 0.001 substitutions/site.\n*   The entire clade of chicken and human viruses, which originates at Node Y, is the sister group to the main clade containing all viruses sampled from the Wild Geese.

Under a constant-rate molecular clock, immediate cross-species transmission into the human lineage is best approximated by the time of the divergence at Node X between the human lineage and its closest non-human lineage. Because H1 is sister to C2, the immediate source species is Domestic Chicken.\n\nTo date the spillover, use the molecular clock relation that branch length equals substitution rate times time. For the branch from Node X to H1 we have a length of $d_{X \\to H1} = 0.003$ substitutions per site. With a strict clock at rate $R = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ substitutions per site per year, the elapsed time from Node X to H1 is\n$$\nt_{X \\to H1} = \\frac{d_{X \\to H1}}{R} = \\frac{0.003}{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{3.0}{5.0} \\times 10^{1} = 6 \\text{ years}.\n$$\nAll samples were collected on January 1, 2024, so the divergence at Node X (and thus the cross-species transmission into the human lineage) is dated to $2024 - 6 = 2018$. The branch length from Node Y to Node X does not affect the timing of the split between H1 and C2, which is determined by the path length from H1 back to Node X under the strict clock.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate source species is Domestic Chicken, and the estimated year of spillover is 2018.
