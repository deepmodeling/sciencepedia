To manage our economic activities sustainably, we first need a way to measure our total demand on nature's resources. The Ecological Footprint is a powerful accounting tool that does just this, translating our consumption into the amount of biologically productive land and sea area required to support it. This exercise provides hands-on practice in calculating a nation's Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity, offering a clear, quantitative look at whether a country is living within its ecological means [@problem_id:1839931].", "problem": "In the field of ecological economics, a nation's sustainability is often assessed by comparing its demand for natural resources with the regenerative capacity of its ecosystems. The Ecological Footprint (EF) quantifies this demand, representing the hypothetical area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the resources a population consumes and to absorb its waste. Conversely, a nation's Biocapacity (BC) represents the supply, measuring the actual productive area available within its borders. Both metrics are standardized into a common unit called a global hectare (gha), which represents a hectare with world-average biological productivity.\n\nConsider the hypothetical nation of Veridia. You are provided with the following data for a given year to assess its ecological balance.\n\n**National and per Capita Data:**\n*   Total Population of Veridia, $N = 50.0 \\times 10^6$ people.\n*   Total available cropland area, $A_{crop} = 30.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Total available grazing land area, $A_{graze} = 50.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Total available forest land area, $A_{forest} = 80.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Total available fishing grounds area, $A_{fish} = 15.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Per capita footprint for cropland products: $F_{crop, pc} = 0.50$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for grazing land products: $F_{graze, pc} = 0.20$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for forest products: $F_{forest, pc} = 0.30$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for fish and seafood: $F_{fish, pc} = 0.10$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for built-up land: $F_{built, pc} = 0.05$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita carbon footprint (the land area needed to absorb CO2 emissions): $F_{carbon, pc} = 2.50$ hectares/person.\n\n**Standardization Factors:**\nTo convert physical hectares to global hectares, two types of factors are used:\n1.  **Yield Factor (YF)**: This dimensionless factor compares a country's national average yield for a given land type to the world average yield.\n2.  **Equivalence Factor (EQF)**: This dimensionless factor scales different land types according to their world-average biological productivity. For example, a cropland EQF of 2.5 means world-average cropland is 2.5 times more productive than a world-average hectare of all bioproductive land types combined.\n\nThe factors for Veridia and the world are as follows:\n| Land Type | Yield Factor (YF) for Veridia | Equivalence Factor (EQF) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Cropland | 1.20 | 2.51 |\n| Grazing Land | 0.90 | 0.45 |\n| Forest Land | 1.10 | 1.26 |\n| Fishing Grounds | 1.00 | 0.37 |\n| Built-up Land | N/A | 2.51 |\n| Carbon Footprint Land| N/A | 1.26 |\n\nCalculate Veridia's ecological balance, which is defined as its total biocapacity minus its total Ecological Footprint.

The project is projected to have a lifespan of 50 years. The economic benefits are twofold. First, the restored ecosystem is expected to provide a consistent stream of benefits from improved water purification and increased fish stocks, valued at $20,000 per year. These benefits begin at the end of the first year and continue for all 50 years of the project's life. Second, after 40 years, the fully mature wetland is predicted to provide a critical one-time benefit by acting as a natural barrier against a major storm, an event whose damages are valued at $1,000,000.\n\nA debate has arisen regarding the appropriate social discount rate to use for evaluating the project's worth in today's terms. Environmental economists advocate for a low discount rate of 1% per annum ($r = 0.01$) to give more weight to long-term environmental gains. In contrast, fiscal analysts propose a higher rate of 5% per annum ($r = 0.05$), reflecting the opportunity cost of capital in the market.\n\nCalculate the absolute difference in the total present-day monetary value of the project's benefits when evaluated using the low discount rate versus the high discount rate.
