Biocapacity is a measure of the amount of biologically productive land and sea area available to provide the resources a population consumes and to absorb its wastes, given current technology and management practices.

The student considers a single passenger's round-trip flight from New York to London.\n\nTo complete this analysis, use the following data:\n- The one-way flight distance is 5,540 km.\n- The aircraft's carbon dioxide emission is 0.090 kg of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) per passenger per kilometer.\n- The plan is to offset these emissions by planting a new temperate forest. This specific type of forest sequesters carbon at a rate of 2.50 metric tons of pure carbon (C) per hectare per year.

A global hectare is a unit of measurement representing a hectare of land with world-average biological productivity. The specific temperate forest being planted is more productive than the world average and has a productivity factor of 1.36. This means one standard hectare of this forest is biologically equivalent to 1.36 global hectares.\n\nCalculate the total area of this new forest, in global hectares, required to sequester all the carbon emitted from this single passenger's round-trip flight over a one-year period. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let's break down the calculation into a series of logical steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) for the passenger's journey. The one-way distance is given as $d = 5540 \\text{ km}$. A round-trip flight covers twice this distance.\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times d = 2 \\times 5540 \\text{ km} = 11080 \\text{ km}$$\nThe emission factor is given as $E_f = 0.090 \\text{ kg CO}_2 / (\\text{passenger} \\cdot \\text{km})$.

The sequestration rate is given in terms of carbon, not carbon dioxide. We use the provided molar masses to find the mass ratio of carbon in a CO2 molecule.\nThe molar mass of a carbon atom is $m_C = 12.0 \\text{ g/mol}$.\nThe molar mass of an oxygen atom is $m_O = 16.0 \\text{ g/mol}$.\nThe molar mass of a carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) is $m_{\\text{CO}_2} = m_C + 2 \\times m_O = 12.0 + 2 \\times 16.0 = 44.0 \\text{ g/mol}$.\nThe fraction of the mass of a CO2 molecule that is carbon is the ratio of their molar masses:\n$$R = \\frac{m_C}{m_{\\text{CO}_2}} = \\frac{12.0 \\text{ g/mol}}{44.0 \\text{ g/mol}} = \\frac{12.0}{44.0}$$\nNow, we can find the total mass of carbon, $M_C$, emitted during the flight:\n$$M_C = M_{\\text{CO}_2} \\times R = 997.2 \\text{ kg} \\times \\frac{12.0}{44.0} \\approx 271.96 \\text{ kg C}$$\n\nThe next step is to calculate the physical area of the new temperate forest required to sequester this mass of carbon in one year. The sequestration rate is given as $S = 2.50 \\text{ metric tons C / (hectare} \\cdot \\text{year)}$. We must convert this to kg per hectare per year to match our units for $M_C$.\n$$S = 2.50 \\frac{\\text{metric tons}}{\\text{hectare} \\cdot \\text{year}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ kg}}{1 \\text{ metric ton}} = 2500 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{hectare} \\cdot \\text{year}}$$\nThe required physical area in standard hectares, $A_{\\text{hectare}}$, is the total mass of carbon divided by the sequestration rate.\n$$A_{\\text{hectare}} = \\frac{M_C}{S} = \\frac{271.96 \\text{ kg}}{2500 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{hectare}}} \\approx 0.108785 \\text{ hectares}$$\n\nFinally, we must convert this physical area into global hectares (gha). A global hectare is a standardized unit that accounts for differences in land productivity. The problem states that the new forest has a productivity factor of $P_f = 1.36$. This means that one physical hectare of this forest provides the biological productivity of 1.36 world-average hectares. Therefore, to express the required area in the standardized unit of global hectares, we multiply the physical area by the productivity factor.\n$$A_{\\text{gha}} = A_{\\text{hectare}} \\times P_f$$\n$$A_{\\text{gha}} \\approx 0.108785 \\times 1.36 \\approx 0.147948 \\text{ gha}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$A_{\\text{gha}} \\approx 0.148 \\text{ gha}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.148}$$", "id": "1840159"}, {"introduction": "This final practice explores the dynamic relationship between a nation's biocapacity and its ecological footprint over time.
