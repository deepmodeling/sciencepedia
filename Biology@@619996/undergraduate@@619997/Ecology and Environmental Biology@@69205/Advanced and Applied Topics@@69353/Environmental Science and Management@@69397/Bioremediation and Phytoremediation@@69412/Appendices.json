Once inside the plant tissues, the VOC is subjected to two competing removal pathways, both of which are modeled as first-order processes with respect to the total mass of the VOC within the plant.\n    a.  Phytodegradation: The VOC is metabolically broken down into harmless substances. This process is characterized by a first-order rate constant $k_{degrad}$.\n    b.  Volatilization: The VOC is released from the plant's leaves into the atmosphere. This process is characterized by a first-order rate constant $k_{vol}$.\n\nThe system is allowed to operate for a long time, eventually reaching a steady state where the total mass of the VOC within the plant becomes constant.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n-   $R_{uptake} = 2.50 \\, \\text{mg/day}$\n-   $k_{degrad} = 0.085 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{vol} = 0.165 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total VOC mass absorbed by the plant from the soil that is successfully detoxified via phytodegradation at steady state.
