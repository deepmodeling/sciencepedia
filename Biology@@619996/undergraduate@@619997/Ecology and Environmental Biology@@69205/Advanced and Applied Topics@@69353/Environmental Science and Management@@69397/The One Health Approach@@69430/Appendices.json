The transmission network connects human communities, feral cat colonies, and synanthropic rodent populations. A simplified model of this contact network has been constructed, where nodes represent distinct populations and weighted edges represent the effective contact rate (a proxy for transmission probability).\n\nThe network consists of the following seven nodes:\n- H: A central Human community\n- C_A: A Feral Cat colony in Park A\n- C_B: A Feral Cat colony in Park B\n- R_A: A Rodent population in Park A\n- R_B: A Rodent population in Park B\n- R_I: A Rodent population in a nearby Industrial Zone\n- R_W: A Rodent population along a connecting Waterway\n\nThe undirected edges and their corresponding weights are as follows:\n- (H, C_A), weight = 5\n- (H, C_B), weight = 2\n- (C_A, R_A), weight = 10\n- (C_A, R_I), weight = 4\n- (C_B, R_B), weight = 12\n- (R_A, R_W), weight = 3\n- (R_B, R_W), weight = 3\n- (R_I, R_W), weight = 1\n\nYour task is to identify the more critical cat colony (C_A or C_B) for a targeted intervention.

For this weighted network, the \"length\" of an edge is the reciprocal of its weight ($1/w$), and the \"shortest path\" is the one with the minimum total length.\n3.  **Eigenvector Centrality**: A measure of a node's influence, proportional to the sum of the centralities of its neighbors.

Weighted Degree Centrality**\n\nThe weighted degree centrality of a node is the sum of the weights of all edges connected to it. This metric represents the total volume of direct contact the node has.\n\nFor the cat colony in Park A (C_A):\nThe edges connected to C_A are (C_A, H), (C_A, R_A), and (C_A, R_I).\n$$ \\text{Deg}(C_A) = w(C_A, H) + w(C_A, R_A) + w(C_A, R_I) = 5 + 10 + 4 = 19 $$\n\nFor the cat colony in Park B (C_B):\nThe edges connected to C_B are (C_B, H) and (C_B, R_B).\n$$ \\text{Deg}(C_B) = w(C_B, H) + w(C_B, R_B) = 2 + 12 = 14 $$\n\nComparing the two, $\\text{Deg}(C_A) = 19 > \\text{Deg}(C_B) = 14$. Thus, according to weighted degree centrality, C_A is the more central node.\n\n**2. Betweenness Centrality**\n\nBetweenness centrality measures a node's importance as a \"bridge\" in the network. We need to assess which node, C_A or C_B, lies on more shortest paths between other pairs of nodes. The path length is the sum of inverse weights, $cost = 1/w$. A qualitative comparison is sufficient. We will examine key pathways, especially those connecting rodent reservoirs to the human population.\n\nPath from R_A to H:\n- Path 1: `R_A - C_A - H`. Cost = $1/10 + 1/5 = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3$.\nThis is the most direct path. C_A is on this shortest path.\n\nPath from R_I to H:\n- Path 1: `R_I - C_A - H`. Cost = $1/4 + 1/5 = 0.25 + 0.2 = 0.45$.\n- Path 2: `R_I - R_W - R_A - C_A - H`. Cost = $1/1 + 1/3 + 1/10 + 1/5 = 1 + 0.333 + 0.1 + 0.2 \\approx 1.63$.\nPath 1 is the shortest. C_A is on this shortest path.\n\nPath from R_W to H:\n- Path 1: `R_W - R_A - C_A - H`. Cost = $1/3 + 1/10 + 1/5 = 0.333 + 0.1 + 0.2 \\approx 0.633$.\n- Path 2: `R_W - R_B - C_B - H`. Cost = $1/3 + 1/12 + 1/2 = 0.333 + 0.083 + 0.5 \\approx 0.916$.\nPath 1 is the shortest. C_A is on this shortest path.\n\nPath from R_B to H:\n- Path 1: `R_B - C_B - H`. Cost = $1/12 + 1/2 = 0.083 + 0.5 \\approx 0.583$.\n- Path 2: `R_B - R_W - R_A - C_A - H`. Cost = $1/3 + 1/3 + 1/10 + 1/5 = 0.333 + 0.333 + 0.1 + 0.2 \\approx 0.966$.\nPath 1 is the shortest. C_B is on this shortest path.\n\nSummary of Human-Reservoir paths:\n- C_A lies on the shortest paths from three rodent populations (R_A, R_I, R_W) to the human population (H).\n- C_B lies on the shortest path from only one rodent population (R_B) to H.\n\nLet's also check paths between rodent populations:\nPath from R_A to R_I:\n- Path 1: `R_A - C_A - R_I`. Cost = $1/10 + 1/4 = 0.1 + 0.25 = 0.35$.\n- Path 2: `R_A - R_W - R_I`. Cost = $1/3 + 1/1 = 1.333$.\nPath 1 is the shortest. C_A is on this shortest path, acting as a bridge between two rodent populations.\n\nC_A connects H to a larger portion of the rodent reservoir network and also serves as a bridge between different rodent populations. C_B's role as a bridge is much more limited. Therefore, we can conclude that the betweenness centrality of C_A is significantly higher than that of C_B, i.e., $\\text{BC}(C_A) > \\text{BC}(C_B)$.\n\n**3. Eigenvector Centrality**\n\nEigenvector centrality measures a node's influence by considering the importance of its neighbors. The problem provides the computed values.\n- For C_A: $EC(C_A) = 0.88$\n- For C_B: $EC(C_B) = 0.65$\n\nComparing the two, $EC(C_A) > EC(C_B)$. According to eigenvector centrality, C_A is the more central node.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's summarize the results:\n- **Weighted Degree Centrality**: $C_A > C_B$ (19 vs 14)\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: $C_A > C_B$ (qualitatively, C_A is a much more significant bridge)\n- **Eigenvector Centrality**: $C_A > C_B$ (0.88 vs 0.65)\n\nAll three centrality metrics consistently identify the cat colony in Park A (C_A) as the more critical node in the transmission network. It has a higher volume of contact, acts as a more crucial bridge for pathogen flow from multiple reservoirs, and is more influentially positioned in the network.\n\nTherefore, the statement that accurately reflects this analysis is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1890600"}, {"introduction": "Effective One Health strategies require us to anticipate the consequences of interventions, which can be counterintuitive in complex systems.

You are asked to evaluate, from first principles, the conditions under which this intervention reduces versus increases spillover risk, given a simple mechanistic model that trades off reduced movement against increased aggregation.\n\nAssume a single wildlife host species of constant population size $N$ carrying a directly transmitted pathogen that follows Susceptible–Infectious–Susceptible (SIS) dynamics. Let $S$ and $I$ denote the numbers of susceptible and infectious animals, with $S + I = N$.

All parameters and variables are defined, and the assumptions are explicitly stated. The problem is a well-posed mathematical exercise in analyzing the behavior of this model under a change of parameters. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are present. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dynamics of the number of infectious individuals, $I$, in a population of size $N$ under an SIS model are governed by the differential equation for the proportion of infectious individuals $i = I/N$:\n$$ \\frac{di}{dt} = \\beta_w c (1-i) i - \\gamma i $$\nThis can be expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number, $R_0 = \\beta_w c / \\gamma$, as:\n$$ \\frac{di}{dt} = \\gamma i \\left( R_0(1-i) - 1 \\right) $$\nThe non-trivial (endemic) steady state, $i^*$, exists and is stable if and only if $R_0 > 1$.

Let $k_p$ be the constant of proportionality and $e$ be the wildlife-human encounter rate per animal. The hazard is given by:\n$$ H = k_p \\cdot \\beta_{wh} \\cdot e \\cdot I^* $$\n\nFirst, we analyze the baseline (no feeding) scenario.\nThe wildlife-wildlife contact rate is $c_0$, so the basic reproduction number is $R_{0,0} = \\beta_w c_0 / \\gamma$. The problem assumes the pathogen is endemic, so $R_{0,0} > 1$.\nThe steady-state number of infectious animals is $I_0^* = N \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0,0}}\\right)$.\nThe wildlife-human encounter rate per animal is $e_0$.\nThe baseline spillover hazard, $H_0$, is therefore:\n$$ H_0 = k_p \\beta_{wh} e_0 I_0^* = k_p \\beta_{wh} e_0 N \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0,0}}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we analyze the scenario with the feeding intervention.\nThe wildlife-wildlife contact rate becomes $c_1 = \\kappa c_0$, where $\\kappa > 1$. The new basic reproduction number is $R_{0,1} = \\beta_w c_1 / \\gamma = \\kappa (\\beta_w c_0 / \\gamma) = \\kappa R_{0,0}$.\nFor the endemic steady state to persist or be established, we must have $R_{0,1} > 1$.\nUnder this condition, the new steady-state number of infectious animals is $I_1^* = N \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0,1}}\\right) = N \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\kappa R_{0,0}}\\right)$.\nThe total wildlife-human encounter rate per animal is modified to $\\rho e_0 + e_f$, where $0  \\rho  1$ and $e_f \\ge 0$.\nThe spillover hazard with feeding, $H_1$, is:\n$$ H_1 = k_p \\beta_{wh} (\\rho e_0 + e_f) I_1^* = k_p \\beta_{wh} (\\rho e_0 + e_f) N \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\kappa R_{0,0}}\\right) $$\n\nThe intervention reduces spillover if and only if $H_1  H_0$.

This gives $\\rho  \\frac{\\kappa \\left(R_{0,0} - 1\\right)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1} - E$. The option omits the factor of $\\kappa$ in the numerator of the fraction. This makes the condition stated in the option fundamentally different and incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC.

Feeding reduces spillover if $x  \\frac{\\kappa \\left(R_{0,0} - 1\\right)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1}$. The right-hand side is a positive number. Since $x = \\rho + E$, and we can have $e_f = 0$ (so $E=0$) and $\\rho$ can be a small positive number, it is entirely possible for the condition $x  \\frac{\\kappa \\left(R_{0,0} - 1\\right)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1}$ to be satisfied. For example, if $E=0$ and $\\rho$ is sufficiently close to $0$, spillover will be reduced.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Feeding reduces spillover precisely when $\\rho  1 - E$, independent of $\\kappa$ and $R_{0,0}$.\nThis is equivalent to stating that the condition is $x  1$. Our derived condition is $x  \\frac{\\kappa \\left(R_{0,0} - 1\\right)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1}$. Let's examine the right-hand side: $\\frac{\\kappa R_{0,0} - \\kappa}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1} = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa - 1}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1}$. Since $\\kappa > 1$ and $R_{0,0}>1$, the term $\\frac{\\kappa - 1}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1}$ is positive. Therefore, the threshold for $x$ is strictly less than $1$ and explicitly depends on both $\\kappa$ and $R_{0,0}$. The statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. If $R_{0,0} \\le 1  \\kappa R_{0,0}$, then feeding necessarily increases spillover regardless of $\\rho$.\nIn this case, the pathogen is not endemic in the baseline state ($R_{0,0} \\le 1$). The disease-free equilibrium is stable, so $I_0^* = 0$. Consequently, the baseline hazard is $H_0 = 0$. After the intervention, the new basic reproduction number is $R_{0,1} = \\kappa R_{0,0} > 1$, so the pathogen becomes endemic. The new steady-state number of infectious individuals is $I_1^* = N (1 - 1/(\\kappa R_{0,0})) > 0$. The new spillover hazard is $H_1 = k_p \\beta_{wh} (\\rho e_0 + e_f) I_1^*$. Since $0  \\rho  1$, $e_0>0$ (implicit), and $e_f \\ge 0$, the total encounter rate $\\rho e_0 + e_f$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $H_1 > 0$. Comparing the hazards, we have $H_1 > H_0 = 0$. Spillover risk increases from zero to a positive value. This is true for any valid $\\rho$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nF. For fixed $R_{0,0} > 1$, the threshold on $x$ that separates spillover decrease from increase is a strictly decreasing function of $\\kappa$ and converges to $\\left(R_{0,0} - 1\\right) / R_{0,0}$ as $\\kappa \\to \\infty$.\nThe threshold is $T(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\kappa \\left(R_{0,0} - 1\\right)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1}$. To check if it is decreasing, we compute its derivative with respect to $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{d\\kappa} = \\frac{d}{d\\kappa} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa(R_{0,0} - 1)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1} \\right) = \\frac{(R_{0,0}-1)(\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1) - \\kappa(R_{0,0}-1)(R_{0,0})}{(\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1)^2} = \\frac{-(R_{0,0}-1)}{(\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1)^2} $$\nSince $R_{0,0} > 1$, the numerator is negative. The denominator is a square, hence positive. Thus, $\\frac{dT}{d\\kappa}  0$, which proves that the threshold is a strictly decreasing function of $\\kappa$ for $\\kappa > 1$.\nNext, we evaluate the limit as $\\kappa \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\kappa \\to \\infty} T(\\kappa) = \\lim_{\\kappa \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\kappa(R_{0,0} - 1)}{\\kappa R_{0,0} - 1} = \\lim_{\\kappa \\to \\infty} \\frac{R_{0,0} - 1}{R_{0,0} - 1/\\kappa} = \\frac{R_{0,0} - 1}{R_{0,0}} $$\nBoth parts of the statement are mathematically correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nFinal evaluation confirms that options A, E, and F are correct statements derived from the provided model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AEF}$$", "id": "2539160"}]}
