We can formalize this conflict using the tools of game theory, where rational actors make decisions to maximize their personal payoffs. This initial practice [@problem_id:1891916] challenges you to apply the concept of expected value within a classic resource-sharing scenario, allowing you to precisely calculate the economic incentive to defect from a cooperative agreement and overexploit the common good.", "problem": "Two large agricultural corporations, AgriCorp and BioGrow, share the Serene River for irrigation. To ensure the river's long-term health and productivity, they have an informal agreement to each limit their annual water extraction to a sustainable volume. Any clandestine extraction beyond this volume is considered \"defecting\" from the agreement, while adhering to the limit is \"cooperating.\"\n\nAn economist at AgriCorp has developed a model to estimate the annual profit for each corporation based on their joint actions. The profits are given in millions of dollars.\n- If both corporations cooperate, the river ecosystem remains stable, and each earns a profit of $P_{CC} = 50$ million.\n- If one corporation defects by secretly extracting more water while the other cooperates, the defector's enhanced crop production yields a profit of $P_{DC} = 75$ million. However, the reduced river flow causes the cooperator's profit to drop to $P_{CD} = 15$ million. This outcome is symmetric for both corporations.\n- If both corporations defect, the severe overuse of water leads to significant ecological damage, which drastically reduces crop quality and machinery efficiency for both. In this scenario, both corporations earn a much lower profit of $P_{DD} = 20$ million.\n\nThe CEO of AgriCorp is contemplating her strategy for the upcoming season. Based on corporate intelligence, she estimates that there is a probability $p = 0.6$ that BioGrow will honor the agreement and cooperate. Assuming AgriCorp's CEO acts as a rational agent aiming to maximize her company's expected profit, what is the expected annual profit for AgriCorp if it decides to defect?\n\nExpress your answer in millions of dollars, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected annual profit for AgriCorp under the specific strategy of \"defecting\". The concept of expected value (or expected profit, in this case) is calculated by summing the products of the value of each possible outcome and the probability of that outcome occurring.\n\nLet $E[\\text{Defect}]$ be the expected profit for AgriCorp if it chooses to defect. The possible outcomes depend on the action of the other party, BioGrow. The problem provides the probability of BioGrow cooperating and the profits for AgriCorp in each scenario.\n\nThe two possible scenarios, given that AgriCorp has decided to defect, are:\n1.  AgriCorp defects, and BioGrow cooperates.\n2.  AgriCorp defects, and BioGrow also defects.\n\nWe need to find the probability and the corresponding profit (payoff) for AgriCorp for each of these two scenarios.\n\nThe probability that BioGrow will cooperate is given as $p$.\n$P(\\text{BioGrow Cooperates}) = p = 0.6$\n\nSince there are only two actions for BioGrow (cooperate or defect), the probability that BioGrow will defect is the complement of the probability that it will cooperate.\n$P(\\text{BioGrow Defects}) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$\n\nNow, let's identify the profit for AgriCorp in each of these scenarios. According to the problem statement:\n-   The profit for AgriCorp when it defects and BioGrow cooperates is $P_{DC} = 75$ million.\n-   The profit for AgriCorp when it defects and BioGrow also defects is $P_{DD} = 20$ million.\n\nThe formula for the expected profit for AgriCorp, given its decision to defect, is:\n$$E[\\text{Defect}] = (\\text{Profit if BioGrow Cooperates}) \\times P(\\text{BioGrow Cooperates}) + (\\text{Profit if BioGrow Defects}) \\times P(\\text{BioGrow Defects})$$\nIn symbolic terms:\n$$E[\\text{Defect}] = P_{DC} \\times p + P_{DD} \\times (1-p)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this equation. The profits are in millions of dollars.\n$$E[\\text{Defect}] = (75) \\times (0.6) + (20) \\times (0.4)$$\nCalculate each term separately:\n$$75 \\times 0.6 = 45$$\n$$20 \\times 0.4 = 8$$\nSumming these terms gives the total expected profit:\n$$E[\\text{Defect}] = 45 + 8 = 53$$\nThe calculated expected profit is $53$ million dollars.

This problem [@problem_id:1891892] introduces an agent-based model where a forager's choice is influenced by a social conformity bias, making a shared resource more attractive simply because others are using it. By finding the behavioral equilibrium of the population, you will discover how this social feedback can amplify the tragedy, leading to an over-concentration of individuals on a shared patch even when it yields a lower payoff than a private alternative.", "problem": "A population of $N$ foraging agents must choose between two resource patches, Patch P and Patch S.\n\n- **Patch P (Private):** Any agent foraging here is guaranteed a personal resource payoff of $R_p$. This payoff is independent of how many other agents choose this patch.\n- **Patch S (Shared):** This patch contains a total of $R_s$ units of resource. If $n$ agents choose to forage here, they divide the resource equally, so each receives a payoff of $R_s/n$.\n\nThe agents' choice is driven by a concept called \"attractiveness\". The population reaches a behavioral equilibrium when the attractiveness of both patches is equal. The attractiveness of each patch is defined as follows:\n\n- The attractiveness of the private patch, $A_p$, is simply its guaranteed payoff: $A_p = R_p$.\n- The attractiveness of the shared patch, $A_s$, depends on both its resource payoff and a social conformity bias. Let $x$ be the fraction of the population foraging in Patch S (so $n = xN$). The attractiveness is given by the function:\n  $$A_s(x) = \\left( \\frac{R_s}{xN} \\right) (1 + \\alpha x)$$\n  where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless coefficient representing the strength of the social conformity bias.
