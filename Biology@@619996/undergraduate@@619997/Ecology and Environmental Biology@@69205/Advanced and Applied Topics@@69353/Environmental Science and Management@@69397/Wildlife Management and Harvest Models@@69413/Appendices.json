It is calculated by summing the contributions from each age class: $R_0 = \\sum l_x m_x$. The individual term for each age class, $l_x m_x$, represents the average number of female offspring produced by a female at that specific age, accounting for the probability she survives to that age. A logical harvesting strategy to minimize demographic impact is to target the age class which contributes the least to the overall $R_0$.\n\nUsing the life table data provided, identify the reproductive age class (i.e., any age class $x$ where $m_x > 0$) that should be targeted for harvest.
