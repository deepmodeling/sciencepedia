The age structure—the distribution of individuals across different age groups—carries a powerful \"demographic momentum\" from past conditions.

The model advances in discrete 25-year time steps.\n\nThe rules for population projection over one 25-year cycle are as follows:\n1.  All individuals in the post-reproductive cohort (50-74) at the beginning of a cycle are assumed to have passed away by the end of the cycle.\n2.  The number of individuals in the new reproductive cohort (25-49) is equal to the number of individuals from the previous pre-reproductive cohort (0-24) who survive.

The number of births is determined by the reproductive cohort (25-49). Assume a constant 1:1 sex ratio across all age groups.\n\nBoth countries currently have an identical Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 children per woman. The TFR represents the average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime if she experienced the current age-specific fertility rates.
