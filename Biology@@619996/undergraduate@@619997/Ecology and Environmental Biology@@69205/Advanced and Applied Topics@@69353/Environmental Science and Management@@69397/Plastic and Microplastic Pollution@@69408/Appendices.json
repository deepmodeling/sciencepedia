While general concerns about environmental issues like plastic pollution are important, science demands specificity.

They observe that sea turtles are often found entangled in plastic debris or with plastic fragments in their digestive systems. This leads them to ask the general question: \"Is plastic pollution bad for sea turtles?\"\n\nIn the scientific method, a general question must be refined into a specific, testable hypothesis. A testable hypothesis is a falsifiable statement that proposes a clear relationship between an independent variable (a measurable cause) and a dependent variable (a measurable effect).\n\nFrom the options below, select the statement that best reformulates the ecologist's general question into a scientifically rigorous and testable hypothesis.\n\nA. Juvenile green sea turtles (*Chelonia mydas*) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics in their food will exhibit a significantly lower mean body mass gain over a three-month period compared to a control group with no microplastic exposure.\n\nB. Plastic pollution in the oceans creates an unhealthy and dangerous environment for all sea turtle species.\n\nC. If we analyze the stomach contents of 50 stranded deceased loggerhead sea turtles, we will find that more than half contain plastic fragments.\n\nD. The increasing amount of oceanic plastic debris is correlated with a decline in the overall health of global sea turtle populations.\n\nE. Urgent action must be taken to reduce plastic waste in order to protect sea turtles from suffering and extinction.", "solution": "We start by recalling the criteria for a scientifically rigorous, testable hypothesis: it must be falsifiable, specify an independent variable (manipulated or categorized cause), a dependent variable (measured effect), a defined population or system, clear operational definitions, and preferably a comparison or control.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria:\n\n- Option A specifies the independent variable (exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics in food), the dependent variable (mean body mass gain over a defined three-month period), a defined population (juvenile green sea turtles), a control group (no microplastic exposure), and a clear, falsifiable comparison (significantly lower mean body mass gain). This directly operationalizes both cause and effect and is experimentally testable.\n\n- Option B is overly broad and non-operationalized. Terms like “unhealthy and dangerous” are vague; it generalizes across all sea turtle species and does not define measurable variables or a test design. It is not a precise, testable hypothesis.\n\n- Option C is testable and falsifiable as a prevalence claim (more than half of 50 stranded deceased loggerheads contain plastic fragments), but it is descriptive rather than causal. It does not specify an independent variable causing a change in a measurable health outcome; it only reports expected frequency in a selected sample (stranded carcasses), which also introduces potential sampling bias. It does not directly test the ecological harm question.\n\n- Option D proposes a correlation but is vague: “overall health” is not operationally defined and “global sea turtle populations” is too broad. While correlation is testable in principle, the lack of specified measures makes it insufficiently rigorous for a hypothesis as stated.\n\n- Option E is a normative policy statement (“urgent action must be taken”) and not a testable hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, Option A best reformulates the general question into a specific, falsifiable, and experimentally testable hypothesis with clearly defined independent and dependent variables, a control, and a specified timeframe and population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1891135"}, {"introduction": "After formulating a hypothesis, ecologists must gather data, often by estimating the scale of a problem from limited samples.

We are given that the clam starts with no microplastics, so the initial condition is $N(0) = 0$.\n\nWe can model the change in the number of particles from one day to the next by setting up a recurrence relation. The number of particles at the end of day $t$, denoted as $N(t)$, is equal to the number of particles at the end of the previous day, $N(t-1)$, plus the number of particles ingested during day $t$, minus the number of particles excreted during day $t$.\n\nThe number of ingested particles during any day is a constant, $I$.\nThe number of excreted particles during day $t$ is a fraction $k$ of the particle load at the beginning of that day. The particle load at the beginning of day $t$ is the same as the load at the end of day $t-1$, which is $N(t-1)$.
