Epidemiologists model the spread of this disease using a framework where the basic reproductive number, $R_0$, determines the potential for an epidemic. This number represents the average count of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population.\n\nIn the initial phase of the outbreak, it is determined that an infected person has an average of $c = 12$ contacts per day. The probability of transmission upon contact with an infected individual is $p = 0.03$. The average duration for which an individual remains infectious is $D = 10$ days.\n\nIn response to the threat, the island's health authority implements a two-pronged public health strategy. First, a mandatory social distancing policy is enforced, which successfully reduces the average number of daily contacts per person by $40\\%$. Second, a newly developed antiviral medication is distributed, which reduces the average infectious period to $D' = 6$ days.\n\nAssuming the probability of transmission per contact, $p$, remains unchanged, calculate the new basic reproductive number, $R_0'$, under these combined interventions.

A key moment in any epidemic is its peak, the point where the number of infected individuals is at its maximum. This exercise reveals a crucial, non-intuitive insight from the SIR model: the epidemic peaks not when all susceptibles are gone, but when the susceptible population drops to a specific threshold determined by the transmission and recovery rates. Analyzing this condition helps you understand the interplay between the susceptible and infected compartments and the underlying mechanics that cause an epidemic to turn the corner [@problem_id:1838849].", "problem": "A conservation team is studying the outbreak of a non-lethal virus in an isolated island population of 6000 Quokkas.

The constant of proportionality, known as the transmission parameter, is $\\alpha = 0.0001$ per Quokka per day. Infected individuals recover and gain lifelong immunity at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals, with a recovery rate constant of $\\gamma = 0.05$ per day.
