The owl hunts from a tall, centrally located perch and relies on the faint rustling sounds made by the mice to locate them.\n\nThe detection of prey is modeled based on a critical signal-to-noise ratio. Specifically, an owl can successfully pinpoint a mouse's location only if the sound level of the mouse, $L_{\\text{prey}}$, is greater than the surrounding background noise level, $L_{\\text{noise}}$, by a certain minimum amount.

The goal is to preserve the \"active space\" of a forest songbird, defined as the region where its territorial call can be successfully detected by a conspecific.\n\nThe sound propagation model for the bird's call within the forest is as follows: The Sound Pressure Level (SPL) of the call, which is $L_S = 90$ dB at a reference distance of 1 meter from the bird, attenuates with distance $d$ (in meters). The SPL at a distance $d$ from the singing bird, $L_{signal}(d)$, is given by:\n$$L_{signal}(d) = L_S - 20\\log_{10}(d) - \\alpha_{forest}d$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{forest} = 0.1$ dB/m is the excess attenuation coefficient due to scattering and absorption by the forest environment.

In the absence of any mitigation, it creates a uniform background SPL of $L_{B,0} = 70$ dB throughout the area of the forest under study.

This vegetation provides an additional attenuation of $\\alpha_{veg} = 0.5$ dB/m to the incoming highway noise.
