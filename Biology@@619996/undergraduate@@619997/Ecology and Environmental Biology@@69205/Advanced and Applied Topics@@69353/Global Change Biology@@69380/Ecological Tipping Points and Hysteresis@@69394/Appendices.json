The forest thrives on a shoreline that has a uniform, gentle inland slope of angle $\\alpha$. The survival of the mangrove species is restricted to the intertidal zone, which is the land area between the Mean Low Water (MLW) and Mean High Water (MHW) elevations. The vertical distance from the Mean Sea Level (MSL) to both MHW and MLW is given by the tidal amplitude, $A$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the MSL is at a reference elevation of zero. Due to climate change, the MSL is rising at a constant rate $R$. To protect inland development, a vertical, immovable seawall was built along the coast. The base of this seawall is at a fixed elevation $Z_0$ relative to the MSL at $t=0$. The seawall prevents the mangrove forest from migrating further inland, meaning no part of the ecosystem can exist at an elevation greater than $Z_0$.\n\nAssuming the mangrove forest collapses when its required intertidal habitat is entirely \"squeezed out\" between the rising sea and the fixed seawall, derive a symbolic expression for the time, $t_{collapse}$, at which the mangrove habitat completely disappears.", "solution": "Let the vertical elevation datum be the Mean Sea Level (MSL) at time $t=0$, so $\\text{MSL}(0)=0$.
