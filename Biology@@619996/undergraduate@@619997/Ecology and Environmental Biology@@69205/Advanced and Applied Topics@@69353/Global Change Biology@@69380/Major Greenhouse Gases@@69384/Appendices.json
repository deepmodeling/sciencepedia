This exercise highlights the practical challenges and trade-offs involved in developing sustainable agricultural practices.", "problem": "An agricultural research team is studying methods to mitigate methane ($CH_4$) emissions from rice paddies. They compare two water management strategies over a 120-day growing season: Continuous Flooding (CF) and Intermittent Drainage (ID).\n\nFor the **Continuous Flooding (CF)** strategy, the methane flux, $F_{CF}(t)$, is modeled by a symmetric triangular function of time. The flux starts at zero, linearly increases to a peak value of $A_{CF} = 320 \\text{ mg m}^{-2} \\text{ day}^{-1}$ at mid-season ($t = 60$ days), and then linearly decreases back to zero at the end of the growing season ($T = 120$ days). This strategy results in a rice yield of $Y_{CF} = 6.4 \\text{ tonnes per hectare}$.\n\nFor the **Intermittent Drainage (ID)** strategy, the field is drained for two 15-day periods (from $t=30$ to $t=45$ days, and from $t=75$ to $t=90$ days). During the flooded periods, the methane flux, $F_{ID}(t)$, follows a similar triangular pattern but with a lower peak flux of $A_{ID} = 280 \\text{ mg m}^{-2} \\text{ day}^{-1}$ at $t=60$ days. During the two drainage periods, the flux is replaced by a constant methane uptake (net consumption) at a rate of $F_{uptake} = 25 \\text{ mg m}^{-2} \\text{ day}^{-1}$. This strategy results in a slightly lower rice yield of $Y_{ID} = 6.1 \\text{ tonnes per hectare}$.\n\nThe environmental performance of each strategy can be quantified by its Yield-Scaled Methane Emission (YSME), defined as the total mass of methane emitted over the growing season per unit mass of rice harvested.\n\nCalculate the fractional reduction in YSME achieved by switching from the CF strategy to the ID strategy. Express this reduction as a dimensionless decimal value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the fractional reduction in Yield-Scaled Methane Emission (YSME), which is given by:\n$$ f = \\frac{YSME_{CF} - YSME_{ID}}{YSME_{CF}} = 1 - \\frac{YSME_{ID}}{YSME_{CF}} $$\nThe YSME is defined as the total methane emission per unit area ($M_{total}$) divided by the rice yield per unit area ($Y_{total}$).\n$$ YSME = \\frac{M_{total}}{Y_{total}} $$\nSo, the fractional reduction can be written as:\n$$ f = 1 - \\frac{M_{ID}/Y_{ID}}{M_{CF}/Y_{CF}} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{M_{ID}}{M_{CF}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{Y_{CF}}{Y_{ID}}\\right) $$\nWe need to calculate the total methane emissions for both strategies, $M_{CF}$ and $M_{ID}$.

We can calculate the total emission during the flooded periods and subtract the total uptake during the drained periods.\nThe emission during flooded periods is the area of the main triangle (with peak $A_{ID}$) minus the hypothetical emissions that would have occurred during the drainage periods.\nHypothetical total emission for a full triangle with peak $A_{ID}$:\n$$ M_{triangle, ID} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times T \\times A_{ID} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 \\times 280 = 16800 \\text{ mg m}^{-2} $$\nThe flux on the rising slope ($0 \\le t \\le 60$) is $F(t) = \\frac{A_{ID}}{60}t = \\frac{280}{60}t = \\frac{14}{3}t$.\nThe flux on the falling slope ($60 < t \\le 120$) is $F(t) = A_{ID} - \\frac{A_{ID}}{60}(t-60) = 560 - \\frac{14}{3}t$.\n\nHypothetical emission during the first drainage period ($t \\in [30, 45]$):\n$$ M_{missed, 1} = \\int_{30}^{45} \\frac{14}{3}t \\,dt = \\frac{14}{3} \\left[\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right]_{30}^{45} = \\frac{7}{3}(45^2 - 30^2) = \\frac{7}{3}(2025 - 900) = \\frac{7}{3}(1125) = 2625 \\text{ mg m}^{-2} $$\nDue to symmetry, the hypothetical emission during the second drainage period ($t \\in [75, 90]$) is the same: $M_{missed, 2} = 2625 \\text{ mg m}^{-2}$.\nSo, the total emission during the flooded portions of the ID strategy is:\n$$ M_{flooded, ID} = M_{triangle, ID} - M_{missed, 1} - M_{missed, 2} = 16800 - 2625 - 2625 = 11550 \\text{ mg m}^{-2} $$\nDuring the two 15-day drainage periods, there is a net methane uptake.
