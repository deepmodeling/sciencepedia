Acidification not only lowers the pH of lake water but also mobilizes toxic aluminum ions ($Al^{3+}$) from the surrounding soil and sediment.

This problem simulates a real-world approach used in environmental management, where diverse data layers are combined to identify the most vulnerable areas. By calculating an Aquatic Acidification Vulnerability Index from weighted scores for deposition, soil type, land use, and slope, you will learn how complex information is synthesized into a practical tool for risk assessment and conservation planning [@problem_id:1829411].", "problem": "An environmental consulting firm is tasked with assessing the potential impact of acid deposition on a nearby aquatic ecosystem from a proposed industrial facility. To quantify the risk, they use a simplified model analogous to a Geographic Information System (GIS) weighted overlay analysis. This model calculates an Aquatic Acidification Vulnerability Index (AAVI) for each sub-catchment in the region. The AAVI is a dimensionless value between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate greater vulnerability to acidification.\n\nThe AAVI is defined as a weighted sum of four normalized factor scores:\n$$\n\\text{AAVI} = W_D S_D + W_B S_B + W_L S_L + W_S S_S\n$$\nwhere `W` represents the weight of each factor and `S` is the normalized score for that factor. The subscripts denote Deposition (D), soil Buffering capacity (B), Land use (L), and Slope (S).\n\nFor the sub-catchment under investigation, the weights have been assigned by experts as follows:\n-   Deposition weight, $W_D = 0.40$\n-   Buffering capacity weight, $W_B = 0.30$\n-   Land use weight, $W_L = 0.20$\n-   Slope weight, $W_S = 0.10$\n\nYou are provided with the following data for the sub-catchment and the formulas to calculate each normalized score (S):\n\n1.  **Deposition Score ($S_D$)**: The projected annual sulfate deposition, $D$, is $22.0 \\text{ kg ha}^{-1} \\text{yr}^{-1}$. The score is normalized based on a regional reference range from a minimum of $D_{\\text{min}} = 4.0 \\text{ kg ha}^{-1} \\text{yr}^{-1}$ to a maximum of $D_{\\text{max}} = 34.0 \\text{ kg ha}^{-1} \\text{yr}^{-1}$. The score is calculated as $S_D = \\frac{D - D_{\\text{min}}}{D_{\\text{max}} - D_{\\text{min}}}$.\n\n2.  **Buffering Capacity Score ($S_B$)**: The average soil Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) is $9.0 \\text{ meq/100g}$. High CEC indicates a strong ability to neutralize acid, thus low vulnerability. The score is therefore inverted during normalization. The regional range for this soil type is from a highly sensitive $CEC_{\\text{min}} = 3.0 \\text{ meq/100g}$ to a well-buffered $CEC_{\\text{max}} = 21.0 \\text{ meq/100g}$.

Each land use has an associated dimensionless acidification coefficient ($C_L$): $C_L(\\text{coniferous}) = 0.85$, $C_L(\\text{deciduous}) = 0.40$, and $C_L(\\text{pasture}) = 0.25$.
