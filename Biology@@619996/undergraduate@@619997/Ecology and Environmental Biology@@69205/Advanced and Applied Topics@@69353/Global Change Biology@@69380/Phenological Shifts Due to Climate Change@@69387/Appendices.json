Let's define \"phenological asynchrony\" as the absolute difference in days between the day of peak pollinator emergence and the day of peak flowering. All days are counted starting from January 1st as day 1.\n\nHistorical field studies conducted over a decade from 1980 to 1989 found that the mean day of peak bee emergence was day 142, and the mean day of peak lily flowering was also day 142.\n\nA recent set of studies from 2015 to 2024 revealed new phenological patterns.

This can be calculated by finding the change in asynchrony and dividing it by the number of years that have passed between the midpoints of the observation windows.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and given data.\nThe first study period is from 1980 to 1989. The midpoint of this period is $\\frac{1980 + 1989}{2} = 1984.5$.\nThe historical mean day of peak bee emergence, $B_{hist}$, is day 142.\nThe historical mean day of peak lily flowering, $F_{hist}$, is day 142.\n\nThe second study period is from 2015 to 2024.

Phenological asynchrony, $A$, is defined as the absolute difference between the peak emergence day and the peak flowering day.\n\nFor the historical period (1980-1989), the asynchrony $A_{hist}$ is:\n$$A_{hist} = |B_{hist} - F_{hist}|$$\n$$A_{hist} = |142 - 142| = 0 \\text{ days}$$\nThis indicates perfect synchrony in the historical period.\n\nFor the modern period (2015-2024), the asynchrony $A_{mod}$ is:\n$$A_{mod} = |B_{mod} - F_{mod}|$$\n$$A_{mod} = |136 - 129| = 7 \\text{ days}$$\nThis indicates a mismatch of 7 days in the modern period.\n\nThe total change in asynchrony, $\\Delta A$, is the difference between the modern and historical asynchrony values:\n$$\\Delta A = A_{mod} - A_{hist}$$\n$$\\Delta A = 7 \\text{ days} - 0 \\text{ days} = 7 \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe average rate of change in phenological asynchrony is this total change divided by the time duration $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\text{Rate of change} = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}$$\n$$\\text{Rate of change} = \\frac{7 \\text{ days}}{35 \\text{ years}} = 0.2 \\text{ days/year}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

This practice connects phenology to physiology by modeling how an unseasonable warm spell can trick an animal's metabolism, leaving it vulnerable to a sudden cold snap.

However, a prolonged, unseasonably warm spell in mid-winter tricks its physiology into de-acclimatizing completely to its summer state, resetting its BMR to $B_{summer}$. Immediately following this de-acclimatization, a severe arctic front moves in, causing the ambient temperature to plummet to $T_{ambient} = -10.0 \\text{ °C}$. A concurrent blizzard traps the vole in its subnivean burrow, making foraging impossible.
