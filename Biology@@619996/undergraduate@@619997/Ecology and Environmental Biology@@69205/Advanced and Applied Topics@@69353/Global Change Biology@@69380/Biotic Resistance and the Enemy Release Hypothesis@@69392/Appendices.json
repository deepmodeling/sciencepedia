To test a potential mechanism for its success, the ecologist conducts a comparative study. The study is based on the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH), which posits that invasive species can become more abundant in an introduced range because they have escaped the specialized natural enemies (such as herbivores and pathogens) found in their native range.\n\nThe ecologist randomly samples 150 individual *C. arietis* plants from its native range in Spain and 150 individuals from its introduced range in Oregon, USA. For each plant, the presence or absence of leaf damage from insect herbivores is recorded.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- In the native range (Spain), 117 of the 150 sampled plants showed evidence of insect herbivore damage.\n- In the introduced range (Oregon), 39 of the 150 sampled plants showed evidence of insect herbivore damage.\n\nBased on these findings, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported by the data?\n\nA. The data refute the Enemy Release Hypothesis.\n\nB. The data support the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis, which suggests native communities resist invaders.\n\nC.

To disentangle the reasons for its success, the ecologist conducts a common garden experiment in both the native range (Patagonia) and the introduced range (California).\n\nIn each location, two groups of Sunstone Daisy seedlings are planted. One group is left exposed to the environment (Uncaged), while the other group is protected from all herbivores, from insects to mammals, by a mesh cage (Caged). After one growing season, the average final dry biomass per plant is measured for each of the four experimental treatments. The results are as follows:\n\n*   **Native Range (Patagonia):**\n    *   Uncaged plants: 45.0 g\n    *   Caged plants: 135.0 g\n\n*   **Introduced Range (California):**\n    *   Uncaged plants: 240.0 g\n    *   Caged plants: 285.0 g\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are being tested: the Favorable Climate Hypothesis, which posits that the new environment is intrinsically better for growth, and the Enemy Release Hypothesis, which suggests success is due to escaping natural enemies from the native range.\n\nTo evaluate the relative contributions of these two factors, calculate the ratio of the \"Climatic Advantage\" to the \"Enemy Release Advantage.\" The Climatic Advantage is defined as the increase in potential plant biomass (i.e., when protected from enemies) due to the more favorable conditions in the introduced range.
