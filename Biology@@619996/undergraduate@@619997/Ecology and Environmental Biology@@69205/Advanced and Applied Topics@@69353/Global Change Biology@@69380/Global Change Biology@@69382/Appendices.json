To investigate the underlying biophysical principles, consider an idealized spherical mammal, the \"cryospheroid,\" which maintains a constant internal body temperature.\n\nThe cryospheroid's basal metabolic rate, which generates heat, is directly proportional to its body mass (and thus its volume). The rate at which it loses heat to the environment is governed by principles of thermal convection and is proportional to its body's surface area and the difference between its core body temperature and the ambient temperature. Assume the animal has evolutionarily adapted to its environment to maintain thermal equilibrium, where heat generation perfectly balances heat loss.\n\nA particular population of cryospheroids has an average body radius of $r_1 = 15.0$ cm and maintains a constant core body temperature of $T_{body} = 37.0^\\circ\\text{C}$.
