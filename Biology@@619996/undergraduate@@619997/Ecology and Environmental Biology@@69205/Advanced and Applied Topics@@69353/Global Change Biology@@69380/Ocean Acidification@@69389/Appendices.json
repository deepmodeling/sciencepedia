To understand this process quantitatively, we can use a simplified model that relates the atmospheric partial pressure of $CO_2$ to the pH of surface seawater.\n\nThe model consists of the following relationships:\n1.  The concentration of dissolved aqueous carbon dioxide, $[CO_2(aq)]$, is governed by Henry's Law: $[CO_2(aq)] = k_H \\cdot P_{CO_2}$, where $P_{CO_2}$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere.\n2.  The hydrogen ion concentration in seawater, $[H^+]$, is related to the dissolved $CO_2$ by the formula: $[H^+]^2 = K_{eff} \\cdot [CO_2(aq)]$.

The base of this food web is a species of calcifying coccolithophore, a type of phytoplankton. This primary producer is the sole food source for a species of copepod, a primary consumer.\n\nThe ability of the coccolithophore to form its calcium carbonate plates is limited by the availability of carbonate ions ($CO_3^{2-}$) in the seawater. The concentration of these ions, denoted as $[CO_3^{2-}]$, is empirically observed to be related to the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide, $pCO_2$, by the following relationship:\n$$[CO_3^{2-}] = \\frac{A}{pCO_2}$$\nwhere $[CO_3^{2-}]$ is measured in micromoles per kilogram of seawater ($\\mu\\text{mol/kg}$), $pCO_2$ is in parts per million (ppm), and $A$ is an environmental constant equal to $70,000 \\, \\mu\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{ppm} / \\text{kg}$.\n\nThe Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of the coccolithophore population depends on the carbonate ion concentration.

In turn, the carrying capacity of the copepod population, $K_{copepod}$, is directly proportional to the biomass of its food source, the coccolithophores.\n\nIn the pre-industrial era, the atmospheric $pCO_2$ was 280 ppm. In a projected future scenario, this value is expected to double to 560 ppm.
