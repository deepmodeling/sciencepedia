These aggregates can become mobile hotspots for biogeochemical processes, such as denitrification, if an anoxic (oxygen-free) microenvironment develops within them, even while sinking through an oxygenated water column.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a single, spherical marine snow aggregate of radius $R$. The aggregate is in a steady state, sinking through water with a constant and uniform dissolved oxygen concentration of $C_w$. Oxygen diffuses from the surrounding water into the aggregate with an effective diffusion coefficient $D$. Throughout the volume of the aggregate, uniformly distributed aerobic bacteria consume oxygen. This consumption is modeled as a zero-order reaction, meaning oxygen is consumed at a constant rate per unit volume, $A_0$, as long as the local oxygen concentration is greater than zero.\n\nDetermine the critical radius, $R_{crit}$, of the aggregate, which is the minimum radius required for the oxygen concentration at the very center of the particle to drop to zero.

Let $C(r)$ be the concentration of oxygen at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the aggregate. The governing differential equation for this process combines Fick's law of diffusion with a zero-order reaction term (consumption rate $A_0$). In spherical coordinates and at steady state, this equation is:\n$$ D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = A_0 $$\nThis equation is valid for $0 \\le r \\le R$, where $R$ is the radius of the aggregate.\n\nWe need to solve this second-order ordinary differential equation subject to two boundary conditions.\n1. At the surface of the aggregate ($r=R$), the oxygen concentration is equal to that of the surrounding water: $C(R) = C_w$.\n2. Due to the spherical symmetry of the problem, the concentration profile must be flat at the center, which means there is no flux through the center. Thus, the concentration gradient at $r=0$ must be zero: $\\left. \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right|_{r=0} = 0$.\n\nLet's solve the differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{A_0}{D} r^2 $$\nIntegrating once with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{A_0}{3D} r^3 + K_1 $$\nwhere $K_1$ is the first integration constant.
