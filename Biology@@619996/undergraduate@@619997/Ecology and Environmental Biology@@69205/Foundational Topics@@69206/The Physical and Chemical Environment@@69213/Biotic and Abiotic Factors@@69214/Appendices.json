The goal is to determine the optimal water velocity for foraging. The larva's energy acquisition and expenditure are modeled based on the following principles:\n\n1.  **Energy Gain**: The rate at which the larva gains energy from food particles caught in its silk net, denoted as $P_{gain}$, is directly proportional to the water velocity, $v$. This relationship is given by the equation $P_{gain}(v) = A v$, where $A$ is a coefficient that combines the food particle density in the water, the net's capture area, and the energy content of the food.\n\n2.  **Energy Cost**: The larva has a constant baseline metabolic power consumption, $P_{cost}$, which is the energy required per unit time for basic life-sustaining functions, independent of the water velocity.\n\n3.  **Net Longevity**: The silk net degrades due to the mechanical stress of the flowing water. Its operational lifetime, $T_{life}$, decreases as the velocity increases. This is modeled by the function $T_{life}(v) = T_{max} \\exp(-v/v_c)$, where $T_{max}$ is the theoretical maximum lifetime of the net in perfectly still water, and $v_c$ is a characteristic velocity that quantifies the net's resistance to wear.\n\nThe larva's foraging strategy is assumed to maximize the total net energy, $E_{net}$, acquired over the lifespan of a single net. The total net energy is the net power gain during foraging multiplied by the operational lifetime of the net.\n\nGiven the following empirically determined parameters:\n-   Gain coefficient, $A = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4}$ J/m\n-   Baseline metabolic power, $P_{cost} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-5}$ J/s\n-   Characteristic velocity, $v_c = 0.200$ m/s\n-   Maximum net lifetime, $T_{max} = 1.80 \\times 10^5$ s\n\nDetermine the optimal water velocity, $v_{opt}$, at which the caddisfly larva should forage.
