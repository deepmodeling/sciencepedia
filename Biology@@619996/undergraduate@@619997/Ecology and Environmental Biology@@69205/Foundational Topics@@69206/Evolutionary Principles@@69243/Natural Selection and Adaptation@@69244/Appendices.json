This first exercise explores a key scenario known as heterozygote advantage, or overdominance, where individuals with two different alleles ($Aa$) have higher fitness than individuals with two identical alleles ($AA$ or $aa$). This type of selection is a powerful force for maintaining genetic diversity and is illustrated here through the practical and important example of pesticide resistance in an agricultural pest population [@problem_id:1866175]. By working through this problem, you will practice the fundamental skill of calculating stable allele frequencies at equilibrium, a cornerstone of population genetics.", "problem": "A population of agricultural pests is exposed to a newly developed pesticide. Resistance to this pesticide is primarily controlled by a single gene with two alleles, $A$ and $a$. Extensive field and laboratory studies have determined the relative fitness of the three possible genotypes in this new environment. The fitness of the homozygous dominant genotype ($AA$) is taken as the baseline, $W_{AA} = 1.0$. The heterozygous genotype ($Aa$) exhibits the highest fitness with $W_{Aa} = 1.2$, as it provides sufficient resistance without a significant metabolic cost. The homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) is highly susceptible to the pesticide, resulting in a lower relative fitness of $W_{aa} = 0.8$.\n\nInitially, the frequency of the $a$ allele in the population is $0.5$. The population is large, and mating is random. After many generations of consistent exposure to the pesticide, the allele frequencies in the population stabilize.\n\nCalculate the final, stable frequency of the $a$ allele in this population.

Under random mating, the genotype frequencies before selection are $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$ for $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively. With relative fitnesses $W_{AA}$, $W_{Aa}$, and $W_{aa}$, the mean fitness is\n$$\\overline{W}=p^{2}W_{AA}+2pqW_{Aa}+q^{2}W_{aa}.$$\nThe allele frequency after selection is\n$$p'=\\frac{p^{2}W_{AA}+pqW_{Aa}}{\\overline{W}}.$$\nAt equilibrium, $p'=p$.

Recently, a new plant species with a large, tough-husked fruit has become the most abundant food source on the island. Only parrots with a sufficiently strong bite force can crack these new fruits. This has imposed a strong selective pressure on the population.\n\nField biologists and geneticists have collected the following data on the parrot population before the first generation of selection:\n- The mean bite force for the entire population was 110 N, with a phenotypic standard deviation of 12 N.\n- The mean beak agility for the entire population was 52 seeds/minute, with a phenotypic standard deviation of 6 seeds/minute.\n\nAfter one generation, it was observed that only the parrots capable of cracking the new, tough fruits successfully raised offspring.
