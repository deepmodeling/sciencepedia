To untangle this classic puzzle, ecologists use common garden experiments, where individuals from different populations are raised in a single, controlled environment. This practice challenges you to analyze the results from a hypothetical common garden study and draw conclusions about the relative contributions of genetic differentiation and environmental influence on phenotypic traits [@problem_id:1871552].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a species of wildflower, *Delphinium decorum*, which is found in two distinct habitats: high-altitude alpine meadows and lower-altitude montane valleys. In their native environments, the average mature height of the alpine population is 10 cm, while the average mature height of the valley population is 45 cm. The ecologist wants to determine whether this significant height difference is a result of genetic adaptation to local conditions (genetic differentiation) or a direct response to the different environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity).\n\nTo investigate this, the ecologist performs a common garden experiment. Seeds are collected from both the alpine and valley populations. These seeds are then planted together in a controlled greenhouse environment that mimics intermediate conditions. After the plants reach full maturity, their heights are measured. The results are as follows:\n\n-   Plants grown from alpine seeds had an average height of 32 cm.\n-   Plants grown from valley seeds had an average height of 38 cm.\n\nBased on the results of this common garden experiment, which of the following conclusions is the most scientifically sound?\n\nA. The observed height difference in the wild is entirely due to genetic differentiation between the two populations.\n\nB. The observed height difference in the wild is entirely due to phenotypic plasticity.\n\nC. The observed height difference in the wild is due to a combination of both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation.\n\nD. The experimental design is invalid because the greenhouse conditions do not match either of the native habitats.\n\nE. No conclusion can be drawn because the heights in the greenhouse are different from the heights in the wild.", "solution": "We formalize the phenotype of height as the sum of genetic and environmental contributions, possibly including genotype-by-environment interaction, so that for mean height we can write\n$$\nP = G + E + G \\times E.\n$$\nIn a common garden experiment, the environmental component $E$ is held constant across genotypes, and any genotype-by-environment interaction $G \\times E$ is minimized or made equal across the compared genotypes in that single environment. Therefore, differences in mean phenotype between populations observed in the common garden primarily reflect genetic differentiation in height.\n\nIf the height difference in the wild were entirely due to genetic differentiation, we would expect a consistent difference to persist in the common garden, potentially of similar magnitude across environments if $G \\times E$ is small. If the height difference in the wild were entirely due to phenotypic plasticity (environmental effects), then when grown under the same greenhouse conditions, the two populations should have the same mean height.\n\nThe observed common garden results show that plants from alpine seeds average 32 cm and plants from valley seeds average 38 cm in the same greenhouse environment. The persistence of a difference of 6 cm under identical conditions indicates a genetic component. However, the large reduction in the difference from the wild (from 35 cm in nature to 6 cm in the common garden) indicates that environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity) also substantially contribute to the wild height difference.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound conclusion is that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation contribute to the observed height difference in the wild.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because the common garden shows a large reduction in difference, implicating environment.\n- B is incorrect because a difference remains under identical conditions, implicating genetics.\n- C is correct for the reasons above.\n- D is incorrect because a common garden need not match native habitats; it must control the environment across genotypes.\n- E is incorrect because the common garden difference is informative about genetic differentiation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1871552"}, {"introduction": "Beyond interpreting data, a critical skill for any scientist is designing experiments that can robustly test a hypothesis. This scenario asks you to step into the role of a research designer and evaluate several potential approaches for distinguishing between heritable evolutionary change (local adaptation) and non-heritable plasticity (acclimation).

Population C lives in a spring-fed creek with a stable, cool water temperature of 18 °C. Population W lives in a downstream pond that has experienced a gradual temperature increase, with its average water temperature rising from 18 °C to 24 °C over the last 50 years. The ecologist observes that wild-caught adult fish from the warmer pond (Population W) have a significantly higher Critical Thermal Maximum (CT_max), the lethal high temperature, than fish from the cool creek (Population C). This enhanced heat tolerance in Population W could be the result of heritable evolutionary change (local adaptation) or non-heritable phenotypic plasticity (acclimation).\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs would be the most direct and robust method to distinguish between these two possibilities as the primary cause for the observed difference in CT_max between the populations?\n\nA.

After one month, measure their respective CT_max.", "solution": "Goal: Determine whether the higher CT_max observed in Population W is primarily due to heritable genetic differences (local adaptation) or non-heritable phenotypic plasticity (acclimation).\n\nPrinciple to apply: A common garden experiment using offspring from both populations raised under identical conditions isolates genetic effects from environmental and acclimatory effects. By rearing the F1 generation (to control for parental environmental history and maternal effects) from both populations in the same laboratory environment and then measuring CT_max at maturity, any persistent differences in CT_max can be attributed to heritable genetic differences. If differences disappear under common rearing, then the original divergence was due to phenotypic plasticity.\n\nStep-by-step evaluation of options:\n\n- Option A: Raise newly-hatched F1 from both populations in a common laboratory environment at the same temperature until maturity, then measure CT_max. This is a direct common garden test. If CT_max differences persist, that supports local adaptation (heritable genetic divergence). If CT_max converges, that supports phenotypic plasticity. Using F1 reduces confounding by parental acclimation and maternal effects. This is the most direct and robust approach among the choices.\n\n- Option B: Continued field monitoring of wild CT_max cannot disentangle genetic change from ongoing acclimation because environmental covariates and plasticity remain confounded with genotype. It provides trend data but not causal inference.\n\n- Option C: Acclimating wild-caught adults from the warm habitat to a cooler temperature for a month tests short-term reversible plasticity in adults, but it does not eliminate developmental plasticity or parental effects and does not symmetrically test both populations. A lack of full convergence could reflect incomplete acclimation time, irreversible developmental effects, or genetic differences; hence it is not definitive.\n\n- Option D: Sequencing a neutral mitochondrial gene assesses neutral population structure, not the genetic basis of heat tolerance. Neutral divergence or lack thereof does not establish local adaptation at loci influencing CT_max.\n\n- Option E: Reciprocal transplant of adults for one month mixes acclimation, stress, and potential selective mortality; it does not isolate genetic versus plastic causes. Short duration and adult-only transplantation are particularly confounded and less controlled than a laboratory common garden.\n\nConclusion: The common garden rearing of F1 from both populations under identical conditions to maturity, followed by CT_max measurement (Option A), is the most direct and robust method to distinguish local adaptation from phenotypic plasticity for the observed CT_max differences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1953338"}]}
