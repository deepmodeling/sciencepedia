This practice introduces two of the most fundamental concepts in population genetics: relative fitness ($w$) and the selection coefficient ($s$).

Relative fitness, denoted by $w$, measures the survival and reproductive success of a given genotype relative to the most successful genotype in the population. The selection coefficient, denoted by $s$, quantifies the intensity of selection acting against a specific genotype.\n\nConsider a population of insects in an agricultural region where a particular insecticide has recently been introduced. Individuals with the genotype 'rr' are highly susceptible to this insecticide. In this environment, the most successful genotype has its relative fitness normalized to $w_{max} = 1$. Through field studies, evolutionary biologists have determined that the selection coefficient acting against the susceptible genotype 'rr' is $s = 0.0825$.\n\nCalculate the relative fitness, $w$, of the susceptible 'rr' genotype.

This exercise explores the crucial concept of evolutionary trade-offs, where an advantage in one area (like offspring quality) may come at the cost of another (like offspring quantity). By analyzing a hypothetical scenario in sea turtles, you will learn to calculate fitness not as a single number, but as the outcome of a complete life-history strategy, providing a more realistic picture of how natural selection operates [@problem_id:1847387].", "problem": "In a population of endangered leatherback sea turtles, a conservation biologist is studying the evolutionary implications of a newly discovered genetic mutation. The typical, or wild-type, reproductive strategy involves a female laying a large clutch of eggs with a very low probability of any single egg surviving to reproductive adulthood. In contrast, a rare mutant phenotype has emerged. This mutation results in females laying eggs with structurally superior shells, which significantly increases their chances of survival. However, this comes at a metabolic cost, reducing the total number of eggs the female can produce in a clutch.\n\nTo compare the evolutionary success of these two strategies, the biologist has collected the following data for a single representative female of each type over her lifetime reproductive output:\n\n- **Wild-Type Strategy:**\n  - Initial number of eggs laid: $N_{WT} = 1100$\n  - Survival rate from egg to reproductive adult: $S_{WT} = 0.10\\%$\n  - Average lifetime eggs laid by each surviving adult offspring: $E_{WT} = 8000$\n\n- **Mutant Strategy:**\n  - Initial number of eggs laid: $N_{M} = 150$\n  - Survival rate from egg to reproductive adult: $S_{M} = 1.20\\%$\n  - Average lifetime eggs laid by each surviving adult offspring: $E_{M} = 9500$\n\nThe absolute fitness of a genotype in this context is defined as the total number of \"grand-offspring\" (i.e., eggs in the F2 generation) produced by a single P generation female.

The study found that 90 of the marked bold fish and 200 of the marked shy fish had survived the entire season. Furthermore, genetic parentage analysis was performed on the juvenile sunfish population that hatched during the season. This analysis determined the total number of surviving juvenile offspring attributable to the original marked cohorts. The initial group of 150 bold fish produced a total of 630 surviving offspring.
