This first exercise demonstrates how molecular data can reveal \"cryptic species\"—distinct evolutionary lineages that are morphologically identical. By interpreting the branching patterns described from a phylogenetic analysis, you will practice the fundamental skill of identifying and counting evolutionarily distinct groups within a single population [@problem_id:1855693].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying fireflies of the genus *Photinus* within the confines of a single, isolated nature preserve. All fireflies captured in the preserve appear morphologically identical, leading to the initial hypothesis that they represent a single species. To test for the presence of cryptic species (genetically distinct species that look alike), the ecologist collects ten individual fireflies, labeled F1 through F10. A specific segment of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is sequenced for each of these ten individuals.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis is then performed, which reconstructs the evolutionary relationships among these ten individuals. The analysis also includes DNA sequences from three well-documented reference species of *Photinus* that were collected from different continents: *Photinus nova*, *Photinus obscurus*, and *Photinus umbra*. The resulting evolutionary tree, which is a branching diagram that depicts ancestor-descendant relationships, is described by the following topology:\n\n1.  The individuals F1, F5, and F9 form an exclusive group with the reference species *Photinus nova*.\n2.  The individuals F2, F4, F6, and F10 form an exclusive group with the reference species *Photinus obscurus*.\n3.  The individuals F3, F7, and F8 form an exclusive group with the reference species *Photinus umbra*.\n4.  The evolutionary group containing *Photinus nova* and its associated individuals is more closely related to the group containing *Photinus obscurus* and its individuals than either is to the group containing *Photinus umbra*.\n\nIf we define a \"distinct evolutionary lineage\" in the preserve as a unique group of sampled individuals that cluster with one of the distinct reference species, how many distinct *Photinus* evolutionary lineages were found in the sample of ten fireflies from the preserve?", "solution": "Define the set of distinct reference species as $R=\\{\\textit{P. nova},\\ \\textit{P. obscurus},\\ \\textit{P. umbra}\\}$. For each $r\\in R$, let $S_{r}$ denote the subset of sampled individuals $\\{F1,\\ldots,F10\\}$ that cluster exclusively with $r$ in the phylogenetic tree. By the problem statement:\n- $S_{\\textit{P. nova}}=\\{F1,F5,F9\\}$,\n- $S_{\\textit{P. obscurus}}=\\{F2,F4,F6,F10\\}$,\n- $S_{\\textit{P. umbra}}=\\{F3,F7,F8\\}$.\n\nThe problem defines a \"distinct evolutionary lineage\" in the preserve as a unique group of sampled individuals that clusters with one of the distinct reference species. Therefore, the number of distinct lineages is the number of reference species $r\\in R$ for which $|S_{r}|>0$.\n\nCompute the cardinalities: $|S_{\\textit{P. nova}}|=3$, $|S_{\\textit{P. obscurus}}|=4$, and $|S_{\\textit{P. umbra}}|=3$. Since all are positive, the count of distinct lineages is\n$$\nL=\\left|\\{r\\in R:\\ |S_{r}|>0\\}\\right|=3\n$$\nThe additional information that the $\\textit{P. nova}$ group is more closely related to the $\\textit{P. obscurus}$ group than either is to the $\\textit{P. umbra}$ group does not change $L$, because the definition of a lineage here is tied to clustering with each distinct reference species, not to relationships among those species-level clades.\n\nHence, there are $3$ distinct evolutionary lineages among the ten sampled fireflies in the preserve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1855693"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply mapping relationships, phylogenies provide a historical framework for testing hypotheses about how traits evolve over time. This practice introduces the core concept of maximum parsimony, a principle that favors the simplest evolutionary scenario requiring the fewest changes.

Through genetic sequencing, the following evolutionary relationships have been established:\n\nThe group can be divided into two primary lineages, Lineage 1 and Lineage 2, which diverged from a single common ancestor.\n- Lineage 1 consists of three species: *Folium poculum*, *Corolla adhaerens*, and *Stipes glutinosus*. Within this lineage, *Corolla adhaerens* and *Stipes glutinosus* are more closely related to each other than either is to *Folium poculum*.\n- Lineage 2 consists of two species, *Petalus amphora* and *Radix nonvorax*, which are sister species.\n\nThe biologist also observes that some of these species are carnivorous, exhibiting one of two distinct trapping mechanisms:\n- **Flypaper trap**: The leaves are covered in sticky glandular hairs that ensnare insects.

Both the pitcher trap and the flypaper trap are the result of convergent evolution.\n\nE. All observed carnivorous traits evolved from a single carnivorous common ancestor for all five species, followed by a loss of carnivory in *Radix nonvorax*.", "solution": "We first encode the phylogeny described. The five species form two primary clades: Lineage 1 with topology ((*Corolla adhaerens*, *Stipes glutinosus*), *Folium poculum*) and Lineage 2 with topology (*Petalus amphora*, *Radix nonvorax*). Thus the whole tree is a root splitting into these two clades.\n\nWe then map the two trapping mechanisms onto this fixed tree. Observed states:\n- Flypaper trap present in *Corolla adhaerens* and *Stipes glutinosus*; absent in *Folium poculum*, *Petalus amphora*, and *Radix nonvorax*.\n- Pitcher trap present in *Folium poculum* and *Petalus amphora*; absent in *Corolla adhaerens*, *Stipes glutinosus*, and *Radix nonvorax*.\n- *Radix nonvorax* is non-carnivorous.\n\nApply parsimony, counting the minimal number of evolutionary changes (gains or losses) required for each character on the given tree.\n\nFor the flypaper trap (binary character: presence versus absence):\n- Presence occurs in exactly the two sister taxa *Corolla adhaerens* and *Stipes glutinosus*. The most parsimonious reconstruction is a single gain on their shared ancestral branch.\n- Therefore the minimal number of changes for flypaper is $1$.\n- Any scenario invoking convergence of flypaper between these two sister taxa would require $2$ independent gains, which is less parsimonious.\n\nFor the pitcher trap (binary character: presence versus absence):\n- Presence occurs in *Folium poculum* in Lineage 1 and *Petalus amphora* in Lineage 2; it is absent from their respective sister lineages. On the fixed tree, the minimal number of steps to explain two separated presences is $2$. This can be realized as two independent gains (one in each lineage) with $0$ losses, or equivalently as a single ancestral presence with $2$ losses; both cost $2$ changes on the tree.\n- Hence, parsimony does not force a unique choice between “homologous” versus “convergent” for the pitcher trap based on step count alone; however, explaining two occurrences in non-sister lineages by two independent origins is the standard parsimonious interpretation that avoids positing an unobserved ancestral pitcher state plus multiple losses.\n\nNow evaluate the options by total event counts and logical consistency:\n- A (pitcher homologous, flypaper convergent): flypaper convergence requires $2$ gains; pitcher can be fit with $2$ changes. Total changes are at least $2+2=4$, which is less parsimonious than using a single flypaper origin.\n- B (flypaper homologous, pitcher convergent): flypaper requires $1$ change; pitcher requires $2$ changes as independent origins. Total $1+2=3$.\n- C (both homologous): flypaper homologous requires $1$ change; pitcher homologous requires $2$ changes (via losses). Total also $1+2=3$. Although equal in step count to B, it posits an ancestral pitcher state and multiple losses despite the trait being split across distant lineages, which is not the usual parsimonious interpretation for such a distribution.\n- D (both convergent): flypaper convergent requires $2$ gains; pitcher convergent requires $2$ gains. Total $2+2=4$, less parsimonious.\n- E (single carnivorous ancestor with later loss in *Radix nonvorax*): this asserts a single origin of carnivory for all five species and only specifies a loss in *Radix nonvorax*. It does not explicitly account for the necessary change in mechanism between flypaper and pitcher; when the mechanisms are treated as distinct characters, the minimal reconstruction still requires the $1$ event for flypaper and $2$ for pitcher as above. Thus E is not the most parsimonious statement under the specified trait coding.\n\nTherefore, the most parsimonious clearly stated option is that the flypaper trap is homologous within the *Corolla adhaerens*–*Stipes glutinosus* clade, and the pitcher trap arose convergently in *Folium poculum* and *Petalus amphora*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1855711"}]}
