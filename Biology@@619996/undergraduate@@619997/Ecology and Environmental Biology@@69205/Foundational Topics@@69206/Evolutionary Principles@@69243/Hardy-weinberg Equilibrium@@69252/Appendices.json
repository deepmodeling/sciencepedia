This first practice will guide you through the fundamental skill of calculating allele frequencies directly from observed genotype counts.

[@problem_id:1852850]", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying a newly discovered species of hydrothermal vent snail. They observe that the snails exhibit two distinct shell phenotypes: a thick, dark shell and a thinner, lighter shell. Genetic analysis reveals that this trait is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele, $T$, which codes for the thick shell, and a recessive allele, $t$, which codes for the thin shell. In a large, isolated vent field, the biologists collect a random sample of 500 snails. After genotyping each snail, they find the following distribution: 180 individuals are homozygous dominant ($TT$), 240 are heterozygous ($Tt$), and 80 are homozygous recessive ($tt$).\n\nBased on this sample, what is the frequency of the recessive allele, $t$? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $n_{TT}=180$, $n_{Tt}=240$, $n_{tt}=80$, and $N=500$ denote the genotype counts and total sample size. In a diploid population, the total number of alleles is $2N$. The number of recessive alleles $t$ present is $2n_{tt}+n_{Tt}$ because each $tt$ individual contributes two $t$ alleles and each $Tt$ individual contributes one $t$ allele. Therefore, the recessive allele frequency $q$ is\n$$\nq=\\frac{2n_{tt}+n_{Tt}}{2N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given counts,\n$$\nq=\\frac{2\\cdot 80+240}{2\\cdot 500}=\\frac{160+240}{1000}=\\frac{400}{1000}=0.4.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4}$$", "id": "1852850"}, {"introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle is a powerful and flexible tool, not limited to simple autosomal genes.

The allele for straight antennae, denoted as $X^S$, is dominant over the allele for curved antennae, $X^c$. A large, randomly mating population of these moths is studied and assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for this trait. A field survey reveals that 16% of the males in the population exhibit curved antennae. Based on this observation, what is the expected frequency of female moths that are heterozygous for this gene?

This problem challenges you to think about where alleles reside within a population, specifically focusing on recessive alleles.
