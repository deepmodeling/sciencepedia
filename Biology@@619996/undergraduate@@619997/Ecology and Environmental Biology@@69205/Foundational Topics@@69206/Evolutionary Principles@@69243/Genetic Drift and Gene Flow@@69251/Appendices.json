Fluctuations in population size, such as bottlenecks, have a profound effect on the long-term rate of drift. This exercise challenges you to derive the mathematical relationship [@problem_id:1750100] that demonstrates how long-term $N_e$ is calculated as the harmonic mean of generational sizes, providing a crucial insight into why population bottlenecks are so significant in conservation genetics.", "problem": "Conservation biologists are modeling the population genetics of a rare species of montane frog, *Litoria caerulea montana*, which lives in a series of isolated alpine ponds. This species experiences significant fluctuations in population size due to variable annual snowmelt and rainfall. The census population size, $N$, of one such isolated population was recorded over four consecutive generations as $N_1, N_2, N_3,$ and $N_4$.\n\nDue to a lek-mating system where only a small number of males are successful, the Effective Population Size ($N_e$), which determines the rate of genetic drift, is not equal to the census size. For this species, empirical studies have established a consistent relationship where the effective population size in any given generation $t$ is a fraction of the census size: $N_{e,t} = \\gamma N_t$, where $\\gamma$ is a dimensionless constant ($0 < \\gamma \\le 1$) that encapsulates the effects of the breeding system.\n\nThe long-term impact of genetic drift on the entire period is determined by the overall effective population size, $N_{e,\\text{total}}$. This value represents the size of a constant, ideal population that would experience the same total amount of drift over the four generations as the fluctuating real population.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the total effective population size, $N_{e,\\text{total}}$, over this four-generation period. Your expression should be in terms of the constant $\\gamma$ and the census sizes $N_1, N_2, N_3,$ and $N_4$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total effective population size, $N_{e,\\text{total}}$, over a period of four generations with fluctuating population sizes. The key principle is that the long-term effective population size is governed by the harmonic mean of the effective population sizes of each individual generation, not the arithmetic mean. This is because genetic drift's effect is proportional to $1/N_e$, and the total effect over time is the sum of the generational effects.\n\nThe effective population size for each generation $t$ is given by $N_{e,t} = \\gamma N_t$. So, for the four generations, we have:\n$N_{e,1} = \\gamma N_1$\n$N_{e,2} = \\gamma N_2$\n$N_{e,3} = \\gamma N_3$\n$N_{e,4} = \\gamma N_4$\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean effective population size over $k$ generations is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_{e,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{N_{e,i}} $$\nIn our case, $k=4$. Substituting the generation-specific effective sizes into this formula gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_{e,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{e,1}} + \\frac{1}{N_{e,2}} + \\frac{1}{N_{e,3}} + \\frac{1}{N_{e,4}} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $N_{e,t}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_{e,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\gamma N_1} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma N_2} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma N_3} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma N_4} \\right) $$\nWe can factor out the constant $\\frac{1}{\\gamma}$ from the terms inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_{e,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{4\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_1} + \\frac{1}{N_2} + \\frac{1}{N_3} + \\frac{1}{N_4} \\right) $$\nTo combine the fractions inside the parentheses, we find a common denominator, which is $N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_{e,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{4\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{N_2 N_3 N_4}{N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4} + \\frac{N_1 N_3 N_4}{N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4} + \\frac{N_1 N_2 N_4}{N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4} + \\frac{N_1 N_2 N_3}{N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4} \\right) $$\nSumming the numerators gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_{e,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{4\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{N_2 N_3 N_4 + N_1 N_3 N_4 + N_1 N_2 N_4 + N_1 N_2 N_3}{N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4} \\right) $$\nFinally, to solve for $N_{e,\\text{total}}$, we take the reciprocal of the entire expression:\n$$ N_{e,\\text{total}} = 4\\gamma \\left( \\frac{N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4}{N_2 N_3 N_4 + N_1 N_3 N_4 + N_1 N_2 N_4 + N_1 N_2 N_3} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the total effective population size over the four-generation period, showing its strong dependence on the generational census sizes and the breeding system factor $\\gamma$.
