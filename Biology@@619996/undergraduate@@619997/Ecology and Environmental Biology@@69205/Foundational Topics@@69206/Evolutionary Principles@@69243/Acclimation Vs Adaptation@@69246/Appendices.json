{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Disentangling the long-term, evolutionary process of adaptation from the short-term, flexible response of acclimation is a central challenge in ecology. A powerful tool for this is the common garden experiment, where individuals from different environments are brought into a shared, controlled setting. This practice challenges you to interpret the results of such an experiment to determine if differences in thermal tolerance between two fish populations are rooted in heritable genetic differences or are a reversible response to their native environments [@problem_id:1829159].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two distinct populations of the same species of fish, the three-spined stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*). The first population (Population A) is from a cool, stable upstream portion of a river with an average water temperature of 12°C. The second population (Population B) is from a section of the river several kilometers downstream that receives warm water effluent from a power plant, resulting in an average water temperature of 22°C.\n\nThe ecologist conducts an experiment to investigate the nature of the physiological differences between these two populations. Individuals from both Population A and Population B are collected and brought into a laboratory. In the lab, both groups of fish are kept in identical \"common-garden\" tanks maintained at a constant temperature of 17°C for a period of 18 months. This duration is long enough for significant physiological adjustment to occur.\n\nAfter the 18-month period, the ecologist measures the critical thermal maximum (CTmax), which is the temperature at which a fish loses its ability to maintain equilibrium, for individuals from both groups. The results show that the average CTmax for the fish originally from Population A is 28.5°C, while the average CTmax for the fish originally from Population B is 33.0°C. Despite being housed in the same thermal environment for over a year, a significant difference in thermal tolerance persists.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation?\n\nA. The observed difference in CTmax is a clear example of physiological acclimation, as the fish were exposed to a new temperature in the lab.\n\nB. The persistence of the difference in CTmax after long-term housing in a common environment suggests that the two populations have undergone local adaptation, involving heritable genetic differences.\n\nC. Phenotypic plasticity is the primary explanation for the observed results, as the fish from both populations were able to survive at 17°C.\n\nD. The experiment is inconclusive because the 18-month period was not long enough for the physiological differences to disappear.\n\nE. The difference in CTmax is likely due to parental effects, where the thermal history of the parents influences the offspring's phenotype, but this effect is not genetic.", "solution": "We interpret the experiment using the common-garden principle: when organisms from different environments are maintained for an extended period under identical conditions, any phenotypic differences that persist are most parsimoniously attributed to heritable genetic differences (local adaptation), whereas differences that disappear are attributed to environmental effects within a lifetime (physiological acclimation or other forms of phenotypic plasticity).\n\nLogical steps:\n1) Definition of acclimation versus adaptation:\n- Physiological acclimation (a form of phenotypic plasticity) is within-lifetime, reversible adjustment of phenotype to environmental conditions. Under a common-garden at a constant temperature, acclimation should drive convergence of thermal tolerance traits if they are primarily plastic.\n- Local adaptation refers to genetically based differences among populations shaped by natural selection in their native environments; such differences persist in a common-garden.\n\n2) Experimental setup relevance:\n- Individuals from both populations are held under identical thermal conditions for a prolonged period (18 months), which is ample time for thermal acclimation in fish and sufficient to diminish transient environmental carryover effects from the field.\n\n3) Observation:\n- Despite long-term identical conditions, the CTmax of the two groups remains significantly different (higher for the population originating from the warmer habitat).\n\n4) Inference from common-garden logic:\n- Because environmental and acclimatory conditions have been equalized for a long duration, the persistent difference in CTmax is best explained by heritable genetic differences between populations, consistent with local adaptation to their native thermal regimes.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: acclimation would predict convergence under the shared laboratory temperature; persistence of a difference contradicts a purely acclimatory explanation.\n- B is correct: the enduring difference after common-garden strongly indicates local adaptation involving heritable genetic differences.\n- C is incorrect: survival at the common temperature evidences some plasticity but does not explain the persistent divergence in CTmax.\n- D is unlikely: 18 months is generally sufficient for acclimation; claiming insufficiency lacks support relative to standard acclimation timescales.\n- E is unlikely in this design: parental or early-life carryover effects are minimized by long-term common-garden housing of the individuals themselves; to implicate parental effects, one would need to rear offspring in a common-garden, which was not done here. The observed persistence thus more strongly implicates genetic differentiation.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate interpretation is that the populations have undergone local adaptation with a heritable basis for CTmax differences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1829159"}, {"introduction": "To confidently claim a trait is an adaptation, we must demonstrate that it is heritable—that is, passed genetically from one generation to the next. This exercise explores a common garden experiment that takes the next step by raising the offspring of two distinct populations in an identical environment. By examining the traits of this new generation, you can more definitively distinguish between inherited genetic adaptations and non-heritable adjustments made during a parent's lifetime [@problem_id:1829102].", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the mechanisms behind the attachment strength of the marine mussel, *Mytilus californianus*, in two different coastal environments. Population H is from an exposed headland with high wave energy, while Population C is from a nearby protected cove with calm waters.\n\nThe ecologist measures the force required to detach the byssal threads—the strong filaments mussels use to anchor themselves—from a standardized substrate.\n- The average detachment force for wild adult mussels collected directly from the high-energy site (Population H) is 10.1 Newtons (N).\n- The average detachment force for wild adult mussels collected from the calm cove (Population C) is 4.3 N.\n\nTo distinguish between genetic and environmental causes for this difference, the ecologist conducts a common garden experiment. Larval offspring from both Population H and Population C are collected and raised to adulthood in a controlled laboratory aquarium that simulates a calm, low-flow environment identical for both groups. After one year, the byssal thread strength of these new F1 generation adults is measured.\n- The average detachment force for the F1 adults whose parents came from Population H is 8.5 N.\n- The average detachment force for the F1 adults whose parents came from Population C is 4.6 N.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete interpretation of the factors determining byssal thread strength in these mussel populations?\n\nA. The observed difference in thread strength in the wild is entirely an example of acclimation (phenotypic plasticity), where individual mussels respond to the local wave conditions during their lifetime.\n\nB. The experiment is inconclusive because the F1 offspring from Population H were weaker than their wild parents, indicating that the strong-thread trait is not heritable and is being lost.\n\nC. The persistence of a significant difference in thread strength between the two groups in the common garden environment strongly indicates that genetic adaptation is the primary driver of the population-level difference.\n\nD. The results show that the offspring of Population H inherited the acquired characteristics of their parents, who developed stronger threads as a result of living in a high-wave environment.\n\nE. Maternal effects, where the mother's pre-conception environment non-genetically dictates offspring phenotype, are exclusively responsible for the difference observed in the F1 generation.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to interpret the results of a common garden experiment to distinguish between two key evolutionary concepts: acclimation and adaptation.\n\n**Step 1: Define Acclimation and Adaptation.**\n- **Acclimation** (a form of phenotypic plasticity) is a reversible, non-heritable physiological or morphological adjustment an individual organism makes in response to environmental changes. If thread strength were purely due to acclimation, a mussel's thread strength would be determined by the wave environment it grows in.\n- **Adaptation** is a heritable trait that has evolved through natural selection because it increases an organism's fitness. If stronger threads are an adaptation, there is a genetic basis for the trait that is passed from parents to offspring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Experimental Design.**\nThe common garden experiment is the critical tool used here. By raising offspring from two different populations (H and C) in an identical, controlled environment, the experiment eliminates environmental variables as a cause for any observed differences in the F1 generation. Any remaining differences between the groups must be attributed to the genes they inherited from their parents.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Field Data (Wild Populations).**\nResearchers observed that wild mussels from the high-energy site (Population H) have much stronger threads (10.1 N) than mussels from the calm site (Population C) (4.3 N). At this stage, this difference could be due to:\n1.  Genetic adaptation (Population H has genes for stronger threads).\n2.  Acclimation (Mussels in Population H develop stronger threads in response to the constant pulling from waves).\n3.  A combination of both.\n\nThe field data alone cannot distinguish between these possibilities.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Common Garden Data (F1 Generation).**\nThis is the key to solving the problem. The offspring from both populations were raised in the *same* calm environment.\n- F1 offspring from Population H had an average thread strength of 8.5 N.\n- F1 offspring from Population C had an average thread strength of 4.6 N.\n\nDespite being raised in a calm environment, the offspring of the high-energy population still developed significantly stronger threads than the offspring of the calm-water population. Since the environment was constant for both groups during their development, this persistent difference cannot be explained by acclimation to their own environment. The difference must be due to heritable factors passed down from their parents.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Interpret.**\nThe persistence of the trait difference (8.5 N vs. 4.6 N) in the F1 generation under common garden conditions is strong evidence for a genetic basis for byssal thread strength. This indicates that Population H has undergone natural selection for genes that confer stronger threads, which is the definition of adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, the data reveal a nuance. The F1-H mussels (8.5 N) are not as strong as their wild parents (10.1 N). This suggests that while the primary foundation for strong threads is genetic (adaptation), achieving the maximum possible strength may also require the environmental stimulus of high wave energy (an acclimation component). The difference between 10.1 N and 8.5 N can be interpreted as the contribution of phenotypic plasticity. However, the fundamental difference between the populations, which persists across generations in a controlled environment, is due to adaptation.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options.**\n\n*   **A: The observed difference in thread strength in the wild is entirely an example of acclimation...** This is incorrect. If it were entirely acclimation, the F1 offspring of both populations, raised in the same calm environment, should have had identical, weak threads. The F1 data directly contradicts this.\n\n*   **B: The experiment is inconclusive because the F1 offspring from Population H were weaker than their wild parents...** This is a misinterpretation. The most important comparison is not between F1-H and P0-H, but between F1-H (8.5 N) and F1-C (4.6 N). The large, persistent difference between these two groups is the conclusive result. The drop from 10.1 N to 8.5 N simply suggests a role for both adaptation and acclimation, but it does not invalidate the conclusion about adaptation.\n\n*   **C: The persistence of a significant difference in thread strength between the two groups in the common garden environment strongly indicates that genetic adaptation is the primary driver of the population-level difference.** This statement is the most accurate. It correctly identifies the F1 data as the key evidence and correctly concludes that heritable, genetic differences (adaptation) are the main reason for the divergence between populations.\n\n*   **D: The results show that the offspring of Population H inherited the acquired characteristics of their parents...** This describes a Lamarckian theory of inheritance, which has been disproven. Organisms pass on genes, not characteristics acquired during their lifetime. The experiment supports Darwinian evolution via natural selection on heritable variation, not the inheritance of acquired traits.\n\n*   **E: Maternal effects... are exclusively responsible for the difference observed in the F1 generation.** While maternal effects can exist, it is highly unlikely they are *exclusively* responsible for such a large and persistent difference that aligns perfectly with the selective pressures of the original environments. The most parsimonious explanation supported by decades of evolutionary biology is genetic adaptation. Therefore, claiming maternal effects are the *sole* cause is an overstatement and ignores the stronger evidence for adaptation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1829102"}, {"introduction": "In nature, an organism's phenotype is often shaped by a combination of both its genetic makeup (adaptation) and its immediate environment (acclimation).
