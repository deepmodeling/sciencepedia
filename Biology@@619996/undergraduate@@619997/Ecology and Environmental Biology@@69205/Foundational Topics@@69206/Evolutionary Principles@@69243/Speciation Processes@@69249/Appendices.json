{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The essence of speciation lies in the evolution of reproductive barriers that prevent gene flow between populations. This first exercise provides a classic scenario to help you distinguish among different types of postzygotic isolating mechanisms, which act after fertilization has occurred. By carefully analyzing the fitness of hybrid offspring across multiple generations, you can pinpoint the specific barrier at play and appreciate why successful F1 hybrids do not necessarily mean two groups belong to the same species [@problem_id:1882127].", "problem": "On a remote volcanic archipelago, botanists discover two distinct but closely related species of flowering plants, *Archipelagia caerulea* and *Archipelagia viridis*. In a controlled greenhouse experiment, pollen from *A. caerulea* is used to fertilize the ovules of *A. viridis*. The resulting seeds germinate and grow into a generation of healthy, vigorous plants (the F1 generation) that are capable of producing their own viable seeds through self-pollination. However, when these F1-produced seeds are planted, the subsequent plants (the F2 generation) are noticeably stunted, exhibit poor health, and are completely sterile, failing to produce any flowers. This observation describes a specific type of reproductive isolating mechanism.\n\nWhich of the following terms best describes this phenomenon?\n\nA. Mechanical isolation\n\nB. Hybrid inviability\n\nC. Gametic isolation\n\nD. Hybrid breakdown\n\nE. Hybrid sterility", "solution": "We identify whether the observed barrier is prezygotic or postzygotic by following the sequence of events. Pollen from one species successfully fertilizes ovules of the other, producing viable F1 plants that are healthy and fertile (they can self-pollinate and produce viable seeds). Therefore, prezygotic mechanisms such as mechanical isolation (A) or gametic isolation (C), which prevent mating or fertilization, are not applicable because successful fertilization and development occurred.\n\nNext, we evaluate postzygotic barriers. Hybrid inviability (B) refers to hybrids that fail to develop or survive to reproductive maturity; this is contradicted by the healthy, vigorous, fertile F1 generation. Hybrid sterility (E) refers to F1 hybrids that are sterile; this is also contradicted because the F1 produce viable seeds. Hybrid breakdown (D) describes the case where F1 hybrids are viable and fertile, but their offspring (F2 or backcrosses) show reduced fitness, poor health, or sterility. The observation that the F2 generation is stunted, unhealthy, and completely sterile matches the definition of hybrid breakdown.\n\nThus, the correct term is hybrid breakdown.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1882127"}, {"introduction": "When diverging species come back into contact, their interaction can drive further evolution, but the selective pressures can be complex. This practice challenges you to act as an evolutionary detective, using data on morphology and mating behavior to distinguish between two key processes: ecological character displacement and reinforcement [@problem_id:1882142]. Learning to separate these drivers is crucial for understanding how competition for resources versus the cost of hybridization can shape the final stages of speciation.", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying two closely related species of stream salamanders, *Cryptobranchus fontanus* and *Cryptobranchus rivalis*. In the mountain range they inhabit, some streams contain only one of the species (allopatric populations), while a distinct central valley contains streams where both species coexist (sympatric populations). The biologists collect data on two key characteristics: adult body size and mate recognition signals.\n\nThe study provides the following definitions for two key evolutionary processes:\n- **Ecological Character Displacement (ECD):** A process in which evolutionary divergence of a trait related to resource acquisition (e.g., beak size, body size) is driven by interspecific competition, leading to greater differences between species in sympatry than in allopatry.\n- **Reinforcement:** Also known as reproductive character displacement, this is a process in which natural selection drives the divergence of mate recognition traits (e.g., courtship displays, pheromones) to reduce the frequency of costly, low-fitness hybridization events between species in sympatry.\n\nThe biologists make two primary observations:\n\n1.  **Body Size:** In allopatric populations, both species have a nearly identical mean adult body length of $L_0$. In the sympatric zone, the mean adult body length of *C. fontanus* is smaller, at $L_0 - \\Delta L$, while the mean adult body length of *C. rivalis* is larger, at $L_0 + \\Delta L$, where $\\Delta L$ is a significant positive value. Previous dietary studies have confirmed that body length in these salamanders is strongly correlated with the size of aquatic invertebrate prey they consume.\n\n2.  **Mate Recognition:** The primary mate recognition signals for these species are a complex sequence of nudges performed by the male and the chemical profile of specific pheromones released by both sexes. Detailed analysis of high-speed video recordings and gas chromatography of pheromonal compounds shows no statistically significant divergence in either the courtship sequence or the chemical profile between the allopatric and sympatric populations of either species. Genetic analysis confirms that occasional hybridization does occur in the wild, and the resulting offspring have significantly lower survival rates than purebred individuals.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported by the evidence?\n\nA. The divergence in body size is primarily driven by ecological character displacement.\n\nB. The divergence in body size is primarily driven by reinforcement.\n\nC. The evidence suggests that both ecological character displacement and reinforcement are acting with approximately equal strength.\n\nD. The observed divergence in body size is most likely the result of random genetic drift in the sympatric populations.\n\nE. The evidence is contradictory and therefore insufficient to favor either ecological character displacement or reinforcement.", "solution": "We begin by restating the key theoretical predictions implied by the provided definitions.\n\nBy definition, ecological character displacement (ECD) is driven by interspecific competition acting on traits related to resource acquisition. Therefore, ECD specifically predicts that in sympatry, traits tied to resource use will diverge between species relative to allopatry. In contrast, reinforcement (reproductive character displacement) is driven by selection against hybridization and specifically predicts that mate recognition traits will diverge more in sympatry than in allopatry, reducing heterospecific matings.\n\nNext, we map these predictions to the observations.\n\nFor body size: In allopatry, both species have mean adult body length $L_{0}$. In sympatry, the means shift in opposite directions to $L_{0}-\\Delta L$ for *Cryptobranchus fontanus* and $L_{0}+\\Delta L$ for *Cryptobranchus rivalis*, with $\\Delta L>0$ and significant. Prior studies establish that body length is strongly correlated with prey size, a direct axis of resource acquisition. Therefore:\n- The observed pattern is increased interspecific divergence in sympatry relative to allopatry.\n- The trait under divergence (body size) is ecologically tied to resource use.\n- The bidirectional, complementary shifts ($L_{0}-\\Delta L$ versus $L_{0}+\\Delta L$) are consistent with niche partitioning and reduced resource overlap.\nThese points together match the core prediction of ECD and constitute strong, specific evidence for ECD acting on body size.\n\nFor mate recognition: Detailed analyses show no statistically significant divergence between sympatric and allopatric populations in either the courtship sequence or pheromone profiles. Yet, hybridization does occur and has lower offspring survival than purebred crosses. Under reinforcement, costly hybridization in sympatry should drive divergence in mate recognition signals to reduce heterospecific matings; thus, reinforcement predicts greater divergence of these signals in sympatry. The observation of no divergence in these mate recognition traits therefore does not support reinforcement and is inconsistent with reinforcement being a primary driver in this system, at least with respect to the measured signals.\n\nWe now evaluate alternative explanations.\n\nRandom genetic drift (option D) is unlikely to explain the pattern because:\n- The directionally opposite shifts in the two species are complementary and functionally aligned with resource partitioning, not random.\n- The changes are restricted to sympatry relative to allopatry, which is a hallmark of selection mediated by interspecific interactions rather than drift.\n- The trait under change is explicitly linked to ecological performance (prey acquisition), strengthening the case for selection.\n\nThe possibility that both ECD and reinforcement act with approximately equal strength (option C) is not supported because there is positive evidence for ECD in body size and an absence of the key signature of reinforcement in mate recognition traits; equal strength would require detecting both signatures, which is not the case here.\n\nThe evidence is not contradictory (option E); rather, it is consistent with ECD affecting an ecological trait while reinforcement is not detected in the measured mate recognition traits despite hybrid costs.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is that the divergence in body size is primarily driven by ecological character displacement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1882142"}, {"introduction": "While we often visualize speciation as a simple branching tree, the reality can be much more complex, with gene flow sometimes occurring between species after they have diverged. This advanced problem introduces you to the powerful tools of phylogenomics that allow scientists to detect such \"reticulate\" evolutionary events from genome-wide data [@problem_id:1882121]. By predicting the statistical patterns generated by ancient introgression, such as the behavior of Patterson's $D$-statistic, you will gain insight into how we reconstruct the intricate tapestry of life's history.", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a group of closely related flowering plants in an isolated archipelago. Based on morphological characteristics and a small number of highly conserved gene sequences, they have established a species phylogeny. This phylogeny indicates that species A and species B are sister taxa, and their clade is sister to species C. A more distantly related species, O, serves as the outgroup. The species tree is therefore structured as ((A, B), C), O.\n\nHowever, a genome-wide analysis reveals patterns inconsistent with this simple bifurcating history. The researchers hypothesize that there has been a significant ancient introgression event (gene flow) from species B into species C. To test this hypothesis, they plan to use two common phylogenomic approaches: Patterson's D-statistic and the analysis of gene tree concordance.\n\nPatterson's D-statistic is a four-taxon test used to detect introgression. It is calculated for a set of four taxa with the relationship ((P1, P2), P3), O, where P1 and P2 are sister taxa, P3 is their close relative, and O is a distant outgroup. The statistic is based on biallelic sites across the genome where the outgroup O has the ancestral allele (let's denote it 'A') and a derived allele ('B') is present in at least one of the other three taxa.\n- An \"ABBA\" site is one where P1 has the ancestral allele, P2 has the derived allele, and P3 has the derived allele (genotype pattern across (P1, P2, P3) is ABB). This pattern is genealogically unexpected, as it suggests P2 and P3 share a derived allele not found in P1.\n- A \"BABA\" site is one where P1 has the derived allele, P2 has the ancestral allele, and P3 has the derived allele (genotype pattern across (P1, P2, P3) is BAB). This is also genealogically unexpected, as it suggests P1 and P3 share a derived allele.\nThe D-statistic is calculated as:\n$D(P1, P2, P3, O) = \\frac{N_{BABA} - N_{ABBA}}{N_{BABA} + N_{ABBA}}$, where $N$ is the count of each site type.\n\nIn the absence of introgression, random sorting of ancestral polymorphisms, a phenomenon known as Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS), can produce both ABBA and BABA sites in roughly equal numbers, leading to a D-statistic close to zero. A significant deviation from zero indicates an excess of either BABA or ABBA sites, which is a strong signal of introgression.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers will build thousands of individual gene trees from across the genome and compare their topologies. For the three species A, B, and C, there are three possible unrooted tree topologies:\n1. T1: ((A, B), C) - Congruent with the species tree.\n2. T2: ((A, C), B) - Discordant.\n3. T3: ((B, C), A) - Discordant.\n\nWhich of the following combinations of results would provide the strongest evidence in support of the hypothesis that significant gene flow occurred from species B into species C?\n\nA. $D(A, B, C, O)$ is significantly positive, and the frequency of T2 gene trees is significantly greater than the frequency of T3 gene trees.\n\nB. $D(A, B, C, O)$ is significantly negative, and the frequency of T2 gene trees is significantly greater than the frequency of T3 gene trees.\n\nC. $D(A, B, C, O)$ is approximately zero, and the frequencies of T2 and T3 gene trees are approximately equal.\n\nD. $D(A, B, C, O)$ is significantly negative, and the frequency of T3 gene trees is significantly greater than the frequency of T2 gene trees.\n\nE. $D(A, B, C, O)$ is significantly positive, and the frequency of T3 gene trees is significantly greater than the frequency of T2 gene trees.", "solution": "We first map the four-taxon D-statistic to the given species and species tree. The species phylogeny is $((A,B),C),O$, so for Patterson’s test we set $P1=A$, $P2=B$, $P3=C$, and $O=O$.\n\nBy definition, the D-statistic for these four taxa is\n$$\nD(A,B,C,O) = \\frac{N_{BABA} - N_{ABBA}}{N_{BABA} + N_{ABBA}},\n$$\nwhere $N_{ABBA}$ counts sites where $A$ has the ancestral allele and $B$ and $C$ share the derived allele, and $N_{BABA}$ counts sites where $A$ and $C$ share the derived allele while $B$ has the ancestral allele.\n\nKey expectations:\n- Under incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) without introgression, random sorting yields $N_{ABBA} \\approx N_{BABA}$, hence $D \\approx 0$.\n- An excess of shared derived alleles between $B$ and $C$ (relative to those between $A$ and $C$) increases $N_{ABBA}$ relative to $N_{BABA}$. Since\n$$\nD = \\frac{N_{BABA} - N_{ABBA}}{N_{BABA} + N_{ABBA}},\n$$\nif $N_{ABBA} > N_{BABA}$, then the numerator is negative and $D < 0$. Therefore, introgression from $B$ into $C$ predicts a significantly negative $D(A,B,C,O)$.\n\nFor gene tree topologies among $A,B,C$, there are three unrooted possibilities: $T1=((A,B),C)$ (species-tree concordant), $T2=((A,C),B)$, and $T3=((B,C),A)$. Under the multispecies coalescent with no introgression and internal branch length $t$ (in coalescent units), the expected frequencies satisfy\n$$\nf(T1) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\exp(-t), \\quad f(T2) = f(T3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-t),\n$$\nso the two discordant topologies occur at equal frequencies. Introgression from $B$ into $C$ specifically increases genealogical affinity between $B$ and $C$, thereby increasing the frequency of $T3=((B,C),A)$ relative to $T2=((A,C),B)$, i.e., $f(T3) > f(T2)$.\n\nCombining the two independent predictions for gene flow from $B$ into $C$ yields:\n- $D(A,B,C,O)$ significantly negative (because $N_{ABBA} > N_{BABA}$),\n- frequency of $T3$ significantly greater than frequency of $T2$.\n\nAmong the options, this combination is exactly described by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1882121"}]}
