During transcription, RNA polymerase synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction using the DNA template strand read 3' to 5'. The base-pairing rules are: template T pairs with mRNA A, template A with mRNA U, template C with mRNA G, template G with mRNA C. Therefore, the corresponding mRNA sequence is 5'-AUG CCU AGC UAA-3'.\n\nReading the mRNA in codons from the 5' end gives AUG | CCU | AGC | UAA, which translate to Met | Pro | Ser | Stop.\n\nThe mutation described is a single-nucleotide substitution at the 6th position from the 3' end of the template strand: the template base A is replaced by T. Indexing the template positions 1 through 12 from the 3' end, position 6 is A in the original sequence. This base corresponds to position 6 in the mRNA (since template position i maps to mRNA position i under antiparallel synthesis), which is the third base of the second mRNA codon. Originally, template position 6 is A, producing mRNA base U at position 6; after mutation it becomes T, producing mRNA base A at position 6. Thus, the second mRNA codon changes from CCU to CCA.\n\nUsing the provided codon table, both CCU and CCA encode Proline. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is unchanged.
