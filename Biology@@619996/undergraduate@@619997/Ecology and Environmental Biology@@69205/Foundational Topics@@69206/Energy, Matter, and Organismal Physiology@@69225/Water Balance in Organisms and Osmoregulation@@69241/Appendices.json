This problem explores the critical physiological consequences of drinking seawater, a hypertonic fluid.

In a state of desperation, they drink $V_{sw} = 1.00$ L of seawater. To analyze the physiological consequences of this act, we model the human body's response using the principles of osmoregulation. The osmolarity, a measure of solute concentration, of the seawater is $C_{sw} = 1050$ mOsm/L (milliosmoles per liter). The normal osmolarity of human body fluids is tightly regulated at $C_{bf} = 300$ mOsm/L. Due to the extreme stress and dehydration, the castaway's kidneys are functioning sub-optimally and can only produce urine with a maximum osmolarity of $C_{u,max} = 950$ mOsm/L.\n\nAssume that to restore homeostasis, the person's body must excrete the necessary amount of solutes to return the overall osmolarity of their body fluids to the normal value, $C_{bf}$. For this calculation, assume the kidneys operate consistently at their maximum concentrating capacity. You may ignore other sources of water gain or loss, such as metabolic water production or water lost through respiration and sweating.\n\nCalculate the net change in the person's total body water volume as a direct result of ingesting the seawater and the subsequent renal response.

This problem models the cellular mechanics behind the wood frog's freeze tolerance, a strategy that hinges on manipulating osmotic gradients with cryoprotectants like glucose. By deriving a symbolic relationship for cell volume change, you will explore how these frogs prevent cellular dehydration even as their extracellular fluids turn to ice, providing insight into the elegant physics of biological survival [@problem_id:1894248].", "problem": "The wood frog, *Rana sylvatica*, can survive the freezing of up to 65% of its total body water during winter hibernation. This remarkable feat is achieved through a combination of physiological adaptations. To prevent lethal cellular dehydration, the frog's liver rapidly converts glycogen into glucose, which is then transported into the cells, acting as a cryoprotectant. This process increases the intracellular solute concentration. Simultaneously, ice formation is restricted to the extracellular spaces. As pure water freezes, the solutes in the extracellular fluid (ECF) become highly concentrated.\n\nConsider a simplified model for a single frog cell. Initially, before freezing begins, the cell is in osmotic equilibrium with its surroundings. The osmolarity of both the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the ECF is $C_0$, and the initial volume of the cell is $V_{cell,0}$.\n\nAs the temperature drops, two processes occur:\n1.  Glucose is pumped into the cell. The total amount of glucose added is such that its concentration *would be* $C_g$ if the cell's volume remained at its initial value, $V_{cell,0}$.\n2.  A fraction, $f$, of the water in the ECF freezes into pure ice.\n\nAssume that the cell membrane is permeable to water but impermeable to all solutes (both original and the added glucose). Also, assume the total volume of the ECF is sufficiently large that any water moving out of the cell does not significantly change the ECF's osmolarity. Water moves across the cell membrane until a new osmotic equilibrium is reached between the ICF and the remaining (unfrozen) liquid ECF.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the final equilibrium cell volume, $V_{cell,f}$, to the initial cell volume, $V_{cell,0}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $C_0$, $C_g$, and $f$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the final to initial cell volume, $V_{cell,f}/V_{cell,0}$, after the cell reaches a new osmotic equilibrium under freezing conditions. We can solve this by equating the osmolarity of the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) at the final equilibrium state.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of solute moles inside the cell. Initially, the cell has volume $V_{cell,0}$ and osmolarity $C_0$. The initial number of moles of solute in the cell is:\n$$ n_{cell, initial} = C_0 V_{cell,0} $$\nNext, glucose is added to the cell. The problem states that the amount of glucose added would result in a concentration $C_g$ if the cell volume were still $V_{cell,0}$. This means the number of moles of glucose added, $n_g$, is:\n$$ n_g = C_g V_{cell,0} $$\nThe total number of solute moles inside the cell after the glucose is added, $N_{cell, total}$, is the sum of the initial moles and the added glucose moles.\n$$ N_{cell, total} = n_{cell, initial} + n_g = C_0 V_{cell,0} + C_g V_{cell,0} = (C_0 + C_g) V_{cell,0} $$\nThis total number of moles of solute within the cell remains constant during the subsequent volume change, as the membrane is impermeable to solutes.\n\nNow, let's determine the osmolarity of the external environment. The initial osmolarity of the ECF is $C_0$. A fraction $f$ of the water in the ECF freezes. Since the ice formed is pure water, all the solutes originally present in the ECF are now concentrated in the remaining liquid portion. If we consider a sample of ECF, its initial liquid volume $V_{liquid}$ becomes $(1-f)V_{liquid}$ after freezing. The number of moles of solute in this sample remains the same. Therefore, the new osmolarity of the unfrozen ECF, $C_{ecf, final}$, is:\n$$ C_{ecf, final} = \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{new liquid volume}} = \\frac{C_0 V_{liquid}}{(1-f)V_{liquid}} = \\frac{C_0}{1-f} $$\nThe problem states to assume this concentration is not affected by water moving from the cell.\n\nAt osmotic equilibrium, the final osmolarity of the cell, $C_{cell, final}$, must be equal to the final osmolarity of the surrounding liquid ECF, $C_{ecf, final}$. The final osmolarity of the cell is the total number of moles of solute inside it divided by its final volume, $V_{cell,f}$.\n$$ C_{cell, final} = \\frac{N_{cell, total}}{V_{cell,f}} = \\frac{(C_0 + C_g)V_{cell,0}}{V_{cell,f}} $$\nSetting the final intracellular and extracellular osmolarities equal:\n$$ C_{cell, final} = C_{ecf, final} $$\n$$ \\frac{(C_0 + C_g)V_{cell,0}}{V_{cell,f}} = \\frac{C_0}{1-f} $$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $V_{cell,f}/V_{cell,0}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio.\n$$ V_{cell,f} = \\frac{(C_0 + C_g)V_{cell,0}(1-f)}{C_0} $$\nDividing both sides by $V_{cell,0}$ gives the desired ratio:\n$$ \\frac{V_{cell,f}}{V_{cell,0}} = \\frac{(C_0 + C_g)(1-f)}{C_0} $$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$ \\frac{V_{cell,f}}{V_{cell,0}} = \\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_0} + \\frac{C_g}{C_0}\\right)(1-f) = \\left(1 + \\frac{C_g}{C_0}\\right)(1-f) $$\nThis expression represents the fractional change in cell volume required to balance the osmotic pressure of the partially frozen extracellular fluid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(1 + \\frac{C_g}{C_0}\\right)(1-f)}$$", "id": "1894248"}]}
