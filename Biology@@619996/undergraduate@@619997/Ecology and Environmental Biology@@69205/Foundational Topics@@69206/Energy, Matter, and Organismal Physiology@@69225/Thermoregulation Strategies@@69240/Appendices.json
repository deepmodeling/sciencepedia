To become active and forage, it must raise its body temperature from the cool ambient morning temperature to an optimal activity temperature. One of its key physiological adaptations is the ability to change its skin color, thereby altering its albedo (the fraction of incident solar radiation that is reflected).\n\nConsider a simplified model of this lizard warming up in the morning sun.

Using a cost-benefit framework, you will use calculus to determine the optimal fever temperature that minimizes the total energy spent clearing an infection, providing insight into how natural selection shapes complex physiological and behavioral responses.", "problem": "An ectothermic animal, such as a desert lizard, relies on external heat sources to regulate its body temperature. When infected by a pathogen, many ectotherms exhibit \"behavioral fever,\" intentionally increasing their body temperature by spending more time in warmer microclimates. This elevated temperature can enhance immune function but also incurs a significant metabolic cost.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this trade-off. The lizard's normal, healthy body temperature is $T_0$. When infected, it can elevate its body temperature to a fever temperature $T$ where $T \\ge T_0$.\n\nThe metabolic energy expenditure rate, $C(T)$, increases with body temperature $T$ according to the relationship:\n$$C(T) = C_{ref} \\exp(\\alpha(T - T_0))$$\nwhere $C_{ref}$ is the metabolic rate at temperature $T_0$, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the thermal sensitivity of metabolism.\n\nThe rate at which the lizard's immune system clears the pathogen, $R(T)$, is negligible at $T_0$ but increases linearly with the temperature elevation above $T_0$. This relationship is given by:\n$$R(T) = \\beta(T - T_0)$$\nfor $T \\ge T_0$, where $\\beta$ is a positive constant representing the effectiveness of the immune response.\n\nThe lizard's optimal strategy is to choose a fever temperature, $T_{opt}$, that minimizes the *total metabolic energy* required to clear a given initial pathogen load. Assume the time required to clear the infection is inversely proportional to the clearance rate $R(T)$. Determine the expression for the optimal fever temperature, $T_{opt}$, in terms of the parameters given. Your answer should be a closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The central task is to find the optimal fever temperature $T_{opt}$ that minimizes the total metabolic energy expended to clear the infection.\n\nFirst, let's define the quantities involved.\nThe metabolic energy expenditure rate is given as $C(T) = C_{ref} \\exp(\\alpha(T-T_0))$.\nThe pathogen clearance rate is given as $R(T) = \\beta(T-T_0)$.\n\nLet $P_{load}$ be the total pathogen load that needs to be cleared. The time required to clear this load, $t_{clear}$, at a clearance rate $R(T)$ is inversely proportional to $R(T)$. We can write this as $t_{clear}(T) = \\frac{P_{load}}{R(T)}$.\n\nThe total metabolic energy, $E_{total}$, expended during the clearance period is the product of the metabolic rate and the duration of the clearance.\n$$E_{total}(T) = C(T) \\times t_{clear}(T)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $C(T)$ and $t_{clear}(T)$:\n$$E_{total}(T) = C_{ref} \\exp(\\alpha(T - T_0)) \\times \\frac{P_{load}}{\\beta(T - T_0)}$$\n\nTo find the optimal temperature $T_{opt}$ that minimizes $E_{total}(T)$, we need to find the minimum of this function with respect to $T$. The terms $C_{ref}$, $P_{load}$, and $\\beta$ are all positive constants. Therefore, minimizing $E_{total}(T)$ is equivalent to minimizing the function $f(T)$ defined as:\n$$f(T) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha(T - T_0))}{T - T_0}$$\n\nTo simplify the calculus, let's introduce a new variable, $x = T - T_0$. Since $T \\ge T_0$, we have $x \\ge 0$. The function to minimize becomes:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha x)}{x}$$\nWe find the minimum by taking the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero. We use the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u(x) = \\exp(\\alpha x)$ and $v(x) = x$.\n\nThe derivatives are $u'(x) = \\alpha \\exp(\\alpha x)$ and $v'(x) = 1$.\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$\\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{(\\alpha \\exp(\\alpha x))(x) - (\\exp(\\alpha x))(1)}{x^2}$$\n$$\\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha x) (\\alpha x - 1)}{x^2}$$\n\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha x) (\\alpha x - 1)}{x^2} = 0$$\nThe term $\\exp(\\alpha x)$ is always positive. For a fever to exist, $T > T_0$, which implies $x > 0$, so $x^2 \\ne 0$. Therefore, the entire expression can only be zero if the term $(\\alpha x - 1)$ is zero.\n$$\\alpha x - 1 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$$\n\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. Let's examine the sign of the first derivative around the critical point $x = 1/\\alpha$.\nFor $0 < x < 1/\\alpha$, $\\alpha x - 1 < 0$, so $\\frac{df}{dx} < 0$ (the function is decreasing).\nFor $x > 1/\\alpha$, $\\alpha x - 1 > 0$, so $\\frac{df}{dx} > 0$ (the function is increasing).\nSince the function decreases before the critical point and increases after, the point $x = 1/\\alpha$ corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nFinally, we substitute back $x = T - T_0$ to find the optimal temperature $T_{opt}$.\n$$T_{opt} - T_0 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$$\n$$T_{opt} = T_0 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$$\nThis expression gives the optimal fever temperature that minimizes the total energetic cost of fighting the infection within this model.
