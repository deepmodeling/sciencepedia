This first exercise explores the crucial principle of photoreversibility, where the state of this switch can be toggled by different colors of light. By examining the effect of a red light flash followed by a far-red light flash during a long night, you will directly test the 'last light wins' rule and understand how plants distinguish between a true dawn and a misleading interruption of darkness [@problem_id:1860604].", "problem": "A botanist is studying a species of short-day plant (SDP). This plant is known to initiate flowering only when it experiences a continuous period of darkness that exceeds its critical night length of 10 hours. The botanist places several specimens of this plant in a controlled environment chamber where they are subjected to a daily cycle of 8 hours of light followed by 16 hours of darkness.\n\nFor one specific experimental group, the 16-hour dark period is interrupted exactly at its midpoint. The interruption consists of a brief, intense flash of red light (R), which is immediately followed by a brief, intense flash of far-red light (FR).\n\nBased on the established phytochrome model for photoperiodic timekeeping, what will be the predicted flowering response for the plants in this experimental group?\n\nA. The plants will flower.\n\nB. The plants will not flower.\n\nC. The plants will produce flowers, but they will be sterile.\n\nD. The plants will show increased vegetative growth but no flowering.\n\nE. The response is indeterminate as the effect of red light and far-red light will cancel each other out, leading to a random outcome.", "solution": "Define the critical night length for the short-day plant (SDP) as $T_{crit} = 10 \\text{ h}$. By definition of SDPs (also called long-night plants), flowering is initiated only if the plant experiences a continuous dark interval whose duration exceeds $T_{crit}$ and is not effectively interrupted by light that resets the photoperiodic clock.\n\nThe chamber cycle is $T_{light} = 8 \\text{ h}$ followed by $T_{dark} = 16 \\text{ h}$. Since $T_{dark} = 16 \\text{ h} > T_{crit}$, the baseline (uninterrupted) cycle would induce flowering.\n\nThe phytochrome model governs the light-dependent state transitions of the phytochrome system:\n$$P_{r} \\xrightarrow{R} P_{fr}, \\qquad P_{fr} \\xrightarrow{FR} P_{r}.$$\nIn darkness, $P_{fr}$ slowly reverts to $P_{r}$. For SDPs, a high level of $P_{fr}$ during the night inhibits flowering; conversely, maintaining low $P_{fr}$ throughout the continuous dark period permits flowering. A brief red-light night break during darkness converts $P_{r}$ to $P_{fr}$, thereby mimicking a light exposure that interrupts the night and inhibits flowering. However, a subsequent far-red flash immediately reconverts $P_{fr}$ back to $P_{r}$, reversing the effect of the red flash. This “last light wins” principle implies that the final exposure determines the predominant phytochrome form after the treatment.\n\nIn the experiment, the 16-hour dark period is interrupted at its midpoint by an $R$ flash immediately followed by an $FR$ flash. The sequential transitions are\n$$P_{r} \\xrightarrow{R} P_{fr} \\xrightarrow{FR} P_{r},$$\nso the final state after the treatment is $P_{r}$, effectively the same as if no night break had occurred. Therefore, the plants still experience a functionally continuous dark period of $16 \\text{ h} > 10 \\text{ h}$ with low $P_{fr}$ maintained, satisfying the SDP requirement for flowering.\n\nHence, the predicted flowering response is that the plants will flower.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1860604"}, {"introduction": "Knowing how the phytochrome switch works in a cell is one thing, but how does this signal coordinate flowering across the entire plant? This practice addresses that very question by investigating where the photoperiodic stimulus is perceived. This classic thought experiment will help you understand that leaves act as the plant's 'eyes' for day length, producing a mobile signal (famously known as florigen) that travels to the shoot tips to initiate flowering [@problem_id:1766684].", "problem": "A botanist is studying photoperiodism in a specific variety of soybean, which is classified as a short-day plant (SDP). A short-day plant is an organism that flowers only when the length of the night period exceeds a certain critical duration. For this particular soybean variety, the critical night length required to initiate flowering is 12 hours.\n\nThe botanist conducts an experiment using a healthy, mature plant that is still in its vegetative (non-flowering) stage. The entire plant, except for one single, fully expanded leaf, is kept in a growth chamber under a non-inductive light cycle consisting of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness each day.\n\nThe single, selected leaf is carefully enclosed in a light-proof, breathable bag. This bag is applied and removed daily so that this specific leaf experiences an inductive light cycle of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of darkness. The experimental conditions are maintained for several weeks, and all other factors such as temperature, water, and nutrients are kept at optimal levels for growth and flowering.\n\nBased on the established principles of plant physiology, which of the following outcomes is the most likely?\n\nA. The plant will not flower because the vast majority of its leaves are exposed to non-inductive short-night conditions.\n\nB. The plant will flower because the photoperiodic stimulus is perceived by the leaf and the resulting signal is transmissible to the flowering sites.\n\nC. The plant will develop a single flower at the axil of the covered leaf, but the rest of the plant will remain vegetative.\n\nD. The plant will not flower because a single leaf cannot produce a strong enough flowering signal to affect the entire plant.\n\nE. The outcome cannot be determined because the inhibition from the non-induced leaves will counteract the promotion from the single induced leaf.", "solution": "A short-day plant requires that the uninterrupted night length exceed a critical duration to initiate flowering. For the given soybean, the critical night length is 12 hours, so any organ perceiving a night of at least 12 hours is under inductive conditions, while shorter nights are non-inductive.\n\nPhotoperiodic perception occurs in leaves. When a leaf of a short-day plant experiences inductive long nights, it produces a transmissible flowering signal (classically termed florigen, molecularly associated with FT-like proteins), which is transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristems where it induces flowering. This signal is systemic and not confined to the vicinity of the induced leaf. Classic experiments have shown that even a single induced leaf can generate sufficient florigen to induce flowering in an otherwise non-induced plant, and non-induced leaves do not generate a counteracting inhibitory signal that would negate the florigen effect.\n\nApplying these principles to the experiment: the whole plant is under non-inductive 16 hours light and 8 hours dark, except one leaf that is bagged to experience 8 hours light and 16 hours dark. The bagged leaf thus experiences nights longer than the 12-hour critical night length and becomes induced. Over several weeks, this induced leaf will produce florigen, which will move to the shoot apices and trigger flowering of the plant. The effect is not restricted to the axil of the covered leaf, and inhibition from the non-induced leaves is not expected to prevent flowering.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the plant will flower because the photoperiodic stimulus is perceived by the leaf and the resulting signal is transmissible to the flowering sites.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because one induced leaf can suffice to induce flowering.\n- B is correct for the reasons above.\n- C is incorrect because the signal is systemic, not local to a single axil.\n- D is incorrect because a single leaf can produce sufficient florigen.\n- E is incorrect because there is no general inhibitory effect from non-induced leaves that cancels florigen.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1766684"}, {"introduction": "Now it's time to put your knowledge into practice and think like an experimental botanist.

Long-day plant with a critical day length of 10 hours.", "solution": "Define $N$ as the continuous dark (night) length and $N_{c}$ as the critical night length. Photoperiodic principles:\n- Short-day (long-night) plants flower if and only if $N \\geq N_{c}$ and the night is not interrupted by light.\n- Long-day (short-night) plants flower if and only if $N \\leq N_{c}$, and a night break (light flash) can promote flowering by effectively shortening the night.\n- Day-neutral plants do not change flowering with photoperiod.\n\nAnalyze each experiment:\n\n1) Experiment 1: $N=14$ (uninterrupted), result: Flowering. This is consistent with a short-day plant with $N_{c} \\leq 14$. For a long-day plant, flowering at $N=14$ would require $N_{c} \\geq 14$.\n\n2) Experiment 2: $N=11$ (uninterrupted), result: Vegetative Growth. For a short-day plant, lack of flowering implies $N < N_{c}$, so $N_{c} > 11$. For a long-day plant with $N_{c} \\geq 14$ (from Experiment 1), we would predict flowering at $N=11$ because $11 \\leq N_{c}$, which contradicts the result. Hence, the long-day classification is ruled out. Day-neutral is also ruled out because responses differ across photoperiods.\n\n3) Experiment 3: $N=14$ with a 1-hour light flash mid-night, result: Vegetative Growth. In short-day plants, a night interruption prevents the required continuous dark, effectively splitting the night into two shorter dark intervals (e.g., $7$ and $7$ hours), each less than $N_{c}$, suppressing flowering. This is the hallmark diagnostic of a short-day plant. In long-day plants, a night break often promotes flowering, which does not match the observed vegetative outcome under the long night.\n\n4) Experiment 4: $N=13$ (uninterrupted), result: Flowering. This further constrains for a short-day plant that $N_{c} \\leq 13$.\n\nCombine inequalities from Experiments 2 and 4:\n$$11 < N_{c} \\leq 13.$$\nA critical night length of $12$ hours is consistent with all observations: flowering when $N \\geq 12$ and uninterrupted (Experiments 1 and 4), no flowering when $N=11$ (Experiment 2), and loss of flowering when a $14$-hour night is interrupted (Experiment 3). Therefore, the plant is a short-day plant with $N_{c}$ near $12$ hours.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to statement D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1860579"}]}
