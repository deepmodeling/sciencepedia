Of the phosphorus that is *not* assimilated by the crops, 70.0% becomes chemically bound to soil minerals, a process known as immobilization, rendering it unavailable for immediate biological uptake.

Food: The average dietary intake is 1.40 kg of P per person per year.\n2.  Synthetic Fertilizers: A total of 120,000 kg of P is imported annually for use in city parks and private gardens.\n\nThe key internal flows and outputs in the city's current, unimproved state are as follows:\n- Of the total P imported via food, 85% is consumed and subsequently excreted by the population, entering the city's sewer system. The remaining 15% is disposed of as solid food waste, which is sent directly to a landfill.\n- Of the P from synthetic fertilizers applied to green spaces, 20% is lost via surface runoff into the city's stormwater system, which discharges directly into a nearby river without treatment.\n- All sewage is directed to a central Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). This plant currently operates with a P-removal efficiency of 92%. The P removed from the wastewater is concentrated into biosolids (sludge). In the current system, all of these biosolids are incinerated, and the resulting ash is sent to a landfill. The P that is not removed by the plant is discharged into the river as part of the treated effluent.\n\nMetropolis is proposing a new management scenario to improve P circularity. The new scenario involves two key changes:\n1.  The WWTP is upgraded with an Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) system, which increases its P-removal efficiency to 98%.\n2.  A new city-wide policy mandates that all biosolids produced by the WWTP are no longer incinerated but are instead processed and applied as agricultural fertilizer on regional farmland.
