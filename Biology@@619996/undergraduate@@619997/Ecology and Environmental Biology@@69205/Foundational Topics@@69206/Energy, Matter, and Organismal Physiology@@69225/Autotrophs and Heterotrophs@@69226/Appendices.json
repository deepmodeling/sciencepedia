This first exercise allows you to practice calculating this foundational energy budget. By working through the relationship between Gross Primary Production ($GPP$), autotrophic respiration ($R_a$), and Net Primary Production ($NPP$), you will gain a quantitative understanding of how much energy a primary producer captures versus how much it makes available to the heterotrophic community [@problem_id:1831536].", "problem": "In an experimental, closed-system biosphere designed for long-term space missions, a species of genetically engineered algae serves as the primary producer. The Net Primary Production (NPP) of this algal community, which represents the energy stored as new biomass and made available to the first level of heterotrophs, is measured to be $4,500 \\text{ kcal/m}^2\\text{/year}$. Bio-monitoring reveals that the algae's own metabolic activities, defined as autotrophic respiration ($R_a$), consistently consume an amount of energy equivalent to 40% of the system's Gross Primary Production (GPP). The GPP is the total rate at which the algae capture and store chemical energy.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total Gross Primary Production (GPP) of this algal ecosystem. Express your answer in units of $kcal/m^2/year$.", "solution": "Net primary production (NPP), gross primary production (GPP), and autotrophic respiration ($R_{a}$) are related by the energy balance\n$$\n\\text{NPP} = \\text{GPP} - R_{a}.\n$$\nThe problem states that autotrophic respiration consumes 40 percent of GPP, which we represent as a fraction to maintain exactness:\n$$\nR_{a} = \\frac{2}{5}\\,\\text{GPP}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the NPP relation gives\n$$\n\\text{NPP} = \\text{GPP} - \\frac{2}{5}\\,\\text{GPP} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\text{GPP} = \\frac{3}{5}\\,\\text{GPP}.\n$$\nSolving for GPP in terms of NPP,\n$$\n\\text{GPP} = \\frac{5}{3}\\,\\text{NPP}.\n$$\nWith the given $\\text{NPP} = 4,500 \\text{ kcal/m}^2\\text{/year}$, we obtain\n$$\n\\text{GPP} = \\frac{5}{3}\\times 4,500 = 5\\times 1,500 = 7,500.\n$$\nThus, the gross primary production is $7,500 \\text{ kcal/m}^2\\text{/year}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7500}$$", "id": "1831536"}, {"introduction": "Once energy is fixed by autotrophs, it flows through the ecosystem to various levels of heterotrophs. This practice demonstrates the critical concept of trophic efficiency, showing how energy dramatically diminishes at each step of a food chain [@problem_id:1831530]. Understanding this principle is key to explaining why populations of top predators are so much smaller than populations of producers and why food chains are typically limited to just a few levels.", "problem": "In a simplified aquatic ecosystem, phytoplankton serve as the autotrophic producers. They are consumed by zooplankton (primary consumers), which are in turn consumed by small fish (secondary consumers). Finally, a species of larger predatory fish acts as the tertiary consumer by feeding on the small fish. Field measurements indicate that the total chemical energy stored in the phytoplankton biomass within a specific volume of the ecosystem is $25,000$ Joules. Assuming that the efficiency of energy transfer between each successive trophic level is exactly $10\\%$, calculate the total amount of energy available to the population of tertiary consumers from this food chain. Express your answer in Joules.", "solution": "Energy flow through trophic levels follows the principle of ecological transfer efficiency: only a fixed fraction of energy at one trophic level is available to the next. If the transfer efficiency is denoted by $\\eta$, then after $n$ transfers the available energy is multiplied by $\\eta^{n}$.\n\nGiven producer energy $E_{\\text{producers}}=25000$ and transfer efficiency $\\eta=\\frac{1}{10}$ for each step, there are three transfers to reach the tertiary consumers (producers $\\to$ primary $\\to$ secondary $\\to$ tertiary).

This final exercise challenges you to classify organisms in a unique ecosystem that relies entirely on chemical energy, a process known as chemosynthesis [@problem_id:1831517].

Their characteristics are described below:\n\n*   **Organism A:** A microbe that forms dense, colorful mats on the surfaces of hydrothermal vents. It harnesses chemical energy by oxidizing hydrogen sulfide and uses this energy to fix inorganic carbon from the water into complex organic molecules.\n*   **Organism B:** A small, shrimp-like creature that navigates the dark environment using chemosensory appendages. Its diet consists exclusively of grazing on the microbial mats of Organism A.\n*   **Organism C:** A larger, predatory worm-like animal. It is an ambush predator that lies in wait to capture and consume the shrimp-like creatures (Organism B).\n*   **Organism D:** A filamentous fungus that is observed growing on the carcasses of all other organisms (A, B, and C) after they die.
