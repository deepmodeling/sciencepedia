This exercise sharpens your ability to interpret experimental results and apply the core definitions of niche theory.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the environmental tolerances of a newly discovered archaeon, designated *Candidatus Halosalina*, isolated from a hypersaline lagoon. The primary environmental gradient in this lagoon is salinity. The ecologist performs two experiments to determine the population viability of *Candidatus Halosalina* at different salinities, measured as the percentage of dissolved salts by mass. A population is considered viable if its per capita growth rate is positive.\n\nExperiment 1: Axenic Culture\n*Candidatus Halosalina* is grown in a laboratory medium in the complete absence of any other species. The population exhibits a positive growth rate only when the salinity is maintained strictly between 6.0% and 22.0%. Outside this range, the growth rate is zero or negative.\n\nExperiment 2: Co-culture with a Competitor\n*Candidatus Halosalina* is grown in the same medium but this time in the presence of a competing bacterial species, *Salinivibrio sp.*, which is also native to the lagoon. In the presence of this competitor, the population of *Candidatus Halosalina* exhibits a positive growth rate only when the salinity is maintained strictly between 15.0% and 22.0%.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements correctly identifies the salinity ranges corresponding to the fundamental niche and the realized niche of *Candidatus Halosalina*?\n\nLet FN denote the fundamental niche and RN denote the realized niche.\n\nA.

By definition:\n- A population is viable at salinity $s$ if its per capita growth rate $r(s)$ satisfies $r(s) > 0$.\n- The fundamental niche (FN) with respect to salinity is the set of $s$ values for which $r(s) > 0$ in the absence of interspecific interactions (abiotic tolerance alone).\n- The realized niche (RN) with respect to salinity is the set of $s$ values for which $r(s) > 0$ in the presence of the biotic interactions prevailing in the community (here, competition with the bacterium).\n\nLet $s$ denote salinity expressed as a mass fraction (e.g., $0.060$ corresponds to 6.0 percent).

This matches option A: FN from 6.0 percent to 22.0 percent and RN from 15.0 percent to 22.0 percent.\n\nOther options are inconsistent: B reverses FN and RN; C assigns the RN to the complementary lower interval, which contradicts the co-culture result; D is false because FN is directly determined by the axenic experiment; E incorrectly splits the FN and RN into disjoint adjacent ranges not supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1850601"}, {"introduction": "Ecological communities are complex webs of interactions, and a species' distribution is rarely limited by a single factor. This problem moves beyond a simple one-on-one interaction to a more realistic scenario involving a fish species facing pressures from both predation and competition [@problem_id:1850590]. Your task is to dissect how these two different biotic forces act on separate parts of the species' fundamental temperature range to shape its ultimate, realized niche. This practice develops a more nuanced understanding of how multiple environmental pressures combine to determine where a species can actually live.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the distribution of two fish species, the Shaded Darter and the Sunfin Minnow, along a stable longitudinal temperature gradient in a river. The Shaded Darter can physiologically tolerate a temperature range of $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$. The Sunfin Minnow can tolerate a range of $16^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $28^\\circ\\text{C}$. In laboratory settings where they are kept in separate tanks, both species thrive throughout their respective tolerable temperature ranges.\n\nHowever, field observations reveal a more complex distribution. A predatory bird, the River Kingfisher, forages heavily in the cooler, clearer upstream waters where temperatures range from $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $15^\\circ\\text{C}$, but it rarely hunts in the warmer, more turbid downstream sections. Furthermore, in the zone of thermal overlap ($16^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$), the Sunfin Minnow is a much more aggressive and efficient forager, and it consistently outcompetes the Shaded Darter for resources.\n\nBased on these interactions, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between the fundamental thermal niche and the realized thermal niche of the Shaded Darter in this river system?\n\nA.

The fundamental and realized niches are both determined exclusively by the abiotic temperature gradient, with biotic interactions being negligible.", "solution": "We begin by distinguishing the fundamental thermal niche from the realized thermal niche. The fundamental thermal niche of the Shaded Darter is defined by the abiotic temperature range it can physiologically tolerate in the absence of biotic interactions. From the laboratory evidence, the Shaded Darter thrives across the temperature range of $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$. Thus, its fundamental thermal niche is the interval $[10, 22]$.\n\nNext, we incorporate the biotic interactions that determine the realized niche in the field:\n- Predation: The River Kingfisher forages heavily in the cooler upstream waters where temperatures lie in the range of $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $15^\\circ\\text{C}$. This predation pressure restricts the Shaded Darter at the cooler end of its fundamental range. Therefore, the cooler portion of the fundamental niche, the interval $[10, 15]$, is reduced or rendered unsuitable due to predation.\n- Interspecific competition: In the overlap zone from $16^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$, the Sunfin Minnow is more aggressive and efficient, consistently outcompeting the Shaded Darter. This restricts the Shaded Darter at the warmer end of its fundamental range, effectively excluding it from the interval $[16, 22]$ due to competition.\n\nCombining these interactions, the realized thermal niche is strictly a subset of the fundamental thermal niche, with the cooler end constrained by predation and the warmer end constrained by interspecific competition. It is not identical to the fundamental niche, not larger than it, and not restricted solely by a single biotic factor.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best captures this relationship is that the realized niche is a subset of the fundamental niche, restricted by interspecific competition at the warmer end and by predation at the cooler end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1850590"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand and predict ecological dynamics, ecologists often translate conceptual ideas into mathematical models.

In the absence of competitors, the finch's foraging strategy can be modeled by its fundamental niche. The net energy gain rate, $G_F(h)$, for foraging at a vertical height $h$ above the ground is well-described by a parabolic function:\n$$G_F(h) = G_{max} - \\alpha (h - h_0)^2$$\nHere, $h_0$ is the intrinsically optimal foraging height, $G_{max}$ is the maximum possible energy gain rate at this height, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant that characterizes the bird's degree of specialization (a higher $\\alpha$ means a narrower niche).\n\nA new, invasive species of insectivorous lizard arrives in the forest. This lizard forages on the same insects as the finch but is restricted to the lower strata of the forest. This introduces interspecific competition, which imposes an energetic cost on the finch when it forages at lower heights.
