Interspecific competition often forces a species to contract its niche, compelling it to use less-preferred resources to survive. This exercise provides a hands-on way to quantify this niche shift, using probability distributions to calculate the tangible ecological consequences of competition and translating abstract theory into a concrete measure of displacement [@problem_id:1867002].", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the effects of interspecific competition on the foraging behavior of a small desert rodent, Species B. The primary resource dimension for this species and its larger competitor, Species A, is the size of the seeds they consume. The ecologist models the consumption pattern for seed size as a normal distribution, where the mean represents the preferred seed size and the standard deviation reflects the breadth of the dietary niche.\n\nThe study is conducted in two types of large, fenced enclosures:\n1.  **Control Enclosures:** Containing only Species B. Here, the distribution of consumed seed sizes is found to be normal with a mean $\\mu_F = 5.0$ mm and a standard deviation $\\sigma_F = 1.5$ mm. This represents the *fundamental niche* of Species B.\n2.  **Experimental Enclosures:** Containing both Species A and Species B. In this competitive environment, the distribution of seed sizes consumed by Species B is altered, now following a normal distribution with a mean $\\mu_R = 2.5$ mm and a standard deviation $\\sigma_R = 0.8$ mm. This represents the *realized niche* of Species B.\n\nThe shift in foraging behavior indicates that competition from Species A has forced Species B to utilize resources that are different from its original preference. To quantify this ecological displacement, calculate the probability that a seed consumed by a Species B individual in the competitive experimental environment (i.e., from its realized niche) has a size that would be considered \"atypical\" for its fundamental niche. An \"atypical\" seed size is defined as any size that falls more than one standard deviation ($\\sigma_F$) away from the mean ($\\mu_F$) of the fundamental niche distribution.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.
