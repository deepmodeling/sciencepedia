We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe analysis concerns $3$ local communities, designated by the sets of species they contain: $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $B=\\{2,3,4\\}$, and $C=\\{3,4,5\\}$. The species are identified by integer labels.\n\nThe first quantity to be determined is the local species richness for each community, which is the alpha diversity, denoted as $\\alpha$. The richness of a set is its cardinality, which is the count of its distinct elements.\nFor community $A$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{A} = |A| = |\\{1,2,3\\}| = 3$.\nFor community $B$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{B} = |B| = |\\{2,3,4\\}| = 3$.\nFor community $C$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{C} = |C| = |\\{3,4,5\\}| = 3$.\n\nThe next quantity required is the mean local richness, denoted as $\\bar{\\alpha}$. This is defined as the arithmetic mean of the individual local richness values. For a system of $N$ communities, it is given by $\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i$.\nIn this case, $N=3$, so we have:\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B} + \\alpha_{C}}{3} = \\frac{3 + 3 + 3}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 $$\nThus, the mean local richness is $\\bar{\\alpha} = 3$.\n\nThe third quantity is the regional richness, or gamma diversity, denoted as $\\gamma$. It is defined as the total number of species in the regional pool. The regional pool is the union of all local species sets.\nLet the regional species set be $R = A \\cup B \\cup C$.\n$$ R = \\{1,2,3\\} \\cup \\{2,3,4\\} \\cup \\{3,4,5\\} $$\nThe union of these sets contains all unique elements present across all sets:\n$$ R = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} $$\nThe regional richness $\\gamma$ is the cardinality of this regional set:\n$$ \\gamma = |R| = |\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}| = 5 $$\nThus, the regional richness is $\\gamma = 5$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the Whittaker multiplicative beta diversity, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$. The problem statement provides its definition: it is the multiplicative factor by which regional richness exceeds mean local richness. This relationship is formally expressed as $\\gamma = \\bar{\\alpha} \\times \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$.\nTo find $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$, we rearrange this fundamental equation:\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\bar{\\alpha}} $$\nSubstituting the computed values for $\\gamma$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{5}{3} $$\nThis value represents the effective number of distinct communities in the region, reflecting the degree of compositional turnover among them.\n\nThe problem requires the final result as an ordered triple $(\\bar{\\alpha}, \\gamma, \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}})$. Based on our derivations, the components of this triple are:\nMean local richness, $\\bar{\\alpha} = 3$.\nRegional richness, $\\gamma = 5$.\nWhittaker beta diversity, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe final result is provided in exact fractional form as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 & \\frac{5}{3} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2470400"}, {"introduction": "While Whittaker's beta diversity provides a single, useful value for the overall difference between communities, ecologists often need a more nuanced view of compositional change. This is achieved using dissimilarity indices, which quantify the degree to which two communities share species.

Consider two communities described by species presence–absence vectors $x=(1,1,1,0,0)$ and $y=(1,0,1,1,0)$ for a species pool of size $5$. Using only the fundamental definitions that (i) alpha diversity is species richness, the count of present species in a community; (ii) the number of shared species is the size of the intersection of the communities’ species sets; and (iii) the total species observed across the pair (gamma diversity for the pair) is the size of the union of the two sets, derive from first principles the Jaccard dissimilarity and the Sørensen–Dice dissimilarity for this pair of communities.

Provide exact values as reduced fractions; no rounding is required and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard ecological principles, well-posed with all necessary information, and presented objectively. We will proceed with a derivation from first principles.\n\nLet the set of species in the first community, represented by the vector $x=(1,1,1,0,0)$, be denoted by the set $X = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$. Let the set of species in the second community, represented by $y=(1,0,1,1,0)$, be denoted by $Y = \\{s_1, s_3, s_4\\}$. The total species pool consists of $5$ species, $\\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5\\}$.\n\nWe must first formalize the fundamental quantities based on the problem's definitions and set theory. We define three essential counts derived from the comparison of these two sets:\n1.  Let $a$ be the number of species common to both communities. This is the cardinality of the intersection of the two sets: $a = |X \\cap Y|$.\n2.  Let $b$ be the number of species present only in community $X$: $b = |X \\setminus Y|$.\n3.  Let $c$ be the number of species present only in community $Y$: $c = |Y \\setminus X|$.\n\nFrom the given vectors, we can compute these quantities:\n-   The shared species are those where both vectors have a $1$. This occurs at positions $1$ and $3$. Thus, $a = |\\{s_1, s_3\\}| = 2$.\n-   Species unique to $x$ are at positions where $x$ has a $1$ and $y$ has a $0$. This occurs at position $2$. Thus, $b = |\\{s_2\\}| = 1$.\n-   Species unique to $y$ are at positions where $y$ has a $1$ and $x$ has a $0$. This occurs at position $4$. Thus, $c = |\\{s_4\\}| = 1$.\n\nNow, we connect these counts to the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n-   Definition (i) states that alpha diversity is species richness.\n    -   Alpha diversity of community $X$ is $\\alpha_X = |X| = a+b = 2+1=3$.\n    -   Alpha diversity of community $Y$ is $\\alpha_Y = |Y| = a+c = 2+1=3$.\n-   Definition (ii) states that the number of shared species is the size of the intersection. This is precisely our quantity $a = 2$.\n-   Definition (iii) states that the total number of species across the pair is the size of the union. This quantity, often denoted as gamma diversity for this local context, is $\\gamma = |X \\cup Y|$. From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, or by simple summation of components, $\\gamma = a+b+c = 2+1+1=4$.\n\nDissimilarity measures quantify the degree of difference between two communities. They are typically defined as $1$ minus a corresponding similarity index. A similarity index, in this context, relates the number of shared species to some form of total species count.\n\nFirst, we derive the Jaccard dissimilarity, $D_J$. The Jaccard similarity index, $S_J$, is defined as the ratio of the number of shared species to the total number of species present in either community. This is a direct formalization of the concept of overlap relative to the total \"footprint\" of the two communities.\n$$S_J = \\frac{|X \\cap Y|}{|X \\cup Y|}$$\nUsing our established notation:\n$$S_J = \\frac{a}{a+b+c}$$\nThe Jaccard dissimilarity, $D_J$, is the complement of this similarity:\n$$D_J = 1 - S_J = 1 - \\frac{a}{a+b+c} = \\frac{(a+b+c) - a}{a+b+c} = \\frac{b+c}{a+b+c}$$\nThe numerator, $b+c$, is the total number of species that are not shared (i.e., are unique to one of the communities). The denominator, $a+b+c$, is the total number of unique species observed across both communities (the gamma diversity of the pair). The Jaccard index thus expresses dissimilarity as the proportion of the total species pool that is not shared. In its denominator, each species, whether shared or unshared, is counted exactly once. This means shared species and unshared species are weighted equally in the normalization term.\n\nNext, we derive the Sørensen–Dice dissimilarity, $D_S$. The Sørensen–Dice similarity index, $S_S$, also relates shared species to a total, but the \"total\" is defined differently. It is normalized by the arithmetic mean of the number of species in each community, multiplied by $2$ to maintain the range $[0,1]$.\n$$S_S = \\frac{2|X \\cap Y|}{|X| + |Y|}$$\nUsing our notation:\n$$S_S = \\frac{2a}{(a+b) + (a+c)} = \\frac{2a}{2a+b+c}$$\nThe Sørensen–Dice dissimilarity, $D_S$, is the complement:\n$$D_S = 1 - S_S = 1 - \\frac{2a}{2a+b+c} = \\frac{(2a+b+c) - 2a}{2a+b+c} = \\frac{b+c}{2a+b+c}$$\nThe numerator, $b+c$, is again the total number of unshared species. The denominator, $2a+b+c$, is the sum of the species richnesses of the two communities. In this denominator, the shared species ($a$) are counted twice (once for each community they are in), while the unshared species ($b$ and $c$) are each counted once. This gives greater weight to the shared species in the normalization term compared to the Jaccard index. Consequently, for a given number of shared species, the Sørensen-Dice similarity score will be higher (and dissimilarity lower) than the Jaccard score, as the double-counting of shared species emphasizes the agreement between the communities.\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for the given communities using $a=2$, $b=1$, and $c=1$.\n\nJaccard Dissimilarity:\n$$D_J = \\frac{b+c}{a+b+c} = \\frac{1+1}{2+1+1} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSørensen–Dice Dissimilarity:\n$$D_S = \\frac{b+c}{2a+b+c} = \\frac{1+1}{2(2)+1+1} = \\frac{2}{4+2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe results are to be provided as exact reduced fractions.\nJaccard dissimilarity is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSørensen dissimilarity is $\\frac{1}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2470383"}, {"introduction": "A high beta diversity value tells us that communities are different, but it doesn't tell us *how* they are different.
