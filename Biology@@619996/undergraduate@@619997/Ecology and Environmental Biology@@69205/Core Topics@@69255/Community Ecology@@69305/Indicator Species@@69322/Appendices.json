Effective indicator species typically have a narrow ecological tolerance for environmental changes.\n\nA team of aquatic ecologists is assessing the impact of agricultural runoff on stream health. They collected data on the population density of three different species of caddisfly larvae (aquatic insects) from three separate stream sites with differing levels of organic pollution. The data are summarized below:\n\n*   **Site 1 (Pristine):** An upstream, forested site with no detectable organic pollution. Average larval densities were:\n    *   *Glossosoma limnophilum*: 185 individuals per square meter.\n    *   *Hydropsyche communis*: 25 individuals per square meter.\n    *   *Ceratopsyche coprophila*: 2 individuals per square meter.\n\n*   **Site 2 (Mild Pollution):** A site downstream from a small farm, exhibiting signs of mild organic pollution from fertilizer runoff. Average larval densities were:\n    *   *Glossosoma limnophilum*: 15 individuals per square meter.\n    *   *Hydropsyche communis*: 90 individuals per square meter.\n    *   *Ceratopsyche coprophila*: 45 individuals per square meter.\n\n*   **Site 3 (Heavy Pollution):** A site further downstream, receiving direct effluent from a cattle feedlot, showing heavy organic pollution. Average larval densities were:\n    *   *Glossosoma limnophilum*: 0 individuals per square meter.\n    *   *Hydropsyche communis*: 20 individuals per square meter.\n    *   *Ceratopsyche coprophila*: 220 individuals per square meter.\n\nBased on the definition of an effective indicator species and the data provided, which caddisfly species would be the most reliable and sensitive indicator for detecting the *initial onset* of mild organic pollution in a previously pristine stream?\n\nA. *Glossosoma limnophilum*\n\nB. *Hydropsyche communis*\n\nC. *Ceratopsyche coprophila*\n\nD. Both *Glossosoma limnophilum* and *Ceratopsyche coprophila* are equally effective.\n\nE.

However, because it is already present at low density under pristine conditions and increases with pollution, occasional low-level presence in a pristine site could yield ambiguity, and its tolerance indicates it is not the most sensitive taxon to the initial onset. Moreover, the absolute change from pristine to mild is smaller than for Glossosoma limnophilum.\n\nComparing sensitivity to the onset of mild pollution, Glossosoma limnophilum shows the largest absolute drop ($170$ individuals per square meter) and a very large proportional decline ($\\frac{34}{37}$), consistent with a narrow tolerance and a strong, early warning signal. Hydropsyche communis is not monotonic and thus less reliable. Ceratopsyche coprophila is tolerant and increases, but its low presence even in pristine conditions reduces reliability for detecting the initial onset compared to the sharp decline of Glossosoma limnophilum.\n\nTherefore, the most reliable and sensitive indicator for detecting the initial onset of mild organic pollution is Glossosoma limnophilum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1854923"}, {"introduction": "While identifying a single sensitive species is useful, a more robust assessment of ecosystem health often involves synthesizing information from the entire community.
