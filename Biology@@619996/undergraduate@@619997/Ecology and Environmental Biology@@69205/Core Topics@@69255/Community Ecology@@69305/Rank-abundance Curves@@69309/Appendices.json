The key is to calculate the proportional abundance for each species in each option, rank them, and see which set matches the problem description.\n\nThe proportional abundance, $p_i$, for a species $i$ is calculated as the number of individuals of that species, $n_i$, divided by the total number of individuals, $N$, in the community:\n$$p_i = \\frac{n_i}{N}$$\nThe given rank-abundance data points are:\n- Rank 1: proportional abundance = 0.60\n- Rank 2: proportional abundance = 0.20\n- Rank 3: proportional abundance = 0.15\n- Rank 4: proportional abundance = 0.05\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\nThe counts are: Monarch Butterfly: 75, Painted Lady: 15, Cabbage White: 6, Eastern Tailed-Blue: 4.\nThe total number of individuals is $N = 75 + 15 + 6 + 4 = 100$.\nNow we calculate the proportional abundances:\n- Monarch Butterfly: $p = \\frac{75}{100} = 0.75$\n- Painted Lady: $p = \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15$\n- Cabbage White: $p = \\frac{6}{100} = 0.06$\n- Eastern Tailed-Blue: $p = \\frac{4}{100} = 0.04$\nRanking these abundances from highest to lowest gives the sequence: 0.75 (Rank 1), 0.15 (Rank 2), 0.06 (Rank 3), 0.04 (Rank 4). This sequence (0.75, 0.15, 0.06, 0.04) does not match the required sequence (0.60, 0.20, 0.15, 0.05). Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\nThe counts are: European Starling: 30, House Sparrow: 30, American Robin: 30, Northern Cardinal: 10.\nThis community has three species with the same abundance (30). In a rank-abundance curve, tied ranks are handled by assigning an average rank. Here, the three species would share ranks 1, 2, and 3, giving them an average rank of $(1+2+3)/3 = 2$. The rank structure would be one species at rank 2, another at rank 2, a third at rank 2, and the last at rank 4. This structure is fundamentally different from the 1, 2, 3, 4 ranking specified. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThe counts are: Red Oak: 120, White Pine: 40, Sugar Maple: 30, American Beech: 10.\nThe total number of individuals is $N = 120 + 40 + 30 + 10 = 200$.\nNow we calculate the proportional abundances:\n- Red Oak: $p = \\frac{120}{200} = 0.60$\n- White Pine: $p = \\frac{40}{200} = 0.20$\n- Sugar Maple: $p = \\frac{30}{200} = 0.15$\n- American Beech: $p = \\frac{10}{200} = 0.05$\nNow, let's rank these species by their abundance:\n- The most abundant is the Red Oak (120 individuals). Its proportional abundance is 0.60. This is our Rank 1 species.\n- The second most abundant is the White Pine (40 individuals). Its proportional abundance is 0.20. This is our Rank 2 species.\n- The third most abundant is the Sugar Maple (30 individuals). Its proportional abundance is 0.15. This is our Rank 3 species.\n- The least abundant is the American Beech (10 individuals). Its proportional abundance is 0.05. This is our Rank 4 species.\nThe sequence of ranked proportional abundances is (0.60, 0.20, 0.15, 0.05). This perfectly matches the sequence given in the problem statement. Thus, option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe counts are: Largemouth Bass: 50, Bluegill: 50, Yellow Perch: 50, Black Crappie: 50.\nAll species have the same abundance. This describes a perfectly even community where all species share the top rank. This does not match the described curve, which shows a steep decline in abundance with rank. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option E:**\nThe counts are: Western Honey Bee: 100, Common Eastern Bumblebee: 35, Carpenter Bee: 15, Sweat Bee: 5.\nThe total number of individuals is $N = 100 + 35 + 15 + 5 = 155$.\nNow we calculate the proportional abundances:\n- Western Honey Bee: $p = \\frac{100}{155} \\approx 0.645$\n- Common Eastern Bumblebee: $p = \\frac{35}{155} \\approx 0.226$\n- Carpenter Bee: $p = \\frac{15}{155} \\approx 0.097$\n- Sweat Bee: $p = \\frac{5}{155} \\approx 0.032$\nRanking these abundances gives the sequence: (0.645, 0.226, 0.097, 0.032). This sequence does not match the required sequence (0.60, 0.20, 0.15, 0.05).
