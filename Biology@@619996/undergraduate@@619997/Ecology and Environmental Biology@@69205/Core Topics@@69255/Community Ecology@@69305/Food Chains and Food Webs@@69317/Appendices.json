This exercise provides essential practice in translating descriptive feeding relationships into a structured food web and correctly assigning organisms to their respective trophic levels. Mastering this skill is fundamental to analyzing the structure and function of any ecosystem. [@problem_id:1849774]", "problem": "In a simplified, self-contained temperate forest ecosystem, the feeding relationships among several key species are described as follows. The foundation of the food web consists of producers such as Oak Trees (producing acorns) and Ferns. Grey Squirrels feed exclusively on acorns, while White-tailed Deer feed on both acorns and Ferns. Red Foxes are known to prey on Grey Squirrels. Coyotes in this ecosystem prey on both White-tailed Deer and Red Foxes. Finally, Black Bears are omnivores, with a diet consisting of acorns, Ferns, and Grey Squirrels.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we define the trophic levels as follows:\n-   **Producers (Trophic Level 1)**: Organisms that create their own food.\n-   **Primary Consumers (Trophic Level 2)**: Organisms that feed on Producers.\n-   **Secondary Consumers (Trophic Level 3)**: Organisms that feed on Primary Consumers.\n-   **Tertiary Consumers (Trophic Level 4)**: Organisms that feed on Secondary Consumers.\n\nAn organism that feeds at multiple trophic levels is classified by its highest possible trophic level within this food web.

When an organism feeds at multiple levels, it is classified by its highest level.\n\nOak Trees and Ferns are producers, so they are at trophic level $1$. Grey Squirrels feed exclusively on acorns (a producer product), so they feed on producers only and are Primary Consumers at trophic level $2$. White-tailed Deer feed on acorns and ferns, both producers, so they are also Primary Consumers at trophic level $2$.\n\nRed Foxes prey on Grey Squirrels, which are primary consumers at trophic level $2$. Therefore, Red Foxes feed on primary consumers and are Secondary Consumers at trophic level $3$.\n\nCoyotes prey on White-tailed Deer (trophic level $2$) and Red Foxes (trophic level $3$). Because they feed on a secondary consumer, their highest level is Tertiary Consumer at trophic level $4$.\n\nBlack Bears consume acorns and ferns (producers, trophic level $1$) and Grey Squirrels (primary consumers, trophic level $2$). The highest level at which they feed is on a primary consumer, so they are Secondary Consumers at trophic level $3$.\n\nThus, the correct identification is: Coyote as Tertiary Consumer, Black Bear as Secondary Consumer, and Red Fox as Secondary Consumer, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1849774"}, {"introduction": "Food webs are dynamic systems that channel energy from producers to consumers, but this transfer is never perfectly efficient. The concept of Trophic Transfer Efficiency (TTE) allows us to quantify this energy flow and predict the biomass an ecosystem can support at each level. This practice problem challenges you to apply TTE to a realistic scenario, calculating the significant, cascading impact an invasive species can have on the biomass of native predators at the top of the food chain. [@problem_id:1849738]", "problem": "A stable freshwater lake ecosystem's primary food chain consists of four trophic levels. At the base are phytoplankton (producers), which are consumed by zooplankton (primary consumers). The zooplankton are then preyed upon by small fish (secondary consumers), which in turn are the food source for larger predatory fish (tertiary consumers). In this stable state, the total biomass of phytoplankton is supported by a primary production of $B_P = 2.50 \\times 10^{7}$ kg per year. The Trophic Transfer Efficiency (TTE), which is the percentage of biomass transferred from one trophic level to the next, is a constant $E = 12.0\\%$ for all links in this native food chain.\n\nA highly successful invasive species of filter-feeding bivalve is introduced into the lake. After several years, the ecosystem reaches a new equilibrium. The invasive bivalves now consume a fraction $p = 60.0\\%$ of the total phytoplankton primary production. This bivalve species has no natural predators within the described food chain, and its biomass is therefore not transferred to the native secondary consumers.\n\nAssuming the TTE between the native species remains unchanged, calculate the new total biomass of the large predatory fish (tertiary consumers) at this new equilibrium.
