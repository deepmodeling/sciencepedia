You will use stable isotope signatures ($\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}$) to deduce a dietary and behavioral shift in a mesopredator following the disappearance of its apex predator. This problem bridges theoretical models with powerful analytical techniques used in the field to reveal the subtle, yet profound, consequences of trophic cascades [@problem_id:1893523].", "problem": "In a temperate estuarine ecosystem, sea otters are the apex predators. A key mesopredator in this system is a species of large crab that is heavily preyed upon by the otters. Ecologists have been studying the food web dynamics, focusing on the interactions between the otters, the crabs, a species of herbivorous snail, the seagrass that forms the primary habitat, and the epiphytic algae that grow upon the seagrass blades.\n\nStable isotope analysis provides the following baseline information for the primary producers and trophic enrichment factors:\n- Seagrass has a distinctive carbon isotope signature of $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = -10.0‰$ and a nitrogen signature of $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N} = +0.5‰$.\n- Epiphytic algae have a $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = -20.0‰$ and a $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N} = +1.0‰$.\n- Trophic enrichment (the change in isotopic signature from diet to consumer) is approximately $\\Delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = +1.0‰$ and $\\Delta^{15}\\mathrm{N} = +3.5‰$ for each trophic level increase.\n\nHistorically, in the presence of sea otters, the crab population was suppressed, and crabs were observed to be timid, primarily consuming the abundant herbivorous snails. After a sudden viral outbreak decimated the sea otter population, ecologists returned several years later to find the ecosystem dramatically altered. They observed that the crab population was much larger and that individuals foraged boldly in open seagrass meadows. Concurrently, the herbivorous snail population had plummeted, and the seagrass blades were visibly 'cleaner', with less epiphytic algae.\n\nIsotope analysis of crab muscle tissue from before the otter disappearance and after revealed a significant dietary shift.\n- **Before (with otters):** Average crab signature was $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = -19.0‰$ and $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N} = +8.0‰$.\n- **After (no otters):** Average crab signature was $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = -12.0‰$ and $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N} = +4.5‰$.\n\nBased on the ecological observations and the isotopic data, which of the following scenarios provides the most plausible trophic cascade explanation for the observed changes in the crab's stable isotope signature?\n\nA. The removal of otters led to an increase in the crab population and a change in their behavior. The emboldened crabs over-consumed their primary prey (snails), causing the snail population to crash. The crabs then switched their diet to consuming seagrass directly, resulting in a decrease in their trophic level and a shift in their carbon source signature.\n\nB. The disappearance of otters allowed the herbivorous snail population to grow uncontrollably. The snails consumed all the epiphytic algae and then switched to eating seagrass. The crabs continued to eat snails, and their isotopic signature changed to reflect the snails' new diet of seagrass.\n\nC. The absence of otters allowed the crabs to grow to a larger average size. These larger crabs were better equipped to consume the tough seagrass. This dietary shift to a higher-quality food source is reflected in the increase in the crab's $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signature and the decrease in their $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ signature.\n\nD. Following the otter disappearance, an unrelated change in water chemistry led to a decline in the epiphytic algae population. The snail population, which depended on the algae, subsequently crashed. This forced the crabs to switch their diet to consuming seagrass detritus, which has a lower trophic position.\n\nE. The removal of otters led to a trophic cascade where crab populations increased, leading to the over-consumption and crash of the snail population. In response to the loss of their primary food source, the crabs switched to preying on a cryptic species of small fish that feeds on zooplankton, which explains the observed isotopic shift.", "solution": "All delta values are in per mil.

Let $f$ be the fraction of algal carbon in the diet’s base.

Overall, the after data indicate a drop to near-primary-consumer level and a strong shift toward seagrass-based carbon.\n\nEvaluate scenarios:\n\n- A. Otter removal increases crabs, snails crash due to predation, crabs switch to seagrass. Prediction: a decrease by roughly one trophic level (from secondary consumer to primary consumer) and a carbon shift toward seagrass. This matches the observed decrease in $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ from $+8.0$ to $+4.5$ and increase in $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ from $-19.0$ toward the seagrass-like $-12.0$. The ecological observations (emboldened crabs, snail crash) are consistent with this cascade.\n\n- B. Snails increase and switch to seagrass; crabs keep eating snails. Prediction for crabs would be two trophic steps above seagrass: $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}\\approx 0.5+2\\times 3.5=7.5$ and $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}\\approx -10.0+2\\times 1.0=-8.0$, which contradicts the observed $+4.5$ and $-12.0$, and also contradicts the observed snail crash.\n\n- C. Larger crabs eat seagrass; this could qualitatively explain lower $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ and higher $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, but it does not provide the trophic cascade mechanism that explains the snail crash; moreover, the isotopes point to a trophic-level drop and seagrass carbon regardless of size, which is more parsimoniously explained by prey depletion and diet switch as in A.\n\n- D. Unrelated water chemistry reduces algae, snails crash, crabs eat seagrass detritus. Although detrital feeding could yield a low trophic level and seagrass-like carbon, this does not constitute the observed trophic cascade initiated by otter removal and contradicts the direct predation mechanism implied by emboldened, abundant crabs and snail collapse.\n\n- E. Crabs switch to fish (zooplanktivores). This would increase trophic level; predicted $\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ would be far higher (e.g., around $11.0$ to $11.5$ depending on baseline), contradicting the observed decrease to $+4.5$.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario that aligns with both the ecological observations and the isotopic shift—a drop of about one trophic level and a move toward seagrass-derived carbon—is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1893523"}]}
