This practice [@problem_id:1863250] explores a scenario where a warming climate allows an inhibitory shrub to expand its range, which may limit the habitat of an alpine wildflower. By modeling the species' thermal niche and the impact of inhibition, you will calculate the wildflower's realized population size, illustrating the critical interplay between abiotic factors and species interactions in determining community structure.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the effects of climate change on plant communities on a mountain slope. The temperature $T$ (in degrees Celsius) at a given altitude $z$ (in meters) is described by the linear relationship $T(z) = T_{base} - \\lambda z$, where $T_{base}$ is the temperature at sea level ($z=0$) and $\\lambda$ is the environmental lapse rate.\n\nThe mountain is home to a species of alpine wildflower. In the absence of competition, its population density reaches an equilibrium, a carrying capacity $K_{temp}$, that depends on the local temperature.

This shrub can establish itself and create a dense canopy in any location where the local temperature is at or above a minimum threshold, $T_{shrub,min}$. Where present, the shrubs create a fractional canopy cover of $S_{canopy}$. This canopy inhibits the growth of the wildflowers by reducing their available resources. The realized carrying capacity, $K_{realized}$, of the wildflowers in the presence of shrubs is given by $K_{realized} = K_{temp} \\times (1 - \\alpha S)$, where $S$ is the fractional shrub cover (ranging from 0 for no cover to 1 for full cover) and $\\alpha$ is an inhibition coefficient.

In the context of the logistic growth model implied by the carrying capacity, the equilibrium population density is equal to the realized carrying capacity, $K_{realized}$. To find this, we must follow a series of steps to determine how the temperature change affects both the wildflowers' potential growth and the inhibitory effect of the shrubs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the new temperature at the target altitude of $z = 2000 \\text{ m}$ after the climate has warmed. The initial sea-level temperature is $T_{base} = 22.0^\\circ \\text{C}$, and it increases by $\\Delta T = 2.00^\\circ \\text{C}$. The new sea-level temperature, $T'_{base}$, is:\n$$T'_{base} = T_{base} + \\Delta T = 22.0^\\circ \\text{C} + 2.00^\\circ \\text{C} = 24.0^\\circ \\text{C}$$\nThe environmental lapse rate is $\\lambda = 6.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\, ^\\circ\\text{C}/\\text{m}$. The new local temperature at $z = 2000 \\text{ m}$, which we will call $T_{local}$, is:\n$$T_{local} = T'_{base} - \\lambda z = 24.0^\\circ \\text{C} - (6.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\, ^\\circ\\text{C}/\\text{m}) \\times (2000 \\text{ m})$$\n$$T_{local} = 24.0^\\circ \\text{C} - 13.0^\\circ \\text{C} = 11.0^\\circ \\text{C}$$\n\nSecond, we determine if the pioneer shrubs are present at this altitude under the new climate. The shrubs establish wherever the local temperature is at or above their minimum threshold, $T_{shrub,min} = 6.00^\\circ \\text{C}$. Since the new local temperature $T_{local} = 11.0^\\circ \\text{C}$ is greater than $T_{shrub,min}$, the shrubs will be present at this altitude. Therefore, the fractional shrub cover, $S$, is equal to the specified canopy cover, $S_{canopy}$.\n$$S = S_{canopy} = 0.800$$\n\nThird, we calculate the potential carrying capacity of the wildflowers, $K_{temp}$, based on the new local temperature. We use the provided formula with $K_{max} = 500$ individuals/hectare, $T_{opt} = 8.00^\\circ \\text{C}$, and $W = 5.00^\\circ \\text{C}$.\n$$K_{temp}(T_{local}) = K_{max} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{local} - T_{opt}}{W}\\right)^2\\right]$$\n$$K_{temp}(11.0^\\circ \\text{C}) = 500 \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{11.0 - 8.00}{5.00}\\right)^2\\right]$$\n$$K_{temp}(11.0^\\circ \\text{C}) = 500 \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{3.00}{5.00}\\right)^2\\right]$$\n$$K_{temp}(11.0^\\circ \\text{C}) = 500 \\left[1 - (0.600)^2\\right] = 500 [1 - 0.360]$$\n$$K_{temp}(11.0^\\circ \\text{C}) = 500 \\times 0.640 = 320 \\text{ individuals per hectare}$$\n\nFourth, we account for the inhibitory effect of the shrub canopy to find the realized carrying capacity, $K_{realized}$. We use the inhibition coefficient $\\alpha = 0.900$ and the shrub cover $S = 0.800$.\n$$K_{realized} = K_{temp} \\times (1 - \\alpha S)$$\n$$K_{realized} = 320 \\times (1 - 0.900 \\times 0.800)$$\n$$K_{realized} = 320 \\times (1 - 0.720)$$\n$$K_{realized} = 320 \\times 0.280$$\n$$K_{realized} = 89.6 \\text{ individuals per hectare}$$\n\nThis value represents the new equilibrium population density of the wildflowers.
