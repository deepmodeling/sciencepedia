This exercise places you in the role of a wildlife biologist tasked with interpreting field data.

Large native predators like wolves and cougars have been absent from this region for over a century. The biologist aims to determine if the deer population is primarily regulated by \"bottom-up\" control, meaning it is limited by the availability of resources such as food and nutrients. After a year-long study, the biologist compiles a list of observations.\n\nFrom the following list of field observations, identify all that would serve as evidence for bottom-up control of this deer population.\n\nA. A distinct \"browse line\" is visible on trees and shrubs, above which foliage is plentiful and below which all palatable leaves and twigs have been consumed.\n\nB. Post-mortem examinations of deer that died from non-traumatic causes reveal extremely low levels of body fat and signs of malnutrition.\n\nC. Local municipal records show a consistently high number of deer-vehicle collisions, which is the leading cause of deer mortality in the area.\n\nD. The ratio of surviving fawns per adult doe, measured at the end of each winter, is significantly lower than ratios observed in deer populations with access to higher quality forage.\n\nE. A small but growing population of coyotes has been documented in the area, and remote cameras have captured instances of coyotes preying on deer fawns.\n\nF. Analysis of several years of data reveals that fluctuations in the deer population growth rate are strongly and positively correlated with the net primary productivity (i.e., plant biomass growth) of the previous year.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which observations support the hypothesis of bottom-up control for a deer population. Let's first define the key concepts.\n\n- **Bottom-up control** in an ecosystem means that the population size of a trophic level is determined by the availability of resources from the trophic level below it. For herbivores like deer, this means their population is limited by the amount and quality of available plant food.\n- **Top-down control** means that the population size of a trophic level is controlled by predation or disease from the trophic level above it.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each observation:\n\n**A. A distinct \"browse line\" is visible on trees and shrubs...**\nA browse line is direct physical evidence that the deer population has consumed all available food within its reach. This indicates that food resources are scarce and that the deer are exerting heavy pressure on their food source. This scarcity of accessible food is a classic limiting factor in bottom-up control. Therefore, this observation supports the bottom-up hypothesis.\n\n**B. Post-mortem examinations of deer...reveal extremely low levels of body fat and signs of malnutrition.**\nLow body fat and signs of malnourishment are physiological indicators of starvation or chronic under-nutrition. This demonstrates that the deer are not obtaining enough energy and nutrients from their environment to maintain healthy body condition. This is a direct consequence of resource limitation and is strong evidence for bottom-up control.\n\n**C. Local municipal records show a consistently high number of deer-vehicle collisions...**\nDeer-vehicle collisions are a form of mortality imposed on the deer population by human activity. While this factor does limit the population size, it is an external force acting \"down\" on the population. This is analogous to predation and is therefore a form of top-down control, not bottom-up.\n\n**D. The ratio of surviving fawns per adult doe...is significantly lower...**\nFawn survival is highly dependent on the mother's health and milk production, as well as the availability of forage for the fawn after weaning. Poor nutrition in adult does leads to lower birth weights and reduced milk, and a scarcity of food in the environment directly impacts the survival of young, vulnerable fawns. A low fawn survival rate, especially when compared to populations with better resources, strongly suggests that resource limitation is capping population growth. This is a key mechanism of bottom-up control.\n\n**E. A small but growing population of coyotes...preying on deer fawns.**\nPredation by coyotes is a classic example of top-down control. A predator (coyote) is consuming a prey (deer), thereby limiting the prey's population. Even if the effect is small, it represents a top-down, not a bottom-up, pressure.\n\n**F. Analysis of several years of data reveals that fluctuations in the deer population growth rate are strongly and positively correlated with the net primary productivity...**\nThis observation provides a direct quantitative link between the resource base (plant growth) and the population dynamics of the consumer (deer). If the deer population grows more when there is more food and grows less (or shrinks) when there is less food, this is the very definition of bottom-up control. The population's trajectory is determined by the productivity of the trophic level below it.\n\nIn summary, observations A, B, D, and F all point to the deer population being limited by the availability and quality of its food resources, which is the definition of bottom-up control. Observations C and E represent forms of top-down control.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "1892879"}, {"introduction": "While observation can suggest patterns, it cannot definitively prove causation. To untangle the complex interactions within an ecosystem, ecologists must design manipulative experiments. This problem [@problem_id:1892927] challenges you to think like an experimental ecologist by evaluating different approaches to pinpoint the primary forces regulating an insect population. The goal is to identify a design that can isolate not only top-down and bottom-up pressures but also reveal how they might interact.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the population dynamics of aphids on a set of kale plants in an experimental garden. The ecologist hypothesizes that the aphid population is regulated by one of two primary mechanisms: \"bottom-up control,\" where the population is limited by the nutritional quality of the kale plants, or \"top-down control,\" where the population is limited by predation from ladybugs. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, the ecologist proposes several experimental designs. All proposed experiments would be conducted on standardized plots, each initially containing an identical number of kale plants and aphids.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs is the most scientifically rigorous and comprehensive for determining whether aphid populations are primarily driven by bottom-up, top-down, or an interaction of both forces?\n\nA. Establish two large plots. In one plot, apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to the soil to enhance kale plant quality. Leave the second plot unfertilized as a control. Monitor the aphid populations in both plots over several weeks.\n\nB. Establish a large number of individual kale plants. On half of the plants, place a fine-mesh cage that allows air and sunlight to pass but prevents ladybugs from accessing the aphids. Leave the other half of the plants uncaged. Monitor the aphid populations on all plants over several weeks.\n\nC. Over the course of one growing season, conduct a purely observational study by carefully monitoring and recording the natural fluctuations in kale plant nitrogen content, aphid population density, and ladybug abundance across the entire garden, without any experimental manipulation.\n\nD. Establish four groups of plots. Group 1 will be the control (no treatment). Group 2 will receive a nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Group 3 will be covered by fine-mesh cages that exclude ladybugs. Group 4 will both receive fertilizer and be covered by fine-mesh cages. Monitor aphid populations in all four groups over several weeks.\n\nE. Establish two large plots. In one plot, release a large number of purchased ladybugs to increase predator density. Leave the second plot as a control with only its natural ladybug population. Monitor the aphid and ladybug populations in both plots over several weeks.", "solution": "Goal: Determine whether aphid population dynamics are governed primarily by bottom-up forces (plant quality), top-down forces (predation), or an interaction of both. To identify main effects and their interaction, the appropriate design is a factorial manipulation that independently and jointly varies plant quality and predator access, with proper controls and replication.\n\nPrinciple: A two-factor factorial design with factors $F$ (fertilization: $F=0$ control, $F=1$ fertilized) and $C$ (cage exclusion of predators: $C=0$ uncaged, $C=1$ caged) permits estimation of main effects and interaction via a model such as\n$$\nY=\\mu+\\alpha F+\\beta C+\\gamma F C+\\epsilon,\n$$\nwhere $Y$ is aphid density, $\\mu$ is the grand mean, $\\alpha$ is the bottom-up main effect, $\\beta$ is the top-down main effect, $\\gamma$ is the interaction term, and $\\epsilon$ is residual error. Evidence for bottom-up control corresponds to $\\alpha \\neq 0$, top-down to $\\beta \\neq 0$, and an interaction to $\\gamma \\neq 0$. Only a design that includes all four treatment combinations allows unbiased estimation and testing of all three parameters.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A manipulates only fertilization. It can detect $\\alpha$ but cannot test $\\beta$ or $\\gamma$, so it cannot determine top-down control or interaction.\n- B manipulates only predator access. It can detect $\\beta$ but cannot test $\\alpha$ or $\\gamma$, so it cannot determine bottom-up control or interaction.\n- C is observational; without manipulation, it cannot establish causality and cannot separate effects or interactions due to confounding.\n- D implements the full $2 \\times 2$ factorial: control $(F=0,C=0)$, fertilized only $(F=1,C=0)$, caged only $(F=0,C=1)$, and fertilized plus caged $(F=1,C=1)$. This uniquely enables estimation of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$. With adequate replication and randomization, it is the most rigorous and comprehensive for inferring bottom-up, top-down, and their interaction.\n- E manipulates predator density only; like B, it addresses $\\beta$ but cannot test $\\alpha$ or $\\gamma$ and may introduce additional confounds (e.g., behavioral changes, emigration).\n\nNote: The most rigorous implementation of predator exclusion uses cage controls (e.g., sham cages) to account for microclimate effects; among the provided choices, D remains the only factorial design and is therefore the most comprehensive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1892927"}, {"introduction": "After designing an experiment, the next step is to analyze the resulting data to draw quantitative conclusions. This practice problem [@problem_id:1892880] delves into a classic reciprocal transplant experiment, a powerful method for determining the factors that set a species' geographic or habitat limits. Here, you will move beyond simply identifying a control mechanism to actually measuring the relative strength of physiological stress (a bottom-up limit) versus interspecific competition, demonstrating how ecologists can quantify the forces that structure natural communities.", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the factors that determine the spatial zonation of two dominant plant species in a temperate salt marsh. The lower marsh zone, with an elevation between 0 and +1.0 meters relative to mean tide level, is dominated by the cordgrass *Halophila dura*. The adjacent upper marsh zone, from +1.0 to +2.0 meters, is dominated by the succulent *Salicornia elata*. The ecologist suspects that the upper distributional limit of *H. dura* is set by competition from *S. elata*, while the lower distributional limit of *S. elata* is set by its physiological intolerance to the harsher abiotic conditions (e.g., waterlogging, anoxia) of the lower zone.\n\nTo test this, a reciprocal transplant experiment was conducted. Seedlings of both species were planted into cleared plots in both the lower and upper marsh zones. For each species in each zone, two treatments were established: one in which the transplant grew alone ('Neighbors Removed') and one where it grew surrounded by the dense, naturally occurring vegetation of that zone ('Neighbors Present'). After one full growing season, the mean final dry biomass per square meter was measured for the transplanted individuals in each plot.\n\nThe experimental results were as follows:\n- *Halophila dura* grown in its native lower zone achieved a biomass of 850 g/m² with neighbors removed and 800 g/m² with neighbors present.\n- *Halophila dura* transplanted to the upper zone achieved a biomass of 600 g/m² with neighbors removed and 150 g/m² with neighbors present.\n- *Salicornia elata* grown in its native upper zone achieved a biomass of 720 g/m² with neighbors removed and 700 g/m² with neighbors present.\n- *Salicornia elata* transplanted to the lower zone achieved a biomass of 90 g/m² with neighbors removed and 50 g/m² with neighbors present.\n\nTo quantify the relative effects of abiotic stress and competition, two indices are defined. The Relative Competition Intensity (RCI) is calculated as $\\text{RCI} = (B_{without} - B_{with}) / B_{without}$, where $B_{with}$ and $B_{without}$ are the biomass of a target species in a given zone with and without neighbors, respectively. The Physiological Stress Index (PSI) for a species moved to a foreign zone is defined as $\\text{PSI} = (B_{max} - B_{foreign}) / B_{max}$, where $B_{max}$ is the maximum potential biomass of that species (achieved in its native zone with neighbors removed) and $B_{foreign}$ is its biomass in the foreign zone, also with neighbors removed.\n\nYour task is to determine the primary factor limiting the distribution of *Halophila dura* at its upper boundary. Calculate the ratio of the RCI it experiences in the upper marsh zone to the PSI it is subjected to when moved from the lower to the upper marsh. Report this ratio, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We are asked to compute, for Halophila dura, the ratio of its Relative Competition Intensity (RCI) experienced in the upper marsh to its Physiological Stress Index (PSI) when moved from the lower to the upper marsh.\n\nBy definition, for a given zone,\n$$\n\\text{RCI}=\\frac{B_{\\text{without}}-B_{\\text{with}}}{B_{\\text{without}}},\n$$\nwhere $B_{\\text{without}}$ is the biomass without neighbors and $B_{\\text{with}}$ is the biomass with neighbors.\n\nFor Halophila dura in the upper zone, $B_{\\text{without}}=600$ and $B_{\\text{with}}=150$, so\n$$\n\\text{RCI}_{\\text{upper}}=\\frac{600-150}{600}=\\frac{450}{600}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\n\nThe physiological stress when moved to a foreign zone is quantified by\n$$\n\\text{PSI}=\\frac{B_{\\text{max}}-B_{\\text{foreign}}}{B_{\\text{max}}},\n$$\nwhere $B_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum potential biomass in the native zone with neighbors removed, and $B_{\\text{foreign}}$ is the biomass in the foreign zone with neighbors removed.\n\nFor Halophila dura, $B_{\\text{max}}=850$ (lower zone, neighbors removed) and $B_{\\text{foreign}}=600$ (upper zone, neighbors removed).
