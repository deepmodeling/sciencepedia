They exhibit high initial abundance shortly after disturbance, then decline as conditions change and later-successional species establish. Therefore, a pioneer species should show high relative abundance at the earliest time point and a monotonic decline thereafter.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Mid-successional species): Mid-successional species increase after pioneers, often peaking at intermediate times as the habitat develops and then declining as late-successional species dominate. Therefore, a mid-successional species should be low or absent early, increase to a maximum at an intermediate time, and then decrease later.\n\nPrinciple 3 (Late-successional/climax species): Late-successional species establish slowly, increase steadily over long timescales, and dominate in the mature or climax community. Therefore, a late-successional species should be absent or rare early, increase gradually, and be dominant at the latest time.\n\nWe now classify each species by comparing its time series to these principles:\n\nSpecies A: Abundance is $0.90$ at year $1$, decreases to $0.30$ by year $20$, $0.05$ by year $60$, and less than $0.01$ by year $100$. This is high early with a sustained decline, matching the definition of a pioneer species.\n\nSpecies B: Absent at year $1$; rises to $0.50$ by year $20$, peaks at $0.70$ by year $60$, and declines to $0.30$ by year $100$. This shows low early presence, a peak at intermediate time, and a later decline, matching a mid-successional species.\n\nSpecies C: Absent at year $1$; low at year $20$ ($0.05$); increases to $0.20$ by year $60$; reaches $0.65$ by year $100$ and becomes dominant. This pattern fits a late-successional (climax) species.\n\nSpecies D: Low at year $1$ ($0.05$), slight increase to $0.10$ by year $20$, then declines to $0.02$ and $0.01$ by years $60$ and $100$. It neither dominates early nor peaks mid-succession nor becomes dominant late; it does not exemplify the key roles sought.\n\nTherefore, the correct mapping is Pioneer: Species A, Mid-successional: Species B, Late-successional: Species C, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1842210"}, {"introduction": "The orderly progression of species during succession is governed by their interactions, which can range from facilitation (helping others) to inhibition (hindering others).
